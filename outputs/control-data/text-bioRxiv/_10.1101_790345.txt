Abstract

10

Ocean microbes are responsible for about 50% of primary production on Earth, and are strongly

11

affected by environmental resource availability. However, selective forces resulting from

12

environmental conditions are not well understood. We studied selection by examining single-

13

nucleotide variants in the marine environment, and discovered strong purifying selective forces

14

exerted across marine microbial genes. We present evidence indicating that this selection is

15

driven by the environment, and especially by nitrogen availability. We further corroborate that

16

nutrient availability drives this 'resource-driven' selection by showing stronger selection on highly

17

expressed and extracellular genes, that are more resource-consuming. Finally, we show that the

18

standard genetic code, along with amino acid abundances, facilitates nutrient conservation by

19

providing robustness to mutations that increase nitrogen and carbon consumption. Notably, this

20

robustness generalizes to multiple taxa across all domains of life, including the Human genome,

21

and manifests in the code structure itself. Overall, we uncover overwhelmingly strong purifying

22

selective pressure across marine microbial life that may have contributed to the structure of our

23

genetic code.

Introduction

25

Ocean microbes, the largest group of organisms on the planet1, are involved in key cycling of

26

nutrients that make up all living systems. They account for nearly half of the carbon compound

27

synthesis on Earth, thereby producing about 50% of breathable oxygen2. These marine microbes

28

also cycle nutrients to perform numerous other important roles, such as biodegradation of

29

complex organic material and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, while flourishing in a wide range

30

of environments with varying ambient conditions such as oxygen and nitrogen levels, light and

31

temperature3,4. Nonetheless, and despite their importance in global energy flux and nutrient

32

cycling, evolutionary forces acting on ocean microbes are not fully understood4.

33

With rapidly changing climate and environment, understanding the types of stress exerted on

34

microbes in marine habitats is of paramount importance. Recent studies4,5 provide evidence of

35

high variability in the core genomic properties of marine microbes, including GC content and

36

genome size, suggesting that this variability is linked to the concentrations of nutrients in the

37

environment. Nitrogen and carbon are major limiting factors in the marine environment and their

38

concentrations are typically inversely correlated6. It was shown that in low-nitrogen environments

39

there is lower incorporation of nitrogen-rich side chains into proteins, a strong A+T bias in

40

nucleotide sequences, and smaller genome sizes, suggesting that nitrogen conservation is a

41

strong selective force7. An opposite trend was shown for carbon4. Previous studies7,8 identified a

42

purifying selective pressure associated with resource conservation, which we term ‘resource-

43

driven’ selection. Such ‘resource-driven’ selection against incorporation of nutrients in a resource-

44

limited environment may be further propagated by the high effective population sizes observed in

45

the open ocean, where even slightly deleterious mutations are rapidly selected against9.

46

Notwithstanding, the ways in which resource-driven selection manifests in protein-coding

47

sequences are not fully elucidated.

48

To illuminate mechanisms through which resource-driven selection affects protein-coding genes,

49

we amalgamated measurements of environmental conditions with publicly available marine

50

metagenomic data from oceanic habitats across the globe (Fig. 1A)3,10. We analyzed purifying

51

selection in 746 such marine samples by devising a tailored computational pipeline examining

52

single nucleotide polymorphisms. This enabled us to systematically associate purifying selection

53

with related environmental measurements. We revealed a strong purifying selective pressure,

54

which seems to be acting in a similar fashion across most marine microbial genes. This purifying

55

selection is associated with environmental nutrient concentrations, specifically nitrate. We further

56

show that resource-consuming genes, which are highly expressed or code for extracellular

57

proteins, are under stronger resource-driven selection as compared to other, less resource-

58

consuming genes. We analyze mutations in nitrate-rich as compared to nitrate-poor waters and

59

show that this selection is likely characterized by specific amino acid preferences depending on

60

environmental conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of amino acids, along with

61

the structure of the genetic code, provides robustness against random mutations that increase

62

carbon and nitrogen incorporation into protein sequences. We extend this observation to codon

63

distributions across many diverse life forms, and suggest that nutrient conservation is encoded in

64

the standard genetic code, which is robust to mutations that result in higher nitrogen and carbon

65

utilization.

Results

67
68

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in marine microbial genes reveal strong purifying

69

selection

70

To better understand the underlying mechanisms governing resource-driven selection acting on

71

marine microbes, we sought to characterize, at the single nucleotide level, how coding sequences

72

of marine microbes are affected by resource availability in their environment. To this end, we

73

devised a computational pipeline that calculates metrics of selection from marine metagenomic

74

samples (Fig. 1B). We downloaded metagenomic sequencing data from 746 samples from the

75

Tara oceans3 (n=136); bioGEOTRACES10 (n=480); Hawaii Ocean Time-series10 (HOT; n=68);

76

and Bermuda Atlantic TimeSeries10 (BATS; n=62) expeditions (Fig. 1A; Methods). We aligned

77

these reads to the Ocean Microbiome Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC)3 and searched for

78

single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that had sufficient high-quality coverage (Fig.

79

1B; Methods). Overall, we found 71,921,864 high-confidence SNPs in 1,590,843 genes.

80

Next, to quantify purifying selection on different gene functions, we annotated genes from the OM-

81

RGC database to inform their functional group membership with either KEGG orthology (KO) or

82

eggNOG orthologous group (OG; Methods). We then calculated, using called SNPs per

83

orthologous group in each of the samples, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous

84

polymorphisms11,12 (pN/pS; Methods). We used pN/pS rated to approximate purifying selection at

85

the population level as dN/dS ratios, which are typically used to characterize these stresses12,

86

were not applicable in this setting (Methods). pN/pS quantifies the rate of nonsynonymous

87

polymorphisms (pN), which lead to a change in the resulting amino acid, normalized to the rate

88

of synonymous polymorphisms (pS), which maintain the coded amino acid.

89

As pN/pS is a proxy for the magnitude of purifying selection exerted on protein-coding sequences,

90

we sought to utilize it to evaluate the selective forces acting on marine microbial functions. The

91

rate of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms was on average, across samples, 0.074

92

(CI [0.072, 0.075]) across all OGs and 0.079 (CI [0.077, 0.080]) across all KOs, similar to

93

previously reported pN/pS ratios across different microbial genomes in the human microbiome11

94

(Fig. 1C,D). With values close to zero indicating very strong selection against amino acid changes,

95

these findings imply that purifying selection is on the same scale in free-living marine organisms

96

as compared to host-associated microbes in the human gut. While gut microbes are expected to

97

be under strong purifying selection in order to keep functioning in the host-associated niche13, the

98

source of this strong purifying selection on ocean microbes is not well understood.

104

Strong resource-driven selection apparent across marine microbial genes

105

To quantify the effects of environmental conditions on selective forces acting on marine microbial

106

genes, we extracted measurements regarding the environment in which each sample was taken.

107

This included the depth of the sample, water temperature and salinity, as well as concentration of

108

the key molecules nitrate, nitrite, oxygen, phosphate and silicate (Fig. S1A-H; Methods). All these

109

measurements of environmental conditions are highly correlated with each other (Fig. S1I), and

110

also presented consistent correlation patterns with pN/pS of many KEGG and eggNOG orthologs

111

(Fig. S2), with low pN/pS at shallow depths and low nitrate concentrations. We therefore sought

112

to estimate the overall variance explained by the environment while accounting for these

113

covariations. To this end, we used a linear mixed model (LMM) with variance components,

114

commonly used in population genetics 14 (Methods). We defined the environmental covariates as

115

random effects in order to quantify the fraction of variance in pN/pS that is explained by resource

116

availability (i.e., environmental explained variance; EEV; Methods). Across both KEGG and

117

eggNOG orthologs we found that a substantial fraction of the variance in pN/pS can be attributed

118

to the environment, where across all orthologs this effect is significantly bigger than zero (Fig.

119

2A,B; Mann-Whitney U test P < 10-16).

120

Different environmental niches may harbor different taxa with different trophic interactions that

121

could lead to differences in selective pressures. Thus, we sought to ensure that these

122

associations between pN/pS and the environment are not confounded by organismal differences

123

across different depths and nitrate concentrations. To this end, we analyzed genes belonging

124

exclusively to the genus Synechococcus (Methods). We calculated pN/pS across all of the coding

125

sequences combined and found a significant positive correlation with nitrate concentrations

126

(P<10-20; Fig. S3A). To further validate that this correlation does not stem from the different

127

effective population sizes in the gradient of environmental nitrogen, we divided the samples into

128

five identically sized groups, based on environmental nitrate concentrations while constraining the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

129

scope of each group to genes present in at least half of the samples. We show that an association

130

of pN/pS with nitrate extends to specific niches across the nitrocline, i.e., in concentrations higher

131

than 1 μmol/kg (P<0.05; Fig. S3B). These results demonstrate the existence of pN/pS gradient

132

as a function of nitrate concentrations, even in a single taxonomic group in a specific

133

environmental niche. This indicates that correlations of pN/pS with environmental variables are

134

not driven exclusively be organismal properties or by differences in trophic conditions across

135

environments, but rather exhibit a significant trend even within a single taxon, in specific niches.

136

Genes are not stand-alone entities, but are rather coded as a sequence in the genome of a

137

microbe. We therefore accounted for a potential non-random association structure between

138

pN/pS rates of different orthologs. To this end, we used a different setting of the LMM, now

139

including both the environmental covariates and pN/pS rates of all other orthologs. Even after

140

accounting for potential non-random association structure between pN/pS rates of different

141

orthologs due to clonal reproduction, the environmental effect was still significantly bigger than

142

zero (P<0.05). In particular, there is an overlap of over 40% in orthologs that are top ranked in

143

terms of EEV between these two model settings. Overall, we observed a very strong association

144

between environmental measurements and the magnitude of purifying selection exerted on most

145

orthologous gene groups. We also observed an association with environmental parameters

146

across many functional categories, including ‘housekeeping’ genes that are important for survival

147

in any given niche, and wished to further elucidate potential mechanisms that can explain it.

148
149

Environment-associated selection is stronger in resource-consuming genes

150

Previous studies4,7 suggested that random mutations that lead to incorporation of additional

151

nutrients to the protein sequences of microbes result in a selective disadvantage. This implies

152

that genes whose protein sequences consume more resources would be under stronger

153

selection. Specifically, highly expressed genes would consume more resources and will therefore

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

154

be under stronger purifying selection7,8,15. In these genes, a mutation leading to incorporation of

155

additional resources would be magnified, as one highly transcribed DNA sequence could translate

156

to thousands of proteins, each consuming more resources. To quantitatively corroborate this

157

hypothesis and examine whether these underlying forces are reflected in the above associations

158

with pN/pS rates, we used an additional expression dataset for marine microbial genes 16 to rank

159

KEGG orthologs by their mean expression (Methods). We found that the most highly expressed

160

genes had a significantly higher fraction of the variance in their pN/pS explained by the

161

environment, as compared to the least expressed ones (Fig. 2C; Mann-Whitney U test P<10-9).

162

We found a significant difference between the gradient of pN/pS rates, as a function of depth

163

(highly correlated with nitrate, nitrite and oxygen; Fig S1I), in highly expressed genes, as

164

compared to least expressed ones (Fig. S4A; Mann-Whitney U test P<10-5), where the former

165

increased more sharply with depth. A few notable examples for genes with high expression and

166

environmental explained variance, as compared to other KEGG KOs, are the β subunit of RNA

167

polymerase (K03043; EEV = 0.82, 0.33 in the first and second LMM settings, respectively; ranked

168

first in both model settings), the β’ subunit (K03046; EEV = 0.8, 0.28; ranked in the top five in

169

both settings) and a peptide/nickel transporter involved in quorum sensing (K02035; EEV = 0.81,

170

0.33; ranked second in both settings).

We additionally hypothesized that genes coding for extracellular proteins will have a similar

pattern as in this case, the resources excreted from the cell cannot be recycled. We found the

same pattern of significantly higher EEV in extracellular protein-coding genes as compared to

186

other gene groups (Methods; Fig. S4B; P<0.05). Overall, our results indicate that these genes

187

exhibit higher ‘resource sensitivity’, manifested by higher variance explained by the environment,

188

potentially due to their high expression levels. This finding provides a data-driven evolutionary

189

perspective to theory and experiments showing lower resource incorporation in highly expressed

190

genes7,8. In summary, the variation in resource-consuming genes, (i.e., highly expressed and

191

extracellular protein-coding), further strengthens our results regarding the breadth of resource-

192

driven selection.

193
194

Resource-driven selection exerts a strong effect on protein-coding sequences

195

We next sought to quantify the effects of this resource-driven selection on protein-coding

196

sequences. To this end, we compared the codon mutation frequencies in low- and high-nitrate

197

samples, after accounting for simplex-related confounders (Methods), and found significant

198

differences in codon mutation frequencies (Fig. S5A-C). We sought to examine the typical change

199

in nutrient consumption in varying nitrate concentrations. We thus defined mutation flux, as the

200

ratio between a codon mutation and its reverse, and estimated it using the log-odds ratio between

201

the two (e.g., 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑝(𝐴𝐴𝐴 → 𝐴𝐴𝐶)/𝑝(𝐴𝐴𝐶 → 𝐴𝐴𝐴)). Notably, across all the mutations significantly

202

more prevalent in samples from high nitrate environments (Methods), averaged across amino

203

acids, we find a significant total increase in nitrogen (Fig. 2D; 18 N atoms summed across all

204

significant amino acid changes, P=0.0082), decrease in carbon (Fig 2D; -37 atoms, P=0.0165),

205

decrease in sulfur (-6 atoms, P=0.009), a significant decrease in molecular weight (-508.91 g/mol,

206

P=0.0193) and a non-significant decrease in oxygen (-6 atoms, P=0.1505). These results indicate

207

that the lower the nitrate concentrations are, the stronger the selection against mutations leading

208

to higher nitrogen incorporation in protein sequences.

209

While nitrate concentrations increase with depth (Fig. S1I), dissolved organic carbon

210

concentrations typically decrease6. Our results are supported by previous observations regarding

211

genomic and proteomic changes associated with environmental concentrations of nitrate4.

212

Mutations in nitrate rich and, typically, carbon poor environments were shown to drive an increase

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

213

in genomic GC content, accompanied by higher rates of nitrogen incorporation and lower rates of

214

carbon incorporation into protein sequences. Here we show, in high resolution, the typical

215

mutations that underlie this phenomenon (Fig. 2D; Fig. S5D). As we base our analysis on pN/pS

216

rates, a proxy for the magnitude and direction of selection exerted on coding sequences, we

217

suggest that the differences observed in gene GC content across varying nitrate concentrations

218

are inseparable from changes to the proteome, and are possibly the result of resource-driven

219

selection exerted on these coding sequences.

220
221

Resource-conservation as an optimization mechanism in the genetic code

222

The standard genetic code is known to be highly efficient in minimizing the effects of

223

mistranslation errors and point mutations17–20. This optimality is prominent among theories

224

regarding the origin of the genetic code21–24. According to the theory of error minimization,

225

selection to minimize the adverse effect of point mutations and translation errors was the principal

226

factor governing the evolution of the genetic code25–32. As a quantitative exploration of this theory

227

requires a well-defined cost function, a few measures of amino acid fitness were previously

228

suggested (e.g., PR scale, Hydropathy index) based on stereochemical theories and hydropathy

229

properties33–36. As we have observed strong patterns of selection for specific amino acids in

230

nutrient-limited environments, we hypothesized that resource conservation may also be a factor

231

in code error minimization.

232

Specifically, we hypothesized that the strong resource-driven selection, whose signature is visible

233

on protein-coding sequences across marine functional groups, may also have resulted in a

234

resource-optimized genetic code, such that the expected cost of a random mutation, in terms of

235

added resources, is minimized. To rigorously test this hypothesis, we first defined a cost function

236

for each element 𝑒 (e.g., carbon, nitrogen), such that the ‘tariff’ of a single mutation is the

237

difference in the number of atoms before and after the mutation. As an example, a missense

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

238

mutation from codon CCA to codon CGA results in an amino acid change from proline to arginine,

239

and an increase of 3 nitrogen atoms and one carbon atom, setting the nitrogen cost of such

240

mutation to 3 and the carbon cost to 1 (Fig. 3A).

241

To estimate the cost of a random mutation on each element, across the entire genetic code, we

242

calculated, for nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, the Expected Random Mutation Cost (ERMC) for the

243

standard genetic code 𝑉! :

244

𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶" (𝑉! ) =

2 𝑃(𝑣)P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′))c"# (𝑣, 𝑣′)
$,$&∈(<

245

Where 𝑃(𝑣) is the abundance of codon 𝑣, calculated from all marine samples; P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)) is the

246

probability of mutation from codon 𝑣 to codon 𝑣′, set to be the relative abundance of the single

247

nucleotide mutation driving this codon change (e.g. for mutation from GCA to CCA, we use the

248

abundance of G-to-C transversions), calculated from all mutations observed in fourfold

249

degenerate codons to avoid sites under strong selection; and c"# (𝑣, 𝑣′) is the ‘tariff’ of a single

250

mutation if an atom of element 𝑒 has been added to the post-mutation amino acid (Methods). For

251

the standard genetic code, and typical codon abundances and mutation rates calculated from

252

marine microbes, we report an ERMC of 0.440, 0.158 and 0.163 for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen

253

respectively, corresponding to an average increase of this number of atoms per random mutation.

254

To check if the genetic code, along with codon abundances and mutation rates in marine

255

microbes, is indeed robust to resource-consuming mutations, we compared it to other hypothetical

256

codes. To this end, we simulated alternative genetic codes by randomizing the first and second

257

position in all codons, while constraining the permutation in stop codons (Methods), creating a

258

null distribution of ERMC. We found that the standard genetic code, common to most life forms,

259

is parsimonious in terms of carbon and nitrogen utilization, given a random mutation, manifested

260

by minimization of the ERMC for nitrogen (Fig 3B; ERMCN P=0.0153) and carbon (Fig. 3B; ERMCC

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

261

P=0.0109), while in the ERMC for oxygen we did not find a significant trend (Fig. 3B; P=0.8659).

262

Remarkably, only two out of 10,000 randomized genetic codes were more resource-robust than

263

the standard genetic code in conservation of nitrogen and carbon together (P=0.0002).

264

Nonetheless, these alternative codes are less conservative than the standard code in maintaining

265

hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of amino acids given a random mutation (Methods; Fig. S6).

266

They may therefore lead to proteins that are more susceptible to structural changes in the event

267

of a random mutation, as was postulated previously in theories governing the evolution of the

268

genetic code.

269

Finally, we sought to confirm that our elemental cost function is not confounded by traditional

270

properties of amino acids such as the polar requirement (PR) and hydropathy index33–36. To this

271

end, we calculated the ERMC using these common cost functions for the standard genetic code

272

and for simulated alternative ones, and compared the overlap between traditional cost functions

273

and our elemental cost functions (Methods). For both cost functions, we found that optimality in

274

terms of carbon or nitrogen utilization implies lack of optimality in polar requirement or in

275

hydropathy (Table S1 nitrogen-PR, P<10-16; nitrogen-hydropathy, P<10-4; carbon-PR, P<10-7;

276

carbon-hydropathy, P<10-20). This result indicates that carbon and nitrogen conservation in the

277

genetic code is not confounded by previously reported optimization properties such as hydropathy

278

and PR. Altogether, these results indicate resource optimization in marine microbes is driven by

279

the structure of the genetic code, alongside specific amino acid choices.

The genetic code facilitates resource conservation across kingdoms

290

To show that the robustness of the genetic code in terms of resource-consumption was not limited

291

to our dataset and analytic approach, we calculated the ERMC of 187 species of genera

292

Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. We calculated codon abundances and mutation rates

293

using

294

transition:transversion rate of 2:137 (Methods). By testing the ERMC of the standard genetic code

295

against a null distribution generated, as before, given these known parameters rather than ones

296

inferred from marine samples, we were able to reveal significant conservation of carbon, nitrogen,

297

and both elements combined (Fig. S7A; ERMCC mean P=0.013, P=0.020; ERMCN mean

298

P=0.049, P=0.032; ERMCCN P=0.0004, P=0.0007 for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus,

299

respectively). To account for inaccuracies and variation in the known parameters, we next

300

calculated the ERMC null distribution for a wide range of transition:transversion rates. We show

301

that the ERMC of the standard genetic code remains significantly conserved for nitrogen, carbon,

302

and both elements combined for most physiological transition:transversion rates (Fig. S7B),

303

indicating that the structure of the genetic code and codon abundances of organisms are the

304

driving force behind genetic code optimization.

305

To explore whether this optimality in the genetic code in terms of nutrient conservation extends

306

across different lifeforms, we performed a similar calculation using codon abundances from 39

307

organisms across all domains of life, including all human protein-coding sequences, and tested a

308

range of transition:transversion rates (Methods). We find that, similarly to marine microbes, the

309

genetic code features optimization in terms of resource utilization for all tested organisms,

310

manifested by a significant minimization of the combined ERMC of nitrogen and carbon in all

311

transition:transversion rates tested (P<0.01, Fig. 3C). Moreover, we find significant optimization,

312

albeit of a lower magnitude, even in the theoretical case where all codon abundances are the

313

same (Fig. S7C). The codon abundances of a great majority of organisms also demonstrate

314

significant minimization of ERMC in nitrogen (Fig. S7D) and carbon (Fig. S7E), given a random

315

mutation, for a wide range of transition:transversion rates. These results indicate that resource

316

optimization in the genetic code transcends taxonomy, codon choices, and mutation rates. It

317

shows that the genetic code may have structural properties that make it robust in terms of

318

resource-consumption. It is also possible that amino acid and codon usage in organisms has

319

evolved to lower nutrient consumption in case of a random mutation, informed by the structure of

320

the code.

321
322

Structural principles drive optimization in the genetic code

323

We next wished to examine the organizing principles that drive the strong resource optimization

324

evident in the standard genetic code. We observed that codons of the nitrogen-rich amino acids

325

histidine, glutamine, asparagine, lysine and arginine span only two nucleotides in their first

326

position and two in their second position. We define this organization to be a ‘square’ arrangement

327

(Fig. 4A; Methods), and hypothesize that, as compared with other arrangements, it amplifies

328

nitrogen conservation. Specifically, in the square arrangement, codons coding for some amino

329

acids (alanine, valine, phenylalanine, and several leucine and serine codons) require at least two

330

mutations to increase the number of nitrogen atoms in the resulting amino acid. This is in contrast

331

to other hypothetical arrangements, including a ‘diagonal’ arrangement in which nitrogen-rich

332

amino acid codons span all possible nucleotides in the first and second positions (Fig 4A;

333

Methods). We suggest that the diagonal arrangement would be nutrient-wasteful, as in these

334

arrangements a single mutation could increase the nitrogen content of a protein sequence in more

335

than one way. To rigorously test this hypothesis, we generated 10,000 random genetic codes,

336

with 220 arrangements happening to embody a square structure, and 127 a diagonal one. We

337

found that, when compared to all other possible arrangements, square arrangements present a

338

significantly lower ERMC (Fig 4A; Mann-Whitney U P<10-10) while diagonal arrangements exhibit

339

a significantly higher ERMC (Fig. 4A; Mann-Whitney U P<10-10). This result demonstrates that

340

resource optimization in the genetic code is driven by structural principles, perhaps underlying

341

the significant optimization observed across kingdoms.

349

compared to ACA. ****, P<10-10.

350
351

Finally, we hypothesized that codon usage for a single amino acid may also be biased due to

352

differential cost of a random mutation for each codon. We therefore examined all amino acids

353

coded by codons with adenine in their first position, focusing on codon usage of the amino acid

354

threonine. We note that a C-to-G transversion in the second position for codons ACT and ACC

355

yields serine (AGT and AGC, respectively), and that the same mutation for codons ACA and ACG

356

yields arginine (AGA and AGG, respectively; Fig. 4B, inset). As arginine has higher carbon and

357

nitrogen content than serine, and lysine a higher carbon content than asparagine, we

358

hypothesized that following a nutrient-conservative model, codons ACT and ACC will have a

359

higher abundance than codons ACA and ACG, respectively, given a known genomic GC content.

We thus examined codon usage in 187 Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains, and show

a significantly higher use of ACT as compared to ACA (Fig 4B; Wilcoxon signed-rank test P<10-

Discussion

369

In this work, we use the proxy of pN/pS rates to show strong purifying selection acting upon

370

protein-coding genes in the marine environment. We demonstrate that a substantial fraction of

371

the variance in pN/pS rates could be attributed to environmental factors, and highlight a strong

372

association of these rates with nitrate concentrations. We show that the variance in pN/pS rates,

373

across resource-consuming genes (i.e., highly expressed and extracellular protein-coding), can

374

be attributed to environmental factors, suggesting that stronger resource-driven selection is

375

exerted upon them. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms from across marine samples, we

376

characterize the typical mutations in nitrate-rich versus nitrate-poor environments and show that

377

these drive incorporation of additional nitrogen-rich amino acids and fewer carbon-rich amino

378

acids to protein sequences. Finally, we provide evidence that the standard genetic code, shared

379

among most lifeforms, facilitates resource conservation, demonstrating that along with codon

380

choices, it is conservative in incorporating additional atoms of nitrogen and carbon given a random

381

mutation. Notably, we show, across tens of thousands of simulated genetic codes, that the

382

standard genetic code surpasses almost all other random simulated codes in conservation of

383

nitrogen and carbon, across multiple taxa from all domains of Life and across multiple codon

384

choices and mutation rates.

385

Hypotheses regarding the origin of the genetic code include stereochemical affinity between a

386

codon or anticodon and their amino acid38,39; a frozen accident theory24, relying on the fact that

387

the code is highly immutable; a co-evolution of the genetic code with the emergence of amino

388

acid-producing biosynthetic pathways22; and an early fixation of an optimal genetic code,

389

suggesting that the code evolved under selection for error minimization40. Our observations are

390

in line with the latter theory of optimality, and suggest that the genetic code may have been

391

optimized also for nutrient conservation. While we do not know the nature of nutrient cycling in

392

the primordial ocean, we hypothesize that scarcity of nitrogen and carbon that are common now

393

may have also prevailed alongside early lifeforms. Thus, an organism harboring a nitrogen- and

394

carbon-efficient genetic code would have had a selective advantage over its peers, especially in

395

the absence of fully evolved DNA mutation repair mechanisms.

396

We note that while we observe resource optimization for nitrogen and carbon conservation in the

397

standard genetic code, oxygen conservation is not optimized. We offer several hypotheses

398

regarding this lack of optimization. First, it is possible that since oxygen is highly abundant in

399

organic molecules, it is less of a limiting factor as compared to carbon and nitrogen and therefore

400

its optimization does not confer a selective advantage. Another option is that oxygen-rich amino

401

acids may function in cellular processes that are independent of protein synthesis and are

402

therefore more readily available and thus not optimized. Prominent examples for this hypothesis

403

are aspartate, which also performs an important function in the malate-aspartate shunt, and

404

glutamate, which plays a role in countless cellular processes.

405

Overall, by using publicly available data on ocean microbes and their corresponding

406

environmental measures, we were able to discern strong purifying selective pressure which

407

shapes marine microbial life, and may have even shaped the structure of the genetic code that

408

was since preserved for billions of years. With the advent of new multi-omic data from

Methods

412
413

Marine microbiome samples

414

Marine samples collected with Tara oceans3, bioGEOTRACES10, the Hawaii Ocean Timeseries

415

(HOT) and the Bermuda Atlantic Timeseries Series (BATS)10 were downloaded from ENA with

416

accessions ENA:PRJEB1787 (TARA oceans prokaryotic fraction), ENA:PRJNA385854

417

(bioGEOTRACES) and ENA:PRJNA385855 (HOT/BATS), each sample with a minimum of 5

418

million reads.

419
420

Mapping of Illumina reads to reference gene sequences

421

Samples were mapped to nucleotide sequences from the Ocean Microbiome Reference Gene

422

Catalog (OM-RGC)3 using bowtie2 with parameters --sensitive -a 20 --quiet -p 8 and saved as a

423

bam file using the ‘samtools view’ command. As gene sequences are relatively short, reads from

424

both ends of the metagenomic sequencing samples were mapped separately, and reunited prior

425

to variant calling.

426
427

Determining metagenomic read assignment probability

428

We determined the probability of assignment of metagenomic reads to marine microbial genes

429

using the Iterative Coverage-based Read-assignment Algorithm (ICRA)43 with parameters

430

max_mismatch=12, consider_lengths=True, epsilon=1e-6, max_iterations=30, min_bins=4,

431

max_bins=100,

432

length_maximum=2e5, use_theta=False. To prevent spurious mapping, alignments were

433

considered for downstream analysis only if the probability of alignment was higher than 0.9.

dense_region_coverage=60,

length_minimum=300,

434

Variant calling

435

Alignments from both ends of all sequencing runs pertaining to the same sample were united

436

using the samtools cat command and sorted using the samtools sort command, with default

437

parameters.

438

To facilitate variant calling in tractable timescales, each filtered, untied and sorted .bam file was

439

split into chunks, each encompassing 10,000 reference sequences (out of about 40 million

440

reference sequences). For each such batch of reference sequences, we called variants across

441

all samples using the following command: bcftools mpileup --threads 4 -a FORMAT/AD -Q 15 -L

442

1000 -d 100000 -m 2 -f <OM-RGC fasta> <bam filenames> | bcftools call --threads 4 -Ov -mv -o

443

<output vcf>, where <OM-RGC fasta> is the fasta file of OM-RGC nucleotide sequences, <bam

444

filenames> are the filenames of all .bam files pertaining to the reference sequence chunk in

445

question, and <output vcf> is the output .vcf file pertaining to that same chunk.

446

Single nucleotide variants were considered as SNPs if they had an allele frequency if at least 1%

447

44

448

30.

449

For a sample mapped to a reference gene to be considered for downstream analysis, we

450

demanded that at least 60% of SNPs called along the length of the reference gene for that sample

451

would be supported by at least 4 reads, thereby enabling accurate calculation of pN/pS rates. For

452

a gene to be considered for downstream analysis, we demanded for that gene to have at least

one SNP common to 20 or more samples.

455

Calculation of pN/pS in single genes

456

While comparing SNP patterns across samples, it is instrumental to avoid biases due to

457

differences in coverage. We therefore downsampled the read coverage depth to the minimum

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/790345; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

458

depth across all samples, for each position in a sample that was supported by more than 4 reads.

459

For positions that had minimum support of fewer than 4 reads, no subsampling was performed.

460

Subsampling was performed by drawing from a multinomial distribution, with n trials and variant

461

probabilities p, where n was set to the calculated minimum depth and p set to the relative

462

abundance of each variant in the given sample.

463

The expected ratio of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions was calculated by

464

considering all called SNPs in every gene. First, we calculate a consensus sequence for each

465

gene by taking, for each SNP position, the variant that was overall more common across all

466

samples (after the subsampling performed above). We counted, for each gene, the number of

467

non-synonymous and synonymous sites across the consensus sequence. For each SNP position

468

in each sample, we counted the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. As

469

more than one variant can exist in a single sample, we considered the relative abundance of

470

synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions dictated by the different variants. For example, if

471

the reference codon was CAC, coding for histidine, one variant, a C-to-G transversion in the third

472

position abundant at 50%, led to a nonsynonymous mutation that resulted in glutamine (CAG)

473

while another variant in the same sample and the same position was a synonymous C-to-T

474

transition, we counted 0.5 synonymous substitutions and 0.5 nonsynonymous substitutions. We

475

followed by calculating the pN/pS ratio:

476

𝑝𝑁/𝑝𝑆 =

𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
/
𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠
𝑠𝑦𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑦𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑠

477

pN/pS characterizes selective constraints at the population level, as opposed to dN/dS that

478

characterizes it between individual species 12 and can thus be standardized to a specific time

479

interval and used as an absolute metric. Nonetheless, dN/dS ratios are not applicable in our

480

study since polymorphic sites derived from short read sequencing impede having haplotypes

481

which are a prerequisite for calculating dN/dS.

483

Aggregation of calculated metrics using KEGG and eggNOG orthologies

484

Functional assignments to KEGG KOs and eggNOG OGs for all OM-RGC genes were computed

485

using eggNOG-mapper v2 based on the eggNOG v5.0 database41,45. For each functional

486

assignment in each sample, all OM-RGC genes assigned with the same functional assignment

487

were concatenated and treated as one long genomic sequence per the calculation of pN/pS ratios.

488

To reduce noise in pN/pS calculation, we considered only KOs and OGs that had at least 5 genes

489

per sample, in at least 50 samples.

490
491

Environmental variables

492

For each sample, we compiled measurements pertaining to the following environmental

493

measurements: Depth [m], Nitrate [μmol/kg], Nitrite [μmol/kg], Oxygen [μmol/kg], Phosphate

494

[μmol/kg], Silicate [μmol/kg], Temperature [C] and Salinity.

495

Tara oceans metadata was downloaded from PANGAEA (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/) with

496

accession numbers PANGAEA.875575 (Nutrients) and PANGAEA.875576 (Watercolumn

497

sensor), and recorded median values for all the above nutrients were extracted. Tara nutrient

498

concentrations were given as [μmol/l]. Conversion to [μmol/kg] was done by dividing the

499

measured concentration by the measured specific gravity for the same sample.

500

bioGEOTRACES metadata was compiled from CTD sensor data and discrete sample data from

501

the GEOTRACES intermediate data product v.246. HOT metadata was downloaded from the ftp

502

server of the University of Hawai’i at Manoa (ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/) and BATS metadata

503

was downloaded from the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (http://bats.bios.edu/bats-data/).

As GEOTRACES/HOT/BATS ocean water samples are not linked to specific biological samples

505

as is the case with Tara oceans samples, we considered only water samples from the exact same

all these measurements of environmental conditions are highly correlated with each other (Fig.

Using expression data from 4,092 KEGG KOs collected by Kolody et al.

555

genes in our marine samples in the following way. We first represent the expression data in

556

relative abundance space (normalize each sample by its read counts). Next, for each KO 𝑖, where

557

𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝐼} , we sum across different instances of this focal KO. The input is an 𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix,

558

where 𝑚 is the number of different instances of focal KO 𝑖, and 𝑛 is the number of samples. The

559

output is a vector of length 𝑛: (𝑥* , . . . , 𝑥8 ). Finally, we average the expression levels

560

(𝑥* , . . . , 𝑥8 ) across samples:8 ∑8- 9 * 𝑥- and rank the KOs based on the calculated average

561

expression. Notably, we limited the scope of our analysis to samples collected only in small

562

fraction filters (0.22 𝜇𝑚).

16

, we ranked the KO

Determination of Synechococcus-specific pN/pS rates

565

We identified genes from the OM-RGC database belonging exclusively to genus Synechococcus

566

using eggNOG-mapper. We filtered out genes that were present in fewer than 20% of all samples.

567

For each of the samples, we calculated pN/pS on all gene sequences combined. We further

568

divided the samples into five identically sized groups, based on environmental nitrate

569

concentrations, and for each group filtered out genes that were present in fewer than 50% of all

570

samples in the group. We next calculated pN/pS on all the gene sequences that remained in each

571

of the groups.

Determination of extracellular genes

574

To determine extracellular gene groups, we searched the eggNOG v.5 OG database for the words

575

‘secreted’ or both words ‘extracellular’ and ‘protein’ in their description. We demanded that the

576

words ‘autoinducer’, ‘expression’, ‘role’ and ‘hypothetical’ are not in the description to prevent

577

instances where (a) the OG in question describes a hypothetical protein; and (b) where the OG

578

produces a secreted particle but is not secreted by itself, as is the case with autoinducer producing

579

genes. To ensure robust pN/pS calculations, descriptions encompassing 10 OGs or more were

580

assigned a group name, while descriptions encompassing less than 10 OGs were all grouped

581

together in one group.

582

Calculation of mutation flux in divergent nitrate concentrations

584

We created matrix 𝐻(;) as follows: Consider a set 𝑈 of all genes for which SNP measurements

585

exist and a subset 𝑇 ⊆ 𝑈 of this set across 𝐾samples. Let 𝐺 (5)- = (𝑉, 𝐸) be a codon graph for

586

subset 𝑇 and sample 𝑗, where 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 is a codon (e.g., CUU coding for Alanine) and (𝑣, 𝑣′) ∈ 𝐸 if

587

and only if 𝑣 and 𝑣′ are one mutation apart (e.g., CUU for Alanine and CAU for Histidine). Let

588

590

where 𝐻(5) ($,$&),- = 𝑤 (5)- (𝑣, 𝑣′).

591

We next sum-normalized H per each sample and compared the codon mutation frequencies

592

between the 40 lowest- and 40 highest-nitrate samples. Despite significant differences in codon

593

mutation frequencies between low-nitrate and high-nitrate samples, some of the difference could

594

be driven by the simplex properties of the sum-normalized codon mutation frequencies, and some

595

could be attributed to the different rates of synonymous mutations between the high- and low-

596

nitrate groups, which, combined with simplex properties, may affect observed nonsynonymous

597

mutation rates. To address simplex properties, we employed a centered log-ratio (CLR)

598

normalization on H. The CLR transformation is a mapping, per codon composition, from the

599

simplex to a Euclidean vector subspace. This log transforms each value and then centers them

600

around zero as given below:

𝑔(𝑣)
𝑔(𝑣)

601

𝐶𝐿𝑅(𝑉) = [𝑙𝑜𝑔

602

where g(v) is the geometric mean of all of the codons.

603

To address differences in rates of the different types of mutations, for each mutation (𝑣, 𝑣′) in

604

the CLR normalized matrix 𝐻′(;) we calculated the log odds ratio between the mutation and its

605

reverse mutation. Namely, we computed mutation flux matrix 𝐹 (;) where 𝐹 (;) ($,$&),- =

606

𝐻(;) ($,$&),- − 𝐻(;) ($&,$),- . We compared differences in codon mutation flux between low- and high

607

nitrate samples using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Calculation of expected random mutation cost per genetic code

610

Let 𝑉be a genetic code with a set 𝑉D ⊂ 𝑉of stop codons. Let 𝑃(𝑣) be the abundance of codon

611

𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 in a sample and P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)) the probability of a single mutation from codon 𝑣 to 𝑣′. Let

612

𝑐" : 𝑉 × 𝑉 → 𝒁 be a cost function for element 𝑒, where:

613
614
615
616

617

𝑐" (𝑣, 𝑣′) = # 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑣′ − # 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑣

With these notations, we define the expected cost of genetic code 𝑉 for element 𝑒 as follows:

𝐸[𝐶" (𝑉)] = 2 𝑃(𝑣)𝑃(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′))𝑐" (𝑣, 𝑣′)
$,$&∈(

618

And the ERMC cost as:

𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶" (𝑉) = 2 𝑃(𝑣)P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′))𝑐 #

619

" (𝑣, 𝑣′)

$,$&∈(

620

Where
𝑐 # " = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝑐" )

621
622
623
624

We estimate 𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶" (𝑉) as follows:
1. We define 𝑃(𝑣) as the median abundance of all codons𝑣′coding for the same amino acid
as 𝑣.

625

2. We wished to calculate mutation rates in sites that were under minimal selection. To this

626

end, we estimated P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)) by calculating, from fourfold-degenerate synonymous

627

mutation sites the average abundance of each single nucleotide mutation (e.g. A to C)

628

across all genes in which there are called SNPs in all ocean samples, excluding stop

629

codons. We then estimate P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′))using the relative abundances of all pairs of single

630

nucleotide mutations. We estimate P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)) for Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus

631

and Human genomes using published transition:transversion rates5,48.

632

3. We calculate c using information on the amino acids which each codon codes for.

633

To compute a p-value, we generate a null distribution by calculating 𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶" (𝑉) for alternative

634

genetic codes. We randomize the first and second position of all codons, while maintaining that

635

the two sets of first and second positions in which the stop codons reside are separated by a

636

single transition mutation.

637

Confounding effects between cost functions for the structure of the genetic code

638

To confirm that our elemental cost function is not confounded by traditional properties of amino

639

acids such as the polar requirement (PR) and hydropathy index33–36, we calculated the expected

640

random mutation cost (ERMC), per genetic code, using these common cost functions across 1

641

million simulated alternative codes. To this end, we randomized the first and second position of

642

all codons, while maintaining that the two sets of first and second positions in which the stop

643

codons reside are separated by a single transition mutation. We next calculated a contingency

644

table for each pair of cost functions for both nitrogen and carbon (i.e., 𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶= (𝑉):𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶MN (𝑉),

645

𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶= (𝑉):𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶KLF?@GCBKL (𝑉), (𝑉):𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶MN (𝑉), 𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶O (𝑉):𝐸𝑅𝑀𝐶KLF?@GCBKL (𝑉)). We assign

646

each code to one of four bins in the following way: (1) surpassing the standard genetic code in

647

both cost functions (e.g., nitrogen and PR), (2) surpassing the standard genetic code only in

648

element 𝑒 cost (e.g. only nitrogen), (3) surpassing the standard genetic code only in the traditional

649

cost function (e.g., PR), (4) not surpassing the standard genetic code in neither. Finally, we

650

applied the Chi-square test of independence with two degrees of freedom to each contingency

651

table.

652
653

Determination of ‘square’ and ‘diagonal’ arrangements of the nitrogen genetic code

654

We define a ‘square’ arrangement of the codons coding for nitrogen-rich amino acids histidine,

655

glutamine, asparagine, lysine and arginine as one where their codons span only two nucleotides

656

in the first position and two nucleotides in the second position. In the standard genetic code, these

657

amino acids are coded by CAN, CGN, AAN, AGR, following a square configuration. In contrast,

658

a ‘diagonal’ arrangement of the codons coding for these amino acids is one where they span all

659

possible nucleotides in the first position and all possible nucleotides in the second position. For

660

example, a genetic code where TTY codes for histidine, TTR for glutamine, CCN and AAR for

661

arginine, GGY for asparagine and GGR for lysine constitutes a ‘diagonal’ arrangement of nitrogen

662

amino acids. In each of the alternative genetic codes we generated, we tested whether either of

663

these conditions hold and, if so, designated the code as ‘square’ or ‘diagonal’ accordingly.

665

Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genomic data and mutation rates

666

We downloaded Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus protein-coding gene sequences (where

667

available) from the Joint Genome Institute (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/) following

668

accession numbers published by Berube et al. 5. To estimate codon relative abundance 𝑃(𝑣), we

669

counted and sum-normalized codons in all protein-coding genes for each species. To estimate

670

codon mutation rate 𝑃 (𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)) we used the published transition:transversion rate of 2:1 for

671

Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus 37.

672
673

Multiple taxa ERMC calculation

674

To calculate ERMC for 39 taxa across multiple transition:transversion rates, we downloaded

675

codon usage and GC-content data collected by Athey et al.49. We used codon usage counts to

676

estimate 𝑃(𝑣)and 11 transition:transversion rates (1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 2:3, 1:1, 3:2, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1,

677

5:1) to estimate P(𝑚𝑢𝑡(𝑣, 𝑣′)).

Figure S5. (A-C) Histograms of the distribution of P-values of codon-to-codon mutations compared

813

between (A) 40 low-nitrate samples and 40 other low-nitrate samples selected randomly out of the 80

814

lowest-nitrate samples; (B) 40 high-nitrate samples and 40 other high-nitrate samples selected

815

randomly out of the 80 highest-nitrate samples; (C) 40 low-nitrate samples and 40 high-nitrate samples

816

selected randomly out of the 80 lowest and highest nitrate samples. (D) Depiction of mutations

817

common in high versus low environmental nitrate concentrations. Two edged arrows mark amino-

818

acids in which some codon mutations were more common in high-nitrate but the opposite codon

819

mutation was more common in low-nitrate.

standard genetic code for nitrogen (blue), carbon (black) and both (purple) across a wide range of

829

transition:transversion rates, calculated using combined codon abundance of 187 Prochlorococcus

830

Table S1. Contingency tables for each pair of cost functions for both nitrogen (n+) and carbon (c+),

835

compared to PR (pr) and Hydropathy index (hyd), across 1 million simulated genetic codes. Each code

836

is assigned to one of four bins: (1) surpassing the standard genetic code in both cost functions (<; <),

837

(2) surpassing the standard genetic code only in element e cost (<; >=), (3) surpassing the standard

838

genetic code only in the traditional cost function (>=; <), (4) not surpassing the standard genetic code

839

in neither (>=; >=). Chi-square test of independence was applied to each contingency table.
