Abstract

2

In metazoan germlines, the piRNA pathway acts as a genomic immune system, employing

3

small-RNA-mediated silencing to defend host DNA from the harmful effects of transposable

4

elements (TEs). In response to dynamic changes in TE content, host genomes are proposed to

5

alter the piRNAs that they produce in order to silence the most active TE families. Surprisingly,

6

however, piRNA pathway proteins, which execute piRNA biogenesis and enforce silencing of

7

targeted sequences, also evolve rapidly and adaptively in animals. If TE silencing evolves

8

through changes in piRNAs, what necessitates changes in piRNA pathway proteins? Here we

9

used interspecific complementation to test for functional differences between Drosophila

10

melanogaster and D. simulans alleles of three adaptively evolving piRNA pathway proteins:

11

Armitage, Aubergine and Spindle-E. Surprisingly, we found very few differences in TE transcript

12

levels, but global effects on piRNA biogenesis, particularly for Armitage. Adaptive divergence in

13

piRNA biogenesis in the absence of clear downstream effects on TE targets reveals a surprising

14

degree of robustness that suggests that piRNA-mediated silencing is an “all-or-nothing”

15

threshold trait. These results lead us to propose that the feature of importance for adaptation is

16

piRNA production rather than piRNA abundance, and we further suggest that piRNA biogenesis

17

evolves rapidly to establish control over invader and escaper TEs or in response to TE

18

antagonism. We also discovered that D. simulans alleles exhibit enhanced off-target effects on

19

host transcripts in a D. melanogaster background, suggesting the avoidance of genomic auto-

20

immunity as an additional target of selection. Taken together, we propose that piRNA effector

21

proteins are subject to an evolutionary trade-off between defending the host genome from the

22

harmful effect of TEs while also minimizing friendly-fire against host genes.

Introduction

2

Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous mobile genetic entities, whose unrestricted

3

propagation can cause deleterious insertional mutations and chromosome rearrangements, and

4

is often associated with cancer and sterility [1–4]. TE regulation is therefore essential, especially

5

in germline cells, where TE insertions and associated mutations can be transmitted to the next

6

generation. In metazoan germlines, regulation of TE transcripts is enacted by a small RNA

7

silencing pathway, the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway (piRNA pathway), in which piRNAs

8

complexed with PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins target complementary TEs for post-

9

transcriptional and transcriptional silencing [5].

10

Host genomes are often parasitized by multiple TE families, which change rapidly in their

11

presence and abundance [6–9]. The control of TE transcripts by complementary piRNAs may

12

facilitate adaptation to genomic TEs through changes in piRNA species [10,11]. Surprisingly,

13

however, protein components of the piRNA pathway that enact piRNA biogenesis and enforce

14

TE silencing also evolve adaptively in diverse metazoan lineages [12–16]. Evidence for adaptive

15

evolution of piRNA pathway proteins is particularly strong in Drosophila [12–15,17], which has

16

also emerged as a work horse for uncovering the mechanisms of piRNA-mediated silencing

17

[reviewed in 18]. For example, a recent meta analysis including both D. melanogaster and D.

18

pseudoobscura revealed that 22 of 26 piRNA pathway proteins exhibit significant signatures of

19

adaptive protein evolution in one or both species [14].

20

Adaptive evolution of piRNA effector proteins is proposed to arise from an evolutionary

21

arms race between TEs and host silencing machinery [reviewed in 19]. In the simplest scenario,

22

effector proteins evolve adaptively in order to restore silencing of newly invading or escaper TE

23

families. Alternatively, if TEs “fight back” by encoding RNA or protein antagonists of host

24

silencing machinery, piRNA pathway proteins could evolve adaptively to escape TE antagonism

25

[20]. Finally, a third non-mutually exclusive model proposes that piRNA proteins evolve

26

adaptively to avoid “genomic auto-immunity” in the form of off-target silencing of host genes

1

[19,21]. Uncovering which of these selective forces drives the adaptive evolution of piRNA

2

effector proteins requires elucidating the resulting functional consequences of piRNA-effector-

3

protein divergence. For example, adaptive evolution in the piRNA-mediated transcriptional

4

silencer rhino along the lineage leading to D. simulans alters the interaction between Rhino

5

protein and its cofactor Deadlock [20]. The authors propose that this functional change in Rhino

6

reflects evolutionary escape from a TE encoded antagonist, which mimics Deadlock binding to

7

Rhino.

8

Here, we broaden our understanding of the functional consequences of adaptive

9

evolution among Drosophila piRNA effector proteins by examining three essential piRNA

10

pathway components, Armitage (Armi), Aubergine (Aub) and Spindle-E (SpnE); this work

11

significantly extends a preliminary analysis of Aub divergence [22]. All three proteins exhibit

12

adaptive evolution along the lineage leading to D. melanogaster, D. simulans or both [13,15].

13

These three proteins play critical and diverse roles in piRNA biogenesis and TE silencing. Aub

14

is a Piwi-clade Argonaute protein which, guided by piRNAs, enacts post-transcriptional silencing

15

of TE-derived mRNAs [23]. Aub cleavage of TE-derived mRNAs also feeds forward the ping-

16

pong amplification cycle, a core mechanism for the production of both sense and antisense

17

piRNAs from complementary precursors [24–26]. SpnE also contributes to ping-pong

18

biogenesis by promoting the localization of Aub into the perinuclear nuage, where ping-pong

19

occurs [27]. Distinct from both Aub and SpnE, Armi binds to antisense piRNA precursors to

20

facilitate their sequential cleavage by the nuclease Zucchini in an alternate biogenesis

21

mechanism referred to as “phasing” [28–31]. In contrast to ping-pong derived piRNAs, phased

22

piRNAs play a major role in transcriptional silencing of TE insertions [32].

23

To isolate diverged functions of adaptive evolving proteins, we performed interspecific

24

complementation, in which we compared the ability of D. melanogaster and D. simulans wild-

25

type alleles to complement a D. melanogaster mutant background. We observe that the most

26

dramatic functional differences between alleles impact their roles in piRNA biogenesis, revealing

1

a potential nexus of adaptive protein evolution. Furthermore, we observe that the piRNA losses

2

associated with D. simulans alleles, which are particularly pronounced for Armi, are not

3

associated with downstream changes in TE transcripts. The absence of effects on TE regulation

4

suggests that TE transcript abundance is not the primary target of selection on these adaptively

5

evolving piRNA proteins, and further reveals unexpected robustness in piRNA-mediated

6

silencing. Finally, we reveal that D. simulans alleles exhibit enhanced off-target effects on the

7

expression of host transcripts in a D. melanogaster background, suggesting the avoidance of

8

genomic auto-immunity as an additional target of selection.

Results

11

Identifying functional divergence through interspecific complementation.

12

To isolate functional differences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans alleles that result

13

from adaptive evolution, we employed interspecific complementation, in which we compared the

14

ability of D. melanogaster and D. simulans wild-type alleles to complement a D. melanogaster

15

mutant background. For each selected piRNA protein, we generated and compared three

16

genotypes: 1) a trans-heterozygous loss-of-function mutant, 2) a mutant with a D. melanogaster

17

genomic transgene rescue, and 3) a mutant with a D. simulans genomic transgene rescue

18

(Figure S1). The transgenes include the complete genomic region from either D. melanogaster

19

or D. simulans including upstream and downstream sequences containing potential cis-

20

regulatory elements. Furthermore, transgenes were inserted into matched attP sites by ΦC31

21

integrase [33], in order to avoid position effects. Phenotypes for which the D. simulans alleles

22

fail to fully complement the mutant, or otherwise differ between the alleles of the two species,

23

point to diverged functions that are potential targets of adaptive evolution.

24

We first considered the effect of transgenic rescue on female fertility. Homozygosity or

25

trans-heterozygosity for loss of function alleles in all three genes causes complete female

26

sterility (Figure S2A) [34]. For all three proteins, fertility is restored by transgenic rescues from

the two species to different degrees, with D. melanogaster transgenes conferring higher fertility

2

than their D. simulans counterparts (Figure S2A) [22]. Because D. simulans transgenes do not

3

exhibit significantly reduced expression when compared to D. melanogaster (Figure S2B), these

4

fertility effects most likely reflect amino acid sequence divergence in the encoded proteins.

Reduced piRNA abundance with D. simulans alleles.

7

To uncover molecular phenotypes that relate to fertility differences, we first examined whether

8

D. melanogaster and D. simulans alleles differed with respect to piRNA production using small-

9

RNA seq. piRNA pathway mutants cause a dramatic decrease in piRNA abundance for the

10

majority of TE families when compared to the transgenic rescue by D. melanogaster alleles,

11

consistent with their critical functions in piRNA biogenesis (Figure 1) [25,35–37]. While not as

12

dramatic as the mutant, D. simulans armi showed a similar systematic reduction in TE-derived

13

piRNA abundance, with 116 of 126 TE families exhibiting fewer piRNAs when compared to D.

14

melanogaster (Figure 1). Drosophila simulans armi therefore has diverged considerably from D.

15

melanogaster with respect to piRNA biogenesis. By contrast, D. simulans aub and spn-E alleles

16

have isolated effects on individual TE families. Drosophila simulans aub modestly reduces

17

piRNA biogenesis, with 12 out of 14 significantly affected TE families exhibiting reduced piRNA

18

abundance when compared to D. melanogaster (Figure 1). By contrast, for spnE, we observed

19

more idiosyncratic differences, with a similar number of TE families exhibiting increased piRNA

20

abundance in the presence of the D. simulans allele (21 TE families) as the D. melanogaster

21

allele (25 TE families, Figure 1). Importantly, we did not observe any systematic differences in

22

expression for germline or soma-specific protein-coding genes between the transgenic rescues,

23

indicating changes in piRNA abundance do not reflect a change in the germline-to-soma ratio

24

(Figure S2B).

1

To detect underlying mechanisms that could explain differences in piRNA abundance, we

2

examined molecular signatures of the two major mechanisms of piRNA biogenesis in our small

3

RNA libraries: ping-pong and phasing. The frequency of ping-pong amplification was estimated

4

by the fraction of piRNAs occuring on opposite strands of the TE consensus whose sequences

5

overlap by 10 bp, a reflection of the cleavage-site preference of the key factors of ping-pong

6

cycle, Aub and Argonaute-3 (Ago-3, Figure 2A-D) [23,24,26]. Similarly, phasing biogenesis was

7

detected from the fraction of piRNAs whose 3’ ends are immediately followed by a Uracil

8

residue (+1-U), as well as the frequency of piRNAs from the same strand that are separated by

9

a single nucleotide (d1), both of which are diagnostic of cleavage by the nuclease Zucchini

10

(Figure 2E-G) [28,29]. In general, ping-pong and phasing are inversely correlated in mutant

11

piRNA pools, because reducing the frequency of one leads to a proportional increase in the

12

other [28,29].

13

Aub plays a direct role in ping-pong amplification by cleaving piRNA precursors (Figure

14

2A) [23,24,26], and spnE is required for the localization of Aub into the perinuclear nuage,

15

where ping-pong occurs [27]. Mutations in either gene therefore cause a complete collapse of

16

ping-pong amplification (Figure 2B, Figure S3A and S3B) [25,26]. Both D. melanogaster and D.

17

simulans aub and spnE alleles exhibited a dramatic increase in the ping-pong fraction,

18

indicating a conserved role in ping-pong biogenesis (Figure 2B). However in the case of aub,

19

ping-pong fractions associated with the D. simulans transgenic rescue were modestly yet

20

significantly lower than D. melanogaster, and there was a corresponding proportional increase

21

in phased piRNA biogenesis (Figure 2F and 2G, Figure S4). This reduced efficiency in ping-

22

pong biogenesis mirrors the modest reduction in piRNA abundance we observed for this allele,

23

with 11 out of 12 TEs whose piRNA abundance is reduced by D. simulans aub allele (Figure 1)

24

showing decreased ping-pong fraction. By contrast, D. simulans spnE alleles do not reduce

25

ping-pong (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the absence of a systematic loss of the D.

26

simulans allele on piRNA production (Figure 1). Interestingly however, there was a modest but

1

significant increase in the d1 proportion with the D. simulans spnE rescue (Figure 2F),

2

potentially suggesting increased phasing.

3

Armi promotes the production of phased piRNAs by binding to antisense piRNA

4

intermediates and facilitating their cleavage by the nuclease Zucchini (Figure 2E) [28,29,38].

5

Both d1 and +1-U are therefore significantly reduced in armi mutants (Figure 2F and 2G, Figure

6

S4). While Armi is not involved in ping-pong, phasing produces Aub-bound antisense piRNAs,

7

which are required for ping-pong biogenesis for some TE families [26,39]. Ping-pong fractions

8

are therefore decreased in armi mutants for some TE families (Figure 2C and 2D, Figure S3C).

9

By contrast, for TE families that do not rely on phased piRNA production for ping-pong, ping-

10

pong-derived piRNAs proportionally increase in armi mutants, owing to the loss of phased

11

piRNAs (Figure 2C and 2D, Figure S3C). Consistent with reduced piRNA production (Figure 1),

12

the D. simulans armi rescue exhibited modestly but significantly reduced d1 and +1-U

13

proportion, indicating reduced phasing (Figure 2F and 2G, Figure S4). However, the more

14

dramatic and statistically significant allelic effect is on ping-pong biogenesis, which is reduced

15

for most TE families by the D. simulans armi rescue when compared to D. melanogaster (Figure

16

2C and 2D, Figure S3C). Importantly, this reduction occurs regardless of whether armi function

17

enhances or represses ping-pong biogenesis, revealing a global inhibitory effect imposed by D.

piRNA biogenesis defects do not cause TE derepression.

18

Ultimately, the piRNA pathway represses the production of TE-derived mRNAs (reviewed in

19

[18]). Enhanced negative regulation of TEs is therefore an obvious target of positive selection

20

acting on piRNA pathway proteins. Furthermore, given the reduced abundance of TE-derived

21

piRNAs in the D. simulans armi rescue, deregulation is expected among targeted TEs. We

22

therefore compared TE transcript abundance between mutants and transgenic rescues using

23

mRNA-seq (aub) and stranded total-RNA seq (spnE and armi).

24

For all three mutants, D. melanogaster transgenic rescues reduce transcript abundance

25

for almost all TE families when compared to the corresponding mutant (Figure 3). Furthermore,

1

in all three cases, even though there are idiosyncratic differences in the expression of individual

2

TE families, the majority of TEs are not differentially expressed between the transgenic rescues

3

(Figure 3, Figure S5). This observation is particularly unexpected for armi, where defects of the

4

D. simulans allele in ping-pong and phasing biogenesis leads to a systematic loss of piRNAs

5

targeting the majority of TE families (Figure 1, 2C, 2D, 2F and 2G). Furthermore, the majority of

6

TE families that are differentially expressed between the two transgenic rescues did not exhibit

7

an associated difference in piRNA abundance (36 of 38 cases among all three genes, Figure

8

S5). Interspecific differences in TE regulation, therefore, are unrelated to differences in piRNA

9

production.

10

We further explored the overall quantitative relationship between TE transcript levels and

11

piRNA abundance. When aub and spnE mutants are compared to transgenic rescues, the

12

dramatic reduction of antisense piRNAs is associated with increased TE transcript abundance

13

(Figure 4A). Strikingly, however, we observed no correlated changes between piRNA and

14

mRNA pools for aub or spnE when the two transgenic rescues are compared to each other,

15

suggesting the magnitude of changes in piRNA abundance are not sufficient to impact

16

downstream targets (Figure 4A). armi mutants exhibit a distinct relationship between piRNA

17

losses and TE transcripts, in which increased antisense TE transcript abundance is associated

18

with minimal losses of antisense piRNAs (Figure 4B). This counterintuitive positive relationship

19

between mRNA and piRNA pools likely reflects enhanced ping-pong biogenesis of

20

bidirectionally transcribed TEs in armi mutants (Figure 4B). Nevertheless, comparisons between

21

the two armi transgenic rescues again do not reveal any connections between changes in TE-

22

derived piRNAs and mRNAs. Therefore, modest changes in piRNA production associated with

23

different transgenes do not translate to altered TE transcription, revealing a hidden robustness

24

to piRNA-mediated regulation.

Increased off-target effects of D. simulans alleles suggest genomic auto-immunity.

10

Avoidance of genomic auto-immunity syndrome is an alternative, non-TE centered hypothesis to

11

explain the adaptive evolution of piRNA pathway proteins [19,21]. Under this model, piRNA

12

pathway proteins experience selection to minimize their off-target effects on protein-coding

13

genes, which would reduce host fitness. Selection to avoid genomic auto-immunity therefore

14

predicts a greater number of off-target effects with the D. simulans rescues, which are not

15

adapted to the D. melanogaster background. To test this prediction, we identified protein-coding

16

genes that are negatively regulated by piRNA pathway proteins by comparing their expression

17

levels between mutants and transgenic rescues. Protein-coding genes whose expression is

18

significantly reduced in transgenic rescues (>1.5 fold) are candidate off-target effects of piRNA-

19

mediated silencing. For all three genes, we observed more protein-coding genes whose

20

expression is reduced by the D. simulans rescue than the D. melanogaster rescue, although the

21

difference is significant only for aub and armi (Figure 5A). The majority of protein-coding genes

22

that are negatively regulated by D. melanogaster rescues are also repressed by D. simulans

23

rescues, suggesting a shared impact on the expression of many protein-coding genes (Figure

24

5B). Together, these observations suggest that D. simulans alleles have enhanced impacts on

25

protein-coding genes, consistent with off-target effects.

1

Increased off-target effects of D. simulans alleles on protein-coding genes could be

2

explained by increased production of genic piRNAs, or more efficient silencing of target mRNAs.

3

To differentiate between these alternatives, we compared genic piRNAs between transgenic

4

rescues. Surprisingly, D. simulans transgenic rescues of aub and armi exhibited fewer protein-

5

Discussion

2

Despite pervasive adaptive evolution and gene duplication among piRNA pathway proteins in

3

both insect and vertebrate lineages [12–15,40,41], the underlying forces that drive these

4

evolutionary dynamics remain unclear. By performing interspecific complementation on three

5

adaptively evolving piRNA pathway genes, we revealed diverged functions that may have arisen

6

through positive selection. Our discovery of reduced piRNA biogenesis associated with D.

7

simulans aub and armi alleles implicates piRNA production as a nexus of adaptive evolution.

8

Furthermore, because piRNA losses associated with D. simulans alleles do not result in

9

downstream transcriptional derepression of target TEs, our observations do not support TE

10

transcript abundance as a major target of positive selection. Additionally, for both aub and armi,

11

we observed that D. simulans alleles are associated with enhanced off-target effects on host

12

gene transcripts, supporting genomic auto-immunity as a second driver of adaptive evolution.

13

Taken together, our data suggest that positive selection acts at multiple molecular and

14

functional interfaces within the piRNA pathway.

15

piRNAs direct TE silencing, and the loss of specific piRNAs in many mutant

16

backgrounds is associated with a corresponding increase in target TE transcripts (Figure 4A)

17

[25,35]. However, we discovered that reduced piRNA production associated with D. simulans

18

alleles does not cause derepression of the corresponding target TEs (Figure 1, 3, and 4). While

19

we cannot rule out the possibility that derepression occurs but is not detected by RNA-seq in

20

whole ovaries because it happens at a particular stage of oogenesis [42], our observations

21

suggest that piRNA-mediated silencing is a threshold trait: once sufficient piRNAs are produced

22

to target a particular TE family, additional piRNAs do not increase the strength of silencing.

23

Indeed, threshold effects have been observed in piRNA-mediated silencing of reporter genes

24

[43], and in the “all-or-nothing” accumulation of Rhino—an effector of transcriptional silencing—

25

at piRNA-target loci [44]. Threshold effects are further supported by the lack of correlation

26

between piRNA abundance and transposition rate among active TE families in D. melanogaster,

1

suggesting that there is no selection for increased piRNA production once silencing is

2

established [45].

3

What are the evolutionary implications of this model of threshold effects? Threshold

4

effects may explain why we observed more dramatic allelic differences affecting piRNA

5

biogenesis compared to TE transcript levels. If silencing is determined by a critical mass of

6

piRNAs, then establishing silencing over invading or escaper TEs, or escaping from TE-

7

encoded antagonists, will be arbitrated at the level of piRNA production. piRNA biogenesis is

8

therefore expected to evolve adaptively. While it may seem counterintuitive that we did not

9

observe any incompatibilities between D. simulans alleles and D. melangoaster TEs, in which

10

insufficient piRNAs are produced to enact silencing, it must be considered that D. simulans and

11

D. melanogaster alleles are largely coevolving with the same TE families as a consequence of

12

the frequent horizontal transfer of TEs between these two species [46–49]. Therefore, the

13

incompatibilities that emerge between species are expected to occur between components of

14

the piRNA biogenesis machinery that have evolved independently in each lineage, rather than

15

between piRNA machinery and target TEs.

16

The armi phenotype we discovered is particularly intriguing, where the D. simulans allele

17

is characterized by reduced ping-pong and phasing biogenesis when compared to D.

18

melanogaster, leading to a systematic loss of piRNAs (Figure 1, 2C, 2D, 2F and 2G). This is

19

distinct from the phenotype of armi mutants, in which phasing is lost for all TE families (Figure

20

2F and 2G), but ping-pong is affected in a TE-dependent manner (Figure 2C and 2D, Figure

21

S3C) [26,39]. We propose that reduced ping-pong and phasing by D. simulans Armi is

22

potentially explained by enhanced interactions with Ago-3 and Aub during the transfer of piRNA

23

precursors from ping-pong to phasing sites [50,51]. Increased stability of Armi-Aub or Armi-Ago-

24

3 complexes would reduce the availability of Aub/Ago-3 for ping-pong biogenesis, while

25

concurrently reducing the availability of Armi for phasing biogenesis (Figure 6). Enhanced

26

affinity could have evolved if, for example, D. simulans Armi competes with a TE antagonist for

binding to Aub or Ago-3. Escape from TE-encoded antagonist proteins was recently proposed

2

as the evolutionary mechanism responsible for an incompatibility between D. simulans Rhino

3

and D. melanogaster Deadlock [20,52], two components of a complex that promotes piRNA

cluster transcription [53,54].

proteins, Aub and Ago-3, allowing for normal piRNA production. (B) Incompatibility of D. simulans Armi

in a D. melanogaster genetic background results in an aberrantly higher affinity to those ping-pong

10

factor proteins, which isolates Armi and those ping-pong factors from phasing and ping-pong biogenesis,

11

respectively, interfering with normal piRNA biogenesis.

12
13

Because piRNAs have the potential to affect any transcript including those of the host,

14

avoidance of off-target effects on host gene expression is proposed as an alternative driver of

15

adaptive evolution among piRNA pathway proteins [19,21]. This genomic auto-immunity model

1

is supported by the observation that species with a greater TE burden have longer piRNAs that

2

favor specificity over sensitivity [19,21]. In our study, we provide direct evidence of interspecific

3

divergence in genomic auto-immunity at the protein level, with D. simulans alleles of both aub

4

and armi exhibiting enhanced repression of host genes when compared to their D.

5

melanogaster counterparts (Figure 5).

6

Taken together, our study points to multiple diverging functions and unexpected

7

complexity in the molecular adaptation of piRNA pathway proteins. In particular, Aub and Armi

8

appear to have diverged functionally between D. melanogaster and D. simulans with respect to

9

both piRNA biogenesis and their off-target effects on host genes. These findings point to a

10

picture in which the piRNA proteins are pulled in two directions: to maintain their potency in an

11

evolutionary arms race with TEs, but also to minimize friendly-fire by differentiating between

12

self-and non-self when enacting genome defense.

Female fertility

2

25-35 individual virgin females of each experimental genotype were crossed to two ywF10

3

males on standard cornmeal media at 25oC. Fresh media and new males were provided every 5

4

days. The number of progeny from each 5-day period was quantified.

Small RNA-Seq

7

3-6-day old female ovaries were dissected from each experimental genotype and placed directly

8

in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and homogenized. For aub genotypes, Illumina small RNA

9

libraries were prepared by Fasteris according to a proprietary protocol that depletes for 2S-RNA.

10

Because two biological replicates prepared at different time points (5/13 and 7/13), they are

11

analyzed separately. Small RNA libraries for spnE and armi genotypes were prepared as

12

described in [58]. In brief, total RNAs were extracted according to the manufacturer’s

13

instructions, and size fractionated on a 12% polyacrylamide/urea gel to select for 18-30 nt small

14

RNAs. Small RNAs were treated with 2S Block oligo (5’-TAC AAC CCT CAA CCA TAT GTA

15

GTC CAA GCA/3SpC3/-3’), and were subsequently ligated to 3’ and 5’ adaptors, reverse

16

transcribed and PCR amplified using NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for

17

Illumina. Small RNA libraries were further purified from a 2% agarose gel and sequenced on a

Illumina NextSeq 500 at the University of Houston Seq-N-Edit Core.

RNA-seq libraries for the studies of aub were generated by Weill Cornell Epigenomics Core

manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated mRNAs were further fragmented using fragmentation

and random hexamer primers. Second-strand synthesis was performed using DNA polymerase

PCR amplified, and gel purified again to make libraries.

5

RNA-seq libraries for the studies of spnE and armi were prepared by using TruSeq

6

Stranded Total RNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina. 50 bp reads from each library were

7

sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Aub and SpnE) and a HiSeq 2500 (Armi) by the Weill-Cornell

Bioinformatic analysis of small RNA-Seq libraries

11

3’ Illumina adaptors were removed from sequencing reads by Cutadapt [60]. Sequence

12

alignments were made by Bowtie [61]. Contaminating ribosomal RNAs were identified and

13

removed by mapping sequencing reads to annotated ribosomal RNAs from flybase [62]. To

14

identify TE derived piRNAs, sequencing reads ranging from 23-30 nucleotides (nt) were aligned

15

to Repbase [63], allowing for up to 2 mismatches. The number of reads mapped to each TE

16

family were counted using a Linux shell script. Redundant TE families in Repbase were

17

identified by checking sequence identity (those consensus sequences that were >90% identical

18

across >90% of their length were categorized as the same TE family), and reads mapped to

19

multiple redundant TE families were counted only once. Reads mapped to multiple non-

20

redundant TE families were discarded. To identify miRNAs sequencing reads ranging from 18-

21

22 nt were aligned to a miRNA reference sequence from Flybase [62]. TE-derived piRNA counts

22

for each TE family were normalized to the total number of sequenced miRNAs from each library.

23

Normalized values were used for comparisons of the abundance of piRNAs between libraries.

1

Removal of ribosomal RNAs, and identification of TE-derived reads was performed as for small

2

RNA libraries (above) except that 3 mismatches were permitted between sequencing reads and

3

TE consensus sequences. Non TE-derived reads were aligned to flybase annotated transcripts

4

in the D. melanogaster reference genome (D. melanogaster Release 6) [55,62] by TopHat [64],

5

requiring unique mapping. The number of reads from each protein coding gene were counted

6

using HTseq-count [65]. Differential expression was estimated concurrently for TEs and protein-

7

coding genes by DESeq for aub [66] and DESeq2 for spnE and armi [67]. TEs or protein-coding

8

genes were considered differentially expressed if they exhibited an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and

9

a fold-change > 2 when comparing transgenic rescues and mutants, or with an adjusted p-value

10

< 0.05 and a fold-change > 1.5 when comparing the two transgenic rescues.

Ping-pong fraction

13

Ping-pong fraction was calculated as described in [68]. In brief, small RNA sequencing reads

14

ranging from 23-30 nt were aligned to TE consensus sequences from Repbase [63], and

15

redundant TE families in Repbase were identified as described above. For each piRNA, the

16

proportion of overlapping antisense binding partners whose 5’ end occur on the 10th nucleotide

17

was determined. This fraction was subsequently summed across all piRNAs from a given TE

18

family, while incorporating the difference in sampling frequency between individual piRNAs.

19

Finally, this sum was divided by the total number of piRNAs aligned to the TE family of interest.

20

For multi-mappers, reads were apportioned by the number of times they can be aligned to the

21

reference.

Small RNA sequencing reads ranging from 23-30 nt were aligned to the Repbase [63], and

determined for every TE-derived piRNA. The fraction of distances corresponding to 1 nt was

2

then calculated. To calculate the +1-U proportion [29], the nucleotide after the 3’ end of each

3

piRNA was determined based on alignment to the Repbase [63]. The frequency of each

4

nucleotide at the +1 position was subsequently summed across all piRNAs from a given TE
