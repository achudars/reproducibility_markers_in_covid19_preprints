ABSTRACT

27

The existence of buffering mechanisms is an emerging property of biological

28

networks, and this results in the possible existence of “buffering” loci, that would allow

29

buildup of robustness through evolution. So far, there are no explicit methods to find loci

30

implied in buffering mechanisms. However, buffering can be seen as interaction with genetic

31

background. Here we develop this idea into a tractable model for quantitative genetics, in

32

which the buffering effect of one locus with many other loci is condensed into a single

33

(statistical) effect, multiplicative on the total (statistical) additive genetic effect. This allows

34

easier interpretation of the results, and it also simplifies the problem of detecting epistasis

35

from quadratic to linear in the number of loci. Armed with this formulation, we construct a

36

linear model for genome-wide association studies that estimates, and declares significance, of

37

multiplicative epistatic effects at single loci. The model has the form of a variance

38

components, norm reaction model and likelihood ratio tests are used for significance. This

39

model is a generalization and explanation of previous ones. We then test our model using

40

bovine data: Brahman and Tropical Composite animals, phenotyped for body weight at

41

yearling and genotyped up to ~770,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). After

42

association analysis and based on False Discovery Rate rules, we find a number of loci with

43

buffering action in one, the other, or both breeds; these loci do not have significant statistical

44

additive effect. Most of these loci have been reported in previous studies, either with an

45

additive effect, or as footprints of selection. We identify epistatic SNPs present in or near

46

genes encoding for proteins that are functionally enriched for peptide activity and

47

transcription factors reported in the context of signatures of selection in multi-breed cattle

48

population studies. These include loci known to be associated with coat color, fertility and

49

adaptation to tropical environments. In these populations we found loci that have a non-

50

significant statistical additive effect but a significant epistatic effect. We argue that the

discovery and study of loci associated with buffering effects allows attacking the difficult

52

problems, among others, of release of maintenance variance in artificial and natural selection,

53

of quick adaptation to the environment, and of opposite signs of marker effects in different

54

backgrounds. We conclude that our method and our results generate promising new

perspectives for research in evolutionary and quantitative genetics based on the study of loci

that buffer effect of other loci.

INTRODUCTION

60

Epistasis is a biological phenomenon that is increasingly being given attention in

61

genetics. One of the biological phenomena in which epistasis is likely implied is “buffering”

62

(Visser et al. 2003; Flatt 2005), a mechanism that would allow buildup of robustness through

63

evolution (see (Flatt 2005) for examples). A known example is chaperones (Visser et al.

64

2003; Kitano 2004). Loci implied in buffering would mitigate heritable perturbations. For

65

instance, for a trait with intermediate optima, too high total genotypic values would not be

66

expressed. The existence of buffering mechanisms is an emerging propriety of networks

67

(Mackay 2014) and therefore, because biochemical and gene networks are pervasive in

68

nature, buffering loci must exist. Moreover, the existence of segregating (not fixed) buffering

69

epistatic loci would explain several phenomena that are not well understood: environmental

70

robustness, release of additive variance after disturbing events, (Visser et al. 2003; Flatt

71

2005), maintenance of genetic variance in selected populations previously under stabilizing

72

selection (Gimelfarb 1989), and opposite signs of GWAS associations in different populations

73

(Huang et al. 2012).

74

There are so far no explicit methods to detect loci implied in buffering mechanisms.

75

However, buffering can be understood as interaction with genetic background (Visser et al.

76

2003), and methods to detect epistasis against genetic backgrounds have been proposed

77

(Jannink 2007). There is, in addition, increasing evidence of dependency of gene substitution

78

effects in genetic background (Hansen 2013). More recently, a method that implicitly detects

79

loci in interaction with genetic backgrounds has been presented (Crawford et al. 2017).

80

However, in neither of these cases the connection with buffering mechanisms has been

81

explicitly shown or put forward.

82

In this work, we present for the first time, to our knowledge, a formal quantitative

83

genetics framework for the phenomenon of “buffering epistasis”, derive efficient methods for

84

genome-wide association studies, and perform association analyses for buffering loci in two

85

real tropical cattle populations. Next, we present the biological discoveries following these

86

analyses, showing that significant hits in the association analysis for buffering epistasis have

87

been reported previously either as having an additive effect or as harboring selection

88

signatures for tropical adaptation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Biometrical model.

93

First, we start our development with a rather general model for epistasis. Then, we

94

show how part of the epistatic variability in this general model can be reformulated as a sum

95

of terms of a buffering action of the “buffering” epistatic locus towards the effect of all other

96

loci, whereas the rest of the epistatic variation is ignored. Then we reformulate the sum of

97

buffering actions in terms of a single buffering effect and overall additive genetic value.

98

Armed with this formulation, we describe two methods of analysis, one exact and one

99

approximate. We generally follow existing notations (Mäki-Tanila and Hill 2014).

Consider the total genotypic effect of one individual as the sum of additive (statistical)

101

effects of all loci (𝛼𝑗 at locus j), plus all possible additive by additive (statistical) interactions

102

((𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 for the pairwise interaction between loci i and j):
𝑔 = 𝜇 + ∑ 𝑧𝑗 𝛼𝑗 + ∑ ∑ 𝑧𝑖 𝑧𝑗 (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗
𝑗

𝑖

𝑗

103
104

Note that these statistical pairwise interactions capture the effect of functional

105

pairwise and higher-order interactions (Mäki-Tanila and Hill 2014). Gene content indicators

106

𝑧𝑖 are centered with respect to the population, so 𝐸(𝑔) = 𝜇, 𝐸(∑𝑖 𝑧𝑖 𝛼𝑖 ) = 0 and

107

𝐸(∑𝑖 ∑𝑗 𝑧𝑖 𝑧𝑗 (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 ) = 0 across the population. The model so composed has n additive and

108

𝑛2 additive by additive effects, and they are orthogonal by construction (Cockerham 1954;

109

Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg 2007). Consider Example in Table 1. Allele B is a “shrinker” or

110

“bufferer” allele whereas allele b is a “magnifier” allele.

A buffering effect can be seen as a multiplication of the additive effect of locus 𝑗

115

(locus C/c in Table 1) by a quantity determined by its interaction with (buffering) locus 𝑖

116

(locus B/b in Table 1), in other words, (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘𝑖𝑗 𝛼𝑗 . In Table 1, 𝑘𝑖𝑗 = 3. For instance, the

117

effect of allele “c” in a genetic background “bb” is to increase 3.15 units per one unit of gene

118

content, whereas in a “BB” background the increase is only of 0.35 units.

119

In our work, we assume that 𝑘𝑖𝑗 (the buffering effect of locus i on locus j) can be

120

approximated, for all pairs of locus i with other loci j, by a locus-specific 𝑘𝑖 value. In other

121

words, for a given locus 𝑖, the 𝑛 interactions (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 can be approximated by (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 ≈ 𝑘𝑖 𝛼𝑗 .

122

Alternatively, the value 𝑘𝑖 can be seen as the regression coefficient of the equation (𝛼𝛼)𝑖𝑗 =

123

𝑘𝑖 𝛼𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 . This simplification allows a reduction in number of parameters (from 𝑛2

124

interactions to 𝑛 buffering effects), and, more important, allows focusing on individual

125

buffering loci instead of pairs of loci. In other words, we will find loci which tend to buffer in

126

the same manner across genome.

127
128

Thus, for the purpose of detecting buffering epistatic loci, we model the total
genotypic value (ignoring remaining epistatic actions) of an individual as
𝑔 = 𝜇 + ∑ 𝑧𝑗 𝛼𝑗 + ∑ ∑ 𝑧𝑖 𝑧𝑗 𝑘𝑖 𝛼𝑗
𝑗

𝑖

𝑗

Which after some algebra and because 𝑢 = ∑𝑗 𝑧𝑗 𝛼𝑗 , becomes

129

𝑔 = 𝜇 + 𝑢 + ∑ 𝑧𝑖 𝑘𝑖 𝑢
𝑖

130

Where 𝑢 stands for the (statistical) additive genetic value, also known as breeding

131

value in animal genetics. For GWAS purposes, we will use a model considering only the i-th

132

loci:

133

𝑔 = 𝜇 + 𝑢 + 𝑧𝑖 𝑘𝑖 𝑢

(1)

134

Interestingly, the term 𝑧𝑖 𝑘𝑖 𝑢 can be seen as an interaction of locus i with all genome,

135

as described by (Visser et al. 2003; Flatt 2005). This model was presented by Jannink (2007)

136

as modelling interaction of locus with all genome, but without stating that it is in fact

137

modelling buffering epistatic action. The same model was presented by Crawford et al.

138

(2017)) without formalizing the kind of epistatic action, and (in particular) lacking an

139

orthogonal model.

140

A feature of model in (1) is that because 𝐸(𝑢) = 0, the observed additive effect of

141

locus i changes sign in the extremes of the distribution of 𝑢. Imagine for instance that the

142

buffering effect of locus i (B/b) is 𝑘𝑖 = −0.2 and 𝑝 = 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞(𝐵) = 0.6. For an individual with

143

𝑢 = 20 and carrier of 𝐵𝐵 genotype, 𝑧𝑖 = 2 – 2𝑝 = 0.8, the epistatic effect is negative:

144

𝑘𝑖 𝑧𝑖 𝑢 = −0.2 × 0.8 × 20 = −3.2, and the total genotypic value is 𝑔 = 20 − 3.2 = 16.8.

145

Similarly, for an individual with 𝑢 = 0, the epistatic locus has no effect (there is no

146

buffering); for an individual with 𝑢 = −20, the epistatic effect is positive and increases total

147

genotypic value. In all cases, carriers of the “BB” genotype are regressed towards 0.

148

Plugging (1) into a linear model, a GWAS model would be
𝒚 = 𝑿𝒃 + 𝒖 + 𝑘𝑖 𝒁∗𝑖 𝒖 + 𝒆

149

(2)

150

Where y are quantitative phenotypes of interest, 𝒃 is the fixed effects vector (e.g. herd-

151

sex-year contemporary group), 𝑿 is a design matrix relating records to fixed effects, 𝒁∗𝑖 is a

152

matrix whose diagonal contains 𝒛𝑖 , the coding of the different genotypes at locus i. Note that

153

the term 𝑘𝑖 𝒁∗𝑖 𝒖 = 𝑘𝑖 ∑𝑗=1,𝑛 𝒛𝑖 ⨀𝒛𝑗 𝛼𝑗 is equivalent to Eq. 1 in Crawford et al. (2017) and their

154

terms 𝛼𝑗 are equivalent to our terms 𝑘𝑖 𝛼𝑗 . However, they do not present their model in terms

155

of buffering, and their matrices 𝑥 (𝑧 in our notation) are not centered, which leads to lack of

156

orthogonality of their model (Álvarez-Castro and Carlborg 2007; Vitezica et al. 2017).

157

Our model in (2), is not usable because both the terms 𝑘𝑖 and 𝒖 implied in the

158

regression are unknown. However, the epistatic component 𝝓 = 𝑘𝑖 𝒁𝑖∗ 𝒖 defines a covariance

159

matrix for 𝝓 in the i-th locus:
𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝝓) = 𝒁∗𝑖 𝑮𝜎𝑢2 𝑘𝑖2 𝒁∗′
𝑖

160

which suggests a linear model with the form 𝒚 = 𝑿𝒃 + 𝒖 + 𝝓 + 𝒆, with covariance as above

161

(Jannink 2007; Crawford et al. 2017). Unfortunately, GWAS tests with this formulation imply

162

computing and inverting 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝝓) matrix at each locus (which is computing intensive) and

163

can result in lack of convergence (Crawford et al., 2017). We instead propose an equivalent

164

formulation that uses
𝒈 = 𝒖 + 𝝓 = 𝒖 + 𝒁∗𝑖 𝒖𝑖

165

where 𝒖𝑖 = 𝑘𝑖 𝒖. We have therefore defined a random effect, 𝒖𝑖 , which multiplies real values

166

given by the covariable 𝒁𝑖∗ . This is known as a reaction norm or random regression model

167

(Laird and Ware 1982; Schaeffer 2004). Using this formulation, there are two additive genetic

168

traits in this model: a general additive trait 𝒖 with variance 𝑮𝜎𝑢2 , where G is a relationship

169

matrix (Wright 1922; VanRaden 2008) and a transformation of the buffering action of locus i

170

into another additive trait: 𝒖𝑖 = 𝒖𝑘𝑖 , 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝒖𝑖 ) = 𝑮𝜎𝑢2 𝑘𝑖2 . The joint covariance matrix is:
𝜎2
𝒖
𝑉𝑎𝑟 ( 𝑖 ) = ( 𝑢 2
𝒖
𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢

171

𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢2
) ⨂𝑮 = 𝑮0 ⨂𝑮
𝑘𝑖2 𝜎𝑢2

172

𝜎2
where ( 𝑢 2
𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢

𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢2
𝑖
2 2 ) = 𝑮0 is a non-full rank matrix because 𝒖 = 𝒖𝑘𝑖 , and ⨂ indicates the
𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢

173

Kronecker product. Thus the final linear model, considering the epistatic interaction of locus i

174

with all other loci, is
𝒚 = 𝑿𝒃 + 𝒖 + 𝒁𝑖∗ 𝒖𝑖 + 𝒆

175

𝜎2
𝒖
with 𝑉𝑎𝑟 ( 𝑖 ) = ( 𝑢 2
𝒖
𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢

176

as described below.

𝑘𝑖 𝜎𝑢2
) ⨂𝑮 = 𝑮0 ⨂𝑮. This model can be used in an exact method

179
180

The exact method proceeds by likelihood ratio test of the two-alternative hypothesis,
using random regression with the Model 𝐻1 :
𝒚 = 𝑿𝒃 + 𝒛𝑖 𝛼𝑖 + 𝒖 + 𝒁∗𝑖 𝒖𝑖 + 𝒆

181
182

(3)

and a simpler model excluding random regression with the Model 𝐻0 :
𝒚 = 𝑿𝒃 + 𝒛𝑖 𝛼𝑖 + 𝒖 + 𝒆

183

(4)

184

Where the actual parameter being tested is 𝑘𝑖2 𝜎𝑢2 ≠ 0. The regression on gene content

185

𝒛𝑖 𝛼𝑖 corrects for eventual statistical additive (not epistatic) effects of locus i. Parameters are

186

estimated by REML (Patterson and Thompson 1971).

187

After fitting the two models, the likelihood ratio test of the competing models is

188

distributed as a mixture of 0 and 1 degrees of freedom chi-square, from which P-values can

189

be obtained. In addition, from the estimated covariance matrix 𝑮0 estimated under 𝐻1 , the

190

estimated buffering epistatic effect can be obtained as:
̂ 0 [1,2].
̂ 0 [2,2]/𝑮
𝑘̂𝑖 = 𝑮

191

(5)

192

Contrary to Crawford et al. (2017) matrix 𝑮 has to be computed and inverted only

193

once, because inclusion of the 𝑖-th locus has zero influence on the result (Gianola et al. 2016)

194

and the matrix 𝒁𝑖∗ 𝑮𝜎𝑢2 𝒁∗′
𝑖 is never explicitly computed. This results in great savings of

195

computing time. Matrix 𝑮0 is a non-full rank matrix, which slows down convergence. An

196

easy solution is to use a reduced rank model fitting one principal component (Meyer and

197

Kirkpatrick 2005) as implemented in Wombat (Meyer 2007). Convergence takes a few

198

iterations in this case compared to hundreds using a standard REML algorithm. We conceived

199

two approximate methods that will not be reported here but whose description can be found at

200

(Reverter et al. 2018).

Animals, phenotypes and genotypes

203

Animals, phenotypes and genotypes used in this study were a subset of those used in

204

Raidan et al. (2018). In brief, we used data of 2,111 Brahman (BB) and 2,550 Tropical

205

Composite (TC) cows and bulls genotyped using either the BovineSNP50 (Matukumalli et al.

206

2009) ) or the BovineHD (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) that includes more than 770,000

207

SNP. Animals that were genotyped with the lower density array had their genotypes imputed

208

to higher density as described previously by Bolormaa et al. (2014). SNPs were mapped to

209

the ARS-UCD1.2 bovine genome assembly. After selecting autosomal SNP with minor allele

210

frequency (MAF) > 1%, we retained 651,253 SNPs for BB and 689,818 for TC. We used

211

body weight at yearling (YWT) as the phenotype of interest. The average, minimum and

212

maximum YWT (kg) were 227.7, 115 and 353 kg for BB; and 247.07, 120.5 and 394.5 kg for

213

TC. Moreover, the average, minimum and maximum age at YWT was 360, 302 and 416 days

214

for BB; and 361, 319 and 403 days for TC.

215
216
217
218

False discovery rate (FDR)
Following Bolormaa et al. (2014) and with equivalent original derivations from Storey
(2002), FDR was calculated as:
𝐴
𝑃 (1 − )
𝑇
FDR =
𝐴
( ) (1 − 𝑃)
𝑇

219

Where P is the P-value tested, A is the number of SNP that were significant at the P-

220

value tested, and T is the total number of SNP tested (T = 651,253 and 689,818 for BB and

221

TC, respectively).

Implementation

224

We implemented the analyses using shell scripts to manipulate the data and Wombat

225

(Meyer 2007) for the REML analyses. Markers were analyzed in parallel in the exact analyses

226

in the Genotoul Toulouse bioinfo platform; wall clock computing time was approximately 4

227

days for the exact analysis run in parallel, and a few minutes for the fast approximate one (see

228

Appendix).

Data Availability Statement

231

The minimal raw data is the SNP genotype data, phenotypes and metadata (eg. sex,

232

herd, year) for 4,661 cattle and 729,068 SNP genotypes. These raw data are part of the Beef

233

CRC project (http://www.beefcrc.com/) and are co-owned with Meat and Livestock Australia,

234

and can be made available upon reasonable request and subject to the agreement of the

235

owners. Any parties seeking access to the raw data should contact Dr. Antonio Reverter

236

(toni.reverter-gomez@csiro.au or +61732142392).

238

RESULTS

239

The exact method took ~4 day in a parallel cluster running ~100 process

240

simultaneously. Computation time for a single marker consist of roughly 1 minute. Note that

241

if a medium density chip had been used (50,000 markers instead of ~600,000), computational

242

times divide by an order of magnitude. There is considerable room for improvement of the

243

computational methods, because most of the time is spent reading and manipulating text files.

Table 2 presents the number of significant SNP and FDR at various P-value

248

As a result, the FDR was lower in TC than in BB for a given P-value. For instance, at P-value

249

< 0.0001 the FDR was 9.83% and 4.38% for BB and TC, respectively. The higher number of

250

epistatic SNPs identified in the TC compared to the BB population was attributed to the

251

distinct allele frequencies observed in the two populations. Across all SNPs, the first

252

(reference) allele was found to be either mostly absent (reference allele frequency near 0) or

253

nearly fixated (reference allele frequency near 1) in the BB population, while intermediate

254

allele frequencies (highly-polymorphic and hence more informative SNP) were predominant

255

in the TC population (Figure 2 in (Reverter et al. 2017)). In other words, the distribution of

256

allele frequencies in BB are U-shaped.

257

Figure 1 shows the Manhattan plots for the GWAS for additive and epistatic effects in

258

the BB and TC populations. The most likely candidate gene in the most significantly

259

associated regions are also given in Figure 1. It can already be noted that additive and

260

epistatic gene effects are mutually orthogonal.

261

In the BB population, the strongest significance for epistatic effect corresponded to

262

SNP BovineHD1700017822 mapped to 60,216,894 bp of BTA17 at 11,627 bp of the coding

263

region of TBX5 (T-box 5 transcription factor) and with an estimated epistatic effect of -0.533

264

(-Log10(P-value) = 6.849). The corresponding human chromosome segment is involved in

265

ulnar mammary syndrome (Klopocki et al. 2006), and a recent large meta-GWAS study

266

reveal TBX5 as a candidate gene for mammary gland morphology in Fleckvieh cattle (Pausch

267

et al. 2016).

268

Following TBX5, we found the second strongest signal for epistasis in BB to SNP

269

BovineHD2000011094 (estimated epistatic effect of -0.282 and -Log10(P-value) = 6.669)

270

mapped to 38.97 Mb of BTA20 and 2.6 kb downstream of prolactin receptor (PRLR). PRLR is

271

in a region captured by selection signatures for adaptation in beef cattle (Boitard et al. 2016)

272

and mutations on this gene have been found to have a major genetic effect on hair length and

273

coat structure characteristics of cattle (Littlejohn et al. 2014; Porto-Neto et al. 2018).

274

The third strongest signal corresponded to SNP BovineHD2300014569 mapped to

275

50.10 Mb of BTA23 in the coding region of PRPF4B (pre-mRNA processing factor 4B) with

276

an estimated effect of 0.324 (-Log10(P-value) = 6.309). With no reported function in the

277

context of bovine breeding and genetics, PRPF4B is an essential kinase induced by estrogen

278

(Lahsaee et al. 2016) and its loss promotes sustained growth factor signaling (Corkery et al.

279

2018). Quite strikingly, loci on the coding region of SPEN (SNP BovineHD1600014616,

280

epistatic effect = 0.213, -Log10(P-value) = 2.137) and GHR (SNP BovineHD2000009203,

281

epistatic effect = 0.782, -Log10(P-value) = 2.234) were found to be significantly epistatic in

282

our study. SPEN is an estrogen receptor cofactor and a key regulator of fat deposition and

283

energy balance (Hazegh et al. 2017). Furthermore, a SNP-based co-association gene network

284

by our group previously identified ESRRG and PPARG as key regulators of age at puberty in

285

Brahman cows (Fortes et al. 2013).

286

In the TC population, we found the strongest signal in SNP BovineHD0100028404

287

(epistatic effect = 0.294, -Log10(P-value) = 9.261) mapped to 98.71 Mb of BTA1 in the

288

coding region of LOC100139843 (mCG140927-like) with limited information known about

289

its function, but quite strikingly, recently reported to be associated with age at puberty in

290

Angus bulls (Fernández et al. 2016). We found the second and third strongest signal in the

291

coding region of ZNF521 (SNP BovineHD2400008618, mapped to BTA24:31,439,030 with

292

and estimated epistatic effect = -0.260, -Log10(P-value) = 7.432) and AGTR1 (SNP

293

BovineHD0100034098 mapped to BTA1: 119,483,491 with and estimated epistatic effect = -

294

0.194, -Log10(P-value) = 3.204), respectively. The loci on ZNF521 has been found to

295

associate with female fertility in Nordic Red cattle, consisting of three different populations

296

from Finland, Sweden and Denmark (Höglund et al. 2015). Whereas the role in bovine

297

fertility of AGTR1 (angiotensin II receptor type 1) has long been documented (Portela et al.

298

2008; Marey et al. 2016) including its differential expression at the level of the oviduct

299

between Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle (Fontes et al. 2018).

300

The relationship between epistatic and additive effect in each population is illustrated

301

in Figure 2. It can be seen that effects are empirically orthogonal as expected. Note that unlike

302

additive effects, epistatic effects have no units as they are defined as a multiplier on additive

303

effects. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the epistatic effects in both populations, BB

304

and TC. Significant simultaneously in both populations were 42 SNPs of which 24 where

305

located within 50 kb of the coding region of known genes and these are listed in Table 2.

306

Porto-Neto et al. (2014) showed that LD dropped below 0.2 at distances of 50 kb.

307

Among those listed in Table2, prominent genes for their reported role in mammalian

308

fertility including bovine are: ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1),

309

PCSK5 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5), and TSHR (thyroid stimulating

310

hormone receptor), and IL21 (Interleukin-21).

311

The role of ALDH1A1 during bovine ovarian development has recently been

312

stablished (Hatzirodos et al. 2019; Hummitzsch et al. 2019). Antenos et al. (2011) reported

313

the role of PCSK5 in mouse ovarian follicle development. Similarly, TSHR is a well-known

314

gene for its function regulating growth, fat metabolism and fertility. Dias et al. (2017)

315

identified a candidate QTL in TSHR affecting puberty in five cattle breeds across the taurine

316

and Indicine lineages: Brangus, Brahman, Nellore, Angus and Holstein. Also, one of the most

317

prominent selective sweeps found in all domestic chickens occurred at the locus for TSHR

318

(Rubin et al. 2010). Finally, the immune system response gene IL21 has been shown to harbor

319

selection signatures among divergently selected subpopulations of Polish Red cattle (Gurgul

320

et al. 2019), and among goats and sheep indigenous to a hot arid environment (Kim et al.

321

2016).

DISCUSSION

325

In this study, we present a rigorous formulation of buffering epistasis due to single

326

loci and how it relates to previous works (Jannink 2007; Crawford et al. 2017). Then we

327

present an exact test for association analysis of single locus in buffering epistatic interaction

328

based on bi-variate random regression restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analyses.

329

Methodology for detection of locus by genetic background interactions has been

330

developed at least two times, (sadly) in apparent isolation from each other (Jannink 2007;

331

Crawford et al. 2017). Jannink (2007) first and formally derived the linear model involving

332

(additive) genetic background and one locus showing interaction with the background. He

333

showed orthogonality and derived a variance component useful for genome-wide association

334

studies (GWAS), but he did not realize that the model discovered a particular kind of

335

epistasis. Later, the same model was re-derived by Crawford et al. (2017) who, however, did

336

not build an orthogonal model (something that may lead to spurious effect estimates), and

337

could not use maximum likelihood estimates. Neither of the two authors explicitly estimated

338

the effect of the epistatic loci. Here, we complete and interpret their work.

339

Then we applied our method to two datasets in cattle. Taking together, our findings in

340

these datasets are striking. Some of our significant genes have been reported as having a

341

statistical additive effect in other studies, whereas in ours, they have a statistical epistatic

342

effect but not an additive one. As shown by theory, a shift in the mean of the genetic values

343

towards one of the extremes changes the statistical effect from epistatic into additive, whereas

344

the functional effect is always epistatic. For instance, a gene with epistatic buffering effect

345

𝑘𝑖 = 0.1 in a population with 𝑢̅ = 0 will have a statistically null additive effect, whereas the

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/637579; this version posted May 18, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

346

same gene in a population with 𝑢̅ > 0 will have a positive substitution effect, and a negative

347

one in a population with 𝑢̅ < 0. This explains indeed why some effects change sign when

348

observed in different genetic backgrounds (Magwire et al. 2010).

349

A similar argument explains why we find genes found under selection in a multi-breed

350

comparison study. These genes are bound to have little variation in their coding region and/or

351

no additive effect in any given individual breed, because they are fixed or near fixation.

352

However, inside our populations TC and BB, they are identified as relevant because they have

353

opposite effects in the extremes of the polygenic background, and they would get alternative

354

fixation of alleles if the populations were selected towards either extreme. In other words, our

355

epistatic association analysis can be seen as a selection signature analysis before selection of

356

the extremes.

357

It is somehow difficult to grasp the meaning of the estimate of buffering epistatic

358

effects, e.g. 𝑘̂𝑖 = 0.53 (adimensional) in TBX5 in the BB population. For instance, genetic

359

variation for human height is approximately 39 cm2 in European populations (Visscher 2008).

360

Imagine an individual with large total additive genetic value, i.e. 4 standard deviations (25 cm

361

taller than the mean, i.e. 190 cm for a woman and 203 cm for a man). If such an individual is

362

carrier of the “bufferer” copies and the allele has a frequency of 0.8 (we will assume that the

363

bufferer allele is fairly frequent as protective), her/his height changes by 𝑧𝑖 𝑘𝑖 𝑢 = (2 − 2 ×

364

0.8) × −0.53 × 25, i.e. 5.3 centimeters shorter. Still, the estimate of -0.53 is probably too

365

high – due to the winner’s curse or Beavis effect (Xu 2003).

366

The possibility of detection and further functional analysis of these epistatic loci

367

implied in buffering mechanisms is of particular relevance in quantitative genetics. As

368

described in the Introduction, these loci must exist (Mackay 2014), be selected (Flatt 2005)

369

and they would explain perplexing phenomena: release or maintenance of additive variance

370

(Visser et al. 2003; Flatt 2005), (Gimelfarb 1989), “conversion” of epistatic into additive

371

variance (Mackay 2014) and opposite signs of GWAS associations in different populations

372

(Huang et al. 2012) (Magwire et al. 2010).

373

Our model is based on interaction with genetic background, and there is increasing

374

evidence of dependency of gene substitution on genetic background (Hansen 2013). This

375

implies, potentially, large changes in gene effects and selection dynamics even if genetic

376

variance is nearly fully additive at each step (Hansen 2013). Indeed, it has been argued that

377

epistasis provides the basis of rapid adaptation to new environments (Wright 1931; Mackay

378

2014).

379

For evolutionary research and plant and animal breeding, there is growing interest in

380

understanding the extent and mechanisms of epistasis in biology because of the intriguing

381

prospect of it being an untapped future source of additive variation that may be exploited by

382

nature and by breeding programs to evolve phenotypes as well as influencing genetic

383

heterogeneity. Indeed, the role of epistasis in determining which mutations ultimately succeed

384

or fail in a population under selection remains a central challenge in biology. Buskirk et al.

385

(2017) demonstrated the power of experimental evolution to identify epistatic interactions. In

386

multi-generation selection programs continued response has been seen, classically for over

387

100 generations in the Illinois maize kernel content lines , and there have been large and still

388

continuing genetic improvements in livestock populations, notably in broiler chickens (Hill

389

2016). Whilst the obvious source of continued response is de novo mutation, some of the

390

additive variation being utilized may have derived from existing mutations whose behavior

391

changes from epistatic to additive in response to changes in the remainder of the genome,

392

consistent with the argument of Carlborg et al. (2006). Paixão and Barton (2016) argued that

393

‘epistasis sustains additive genetic variance for longer: Alleles that were initially deleterious

394

or near-neutral may acquire favorable effects as the genetic background changes,

395

“converting” epistatic variance into additive, and so prolonging the response to selection’.

396

Similarly, Hill (2017) concluded that ‘It seems better to concentrate on utilizing additive

397

variance, and hope for a bonus from converting epistatic variance’.

398

To conclude, our method and our results show promising new perspectives for

399

research in evolutionary and quantitative genetics based on the study of loci that buffer effect

400

of other loci.
