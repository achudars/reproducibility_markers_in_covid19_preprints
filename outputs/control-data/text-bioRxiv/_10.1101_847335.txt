Abstract

18

Bacteria come in an array of shapes and sizes, but the mechanisms underlying diverse

19

morphologies are poorly understood. The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is the primary

20

determinant of cell shape. At the molecular level, much of the studied morphological

21

variation results from the regulation of PG synthesis enzymes involved in elongation

22

and division. These enzymes are spatially controlled by cytoskeletal scaffolding

23

proteins, such as FtsZ, MreB, and DivIVA, that both recruit and organize the PG

24

synthesis complex. How then do cells define alternative morphogenic processes that

25

are distinct from cell elongation and division? To address this question, we have turned

26

to the specific morphotype of Alphaproteobacterial prosthecae, or "stalks". Stalk

27

synthesis is a specialized form of zonal growth, which requires PG synthesis in a

28

spatially constrained zone to extend a thin cylindrical projection of the cell envelope.

29

The morphogen SpmX defines the site of stalk PG synthesis, but SpmX is a PG

hydrolase. How then does a non-cytoskeletal protein, SpmX, define and constrain PG

31

synthesis to form stalks? Here we report that SpmX and the bactofilin BacA act in

32

concert to regulate stalk synthesis in Asticcacaulis biprosthecum. We show that SpmX

33

acts to recruit BacA to the site of stalk synthesis. BacA then serves as a stalk-specific

34

topological organizer that anchors the PG synthesis complex, including its recruiter

35

SpmX, to the base of the stalk, where stalk PG synthesis occurs. In the absence of

36

BacA, cells produce "pseudostalks" that are the result of unconstrained PG synthesis

37

correlated with the mislocalization of SpmX. Finally, we show that BacA is required to

38

inhibit the default function of PG synthesis machinery in cell elongation/division and to

39

prevent DNA entry at the site of stalk synthesis defined by SpmX. Therefore, the protein

40

responsible for recruitment of a morphogenic PG remodeling complex is uncoupled from

41

the protein that topologically organizes the complex.

Introduction

44

Bacterial cells come in a panoply of shapes and sizes, from the ubiquitous rods and

45

cocci to hyphal, star-shaped, and appendaged bacteria [1]. In addition to shapes that

46

are reproduced faithfully across generations, bacterial cells can dynamically change

47

shape in response to environmental conditions or through a programmed life cycle [1-3].

48

The shape of most bacteria is determined by the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, and the

49

resulting morphology is the product of complex interactions between the proteins and

50

regulatory elements that compose the PG biosynthetic machinery. Much morphological

51

variation results from the differential regulation of divisome or elongasome proteins. For

52

example, the suppression of divisome proteins allows ovococcoid bacteria to form rods

53

under certain biofilm conditions or pathogenic rod-shaped bacteria to filament during

54

infection [3-6]. Filamentous Streptomycetes form branching hyphae by localizing the

55

same elongation machinery in different places [3, 7]. How then do cells define a new

56

morphological process that is distinct from the elongasome or divisome, but still

57

operates in the context of those critical PG synthesis modes? To address this question,

58

we have turned to the specific morphotype of Alphaproteobacterial prosthecae.

59

Prosthecae, or “stalks,” are non-essential extensions of the bacterial cell body thought

60

to play a role in nutrient uptake [8, 9]. Stalk synthesis requires PG synthesis in a

61

spatially constrained zone in order to extend a thin cylindrical projection of the cell

62

envelope. The stalk is compartmentalized from the cytoplasm, as it is devoid of DNA

63

and ribosomes and excludes even small cytoplasmic proteins such as GFP [9].

64

Asticcacaulis biprosthecum, a gram negative Alphaproteobacterium from the

65

Caulobacteraceae family [10], produces two bilateral stalks whose synthesis depends

66

on PG synthesis at the base of the incipient stalk structures (red arrows in Figure 1A)

67

[11]. How do cells harness PG synthesis machinery to produce stalks while preventing

68

its typical function of cell elongation or division?

69

Here we report how a recently identified class of bacterial cytoskeletal protein, known as

70

"bactofilin", plays a dual role by defining the topography of PG synthesis for the

71

synthesis of stalks and by inhibiting a default cell elongation mode at that same site in

72

A. biprosthecum. Bactofilins are conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom and are

73

characterized by the presence of a central conserved DUF583 (or "bactofilin") domain

74

flanked by N- and C-terminal regions of variable length and sequence (Figure 1B) [12].

75

Bactofilins are involved in cell shape determination in a number of species. For

76

example, in the helical Helicobacter pylori and Leptospira biflexa, bactofilins are

77

required for proper helical shape generation [13, 14]. In Caulobacter crescentus,

78

bactofilins optimize the rate of stalk synthesis at the cell pole by a yet unknown

79

mechanism [12]. It is not well understood how bactofilins exert an effect on morphology,

80

but a common theme appears to be association or direct interaction with PG modifying

81

enzymes.

82

The best studied bacterial cytoskeletal proteins (MreB, FtsZ, and DivIVA) serve dual

83

roles as both recruiters and organizers of the proteins for their respective PG synthesis

84

complexes. In contrast, we show that the roles of recruiter and organizer of PG

85

synthesis have undergone a division of labor in A. biprosthecum stalk synthesis, where

86

a morphogen recruits its own organizing cytoskeletal protein. Our prior work established

87

that the recruitment of the stalk PG synthesis machinery is performed by the modular

88

morphogen SpmX: changing SpmX location is sufficient to drive stalk synthesis at a

89

new site [11], much like changing the position of FtsZ changes the location of the site of

90

cell division. However, SpmX is a PG hydrolase, not a cytoskeletal protein [11, 15]. How

91

then does a non-cytoskeletal protein, SpmX, define and constrain PG synthesis to form

92

stalks? In this work, we identify the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein that provides

93

topological specificity to the stalk synthesis machinery, including to the recruiter SpmX

94

itself. We apply genetics, cell biology, microscopy, chemical labeling, and quantitative

95

analysis to examine the interconnected roles of the morphogen SpmX and the bactofilin

96

BacA in Asticcacaulis biprosthecum stalk synthesis. We present evidence that SpmX

97

and BacA act in a coordinated fashion to initiate and regulate stalk synthesis. SpmX

98

acts as the recruiter of the stalk synthesis complex, including BacA. BacA then serves

99

as a stalk-specific cytoskeletal scaffolding protein that anchors the putative synthesis

100

complex, including SpmX, to the base of the stalk, and defines the width of the complex.

101

In the absence of BacA, cells produce abnormal "pseudostalks" that are the result of

102

unconstrained PG synthesis correlated with the mislocalization of SpmX. Finally, we

103

show that BacA is required to block entry of the PG synthesis machinery involved in cell

104

elongation and division, as well as DNA, from the site of stalk synthesis defined by

105

SpmX. Therefore, the protein responsible for recruitment of a morphogenic PG

106

remodeling complex is uncoupled from the protein that topologically organizes the

107

complex. Such decoupled recruitment and scaffolding processes may prove more

108

versatile for morphogenetic events that do not simply involve modulation of cell

109

elongation or division.

Results

112
113

A. biprosthecum encodes a single bactofilin gene whose product selfpolymerizes in vitro

114

A. biprosthecum has proven to be a better system than C. crescentus to identify genes

115

required for stalk synthesis because: 1) The A. biprosthecum spmX mutant is the only

116

known stalkless mutant in any Caulobacterales species whose phenotype is not

117

bypassed by phosphate starvation [11, 16, 17], which stimulates stalk synthesis [11, 18-

118

20]; 2) A. biprosthecum stalks are located at midcell, away from the myriad of polarly

119

localized proteins involved in C. crescentus development and cell cycle progression [21-

120

24], eliminating any potentially confounding co-localization or interaction data; and 3)

121

many of the genetic tools developed for C. crescentus work in A. biprosthecum. In C.

122

crescentus, deletion of the bactofilin genes bacA and bacB (for clarity, these will be

123

referred to as "bacACc" and "bacBCc") leads to a slight reduction in length of otherwise

124

normal stalks [12, 25, 26]. Only bacACc has a homolog in the A. biprosthecum genome,

125

which we have named "bacA" (Figure 1C). The genomic arrangement of the A.

126

biprosthecum bacA locus is similar to that of C. crescentus bacACc, with a putative M23

127

family metallopeptidase gene (CC1872/ABI_34190) directly upstream and overlapping

128

the bacACc/bacA coding regions, and a putative peroxiredoxin gene

129

(CC1871/ABI_34200) further upstream (Figure 1C). BacA exhibits high sequence and

130

predicted structural similarity to the C. crescentus bactofilins, with a central DUF583

131

domain composed of repeating β strands flanked by proline-rich N- and C-termini,

132

suggesting similar biochemical properties (Figure 1D). Indeed, BacACc can self-

133

assemble in vitro into filaments, filament bundles, and sheets [12, 27]. To test if A.

134

biprosthecum BacA is an auto-polymerizing protein, we overexpressed and purified both

135

BacACc and BacA in Escherichia coli and visualized the purified proteins via

136

transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1E). While BacACc readily polymerized

137

in various environments (salt, pH, chaotropic agent), under similar conditions BacA

138

formed proteins aggregates instead of filaments. While most conditions tested did not

139

improve BacA solubility, addition of high detergent concentration (10% Triton X-100)

140

allowed filament formation. The TEM micrographs show that both bactofilin proteins,

141

BacACc and BacA, self-polymerize in vitro to form protofilament bundles, with BacA

142

forming 90 nm wide filaments made of single filaments stacked together through lateral-

143

lateral interactions, similar to BacACc (Figure 1E).

144

BacA is required for stalk synthesis

145

In C. crescentus, deletion of the bactofilin homologs bacACc and/or bacBCc does not

146

abrogate stalk synthesis or impact stalk ultrastructure, but results in a slight reduction in

147

stalk length under stalk synthesis-stimulating phosphate-limited conditions [12]. This

148

suggests that, in C. crescentus, deletion of bacABCc affects only stalk longitudinal

149

extension and to a limited extent [12]. Strikingly, ~95% of A. biprosthecum ∆bacA

150

mutant cells were completely stalkless when grown in the complex medium PYE, with a

151

small proportion of cells exhibiting bump-like protrusions at the midcell where stalks

152

would normally be found (Supplemental Figure 1). Since growth in rich medium may

153

mask latent stalk phenotypes [11, 20], the ∆bacA mutant was studied under phosphate

154

starvation, which stimulates stalk synthesis [11, 18-20], to study the ∆bacA mutant. In

155

low phosphate medium, more than half (58% ± 12%) of WT cells possessed a visible

156

cell body extension, all of which were stalks (Figure 2). In the ∆bacA mutant, only 3% ±

157

2% of total cells produced a stalk (Figure 2). Instead of synthesizing stalks, the ∆bacA

158

mutant produced short, wide protrusions at the bilateral positions where stalks are

159

normally synthesized, which we termed “pseudostalks” (Figure 2A and red arrows in

Figure 2B). Under phosphate starvation, the stalks produced by WT cells were 7.3 ± 3.7

161

µm long and 171 ± 13 nm in diameter at the base (Figure 2). Pseudostalks were

162

significantly shorter than stalks at 0.9 ± 0.5 µm long (~88% decrease in length

163

compared to WT), were more variable in diameter, and were often branched or

164

"frazzled" at the ends (Figure 2). Pseudostalks were significantly wider in diameter at

165

the base, 392 ± 73 nm or an ~129% increase in width compared to WT (Figure 2).

166

The presence of a low-copy plasmid encoding bacA expressed from the native promoter

167

restored stalk synthesis, albeit partially, in the ∆bacA mutant. Complemented ∆bacA

168

cells produced stalks 2.4 ± 2.0 µm long that, while shorter than WT stalks, were

169

significantly longer than ∆bacA pseudostalks (Figure 2). In addition, 28% ± 6% of

170

complemented ∆bacA cells produced WT-like stalks, a significant increase over the

171

mutant (Figures 2). Both stalk diameter and variability in stalk diameter (178 ± 20 nm)

172

were restored to WT levels in the complemented ∆bacA cells (Figure 2). Taken

173

together, these data show that BacA is required for stalk synthesis in A. biprosthecum.

174

BacA localizes to the site of stalk synthesis after SpmX localization

175

While the localization of SpmX is known, the pattern of BacA localization is not. The

176

stalk morphogen SpmX localizes to the future site of stalk synthesis in predivisional

177

cells of Asticcacaulis, where it marks the site of stalk synthesis, which occurs after cell

178

division and swarmer cell differentiation in the next cell cycle [11] (Figure 3A). To

179

investigate the subcellular localization of BacA in WT cells, we fused BacA to mVenus

180

at the native locus and performed fluorescence microscopy.

181

We first performed time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of BacA-mVenus to determine

182

the timing of BacA localization relative to that of SpmX (Figure 3B and Supplemental

183

Movie 1). The first four panels of Figure 3B (0-84 min) show the elongation of a

184

predivisional mother cell as it produces an incipient swarmer daughter cell, where BacA

185

is already localized at bilateral positions in the stalked half of the cell. After cell division

186

(the transition from 84-112 min), a BacA-mVenus focus appeared at a lateral position in

187

the incipient swarmer cell. While only one BacA-mVenus focus is visible in the overlay

188

from 112 to 140 min, a second focus is clearly visible in the overlay at 168 and 196 min.

189

This process of BacA localization after cell division is repeated in later panels with a

190

second daughter cell (140-252 min). Therefore, SpmX localizes first in predivisional

191

cells where it marks the sites of stalk synthesis, followed by BacA localization after cell

192

division. We then sought to quantify BacA-mVenus localization at the population level,

193

rather than single cells. Overall, BacA-mVenus localized to bilateral positions at the

194

base of the stalks (Figure 3C). A population-level heatmap of the subcellular localization

195

of BacA-mVenus foci exhibited a localization pattern similar to that of SpmX [11], with

196

foci clustering in a bilateral manner at the midcell (Figure 3D).

197

SpmX is required for BacA localization

198

Considering that 1) both SpmX and BacA are required for WT stalk synthesis; 2) that

199

both proteins localize to the site of stalk synthesis; and 3) that SpmX localizes to the site

200

of stalk synthesis prior to BacA, we hypothesized that SpmX is required for BacA

201

localization. In order to test the role of SpmX in BacA localization, we constructed a

202

strain with bacA-mVenus fusion at the native locus in the ∆spmX background (Figure

203

3C-3F).

204

As reported above in the WT background, BacA-mVenus localized to the base of the

205

stalk (Figure 3C) with foci clustering in a bilateral manner at the midcell (Figure 3D). In

206

the ΔspmX mutant, BacA-mVenus was often mislocalized toward the poles (Figure 3C),

207

and the population-level heatmap of the subcellular localization of BacA-mVenus foci in

208

the ΔspmX mutant showed that BacA-mVenus was randomly distributed throughout the

209

cell body (Figure 3D). To further investigate BacA-mVenus dynamics in WT and ΔspmX

210

strains, we performed time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (Supplemental Movies 1 & 2)

211

and used particle tracking to track movement and velocity changes for individual foci

212

(Figure 3E & 3F). In WT cells, BacA-mVenus foci were constrained bilaterally at sites of

213

stalk synthesis and remained relatively static once they appeared (Figure 3B, 3E, & 3F

214

and Supplemental Movie 1). Conversely, in the ΔspmX mutant, BacA-mVenus foci

215

moved randomly throughout the cell body and exhibited start-stop patterns of spikes

216

and drops in velocity (Figure 3E & 3F and Supplemental Movie 2). Taken together,

217

these data show that SpmX is required for BacA localization.

218

BacA and SpmX interact in a bacterial two-hybrid system

219

Since SpmX is required for BacA localization, we tested whether SpmX and BacA

220

interact in vivo using bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid (BACTH) assays [28]

221

(Figure 4). We tested all combinations of T18 and T25 fusions for SpmX and BacA.

222

Both SpmX and BacA showed self-interactions (Figure 4), consistent with previous

223

results showing that C. crescentus SpmX forms oligomers [29] and confirming our

224

results showing BacA is a self-polymerizing protein (Figure 1E). Notably, we also

225

observed SpmX-BacA interactions (Figure 4C & 4D), although the only interactions we

226

observed were when BacA was fused with the T25 fragment on the N-terminus (T25-

227

BacA). These results make sense in the context of recent work showing that the N-

228

terminal tail of Thermus thermophilus bactofilin is required for membrane binding [30]. If

229

the BacA N-terminal tail is also involved in membrane binding, the fact that we only

230

detect SpmX-BacA interactions when the C-terminal tail is unencumbered by a fusion

231

suggests that the C-terminal region of BacA is involved in protein-protein interactions

232

with SpmX.

233

BacA is required to stabilize SpmX to the stalk base

234

Cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins can be loosely defined as proteins that physically

235

organize the molecular components of a biological process or pathway [3]. Because 1)

236

SpmX acts in a modular fashion to define the site of stalk synthesis [11]; 2) is required

237

for BacA localization; and 3) BacA is required to constrain stalk diameter, we

238

hypothesized that BacA organizes PG synthesis enzymes, and perhaps SpmX, at the

239

site of stalk synthesis. To test SpmX localization in the absence of BacA, we

240

constructed strains with spmX-eGFP fusions at the native locus in both WT and ∆bacA

241

backgrounds. Consistent with previously published results [11], fluorescence

242

microscopy showed that SpmX-eGFP localizes bilaterally to the site of stalk synthesis in

243

WT cells (Figures 5A & 5B). Interestingly, SpmX localized to the nominal site of stalk

244

synthesis even in the absence of BacA (Figures 5A & 5B). However, SpmX-eGFP often

245

localized to the tips of the pseudostalks of the ΔbacA mutant, rather than the base as it

246

does in WT cells (Figure 5A & 5B). This defect of SpmX localization is further revealed

247

by the localization heatmaps, where, rather than a tight localization close to the cell

248

envelope in WT, there is a diffuse localization at the midcell that radiates away from the

249

cell body in the bacA mutant (Figure 5B). Indeed, quantification of the orthogonal

250

distance of SpmX-eGFP maxima from the medial axis of the associated cell, showed a

251

significant increase in ΔbacA cells compared to WT (Figure 5C). In addition, both the

252

area of the SpmX-eGFP maxima (Figure 5D) and the relative fluorescence intensity

253

(Figure 5E) significantly increased in the ΔbacA mutant compared to WT, suggesting

254

that regulation of SpmX organization and protein levels are disrupted. Taken together

255

with the BACTH results, these results indicate a scaffolding role for BacA during stalk

256

synthesis whereby BacA is required to stabilize and constrain SpmX in a tight area at

257

the base of the stalk.

258

Pseudostalks are composed of PG and formed through delocalized PG synthesis

259

A. biprosthecum stalks extend through the addition of newly synthesized PG at the base

260

of the stalk and are composed of PG throughout [11]. We wanted to test if the short,

261

wide pseudostalks of the ∆bacA mutants were the result of unconstrained PG synthesis,

262

albeit at the proper bilateral positions. It has been shown that isolated PG sacculi

263

maintain the shape of the bacterial cell, including PG-containing stalks [31]. To test if

264

pseudostalks are composed of PG, we first isolated sacculi from A. biprosthecum WT

265

and ∆bacA cells. As expected, A. biprosthecum WT sacculi exhibited long and thin

266

bilateral extensions of stalk PG (Figure 6A). Sacculi purified from ∆bacA cells showed

267

sac-like bilateral extensions of PG that mimicked the morphology of pseudostalks

268

(Figure 6A), confirming that pseudostalks are composed of PG.

269

There are several modes of PG synthesis that could result in pseudostalks. For

example, they could be synthesized 1) from the base like WT stalks, albeit with a wider

271

and variable area of extension; 2) via polar growth similar to vegetative growth of the

272

filamentous Streptomycetes [3], with PG remodeling occurring through polar tip

273

extension; or 3) be the result of dispersed PG synthesis throughout the pseudostalk,

274

similar to lateral elongation of some rod-shaped cells [3].

275

To test these possibilities, we employed various methods of Fluorescent D-Amino Acid

276

(FDAA) [32] labeling to visualize active PG synthesis during growth in low-phosphate

277

medium. Cells were first subjected to pulses (45 min or ~20% of doubling time) of a red

278

FDAA (TADA) (Figure 6B). If pseudostalks are synthesized from the base, the FDAA

279

should label the cell, but not the pseudostalk itself. In WT cells, labeling was diffuse

280

throughout the cell, but absent from the stalks (Figure 6B), consistent with previous

281

results [11]. In contrast, ∆bacA cells showed strong labeling throughout the

282

pseudostalks, indicating that these structures are not synthesized from the base as in

283

WT stalks (Figure 6B). To obtain better spatiotemporal resolution of PG remodeling and

284

to correlate SpmX localization with PG remodeling, we performed virtual time-lapse

285

FDAA labeling [32], where short successive pulses of different colored FDAA probes

286

are used for spatiotemporal labeling of areas of PG synthesis. A. biprosthecum WT

287

SpmX-eGFP and ∆bacA SpmX-eGFP cells were first labeled with a blue FDAA (HADA)

288

for 6 min followed by a red FDAA (TADA) for 3 min, with the dye being washed away

289

after each respective incubation (Figure 6C). Cells were then imaged via 3D‐SIM

290

(Structured Illumination Microscopy). For WT cells, the HADA and TADA signals

291

overlapped both in the cell body and at the base of the stalk, colocalized with the SpmX-

292

eGFP focus and consistent with stalk PG synthesis at the base and no PG synthesis

293

along the stalk length (Figure 6C). In contrast, the HADA and TADA signals overlapped

294

in both the cell body and the pseudostalks of ∆bacA cells and SpmX-eGFP localizing to

295

the tips of the pseudostalks (Figure 6C), indicating that pseudostalks are formed via

296

dispersed PG synthesis throughout the structure.

297

BacA inhibits the default elongation and division modes of PG synthesis as well

298

as DNA entry at sites of stalk synthesis

299

While the FDAA labeling techniques used above (Figure 6B & 6C) show that new PG is

300

incorporated into the pseudostalk, it does not distinguish per se if PG is being

301

incorporated from the base, as in WT stalks, or if PG incorporation is distributed

302

throughout the pseudostalk. To determine the PG incorporation pattern for ∆bacA

303

pseudostalks, we performed pulse-chase FDAA labeling (Figure 6D). A. biprosthecum

304

WT and ∆bacA cells were first labeled with a red FDAA (TADA) to ensure whole-cell

305

labeling, including stalks and pseudostalks. Cells were then washed twice to remove the

306

FDAA and time-lapse fluorescent microscopy was performed. As the A. biprosthecum

307

WT cells grew, FDAA signal disappeared from the cell body, but was retained in the

308

stalk (Figure 6D), with a slight clearing near the base as stalk PG was synthesized from

309

its base (Figure 6D, yellow triangles). In contrast, ∆bacA cells lost FDAA signal

310

throughout both the cell body and the pseudostalks at a similar rate (Figure 6D),

311

consistent with PG synthesis throughout the pseudostalk. Strikingly, 49% (42/85) of

312

∆bacA cells observed were able to extend and divide from the pseudostalks and

313

produced cell-like extensions that continued to elongate after cytokinesis (yellow

314

triangles in Figure 6E), suggesting that cell growth was occurring at sites usually

315

reserved for stalk synthesis. These results suggested that BacA might be required to

316

prevent entry of chromosomal DNA that would be required for continued growth of these

317

lateral cell extensions. To determine if ∆bacA pseudostalks contained DNA, we stained

318

live cells with DAPI. In WT cells, DAPI staining was constrained to the cell body, but in

319

∆bacA cells, pseudostalks stained strongly for DNA (Figure 6F). It should be noted that

320

we were unable to determine the viability of the cell-like structures produced from the

321

pseudostalks, but, qualitatively, there is no discernable difference between the growth of

322

WT and ΔbacA strains in liquid culture or on plates. Taken together, these data indicate

323

that, in addition to providing a scaffold for proper stalk PG synthesis at its base, BacA

324

inhibits not only unwanted PG synthesis involved in cell elongation and division, but also

325

the entry of DNA at sites of stalk synthesis.

Discussion

328

Intricate biological processes underlie even the simplest of shapes. The ubiquitous rod-

329

and sphere-shaped bacteria can be generated through multiple strategies [33, 34], but

330

the final observed form is the result of finely tuned gene expression, metabolic

331

processes that regulate PG precursor and subunit levels, and the spatiotemporal

332

localization of PG-modifying enzymes. The study of shape generation and maintenance

333

has uncovered a common theme of scaffolding proteins such as MreB, FtsZ, and

334

DivIVA that recruit and organize PG synthesis to specific subcellular locations at

335

specific times. Here we present evidence that the paradigm of a cytoskeletal scaffolding

336

protein serving the dual roles of recruitment and organization in PG synthesis is not

337

always true. In A. biprosthecum, the roles of recruitment and organization for the stalk

338

synthesis PG remodeling complex are performed by two distinct proteins, SpmX and

339

BacA, respectively. Furthermore, BacA prevents the cell elongation and division PG

340

synthesis machinery from being activated at the site of stalk PG synthesis. Finally, BacA

341

also prevents the entry of DNA into stalks.

342

Previous work has shown that SpmX appears early in Asticcacaulis spp. cell cycle,

343

where it localizes in pre-divisional daughter cells to mark the future site of stalk

344

synthesis [11]. Here we show that BacA operates downstream of SpmX for subcellular

345

localization in the A. biprosthecum stalk synthesis pathway but acts upstream of SpmX

346

for the topological organization of SpmX and the PG synthesis machinery. In the

347

absence of SpmX, cells are stalkless and BacA-mVenus forms foci that move randomly

348

throughout the cell body, indicating that SpmX recruits BacA, and presumably other PG

349

remodeling enzymes that remain to be discovered, to the site of stalk synthesis (Figure

350

7A). Once stalk synthesis is initiated, BacA serves as a scaffolding protein that

351

constrains PG synthesis at the base of the stalk, allowing for WT stalk elongation and

352

maturation (Figure 7A). Based on current knowledge, this is the first reported

353

morphogenic PG remodeling process in which the proteins responsible for recruitment

354

of the complex are decoupled from the scaffolding proteins that organize the complex.

355

Such decoupled recruitment and scaffolding processes may prove more versatile for

356

morphogenetic events that do not simply involve modulation of cell elongation or

357

division.

358

Many questions remain regarding prosthecae synthesis in both A. biprosthecum

359

specifically and the stalked Alphaproteobacteria in general. Even among closely related

360

species there are phenotypic differences, such as the number and placement of stalks,

361

as well as differences in the genes involved in stalk synthesis. Furthermore, in many

362

stalked marine species, the stalk serves a reproductive function, with a budding

363

daughter cell produced from the tip of the stalk [35-38]. How have these stalk synthesis

364

pathways evolved? Are there core genes that are shared amongst bacteria that produce

365

stalks? There are certainly differences, specifically between C. crescentus and

366

A. biprosthecum (Supplemental Table 1) [11], but what other genes are involved in

367

A. biprosthecum stalk synthesis? ABI_34190, the gene that lies upstream and overlaps

368

bacA (Figure 1C), is a putative M23 family metallopeptidase (Pfam 01551) whose

369

predicted endopeptidase activity would cleave PG crosslinks. Thus, ABI_34190

370

provides an intriguing candidate for both its predicted function in PG remodeling and its

371

genomic association with bacA. How do bactofilins function in stalk synthesis?

372

Presumably, the ability to self-polymerize is important to bactofilin function in general

373

but, to date, there have been no studies showing that non-polymerizing mutants lead to

17

374

a phenotypic change. The terminal regions flanking the conserved bactofilin domain

375

often vary between species. Do the N- and C-terminal domains serve any specific

376

purposes? Work on T. thermophilus bactofilin showed that the N-terminal region is

377

involved in membrane binding [30]. We used high detergent levels, a high micellization

378

condition, to get purified BacA to form filaments in vitro. Our BACTH results suggest

379

that the C-terminus is important for BacA-SpmX interaction. It seems likely that these N-

380

and C- terminal regions play important roles in membrane and protein interactions.

381

This study has also revealed an unexpected role for a scaffold protein in inhibiting

382

default modes of PG synthesis. In the absence of BacA, cells produce what we have

383

termed "pseudostalks", which are significantly shorter and wider than stalks. In addition,

384

BacA is required to stabilize SpmX at the base of the stalk (Figure 7A), as observed by

385

the mislocalization of SpmX-eGFP in the absence of BacA (Figure 7B). Pseudostalks,

386

like WT stalks, are composed of PG. However, unlike WT stalks, which are synthesized

387

from the base of the stalk (Figure 7A), pseudostalks are the result of dispersed PG

388

remodeling throughout the structure (Figure 7B). We find a parallel for this phenomenon

389

with the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein DivIVA in the Actinobacterium Mycobacterium

390

smegmatis. Normal, rod-shaped M. smegmatis undergo asymmetric bipolar growth, and

391

DivIVA focuses this cell envelope assembly at the poles [39]. When DivIVA is depleted,

392

PG synthesis persists, but in a disorganized manner throughout the cell, leading to

393

spherical cells [40]. Similarly, in the absence of BacA, PG synthesis persists, but in a

394

disorganized manner leading to pseudostalks.

395

Strikingly, we show that the pseudostalks that form in the absence of BacA can

396

incorporate the default cell elongation and cell division modes, forming cell body

397

extensions that contain DNA and can divide. These results suggest that the cytoskeletal

398

bactofilin BacA not only organizes and constrains PG synthesis to specific subcellular

399

locations (Figure 7A) but, also inhibits the default function of PG synthesis machinery in

400

cell elongation and division and DNA entry at the site of stalk synthesis defined by

401

SpmX. The decoupling of the recruitment and scaffolding roles for proteins that localize

402

the PG synthesis complex may facilitate safeguarding against establishment of cell

403

elongation and division at those morphogenetic sites. However, removal of a single

404

layer of regulation (in this case, A. biprosthecum BacA) can lead to unregulated growth,

405

with A. biprosthecum becoming a branching organism via pseudostalks. This follows an

406

emerging theme of bacterial morphogenesis in which morphological variation results

407

from the differential regulation of PG remodeling [3, 41, 42]. In other words, much like

408

the Actinobacteria Streptomyces spp., A. biprosthecum localizes PG synthesis at

409

specific places with different morphological results: branching hyphae and stalks,

410

respectively. Furthermore, this result suggests that at least some of the PG synthesis

411

enzymes used for stalk synthesis are the same as those used for cell elongation and

412

division, which may explain why we have yet to identify a PG synthesis enzyme used

413

specifically for stalk synthesis.

Allelic exchange and deletions were achieved using a two-step sucrose

470

counterselection procedure with pNPTS138/pNPTS139. Insertional fusions of eGFP

471

and mVenus were made using pGFPC-1 and pVENC-4, respectively [48]. BACTH

490

Bioinformatics

491

Genomic and protein sequence data were obtained from the Integrated Microbial

492

Genomes (IMG) database [49]. Multiple sequence alignment of bactofilin sequences

493

was performed using Jalview [50] with a MAFFT alignment using the L-INS-i preset. The

494

C. crescentus BacBCc protein sequence used for alignment is a translation of an open

495

reading frame in CC3022 that initiates at a downstream ATG codon, as described

496

previously [12]. The predicted structure of A. biprosthecum BacA (ABI_34180) was

497

modeled using SWISS-MODEL [51] with the structure of C. crescentus BacA (CC1872;

498

PBD code 2N3D) as a template. Alignment was then processed using the ESPript

499

server [52]. Percent identity (PID) was calculated from pairwise MAFFT alignments

using the L-INS-i preset. 𝑃𝐼𝐷 = (

z‐axis scanning depth was 2 μm. Immersion oil with refraction index of 1.514 was used.

527

SIM images were reconstructed using softWoRx.

528

Electron Microscopy

529

10 µl cell or sacculi suspension was applied to an electron microscopy grid

530

(Formvar/Carbon on 300 mesh; Ted Pella Inc., Cat. No. 01753-F) for 5 min at room

531

temperature. Excess liquid was removed with Whatman filter paper. Cells or sacculi

532

were then negatively stained with 10 µl 1% uranyl acetate (UA) and excess UA liquid

533

was immediately removed with Whatman filter paper. Grids were allowed to dry, stored

534

in a grid holder in a desiccation chamber, and imaged with a kV JEOL JEM 1010

535

transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc.). Protein visualization was performed

536

as sacculi suspension except protein was applied to the grid for 1 min and stained with

537

2% UA before imaging.

538

Sacculi purification

539

Strains were inoculated in 3 ml PYE from colonies and grown at 26°C with shaking until

540

late-exponential phase. Cultures were then washed 2X with ddH2O, diluted 1:50 in

541

HIGG, and grown at 26°C with shaking for 72h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation

542

(7,000 g, 4°C, 15 min) and resuspended in 10 ml ddH2O. Cell suspension was added

543

dropwise to 20 ml boiling 7.5% SDS in a 125 ml flask with a stir bar. Once cells addition

544

was complete, the SDS cell suspension was boiled for 30 min with stirring and then

545

allowed to cool to room temperature. Suspension was then washed 6X with ddH2O

546

using centrifugation (100,000 g, 25°C, 30 min) to isolate the sacculi pellet and

547

resuspended in 5 ml ddH2O before imaging.

548

Protein purification

549

Recombinant plasmids overproducing His6-BacA protein were transformed into BL21 E.

550

coli strain. Transformants were grown, in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50

551

µg ml-1), at 37°C until the OD600 = 0.6. Expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG

552

(isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and incubation was continued either 3h at 30°C

553

or overnight at 20°C. Cells pellets were resuspended in 1/25 volume of Buffer A

554

(TrisHCl at pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication (20

555

sec On / 40 sec Off, 5 min, Misonix S4000). Cells debris were pelleted by centrifugation

556

at 36,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded on a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen)

557

on an AKTA FPLC pure system. After washing with Buffer A, the protein was eluted with

558

a linear gradient of Buffer B (50 mM TrisHCl at pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-

559

mercaptoethanol, 500 mM imidazole). Elution fraction was loaded on SDS page gel and

560

peak fractions containing the protein were pooled. Upon purification, His6-BacA protein

561

was used for polymerization assay. Polymerization assay were performed by dialyzing

562

His6-BacA in Buffer C (25 mM TrisHCl at pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol)

563

supplemented with 10% Triton X-100 in the case of BacA.

564

Image analysis

565

Stalk length and stalk percentage data was obtained using FIJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) [54].

566

Briefly, phase micrographs were imported into FIJI and stalks were manually traced

567

using the "Freehand Line" tool. Stalks lengths were determined from the manual trace

568

using the "Measure" function, calibrated to the µm/pixel scale of the original micrograph.

569

The percentage of stalked cells per image was calculated by manually counting the

570

number of stalked and non-stalked cells per image. Subcellular localization of SpmX-

571

eGFP and BacA-mVenus foci and subsequent localization heatmaps were generated

572

using the ImageJ plugin MicrobeJ [55]. SpmX-eGFP maxima area and intensity were

573

determined using the ImageJ plugin MicrobeJ [55]. Area was first generated as pixel

574

area and converted to nm2 based on the pixel to µm ratio for the images. Intensity is

575

defined as the average gray value measured on the channel used to detect the particle.

576

Analysis of BacA-mVenus time-lapse movies and BacA-mVenus foci dynamics was

577

performed using the ImageJ plugin TrackMate [56]. All statistical analysis and data

578

visualization was generated in R version 3.5 [57] and using the ggplot2 [58] and ggsignif

579

[59] packages.

excluded. Data (total cells counted: WT n=735; WT+EV n=615; ΔbacA n=841; ΔbacA+EV n=1259;

n=153; ΔbacA+EV n=148; ΔbacA+ PbacA-bacA n=324) are from three independent biological replicates
with five phase microscopy fields per replicate. Data is plotted on a log10 scale y-axis and are
represented as box and whisker plots [62] where the middle line represents the median, the lower and
upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles), and the upper
whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR
is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends
from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers
are called "outlying" points and are plotted individually. A mirrored density violin plot [63] is underlayed to
show the continuous distribution of the data. As length data is approximately log-normally distributed,
significant difference testing was performed on log10 transformed data (***p ≤ 0.001, ns = not significant;
two-sided t-test)

ΔbacA n=8; ΔbacA+EV n=13; ΔbacA+ PbacA-bacA n= 17) are from single samples with five TEM fields per

Transformants were then grown in selective medium containing 0.5 mM IPTG and patched on selective
indicator plates containing X-gal 40 µg ml-1 and 0.5 mM IPTG for ~24 hours at 30°C (see Methods). As
this is a β-galactosidase assay, blue patches indicate a positive in vivo interaction between the two
recombinant proteins. Positive control ("+ Crtl") for all assays is T25-Zip and T18-Zip fusion proteins.
Negative controls are unfused T18 or T25 fragments in combination with the experimental fusion protein
or the cognate unfused T25 or T18 fragments. Patches shown are representative of independent

Supplemental Table 1 – Proteins involved in stalk synthesis. At the time this study was initiated, four
C. crescentus proteins (BacA, BacB, PbpC, and StpX) had been shown to be involved in stalk synthesis.
Of these four, only one (BacA) had a bi-directional best hit homolog in A. biprosthecum. The one A.
biprosthecum protein involved in stalk synthesis (SpmX) has a C. crescentus homolog, but in C.
crescentus this protein is involved in cell cycle regulation and not stalk synthesis.
