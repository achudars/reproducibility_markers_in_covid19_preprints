Abstract

28

While many disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with

29

gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs), a large proportion of complex

30

disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants are of unknown function. Some of

31

these SNPs may contribute to disease by regulating gene splicing. Here, we investigate whether

32

SNPs that are associated with alternative splicing (splice QTL or sQTL) can identify novel

33

functions for existing GWAS variants or suggest new associated variants in chronic obstructive

34

pulmonary disease (COPD).

35

RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood from 376 subjects from the COPDGene

36

Study. Using linear models, we identified 561,060 unique sQTL SNPs associated with 30,333

37

splice sites corresponding to 6,419 unique genes. Similarly, 708,928 unique eQTL SNPs

38

involving 15,913 genes were detected at 10% FDR. While there is overlap between sQTLs and

39

eQTLs, 60% of sQTLs are not eQTLs. Co-localization analysis revealed that 7 out of 21 loci

40

associated with COPD (p<1x10 ) in a published GWAS have at least one shared causal variant

41

between the GWAS and sQTL studies. Among the genes identified to have splice sites

42

associated with top GWAS SNPs was FBXO38, in which a novel exon was discovered to be

43

protective against COPD. Importantly, the sQTL in this locus was validated by qPCR in both

44

blood and lung tissue, demonstrating that splice variants relevant to lung tissue can be

45

identified in blood. Other identified genes included CDK11A and SULT1A2.

46

-6

Overall, these data indicate that analysis of alternative splicing can provide novel

47

insights into disease mechanisms. In particular, we demonstrated that SNPs in a known COPD

48

GWAS locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene FBXO38.

Author Summary

51

While it is known that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused in part by

52

genetic factors, few studies have identified specific causative genes. Genetic variants that alter

53

the expression levels of genes have explained part of the genetic component of COPD,

54

however, there are additional genetic variants with unknown function. In some genes the

55

protein coding sequence can be altered by a mechanism known as RNA splicing. We

56

hypothesized that some genetic variants that are associated with risk of COPD contribute to the

57

disease by altering RNA splicing. In this study, we identified genetic variants that are associated

58

both with COPD risk and RNA splicing. In particular, we found that a COPD associated variant of

59

previously unknown function may contribute to the inclusion of a new exon in the FBXO38

60

gene. These finding are significant because they indicate that analysis of RNA splicing can help

61

identify genes that contribute to disease.

Introduction

65

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible airflow

66

obstruction. While cigarette smoking is the leading environmental risk factor for COPD, only a

67

subset of smokers develop the disease. Genetic factors have been shown to contribute to

68

COPD susceptibility, with the best characterized example being SERPINA1, the causal gene for

69

α1-antitrypsin deficiency (1-5).

70

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify common genetic

71

variants associated with many complex diseases, including COPD. These studies have identified

72

multiple well-replicated genome-wide significant loci, including a locus on 15q25

73

(CHRNA3/CHRNA5/IREB2), FAM13A, HHIP, CYP2A6 and HTR4 (6-10). In addition, a recent large

74

meta-analysis identified twenty-two genome-wide significant loci in COPD, of which 13 were

75

newly genome-wide significant (11). However, the majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms

76

(SNPs) that have been identified in COPD GWAS are of unknown function. Since most GWAS

77

variants are located in noncoding regions, it is likely that these variants contribute to COPD

78

susceptibility through transcriptional regulation of target genes.

79

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have been used to identify SNPs that

80

contribute to gene expression levels, thereby validating GWAS associations in addition to

81

providing insight into the biological mechanism responsible. To date, only a moderate

82

percentage of GWAS findings have been shown to be eQTLs with strong effect size (12). This is

83

likely due to a variety of mechanisms including inadequate sample size, multiple testing

84

correction, tissue type investigated, as well as the focus on total gene-level expression levels

85

without consideration of transcript isoforms.

86

COPD has been shown to have a disproportionate amount of alternative splicing

87

compared to other complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and

88

Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that transcriptional regulation through splicing may play an

89

important role (13). Genetic variation could contribute by altering mRNA splicing, which in turn

90

could result in changes in protein sequence or expression levels. Several recent studies have

91

demonstrated that SNPs associated with alternative splicing (sQTLs) are enriched for GWAS

92

variants. Evidence suggests that at least 20-30% of disease causing mutations may affect pre-

93

mRNA splicing (14, 15). Furthermore, several reports have discovered that there are a

94

proportion of GWAS SNPs that have evidence of sQTLs but not eQTLs, indicating that sQTL

95

analysis can provide additional insight into the functional mechanisms underlying GWAS results

96

(16) (17, 18).

97

Here, we characterize sQTLs in human peripheral blood in COPD to determine whether

98

these loci can identify novel functions for COPD GWAS variants. We hypothesize that a

99

substantial fraction of COPD GWAS loci influence disease susceptibility through sQTLs. Previous

100

studies to identify sQTLs have been performed in small sample sizes or have focused on exon

101

expression instead of differential exon usage (16). This study characterizes variants associated

102

with differential exon usage in a large population.

Materials and Methods:

106

Study Population

107

This study included 376 non-Hispanic white subjects from the COPDGene study. COPDGene

108

enrolled individuals between the ages of 45 and 80 years with a minimum of 10 pack-years of

109

lifetime smoking history from 21 centers across the United States (19). These subjects returned

110

for a second study visit 5 years after the initial visit at which time they completed additional

111

questionnaires, pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry, computed tomography of the chest,

112

and provided blood for complete blood counts (CBCs) and RNA sequencing. In this study,

113

moderate to severe COPD was defined as GOLD spirometric grades 2-4 (20).

114

RNASeq data acquisition and processing

115

The protocol for RNASeq data generation has been previously described (21). Total RNA was

116

extracted from PAXgene Blood RNA tubes using the Qiagen PreAnalytiX PAXgene Blood miRNA

117

Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracted samples with a RIN > 7 and concentration > =25ug/uL

118

were included in sequencing. Globin reduction, ribosomal RNA depletion and cDNA library

119

prep was performed using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Globin kit (Illumina,

120

Inc., San Diego, CA). The Illumina HiSeq 2500 was used to generate 75 bp reads, and an average

121

of 20 million reads were generated per sample.

122

Read alignment, mappability filtering and quality control

123

Reads were trimmed using skewer (22) to remove specified TruSeq adapter sequences. Quality

124

control was performed using the FASTQC (23) and RNA-SeQC (24) programs. Trimmed reads

125

were aligned to the GRCh37 reference genome using a two-pass alignment method with STAR

126

2.5 (25). Following sequence alignment, mappability filtering to correct for allelic bias in read

127

mapping was performed using WASP (26). An average of 840,000 reads were removed due to

128

read mapping bias resulting in an average of 19.9 million reads being available for subsequent

129

analysis.

130

Genotyping

131

Genotyping was performed by Illumina (San Diego, CA) on the HumanOmniExpress Array. Eagle

132

v. 2.3 was used for phasing and HRC reference panel version 1.1 was used for imputation. SNPs

133

with minor allele frequency greater than 0.05 and imputation R greater than 0.5 were included

134

in analysis (9, 11).

135

Quantification of Splicing Ratios and Gene Expression Counts

136

Gene expression counts were computed using Rsubread (27). Quantification of splicing ratios

137

was performed using Leafcutter (17). This method extracts junctional reads (or reads that span

138

introns) from aligned bam files and clusters them according to shared start or stop positions.

139

Default leafcutter parameters were used in the detection of clusters, i.e., 50 split reads across

140

all individuals were required to support each cluster, and introns up to 500 kb were included.

141

For sQTL analysis, intron ratios were calculated by determining how many reads support a given

142

exon-intron junction in relation to the number of reads in that region. Introns used in less than

143

40% of individuals were filtered out, and the remaining intron ratios were used as input for

144

sQTL analysis.

145

eQTL and sQTL Analysis

146

MatrixeQTL (28) was used to test for association between genotype of all SNPs within 1000 kb

147

of a gene (cis-) and quantifications of gene expression or alternative splicing using linear

148

models, adjusting for age, gender, pack-years of smoking, current smoking status, white blood

150

A total of 5,405,234 SNPs were tested for association with 25,313 genes and 97,365 splice sites.

151

SNP lookup and colocalization analysis

152

COPD-associated SNPs were obtained from a subset of a published GWAS (11). We selected

153

920 SNPs with p<1 x 10 in white subjects to match the ethnicity of the RNA-Seq data. These

154

SNPs were grouped into 21 loci based on their genomic positions. SNPs that were associated

155

with splicing at the 10% FDR, or with gene expression at the 10% FDR were identified. The 10%

156

FDR threshold was selected based on published sQTL studies (18, 29). Co-localization analysis

157

was performed for GWAS loci that contained sQTLs using eCAVIAR (30).

158

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) of FBXO38

159

Thirty COPDGene blood samples were selected for qPCR based on expression levels in RNASeq

160

data. An additional ninety resected lung tissue samples from individuals undergoing thoracic

161

surgery (31) were selected based on genotype. A total of 400 ng of RNA was reverse

162

transcribed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific,

163

Waltham, MA) for blood RNA or the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) for lung

164

RNA. A Taqman assay was designed to amplify cDNA fragments from the 3’ region of the

165

cryptic FBX038 exon, to the 5’ region of exon 10 (Supplementary Figure 1). A predesigned

166

Taqman assay (Hs01004563_mH) was used to amplify the alternate isoforms from the 3’ region

167

of exon 9 to the 5’ region of exon 10. A final amount of 30 ng of cDNA was amplified per well,

168

and each sample was assayed in triplicate.

171

Linear regression was performed to test for an additive relationship between genotype and

172

splicing ratio.

173

Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitation

174

Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mMTris pH 7.5, 120 mMNaCl, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented

175

with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase

176

inhibitor cocktail set I and II, Calbiochem). The protein concentrations of lysates were measured

177

by the Beckman Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.

178

Same amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with

179

indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, 1000 μg whole cell lysates were incubated with

180

the indicated anti-Flag M2 affinity gel and monoclonal anti-HA agarose for 3-4 hr at 4 degree

181

(Millipore Sigma). Immunoprecipitants were washed five times with NETN buffer (20 mMTris,

182

pH 8.0, 100 mMNaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40) before being resolved by SDS-PAGE and

Results:
Identification of sQTLs and eQTLs in human peripheral blood
This analysis included 376 Non-Hispanic white COPDGene participants (Supplementary Table 1).
Samples were sequenced to a depth of approximately 20 million reads per sample, and splice
ratios from a total of 97,365 splice clusters (defined as overlapping introns that share a spice
donor or acceptor site) were included in the sQTL analysis. Gene expression counts for 25,312
genes were used for eQTL detection.
We identified 1,706,704 cis-sQTLs at 10% FDR, comprising 561,060 unique SNPs
(Supplementary Table 2). These SNPs were associated with 30,333 splice sites which were
annotated to 6742 unique genes (Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, we identified 1,242,993
cis-eQTLs corresponding to 708,928 unique SNPs. These SNPs were associated with expression
of 15,913 genes. We found that 44.6% of sQTLs were also eQTLs, but that 55.3% (310,361
SNPs) were sQTLs exclusively. In addition, 2299 genes contained at least one splice site that
was significantly associated with genotype of a neighboring SNP, while total gene expression of
the same gene was not significantly associated with any SNP. This suggests that analysis of
sQTLs can identify novel regulatory events that are not captured through whole gene
expression analysis.

Pathway analysis of genes with sQTLs
To characterize the biological functions of genes for which alternative splicing was associated
with nearby SNPs, Sigora (32) was used to identify overrepresented pathways in genes that had
sQTLs but not eQLTs . This method of pathway analysis focuses on genes or gene pairs that are
specific to a single pathway. In this way it utilizes the status of other genes in the experimental

context to identify the most relevant pathways and minimize the identification of spurious
pathways. To minimize the number of input genes, a conservative FDR cutoff of 5% was
applied in the identification of genes with sQTLs. We identified 1752 genes which had
significant sQTLs but not eQTLs at the 5% FDR. These genes were enriched for 20 KEGG
pathways and 33 Reactome pathways (Supplementary Table 5 and 6), mostly related to RNA
processing.

Functional categories of cis eQTLs and sQTLs
Both eQTLs and sQTLs were categorized on the basis of their location relative to the gene with
which they were associated, and the results are shown in Table 1. The genomic distribution of
sQTLs and eQTLs was similar, with the majority located in intergenic (38% of sQTLs and 41% of
eQTLs) and intronic (50% of sQTLs and 46% of eQTLs) regions. Only a small number of sQTLs
(n=68) and eQTLs (n=74) were located in splice sites, defined as within an intron and 2 bp of an
exon/intron boundary. In addition, we identified 7 sQTLs and 3 eQTLs located within an exon
and 2 bp of an exon/intron boundary.

Identification of genetic loci containing both GWAS associated SNPs and sQTLs
sQTLs were at least as enriched among low p-value associations with COPD case status as eQTLs
(Supplementary Figure 2). To identify whether sQTLs can identify functions for GWAS SNPs
that could not be explained by eQTLs alone, 920 SNPs associated with COPD in white subjects
with a p <1 x 10 were grouped into 21 genetic loci according to genomic position (Table 2).

These SNPs were then interrogated in the eQTL and sQTL data sets to identify which GWAS
SNPs were also associated with alternative splicing or gene expression at 10% FDR. Of these
920 SNPs, 67 SNPs

were both sQTLs and eQTLs, 71 SNPs were eQTLs alone, and 156 were sQTLs alone, indicating
that a greater number of GWAS SNPs are sQTLs than eQTLs. Out of the 21 genomic loci, 6
included GWAS-associated SNPs that were eQTLs, and 7 included GWAS SNPs that were sQTLs
(Table 2). There were three loci that contained sQTLs but not eQTLs for any gene

Colocalization analysis of SNPs in HTR4/FBXO38
To investigate whether GWAS associations may be attributed to alternative splicing,

colocalization analysis was performed using eCAVIAR in the seven genetic loci containing both

GWAS SNPs and sQTLs (Table 3). All seven of the GWAS loci had at least one variant with

significant colocalization to sQTL data (colocalization posterior probability

[CLPP] > 0.01) (Table

3 and Supplementary Table 4 ). The locus with the strongest colocalization between either

GWAS & sQTL or GWAS & eQTL was located in the 5q32 region containing

HTR4/FBXO38

. This

region was identified in the COPD case control GWAS, with 151 SNPs with p-value < 1x10

rs3995091 SNP located in the

gene had the lowest p-value (2.59 x 10

revealed that rs7730971 colocalized with the sQTL and GWAS data (CLPP = 0.845) (Figure 1b),

while there was no colocalization with eQTLs for

FBXO38

, suggesting that the GWAS association

may be caused be alternative splicing. Furthermore, eCAVIAR identified rs7730971 to be the

SNP with the highest degree of colocalization between sQTL and GWAS data, suggesting that

this may be the causative variant (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Despite being the

GWAS SNP with the minimal p-value in the locus, there was no colocalization between sQTL and

GWAS data for rs3995091 (CLPP=0.002). Characterization of the splicing cluster associated with

genotype of rs7730971 revealed a previously unannotated cryptic exon located at chromosome

16: 147,790,643 - 147,790,801. This 158 bp exon is present in a greater proportion of subjects

with the GG genotype (13%) than the CC genotype (8%) (Figure 1c). The CC genotype is also

associated with greater risk of COPD, so the novel isoform may be protective against COPD.

Quantitative PCR independently validated the existence of the novel exon as well as replicated

the effect of genotype on exon inclusion levels in RNA from whole blood(p=0.01, Figure 1d).

Furthermore, the novel exon was identified in RNA from homogenized lung tissue, where

splicing levels were also associated with rs7730971 genotype (p=0.007)(Figure 1d). The cryptic

exon leads to a premature stop codon in

FBXO38

, which could alter or inhibit protein function.

Additionally, immunoprecipitation was performed in 293T cells which indicated that FBXO38,

an F-box protein with unknown substrates, interacts with Cullin 1, but not other Cullin

members (Supplementary Figure 4), indicating that it may be a component of a SKP1-Cullin-1-F-

box (SCF) type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In combination, these findings suggest that the

GWAS association at 5q32 may be partly explained by the inclusion of an exon which results in a

truncated FBXO38 protein.

Discussion
eQTL studies can provide insight into the biological mechanisms responsible for disease

associations. While many disease-associated SNPs are eQTLs, a large proportion of GWAS

variants are of unknown function. SNPs that are associated with transcript isoform variation

may contribute to disease risk and explain additional GWAS associations. In this study, we

characterized eQTLs and sQTLs in human peripheral blood to identify novel functions for COPD

GWAS associations. Among the genes identified to have splice sites associated with GWAS SNPs

were

CDK11A

, which may be of biological relevance for COPD due to its role in apoptosis;

SULT1A2

which has both eQTLs and sQTLs which strongly colocalize to the GWAS signal; and of

particular interest,

FBXO38

, in which a novel exon is protective against COPD.

Although we found a larger number of eQTLs than sQTLs genome wide (708,928 vs

561,060 unique SNPs), a greater number of COPD GWAS SNPs were sQTLs (156/920) than

eQTLs (89/920) This phenomenon has previously been shown in multiple sclerosis, where

GWAS SNPs were more highly enriched among sQTLs than eQTLs (17). Furthermore, several

studies have shown that sQTL analyses can uncover functions for GWAS-associated

polymorphisms that would not have been identified through eQTL analysis alone. Zhang et al.

found that 4.5% of GWAS SNPs from the GWAS catalog had evidence of cis-sQTLs but not cis-

eQTLs (16). Li et al. showed that sQTLs identified in lymphoblastoid cell lines are enriched

among autoimmune-disease associated variants (18). Another study demonstrated (17) that

there were similar levels of enrichment of both eQTLs and sQTLs among SNPs associated with

rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, Li et al. showed that in an analysis of rheumatoid arthritis, the

inclusion of intronic splicing data allowed for the identification of 18 putative disease genes, of

which 13 would not have been associated on the basis of gene-expression level measurements

alone (17).

We identified seven top loci from GWAS that contained SNPs that colocalized with

sQTLs. Of these loci, three could only be explained by sQTLs and not eQTLs. Of particular

interest was the association at 5q32 in which SNPs in

HTR4

were associated with COPD case-

control status. This is a well-replicated GWAS association for lung function (33-35), COPD (11,

36) and airflow obstruction in smokers (10).

as prior studies identifying

HTR4

Despite the consistent genetic association, as well

expression in developing lung and increased airways resistance

in a murine model, the mechanism by which the specific SNPs contribute to COPD risk is

unknown, and additional genes in the region have not been investigated. Our analysis revealed

that these SNPs may contribute to COPD by regulating splicing of a neighboring gene,

FBXO38

.

This is consistent with evidence that the nearest gene to an associated SNP is the causative

gene in only a minority of cases (37, 38). Therefore, analyses such as eQTL and sQTL studies are

critical to uncover a relationship between an implicated SNP and the gene responsible for the

association.

FBXO38

The characterization of splicing in F-box protein 38 (

) resulted in the discovery of

a cryptic exon which has not been previously annotated. Through qPCR we were able to

validate the existence of the exon as well as replicate the association with genotype in both

blood and lung tissue. This is of particular importance as it demonstrates that analysis of

splicing in the blood can uncover sQTLs that are also relevant to the lung. Sequence analysis

using ORF Finder (39) determined that this newly identified transcript encodes a premature

stop codon in the cryptic exon. This will result in a truncated protein that could have altered

structure and function. To date, relatively little is known about the biological processes as well

as the downstream signaling pathways through which FBXO38 operates to possibly influence

COPD. Furthermore, no known ubiquitin substrate has been identified for FBXO38, which

makes FBXO38 one of the orphan F-box proteins. Here we identified Cullin-1 as a binding

partner for FBXO38. Therefore, the biological role of FBXO38 may rely mostly on its biochemical

feature as an E3 ligase, through the formation of a complex with Cullin-1 and Skp1, similar to its

family members Skp2 and Fbw7 (40, 41).

and autoimmune diseases like diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease; the inversion allele

itself has been shown to be protective against the joint occurrence of asthma and obesity(52).

There are 24 polymorphisms that have been shown accurately tag the inversion (52). The

expression is among these markers, and is in LD with the inversion (R =0.982). However, since

both the SNP and the associated splice sites are located within the inversion, it is unlikely that

inversion alters or contributes to this regulation of splicing.

Finally, we identified the

CDK11A

gene as a novel COPD candidate gene in the 1p36.32

locus. Here, SNPs were associated with the occurrence of a single exon in the

CDK11A

CDK11A

gene.

This kinase can be

cleaved by caspases and may play a role in cell apoptosis (53, 54), which is a key dysregulated

pathway in COPD (55, 56). As this locus did not reach genome-wide significance in the larger

GWAS, additional studies will be needed to confirm the phenotypic association.

Most polymorphisms that were associated with splicing were acting from a distance,

and were not located within or close to the splice donor or acceptor site.

The majority of sQTLs

(88%) were located in intronic or intergenic regions, and only 0.01% percent were located

within splice sites. Furthermore, out of the seven GWAS loci that were discovered to have

sQTLs, the most likely causative SNP was located greater than 500bp from the splice site in all

cases. The mechanism by which these SNPs act on splicing is likely complex, but may involve

auxiliary splicing regulatory elements such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), intronic splicing

enhancers (ISEs), exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs). These

regulatory elements control splicing through the recruitment of trans-acting factors that

interact with other regulatory factors or core spliceosome components (57, 58).

A potential limitation of this study is that our eQTLs and sQTLs were identified in whole

blood samples. COPD is a respiratory disease, and the most relevant cell-types in which to

study gene expression changes may be located in the lung. However, due to the strong

inflammatory component of COPD, characterization of gene expression and splicing in immune

cells also has biological relevance. In addition, there is a high proportion of sQTL sharing across

tissues (59), which has been recently supported by the finding that 75-93% of sQTLs are

replicated across tissue pairs from the GTEx consortium, with the estimated level of sharing

between whole blood and lung being 92% (17). Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the

sQTLs identified in peripheral blood are also sQTLs in lung tissue. Furthermore, we

experimentally demonstrated that the association with

FBXO38

splicing is also present in lung

tissue, and therefore the mechanism discovered in whole blood is likely to also be of relevance

in the lung. Another potential limitation is that peripheral blood samples contain a mixture of

cell types, any of which could contribute to gene expression signals.

We included white blood

cell percentages as a covariate in eQTL and sQTL analyses to limit potential confounding by

differences in cell proportions. An additional limitation of this study is the depth of sequencing

of approximately 20 million reads per sample. This read depth was selected to maximize

sequencing value within a large genetic epidemiology study. In order to be able capture the

effect of genotype on gene expression and splicing, a large sample size was required, and

therefore there was a tradeoff to be made between sequencing depth and sample size. While

this could lead to the failure to capture rare splicing events, the goal of the study was to

capture common splicing variations associated with genotype, which this design allowed us to

do.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the eCAVIAR calculation of CLPP is dependent on

sample size as well as effect size of the eQTL/sQTL. As previously shown (30), an increase in

sample size, or an increase in effect size results in higher CLPP values, and thus there is more

power to detect colocalization with a larger sample size, or with eQTLs/sQTLs of strong effect.

This means that while we may have been able to detect additional colocalization with a larger

sample size, this does not impact our confidence in the CLPP values we have calculated here.

In conclusion, we found that many SNPs were associated with alternative splicing in

peripheral blood. More COPD-associated variants were sQTLs than eQTLs, and we identified

variant associations with splice sites in three genes including

FBXO38

, an orphan F-box protein,

which have a function role in COPD through an effect as an E3 ligase on a currently unknown

substrate. These data indicate that analysis of alternative splicing may provide novel insights

into disease mechanisms.
