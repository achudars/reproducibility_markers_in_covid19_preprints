Abstract

11

Bees efficiently learn asocial and social cues to optimize foraging from fluctuating

12

floral resources. However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of

13

social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees’ natural preferences

14

for asocial cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we

15

investigated honeybees’ (Apis mellifera) inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers

16

based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from

17

conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honeybees’ preferences for flowers were

18

recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type have declined and novel-

19

coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or

20

one conspecific and one heterospecific (Bombus terrestris), each foraging from a

21

different coloured flower (either magenta or yellow). Honeybees were found to have a

22

natural preference for magenta flowers. Social information affected honeybees’

23

inspection time of both types of flowers, i.e., honeybees modified their approaching

24

flights to yellow and magenta flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific

25

social information. The presence of either demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow

26

flower increased honeybees’ inspection time of yellow flowers. Conspecific social

27

information influenced observers’ foraging choices of yellow flowers, thus outweighing

28

their original preference for magenta flowers, such an influence was not elicited by

29

heterospecific social information. Our results indicate that flower colour preferences of

30

honeybees are rapidly adjusted in response to conspecific social information, which in

31

turn is preferred over heterospecific information, thus favouring the transmission of

32

adaptive foraging information within species.

Foraging decisions are central to an animal’s survival and reproduction; deciding

51

where to forage in unpredictably changing environments is a major challenge that

52

animals constantly encounter (Stephens et al. 2007). Foraging decisions can be

53

influenced in a context-dependant manner (Laland 2004; Kendal et al. 2009) by innate

54

preferences (Raine et al. 2006), previous individual experience (Sclafani 1995), and the

55

observation or interaction with another animals at a foraging resource, i.e., social

56

information (Heyes 1994; Hoppitt and Laland 2013). For example, naïve individuals

57

tend to rely more on social than individual information to gain familiarity about

58

foraging sources (Galef and Giraldeau 2001; Galef and Laland 2005). Conversely,

59

experienced individuals that have information on an advantageous foraging resource,

60

will often ignore social cues. Thus, social information is only draw upon when

61

individual information has become outdated and acquiring up to date information may

62

be costly (Laland 2004; Galef and Laland 2005; Kendal et al. 2009). The influence of

63

social information on foraging decisions is taxonomically widespread (Galef and

64

Giraldeau 2001; Valone and Templeton 2002; Grüter and Leadbeater 2014). Social

65

information allows animals to find profitable foraging resources efficiently, instead of

66

iteratively sampling the environment through trial and error (Galef and Laland 2005).

67

In most animal communities, multiple species frequently share the same

68

foraging resources; thus members of the same (conspecific) and different

69

(heterospecific) species can potentially act as sources and users of social information

70

(Seppänen et al. 2007; Goodale et al. 2010; Avarguès‐Weber et al. 2013; Parejo and

71

Avilés 2016). Using social information indiscriminately is not adaptive but animals

72

should be selective when acquiring information from other individuals (Laland 2004;

73

Kendal et al. 2018). In a multi-species context, animals have access to social

74

information from different sources, which may give rise to a trade-off between selecting

75

sources with a close ecological similarity, implying high competition, or sources whose

76

ecological distance may involve less competition but a lower informative value

77

(Seppänen et al. 2007). Furthermore, in a foraging context, social information has to be

78

integrated with unlearned preferences (Laland and Plotkin 1993; Leadbeater and Chittka

79

2007a; Jones et al. 2015) and existing individual information (van Bergen Yfke et al.

80

2004; Jones et al. 2015) to determine foraging decisions in a context-dependant manner

81

(Laland 2004; Kendal et al. 2009).

82

Social bee workers forage for nectar and pollen from rapidly changing floral

83

resources (Heinrich 1979; Chittka et al. 1999) within multi-species communities (Fægri

84

and Van der Pijl 1979; Kevan and Baker 1983) that might offer a wide spectrum of

85

social information. This makes bees a valuable model to explore how different sources

86

of social information can affect learned and unlearned preferences of individuals to

87

shape foraging decisions. Traditionally, the laboratory paradigms that investigate the

88

use of social information in bees tend to oversimplify the real field contexts where

89

animals naturally acquire information from others. For example, they test bees in

90

relatively unnatural settings where a single source of social information is presented,

91

e.g., a dead demonstrator pinned to simulated flowers (reviewed in Leadbeater and

92

Dawson 2017). Contrastingly, bees seeking nectar and pollen in the wild might

93

encounter far more complex circumstances where they have access to multiple sources

94

of social information (Fægri and Van der pijl 1979; Kevan and Baker 1983) that may

95

concur in time and space and diverge in their intrinsic relevance.

96

Honeybees and bumblebees are sympatric species that typically forage upon

97

similar flowers due to their generalist diet (Rogers et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2016). Previous

98

evidence indicates that bumblebees can acquire foraging information from dead

99

demonstrator honeybees (Dawson and Chittka 2012). However, in more realistic

100

conditions, a bee forager whose known floral resources have decreased in reward levels,

101

will likely concur with other foragers, of their own and different species, feeding from

102

different types of flowers (Fægri and Van der Pijl 1979; Kevan and Baker 1983). It

103

remains unclear how bees respond to such divergent social information, and whether in

104

this context, social cues might modify bees’ natural preferences for particular colours in

105

flowers (Chittka et al. 2004; Raine et al. 2006; Raine and Chittka 2007), hence affecting

106

foraging decisions. We address these questions by testing whether honeybees might

107

adjust their colour preferences in response to simultaneous sources of social

108

information, i.e., a conspecific and heterospecific, each foraging from either a preferred

109

or non-preferred flower type.

110

MATERIALS AND METHODS

111

(a) Set-up

112

We used free-flying honeybee foragers (Apis mellifera) of two different colonies

113

(Colonies A and B) for experiments. Over two consecutive summers (2017-2018), we

114

trained foragers (one colony per year) to collect 30% sucrose solution (w/w) from a

115

gravity feeder located 2 m away from their hive. The gravity feeder attracted foragers

116

from neighboring hives, thus individuals for experiments could have come from at least

117

three additional hives. In addition, we used bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) foragers

118

from two colonies (Biobest, Belgium N.V.) for the experiments. Bumblebee nests were

119

housed in bipartite wooden nest-boxes (l = 29.5 × w = 11.5 × h = 9.5 cm) connected to a

120

wooden flight arena (l = 77 cm, w = 52 cm, h = 30 cm) by a Plexiglas tunnel (l = 25 cm,

121

3.5 × 3.5 cm). The floor of the flight arena was covered in white laminated paper. Three

122

plastic sliding doors located along the corridor allowed controlled access to the arena.

123

Before and after experiments, bumblebees could freely feed upon 30% (w/w) sucrose

124

solution from a mass feeder in the middle of the arena. Bumblebee colonies were

125

provided with 7 g of frozen pollen (Koppert B.V., The Netherlands) every two days.

126
127

(b) Training of honeybees

128

Training of demonstrators and observers took place over 18 daily sessions. Each

129

day, five foraging honeybees (demonstrators) from the gravity feeder were lured to and

130

trained to enter the wooden flight arena located outdoors. The five honeybees were

131

group trained, i.e. allowed to enter the arena together at various times, to learn to forage

132

upon an array of twelve plastic chips (2.4 × 2.4 cm, henceforth “flowers”) placed on the

133

top of transparent glass vials (h = 4 cm), positioned on the floor of the arena. The array

134

was arranged in a rectangular grid formation (3 × 4) with a separation of 7.5 cm

135

between the edges of the flowers. We filled four yellow flowers with 10 μL of

136

rewarding 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, and four magenta and four transparent flowers

137

with 10 μL of unrewarding water (Figure 1A). Flowers were refilled after they were

138

depleted by foragers and the foragers left the flower. Half of the foragers experienced

139

the opposite color-reinforcement contingency. We identified trained individuals by

140

marking their thorax with a white paint mark (Posca Pen, Worcester, UK). Three hours

141

after concluding the demonstrator’s training, we selected a separate batch of five

142

foragers (observers) that we trained them on a different set-up. Every day, observers

143

were group trained to enter the same arena and forage upon a rectangular grid array of

144

twelve transparent flowers (3 × 4) (Figure 1C). To encourage honeybee foragers to

145

sample multiple flowers during their foraging trips, only half of the flowers contained

146

40 μL of 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, whereas the other half contained 40 μL of water.

147

Rewarding flowers were replenished after emptied and the forager left the flower, and

148

the positions of all the flowers were changed every 10 minutes over 1 hour of training.

149

We marked trained observers with a green dot to distinguish them from the

150

demonstrators. After each training session, we cleaned the flowers and the arena floor

151

with 70% ethanol.

152
153
154

(c) Training of bumblebees
In the same flight arena where honeybees were trained, bumblebee foragers

155

(demonstrators) from two colonies were separately trained in group. In this training, the

156

colour-reinforcement contingency was reversed so that bumblebees learned to forage on

157

flowers of the opposite colour that honeybees were trained on. Half of the bumblebees

158

experienced four magenta flowers with 40 μL of 50% (w/w) sucrose solution, and four

159

yellow and four transparent flowers with 40 μL of water (Figure 1B). The other half of

160

the bumblebees experienced the reverse color-reinforcement contingency. Rewarding

161

flowers were refilled after depleted by the foragers and the foragers left the flower.

162

Training took place for one day over 2 hours. We also carried out a refreshment bout

163

(20 min) each day before testing. We tracked demonstrator bees’ identity with

164

individual number tags (Opalithplättchen, Warnholz & Bienenvoigt, Ellerau, Germany)

165

glued to the top of the thorax by means of Loctite Super Glue Gel (Loctite, Ohio, US).

166

The floor of the arena and flowers were cleaned with 70% ethanol after completing

167

training.

168
169

(d) Testing the effect of color preference on honeybees’ foraging decisions

170

After each training session, we selected two honeybees trained on transparent

171

flowers, twenty-one subjects overall, and evaluate them individually in a control test

172

where transparent flowers were unrewarding to assess whether they might show a

173

preference to explore and forage from one flower type between two unfamiliar

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.874917; this version posted December 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this

174

alternatives, i.e., yellow and magenta. One honeybee was let in the arena to explore a

175

rectangular grid array of twelve flowers (section b, above), consisting of four familiar

176

transparent flowers containing 20 μL of water and eight unfamiliar flowers, four yellow

177

and four magenta, all filled with a scentless reward of 20 μL of 50% (w/w) sucrose

178

solution, (Figure 1D). The test began once the individual inspected any flower. That is,

179

the honeybee approached the flower with its head oriented towards it and displayed a

180

slow side-to-side hover within at least one body length (Ings et al. 2009). Individuals

181

were given up to 3 min to land and forage upon any unfamiliar flower, before the test

182

concluded. As this test was designed to evaluate the influence of honeybees’ colour

183

preferences on an actual foraging decision, rather than measuring their innate colour

184

preferences, we regarded the flower type where the individual landed and foraged as

185

preferred over the alternative type. To prevent re-testing the same individuals, we

186

captured honeybees, after concluding the test, to give them a distinctive red paint mark.

187

The flowers and arena floor were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. To evaluate

188

honeybees’ inspection of flowers before they chose a flower to forage (foraging

189

decision), we recorded the test with a sport camera (Yi, Xiaomi Inc. China) featuring a

190

recording frame rate of 30 fps and a resolution of 720 p (1,280 × 720 pixels). The

191

camera was positioned 20 cm above the entrance of the bumblebee nest (Figure 1). Its

192

field of view was adjusted such that it looked down into the arena at ~50° from a

193

horizontal angle.

(e) Testing the influence of social information on foraging decisions

200

To evaluate the influence of simultaneous sources (conspecific and

201

heterospecific) of social information on honeybee’s inspection of either yellow or

202

magenta flowers and their subsequent foraging decisions, we tested fifty-three

203

honeybees in the same context as individuals in the control group (section d), but in the

204

presence of one bumblebee and one honeybee demonstrator, each foraging upon either a

205

yellow or magenta flower. We introduced the demonstrators and observer in the arena

206

in the following order: 1) a honeybee demonstrator was let in through a sliding door on

207

the back wall of the arena (Figure 1D). Once she began to feed from a yellow flower

208

and started to forage, a bumblebee demonstrator was released from the Plexiglas tunnel

209

that connected the arena to the nest-box (Figure 1D). When she landed and began to

210

feed from a magenta flower, a honeybee observer was let into the arena through the

211

sliding door on the back wall. This color-reinforcement contingency was

212

counterbalanced for thirty-three observers. The test began once the observer inspected

213

(see section d) any occupied or unoccupied flower. Observers were given up to 3 min to

214

select and forage upon any unfamiliar flower before the test concluded. In the test,

215

demonstrators moved freely between flowers after depleting them, as they naturally do

216

within inflorescences. To prevent re-testing the same individuals, we caught tested

217

honeybees and marked them with a distinctive red paint mark. The flowers and arena

218

floor were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests. To evaluate honeybees’ inspection

219

of flowers and their interactions with the demonstrators before they made a foraging

220

decision, the test was recorded as described in section (d) above.

Figure 1. Training and testing protocols in the flight arena. (A) Honeybee foragers (demonstrators) were

224

trained to find 50% sucrose solution on either four yellow or magenta flowers and water on four flowers

225

of the alternative colour and four transparent flowers. Bumblebee foragers (demonstrators) were group

226

trained using the same protocol (C) A different batch of honeybee foragers (observers) was group trained

227

to find 50% sucrose solution on six of twelve transparent flowers and unrewarding water on the other six

228

transparent flowers. (D) Honeybee observers were tested on their preparedness to forage on an unfamiliar

229

coloured flower type, depending on its colour (yellow or magenta), once their learned flower type

230

(transparent) yielded no reward. (E) Two demonstrators (one honeybee and one bumblebee) and one

231

observer honeybee were sequentially introduced in the flight arena: (1) A honeybee demonstrator was let

232

in the flight arena, once she foraged from a flower of her trained colour, (2) a bumblebee demonstrator

233

was released into the arena and let to forage from a flower of her trained colour (different colour from the

234

honeybee demonstrator), (3) an observer honeybee was then introduced to test her in a context where the

235

flowers she was trained to associate with reward (transparent) were unrewarding and unfamiliar colored

236

flowers were demonstrated by a conspecific and a heterospecific (bumblebee) demonstrator, each

237

foraging from non-preferred (yellow) and preferred (magenta) flowers, this design was counterbalanced.

238
239

(d) Analyses
We analysed the behaviour of tested honeybees from video recordings, using the

240

BORIS behavioural observation software (Friard and Gamba, 2016). To assess

241

individuals’ inspection of either yellow or magenta flowers and their preference to

242

forage upon one type of flower over the other, we analysed two main behavioural

243

categories, the frequency of inspecting transparent, yellow and magenta flowers (Ings et

244

al. 2009: 200; Balamurali et al. 2018) and individual’s foraging choice, i.e., the yellow

245

or magenta flower where individuals landed and foraged. For honeybees in the control

246

group (no social information), we used a Chi-squared test to compare the proportion of

247

honeybees that foraged upon either a magenta or yellow flower, as well as the

248

likelihood of first inspecting one of these types of flower. Further, we compared the

249

proportion of instances that honeybees inspected a transparent, yellow or magenta

250

flower, using a Friedman test and a Wilcoxon signed rank test for post hoc comparisons.

251

For honeybees exposed to social information, we considered inspection of

252

occupied flowers as an indicator that observers detected the demonstrator’s presence.

253

Thereby, four different scenarios were possible before honeybees made a foraging

254

decision: they could have detected both demonstrators, either the honeybee or

255

bumblebee demonstrator, or none of them. We compared the likelihood of each

256

situation against the expected probability with a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test. Nine

257

individuals that did not detect the presence of the demonstrators were not considered for

258

all analyses.

259

To contrast the influence of individual’s color preferences and simultaneous,

260

conspecific and heterospecific, social information on foraging decisions of honeybees,

261

we compared the proportion of individuals that foraged on an unfamiliar flower

262

between the control group and the group exposed to social information. Further, to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.874917; this version posted December 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this

263

evaluate the influence of social information on honeybees’ readiness to forage on an

264

unfamiliar flower, we compared two measurements between the control group and the

265

group exposed to social information – the total number of flowers that individuals

266

inspected before choosing a flower to forage, and the time it took them to make such a

267

decision (latency to forage). To explore whether such readiness could be affected by the

268

species of the first demonstrator that the observers detected, we compared, with a

269

Wilcoxon rank sum test, the aforementioned measurements between the observers that

270

first detected the presence of either a honeybee or bumblebee foraging on a flower,

271

irrespective of whether they detected both or only one demonstrator during the test.

272

To determine whether observers that detected both demonstrators inspected the

273

flowers occupied by a honeybee and bumblebee at a similar frequency, we compared,

274

with a Wilcoxon signed rank test, the proportion of flowers occupied by each

275

demonstrator that observers inspected. We also analysed, with a Wilcoxon rank sum

276

test, whether the honeybees that only detected either a conspecific or heterospecific

277

demonstrator, differed in the proportion of occupied flowers that they inspected, in

278

relation to all the flowers they inspected during the test. To compare the specific

279

influence of conspecific and heterospecific social information on honeybees’ foraging

280

decisions, we analysed, with a Chi-Squared test, the proportion of individuals that

281

selected the flower type demonstrated by either a honeybee or bumblebee, as well as the

282

likelihood that observers would select a flower occupied by either a honeybee or

283

bumblebee after inspecting it for the first time.

284

The instances in which observers inspected an occupied flower that did not

285

progress into landing and foraging were recorded as rejections. We evaluated whether

286

observers rejected the flowers occupied by a honeybee or bumblebee demonstrator at a

287

similar frequency. For observers that detected both demonstrators, we compared the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.874917; this version posted December 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this

288

proportion of times that they rejected the flowers occupied by each demonstrator, using

289

a Wilcoxon signed rank test. We also compared, with a Wilcoxon rank sum test, the

290

total number of occupied flowers that observers rejected when they only detected either

291

the honeybee or bumblebee demonstrator.

292

To assess whether conspecific and heterospecific social information affected

293

honeybees’ inspection of yellow or magenta flowers, we compared the proportion of

294

inspecting transparent, yellow and magenta flowers between honeybees in the control

295

group and the group that had access to social information.

296

To estimate whether the observers altered their inspection of flowers, after they

297

detected the presence of either a foraging honeybee or bumblebee, we adjusted the

298

frequency of observers’ inspection of flowers by normalising the data through an index

299

calculation, with the following equation:
Inspecting Index (II) =

300

𝑖1 − 𝑖3
𝑖1 + 𝑖3

301
302

, where, 𝑖1 and 𝑖3 are the frequency that the observer inspected magenta and yellow

303

flowers, respectively.

304

In the indices, a negative value (minimum -1) equates to a preference to inspect

yellow flowers, whereas a positive value (maximum +1) equates to a preference to

306

inspect magenta flowers, an index near equal to zero implies that the observers either

307

inspected both types of flowers equally, or they did not inspect the flowers at all. We

308

calculated inspecting indices (II) to represent the events that preceded the honeybees’

309

foraging decisions. That is, each approaching index (AI) represented observers’

310

inspection of flowers, before and after they detected either demonstrator (honeybee and

311

bumblebee) foraging on a flower . We compared indices against chance expectation

312

(Index = 0) with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A significant switch from a negative or

positive value, before the observer detected a demonstrator, to a positive or negative

314

value, after this occurred, indicates that observers modified their inspection of yellow or

315

magenta flowers in response to conspecific or heterospecific social information. All

RESULTS

319

Effect of color preference on honeybees’ foraging decisions

320

In a context where a familiar flower type ceases to yield reward, how does

321

colour preference influence honeybees’ exploration of contiguous, novel flowers and

322

ultimate move to foraging from a new flower type? We carried out a control test to

323

assess whether honeybees preferentially inspect one unfamiliar flower type over

324

another, and whether this might be reflected in their ultimate foraging decision (move to

325

foraging on a new flower type). We trained honeybees (observers) to find either a food

326

reward (50% sucrose solution) or unrewarding water on transparent flowers (Materials

327

and Methods), then we tested them in a context where transparent flowers were

328

unrewarding, and two unfamiliar yellow and magenta flower types, delivered an

329

undetectable food reward. The majority of individuals (77%) did not inspect the familiar

330

transparent flowers at all; rather, they inspected the magenta flowers more frequently

331

than the other types of flower (Friedman; X2 (2) = 19.07, df = 2, N = 18, p = 7.231e-05;

332

post hoc, Wilcoxon signed rank; comparison between flower types: magenta versus

333

transparent: p = 0.002; magenta versus yellow: p = 0.0008; yellow versus transparent: p

334

= 0.67; figure 2A).

335

Similarly, honeybees were more likely to first inspect a magenta than a yellow

336

flower (Chi-square; chi = 14.23, N = 18, p = 1.6132e-04; figure 2B), and a higher

337

proportion of individuals selected magenta over yellow flowers to forage (Chi-square;

338

chi = 28.44, N = 18, p = 9.6426e-08; figure 2C). These results indicate that tested

339

individuals had a common preference for magenta over yellow flowers, which

340

influenced their inspection of flowers and foraging decisions.

Influence of social information on honeybees’ foraging decisions

351

In a field-like context, including simultaneous and divergent conspecific and

352

heterospecific social information, we investigated how this social information might

353

affect honeybees’ inspection of flower types and ultimate foraging decisions. We

354

considered that observers detected the demonstrators’ presence once they inspected an

355

occupied flower for the first time. We found no difference in the proportion of observers

356

that detected both demonstrators, only the honeybee or bumblebee demonstrator, or

357

none of them (Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test; c2= 2.2, df= 3, N = 45, p = 0.312;

358

Figure 3A). The proportion of observer honeybees that detected the foraging

359

demonstrators and then selected an unfamiliar flower to forage was not different from

360

individuals that selected unfamiliar flowers in the control group (Chi-square; c2 =

361

1.022, N = 56, p = 0.312; Figure 3B). Similar to the control group, the vast majority of

362

observers (90%) did not inspect the transparent flowers at all. These results suggest that

363

both individual colour bias and social information similarly influenced honeybees when

364

locating a new foraging resource. Interestingly, honeybees in the control group whose

365

foraging decisions were solely influenced by their color preference, inspected a similar

366

number of flowers (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 125, N = 30, p= 0.447; Figure 3D and

367

made equally swift foraging decisions (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 133, N = 30, p=

368

0.299; Figure 3C) as honeybees exposed to social information that in the test, initially

369

detected the conspecific demonstrator foraging. However, when observer honeybees

370

first detected the heterospecific demonstrator foraging, they made slower foraging

371

decisions and inspected more flowers compared to both the control group (Wilcoxon

372

rank-sum; latency: W = 71, N = 35, p = 0.007; Figure 3C, number of flowers inspected:

373

W = 77, N = 35, p = 0.011; Figure 3D) and those honeybees that detected the

374

conspecific demonstrator first (Wilcoxon rank-sum; latency: W = 184, N = 29, p =

375

0.0003; Figure 3C, number of flowers inspected: W = 176.5, N = 29, p = 0.0009; Figure

376

3D ). These results suggest that individual preference for magenta flowers and

377

conspecific social information similarly influenced honeybees’ foraging choices which

378

allowed them to make fast decisions. This did not occur in response to heterospecific

379

social information as observers inspected the flowers extensively before making a

380

foraging decision.

383

Observer honeybees similarly inspected flowers occupied by a honeybee and

384

bumblebee demonstrator, regardless whether in the test they detected only one

385

demonstrator (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 34.5, N= 16; p-value = 0.449; Figure 3F) or

386

both demonstrators (Wilcoxon signed-rank; V = 22.5, N = 13, p = 1; Figure 3E).

387

However, a significantly higher proportion of honeybees selected and foraged on the

388

type of flowers demonstrated by conspecifics over the flowers demonstrated by

389

heterospecifics (Chi-square; c2 = 17.15, N = 29, p = 3.4516e-05; Figure 3G). Further,

390

observer honeybees that inspected an occupied flower for the first time, were

391

considerably more likely to forage on it if the occupier was a conspecific demonstrator

392

(Chi-square; c2 = 15.6508, N = 41, p = 7.6181e-05; Figure 3H). This evidence

393

demonstrates that foraging conspecifics had a strong influence on honeybees’ foraging

394

decisions. Contrastingly, observer honeybees rejected flowers occupied by a bumblebee

395

more frequently than the flowers occupied by a conspecific in both situations, when

396

they detected either one (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 2, N = 16, p = 0.002; Figure 3I) or

397

both demonstrators (Wilcoxon signed-rank; V = 3, N = 13, p = 0.008; Figure 3J).

415

detected a foraging heterospecific. (D) Honeybees in the control group and those that first detected a

416

foraging conspecific inspected fewer flowers before making a foraging decision than observers that first

417

detected the presence of a foraging heterospecific. (E) Observers that detected both demonstrators during

418

the test inspected occupied flowers irrespective of the demonstrator’s species. (F) Observers that only

detected either the conspecific or heterospecific demonstrator showed a similar proportion of inspecting

occupied flowers. (G) A higher proportion of observers preferred to forage on the type of flowers

422

observers detected the presence of a conspecific demonstrator foraging on an unfamiliar flower type, they

were more likely to land and forage on this flower, but they never chose a flower occupied by a

demonstrator, rejected flowers occupied by a bumblebee more frequently than flowers occupied by a

431

Adjustment of honeybees’ colour preference in response to social information
Our results indicate that social information can influence honeybee’s foraging

432

decisions. But how does such information interact with an individual’s colour

433

preference to shape honeybees’ flower choices? Compared to individuals in the control

434

group, observers that detected a honeybee foraging on magenta flowers, and a

435

bumblebee on the yellow ones, inspected a similar proportion of magenta flowers

436

(Wilcoxon rank-sum test; W = 96, N = 29, p = 0.9029; Figure 4A) but they inspected

437

more yellow flowers (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 137.5, N = 29, p = 0.002; Figure 4B).

438

In the alternative scenario, where honeybees observed a conspecific and heterospecific

439

demonstrator, respectively foraging on a yellow and magenta flower, the proportion of

440

yellow flowers that observers inspected was markedly higher than individuals in the

441

control group (Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 221.5, N = 29, p = 1.499e-05; Figure 4B);

442

hence they tended to inspect fewer magenta flowers, compared to the control group

443

(Wilcoxon rank-sum; W = 49, N = 29, p = 0.095; Figure 4A). These results

444

demonstrate that individuals in the control group and those exposed to social

445

information similarly inspected magenta flowers, regardless the species of the

446

demonstrator foraging on these flowers. Contrastingly, the presence of either

447

demonstrator foraging on yellow flowers, scarcely explored by honeybees in the control

448

group, attracted observers’ attention to such type of flowers. Particularly, observers that

449

detected a conspecific foraging on a yellow flower, focused on inspecting these flowers,

450

so that their preference for magenta flowers was overridden. This evidence confirms

451

that even though honeybees’ foraging decisions was determined by their preference for

452

magenta flowers in the absence of social information, this colour preference was clearly

453

outweighed by conspecific social information.

454

The inspecting indexes (II), described in (d), allowed us analysing honeybees’

455

inspection of flowers as a flexible process that culminated in a foraging decision, and

456

whose variation in response to social information was measurable in terms of an index

457

value. Observer honeybees showed no preference to inspect magenta or yellow flowers

458

before they detected the bumblebee demonstrator foraging on either a magenta

459

(Wilcoxon signed-rank test; V = 20, N = 9, p = 0.149; Figure 4D) or yellow flower

460

(Wilcoxon signed-rank test; V = 12, N = 9, p = 0.112; Figure 4D). After honeybees

461

detected a bumblebee demonstrator foraging on a magenta flower, they preferentially

462

inspected this type of flower (Wilcoxon signed-rank; V = 26, N = 9, p = 0.026; Figure

463

4A). However, after honeybees observed a bumblebee foraging on a yellow flower, they

464

showed no preference to inspect either type of flower (Wilcoxon signed-rank; V = 18.5,

465

N = 9, p = 0.5; Figure 4D). Honeybees did not prefer to inspect neither type of flower

466

before they detected a conspecific foraging upon either a magenta (Wilcoxon signed-

467

rank; V = 16.5, N = 11, p = 0.612; Figure 4E) or yellow flower (Wilcoxon signed-rank;

468

V = 23, N = 11, p = 0.261; Figure 4E). Honeybees responded to the presence of a

469

conspecific foraging on either a magenta or yellow flower by increasing their inspection

470

of demonstrated flowers (Wilcoxon signed-rank; magenta: V = 52, N = 11, p =

471

0.006471; yellow: V = 1, N = 13, p = 0.002; Figure 4E). These results show that

472

honeybees’ inspection of the different types of flowers underwent a sequential

473

adjustment in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information, which

474

ultimately affected foraging decisions.

DISCUSSION
The results presented here provide evidence that honeybees’colour preferences

500

can be adjusted in response to simultaneous social information from conspecific and

501

heterospecific sources, with conspicuous effects on honeybees’ exploration of flowers

502

and consequent foraging decisions. Unexpectedly, honeybees payed little attention to

503

the transparent flowers on which they were trained, instead prior to making a foraging

504

decision, they inspected more frequently the magenta flowers (control group) or the

505

type of flower demonstrated by a conspecific.

506

Despite inspection of flowers provide foragers with no information on the

507

reward status of a flower, they are important in the process of choosing a flower (Lunau

508

et al. 1996). In the absence of social information, honeybees’ natural preference for

509

magenta flowers influenced inspection and choices of flowers . Magenta is actually a

510

mixture of blue and red, since the red component is not fully perceived by bees (Menzel

511

and Shmida 1993), they perceive magenta flowers as blue (Waser and Chittka 1998).

512

Honeybees and bumblebees usually have innate biases for colours in the violet to blue

513

range of the spectrum (Giurfa et al. 1995; Chittka et al. 2004), which adaptively

514

correlates with the nectar production of local flowers (Giurfa et al. 1995; Chittka et al.

515

2004). Although colour biases can somewhat be overridden by individual learning

516

(Raine et al., 2006), they potentially govern foraging decisions in bees when selecting

517

among novel flower types (Gumbert 2000). In the absence of social information, flower

518

choices of tested honeybees conceivably resulted from either their innate colour

519

preferences or previous experience in the field with local flower species as both factors

520

can be linked with the likelihood of finding a profitable food reward (Giurfa et al. 1995;

521

Chittka et al. 2004).

522

In the wild, honeybee foragers are likely to encounter members of the same and

523

different species foraging concurrently in a flower patch from distinct flower types

524

(Fægri and Van der Pijl 1979; Kevan and Baker 1983). Our results demonstrate that

525

such social information is certainly integrated with honeybees’ colour preferences

526

during the process of making a foraging decision. In this realistic scenario, with two

527

simultaneous sources of conspecific and heterospecific social information, when the

528

first foraging demonstrator that honeybees detected was a member of the same species,

529

they promptly responded to social information by joining the demonstrator on the

530

unfamiliar flower type. This evidence is consistent with previous findings in

531

bumblebees (reviewed in Leadbeater and Dawson 2017) and supports the notion that the

532

use of conspecific social information in bees may be mediated by local enhancement,

533

with foragers being attracted to flowers occupied by members of the same species

534

(Leadbeater and Chittka 2007a). Such a response potentially optimises the foraging

535

efficiency of bees by facilitating their movements between different flower types

536

(Leadbeater and Chittka 2005; Kawaguchi et al. 2007).

537

Honeybees and bumblebees often forage upon similar floral resources; it is then

538

conceivable that they may concur in the same flower patches (Rogers et al. 2013; Xie et

539

al. 2016). In our experiments, we used freely moving bumblebee demonstrators to

540

elucidate how social information might flow between these species. Our results indicate

541

that in the likely scenario of a honeybee exploring a flower patch and encountering both

542

a conspecific and heterospecific (bumblebee) individual foraging from different flower

543

types, its foraging decisions might depend on the species identity of the first source of

544

social information that is observed. That is, foraging decisions of observer honeybees

545

that detected a bumblebee before a conspecific demonstrator were characteristically

546

preceded by an extensive exploration of the flowers. This evidence suggests that in a

547

foraging context, honeybees’ discrimination of conspecifics and heterospecifics might

548

determine their readiness to use social information in making foraging decisions.

549

Theory predicts that using social information from heterospecifics should be favourable

550

when there is a large niche overlap (Seppänen et al. 2007) yet, on adaptive grounds,

551

animals should typically favour conspecific over heterospecific social information when

552

they can select between both sources (Jaakkonen et al. 2015). In line with this,

553

honeybees consistently selected the type of flowers demonstrated by conspecifics, even

554

though they attended to the presence of both demonstrators whilst exploring the set-up.

555

Prioritizing conspecific over heterospecific choices can be explained due to its high

556

fitness value (Seppänen et al. 2007; Jaakkonen et al. 2015) but it can also serve to the

557

transmission of novel behavioural traits or preferences that may be adaptively valuable

558

for a particular species (Laland and Plotkin 1993; Jaakkonen et al. 2015; Alem et al.

559

2016; Danchin et al. 2018).

560

Floral reward levels differ strongly among plant species and constantly change

561

over time in an unpredictable manner (Heinrich 1979). To achieve efficient foraging,

562

bees can rapidly learn to associate floral traits such as colour, shape and scent with

563

reward quality in flowers (Chittka et al. 1999). Bees can be initially attracted to forage

564

from an unfamiliar flower species via either innate and learned colour preferences

565

(Giurfa et al. 1995; Gumbert 2000; Chittka et al. 2004; Raine and Chittka 2007) or

566

using social information (Leadbeater and Chittka 2007b; Grüter and Leadbeater 2014;

567

Leadbeater and Dawson 2017). In the wild, bees seeking floral resources are unlikely to

568

experience asocial and social cues separately, rather they may frequently be exposed to

569

a complex combination of cues potentially affecting their flower choices. Our findings

570

demonstrate a clear interplay between colour preferences and social information

571

simultaneously delivered by conspecifics and heterospecifics. This may underlie the

572

process of gathering new information that shapes honeybees’ foraging decisions.

573

Compared to honeybees in the control group (i.e., no social information) the exploration

574

behaviour of honeybees that observed a conspecific or heterospecific demonstrator

575

foraging upon the less preferred yellow flowers, reflected a more evenly distributed

576

inspection of magenta and yellow flowers. That is, the presence of either demonstrator

577

on a yellow flower increased the ‘attractiveness’ of such flower type for honeybees,

578

possibly via stimulus enhancement, an effect widely described in social learning

579

literature (Heyes 2012). Remarkably, honeybees’ inspection of flowers, naturally biased

580

towards magenta flowers, underwent a sequential and flexible adjustment before they

581

made a foraging decision. Such adjustment was modulated by visual foraging

582

information from members of the same and different species, and resulting foraging

583

decisions reflected the selective use of conspecific over heterospecific social

conspecifics when presented with unfamiliar flowers which may lead them to

586

identifying new rewarding flower species (Leadbeater and Chittka 2007a; Jones et al.

587

2015). Our results indicate that conspecific social information not only directed

588

honeybees’ foraging choices to flowers that matched their colour preference (magenta),

589

but it also outweighed this colour preference, such that honeybees selected the

590

originally less preferred yellow flowers. Whereas intraspecific social transmission of

591

foraging information may be more stable when it reinforces a prior preference (Laland

592

and Plotkin 1990), such preferences may be adjusted and potentially overridden in

593

response to conspecific social information about a novel foraging resource (Jones et al.

594

2015). Thus, enabling a fast adaptation to varying floral reward levels. If the presence of

595

a foraging conspecific can reliably be associated with a rewarding outcome, the use of

596

such social cue should be reinforced to continuously influence bees’ flowers choices

597

across foraging contexts (Leadbeater and Chittka 2009). Interestingly, in our

598

experiments the presence of a foraging heterospecific attracted honeybees’ attention to

599

the demonstrated flower types, yet this effect did not influence honeybees’ foraging

600

decisions as they selectively used social information from conspecifics. Even though,

601

heterospecific social information is predictably valuable when there is a large niche

602

overlap (Seppänen et al. 2007), conspecifics choices might offer a more predictable

603

social cue that lowers the risk of acquiring maladaptive information (Giraldeau et al.

604

2002) as conspecifics share the same ecological needs (Seppänen et al. 2007; Goodale

605

et al. 2010).

606

Multiple social and asocial cues can potentially affect animals’ foraging

607

decisions in different circumstances (Sclafani 1995; Galef and Giraldeau 2001; Grüter

608

and Leadbeater 2014). The interaction between social information and previous, innate

609

or learned preferences possibly not only influences the foraging decision of a particular

610

individual but may also promote the transmission of adaptive information about food

611

sources (Laland and Plotkin 1990; Galef and Giraldeau 2001). Despite social

612

information offers a clear advantage to individuals exploring novel foraging resources

613

(Galef and Giraldeau 2001), its use should not be indiscriminate but respond to

614

particular circumstances in order to lead to adaptive choices (Laland 2004; Kendal et al.

615

2018). Our results extend previous evidence showing that conspecific social information

616

is commonly used in situations of uncertainty (Kendal et al. 2004; van Bergen Yfke et

617

al. 2004; Galef et al. 2008; Smolla et al. 2016), such that it can outweigh both

618

predetermined individual preferences (Dugatkin 1996; Jones et al. 2015) and

619

heterospecific social information (Jaakkonen et al. 2015) to influence ecologically

620

relevant decisions in animals.

621

It is conceivable that natural selection should favour the salience of social

622

stimuli with high ecological relevance (Seppänen et al. 2007; Leadbeater and Dawson

623

2017), conspecifics, in our experiments. Whether such salience can similarly operate to

624

select information from heterospecific sources, based on their relative informative

625

value, deserves further consideration. By depicting in depth, the plausible ecological

626

process, thereby multiple sensory inputs may shape foraging decisions in bees, findings

627

presented here contribute to our current knowledge about the flexibility of individual

628

preferences and their adjustment in response to different types of social information.

629

Our results in turn shed light on the selectivity of animals for conspecific over

630

heterospecific information as a possible mechanism to facilitate the social transmission

631

of foraging information within species.
