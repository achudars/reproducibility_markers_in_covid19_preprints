ABSTRACT

19

Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease endemic in South

20

Asia, East Africa, South America and the Middle East. It is associated with low

21

socioeconomic status (SES) and responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity.

22

Reports suggest that patients with leishmaniasis may have a higher risk of mental illness

23

(MI), psychosocial morbidity (PM) and reduced quality of life (QoL), but this is not

24

well characterised. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to assess

25

the reported impact of leishmaniasis on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.

26

Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Pre-specified criteria

27

were applied to identify publications including observational quantitative studies or

28

systematic reviews. Two reviewers screened all of the titles, abstracts and full-studies

29

and a third reviewer was consulted for disagreements. Data was extracted from papers

30

meeting the criteria and quality appraisal of the methods was performed using the

31

Newcastle-Ottowa Scale or the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tool.

32

Results: A total of 14 studies were identified from 12,517 records. Nine cross-sectional,

33

three case-control, one cohort study and one systematic review were included. Eleven

34

assessed MI outcomes and were measured with tools specifically designed for this; nine

35

measured PM and 12 measured QoL using validated measurement tools. Quality

36

appraisal of the studies showed that six were of good quality. Cutaneous leishmaniasis

37

and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis showed evidence of associated MI and PM

38

including depression, anxiety and stigma, while all forms of disease showed decreased

39

QoL. The findings were used to inform a proposed model and conceptual framework to

40

show the possible links between leishmaniasis and mental health outcomes.

41

Conclusion: There is evidence that leishmaniasis has an impact on MI, PM or QoL of

42

patients and their families and this occurs in all the main subtypes of the disease. There

43

are however large gaps in the evidence. Further research is required to understand the

44

full extent of this problem and its mechanistic basis.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

47

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease prevalent in many low-and middle-income countries

48

worldwide. In this study the authors looked for evidence as to whether leishmaniasis

49

affected the mental health and quality of life of patients. To conduct the review, a wide

50

search of the literature was conducted, where a total of 14 full articles were included

51

and analysed. It was found that different forms of leishmaniasis (visceral leishmaniasis,

52

cutaneous leishmaniasis and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis) do cause a significant

53

impact on patients’ mental health and quality of life through societal factors such as

54

stigma, lack of knowledge, culture and low self-esteem among others. However, no

55

evidence of biological mechanisms was found linking leishmaniasis to mental illness or

56

decreased quality of life. Despite being a very incapacitating disease physically,

57

leishmaniasis also leads to mental illness and decreased quality of life, and should

58

therefore be a priority on the global health agenda for both researchers and policy

59

makers.

Introduction

65

Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by multiple species of

66

Leishmania parasites and transmitted by the bite of female sand flies. It is endemic in 98

67

countries, and is mostly concentrated in low-and middle-income countries in South

68

Asia, East Africa, South America and in the Middle East (1). The disease presents in

69

different forms depending on the species and geographical location. Visceral

70

leishmaniasis (VL; also known as kala-azar) presents with fever, weight loss,

71

hepatosplenomegaly and may have neurological manifestations (2). If untreated, it has a

72

fatality rate of over 95% (3). Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), occurring as

73

a consequence of VL can cause erythematous or hypopigmented macules, papules,

74

nodules and patches (4). Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients present with plaques,

75

nodules and / or ulcers and, in the case of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL),

76

symptoms manifest on the mucous membranes of the nasal and oral cavities and

77

surrounding tissues (5). These

78

disfiguring lesions and lifelong scars on the skin (6,7).

79

Although not fatal, CL lesions have been described in the literature as a source of

80

distress and discomfort. Such visible manifestations have been linked to stigmatizing

81

attitudes that could potentially lead to social stigmatisation, (6,9) and psychosocial

82

morbidity (PM). For example, in Afghanistan, the incorrect belief that the disease can

83

be transmitted by human contact results in social exclusion that can range from not

84

sharing utensils to severe physical and emotional isolation (10). In some cultures,

85

women are considered unfit for marriage or are separated from their children when they

86

have the disease(10,11). A study involving high school students in Morocco showed

87

awareness of the stigma attached to CL with self-stigmatization including feelings of

88

shame, embarrassment, depression, and self-contempt (6).

89

Although inflammation of the liver and spleen are the most well-documented clinical

90

manifestations of VL, inflammation of the nervous system has also been reported (Lima

91

et al., 2003, Marangoni et al., 2011). Neurological manifestations in human VL include

92

peripheral and cranial nerve dysfunction, neurological tremors, meningitis, seizures,

93

paresis, and haemorrhagic stroke (12–18). In addition, naturally infected dogs with

94

canine VL as well as rodent models of VL show neuroinflammation (19,20). Despite

95

these findings and research showing close links in general between neuroinflammation

96

and mental health problems (21), there is limited evidence of a direct link between the

97

neuroinflammation present in leishmaniasis and mental health problems.

98

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a causal link between systemic

99

and localised inflammation and depression in other mental health disorders (Stewart et

100

al., 2009; Taraz et al., 2012; Oliveira Miranda et al., 2014; Ford and Erlinger, 2004;

101

Vogelzangs et al., 2016;Furtado and Katzman, 2015) including 2 meta-analyses that

102

show statistically significant raised levels of inflammatory markers in depressed

103

subjects (28,29). Patients with depression often show cardinal features of inflammation,

104

including increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors as

105

well as an upregulation of acute-phase reactants, chemokines and soluble adhesion

106

molecules in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25,30,31). In VL, a link

107

between mental illness (MI) and systemic or neuroinflammation been postulated (20).

108

At the time this review was conducted, there had been no high quality comprehensive

109

systematic review published on possible aetiological associations and the impact of

110

leishmaniasis on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing. A search of the Cochrane

111

Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects

112

(DARE) identified no systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions for

113

the potential mental health consequences of leishmaniasis.

A detailed search of

114

PROSPERO indicated that no other systematic reviews were in progress. Subsequently,

115

one scoping review has recently been published (29) making a ‘preliminary assessment

116

of the extent of the literature’ focusing solely on localised cutaneous leishmaniasis and

117

with no quality appraisal for included studies.

118

The objective of this study was, therefore, to conduct a comprehensive systematic

119

review (SR) of MI, PM and quality of life (QoL) related to all forms of leishmaniasis.

120

Secondary research questions included: i) is there evidence that inflammation resulting

121

from VL is directly associated with MI?; ii) is there evidence for social stigma against

122

people with VL? If so, is this associated with MI?; iii) do cognitive and physical

123

impairments resulting from VL result in MI or PM?; iv) are stigma and discrimination

124

of patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis

125

associated with MI?; and v) do co-morbidities in people with leishmaniasis have an

126

association with decreased QoL, increased MI or PM?

127

From this research, we set out to develop a conceptual model for the association

128

between leishmaniasis, mental health outcomes and PM. This model may serve to

129

prompt further research and debate and to inform health workers, government bodies

130

and the scientific community about the nature of and the mental health implications of

131

leishmaniasis and the unanswered questions surrounding these associations.

Databases and Search Strategy

139

The following primary electronic databases were searched after expert advice from

140

experienced information specialists working in this field: MEDLINE, EMBASE,

141

PsycINFO,

142

AfricanIndexMedicus (AIM). There were no restrictions on the date and language of

143

publication. MEDLINE and EMBASE were chosen as comprehensive databases for

144

life sciences and biomedical research. PsycINFO is a robust database which contains

145

psychology-related articles. POPLINE and Global Health are population and public

146

health-related databases. LILACS, IndMED, ArabPsyNet and AIM were searched as

147

they contain literature from geographical locations where leishmaniasis is endemic (32).

LILACS,

POPLINE,

Health,

and

148
149

The search strategy (S3) was designed to be more sensitive than specific (search

150

strategy included all possible terms to answer the broad PICOS as opposed to one with

151

less descriptors) as potentially unknown exposures could exist, and because of the lack

152

of a previous robust synthesis of this topic. Backward and forward citation tracking was

153

performed for included studies to find any relevant studies not included in the

154

databases. After retrieving the results for each database, citations and abstracts were

155

exported to EndNote to remove duplicates and for screening.

156
157

Rationale for the chosen outcomes

158

The outcomes were a broad scope of the psychosocial consequences that can result from

159

leishmaniasis. They were based on three concepts: 1) the biological link between the

160

neuroinflammation caused in VL and MI; 2) the social impact of stigma, isolation and

161

discrimination around CL on QoL; 3) any further burden on the patient in terms of QoL

162

or mental health (including impact on their relatives) such as, for example consequences

163

secondary to outcomes related to mental health (e.g. financial or physical co-

164

morbidities).

165

Rationale for chosen study designs

166

Cohort studies, case-controls and cross-sectional studies that quantitatively measured

167

psychosocial outcomes such as mental illness or QoL using a validated tool in this

168

population were included. Systematic reviews (including and in addition to the review

169

by Bennis et al 2018) were also included as a mechanism for identifying relevant

170

publication for screening.

171
172

Study eligibility criteria

173

The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select studies is shown in the protocol (32),

174

which used an adapted PICOS framework for observational studies. As this study was

175

examining observational studies and not randomised control studies, there was no

176

“intervention” being studied, and instead, the term “exposure” was used. There was also

177

no comparator in observational studies, so this domain was not used.

178
179

Rationale for chosen population

180

Due to the broad exploratory nature of this systematic review, all patients with any form

181

of leishmaniasis regardless of age and gender were included. We also included

182

assessments of how the disease has wider impacts on family and community members

183

due, for example, to social stigma and financial strain (35,36).

185

Rationale for chosen exposures

186

The exposures included the social determinants of health associated with leishmaniasis

187

including: poverty, low social economic status, co-morbid infections, social and cultural

188

norms, as well as the physical and psychosocial factors that could lead to a decrease in

189

QoL, PM and MI.

190
191

Data extraction

192

Titles and abstracts were downloaded onto EndNote and de-duplicated. These were then

193

transferred onto an excel spreadsheet and screened independently by two reviewers (MP

194

and VM). Any disagreement between these two authors were resolved by a third

195

reviewer (RC). Screening codes for titles and abstracts were also created. After selecting

196

the included studies, a standard form as used to extract the relevant data. Extracted

197

information included: study setting; study design; year; time period; study population;

198

sample size; inclusion rate and attrition (where relevant e.g. for cohort studies); age

199

range of participants; mean age; sex ratio (M/F); outcome (e.g. anxiety or depression);

200

statistical test; measurement tool and main findings.

201
202

Data Synthesis and Quality Assessment

203

A narrative synthesis of the findings from the included studies was performed. This was

204

organised according to characteristics of the studied population; outcome and how these

205

were measured as well as measures of effect. It was expected that the studies would not

206

be similar enough to conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the primary

207

studies included in the review e.g. cutaneous, visceral, PKDL; different countries,

208

different studied populations, different outcome measures and different study designs).

210

Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias

211

The tool to assess quality and risk of bias for the cohort and case-control studies was the

212

Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (37) as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook (38). For

213

cross-sectional studies, an adapted version of the NOS was used (39). For any SRs

214

identified during the selection process, the ROBIS tool for assessing the risk of bias was

215

used. The tool is comprised of three phases: 1) assess relevance, 2) identify concerns

216

with the review process, and 3) judge risk of bias (40).

217
218

Methodological Quality Appraisal of Studies

219

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed for the 13 primary studies using

220

the NOS risk of bias tool, as described above; the systematic review (Bennis et al.,

221

2018)was assessed using ROBIS. An adapted version of NOS was used to appraise the

222

quality of the cross-sectional studies (39). The case-control studies and cohort study

223

were appraised using the original version of NOS.

224
225
226

ROBIS

227

ROBIS is a very comprehensive tool used to assess the risk of bias in systematic

228

reviews, and not in primary studies (40). It was used to assess the risk of bias in the

229

systematic review that met our inclusion criteria (41).

Population and Demographics

246

Three studies were on VL (42,43,46); 10 studied CL (41,44,45,48,49,51–55); and Pal et

247

al., 2017 studied PKDL (50). Of the VL studies, two were about HIV patients co-

248

infected with VL (42,43), which was part of the inclusion criteria for the population.

249

The populations measured in the studies vary greatly in age. Ages of the participants in

250

the studies ranged from the ages of 7 to 80 years, according to the values reported in the

251

studies. Two of the studies were in children only (49,52). Most of the studies had both

252

female and male participants although two (44,51) had an only female population. The

253

combined number of study participants in the 14 studies was 2565. Sample sizes of the

254

primary studies ranged from 20 (45) to 620 (42).

255

Female to Male ratio in percentage of female was 57% showing that more women were

256

studied over-all (excluding the review) (41).

257

All studies, including the systematic review were performed in low-and middle-income

258

countries, according to the World Bank’s listing of these countries; Ethiopia is classified

259

as low-income, India as a lower-middle income; and Brazil, Turkey and Iran as upper

260

middle-income (56).

Nine studies were cross-sectional (42,44–46,48,49,51,53,55), three were case-control (

264

Pal et al., 2017; Turan et al., 2015; Yanik et al., 2004), one was a prospective cohort

265

study (43) and one a systematic review (41). The characteristics of the 14 included

266

studied that met the eligibility criteria were assessed for quantitative synthesis.

Outcomes:

275

Visceral leishmaniasis

276

Two studies by the same authors conducted in Northwest Ethiopia reported the results

277

of a prospective longitudinal study at baseline (42) and followed up six months later

278

(43), measuring QoL in HIV patients with VL (HIV-VL) and HIV patients. At baseline,

279

HIV-VL patients had lower mean scores in all domains of the QoL questionnaire

280

showing poor quality of life. Importantly depression was strongly and consistently

281

associated with all the QoL domains in HIV-VL patients (as it was in the HIV group.

282

The mean (SD) depressive-symptoms scale scores were higher 2.67 (±0.7) for HIV-VL

283

patients compared to HIV patients 1.61 (±0.5) (p = 0.001) (42). After 6 months of

284

treatment with both antiretroviral treatment (ART) and anti-leishmanial drugs, the

285

follow-up study (43), showed there was improvement in all the QoL domains analysed

286

at baseline in both groups. Mean scores for social relationship among co-infected

287

patients were significantly lower compared to the HIV group (p=0.001).

288

Another study looked at knowledge attitudes and practices (KAP) about VL among

289

adults in a community in India. It was found that 7.6% of the participants agreed with

290

the statement that the incidence of VL in the family should not be disclosed. Forty-three

291

percent reported that the illness affects mental health, causes stress (27%), irritation

292

(3.7%), depression/fear of death (5.8%) and other (16,9%). Almost 74% thought that

293

VL in the family has financial consequences, causes impoverishment. (39.5%) leading

294

to the need for loans (17.6%), forced to sell property (0.7%) and other (15.5%) (46).

296

Cutaneous leishmaniasis

297

The cross-sectional study by Chahed et al, 2016, measured the QoL in girls and women

298

with CL scars and explored the psychological and psychosocial consequences of CL

299

using the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R), World Health Organization

300

Quality of Life-26 (WHOQOL-26) and the Psoriasis Life Stress Inventory (PLSI) in 41

301

girls and women with CL scars in the Sidi Bouzid region, Tunisia (44). The correlation

302

analyses performed on inter and intra-subscales showed that the emotional

303

representations associated with CL were correlated with a loss of self-esteem feelings of

304

inferiority (r=0.77, p<0.05). The more patients knew about CL, the more pessimistic

305

they got about the prospects of recovery. Patients who had a more coherent perception

306

of CL had stronger emotional reactions (p<0.001). Moderate correlations were found

307

between the total number of body scars and experiences of rejection (r=0.31, p<0.05).

308

The number of body scars had a strong link to experience with stigma. Experiences of

309

rejection and avoidance of stress negatively correlated with age (r=-0.33, p<0.05, and

310

r=-0.31, p<0.05), suggesting that younger women experience social stigma more than

311

older women. The WHOQOL-26 and the PSLI questionnaire results showed that the

312

domains of Social QoL and anticipation avoidance of stress, and social QoL and total

313

stress correlated significantly (r=-0.36, p<0.05 and r=-0.32, p<0.05). The Mental QoL

314

domains, however, did not correlate significantly with any of the PSLI domains.

315

QoL was measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) in a cross-

316

sectional study of 20 patients with CL (45). In 70% (n=14), CL resulted in a moderate

317

to large effect on QoL in the work and school domain, and the “symptoms and feelings”

318

domain followed. The domain with the least impact was “personal relationships”.

319

Handjani and Kalafi, 2013 measured the impact of dermatological diseases on the

320

quality of life of healthy families of patients with skin diseases which included five

321

patients with CL using the 10-item validated Persian version of the Family Dermatology

322

Life Quality Index (FDLQI) questionnaire (55). The FDLQI scores for each of the

323

groups showed that there was no statistically significant difference in QoL of families

324

found between the groups of different skin diseases studied (vitiligo, psoriasis,

325

pemphigus and leishmaniasis). However, due to there only being 5 CL families in this

326

study, there could be lack of statistical power.

327

The WHOQOL-BREF was used to study QoL, PM and MI of CL patients (48). The

328

psychological and environment domains had the lowest median scores. Forty (90.9%)

329

interviewees presented negative feelings (blue mood, anxiety, despair, depression). Of

330

these, eight (18.18%) reported experiencing such feelings always, 19 (43.18%) very

331

often, nine (20.45%) quite often, and four (9.09%) rarely. 50% were dissatisfied with

332

the support received from family and friends, and in their intimate lives.

333

Layegh et al., 2017, measured the QoL, depression, and anxiety (MI) in children with

334

CL using the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), Children's

335

Depression Inventory (CDI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC)

336

questionnaires (49). This study enrolled 42 children by convenience sampling. The

337

prevalence of low quality of life, state anxiety, and trait anxiety was 57.1, 76.9, and

338

15.8%, respectively; 32% of patients had depression. Cases of low quality of life

339

(54.1%), state anxiety (56.6%), and trait anxiety (53.8%) were more common with the

340

acute form of leishmaniasis. Low quality of life (70.83%), state anxiety (76.66%), trait

341

anxiety (83.3%), and depression (84.6%) were more prevalent in females. The face was

342

the most common location of involvement in patients with low quality of life (63.3%),

343

state anxiety (70.4%), trait anxiety (83.3%), and depression (54.5%). However, the

authors report that no significant difference was found between psychological factors in

345

patients and sex (p > 0.05), acute or chronic type of disease (p > 0.05), presence of any

346

other skin or systemic diseases (p > 0.05), location of lesions (p > 0.05), number of

350

Simsek et al., 2008 conducted a cross-sectional study to assess mental health disorders

351

in women in the region using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I

352

Disorders (SCID-I).0.5) (51). Fifteen out of 270 women had cutaneous leishmaniasis

353

(6.1%) of whom 8 (53.3%) had a mental disorder. Women with CL have a 2.13 higher

354

OR (95% CI: 1.25-7.31) compared to women without CL of suffering from a mental

355

disorder mainly depression and anxiety.

356

Turan et al., 2015 assessed the psychiatric morbidity and QoL in children and

357

adolescents with CL and their parents using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the

358

State-Trait Anxiety Inventories for Children (STAIC) and the Pediatric Quality of Life

359

Inventory Parent and Child Versions (PedQL-P and C, respectively) (52). Fifty-four

360

subjects, of mean age 12.0 (±3.2) years of whom 46.3% were female, were matched

361

with 40 healthy controls of mean age 11.5 (±2.3) years, 50% of whom were female. In

362

addition, the mother or other caregiver was included for each child. From 2011 to 2013,

363

subjects were recruited at the paediatrics department of a hospital in Sanliurfa, Turkey

364

and the controls were children receiving vaccinations or undergoing routine health

365

checks, matched for age, gender, and parents’ level of education. Scores for depression

366

were higher in patients compared to the controls and QoL was lower in patients and

367

their mothers. All results were statistically significant (p<0.001 for CDI and p<0.05 for

368

PedQL-P and PedQL-C). However no statistically significant difference in scores for

369

anxiety (STAIC) was found.

370

Yanik et al., 2004 looked at the psychological impact of CL using the Hospital Anxiety

371

Depression Scale (HAD), the Body Image Satisfaction Scale (BIS) and the

372

Dermatology Quality of Life Scale (DQL) to measure anxiety, psychosocial morbidity

373

and quality of life, respectively. Ninety-nine subjects in 3 equal groups, those with

374

active lesions (n=33), patients with healed lesions (n=33) and a healthy group (n=33)

375

were studied. Results showed that lesions on the face and hands, disease active for over

376

a year, permanent scars and social stigmatisation led to anxiety and depression. Body

377

image satisfaction and quality of life were also decreased. Higher scores were obtained

378

in patients with active CL and scores were also statistically significant in patients with

379

healed scars compared to controls in HAD and BIS. Patients with active lesions had

380

lower QoL scores compared to those with healed scars. The correlations between the

381

subscale of HAD and DQL showed a moderate correlation (anxiety r=0.490, p< 0.001;

382

depression r=0.291, p=0.040). The comparison between the HAD scale and the BIS

383

scale had a significant correlation (anxiety r=0.201, p=0.047; depression r=0.256,

384

p=0.011).

385

The quality of life in patients with CL using the Dermatology Quality of Life (DLQI)

386

Index was carried out (53). QoL was significantly affected. Highest scores were seen in

387

the symptoms and feelings domains; the lowest effect was observed in the treatment

388

domain of the DLQI. The appearance of the lesion and type of the lesion significantly

389

affected the QoL (p<0.05) as patients with ulcerated lesions had lower quality of life

390

compared to those with nodular (P = 0.003) and plaque lesions (P = 0.005). The activity

391

of the disease, location of the lesions and gender did not affect the scores significantly.

392

A scoping review on the impact of localised cutaneous leishmaniasis on psychosocial

393

wellbeing has recently been conducted . Eight quantitative studies (44,51–55,57,58) five

394

qualitative studies (6,9,11,59,60) and two mixed-methods (10,61) studies were included

395

in their review. It combines the results of the quantitative studies through narrative

396

synthesis looking at anxiety and depression, low QoL, stigma and fear of scars. The

397

three last cited quantitative studies were picked up by us during the title screen but did

398

not fulfil the abstract or full-article screen criteria for this review, and were thus

399

excluded (refer to protocol for inclusion and exclusion criteria) (32).

400

Our set of inclusion criteria was different from that of the scoping review carried out by

401

Bennis and colleagues (date), hence only six studies included in their study overlap with

402

this systematic review (44,51–55). The quantitative study by Abazid et al., 2012 showed

403

no mental health or psychosocial outcomes (57); An RCT was found that falls under

404

our exclusion criteria (58). Qualitative studies were not included in our study.

405

Bennis et al., failed to pick up three studies on CL that were identified and included in

406

this systematic review (45,48,49).

PKDL patients compared to healthy controls using the Dermatology Life Quality Index

(DLQI) and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (50). The type and severity

412

of the lesions were also noted. A range of independent variables were compared. DLQI

413

scores a significant effect on QoL in patients of PKDL with highest impairment found

414

in patients under the age of 20 years (p =0.03) and with type of lesion, where patients

415

with the more severe nodular lesions had poorer scores (p = 0.001). Initiation of

416

treatment for PKDL improved the scores (p = 0.04), while gender, duration and location

417

of the lesions had no impact. The SF-36 showed that mental health, social functioning,

418

body pain and general health were significantly different (p<0.05) in the patients

419

compared to the control group.

420
421

Risk of Bias assessment

422

Based on NOS, 6 of the 14 studies were of good quality, 3 were of fair quality and the

423

remaining 4 were of poor quality (S4 Table). The fact that some studies were carried out

424

in LMICs of lower economic status than others did not affect the quality outcome.

425

Alemayehu et al 2017 and 2018 both showed the highest scores among all 14 articles,

426

despite having been carried out in Ethiopia (42,43). Most studies with poor or fair

427

scores were found to have inadequate sample sizes (too small) with no justification (44–

428

49,53). In contrast, recruitment methods for subjects seemed to be justified for all

429

studies. Out of the nine cross-sectional studies, only five (42,45,46,49,53) controlled for

430

at least one confounder. Thus, the remaining four could be severely biased due to

431

confounders such as the age or gender of the participants. Moreover, what contributed

432

further to risk of bias was that five of the studies (45,47–49,53) did not report

433

confidence intervals, which is considered inadequate statistical reporting. However,

434

some important inconsistencies between the NOS and the adapted-NOS, as well as the

435

different study designs, could potentially have had an impact on the overall score and

436

quality rating. The maximum rating that can be given in the adapted NOS-version is 10

437

stars whereas for the original NOS versions (cohort and case-control studies) Quality

438

rating (S4 Table) does not take into account the overall star rating, but rather the rating

439

per section: “selection”, “comparability” and “exposure”. The comparability section

440

was always assessed in terms of whether the study controlled for specific confounding

441

variables. Gender and age were considered the most important variables to control for.

442
443

The ROBIS (S5-S8 Tables) assessment showed that in the review by Bennis et al 2018

444

the risk of bias is unclear overall. As shown in the assessment, the lack of a previously

445

published protocol made it very difficult to assess the reliability of the review.

448

DISCUSSION

449

The primary research question of this review was: What is the impact of leishmaniasis

450

on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing? This systematic review shows

451

preliminary evidence of associations between leishmaniasis and mental health, but also

452

shows several lacunae in the evidence. The systematic review only yielded studies about

453

VL, PKDL and CL. The first evident large gap in the existing literature is the lack of

454

quantitative observational studies on the impact of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis on

455

mental health. All 14 studies found examined at least one of the mental health outcomes

456

(QoL, PM or MI). Of these studies: nine found significant associations between

457

leishmaniasis and QoL; seven found significant associations with MI; and six with PM.

458

Several of the included papers appear to show an association between all forms of

459

leishmaniasis and depression (42,43,46,49,51,52,54). Mechanisms for this are likely to

460

be complex and interwoven as with other NTDs (62) but evidence to date suggests that

461

scarring in CL has an increased association with social and family rejection (44) and

462

anxiety/depression (54) and severe nodular lesions also carry an association with

23

463

depression (50). The effect may be more severe in younger patients and women/girls

464

although this needs to be investigated further. Lesions on the face have an increased

465

association with anxiety/ depression (49,54). Evidence for a societal link was found

466

between VL and mental health outcomes (MI, QoL, PM). Survey work assessing the

467

perceptions and attitudes of the community in Bihar, India, found that there is social

468

stigma attached to VL, as well as PM MI, and decrease in QoL due to financial loss

469

(46). While this supports the hypothesis that financial burden may also lead to

470

decreased mental well-being, our study did not find more evidence associating VL with

471

financial problems and social drift. A more complete study would involve economic

472

evaluations to be part of our inclusion criteria and require different search terms.

473

When looking at subtypes of leishmaniasis more specifically, there are several gaps in

474

the literature concerning the effect of VL on mental health outcomes, despite it having

475

been shown that VL did decrease the quality of life of patients directly (42,43). We

476

found no evidence that neuroinflammation or inflammatory responses play a role in the

477

development of mental health problems associated with leishmaniasis as this had not

478

been specifically explored in this population. This is a surprising gap in the literature

479

given that inflammation associated with other diseases has been shown to be associated

480

with mental health (in a bidirectional manner), although these reported diseases and

481

syndromes are all chronic (63–65).

482

(12,66), which can both decrease quality of life and increase the likelihood of mental

483

illness in Leishmaniasis. Only one review (non-systematic) looks at the neurological

484

and psychological consequences of visceral leishmaniasis in humans and animals (67)

485

but the only article that documents mental health outcomes in human VL patients was

486

an article published by Carswell in 1953 (68) which did not meet our inclusion criteria

487

and included no validated assessments of mental health outcomes.

Neurological manifestations can occur in VL

488

The subject of stigma in VL was only examined indirectly in a single study from the 14

489

included studies. This showed a reluctance in the community to report the occurrence of

490

the disease, indicating fear of the negative consequences this would have upon the

491

patient and their families (46).

492

The association of VL and MI was, however, indirectly examined (46), where 43% of

493

the community perceived that VL could cause changes in mental health, although no

494

patient outcomes were reported. The prospective longitudinal study from Ethiopia

495

addressed the question partly because it was related to HIV-VL co-infected patients

496

(42,43) and not just VL infection. This study reported a higher mean score for

497

depressive-symptoms compared to HIV-patients alone. However, it would be

498

speculative to conclude that this was due to VL alone and it is possible that any other

499

co-morbidity could exacerbate the symptoms of MI. Carswell reported "mental

500

depression” and “apathy” in all of 96 (100%) patients of VL (68), but no clinical or

501

diagnostic measures were used and these findings have therefore not been tested in

502

more methodologically robust research using validated tools to assess MI, QoL or PM.

503

Bennis et al., 2018 focuses on the stigmatising impact that localised cutaneous

504

leishmaniasis can have, by dividing “stigma” into the categories of social stigma (when

505

society rejects or excludes against people even if the stigmatized disagree with the way

506

they are being treated) and self-stigma (the internalised mechanism within the person

507

who is being stigmatized who faces rejection in an anticipatory manner) (41). Even

508

though Pal et al 2017 do find a significant decrease in quality of life in the personal

509

relationship domain (50), one cannot jump to conclusions about whether this was

510

related to stigma, and whether PKDL patients suffered from MI. CL patients are victim

511

to social stigma, self-stigma and suffer from PM, MI and decreased QoL (44,51,52,54).

512

In Chahed et al., 2016, the number of body scars was weakly correlated to an experience

513

of stigma (p=0.06, r=0.29). They also observed anticipation avoidance of stress,

514

indicating not only social stigma but also self-stigma (44). These results should be

515

interpreted with caution, because the sample size was small (n=41). The study showed

516

stronger correlations between CL and loss of self-esteem and feelings of inferiority

517

(r=0.77, p<0.05), and it was shown that at younger ages, women experienced higher

518

levels of rejection and avoidance of stress (44). Bennis’ review included and reported on

519

the results of qualitative studies (not included in the study design for this systematic

520

review) showing: social isolation; social contempt; social exclusion; marriage

521

difficulties; embarrassment; shame; sadness; disgust; shyness; and decreased marriage

522

prospects (41). The scoping review concludes that stigma is closely linked to

523

psychosocial morbidity (41).

524

Although PKDL and CL are caused by different Leishmania species, both have visible

525

and disfiguring clinical manifestations. Stigma was found to play an important role in

526

the mental health outcomes associated with CL and PKDL but the measurement tools

527

used in the quantitative observational studies (part of inclusion criteria) could not

528

quantify how much stigma a person or their family faces. Bennis et al., 2018 call for the

529

development of a standardized tool to measure stigma (41). Stigma, feelings of rejection

530

and social exclusion are a few of the social consequences of CL and PKDL that are

531

much more easily studied in a qualitative setting, e.g. in focus groups or individually

532

using non-structured open-ended questionnaires as was the case with (10,11,69).

533

Overall, the clinical manifestations for PKDL and CL both led to decreased body

534

satisfaction as well as misconceptions within society about potential disease spread.

535

These findings complement those of Bailey et al, in their recent systematic review of the

536

psychosocial impact of CL. They used the data from qualitative and quantitative studies

537

to demonstrate a high burden of co-morbid depression in both active and inactive forms

of the disease (70).

539

The only studies including a co-morbidity were part of the same study assessed at

540

baseline (cross-sectional) (42) (prospective cohort) (43) where the impact of VL as a

541

comorbidity of HIV was assessed pre- and post-treatment with anti-parasitic treatment

542

for leishmaniasis. The baseline study shows that HIV-VL patients showed significantly

543

worse quality of life scores in all domains compared to the HIV-alone patients

544

(p=0.001)(42). Regarding psychosocial morbidity and mental illness, the Kessler

545

Psychological Distress Scale correlated significantly with psychological health, social

546

relation, and environmental domains of the WHOQoL had correlation coefficients of -

547

0.335, -0.295, and -0.350 with the Kessler scale (p=0.001), further showing that a

548

decrease in quality of life correlates with an increased mean psychological distress

549

score. The mean (SD) depressive symptoms scale score was higher in HIV-VL patients

550

compared to HIV patients, 2.67 (±0.7) vs 1.161 (±0.5) respectively (42). After therapy,

551

at the 6-month follow-up stage (43), HIV-only patients showed no significantly

552

different QoL scores compared to HIV-VL patients, showing that QoL of life scores

553

improve after the disease is treated. Usually patients return to their normal physical

554

appearance, as opposed to the other forms of leishmaniasis. This is starkly different in

555

comparison to people who have CL and PKDL lesions. When the cutaneous lesions are

556

healed, these become visible, disfiguring scars on the patient. Studies have shown that

557

the suffering is long-term with the consequences of the disease for life (50,51,54).

558

We used the results of the review to develop a conceptual framework (Figure 1)

559

outlining the relationships visually between the forms of leishmaniasis, mental illness,

560

psychosocial morbidity and quality of life. This shows the strength of evidence or the

561

absence of evidence where there are hypothesised links. This takes the form of a model

562

that may help to direct future research and public health policy.

Limitations

571
572

The variability in outcome measures and study designs contributed to large inter-study

573

heterogeneity. Therefore, a narrative description of the results was the only option. Even

574

if the outcome measures had been more consistent or if more papers had been identified,

575

the lack of consistent good quality studies, would have hindered the conduct and

576

interpretation of any meta-analysis. This highlights the need for better literature in this

577

area. The searches and inclusion criteria for this review did not include qualitative

578

studies which could also have revealed useful information regarding the studied

579

outcomes.

580

Future research

581

Further research is recommended with larger sample sizes. Research should include

582

both mixed-methods and qualitative methods, as it is only through combining

583

quantitative and qualitative measures of mental health outcomes that we will begin to

584

understand the dimensions of the problem at hand.

585

There has been no research to follow-up on Carswell’s observation in 1953 (68), that

586

most patients with VL showed marked signs of depression. Thus, a more sophisticated,

587

and modern large cross-sectional study with VL patients to study if there is associated

588

mental illness in these patients would be an important aspect to investigate. This

589

research needs to be designed in culturally appropriate ways given the variety of low-

590

and middle-income country settings that the disease is to be found.

Clinical and Policy Implications

593

Governments of endemic countries could invest more in research to find out exactly

594

what is the best way to intervene with the CL and PKDL mental health crisis at hand.

595

There is evidence that stigma is a serious problem associated with leishmaniasis and

596

that for this reason policies addressing informational gaps and misinformation may be

597

productive. Women and children were found to be impaired significantly in these

598

studies. Women’s health is of paramount importance in public health. There is a need

599

for effective promotion of good mental health for women and children. Hence good

600

quality evidence-based research and practice would add considerably to this field.

601

In the LMIC settings, where VL is endemic, there is very little investment in mental

602

health. If VL has a causative link with depression it may be going undiagnosed. If so,

603

this could (after treatment) have a detrimental impact on the patients’ quality of life, and

604

wider societal and economic impacts.

605
606

CONCLUSION

607

This wide exploratory systematic review has shown that there are substantial gaps in our

608

knowledge and in the research literature and that there is a lack of methodological

609

quality in many of the existing studies. This systematic review shows preliminary

610

evidence that leishmaniasis impacts upon individuals and families affecting their social

611

status, causing stigma, with effects on quality of life and raising the risk of mental

612

health problems. This work allows us to build a preliminary model that we present here

613

to scaffold future attempts to better understand the effects of leishmaniasis on MI, PM

614

and QoL.
