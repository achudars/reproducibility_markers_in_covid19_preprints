Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a promising cell source for the
development of β-cells for use in therapies for type 1 diabetes. Current culture approaches
provide the signals to drive differentiation towards β-cells, with the cells spontaneously
assembling into clusters. Herein, we adapted the current culture systems to cells seeded on
microporous biomaterials, with the hypothesis that the pores can guide the assembly into β-cell
clusters of defined size that can enhance maturation. The microporous scaffold culture allows
hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitors to form clusters at a consistent size as cells undergo
differentiation to immature β-cells. By modulating the scaffold pore sizes, we observed 250-425
µm pore size scaffolds significantly enhance insulin expression and key β-cell maturation
markers compared to suspension cultures. Furthermore, when compared to suspension
cultures, the scaffold culture showed increased insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulus
indicating the development of functional β-cells. In addition, scaffolds facilitated cell-cell
interactions enabled by the scaffold design and cell-mediated matrix deposition of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins associated with the basement membrane of islet cells. We further
investigated the influence of ECM on cell development by incorporating an ECM matrix on the
scaffold prior to cell seeding; however, their presence did not further enhance maturation. These
results suggest the microporous scaffold culture facilitates 3D cluster formation, supports cellcell interactions, and provides a matrix similar to a basement membrane to drive in vitro hPSCderived β-cell maturation and demonstrates the feasibility of these scaffolds as a
biomanufacturing platform.

1. Introduction
Type I diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by autoimmune
destruction of the pancreatic β-cells that results in the need for life-long insulin therapy. This
disease represents 5–10% of the diagnosed cases of diabetes, corresponding to more than 1.5
million individuals in the United States[1]. Several secondary metabolic disorders can arise from
this disease, as well retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, stroke and heart failure[2,3].
Although exogenous insulin injections have decreased mortality, hypoglycemic events and
vascular complications persist[4–6]. Thus, recent research has turned to cell-based therapies
focused on replacing lost insulin-producing cells. Enthusiasm in cell replacement therapies for
diabetes was driven, in part, by the progress in allogeneic islet transplantation with the
Edmonton protocol[7,8]. However, the widespread application of islet transplantation has been
tempered by the lack of availability of islets, the need for life-long immunosuppression, and the
increasing reversal of insulin independence in as many as 50% of the recipients 5 years after
the transplantation, although some β-cell function and hypoglycemia awareness seems to
persist for longer than 5 years[9,10].
The lack of available islets has led to the investigation of human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) as an unlimited source of functional β-cells. Multiple investigators have demonstrated
the feasibility of differentiating hPSCs to immature β-cells in vitro, and transplanting these cells
to support their maturation into glucose-responsive insulin-producing β-cells[11–17]. Initial
findings from the Kieffer and Baetge/D’Amour groups demonstrated the production of pancreatic
progenitors and, subsequently, immature β-cells in vitro, which could further differentiate
following transplantation to normalize blood glucose levels after approximately 120 days[14,18].
More recently, in vitro culture protocols have developed hPSC-derived β-cells that induce
normoglycemia over shorter times after transplantation[12,14,19,20]. While numerous protocols

have been established, the in vitro production of β-cells can result in a heterogenous population
consisting of polyhormonal endocrine cells in addition to monohormonal β-cells. Moreover, the
transplantation of these insulin-producing β-cells does not result in all recipients returning to
normoglycemia[12,13], indicating the need to more consistently and efficiently promote
maturation of insulin-producing β-cells [17,21]. Consistent and efficient methods for
differentiation to monohormonal β-cells are required for clinical translation to treat T1D.[22]
The current stepwise hPSC differentiation approach aims to mimic a temporal control of
organogenesis observed during embryonic development, and spatial control may represent an
opportunity to enhance the efficiency and consistency of β-cell maturation. In vivo spatial control
is achieved with cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The ECM forms a
three-dimensional (3D) environment and offers a niche for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation,
and differentiation[23–25]. 3D environments have been shown to enhance differentiation and
promote the assembly of functional tissues[12,13]. Recent advances in three-dimensional
cultures have generated tissues called organoids which possess several advantages including
tissue structure and cellular organization similar to the native organ while possessing the
specified cell types[26–32]. These same cell types cultured on plastic and allowed to simply
self-assemble are not able to form the same complex tissue architectures that are permitted by
3D cultures.
Recently, microporous scaffolds have been used to provide a 3D environment to facilitate
the assembly of hPSCs into multicellular structures, or organoids[33,34]. Microporous scaffolds
allow for both cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling that supports the self-organization of the cells
into functional tissue structures[35]. This approach has proved groundbreaking for components
of the lung, intestine, brain, liver, stomach, and the eye[26–32]. hPSC-derived β-cells have
currently been obtained through culture as a monolayer of 2D clusters or as 3D aggregates on
low attachment plates or in suspension cultures [12,14,17]. However, in vivo these cells

naturally congregate into islets that are surrounded by a supportive extracellular matrix[36–38].
Mimicking the spatial cues in the pancreatic niche environment has the potential to augment the
in vitro hPSC differentiation toward glucose-responsive, insulin-secreting cells.
Herein, we investigated microporous polymer scaffolds as an in vitro platform for the efficient
differentiation of these progenitor cells to glucose-responsive insulin-producing β-cells[18,39].
Scaffolds were formed from multiple synthetic polymeric materials, with the walls supporting the
assembly of pancreatic progenitors into β-cell clusters. The pore size was investigated for the
ability to form clusters of distinct sizes. The cell structures within the pores of the scaffold were
analyzed by histology and gene expression. The influence of ECM-coated scaffolds on β-cell
maturation was evaluated as well to investigate the role of the matrix in cellular assembly and
differentiation. Finally, we assessed the maturation and function of these cells through glucose
stimulated insulin secretion assays. These studies provide insight on cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions that influence the differentiation of hPSCs to β-cells on microporous scaffolds,
which may ultimately provide a platform for biomanufacturing the cells as a therapy for T1D.
2. Materials and methods
2. 1 Microporous scaffold fabrication
Microporous scaffolds were fabricated as previously described[40,41]. Two types of scaffolds
were used poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds and polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds.
Briefly, PLG microporous scaffolds were fabricated by compression molding PLG microspheres
(75:25 mole ratio D,L-lactide to glycolide) and micron-sized salt crystals in a 1:30 ratio of PLG
microspheres to salt. The mixture was humidified in an incubator for 7 min and then thoroughly
mixed again. Scaffolds were compression molded with 77.5 mg of polymer–salt mixture into
cylinders 5 mm in diameter by 2 mm in height using a 5 mm KBr die (International Crystal
Laboratories, Garfield, NJ) at 1500 psi for 45s. Molded constructs were gas foamed in 800 psi
carbon dioxide for 16 h in a pressure vessel. The vessel was depressurized at a controlled rate
for 30 min. On the day of cell seeding, scaffolds were leached in water for 1.5 h, changing the

water once after 1 h. Scaffolds were sterilized by submersion in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds
and multiple rinses with phosphate buffer solution.
For the PEG hydrogels, PEG-maleimide (4-arm, molecular weight 20kDA, 20% wt/wt)
polymer was dissolved in a HEPES buffer solution, mixed with NaCl crystals and a photoinitiator
(Irgacure-2959) then cast into a PDMS mold (diameter: 5mm, thickness 2mm). The solution is
irradiated with UV light to photo-crosslink the PEG-maleimide and then washed to remove the
sodium chloride and unreacted photoinitiator. The pore size of the scaffolds can be readily
controlled through the dimensions of the porogen, and we propose to investigate pore sizes of
63 to 108 µm, 108-225 µm, 225 to 450 µm, and 500 to 600 µm.
The differentiation of pluripotent hPSCs (Stage 0) to pancreatic progenitor cells (Stage IV)
were performed as described[14]. Cells were seeded on scaffolds at concentrations ranging
from 12.5-125 million cells/cm3 and distributed across both faces of the scaffold. The
differentiation towards immature β-cells (Stages V-VI) required 1-2 weeks based on established
protocols[12,14,42] The impact of microporous scaffolds on the differentiation was compared to
the established suspension culture method.
2.2 Protein adsorption to scaffolds
For coating scaffolds with ECM proteins, scaffolds were fabricated and disinfected in 70%
ethanol and dried again before being placed into individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture dish.
Proteins were then coated per manufacturer’s recommendations and to be consistent with our
previous report that demonstrated enhancement in islet function following transplantation on
ECM protein-modified scaffolds[43,44]. Collagen IV (1mg/mL, Sigma), laminin-332 (1mg/mL,
formerly termed laminin-5 and hereafter referred to as “laminin”, Sigma), Matrigel (Corning,
Cat#: 354277) or PBS were added to the scaffold. The scaffolds were then incubated at 37°C
for 1h, followed by a second coating of the same component to each scaffold. Scaffolds were

incubated with 95% humidity at 37°C overnight to facilitate protein adsorption to the scaffold
surface.
2.3 Cell culture
We used a six-stage differentiation strategy to differentiate hPSCs in to pancreatic
progenitors and further into β-cell clusters within the scaffold. For the suspension culture
control, undifferentiated hPSCs were initially seeded at 1.0 million cells/1mL in ultra-low
attachment 6 well plates (Corning, VWR) placed on a 9-Position stir plate (Chemglass) set at
rotation rate of 95 rpm in a 37°C incubator, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity.
2.4 Cell viability
The viability of the cells was qualitatively assessed using Live/Dead® viability/cytotoxicity kit
(Life Technologies), visualizing viable and dead cells by staining with the fluorescent dyes
calcein and ethidium homodimer‐1 (EthD‐1), respectively. Cells cultured on microporous
scaffolds were stained with 4 µM EthD‐1 and 2 µM Calcein AM for 30 min before the viability
was assessed using fluorescence microscopy.
2.5 qRT-PCR Analysis
For gene expression analysis, cell containing scaffolds were mechanically homogenized in a
tube containing Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies), and RNA was isolated according to the
manufacturer's

instructions.

2.6 Immunostaining
Immunostaining of in vitro cell differentiation was performed at stage 6 (immature beta cells).
Cells differentiated in suspension cultures were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron
Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA, United States), permeabilized using 0.5% Triton in trisbuffered saline, blocked using normal donkey serum, and stained for cell-cell and cell-matrix
interaction markers ECAD, Collagen IV, Laminin, Fibronectin as well as insulin and cell nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI. Scaffold cultures were cryopreserved in isopentane cooled on
dry ice and then embedded within OCT embedding medium and cryosectioned. Digital images
were acquired with a MicroFire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) connected to an Olympus
BX-41 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, United States). Image
quantification was conducted using MATLAB software using an object-based colocalization
analysis. DAPI+ cells were identified out of the total area of the sectioned tissue and quantified
by applying Otsu’s thresholding method, the watershed transform, and individual cluster
thresholding. Then, each cell’s colocalization with immunofluorescent markers was quantified.

For confocal imaging, whole tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde then stained
with primary and secondary antibodies as described above. The labeled samples were then
cleared in Murray’s clear solution for optical clearing for 45 min before being imaged via
confocal microscopy (Nikon A1Si laser scanning confocal microscope, Nikon Instruments Inc,
Tokyo, Japan).
2.7 Static Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion Assay
We investigated the function of hPSC-derived β -cells in vitro under all scaffold conditions by
a glucose stimulated insulin secretion assay. Immature β-cells derived from hPSCs in vitro have
a capacity for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), though the magnitude of response
may not be the same as fully mature functional β-cells. To analyze GSIS, scaffold cultures were
first exposed to basal levels of glucose (2.8 mM), which was dissolved in Krebs-RingerBicarbonate (KRB) buffer, and incubated for an hour. Samples of the buffer were collected to
measure insulin levels using ELISA. The scaffolds were then washed in fresh basal level
glucose and next exposed to a high-level glucose concentration (28 mM) for an hour. Samples
of the buffer were collected for ELISA as outlined above. The quantification of insulin secretion
at the various glucose exposures represent the GSIS.
2.8 Statistics
All statistical analyses were conducted using Prism graphing and data analysis software
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, United States). Values were reported as the mean ±
SEM.

3. Results

structure (Fig 1A) with distinct material properties that can distinguish the role of structure
relative to the role of the material. We first evaluated cluster formation within the microporous
scaffold cultures (Fig 1B) compared to the traditional suspension culture (Fig 1C). hPSCderived pancreatic progenitors dissociated into single cells were initially seeded onto
microporous scaffolds at a density of 12.5 million cells/cm3 for culture. Through confocal
microscopy, we found that this seeding density was not sufficient for cluster formation to
occur as cells were localized to the surface of the pores (Fig 1D). Increasing the seeding
density 10-fold to 125 million cells/cm3 resulted in the cells assembling into 3D clusters within
one day after seeding (Fig 1E), which resembles the self-organization that occurs in
suspension cultures. These observations indicated that the assembly of cells into clusters
could be supported within the micropores, yet was dependent on the cell density. This high
cell seeding density resulted in a uniform distribution of cells and clusters across both
scaffold surfaces. At densities greater than 125 million cells/cm3, cells began to clump on the
surface. Cell viability was consistently high (>90%) throughout the 14‐day experiment, and
similar for all scaffold conditions (Fig 1F-K). These results demonstrated that the pores could
facilitate cluster formation.
3. 2 Maturation of β-cell clusters within scaffolds
We next investigated the feasibility of generating β-cell clusters in microporous scaffolds
by measuring the expression of β-cell marker genes, which were compared with cells
generated in suspension culture and human islets. Using real-time quantitative PCR (qRTPCR) analysis, we found cells cultured within both PEG and PLG scaffolds had significant
increases in expression of endocrine hormone marker genes (INS and GLUC) relative to Stage
IV pancreatic progenitors. Additionally, β-cell maturation markers (MafA, G6PC2, and PCSK1)
had expression levels on scaffold cultures that were comparable to suspension culture controls.
We also used the tunable design of the scaffold to assess how varying the pore size would

influence maturation. A correlation between scaffold pore sizes and the expression of key β-cell
markers was observed, with larger pore sizes resulting in better maturation. For PEG scaffolds,
pore sizes in the range of 250-425 µm and 500-600 µm had expression of pancreatic
transcription factors (PDX1 and Nkx6.1) (Fig 2A) that was comparable to human islets. For
scaffolds with pore sizes smaller than 250 µm, the expression of Nkx6.1, a marker for mature

β-cells, was lower than human islets and suggested the cells have not fully matured.
Additionally, relative to pancreatic progenitors, the expression of insulin only had a significant
increase on scaffolds with pore sizes of 250-425 µm and 500-600 µm. This trend between
scaffold pore size and cell development was observed in the expression of β-cell maturation
markers as well. Scaffolds with a pore size of 250-425 µm resulted in the highest expression
of the insulin gene transcription factor, MafA, with the 500-600 µm pore size scaffolds
exhibiting the second highest expression. The maturation marker proprotein convertase 1
(PCSK1) is one of the key enzymes associated with insulin processing and showed
expression levels to be higher in scaffold cultures with 250-425 µm pore sizes compared to the
other scaffold pore sizes as well as suspension clusters.
hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitors cultured on PLG scaffolds similarly demonstrated
the development of maturing β-cells with maturation showing a correlation with pore size (Fig
2B). Insulin expression for PLG scaffold cultures with 250-425 µm pore sizes was
significantly increased relative to the pancreatic progenitors. The expression of pancreatic βcell transcription factor PDX1 in all four PLG scaffold conditions were lower than human islets
but comparable to suspension clusters. On the other hand, Nkx6.1 expression was
significantly lower in PLG scaffolds when compared to the suspension culture. While this
suggests maturation could be improved, PLG scaffolds with 250-425 µm pore sizes did show
increased expression in the key maturation marker, PCSK1, relative to pancreatic
progenitors. Overall, cells cultured in PEG and PLG microporous scaffolds generally showed
increased expression levels of β-cell maturation markers. While the maturation was still not

comparable to human islets, this deficit relative to islets is to be expected as in vivo
transplantation is necessary to reach full maturation. This analysis revealed that the
differentiation of pancreatic progenitors to β-cells cultured in the PLG and PEG microporous
scaffold was, at a minimum, comparable and improved under some conditions to the
traditional suspension culture. Our observations identified a relationship between scaffold
pore size and β-cell maturation with 250-425 µm pore size showing more significant
improvements in β cell development than in suspension culture. Thus, the following studies
focused on scaffolds with a pore size of 250-425 µm.

3.3 Cell-cell communication in microporous scaffold cultures during β-cell maturation
Next, we investigated cell-cell interactions within the scaffold culture that drive maturation in
the pancreatic niche environment. The cell surface adhesion protein epithelial cadherin (ECAD)
plays a critical role in the development of islets and intra-islet communication and is implicated
in efficient insulin secretion from β-cells[45,46]. Thus, we assessed the presence of ECAD
through qRT-PCR and immunostaining in both scaffold cultures and suspension clusters. ECAD
gene expression levels in hPSC-derived immature β-cells cultured in microporous scaffolds had
a closer resemblance to the expression in human islets than suspension clusters (Fig 3A). PEG
scaffold cultures had a higher expression level compared to suspension clusters. However,
compared to human islets, both PEG (2.84±0.96 vs 6.70±1.22, n=3, P<0.05) and suspension
culture (0.57±0.03 vs 6.70±1.2, n=3, P<0.01) conditions showed lower ECAD gene expression.
The PLG scaffold culture (3.05±1.21, n=4) had expression that increased relative to suspension
culture and was comparable to human islets. The promotion of cell-cell interactions in scaffolds
was confirmed with immunostaining. E-cadherin protein expression was shown to be localized
to specific regions in the suspension clusters (Fig 3B) whereas, in scaffold cultures, expression
was distributed throughout the clusters (Fig 3C). Imaging analysis of DAPI+ cells colocalized
with the cell-cell adhesion marker, ECAD, per the total area revealed PLG scaffold cultures
increased protein expression of ECAD compared to suspension (42.8% ± 5.1 vs 11.2% ± 2.9 of
total cell population, n=4; P<0.01). Our data suggests that microporous scaffold cultures,
particularly PLG, promote cell-cell interactions that can play a role in driving β-cell maturation.

3.4 hPSC-derived β-cell glucose-responsive in vitro function within microporous scaffolds
The function of these β-cell clusters in scaffolds was next examined by their ability to
secrete insulin in a glucose-responsive manner. Scaffold cultures and suspension clusters at
the end of the six-stage differentiation were exposed to 2.8 mM and 28 mM glucose solutions,
respectively. We observed a sharp increase in insulin secretion from the scaffold cultures when

exposed to a high concentration of glucose. hPSC-derived β-cells cultured on the PLG scaffold
had the highest insulin secretion index, with a threefold increase compared to the suspension
culture control (1.34±0.20 vs 0.43±0.06, n=3, P<0.01) (Fig 4). PEG scaffold cultures also
showed higher insulin secretion compared to the suspension control (1.11±0.09, n=3,
P<0.05) yet lower insulin secretion than PLG. These results indicate that hPSC-derived β-cells
cultured on microporous scaffold cultures are capable of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,
which represents functional maturation. Since the PLG scaffold demonstrated a higher degree
of function compared to PEG, subsequent studies employed this material for further
investigation of the matrix environment supporting β-cell maturation.

3.5 ECM deposition by hPSC derived β-cell clusters
We subsequently assessed the ECM within the cultured cells, as ECM basement membrane
proteins are a critical component of the pancreatic environment supporting islets. Since cells

cultured on PLG scaffolds showed signs of islet-like development and function, we used
immunofluorescence analysis to investigate if the cells were establishing a matrix similar to the
pancreas within the scaffold. Our results showed ECM proteins, collagen IV, laminin and
fibronectin, were present in both suspension clusters (Fig 5A-C) and in PLG scaffold cultures
(Fig 5D-F). Imaging analysis confirmed that the percentage of DAPI+ cells localized to ECM
protein expression in the PLG scaffold cultures were comparable to suspension (collagen IV:
43.5%±3.5 vs 42.5%±11.8; n=4; laminin: 42.5%±6.2 vs 50.9±2.3, n=3; fibronectin: 41.1%±5.1 vs
50.7±4.3, n=3) (Fig 5G). The distribution of ECM protein across the cell cluster were analyzed
using a statistical autocorrelation function, which determines the correlation length (Lc) (Fig 5H).
For our purposes, the Lc quantifies the heterogeneity of image texture to show if the
fluorescently-labeled protein was concentrated in large clumps or distributed across smaller
regions. The Lc of PLG scaffold cultures was relatively low, indicating that ECM proteins were
clustered in small, well distributed regions, while the suspension cultures had a relatively high Lc
suggesting the ECM proteins were clumped into larger structures (18.2 µm ± 3.2 vs 68.3 µm ±
10.0, n=3, P<0.0001). Thus, the scaffolds had a more homogeneous distribution of ECM
proteins throughout the β-cell clusters compared to suspension culture.

The presence of ECM protein deposition on the naked scaffold motivated studies in which
ECM proteins commonly found in the pancreas were deposited on the scaffold prior to cell
seeding as a means to further enhance maturation. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we investigated
pancreatic progenitor maturation to β-cells on PLG scaffolds coated with either Collagen IV,
Laminin or Matrigel. Naked microporous scaffolds and scaffolds coated with ECM proteins
showed comparable levels of expression for endocrine transcription factors (PDX1 and Nkx6.1)
(Fig 6A). However, only naked scaffolds and Matrigel coated scaffolds exhibited an increase in
insulin expression relative to pancreatic progenitors. Evaluating cell maturation on the scaffolds
also showed that, relative to pancreatic progenitors, only the naked scaffold cultures enhanced
the expression of PSCK1. An analysis of the expression of pancreatic-related ECM genes
demonstrated that the expression of COL4A1 gene, coding for collagen type IV, in naked
scaffolds as well as scaffolds coated with Collagen IV and Laminin was comparable to human
islets. However, a decrease of COL4A1 gene expression was observed in suspension cultures
and scaffolds coated with Matrigel (Fig 6B). Laminin production, indicated by LamA5 gene, was
observed to be comparable to human islets across all culture conditions. Finally, we assessed
maturation through glucose-responsive function and, interestingly, observed scaffold cultures
pre-coated with ECM proteins did not show a significant improvement in β-cell function
compared to naked scaffolds (0.63±0.03 for PLG with Matrigel, 1.15±0.15 for PLG with
Laminin, 1.02±0.17 for PLG with Collagen IV compared to 1.34±0.20 for PLG, n=3) (Fig
6C). These findings indicate initial introduction of ECM does not substantially improve
maturation at the end of the scaffold culture, which could be potentially due to deposition of
matrix proteins by cells throughout the culture.

4. Discussion
Microporous polymer scaffolds formed from synthetic materials can support the
differentiation of hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitors toward immature β-cells in vitro. We
chose scaffolds made from synthetic materials as they have been widely used for islet
transplantation[43,44,47], and are generally easy to manufacture. This microporous architecture
provides the opportunity to control and support the 3D organization of cells into β-cell clusters.
hPSC-derived β-cells cultured on the scaffold showed significantly increased gene
expression of pancreatic endocrine hormones, INSULIN and GLUCAGON, relative to
pancreatic progenitors. Furthermore, the expression of β-cell maturation markers (MAFA,
PCSK1, and G6PC2) was increased on the scaffold compared to the suspension clusters. βcell maturation was further investigated through glucose-responsive functional tests that
demonstrated cells cultured on the scaffold had higher insulin secretion than suspension

clusters. The high porosity and interconnected pores of the scaffold may allow clusters to
communicate through paracrine factors similar to the pancreas tissue[48,49]. Despite their
similar biomaterial design, the microporous scaffolds also exhibited a few differences in how
they influenced cell differentiation. PEG scaffold cultures showed a more significant increase in
the expression of β-cell maturation markers than PLG scaffolds. On the other hand, ECAD
expression suggested that the PLG scaffolds supported cell-cell interactions comparable to
islets, which could have played a role in the higher insulin secretion observed in PLG scaffolds
versus PEG scaffold cultures. Despite the difference in materials, the architecture of the
material supported the formation of β-cell clusters, suggesting a role of the material structure in
enhancing maturation.
The microporous scaffold provides an environment conducive to controlling the size of the
structures and promoting cell-cell connectivity that is essential for maturation. The size of
transplanted islets has been previously reported to impact insulin secretion and viability[50–
52]. Small islet clusters can exhibit low amounts of insulin secretion, which has been attributed
to limited cell-cell contact, while excessively large clusters are considered to have limitations
from nutrient availability[53]. Based on these results with islets, the influence of pore size,
which would determine the hPSC-derived β-cell cluster size, was investigated. Protocols
generally rely on hPSCs to spontaneously cluster in suspension resulting in the end-stage
clusters varying in size, though efforts have started to focus on establishing a mechanism for
controlling the size of the transplanted clusters due to the influence on long-term viability and
the secretion of sufficient insulin[53]. Physical manipulation and shear have largely been
employed to provide control. The pores of the scaffold can provide a direct control on cluster
size. Our results suggest that clusters forming within 250-425 µm pores maximally support
maturation toward β-cells. The pore size, in combination with seeding density, are also critical
for promoting cell-cell interactions[54]. At low seeding densities, the cells were observed to
primarily attach to the walls of the pores. However, increasing the cell density increasingly

favored cell-cell interactions within the pore. Expression of E-cadherin was increased within
scaffold culture relative to suspension culture, and E-cadherin staining was observed primarily
between cells within the pores and not at the material surface. E-cadherin is a key player in
maturation as studies have shown that E-cadherin immune-neutralization reduces both basal
and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion[45]. Collectively, the microporous scaffold can be
employed to control the formation of clusters, and to favor cell-cell interactions that are
influential in maturation.
In addition to cell-cell interactions, interactions between stem cells and the extracellular
matrix can induce lineage-specific differentiation and support the function of differentiated cells
by providing a composite set of chemical and structural signals[55]. Herein, we report that
differentiating cells deposit ECM proteins within the scaffold, with the composition resembling
that found in the basement membrane around islets. Furthermore, relative to suspension
culture, we found ECM proteins were more homogeneously distributed for the scaffold culture,
with ECM proteins available for interaction with β-cells throughout the cluster. The suspension
clusters had ECM deposited in relatively large clumps as indicated by the increased Lc. Matrix
deposition by the cells is likely a key step in maturation, as key integrins change over
developmental stages[56]. This deposition of matrix initiates the formation of a niche, which is
normally present in islets and influences maturation and function. Attachment of cells to ECM
may also benefit β-cells by maintaining tissue architecture and preserving specific intercellular
relationships within the pores. Interestingly, scaffolds coated with either collagen IV, laminin or
Matrigel showed comparable maturation to naked scaffolds that relied on cell-secreted ECM,
which contained collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin. The analysis of glucose-responsive insulin
secretion on ECM coated scaffolds and naked scaffolds showed β-cell function was similar
across all conditions as well.

This research demonstrates that scaffolds may function as a platform for manufacturing βcells for transplantation. Suspension cultures have been used for aggregated hPSC-derived βcell production, without the need for feeders and using procedures that are scalable to generate
sufficient cells. However, hydrodynamic shear force-related cellular damage presents a
challenge for suspension cultures generally[57]. Furthermore, the increasing culture volumes
can influence the size of cell aggregates, which has previously been linked to apoptosis-related
cell loss, cellular differentiation, and heterogeneity[58]. Culture on scaffolds represents an
alternative manufacturing platform that has been employed for tissue engineered products[59].
The pore size can be employed to control the size of aggregates, and similarly the culture on
scaffolds may also decrease the effects of hydrodynamic shear on clusters[60]. The scaffold
design can be tuned to control cluster size, with ECM deposition on the supportive matrix.
Similar to organoid development in three-dimensional cultures[26–32], the cells establish a
functional niche during in vitro culture that may enhance engraftment in vivo. Furthermore, the
scaffolds are formed from materials that have been used in vivo, and thus the cell-material
construct could be directly transplanted, which has the added advantage of maintaining the
niche that has developed within the scaffold. Collectively, scaffolds have the potential to serve
as a component of the manufacturing of β-cells for transplantation.
