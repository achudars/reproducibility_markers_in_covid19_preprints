Abstract. Bacteria typically occur either as free-swimming planktonic cells or within a

23

sessile, biofilm mode of growth. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transition between these

24

lifestyles is known to be modulated by the intracellular secondary messenger cyclic dimeric-

25

GMP (c-di-GMP). We are interested in the control of distinct biofilm-relevant phenotypes in

26

P. aeruginosa through the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP. Here, we characterise

27

motility and associated biofilm formation and dispersal in two pairs of related multi-domain

28

proteins with putative c-di-GMP turnover domains, selected to contain additional PAS (Per-

29

Arnt-Sim) homology domains known for their ability to process environmental stimuli. The

30

enzymes PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 have distinct functions despite their similar domain

31

structures. The DrbdA deletion mutant showed significantly increased biofilm formation

32

while biofilm formation was impaired in DPA2072. Using a GFP transcriptional reporter

33

fused to the cyclic di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter, we show correlation between biofilm

34

phenotype and c-di-GMP levels. Both proteins are shown to play a role in nitric oxide (NO)

35

induced biofilm dispersal. We further studied pseudo-enzymes of similar architecture.

36

PA5017 (DipA) is an inactive cyclase, and PA4959 (FimX) is described here as an inactive

37

cyclase/phosphodiesterase. Loss of swimming and twitching motilities, respectively, is

38

observed in deletion variants, which correlated with NO-induced biofilm dispersal

39

phenotypes, as DdipA dispersed less well while DfimX dispersed better than wild type. The

40

study highlights how Pseudomonas differentiates c-di-GMP output – in this case motility –

41

using structurally very similar proteins and underlines a significant role for pseudo-enzymes

42

in motility regulation and associated biofilm dispersal.

43

Importance. Bacterial biofilms exert pervasive economic and societal impact across a range

44

of environmental, engineered and clinical contexts. The secondary messenger cyclic

45

guanosine di-phosphate, c-di-GMP, is known to control the ability of many bacteria to form

46

biofilms. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has 38 putative

47

enzymes that can regulate c-di-GMP turnover, and these proteins modulate various cellular

48

functions and influence bacterial lifestyle. The specific protein sensory domains and

49

mechanisms of motility that lead to biofilm dispersal remain to be fully understood. Here we

50

studied multi-domain proteins with the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) homology domains, these being

51

classic sensors to environmental stimuli. Our study demonstrates the significant roles for the

52

pseudo-enzymes PA4959 (FimX) and PA5017 (DipA) in regulation of biofilm phenotype and

53

motility. Further, enzymes with highly homologous structures, such as PA0861 (RbdA) and

54

PA2072, have almost orthogonal function in biofilm and motility control.

Introduction

56

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium known for its environmental

57

versatility. As an opportunistc pathogen, P. aeruginosa causes disease, particularly in

58

immune compromised individuals, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic

59

fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic colonisation in lungs and airways1. The ability of P.

60

aeruginosa to form biofilms within CF patients causes increased antibiotic tolerance, which

61

makes treatment of infections problematic in clinical settings2.

62

P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and dispersal are known to correlate with intracellular

63

concentrations of the secondary messenger, cyclic dimeric-GMP3,4. The production and

64

degradation of c-di-GMP relies on two enzymatic activities. Diguanylate cyclases (DGCs)

65

synthesise c-di-GMP from two GTP molecules, while phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyse

66

the secondary messenger to linear pGpG, and in some cases GMP3. PAO1 encodes 17

67

different proteins with a DGC domain, 5 with a PDE domain, and 16 that contain both of

68

these domains as a fusion (DGC-PDE)5. Within P. aeruginosa, intracellular c-di-GMP levels

69

can be regulated by a number of environmental cues, including nutrient availability and the

70

presence of nitric oxide6,7. Indeed, DGC and PDE-containing proteins typically also have one

71

or several putative regulatory domains, such as the ubiquitous PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain8.

72

In P. aeruginosa PAO1, twelve genes code for proteins with PAS domains linked to DGC

73

domains, nine of which additionally contain PDE domains5, namely pa0285, pa0290, pa0338,

74

pa05759, pa0847, pa0861 (rbdA10), pa1181 (yegE), pa2072, pa4601 (morA11–13), pa4959

75

(fimX14), pa5017 (dipA15), and pa5442. The recurrence of proteins with similar architecture,

76

and which play a role in biofilm regulation, poses two key questions: Firstly, if DGCs and

77

PDEs regulate the transition between sessility and the planktonic state, how do the specific

78

protein sensory domains then control mechanisms of motility? Secondly, while speculated to

79

be c-di-GMP sensors, what is the role of proteins with DGC or PDE domains that are

80

rendered inactive due to mutations altering the active sites of enzymes, and thus their

81

catalytic activity? This knowledge is urgently needed to understand the mechanisms

82

regulating biofilm dispersal.

83

The main motility types in P. aeruginosa PAO1 are flagella mediated swimming; pili

84

mediated twitching; and the complex swarming motility, which relies on flagella, pili and

85

surfactants and involves multicellular group movement on a surface16,17. The regulatory

86

relationships between c-di-GMP and different motility types have been investigated for a

87

number of P. aeruginosa proteins. CheA and the partitioning protein ParP were shown to

88

control the subcellular localisation of DipA in chemotaxis, controlling reduction of c-di-GMP

89

and swimming motility in PAO118. Deletion of RbdA was also reported to reduce

90

swimming10. Over-expression of diguanylate cyclases can inhibit swimming motility

91

significantly, as seen with the DGC SadC19. SadC is part of a regulatory circuit involving the

92

phosphodiesterase BifA that regulates swarming through modulation of flagellar reversal

93

rates20,21, while the flagellar stators MotAB and MotCD directly respond to c-di-GMP

94

levels22. Most studies of swarming have focussed on the role of this motility in biofilm

95

formation20,23,24, but a time-lapse microscopy study reported a role for swarming in

96

dispersal25,26. A bidirectional relationship between c-di-GMP and swarming through so called

97

Mot proteins is established for P. aeruginosa PA1427, however data for P. aeruginosa PAO1

98

are sparse.

99

To dissect their roles in biofilm regulation, we created P. aeruginosa PAO1 deletion mutants

100

of the twelve identified PAS-DGC-PDE proteins and compared them to wild-type PAO1. We

101

selected the highly homologous enzymes PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 which we show to

102

have different roles in biofilm control, the protein PA5017 (DipA) that is a phosphodiesterase

103

coupled to an inactive diguanylate cyclase15, and the protein PA4959 (FimX) with an inactive

104

cyclase domain and a phosphodiesterase domain with contradicting reports of catalytic

105

activity14,28–31 that are addressed here. Deletion mutants were characaterised for biofilm

106

morphology, EPS production, c-di-GMP level as quantified using a GFP reporter system, and

107

variation in motility. Dispersal phenotype for each deletion mutant was also assessed using

108

the nitric oxide (NO) donor S150. Our data reveal specific alterations in phenotype and

109

motility that play significant roles in both biofilm structure and in the response to NO which

110

correlate with NO-induced swarming motility and biofilm dispersal.

complemented through protein structure homology modelling carried out using the SWISS-

118

MODEL server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org)34. As a template for DGC domains, PleD

119

(PDB 2V0N35) was used, while MorA (PDB 4RNH11) was used as a template for PDE

120

domains. While inspecting substrate binding sites and catalytic centres of the homology

121

models, conservation of catalytic residues and compatibility with substrate binding was taken

122

as an indicator of enzymatic activity.

123

Bacterial strains and culture media. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are

124

listed in Table S1. Routine overnight cultures were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium.

125

Biofilms were grown in standard M9 minimal medium. Antibiotics were used at the

126

following concentrations: for P. aeruginosa PAO1, gentamicin was used at 30 µg/ml,

127

carbenicillin at 400 µg/ml, kanamycin at 300 µg/ml and tetracycline at 60 µg/ml; for E. coli

128

S17-1, gentamicin was used at 15 µg/ml, ampicillin at 100 µg/ml, tetracycline at 30 µg/ml,

129

kanamycin at 50 µg/ml and streptomycin at 50 µg/ml.

130

Isogenic P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutants. Isogenic mutants were constructed by replacing the

131

coding regions of each gene with a gentamicin resistance cassette as previously described36.

132

The Gm cassette was amplified from pPS85637 using primers Gm-F and Gm-R (primer

133

sequences listed in Table S2). For each gene, flanking up- and downstream regions

134

(approximately 350-400 bp) were amplified by standard PCR, digested with EcoRI and

135

HindIII, and ligated to the amplified Gm cassette. To generate KO plasmids, the PA-up-Gm-

136

PA-dn fragments were inserted into the SmaI site of the pEX100T suicide vector, which

137

contains the sacB gene for counter selection and an ampicillin resistance gene on the

138

backbone. Plasmids were introduced into E. coli S17-1 by chemical transformation and then

139

transferred into PAO1 by conjugation. Transconjugants were first selected on Pseudomonas

140

isolation agar containing 30 µg/ml Gm and then patched onto LB agar with 10 % sucrose and

141

30 µg/ml Gm and LB agar with 400 µg/ml carbenicillin. Colonies that only grew on LB agar

142

with 10 % sucrose and 30 µg/ml Gm but not on LB agar with 400 µg/ml carbenicillin were

143

selected as double-recombinant mutants and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. For the

144

generation of the double DpilAfliM mutant, the gentamycin cassette was used for the

145

introduction of a single mutant, with a kanamycin cassette used to introduce the second

146

mutation. This Km cassette was amplified from pCR™4-TOPO™ (Invitrogen) using primers

147

Km-F and Km-R.

148

Batch culture P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms. Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh M9

149

media (OD600nm ~0.01) to inoculate microtiter plates or MatTek plates (P35G-1.5-14-C),

150

using 100 µl or 3 ml of diluted culture, respectively. Microtiter plates were incubated

151

statically, while MatTek plates were shaken at 50 rpm to create shear force facilitating

152

biofilm formation, changing M9 media every 24 hrs. Biofilms in microtiter plates were

153

stained with 0.1 % (w/v) crystal violet and dissolved in 30 % (v/v) acetic acid. Biofilms in

154

MatTek plates were stained with LIVE/DEAD® BacLight (Invitrogen) and examined by

155

confocal laser scanning microscopy. Crystal violet staining was determined at a wavelengths

156

of 584 nm, while wavelength of 488 nm and 561 nm were used for SYTO-9 and propidium

157

iodide excitation, respectively. At least 3 image stacks were taken from random locations in

158

each MatTek plate. Biofilm biomass and surface coverage were analysed by COMSTAT38,

159

while microcolony sizes were analysed by merging confocal images stacks with ImageJ to

160

measure identified microcolonies with DAIME39. For NO donor experiments, 250 µM

161

Spermine NONOate (S150, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into MatTek biofilm plates and

162

incubated at 37 °C for 2 hrs to trigger dispersal.

163

NO donor release determination. The concentration of NO donor released from specific NO

164

donors (Table S3) was quantified using a chemiluminescence-based method adapted from

165

Piknova et al.40. Once released from the donor, free NO and O3 formed activated NO2, which

166

emits a detectable photon upon relaxation. Both SNP and S150 were dissolved in M9

167

medium and tested at 37 °C. For SNP, two concentrations were tested under different light

168

conditions – 5 µM was tested under normal light while 500 mM was tested with/without a

169

cold light trigger. For S150, 5 µM was tested under normal light. Values were compared

170

with standards determined from a sodium nitrate, tri-iodine solution. Details of the method

171

used are found in the supplementary data.

172

Determination of swarming motility. Swarming agar plates were prepared from 0.5 % (w/v)

173

agar (Sigma Aldrich) in 8 g/L nutrient broth (Oxoid) and 5 g/L glucose (Sigma Aldrich). NO

174

donor swarming plates additionally contained SNP at a final concentration of 1 µM.

175

Swarming plates were dried under laminar flow for 40 mins and inoculated with 3 µl late

176

exponential culture. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 hrs under normal laboratory light

177

conditions. For swarming agar with SNP, 10 mM SNP stock solution was made in sterilised

178

PBS and then incorporated into 50 °C swarming agar to a final concentration of 1 µM.

Determination of swimming motility. Tryptone broth (10 g/L tryptone, Oxoid) with 5 g/L

180

NaCl and 0.3 % (w/v) agarose (Melford) were used to prepare agar plates for swimming

181

motility assays. The plates were dried under laminar flow for 15 mins and inoculated from an

182

overnight LB agar plate with a sterile 2 µl pipette tip. Incubation at 30 °C was carried out for

183

20 hrs.

Determination of twitching motility. Twitching agar plates were prepared from LB broth

187

EPS extraction and quantification. Biofilms with an initial inoculum of diluted overnight

189

culture (OD600nm ~0.01) were cultured in tissue-culture treated dishes (Corning, UK, D×H

190

100mm×20mm). Cell scrapers were used to harvest bacteria, re-suspending and vortexing

191

them in 3 ml PBS, from which 100 µl were taken for CFU counts. Supernatants were directly

192

analysed for soluble polysaccharide and protein content, while 2 ml 0.85 % NaCl and 12 µl

193

37 % formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) were added to the cell pellets after centrifugation to

194

determine the insoluble polysaccharide and protein content. Mixtures were vortexed and

195

incubated at 4 °C for 1 hr. Addition of 2 ml 1 M NaOH and 0.5 ml H2O was followed by

196

further incubation for 3.5 hrs. Supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g (40

197

mins, 4 °C) and freeze-dried. Dried supernatant was dissolved in water and adjusted to pH 7

198

using H2SO4. The polysaccharide content was determined using the phenol-H2SO4 method41

199

by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm; with glucose used as a standard. The protein content

Structure and enzymatic activity of twelve PAS-DGC-PDE proteins

217

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome encodes 38 proteins with either diguanylate

218

cyclase (DGC) or phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains. These are often found in multi-domain

219

proteins with a variety of auxiliary domains, such as putative regulatory domains or

220

membrane segments. Within PAO1, additional domains are exclusively found N-terminal to

221

the DGC or the PDE domains, or to the DGC-PDE tandem5. While membrane domains are

222

most common, the PAS domain, named after the Per-Arnt-Sim homology8, is the second

223

most commonly found domain. To better understand the widespread usage of this

224

architecture in DGC and PDE proteins, we studied the multi-domain proteins that contain

225

PAS sensor domains together with DGC and/or PDE domains.

226

Twelve proteins were identified in P. aeruginosa PAO1 that contained PAS domains together

227

with DGC and/or PDE domains, Figure 1. Of these, eight are associated to the membrane, as

228

evidenced by the presence of at least one predicted transmembrane segment. The number of

229

predicted PAS domains in these proteins varies from one to four. Further sensory or

230

regulatory domains are predicted for several of these proteins. For example PA0575 also

231

contains a periplasmic domain, PA5017 (DipA) carries an additional GAF domain, PA0847

232

contains a HAMP domain and PA4959 (FimX) contains a REC domain.

233

All twelve proteins contain DGC domains, with nine of them containing an additional PDE

234

domain. For several of these proteins, enzymatic activity has been reported; others have been

235

shown to be inactive as is indicated in solid colour in Figure 1. For the proteins that were not

236

reported to be either active or inactive, we have investigated conservation of the enzymatic

237

signature motifs as an indication of catalytic activity. For DGC domains, conservation of the

238

GGDEF motif is required, as the aspartate and glutamate residues in this motif are required

239

for catalysis. For EAL domains, the EAL and DDFGTG motifs are required, contributing a

240

glutamate and two aspartates to the catalytic centre, respectively.

241

We have investigated the conservation of these motifs through sequence alignment33. Where

242

present, deviations from archetypal catalytic motifs were compared to existing examples of

243

identical atypical motifs and analysed using homology modelling. The potential for substrate

244

binding was ascertained from the homology models by inspection of catalytic centres. DGC

245

domains were modelled after the substrate-bound structure of Caulobacter crescentus PleD

246

(PDB 2V0N35), and PDE domains were modelled after the substrate-bound structure of P.

247

aeruginosa MorA (PDB 4RNH11). Domains with predicted enzymatic activity are shown in

248

striped shading in Figure 1.

249

Of the twelve PAS-DGC and PAS-DGC-PDE domain proteins, two have been identified to

250

contain inactive c-di-GMP metabolising domains. PA4959 (FimX) has been experimentally

251

determined to have a degenerate DGC domain, and while enzymatic activity of the PDE

252

domain remains a somewhat contested subject within the field due to contrasting reports of c-

253

di-GMP hydrolysis, with those reporting activity doing so at a very low level, we have

254

labelled the domain as inactive, in line with others, as it contains degenerate catalytic motifs

255

not compatible with the established mechanism of EAL catalysed PDE activity14,28–31.

256

PA5017 (DipA) contains an active PDE, but an inactive DGC15.

257

The deletion mutants of DfimX, DdipA, DrbdA and Dpa2072 have

258

characteristic biofilm phenotypes

259

Deletion mutants for the twelve PAS domain containing DGC/PDE proteins shown in Figure

260

1 were constructed as described in the Methods. We selected the two mutants, DdipA and

261

DfimX, to understand how (partially/fully) inactive sensor-enzymes function in biofilm and

262

motility modulation. Additionally, we selected the mutants DrbdA and Dpa2072 to

263

characterise through which trait they exert effects on biofilm behaviour, as they showed a

264

striking difference in biofilm phenotype from an initial phenotypical screen (data not shown).

265

These genes encode proteins that are highly homologous in structure.

266

PAO1 biofilms reached maturation stages with substantial microcolonies after 48 hrs and

267

269

first visual inspection of CSLM images, Figure 2A, much thicker biofilms than PAO1 WT

270

were observed in DrbdA, with increased microcolony formation but equal height at the base of

271

the biofilm. The opposite was true for Dpa2072 that lacks substantial microcolony formation.

272

The biofilms of the mutants DdipA and DfimX, on the other hand, are similar to PAO1 WT.

273

The biomass, the surface coverage and the maximum microcolony sizes were determined to

274

distinguish the development of morphologies. The data, normalised to PAO1 WT, are shown

275

in Figure 2B-D. The different appearance in the thicker biofilms of DrbdA is reflected in a

276

nearly five-fold increase of microcolony size, Figure 2B, and a more than two-fold increase in

277

biomass, Figure 2C. In contrast, Dpa2072 showed much reduced microcolony size compared

278

to WT, and only one fifth of the biomass. These phenotypes also affected biofilm surface

279

coverage, which for Dpa2072 was only about one third of WT Figure 2D. The data suggest

280

that PA2072 and RbdA play opposite roles in PAO1 biofilm formation, which is surprising

281

given their very similar domain architecture, Figure 1.

282

Interestingly, this analysis reveals also a difference for the less conspicuous DfimX deletion

283

mutant, as the biofilms show half of the WT biomass, Figure 2C, combined with unchanged

284

maximum microcolony size or surface coverage, Figure 2B and 2D, suggesting a different

285

biofilm structure for DfimX. Similarly, DdipA shows comparable biomass and microcolony

286

size compared with WT, Figure 2B and 2C, but increased surface coverage, Figure 2D, again

287

pointing at subtle differences in biofilm structure.

288

The protein and polysaccharide content of the EPS matrix, normalised to cell density, was

289

determined. Consistent with the increased biomass and surface coverage observed for the

290

deletion mutant DrbdA, Figure 2C and Figure 2D, enhanced total protein and polysaccharide

291

are observed, Figure 3. The structurally related protein Dpa2072, however, produced

292

comparable EPS with WT, again pointing at functional differences between these two

293

homologous proteins. The increased protein and polysaccharide mass of DfimX does not

294

directly correlate to biofilm structure but is another indicator of a difference in the structure

295

of DfimX biofilms.

296

The differences of the DdipA and DfimX deletion variants to PAO1 WT are aparent when

297

bacterial motility is investigated. Flagellum mediated swimming motility is severely

298

supressed in DdipA, and the phenotype is indeed similar to the flagellum mutant DfliM and

300

DrbdA mutant.

301

impairment that is comparable to the pili mutant DpilA. In contrast, and as previously

302

reported14, pili mediated twitching motility is abolished in DfimX, similar to the pili DpilA

303

mutant and the pili flagellum double mutant DpilADfliM, Figure 4B.

304

Correlation of NO-induced dispersion with c-di-GMP concentration and

305

swarming motility

306

A NO donor assay was used to explore biofilm dispersal. The efficacies of commercially

307

available donors were determined (see Table S3 and Supplement), and two treatment regimes

308

were selected based on their efficiency to induce dispersal. Generally, a concentration of 250

309

µM SNP was used for 12 hrs, however for mature biofilms 250 µM S150 was used for 2 hrs to

310

reduce treatment time and side effects observed with SNP (see Supplement). Biomass

311

reduction of mature (72 hrs) biofilms grown in MatTek plates was determined, Figure 5.

312

Using this metric, NO induced dispersal was impaired in DrbdA, Dpa2072 and DdipA

313

compared with PAO1 WT, but significantly increased for DfimX.

314

As biofilm formation and dispersal are closely linked to intracellular c-di-GMP levels3, a c-

315

di-GMP responsive GFP reporter was used to compare relative intracellular levels between

316

each mutant and WT before and after NO treatment. Intracellular c-di-GMP levels were

317

increased within DrbdA but significantly lowerd for Dpa2072, Figure 6A, correlating with

318

their 48 hrs biofilm phenotypes, Figure 2. This relationship breaks down for the significantly

319

increased reported c-di-GMP levels of DdipA, Figure 6A, which showed biofilm phenotypes

320

similar to WT, Figure 2. Interestingly, all four mutants showed an impaired c-di-GMP

321

response on NO donor addition, implicating them in NO-mediated modulation of intracellular

322

c-di-GMP concentration, Figure 6B, despite the impairment of DrbdA, Dpa2072 and DdipA to

323

disperse, Figure 5.

324

We thought to relate the impaired NO dispersal phenotype of DrbdA, Dpa2072 and DdipA to

325

motility. Biofilm dispersal has been linked to swarming motility, which in P. aeruginosa

326

depends on pili and flagella17,44, and this motility increases upon exposure to the biofilm

327

dispersal signal NO45. Indeed, swarming is strongly supressed in DdipA, and is also reduced in

328

the presence of NO donor for this mutant, Figure 7. Although not as dominant as DdipA, the

329

deletion mutant DrbdA also showed a significant reduction in swarming, and swarming is also

330

reduced in the presence of NO donor. The behaviour of DdipA and DrbdA is comparable to

331

the flagellum mutant DfliM and the pili flagellum double mutant DpilADfliM, Figure 7. In

332

contrast, DfimX which dispersed better with the NO donor, Figure 5, also showed a larger

333

swarming area than PAO1 WT, comparable to the pili DpilA mutant, Figure 7. Equally, the

334

response to NO donor is significantly more prominent than PAO1 WT, Figure 7. Interestingly,

335

Dpa2072 showed a swarming phenotype comparable to PAO1 WT and does not display

336

increased swarming upon NO treatment.

337

Taken together, NO-induced biofilm dispersal and changes in swarming behaviour are

338

correlated for the mutants. For DdipA, DrbdA and Dpa2072 as well as DfliM and DfliMDpilA

339

swarming is less pronounced or inhibited, Figure 7, while NO induced loss in biomass is

340

impaired, Figure 5. In contrast, DfimX as well as DpilA swarm better than wild type, Figure 7,

341

while NO induced loss in biomass is also increased, Figure 5.

342

Discussion

343

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial biofilm formation and dispersal are regulated by

344

intracellular c-di-GMP concentration in response to environmental signals4,6. The

345

understanding of enzymes that can regulate c-di-GMP levels, such as diguanylate cyclases

346

(DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and their linked sensor domains will be an essential

347

step to disentangle the network that controls this physiological switch. Bacteria carry these

348

enzymatic activities in multi-domain proteins, allowing for a tight control of catalytic activity

349

and allowing functional diversity through the presence of various regulatory domains. It is

350

unknown whether the total of 38 DGC and PDE enzymes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

351

PAO1 have redundant functions5.

352

Of the cohort of 38 DGC/PDE proteins, twelve have regulatory PAS domains, Figure 1. PAS

353

domains are known as dimerisation domains that respond to a variety of environmental

354

triggers46,47. Since DGC and PDE enzymes must dimerise to become catalytically

355

active3,11,28,48,49, PAS domains could link a sensory and a dimerisation function and thus

356

provide an elegant solution to integrate signalling with enzyme activation. In the cohort of

357

DGC/PDE proteins, two pairs of highly homologous proteins were identified to test for their

358

functional redundancy. The small proteins PA0290 and PA0338 form the first pair, while

359

PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 form another pair. We used a phenotypical selection based on

360

biofilm formation and NO-induced biofilm dispersal, and present data on PA0861 (RbdA),

361

which has been studied before10,50, and the previously uncharacterised protein PA2072. Both

362

proteins share a similar structure, with two predicted membrane segments and a cytosolic PAS

363

domain coupled to a DGC/PDE tandem50.

364

Using deletion mutants, we show that both DrbdA and Dpa2072 show differences to WT

365

PAO1 in microcolony formation. The five-fold increase of microcolony size in DrbdA leads to

366

thicker biofilms and is reflected in a two-fold increase in biomass with enhanced total protein

367

and polysaccharide in the EPS. In stark contrast, microcolony sizes are much reduced for

368

Dpa2072, with consequent formation of much thinner biofilms than WT PAO1 that reached

369

only one fifth of the biomass after 48 hrs. The phenotypes of DrbdA and Dpa2072 also

370

affected biofilm surface coverage, Figure 2. The observed phenotypes are in keeping with

371

reported c-di-GMP levels, which are higher for DrbdA but lower for Dpa2072 when compared

372

with PAO1 WT, Figure 6. This supports the conclusion that these homologous proteins

373

perform opposite roles, rather than being redundant.

374

It is notable that several of the 38 Pseudomonas aeruginosa DGC and PDE proteins are not

375

enzymes as they show mutations in their catalytic motifs. From the set of twelve PAS

376

containing DGC/PDE proteins, this is true for the well-studied proteins PA4959 (FimX) and

377

PA5017 (DipA). Our in silico analysis and earlier data28,29,31 indicate FimX has an inactive

378

DGC and supports evidence of an inactive PDE, Figure 1. Similarly, while DipA possesses an

379

inactive DGC, its PDE was reported to be active15, which is in keeping with the in silico

380

analysis performed here. While analysis of biofilm phenotypes showed little difference to

381

PAO1 WT, motilities were severely affected in the deletion mutants, Figure 4. Flagellum

382

mediated swimming motility was significantly reduced in DdipA, as reported previously18,51,

383

while DfimX shows a twitching defect pointing to altered pili function52. It is known that FimX

384

is required for the assembly of pili at low intracellular c-di-GMP levels53; a demand that can

385

be bypassed when c-di-GMP levels increase54. While DfimX shows comparable c-di-GMP

386

levels to PAO1 WT, deletion of dipA led to an upregulated intracellular c-di-GMP, pointing

387

at a role in c-di-GMP turnover as the protein is an active phosphodiesterase (only the DGC

388

function is perturbed), Figure 6. The observations lead to the suggestion that these proteins

389

function in the regulation of motility traits, potentially interacting with other c-di-GMP

390

regulating enzymes through the degenerate DGC (DipA, FimX) or PDE (FimX) domains. This

391

dimerisation behaviour may well be in response to a trigger received by the N-terminal

392

regulatory PAS domains.

393

The three mutants DrbdA, Dpa2072 and DdipA highlight a correlation between swarming

394

motility and NO-triggered biofilm dispersal, Figure 5 and Figure 7. Previous work reported

395

a nirS mutant unable to produce NO endogenously being deficient in swarming motility,

396

while a nearly 10-fold upregulation of nirS was observed in swarming cells compared to non-

397

swarmer planktonic cells55. Furthermore, addition of NO was shown not only to decrease

398

intracellular c-di-GMP but also increase swarming in PAO145, suggesting a link between NO,

399

c-di-GMP and swarming regulatory circuits.

400

We demonstrate decreased swarming for the deletion mutants DrbdA, Dpa2072 and DdipA

401

and decreased biofilm dispersal, similar to the flagellum and pili/flagellum double deletion

402

mutants DfliM and DpilADfliM. We note that in DpilA, the swarming pattern was altered

403

(smooth edges without tendrils). Swarming patterns are similar to the ∆pilA mutant for DfimX,

404

which is in keeping with their abolished pili mediated twitching motility, Figure 7. However,

405

increased swarming and better dispersal are documented for DfimX, similar to the pili mutant

406

DpilA (for analysis of pili and flagellum deletion biofilm phenotypes see Figure S1), further

407

supporting correlation between swarming and NO induced dispersal.

408

Conclusion

409

In this study we demonstrate that PAS containing phosphodiesterases / diguanylate cyclases

410

modulate different facets of motility behaviours, biofilm phenotype and dispersal responses.

411

This is displayed clearly through DrbdA and Dpa2072 gene deletion mutants, which, despite

412

coding for proteins of very similar domain architectures, display almost opposing

413

physiological functions. Studying DfimX and DdipA, we add information on pseudo-enzymes

414

into the picture, which prove to play significant regulatory roles not linked to c-di-GMP

415

turnover function. In doing so we highlight an interplay between complex behaviours such as

416

motility and biofilm regulation.

NO-donor selection

740

To date, studies of P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersal have utilised a number of different

741

compounds as NO donors, including organic nitrates, nitrite esters, S-nitrosothiols56,

742

diazeniumdiolates (NONOates)57, and, sodium nitroprusside (SNP)6,41,45. Due to this broad

743

range of NO donors, a wide range of concentrations have been reported to be necessary to

744

induce biofilm dispersal from 500 nM to 500 µM6,15,45,58. Further complications arise from the

745

chemistry of SNP, which does not release NO without photolysis59, or the addition of

746

reducing agents60, and in doing so releases the toxic side product cyanide61. To determine the

747

most relevant NO donor for this study, we selected a number of commercially available NO

748

donors (Table S3) to quantify their NO release and to test their efficacies to induce PAO1

749

biofilm dispersal.

750

NO donor efficacy screening (modified from O’Toole et al62). An overnight culture of P.

751

aeruginosa was diluted into fresh M9 media with an initial inoculum of OD600nm 0.01 and

752

100µl per well in microtiter plates. The plates were incubated statically at 37°C. For NO

753

treatments, donors listed with their half-life times in Table S3 were tested at concentrations

754

between 1-500 µM, using treatment times between 1-24 hrs. Crystal violet staining showed

755

that 250 µM SNP and 250 µM S150 were sufficient to induce a significant biofilm dispersal

756

(~60%) after 24 and 2 hours, respectively, and these donors were selected for further study

757

Figure S2A.

758

NO release quantification using chemiluminescence (modified from Piknova et al40). Free NO

759

gas was detected in a chemiluminescence analyser, using an inert carrier gas (synthetic air,

760

99.99999 % BOC). NO reacts with O3 (derived from O2 in normal atmospheric conditions) to

761

form nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in its activated state, and NO2* emits a photon:

762

NO + O3 → NO2* + O2

763

NO2* → NO2 + hv (photon)

764

Using a CLD 88Y NO analyser (EcoPhysics, Duernten, Switzerland), the photomultiplier tube

765

was equipped with a long pass filter, detecting emissions above 600 nm, and the NO

766

concentration is calculated from the emitted intensity against a calibration standard40. A NO

767

standard was prepared by converting sodium nitrite solution to NO using tri-iodide (I3-)

768

solution:

771

A mixture of KI, I2 and glacial acetic acid were used to generate the I3 solution. For the I3

772

solution, 500 mg Potassium iodide (KI) and 379.8 mg crystalline iodide (I2) were dissolved in

773

10 ml water to produce final concentrations of 301.2 mM and 137.8 mM respectively. The

774

solution was kept away from light and mixed with glacial acetic acid in a 2:7 ratio by stirring

775

on a magnetic plate for 30 mins. The CLD 88Y was equilibrated at 60 °C starting the carrier

776

gas flow. The I3 solution (7.5 ml) was placed into the reaction vessel, bubbling gently through

777

the cell, and NaNO2 standards were applied to generate a standard curve (3 replicates each at

778

250, 375, 500, 750 and 1000 pmol NO). NO donors used a test volume of 9.5 ml (in M9

779

medium) with 500 µl of stock NO donor solutions at 37 °C. A consistent cold light source was

780

applied as appropriate (Photonic PL®3000, maximum light intensity 26 Mlx, color

781

temperature 3250 K). Tracings were recorded at 4 Hz frequency using PowerChrom® (eDAQ

782

Pty LtD, Australia). Data were plotted using Origin 9, calculating areas to quantify NO

783

release, comparing NO donor samples against standards.

784

We quantified the precise NO release of both SNP and S150 in biofilm culture medium at a

785

concentration of 5 µM across a 2 hrs timeframe, Figure S2B. As can be seen from Figure

786

S2B, 50 nmol S150 released NO at a decreasing rate over time and within 1.5 hrs had

787

released around 68.4 nmol NO. SNP showed a constant release of NO in the observation

788

window but much lower than S150, and across 1.5 hours had released 4.69 times less NO

789

than S150. As SNP requires photolysis60, we also examined the effect of a cold light source

790

on NO release from SNP. Using 500 µM SNP, we demonstrated that only under strong light

791

induction can SNP release NO efficiently, but this is still much less efficient than the

792

spontaneous donor S150, Figure S2C. Therefore, SNP is ideal for long-contact treatment

793

(>12 hrs) under normal light conditions, while S150 is useful for short-contact treatment (2

794

hrs), according to specific requirements in different experiments. As such, SNP was chosen

795

for 24 hrs incubation, used for swarming agar assays, while S150 was used for triggering

796

mature biofilm dispersal within 2 hrs contact time.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy images used for phenotypic analysis of 72 hrs mature

807

biofilms before or after 2 hrs treatment with 250 mM SNP for the flagellum mutant DfliM, the

808

pili mutant DpilA and the double mutant DpilADfliM compared with PAO1 WT (scale bar 25

809

µm). Biofilm mass after treatment was normalised against WT, highlighting differences in

810

biomass reduction for the mutants. The Student’s T-test was used to determine significances,

811

where *** denotes a confidence level of p<0.01, and ** denotes a confidence level of
