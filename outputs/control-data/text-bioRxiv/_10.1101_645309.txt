Abstract
During autumn in the temperate zone, insectivorous male bats face a profound energetic challenge,
as in the same period they have to make energy choices related to hibernation, mating and
migration. We found evidence by looking at biometric measurements that male pond bats (Myotis
dasycneme) are pre-occupied with mating and lose weight, while simultaneously females are
accumulating fat. Our purpose was to characterize the known hibernacula in terms of male or
female bias, and subsequently compare their population trend during two study periods, between
1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Our findings include evidence of colonisation of winter roosts in formerly
unoccupied areas and consequently a change in the migration patterns of the male population of
this species. As male bats do not assist to raise their offspring, males have abundant time to restore
their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the
summer habitat not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating
season and presumably also has the additional advantage of increased paternity. Additionally, these
findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation
assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences.
Introduction
In contrast to bird migration, bat migration and its specifics are virtually unknown, such as its
relation to summer distribution patterns, or how bats cope with energetic challenges and changing
habitat. Bat species in the Northern hemisphere are almost all insectivorous., Due to lack of food
resources, winters are spend in hibernation. In most species, male and female bats live in segregated
summer habitats [1, 2; 3, 4, 5]. In autumn sexes meet in mating roosts, the male roosts, or the
winter roosts [6, 7, 8]. The migration behaviour of bats between their summer and winter roosts is
unique. Birds and large ungulates move from areas of low or decreasing resources (i.e. food) to areas
of high or increasing resources [9, 10]. In contrast, the direction of migration in bats is mostly
determined by the location of hibernacula with the suitable physiological requirements [11]. As a
consequence, bats in the Northern hemisphere are sometimes observed migrating in northern
directions from their summer roosts [12]. Among bats, distances between summer and winter
habitat of more than several hundreds of kilometres are relatively uncommon. Exceptions in Europe
are, for example, Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus nathusii, with the longest observed distances of

up to 3,000 km [12]. Such distances are still meagre compared to the tens of thousands of kilometres
some birds of similar sizes sometimes undertake [13]. Nonetheless bat migration has a substantial
impact on energy balance [14, 15].
There are profound differences between the energy choices related to hibernacula selection for
male and female bats [6]. Migration prior to hibernation not only takes a considerable energy cost, it
also involves a long time spend with flying, perhaps alternated with fuel accumulation and time
spend waiting for optimal conditions. Migration season and mating season overlap, therefore time
and energy spend on migration is not available for mating. Although applicable for both male and
females, this trade-off is probably more important to males, as lacking in mating activities combined
with mating in suboptimal time and place may decrease their chances of fathering offspring. As male
bats do not assist in to raise their offspring, males have abundant time to restore their energy
balance after hibernation. In contrast, female bats begin their gestation in March/ April and are
under considerable time pressure to return to their maternity roost and raise their offspring [16].
Males, however, are thought to spend more energy in mating before hibernation, which puts them
for the dilemma of mating or migrating. Papers which present interesting life history trade-offs are
plentiful, most are about female choice, age of first reproduction, in combination with longevity and
hibernation choices [e.g. 17, 18]. Several studies have shown sex influenced differences in
distribution patterns [3, 19], indicating that reproductive and energetic choices may also play a role
in migration behaviour. In this paper we present an unique example of how choices of the males
affect life history.
Here we characterize the known hibernacula of the pond bat, Myotis dasycneme, in terms of male or
female bias, and subsequently compare their population trend during two study periods, between
1930-1980 and 1980-2015. To do so, we first imputed the missing values in the dataset. We
predicted energy spend during mating cannot be spend on hibernation. Hence, we assessed the
changes of the body condition index of bats during summer period. We compared migration
distance, calculated by using mark recapture data, in the period before and after the settlement in
the new hibernacula. Based on previous research [20], we hypothesized that the mating and
hibernation are trade-offs, and thus we expected that a change in mate site location will lead to a
change in migration distance.
Methods
Study area, periods and dataset
The study area covered the whole of the Netherlands, Belgium and East Frisia (northwest Germany).
This area is considered the habitat of the “West European pond bat population”, an isolated
population at its western limit of its distribution range [based on 21]. Hibernacula of this population
are found along the southern and eastern border of its range, in Belgium, North France, West
Germany and the southern part of the Netherlands. Since 1980 hibernacula sites also include several
bunkers in Zuid-Holland and Gelderland (the Netherlands). Maternity roosts of this population are
predominantly found in the centre of its range, in the Dutch lowlands, with male roost along the
edges of the female habitat [22].
We defined two study periods, data collected between 1900 and 1980 (‘the historical dataset’) and
data between 1980 and 2015 (‘the recent dataset’). The historical data were gathered from
literature [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] and natural history museum collections. The recent data were
gathered from the Dutch Mammal Society and from own observations by the first author [22, 30,
31]. These data were supplemented by data gleaned from publications [23, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and
atlases, such as the atlas of the bats of the Netherlands [27], the Flemish region of Belgium [37, 38]
and for several atlases of German Federal States [39, 40, 41]. Records of marked bats with rings and
their biometry data were gathered from the first author and from the former Laboratory for Animal
Ecology and Taxonomy of Utrecht University, former office of third author.

Ringing and biometry
All available mark and recovery data (ringing) of both the historical and recent migration research
were digitized. Observations include location and date of capture, species, sex and ring number. The
latest observations in the recent dataset also include biometric measurements (forearm length,
body weight) and information about age and reproductive status [42]. The biometric measurements
were used to derive the body condition index of each individual. Bat captures were carried out
under license from the Dutch Ministry of Economic affairs, (permits FEF27b/2002/034,
FF/75A/2003/150, FF/75a/2006/013, FF/75a/2008/033, FF75a2012/37a and with permissions of all
site owners. Ringing was carried out under license of Animal Experiments Committee UDEC 02036,
06058, 07124, 98055 and Alt 09-01). All bats were released within one hour, at the point of capture.
Winter hibernation surveys
Hibernation surveys are often included in national monitoring programs [43, 44]. Sites are visited
once each winter systematically searched with torch light until all visible bats were found and
identified (without disturbing the bats). Although winter monitoring has its biases [e.g. 45, 46, 47],
the data can be used to estimate coarse trends in abundance. For this paper we selected winter
roosts with three or more records of three of more pond bats in one or both of the study periods.
Only data from sites with long term data series (from the hibernacula in the Dutch provinces of ZuidHolland, Gelderland and Limburg) were used for analysis of abundance. Unfortunately, due to a
change in regulations, legal access to the Dutch limestone mines needed to carry out monitoring
surveys has become problematic since 2011. Hence, we present winter data in this particular area
only up to 2011.
Statistical analysis
We calculated trends and annual abundance using General Linear Models (GLMs) with a Poisson
error distribution, implemented in the software TRIM [48]. This programme is able to derive the
values of missing observations based on previous and succeeding values. We used the linear trend
model with all change points included (this is because of the absence of observation in 1949). Nonsignificant change points were excluded stepwise. In this paper winter abundance data are
expressed as imputed annual abundance and abundance indices (using the first year as a base year,
i.e. 100%).
Results
Mating effects, weight of males during autumn
The biometric measurements of the marked pond bats, showed that male pond bats are on average
a few percent smaller and lighter than females. Analysis of our dataset revealed that changes of the
body condition index of both sexes do not occur simultaneously, each is related to its respective
reproductive cycle (Fig. 1). Near week 34, after their offspring is fully weaned, females start
accumulating fat reserves. The pond bat mating season starts in week 28, from this time males are
preoccupied with mating activities and as a consequence lose weight. Instead of accumulating fat,
the weight of males drops and they start falling behind. Just before the start of the winter, 4-8 weeks
later than females, males reach their pre-hibernation weight. This difference between male and
female body condition index just before hibernation stresses the potential gain males may have in
adapting their migrating behaviour.

A total of 113 unique hibernacula, 59 in Limburg, 38 in Zuid-Holland, 16 in Gelderland were surveyed
during this study. The first colonization of hibernacula in formerly unoccupied areas occurred in the
beginning of the 1980s (Fig. 2). A few pond bats (males) were found in 12 bunkers in the provinces of
Zuid-Holland and Gelderland (hereafter referred to as the core bunkers), respectively along the
western border and in the centre of the distribution range of the West European population. The
bunkers were relative new sites; built during the Second World War (WOII) [e.g. 49]. Although sites
adjacent to these core bunkers were visited annually, pond bats remained (nearly) absent until the
year 1997 (referred to as the second colonization event). After an exponential increase in almost all
sites (14 sites in Gelderland and 28 in Zuid-Holland), today’s numbers are 503 times higher than in
the colonization year.
This strong increase is in stark contrast to the population trend observed in Limburg and Southern
Belgium. In a span of 20 years, between 1941 and 1961, the annual counts in 59 sites in the
Netherlands Limburg decreased from 350 to 132 individuals. Instead of abandonment of sites, the
average density of animals per site decreased from 6.1 to 3.2 pond bats. In the same period in
southern Belgium the hibernation population decreased from an estimated 200 animals to a meagre
20 animals (11.6% decrease based on 58 hibernacula [50]. Since 1980, hibernation populations in
Limburg and Southern Belgium remained more or less at the same reduced level after the decline.

Zuid-Holland after 1980. The two lines represent two types of hibernacula; core sites (12 roosts,
unbroken line) and satellite sites (30 roosts, broken line).
Assemblage in hibernacula is either male or female biased
The total western population of pond bats based on summer counts is estimated at approximately
24,000 bats (assumed females:males = 1:1) [21, 30]. A very small proportion of this population is
observed during the winter, approximately 1,500 bats [21, 30]. Hibernation location of the rest of
the population is unknown.
We presume (large) site-specific underrepresentation of the true numbers of hibernating bats is
likely, due to variations of internal characteristics of each site (e.g. size, number of cracks and
crevices) and the roosting ecology (pond bats are considered to hibernate mostly in cold crevices
[51]. Research pioneers, such as Punt and Van Nieuwenhoven [52] and Kugelschafter [53], showed
such an error can be considerable. Although our results might be biased based on the above
statement, we made estimations of the male: female ratio in bunkers and limestone mines. We
found that the bunkers are predominantly inhabited by males (approximately male:female = 8:1),
while the limestone mines were predominantly female biased (before 1980 approximately
male:female = 1:3 (based on original data gathered by Laboratory for Animal Ecology and Taxonomy
of Utrecht University, after 1980 approximately male:female = 1:5).
Change in migration distance
Before 1980 over 3,000 pond bats were captured and marked (Table 1a). A total of 1,214 pond bats
have been ringed in their maternity roosts, marked animals were predominantly females and their
offspring. An unknown number of bats were captured in their hibernacula in Southern Belgium, both
Netherlands and Belgian Limburg and the Eifel region [54, 55, 23, 32, 28]. The reported recoveries of
these ringed animals digitized by us showed that the animals spending the summer in the
Netherlands migrated long distances to hibernacula in the Southern Netherlands (Limburg), Belgium
(Namur) and in Germany (Fig. 3a). Animals from the Dutch province of Friesland were often
recovered to the south in Southern Limburg in the Netherlands and to the east in Germany with a
preference for the Teutoburg forest region [28, 56].
After 1980 a total of 1,727 pond bats were captured and marked (195 in their winter habitat and
1,532 in their summer habitat, Table 1a). Of the 193 recaptures, 127 (97 males and 30 females) were
found in the bunkers near their summer habitat. Only a small number of animals were recovered at

distances greater than 50 km from their original place of capture. These long distance migrants, both
adult and sub-adult, were recovered in hibernacula such as the fortresses in Antwerp, bunkers in
Calais (France), several sites in the Teutoburg forest region, limestone mines in Limburg and
underground caves in the Eifel (Fig. 3b). No recoveries were made in the province of Namur
(southern Belgium).

Discussion
We find evidence for the energetic trade-off between mating and migration by looking at
confounding factors such as BCI. The overall ratio of males and females present in the hibernacula
investigated in this study was not uniform, we found typical male and female assemblages. The
typical migration distance in the first study period (1930-1980) far exceeds that of the distance
during the second study period (1980-2015). Therefore, in accordance with the results of this study,
we argue that males after spending energy on mating, prefer to hibernate locally. Indeed, we find a
strong increase in the population size in the local hibernacula. Taken together, these results indicate
that the trade-off between hibernation, mating and migration is present.
Several other authors showed energy spend during migration has a large impact on life history. This
paper leads to new insights how migration, mating and hibernation interact. Our finding that males
choices led to settlement of new (before 1945 not existing) local hibernacula, followed with a
change of migration patterns, are unique. Our study exemplifies how bats were able to adapt, within
40 year time, to a changed habitat. Unfavourable anthropogenic activities in foraging habitat and
near the maternity dwellings are happening in a very rapid tempo. Perhaps our results can help
define conservation priorities and timelines, to prevent endangered bats from going extinct.
All bats seem promiscuous, both females and males mate several times. Females tend to visit the
males in their mating sites. In some species multiple maternity colonies make use of one mating site,
both throughout the mating season and on individual nights [57]. In other species, such as Myotis
nattereri, it has been shown that females from a single maternity colony attend multiple mating sites
[58]. Other studies show that females visit these mating sites only for one or several nights, then
returning to their maternity roost [59, 60]. During a telemetry project on pond bats, not linked to
this study, the first author observed a similar pattern of alternate use of maternity and mating site.
This mating system is only possible when mating sites are within short flying distance of maternity
sites. While pond bats are considered long distance migrators, with the settling of the males in local
hibernacula, we assume they managed to reinstall their favoured mating system.
The trade-off between mating, migration and hibernation is also seen in other mammalian clades,
such as ungulates and seals [e.g. 61, 62]. In such systems males spend a lot of energy defending
females and are considered territorial. Male bats have a similar mating behaviour, known as
swarming [63]. Swarming behaviour, with intense flight activity, circling in and around the entrance
of a site, is considered an interspecies social event and besides mating it also believed to play an
important role in the assessment of the suitability of a hibernaculum [64] and/ or information
transfer regarding its location [65]. Unlike other bat species, pond bats tend to spend little time
swarming in front of the entrance, but spend more time outside making long patrol flights to and
from the entrance. Presence of large groups of pond bats in the bunkers in Zuid-Holland in the
period August –October suggest that they spend their time in temporary harems, like Myotis myotis

[66]. Given that we do not have individualized data of the behaviour of male bats, we cannot
determine the exact nature how they spend their energy. Future studies into the mating behaviour
of the pond bat can help draw this conclusion.
On basis of our biometry data it can be understood that males have the largest gain in the change of
hibernacula closer to the summer habitat, as their fatting up period between mating season and
hibernation is shortest. Their trade-off between the risk of choosing a new, maybe not suitable
hibernaculum, and a longer trip to the well-known hibernacula seems to pay off, as their numbers
are increasing rapidly. Possible additional advantages are the increase in the length of the mating
season (and thus greater chance of siring offspring) and a strong first male advantage. Other studies
suggest the number of offspring sired is significantly affected by the position in the mating sequence
[67], so this increased first male advantage may be a significant gain. The first male advantage is also
known with another bat species, such as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum [68].
Conservation implications and applications
Our findings have several notable implications for monitoring surveys. The non-uniform distribution
of males and females across hibernacula can influence the monitoring results and lead to false
conclusions. Whereas a change in population size in a female site may reflect the trend during the
summer, similar changes in population size in a male biased site may only reflect a changed
preference of site selection. Therefore, we advise to form conclusions about observed changes in
population trend based on the hindsight of results presented in this paper.
The energetic arguments presented in this paper confirm that the function of hibernacula for a
population of bats as a whole can differ; from male biased assemblages with a predominant role in
mating to females biased assemblages with a predominant role for stable hibernation. In accordance
to their function such sites may also differ critically in terms of their conservation value for the
corresponding species. In addition, protection measurements and microclimate preferences for such
site may also differ accordingly.
