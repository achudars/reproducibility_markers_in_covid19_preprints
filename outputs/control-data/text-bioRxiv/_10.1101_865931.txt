We propose scOpen, a computational method for quantifying the open chromatin status of regulatory regions from
single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) experiments. scOpen is based on positive-unlabelled learning of matrices and
14

estimates the probability that a region is open at a given cell by mitigating the sparsity of scATAC-seq matrices.
We demonstrate that scOpen improves all down-stream analysis steps of scATAC-seq data as clustering, visualisation and chromatin conformation. Moreover, we show the power of scOpen and single cell-based footprinting
analysis (scHINT) to dissect regulatory changes in the development of fibrosis in the kidney.

Introduction

16

The simplicity and low cell number requirements of assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequenc-

17

ing (ATAC-seq)1 made it the standard method for detection of open chromatin enabling the first study of open

18

chromatin of cancer cohorts2 . Moreover, careful consideration of digestion events by the enzyme (Tn5), allowed

19

insights on regulatory elements as positions of nucleosomes1, 3 , transcription factor binding sites and the activity

20

level of transcription factors4 . The combination of ATAC-seq with single cell sequencing (scATAC-seq)5 further

21

expanded ATAC-seq applications by measuring the open chromatin status of thousands of single cells from healthy6

22

and diseased tissues7 . Computational tasks for analysis of scATAC-seq include detection of novel cell types with

23

clustering (scABC8 , cisTopic9 ); identification of transcription factors regulating individual cells (chromVAR10 ); and

24

prediction of co-accessible DNA regions in groups of cells (Cicero11 ).

25

Usually, the first step in the analysis of scATAC-seq is detection of open chromatin regions by calling peaks

26

on the scATAC-seq data by ignoring cell information. In a second step a matrix is built by counting the number of

27

digestion events (reads) per cell in each of the previously detected regions. This matrix usually has a very high

28

dimension (> 106 regions) and a maximum of two digestion events are expected for a region per cell. As with scRNA-

29

seq12–14 , scATAC-seq is effected by dropout events due to loss of DNA material during library preparation. These

30

characteristics imply that scATAC-seq count matrices are extremely sparse, i.e. 3% of non-zero entries. In contrast,

31

scRNA-seq have less severe sparsity (> 10% of non-zeros) than scATAC-seq due to smaller dimension (<20.000

32

genes for mammalian genomes) and lower dropout rates for genes with high or moderate expression levels. So far,

33

no computational approach addresses the extreme sparsity and low count characteristics of scATAC-seq data.

34

We here present scOpen, which uses positive-unlabelled (PU) learning15 to find dropout events and to estimate

35

the probability that a region is open in a particular cell. scOpen algorithm models dropout rates in a cell specific

36

manner and can analyse large scATAC-seq matrices in a few minutes. The resulting probability matrix can then

37

be used as input for usual computational methods for scATAC-seq data as clustering, visualisation and chromatin

38

conformation (Fig. 1a). Moreover, we adapted the footprint based transcription factor activity score from HINT-ATAC4

39

to infer TFs regulating clusters of scATAC-seq cells (scHINT). We demonstrate the power of scOpen and scHINT by

40

the analysis of regulatory networks driving the development of fibrosis with a novel scATAC-seq time-course dataset

41

of 31,000 cells in murine kidney.

Results

43

scOpen outperforms imputation methods on scATAC-seq cell clustering

44

We first tested if scOpen improves clustering of scATAC-seq data. For this, we made use of three public scATAC-

45

seq data sets: blood cell progenitors (hematopoiesis)6 ; subsets of T cells 7 and a combination of six cell

46

lines5 . The use of a standard peak calling pipeline16 detected 50,000 to 120,000 open chromatin regions with

47

3-4% of non-zero entries, confirming the extreme sparsity of scATAC-seq data (Supplementary Table 1). We

48

compared scOpen with imputation and matrix denoising methods proposed for scRNA-seq [MAGIC12 , SAVER17 ,

49

scImpute18 and DCA19 ]; a scATAC-seq imputation method part of cisTopic (cisTopic-impute) and the raw count

50

matrix. These matrices were given as input to a clustering method and evaluated with Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)20

51

regarding the agreement with known cell labels as before9 . Notably, scOpen outperforms all competing methods

52

by presenting the highest ARI values in all three data sets (Fig. 1b). cisTopic performed well in Hematopoiesis

53

and T cells, but failed in discerning some of the cell lines (Supplementary Fig 1). The discriminative power

54

of scOpen is also supported by t-SNE21 projections of these data sets, which indicate a clear separation of the

55

majority of cell types ( Supplementary Fig. 1-3). Altogether, these results support that scOpen outperforms current

Fig. 1. scOpen improves clustering and downstream analysis of scATAC-seq. a, scOpen receives as input a
sparse count matrix with number of reads per cell, where regions can be derived by peak calling based on an
aggregated scATAC-seq library. After matrix binarisation, scOpen performs PU learning to find the probability of a
region to be open in a cell by detection of dropout events. This matrix can then be given as input for usual
scATAC-seq methods for clustering, visualisation and interpretation of regulatory features. b, Evaluation of
clustering accuracy by applying distinct imputation/denoising methods to the scATAC-seq matrix in three
benchmarking datasets. ARI values (y-axis) of 1 indicate a perfect agreement of the clustering with the true labels.
c, Scatter plot comparing clustering results (ARI) of the three benchmarking datasets by providing raw (x-axis) and
scOpen estimated matrices (y-axis) as input for state-of-art scATAC-seq methods (scABC, chromVAR, Cicero and
cisTopic). d, Odds ratio (y-axis) of Cicero predicted co-accessible sites also supported by pol-II ChIA-PET (solid
line) and PC Hi-C (dashed line) vs. distance between sites (x-axis). Red lines correspond to raw matrices and blue
to scOpen estimated matrix. Odds ratio superior than 1 indicates a positive relationship. e, Visualisation of
co-accessibility scores (y-axis) of Cicero predicted with raw (red) and scOpen (blue) estimated matrices contrasted
with scores based on RNA pol-II ChIA-PET (purple) and promoter capture Hi-C (green) around the CD79A locus
(x-axis). For ChIA-PET, the log-transformed frequencies of each interaction PET cluster represent co-accessibility
scores, while the negative log-transformed p-values from the CHiCAGO software indicates Hi-C scores.

scOpen estimated matrix improves scATAC-seq analysis

58

Next, we tested the benefit of using scOpen estimated matrices as input for usual scATAC-seq methods, e.g.,

59

scABC8 ,chromVAR10 ,cisTopic9 and Cicero11 . Therefore we compared the clustering accuracy (ARI) of these four

60

methods with either raw or scOpen estimated matrices. scABC is the only evaluated method offering clustering as a

final result, while other methods (chromVAR, Cicero and cisTopic) first transform the scATAC-seq matrix to either

62

transcription factors, genes or topics feature spaces. These features are provided as input for clustering as described

63

before9 . In 11 out of 12 combinations of methods and datasets, we observed a higher ARI whenever scOpen matrix

64

was provided as input (Fig. 1c) as reflected in t-SNE plots (Supplementary Fig. 4-6). Moreover, the highest ARI

65

for a given dataset always involved the use of scOpen estimated matrix. Prior to estimating gene centric open

66

chromatin scores, Cicero first predicts co-accessible pairs of DNA regions in groups of cells. We compared Cicero

67

predicted conformation with Hi-C and ChIA-PET on GM12878 cells as in11 and observed that the use of scOpen

68

matrix improves the detection of GM12878 interactions at both global (Fig. 1d) and individual levels (Fig. 1e). Taken

69

together, these results indicate that the use of scOpen estimated matrices improves downstream analysis of state-of

70

the art scATAC-seq methods.

71

scOpen and footprinting analysis identifies novel hematopoietic progenitor subpopulations

72

Visualisation of the scOpen estimated matrix using t-SNE indicates both known and novel sub-types of hematopoietic

73

progenitor cells (Fig. 2a)6 . To further explore this, we estimated the optimal number of clusters with gap statistic22 ,

74

which indicates a total of 10 groups with sub-groups of known cell types (Supplementary Fig. 7a-b). While

75

HSC/MPP, CMP and GMP sub-clusters resemble differentiation stages previously reported by Buenrostro and

76

colleagues6 , we observed that the MEP progenitors form two sub-populations of cells (Fig. 2a; Supplementary

77

Fig. 7c), which have not been described before6, 9 . We characterised regulatory features (transcription factors)

78

controlling these sub-clusters with chromVAR10 and HINT-ATAC differential footprinting analysis4 . We observed

79

a good agreement between TFs activity scores predicted by chromVAR and HINT-ATAC (average R = 0.59;

80

Supplementary Fig. 8)). Both HINT-ATAC and chromVAR indicate that the dimmer GATA:TAL has high activity at

81

MEP1 but also at MEP2 clusters. Only HINT-ATAC detects high activity scores of KLF and NFY23 family factors

82

in MEP1 cells (Fig. 2b-c; Supplementary Fig. 8). Both GATA1 and TAL1 are important regulators of erythroid

83

and megakaryocyte specification; KLF1 is known to bias differentiation towards erythroid cells24, 25 . Moreover, we

84

observed higher open chromatin signals in the promoter of the megakaryocyte marker EPOR (and KLF1) in MEP1

85

cells, while the erythroid marker GP1BA has higher open chromatin in MEP2 cells (Fig. 2d). These results indicate

86

that MEP1 and MEP2 represent sub-populations of cells primed towards erythroid or megakaryocyte cell types,

87

respectively. In short, we show how the combined use of scOpen and footprinting analysis with HINT-ATAC are able

88

to detect and characterise two novel sub-group of cells.

89

Novel insights into chromatin accessibility in key fibrosis driving cells by scOpen

90

Next, we evaluated scOpen in its power to improve detection of cells in a complex disease data set. For this, we

91

performed whole mouse kidney scATAC-seq in C57Bl6/WT mice in homeostasis (day 0) and at two time points after

92

injury with fibrosis: 2 days and 10 days after Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO)26, 27 . Experiments recovered a

total of 31,670 high quality cells (average of 14,752 reads per cell) and displayed a high reproducibility (R > 0.99)

94

between duplicates (Supplementary Fig. 9; Supplementary Tab. 1). After data aggregation, 252,146 peaks were

95

detected, resulting in a highly dimensional and sparse scATAC-seq matrix (3.2% of non-zeros). Next, we performed

96

data integration for batch effect removal28 using either raw matrix or scOpen estimated matrix (Supplementary

97

Fig. 10). For benchmarking purposes, we annotated the scATAC-seq profiles using the label transfer approach28

98

from an independent study of single nucleus RNA-seq of the same kidney fibrosis model29 . Notably, we observed

99

that clusters on scOpen estimated matrices are more similar to transferred labels (higher ARI) than clusters based

100

on raw matrix for either integrated or day specific data (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 10). This again supports the

101

power of scOpen to mitigate scATAC-seq sparsity.

Clustering results of scOpen estimated matrices recovered all major kidney cell types including proximal tubular

cells (PT), distal/connecting tubular cells, collecting duct and loop of henle, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune

104

cells, as well as the rare population of podocytes (Fig. 3b). Identity of clusters, which were initially characterised by

105

transferred labels, are further supported by gene level scores of known marker genes (Supplementary Fig. 11). Of

106

particular interest are cell types with population changes during progression of fibrosis (Fig. 3c; Supplementary

107

Fig. 12). We observed an overall decrease of normal proximal tubular, glomerular and endothelial cells and increase

108

of immune cells as expected in this fibrosis model with tubule injury, influx of inflammatory cells and capillary

109

loss30, 31 (Supplementary Fig. 12). Importantly, we detected an increased frequency of a PT sub-population

110

we identified as injured PT characterised by an increased accessibility around the widely used PT injury marker

111

Kim1(Havrc1)32 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, the fibrosis driving myofibroblast population also showed

112

a gradual increase over time after injury and was characterised by increased accessibility around Fbln2 and

113

Dcn33 (Supplementary Fig. 13).

114

scHINT dissects cell specific regulatory changes in fibrosis

115

Next, we adapted HINT-ATAC4 to dissect regulatory changes in scATAC-seq clusters (scHINT). For each cluster, we

116

created a pseudo bulk ATAC-seq library by combining reads from single cells in the cluster. We then performed

117

footprinting analysis for each cluster and estimated TF activity scores for all footprint supported motifs. We only kept

118

TFs with changes (high variance) in TF activity scores among clusters. We focussed here on clusters associated

119

to proximal tubular (PT), fibroblast/myofibroblasts and immune cells, as these represent key players in kidney

120

remodelling and fibrosis after injury. As shown in Fig. 3d, the TF activity scores capture regulatory programs

121

associated to these 3 major cell populations. Interestingly, injured PTs have overall lower TF activity scores of all TFs

122

of the PT cluster. TFs with high decrease in activity in injured PTs include Rxra, which is important for the regulation

123

of calcium homeostasis in tubular cells34 , and Hnf4a, which is important in proximal tubular development35 (Fig. 3e;

124

Supplementary Fig. 13). Footprint profiles of Rxra and Hnf4a in injured PTs display a gradual loss of TF activity

125

over time indicating that injured PT acquire a dedifferentiated phenotype during fibrosis progression and tubule

126

dilatation (Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 14).

127

Interestingly, a group of TFs with high activity scores in injured PTs also have high TF activity scores in

128

myofibroblasts (Smad2:Smad3 and Batf:Jun) or macrophages (Creb1) and lymphoid cells (Nfkb1) indicating shared

129

regulatory programs in these cells. Smad proteins are downstream signals of TGFβ signalling, which is a known key

130

player of fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis 36 . Interestingly, high activity of Smad2::Smad3 also

131

indicate a role of TGFβ in the expansion of injured PTs. High activity scores of Jun and Creb1 also support activation

132

of TNF-alpha pathway, which is responsible for tubular apoptosis and necroptosis37 . Nfkb1 is downstream of both

133

TGFβ and TNFα signalling and promotes macrophage infiltration to further induce myofibroblasts38 . Interestingly,

134

Smad2:Smad3, Jun and Creb1 reach a peak in TF activity level in day 2 after UUO in injured PTs (Fig. 3f;

135

Supplementary Fig. 14), which indicate these TFs are activated post-transcriptionally. Nfkb1, on the other hand,

Discussion

140

The enzyme used in ATAC-seq (Tn5) will generate a maximum of 2 fragments per cell in a small (∼200bp) open

141

chromatin region. Subsequent steps of the ATAC-seq protocol cause loss of a large proportion of these fragments.

142

For example, only DNA fragments with the two distinct Tn5 adapters, which are only present in 50% of the fragments,

143

are amplified in the PCR step39 . Further DNA material losses are expected during single cell isolation, liquid

144

handling, sequencing or by simple financial restrictions of sequencing. Assuming that 25% of accessible DNA can

145

be successfully sequenced, we expect that 56%1 of accessible chromatin sites will not have a single digestion event

146

causing the so-called dropout events. Despite this major signal loss, dropout events has been widely ignored in the

147

scATAC-seq literature5–8, 10, 11 .

148

scOpen is the first method for estimating the probability of open chromatin for single cell ATAC-seq data. We

149

demonstrate here that clustering based on scOpen estimated matrices have a higher recovery of the correct cell

150

labels, when compared to imputation methods for scRNA-seq12, 17–19 and the only imputation method tailored

151

for scATAC-seq (cisTopic-impute9 ). Moreover, we have demonstrated that the use of scOpen corrected matrices

152

as input improves the accuracy of existing state-of-art scATAC-seq methods (cisTopic9 , chromVAR10 , Cicero11 ).

153

These results support the importance of dropout event correction with scOpen in any computational analysis of

154

scATAC-seq. Of note, a sparsity similar to scATAC-seq are also expected in single cell protocols based on DNA

155

encroachments as scChIP-seq40 , scCUT&Tag41 , scBisulfite-seq42 just to cite a few. Modelling of dropout events in

156

these protocols represents a future challenge.

157

The detection of transcription factors that impact on regulating cell differentiation and functions is another popular

158

analysis of scATAC as performed by chromVAR10 . For this, chromVAR considers the accessibility, i.e. number of

159

ATAC-seq reads around motif predicted binding sites, inside ATAC-seq peaks. We have recently demonstrated the

160

feasibility of footprinting analysis in bulk ATAC-seq data4 and its advantages compared to approaches considering

161

all motifs inside ATAC-seq peaks, as chromVAR. We present here a footprinting based approach for inferring TF

162

factors controlling groups of single cells (scHINT). In contrast to chromVAR, scHINT consider both accessibility

163

and footprint profiles for measuring TF activity. We demonstrate that footprints helps the characterisation of two

164

sub-groups of megakaryocyte-erytrocyte progenitors by detecting TFs not identified by chromVAR. Moreover, we

165

characterised complex cascades of regulatory changes associated to kidney fibrosis from the analysis of a whole

166

kidney scATAC-seq data set. Our analysis demonstrates that major expanding population of cells, i.e. injured PTs,

167

myofibroblasts and immune cells, share regulatory programs, which are associated with de-/differentiation and

168

proliferation of particular cell types. Altogether, we demonstrate how scOpen and scHINT can be used to dissect

169

complex regulatory process driving a complex disease such as fibrosis in a highly heterogeneous organ.

assume digestion events follow a binomial distribution.

Methods

171

scOpen

172

scOpen uses positive-unlabelled (PU) learning of binary matrices to estimates the probability that a region is open

173

at a particular cell15 . Let X ∈ Rm×n be the scATAC-seq matrix, where Xi j is the number of read start sites in peak i

174

and cell j; m is the total number of peaks and n is the number of cells. We simplify the problem by defining a binary

175

open/closed chromatin matrix X̂ ∈ {0, 1}m×n , i.e.

X̂i j =



1 Xi j > 0

(1)


0 X = 0
ij
176

where 1 indicates an open chromatin region and 0 indicates a closed chromatin region or a dropout (non-observed)

177

event.
The major task in PU learning is to complete the matrix X̂ with additional positives (open regions) by detecting
dropout events from the negative (or unlabelled) entries. For this, we estimate a matrix M ∈ [0, 1]m×n given the
observation X̂, where M parametrises a probability distribution that generates an unknown open/closed chromatin
matrix Y such that

P(Yi j = 1) = Mi j

(2)

P(Yi j = 0) = 1 − Mi j

(3)

178

where 0 ≤ Mi j ≤ 1 represents the probability of the ith peak being open in cell j. For a given dropout rate (ρ), the

179

process of observing X̂ can be specified as:

P(X̂i j = 1) = (1 − ρ)Mi j

(4)

P(X̂i j = 0) = 1 − (1 − ρ)Mi j

(5)

180

The number of reads per cell varies largely in scATAC-seq suggesting that the above dropout sampling process is

181

unlikely uniform. Therefore we introduce a cell specific dropout rate:

ρ j = ρmax ·

log(smax ) − log(s j )
log(smax ) − log(smin )

(6)

182

where s j is the number of observed open chromatins for cell j, smax (smin ) is the maximum (minimum) number of

183

open chromatin events in a cell from X̂. ρmax is a pre-defined upper bound of dropout rate, which we set as 0.5 in

184

scOpen. This parameter assumes a non-linear association between the number of open regions in a cell and the

185

186

187

drop-out probability.
The PU learning problem is based on estimating the matrix M by minimisation of the following optimisation
problem:

M̂ = argmin ∑(Mi j −
i, j

1
X̂i j )2 + λ ||M||∗ ,
1−ρj

s.t. 0 ≤ Mi j ≤ 1

(7)

188

where ||M||∗ = ∑ki σi (M) is the nuclear norm of matrix M, and σi denotes the ith largest singular value of M. The first

189

item is the unbiased estimator of square loss for each element in M 15 and λ is the regularisation parameter, which

190

aims to prevent the model from over-fitting and set to 1 as default value. We assume that M is a low-rank matrix

191

with rank k and the above problem can be written as:

min f (W, H) = ∑((W H)i j −
W,H

ij

λ
λ
X̂i j )2 + ||W ||2 + ||H||2 ,
1−ρj

2

s.t. 0 ≤ (W H)i j ≤ 1

(8)

192

where W ∈ Rm×k , H ∈ Rk×n . This constrained optimisation problem is solved by using cyclic coordinate decent

193

methods. This method iteratively updates the variable wit in W to z by solving the following one-variable sub-problem.

194

Likewise, the elements in H can be updated with similar update rule. The above iteration is carried out until a

195

termination criterion is met, e.g. number of iteration performed.

196

The above constraints imposed long computational time requirements for large scATAC-seq matrices, due to the

197

need to check consistence of all constraints at each optimisation step. We therefore relax 0 ≤ (W H)i j ≤ 1 to 0 ≤ z.

198

Afterwards, we calculate M as the product of W and H by ceiling values to 1. This algorithm has a theoretical time

199

complexity of the algorithm is O((m + n)k) for a single iteration.

200

In our experiments, the ceiling operation was only performed to 0.2% of non-zero entries. Moreover, our

201

constraint relaxation lowered the computational time, i.e. 70 folds in the hematopoiesis data set (5 minutes vs 350

202

minutes), by reducing the number of optimization interations.

203

scATAC-seq benchmarking datasets

204

The cell line dataset was obtained by combining single cell ATAC-seq data of BJ, H1-ESC, K562, GM12878, TF1

205

and HL-60 from 5 , which was downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE65360.

206

The hematopoiesis dataset includes scATAC-seq experiments of sorted progenitor cells populations: hematopoietic

207

stem cells (HSC), multipotent progenitors (MPP), lymphoid-primed multi-potential progenitors (LMPP), common

208

myeloid progenitors (CMP), common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP),

209

megakaryocyte–erythroid progenitors (MEP) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)6 . Sequencing libraries were

210

obtained from GEO with accession number GSE96769. In both datasets, the original cell types were used as true

211

labels for clustering as in previous work8, 9 . Finally, the T cell dataset is based on human Jurkat T cells, memory

212

T cells, naive T cells and Th17 T cells obtained from GSE1078167 . Labels of memory, naive and Th17 T cells

213

were provided in Satpathy et al.7 by comparing scATAC-seq profiles with bulk ATAC-seq of corresponding T cell

214

subpopulations.

215

For each dataset, we processed the data similarly as in10 . First, the adapter sequences and low-quality ends

216

were trimmed from FastQ files using Trim Galore43 . Reads were mapped to the genome hg19 using Bowtie244

217

with the following parameters (−X 2000 −−very−sensitive −−no−discordant), allowing paired end reads of up

218

to 2 kb to align. Next, reads mapped to chrY, mitochondria and unassembled "random" contigs were removed.

219

Duplicates were also removed with Picard45 and reads were further filtered for alignment quality of >Q30 and

220

required to be properly paired using samtools46 . All reads were adjusted by offsetting +4 bp for forward strand and

221

−5bp for reverse strand to represent the cleavage event centre1, 4 . We only kept reads from cells with at least 500

222

unique fragments. We then created a pseudo-bulk ATAC-seq library by merging the filtered scATAC-seq profiles

223

and called peaks using MACS216 with the following parameters (−−keep−dup auto −−call−summits). The peaks

224

were extended ±250bp from the summits as in1 and peaks overlapping with ENCODE blacklists (http://mitra.

225

stanford.edu/kundaje/akundaje/release/blacklists/hg19-human/) were removed. Finally, a read

226

count matrix was constructed with custom python script by counting the number of read start sites per cell in each

227

peak, of which each row represents one peak and each column represents one cell. See Supplementary Table 1 for

228

complete statistics associated to these data sets.

229

Benchmarking of imputation methods

230

We compared the performance of scOpen with 5 distinct imputation approaches (MAGIC, SAVER, scImpute,

231

DCA and cisTopic) in terms of clustering accuracy. In short, we performed imputation with these algorithms (see

232

details below) on the benchmarking datasets, applied PCA (50 PCs) and clustered cell using k-medoids and

233

Person correlation as in9 , where k was set to the number of true cell types in each dataset. For visualisation

234

purposes, we used t-SNE21 . We used adjusted Rand index (ARI) to evaluate the clustering results20 with labels from

235

benchmarking data sets. The adjusted Rand index measures similarity between two data clusterings by correcting

236

the chance of grouping elements. Specifically, given two partitions of a dataset D with n cells, U = {U1 ,U2 , · · ·Ur }

237

and V = {V1 ,V2 , · · · ,Vs }, the number of common cells for each cluster i and j can be written as:

ci j = |Ui ∩V j |

where i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , r} and j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , s}. The ARI can be calculated as follows:

(11)

239

where ai = ∑sj=1 ci j and b j = ∑ri ci j , respectively. The ARI has a maximum value 1 and an expected value 0, with

240

1 indicating that the data clusterings are the exactly same and 0 indicating that the two data clusterings agree

241

randomly.

242

MAGIC

243

MAGIC is an algorithm for alleviating sparsity and noise of single cell data using diffusion geometry12 . We

244

downloaded MAGIC from https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/MAGIC and applied it on the count matrix

245

with default setting. Prior to MAGIC, the input was normalised by library size and root squared, as suggested by the

246

authors12 .

247

SAVER

248

SAVER is a method that recovers the true expression level of each gene in each cell by borrowing information

249

across genes and cells17 . We obtained SAVER from https://github.com/mohuangx/SAVER and ran it on the

250

normalised tag count matrix with the default parameters.

251

scImpute

252

scImpute is a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropouts in scRNA-seq data18 . We downloaded

253

scImpute from https://github.com/Vivianstats/scImpute and executed it using the default setting except

254

for the number of cell clusters which is used to determine the candidate neighbours of each cell by scImpute. We

255

defined this as the true cluster number for each benchmarking dataset.

256

DCA

257

DCA is a deep auto-encoder network for denoising scRNA-seq data by taking the count structure, over-dispersed

258

nature and sparsity of the data into account19 . We obtained DCA from https://github.com/theislab/dca

259

and ran it with default setting.

260

cisTopic-impute

261

cisTopic is a probabilistic model to simultaneously identify cell states (topic-cell distribution) and cis-regulatory

262

topics (region-topic distribution) from single cell epigenomics data9 . We downloaded it from https://github.

263

com/aertslab/cisTopic and ran it with different numbers of topics (from 5 to 50). The optimal number of

264

topics was selected based on the highest log-likelihood as suggested in9 . We then multiplied the topic-cell and the

265

region-topic distributions to obtain the predictive distribution9 , which describes the probability of each region in each

266

cell and is used as imputed matrix for clustering and visualisation. We call this method as cisTopic-impute.

267

Benchmarking of scATAC-seq methods

268

Next, we compared the performance of state-of-art scATAC-seq methods (scABC, chromVAR and Cicero) when

269

presented with scOpen estimated or raw scATAC-seq matrices. All methods were evaluated regarding clustering

270

accuracy (as in “Evaluation of imputation methods”). Note that scABC is the only method providing a clustering

271

solution. chromVAR, Cicero and cisTopic transform the scATAC-seq matrices into transcription factor, gene and

272

topic feature spaces. These transformed matrices were used as input for PCA (50 PCs), k-medoids clustering, and

273

t-SNE transformation as before9 .

274

scABC

275

scABC is an unsupervised clustering algorithm for single cell epigenetic data8 . We downloaded it from https://

276

github.com/SUwonglab/scABC and executed according to the tutorial https://github.com/SUwonglab/

277

scABC/blob/master/vignettes/ClusteringWithCountsMatrix.html.

278

chromVAR

279

chromVAR is an R package for analysing sparse chromatin-accessibility data by measuring the gain or loss of

280

chromatin accessibility within sets of genomic features, as regions with sequence predicted transcription factor (TF)

281

binding sites10 . We obtained chromVAR from https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVAR and executed

282

to find gain/loss of chromatin accessibility in regions with binding sites of 571 TF motifs obtained in JASPAR version

283

201847 .

284

Cicero

285

Cicero is a method that predicts co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility

286

data11 . Moreover, Cicero provides a gene activity score for each cell and gene by assessing the overall accessibility

287

of a promoter and its associated distal sites. This matrix was used for clustering and visualisation of scATAC-

288

seq. We obtained Cicero from https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/cicero-release and executed

289

it according to the document provided by https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/

290

docs/.

291

cisTopic

292

We executed cisTopic as described above. Instead of using the multiplication of topic-cell and region-topic

293

distributions as imputed matrix, we here directly used the topic-cell distribution (after choosing the number of topics

294

with the log-likelihood method) for cell clustering via k-medoids as in9 .

295

Chromosomal conformation experiments with Cicero

296

We used conformation data to evaluate co-accessible pairs of cis-regulatory DNA as detected by Cicero on GM12878

297

cells. For this, we replicated the analysis performed in Fig. 4 of11 and contrasted the results of Cicero with raw or

298

scOpen estimated matrices. We obtained scATAC-seq matrix of GM12878 cells from GEO (GSM2970932). For

299

evaluation, We downloaded promoter-capture (PC) Hi-C data of GM12878 from GEO (GSE81503) and used the

300

provided CHiCAGO48 score as physical proximity indicator. We also downloaded ChIA-PET data of GM12878 from

301

GEO (GSM1872887) and used the frequency of each interaction PET cluster to represent how strong an interaction

302

is. We only considered open chromatin regions overlapping with regions present at either ChIA-PET or Hi-C data as

303

in11 . ChIA-PET and Hi-C are used as true interactions. We compared the interactions predicted by Cicero to Hi-C

304

interactions and ChIA-PET ligations using the built-in function compare_connections of Cicero. We defined the

305

argument maxgap as 1000bp to allow slop in the comparisons.

306

Clustering and transcription factor activity analysis on hematopoiesis data

307

We applied gap statistic22 to determine the optimal number of clusters in hematopoiesis dataset for k-medoids

308

clustering method . The gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with

309

their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The optimal k will be value that yields the largest

310

gap statistic, which is k = 10. Next, for each obtained cluster, we merged scATAC-seq profiles using samtools46

311

to create a cluster-specific ATAC-seq library and detected peaks with MACS216 . Based on these peaks, we used

312

HINT-ATAC4 to predict footprints and identified all binding sites of a particular TF overlapping with footprints by using

313

its motif from JASPAR version 201847 . We then calculated activity score for the TF in each cluster as previously

314

described4 . As chromVAR generates a TF activity score for each single cell, we summed up the scores of a TF for

315

each cluster to allow for a comparison between chromVAR and HINT-ATAC. For visualisation, we used deeptools49

316

to generate a coverage track for MEP1, MEP2 and other clusters after normalisation by counts per million mapped

317

reads (CPM) as shown in Fig. 2d.

318

scATAC-seq UUO mouse kidney datasets

319

Animal experiments

320

Unilateral Ureter Obstruction (UUO) was performed as previously described27 . Briefly, after flank incision, the left

321

ureter was tied off at the level of the lower pole with two 7.0 ties (Ethicon). One C57BL/6 male mouse was sacrificed

322

on day 0 (sham), day 2 and 10 after the surgery. Kidneys were snap-frozen immediately after sacrifice. Animal

323

experiment protocols were approved by the LANUV-NRW, Germany. All animal experiments were carried out in

324

accordance with their guidelines.

325

scATAC experiments

326

Nuclei isolation was performed as recommended by 10X Genomics (demonstrated protocol CG000169). The nuclei

327

concentration was verified using stained nuclei in a Neubauer chamber with trypan-blue targeting a concentration of

328

NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 Kit (Illumina). This results in more than 600 million reads.

331

UUO data processing

332

We used Cell-Ranger ATAC (version-1.1.0) pipeline to perform low level data processing (https://support.

333

10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview). We first

334

demultiplexed raw base call files using cellranger-atac mkfastq with its default setting to generate FASTQ files for

335

each flowcell. Next, cellranger-atac count was applied to perform read trimming and filtering, alignment, peak calling

336

and barcode counting for each sample independently. Next, we used cellranger-atac aggr to combine reads from all

337

experiments, which includes a new peak calling round. The normalisation model was set as "None" to obtain a

338

matrix of raw counts. We performed cell detection by using the fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) and number of

339

unique fragments to filter low quality cells. Briefly, we only kept the cells that had at least 55% of fragments in peaks

340

and 1,000 unique fragments for downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9).

341

Next, we used the R package Seurat (version 3.1.0) to integrate the scATAC-seq profiles from different condi-

342

tions (day 0, day 2 and day 10) using default parameters. For this, we first selected a subset of peaks that exhibit

343

high variability across cells for each dataset (top 2000 peaks), which were used as anchors for cell integration 28 .

344

Finally, an integrated matrix was obtained by subtracting the transformation matrix from the original matrix. The

345

previous step was performed on both scOpen estimated and raw scATAC-seq matrices. Finally, we performed

346

PCA analysis (30 PCs) and used k-medoids for clustering of scOpen and raw integrated scATAC-seq matrices. For

347

benchmarking purposes the same analysis was also performed for each day separately.

348

Label transfer and cluster annotation

349

We annotated the cells/clusters by using the label transfer approach in Seurat328 . To do this, we first downloaded a

350

publicly available single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) dataset of the same fibrosis model (GSE119531). This

351

dataset contains 6147 single-nucleus transcriptomes with 17 unique cell types29 . For the label transfer, we created

352

a gene activity matrix for the integrated scATAC-seq data by accessing the chromatin accessibility associated with

353

each gene in each cell using the R package Signac (version 0.1.4; https://github.com/timoast/signac).

354

Briefly, we extracted gene coordinates for mouse genome from EnsembleDB with EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79 and

355

extended them to include the 2kb upstream region. We then counted the number of fragments that map to each of

356

these regions for each cell using the function FeatureMatrix. Next, we transferred the cell types from snRNA-seq

357

dataset to the integrated scATAC-seq dataset by using the function FindTransferAnchors and TransferData in

358

Seurat328 . These labels were used as true labels on the evaluation of clustering results using the ARI as before.

359

For biological interpretation, we have named the cluster by assigning the label with highest proportion of cells to

360

the cluster (see Supplementary File 1). Most clusters were assigned to a single cell type with the exception of

361

clusters 4 and 5, which both had a similar proportion of proximal tubular (PT) S1 and S2 cells. Also, the clustering

362

divided fibroblast population in two clusters (9 and 13). We have characterised cluster 13 as myofibroblasts given

363

the increase of accessibility of markers Fbln2 and Dcn in contrast to cluster 9 (fibroblast) (Supplementary Fig. 11).

364

We also renamed the cells, which were label as Mac2 in Wu et al. 201929 , as lymphoid cells given that these cells

365

express B and T cell markers Ltb and Cd1d, but not macrophage markers C1qa and C1qb (Supplementary Fig. 11).

366

Finally, cluster 16 (labelled as proliferative PTs) was removed due to the high number of reads of valid reads in cells

367

(58,000 in proliferative PTs vs 15,000 in other cells), which indicates that it is formed by mutiplets (Supplementary

368

File 1).

369

Transcription factor analysis with scHINT

370

Next, we performed a differential TF activity analysis using transcription factor footprints predicted by HINT-ATAC.

371

In short, we create pseudo bulk atac-seq libraries by combining reads of cells for each cluster and performed

372

footprinting with HINT-ATAC. Next, we predicted TF binding sites by motif analysis (FDR = 0.0001) inside footprint

373

sequences using RGT (Version RGT-0.12.3; https://github.com/CostaLab/reg-gen). Motifs were obtained

374

from JASPAR Version 202050 . We measured the average digestion profiles around all binding sites of a given

375

TF for each pseudo bulk ATAC-seq library. We used then the protection score4 , which measures the cell specific

376

activity of a factor by considering number of digestion events around the binding sites and depth of the footprint.

377

Higher protection scores indicate higher activity (binding) of that factor. Finally, we only considered TFs with more

378

than 1.000 binding sites, with a variance in activity score higher than 0.3. See Supplementary File 1 for complete

379

activity scores results. We also have devised a smoothing approach for visualisation of average footprint profiles.

380

In short, we performed a trimmed mean smoothing (5 bps window) and ignored cleavage values in the top 97.5%

381

quantile for each average profile. We denote this novel approach to measure footprint based TF activity scores from

382

scATAC-seq clusters scHINT.
