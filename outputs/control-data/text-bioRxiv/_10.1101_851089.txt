Abstract: The population sex ratio is thought to be maintained through balancing selection on rare
phenotypes. However, empirical evidence for genetic influence has thus far proven elusive. We combined
1000 Genomes data and large cohorts to study human sex ratios. We found underrepresentation of male
offspring in preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy disorder with uncertain pathogenesis. Genetic variation of
fetal human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), regulating maternal anti-fetal immune responses, was found to

15

be under balancing selection. Sex-linked downregulation of HLA-G and upregulation of interferon alpha-1
(IFNA1) expression contribute to loss of fetal immunotolerance in preeclampsia and suggest
hydroxychloroquine as a treatment option. Our findings indicate that an evolutionary trade-off between fetal
immunotolerance and protection against infections promotes genetic diversity in HLA-G, thereby
maintaining human sex ratios.

Main Text: Whether human male-to-female sex ratios exhibit appreciable variation has been a subject of
debate in the biological sciences. Recent large-scale data have confirmed an unbiased sex ratio at conception:
equal numbers of X-bearing or Y-bearing sperm fertilize human eggs. However, the global birth sex ratio of
106 males for every 100 females, already seen in 20-week fetuses, indicates that more females are lost in
5

early human pregnancies. In contrast, male fetuses might be at higher risk for late miscarriages and stillbirths
(1). Together, these findings suggest that undetermined fetal sex-specific mechanisms contribute to human
pregnancy success and phenotypic variation in the sex ratio arises during pregnancy. Negative frequencydependent selection has been proposed to keep sex ratios balanced (2), however to our knowledge, there is a
lack of empirical evidence across all species for a genetic link to sex ratio.

10

In humans, balancing selection at the human major histocompatibility (MHC) locus has been proposed to
modulate a deficiency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) homozygotes through maternal-fetal interaction
(3), without regard for sex-specificity. Increased HLA similarity in couples is associated with recurrent
miscarriages, further supporting the need for the fetus to differ from maternal HLA (4). Although the exact
modifier locus remains unclear, only a limited pattern of HLA antigens (HLA-C, HLA-G, HLA-E, HLA-F)

15

are expressed by fetal trophoblasts to prevent rejection by maternal immune cells (5). Of these, HLA-G is
the most studied due to its trophoblast-restricted expression and multiple isoforms inducing both local and
systemic immunotolerance (6).
Tens of studies, with still inconclusive results, have searched for the link between HLA-G, miscarriages, and
the hypertensive pregnancy disorder preeclampsia (7). While reduced HLA-G expression observed in the

20

preeclamptic placenta is expected to facilitate maternal immune reactions to fetal alloantigens, its role in the
pathogenesis is not yet clear (8). Maternal immune maladaptation in preeclampsia, as one of the major
theories, is supported by the shift from antibody-mediated T-helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory T cells (Treg) to
cell-mediated T-helper 1 (Th1) responses, and by aberrant natural killer (NK) cell activity (9, 10). This study

was motivated by the proposed but still disputed sex bias in preeclamptic births (11), and particularly, the
low male/female ratio in children of both women and men descending from a proband with preeclampsia
(12). We hypothesized that male fetal loss reflects failure in fetal HLA-G mediated immunotolerance in
preeclampsia, stronger maternal immune responses towards male fetuses, and demonstrates the particular
5

role of HLA-G in maternal-fetal interaction that affects fetal survival in human pregnancy.
We examined birth sex ratios (male/female) in a Finnish population cohort of 1.79 million live and stillbirths.
This cohort included 38,752 preeclamptic births (2.2%). The sex ratio was 1.02 in preeclamptic and 1.05 in
non-preeclamptic births (P=0.006), and the earlier the gestational age at birth, the lower the number of male
offspring in preeclampsia (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.80; P=0.007) (Fig. 1A). The sex bias was in

10

striking agreement with Norwegian data on 1.82 million births and 44,000 preeclamptic pregnancies (13),
and with others (14). Together with the data on unbiased human sex ratio at conception (1) and familial
association of preeclampsia and miscarriages (15), our results suggested male fetuses being lost before the
onset of early preeclampsia, or linked to a higher risk of term disease, or both.

We studied the possible association between male fetal loss and preeclampsia. Using population-level data
on women with one or more miscarriages, we demonstrated the reduced sex ratio of 0.98 in consecutive
preeclamptic (n=6,469) compared with 1.04 in non-preeclamptic births (n=355,683; P=0.03). In the
FINNPEC preeclampsia cohort (n=1,538), the higher number of previous pregnancies was associated with
5

reduced number of male offspring in preeclamptic women, especially in pregnancies with small for
gestational age (SGA) offspring (Fig. 1B). We also studied a Swedish stillbirth cohort (n=277), which
showed increased intrauterine loss of male fetuses with the sex ratio of 1.18. Furthermore, pregnancy
complications were overrepresented in male offspring in the Finnish preeclampsia family series (16).
Altogether, our results suggest that maternal immune reactions to fetal alloantigens, and stronger responses

10

to the male-specific Y chromosomal histocompatibility (H-Y) antigen (17), contribute to fetal survival and
preeclampsia pathogenesis.
HLA-G downregulation is linked to its 3’ untranslated regulatory region (3’UTR; Fig. S1) which is associated
with distinct full-length haplotypes, and modulates mRNA stability and decay, microRNA targeting, and
splicing (6, 18). To uncover the link between HLA-G and the sex ratio, we studied HLA-G 3’UTR haplotype

15

pairs, diplotypes, representing functional units. In the 1000 Genomes series (n=2504) (19), sex ratios were
modulated by the HLA-G 3’UTR diplotypes (Generalized linear model, GLM: F21,24=2.27, P=0.03; Fig. S2).
Rare diplotypes showed opposite patterns of sex ratios in preeclampsia offspring (Fig. 2A) and stillborn
fetuses (Fig. 2B). The distribution of HLA-G 3’UTR diplotypes and the sex ratio differed between offspring
from preeclamptic (Fig. 2A) and control pregnancies (Fig. 2C) in the FINNPEC series (GLM: F13,21=9.15,

20

P<0.001). We found a similar tendency in Africans versus Non-Africans in the 1000 Genomes data (GLM:
F1,24=8.47, P=0.008; Fig. S2), the Africans having the highest global prevalence of preeclampsia (20).
Altogether, rare diplotypes showed more variation in the sex ratio than the common ones, which were close
to the balance of 1.0. These results support a pattern of negative frequency-dependent selection, a form of

balancing selection in which rare alleles are favored and the fitness of each allele decreases as its frequency
increases (21-23).
We further tested segregation of individuals homozygous for HLA-G 3’UTR (Fig. 2D). Decreased HLA-G
homozygosity was observed in Africans (18.3% homozygous) versus Non-Africans (24.4%), and in the
5

Swedish stillbirth cohort (18.4%) versus populations controls (25.7%), without sex-specific differences.
Preeclamptic (26.8%) versus control offspring (26.3%) showed no differences in the overall homozygosity.
However, homozygous males (31.7%; 35.2% in first pregnancies) versus females (22.3%; 21.4% in first
pregnancies) were overrepresented in preeclamptic births in the FINNPEC cohort. The same association
between homozygous male offspring and preeclampsia was observed in the preeclampsia family series (16).

10

Collectively, these results provide further support for balancing selection. While heterozygote advantage
looks apparent for Africans, heterozygosity also shows an association with stillbirth in the Swedish cohort.
In contrast, selection against HLA-G 3’UTR homozygous male offspring in preeclampsia supports the need
for the fetus to differ from maternal HLA (3), refines the locus for the findings of HLA similarity in couples
with recurrent miscarriages (4), and sheds light on the first-pregnancy predominance of preeclampsia (24).

To support balancing selection on the HLA-G locus, we observed different frequencies of HLA-G 3’UTR
diplotypes in offspring from preeclamptic and control pregnancies in the FINNPEC cohort: UTR-2
associated diplotypes dominated in preeclampsia (Fig. S3). The two major haplotypes, UTR-1 and UTR-2,
differ for five polymorphic sites, mostly associate with the same HLA-G protein, and have global frequencies
5

of 20-30% each (18, 25). Of them, the evolutionarily most recent UTR-1 showed reduced frequency (P=0.01;
OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94) and the ancestral haplotype UTR-2 increased frequency (P=0.01; OR 1.34,
95% CI: 1.07-1.69) in preeclamptic versus control offspring of first-time mothers. For UTR-2, the association
remained when offspring from later pregnancies were included (P=0.04; OR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47) (Table
S1). The observed opposite effects of UTR-1 and UTR-2 on preeclampsia risk in first pregnancies support

10

the advantage of divergent alleles and heterozygosity. Moreover, previous studies link UTR-2 to low
expression, immune-mediated disorders, and pregnancy complications, and UTR-1 to high HLA-G
expression (6, 7). In line with this, the stillbirth cohort showed a similar but more significant protective effect
of UTR-1 (P=0.0001; OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.81). Conversely, UTR-5 was detected as a risk haplotype for
stillbirth (P=0.03; OR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.06-2.79) (Table S2). UTR-5 is considered the oldest of all haplotypes

15

and is closest to orthologous sequences in non-human primates (25). We further confirmed that the 14 bp
insertion polymorphism, previously implicated in pregnancy complications and present in haplotypes UTR2, -5 and -7 (7, 18), showed a modest association with both stillbirths (P=0.04; OR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01-1.52)
and preeclampsia (P=0.03; OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.44).
To test the hypothesis of maternal immunoreactivity as the mechanism of fetal selection, we studied placental

20

RNA expression of 136 genes (Fig. 3, Table S3, and Table S4), confirmed sex-linked HLA-G downregulation
in preeclampsia (Fig. S4, Fig. S5, and S6), and found support for balancing selection (Fig. S7) (16). No other
immune-related genes showed compensatory effects. The marked upregulation of interferon alpha-1
(IFNA1) in preeclampsia suggests that interferon signaling drives loss of fetal immunotolerance and might

We provide the first evidence of a gene modulating human sex ratio and support HLA-G as a sexually
antagonistic locus determining maternal-fetal interaction and pregnancy success. Furthermore, we provide
empirical evidence that balancing selection is acting on contemporary human populations and complicates
human pregnancies. Balancing selection of HLA-G haplotypes clarifies the evolutionary paradox of
5

preeclampsia and its highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa (26). How can a genetic trait potentially fatal
for both the fetus and the mother show heritability estimates of 50% (27) and persist across human
populations? We propose that low HLA-G expression, observed also in trophoblasts infected by Plasmodium
falciparum (28) and some viruses (CMV, HSV) (29), is advantageous in pathogen-rich environments to
mount protective maternal immune responses, while concurrently detrimental, causing unfavorable maternal

10

anti-fetal immune reactions, fetal loss, and preeclampsia (16). In agreement with this scenario, ancestral fetal
HLA-G haplotypes showed associations with preeclampsia and stillbirths in our series, thereby supporting
their disadvantage in modern environments. Furthermore, high HLA-G expression is, however, associated
with higher implantation rates (30) and uneventful pregnancies as presented here, but might confer an
increased risk of offspring to malaria and other parasitic infections (31, 32). These mechanisms might be in

15

part mediated by the fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) gene, as our results link balancing selection of HLAG regulatory haplotypes also to asymmetry for placental FLT1 expression. Notably, high fetal FLT1 levels
confer resistance against placental malaria and fetal loss (33), and maternal hypertension and elevated sFLT1
levels are not specific to preeclampsia but arise in first-time mothers with placental malaria (34, 35). To
support their shared pathogenesis, placental malaria and preeclampsia show high rates and seasonal co-

20

occurrence in Africa (36), where both the HLA-G low-expressing “null allele” and high-expressing FLT1
alleles are under positive selection (33, 37), and the frequency and sex ratios associated with HLA-G 3’UTR
haplotypes differ from other populations as shown here.

The majority of humans are HLA heterozygous for the need to provide more productive immune responses
to pathogens (3, 21). While HLA-G shows physiological expression almost uniquely in trophoblasts, its high
expression that benefits the viability of fetuses during pregnancy may trade-off with HLA-G neoexpression,
promoting immune evasion of viruses and malaria as well as tumors later in life (6, 38). Therefore, the benefit
5

of differential HLA-G expression may be dependent on the time and place, pathogens, and the tissue of
expression, providing a role for balancing selection on immune-related traits beyond pregnancy in human
evolution.
