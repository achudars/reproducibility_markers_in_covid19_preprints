ABSTRACT
Retrieval of synaptic vesicles via endocytosis is essential for maintaining sustained synaptic
transmission, especially for neurons that fire action potentials at high frequencies. However,
how activity regulates synaptic vesicles recycling is largely unknown. Here we report that

+

Na

substantially accumulated in the mouse calyx of Held terminals during repetitive high-

+

frequency spiking. Elevated presynaptic Na

accelerated both slow and rapid forms of

endocytosis and facilitated endocytosis overshoot but did not affect the readily releasable

2+

pool size, Ca

influx, or exocytosis. To examine whether this facilitation of endocytosis is

+

related to the Na -dependent vesicular content change, we dialyzed increasing
concentrations of glutamate into the presynaptic cytosol or blocked the vesicular glutamate
uptake with bafilomycin and found the rate of endocytosis was not affected by regulating
the glutamate content in the presynaptic terminal. Endocytosis is critically dependent on

2+,

intracellular Ca

+

Na

+

2+ exchanger (NCX) may be altered when the

and the activity of Na /Ca

+

gradient is changed. However, neither NCX blocker nor change of extracellular Na

2+

concentration affected the endocytosis rate. Moreover, two-photon Ca
that

+
presynaptic Na

imaging showed

2+

did not affect the action potential-evoked intracellular Ca

and decay. Therefore, we revealed a novel

+
mechanism of cytosolic Na in

transient

accelerating

vesicle endocytosis. During high-frequency synaptic transmission, when large amounts of

+

synaptic vesicles are fused, Na

accumulated in terminals, facilitated vesicle recycling and

sustained reliable synaptic transmission.

INTRODUCTION
At chemical synapses, the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma
membrane releases vesicular neurotransmitter contents for exerting various functions.
Following exocytosis, membrane lipid bilayer and proteins are retrieved through
endocytosis to form new vesicles (Sudhof, 2004; Kononenko and Haucke, 2015; Soykan et
al., 2017). Different modes of endocytosis have been observed in central synapses,
including the classical clathrin-dependent endocytosis, kiss-and-run, and bulk exocytosis
(Hosoi et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009; Yamashita et al., 2010). Endocytosis in different
conditions differs substantially in speed and amount. Slow endocytosis is mediated by a
classical, clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis with a decay time constant (τ) of
~10-30 s, serving as the predominant mode for synaptic vesicle recycling during lowintensity activity (Granseth et al., 2006). The clathrin-independent, dynamin-dependent
rapid endocytosis, with a τ within a few seconds, has been assumed to reflect kiss-and-run
that involves rapid fusion pore opening and closure of the same vesicles after stronger
stimulation (Ales et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2005). Bulk endocytosis occurs when large
endosome-like structures are internalized from presynaptic plasma membrane during high
intensity firing activity (Holt et al., 2003; Wu and Wu, 2007). Moreover, during endocytosis
overshoot, endocytosis may retrieve more membrane than exocytosis, which may be

Accumulating evidence indicated that synaptic vesicles exocytosis and endocytosis are
tightly coupled both temporally and spatially, and their timely coupling is essential for
synaptic function and structural stability, but the underlying mechanism for this coupling is

under debate. Ca

triggered by Ca

represents one prevalent possibility. Vesicle exocytosis is directly

2+

while how Ca

regulates endocytosis is complex and varies greatly in

response to distinct neuronal activity (Leitz and Kavalali, 2016), making it complicated to
coordinate endocytosis speed in an activity-dependent manner. Here we showed that

+

action potential firing substantially elevated presynaptic cytosolic Na

in the mouse calyx of

Held, a giant glutamatergic terminal in the auditory brainstem that fires continuous action
potentials at high-frequency up to hundreds of Hertz, in a frequency-dependent manner.

Cytosolic Na

accelerated both slow and rapid forms of endocytosis and facilitated

+

2+

endocytosis overshoot. The Na

or intracellular Ca

effect on endocytosis was not through affecting Ca

transients, nor through regulating vesicular glutamate contents.

Therefore, when large amounts of synaptic vesicles are fused during high-frequency

+

synaptic transmission, Na

accumulated into presynaptic cytosol and facilitated vesicle

+

recycling. Since the cytosolic Na

concentration is correlated with spike intensity and

durations, it may work as a signal to coordinate vesicle endocytosis and recycling according
to the level of endocytosis.

Presynaptic Na

imaging with two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Calyces of Held were loaded via

whole-cell recordings with the Na

and the volume marker Alexa 594 (Fig.

Figure 1) (Rose, 2012; Huang and Trussell, 2014). The presynaptic [Na ] in the resting state
was 15.8 ± 2.1 mM (n = 4). APs were evoked by afferent fiber stimulation and propagated to

the presynaptic terminals. Upon 100 Hz stimulation for 1 s, presynaptic cytosolic [Na ]
increased by 5.7 ± 1.1 mM, which decayed to the control level with a time constant of 12.2 ±
1.0 s (n = 5; Fig. 1B). After ensuring reliable AP evoked by afferent fiber stimulation, the

recording pipettes were subsequently detached from the calyces, and the Na

signals upon

stimulations at different frequencies were measured. Spiking at 10 Hz for 60 s reversibly

increased the [Na ] by 12.2 ± 1.7 mM (n = 7; Fig. 1C). Increasing the spike frequency

gradually increased the Na

(n = 8; Fig. 1D) and 100 Hz for 20 s increased the [Na ] by 55.6 ± 5.9 mM (n = 8; Fig. 1E).

Therefore, spike activities efficiently increase the presynaptic cytosolic Na

Presynaptic cytosolic Na+ facilitates slow endocytosis
Capacitance measurements were made at the calyx of Held terminals to examine whether

facilitates both the slow and

Cytosolic Na+ facilitates endocytosis overshoot

the calyx terminal could retrieve more membrane area than vesicles fused.

This phenomenon is defined as endocytosis overshoot and has been implicated in
increasing endocytosis capacity and efficiency during high-frequency firing (Renden and

von Gersdorff, 2007; Wu et al., 2009; Xue et al., 2012). We then tested whether Na

2+

influences this mode of endocytosis. Extracellular solution containing 2 mM Ca

was used

in this experiment to increase the chance of endocytosis overshoot (Wu et al., 2009; Xue et
al., 2012). The size of endocytosis overshoot was quantified as the capacitance value below
the baseline at 40~60 s after depolarization pulses (Wu et al., 2009). We found that

increased Na

[Na ]

concentrations facilitated the observation of endocytosis overshoot. As the

increased from 0 to 10, and 40 mM, the percentage of cells with overshoot increased

from 28.6% (2 of 7 calyces) to 66.7% (6 of 9 calyces), and 100% (7 of 7 calyces). For the
cells that showed overshoot, the overshoot ratio increased from 5.5 ± 4.4% to 14.7 ± 3.0%,

+

and 22.8 ± 4.3% (Fig. 4; P = 0.0008, ANOVA analysis). These results indicate that [Na ] also
facilitates endocytosis overshoot in both the percentage of cells and the amount of
membrane area.

Vesicular content does not affect slow or rapid endocytosis
Previous study of hippocampal cultures showed that cytosolic transmitter concentration,
which rapidly controls the vesicular neurotransmitter contents (Hori and Takahashi, 2012;
Apostolides and Trussell, 2013), regulates vesicle cycling at hippocampal GABAergic

terminals (Wang et al., 2013). Since presynaptic Na

facilitates vesicular glutamate

transport and higher cytosolic [Na ] increases the vesicle glutamate contents (Huang and

+

Trussell, 2014), we performed two lines of experiment to test whether the effects of Na

on

endocytosis is through regulating vesicular contents (Fig.5). First, we performed
capacitance measurement under different concentrations of cytosolic glutamate (0, 5, or 50

(P = 0.74, ANOVA test, Fig. 5H) mode of endocytosis was influenced by the cytosolic
glutamate concentration. Second, we tested the effects of bafilomycin, a V-ATPase inhibitor
that impedes vesicle acidification and neurotransmitter upload on endocytosis triggered by
the same protocols (Fig. 5B,F). The results showed that 2 µM bafilomycin did not affect

concentration to mimic the Na

concentration gradient change in elevated intracellular Na

conditions. As shown in Fig. 6A, the endocytosis rate was not changed with lowering

extracellular Na

for 50 mM (P = 0.50, n = 6). We also tested whether inhibiting NCX activity

accelerates vesicle recycling and sustains synaptic transmission, representing a novel

cellular mechanism that supports reliable synaptic transmission at high-frequency in the
central nervous system.

Accumulating evidence indicated that synaptic vesicles exocytosis and endocytosis are
tightly coupled both temporally and spatially, and their coupling is essential for synaptic
function and structural stability. During prolonged high-frequency synaptic transmission
when large amounts of synaptic vesicles are fused with presynaptic membrane, endocytosis
needs to be accelerated in order to replenish the vesicle pool and maintain the strength of
synaptic transmission. Slow endocytosis and vesicle recycling leads to depletion of the
release-ready vesicles, which has been shown as one major contribution for short-term
depression (von Gersdorff and Borst, 2002; Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004; Regehr,
2012). Different mechanisms have been observed to couple endocytosis with exocytosis,

2+

including Ca

(Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001; Hosoi et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009),

membrane lipid such as PIP2 (Koch and Holt, 2012), and cytoskeleton proteins (Yuan et al.,

2+-dependent regulation of

2015; Orlando et al., 2019). Ca

exo-endocytosis coupling has

2+

been prevalently studied. Exocytosis is directly triggered by Ca

and Ca

regulation of endocytosis has been extensively studied (Wu et al., 2014). Ca

2+

indicating that Ca

triggers endocytosis (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001; Hosoi et al.,

2+

2009; Wu et al., 2009). However, increased Ca

influx during prolonged stimulation train

slowed down endocytosis in many preparations, including chromaffin cells, neuromuscular
junction, retinal ribbon terminals, and central synapses (von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994;
Wu and Betz, 1996; Sun et al., 2002; Elhamdani et al., 2006; Balaji et al., 2008; Sun et al.,

2+

2010). A recent study showed that the dynamics of Ca

concentration changes can

differentially modulate endocytosis. Specifically, transient, large calcium increases trigger

2+

endocytosis while prolonged, small, global Ca

increases inhibit slow endocytosis (Wu and

2+

Wu, 2014). Therefore, regulation of endocytosis by Ca

concentration is complex and

varies greatly in response to distinct neuronal activity, making it complicated to coordinate
endocytosis speed in an activity-dependent manner.

Neural activity is provided by ion fluxes through voltage and neurotransmitter-gated
channels, and spiking activity alters ion composition in the cytosol. Although intracellular

levels are dynamically

previously reported that Calyx terminals express Na -permeable HCN channels, and

activation of HCN channels contributes to the resting Na

concentration of 4.9 ± 0.5 mM

(Huang and Trussell, 2014). Here we found that spikes are much more potent in regulating

accumulation than HCN channels. Upon 1 s of 100 Hz firing, the

+

presynaptic [Na ] increased by 5.7 ± 1.1 mM (Figure 1B), which is larger than the overall

+

contribution of voltage-gated Na

channels and HCN channels at resting potential (Huang

+

and Trussell, 2014). Increasing the spike frequency increased the Na

transients

+

proportionately. Spikes at 10 Hz for 60 s increased the [Na ] by 12.2 ± 1.7 mM while 30 s of

+

spikes at 20 Hz increased the [Na ] by 16.3 ± 2.0 mM (Fig. 2). Since the total spike number

+

was the same in these two experiments, the difference in [Na ] increase likely reflects the

+

Na

+

+

extrusion, presumably by Na /K -ATPase activity. The calyx recorded in brain slices

does not fire spontaneously, however, it fires in vivo at frequencies of 71 ± 11 Hz in the
absence of sound and up to 352 ± 34 Hz with 80 dB tones (Lorteije et al., 2009). The

+

presynaptic [Na ] thus would be substantially higher in vivo than that of the slice
preparations, suggesting a mechanism to strongly modulate vesicle endocytosis in vivo. The

+

presynaptic cytosolic [Na ] is correlated well with the firing frequency and duration (Fig. 1)
and thus be able to precisely reflect the vesicle release level. Previous studies of showed
that cytosolic neurotransmitter concentration regulates vesicle cycling at GABAergic
terminals in hippocampal cultures (Wang et al., 2013) and transmitter concentration
rapidly controls the vesicular neurotransmitter contents (Hori and Takahashi, 2012;

Membrane capacitance measurement
Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and perfused with bubbled aCSF (2-3
ml/min) warmed to ~32°C by an in-line heater (Warner Instruments). Whole-cell
recordings were made from calyces of Held with an EPC-10 USB patch-clamp amplifier with
lock-in system and PatchMaster software (HEKA, Germany). For whole-cell membrane

capacitance (C

sinusoidal stimulus frequency was 1 kHz and the

2+

peak-to-peak voltage was 60 mV (Lindau and Neher, 1988). To isolate presynaptic Ca

currents in voltage-clamp experiments, TEA-Cl (10 mM), 4-aminopyridine (0.5 mM) and
tetrodotoxin (1 µM) were added to aCSF, substituting for NaCl with equal osmolarity. For

2

recordings of the endocytosis overshoot, MgCl

Bafilomycin A1 and KB-R7943 were prepared in stock solution with DMSO and added to
recording solution immediately before experiments. All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.3
with CsOH (310-315 mOsm). Tips of patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were coated with dental wax
to reduce stray capacitance. Series resistance (< 20 MΩ) was compensated up to 60% (10
μs lag). Data were obtained 4–20 min after break-in at sampling rate of 100 kHz and
filtered with an online Bessel filter at 2.9 kHz. Liquid junction potentials (10-11mV) were
