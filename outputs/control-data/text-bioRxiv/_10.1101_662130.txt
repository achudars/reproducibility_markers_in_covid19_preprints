Abstract
The brain has a remarkable ability to recognize objects from noisy or corrupted sensory
inputs. How this cognitive robustness is achieved computationally remains unknown. We
present a coding paradigm, which encodes structural dependence among features of the
input and transforms various forms of the same input into the same representation. The
paradigm, through dimensionally expanded representation and sparsity constraint, allows
redundant feature coding to enhance robustness and is efficient in representing objects.
We demonstrate consistent representations of visual and olfactory objects under
conditions of occlusion, high noise or with corrupted coding units. Robust face
recognition is achievable without deep layers or large training sets. The paradigm
produces both complex and simple receptive fields depending on learning experience,
thereby offers a unifying framework of sensory processing.

Introduction
A key insight in our understanding of brain function is that neurons serve as
feature detectors whose activity patterns form the basis of internal representations of the
external world. Central to this idea is the concept of receptive fields of individual
neurons, which correspond to the sensory features that elicit optimal response in the
neuron. Classic models of sensory processing are based on the hierarchical organization
of sensory features and the efficient coding hypothesis (1-3). In these models, sensory
features that define an object are faithfully and efficiently represented in the brain,
through receptive fields with minimal redundancy (1, 3). However, sensory stimuli are
often ambiguous and incomplete in the natural environment. Noise, occlusion and other
forms of corruption lead to altered representations (Figure 1A-C). Additional
mechanisms are required to infer the identity of the stimuli. These mechanisms require
the storage of reference representations in the brain, an unsolved problem on its own.
An alternative idea, espoused by Marr and Nishihara, is that the brain generates a
consistent representation of the object presented in different forms (4). This perceptual
invariance requires object representation to be stable under various conditions.
Meanwhile the representation must maintain sensitivity to distinguishing features among
different objects. These two diametrically opposed requirements are difficult to reconcile;
no current computational model allows the formation of a common representation from
different forms of the same inputs without extensively learning these forms. How the
receptive field properties develop and are utilized to form robust internal representation
remain unsolved. Here we present a computational framework that provides a solution to
the problem. It is conceptualized from a novel interpretation of efficient coding, with a

focus on efficient coding of objects instead of features. We show that an algorithm
developed from this new formulation allows redundant feature coding, thereby improve
both robustness and sensitivity of object representations as suggested (5).

Theoretical Basis
We first provide a reasoning of the framework based on Information Theory. To
simplify the problem, we define an object as a collection of coherent, structurally related
features corresponding to an entity. For example, a 2-dimensional face image is defined
by lines and shades that have a specific spatial arrangement; an odor is defined by the
odorant receptors it activates. In a given system, we consider a finite set of N objects (O)
to be encoded, represented, and recognized. We also consider a simplified model with
two levels of sensory coding, performed by a set of primary encoders (e.g., retinal cells)
that encodes sensory input at the individual feature level, and a set of representational
encoders (e.g., cortical neurons) that encodes the objects. In the classic interpretation of
efficient coding, efficiency is achieved when the capacity of the coding system conforms
to the entropy 𝐻𝐻(𝑋𝑋) associated with occurrence probability of stimulus features (X) (6).

Classic studies have demonstrated that in early sensory processing stages, efficient code
of sensory features can be obtained by adapting to the statistics of the natural stimuli (711).
For the representational encoders, according to the classic interpretation, an
efficient coding system ought to match its capacity to the entropy of objects, 𝐻𝐻(𝑂𝑂),

associated with the probability of occurrence of the objects ℙ(𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖 )(1). However, just as

the prior appearances of head or tail in multiple tosses of a coin have no bearing on the

outcome of the next toss, the prior occurrences of the objects do not predict their future
appearances. They are not particularly useful in their identification. According to the
principle of indifference, when there is no reason to believe that one outcome should
occur more frequently than any others, every event should be assigned equal probability
(12). Therefore, we propose that, for recognition purposes, the essential goal of sensory
processing is to seek maximal efficiency in representing objects by adapting the code to a
uniform distribution of objects (i.e., ℙ(𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖 ) = 1/𝑵𝑵). With this assumption, the entropy of

the object ensemble is maximal, 𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑂𝑂) = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑵𝑵. Incidentally, with redundancy
expressed as:

𝑅𝑅 = 1 −

𝐻𝐻(𝑂𝑂)
𝐶𝐶

(1)

where C represents the capacity of the coding system, minimal redundancy is reached
with 𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑂𝑂) for any value of capacity C. Thus, with this new interpretation of efficient
coding, maximal efficiency can be achieved when the coding capacity of the
representational encoders matches 𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑂𝑂).

Efficient coding of a uniform distribution is achievable through maximizing

distinction among the representations. As object identities are embedded in complex
statistical dependencies among its features, a code set that captures the structural
relationships among the object features and utilizes minimal combinations of units should
produce maximally distinct representations. Accordingly, an algorithm that preserves
information about the object while separating their representations should result in
independent encoding of the objects, make this framework object-centered. This
characteristic distinguishes our framework from that aiming for efficient coding of
features (13-15). Coding local features may allow faithful “reconstruction” of the sensory

inputs (4, 16, 17), but consistent representations of objects in cases of corruption,
occlusion, and neuronal loss cannot be easily attained without esoteric mechanisms and
learning from large examples (Fig. 1A-C). Missing or confounding features may generate
a representation that resembles something different (Fig. 1C). In our formulation, on the
other hand, individual features can be redundantly encoded, and their existence can be
inferred from the structural dependencies among features such that partial signals may
provide sufficient information to produce the same representation as the full-featured
stimulus (Fig. 1D, E). We refer to this formulation as dependency-capturing (DCapturing) framework.
What would be an algorithm that can allow the coding elements to capture
structural dependencies among sensory features? A ubiquitous observation in the sensory
system is an expansion of encoders from primary to high order centers. We therefore
adopt a dimensionally expanded representation in our framework. However, dimension
expansion results in many possible representations consistent with the input. To obtain a
unique representation of the objects, we constrain the system to settle on the sparsest
representation. We devise a learning process that maximizes mutual information between
the primary and the representational encoders while imposing sparsity constraints. In
addition to sparsity, we impose non-negativity constraint on the representations as well as
the dictionary. Specifically, we use an objective function to minimize both the Frobenius
and 𝐿𝐿0 norms (implemented as minimizing 𝐿𝐿1 norm) under non-negative constraint (see
methods). This approach of seeking a sparse code is similar to but distinct from those
used before (14, 15, 18, 19). A key difference is that, in our model, non-negativity
constraint is combined with dimension expansion and sparsity to effectively capture the

morphological components of the sensory inputs (20). As the representation of an object
can be considered as a vector of coefficients describing the linear combination of
dictionary elements (receptive fields), this constraint, while serving as a proxy of
neuronal responses carried by spikes, prevents the use of negative coefficients to subtract
features from arbitrarily complex dictionary elements. Sparsity constraint can be
interpreted as to force the grouping of distinguishing morphological features of stimuli
into receptive fields such that the fewest elements can capture the information about the
source. Together, these constraints force the dictionary elements to extract structural
relationship among features that are naturally present in the stimuli and maximize
distinction in representations. Utilization of the coding elements is non-linear; when
combined, the representation may not precisely recapitulate the original signal. However,
it allows individual features to be inferred from its relationships with others when
occlusion occurs.

Robustness of D-Capturing Framework
We illustrate this framework using a simplistic two-layer encoding system with a
set of 256 (16x16) primary encoders and a set of 500 representational encoders (Figs. 2A,
S1A). We train the two-layer network to represent black and white symbols from world
languages as objects, because the information of the symbol set can be readily quantified.
Dictionaries and representations can be obtained through sequential learning or through
non-negative blind source separation (21). We estimate the efficiency of the D-Capturing
paradigm by comparing redundancies (see methods) present in primary and
representational encoders. For the primary encoders, redundancy remains constant

regardless of the number of symbols (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when the number of symbols
matches that of the representational encoders (N =500), we observe much lower
redundancy in the representational than the primary encoders (Fig. 2B). This observation
indicates a high efficiency of the network in representing the symbols. Additionally, the
correlation matrix of representational encoders is very close to identity, indicating the
distinctiveness of representations (Fig. S1C). To examine whether the dictionary
elements capture the structural relationships among pixels in the symbols, we calculate
KL divergence between the distributions of each primary encoder in symbol and
dictionary spaces. The low divergence at low N indicates that the dictionary structures
match the symbols, and the representational encoders are capturing dependencies among
symbol features (Fig. 2C). This could be further verified by the similarity of correlation
matrices of primary encoders in the dictionary and the symbol spaces (Fig. S1B).
As N becomes larger, both redundancy in the representational encoders and KL
divergence increase, indicating that the structures of the dictionary elements diverge from
those of the symbols, and the code becomes less efficient (Fig. 2B and 2C).
Nevertheless, representational efficiency is still higher than that of the primary encoders.
We next assess representation robustness by adding Gaussian noise to the input
signal (Fig. 2D, ii), corrupting through randomly silencing the primary encoders (Fig.
2D, iii), or occluding part of the symbols (Fig. 2D, iv). In each case, representations of
the corrupted input patterns are nearly identical to those of uncorrupted signals (Fig. 2D,
i). Remarkably, when we inversely reconstruct images from the representations using the
dictionary elements, the recovered images are the original symbols (Fig. 2D). Note that
the high level of performance does not require learning from corrupted symbols. To

quantify the specificity of representations, we calculate the pairwise cosine distances
between a corrupted input and all learned symbols in the representation space and Zscored the distances. We observe high Z-scores for the correct input - symbol pairs,
indicating that the network generates representations that are highly specific in that they
match well with the original uncorrupted input but not others. In Monte Carlo simulations
with randomly missing primary encoders, high representational specificity is achieved
with as few as 60 (23.4% of the 256) encoders (Fig. 2E). We also find that the decoding
algorithm is sensitive to small differences in the input patterns. For example, two highly
similar inputs are represented differently and robustly (Fig. 2F). Thus, D-Capturing can
achieve robust and sensitive representations of independent objects.
We next apply the model to complex signals by training it to recognize human faces
(Fig. 3A). The learned dictionary elements are neither parts of faces, nor do they resemble
whole faces. Instead, they are composed of complex assemblage of facial features (Fig.
3B). This observation suggests that the algorithm captures structural relationships among
the features present in the training set. Representations of the faces are stable and robust
against common alterations such as headwear, facial hair or eyewear (Fig. 3C). The same
person is represented nearly identically when a mustache, a pair of sunglasses, or both were
added. Even when half of a face was blocked in different positions, the model produces the
same representation (Fig. 3D). Inversely reconstructed images from the representations are
similar to those of unadulterated faces even when the faces are half blocked (Fig. 3C and
D). Notably, the robustness is achieved from learning 2000 “clean” examples, in contrast
to many approaches using large of numbers of variegated examples as training sets.

We compared our “face code” against a recently proposed code based on principal
components analysis (PCA)(22). Using dictionaries obtained through PCA, the same face
with different parts occluded generated different representations. Image recovery produces
occluded, but not uncorrupted images (Fig. 3E). Quantification of specificity using Zscores show that only the D-Capturing network generates representations that are highly
specific in matching the original face (Fig. 3F). Recovered images from representation of
corrupted inputs are highly similar to the originals (Fig. 3G). PCA-based decoding does
not exhibit such selectivity or similarity (Fig. 3F and 3G). Thus, our framework suggests
a robust combinatorial face code distinct from the one proposed before (22, 23)

Near Optimal Sparse Recovery Enables Robustness of D-Capturing
The key to representational stability in the D-Capturing framework is that different
forms of the same stimulus converge onto the same representation. We find that stability
in our coding framework relies on L1 minimization (24), which can find the near-optimal
solutions (i.e., closest to L0 solutions) for sparse signals (25, 26). Classic linear models
such as non-negative factorization, or non-linear input transformations are not sufficient to
generate representational stability (20). We compared L1 minimization against Locally
Competitive Algorithm (LCA) (27) and the classic Linear Non-Linear (LNL) approach, in
generating representations of occluded faces. L1 minimization produces representations
with the highest specificity (Fig. 4A). Although LCA performs better than the LNL, neither
produces representations with the specificity of L1 minimization algorithm. When we
compare the sparsity of the solutions, it is evident that LNL does not produce sparse
solutions (Fig. 4B). LCA produces a solution that only utilizes a subset of components

derived from L1 minimization. Currently, we do not have a network implementation of the
L1 minimization procedure. It will be interesting to investigate this further.
In the D-Capturing framework, a large set of representational encoders could
maintain optimal sparsity and hence efficiency in encoding growing numbers of objects.
In an ideal example, if the number of representational encoders K > N, one may use N
units, with each representing an object uniquely. The system entropy is thus maintained at
log 𝑁𝑁 and redundancy is minimal. As N grows larger, the distinctiveness among

representations must be compromised to ensure no loss in information. A relaxation in
distinctiveness results in an increased redundancy because the coding capacity grows
beyond 𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑂𝑂) (Fig. 2). This corollary suggests that K should be as large as possible.
Indeed, a ubiquitous observation of sensory systems is that high brain areas contain much

larger numbers of neurons than that of the receptor sheets. From the perspective of theory
proposed here, one could argue that a large number of cortical neurons is needed to ensure
sparsity of the representation through dimension expansion, and to accommodate a large
number of objects to be encoded while maintaining sparsity and coding efficiency.

D-Capturing Permits Generation of Simple and Complex Projective Fields
This rationale raises a question as to what type of dictionary structures emerge if
the number of objects needs to be encoded far exceeds the number of neurons. To answer
this question, we trained the network with varying numbers of image patches taken from
natural images as individual stimuli (28) (Fig. S2A). To simulate the On and Off channels
in the mammalian visual system, the images are parsed into On and Off channels during
training. Increasing the size of the training set gradually produces dictionary elements with

localized and orientation-selective projective fields that are similar to the receptive fields
of V1 simple cells (17) (Fig 5A). Despite high correlations among the images,
representations are highly decorrelated (Fig. S2B and 2C). Interestingly, in all training
conditions we also find complex projective fields similar to the V1 complex cells (17).
With low number of training images, the dictionary elements are relatively complex (Fig.
5B). The percentage of simple projective fields in the dictionary increases with the size of
the training set. With a fixed set of training images, an increase in the representation
dimension reduces correlation among the representations but increases the correlations
among dictionary elements (Fig S2C). Thus, in this D-Capturing framework, localized
tuning features naturally emerge when large numbers of independent objects are encoded.
It can be argued that for areas such as V1, the requirement to encode extraordinarily large
number of independent stimuli in the natural environment forces it to produce localized
tuning features even though the drive of the algorithm is to maximally distinguish stimulus
representations. Importantly, complex tuning is always present in our model without
requiring it to be synthesized from simple cells as the classic model predicts (17).

D-Capturing Permits Robust Odor Identification
The examples using images show that our framework fulfills the criteria of
uniqueness, stability and sensitivity proposed by Marr and Nishihara in assessing
representational models for object recognition (4). Can this model be applied in other
sensory systems? Some sensory modalities do not detect external stimuli with pixel-like
spatial segregation of the input patterns. In the mammalian olfactory system, for example,
an odor activates a disparate set of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (29, 30). The pattern is

transformed into sparse activities in the piriform cortex, where odor identities presumably
are represented (31, 32). This two-stage system, without explicitly decoding elemental
features of the chemicals, has a remarkable ability in identifying individual odorants (30).
It is also resilient against neuronal loss; rodents can recognize trained odors even when
large portions of the olfactory bulb are removed (33). We, therefore, test whether our
framework can decipher physiological responses recorded from the olfactory system. In a
previous study, we have collected the responses of 94 glomeruli to 40 odorants recorded
from the dorsal surface of the mouse olfactory bulb (30). Training the model to form
sparse and independent representations of the odors in a 150-dimensional space, we find
nearly identical representation of odors can be generated from the responses of small
subsets of glomeruli (Fig. 6A). For example, odor representations generated from a
random set of 16 glomeruli are nearly identical to those from the full set, suggesting that
odor recognition can be achieved with far fewer glomeruli (Fig. 6A). Moreover, nearly
identical representation of the same odor is achieved using different, arbitrary sets of
glomeruli (Figure 6B). We have performed Monte Carlo analyses using the responses of
different numbers of randomly selected glomeruli and find a rapidly decrease of error rate
in odor identification when the number of glomeruli increases (Fig 6C). 100% of
odorants are correctly identified with an average of 15 or more glomeruli randomly
selected from the set (Fig. 6C). Decoding glomerular patterns is also robust against noise.
We have added Gaussian noise to the glomerular responses and calculated the
performance of odor identification from Monte Carlo analyses. Increasing noise level
reduces performance (Fig. 6D). Nevertheless, odor identification is resilient against
noise. At 10% noise level, nearly perfect identification is achieved with 20 glomeruli.

Even when the noise level reached 40% of the signal, 60% of odorants can be identified
using the responses from 30 glomeruli.

Discussion
Taken together, by seeking efficiency in object representation, arguably a more
pertinent goal of the sensory systems (34), the coding paradigm presented here allows
relationships arising from structural dependencies among the features to be directly
captured, creating representations that are robust against different forms of signal
corruption. It also allows a system to learn from small number of examples, requiring
neither multiple layers of processing nor learning from large number of variants to enable
representational robustness. D-Capturing provides a unifying framework to understand
robust object representation across different sensory modalities and across animal species
with various levels of complexity of the nervous system. It can explain the appearance of
both simple and complex cell like tunings simply based on the tasks and the number of
objects that need to be encoded. Importantly, in this framework, object recognition can be
achieved solely through forming the representations, without having to solve the inverse
problem or requiring additional steps to infer from the responses (Fig. 1D). This framework
is in contrast with most current theoretical paradigms, which treats the decoding of sensory
input as the inverse of sensory-triggered response to obtain stimulus features (Fig 1A).
Without the need to compare objects in the feature space, generating a representation can
be considered as encoding and decoding at the same time; encoding and decoding is one
and the same.

Figure 1. Illustration of the classic and D – Capturing frameworks for object
representation: A. In the classic framework, representation is compositional. Simple
features detected by the sensory organs are integrated in hierarchically organized circuits
to generate increasingly complex receptive fields (RFs). The set of RFs that are activated
by an object forms a representation of the object. B – C. Occlusion presents a problem for
the classic framework. With only partial features detected, representations of the objects
differ from the unobstructed one. Additional mechanisms such as inference from a stored
reference are required to identify the object (B). Ambiguity in confounding representation
may also lead to misidentification of the object (C). Where and how the references are
stored is not known. D – E. D-Capturing framework generates independent cortical
models of objects without explicitly recovering stimulus features. (D) In D-Capturing
framework, encoders capture features as well as the arrangement of these features with
respect to each other. This allows embedding of complex structural relationships among
features in the receptive fields of the encoders without requiring (nor exclusive of) a
hierarchical assembly. Only a sparse set of units are consistently active (highlighted and
displayed in green) to represent an object even though more units have RFs consistent
with the input. Because individual features are redundantly encoded, missing features can
be inferred from their relationship with those stored in the RFs. (E) D-Capturing allows
the same objects, occluded or not, to generate the same representation.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS
Methods:
Learning algorithm
Dictionary learning is treated as a blind source separation (BSS) problem (35, 36). An input
signal is modeled as the response of M primary encoders. In the case of images, M =m1·m2,
where m1 and m2 are the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the images. For olfactory
data analyses, M equals the number of glomeruli. For a set of N signals used in a training
set, the training set is presented as an input matrix X ∈ ℝ𝑴𝑴 ×𝑵𝑵 , representing the response
of M pixel (glomeruli) to N patterns (odors). The matrix X is then factorized into two
matrices A and Φ, so that 𝑿𝑿 = 𝜱𝜱𝜱𝜱. Here, A ∈ ℝ𝑲𝑲 ×𝑵𝑵 is the matrix representation of N
patterns (odors) in a K dimensional basis set defined by Φ ∈ ℝ𝑴𝑴×𝑲𝑲 .
To get the factor matrices through BBS, we imposed restriction on A to be sparse. The
measure of sparsity was chosen to be L0 norm, but the solution is achieved through
minimizing L1 norm. In addition to this sparsity constrain, we demanded both A and Φ to
be non-negative.

Several possible BSS algorithms could result in an appropriate matrix decomposition under
the given constraints (19, 21, 37). In particular, we used non-negative blind source
separation algorithm nGMCA (21, 38, 39). When a L1 measure of sparseness is used, then
the sum of the absolute values of coefficients of A is minimized. The minimization problem
takes the form of:
1
‖𝑿𝑿 − 𝜱𝜱𝜱𝜱‖22 + 𝜆𝜆‖𝑨𝑨‖1 ,
𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑨𝑨 ≥ 0; 𝜱𝜱 ≥ 0
2
Thus, the process to solve this problem requires the minimization of the Frobinius norm
difference (i.e., the Euclidean Distance) between the two sides of the equation and the
minimization of the L1 norm.
𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

Each time BSS is performed, the Φ matrix was seeded with random numbers. Optimization
was performed until convergence or when predefined number of iterations was reached.
Sparse coding:
Once the dictionary Φ is learned, any input pattern can be transformed into its
corresponding representation. Transformation of input patterns is the process of finding the
representation 𝒂𝒂 that satisfies the equation: 𝒙𝒙 = 𝜱𝜱𝜱𝜱. In our case, the dimension of the
representational layer is chosen to be higher than that of the input layer, i.e., K > M. Here,
decoding becomes an under-determined problem. Theories developed independently by
Donoho (39-41), and by Candes and Tao (25, 26, 42) show that a unique solution can be
obtained by imposing a sparseness constraint to the equation when solving the optimization
problem. The most common use of sparsity definition includes L0 and L1. In our approach
we perform L1 minimization to solve:
min‖𝒂𝒂‖1 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ‖𝒙𝒙 − 𝜱𝜱𝜱𝜱‖2 ≤ 𝜖𝜖
The L1-minimization problem can be implemented by a standard convex optimization
procedure, which can be found in several publications (41-45).

Redundancy measurement:
To measure redundancy in encoding objects, we treated the objects as following a uniform
distribution, i.e., ℙ(𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖 ) = 1/𝑵𝑵, where 𝑵𝑵 is the total number of objects. The entropy of the
ensemble of the objects is therefore 𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑶𝑶) = 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑵𝑵. We then calculated the capacity
of the primary encoder set (C) using the probabilities of occurrence of each encoder,
ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1) = 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 :
𝑀𝑀

𝐶𝐶 = � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑖𝑖=1

Redundancy was calculated as

𝑅𝑅 = 1 −

1

+ (1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 ) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
(1 − 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖

𝐻𝐻𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑶𝑶)
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑵𝑵
=1−
𝐶𝐶
𝐶𝐶

The redundancy for representational encoders was calculated in a similar way, the only
difference being that the representations were converted to binary forms using a Heaviside
step function so that their L0 norms could be considered while calculating probability of
occurrence of individual encoders.
KL Divergence between dictionary and images
We used the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL Divergence) to quantify the structural
differences between symbols and dictionary elements. KL divergence (𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 (ℙ||ℚ)) is a
measure of information gained when a posterior probability distribution ℙ is used to
calculate the entropy instead of the prior distribution ℚ. Denoting ℚ to be distribution over
the states of a single pixel in symbol space and ℙ to be the distribution over states of the
same pixel in dictionary space, 𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 (ℙ||ℚ) measures the information gained in considering
the pixel to be coming from a dictionary element rather than symbols. A low divergence
for all the pixels indicates that there is no gain in information if we consider any pixel to
be coming from dictionary, indicating that the structure of the dictionary elements is same
as structure of the symbols.
To calculate the distribution over the states of pixels in the dictionary space, all dictionary
elements were binarized using a Heaviside step function. Probability of occurrence of
individual pixels was calculated based on the number of dictionary elements in which the
pixel is active. For instance, if a particular pixel 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 was active in 𝑛𝑛 out of 𝑲𝑲 dictionary
elements, then the probability of occurrence of pixel 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 was calculated as
ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1) =

𝑛𝑛
𝑲𝑲

Probability of occurrence of the same pixel in symbol space is calculated based on the
number of symbols 𝑚𝑚 in which it is active i.e.

ℚ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1) =

𝑚𝑚
𝑵𝑵

Here 𝑵𝑵 is the number of symbols being encoded. Finally, the KL Divergence between the
two distributions is calculated as
𝐷𝐷𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) = ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1) 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙

�1 − ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1)�
ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1)
+ �1 − ℙ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1)� 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
ℚ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1)
�1 − ℚ(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 1)�

Specificity calculations:
To quantify the specificity of a representational vector in representing the original object,
we computed Z-scored similarity. Cosine similarity score between the representation of the
test object (atest) and all objects in the training set (Atraining) were calculated and Z-scored.
A high Z-score indicated high similarity between the representations of the test object and
a particular object in Atraining. In the figures, we plot the Z-scores for altered images with
their unadulterated counterpart, which show high specificity in representing the original
object.
Simulating corrupted signals:
To test the robustness of object representation by the D-Capturing framework, signals from
the training set were selected and corrupted. The corrupted signals were subject to sparse
decoding to generate their representations, which were then compared with those of the
signals in the training set. We performed the following three types of corruption:
Noise-added corruption: we introduce noise by adding a Gaussian i.i.d. matrix 𝓝𝓝 of
varying standard deviation to the input matrix X. i.e. 𝑿𝑿𝓝𝓝 = 𝑿𝑿 + 𝓝𝓝, where 𝑿𝑿𝓝𝓝 ∈ ℝ𝑀𝑀 ×𝑁𝑁 ,
is a matrix representation of noisy input. For Monte Carlo analysis, as described below,
each time a simulation was performed, a different noise matrix 𝓝𝓝 was introduced.
Pixel corruption: For a given signals, a fraction of the M pixels (glomeruli) were selected
from the input. Their values are maintained whereas the coefficients of the rest were set to
zero.

Occlusion: For images, a contiguous set of pixels were selected, and their coefficient values
were set to zero.
Monte Carlo analysis:
We performed Monte Carlo simulations by applying pixel corruption to the input signals
and varying the number of corrupted pixels. 100 random sets (numbers varied from 2 to
M) of pixels (glomeruli) were selected. Using each of these randomly chosen sets, we
performed sparse decoding to generate representation of the input patterns.
Input Identification
To calculate the correct identification of the object, we used the representation of each
input in the training set as a library. The representation of each corrupted signal was

compared with that in the library and cosine errors were computed. An input pattern was
considered correctly identified if the cosine error between its representation and that of the
original signal was minimum (smaller than with representation of other patterns).
Data:
Symbols: A set of 1000 symbols from word languages were obtained and digitized to
16x16 pixel arrays.
Natural images: Natural scenes from Van Hateren data base (28) were digitized as
grayscale pictures. Image patches of 16x16 size were randomly selected from the images.
A total of 3000 patches were used to form a training set.
Facial images: For face recognition, 2000 frontal faces were obtained from Google search
of publicly available images, trimmed and resized to 25 x 25 pixels.
Olfactory bulb recordings: The data used was previously published (30) calcium imaging
of the olfactory bulb, in which we have imaged the response of dorsal olfactory bulb of
GCaMP2 mice to 189 chemicals. Of these chemicals, ~150 did not elicit significant
responses in the glomeruli. Since non-responding stimuli provide no information for our
analyses, we removed them from further analysis. To accomplish this, we calculated the
Euclidean length of each response and plotted a histogram of response amplitude. The data
set used in the paper contains ΔF/F responses of 94 glomeruli to various odorants. At a
threshold of 0.1 (10% ΔF/F), 40 chemicals are shown to elicit a measurable response. These
odor-evoked responses were used as a training set.
Projective fields generation from natural images:
The mammalian visual systems process visual information in On and Off channels. On
channel images were the normal images whereas Off channel images were the inverted
images. To simulate parallel processing of the two channels, the On and Off images were
concatenated along the rows and dictionary elements were generated by performing BSS
on the concatenated matrix. The projective fields were constructed by superposing the Onchannel portion of the dictionary element with the negative of Off-channel portion of the
dictionary element.

Figure S2. Natural image analysis: A. Examples of image patches from natural images
used for training. B. Correlation among image pixels as they appear in images and among
representational components (bottom panel) indicate decorrelation among
representational units compared to image pixels. C. Correlation among representational
units decrease as their numbers is increased. Bars indicate the mean of observed
correlation coefficients (absolute values) and the whiskers indicate the observed standard
deviation in the values.
