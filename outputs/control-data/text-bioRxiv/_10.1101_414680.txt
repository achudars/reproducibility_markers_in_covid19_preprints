Abstract
Background: A global aging population requires focusing on the risk factors for
unhealthy aging, preventive medicine, and chronic disease management. The
identification of adverse health outcomes in older adults has been addressed by the
characterization of frailty as a biological syndrome. On the other hand, oxidative
stress and telomere length have been suggested as biomarkers of aging.
Objective: To study the association of oxidative stress, telomere length, and frailty in
an old age population.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on 2015 data from 202 members
from a cohort of older adults (n=202; gender F/M ratio: 133/69; mean age: 69.89 ±
7.39 years). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by dichlorofluorescin
diacetate, and lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde. Telomere length was
determined using qPCR with SYBR Green Master Mix.
Results: Statistical analysis showed an association between telomere length and
frailty but no association between oxidative stress on telomere length or frailty.
Conclusions: Telomere length could eventually be used as a marker to discriminate
between healthy and unhealthy aging as expressed by frailty phenotype. However,
oxidative stress seems as just a biological process of aging.
Keywords: healthy aging, biomarkers, homeostasis.

Introduction
A global aging population has motivated researchers to focus on risk factors,
preventive medicine, and chronic diseases in order to prepare for the coming health
issues that this phenomenon will cause. Economy and society itself will suffer from
the change in population age distribution around the globe. Between the years 2015
and 2050 the proportion of the world's population with more than 60 years of age (1)
will increase from 900 million to 2000 million, an increase from 12 to 22% (1). In
2015, Mexico had one older adult (60 years of age and older) for every 10 young
adults (15 years old), a figure that is expected to double by 2050 (2). At present,
Mexico City is the entity with the highest index of aging in Mexico with 59.1 in 2014
and a projection of 108.7 by 2030 (3). Due to this global demographic transition,
successful aging (avoidance of disease/disability, high physical and cognitive
function, and sustained engagement with social activities) has become a priority (4).
The concept of aging suggests the emergence and accumulation of chronic
conditions such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, and
cerebrovascular diseases, which are also the main causes of death at this stage of
life. Hence, the identification of adverse health outcomes in older adults has been
addressed by the characterization of frailty as a biological syndrome. Frailty has
been described as the loss of physiologic reserve and resistance to stressors that
involves multiple physical, mental, and emotional deficits (5). As frailty advances,
vulnerability to dependence increases, and the risk of adverse events such as
functional decline, falls, hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality becomes
more plausible (5,6). In Mexico City, a prevalence of frailty of 20.6% among older

adults has been reported (7), an intermediate level when compared with global
reports from 4% to 59.1% (8).
Hence the search for biomarkers that can help define frailty at a biological level could
be used to improve the diagnosis of frailty, to identify pre-frail patients at an earlier
stage, and to evaluate the biological outcome when frailty is modified by factors such
as healthy eating or physical exercise. On the matter, telomere length, which has
been associated with lifespan (9), has had a controversial role in frailty description.
Although no correlation was found for Chinese (10) and German (11) populations,
we recently observed shorter telomeres associated with frailty in a Mexican
population (12).
Telomeres are protective and regulatory structures of the genome, their shortening
is associated with chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes (13), obesity, and
hypertension (14,15), and has been associated with lifespan (16). Lifespan depends
on many internal and external factors such as aging, pollution, quality of life, and
education, among others. Consequently, telomere shortening and frailty would seem
to be intimately related.
Most of the associations with telomere length mentioned above involve the
production of oxidative stress that can affect DNA in a direct form. Oxidative stress
has been associated with chronic damage in several conditions including DM and
hypertension (9,17–19). At a molecular level, oxidative stress is capable of altering
DNA and has been linked to telomere length reduction (20). In order to determine
the possible association between reactive oxygen species (ROS), telomere length
and frailty, we evaluated the effect of oxidative stress on telomere length as a first

approach to explain telomere length shortening in frail patients. Then, we assessed
both telomere length and oxidative stress, as frailty biomarkers.
Materials and methods
Participants
This is a cross-sectional study based on the baseline 2015 data from the "Cohort of
Obesity, Sarcopenia, and Frailty of Older Mexican Adults” (COSFOMA) a study
involving 1,252 adults ≥60 years of age affiliated to the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro
Social (IMSS), residents of Mexico City. The IMSS is part of the social protection
system in health in Mexico that provides services to salaried workers and their
families including medical services and economic benefits such as disability
pensions, or paid retirement. In Mexico City, IMSS has 48 primary care medical units
attending 36.5% of the population and approximately 50.9% of older adults (7).
A total of 202 individuals from the 1,252 involved in COSFOMA, agreed to
participate in the study. In the COSFOMA study, participants were chosen based on
their residence through a simple random selection from the list of older adults
affiliated to IMSS from the 48 first-level clinics of Mexico City. Written letters
delivered to their home addresses were used as invitations to inform them of the
nature of the study and to provide them with an appointment at their clinic. When the
older adults did not attend the appointment, a phone invitation was made and in
some cases a home visit (7). Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture of the
median cubital vein using the vacutainer system. Samples collected from April to
September 2015 were used for this study.

Ethics Statement
This research protocol was conducted with the approval of the National Committee
of Scientific Research as well as by the Ethics Committee for Health Research of the
Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (R-2012-785-067). All participants gave written
informed consent. This study was performed according to The Code of Ethics of the
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.
Evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
To evaluate the formation of ROS by fluorometry, 5 μl of serum and 85 μl of PBS 1X
buffer was added to a 10 μl solution of dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CAS Number
4091-99-0, Sigma-Aldrich), incubated in darkness for 30 minutes at 37ºC for the
oxidation of the dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) to the fluorescent compound 2-7dichlorofluorescin by the presence of peroxide hydrogen to occur. The samples were
then read at 498 nm excitation and 522 nm emission (Cytation 5 Cell Imaging MultiMode Reader), previously calibrated with a standard curve. Data is shown as
pmol/μL of serum.
Determination of lipid peroxidation
To evaluate lipid peroxidation we measured malondialdehyde (MDA) as a reaction
of thiobarbituric acid (CAS Number 504-17-6, Sigma-Aldrich) 50 μl of serum with 25
μl of PBS 1X were added to 50 μl of thiobarbituric acid. The sample was placed in a
boiling bath at 94°C for 20 minutes, then centrifuged at 10.500 rpm for 15 min, the
supernatant was read at 532 nm with a spectrophotometer (EPOCH), which was
previously calibrated with a standard curve. Data is shown as μmol/μL of serum.

Sample processing and telomere length assessment
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes by the salting out
procedure. Purified DNA samples were aliquoted in a concentration of 10ng/µl and
stored at -70 °C until use. For telomere length assessment, we followed the qPCR
method published by O´Callaghan and Fenech (21). The number of copies of
telomere repeats was determined by the standard curve of Tel STD, while the
standard curve of 36B4 STD was used as a housekeeping gene.
After the qPCR reaction on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystem), the Ct values of each sample were extrapolated in their corresponding
curves by a linear regression test to determine telomere length. The Maxima SYBR
Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix 2X (Thermo Scientific, California, USA) was used.
The cycling conditions for both genes were: 10 minutes at 95°C, followed by 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 1 minute, followed by a melting curve. Data
is shown as kilobase pairs (kb).
Frailty
Operationalization of the frailty phenotype was performed using the five criteria
proposed by Fried (22). Frail adults are defined as those with three or more of the
following criteria: self-report of weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity,
slowness, and weakness (low grip strength). The presence of one or two criteria
indicates a pre-frail condition, whereas the absence of criteria indicates a robust or
non-frail state (7). Participants were classified as non-frail (score 0), pre-frail (score
1–2), and frail (score 3–5).

Statistical analysis
In general, the data analysis and visualizations were carried out with free (R software
(23) and commercial (SPSS and GraphPad) software. In particular, we used ggplot2
(24) and ggsignif (25) R packages. Quantitative variables are presented as the
arithmetic mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD). Qualitative variables are
presented as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies. BMI was reclassified into
nutritional status according to the WHO criteria (underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal
weight 18.5–24.9 kg/m2, overweight 25–29.9 kg/m2, and obesity ≥30 kg/m2) to
explore the possible correlation between telomere length and nutritional status. In
order to explore the distribution of DCFH (pmol/μL of serum), MDA (μmol/μL of
serum) and telomere length (kb) between frailty categories (non-frail, pre-frail, and
frail), we generated boxplots and calculated their p-value by Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction.
The relationship between DCFH and MDA with telomere length by frailty categories
was explored by scatter plots and linear regression with Pearson correlation
coefficients (r).
The distribution of telomere and oxidative stress among older adult groups was
evaluated calculating p-values obtained by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test.
The association between three frailty categories with DCFH, MDA, and telomere
length was analyzed by multinomial logistic regression analysis with p-values
obtained by Student’s t test.

Previous analyses were carried out to determine a possible linear correlation
between oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and telomere length in three conditions:
non-frail, pre-frail, and frail old age groups. However, to establish the magnitude of
the association against the frailty category, we performed a logistic regression
considering the Non-frail group as the reference category to compare the odds of
being classified as Pre-frail or Frail considering oxidative stress (DCFH or MDA) or
telomere length. The odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were
obtained for precision.
Pearson correlation coefficients, as well as multinomial logistic regression analysis,
were adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), chronic illnesses (0, 1, ≥2),
educational level (without studies, 1-6 years, and ≥ 7 years), drinking (binary),
smoking (binary), and sex (binary), as possible confounders.
Results
From the random selection of the COSFOMA study, we invited its 1,252 members
and recruited 202 older adults (≥60 years of age) who agreed to participate in this
study. The general characteristics as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)
measured by DCFH, lipid peroxidation measured by MDA, and telomere length
measurements of the older adults, 133 females (65.8%) and 69 males (34.2%),
ranging between 60 and 95 years (mean age: 68.9 ± 7.4) are shown in Table I.
Regarding the frailty status, 14.4% of participants were classified as non-frail, 60.4%
as pre-frail, and 25.2% as frail.

The aim of this study was to determine a possible association between oxidative

telomere length, and frailty status. We hypothesized that old age subjects with frailty

would have increased oxidative stress measurements associated with shorter
telomeres when compared with both pre-frail and non-frail subjects.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed no significant differences between ROS
(DCFH, p= 0.76) or lipid peroxidation (MDA, p= 0.37) among the frailty categories
whether divided or not by sex. Between frailty categories, we did find a significant
difference with telomere length (p< 0.001). This difference was explained by lower
telomere length in the frail group compared against the non-frail (p< 0.001) and the
pre-frail (p< 0.001) groups, while the differences between non-frail vs. pre-frail were
not statistically significant (p= 0.065) (Figure 1).

males by Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Bonferroni correction < 0.016 was calculated to assign
significant differences; p-values < 0.001 (“***”). The p-value was obtained by Kruskal-Wallis
nonparametric test.

Next, to assess the possible association between lipid peroxidation (MDA), reactive
oxygen species (DCFH) or telomere length with old age groups, we performed a
multinomial logistic regression adjusted by age, body mass index, chronic illnesses,
educational level, drinking, smoking, and sex. Figure 2 shows the magnitude and
precision of the association of oxidative stress and telomere length on pre-frail and
frail older adults when considering the non-frail subjects as the reference category.
We observed that the odds of being classified in the pre-frail group increases 0.989
per each pmol of DCFH (CI 95% [0.97-1.007] p=0.232), and 1.011 per each μmol of
MDA (CI 95% [0.971-1.052] p=0.611), while every kb of telomere (a long telomere)
protects 1.33 times from pre-frail classification (OR= 0.749, CI 95% [0.543-1.032]
p=0.012). On the other hand, the odds of being classified in the frail group increase
0.986 per each pmol of DCFH (CI 95% [0.964-1.008] p=0.217), and 1.018 per each
μmol of MDA (CI 95% [0.971-1.066] p=0.466), while every kb of telomere (a longer
telomere) protects 2.28 times from frailty classification (OR= 0.438, CI 95% [0.2990.641] p<0.001).

Figure 2. Association of oxidative stress and telomere length in Mexican older adults. The forest plot
shows the multinomial logistic regression considering the Non-frail group as the reference category
to calculate the odds of being classified as Pre-frail or Frail considering oxidative stress (DCFH or
MDA) or telomere length. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) were obtained
for precision and adjusted by age, BMI, educational level, chronic illnesses, smoking, drinking, and
sex. Bold text indicates a statistically significant difference (p-value cut-off <0.05).

Finally, we evaluated the relationship between DCFH or MDA on telomere length
according to frailty status. First, we calculated the global effect of both DCFH (r = 0.031, p= 0.66) or MDA (r= 0.095, p= 0.18) in telomere length and observed no
significant correlation between ROS or lipid peroxidation and telomere length. Then,
we performed the analysis for each frailty category (Figure 3).
In addition, as the effect of obesity or adiposity on telomere length has been reported
previously (26,27), and although a negative association of BMI with telomere length
is reduced among older people (27), we explored the possible correlation between
telomere length and nutritional status (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and
obesity), but no significant association was found for either group: underweight (r=
0.640, p= 0.088), normal weight (r= 0.089, p= 0.49), overweight (r= 0.110, p= 0.33),

Discussion
Frailty, telomere length, and oxidative stress were evaluated in a group of older
adults in order to define their association and correlation. A first analysis was carried
out to determine our hypothesized distinct distributions between oxidative stress,

lipid peroxidation, and telomere length according to frailty groups; however, we
observed a significantly different distribution only for telomere length.
Telomere length was found to be associated with pre-frail and frail categories as
previously reported (12). This specific variable has become of importance for older
adults since, despite the philosophical debate about the definition of frailty, it has
shown to have a predictive value on poor health outcomes. Here, we have found
that a shorter telomere, which by itself has been previously related to a shorter life
span, is associated with the frailty status. Even more, when considering non-frail
older adults telomere length as the reference category, short telomeres are
associated with pre-frail older adults while even shorter telomere length is associated
with frail status. As these results are adjusted by age, body mass index, chronic
illnesses, educational level, drinking, smoking, and sex (possible confounders
included in our analysis), we consider that telomere length is a strong competitor as
a biomarker of frailty status. To achieve this, this study must be replicated in other
populations in order for telomere length to be considered as a biomarker of frailty
since telomere length is affected by environmental factors (28).
Elseways, telomere length has been found to have modifiable factors such as
smoking and obesity, which are associated with shorter telomeres while exercise
and a healthy diet preserve telomere length (4,29). Furthermore, a recent study
showed that frailty can be modified by exercise and nutrition, reversing the frailty
state to a non-frail (30). Hence, telomere length determination as a part of frailty
diagnosis could help apply prompt intervention, either in pre-frail or frail status, on
the above mentioned factors in order to reverse this condition. If pre-frail status and

frailty are assessed on time, more costly medical outcomes could be prevented and
quality of life improved. Research in this direction may help determine frailty in a
more quantitative manner with a biological background. Although telomere length
determination is currently not widely available, its future implementation could be
considered as part of the frailty diagnosis, as a non-invasive tool.
On that matter, the association of frailty status with telomere length could mean that
besides its definition, frailty has a biological counterpart that changes as frailty status
does. Hence, we evaluated oxidative stress as a probable cause for telomere
shortening that could be assessed as telomere length and found a mild effect of MDA
on telomere length (r=0.17; p=0.06) for the pre-frail category. MDA is a marker for
lipid peroxidation, oxidative degradation of lipids that follow the excess of free radical
formation. The increase of MDA in pre-fail patients and the decrease in telomere
length between pre-frail and frail patients suggests that oxidative stress has an effect
on telomere length regarding frailty status in older adults.
The main limitation of the present study is that even when the cohort used is
constituted by 1,252 individuals, we were only able to include 202 participants,
meaning our recruitment skills were insufficient. The hypothesis generated regarding
the present data could be proven with a longitudinal study that would provide further
information regarding the effect of MDA on telomere length and frail status. Also, a
more thorough analysis of oxidative stress, specifically the measurement of 8hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine, a specific biomarker of oxidative stress in DNA (31),
would enrich the knowledge on the effect of these two biological outcomes of frailty.

It is worth mentioning that when not considering drinking, smoking, and chronic
illnesses as confounder variables, we observed a linear association between MDA
and telomere length (p= 0.089). We are convinced that an ideal approach would
have these as exclusion criteria in order to avoid masking this biological
measurement.
In conclusion, we reaffirmed an association of telomere length in the frailty
phenotype and found a low association between lipid peroxidation and telomere
length. Whether oxidative stress is the main cause of telomere length shortening in
frail old adults remains to be proven. Moreover, we found no effect of drinking or
smoking as confounder variables regarding telomere length or oxidative stress in
frail old adults for this study.
