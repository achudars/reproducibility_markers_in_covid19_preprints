Abstract
ANO1 (TMEM16A) is a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel that regulates diverse cellular functions including
fluid secretion, neuronal excitability, and smooth muscle contraction. ANO1 is activated by elevation
of cytosolic Ca2+ and modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here we
describe a closely concerted experimental and computational study, including electrophysiology,
mutagenesis, functional assays, and extended sampling of lipid-protein interactions with molecular
dynamics (MD) to characterize PI(4,5)P2 binding modes and sites on ANO1. ANO1 currents in
excised inside-out patches activated by 270 nM Ca2+ at +100 mV are increased by exogenous PI(4,5)P2
with an EC50 = 1.24 µM. The effect of PI(4,5)P2 is dependent on membrane voltage and Ca2+ and is
explained by a stabilization of the ANO1 Ca2+-bound open state. Unbiased atomistic MD simulations
with 1.4 mol% PI(4,5)P2 in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer identified 8 binding sites with significant
probability of binding PI(4,5)P2. Three of these sites captured 85% of all ANO1 - PI(4,5)P2
interactions. Mutagenesis of basic amino acids near the membrane-cytosol interface found three
regions of ANO1 critical for PI(4,5)P2 regulation that correspond to the same three sites identified by
MD. PI(4,5)P2 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between amino acid sidechains and
phosphate/hydroxyl groups on PI(4,5)P2. Binding of PI(4,5)P2 alters the position of the cytoplasmic
extension of TM6, which plays a crucial role in ANO1 channel gating, and increases the accessibility
of the inner vestibule to Cl- ions. We propose a model consisting of a network of three PI(4,5)P2
binding sites at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane allosterically regulating ANO1 channel gating.

Significance statement
Membrane proteins dwell in a sea of phospholipids that not only structurally stabilize the proteins by
providing a hydrophobic environment for their transmembrane segments, but also dynamically
regulate protein function. While many cation channels are known to be regulated by
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), relatively little is known about anion channel
regulation by phosphoinositides. Using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified several PI(4,5)P2 binding sites in ANO1
(TMEM16A), a Cl- channel that performs myriad physiological functions from epithelial fluid
secretion to regulation of electrical excitability. These binding sites form a band at the cytosolic
interface of the membrane that we propose constitute a network to dynamically regulate this highly
allosteric protein.

Introduction
Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCCs) are jacks of all trades and masters of many. These ion
channels facilitate the passive flow of Cl- across cell membranes in response to elevation of cytosolic
Ca2+ (1). Although CaCCs are probably best known for driving fluid secretion across mammalian
epithelia, they are intimately involved in manifold physiological functions in all eukaryotes. CaCCs
mediate action potentials in algae, the fast block to polyspermy in Anuran eggs, and regulate functions
as diverse as smooth muscle contraction, nociception, neuronal excitability, insulin secretion, and cell
proliferation and migration in mammals (1-13). While there are several types of CaCCs, the so-called
classical CaCCs are encoded by the ANO1 (TMEM16A) and ANO2 (TMEM16B) genes (14-16).
Activation of ANO1 in its physiological context typically begins with ligand binding to a Gprotein coupled receptor that activates phospholipase-C (PLC) (17-20). PLC hydrolyzes
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the plasma membrane to produce diacylgycerol
and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors then
triggers release of Ca2+ from internal ER stores and initiates store-operated Ca2+ entry. The resulting
rise in cytosolic Ca2+ activates Cl- flux because of conformational changes induced by direct binding
of Ca2+ to the ANO1 protein (21-25). Calmodulin is not required for channel activation (21, 26).
Structurally, ANO1 is a dimer with each subunit composed of 10 transmembrane (TM)
segments. The Cl- selective pore of each subunit is surrounded by TMs 4–7 (22, 23, 27, 28) and each
subunit has a Ca2+ binding site formed by amino acids E654, E702, E705, E734, and D738 in TMs 6–
8 (22-25, 29). Channel gating involves conformational changes of TM6 (24, 25, 30).
ANO1 is also regulated by PI(4,5)P2 (31-35). Ta et al. (33) have reported that PI(4,5)P2
stimulates ANO1 currents in excised patches. We (32) and Tembo et al. (35) have shown that PI(4,5)P2
can prevent and rescue Ca2+-dependent rundown caused by spontaneous PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. In
whole-cell recording, we also showed that reduction of cellular PI(4,5)P2 by the voltage sensitive
phosphatase Dr-VSP or by activation of GPCRs causes a reduction in ANO1 current (32). Pritchard
et al. (34) show biochemical evidence that PI(4,5)P2 binds to ANO1, but they report that exogenous
PI(4,5)P2 decreases endogenous Cl- currents thought to be encoded by ANO1 in inside-out patches
of pulmonary artery cells, in contrast to the results with heterologously-expressed ANO1 (32, 33).
PI(4,5)P2 binding sites typically have two or more positively charged amino acids with at least
one Lys, and at least one aromatic residue (36-38). One well-known PI(4,5)P2 binding site is the
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain which binds PI(4,5)P2 in a pocket of basic amino acids that are
non-contiguous in the primary sequence but are close in proximity in the folded protein (39). On the
other hand, “electrostatic type” binding sites typified by the CALM domain are clusters of contiguous
basic amino acids that interact with phospholipids relatively non-specifically without forming a
binding pocket (40). A wide variety of ion channels are regulated by PI(4,5)P2 (36-38, 41). In Kir
channels, these basic amino acids are located near the interface between the cytosol and the bulk lipid
bilayer where the polar headgroups of lipids typically reside (42-44).

The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms of regulation of ANO1 by
PI(4,5)P2 and identify amino acids that stabilize PI(4,5)P2 binding. We find that PI(4,5)P2 stimulates
ANO1 currents in excised patches in a voltage- and Ca2+- regulated manner. Mutagenesis and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that ANO1 has multiple PI(4,5)P2 binding sites. These
data add to a growing body of knowledge showing that ANO1 is a highly allosteric protein that is
gated by a network of interactions involving both Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2.
Results
PI(4,5)P2 is a Positive Regulator of ANO1 Currents.
To determine the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on ANO1, we transiently expressed ANO1 in HEK293
cells and measured the effect of dioctanoyl phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (diC8-PI(4,5)P2), a
water-soluble, short acyl chain PI(4,5)P2, on inside-out excised patches. To reduce variability caused
by different amounts of endogenous PI(4,5)P2, we first removed PI(4,5)P2 from the membrane patch
by excising it into a solution containing 10 mM Mg2+ and 0 Ca2+/5 mM EGTA. Mg2+ competes with
ANO1 for binding to PI(4,5)P2 by electrostatically masking negative charges on PI(4,5)P2 (45). ANO1
currents were measured during voltage steps first in the presence of 270 nM Ca2+ (Iinitial) and then with
270 nM Ca2+ plus 10 µM diC8-PI(4,5)P2 (IPIP2) (Fig. 1A). The increase in current (ΔIPIP2) was calculated
as (IPIP2/Iinitial-1)*100%. On average, application of diC8-PI(4,5)P2 at +100 mV increased the current
79.1 ± 15.1% (n = 8). The effect of diC8-PI(4,5)P2 was slowly reversible: the currents decreased in
amplitude when the patch was exposed to 270 nM Ca2+ in the absence of diC8-PI(4,5)P2 and exposure

to 10 mM Mg2+ reduced the current further to its initial level (Fig. 1A).
The Effect of PI(4,5)P2 is Regulated by Voltage and Ca2+.
The effect of diC8-PI(4,5)P2 was modulated by both Ca2+ and voltage (Fig. 1B-D). At all
voltages, ΔIPIP2 was greatest at lower Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1D). With 270 nM Ca2+, ΔIPIP2 at +100
mV was 79.1%, while with 1.1 µM Ca2+ ΔIPIP2 was <10%. Moreover, at all Ca2+ concentrations except
the lowest [Ca2+] tested (270 nM), current stimulation by PI(4,5)P2 decreased with depolarization (Fig.
1C). For example, with 360 nM Ca2+ at -100 mV ΔIPIP2 was 83.8 ± 30%, but at +100 mV ΔIPIP2 was
only 37.5 ± 9.1%. The IC50 for Ca2+ suppression of the PI(4,5)P2 effect was determined by fitting the
data in Fig. 1D to exponential equations. The estimated IC50 for attenuation of the diC8-PI(4,5)P2
stimulatory effect was 390 nM Ca2+ at 100 mV and 656 nM Ca2+ at -100 mV (Fig. 1D). Because ANO1
has a lower affinity for Ca2+ at hyperpolarized potentials (46), the observation that PI(4,5)P2 has a
larger effect at hyperpolarized potentials and at lower Ca2+ concentrations indicates that the lipid
stabilizes the open, Ca2+-liganded state of the channel. At saturating Ca2+ concentration, PI(4,5)P2 has
no additional effect.
The Effect of PI(4,5)P2 is Specific and Moderate Affinity.
We compared the effects of two other physiologically important phosphoinositides
(dioctanoyl phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3] and dioctanoyl
phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [diC8-PI(3,5)P2]) (47, 48) on ANO1 currents (Fig. 2). diC8PI(3,4,5)P3, which has one additional phosphate at the 3-position, was less than half as efficacious at

10 µM as diC8-PI(4,5)P2: ANO1 current increased 31 ± 12 % (Fig. 2B,E,G). diC8-PI(3,5)P2, which
has a phosphate in the 3-position instead of the 4-position had no effect at 10 µM (Fig. 2C,F,G). Thus,
the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on ANO1 exhibits specificity.
To estimate the apparent EC50 for PI(4,5)P2, we measured ΔIPIP2 in response to different diC8PI(4,5)P2 concentrations. The data, fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation, gave an EC50 = 1.24 µM
(Fig. 2H) at 100 mV with 270 nM Ca2+. This falls within the range for the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on other
ion channels (0.12 - 4.6 µM, (49-51)). At -100 mV, inward currents were more sensitive to diC8PI(4,5)P2 with EC50 < 0.1 µM (Fig. 2I).
Selection of Potential PI(4,5)P2 Regulatory
Sites.
To identify amino acids that might play a role
in PI(4,5)P2 regulation of ANO1, we mutagenized
amino acids singly or in groups and tested whether
stimulation of ANO1 currents in excised patches by
diC8-PI(4,5)P2 was altered. We focused on basic
amino acids because known PI(4,5)P2 binding sites
contain two or more positively charged amino acids
(38, 52). There are 62 Lys and 60 Arg residues in
mouse ANO1. To narrow candidate residues for
mutagenesis, we identified Lys and Arg residues
located within 10 Å of the cytoplasmic membrane

cytoplasmic N-terminus: K71, R72, R81, and R82 because
they are predicted to constitute a phospholipid binding
site by BHSEARCH (53), and K124, R125, R127, and
R128 because they align partly with a region that
ostensibly forms a PI(4,5)P2 binding site (54, 55) in the
ANO1 paralog ANO6 (amino acids 93 – 100) (54, 55)
(Fig. 3A).
Mutagenesis to Identify PI(4,5)P2 Regulatory Sites.
We neutralized the charge on selected Arg and
Lys residues by replacement with Gln. Surprisingly, more
than 20 mutants were found to have a statistically
significant reduction in response to diC8-PI(4,5)P2
compared to WT. For WT ANO1, ΔIPIP2 = 89.9 ± 16.8%
(n = 13) in this set of experiments. ΔIPIP2 for “significant”
mutants was <40% (p < 0.05, Fig. 3B orange and red

In order to gain more insight into the binding
of PI(4,5)P2 t o ANO1, we performed molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations using the highly mobile
membrane mimetic model (HMMM) (54,59). The
HMMM model was introduced to accelerate lipid
diffusion in atomistic MD simulations in order to
obtain significantly enhanced sampling of interaction
of lipid headgroups with proteins within simulation
timescales currently achievable. In conventional
membrane models, lipids with long acyl chains have a
relatively low lateral diffusion constant (∼8 × 10−8 cm2
s−1). Therefore, during a 500 ns simulation, lipids do
not diffuse far enough to allow sufficient mixing

TM3, TM4, TM6, and TM10 (Fig. 6A).
PI(4,5)P2 binding to these sites was observed in multiple independent trajectories and for both
subunits of ANO1 (Fig. 6B), revealing several specific and stable interactions between PI(4,5)P2 and
the protein. Sites 6–8, which bind PI(4,5)P2 only transiently, mainly involve residues from the Nterminal region of ANO1, including the short α-helices α0a and α0b and the loop preceding them,
and the loop between Nβ1 and Nα1. Among the eight sites captured in the simulations, Sites 1, 2, and
4 showed the highest occupancies (Fig. 6C). These three sites represent 84.3% of all the binding events
observed. PI(4,5)P2 headgroups are well coordinated in these binding sites, resulting in residence

lifetimes as long as 116.5 ns (Fig. 6D). Because PI(4,5)P2 binding to Sites 1, 2, and 4 was more robust
than binding to the other sites, we focused on these three sites for further analysis.
Insight Into the Functional Roles of Specific Key Amino Acids. In Site 1, five basic
residues (R433, K430, R429, R437, and K313, Fig. 7A,D), which stabilize the binding of PI(4,5)P2 by
coordinating the inositol ring and its phosphates. All of these residues are experimentally verified to
strongly affect PI(4,5)P2 binding (Fig. 3B). Of the four residues that coordinate PI(4,5)P2 for >10% of
the total residence time in Site 1, K430 shows strong preference for interaction with the hydroxyl
groups on the inositol ring, while the other three basic residues mainly coordinate 4’- and 5’-phosphate
groups. R437 is located closer to the cytoplasm than the other residues and interacts almost exclusively
with the 4’- and 5’-phosphate groups. This feature suggests that R437 might be crucial for specific
recognition of PI(4,5)P2. Experimentally, the R437Q mutation totally abolishes the PI(4,5)P2-induced
effect. Similarly, in Site 2 (Fig. 7B,E), all the residues facing the cytoplasm including those in the
cytoplasmic loop connecting TM6 and TM7 (R677, R683, K682, K684) and R665 in TM6 are mainly
involved in coordinating the 4’- and 5’-phosphate groups. The other residues in TM6 show less
discrimination and also interact with the 1’-phosphate and hydroxyl groups on the inositol ring. In
Site 4 (Fig. 7C,F), all major
interacting residues show
preference for 4’- and 5’phosphate groups except
for
R484,
which
indiscriminately coordinates
all the functional groups on
the inositol ring.

placement of the lipids. On average, the number of bound PI(4,5)P2 molecules over the trajectories
was reduced ~20% from 2.73 ± 1.28 to 2.21 ± 1.45 (per monomer), which was not statistically
significant. In these simulations, PI(4,5)P2 interacted with 42 residues. We analyzed whether the
PI(4,5)P2 coordination probability was different for these 42 residues in simulations with and without
PtdSer and found that they were not statistically different (one way ANOVA, p>0.1). In contrast,
PtdSer binding to these sites was significantly different than PI(4,5)P2 in the same simulations (p
<0.001). In these simulations, the PtdSer headgroup only interacted with seven residues with
significant probability (>0.01). Two residues are in Site 1 (R429: 0.09; R433: 0.06), one in Site 2 (R670:
0.02), two in Site 4 (R461: 0.02, K465: 0.01), and two others near Site 4 (R486: 0.04, K469: 0.01).
These data suggest that although PtdSer may also bind to these sites, PI(4,5)P2 has a higher probability
of interaction.
Potential Conformational Changes Induced by PI(4,5)P2. To determine whether binding
of PI(4,5)P2 was influenced by full-length acyl chains, the short-tailed lipid molecules (C6-PI(4,5)P2
and C6-POPC) used in the initial probing of lipid-protein interactions were converted back to fulllength lipids (palmitoyl-oleoyl-PI(4,5)P2 and palmitoyl-oleoyl-POPC) at the end of the HMMM
simulations, and the resulting full systems were subjected to an additional equilibrium simulation of
600 ns. During these simulations with full-length lipid, each bound PI(4,5)P2 molecule remained
coordinated around its binding site, suggesting that these sites stably bind full-length PI(4,5)P2. In the
HMMM simulations, the PI(4,5)P2 molecules were more likely to dissociate from their binding sites
and sample more binding events.
We compared the conformation of the PI(4,5)P2-bound ANO1 with its conformation in a
control simulation performed in the absence of PI(4,5)P2. The most significant change captured in the
simulations with PI(4,5)P2 bound is a rotation of the cytoplasmic half of TM6, which forms one side
of the channel pore and plays a key role in channel gating (Fig. 8A,B). The position of the cytoplasmic
portion of TM6 is described by two angles. α is the angle of TM6 projected onto the x-y plane with
the position in the cryo-EM structure defined as 0o. β is the angle of TM6 relative to the x-y plane. In
the absence of PI(4,5)P2, the cytoplasmic end of TM6 fluctuates only slightly around its initial position
(peak α = 0o, peak β = 36o). When any site is occupied at Sites 2/4, or single occupancy at Site 1, there
is a significant shift of TM6 away from the pore (peak α = 12o – 18o, peak β = 22o). When Site 1 plus
Site 2 and/or 4 are occupied, there is an even more dramatic rotation of the cytoplasmic end of TM6
away from the pore (peak α = 18o – 32o, peak β = 22o).
When PI(4,5)P2 was bound, penetration of Cl- ions into the pore was frequently observed (Fig.
8C). Especially in the case of the multi-occupied simulations (sites 1 and 2/4), deep penetration of Cloccurred ~25% of the total time. The major Cl--coordinating amino acids were K588, K645, N650,
and Q646. S592 also participated when Cl- entered more deeply. Although we had hoped to observe
Cl- ions transiting the entire conduction pathway, this did not happen in the timeframe of our

simulations. However, these simulations were performed with no applied voltage. Without driving
force for Cl- movement, ion conduction may be too slow to capture in this 600 ns simulation. Further,
the voltage-dependent gating of ANO1 was not activated, so the conditions for the protein entering
a conducting state may be sub-optimal. The cryo-EM model of ANO1 we used for these simulations
is a non-conducting state with a constriction in the pore between 6 and 11 Å formed by the bulky
residue Y514 and three nearby residues (S517, V543, and Q637). When multiple PI(4,5)P2 sites are
occupied (site 1 and 2/4), we observed that the conduction pathway dilated ~30% to a radius of 1.2
Å (Fig. 8D,E), which is slightly greater than the radius of a water molecule (1.15 Å), but is smaller than

a Cl- ion (1.8 Å). Thus, forces that stabilize this non-conducting conformation are apparently
sufficiently strong to prevent pore opening in the timeframe of these simulations.
Discussion
Correspondence between Mutagenesis and MD Predictions. In this study, we used
mutagenesis and computational modeling to identify lipid-binding sites in ANO1 that are important
in regulation of the channel by PI(4,5)P2. Sites 1, 2, and 4 predicted by MD simulations to capture 84%
of all interactions between ANO1 and PI(4,5)P2 correspond topographically to Sites A, B, and C
determined by mutagenesis. In further commentary, these sites are referred to as Sites A/1, B/2, and
C/4.
Both the mutagenesis and computational approaches have their limitations. Mutagenesis
experiments can identify sites that are important in functionally mediating the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on
ANO1, but this approach cannot easily distinguish between amino acids that coordinate PI(4,5)P2
binding, stabilize the structure of the binding site, or allosterically couple PI(4,5)P2 binding to channel
gating or ion permeation. Furthermore, it should be noted that amino acids critical for the PI(4,5)P2
effect were identified under very specific recording conditions of 270 nM Ca2+ and 100 mV. Given
the sensitivity of the PI(4,5)P2 effect to both voltage and Ca2+, it is entirely possible that under different
conditions where ANO1 occupies different conformational states, a different complement of amino
acids may be involved in mediating PI(4,5)P2 binding and effect. The MD simulations provide direct
information about amino acids that are energetically favorable for binding PI(4,5)P2, but suffer from
incomplete knowledge about native ANO1 and membrane structure in living cells. Furthermore, the
MD simulations were not performed under identical conditions as the live-cell patch clamp
experiments. For example, no voltage was applied during the MD simulations and there was no free
Ca2+ present in the system. While the correspondence between the functional live-cell experiments
and the MD simulations is not perfect, the global agreement is remarkable. This provides a high level
of confidence that these sites are involved in PI(4,5)P2 binding.
Site A/1 is the most robust site we have identified with all the same amino acids identified in
mutagenesis and MD (Table I). Mutation of a single amino acid (R429, K430, R437, or K313) in this
site nearly abolishes the effect of PI(4,5)P2. The MD simulation shows the headgroup of PI(4,5)P2 is
well-coordinated by a pocket formed by R429, K430, and R437 on one side and K313, Y314, and
Q340 on the other sides (Fig. 7D). The site fulfils the requirements for a canonical PI(4,5)P2 binding
site by having at least one Lys (K430) and one aromatic amino acid (Y314).
A close agreement also exists between the MD and functional studies for Site B/2 (Table I).
By both MD and mutagenesis, Site B/2 is composed of at least six basic amino acids, only one of
which (R683) is essential for the PI(4,5)P2 effect. Mutation of each of the other amino acids has a
partial effect, but this agrees with the modest probability of each of these amino acids coordinating

PI(4,5)P2. Site B/2 also resembles a bona-fide PI(4,5)P2 binding pocket (aromatic Y666 and Lys K684)
(Fig. 7E).
Site C/4 has both Lys and aromatic residues but does not form a pocket and may be an
electrostatic CALM-type PI(4,5)P2 binding site (Fig. 7F). Mutation of K480 abolishes the response to
PI(4,5)P2, and mutation of R461 and R484 have a significant effect. However, mutation of the other
three basic residues identified by MD has no effect.
In addition to these 3 major sites, mutagenesis identified several amino acids outside these
sites. We suspect that some of these amino acids may play structural or allosteric roles. R579 makes a
hydrogen bond with E568 in the loop between TM4 and TM5, which are important in forming the
conduction pathway. R747 forms hydrogen bonds with L693 and E694 (L693:O-K747:NE and
E694:O-K747:N), which lock the cytoplasmic ends of TM7 and TM8. This may be important in
maintaining a proper conformation of Site B/2 (K682, R683, and R684) to interact with PI(4,5)P2.
Mutation of R125 and its adjacent amino acids in the N-terminus significantly affect PI(4,5)P2 binding,
but interpretation is hampered because the N-terminus is not modeled well in the cryo-EM structures
(see below).
Role of the N-terminus. It has been reported that ANO6, a paralog of ANO1 with 54%
sequence similarity, is regulated by PI(4,5)P2 binding to the N-terminus (54, 55). Ye et al. (55) showed
that mutation of amino acids K87, K88, K95, R96, K97, and R98 decreases the Ca2+-sensitivity and
reduces the ability of exogenously-applied PI(4,5)P2 to restore ANO6 current after rundown. ANO6
residues 95-KRKR-98 align in PROMAL3D with ANO1 residues 124-KRFRR-128, and alignment of
the ANO1 (5oyb) and ANO6 (6qp6) structures shows these sequences are similarly located in the
protein structure. Although we find that mutation of these residues in ANO1 decreases the
responsiveness to PI(4,5)P2, the N-terminus is not well resolved in the ANO1 structure, and amino
acids 1-116 and 131-164 are not modeled. Thus, it remains unclear how these amino acids contribute
to ANO1 regulation. Also, the role of these amino acids in ANO6 remains in question because Aoun
et al. (54) showed that deletion or mutagenesis of this site in ANO6 had no effect on PI(4,5)P2 binding.
Rather, they propose that amino acids 302-KKQPLDLIRK-311 in the proximal N-terminus of ANO6
are important for PI(4,5)P2 binding. This sequence aligns well with 313-KKQPLDLIRK-322 in
ANO1, and we find that mutation of K313 in ANO1 significantly reduces the stimulatory effect of
PI(4,5)P2 on ANO1 current. K313 is located in a re-entrant membrane loop just before TM1 in both
ANO1 and ANO6 structures and is a crucial residue in Site A/1.
A Network of PI(4,5)P2 Binding Sites. A major question raised by this study is “Why does
ANO1 have multiple PI(4,5)P2 binding sites and what are their functions?” Most studies on PI(4,5)P2protein interaction generally assume that the effect of PI(4,5)P2 is mediated by a single binding site.
However, there are several examples of proteins interacting with PI(4,5)P2 in different ways. For

example, X-ray crystallography, coarse-grained MD, and reconstitution in artificial membranes have
demonstrated that the Arf GTPase and its GEF Brag2 form a complex that binds to the membrane
via multiple PI(4,5)P2 interaction sites (65). There is also some mutational and biochemical evidence
for multiple PI(4,5)P2 binding sites on profilin-1, gelsolin, TRPV1, EAG1, and Kir2.1 (66-70).
We anticipate that the three PI(4,5)P2 binding sites in ANO1 may have different and/or
interacting effects. Although considerable work will be required to dissect these functional
consequences, at this point in time we propose a general model for ANO1 gating that involves the
binding of Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 to regulate this complex channel (Fig. 9). One corollary conclusion of
Figure 9. Cartoon model of ANO1 gating. TM2
(blue), TM3 (cyan), TM4 (green), TM5 (wheat),
TM6 (red), and TM7 (yellow) are shown as
cylinders. The pore is formed by TM4-TM7 and
Ca2+ (magenta spheres) binds to residues in TM6
and TM7. When PI(4,5)P2 (purple sphere with tails)
binds to the cytoplasmic ends of TM2 (Site A/1),
TM6 (Site B/2), and TM3 (Site C/4), the
cytoplasmic end of TM6 swings away from the pore
to ultimately open the cytoplasmic vestibule to Cl(green spheres). Top row: the channel is closed in
the absence of Ca2+ and inactivated when two Ca2+
ions are bound in the absence of PI(4,5)P2. Bottom
row: the channel can partly open when one Ca2+
binds in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 but full channel
opening requires both Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2.

this model is that the cryo-EM structures of ANO1 that have been published (22, 23) represent the
inactivated state because the channel does not have PI(4,5)P2 bound.
The locations of the three sites in the protein may provide some insights into their possible
function. Key residues forming Site A/1 are located in TM1, TM2, and the loop between α0a and α0b.
Because TM1 and TM2 are tightly packed against TM7 and TM8 that harbor part of the Ca2+ binding
site, PI(4,5)P2 binding to Site A/1 could have widespread allosteric effects on Ca2+ sensitivity and
could be responsible for stabilizing the Ca2+-bound open state. Site B/2 is formed by amino acids at
the cytoplasmic end of TM6 and intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) connecting TM6 and TM7. TM6 plays a
crucial role in ANO1 gating (24, 25, 30) so that its conformational changes could alter channel gating.
Also, TM6 and TM7 harbor three amino acids that form the binding site for Ca2+, so PI(4,5)P2 binding
to this site could also affect Ca2+-dependent gating. Site C/4 is located at the cytoplasmic end of TM3
in the loop connecting TM3 and TM2. TM3 is tightly packed with TM4 that lines the conduction
pathway, so binding of PI(4,5)P2 to Site C/4 could modify the ion conduction pathway.

Methods
Cell Culture and Transfection. HEK-293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in modified
DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) and transiently
transfected with mTMEM16A (Uniprot Q8BHY3). HEK293 cells were authenticated by short
tandem repeat profiling and were tested for myoplasm contamination. TMEM16A was tagged on the
C-terminus with EGFP. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to generate single amino acid mutations.
Mutations were verified by sequencing.
Phosphatidylinositols and Inositol Phosphates. Phosphatidylinositols were purchased
from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). Unless noted otherwise, the synthetic lipids
used in these experiments have C8 saturated fatty acid chains. At concentrations used here, these short
chain phosphoinositides are likely monodisperse in solution. It has been estimated that the critical
micelle concentration (CMC) for lipids with phosphorylated inositol headgroups is >3 mM (71). Stock
solutions of 10 mM PI(4,5)P2 were made in deionized H2O and stored at -20oC. Working solutions
were made fresh immediately before the experiment.
Preparation of the ANO1 Structure for Simulation. The cryo-EM structure of mouse
TMEM16A (PDB 5OYB) at 3.75 Å resolution (72) was used as the starting structure for the MD
simulations. Nomenclature of alpha-helices is from ref. (72). Because amino acids 1-116 (N-terminus),
131-164 (N-terminus), 260-266 (N-terminus), 467-487 (TM2-TM3 linker), 669-682 (TM6-TM7 linker),
and 911-end (C-terminus) are unstructured in the cryo-EM model, we used a model in which the
TM2-TM3 and TM6-TM7 linkers and N-terminal residues 131-164 and 260-266 were added using
SuperLooper2 (73) and subjected to energy minimization. The two Ca2+ ions bound in each of the
two subunits were preserved for all the simulations. The pKa of each ionizable residue was estimated
using PROPKA (74, 75) and default protonation states were assigned based on the pKa analysis.
Missing hydrogen atoms were added using PSFGEN in VMD (76). Internal water molecules were
placed in energetically favorable positions within the protein using DOWSER (77, 78).
Simulation System Setup. The ANO1 protein was first embedded in a palmitoyl-oleolyl
phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer generated using the CHARMM-GUI membrane builder (79). In
each of the six independent simulation systems (Simu 1 – Simu 6), eight PI(4,5)P2 molecules were
evenly placed around the protein in the inner leaflet of the membrane (~1.4% PI(4,5)P2) (Fig. 5A).
PI(4,5)P2 molecules were parameterized using CHARMM36 parameters. Considering the possible
protonation states of PI(4,5)P2, two variations of PI(4,5)P2 headgroups were used in the simulations:
systems 1–3 used palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate with protonation on P4,
while systems 4–6 used the palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate with protonation
on P5. The initial positions of the PI(4,5)P2 molecules were at least 30 Å away from any atom of the
channel. The membrane was then converted to a highly mobile membrane memetic (HMMM) model
using in-house scripts. This model replaces a portion of the membrane hydrophobic core by a more
fluid representation using simple carbon solvent ethane (SCSE), while using short-tailed lipids to

maintain full description of the headgroups and the initial part of the tails. The membrane/protein
systems were fully solvated with TIP3P water (80) and buffered in 150 mM NaCl to keep the system
neutral. The resulting systems consisting of ~575,000 atoms were contained in a 244×180×141 Å3
simulation box.
To evaluate the specificity of PI(4,5)P2 binding to the channel, an additional set of simulations
(3 trajectories, 350-ns each) were performed with 8 PtdSer molecules evenly placed around the protein
in the inner leaflet of the membrane, in addition to the 8 PI(4,5)P2 molecules. Each simulation of
mixed PI(4,5)P2 and PtdSer has a different initial placement of the lipids. The simulation setup was
otherwise the same as described above.
Simulation Protocols. MD simulations were carried out with NAMD2.12 (81) using
CHARMM36m force field (82) and a timestep of 2 fs. Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were used
throughout the simulations. To evaluate long-range electrostatic interactions without truncation, the
particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (83) was used. A smoothing function was employed for shortrange non-bonded van der Waals forces starting at a distance of 10 Å with a cutoff of 12 Å. Bonded
interactions and short-range non-bonded interactions were calculated every 2 fs. Pairs of atoms whose
interactions were evaluated were searched and updated every 20 fs. A cutoff (13.5 Å) slightly longer
than the non-bonded cutoff was applied to search for interacting atom pairs. Simulation systems were
subjected to Langevin dynamics and the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method (84, 85) to maintain
constant pressure (P=1 atm) and temperature (T=310 K) (NPT ensemble). To allow the simulation
systems to fluctuate in all dimensions, in pressure control, a constant ratio was used for both HMMM
and full-length simulations. This parameter keeps the x:y ratio of the unit cell constant rather than
keeping the dimensions of the unit cell constant, thus allowing the surface area of the membrane to
fluctuate during the simulation.
HMMM Simulations. Because the HMMM representation simplifies the lipid bilayer by
making the core more fluid, grid forces were applied on the carbon atoms affected by the conversion
from the full-length membrane to the HMMM model to restrain the HMMM lipids, in order to
resemble the full-length membrane while still allowing lipid molecules to fluctuate. The target atoms
affected by the grid forces included carbon atoms in the solvent SCSE molecules and the terminal
carbons (C26 and C36) of the short-tailed POPC and POPI lipids. The aim was to make the positions
(z-coordinates) and flexibility of these target atoms resemble their counterparts in full-length
membrane. To realize this, 3D grids with 1-Å spacing were specified in the simulation box to define
the potential to be applied. Different potential values were then assigned to each grid point depending
on the z-position within the membrane (centered at z=0). The grid potential 𝑈𝑈𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 (𝑧𝑧) is defined by

where 𝑘𝑘 = 0.025 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚∙𝐴𝐴2, 𝑧𝑧𝑐𝑐 = 10 Å, and 𝑧𝑧 denotes the z-position of the grid point. For each target

atom within the grid, the force was computed by a tri-cubic interpolation of the potential from the
surrounding grid values based on the z-position of the atom. The target atoms thus experience zero
or close-to-zero force when they are in the region comparable to that of their counterparts in the fulllength membrane (z within ±10 Å); increasing force is experienced when they are diffusing toward
the headgroup/bulk-solvent region (z beyond ±10 Å). Since only the terminal carbon atoms (C26 and
C36) in the short-tail lipids are affected by the grid forces, this method provides the majority part of
the molecules, especially the headgroups, with considerable flexibility in all dimensions during the
simulation.
To verify that the HMMM simulations were providing a reasonable model of bilayer, we
compared the dynamics of the phospholipids in a simulation of TMEM16A in full-length membrane
(600 ns, no restraint) with the HMMM model used here (500 ns). The fluctuations of the cholinenitrogen atoms or phosphate atoms of POPC headgroups in the z-axis were used as metrics. In the
HMMM simulations, the z-positions of the choline nitrogens within 10 Å of the protein fluctuate up
to 10-10.5 Å in each direction, and phosphorus atoms can fluctuate 9-9.5 Å. The capacity for
fluctuation of the headgroup components shows that the model used in this study provides sufficient
freedom for the HMMM membrane mimetics to behave similarly to a full-length membrane (56, 64).
The six HMMM simulation systems were first energy-minimized for 10,000 steps followed by
a 1-ns relaxation MD, during which the heavy atoms from the protein were positionally restrained
(k=1 kcal/mol/Å2) to allow the de novo added structures to relax. Then a 500-ns equilibrium simulation
was performed for each system with the Cα atoms of the transmembrane region (estimated using the
PPM server) slightly restrained (k=0.1 kcal/mol/Å2). Our published data showed that using SCSE
solvent can greatly improve the behavior of transmembrane proteins within the HMMM model (56).
SCSE showed substantially less solvent intercalation into transmembrane proteins compared to
DCLE and SCSM solvents in absence of restraint on the proteins (64). Nevertheless, to prevent any
potential disruption of the transmembrane structure, we applied a slight restraint on the C-alpha atoms
of the transmembrane region of TMEM16A. The rest of the protein (sidechains of the transmembrane
region and the backbone atoms and sidechains of the cytoplasmic and extracellular regions) was free
to move. Such restraint is not likely to affect the sampling of lipid-protein interactions because the
transmembrane region of the channel does not move much during unrestrained simulations. We
compared the dynamics of the protein in the HMMM simulations with the ones in normal membranes
without restraint. The transmembrane region is stable and does not move much for either simulation
(average heavy atom RMSD was 1.57 Å for HMMM vs 2.00 Å for full-length). The RMSD for the
transmembrane region in full-length membranes over the measured time scale (600 ns) is only ~0.43
Å larger than the HMMM simulations (500 ns). In comparison, the average heavy atom RMSD for
the entire protein is 7.01 Å for HMMM simulations and 8.67 Å for full-length simulations, meaning

that most of the flexibility of the protein originates from the dynamics of the cytoplasmic and
extracellular domains. Based on this observation, we conclude that the slight restraint on the protein
will not affect results of the simulations.
Full-length Simulations. To investigate protein conformational changes upon PI(4,5)P2
binding, the PI(4,5)P2-bound HMMM systems were converted back to full-length phospholipids,
followed by an additional 600-ns simulation without any restraints on the protein. A control simulation
in the absence of PI(4,5)P2 molecules was also performed using the same protocol.
Analysis of Lipid-protein Interactions. To characterize the interaction of lipid headgroups
with potential binding sites on the protein, occupancy maps of the inositol group (and its phosphate
groups) over the trajectories were calculated using the Volmap plugin in VMD (68). To determine the
residues at those sites that stabilize PI(4,5)P2 binding, the polar interactions between the residues (sidechain nitrogen/oxygen atoms) and the PI(4,5)P2 inositol ring (phosphate/hydroxyl groups) in the
binding site were calculated for each frame of the trajectory using a distance cutoff of 4 Å for
phosphorus atoms of the phosphates and 3.5 Å for oxygen atoms of the hydroxyls.
Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed using Origin 2017 SR2. Error bars are standard
error of the mean. Statistics are described in each figure.
