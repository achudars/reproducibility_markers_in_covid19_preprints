Abstract
While advancements in genome sequencing have identified millions of somatic
mutations in cancer, their functional impact is poorly understood.

We previously

developed the expression-based variant impact phenotyping (eVIP) method to use gene
expression data to characterize the function of gene variants. The eVIP method uses a
decision tree-based algorithm to predict the functional impact of somatic variants by
comparing gene expression signatures induced by introduction of wild-type versus mutant
cDNAs in cell lines. The method distinguishes between variants that are gain-of-function,
loss-of-function, change-of-function, or neutral. We present eVIP2, software that allows
for pathway analysis (eVIP Pathways) and usage with RNA-seq data. To demonstrate the
eVIP2 software and approach, we characterized two recurrent frameshift variants in
RNF43, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, frequently mutated in colorectal, gastric
and endometrial cancer. RNF43 WT, RNF43 R117fs, RNF43 G659fs, or GFP control
cDNA were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Analysis with eVIP2 predicted that the
frameshift at position 117 was a loss-of-function mutation, as expected. The second
frameshift at position 659, was, surprisingly, predicted to be a gain-of-function mutation.
Additional eVIP Pathways analysis of RNF43 G659fs predicted 10 pathways to be
significantly altered, including TNF alpha via NFKB signaling, KRAS signaling, and
hypoxia. To validate these predictions, we performed reporter assays and found that all
eVIP2 impactful pathways tested in the assay were activated by expression of RNF43
G659fs, but not by expression of RNF43 WT, supporting that RNF43 G659fs is a gain-offunction mutation and its effect on the identified pathways. The eVIP2 method is an
important step towards overcoming the current challenge of variant interpretation in the

Introduction
While advancements in genome sequencing have identified millions of somatic
mutations in cancer [1–3], interpretation of these variants remains a major challenge to
the implementation of precision medicine. Distinct assays are generally used to determine
mutation impact for each individual gene being studied, slowing down the process of
variant interpretation. Previously, no single assay could rapidly profile the functional
impact of a diverse set of genes. Earlier studies demonstrated the feasibility of using gene
expression signatures as “fingerprints” of molecular function [4].
In Berger et al., we presented the expression-based variant-impact phenotyping
(eVIP) method that uses gene expression changes to distinguish impactful from neutral
somatic mutations [5]. This study used the L1000 assay, which measures the abundance
of 978 “landmark” genes [6]. eVIP was used to characterize 194 somatic mutations in 53
genes identified in primary lung adenocarcinomas, demonstrating the value of systematic
functional interpretation of variants using gene expression data.
Here, we present advancements in the eVIP approach and software, called eVIP2.
eVIP2 includes a more automated pipeline and improvements in user-friendliness. Also,
we use the eVIP2 method with RNA-seq data, which provides a better view of the full
transcriptome than L1000 data and is more widely used. In addition to functional
predictions on the overall effect of each variant, we also include an approach called eVIP
Pathways to predict the functional impact on specific cellular signaling pathways. We
recommend using eVIP Pathways with RNA-Seq data.

We show that eVIP2 can be used to characterize variants of unknown function
and identify their downstream effect on cellular signaling pathways.

Design and Implementation
Algorithm for expression-based variant impact phenotyping
The eVIP approach assumes that the underlying expression data were derived
from cell line experiments from overexpression of WT cDNA, mutant cDNA(s), and control
cDNA(s) (Fig 1A). The eVIP method uses a decision tree-based algorithm that determines
the functional impact of a mutation by comparing gene expression signatures induced by
wild-type and mutant ORFs (Fig 1B). The two features of gene expression changes that
eVIP uses are signal strength and signature identity. The signal strength is a quantitative
measure of replicate consistency (WT vs. WT or variant vs. variant). The signature identity
is found by calculating the correlation between the transcripts in the wild-type signature
and those in the mutant signature (WT vs. variant).

(A) Overview of experimental approach (B) Schematic of the eVIP decision tree-based eVIP algorithm. The impact
test is a Kruskal-Wallis test of the three distributions: wild-type replicate self-correlation, mutant replicate selfcorrelation, and wild-type versus mutant correlation. It outputs a Bonferonni-adjusted p-value, which represents the
likelihood of mutation impact. Impactful mutations are then tested for their directional impact. For non- impactful
mutations, a “power test” determines whether the two signatures are similar to one another due to a real signal or due
to noise.(C) Overview of the eVIP2 pipeline which incorporates overall impact and pathway impact. The eVIP2
pipeline uses gene level counts (TPM) to predict the functional impact of a mutation. Many mutations can be
processed in parallel. There is the option for eVIP Pathways, which predicts the impact of each mutation on a
pathway.

At the root of the decision tree, we test the null hypothesis that the mutant signature
and the wild-type signature are indistinguishable, and give the overall impact prediction
p-value for the given variant. This is based on a Kruskal-Wallis test performed on three
distributions: wild-type replicate self-correlation, mutant replicate self-correlation, and
wild-type versus mutant correlation.
When the overall impact p-value is less than 0.05 (with multiple-testing correction),
the variant is impactful. The variant can then be further characterized as a change-offunction (COF), gain-of-function (GOF), or loss-of-function (LOF). A Wilcoxon test is done
to determine if there is no difference in self-replicate correlation between the mutant and
the wild type. If the difference is not significant the variant is a change-of-function. If the
difference is significant, we then look to find the direction of the difference in self-replicate
correlation. When the mutant self-replicate correlation is less than wild-type self-replicate
correlation, it has a negative impact score and it is loss-of-function. When it is greater, it
has a positive impact score and the variant is a gain-of-function.
When the overall impact p-value is greater than 0.05, the variant may have no
impact on gene function or be non-informative. A wilcoxon test is then done by comparing
the wild-type versus mutant replicate correlation distribution to a null distribution. The null
distribution is determined by comparing the mutant signature to control signature(s) and
iterating this comparison 1,000 times. Thus, a variant is predicted to be neutral if the
mutant signature is indistinguishable from wild-type and if the mutant signature is more
similar to wild-type than control signature comparisons.

For overall functional predictions, the eVIP2 software takes in L1000 Z-scores or
RNA-seq gene level transcript per million (TPM) counts (Fig 1C). It is recommended to
filter out genes with low expression and do a log2 transformation. For pathway analysis
with eVIP2, raw Kallisto [7] outputs are required.
Using the log2 TPM counts, eVIP2 calculates Z-scores across the replicates in all
conditions and then reduces the data to a sample by sample self-correlation matrix. It is
recommended to have at least four replicates for each condition. In the original
implementation using L1000 data, a weighted connectivity score was used as a measure
of correlation. Using the large L1000 dataset that tested the impact of 194 somatic
mutations [5], we compared the weighted connectivity score to spearman rank as a
measure of correlation. We found that the corrected p-values from the impact test using
either correlation method were comparable (S1 Fig); therefore, we used spearman rank
correlation for RNA-Seq data. Using the correlation matrix, the described eVIP algorithm
is run to give a prediction of LOF, GOF, COF, Neutral, or non-informative.
In addition to a variant receiving an overall functional impact prediction, with eVIP
Pathways, the user can also determine pathway-specific functional calls, which allows for
more specific functional analysis. eVIP Pathways requires a JSON file representing the
mapping of pathways to their genes. Custom gene sets or curated gene sets from

control using DESeq2 [11]. We define mutation-specific genes as genes that are
differentially expressed only in the control versus mutation and not in the control versus
WT. These genes represent a new function caused by the mutant. The WT-specific genes
are differentially expressed only in the control versus WT and not in the control versus
mutant. These are genes that are expected to be affected by normal WT function, but are
not affected by the mutant, and therefore contribute to mutant loss of function. eVIP
Pathways is then run separately using the WT-specific and mutant-specific genes (with
multiple-testing correction).
The standard approach to understand the function of a mutation is to look at
differentially expressed genes in cells with and without induced expression of the mutant.
We believe that analysis of mutant-specific differentially expressed genes allows a better
discernment of mutation function, by disregarding the preserved effects of the WT gene.

Results
eVIP2 identifies different impacts of two frameshift mutations in RNF43
To demonstrate the utility of the eVIP2 approach, we examined the impact on
RNF43 gene function of its most common mutations, R117fs and G659fs (Fig 2A). RNF43
encodes for a cell surface transmembrane E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a
negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway [12–14]. Recurrent RNF43 mutations are
predicted to create neopeptides [15,16]. Over 18% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and
endometrial carcinomas have RNF43 mutations [17] with p.G659Vfs*41 and
p.R117Afs*41 being

the most common. RNF43 mutations are associated with

microsatellite-instable tumors and are mutually exclusive with inactivating APC mutations
[17].

Wild-type RNF43 and both frameshift mutations were overexpressed in HEK293T
cells, with 4 replicates in each condition, and expression profiling was performed using
RNA-Seq. The overexpression of RNF43 WT, RNF43 R117fs, and RNF43 G659fs, was
confirmed by inspecting the RNA-Seq reads and through Western blot validation (S2 Fig).
The eVIP2 overall impact predicted the RNF43 R117fs variant to cause a loss of function,
which is consistent with the R117fs mutation leading to a premature stop codon early in
the gene, thereby disrupting the majority of the protein (Figs 2 B-C). Interestingly, the
G659fs variant was predicted to cause a gain of function (Figs 2 B-C). The G659fs
frameshift occurs 126 amino acids away from the end of the wild-type gene and the
termination codon in the new reading frame is 41 amino acids away from the frameshift.
Frameshifts that occur late in the gene can often be assumed to be loss-of-function or not
alter wild-type protein function; however the hotspot mutational pattern of G659fs (Fig 2A)
and our eVIP2 overall impact prediction (Figs 2 B-C,S1 File) point to a gain-of-function.

Mutation-specific and WT-specific differentially expressed genes recapitulate
overall LOF and GOF calls
We took advantage of the RNA-seq data and used eVIP Pathway analysis to find
which pathways are impactful in each variant. To further examine the RNF43 frameshift
mutations, we defined “mutation-specific” and “WT-specific” gene sets (Fig 3A). This
allows us to find gene expression changes specific to each frameshift.

The LOF RNF43 R117fs mutation had 263 mutation-specific and 827 WT-specific
differentially expressed genes (S3 Fig). Having more WT-specific genes is consistent with
RNF43 R117fs being a LOF mutation. The GOF RNF43 G659fs mutation had 828
mutation-specific and 494 WT-specific differentially expressed genes, consistent with it
being a GOF mutation (Fig 3B).

eVIP Pathway analysis identifies TNF⍺ via NFKB, KRAS, and hypoxia as the top hallmark
pathways impacted by RNF43 G659fs

Next, we used the eVIP Pathways approach on the predicted RNF43 G659fs GOF
mutation to investigate which specific pathways are impacted, thus giving more
information on what the function of the mutation is. To find pathways impacted by RNF43
G659fs, eVIP Pathways was run separately on the mutation-specific and WT-specific
genes (Fig 3C, S4 Fig). We used the 50 hallmark pathway gene sets from MsigDB, to get
an eVIP2 functional prediction of GOF, LOF, COF, or neutral for each tested pathway.
Due to the smaller number of gene sets, we chose the 50 hallmark pathways over other
databases like KEGG or Reactome for simplicity, but these other gene sets can also be
used with eVIP Pathways. In order for a pathway to be characterized with eVIP Pathways,
a minimum of 10 genes per pathway is required. For RNF43 G659fs 10 of the 50 hallmark
pathways were tested for the mutation-specific genes, however, RNF43 R117fs had no
hallmark pathways with at least 10 mutation-specific genes.
When identifying impacted pathways by RNF43 659fs from WT-specific genes, the
estrogen response late pathway was predicted LOF (S4 Fig, S5 File). Loss of estrogen
receptor beta is seen in malignant colon tissue [18]. The mutation-specific genes had 6
GOF pathways and 4 COF pathways (Fig 3C ,S6 File). “TNF alpha signaling via
NFKappaB” was the most significant pathway and is predicted to be COF. RNF43 has
been linked to positive regulation of NF-κB signaling [19]. The other COF pathways are
“complement”, “hypoxia”, and “glycolysis”, none of which have been previously

associated with RNF43. However, glycolysis has been connected to the Wnt pathway
[20], in which RNF43 is known to act, and hypoxic conditions drive glycolysis [21,22].
RNF43 G659fs GOF pathways are “KRAS signaling up” and “KRAS signaling
down”, “P53 Pathway”, “epithelial mesenchymal transition” (EMT), “IL2 Stat5 signaling”,
and “estrogen response early”. RNF43 G659fs has not been previously known to activate
these pathways; however, WT RNF43 is a known negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway which then regulates the RAS-ERK pathway [23–26].

Reporter assays validate eVIP2 GOF predictions for RNF43 G659fs
To validate the eVIP Pathway predictions for the impact of RNF43 G659fs on
certain pathways, the Cignal 10-Pathway Reporter Array was used to measure the activity
of Wnt, Notch, P53/DNA Damage, Cell Cycle/pRB-E2F, NFκB, Myc/Max, Hypoxia,
MAPK/ERK, and MAPK/JNK signaling pathways (S1 Table, S2 Table) on HEK-293T cells
co-transfected with empty vector, RNF43 WT, or RNF43 G659fs. NFκB, hypoxia,
MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNK signaling pathways were upregulated in the presence of
RNF43 G659fs compared with the control vector, but had no significant differences in
RNF43 WT transfected cells (Table 1, S5 Fig). RNF43 WT appeared more effective at
inhibiting Wnt, consistent with its role as a suppressor of Wnt-signaling [8]. These results
are consistent with the finding that the RNF43 G659fs is a gain-of-function mutation.
Importantly, each of the four impacted pathways (NFκB, Hypoxia, ERK, and JNK) from
the functional validation were identified as impactful with eVIP Pathways. Their matching

The p53 pathway was identified as GOF by eVIP Pathway but was not significant
in the assay when compared to the control vector. A possible explanation for this may be
in overlap between the mutation-specific genes in the p53 pathway and other pathways.
Of the 14 RNF43 G659fs-specific differentially expressed genes in the p53 pathway, nine
of the genes are in multiple pathways. Specifically, five were also in the
“HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB”, “HALLMARK_KRAS_SIGNALING_DN”,
and “HALLMARK_HYPOXIA” pathways.

eVIP Pathways outperforms Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in predicting the three
most significantly activated pathways
We compared eVIP Pathways against the popular tool Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) [27] using the default parameters on unfiltered gene TPM counts, as
recommended. GSEA was run comparing the RNF43 G659fs against WT RNF43,
resulting in no significant pathways (FDR under 0.25). When comparing RNF43 G659fs
against GFP, “TNFalpha via NFKB”, apical surface, estrogen response late, EMT, and
angiogenesis pathways were significantly enriched (Table 1, S7 File). eVIP and GSEA
both identified TNF alpha via NFKB, estrogen late response, and EMT. Though, eVIP
Pathways predicts estrogen late as a LOF pathway, adding additional information over
GSEA. Notably, GSEA failed to identify the three most activated pathways in the
validation assay.
While GSEA and eVIP Pathways both aim to identify biologically meaningful
pathways using gene expression changes, they are answering different questions. eVIP
Pathways finds pathways that are significantly different in the mutation compared to the

WT by incorporating replicate consistency and signature identity. eVIP Pathways looks
for consistent changes with large magnitude and high correlation across replicates. GSEA
looks for pathways that show cumulative changes in gene expression that are associated
with a condition. Whereas eVIP considers each gene set separately, GSEA first ranks all
genes by their expression differences and uses that ranking to calculate enrichment
scores for each gene set. In contrast to eVIP Pathways, in GSEA, genes that are strongly
correlated or anticorrelated with a phenotypic class are given more weight. Our validation
results suggest eVIP Pathways is better at predicting which pathways are specifically
impacted by a mutation; however, additional studies on other genes and gene variants
will need to be performed for a more robust evaluation.

Discussion
Previous work showed that high-throughput expression-based phenotyping can
accurately distinguish between neutral and impactful mutations[5]. eVIP was used to
functionally profile a diverse set of 194 lung adenocarcinoma alleles from 53 genes in a
single assay, addressing the challenge of interpreting the millions of mutations that have
been identified in cancer. An additional strength of the eVIP method is that it can be
applied to any mutation, and does not require prior knowledge of the gene. In this study,
we present the eVIP2 software, demonstrate that eVIP can be used with RNA-seq data
and present eVIP pathway analysis.
Here, we characterize overall and pathway-specific impact of two common
frameshift variants in colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers. Both of the tested
frameshift mutations in RNF43 have been assumed to be loss of function [28]. We show

that the two frameshift mutations actually have different effects on RNF43 gene function.
While RNF43 R117fs was LOF, eVIP2 predicted the RNF43 G659fs variant to be a GOF
mutant (Figs 2B,C).
We validated RNF43 G659fs GOF status through a functional assay, showing the
mutant affects the NFκB via TNF alpha, hypoxia, MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNKpathways ,
which are not affected by the overexpression of WT RNF43. Importantly, the four
pathways differentially affected by RNF43 G659fs in the functional assay were identified
as COF or GOF with eVIP Pathways and also were the most confident eVIP Pathways
predictions. In contrast, GSEA, a common approach to investigate gene sets or pathways
affected by a condition, identified only 1 of the 4 significant pathways from the functional
assay as enriched.
A recent study claims RNF43 G659fs is a passenger mutation, based on its effects
on the Wnt pathway [29]. This is consistent with this study, where we did not find the Wnt
pathway to be impacted by RNF43 G659fs by either eVIP Pathway analysis nor in our
validation. However, Tu et. al. mainly focused on the effect on the mutations involvement
in the Wnt pathway. With eVIP Pathways, we can profile multiple pathways at once, which
is especially helpful when investigating mutations in genes that are not well characterized.
We found that RNF43 G659fs has a functional impact on other pathways and is unlikely
to be a passenger mutation.
The eVIP2 software uses gene expression data from L1000 expression profiling or

software to be more easily run by others to perform similar analyses, thus making this
approach more available for mutation profiling by others in the scientific community.

Availability and future directions
eVIP2 is implemented in Python. The software, instruction manual, tutorial, and
example data are available on GitHub (https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/eVIP2). For
eVIP Pathways, transcript quantification outputs from Kallisto [7] are required as input;
however, any molecular profiling data (e.g. L1000, pre-processed gene expression) can
be used as input for eVIP overall functional predictions. For future versions of the
software, we will test eVIP2 on other molecular profiling such as alternative splicing
signatures to investigate the effects of cancer-associated variants.

Methods
RNF43 variant functional impact prediction
Quadruplicate transfections of GFP, WT RNF43, RNF43 R117fs, and RNF43
G659fs were done in HEK-293T cells and sequenced with NextSeq 500 (75 nucleotide
reads, single end). Supplement Figure 3 showing validation of WT and variant expression
was made using Integrative Genome Viewer [30]. Transcript counts were generated using
Kallisto [7]. The Kallisto index was built from Ensembl release 94 GRCh38 cDNA
transcriptome. Kallisto counts were imported to DESeq2 using tximport and DESeq2 was
run using default parameters [11]. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed in python
with GSEAPy [27].

Western blot analysis
HEK293T cells infected with RNF43 WT, R117fs or G659fs fusion with V5-tag
were harvested in RIPA Buffer (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. #R0278) supplemented by
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. #5871), then resolved by 10% SDSPAGE. Western blot analysis was performed by the standard method. The protein
expression of RNF43 WT and mutants was detected by the primary antibodies anti-V5
Tag (1:5,000, mouse, Monoclonal, Life Technologies, Cat. No. R96025) and anti-β-actin
(1:2,000, rabbit, polyclonal, Cell Signaling, Cat. No. #4970) was used as a loading
control. Goat anti-Mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody were obtained from
Licor and used at 1:15000 dilution. The proteins of interest were visualized using a twocolor Li-COR Odyssey Imager (LI-COR).

L1000 correlation methods comparison
For the comparison of L1000 weighted connectivity score versus spearman
correlation, eVIP was run using default parameters. The plot in Figures S1 uses the
corrected p-value (“wt_mut_rep_vs_wt_mut_conn_c_pval”) from the Kruskal-Wallis Test.

Cignal finder cancer 10-pathway reporter Array
The Cignal pathway reporter assay (SABiosciences/Qiagen, Frederick, MD, USA,
Cat. No. CCA-001L/336821) was performed following the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. Briefly, 4000 cells/well of HEK-293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and allowed to settle overnight in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 before transfection. 100

empty vector constructs were co-transfected into the cells by using Lipofectamine LTX
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). After 48 hours transfection, cells were harvested and
measured the dual-luciferase activities based on Firefly-to-Renilla luminescence ratio
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
