Abstract

22
23

Understanding inter-specific variation in social systems is a major goal of behavioural ecology.

24

Previous comparative studies of mammalian social organisation produced inconsistent results,

25

possibly because they ignored intra-specific variation in social organisation (IVSO). The

26

Artiodactyla have been the focus of many comparative studies as they occupy a wide diversity of

27

habitats and exhibit large variation in life history patterns as well as other potential correlates of

28

social organisation. Here we present the first systematic data on IVSO among Artiodactyla, infer

29

their ancestral social organisation, and test whether habitat, sexual dimorphism, seasonal

30

breeding, and body size predict inter- and intraspecific variation in social organisation. We found

31

data on social organisation for 110 of 226 artiodactyl species, of which 74.5% showed IVSO.

32

Using Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models, the ancestral artiodactyl population was

33

predicted to have a variable social organisation with significantly higher probability (0.77, 95%

34

CI 0.29-1.00) than any non-variable form (i.e. solitary, pair-living, group-living). Greater sexual

35

dimorphism and smaller body size both predicted more IVSO; smaller body size also predicted a

36

higher likelihood of pair-living. Our results challenge the long-held assumption that ancestral

37

Artiodactyla were pair-living and strongly imply that taking IVSO into account is crucial for

38

understanding mammalian social evolution.

1. Introduction

43
44

Animals show remarkable inter-specific variation in social systems [1, 2], and understanding the

45

sources of this diversity is a major goal of behavioural ecology. Social systems are characterized

46

by four components [3, 4]: i) social organisation: the size, sex-age, and kin composition of

47

groups, ii) mating system, iii) social structure: relationships emerging from repeated interactions

48

among individuals, and iv) parental and allo-parental care. These components are interdependent.

49

For example, the number and spatial distribution of individuals characterize their social

50

organisation but also constrain their mating tactics [4].

51
52

There have been numerous comparative analyses of mammalian social organisation [6-8].

53

However, inconsistent results have emerged from these studies for several taxa, including

54

primates and carnivorans. In primates, it has been suggested that pair-living species evolved

55

exclusively from solitary [7] or from both solitary and group-living ancestors [8, 9]. In

56

carnivorans, the long-held hypothesis that social evolution involved transitions in social

57

organisation from a solitary ancestor into more advanced forms of group living [solitary ancestor

58

hypothesis: 10, 11] has been questioned [6].

59
60

These inconsistent results likely occurred for several reasons. First, studies have relied on

61

different datasets, methods of analysis, and conceptual frameworks [3]. In an effort to account

62

for as many species as possible, some studies relied on information from secondary sources and

63

taxonomic inference, such as the untested assumption that members of the same genus share the

64

same social organisation [12]. Other studies used confusing terminology or failed to distinguish

65

between social organisation and mating system [3]. For example, some studies inferred

66

monogamy (mating system) from the observation of male-female pairs (social organisation) [9,

67

13]. To resolve these issues, comparative studies should rely exclusively on data from primary

68

sources, and distinguish social organisation from other social system components.

69
70

Most comparative studies of mammalian social organisation relied on a single trait value for each

71

species, yet social systems can be dynamic [14-16]. Intraspecific variation in social organisation

72

(IVSO) occurs when adults of a species show two or more forms of social organisation [6, 14,

3

73

17]. Variation can also occur in the composition of groups, such that a species may live in

74

different types of groups, e.g., unisex vs. multi-sex groups. In mammals, IVSO has been reported

75

in numerous species from different orders [6, 18-22], transforming our understanding of

76

mammalian social evolution. For example, in carnivorans (Order: Carnivora) and shrews (Order:

77

Euliptophya), it was long believed that the ancestral state was solitary. However, a variable

78

ancestral state was found to be equally likely after taking IVSO into account (Carnivora: [6];

79

Euliptophya: [21]). More broadly, ignoring intraspecific variation can increase statistical type II

80

error rates [23-25] and lead to spurious conclusions about social evolution [17, 26]. Modern

81

comparative methods such as phylogenetic mixed-effects (a.k.a. multilevel) models or

82

measurement-error models [24, 27] can easily incorporate intraspecific variation. Thus,

83

comparative studies should include intraspecific variation in social organisation.

84
85

IVSO may arise, for example, if individuals of both sexes can respond to unpredictable or

86

changing ecological conditions by changing their social tactic [16, 17]. Further, IVSO may vary

87

with body size, which correlates strongly with life-history pace [34] as well as available anti-

88

predator strategies [35]. Intraspecific variation in group size and composition is also expected in

89

seasonal breeders. During the breeding season, reproductive competition can exclude some

90

individuals from groups, thus causing IVSO [36]. Alternatively, relaxed competition during the

91

non-breeding season may allow the formation of larger groups, particularly if grouping has

92

survival benefits [e.g., anti-predator strategies; 18, 37]. Thus, we expect greater variability in

93

social organisation among species occupying a wider range of habitats and among seasonal

94

breeders.

95
96

The order Artiodactyla is well suited for comparative studies of social evolution because its

97

members exhibit both inter- and intraspecific variation in social organisation, occupy a wide

98

diversity of habitat types, and exhibit a range of body sizes, sexual dimorphism, as well as both

99

seasonal and non-seasonal breeding [18, 38]. Habitat heterogeneity and availability of protective

100

cover are associated with interspecific variation in social organisation of many artiodactyls [18].

101

Generally, groups are larger in open areas [18, 39], with solitary species mostly living in dense

102

forests [40]. Group-living and large body size are adaptations to open habitats characterized by

103

high predation risk [41]. Sexual dimorphism in body size and seasonal breeding, common in

104

artiodactyls, are also associated with interspecific variation in social organisation [18]. Most

105

sexually dimorphic species live in unisex groups or as solitary individuals, forming mixed sex

106

groups only in the breeding season [42, 43], [but see 44, 45]. Monomorphic species live alone, in

107

pairs, or mixed sex groups [46]. Sexual dimorphism is also correlated with body size [18]. We

108

therefore expected these factors to influence IVSO.

109
110

We first describe interspecific and intraspecific variation in artiodactyl social organisation, using

111

only data from published studies on wild populations. Our second objective was to infer the

112

ancestral social organisation of artiodactyls. We used a detailed phylogeny and modern

113

comparative methods to evaluate competing hypotheses about artiodactyl social evolution,

114

namely 1) from pair-living to group-living [7] or 2) from IVSO to single types of social

115

organisation [6]. Our third objective was to determine the extent to which habitat, sexual

116

dimorphism, body size and breeding seasonality predict variation in social organisation.

117

Specifically, we predicted that the likelihood of IVSO and the total number of social

118

organisations in a species (i) increase with greater number of habitats, (ii) decrease in open

119

habitats due to predation pressure favoring group-living, (iii) sexually dimorphic than

120

monomorphic species and (iv) are greater in seasonal breeders than non-seasonal breeders.

121
122

2. Methods

123
124

(a) Data collection

125
126

Searches were conducted using Web of Science and Google Scholar to find primary sources

127

reporting social organisation for all 226 extant species of Artiodactyla [47]. The initial search

128

consisted of the scientific name (genus and species) and a keyword (‘social’, ‘herd’, or ‘group’).

129

If no sources were found, a final search used only the scientific name. In Web of Science, search

130

results were refined by selecting three research areas: ‘zoology’, ‘behavioral science’, and

131

‘environmental science/ecology’, and document type ‘article’. Lab-based studies, studies in

132

enclosures smaller than 1,000-hectares, and studies that included manipulation of individuals,

133

groups, or resources were discarded. From the 267 primary sources, we coded the following

134

social organisation(s): 1) Solitary, 2) Pair-living, 3) Sex-specific social organisation 4) Unisex

135

groups, 5) Single female/multi-male, 6) Multi-female/single male, and 7) Multi-female/multi-

136

male (Supplementary Material Table S1).

137
138

(b) Determining variable social organisation

139
140

Variable social organisation was identified when 1) both sexes had more than one form of social

141

organisation in the same population [e.g., solitary and pair-living; 17] or between populations or

142

2) multiple types of groups occurred within the same population or in different populations (e.g.,

143

FFM and FFMM groups). For statistical analyses, overall population-level social organisations

144

were categorized as: 1) Solitary, 2) Pair-living, 3) Sex-specific, 4) Non-variable group-living,

145

and 5) variable, including populations with multiple forms of group-living. We categorized cases

146

where one sex was solitary and the other was in unisex groups as a specific form of social

147

organisation (sex-specific) and cases in which both sexes lived in unisex groups as a form of

148

group-living. Additional details are provided in Supplementary Material S2.

149
150

(c) Predictor variables

151
152

Each species was categorized as either seasonal or non-seasonal breeder [38]. The extent of

153

sexual dimorphism was calculated as the ratio of adult male to female body mass using data

154

reported in Pérez-Barbería & Gordon [38]. Body size was included as mean adult female body

155

mass. Habitat type was derived from the primary source and categorized based on IUCN

156

classification (www.iucn.org) as desert, forest, rocky areas, savanna, grassland, shrubland,

157

wetlands, or artificial.

158
159

(d) Phylogeny

160
161

We used the mammal supertree from Bininda-Emonds et al. [48]. Some species names in the

162

database had to be amended to match the phylogeny as detailed in the accompanying R code. In

163

virtually all cases, a name mismatch could be resolved by finding a pseudonym for that species

164

through www.iucn.org, or by using a sister species that was not included in the database. In one

165

case, two closely-related taxa missing from the supertree (Moschus leucogaster and Moschus

166

cupreus) were proxied by the same sister species (Moschus chrysogaster).

167
168

(e) Statistical analysis

169
170

We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed-effects models, accounting for the multilevel structure of

171

the data (populations nested within species) and the phylogenetic relationships among species

172

[24, 27]. Predictors included sexual dimorphism, female body size, breeding seasonality, and

173

number of habitats. Type of habitat was modeled as a random intercept. All models controlled

174

for research effort by including the number of studies. To control for potential geographical

175

biases continent was included as a random intercept.

176
177

Prior to fitting the model, we estimated the likely ancestral state for body size, sexual

178

dimorphism, and breeding seasonality (see Supplementary Material 3). We then centered body

179

size and sexual dimorphism on these estimated ancestral states and chose the likely ancestral

180

breeding seasonality as the reference category. Consequently, the estimated ancestral social

181

organisation (i.e. the global intercepts of the multilevel models) is contingent on predictors that

182

are also at their likely ancestral state.

183
184

To model the likelihood of several mutually exclusive categorical traits (i.e. different social

185

organisations) and how the likelihood of each trait was affected by other variables we used a

186

multinomial model [52] (see Supplementary Material 3). We highlight any covariates that

187

influence the likelihood of different social organisations, and thus may explain evolutionary

188

transitions from the ancestral state. Additional details are in Supplementary Material 4.

189
190

We fit all models in a Bayesian framework [53] in Stan [54] through the RStan interface [55]

191

using brms v. 2.5.1. [56]. Bayesian estimation produces a posterior probability distribution for

192

each parameter, which can be summarized in various ways; here we report the mean and 95%

193

credible intervals and occasionally the proportion of the posterior that lies above or below a

194

certain value (“PP”). Phylogenetic signal was calculated as the proportion of variance captured

195

by the phylogenetic random effect(s) following [57]. All models converged as assessed with the

potential scale reduction factor (all =<1.01), effective sample sizes (all >500), and by visually

197

examining trace plots of the Markov chains. Details on model fitting can be gleaned from the

198

accompanying R code (available at https://github.com/adrianjaeggi/artiodactyl.socialorg).

3. Results

201
202

We found data on social organisation for 247 populations from 110 of the 226 extant artiodactyl

203

species. The majority of these species showed variation in their social organisation at the species

204

level (74.5%, 82 out of 110). Five species were strictly solitary (4.5%), only one was strictly

205

pair-living (0.9%), one showed sex-specific social organisation (0.9%), and eleven showed only

206

one form of group-living (Table 1). A more detailed breakdown of variable social organisation is

207

available in Supplementary Material Table S5. At the population level, 62% (155/247) of all

208

populations also had variable social organisation. Of the 82 species showing variable social

209

organisation, five (6.1%) showed variation between populations, twenty-nine (35.4%) showed

210

variation within a population, and forty-eight (58.5%) showed variable social organisation both

211

between populations and within a population.

212
213

A summary of the phylogenetic multilevel model is available in the Supplementary Material S6.

214

The intercepts reflect a non-seasonally-breeding species of ancestral body size and sexual

215

dimorphism that lives in only one habitat and was studied once. An ancestral population with

216

these characteristics was predicted to have a variable social organisation with significantly higher

217

probability (0.77, 95% CI 0.29-1.00) than any non-variable form (Figure 1).

218
219

The likelihood of variable social organisation increased with degree of sexual dimorphism (odds

220

ratio for 1SD change = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.16 – 8.94), and decreased as female body mass

221

increased (odds ratio for 1SD change = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16 – 0.80; Figure 2). Pair-living was

222

more likely with lower female body mass (Figure 2). Unsurprisingly, the probability of variable

223

and sex-specific social organisations increased with study effort. No other associations were

224

“significant” at the 95% CI level, but transitions to group-living were likelier with greater sexual

225

dimorphism (PP=0.85) and seasonal breeding (PP=0.87). In terms of habitat type, the prediction

226

of variable social organisation being less likely in open (savanna and native grasslands) than

8

227

closed (forest) habitats was not supported (PP=0.37). Similarly, support for group-living being

228

more likely in open habitats was weak (PP=0.63). The phylogenetic signal in social organisation

229

was weak but greater than 0 (mean = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.05 – 0.48).

230
231

The model for number of social organisations is summarized in Supplementary Materials S5.

232

The predicted number of social organisations for the ancestor of all Artiodactyla was 1.73 (95%

233

CI = 1.19 - 2.41), with no predictor influencing the number of social organisations at the 95% CI

234

level. However, a decrease in number of social organisations with greater mean female body

235

mass was relatively well supported (PP=0.91, consistent with Figure 2A). The prediction of

236

fewer social organisations in open habitats compared to closed ones was again only weakly

237

supported (PP=0.70). The phylogenetic signal was low (mean = 0.13, 95% CI = 1 e-5 – 0.29).

238
239
240

4. Discussion

241

Our dataset revealed that IVSO occurred in 75% of Artiodactyla species. For species showing

242

IVSO, social organisation was variable within 62% of populations. These trends are consistent

243

with previous descriptions of IVSO in artiodactyls [58] and other mammals including Carnivora

244

[27% of species classified as 'flexible'; 6], Eulipotyphla [43.8% of species with data; 21],

245

Rodentia [16, 20], and strepsirrhine primates [60.5% of species with data; 22]. Mounting

246

evidence of extensive IVSO in mammals challenges the common assumption in comparative

247

studies that all species have only one social organisation [7, 59-61]. Failing to account for

248

intraspecific variation will likely result in spurious conclusions about social evolution, slowing

249

theoretical advancement [17, 25]. Using modern phylogenetic methods, we can now easily

250

account for IVSO by analyzing data at the population rather than the species level. Moreover,

251

greater effort should be made to build datasets from high-quality, primary sources rather than

252

relying on secondary sources and taxonomic inference.

253
254

Our results change our understanding of social evolution. Both Jarman [18] and Pérez-Barbería

255

et al. [13] assumed in their early comparative studies that the ancestral artiodactyl was socially

256

monogamous (pair-living) with evolutionary transitions to polygyny and group-living. In

257

contrast, Lukas & Clutton-Brock [7] argued that solitary living was the ancestral condition for

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/603399; this version posted April 10, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

258

most mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla. Contrary to these studies, our analysis estimated

259

the ancestral social organisation to be variable, with possible transitions to both pair-living or

260

group-living depending on body size, or sexual dimorphism and breeding seasonality,

261

respectively (or possible unmeasured variables that cause variation in these factors). Thus, our

262

study supports the argument that IVSO plays an important role in the evolution of mammalian

263

social systems [6, 17].

264
265

Group-living and large body size are possible adaptations for artiodactyls living in open habitats

266

[18, 40, 41] and to reduce predation risk [1]. Positive associations between group size and habitat

267

openness have been observed in artiodactyls [62] and other mammals [e.g., 63]. Thus, we

268

expected reduced IVSO in large bodied, group-living species in open habitats. In support of this

269

hypothesis, both the probability of variable social organisation and the number of social

270

organisations was low for species with large (and with very low) body mass but highest for

271

species of intermediate body mass.

272
273

Contrary to expectations, IVSO did not increase with increasing number of habitat types,

274

suggesting that IVSO is not the result of selection for habitat-specific social organisations.

275

Furthermore, neither the probability of variable social organisation or group-living nor the

276

number of social organisations differed between open (savannas and grasslands) and closed

277

habitats (forests). Ecological conditions, such as the spatiotemporal distribution of food

278

resources as a result of unpredictable and/or variable precipitation and temperature, may have a

279

greater effect than habitat type on the social organisation, as was suggested for artiodactyls [64].

280
281

Reproductive competition changes seasonally in species that breed seasonally which in turn, can

282

lead to greater variation in social organisation [36, 65]. Contrary to this expectation, artiodactyls

283

that breed seasonally did not exhibit greater IVSO than non-seasonal breeders. Seasonal

284

variation in local ecological conditions, such as the spatiotemporal variation in rainfall and food

285

[17] may be more important predictors of IVSO than seasonality of breeding alone. The

286

likelihood of IVSO increased with degree of sexual dimorphism. In polygynous systems, a large

287

percentage of males may not breed [66]. Some males may live with other males in bachelor

288

groups, increasing the prevalence of IVSO. In some species, such as African buffalo (Syncerus

289

caffer) there is a rotation system in which breeding males join herds of breeding females for a

290

period of time [67]. During this time, the males breed and fight, but then re-join bachelor groups

291

to recover from the energetic costs of breeding [67].

292
293

In conclusion, our study demonstrated three major points regarding social evolution: 1) ancestral

294

artiodactyl social organisation was variable and not pair-living, as was long assumed, 2) in

295

artiodactyls, the frequency of IVSO increased with increasing sexual dimorphism and decreased

296

with body size, and 3) taking IVSO into account and using a high-quality dataset significantly

297

changes our understanding of social evolution. Our study should motivate future efforts to

298

understand the importance of IVSO in animal social evolution.
