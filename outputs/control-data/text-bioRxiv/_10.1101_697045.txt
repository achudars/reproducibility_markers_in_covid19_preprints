Abstract

14

Rhythmic activity in the brain fluctuates with behaviour and cognitive state, through a

15

combination of coexisting and interacting frequencies. At large spatial scales such as those

16

studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily

17

from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mecha-

18

nisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of

19

neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them

20

into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine

21

a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical

22

connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a vari-

23

ety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including a 1/f spectral profile, spectral

24

peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the

25

underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g.

26

idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple

27

oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity.

28

We find that increasing the level of sensory or neuromodulatory drive to the thalamus triggers

29

a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops,

30

and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intra-

31

columnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency

32

and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states

33

of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile

34

brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent fre-

35

quencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results

36

provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping

37

intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at

Author Summary

40

One of the most distinctive features of brain activity is that it is highly rhythmic. Devel-

41

oping a better understanding of how these rhythms are generated, and how they can be

42

controlled in clinical applications, is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Here we have

43

developed a computational model that succinctly captures several key aspects of the rhyth-

44

mic brain activity most easily measurable in human subjects. In particular, it provides both

45

a conceptual and a concrete mathematical framework for understanding the well-established

46

experimental observation of antagonism between high- and low-frequency oscillations in hu-

47

man brain recordings. This dynamic has important implications for how we understand the

48

modulation of rhythmic activity in diverse cognitive states relating to arousal, attention, and

49

cognitive processing. As we demonstrate, our model also provides a tool for investigating

50

and improving the use of rhythmic brain stimulation in clinical applications.

Introduction

52

A key characteristic of the fluctuations in extracranial electrical and magnetic fields measured

53

by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), resulting from the

54

collective activity of large numbers of (primarily) cortical neurons, is that they are highly

55

rhythmic. While the physiological origins and cognitive function of these rhythms remains

56

unclear, their features are clearly highly labile: spatial location, frequency, and oscillatory

57

power can vary considerably as a function of behavior, cognitive processes, and disease.

58

This suggests that not only the oscillations themselves, but also their fluctuations over time,

59

space, and cognitive state play a key role in brain function. Moreover, multiple frequencies

60

can coexist and interact, fluctuating in a highly correlated manner[1, 2]. Understanding the

61

mechanisms mediating the coexistence of these rhythms, as well as state-dependent changes

62

in their properties, would yield important insight about how collective neural activity and

63

synchronization phenomena, shaped by both sensory and recurrent inputs, mediate neural

64

communication[3]. ‘State’ here simply refers loosely to gross cognitive/perceptual/neural

65

activity regimes, as for example seen in the difference between low-frequency, high-amplitude

66

oscillations observed at rest, and the relatively higher-frequency activity elicited by focused

67

cognitive tasks. In the present paper we opt for the more neutral terms ‘idling’ and ‘active’

68

(as opposed to ‘rest’ and ‘task’) to indicate these two dynamical regimes. To date only

69

a few models in the literature have sought to explicitly capture transitions between these

70

oscillatory states, and the dependence of certain neural processes on the current state (e.g.

71

[4, 2] ).

72

The majority of neural population models that have been developed to account for the

73

origins of large-scale brain rhythms can be grouped into two broad categories: i) cortical-

74

only and ii) corticothalamic. Cortical-only models typically propose that the oscillatory

75

activity visible in MEG/EEG has its mechanistic origin in interactions between excitatory

76

and inhibitory neurons within a cortical column (e.g. [61, 71, 58]). Corticothalamic models

77

(e.g. [39, 69, 55, 56]) are generally highly similar in overall structure, but differ critically

78

in placing the key excitatory-inhibitory interaction in the thalamus rather than the cortex.

79

These models thus attribute prominent spectral features such as low-frequency oscillations

80

to delayed inhibition in long-range recurrent corticothalamic loops. Given the substantial

81

bodies of empirical data from human and nonhuman physiological recordings supporting

82

each of these two mechanisms, it is highly likely that both play a role in the genesis of large-

83

scale rhythmic activity observed in local field potentials and extracranial electromagnetic

84

fields. Disambiguating the contribution of each to the different features of M/EEG signals,

85

and how they might interact, is a challenging problem, however. Addressing this disconnect

86

is one of the principal aims of the present study.

87

One of the major points of dispute between cortical-only and corticothalamic model

88

types is the alpha rhythm. Alpha frequency (8-12Hz) oscillations are a hallmark pattern of

89

encephalographic activity[5]. They have been linked to a wide variety of cognitive processes

90

such as perception and attention, and their dynamic features (such as power and frequency)

91

are also closely tied to changes in behaviour[6, 7]. Abnormal alpha activity is also involved

92

in many neurological disorders such as depression, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s

93

disease[8, 9, 10]. A broad range of experimental data point to the corticothalamic system as

94

the most likely locus of the dominant alpha-frequency rhythmic activity seen in EEG and

95

MEG[11], as well as the phase relationship between alpha and other faster frequencies. In

96

contrast, gamma frequency oscillations have been robustly tied to intracolumnar excitatory-

97

inhibitory circuit mechanisms and active cortical information processing[12, 13]. It remains

98

an open question, however, how these two types of oscillatory activity (plus associated circuit

99

mechanisms) shape large-scale neural dynamics, functional connectivity, and information

100

integration in a state-dependent fashion.

101

A key experimental direction for investigating the dynamic properties and functional role

102

of neural oscillations is to study the relationship between endogenous activity and responses

103

to electromagnetic stimulation. This is not only critical for understanding the functional

104

role of brain oscillations in general, but also for improving the efficacy of clinical applica-

105

tions of noninvasive brain stimulation, such as in the treatment of depression[14]. Inter-

106

estingly, a confluence of experiments with both intra-cranial and non-invasive stimulation

107

have revealed frequency-specific responses, with low-frequency stimulation decreasing the

108

excitability of stimulated tissue[15], and conversely higher frequency stimulation having the

109

opposite effect[16]. Experiments in primates[17] and rodents[18] have indeed demonstrated

110

that thalamic stimulation can be used to either activate or inactivate cortical networks in

111

a frequency-dependent manner, opening new perspectives on the functional manipulation of

112

cortical dynamics by exogenous signals.

113

To better understand state-dependent changes in oscillatory dynamics, their involvement

114

in inter-area communication, and how they might be controlled by non-invasive stimula-

115

tion, we present in this paper a novel connectome-based neural mass model that combines

116

cortical and corticothalamic circuit mechanisms in a minimal and parsimonious fashion.

117

In the following sections, we first demonstrate that this model accurately reproduces sev-

118

eral key characteristics of measured power spectra and functional connectivity from resting

119

state MEG recordings. We then use the model to study the impact of sensory / neuro-

120

modulatory drive on brain rhythms, and how this serves to switch between low-frequency

121

corticothalamically-driven vs. high-frequency cortically-driven oscillatory regimes. Finally,

122

we show how the model predicts a number of empirical observations in humans and rodents

123

on the relationship between brain state, periodic brain stimulation, rhythmic entrainment of

124

neural activity.

125

Results

126

As detailed in the Methods, our full model consists of a network of 68 interconnected nodes,

127

representing brain regions derived from a commonly used parcellation covering most major

128

cortical structures in the human brain. The dynamics of each node is described by a novel

129

extension of the classic Wilson-Cowan (WC) equations[86], which we refer to as the ‘Cortico-

130

Thalamic Wilson-Cowan’ (CTWC) model. Our primary goal was to investigate how state-

131

dependent inputs mediate changes in brain oscillations within multiple frequency bands, and

132

how these spectral fluctuations shape functional connectivity. To do this, we first considered

133

the behaviour of a single isolated network node corresponding to a individual corticothalamic

134

motif. We then moved on to examining collective dynamics and interactions within the

135

whole-brain network.

136

Alpha rhythms emerge from delayed recurrent cortico-thalamocortical

137

loops

138

In examining the dynamics of our corticothalamic model, we first considered the idling state,

139

which we defined as being a state of minimal thalamic drive (see Methods) and thus reflecting

140

dynamics in the steady state. Consistent with previous work[4], this system produces a

141

robust alpha rhythm with a spectral peak at approximately 10Hz. In this idling regime,

142

the higher frequency peaks in the power spectrum at beta and gamma frequencies reflect

143

harmonics of the fundamental frequency (alpha), and the background trend in the power

144

spectrum follows a roughly 1/f trend, in line with previous reports[39]. As shown in Figure

145

1, this model gives a good fit to empirically measured, regionally-averaged MEG power

146

spectra, with all subjects tested showing R2 >=0.6 or higher, and only minor variations in

147

fitted parameter values. Interestingly, we see in empirical MEG data that there are larger

148

differences in power spectra between subjects than between regions within a given subject

149

(data not shown). This observation supports the modelling strategy of choosing a single set

150

of parameters for each subject, and using those for all regions in the network; as opposed

151

to using regionally varying parameter values. We return to the question of spatially varying

152

spectral power below.

153

Phase transition from low-frequency idling to high-frequency active

154

state

155

Having characterized the dynamics within the idling state and the prevalence of alpha ac-

156

tivity, we next asked how increasing the drive to the thalamic populations (either in one or

157

multiple nodes) would impact the spectral properties of cortical activity. To emulate a task

158

or ’active’ state, we thus increased the drive to the thalamic populations (see Methods) and

159

observed the resulting behaviour.

160

We first studied this systematically for a single isolated node. Figure 2 shows trajectories

161

in the 3-dimensional phase space defined by the state variables ue , ui , and us (represent-

162

ing activity of excitatory cortical, inhibitory cortical, and thalamic specific relay nuclei,

163

respectively), along with time series and power spectra for ue , which we take as a proxy

164

for M/EEG source activity[39, 58]. The top left panel of Figure 2 shows, the system in the

165

idling alpha-dominated regime, which (consistent with Figure 1) is characterized by a clean

166

and highly stereotyped 10Hz limit cycle. The bottom and top right panels of Figure 2 then

167

show how the system’s dynamics and phase space are modified upon raising the static sen-

168

sory/neuromodulatory input or drive parameter Io . We first observe (Figure 2, bottom row)

169

within increasing Io a gradual destabilization of the resting alpha rhythm, and a transfer of

170

oscillatory power from alpha to higher frequencies. This destabilization is characterized in

171

the 3-dimensional phase space by an increase in the number and regularity of short, rapid

172

excursions (‘twists’) within the alpha limit cycle, which in the time series plots appear as

173

nested higher-frequency ‘ripples’ within the 10Hz base oscillation. Eventually, after a bi-

174

furcation point around Io =1.3 is crossed, the system shifts completely to a noisier, low(er)

175

amplitude gamma-frequency limit cycle, with a clear peak in the power spectrum observed

176

at 30Hz. In line with a confluence of empirical studies[40], this high-frequency component

177

of the power spectrum reflects the fast-paced interplay between excitatory and inhibitory

neural populations, and is generated locally within the cortical compartments of each net-

179

work node. Due to the nature of the corticothalamic circuit motif we considered here, this

180

increased thalamic drive also represents an increased engagement of cortical excitatory and

181

inhibitory populations, that are now recruited for active processing of afferent inputs.

Figure 2: CTWC model phase space trajectories. A) Exemplary phase space trajectories for a single corticothalamic unit in the idling (left; teal) and active (right; orange)
regimes. Central 3D plot in each panel shows trajectories in the 3-dimensional phase space
defined by the cortical excitatory (e), cortical inhibitory (i ), and thalamic specific relay (s)
population state variables. Orthogonal 2-dimensional views for each pair of state variables
are shown on the left hand side. Panels above the trajectory figures show corresponding
time series and power spectra for the e variable. The idling state regime (Io =0) is characterized by slow, nonlinear alpha-frequency (8-12Hz) oscillations. Increasing the static
sensory/neuromodulatory thalamic drive (here by setting Io =1.5) induces a phase transition
into the active regime, where neural population activity is dominated by gamma-frequency
(approximately 30Hz) limit cycle dynamics. B) Progression from idling to active regime.
Sub panels show 3D phase plane trajectories, time series, and power spectra for incremental
values of Io between the idling and active states shown in panel A. As the system approaches
the bifurcation point (Io ≈1.4), the gamma attractor begins to manifest as a ‘twist’ in the
alpha limit cycle, which appears in the time series plot as embedded high-frequency ripples on the peak/trough of the oscillation. As Io continues to be increase, eventually the
low-frequency rhythm loses stability and the dynamics switches to a pure gamma oscillation.

Influence of regionally focal sensory / neuromodulatory drive

183

We now extend the observations and insights obtained from the single-node case considered

184

in the previous section to the case of whole-brain network behaviour. Figure 3 shows time

185

series, power spectra, and brain-wide plots of the change (∆) in alpha and gamma power for

186

simulations where Io is modulated focally for a single node (left V1) in the 68-node network.

187

The suppression of alpha power and enhancement of gamma power with increasing drive is

188

clearly evident in the surface plots and lower power spectrum figure in panel A.

189

Functional Connectivity

190

Given the salient differences in oscillatory dynamics observed in the idling and active states,

191

we investigated how these different oscillatory regimes shaped inter-area interactions in a

192

whole-brain network context. To do this, we compared functional connectivity, as measured

193

by amplitude-envelope correlations (AECs) of band-limited power time series, in model-

194

generated time series and empirically measured MEG data.

195

Heuristically, moving from an isolated node to a network of coupled nodes results in two

196

important changes in the ‘environment’ experienced by each node. First, the overall or time-

197

averaged activity level of a given brain region will be higher when there are inputs from other

198

regions than when there are no inputs. Second, depending on the behaviour of the incom-

199

ing signals from other regions, that node may experience periodic or otherwise temporally

200

structured driving inputs. This, in turn, may lead to the emergence of synchronization and

201

collective behaviour throughout the system due to processes of entrainment or resonance,

202

possibly also accompanied by bifurcations. As shown in Figure 4, we found idling and active

203

states in the model to be characterized by quite different functional connectivity profiles.

204

The idling state exhibits relatively weaker and spatially non-specific AEC patterns at both

205

alpha and gamma frequencies. In contrast, as the increased static drive Io pushes the system

206

into the gamma-dominated active state, both alpha- and gamma-frequency AEC matrices

207

increasingly come to display the kind of spatial structure characteristic of empirically mea-

208

sured AEC (as well as by various other M/EEG, fMRI functional connectivity, and indeed

209

anatomical connectivity metrics). Specifically, the active state shows a stronger tendency

210

for spatially nearby regions to show high correlations (as indexed in the AEC matrices by a

211

the ’halo’ of high connectivity values around the leading diagonal), and the classic two-block

212

hemispheric structure with stronger intra- than inter-hemispheric correlations. Interestingly,

213

although the two characteristic frequency regimes within the model are in the alpha- and

214

gamma- ranges, it also captures some properties of AEC outside of these ranges. Figure 5

215

shows empirical vs. simulated AEC for the full range of classic M/EEG frequencies: delta

216

(0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-60Hz). As can

217

be seen, moving from low to high frequencies within the active regime is also accompanied

218

by sparser and more spatially structured correlation patterns. It is important to note here

219

that although our model does well at reproducing both resting-state power spectra (Figure

220

1) and MEG functional connectivity (Figures 4 and 5), the domains in which this success is

221

seen does not entirely overlap. For the power spectrum alone, best fits are achieved at or

222

near ’fully idling’ parameter regime with Io = 0. For AECs, however, best correspondence

223

with MEG data is achieved in the active regime, with Io closer to 1.5. We return to this

224

point in the Discussion.

225

Our findings described thus far have shown that active and idling states are characterized

226

by different spectral signatures, and that functional connectivity is differentially expressed

227

in a frequency-specific way in these two states. Next, we examined the effects of periodic

228

stimulation on ongoing cortical activity. That is, we asked: can the temporal structure

229

neural activity be tuned by exogenous signals in a frequency-specific way?

empirical data, lower frequencies (δ and θ) show less spatial specificity and more tendency
towards random connectivity patterns. Note that the more compressed AEC range in empirical than simulated AEC data is due to the application of orthogonal leakage correction[89]
in analyses of MEG data.

impact functional connectivity, we investigated how exogenous periodic stimulation shapes

233

the power spectrum of the system and engages ongoing oscillations. Numerous studies over

234

the last few decades have used stimulation paradigms of various kinds to access circuit

235

function and interfere with neural communication[42, 43, 44]. One of the most robust findings

236

is that entrainment of ongoing brain oscillation is state-dependent, and that susceptibility

237

to control is tuned by ongoing brain fluctuations - an effect that has also been reproduced

238

with modelling[45, 46] and shown to involve stochastic resonance[47]. Given the ability of

239

our model to switch between different states and express multiple frequencies, we subjected

240

cortical populations to exogenous periodic stimulation and monitored the spectral response.

241

Specifically, we again studied an isolated cortico-thalamo-cortical motif (i.e. a single network

242

node), and computed the peak power and frequency as a function of stimulation intensity and

243

frequency. Through this process, we identified resonances and entrainment regimes (so-called

244

Arnold Tongues) and thus measured the susceptibility of our model to entrainment. While

245

oftentimes confused with one another, resonance refers to the enhancement of power when the

246

stimulation frequency is in the vicinity of the system’s natural frequency, while entrainment,

247

refers to the phase locking of the system’s response to the driving frequency[47]. As shown

248

in Figure 6, idling and active states exhibited significant differences in their responses to

249

stimulation and susceptibility to entrainment. Narrower Arnold Tongues were observed in

250

the idling state compared to the active state, indicating that the suppression of alpha power

251

in the active state facilitates phase locking of intrinsic dynamics with the stimulation signal.

252

Specifically, only high intensity stimulation would provoke a shift in the peak frequency in the

253

idling state. In the active state, the prominent gamma oscillations were easily suppressed and

254

replaced by the frequency of the driving stimulus. This is in line with converging evidence

255

indicating that intrinsic attractors limit the effect of perturbations, while irregular or high

256

frequency content is more malleable[4].

257

Discussion

258

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying state-dependent

259

changes in oscillatory activity at the whole-brain scale, as well as the influence of fluctuations

260

in spectral activity on functional connectivity. We have presented a novel connectome-based

261

neural mass model that combines the two primary rhythmogenic mechanisms typically stud-

262

ied in large-scale brain network modelling: intracolumnar microcircuits and corticothalamic

263

loops. This is an extension of previous work, that studied the behaviour of the basic corti-

264

cothalamic motif in isolation[48]. Here we have embedded this corticothalamic unit into a

265

whole-brain network, with anatomical connectivity derived from diffusion MRI tractography.

Figure 6: Effects of periodic brain stimulation on corticothalamic loop dynamics
Top row: Maximum frequencies displayed by the cortical excitatory population of an isolated
cortico-thalamocortical loop (CTWC model, single node) in response to periodic (sine wave)
stimulation of varying amplitudes (y axes) and frequencies (x axes). In the idling regime,
an Arnold Tongue structure is clearly seen centred on the natural frequency (approximately
10 Hz): As the stimulation frequency moves away from the natural frequency, greater stimulation amplitude is required to achieve entrainment at the stimulation frequency. In the
active regime, a broader and shallower Arnold Tongue structure is again seen, centred on the
natural frequency (this time approximately 30Hz). Compared to the idling state, entrainment at the stimulation frequency is easier to achieve (requires lower amplitude stimulus) in
the active than the idling regime. Bottom row: Maximum amplitudes displayed by cortical
excitatory populations. Here again the amplitude response patterns match quite closely the
Arnold Tongues seen in the maximum frequency responses.

266

Our model reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including

267

a 1/f spectral profile, spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity

268

structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Using this model, we

269

have studied how thalamic drive mediates a shift in oscillatory regime, provoking a tran-

270

sition between alpha and gamma dominance in the power spectrum, and found that these

271

oscillations have a differential impact on functional connectivity patterns. We found that

272

spatially structured inter-area functional connectivity (as measured by band-limited power

273

amplitude envelope correlations), particularly at higher frequencies (gamma, beta, and alpha

274

to a lesser extent), are a hallmark of the active state. To better understand how these state-

275

and frequency-specific dynamics are impacted by exogenous stimulation, we applied cortical

276

periodic stimulation of various amplitudes and frequencies, eliciting endogenous resonances

277

both across the corticothalamic loop and within cortex. Our analysis confirms that, as com-

278

pared to the idling state, the active state is more susceptible to entrainment by exogenous

279

signals, as it shows wider and shallower Arnold Tongues. In contrast, the idling state’s deep

280

and narrow Arnold Tongues indicate that the system has a strong preference for its natu-

281

ral frequency when in this regime, and will respond only to exogenous signals close to that

282

frequency or its harmonics.

283

Relation to previous work

284

The work presented here builds on previous work of several authors in a number of ways.

285

Most directly, the isolated CTWC neural mass model (without the whole-brain white matter

286

connectivity introduced here) was recently introduced in [48]. Previous to that we have also

287

studied resonance behaviour, response to stimulation, and state-dependence in corticothala-

288

mic circuits and generic feedback oscillators[45, 65, 64]. We emphasize however that the core

289

mathematical and conceptual component of the CTWC model presented in the present paper

290

and in our earlier work - namely the generation of slow M/EEG rhythms through a delayed

291

inhibitory cortico-thalamo-cortical recurrent circuit, has been used extensively by multiple

292

groups for several decades. One of the largest and most comprehensive bodies of work on this

293

is due to P. Robinson and colleagues, beginning with the introduction in [79] of a PDE wave

294

equation reformulation of the integro-differential cortical neural field model of [83], drawing

295

on earlier work of [11], [66], and others. This model was then augmented with thalamic retic-

296

ular and relay nuclei and their recurrent connections with the cortex[39], and the resultant

297

corticothalamic neural field model has been studied extensively over the past two decades -

298

both analytically and numerically, and in partial differential, ordinary differential, and lin-

299

earized equation forms, as well as being extended into the domains of epilepsy, Parkinson’s,

300

sleep and arousal, plasticity, and brain stimulation (e.g. [39, 69, 67, 70, 84, 85, 82, 81, 68]).

301

Our approach in the present paper differs from this family of models in two key ways. First,

302

rather than the second-order equations of motion for the time-evolution of membrane volt-

303

age used by Robinson and many others[11, 61, 71], we began with the classic Wilson-Cowan

304

equations[86] to describe local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neural popu-

305

lations in a cortical region. Second, rather than the using an integro- or partial-differential

306

equation formulation of a continuum neural field to represent spatio-temporal propagation

307

of activity across the cortex[79, 66, 51, 74, 72, 73], here we chose to follow the connectome-

308

based neural mass modelling methodology[75, 76, 77, 26, 63, 20, 54] of defining a discrete

309

network of point-process neural masses, interconnected via long-range white matter fibres

310

whose density was estimated from non-invasive diffusion MRI tractography. This combina-

311

tion of the cortico-thalamocortical circuit with the large-scale anatomical connectivity bears

312

some similarity to the work of some other authors (e.g. [25, 56, 55, 80]), but the present study

313

is the first to apply this directly to the key questions of state-dependence, alpha suppression,

314

functional connectivity, stimulation, and their relation to empirical M/EEG data. Notably,

315

this network-based approach allowed us to harmonize the analysis of functional connectivity

316

in simulated and empirical MEG data. In this we followed the approach of [36] and [87]

317

in our use of the bandpass-filtered amplitude envelope correlations[78, 37], and that line of

318

work is perhaps the closest of recent modelling studies to the present one. In [36], Abey-

319

suriya and colleages studied the role of inhibitory synaptic plasticity in a connectome-based

320

network of Wilson-Cowan equations. As in the present study, these authors evaluated their

321

model in terms of its ability to accurately reproduce empirically measured MEG AEC ma-

322

trices (although they restricted their focus to only to alpha-frequency AECs). The relatively

323

simpler (as compared with our new CTWC) model used by these authors consisted of a

324

cortical Wilson-Cowan ensemble, tuned to have a natural frequency in the alpha range. This

325

stands somewhat in contrast to our new model, which features a gamma frequency-tuned

326

Wilson-Cowan ensemble, combined with an alpha frequency-tuned cortico-thalamocortical

327

motif. This additional two-component structure allows our model to exhibit more complex

328

behaviours, such as alpha-mediated inhibition and state-switching, as well as a rich reper-

329

toire of potential oscillation and frequency-specific synchronization patterns. The question

330

of whether and to what extent human M/EEG alpha activity is generated by corticothalamic

331

(as in e.g. the present study and much of the above-cited work by Robinson and colleagues),

332

or within intracortical microcircuits (as in e.g. [36], [58], [71]) remains a live and important

333

one however. Recent years has also seen growing interest in a third potential type of system-

334

level (low-frequency) rhythmogenic mechanism which can be broadly described as network

335

eigenmodes[51, 79, 72, 63, 62]. The proper evaluation and assessment of these hypotheses

336

around cortical rhythmogenesis shall most likely require a close interaction between novel

337

empirical work and hypothesis-generating computational models to properly settle. It is also

338

important to bear in mind here that there is no a priori reason (apart from explanatory

339

parsimony) to suppose a single mechanism for generation of rhythms[51]. Indeed, it may be

340

functionally advantageous for the brain to generate the same frequency through a variety

341

of mechanisms. If this were determined to be the case, then interaction across different

342

frequency-generating mechanisms would be a key question for future work.

343

The alpha rhythm as a suppression mechanism

344

The transition from idling to active state in our model is initiated by the gradual increase of

345

a tonic sensory/neuromodulatory drive term, Io , that effectively hyperpolarizes the thalamic

346

relay nucleus, and thereby destroys the slow 10Hz alpha rhythm generated by the cortico-

347

thalamocortical loop. Once the alpha oscillation is removed in this way, the gamma rhythm

348

generated by intracortical excitatory-inhibitory interactions comes to the fore. One inter-

349

pretation of this phenomenon is that alpha resonance, mediated by corticothalamic loops,

350

plays an inhibitory role - through which slow oscillatory corticothalamic activity suppresses

351

and dominates higher frequency cortical activity. This alpha-as-suppression-mechanism the-

352

ory speaks to a major question in the field of M/EEG cognitive neuroscience: what is the

353

functional role of alpha? Specifically, the enhancement of alpha activity during disengage-

354

ment of the cortical network (such as during quiescence, sleep, anaesthesia, and withdrawal

355

of sensory stimulation) suggests that alpha oscillations implement a functionally inhibitory

356

signal, and represent a top-down shift towards internal encoding through suppressing the

357

activity of task-irrelevant areas[49]. In contrast, faster frequencies, such as those found in

358

the beta and gamma range, are found in states of arousal and sensory recruitment, sug-

359

gesting a positive, excitatory role of faster neural oscillatory states. In our model,the less

360

spatially-resolved structure of functional connectivity in the alpha vs. the gamma range -

361

at all Io values, but particularly for Io >=1.4 - does support this perspective. From this

362

point of view, a key feature of our model is its characterization of the relationship be-

363

tween corticothalamically-generated and cortically-generated rhythms. In particular, the

364

corticothalamic alpha dominates in the idling state, and can be understood as suppressing

365

the intrinsic rhythmic activity in the cortical ensemble, which can be ‘released’ with suffi-

366

cient sensory or neuromodulatory drive. This simple circuit mechanism therefore captures a

367

widely used theoretical concept in M/EEG cognitive neuroscience concerning the functional

368

role of alpha activity. On this account, alpha acts as a mechanism for selectively gating and
23

369

attentionally biasing sensory inputs. This phenomenon is also observed in EEG studies on

370

the effects of anesthesia, where low frequency activity becomes increasingly dominant with

371

higher doses of propofol[50]. This effect is observed concurrently with apparent attenuation

372

of sensory inputs, for example in reduced amplitude and increased latency of somatosensory

373

evoked potentials (SEPs). Recent work in mouse models has also shown that driving thala-

374

mic circuits with alpha-frequency activity causes widespread depression of cortical activity;

375

whereas stimulating at higher frequencies (e.g. gamma) causes widespread increase in both

376

baseline activity and the spatial spread of the stimulation influence[18].

377

Interestingly, in our analyses we observed that the active-state model AEC patterns ac-

378

tually showed closer resemblance to empirical resting-state MEG AEC patterns than the

379

idling-state AEC patterns. This is somewhat unexpected because resting-state MEG power

380

spectrum was unequivocally better fit by a CTWC model in the idling, alpha-dominated

381

regime. This result suggests that in the brain, during the rest or idling state, alpha power

382

is strong and AEC functional connectivity is largely random. In contrast, in the active

383

state, alpha power is relatively weaker, and AECs are more local and segregated. Func-

384

tional connectivity is thus facilitated in the high-drive state, when the alpha-generating loop

385

is inhibited, and dynamics are driven by cortico-cortical E-I interactions. In the state of

386

low-drive, the alpha rhythm is highly prominent and functional connectivity is largely asyn-

387

chronous. In the state of high drive, the alpha rhythm has been suppressed, and functional

388

connectivity is high. Together, these observations suggest that the alpha rhythm plays a

389

suppressing role in large-scale brain dynamics. We hypothesize that this may be a general

390

feature of alpha activity - this indicates that regional communication is facilitated by being

391

in the active state, and that there perhaps a constant interplay and balance between the

392

idling state and the active state.

393

Conclusions and future directions

394

To conclude: we have developed a novel whole-brain connectome-based neural mass model

395

that incorporates corticothalamic and intracortical rhythmogenic mechanisms. This model

396

reproduces qualitatively multiple features of MEG-measured neural activity. Importantly,

397

our model also lends some insight into the way that cortico-thalamically-generated alpha

398

rhythms could play a functional role in the organization of brain dynamics, by suppress-

399

ing high-frequency cortical activity associated with cognitive engagement and information

400

processing. Future work shall investigate further questions of subcortical parcellation and in-

401

tegration, model fitting, and compare alternative rhythmogenic mechanisms directly against

402

each other. Importantly, future work should also investigate the significance of intersub-

403

ject variability in anatomical connectivity on network dynamics. Although we demonstrated

404

here our model’s ability to fit individual subjects’ power spectra through small variations

405

in thalamic kinetic parameters, it was beyond the scope of the present study to incorpo-

406

rate individualized anatomical connectivities. One of the exciting and promising aspects

407

of connectome-based neural mass modelling is the possibility of constructing individual-

408

ized computational models using a subjects’ own diffusion MRI tractography. However at

409

this point in time the extent to which this does actually deliver improvement in computa-

410

tional model accuracy remains an open question for the field (for recent work relevant to

411

this, see [36, 60]). Finally, we emphasize that neither our specific CTWC model, nor the

412

broader alpha-as-suppression-mechanism concept, constitute a universal account of all alpha-

413

frequency rhythms seen in the M/EEG or other recording modalities. Indeed we consider

414

the most likely scenario to be that multiple, dissociable mechanisms contribute indepen-

415

dently a proportion of the information and measured signal in that part of the frequency

416

spectrum[51]. Here we have, building on previous work, made we believe some progress in

417

characterizing the dynamic properties of one of these candidate mechanisms.

418

Methods

419

Our modelling approach follows the now-standard whole-brain connectome-based neural

420

mass modelling paradigm[75, 77, 19, 20], where dynamic units are placed at node locations

421

as defined by a grey matter parcellation, and coupled with an adjacency matrix (anatomi-

422

cal connectome) defining the presence and associated strengths of long-range white matter

423

fibres interconnecting region pairs. The anatomical connectome used in the present study,

424

derived from group-average tractography streamline counts, was constructed from analy-

425

ses of the human connectome project (HCP) WU-Minn consortium diffusion-weighted MRI

426

(DWI) corpus[21, 22]. For details of this, see the below section DWI data analyses .

427

In the model, activity at each node is driven by background noise and/or exogeneous

428

stimulation. Complete mathematical formulation and implementation details are given in

429

the section Corticothalamic model. Simulated nodal time series from the model can be

430

understood as approximations of regionally averaged source-space MEG signals. To assess

431

the performance of the model in reproducing key features of empirically measured human

432

brain dynamics, we additionally conducted new analyses of the HCP WU-Minn resting-state

433

MEG corpus[23]. These are described in the MEG data analyses section.

Corticothalamic model

Figure 7: Corticothalamic model. Schematic of the corticothalamic model structure.
Cortical (ue , ui ) and thalamic (us , ur ) populations interact through a delayed feedback loop.
Entrainment of the network activity through electromagnetic stimulation P applied to ue
depends on the amplitude and frequency of the stimulation pulse, as well as the network
state, controlled by Io .

435

Following other authors [39, 24, 25], we employ a model for neuronal dynamics at each node

436

that incorporates both cortical and thalamic neural populations. The model describes a

437

four-component cortico-thalamo-cortical motif, consisting of excitatory (ue ) and inhibitory

438

(ui ) cortical neuronal populations, coupled to thalamic reticular (ur ) and specific relay (us )

439

nuclei (Fig. 7). Both relay and reticular nuclei receive inputs from the cortical excitatory

440

population, following a corticothalamic conduction delay τct . However only the relay nucleus

441

sends excitatory input back to the cortex; again received following a delay τct =τtc . The

442

reticular nucleus, which is widely known to have an inhibitory influence of other thalamic

443

regions[59], plays a similar role to the cortical inhibitory population, inhibiting the relay

444

nucleus and thereby generating oscillatory dynamics.

445

As defined, our node-level model consists of a Wilson-Cowan oscillatory neural popu-

446

lation, embedded in a delayed inhibitory feedback loop mediated by corticothalamic and

447

thalamocortical connections. The full network-level model thus consists of a set of N such

448

local units of this kind, coupled using the connectivity matrix W (anatomical connectome).

468

both of which are derived from empirical diffusion-MRI tractography reconstructions (see

469

below). For the latter, the cortico-cortical conduction delay matrix T = L/cv is calculated

470

from a matrix of measured (average) fibre tract lengths L, assuming a fixed conduction

471

velocity cv=4m/s. The sigmoidal response function F in Eqs. 2 and 5 specifies the nonlinear

472

response of a neural population to incoming inputs as follows

in Eq. 1 parametrize the impact on the four subpopulations e, i, r, s within a node of

475

the time-varying exogenous input P (representing periodic brain stimulation such as rTMS

476

or TACS) and static input Io (representing here state-dependent sensory/neuromodulatory

477

drive). Again, in the present study we only consider exogeneous inputs to impact the cortical

478

excitatory populations, and so only the upper left entry in Sp is nonzero. Similarly, Io is

479

for present purposes only considered to impact the thalamic relay nucleus, and so only the

480

lower right entry of Si is nonzero. The exogeneous periodic signal P here is given by the

481

simple sinusoidal function

P j = M j sin(2πωt)

(8)

482

with frequency ω and intensity M . The constant state-dependent drive Ioj to thalamic

483

relay populations serves as a control parameter indexing idling vs active states (see below).

484

This static input current can be thought of as a tonic level of sensory (e.g. visual) drive,

485

although it could also reflect a static influence of ascending (e.g. noradrenergic) neuromodu-

486

latory drive, reflecting the level of engagement in a perceptual or cognitive task. Irrespective

487

of its cause, the idling or rest-like state is defined as the dynamics resulting from setting

488

Ioj =0; i.e. in the absence of this constant thalamic input. The active state, in contrast, is

489

defined by a greater engagement of thalamic nodes, and hence Ioj >0 for active nodes. In

490

both of these cases, nodes within the network may be differentially recruited by a given task,

491

thus being activated while others remain inactivated. This represents an intermediate point

492

between the extreme cases where all nodes are either active or inactive.

493

With the described structure, and right choice of parameters, our system generates alpha

494

(8-12Hz) oscillations due to the presence of delayed inhibition, as well as gamma (30-120Hz)

495

oscillations resulting from the cortical activity and interactions, and also in a limited domain

496

of parameter space shows coexistence of both of these features. As has been demonstrated

497

previously [48], increasing the thalamic drive parameter past a critical point triggers sup-

498

pression of resting state alpha oscillations, and results in a greater susceptibility of cortical

499

neural populations to entrainment by exogenous inputs or noninvasive stimulation. In addi-

500

tion, this transition to the active state is accompanied by an increase in high-frequency (i.e.

501

gamma) activity. As such, the thalamic drive can be seen as a control parameter, controlling

502

the power of alpha and gamma oscillations, as well as tuning the response to exogenous

503

inputs.

504

Nominal parameter values and definitions from the above-specified system of equations

505

are summarized in Table 1. The system was numerically integrated using a stochastic Euler-

506

Maruyama scheme, implemented in Python. Simulations were carried out on an 8-core

507

Ubuntu 14.04 machine. Run time scaled approximately linearly: each 2-second simulation

508

ran in approximately 2 seconds real time. All code and processed data used in this study is

509

freely available at https://github.com/GriffithsLab/ctwc-model, along with additional notes

510

and comments. A version of the model has also been developed for direct use within The

511

Virtual Brain modelling and neuroinformatics platform (TVB; www.thevirtualbrain.org)[26,

512

27]). Our model produces regional time series for each network node, as specified by the

513

anatomical parcellation. These represent the collective activity of neural populations within

514

that region, and as such correspond to signals estimated from MEG source reconstruction.

515

Subsequent power spectrum and functional connectivity analyses of simulated activity time

516

series therefore proceeded identically to that for MEG data, and are described in the MEG

517

data analyses section below.

DWI data analyses

519

The anatomical connectivity matrices used in this paper were constructed using diffusion-

520

and T1-weighted MRI data from the HCP WU-Minn consortium[28, 21, 22]. For detailed

521

descriptions of the MR acquisition parameters and processing pipeline, see [21, 22]. The HCP

522

WU-Minn corpus consists of multimodal imaging and behavioural data from 1200 healthy,

523

young (ages 20-40) subjects. The tractography analysis described below was applied to a

524

700-subject subset of the full sample; and the connectivity matrix used for simulations in

525

the present paper was calculated from an average over these 700 subjects.

526

The HCP WU-Minn minimal diffusion pipeline[21] consists of gradient nonlinearity cor-

527

rection, eddy current correction, boundary-based registration and reorientation of diffusion

528

data to the T1 image, and gradient vector rotation. The outputs of this preprocessing

529

pipeline were the starting point for our diffusion data analyses. Using the minimally prepro-

530

cessed diffusion data, we performed whole brain deterministic tractography reconstructions

531

using the Dipy software library[29], following a methodology modelled closely on that of [30]

532

and [31]. ODFs were computed at each white matter voxel using a DSI tissue model. Stream-

533

lines were initiated from 60 regularly-spaced grid points within each voxel on the grey-white

534

matter interface (as determined from coregistered freesurfer surfaces), and propagated using

535

the EuDX algorithm[32]. Streamlines not terminating at the grey-white matter interface, or

536

having lengths greater than 250mm or less than 10mm, were discarded. Subjects’ streamline

537

sets were segmented using the Lausanne scale-1 parcellation[30, 33], computed individually

538

for every subject from their freesurfer reconstructions using algorithms from the connectome

539

mapping toolkit[33]. All surface-based parcellations were then converted to image volumes

540

and resliced to diffusion space for streamline segmentations. For each parcellation, the in-

541

terconnecting streamlines for every ROI combination were determined using a logical AND

542

operation. Each segmented streamline set was counted and its average length computed, re-

543

sulting in streamline count and length matrices for each subject. The simulations described

544

in the present paper were computed using group-average tract length matrices (divided by

545

conduction velocity to convert to conduction delay), and group-average streamline count

546

matrices, with the latter first being log-transformed to adjust for the DWI tractography

547

over-estimation bias[36].

548

MEG data analyses

549

MEG analyses were performed using 10 randomly selected subjects from the HCP WU-

550

Minn corpus[23], using the MNE software library[35, 34]. The specific analyses done were

551

based on a modified version of the analysis pipeline developed by Engemann and colleagues

552

(https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-hcp), which implements a full source space analyses,

553

beginning with the HCP preprocessed sensor-space data. Key outcome variables from this

554

pipeline for the present study were whole-brain functional connectivity matrices and spectral

555

power maps, derived from regional source time series estimates. We opted to implement a

556

complete analysis here rather than use the high-level pipeline outputs provided with the

557

HCP WU-Minn corpus, as we needed complete control over the process. In particular, we

558

needed to a) use the same parcellation in the MEG as in the tractography analyses, and b)

559

ensure identical analyses were done on empirical and simulated MEG regional time series.

560

Regarding the first of these: as in the tractography analyses, the parcellation used for MEG

561

analyses was the Lausanne2008 scale 1 - but with 10 subcortical nodes (brainstem, basal

562

ganglia, thalamus) excluded. Note this is in fact identical to the freesurfer aparc parcellation

563

(but reordered and renamed).

564

Source time series were extracted for all vertices within a parcel using an L2 minimum-

565

norm inverse solution and averaged, yielding one representative time series per parcel. To

566

maximize robustness of these signals, this was operation was repeated five times, with 30-

567

second windows each[23]. Subsequent analysis of these regional time series proceeded iden-

568

tically for both the empirical and simulated MEG data. We first computed power spectra

569

for each region using Welch’s method. We then studied functional connectivity within the

570

system using the band-limited power Pearson correlation (BLPC) method[37, 38]. For this,

571

regional time series from each of the 5 windows were bandpass-filtered into six canonical fre-

572

quency bands: delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), low gamma

573

(30-50 Hz) and high gamma (60-80 Hz)[37]. Pearson correlations between the bandpass-

574

filtered time series were computed, and averaged over the 5 windows. Finally, these BLPC

575

matrices at each frequency band were averaged over subjects. Because our simulations used

576

a normative (rather than subject-specific) anatomical connectivity, these analyses were con-

577

ducted only once on the simulated MEG data, and this was compared to the group-averaged

578

MEG data to evaluate the performance of the model.
