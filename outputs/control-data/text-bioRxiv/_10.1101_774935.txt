Cells precisely control their mechanical properties to organize and differentiate into tissues. The architecture
and connectivity of cytoskeletal filaments changes in response to mechanical and biochemical cues, allowing
the cell to rapidly tune its mechanics from highly-crosslinked, elastic networks to weakly-crosslinked viscous
networks. While the role of actin crosslinking in controlling actin network mechanics is clear in purified actin
networks, its mechanical role in the cytoplasm of living cells remains unknown. Here, we probe the frequencydependent viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm in living cells using multiharmonic excitation and in situ
optical trap calibration. At previously unexplored long timescales, we observe that the cytoskeleton fluidizes.
The mechanics are well-captured by a model in which actin filaments are dynamically connected by a single
dominant crosslinker. A disease-causing point mutation (K255E) of the actin crosslinker α-actinin 4 (ACTN4)
causes its binding kinetics to be insensitive to tension. Under normal conditions, the viscoelastic properties
of wild type (WT) and K255E+/- cells are similar. However, when tension is reduced through myosin II inhibition,
WT cells relax 3x faster to the fluid-like regime while K255E+/- cells are not affected. These results indicate that
dynamic actin crosslinking enables the cytoplasm to flow at long timescales.
The actin cytoskeleton is a network of filaments crosslinked by actin binding proteins. The cytoskeleton provides
mechanical support and drives cell motility and morphological changes1. Crosslinking proteins undergo continuous
cycles of binding and unbinding, enabling the cell to act as an elastic solid at short timescales and as a viscous fluid at
long timescales2,3. To characterize the mechanics of the active, viscoelastic cellular environment, we developed
methods to probe cytoplasmic mechanics in living cells over timescales ranging from 0.02 to 500 Hz using an optical
trap (OT). Active microrheology as applied here is insensitive to non-equilibrium active cellular processes like motor
protein-based transport and cytoskeletal dynamics because only the response that is coherent with the applied
displacement is analyzed4,5. OTs can apply a local deformation directly in the cytoplasm of living cells, while other
commonly used active methods such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and magnetic twisting cytometry apply a local
deformation at the cell surface. The viscoelastic response is described by the frequency-dependent complex shear
modulus G*(f) = G’(f) + iG’’(f) where the real part G’(f) and the imaginary part G’’(f) correspond to the elastic (storage)
and viscous (loss) modulus, respectively. While the magnitudes of G’(f) and G’’(f) reported in the literature vary greatly
between different measurements, their frequency dependence is well conserved across different cell types and
experimental conditions4. G’(f) and G’’(f) increase with frequency following a weak power law G*(f) ~ fα with α = 0.050.35 from ~1 Hz to ~100 Hz4-18, and a stronger power law G*(f) ~ fβ with β = 0.5-1.0 for frequencies above ~100
Hz4,7,13,19,20. The weak power law has been attributed phenomenologically to the soft glassy material (SGM)
theory12,13,21, while the strong power law has been explained by entropic filament bending fluctuations13,22,23. However,
at timescales longer than 1s (i.e. at frequencies below ~1 Hz), relevant to cell division, motility and morphological
changes, active microrheological data is scarce especially in the cytoplasm of living cells and microrheology from
thermally driven particles is prone to errors from the contribution of active processes in the cell4,5. At these long
timescales, transient actin crosslinking by various actin crosslinkers govern the viscoelastic properties of purified actin
networks24-31. When these networks are deformed at frequencies slower than the crosslinker’s unbinding rate (koff), the
crosslinkers have enough time to unbind, allowing the filaments to freely slide past one another resulting in a more
fluid-like, viscous network (Fig. 1a). At deformation frequencies faster than koff, the actin filaments remain highly
interconnected resulting in filament bending and a more solid-like, elastic network (Fig. 1b). We hypothesize that this
role of dynamic actin crosslinking may allow the actin cytoskeleton to fluidize during movement and morphological
changes, while also maintaining structural integrity. Active microrheological studies on the cell surface have reported
G*(f) at frequencies at least one decade below 1 Hz11-18 but the distinct4 mechanical properties in the intracellular
environment at these long timescales remain unexplored. OTs are well-suited to measure these mechanical properties
and while several studies have reported intracellular viscoelasticity5,6,8-10,19,20,32 the mechanics at ~0.01-1 Hz have not
been quantified in detail. Experimental measurements of slow dynamics are challenging due to the long observations
required and, while OT calibration in the cell provides more accurate measurements33-35, it has often been neglected.
To perform simultaneous measurements over a wide frequency range, we optically trap a 500-nm polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-coated bead located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1c,d, Methods) and apply a multiharmonic excitation input to the trap
position using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD). Because there are significant elastic contributions from the cytoplasm
and non-equilibrium active processes, the trap stiffness, ktrap, and the photodiode constant, βpd, cannot be calibrated

network being deformed by a microbead at frequencies (f) slower than the unbinding rate of the crosslinkers (koff), before (opaque)
and after deformation (transparent). Previously bound crosslinkers (blue heads) detach (magenta heads) and the filaments are free

The peripheral curved arrows show rearrangements of the actin filaments resulting in energy dissipated through viscous drag. b, At
frequencies faster than koff, the crosslinkers stay bound and interlock the filaments, resulting in filament bending and a more solid-like,
elastic response. The parallel pairs of lines surrounding the deformed filaments depict dissipation of energy through filament bending
fluctuations which is limited by the crosslinked points. c, Schematic of the experimental setup. Fibroblast cells are seeded on a glass
coverslip and passivated 500 nm beads are phagocytosed into the cells. An input excitation is applied in the form of sinusoidal
displacements of the trap position (xtrap). Measurements are performed on beads located in the most mechanically homogenous region
of the cell, midway between the cell periphery and perinuclear region where distinct actin cytoskeleton organization exists. Not to

using traditional methods relying on thermal fluctuations. Here, a simple viscoelastic model is fit to the measured
response to calibrate the optical trap in situ34. From the time domain signal of the photodetector and the trap position
(Fig. 2a), the frequency response function (FRF) is obtained (Fig. 2b). The magnitude and phase of the FRF, as well
as the power spectrum are simultaneously fit to the model to extract ktrap and βpd. The magnitude response at
frequencies above ~1 Hz is well-captured by this simple viscoelastic model, with a first inflection point at ~4 Hz
representing the stiffness of the cytoplasm and a second inflection point at ~200 Hz representing the combined
stiffnesses of the cytoplasm and the OT (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Information). The resulting ktrap and βpd vary between
cells and between experiments due to variable optical properties (Supplementary Fig. 2), reinforcing the necessity for
in situ calibration. Despite variability among cells, the product of ktrap and βpd falls within the same constant range, as
reported previously36 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The response measured in a 20% PEG water solution agrees well with
data obtained from a rheometer (Supplementary Fig. 3). Once calibrated, ktrap and βpd are used, along with the FRF, to
obtain the complex shear modulus G*(f)37. Combined with multiharmonic excitation, this calibration method allows ktrap,
βpd and G*(f) to be obtained in a single continuous measurement, thereby minimizing sources of error (see
Supplementary Information). This approach has advantages over other methods used to calibrate the OT in active,
viscoelastic media. Methods based on light momentum changes rely on capturing most of the diffracted and scattered
light36. However, organelles and other structures result in substantial refraction. An alternative method uses the active
response to sinusoidal inputs combined with the passive response for in situ calibration in viscoelastic medium19,20,3335,38-40
. ktrap can be obtained from the average ktrap values at each input frequency based on the ratio of the real part of
the active spectrum to the passive thermal spectrum at the same frequency19,20,33,35,38-40. βpd can be calibrated
separately using an active oscillation of the stage or the laser combined with the position readings from the camera or
photodiode. However, both ktrap and βpd are sensitive to sources of error as they are derived from a single frequency
point.
Using multiharmonic excitation and in situ calibration, we characterize the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm of
living cells at frequencies ranging from 0.02 to 500 Hz. In WT fibroblasts, the measured moduli can be fit to a double
power law (Fig. 3a, magenta), yielding a weak power law (α = 0.116 ± 0.021) at frequencies between ~1 Hz and ~20
Hz and a stronger power law above ~20 Hz (β = 0.717 ± 0.062), in excellent agreement with previous work5,8,13,19.
However, at frequencies below ~1 Hz, we observe a pronounced transition to a fluid-like response, apparent in the loss
tangent (G’’/G’) which reaches a minimum at ~1 Hz and increases steadily with decreasing frequencies. This behavior
is not captured by the power law model (Fig. 3a, inset). This fluidization occurs at timescales relevant to slower
processes such as cell migration2,41 and cell division3,42. Fluid-like relaxation has been observed in mixtures of actin
filaments and actin crosslinkers in vitro, where the timescales of relaxation are determined by the crosslinker unbinding
kinetics27-31. The observation of similar fluidization in cells is surprising as many crosslinking proteins with different
binding kinetics likely contribute to the viscoelastic response. The first term of the phenomenological double power law
model describes a SGM at longer timescales and the second term describes frequency scaling from entropic filament
fluctuations at shorter timescales13 (Fig. 3b, top). The rheology of a SGM has been empirically observed as elastically
dominant and weakly scaling with frequency with a constant loss tangent of ~ 0.143. In contrast, our data indicate the
loss tangent of the cytoplasm varies at frequencies below ~1 Hz and reaches 1.0, indicating an equal viscous and
elastic contribution at low frequencies (Fig. 3a, inset). Fitting a model that assumes mechanics are governed by the

Figure 2 | Analytical methods to obtain the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm from optical trapping data. a, The trap
position (xtrap, black) and photodiode position (xpd, gray) in the time domain are transformed into the frequency domain. Note that the
photodiode signal is acquired in volts and converted to nanometers after in situ calibration. b, The magnitude and phase of the
response of the photodiode output signal to movements of the trap at each input frequency is captured by the transfer function. The
transfer function above 1 Hz is fit (red) to the active part of a simple viscoelastic model (inset) to obtain the trap stiffness ktrap (pN/nm)
and photodiode constant βpd (nm/V). The mechanical circuit (inset) depicts the forces experienced by the bead from the optical trap
and the viscoelastic environment. c, The power spectrum of the output between 250 Hz and 2500 Hz (gray) resulting from thermal
fluctuations is simultaneously fit to the passive part of the model. Below 250 Hz, non-equilibrium active cellular processes, electrical
noise (blue arrow head) and stage vibrations (magenta arrow head) contribute to the response while above ~2500 Hz, the noise floor (dashed
line) is reached. The active response from the multiharmonic excitation (red arrow heads) is visible. The best fit (red) is extended for

visualization. A slope smaller than 2 (cyan) indicates constrained diffusion. d, The elastic (G’, solid circles) and viscous (G’’, open
squares) moduli are obtained from the transfer function with the calibrated ktrap and βpd for every experiment (see Supplementary
Information). This single modulus plot shows a predominantly elastic cytoplasm with a minimum viscous contribution ~1 Hz visible in
the loss tangent (G’’/G’, inset).

unbinding kinetics of a dominant crosslinker28 captures the data well (Fig. 3a, gray). The semi-phenomenological
dynamic crosslinking model has a first term derived from the Fourier transform of the exponentially decaying lifetime of
crosslinked points. This first term decreases the plateau elastic modulus G0 and increases the amount of viscous
dissipation in isotropically crosslinked actin networks28. The second term describes filament bending fluctuations at
shorter timescales as before. The dominant crosslinker’s characteristic timescale, koff, appears as a local maximum in
the viscous modulus (Fig. 3a) at the frequency of relaxation (fr = koff/2π). Fitting this model to the measured moduli
yields an estimate of koff = 0.24 Hz (Fig. 4b) for WT fibroblasts. This estimate is in agreement with unbinding rates
measured for several passive actin crosslinkers44,45. The dynamic crosslinking model was derived from and studied in
bulk rheology of actin polymer gels where the unbinding of crosslinkers was related to bulk properties through the
assumption that G0 ~ Nx with x = 1 (where N is the number of crosslinked points) in a homogeneous and isotropically
crosslinked network28. However, the cytoplasm is likely a composite network with the coexistence of bundled, branched,
and isotropically crosslinked actin filaments, despite our efforts to probe the most homogenous region of the cytoplasm
(Fig. 1c,d). Additionally, cell orientation and deformation axis also result in anisotropic mechanical properties9. The
same model with G0 ~ Nx and x not equal to 1 may account for some of this anisotropy. In addition, in bulk rheology,
the shear stresses are assumed to be evenly distributed at the microscale. Thus, the resulting mechanical response is
a summation of the contributions of individual crosslinkers across the sample. However, in microrheology, an increased
viscous dissipation from the depletion of crosslinked points in the vicinity of the probe is expected, causing a crossover

17 data sets). More than 90% of the bootstrap points shown are drawn from 17 data sets while the remaining are drawn from 14-16
data sets due to differences in excitation inputs applied across experiments. Fluidization (i.e. relaxation) is visible at frequencies below
~1 Hz: reading from right to left, there is a local G’’ minimum followed by a local G’’ maximum along with a drop in G’, also evident in
the loss tangent (inset), with a minimum at ~1 Hz and a steady rise with decreasing frequency. The best fits to the power law (magenta)
and dynamic crosslinking model (gray) are the average fits obtained at each bootstrap samples. The dynamic crosslinking model
captures the dynamics at lower frequencies better than the power law model (see Supplementary Fig. 4), with the local G’’ maximum
corresponding to the relaxation frequency, fr = koff/2π (arrow). b, Analytical expressions of the models. The power law model consists
of two frequency terms raised to the power of α and β respectively, added together and scaled with constants A, B and f0. The real
and imaginary part yield the elastic and viscous modulus respectively. The dynamic crosslinking model includes a koff-dependent term.
G0 is the plateau elastic modulus, N is the number of crosslinked points, a, b, c, d and f0 are scaling constants. From the power law
model fit, α = 0.116 ± 0.021 (mean and standard deviation of the means) and β = 0.717 ± 0.062. From the dynamic crosslinking model

of elastic and viscous moduli at lower frequencies28. Thus, it may be possible to further improve the fit to the model by
including a stronger frequency-dependent loss of crosslinking points. All in all, our data along with the fit suggest that
dynamic crosslinking of the cytoskeleton results in the fluidization of the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that the cell
could tune its viscoelastic properties to suit its mechanical needs by modulating the crosslinking dynamics of key
crosslinkers. Correspondingly, a misregulation in crosslinking dynamics may cause the onset of diseases46. To
investigate the role of actin crosslinker binding kinetics in governing cytoplasmic mechanics, we probe the viscoelastic
properties of cells heterozygous for an ACTN4 mutation. ACTN4 is a ubiquitous crosslinker that dynamically crosslinks
actin filaments with koff ~0.4 Hz44 and is involved in the formation of actin bundles47. The K255E mutation has been
associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)48. In FSGS, podocytes are less able to resist cyclic loading,
suggesting a misregulation of the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton49. Indeed, this mutation alone reduces cell
motility while increasing cellular forces in heterozygous cell lines through an interplay with tension-generating myosin
II motors46. This effect is believed to be due to the exposure of a cryptic actin binding site in the K255E mutant, resulting
in its increased affinity of for actin (i.e. slower koff)47. In WT ACTN4, the cryptic actin binding site is thought to only be
exposed when the crosslinker is under tension, resulting in a catch-bond behavior24 (Fig. 4b, top inset). The difference
in the unbinding rates of the WT ACTN4 and the K255E mutant results in a shift of fr in purified networks24,25,31. In
contrast, our results show no significant difference in the mechanical properties of WT and K255E+/- cells (Fig. 4a),
possibly due to lower expression of K255E mutant and other mechanical anisotropies in the region probed. Overall,
with koff WT = 0.24 Hz and koff K255E = 0.37 Hz (Fig. 4b) from the average best fit, our results suggest similar crosslinking
dynamics in the WT and K255E+/- cells under normal conditions (Fig. 4b, top and bottom insets).
To isolate the role of tension on ACTN4 binding kinetics, we treat the cells with 50 µM Blebbistatin (BB). BB reversibly
locks myosin II in the low-affinity ADP-Pi state, reducing tension in the actin cytoskeleton50. With 50 µM BB, a sufficient
number of mildly affected cells (Supplementary Fig. 6) remain viable for mechanical measurements. Surprisingly, we
do not observe significant softening of the cytoplasm (Fig. 4b) as reported previously5. This may be due to differences
in BB treatment response levels inducing more local heterogeneity, as depicted by the greater variability in the data
(Fig. 4a, bottom) and the wider distribution of koff (Fig. 4b, top), or differences in the in situ calibrated ktrap and βpd values
(Supplementary Fig. 2). It is also likely that the local cytoplasmic microenvironment is less sensitive to actomyosin

= 0.37 Hz and koff K255E BB = 0.52 Hz (bottom) are obtained. The difference between these unbinding rates are proportional to the
differences in fr numbered in a. c, The difference between loss tangents (∆G’’/G’) indicates that the mechanics of WT cells are tension
sensitive while the K255E mutation reduces sensitivity to tension. The empty square at 0.79 Hz indicates a frequency point that is
only present for one of the two conditions, resulting in no quantifiable difference. Distributions shifted above zero (red dashed line)
indicate an increase in the loss tangent. ∆G’’/G’ between untreated K255E+/- and untreated WT cells (gray) show narrow distributions
about zero, indicating little differences between the two conditions. ∆G’’/G’ between BB-treated WT and untreated WT cells (black)
show a general upward shift, indicating that the BB-treated WT cells are more viscous compared to untreated WT cells. ∆G’’/G’
between BB-treated K255E+/- and untreated K255E+/- cells (blue) do not show a general trend, as indicated by the similar number of
upward and downward shifts in distributions. At 0.43 Hz, the black curve is shifted upwards while the blue remains slightly below zero.
This indicates an earlier transition to the fluid-like regime when WT cells are treated with BB compared to when K255E+/- cells are
treated with BB. This upwards shift is consistent below 1 Hz, except at 0.097 Hz, indicating an overall increased fluid-like behavior at
long timescales upon BB treatment in WT cells compared to K255E+/- cells.

activity, and thus BB treatment, compared to on the cortex where a much more dramatic effect on magnitude is
expected14. In terms of frequency-dependence, we observe a ~3-fold faster relaxation in BB-treated WT cells, with koff
increasing from 0.24 Hz to 0.89 Hz in the presence of BB (Fig. 4a, bottom). Interestingly, koff in K255E+/- cells remained
similar, with koff K255E = 0.37 Hz and koff K255E BB = 0.52 Hz. The results suggest that with reduced tension (through myosin
II inhibition), actin binding kinetics differ in a manner that is consistent with the differences between the binding kinetics
of WT and K255E ACTN4 (Fig. 4b, top and bottom insets). While tension levels vary between cells and within a single
cell51, it is expected that, on average, the tension levels are reduced with BB treatment. The active crosslinker myosin
II may also directly play a role in regulating the observed mechanics as shown previously in purified networks52,53 at
intermediate and long timescales. The effect of crosslinking dynamics on relaxation is also readily apparent in the
differences in loss tangent (Fig. 4c). Latrunculin A (Lat A) depolymerizes actin filaments by sequestering free actin
monomers55. Interestingly, treating WT cells with Lat A shifts the relaxation to faster timescales (Supplementary Fig.
5), suggesting actin filaments disruption plays a similar role in relaxation as the inhibition of intracellular tension7. In Lat
A-treated cells, the presence of fewer, shorter actin filaments is expected to reduce the ability of ACTN4 and myosin II
to interact with and crosslink actin filaments, reducing the tension generated and stored in the network53. This reduced
number of crosslinked points does not alter the frequency of relaxation in purified networks25,28,29, suggesting that the
shift in relaxation that we observe in Lat A-treated WT cells results from changes in binding kinetics, similar to what is
observed with BB treatment. In both BB- and Lat A-treated cells (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5), the loss tangent
indicates that the network is more fluid-like at lower frequencies, consistent with previous observations using AFM7.
However, similar to BB treatment, and in contrast with previous studies7,18, we observe negligible differences in the
magnitudes of G* with Lat A treatment. Intermediate filaments, another component of the cytoskeletal network,
contribute approximatively half of the mechanical resistance in the intracellular environment10 and thus help maintain
mechanical integrity even when the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted. Furthermore, cells that show severe signs of actin
cytoskeleton disruption are not viable for mechanical measurements. Consequently, healthier cells (Supplementary
Fig. 6) were chosen preferentially to yield more consistent and quantifiable results, which may partly explain the similar
magnitudes observed under BB and Lat A treatment. Overall, our results show a shift in relaxation to faster timescales
when myosin II is inhibited, particularly in the case of WT cells, suggesting an earlier transition to the fluid-like regime
consistent with the tension-dependent differences in binding kinetics between WT and K255E ACTN4.
Mechanical properties play an important role in the regulation of many cellular functions and allow the cell to be solid
enough to provide structural support but also fluid enough to reorganize and perform dynamic functions. By developing
a novel method to measure intracellular mechanics, our measurements reveal relaxation of the cytoskeleton at long
timescales across all conditions, pointing to a fundamental mechanical property of the cytoplasm. In addition, a model
that includes the binding kinetics of a dominant actin crosslinker captures these relaxation dynamics well. However,
while our data suggest a relationship between mechanical relaxation and the crosslinking dynamics of ACTN4, many
other crosslinkers and motor proteins contribute and it is unlikely that ACTN4 alone governs the viscoelasticity at these
timescales. Other cytoskeletal components with their associated proteins may also contribute to cytoplasmic relaxation
through mechanisms that are yet to be identified. Overall, we performed calibrated mechanical measurements in the
cytoplasm of living cells using optical tweezers and related the relaxation dynamics observed to the binding kinetics of
ACTN4. Future work focusing on other crosslinkers and other components of the cytoskeleton, as well as on simplified
in vitro systems, will add to the results reported here and provide a more complete understanding of the mechanisms
governing cytoplasmic fluidization.

Methods
Cell culture and preparation. Two dermal fibroblasts cell lines are used from previously immortalized cell lines46. Cells are cultured in DMEM media
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells are passaged at
80% confluency and plated 24h before the experiment at low enough confluency to minimize cell-cell contacts. 500 nm diameter fluorescent latex beads
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) are PEG-coated following previously protocol56. Prior to the experiment, the beads are washed and resuspended in hypertonic
media (~109 beads/mL in 10% PEG 35000, 0.25 M sucrose in supplemented DMEM media). The cells are left in the incubator for one hour to recover
from the shock. The coverslips are mounted on microscope slides using double-sided tape to form a flow chamber. Complete media, supplemented with
50 µM BB or 100 nM Lat A in some experiments, is flowed into the chamber. Measurements start 15 minutes after treatment and cells are kept at 37 °C
using a heater (World Precision Instruments) in a custom-built environmental chamber during all optical trapping experiments.
Optical trap. The optical trap installed on an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-E: Nikon) is used with a 1.49 NA oil-immersion 100x-objective. The nearIR 1064 nm laser beam (10 W, IPG Photonics) is expanded to overfill the back aperture of the objective. The bead position relative to the laser center is
measured using a lateral effect photodiode (Thorlabs) positioned conjugate to the objective’s back focal plane. The laser is steered using 2-axis AODs
(QuantaTech) controlled through a field-programmable gate array and custom LabVIEW programs (National Instruments). A multiharmonic (~18
frequencies) excitation input wave is applied to a single intracellularly located bead per cell. The frequencies range from 0.02 Hz to 1300 Hz (moduli

obtained from 0.02 to 500 Hz), with corresponding amplitudes ranging from ~50 nm to ~1 nm. The frequencies of oscillation are selected to avoid
subharmonics generation. The amplitudes are empirically chosen to yield a linear response from the cytoplasm. No significant subharmonic generation
was observed from the amplitudes applied, indicating that the measurements were performed in the linear regime57.
Optical trap data analysis. Data is acquired at 200 kHz downsampled to 20 kHz or directly acquired at 20 kHz (Supplementary Fig. 1). ktrap and βpd
are obtained for each individual measurement as previously described34. In brief, the FRF is obtained from the cross spectral density of the bead
displacement and AOD using Welch’s method on MATLAB. The window length is chosen at each individual frequency to be an integer multiple of the
period of the input frequency to avoid leakage33. The integer multiple, is chosen to obtain the best trade-off between frequency resolution and averaging.
A simplified viscoelastic model is simultaneously fit to the FRF and the power spectrum of the thermal response to obtain ktrap and βpd34. The elastic and
viscous moduli are directly obtained from the FRF knowing ktrap and βpd37. See Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information for more details.
Statistics. 1000 bootstrap samples are drawn from the data and each bootstrap sample is fit to either the dynamic crosslinking model or the power law
model, allowing distributions of fit parameters to be obtained for each condition. To compare the two model fits, Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are
used. Fitting bootstrap samples allows statistics to be directly obtained and also allows a more representative comparison of the fit parameters between
conditions, as oppose to directly fitting the mean of the data. See Supplementary Information for more details.

corresponding sample as in a. The best fit to the power spectrum of the model is shown in red. On the left, direct data acquisition at
20kHz is used, aliasing can be seen at frequencies above ~2500 Hz with the noise floor being reached at frequencies past ~3000 Hz.
The part of the power spectrum that is fit is shown in grey and stops before reaching the aforementioned frequencies. On the right,
data acquisition at 200kHz downsampled to 20kHz through averaging is used. A filtering effect from the averaging can be seen starting
at ~2500kHz with a second apparent corner frequency. This filtering was corrected during the fit by adding a low pass filter with
corresponding corner frequency.

(G’’, open squares) moduli from a rheometer (magenta, MCR 302, Anton Paar) are compared to moduli obtained from the optical trap
(black). The values obtained from bulk rheology show G’’~ f1.098 (magenta line, magenta number) at frequencies below ~7 Hz, in
agreement with the G’’ scaling measured from microrheology, with G’’~ f0.946 (black line, black number). At frequencies past ~7 Hz, a
stronger G’’ scaling is observed for the bulk data, with G’ ~ f2.810 (blue line, blue number). This is likely due to inertial effects coming
from the instrument and the sample itself that can show an apparent increased frequency dependence at higher frequencies6. For
optical trapping measurements at the microscale, inertial forces remain negligible at these timescales. In terms of magnitude, the data
from the rheometer show significantly greater viscous and elastic moduli across the whole frequency spectrum. This is likely due to
differences between the length scales investigated in bulk and microrheology that result in a different mechanical response to
deformation7,8. From the loss tangent (G’’/G’, inset), before 1 Hz, the rheometer is unable to probe the elastic modulus reliably, resulting
in very low elastic moduli (out of the plotted region in the main plot) and jumps in the loss tangent. Between 1 Hz and 10 Hz, the
rheometer data show lower loss tangent, indicating that there is a greater elastic contribution, likely from surface tension6. Above 10
Hz the loss tangent increases due to inertial effects as discussed above.

Supplementary Figure 4 | Difference in Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values. (A) The distribution of the difference in BIC
values from the loss tangent (G’’/G’) fit between the dynamic crosslinking model and power law model (see Fig. 3b) is obtained at
each bootstrap sample for all four conditions and plotted vertically (y-axis and x-axis are both arbitrary units). The number next to the
distribution indicates the mean of the difference in BIC values. A downward shift from zero (dashed red line) indicates a smaller BIC
value for the dynamic crosslinking model, i.e. a better fit using that model. Wild type (WT), mutant (K255E+/-) and Blebbistatin(BB)treated WT (WT BB) cells show a downward shift suggesting that the dynamic crosslinking model is better. Surprisingly, K255E+/- BB
show an upward shift, suggesting that the power law model captures the loss tangent better, possibility due to the inability of the
dynamic crosslinking model to capture the slowest and fastest frequencies. (B) The distribution of the difference in BIC values obtained
from the fit to G’ and G’’ show an upward shift for all conditions, suggesting that the power law model captures G’ and G’’ better. This
may be due to single frequency point magnitude shifts that contributes to increased error terms. The loss tangent is less sensitive to
these sources of error and is likely better suited for BIC values comparison. Overall, while the difference between the BIC distributions
comparing the power law and dynamic crosslinking model are not statistically significant, the power law model is unable to capture
the relaxation dynamics at low frequencies as seen in the loss tangent plots (see Figs. 3a and 4a in main text and Supplementary
Figure 5) where a distinct V-shape is observed.

open squares) moduli from untreated WT (gray) and cells treated with 100nM Latrunculin A (Lat A, red). The best fit to the BB-treated
WT cells is shown in black for comparison. The Lat A-treated cells show faster relaxation (koff = 0.80 Hz) compared to untreated WT
(koff = 0.24 Hz), as indicated by the earlier drop in G’ and earlier rise in G’’ at ~0.4 Hz. This is also visible in the loss tangent (inset),
with a minimum observed at ~1 Hz, and an earlier rise in loss tangent with decreasing frequency, overall indicating an earlier transition
to the fluid-like regime. Lat A-treated cells also show very similar relaxation compared to the Blebbistatin-treated WT cells (koff = 0.89
Hz), as indicated by the near overlap between the red and black curves. Lat A concentrations greater than 100nM lead to complete
cell death (data not show) while at 100 nM, only a small fraction of the cells showed severe signs of actin depolymerization and were
avoided for mechanical measurements.

Supplementary Figure 6 | Immunofluorescent images of the WT and K255E+/- cells in various conditions.
WT (top three rows) and K255E+/- mutant (bottom three rows) immunofluorescent images under normal conditions, after 50µM BB
treatment and after 100nM Lat A treatment. ACTN4 was stained with 1:350 primary anti-ACTN4 (ab59468, abcam), incubated
overnight at 4°C, followed by 1:350 secondary anti-rabbit (Anti-Rabbit Atto 488, Sigma-Aldrich) incubated for 30 mins along with 1:100
phalloidin (Alexa Fluor™ 647 Phalloidin, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images show the maximum intensity projection of 3 Z stacks 200
µm apart acquired using near-Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (near-TIRF) illumination. In normal conditions, K255E+/- cells
are slightly larger and show more developed actin stress fibers compared to WT cells (untreated, actin column) in agreement with
observations on homozygous K255E+/- mutant cells9. K255E+/- cells show less specific ACTN4 localization to both actin stress fibers
and regions of increased actin enrichment (untreated, ACTN4 and merged column), suggesting that K255E ACTN4 does not
preferentially bind to actin filaments under tension or active reorganization, in agreement with its binding kinetics. K255E+/- cells also
show little preferential actin enrichment at the cell leading edge suggesting an impaired cell motility machinery, consistent with the
mutant’s reduced motility reported previously10. For both WT and K255E+/- cells, BB treatment reduces the number of visible stress
fibers and causes highly irregular cell membrane shape at the cell periphery (BB treatment, actin column), indicating a disruption in
the actomyosin machinery. Under Lat A treatment, actin is most visible at the cell periphery (Lat A treatment, actin column), indicating
that thick bundles and dense actin networks at the cell periphery are able to resist Lat A better compared to single or weakly bundled
actin filaments in the cytosol, consistent with Lat A’s expected effect. Overall, we observe only subtle differences between the WT and
K255E+/- mutant cells, which may also explain the subtle differences we measure in cytoplasmic viscoelasticity. Careful quantification
of these actin and ACTN4 localization differences in the future would help in further interpreting the mechanical measurements. Finally,
it is important to note that cells under both BB and Lat A treatment only show mild signs of actin cytoskeleton disruption. Indeed, the
concentrations of BB and Lat A were chosen to cause a mild disruption of the actin cytoskeleton to ensure cells were viable for
mechanical measurements and no large-scale morphological changes were observed.

Supplementary Information
Data handling. To collect data over several periods of excitation, a single measurement typically lasts 220 seconds or
longer and active oscillations across all ~17 frequencies are continuously being applied. The frequency response
function (FRF), i.e. the transfer function H(ω), is obtained using Welch’s method, implemented in MATLAB with the
“tfestimate” function. The Hamming window function is used and gives a slightly better response in terms of magnitude
and coherence compared to the Hann window. The transfer function estimate is obtained at each input frequency
separately with separate window lengths (NFFT). The window length is chosen to be an integer multiple of the input
frequency to minimize signal leakage into adjacent frequency bins. The per cent overlap between windows is chosen
based on empirical observations to yield the maximum magnitude and maximum coherence. At the lowest frequencies,
less periods of excitation are contained in the measurement total time and the per cent overlap is thus chosen to be
larger to allow more averaging over the ~4 windows. At higher frequencies, the overlap is chosen to be 50% over the
6-8 windows. All windows and overlap amounts are chosen such that at most, ~15 % of the data is truncated at the
end. Indeed, as we have a finite sample length, truncation of the data occurs when the windows don’t exactly add up
to the total length. Overall, the aforementioned window lengths and overlaps yield the best balance between frequency
resolution and averaging. However, a more detailed and quantitative characterization may help for future application of
this method. The magnitude and phase obtained are fit to the active part of the viscoelastic model discussed further
below.
The power spectrum used for the thermal response is obtained using the same data. The peaks that correspond to
the active oscillations are cropped out based on the known excitation frequencies. The remaining power spectrum
represents the thermal response. For data that is acquired at 200kHz downsampled to 20kHz using a Field
Programmable Gate Array, a pole is added to the viscoelastic model (corner frequency ~ 3000 Hz) to account for this
low pass filter coming from the downsampling by averaging. Sampling at 200kHz downsampled to 40kHz shifts this
filtering to higher frequencies, confirming that the averaging is acting like a low pass filter (data not shown). Data
acquired directly at 20kHz show a reduced signal to noise ratio compared to oversampled and averaged data, where
the noise floor is visible on the power spectrum at high frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In these cases, the power
spectrum is fit only up to the point where this upwards shift is observed.

In situ calibration. From the mechanical circuit (Fig. 2b), for the case where the stage is stationary and by making the
following substitution: ∆x(t) = xbead(t)-xtrap(t) and kcyt(t) = kcyt,0 + kcyt,1t-(α-1), the following equation of motion can be
obtained

Substituting the cytoplasmic stiffness (kcyt) by the sum of the constant stiffness (kcyt,0) and the frequency dependent
stiffness (kcyt,1t-(α-1)) observed in semiflexible polymer network allows the model to account for some of the viscoelastic
properties of the cytoplasm1. Looking at the active part only (i.e. Fthermal = 0), neglecting inertial forces (#̈ %&'( = 0) and
taking the Laplace transform at steady state (s = jω), the following transfer function H(ω) = ∆X(ω) / Xtrap(ω) is obtained:

Where Vpd(ω)βpd = ∆X(ω) is used and represents the voltage from the photodiode and the photodiode calibration

single zero proportional to 1/kcyt,0 and the denominator is a single pole proportional to the inverse of the total stiffness,
1/(ktrap + kcyt,0). The zero and pole are responsible for the two inflection points in the magnitude response, leading to
the sigmoidal curve observed in the magnitude response obtained experimentally (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1a).
The addition of the frequency dependent stiffness shifts the zero and pole positions and changes the sharpness of the
transition between the two1. The magnitude and phase of EQ (1) is what we fit to our experimental H(ω) obtained
through tfestimate as outlined above.

by EQ (2) through EQ (3). The corner frequency in the power spectrum is the result from the sum of the total stiffness
of the system and corresponds to the pole in the magnitude response described above. α dictates the slope after the
corner frequency, with α=1 corresponding to purely diffusive behavior and a slope of 2 in the power spectrum, and α<1
corresponding to constrained diffusion with a slope < 2 in the power spectrum. For more details on the different
parameters of the model, see reference4.

With the previously calibrated ktrap and βpd calibrated from EQ (1) and EQ (4) and the experimental H(ω), A(ω) can be

Simple viscoelastic model fitting. A global fitting algorithm is used to fit simultaneously EQ (1) and EQ (4) to the FRF
and power spectrum of the data respectively. As mentioned previously, only frequencies above ~1 Hz in the FRF and
frequencies above ~200 Hz in the power spectrum are included in the fit (Supplementary Figure 1). Occasionally,
despite the addition of an extra pole compensating for the filtering effect observed when data acquisition was done with
downsampling (Supplementary Figure 1b, right), or direct sampling where filtering effect was not observed
(Supplementary Figure 1b, left), the FRF at higher frequencies showed the presence of an extra pole, causing a shift
in magnitude and phase. As the simple viscoelastic model did not include a term to correct for this shift, fitting of the
FRF was stopped before reaching these frequencies. The last point in the magnitude plot in Supplementary Figure 1a
left shows such a dip in magnitude, indicative of filtering at higher frequencies. Further experiments and quantification
of this phenomenon may help to isolate the source and correct the data above ~500 Hz allowing the higher frequencies
to be reliably obtained (frequencies past ~500 Hz were not included in this manuscript). A weight function was applied
to the FRF and power spectrum to account for the large difference in number of points (~11 for the FRF, and thousands
for the power spectrum). A second weight function was applied to the FRF to weight the magnitude response more
than the phase as the latter appeared to be more sensitive to sources of error. Each fit begins with an initial guess that
is manually found to be close to the solution and with tighter bounds to restrict the algorithm from finding a local
minimum in a completely separated region in the parameter space. A second fit is done based on the output of the first
fit with looser bounds.
Bootstrapping and cell mechanics model fitting. Bootstrapping with replacement is done by generating k numbers
randomly drawn from 1 to N. N is the total number of data sets per condition, and k is the minimum amount of data
available at any given frequency. For example, in the case of untreated WT, the number of data points available per
frequency varied from 14 to 17, due to slightly different excitation inputs. In that case, k = 14, and N = 17. This
bootstrapping is repeated 1000 times to obtain 1000 bootstrap samples. The mean of these samples is first manually
fit to either the power law or dynamic crosslinking model to obtain an initial guess of the parameters. Then, each
bootstrap sample is automatically fit to either models using the corresponding initial guess. Each bootstrap sample is
