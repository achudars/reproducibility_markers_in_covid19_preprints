Abstract

27

Chloroform (CF) is an environmental contaminant that can be naturally formed in various

28

environments ranging from forest soils to salt lakes. Here we investigated CF removal

potential in sediments obtained from hypersaline lakes in Western Australia. Reductive

30

dechlorination of CF to dichloromethane (DCM) was observed in enrichment cultures

31

derived from sediments of Lake Strawbridge, which has been reported as a natural

32

source of CF. The lack of CF removal in the abiotic control cultures without artificial

33

electron donors indicated that the observed CF removal is a biotic process. Metabolite

Introduction

57

Until the 1970s, halogenated organic compounds, organohalogens, were believed

58

to originate exclusively from anthropogenic sources (1). This long-held view was changed

59

following the discovery of diverse organohalogens from natural environments. To date,

60

over 5000 naturally occurring organohalogens have been identified (2). A remarkable

61

example is chloroform (trichloromethane, CF) which is

62

contaminant and a potential carcinogen that bioaccumulates and is harmful for living

63

organisms (3). CF is synthetically produced in chemical industries as an anesthetic, as an

64

intermediate for the production of refrigerants, and as a degreasing agent and fumigant

65

(4). However, anthropogenic sources were estimated to contribute to less than 10% of

66

the annual 700,000–820,000 tons global CF production (5). Natural CF emissions have

67

been reported from numerous terrestrial and aquatic environments such as forest soils

68

(6-9), rice fields (10), groundwater (11), oceans (12), and hypersaline lakes (13, 14).

69

Biotic and abiotic processes like burning of vegetation, chemical production by reactive

70

Fe species, and enzymatic halogenation can lead to natural production of CF (15). Similar

71

to other low molecular weight volatile organohalogens (VOX), CF release into the

72

atmosphere can cause ozone depletion and impact climate change (16).

a known environmental

73

CF is persistent in the environment and is hardly dechlorinated/degraded under

74

oxic conditions due to the three chlorine substitutes (17, 18). In contrast, microbial CF

75

transformation is often mediated by anaerobic microbes (19-23). Anaerobic CF

76

transformation has been reported to be mediated by acetogens like Acetobacterium

77

woodii (24) and Clostridium sp. (25), methanogenic Methanosarcina spp. (26-28), and

78

fermentative Pantoea spp. (23) producing dichloromethane (DCM), carbon monoxide (CO)

79

and/or carbon dioxide (CO2). This is a co-metabolic process for which the responsible

80

genes and enzymes are not yet clear. Previous studies indicated that co-metabolic CF

81

transformation was likely mediated by enzymes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway

82

and

83

cob(I)/cob(II)alamins and F430 (nickel(I)-porphinoid), that facilitate key enzymes of

86

nucleophilic reagents catalyzing nonspecific reductive dechlorination of chloromethanes

87

(30-32).

88

Another group of anaerobes known as organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) can

89

use CF as a terminal electron acceptor, and couple CF reductive dechlorination to energy

90

conservation (33, 34). For instance, CF respiration to DCM has been reported using

Desulfitobacterium

92

Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB (37, 38) and a mixed culture containing Dehalobacter

93

(21). The enzymes responsible for reductive dehalogenation in OHRB are mainly corrinoid

94

cofactor dependent reductive dehalogenases (RDases) such as a CF RDase (CfrA)

95

identified from Dehalobacter-containing microbial consortia (39). CF can also be

extreme environments is lacking. This information is necessary to understand whether

microbes can act as a filter for VOX in hypersaline environments that at least partly

prevent their release to the atmosphere. In this study, we prepared microcosms from the

114

The top (0-12 cm) and bottom (>12 cm) layer sediments of Lake Strawbridge

115

were slightly alkaline with a pH ranging from 8.2 to 8.5 whereas those of Lake Whurr

116

were acidic with a pH of 4.6–5.4 (Table 1). Salinity, water content and total organic

117

carbon (TOC) were higher in the top layer compared to the bottom layer for both lake

118

sediments (Table 1). Sodium (17.5–71.1 mg/g dry sediment) and chloride (31.9–123.5

119

mg/g dry sediment) were dominant among the cations and anions, respectively. Nitrate

120

and chlorate were neither detected in top- nor in bottom-layer sediments (Table 1).

121
122

CF dechlorination in enrichment cultures

123

No CF dechlorination was observed in the enrichment cultures with the sediment

124

from Lake Whurr after 70 days of incubation (data not shown), whereas CF was

125

reductively dechlorinated to DCM in the enrichment cultures with the sediment from Lake

126

Strawbridge (Fig. 1A–D). CM and methane as potential products of CF transformation

127

were not detected (data not shown), despite an evident lack in the mass balance

128

between CF disappearance and DCM production in sediment cultures and some transfer

129

cultures (Fig. 1A–F). The lack of methane production also suggested inhibition and/or

130

absence of methanogens. The fastest CF dechlorination rate (1.82 µmol/day/L) to DCM

131

was observed in the enrichment cultures with the bottom layer sediments from Lake

132

Strawbridge in the modified growth medium (MGM) medium (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these

133

cultures were selected to obtain sediment-free cultures in subsequent transfers (Fig. 1E–

134

G).

135

Adding vitamin B12 from 0.04 to 4 μM steadily increased CF dechlorination rates in

136

the sediment-free cultures (Fig. 2). For instance, in the cultures amended with 4 µM

137

vitamin B12, the CF dechlorination rate reached 31.9 µmol/day/L (Fig. 2E), ~30 times

138

higher

139

supplementation (~0.9 µmol/day/L) (Fig. 1E–G). In turn, increasing vitamin B12

140

concentration led to concurrent decrease of DCM accumulation. Accordingly, less than

141

30% of the CF was converted to DCM in the cultures amended with 4 µM vitamin B12

142

(Fig. 2E). No CF dechlorination was observed in the abiotic controls even in the presence

171

Dehalococcoides, Geobacter and Sulfurospirillum were not detected in the enrichment

cultures (data not shown).

173

Bacterial community analysis based on Illumina sequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA

174

gene V1–V2 region amplicons showed that Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and

175

Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla (cumulative relative abundance > 70%) in top

176

and bottom layer sediments of Lake Strawbridge (Fig. S3). The relative abundance of

177

Clostridiales and Halanaerobium (Firmicutes) increased from 5–16% (Clostridiales) and

178

3–7% (Halanaerobium) in the bottom layer sediments to ~67% and ~18%, respectively,

179

in the initial and subsequent transfer enrichment cultures (Fig. S3). The relative

180

abundance of Desulfovibrio, a genus within the Proteobacteria, increased from less than

181

0.1% to 0.3–8% in the initial and subsequent transfer enrichment cultures.

182
183

Metagenomic analysis

184

Binning of the assembled metagenome sequences allowed the reconstruction of

185

six near complete (>95%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) of Clostridiales

186

(bin1, bin3, bin4), Halanaerobium (bin2), Bacillus (bin5) and Desulfovibrio (bin6) (Table

187

S1) accounting for ~84–95% relative abundance in sediment-free cultures with and

188

without B12 (Fig. 4A). Desulfovibrio (bin6) was the most abundant MAG (45% relative

189

abundance) in the cultures without external B12 addition, which is different than the

190

results obtained from 16S rRNA gene based bacterial community analysis (0.4–9%

191

relative abundance) (Fig. S3). One reason for this might be the change of the growth

192

medium components in the sediment-free cultures used for metagenomic analysis that

193

contained glycerol as carbon source and lower amounts of yeast extract and peptone

194

compared to the cultures used for 16S rRNA gene analysis (Table S2, Fig. 4A). Except for

195

bin 4, the addition of vitamin B12 (4 µM) increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes

196

MAGs.

197

Reductive dehalogenase genes (rdh) were neither detected in the MAGs nor the

unbinned contigs (Fig. 4B). In contrast, most of the genes encoding enzymes from the

to be involved in co-metabolic chloroform transformation, were identified in different

201

MAGs (Fig. 4B). A notable exception was the absence of the acsB gene encoding acetyl-

202

CoA synthase, the signature gene of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (Fig. 4B).

203
204

Discussion

205

The present study showed CF dechlorination to DCM and CO2 in microcosms with

206

sediments from hypersaline Lake Strawbridge in Western Australia, which has previously

207

been shown to be a natural source of CF and CM (13). The lack of CF removal in the

208

abiotic control cultures without artificial electron donors (Ti(III) or DTT) indicated that

209

the CF removal in the sediment and sediment-free enrichment cultures is a biotic process

210

and at least needs cellular metabolism for electron donor generation. Known CF-respiring

211

bacteria such as Desulfitobacterium (35, 36) and Dehalobacter (38) were neither

212

detected in the sediment microcosms nor in the sediment-free cultures by qPCR (data

213

not shown) or 16S rRNA gene-targeted bacterial community analysis (Fig. S2, S3).

214

Moreover, rdh genes were not detected in any of the MAGs or unbinned contigs,

215

indicating that CF respiration by OHRB was unlikely.

216

Compared to the original sediment samples used for preparation of the

217

microcosms, relative abundance of the order Clostridiales was significantly increased in

218

the sediment and sediment-free enrichment cultures (Fig. S3). Acetogens belonging to

219

this order such as members of the genera Clostridium and Acetobacterium have

220

previously been shown to mediate co-metabolic CF dechlorination (24, 25, 47). For

221

instance, Clostridium sp. strain TCAIIB was shown to dechlorinate CF to DCM and

222

unidentified products (25), although underlying mechanisms remain unknown. One

Addition of extra vitamin B12 shifted the dominant CF transformation pathway

226

from reductive dechlorination to DCM, to oxidation to CO2 (Fig. 2, 3). This is in line with

227

previous studies using fermentative (23) and methanogenic enrichment cultures (20, 22,

228

50). CF oxidation was proposed to occur via the net hydrolysis of CF to CO (23, 24), but

229

the enzymes responsible for such a transformation have not been identified. Another

230

study suggested a possible role of vitamin B12-dependent Wood-Ljungdahl pathway

231

enzyme(s) in CF hydrolysis to CO (24). However, CF hydrolysis to CO was also observed

232

in non-acetogenic and fermentative Pantoea spp. amended with vitamin B12 (23),

233

indicating a possible role of other (vitamin B12-dependent) pathways in CF hydrolysis.

234

Except for the acetyl-CoA synthase gene, we detected all genes encoding enzymes

235

involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway as well as genes for cobalamin (enzymatic

236

cofactor for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)) biosynthesis and transport in

237

the Clostridiales MAGs (Fig. 4B). However, considering the slower CF transformation in

238

the sediment-free cultures (Fig. 1F) as opposed to the original cultures (Fig. 1B), these

239

MAGs were not likely (the main) vitamin B12 producers. Vitamin B12 producing

240

microorganisms likely decreased in the sediment-free enrichment cultures during the

241

enrichment process (Fig. S2, S3). In turn, the amount of CF (2―5 µmol/bottle or

242

50―100 µM) added in the enrichment cultures might have exceeded the toxic level for

243

many vitamin B12 producing bacteria and archaea. CF is known highly toxic for some

244

bacteria and archaea, and growth inhibition of acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic

245

archaea was noted at concentrations as low as 0.1 µM (20). Previous studies using the

246

sediments of lake Strawbridge reported natural CF production of ~0.017 µmol/kg dry

247

sediment (13), that may exert a negligible inhibitory effect on the vitamin B12 producing

248

microorganisms, suggesting a high molar ratio of vitamin B12 to CF in the sediment that

249

may mediate CF conversion to CO/CO2. The CO produced from CF could be further

250

oxidized to CO2 by CO dehydrogenase (CooS, Fig. 5) (50). We did not detect CO in the

251

enrichment cultures likely due to its rapid conversion to CO2.

252

Hypersaline lakes are among the major sources for VOX emissions on Earth (16).

253

In this study, we showed the potential of sediments from pristine hypersaline Lake

254

Strawbridge for CF transformation in cultures with moderate salinity (5%) and alkaline

255

condition (pH 8.5). One possibility is co-metabolic CF transformation through reductive

256

dechlorination and net hydrolysis (Fig. 5) likely mediated by acetogens and/or

257

fermentative bacteria as was proposed in studies using Acetobacterium woodii (51),

258

Clostridium sp. (not known for its acetogenic potential) (25) and Pantoea spp. (23). The

259

MAGs obtained in this study contained most of the genes encoding the de novo

260

cobalamin biosynthesis pathway, however, addition of external vitamin B12 was essential

261

for enhanced reductive dechlorination and net hydrolysis of CF to DCM and CO.

262

Cobalamin biosynthesis potential has been reported in metagenomic analyses of

263

hypersaline aquatic and terrestrial environments (52, 53). Enhanced CF transformation in

264

the presence of cobalamin indicates an important role of cobalamin not only in fulfilling

265

important ecosystem functions such as carbon processing and gene regulation, synthesis

266

of nucleotides and amino acids (54, 55), maintaining an abundant and diverse microbial

267

community (53), but also potential roles in reducing CF emission to the atmosphere.

pushing a polypropylene tube into the sediment. The top and the bottom of the tube

275

were immediately closed with rubber stoppers after pulling the core from the sediment.

276

The sediment samples were transported at 8°C to the Laboratory of Microbiology,

Physical-chemical analysis

280

The sediment cores were cut into a top (0–12 cm) and a bottom (12–24 cm) layer

281

in an anoxic chamber filled with an atmosphere of N2/H2 (96 : 4%). Subsamples from

282

each sediment layer were homogenized and subsequently used for physical-chemical

283

analysis and as inocula for enrichment set up. The remaining sediments were kept at -

284

80°C for molecular analysis. Water content was determined by the percentage of weight

285

loss observed after drying the samples overnight at 105°C in an oven followed by cooling

286

down to room temperature in a desiccator. pH was measured immediately and again

after two hours using a pH meter (ProLine B210, Oosterhout, The Netherlands) with air-

288

dried sediments suspended in 0.01 M CaCl2 solution. Sediment total organic carbon

289

(TOC) was measured using the Kurmies method (56). Low crystalline iron was extracted

from 0.5 g wet sediment for one hour in the dark using 25 ml of 0.5 M anoxic HCl (57),

291

and

292

spectrophotometric Ferrozine assay (58). Major anions including Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and

293

ClO3- were analysed using a Thermo Scientific Dionex™ ICS-2100 Ion Chromatography

294

System (Dionex ICS-2100). Major cations including Ca2+, K+, Mg2+ and Na+ were

295

measured using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES,

Due to dominant presence of halophilic microbes in hypersaline environments

301

(60), and in an attempt to find halophilic microbes capable of CF metabolism, two media

302

were used for halophilic bacteria and archaea enrichment: modified growth medium

303

(MGM) and DBCM2 medium (DBC) (61). The media were boiled and flushed with nitrogen

304

to remove oxygen. Na2S·9H2O (0.48 g/L) was added as the reducing reagent and

305

resazurin (0.005 g/L) was added as redox indicator. Tris-base (10 mM) and acetic acid

306

(10 mM) were used as the buffer for MGM and DBC media at high and low pH,

307

respectively. The salinity (5–20%) and pH (4.6–8.5) of the media were adjusted to the

308

corresponding values measured in the sediments used as inocula (Table 1, Table S2).

309

Initial sediment enrichment cultures were prepared in 50 ml serum bottles with

310

2.5 g wet sediment of either the top or bottom layer of lake sediments and 25 ml of

311

either MGM or DBC medium. The bottles were sealed with Teflon lined butyl rubber

312

stoppers, and the headspace was exchanged with N2 gas (140 kPa). CF was added to

313

each bottle at a nominal concentration of 1.25 µmol/bottle. All cultures were set up in

314

duplicate and incubated statically in the dark at 37°C. Of all cultures, the sediment

317

experiments. Sediment-free cultures were obtained by sequential transfers of this culture

318

(10% (v/v)) in duplicate in 120 ml bottles containing 50 ml MGM except that peptone

319

was decreased from 5 to 0.5 g/L and yeast extract was decreased from 1 to 0.5 g/L, and

320

glycerol (10 mM) and CF (2.5 µmol/bottle) was added as a carbon source. The sediment-

321

free cultures were used to test the influence of vitamin B12 (0.04, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 4 µM)

322

on CF (5 µmol/bottle) dechlorination. Abiotic controls for CF transformation were

323

performed in modified MGM with a decreased amount of peptone (0.5 g/L) and yeast

324

extract (0.5 g/L) and glycerol (10 mM), and amended with 4 µM vitamin B12 and 5

325

µmol/bottle CF, and the same inoculum that was autoclaved at 121°C for 30 min. In a

326

subset of abiotic controls, titanium(III) citrate (Ti(III), 5 mM) or DTT (100 mM) were

327

used as artificial electron donors (62, 63). To test CO2 production from CF,

341

a Stabilwax column (Cat. 10655-126, Restek Corporation, USA). The column was

with a CP-PoraBOND Q column (50 m × 0.32 mm ID, 5 um film thickness; Agilent

358

Technology, Netherlands) operated isothermally at 40°C using helium as a carrier gas at

359

a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Sample aliquots of 0.1–0.5 ml were injected at split ratios

DNA extraction

370

The sediment aliquots collected during start-up of the microcosms were thawed

371

and washed three times with 1.5 ml of 10 mM TE buffer (pH 7.0) to avoid interference of

372

the high salinity with the DNA extraction. For each sample, wet sediment (0.5 g) and the

373

washing buffer collected by filtration through a 0.22 µm membrane filter (Millipore, MP,

374

USA) were used for DNA extraction. DNA loss during washing was anticipated, but

375

washing was necessary to be able to extract enough DNA for further analysis (59). DNA

376

was extracted separately from the washed sediment and the biomass collected on the

377

membrane filter using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MO-BIO, USA) following the

378

manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts from the sediment and filters were combined

379

for each sample and used for molecular analysis. DNA of the sediment-free enrichment

380

cultures was extracted from 2 ml culture samples using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit.

381

For metagenome sequencing of the sediment-free cultures, 50 ml of culture was used for

Bacterial community analysis

395

16S rRNA gene based bacterial community analysis was performed on sediments

396

of Lake Strawbridge and the sediment derived enrichment cultures. Sediments from Lake

397

Whurr were not proceeded for bacterial community analysis because no CF dechlorination

398

was observed in the enrichment cultures with the sediments of Lake Whurr. The bacterial

399

community analysis was performed as follows: a 2-step PCR was applied to generate

400

barcoded amplicons from the V1–V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and the PCR

401

products were purified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (GATC-Biotech,

403

16S rRNA genes are listed in Table S3. Sequence processing was performed using NG-

404

Tax (66). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned using uclust (67) in an open

405

reference approach against the SILVA 16S rRNA gene reference database (LTPs128_SSU,

406

version 111) (68). Subsequently, a biological observation matrix (biom) file was

407

generated and sequence data was further analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into

Metagenomic analysis

411

Metagenome sequencing of duplicate sediment-free cultures with and without

412

addition of 4 µM vitamin B12 was performed using an Illumina HiSeq platform (PE 150

413

mode). Fastp v0.19.5 (70) was used for removing adapters and low quality reads.

414

Assembly for binning was done by metaSPAdes v3.11.1 (71) using the option-meta and

415

the trimmed reads. This assembly was used for binning with the Metawrap v1.2 pipeline

416

(docker version) (72). Two bin sets were created from the metagenome samples of

417

duplicate cultures with and without vitamin B12 with the bin_refinement module of

418

Metawrap on binners MaxBin2 (73), MetaBat2 (74) and Concoct (75) from the metawrap

419

binning module using the error corrected reads from SPAdes (71). The resulting two bin

420

sets were again run through the bin_refinement module of Metawrap resulting in one bin

421

set containing six bins and unbinned scaffolds. Raw abundance values were taken from

422

the quant_bins module of Metawrap to calculate relative abundances per each culture. A

423

heatmap was created with Python v3.7.3 (http://www.python.org) using pandas and

424

seaborn.

425

classification of the bins was done by pplacer (77) from CheckM. Annotation of the bins

426

was performed using the Rapid Annotation Subsystem Technology (RAST) (78).

Bin quality assessment was performed with CheckM

(76). Taxonomic
