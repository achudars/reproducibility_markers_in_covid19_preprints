Abstract

20

It is the enormous adaptive capacity of microorganisms, which is key to their competitive

21

success in nature, but also challenges antibiotic treatment of human diseases. To deal with a

22

diverse set of stresses, bacteria are able to reprogram gene expression using a wide variety of

23

transcription factors. Here, we focused on the MarR-type regulator MalR conserved in the

24

Corynebacterineae, including the prominent pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and

25

Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In several corynebacterial species, the malR gene forms an

26

operon with a gene encoding a universal stress protein (uspA). Chromatin-affinity purification

27

and sequencing (ChAP-Seq) analysis revealed that MalR binds more than 60 target promoters

28

in the C. glutamicum genome as well as in the large cryptic prophage CGP3. Overproduction

29

of MalR caused severe growth defects and an elongated cell morphology. ChAP-Seq data

30

combined with a global transcriptome analysis of the malR overexpression strain emphasized

31

a central role of MalR in cell envelope remodeling in response to environmental stresses.

32

Prominent MalR targets are for example involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and synthesis

33

of branched-chain fatty acids. Phenotypic microarrays suggest an altered sensitivity of a

34

ΔmalR mutant towards several β-lactam antibiotics. We furthermore revealed MalR as a

35

repressor of several prophage genes suggesting that MalR may be involved in the control of

36

stress-responsive induction of the large CGP3 element. In conclusion, our results emphasize

37

MalR as a regulator involved in stress-responsive remodeling of the cell envelope of C.

38

glutamicum and suggest a link between cell envelope stress and the control of phage gene

39

expression.

Importance

44

Bacteria live in changing environments that force the cells to be highly adaptive. The cell

45

envelope represents both, a barrier against harsh external conditions and an interaction

46

interface. The dynamic remodeling of the cell envelope as a response towards, e.g. antibiotic

47

treatment represents a major challenge in the treatment of diseases. Members of the MarR

48

family of regulators are known to contribute to an adaptation of bacterial cells towards

49

antibiotic stress. However, our knowledge on this adaptive response was so far restricted to a

50

small number of well-described target genes. In this study, we performed a genome-wide

51

profiling of DNA-binding of the MarR-type regulator MalR of C. glutamicum, which is

52

conserved in several coryne- and mycobacterial species. By binding to more than 60 different

53

target promoters, MalR is shaping a global reprogramming of gene expression conferring a

54

remodeling of the cell envelope in response to stress.

Introduction

57

In almost every natural habitat a high number of microbial species coexist and compete for

58

space and nutrients. In this competitive scenario, the exposure to bacteriostatic or

59

bactericidal compounds (antibiotics) represents a routine challenge which bacteria are facing

60

in various natural environments and particularly during infection of a specific host (1–3). A

61

prominent family of transcription factors involved in the reprogramming of gene expression in

62

response to stress conditions is the MarR-type family (4, 5). Already decades ago, clinical

63

isolates of Escherichia coli displaying a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype where found

64

to carry mutations in the marR locus (6) and subsequently drew considerable attention to this

65

ubiquitously found class of regulators. Following studies then showed that E. coli MarR is a

66

transcriptional repressor of genes conferring resistance towards different antibiotics, organic

67

solvents and lipophilic, mainly phenolic compounds (7). In further studies it was shown that

68

MarR-type regulators are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea, likely representing

69

an ancient regulator family which emerged before the evolutionary split of these domains

70

more than three billion years ago (8, 9). Overall, the regulatory responses modulated by

71

MarR-type regulators were grouped into three general categories (4), including (i)

72

environmental stress responses (e.g. triggered by antibiotics) (10–12), (ii) regulation of

73

virulence genes (13, 14) and (iii) degradation of lipophilic (often aromatic) compounds (15,

74

16). The DNA-binding domain of MarR-family regulators is typically comprised of a winged

75

helix-turn-helix domain recognizing palindromes or inverted repeats (17). In the classical

76

scenario, the dissociation of the MarR dimer from its genetic target is triggered by ligand

77

binding (e.g. antibiotics, salicylates, lipophilic compounds (18)), but also examples exist where

78

the binding of ligands fosters the association to DNA targets (15, 19).

79

The suborder of the Corynebacterineae covers several prominent pathogenic species, such as

80

Corynebacterium

81

causing millions of deaths every year. Species of this suborder share a very similar and unique

82

cell wall composition hampering antibiotic treatment (20–24). In addition to the

83

peptidoglycan, cells are surrounded by an arabinogalactan zone topped by a lipid bilayer

84

composed of long-chain α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids - the mycolic acids (25).

85

In this study, we have characterized the function of the MarR-type regulator MalR (Cg3315) of

86

the non-pathogenic, Gram-positive model organism C. glutamicum (26), which – in total -

87

harbors nine MarR-type regulators (27). Further, the genome of C. glutamicum contains a

88

large prophage element (CGP3) which was shown to be inducible by the cellular SOS response

89

(28) or excises spontaneously in a small fraction of wild type cells (29, 30).

90

C. glutamicum MalR was previously published as a repressor of the malE gene, encoding the

91

malic enzyme (31). Here, we performed a genome-wide profiling of MalR targets by

92

combining ChAP-Seq and a comparative transcriptomics approach. As revealed by phenotypic

93

microarrays, a mutant lacking the malR gene displayed an impaired resistance towards

94

different β-lactam antibiotics. The majority of former studies focused on a very distinct

95

operon or small regulon controlled by MarR-type regulators. The present study provides - for

96

the first time - a comprehensive insight into the complex regulon of MalR, which is involved in

97

the remodeling of the cell envelope in response to stress conditions. Interestingly, our data

98

also suggest a role of MalR in the control of the large prophage CGP3 and thereby

99

demonstrate a complex regulatory interaction between the host and horizontally-acquired

100

diphtheriae,

Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

and

Mycobacterium leprae

elements.

Results

102

The MarR-type regulator MalR is conserved in Corynebacteria and Mycobacteria

103

The MarR-type regulator MalR (Cg3315) was previously described as a repressor of the malic

104

enzyme gene in C. glutamicum (31). Sequence analysis revealed that MalR is conserved in

105

several coryne- and mycobacterial species also including the prominent pathogens

106

C. diphtheriae (57 % sequence identity) and M. leprae (40 % sequence identity). Simulated

107

secondary structures of MalR using Phyre2 disclosed a high similarity to the secondary

108

structure of MarR from E. coli consisting of six α-helices surrounding two β-sheets (32),

109

although the amino acid sequence identity is only 22% (Fig. S1).

110

In the genome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, malR is organized in an operon with a gene

111

encoding a universal stress protein (uspA) and divergently located to a small hypothetical

112

protein followed by an operon coding for a penicillin-binding protein and two putative

113

membrane proteins (Fig. 1) (33). This genomic ensemble emphasizes a role of MalR in global

114

stress responses and potentially cell envelope-related functions. The genome-wide analysis of

115

MalR target genes and its physiological impact is the aim of the present study.

116
117

Genome-wide profiling of MalR target genes

118

In order to identify target genes of MalR, ChAP-Seq analysis was performed and selected

119

target promoters were subsequently verified using electrophoretic mobility shift assays

120

(EMSA) (Fig. 2). To produce MalR at physiological levels, a gene fusion was integrated at the

121

malR locus into the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 chromosome, encoding a C-terminally strep-

122

tagged variant of MalR. Cells were grown in CGXII minimal medium with 2 % glucose and

123

harvested in the mid-exponential phase. The sequencing of DNA bound to MalR under the

124

chosen conditions revealed 66 binding regions in total (Fig. 2 A; Tab. S1) Remarkably, 13

125

target regions of MalR were found inside the cryptic prophage element CGP3 showing a local

126

maximum in the region cg1895-cg1950 (8 peaks). Besides several genes of unknown function,

127

MalR bound to promoter regions of genes involved in cell envelope biosynthesis, including

128

embC (34), the murAB operon (35) and ipsA (36). It further associates to promoter regions of

129

genes encoding for proteins involved in transport mechanisms, such as oppA, cg1454, cg2256

130

and cg2340.

131

Conspicuously, 16 peaks were detected in promoter region of genes coding for (putative)

132

secreted proteins. Consistent with the report of Krause and coworkers, also binding to the

133

promoter region of malE, was confirmed by our study (31). Furthermore, a significant binding

134

peak was observed in the own promoter region of the malR-uspA operon indicating an auto

135

regulation of malR expression. In summary, this ChAP-Seq analysis revealed a global role of

136

MalR in the regulation of genes involved in cell envelope-related functions and suggested a

137

regulatory interaction of MalR with the large prophage CGP3.

138

To validate the obtained binding profile of MalR, EMSAs were performed using different

139

promoter regions identified by ChAP-seq analysis (Fig. 2 B). Except one potential target

140

promoter (cg2962), every tested candidate could be verified using this in vitro approach (Fig.

141

S2). As a negative control, the promoter region of cg3402 (a putative copper chaperone) was

142

used. Here, no shift was detectable. In vitro, different migration patterns were observed for

143

the tested MalR targets, which likely reflect differences in binding affinities and/or the

144

presence of multiple DNA motifs. Furthermore, in some cases additional factors may

145

contribute to in vivo MalR-DNA association (e.g. in the case of cg2962).

146

Using the 66 MalR peak sequences, a putative binding motif of MalR was deduced using the

147

online tool MEME-ChIP (37). This tool predicted a very AT-rich palindromic binding motif

148

found in all peaks (motif and distribution in Fig. S3), which is very similar to the motif found in

149

MalR targets verified with EMSAs (Fig. 2 C).

150
151

Overproduction of MalR causes severe growth defects

152

In a next step, we compared the growth of the C. glutamicum wild type with a malR deletion

153

strain (ΔmalR) and a strain overexpressing the malR gene under control of the IPTG-inducible

154

Ptac promoter (Fig. 3). In fact, overexpression of malR caused a severe growth defect of

155

C. glutamicum grown on CGXII minimal medium with 2 % glucose (Fig. 3 A), whereas the

156

deletion mutant had only a minor impact on the growth rate compared to the wild type strain

157

under the tested conditions (Fig. 3 B).

158

Fluorescence microscopy of cells stained with NileRed (lipid components) and Hoechst 33342

159

(DNA) revealed a heterogeneous morphology of cells overexpressing the malR gene. Among

160

cells with wild type cell shape, several cells displayed a significantly elongated cell morphology

161

upon malR overexpression (Fig. 3 C). The deletion mutant, however, was indistinguishable

162

from the wild type strain (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, overexpression of malR resulted in an

163

uneven distribution of the lipid fraction as revealed by Nile red staining. The cloudy and

164

heterogeneous distribution of the Hoechst strain also pointed towards problems regarding

165

nucleoid condensation and segregation in the strain overexpressing malR. In order to quantify

166

the observed heterogeneous morphology of cells, culture samples were further analyzed

167

using a MultiSizer 3 particle counter (Fig. 3 D). These data show a clear shift of the cells

168

towards an increased cell volume.

169

The impact of altered MalR levels on transcription

170

The multitude of MalR-bound regions identified by ChAP-Seq analysis and the severe

171

morphological changes caused by overexpression of malR already suggest a significant impact

172

of MalR on the transcriptomic landscape of C. glutamicum. In the following, we performed a

173

comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild type containing the empty vector pEKEx2 and

174

the malR overexpressing strain using DNA microarrays. For this purpose, both strains were

175

grown in CGXII minimal medium and harvested in the exponential phase. Additionally, we

176

verified the obtained data using qRT-PCR with some selected samples (Fig. S4). As illustrated

177

in Figure 4, malR overexpression resulted in massive changes in the global transcriptome

178

when compared to the wild type. Overall, 170 genes showed a more than 5-fold altered

179

mRNA level (p-value < 0.05). A complete overview on the transcriptome analysis is provided in

180

Table S2.

181

Considering the impact of increased MalR levels on growth and cell morphology, a majority of

182

these effects are likely the result of secondary effects. To focus on primary targets of MalR,

183

we analyzed the impact on the expression of genes whose promoter was directly bound by

184

MalR as found via ChAP-Seq analysis (selection shown in Table 1; for a complete overview see

185

Table S1 and S2). In fact, many of the direct target genes of MalR revealed an altered mRNA

186

level due to the overexpression of malR. In several cases, however, the effect was rather

187

minor, which may be due to the chosen growth conditions lacking a specific effector molecule

188

of the regulator. Furthermore, the majority of target genes is likely controlled by several

189

regulatory systems impacting the transcriptional output.

190

Remarkably, many genes encoding for proteins involved in cell envelope biosynthesis or

191

remodeling were affected by malR overexpression. For example, the ipsA gene, encoding a

192

LacI-type regulator, showed an about 5-fold downregulation in the malR overexpression

193

strain. IpsA was previously described as an important regulator modulating the synthesis of

194

inositol-derived lipids in the cell wall of C. glutamicum (36). Cells lacking ipsA revealed an

195

elongated cell morphology with an affected growth. These findings are in line with the

196

phenotype of the MalR overproducing strain (Fig. 3 C). Among the genes repressed by MalR

197

are, furthermore, embC encoding an arabinosyltransferase involved in arabinan biosynthesis

198

(34, 38), and several (secreted) membrane proteins of unknown function (cg0623, cg0636,

199

cg0879, cg0952, cg1578, cg1910, cg3322). The most distinct downregulation was observed

200

for the malE gene coding for the malic enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of malate to

201

pyruvate. Pyruvate itself is a precursor for acetyl-CoA synthesis, a precursor molecule for fatty

202

acid synthesis.

203

Among the genes showing a slightly increased expression in response to malR expression we

204

found, for example, ilvA encoding a threonine-dehydratase that is necessary for the

205

production of isoleucine (39). Isoleucine is a branched chain amino acid and, together with

206

acetyl-CoA, an important precursor for the generation of branched chain fatty acids, which

207

are part of the bacterial cell membrane. Furthermore, the oppA gene, coding for an

208

oligopeptide permease required for the modulation of cell-wall associated lipids as well as

209

mycolic acids (40), was slightly upregulated as well. Also, the expression level of

210

methyltransferase mraW was about 3-fold increased. In E. coli, MraW was described to play

211

an important role during cell division (41).

212

Among the direct targets of MalR, we also found the gene murB, which is involved in the

213

synthesis of peptidoglycan building blocks by converting UDP-N-acetylglucosamine partially to

214

UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (42). However, its mRNA level was almost unaffected by malR

215

overexpression, suggesting that further regulatory components are involved in the control of

216

the murAB operon. Altogether, ChAP-Seq analysis, the impact of MalR on cell morphology and

217

this transcriptomic study strongly emphasize an important role of MalR in the remodeling of

218

the cell envelope.

220

MalR affects the cell surface structure of C. glutamicum

221

Considering the impact of MalR on cell morphology (Fig. 3 C) we analyzed cells overproducing

222

MalR using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

223

(Fig. 5). Both approaches suggested differences in the cell surface structure. While wild type

224

cells show a rather homogenous distribution in size, the strain overexpressing malR displayed

225

an elongated cell morphology and significant heterogeneity with regard to cell size (Fig. 3 C

226

and Fig. 5). Moreover, the overall cell surface structure appeared smoother. The fuzzy

227

structure observed by TEM is also typical for the outer layer of the mycobacterial envelope

228

(23). This electron-dense layer consists of a protein-carbohydrate matrix with only a few lipids

229

(21).

230
231

MalR confers increased resistance towards β-lactam antibiotics

232

For a better understanding of the physiological impact of MalR, we performed phenotypic

233

microarrays of the wild type and the ΔmalR mutant using a Biolog system. Here, we focused

234

on the plates PM1 and PM2A (carbon sources), PM4 (phosphorus and sulfur sources), PM9

235

(osmolytes), PM10 (pH), and PM11-PM13 (antibiotics). The only additives that led to a

236

different behavior between the wild type and the malR deletion strain were antibiotics. To be

237

precise, different β-lactams, tetracyclines and other examples of different substance classes

238

revealed an altered metabolic activity of the ΔmalR mutant (Tab. S4). Figure 6 shows four

239

examples, emphasizing a significantly increased sensitivity of the mutant towards different

240

cephalosporines. Whereas the wild type was able to tolerate the antibiotics at moderate

241

levels (Amoxicillin: 3 µg / ml; Cefazolin: 0.58 µg / ml; Cephalothin: 6 µg / ml; Cefuroxime: 1.2

242

µg/ / ml), the ΔmalR strain was significantly affected and did not restore metabolic activity

within 40 hours under the tested conditions. An overview of all tested plates is provided in

244

Figure S6.

246

MalR counteracts SOS-dependent induction of the CGP3 prophage

247

Due to several binding sites inside the CGP3 region, an impact of MalR on the inducibility of

248

this large cryptic prophage was the focus of further experiments. For this purpose the

249

reporter strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13032::Plys-eyfp carrying the malR overexpression plasmid

250

pEKEx2-malR was used. The Plys-eyfp reporter enables the visualization of prophage induction

251

within single cells by the production of the fluorescent protein eYFP (30). In the following, we

252

triggered an induction of the cellular SOS response by the addition of the DNA-damaging

253

agent Mitomycin C (MMC) and monitored its impact on CGP3 induction. The MalR level was

254

modulated by adding increasing amounts of IPTG (10 µM, 25 µM, 50 µM). Remarkably, the

255

fraction of CGP3 induced cells significantly declined in response to malR overexpression (Fig. 7

256

B). Also the growth of the strains was severely affected upon addiction of MMC and IPTG (Fig.

257

7 A). The dose responsive behavior of prophage induction in response to malR overexpression

258

may suggest that MalR counteracts prophage excision under the tested conditions.

Discussion

261

With this study, we provided a comprehensive insight into the complex regulon of the MarR-

262

type regulator MalR in C. glutamicum. In the last decades, members of this regulator family

263

were rewarded with considerable attention as some MarR proteins were shown to contribute

264

to a so-called multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype (5, 7). In several cases, MarR-type

265

regulators were described to control a small set of target genes, often located in the same

266

operon or in divergent orientation to the regulator gene on the chromosome (7). The

267

resulting phenotype of increased antibiotic resistance was previously proposed to be a result

268

of decreased influx and increased efflux of the toxic compound. In this study, we now

269

provided a genome scale profiling of MalR binding and identified more than 60 promoter

270

regions bound by this regulator. A combination of ChAP-Seq analysis and comparative

271

transcriptomics emphasizes MalR as a global regulator of stress-responsive remodeling of the

272

cell envelope. Remarkably, MalR is conserved in several species of the genera

273

Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium also including prominent pathogens like C. diphtheriae

274

and M. leprae. Conspicuously, the genomic organization of the malR locus in C. diphtheriae is

275

almost identical to C. glutamicum, where malR forms an operon with a gene (uspA) encoding

276

a universal stress protein (26). The superfamily of Usp proteins comprises a large group of

277

conserved proteins that can be found in all domains of life (43). In M. bovis BCG, the

278

tuberculosis vaccine strain, overexpression of a particular Usp led to an increased

279

susceptibility of the cells towards the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid (44). This conserved

280

genomic organization of the malR locus in these species is in favor with a similar role of

281

C. diphtheriae MalR in cell envelope remodeling and antibiotic resistance in this important

282

human pathogen.

283

The effector molecule of MalR was so far not identified, but based on our findings, we can

284

speculate that MalR binding is affected by one or several antibiotics and/or lipophilic

285

compounds causing cell envelope stress.

286

The genome of C. glutamicum comprises in total nine MarR-type transcriptional regulators;

287

four of which were already characterized in former studies. Except MalR, for none of the

288

previously studied examples an impact on antibiotic resistance phenotype was reported so

289

far. RosR, which constitutes a hydrogen peroxide sensitive regulator, was shown to play an

291

regulator PhdR was shown to act as a repressor of the phd gene cluster important for

292

phenylpropanoid utilization in C. glutamicum. Here, phenylpropanoids or their degradation

293

intermediates were shown to cause dissociation of PhdR and derepression of the respective

294

target operon (46). Finally, the isoprenoid pyrophosphate-dependent regulator CrtR was

295

recently described as being involved in the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis and thus

296

represents an example for a rather specialized MarR-type regulator (47). MalR itself was

297

firstly reported by Krause et al. as a repressor of the malE gene encoding an

298

NADP+-dependent malic enzyme in C. glutamicum (31). This role is supported by our study,

299

where malE was among the genes most affected by MalR overexpression. MalE catalyzes the

300

decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate while generating NADPH (48). Pyruvate, a precursor for

301

acetyl-CoA synthesis, as well as NADPH as reducing agent, are required for fatty acid

302

biosynthesis (49). For different oleaginous microorganisms it is known, that malic enzymes

303

play a crucial role in lipid generation (50–52). For example, two malic enzymes were recently

304

shown to be important for triacylglycerol and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor

305

(53).

306

Genome-wide profiling of MalR-bound DNA using ChAP-Seq analysis, unraveled more than 60

307

direct target genes and operons in addition to malE. Thus, the global impact of MalR ranges

308

from peptidoglycan biosynthesis (murA-murB (42)), to the synthesis of arabinogalactan (embC

309

(34)), and cell wall associated lipids and mycolic acids (e.g. via oppA and ipsA). For example,

310

the oppA gene codes for an oligopeptide permease, which was further characterized in

311

M. tuberculosis (40). Flores-Valdez and others could show that OppA is required for the

312

modulation of cell-wall associated lipids as well as mycolic acids. The LacI-type regulator IpsA,

313

which is itself repressed by MalR, was previously shown to trigger the expression of the ino1

314

gene encoding the inositol phosphate synthase. Deletion of ipsA resulted in a severe decrease

315

of inositol-derived lipids and an abolished mycothiol biosynthesis (36). Remarkably, a ΔipsA

316

mutant features a similar cell morphology as a malR overexpression suggesting that some

317

phenotypic effects may be indirectly resulting from reduced IpsA levels (Fig. 3 C). An overview

318

on the function of selected MalR targets is provided in the model shown in Figure 8.

319

A role in cell envelope remodeling appears to be a common theme in the family of MarR

320

regulators. For example, the MarR-type regulator SlyA was shown control several targets

321

impacting cell envelope composition, some of which have direct implications on the

322

resistance of Salmonella enterica towards antibiotics (e.g. polymyxins) or virulence (54). The

323

regulator Rv1404 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also shown to contribute to an

324

adaptation of the cells to the host environment by enhancing the acid-tolerance of this

325

bacterium (55). Altogether, these examples emphasize different roles of MarR-type

326

regulators. Whereas some proteins appear to conduct very distinct regulatory functions, like

327

the control of a certain catabolic gene cluster, others (like MalR or SlyA) act as global

328

regulators orchestrating complex adaptive strategies in response to environmental stresses.

329

A further prominent target of MalR appeared to be the cryptic prophage element CGP3. MalR

330

bound to overall 13 regions within the CGP3 element and overexpression of the malR gene

331

counteracted CGP3 induction upon addition of the SOS inducing antibiotic mitomycin C. So

332

far, little is known about the role of MarR-type regulators in the control of horizontally

333

acquired elements. In Bacillus subtilis, a pamR deficient strain displayed altered expression of

334

prophage genes, however the precise regulatory impact remained unclear (56). Another

335

example is depicted by RovA, which is a MarR-type transcription factor in E. coli, Yersinia

336

pseudotuberculosis and its homologue SlyA from Salmonella (57). Former studies revealed

337

that RovA and SlyA act as countersilencers of H-NS target promoters controlling genes

338

impacting virulence in Yersinia and Salmonella species (54, 58–60). We previously reported on

339

the xenogeneic silencer CgpS, which plays a crucial role in the silencing of the CGP3 island by

340

binding to AT-rich DNA (61). MalR itself binds to an AT-rich palindromic motif whose

341

composition, of course, increases the likelihood of an overrepresentation in horizontally-

342

acquired regions. However, the precise regulatory impact of MalR on CGP3 activation remains

343

unclear. The observed reduction of CGP3 induction in response to malR overexpression

344

speaks against a countersilencing mechanism as reported for RovA. In contrast, the majority

345

of phage targets appeared to be repressed by MalR. In physiological terms, a repressive

346

function of MalR towards CGP3 genes could be overcome by the presence of an effector

347

molecule leading to a dissociation of a putative MalR dimer. So, we could speculate on a role

348

of MalR in stress-responsive induction of the CGP3 prophage, which could literally leave the

349

“sinking ship” when the life of its host is threatened by harsh environmental conditions.

350

With this study, we provide a comprehensive overview on the many targets controlled by

351

MalR and suggest an important function of this MarR-type regulator in the coordinated

352

control of genes with an impact on cell envelope composition. The relevance of this global

353

response is reflected by the severely increased sensitivity of a malR mutant to several

354

β-lactam antibiotics and is further supported by several other cases where members of this

355

family contributed to enhanced antibiotic resistance (7, 11, 13, 54). We have gained a first

356

glimpse on a complex adaptive response. However, many - if not most - of the MalR targets

357

encode proteins of unknown function. For several others only very limited data are available.

358

So, many more studies are needed to understand the molecular principles behind this

359

adaptive response. With the multitude of targets identified in this study, we provide a starting

360

point for further studies aiming to enhance our understanding of bacterial adaptation to

361

stress.

Material and Methods

364

Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions

365

All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 2. For cloning and

366

plasmid construction the strain E. coli DH5α was used, whereas the strain E. coli BL21 was

367

used for protein production. These strains were – unless stated otherwise – cultivated in

368

lysogeny broth (LB, (62)) containing 50 µg/ml Kanamycin. Corynebacterium glutamicum

369

ATCC 13032 was used as a wild type strain (26). All derived C. glutamicum strains were

370

cultivated in brain heart infusion medium (BHI, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) or in

371

CGXII minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose (63); if necessary 25 µg/ml Kanamycin

372

was added.

373

Growth experiments were conducted in the BioLector microbioreactor system (m2p labs,

374

Baesweiler, Germany) (64). Therefore, 750 µl CGXII medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose and

375

the particular stated additives (e.g. Isopropyl β–D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)) were

376

inoculated to an OD600 of 1 in 48-well microtiter plates (Flowerplates, m2p labs) and

377

cultivated for at least 24 h at 30°C and 1200 rpm shaking frequency. Fluorescence as well as

378

backscatter measurements were taken every 15 minutes.

379
380

Recombinant DNA work and construction of chromosomal insertions or deletions

381

All standard laboratory methods (PCR, DNA restriction, Gibson Assembly) were performed

382

according to standard protocols and manufacturer’s instructions (62, 65). The used

383

oligonucleotides as well as details regarding the plasmid construction are provided in the

384

supplementary information (Tab. S3 A and S3 B).

385

For chromosomal integration or deletion, a two-step homologous recombination system

386

based on the suicide vector pk19mobsacB was used (66, 67). This vector contained 500 bps of

387

each site flanking the targeted sequence in the genome of C. glutamicum.

388
389

Chromatin Affinity Purification and next generation sequencing (ChAP-Seq)

390

Pre-cultures for ChAP-Seq were conducted like described above. As a main-culture,

391

C. glutamicum ATCC 13032::malR-strep was grown in CGXII medium containing 2% (w/v)

392

glucose for 5 hours at 30°C and 120 rpm shaking frequency. The subsequent preparation of

393

ChAP-Seq samples and the implementation of this method was conducted as described by

394

Pfeifer et al. (61).

395
396

Protein purification

397

MalR with a C-terminal Strep-tag was heterologously produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3),

398

transformed with pET24b-malR-C-strep. Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37°C as

399

described above. Subsequently, the protein production was induced using 100 µM IPTG and

400

the cultivation was continued for 5 h at 16°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15

401

min at 5300 x g and 4°C and the pellets were snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. For cell

402

disruption the pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM

403

EDTA, pH 8.0) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). This cell

404

suspension was then treated with a French pressure cell for three passages at 172MPa. Cell

405

debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 5300 x g and 4°C and a subsequent

406

ultracentrifugation for 1h at 150,000 x g and 4°C. The tagged protein was then purified with a

407

1-ml bed volume Strep-Tactin-Sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany), following the

408

manufacturer’s protocol.

409

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays

410

The investigation of the binding properties of MalR and as an in vitro verification of the results

411

obtained by ChAP-seq analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed.

412

Therefore 100 bp DNA fragments centering the peak maximum of each particular promoter

413

region were amplified using PCR (oligonucleotide sequences are given in the supplementary

414

informations, Tab. S3 C) and analyzed and purified using an agarose gel with subsequent gel

415

extraction with the “PCR clean-up and Gel extraction” Kit from Macherey-Nagel (Düren,

416

Germany). A total of 90 ng of DNA per lane was incubated with different molar excesses of

417

purified MalR protein (3-fold and 10-fold molar excess) for 30 min in bandshift-buffer (50 mM

418

Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5). Subsequently, samples were

419

separated using a 10% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (61).

420
421

Transcriptome analysis using DNA Microarrays

422

To analyze the global transcriptomic alterations triggered by an overexpression of malR

423

C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 cells harboring either the empty vector pEKEx2 or the

424

overexpression plasmid pEKEx2-malR were cultivated in CGXII medium containing

425

2% (w/v) glucose and 100 µM IPTG as described previously. Subsequently, total RNA of these

426

cultures was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the

427

manufacturers protocol. The cDNA labeling, and the DNA microarray analysis was performed

428

as described previously (68). The array data have been deposited in the GEO database

429

(http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under the accession number: GSE116655.

433

above. Measurement of differential gene expression was conducted using a qTower 2.2

434

(Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) with the Luna® Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England

435

Biolabs, Ipswitch, USA). Primer pairs used for the analysis are listed in Table S3 D. For all

436

samples 100 ng of total RNA were used as a template and all measurements were performed

437

in biological as well as in technical duplicates. The Ct-values of the samples were obtained

438

using qPCR-soft 3.1 (Analytik Jena). Subsequently, the relative transcriptional changes were

439

calculated using the following equation:

440

ΔCt = ΔCt(sample) - ΔCt(control)

441

Relative transcriptional change = 2- ΔCt

442
443

Fluorescence microscopy and staining

444

For microscopic analysis, cells were cultivated in CGXII medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose

445

(as described above) and grown for 24 h at 30°C. Lipids were stained with Nile red and DNA

446

was stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). Therefore 10 µl of the

447

cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 x g and the pellet was resuspended in

448

500 µl PBS containing 100 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 and 250 ng/ml Nile red. The cells were

449

incubated for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently analyzed microscopically using

450

an AxioImager M2 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm camera and a

451

Plan-Apochromat 100x, 1.40 Oil phase contrast oil-immersion objective. Fluorescence was

452

measured using the 63 HE filter for Nile red fluorescence and the filter set 49 for Hoechst

453

fluorescence.

454

The optimal exposure time for the different fluorescence images was determined with the

455

automatic measurement option of the AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging

456

GmbH) and the pictures were analyzed with the same software.

457

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy

458

For scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cells were treated as

459

described previously (69). Further details on the cultivation preparation procedure are given

460

in the supplementary information.

461
462

Cell counting and determination of the cell size

463

Cell counts and biovolume were analyzed using a MultiSizer 3 particle counter (70) equipped

464

with a 30 μm capillary in volumetric control mode. For the measurement, cells were grown

465

for 24 hours as described above and afterwards diluted to an OD600 ≤ 0.025 in CASYton buffer

466

(Schärfe Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Only particles sizing from 0.633 µm to 18 µm were

467

analyzed.

469

Phenotypic analysis of C. glutamicum ΔmalR and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032

470

Phenotypical characterization of the strains C. glutamicum ΔmalR and C. glutamicum

471

ATCC 13032 was performed using the Phenotypic MicroArrays from BIOLOG (Biolog Inc.,

472

Hayward, CA, USA). Both strains were compared regarding their respiratory activity in the

473

presence of various carbon sources (PM1, PM2), phosphorus and sulfur sources (PM4),

474

different osmolytes (PM9), pH-values (PM10) and antibiotics (PM11, PM12, PM13).

475

Experimental setup was carried out as described in the BIOLOG protocol for analysis of

476

Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive bacteria (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). In short,

477

both strains were grown overnight at 30°C on blood agar plates. Cells were inoculated in the

478

different PM-media containing 1% (v/v) of the redox dye (dye mix F) to a turbidity of 81%

479

transmittance. Afterwards each well of the PM-plates was filled with 100 µl of the

480

corresponding inoculation medium. Phenotypic MicroArrays were analyzed using the

481

OmniLog incubator (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) at 30°C for 48 hours with a measuring rate

482

of 15 minutes. Data visualization was performed by the BIOLOG software OM_Pl_Par 1.20.02

483

for parametric analyses. For selected examples GraphPad Prism 7 was used for visualization.

484

An overview of all results is shown in Figure S6.

485
486

Flow cytometric analysis

487

The CGP3 prophage induction was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of a C. glutamicum

488

strain harboring a genomically integrated prophage reporter (ATCC 13032::Plys-eyfp) using a

489

BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were cultivated in

490

CGXII medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose (as described above) and grown for 25 h at 30°C.

491

As appropriate, different concentrations of IPTG (10 µM, 25 µM and 50 µM) as well as 600

492

nM Mitomycin C were used. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a 488 nm laser

493

and a 530/30 nm filter for measuring eYFP fluorescence. In total, 100,000 events were

494

analyzed per sample and data was analyzed using BD Accuri C6 software and visualized using

495

GraphPad Prism 7. The gating was performed according to the uninduced negative control.

Figure 2: Genome-wide binding profile and in vitro verification of binding sites of MalR. (A)

740

ChAP-Seq experiments revealed 66 distinct binding peaks of MalR in the genome of C.

741

glutamicum ATCC 13032. For ChAP-Seq analysis, a strain containing a genomically encoded

742

Strep-tagged variant of MalR was grown in CGXII medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose for 5

743

hours and treated as described previously (75). The coverage of MalR-bound DNA regions

744

(red) was normalized using a rolling mean with a step size of 10 bp and a window size of 50

745

bp. The grey bar marks the CGP3 prophage region inside of the genome of C. glutamicum.

746

Overall, 66 peaks with coverages higher than 3-fold mean coverage were detected. (B)

747

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed to verify binding of MalR to

748

promoter regions identified via ChAP-Seq. Therefore, 100 bp DNA fragments (50 bp up- and

749

downstream the peak maximum) were incubated without protein (first lane), with 3 molar

750

excess (228 nM, second lane) and 10 molar excess of purified MalR (760 nM, third lane). A

751

complete overview on all tested fragment is shown in Fig. S2 A. (C) DNA sequences of 16

752

binding sites that were verified using EMSAs were used to deduce a possible binding motif of

753

MalR with the online tool MEME-ChIP (48). A motif based on all peaks obtained by ChAP-Seq,

754

as well as the distribution of the motifs within the uploaded sequences, are shown in Fig. S3.

100 µM IPTG using a microbioreactor cultivation system. (B) Growth of C. glutamicum ATCC

760

13032 in comparison to a strain lacking the malR gene. (C) For microscopic analysis, cells were

761

grown in CGXII medium for 24 h at 30°C. Shown are wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 cells

762

(row 1), C. glutamicum ΔmalR cells (row 2) and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 cells carrying the

763

over expression vector pEKEx2-malR (row 2). The expression of malR is induced by the

764

addition of 100 µM IPTG. Lipid components of the cell membrane were stained with Nile red

765

(red); DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). The scale bars represent 5 μm. Further

766

microscopic pictures of cells overproducing MalR are shown in Fig. S5. (D) To quantify the

767

number of cells with an altered morphology, cell counts and biovolume were analyzed using a

768

MultiSizer 3 particle counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) equipped with a 30 µm capillary in

769

volumentric control mode.

phenotypic microarrays. An OmniLog System from Biolog (Hayward CA, USA) was used to

787

perform phenotypic microarrays with wild type C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 as well as the

788

malR deletion strain. The experiments (PM1, PM2A, PM4, PM9, PM10, PM11, PM12, and

789

PM13) were conducted like described in the protocol of the manufacturer (75) (42). One

790

group of different tested conditions that led to a difference in respiration of wild type cells

791

and ΔmalR cells were the cephalosporins (Amoxicillin: 3 µg/ml; Cefazolin: 0.58 µg/ml;

792

Cephalothin: 6 µg/ml; Cefuroxime: 1.2 µg/ml).

C. glutamicum ATCC 13032::Plys-eyfp cells containing the plasmid pEKEx2-malR were

796

cultivated in CGXII minimal medium containing 2 % (w/v) glucose (+ 25 µM Kanamycin) using

797

a microbioreactor cultivation system. CGP3 induction was triggered by addition of 600 nM

798

mitomycin C (MMC). For the negative control no MMC was added. Additionally, different

799

concentrations of IPTG (0-50 µM) were used to induce expression of malR. Both, MMC and

800

IPTG, were added directly at the beginning of the cultivation (0 h). Under the applied

801

conditions, we analyzed the strain with regard to growth (A). Furthermore, the fraction of
