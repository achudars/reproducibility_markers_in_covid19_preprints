Abstract
Several studies have mined short-read RNA sequencing datasets to identify lncRNAs,

and others have focused on the function of individual lncRNA in abiotic stress

response. However, our understanding of the complement, function and origin of

long-non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) response to abiotic stress, especially transposon

derived lncRNA (TE-lncRNA), is still in its infancy. To discover and study lncRNAs in

Zea mays ssp. mays), we utilized a dataset of 127 RNA sequencing samples

maize (

that included PacBio fl-cDNA and total RNA-Seq datasets. Overall, we identified

23,309 candidate lncRNAs, 60% of which were identified in polyadenylated (polyA+)

samples. The majority (65%) of the 23,309 lncRNAs had sequence similarity to

transposable elements (TEs). Most had similarity to long-terminal-repeat

retrotransposons from the

Copia and Gypsy superfamilies, representing the high

proportion of these elements in the genome, but class II, DNA transposons were

enriched for lncRNAs relative to their genomic representation by 2-fold. By assessing

the fraction of lncRNAs that respond to abiotic stresses like heat, cold, salt and

drought, we identified 1,077 differentially expressed lncRNA transcripts. Their

2

expression was correlated (r =0.48) with their nearest gene, suggesting that lncRNAs

are subject to some of the

cis regulatory features as neighboring genes. By inferring

co-expression networks across our large dataset, we found that 39 lncRNAs act as

major hubs in co-expression networks, of which 18 appeared to be derived from TEs.

These results suggest that lncRNAs, especially TE-lncRNAs, may play key regulatory

roles in moderating abiotic responses.

Background
The functional component of any genome extends beyond its protein coding

sequences. Much of the additional function is encoded by RNAs, which vary in size

from small RNAs (sRNAs) of< 25 nucleotides (nt) in length, to tRNAs of 70 to ~90 nt in

length, to an even larger class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are

typically defined as being longer than 200 nt and containing no more than one short

(< 100 amino acids) open reading frame [1].

lncRNAs represent a stunning proportion of transcriptional products. In mice, for

example, an early study cataloged ~34,000 lncRNAs, representing one-third of all

polyadenylated cDNAs[2]. More recent work has annotated ~14,000 lncRNAs in

humans[3]. Work in plants has lagged somewhat behind, but plant lncRNAs have

been identified based on various kinds of high throughput expression data. For

example, microarrays have been used to detect 6,480 lncRNAs from

Arabidopsis

thaliana[4];single-stranded RNA sequence data have led to the identification of
2,224 lncRNA transcripts in rice (

Oryza sativa) [5]; and total RNAseq data have been

employed to detect 7,245 lncRNAs in maize (

At least three general properties of lncRNAs have become apparent from studies of

both plants

and animals. The first is

that many lncRNAs are polyadenylated and

capped, suggesting that they are transcribed and processed similarly to mRNAs [7].

coding genes, but with precise spatio-temporal patterns [3, 7–13]. A third general

property is that some lncRNAs overlap with coding regions and sometimes contain

parts of an exon; however, most originate from intergenic spaces (and these are

(2013) determined that 75% of human lncRNAs contained regions that appear to be

derived from TEs.

Just as the origin and structures of lncRNAs are diverse, they play similarly varied

functional roles. One major role is to act as templates for sRNA production, which in

turn often contribute toward the epigenetic silencing of TEs [14, 15]. Some lncRNAs

perform

other

key

functions,

especially

regulatory

roles

in

cellular

and

developmental processes [3, 16]. In plants, for example, lncRNAs have been shown

to affect functions as diverse as phosphate signaling [17], flowering time [18], and

susceptibility to pathogens [19]. Consistent with the hypothesis that lncRNAs play

important regulatory roles, some lncRNAs are conserved among species and appear

to be under purifying selection[3, 20, 21].

A growing body of evidence also points to a potential role for plant lncRNAs in

responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. A few studies have identified

Arabidopsis

lncRNAs that respond to salt, drought, heat and cold stresses, as well as phosphate

starvation [22–24]. The expression of 28% (1,832 of 6,480) of

Arabidopsis lncRNAs

was found to be significantly altered under biotic and/or abiotic stresses [4]. These

findings – i.e., that lncRNAs are associated with stress responses – are particularly

important in the context of crop species, because abiotic stresses affect crop yield

and quality [13, 25–29]. However, the identification of lncRNAs during crop stress

response remains largely unexplored, with a few notable exceptions. For example,

637 nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs and 664 drought-responsive lncRNAs have been

identified in maize seedlings [6, 30]. Similarly, 1,010 and 1,503 lncRNAs are known to

be differentially expressed under abiotic stress in rice and in chickpea [31].An

important but challenging issue is to discover lncRNAs that are associated with

abiotic stress responses and then to determine which lncRNAs function as key

regulators, which serve as sRNA templates and which represent transcriptional

noise.

Here we identify lncRNAs that relate to abiotic stress responses in maize. Our work

extends previous maize lncRNA studies in at least three ways [6, 8, 30]. First, our

efforts to detect lncRNAs are based on more expansive data. To perform lncRNA

discovery, we have amassed 127 RNAseq datasets that were generated by different

methods, in different tissues and across developmental stages, with a large subset

generated in abiotic stress experiments, including salt, drought, heat, cold, UV and

ozone stresses. The data include 89 RNAseq samples based on Illumina sequencing,

36 RNAseq datasets based on PacbioIsoSeq experiments, and two Illumina RNAseq

datasets

that were based on total

RNA to

potentially detect non-polyadenylated

RNAs. Second, we investigate the relationship between TEs and lncRNAs. More than

85% of the maize genome consists of DNA derived from TEs [32], and we therefore

expressed under abiotic stress to begin to narrow the set of candidates that function

in stress response. We futher investigate co-expression of lncRNAs with neighboring

genes within expression networks to further narrow a candidate list of potentially

functional lncRNAs [33, 34]. Bringing these diverse analyses together, we identify

several lncRNAs that are hubs in coexpression networks relative to abiotic stress

responses, including lncRNAs derived from TEs.

Results
Construction of transcripts and lncRNA discovery
To discover lncRNAs and examine their expression during abiotic stress, we used 89

RNAseq samples, 2 total RNA-Seq samples and 36 Pacbio Iso-Seq samples. For the

Illumina datasets, we extracted and cleaned ~305 Gb of sequence data; on average

92.1% of Illumina reads per sample aligned successfully to the maize B73 v4

reference sequence[35]. Aligned reads from each Illumina sample were merged. We

also collected and cleaned ~1.98 Gb of IsoSeq sequences, aligned them to the B73

reference, and collapsed them for a total of 17,673 loci with 43,774 transcripts. We

then combined the Illumina RNAseq and PacBio IsoSeq data based on alignment of

contigs to the reference, ultimately identifying a non-redundant set of 77,172 loci

with 95,523 transcripts (Figure S1). Among these, 19,449 transcripts that were found

only in the total RNA sample, representing potential polyA- lncRNAs. The set of

95,523 transcripts consisted of both coding transcripts and potential lncRNA

transcripts. To identify the latter, we used a pipeline based on a combination of

annotation programs and Pfam analyses (see Methods). Of the 95,523 assembled

transcripts, CPC2 annotation identified 31,967 non-coding transcripts (CPC2

scoreO<O-1), and 41,839 transcripts were deemed to be noncoding based on CNCI

analysis. Of these two sets, 26,099 transcripts were longer than 200 bp and were

predicted to be non-coding by both CPC2 and CNCI. These were further filtered by: i)

comparing them to the Pfam database, retaining only those transcripts without a

match (Blast, Evalue>1e-05) and

ii) FPKM filtration, based on our requirement that

FPKM had to exceed 1 in least one sample. The final dataset, which we consider high

confidence lncRNAs, consisted of 23,309 transcripts (Table 1; Figure S1),

representing 24% of the total (23,309/95,523). The average length of these

candidate lncRNAs was 382 bp. None had an ORF > 100 amino acids in length, as per

our definition of lncRNAs (see Methods), but most (95.15%) had one ORF. Among the

23,309 lncRNA candidates, 59.3% (or 13,822 transcripts) were identified from

polyadenylated (polyA+) RNAseq samples, and the remaining 40.7% (or 9,487

transcripts) were from total RNA samples, representing potential polyA- transcripts

(Table 1; hereafter we refer to lncRNAs from total RNAs as polyA- for simplicity). A

file containing all the identified lncRNAs sequences, along with their genomic

locations, is provided in DataS1.

The 23,309 lncRNAs were widely distributed across the 10 maize chromosomes

(Figure S2). We also examined their location relative to annotated coding sequences

within the maize genome. As expected from our search strategy, most lncRNAs

(87.9%; 20,499 of 23,309) were intergenic, based on the output (a U class code) from

gff compare. Only 185 lncRNAs were found to be intronic, with 29 and 156 as polyA-

and polyA+ (Table 1). The remaining high confidence lncRNAs corresponded to, or

overlapped with, previously annotated lncRNAs in the B73 v4 reference (Table 1).

Among the 20,499 lincRNAs, 44.7% (or 9,153 of 20,499) were from total RNA

datasets (i.e, potentially polyA-), representing a significant enrichment for lncRNAs

within the total RNA samples (Pearson

χ-squared; p < 0.001).

Most lncRNAs are derived from transposable elements

paper

provided few details about the relationship between TEs and lncRNAs, such as the TE

superfamilies that have contributed to lncRNAs or the proportion length of individual

lncRNAs that can be attributed to TEs.

To identify which lncRNAs may be derived from a TE, we masked regions of our

23,309 high-confidence lncRNAs using a species-specific TE library (see Materials and

Methods). Overall, we found that 65.69% lncRNAs (15,312 of 23,309) overlapped

with known maize TEs, which is a proportion similar to the previous maize study

based on fewer lncRNAs [8]. Most (61%, or 9,341 of 15,312) TE-lncRNAs showed

similarity to TEs over

≥90% of their length (Figure 1A). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the

proportion of polyA- lncRNAs that were masked by TE sequence was higher than that

of polyA+ lncRNAs (79.26% vs. 56.37%), which is a significant difference (

p< 1e-5)

(Figure 1B). Hereafter we refer to lncRNAs with sequence similarity to TEs as “TE-

lncRNAs”.

We further investigated the superfamily of TEs that were similar to the 15,312 TE-

lncRNAs. We found that 86% had sequence similarity to Long Terminal Repeat

retrotransposons of the

Gypsy and Copia superfamilies (Table 2) and also that some

of these TE-lncRNAs exceeded 3,750 bp in length (Figure 1C). A much smaller

proportion of TE-lncRNAs were derived from DNA transposons (Table 2); the longest

of these were shorter than the longest TE-lncRNAs with similarity to

Gypsy and Copia

elements (Figure 1C).

These observations raise an interesting question: Do LTR/Gypsy and LTR/Copia

elements give rise to lncRNAs more often than expected, given their proportion of

the genome? To address this question, we estimated the proportion length among

all annotated TEs that were attributable to

LTR/Gypsy, LTR/Copia and other element

superfamilies, based on RepeatMasker analyses. We then compared these

percentages to the proportion length among inferred TE-lncRNAs (Table 2). We

found, for example, that

LTR/Gypsy elements produced TE-lncRNAs at roughly the

expected proportion (61% vs. 59%), relative to their representation in the genome.

However,

LTR/Copia elements contributed TE-lncRNAs at a lower proportion than

their proportion length among annotated TEs (22% vs. 33%). Particularly notable is

the fact that class II DNA elements produced TE-lncRNAs in our dataset at ~2-fold

higher rate (12% vs. 6%) than expected based on their total length among TEs in the

genome (Table 2).

Differential expression under abiotic stress
One general feature of lncRNAs is that they are expressed at lower levels than

protein coding genes, and they are often expressed tissue specifically [3, 6, 8, 23, 38,

39]. We assessed the expression levels of coding and lncRNA transcripts based on

their maximum FKPM across all of our 129 datasets and then averaged these

maximum levels across transcripts. The results indicate that lncRNAs are expressed

at lower levels than coding RNAs (Figure 2A), with coding regions expressed at three-

fold higher levels, on average, than non-TE-lncRNAs (average FPKM: 12.57 vs. 4.30)

and six-fold higher levels, on average, than TE-lncRNAs (average FPKM: 12.57 vs.

2.04).

We next sought to identify coding genes and lncRNAs that were differentially

expressed under abiotic stress. To do so, we contrasted treatment versus control

RNAseq samples. For example, the RNAseq data from V3 consisted of two control

8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801704; this version posted October 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

samples and two replicated treatment samples from each of four stresses (salt,

drought, heat and cold) (Table S1). Accordingly, we contrasted each stress treatment

to the control, for a total of four contrasts in the V3 stage. Extending this approach

to the V4 and V6 stages across all the RNAseq data, we performed a total of 12

contrasts (Table S1). These contrasts identified numerous differentially expressed

coding genes and lncRNAs (Table 3). The various treatments identified ~2000 up- or

down-regulated coding transcripts, on average, and a set of 1,077 non-redundant

lncRNAs that were either up- and down-regulated across treatments.

Among the 1,077 non-redundant lncRNA transcripts, many were differentially

expressed in two or more treatments. For example, 679 lncRNAs were identified as

differentially expressed across V3-V6 stages under heat treatment (Table 3; Figure

2C; Table S3, Figure S3). Of these, 29 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in all

three developmental stages, and 79, 214 and 232 lncRNAs were specific to the V3,

V4 and V6 stages, respectively. Interestingly, 40.50% (32/79) heat-responsive

lncRNAs at V3 stage, 26.17% (56/214) heat-responsive lncRNAs at V4 and 42.67%

(99/232) heat-responsive lncRNAs at V6 were also differentially expressed in

response to other stress treatments, but not shared among developmental stages.

These patterns implicate many of the lncRNAs in general abiotic stress responses,

but they also imply that these responses have temporal (i.e., developmental)

specificity.

Interestingly, 529 non-redundant TE-lncRNAs were differentially expressed under

one or fewer conditions. The proportion of differentially expressed TE-lncRNAs was

lower than the proportion of all lncRNAs; TE-lncRNAs were 65% of the total

proportion of lncRNAs, but constituted only 45% and 56% of up- and down-regulated

lncRNAs. Most of the differentially expressed TE-lncRNAs had similarity to

and

LTR/Gypsy

LTR/Copia, as expected, but other TE families also contributed to differentially

expressed TE-lncRNAs. For example, MSTRG.32907 exhibited similarities to LINE

elements, MSTRG.73329 was similar to DNA/hAT-Ac elements, and MSTRG.37644

was an LTR/Gypsy elements. All of these were differentially expressed in the V3

stage, but in different treatments (heat, cold and salt, respectively) (Figure 4).

lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in

cis regulation of neighboring genes. To

investigate this possibility, we examined the correlation in expression between

lncRNAs and their closest neighboring gene in either the 5’ or 3’ direction, yielding a

dataset of 1077 differentially expressed lncRNAs and their neighboring genes. The

r

lncRNAs were strongly ( =0.48), and highly significantly (

p< 2e-16) correlated with

the expression of their closest neighboring gene (Figure 2B), suggesting that lncRNAs

may either be involved in

cis regulation or are subject to some of the same cis

regulatory features as their neighboring genes.

Co-expression modules associated with stress responses
Compared to coding genes and microRNAs, the function of lncRNAs in abiotic stress

response remains largely unknown. Computational construction of gene co-

expression networks can be a valuable tool for linking lncRNAs and coding RNAs and

also for beginning to infer potential biological functions, because

co-expressed genes are often members of the same pathway or protein complexes,

are often either functionally related, or are controlled by the same transcriptional

regulatory program [33, 40–42].

We used the 89 Illumina RNA-seq datasets to build co-expression networks (see

Methods and Table S1). WGCNA analyses identified 40 modules that comprise

various nodes in the network. Of the 40 inferred modules, 16 were significantly

correlated with stress treatments (Figure 3, Figure S4, Table S3, S4). These 16

contained 7,221 transcripts including 408 lncRNAs, of which 171 were TE-lncRNAs.

Most of the 16 modules were associated with a single stress and developmental

stage, but some were correlated with two or more stresses or stages (Figure 3). For

example, the ME_darkgreen module was highly correlated with drought at the V3

stage (

r

2

=0.76,

p<4e-18), but it was also significantly correlated with salt stress at the
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801704; this version posted October 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

V3 (

r2=0.21, p<0.05) and V4 (r2=0.29, p<0.005) stages. Similarly, the ME_salmon

module correlated with drought (

and salt stress at the V4 stage (

r2=0.25, p<0.02) and salt stresses (r2=0.45, p<1e-05)

r2=0.38, p<3e-04). Complete correlation information

between modules and stress conditions and developmental stages are provided in

Figure S4.

Recent work uncovered a temporal transcriptional logic underlying nitrogen (N)

signaling in

Arabidopsis [43]; we see similar logic based on developmental timing for

abiotic stress responses. Consider the example of heat stress: the ME_tan module

2

was correlated with V3 heat stress (r =0.89,

2

correlated with V4 heat stresses (r =0.96,

2

(r =0.43,

p<4e-32), the ME_yellow module

p<1e-49), and the ME_darkturquoise

p<2e-05) and ME_pink (r2=0.49, p<1e-06) modules were associated with

heat in the V6 stage. These data suggest a developmental cascade of heat-

responsive modules. To illustrate this graphically, we arranged the 16 associated

modules by stress and development stage. Like heat stress, cold and drought stress

were both associated with distinct modules at different developmental stages. There

were exceptions, however, as both salt and UV stress associated with two modules

in the V4 stage (Figure 3).

Among the 16 significant modules, the most lncRNAs were associated with the

2

ME_yellow module, which correlated with heat stress in the V4 stage (r =0.96,

p<1e-

49) and contained 147 lncRNAs and 65 TE-lncRNAs. Figure 4 details the expression

pattern of this and other stress related modules. Given these modules, it is possible

to extract the eigengenes from modules to infer function. For example, the

eigengenes for the ME_yellow module were assigned into GO categories related to

‘response to heat’, ‘response to high light intensity’, ‘heat acclimation, response to

radiation’, ‘regulation of seedling development’ and ‘ER-nucleus signaling pathway’.

2

The ME_darkturquoise (r =0.43,

p<2e-05) and ME_pink (r2=0.49, p<1e-06) modules

were also associated with heat stress but in a later development stage (V6). These

two modules contained 52 lncRNAs and 16 TE-lncRNAs, and their eigengenes

exhibited significant enrichment of the GO terms ‘intracellular ribonucleoprotein

complex’, ‘HslUV protease complex’, ‘cytoplasmic translation’ and ‘intracellular

membrane-bounded organelle’ (Table S5-S7). Overall, GO-inferred functions helped

to verify that the modules reflect aspects of the stress response.

LncRNAs are hubs in modules
An interesting facet of the 16 stress-associated modules is that each contained both

lncRNAs and TE-lncRNAs. We have mentioned that the ME_yellow module contained

the most lncRNAs of the 16 modules, with 147 lncRNAs and 65 TE-lncRNAs, but other

modules were similar in containing lncRNAs. For example, the ME_tan module,

which is associated heat stress in V3, contained 26 lncRNAs and 9 TE-lncRNAs. An

important question concerns the role of these lncRNAs in expression networks. One

role, which is suggested by our results (Figure 2B), is that some of the lncRNAs in

modules are co-expressed with genes due to

however, that lncRNAs regulate genes in

cis interactions. It is also possible,

trans. To investigate this possibility, we

screened for key ‘hubs’, which we defined by high connectivity (i.e., intramodular

connectivity within the top 10% of all members of the module), membership > 0.9

and high significance (

p< 0.01) in the module. Based on these filters, we identified

670 hubs that included 39 lncRNAs from different stress-responsive modules (Table

S4), of which 18 were TE-lncRNAs.

Considering the heat-responsive modules as an example, the 3 associated modules

had 27 lncRNAs as hubs, out of 225 total lncRNAs, with 12 of the 27 categorized as

TE-lncRNA. The 27 hub lncRNAs included transcript TE-lncRNAs such as

MSTRG.32907 (TE-lncRNA, LINE/L1,

LTR/Gypsy,

p< 1.78E-04), MSTRG.35709(TE-lncRNA,

p< 2.59E-114), MSTRG.44074 (TE-lncRNA, DNA/hAT-Ac, p<2.11E-19) and

MSTRG.37268 (TE-lncRNA, DNA/CMC-EnSpm,

p<1.63E-08). In Figure 4, we illustrate

the expression patterns of three of the top-ranked hubs within the heat-stress

associated modules, with the top-ranked hubs for the other five abiotic stresses in

Figures S5-9. All of these hubs are expressed under stress and demonstrate high

intramodular connectivity.

Many hubs in co-expression networks are known to belong to transcription factors

(TF) of families such as TCP, AP2/EREBP, MYB, WRKY, NAC, bZIP [44–47]. We found

interactions and potential crosstalk between lncRNAs and stress-responsive TFs from

these families. In the heat-responsive modules, for example, hub lncRNAs such as

MSTRG.32907, MSTRG.36825 and MSTRG.30107 and MSTRG.35709 were connected

to TF families such as TCP, NAC, Dof and bHLH, which are known to respond to

abiotic stress from previous studies (Figure 5)[48–50].

These results suggest the possibility that lncRNAs – and more specifically, some TE-

lncRNAs – act to regulate abiotic stress responses. If they play a functional role, one

would expect them to be conserved over evolutionary time. We tested this idea by

blasting each of the 39 hub lncRNAs to an evolutionary gradient of genomes that

included sorghum, rice and

10

Arabidopsis (Table S8). Of the 39, 16 had strong hits (e <

-15

) to sorghum, a close relative to maize, and 4 of these 16 were TE-lncRNAs.

Three of the hub lncRNAs had hits to rice, but zero of the TE-lncRNAs had rice hits.

None of the 39 hub lncRNAs had significant hits to

Arabidopsis. Overall, these results

suggest that ~10% these lncRNAs have been conserved since the divergence of rice

and maize, roughly 50 million years ago [51], and that 39% have been conserved

since the divergence between sorghum and maize, roughly 16 million years ago [52].

Reliability of gene Expression via qRT-PCR
To verify the reliability of the RNA-seq experiments, a set of independent biological

replicates of heat treatment in maize B73 at the stage of

three-leaves stage were

subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to confirm the expression

changes.

Ten transcripts including seven lncRNAs and three coding genes were randomly

selected for qPCR. Among them, six genes were significantly up-regulated, four

genes were significantly down-regulated under heat stress. The results showed a

high degree of consistency for the product sizes between RNA-Seq and qRT-

PCR(Figure6, Table S9).

Discussion
In this study, we accumulated and mined an expansive dataset to identify lncRNAs in

maize, particularly those that are expressed in response to abiotic stress.

Bioinformatic analyses led to the identification of 23,309 lncRNAs, the largest

collection yet identified from maize. We characterized these lncRNAs with respect to

three features:

i) their prevalence and origins, especially lncRNAs that appear to be

derived from TEs,

effect, and

ii) their expression levels and patterns, including a detectable cis-

iii) their potential for functioning in abiotic stress response, as inferred

from the construction of co-expression networks.

lncRNA identification and characterization
By its very nature, lncRNA discovery is limited by a number of factors. It is first, of

course, limited by the definition of lncRNAs that have been used in the literature –

i.e., an RNA molecular > 200 bp with at most one ORF or overlapping exon of < 100

codons [1]. Following precedence, we have adopted this definition for lncRNA

discovery, but it bears remembering that some of these could in fact be translated

because they contain short ORFs. A second limitation is the fact that our search

strategy did not include lncRNAs that overlapped with (or contained) an annotated

exon. We applied this limitation purposefully, to avoid mis-classification based on

fragmented RNA molecules or contigs. For that reason, however, our work likely

underrepresents lncRNAs derived from genes and so some of our estimates may be

inaccurate. For example, if many lncRNAs are derived from genic regions, then our

estimate of the proportion of lncRNAs that are derived from TE-lncRNAs is an

overestimate. It is worth noting, however, that our estimate of the proportion of TE-

lncRNAs (65%) is similar to a previous maize study that estimated 68% of lncRNAs

were derived from TEs [8]. A third limitation is that the completeness of lncRNA

discovery relies critically on the number of tissue and developmental samples that

are available. With the exception of

A. thaliana, for which lncRNA discovery was

based on 2000 microarray transcriptomes, most plant studies have been limited to

only a handful of samples, suggesting that there is still much to learn about the

lncRNA complement within and among plant species. To date, the most RNAseq

samples use for lncRNA discovery in maize has been 30 [8]; hence, our study has

greatly expanded lncRNA discovery in this important crop.

Our RNA datasets were highly enriched for polyadenylated (polyA+) transcripts,

because it consisted of 36 PacBio fl-cDNA datasets, 89 RNAseq datasets and only two

total RNA datasets. Nonetheless, fully 44% of intergenic lncRNAs were identified

from the total RNA data, representing a disproportionately large number relative to

polyA+ data. This observation superficially suggests that far more lncRNAs are polyA-

, which is an important point to consider when one considers that most – but not all

[6, 53, 54] – lncRNA surveys in plants have relied solely on RNAseq samples and not

total RNA samples. Previous work has also suggested that the ratio of polyA- and

polyA+ lncRNAs may be a function of growth conditions and external stresses (Yuan

et al., 2018). A fuller understanding of lncRNAs may require more substantial

investments in total RNA datasets.

Most lncRNAs are TE-lncRNAs
Given our identification of 23,309 lncRNAs, we next sought to characterize their loci

of origin and particularly to identify those that likely originated from TEs. We found

that ~65% (15,312) of lncRNAs contained similarity to known TEs. Of these, most

(61%, 9341 of 15312) were similar to TEs over >90% of their length, suggesting they

were derived solely from TEs. As we noted above, our estimates of the proportion of

TE-lncRNAs could be too high, based on our search strategy. However, it is also not

surprising that we identified a high proportion of TE-lncRNAs, for at least three

reasons. First, previous studies in mammals have demonstrated that most lincRNAs

derive from TEs [7, 36]. Second, the maize genome is replete with TEs, with >85% of

15

the genome estimated to consist of DNA derived from TEs [32]. Finally, an important

function of lncRNAs is to be precursors for small RNAs, which in turn contribute to TE

silencing via sequence homology [8, 55–57].

We also investigated the TE families from which TE-lncRNAs originated. Most of the

TE-lncRNAs were derived from

LTR/Gypsy and LTR/Copia families (Table 2), reflecting

their preponderance in the maize genome [32, 57]. lncRNAs derived from

LTR/Gypsy

elements were represented in a similar proportion to their genomic proportion (by

length) among the TEs we investigated in our study (Table 2). However,

LTR/Copia

elements were underrepresented in the TE-lncRNA dataset relative to their

combined lengths in the genome, 22% versus 33%. This suggests that

elements do not produce lncRNAs as readily as

LTR/Copia

LTR/Gypsy elements, at least within

our data. The reasons for the difference between

LTR/Copia and LTR/Gypsy are

presently unclear, but one can consider two broad categories: TE age and TE

location. For the former, older elements might be expected to be in a deeply-

silenced epigenetic state that relies primarily on the maintenance of methylation

during cell division rather than an active epigenetic response that enlists

lncRNAs[58]. For the latter, one might expect

LTR/Copia elements to be in genomic

locations that are transcribed. In fact, however, the opposite is true, because

LTR/Gypsy elements tend to be concentrated in pericentromeric regions [32] where
there may be less active transcription and less ongoing silencing. In contrast,

LTR/Copia elements tend to accumulate preferentially in euchromatic regions[32]
that tend to be more transcriptionally active. Class II DNA elements also tend to be

located near genes and euchromatic regions, but unlike

LTR/Copia elements they

produce lncRNAs at about a 2-fold higher than implied by their genomic lengths

(Table 2). To sum: we have shown that TE superfamilies over- and under-produce

lncRNAs relative to their genomic representation based on our extensive collection

of datasets, but the ultimate causes of these differences remain unclear.

Levels and patterns of lncRNA expression
16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/801704; this version posted October 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Several previous papers from both plants and animals have shown that lncRNAs tend

to be expressed at lower levels than

bona fide genes and that they also tend to show

tissue-specific patterns of expression [3, 7–12]. We have verified the former by

recording the maximum FPKM for each lncRNA transcript across datasets; on

average, lncRNAs are expressed at 4-fold lower levels than genic transcripts by this

metric (Figure 2A). Unfortunately, we cannot verify that lncRNAs have more tissue

specific expression than genes, because the bulk of our data were isolated from

leaves. We can, however, verify that they have lower entropy than genes, on

average (Average Shannon Entropy = 2.10 for coding genes vs. 1.13 for lncRNAS),

because the lncRNAs consistently lack expression evidence under more conditions.

Of the 13,822 polyA+ lncRNAs, we found that 1,077 (7.79%) were differentially

expressed under stress conditions, including 529 TE-lncRNAs. These TE-lncRNAs

provided an opportunity to assess whether they could be linked to the expression of

nearby genes, indicating some sort of

cis-regulatory pattern, as has been observed in
2

other species [20, 59, 60]. TE-lncRNAs were significantly correlated (r =0.48;

p< 2.0e-

16) with their nearest neighboring genes (Figure 2B), suggesting that TE-lncRNAs

may either be involved in

cis regulation or are subject to some of the same cis

regulatory features as their neighboring genes, such as open chromatin structure.

lncRNAs, abiotic stress and coexpression modules
This study was designed specifically to identify stress-responsive lncRNAs. We

approached this problem in two ways. We first identified differentially regulated

lncRNAs from a series of controlled experiments for heat, cold, drought and salt

stress. Comparing the stress treatment to their corresponding control across 12

different contrasts, we identified 1,077 lncRNAs with evidence for differential

expression. This observation corroborates previous studies in suggesting that

lncRNAs may be differentially regulated under stress [6, 22–24, 30, 31], but it

provides no indication whether the differentially regulated lncRNAs are a byproduct

of stress responses or play a functional role. There is, however, a large gap between

17

observing differential expression and proving function. As a first step toward

bridging this gap, we have built co-expression networks based on both coding RNAs

and lncRNAs from 89 RNAseq datasets, yielding a total of 40 co-expression modules.

Of these, 16 were significantly associated with stress responses, and GO annotations

of these modules were generally consistent with their inferred response functions.

One interesting facet of these 16 modules is that they demonstrate clear patterns

across developmental time (Figure 3), suggesting that temporal hierarchies are

important for plant responses to environmental stress.

It is difficult to infer function from co-expression modules [61], but studies have

shown that genes with high connectedness tend to be functionally essential [62,

63]. We were therefore particularly interested whether any of our lncRNAs are

included within co-expression networks and particularly whether they are ‘hubs’

within network modules. Of the 16 modules that were significantly associated with

stress responses, we identified 670 hubs, many of which corresponded to genes

from known transcription factor families (Figure 5). Of these 670 hubs, 39 were

lncRNA transcripts. These represent our best candidates for lncRNAs that function in

stress response, potentially as

trans-acting regulatory factors. Consistent with this

last conjecture, several of these lncRNA hubs were connected to genes from known

TF factors [48–50]. Moreover, ~10% these lncRNAs yield strong blast hits to rice,

suggesting some measure of evolutionary conservation consistent with functional

constraint, at least for this subset.

One somewhat surprising finding is that 18 of the 39 lncRNA hubs are related in

sequence to – and perhaps derived from - TEs. This observation raises the intriguing

idea that TE exaptation can occur at the level of lncRNAs. It is now well known that

TE exaptation contributes to many aspects of genome function, including protein

coding genes and especially functional regulatory elements [64–66]. The location of

TE-lncRNAs as hubs, along with their connectedness to known TFs, suggests that a

small subset of TE-derived lncRNAs may function as

18

trans-acting regulatory factors in

maize. If true, these hubs appear to have been recruited recently, given that only

four of 16 yield strong hits to the sorghum genome. Clearly additional work is

required to prove that these TE-lncRNAs function as hypothesized in abiotic

response, but their centrality in co-expression modules is nonetheless an intriguing

result that is consistent with previous findings showing that most lncRNAs are

derived from TEs [7] and that lncRNAs can play central regulatory roles in plant and

animal development [64].

Methods
Sample collection
In this study, we gathered 36 Pacbio (Pacific Biosciences) Isoseq datasets that were

sampled from different tissues [67] and 91 illumina RNAseq datasets that were

sampled from leaves of maize B73 [6, 68–70] (Table S1, Figure S1). Of the Illumina

datasets, 89 represented polyA+ transcripts and two were based on total RNA, which

includes putative polyA- transcripts. The datasets were used for three purposes:

lncRNA discovery, differential gene expression analyses, and the inference of gene

co-expression networks. All of the 127 datasets were used for lncRNA discovery. A

subset of 71 of the 91 RNAseq datasets were employed for differential gene

expression analyses (Table S1); these included replicated control and treatment

samples from experiments that tested the effects of drought, salt, heat, cold, UV and

ozone treatments on gene expression. Finally, all of the 89 polyA+ illumine RNAseq

datasets were used for inferring gene co-expression networks. The 89 Illumina

datasets represented a developmental series sampled from V3, V4 and V6 seedlings;

we take advantage of this developmental series in some network analyses (Table S1,

Figure S1).

Data processing and alignment
Raw data were converted into the FASTQ-formatted file by the Fastq-dump program

from the SRA Toolkit (https://github.com/ncbi/sratoolkit). For Illumina data, the

19

SolexaQA++ v3.1 program [71] was employed for quality trimming, using the Q20

value. After trimming, any reads < 50 bp were removed. Cleaned reads were then

aligned to the B73 reference genome sequence (v4, http://plants.ensembl.org) using

the STAR aligner program [72] with default parameters. Aligned reads were

assembled into transcripts by the StringTie program, using the RABT (reference

annotation-based transcript) assembly algorithm [73]. For the Pacbio IsoSeq data,

reads were aligned to the B73 reference genome using the Minimap2 program [74].

Unique isoforms were collapsed, based on genome alignment by Cupcake ToFU

(https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake). Subsequently, the assembled

transcripts from Illumina RNAseq and PacbioIsoSeq were merged using StringTie,

which yielded a non-redundant unified set of transcripts.

Computational identification of intergenic and intronic lncRNAs
To find lncRNAs, a strict computational strategy was performed as described by Lv

et. al (2016) that and consisted of four steps. First, non-redundant transcripts were

submitted to annotation programs to evaluate their coding potential. We used two

annotation programs – CPC2[75]and CNCI[76] – and focused on transcripts that were

identified as having no coding potential by both programs as candidate lncRNAs.

Second, we submitted candidates to the Pfam database using Pfam_scan script

(ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/), which aligns transcripts with Hmmer[77].

We filtered out any transcripts that aligned to known protein families at an

Evalue<1e-05.

Third, we compared the remaining transcripts to reference

annotations using gffcompare[78], which outputs various codes to designate the

relationship of transcripts to annotated coding regions. We retained transcripts with

class codes “i”, which indicates that a transcript is fully contained within a reference

intron, and “u”, which designates transcripts that are not obviously related to known

coding regions, for further analyses. This last step is likely to miss some sense and

anti-sense lncRNAs that derive from coding regions but also limit false positives

based on incompletely assembled coding transcripts. Finally, we retained transcripts

as high confidence lncRNAs if they passed all of the previous four steps, if they were

longer than 200bp, and if they had an FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model

per million reads mapped) > 1 in at least one of our sample datasets. To determine

the relationship of high-confidence lncRNAs to TEs, we masked the lncRNA

sequences to identify TE domains. Masking was based on the maize-specific library

of Repbase database (www.girinst.org) and was performed by RepeatMasker

(www.repeatmasker.org).

Gene expression analyses
We performed two separate types of analyses based on gene and lncRNA expression

data. The first analysis was differential expression analysis based on comparisons

between stress and control data (Table S1). To perform these analyses, high quality

reads were aligned to the B73 reference using the STAR program [72]. For reads that

mapped to multiple locations, we removed alignment reads with a mapping quality

<20, based on SAMTools [79]. Raw counts were quantified using the featureCounts

program [80], and the FPKM value per gene was calculated using a custom Perl

script. The DESeq2 package [81] was used to perform pairwise comparisons between

samples to identify differentially expressed transcripts. To identify differentially

expressed genes (DEG), we relied on two criteria: the Log2(fold change) had to be >1

and the adjusted p-value from DEseq analyses had to be

p-adj<0.05.

The second type of analysis was the inference of co-expression networks. To

construct networks, expression profiles were extracted from each gene and lncRNA,

and expression levels were normalized using variance stabilizing transformation in

DESeq2 [81]. Co-expression correlations among lncRNAs and genes were based on

2

Pearson correlations with R O≥O0.8 across the 89 RNAseq datasets.

An unsigned co-

expression network was inferred using the WGCNA package[82] with an optimal soft

thresholdO=O12. Modules within the network were assigned using Topological

Overlap Matrix (TOM). The correlations between modules and stress treatments

were calculated and plotted, and then the significant stress-responsive modules

were extracted for further analysis Co-expressed networks were visualized by the

Gephi program [83].

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis
The eigengene probes of each stress-responsive module were assigned putative

functions by searching against the UniProt protein database [84].

Searching was

based on using the Blastx program [85], using a cut-off e-valueO≤O1e-10.

Coding

eigengenes were then submitted to the AgriGO v2 online toolkit [86] for gene

ontology term enrichment. A Fisher’s exact test was applied for the enrichment

analysis and the

p value was adjusted using the Bonferroni method, with an

experiment-wide significance level of 0.05.

lncRNA across datasets. B) The correlation (log2(Fold Change)) of TE -lncRNAs and the

indicated in the graph. C) This figure reports the number of differentially expressed lncRNAs

under different stress conditions and developmental stages. The blue histogram on the left

shows how many lncRNAs were differentially expressed under different conditions.

The red

histogram, coupled with the dot plot below, represent the distribution of differentially

expressed lncRNAs among stress and stages. For example, the blue graph on the left

indicates that 187 lncRNAs were differentially expressed under heat stress in V3. Of these,

38 were detected only under heat stress, as indicated by the graph in red, while 21 were

differentially expressed under heat stress at both the V3 and V4 stages and 11 were

differentially expressed under heat stress at both the V3 and V6 stages.

developmental stages. The scale of the heat map reflects the level of correlation ( )

among genes in an expression module for a specific abiotic stress (i.e., Heat, Cold,

Drought, Salt, UV, Ozone) at a specific development stages (i.e., V3 to V6).

Figure 4: lncRNA expression for four modules associated with heat stress. This figure
consists of a heat map (top) and graphs of the expression of specific TE-lncRNAs (bottom)

that were chosen because they were top three overrepresented lncRNAs in the four

modules and had high interconnectivity.

Top) The heat graph shows transcript expression

levels for hub genes and lncRNAs in each module (y -axis) and across conditions (x-axis). The

key to modules (y -axis) and stress conditions (x-axis) are shown on the right legend, with

conditions also separated by developmental stage (bottom of

x-axis).

Warmer colors within

the heat map indicate high expression, and cooler colors are low (or under) expression. This

particular heat map illustrates that the four heat-associated modules are, as expected,

highly expressed under heat stress, but not always at the same developmental stage.

Bottom) The bar plots below the heat graph are eigen-lncRNA expression values selected
from the top three overrepresented TE-lncRNAs with high interconnectivity. The x-axis is the

same as the heat map, and the id of the TE-lncRNAs is provided by the color key. This graphs

shows, again, that the TE-lncRNAs tend to be more highly expressed under heat stress, but

with some dependence on developmental stage. Figures S5 to S9 present similar figures for

modules associated with cold, drought, salt, UV and ozone stress, respectively.

orange dots represent known transcription factors from various families (e.g., TCP),

and grey circles represent coding RNAs. The size of the dot represents intramodular

connectivity, with larger sizes representing higher connectivity. From these

networks, we can infer that lncRNAs and TE-lncRNAs are sometimes as or more

interconnected than transcription factors.
