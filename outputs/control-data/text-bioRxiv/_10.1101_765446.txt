Abstract
The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is one of the biggest modern
global public health concerns. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms,
evolution and global distribution is a priority due to its impact on the treatment course
and patient survivability. Besides all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in
clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental
uncultivable microorganisms. In this study, 293 metagenomic from the TARA
Oceans project were used to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance
genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools. After extensive manual curation, we
show the global ocean ARG abundance, distribution, taxonomy, phylogeny and their
potential to be horizontally transferred by plasmids or viruses and their correlation
with environmental and geographical parameters. A total of 99,205 environmental
ORFs were identified as potential ARGs. These ORFs belong to 560 ARG families
that confer resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. 24,567 ORFs were found in contigs
classified as plasmidial sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic
elements in the dynamics of ARGs transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with more
than 2 ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs,
highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural
ocean environment. This also raises the possibility of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
between clinical and natural environments. The abundance of ARGs showed
different patterns of distribution, with some classes being significantly more abundant
in coastal biomes. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the
most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs from the
recently discovered MCR-1 family with high abundance on Polar Biomes. Of these, 5
were assigned to the genus Psychrobacter, an opportunistic pathogen that can

Introduction
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause over 700,000 deaths per year, making them a
global public health issue and an economic burden to the entire world and in
particular in the developing countries. If the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria
continues at the same rate, projections show that by 2050 they can cause 10 million
deaths per year, which would outnumber deaths caused by cancer [1,2]. Despite its
danger for human health, antibiotic resistance (AR) is a natural phenomenon and is
one of the most common bacterial defence mechanisms. For example, the
resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, conferred by beta-lactamase activity, is estimated
to have emerged more than 1 billion years ago [3,4]. The collection of antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs) in a given environment, also called resistome, is a natural
feature of microbial communities, being part of both inter- and intra-community
communication and in the defence repertoires of organisms sharing the same
biological niche [5,6].
Over the years, reservoirs of ARGs have been detected in different natural
environments, such as oceans [7], lakes [8], rivers [9], remote pristine Antarctic soils
[10] and impacted Arctic tundra wetlands [11]. Studies also show that anthropogenic
activity (e.g. over-usage of antibiotics and their subsequent release via wastewaters
into the environment) could lead to the spread of clinical important ARGs across
natural environment [12,13]. Therefore, the investigation of the natural context of
ARGs, their geographic distribution, dynamics and, in particular, their presence on
horizontally transferable mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids,
transposons, and phages, is crucial to assess their potential to emerge and spread
[14–16]. Due to modern advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics, it is now
possible to study the presence and prevalence of ARGs in different environments.
However, most of the published studies targeted only one or a few classes of ARGs
and were limited to specific environments and geographic locations. The oceans
cover around 70% of Earth’s surface, harbouring a big diversity of microscopic
planktonic organisms forming a complex ecological network which is still understudied [17,18]. To fix this, the number of ocean metagenomic projects stored in
public databases have been growing, but the lack of related metadata made it
difficult to conduct high-throughput gene screenings and correlations with
environmental factors. Fortunately, the TARA oceans project [19] measured several

marine environmental conditions, such as temperature, salinity, geographical
location, pH, etc, across the globe and stored them as structured metadata.
Together with the metagenome sequences [19], this allows the use of the machine
and deep learning approaches to search for gene and species distribution and their
correlation to environmental parameters.
In this study, we applied deepARG [20], a deep learning approach for ARG
identification, to the 12 oceanic regions co-assembled TARA oceans contigs [21].
The results were then manually curated, a taxonomic classification was done, and
analyses were performed for the gene abundance quantification together with
association analyses between the quantification of ARGs and environmental
parameters using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. We also explored the
presence of ARGs in mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in TARA samples to
investigate the potential of these oceanic environments to act as a reservoir of
ARGs.

Material and Methods

Metagenomic data
A total of 12 co-assembled metagenomes (from different oceanic regions explored
by the Tara Oceans expedition), with contigs larger than 1 kilobase were obtained
from the dataset published in 2017 by Delmont et al. [22]. Raw reads of 378 shotgun
sequencing runs of 243 samples were obtained from the EBI ENA database
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) with accession numbers: PRJEB1787, PRJEB6606 and
PRJEB4419.
Sample identifiers and metadata were obtained from Companion Tables Ocean
Microbiome (EMBL) [23]. Tara Ocean samples were collected in seawater at
different sites and depths and successively filtered using a single or a combination of
membranes with pore sizes of 0.1μm, 0.2μm, 0.45μm, 0.8μm, 1.6μm and
3μm to retain different size fractions as viruses, giant viruses (“giruses”),
prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea).

Environmental ARG prediction
Open reading frame (ORF) prediction was performed on the 12 co-assembled
metagenomes using the software MetaGeneMark v3.26 [24] with default parameters.
The screening for ARGs was performed with DeepARG [20] on the extracted ORFs
using gene models, classifying a gene as ARG if the probability was equal or greater
than 0.8. In order to check if those contigs are plasmids or chromosomal sequences,
contigs containing at least one putative ARG were analyzed with the tool PlasFlow

1.1 [25]. We also investigated the number and distribution of contigs with 2 or more
putative ARGs to check for multiple resistance and/or whole ARG operons from
environmental samples. ORFs of putative ARGs (and its respective contig) were
submitted to Kaiju v1.6.2 [26] for taxonomic classification, with the option “run mode”
set as “greedy”. Later, in order to check for misannotations and inconsistencies, we
conducted a manual curation of each ARG among sequences from both deepARGdb
[20] and those obtained from TARA contigs screening. Online BLASTp searches [27]
were performed against the non-redundant protein database, with default
parameters. Conserved domains (CDDs) and annotations in the source databases
(ARDB, CARD and UniProt) were manually inspected.

ARGs quantification and statistical tests on metagenomic samples
Environmental ARGs, identified after the manual curation, were used as a reference
for the mapping of all the raw reads from the 378 metagenomic and 10
metatranscriptomic Tara Oceans samples, using BBMAP v37.90 [28].
The
coverage, in terms of read counts and the abundance of each ARG was then
calculated for each sample. Note that the abundance was calculated as Fragments
Per Kilobase Million (FPKM). The Average Genome Size (AGS) and Genome
Equivalents (GE) were estimated by the software MicrobeCensus v1.0.7 [29] in order
to calculate Reads Per Kilo Genome equivalents (RPKG) as described by
MicrobeCensus authors [29]. RPKG values for ORFs in each ARG family were
summed for each sample. Environmental features, such as the sample depth,
biogeographic biomes, ocean and sea regions and fractions (i.e. the concatenation
of upper and lower filter size) were used for samples grouping and statistical tests.
Pairwise Tukey HSD and multivariate linear regression using OLS models were
conducted in Python 3.6 using the library ‘statsmodels’. The OLS was performed
considering the following formula:
ARGRPKG ~ Marine provinces + Environmental Feature + Ocean sea regions +
Fraction + Biogeographic biomes + Latitude + Longitude + NO2 + PO4 + NO2NO3 +
SI + miTAGSILVATaxo Richness + miTAG_SILVA_Phylo_Diversity +
miTAG_SILVA_Chao + miTAG_SILVA_ace + miTAG_SILVA_Shannon +
OG_Shannon + OG_Richness + OG_Evenness + FC_heterotrophs_cells_mL +
FC_autotrophs_cells_mL + FC_bacteria_cells_mL + FC_picoeukaryotes_cells_mL
where ARGRPKG (the dependent variable) is the sum of RPKM of all ARGs in a given
class and all the dependent variables are the selected environmental features.
ANOVA was then conducted on the coefficients obtained from the OLS regression in
order to infer the significance of a feature. A Python Jupyter notebook is provided
with the code and the results for all the exploratory and statistical analyses [30].

Phylogenetic analysis of environmental ARGs
Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the environmental genes identified as
clinically relevant ARGs, such as the MCR-1 family and New Delhi metallo-betalactamase, for which reference clinical sequences were found in public databases,
such as NCBI and deepARGdb. Multiple protein sequence alignments and
phylogenetic trees were generated using the standard pipeline found on Phylogeny.fr
[31]. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [32] in order to extract conserved
blocks with gblocks [33] and phylogenetic trees generated with phyML [34], using
“WAG” as substitution model and “alrt” as the statistical test.

Database design and implementation
A manually curated MySQL database was created with the environmental ARGs
described and all the subsequent analysis results. We provide the SQL dump at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3404245.

Dash web application for data exploration and visualization
We developed a Python dashboard web application where the user can explore the
results through interactive graphics (plotted with the plotly library). The app includes
a geographical scatterplot, where it is possible to see the abundance of each ARG
(or antibiotic class) selected by the user (RPKG) across all the samples in a world
map; a boxplot, where the environmental feature can be selected in order to group
the samples and compare the abundances; a barplot with taxonomic classification of
the selected ARG (different taxonomic levels for the visualization can be selected);
another scatterplot with marginal distribution plots and trend line (OLS), where on the
axis X is represented the selected ARG and on the axis Y the user can select
environmental variables (e.g. oxygen concentration, salinity, temperature, depth,
etc.). In addition, a table containing information about each ORF is displayed. The
additional information includes ORF id, contig id, antibiotic class, deepARG
probability value, plasmid classification by PlasFlow, taxonomic classification by
Kaiju (on the deepest level), if the ARG is expressed in at least one sample, other
ARGs in the same contig and the total of ARGs in the contig. A link to download the
multi-fasta file of the selected ARG is also provided. The application can be
accessed at http://resistomedb.com/.

Results and Discussion

Environmental ARGs prediction and manual curation
A total of 41,249,791 ORFs were predicted by MetaGeneMark from 15,600,278
assembled contigs and used as input for ARG screening using the deepARG tool
[11]. The usage of deepARG on the predicted Tara Oceans ORFs resulted in the
classification of 116,425 ORFs (0.28%) as putative ARGs, belonging to 594 gene
families and 28 ARG classes. The number of contigs, ORFs and putative ARGs of
the metagenomic co-assemblies from each oceanic region can be found in

Supplementary Table 1. Due to misannotations and misclassifications in the
databases used for deepARG model training, it was necessary to conduct an
extensive manual curation on the results. This curated dataset represents an
important resource for further studies, including evolutionary and comparative
studies.
The manual curation was performed to investigate the incidence of misannotated
ARGs in different scenarios (Supplementary Table 2): (i) misannotated genes or
gene families in the databases with low supportive evidence for ARG prediction; (ii)
housekeeping genes that confer resistance only when specific mutations arise; (iii)
housekeeping genes conferring resistance when overexpressed; (iv): regulatory
sequences, responsible for ARG activation or overexpression of housekeeping
genes (leading to a resistance phenotype); (v) sequences with both similarity to
ARGs and non-ARGs, belonging to the same superfamily and/or sharing domains.
All misannotated ARGs identified in scenario (i) were completely removed from our
database and downstream analysis. A total of 34 ARG families was identified as
misannotated or with low-quality annotation in the source database. For instance, the
msrB gene encodes an ABC-F subfamily protein, that leads to erythromycin and
streptogramin B resistance, but the fasta sequence in the database belongs to the
msrB gene encoding methionine sulfoxide reductases B, not conferring antibiotic
resistance. Another misannotated ARG family is patA, an ABC transporter of
Streptococcus pneumoniae, conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, whose
sequence is a putrescine aminotransferase (patA) in the CARD database. A total of
99,205 ORFs remained after this step for non-quantitative analyses.
Putative ARGs identified on the scenarios (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) were kept in the
MySQL database for further studies but not used in the quantification and statistical
analyses. The scenario (ii) includes the identification of 10 families of housekeeping
genes and the corresponding mutations that could infer resistance. In scenario (iii),
we identified 9 ARGs whose overexpression can lead to resistance. For scenario (iv)
we identified 41 regulatory sequences that have been identified as responsible for
ARG expression or over-expression of housekeeping genes that are leading to the
resistance phenotype. For scenario (v) we identified 187 families that cannot be
distinguished from non-ARGs by similarity alone. After the removal of these genes, a
total of 13,163 ORFs (from the initial 116,425) belonging to 313/594 families, were
retained for quantification and further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
The most abundant ARGs of these 13,163 ORFs were QAC (multidrug efflux pumps
named after their conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds) with
more than 3,000 overall occurrences, followed by TETB(60) with more than 2,000
occurrences (Figure 2). The latter is an ABC transporter that confers resistance to
tetracycline and tigecycline identified by screening a human saliva metagenomic
library [36]. The ORFs conferring resistance to tetracycline combined are the most
widespread, with several TET and TETA classes accounting for approximately 4,000
occurrences. The main beta lactam-resistance conferring ARG was identified as
K678_12262 with approximately 1,000 occurrences.

We found a total of 24,567 putative ARGs (24.76% of the 99,205 ARGs excluding
scenario (i)) present in contigs classified as plasmids. The presence of two or more
ARGs in a single contig was also checked in order to identify possible multi-resistant
organisms. The main objective of this analysis was to evaluate the potential of
horizontal genetic transfer (HGT), as plasmids, bacteriophages, transposons, and
extracellular DNA are the primary drivers of HGT. The occurrence of HGT of ARGs
was already detected and characterized in clinical environments [37], in wastewater
treatment plants (activated sludge) [14,38] and in fertilized soil [39], but still little is
known about ARG HGT in aquatic environments, especially in open ocean regions.

The presence of ARGs in phages and its potential HGT was described in some
studies, for example, in a Mediterranean river [40], in pig faecal samples [15], in
fresh-cut vegetables and in agricultural soil [16].
For this analysis, we only removed the ARGs from the scenario (i), misannotated
sequences, because the presence of putative ARGs in the same contig and/or
plasmid can give us additional functional evidence. We identified 4,063 contigs with
multiple putative ARGs in contigs classified as chromosomes (up to 11 ARGs in the
same contig), and 741 in contigs classified as a plasmid (up to 5 ARGs in the same
contig), suggesting the presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in these
environments (Table 1). In figure S1, we show the distribution of the ARGs in the 2
plasmids containing 5 ARGs each.

taxonomic level. Alphaproteobacteria (37,360 sequences) were revealed as the
largest taxonomic unit. A total of 124 ARGs were classified as a virus. The most
abundant taxonomic viral group was assigned to unclassified Prymnesiovirus (21
ARGs) and Chrysochromulina ericina virus (CeV) (19 ARGs). However, all the 124
viral ARGs are in scenario (v), and further investigations should be done in order to
curate these sequences.
For the contigs containing multiple ARGs, the taxonomic classification of each ARG
was checked together with a full contig sequence classification by kaiju to verify if the
ARGs in the same contig belong to the same organism, giving us an indication of
possible mis-assembly or HGT. One contig with 11 ARGs (TARA_ANWk99_1343221) was classified as HGW-Alphaproteobacteria-12, while two of the
single ARGs were classified as Parvibaculum lavamentivorans, an
alphaproteobacterial species first isolated from activated sludge in Germany [41].
The other 9 ARGs, were classified as
HGW-Alphaproteobacteria-3, HGWAlphaproteobacteria-12, and as generic Alphaproteobacteria. A previous study
showed the presence of ARGs in a strain of Parvibaculum from marine samples by
functional metagenomics [7] which might hint to a broader ARG distribution among
this clade. The other contig with 11 ARGs (TARA_ANE-k99_4428305) was classified
(whole contig as well as the single ARGs) as Micavibrio sp., an obligately predatory
bacterium exhibiting ‘vampire-like’ behaviour on gram-negative pathogens [42]. First
isolated from wastewater samples, this genus has been considered as a potential
new therapeutic approach against multi-resistant bacteria [43] including MCR-1
positive strains [43], due to the fact that no species from the genus Micavibrio was
found to be pathogenic for humans [44]. However, if Micavibrio species contain
indeed multiple ARGs, this would raise concerns about any clinical therapeutic
approaches with these bacteria. One of the putative plasmids containing five ARGs
(contig TARA_PSE-k99_4996023 on figure S1) showed taxonomic agreement
between the classification of its single ARGs, all assigned to Tistrella mobilis. This
species was firstly isolated from Thailand wastewater [45], and later another strain
was isolated from the Red Sea [46]. The other contig classified as a plasmid with 5
ARGs was classified as Halomonas desiderata, a denitrifying bacterium isolated first
from a municipal sewage treatment plant [47]. From the 5 ARGs in this contig, 2
confer resistance to trimethoprim (DFRE and DFRA3). Previous work showed that
another bacteria from the same genus (Halomonas marisflavi type strain) is resistant
to trimethoprim in vitro [48]. However, in the same study, Halomonas desiderata did
not show resistance phenotype for any of the antibiotics tested. For both genera,
Tistrella and Halomonas, mega plasmids were described [46,49].

ARGs quantification on metagenome and metatranscriptome samples

The average genome size of Tara Oceans samples were calculated by
MicrobeCensus v 1.0.7 [29] and then used to estimate RPKG, a normalization
method for gene abundance in microbial studies used to avoid the bias of genome
sequence coverage between samples populated with different genome sizes [29],
which is expected due to filtration methods applied in the TARA study.
Since the Tara Oceans samples had different lower and upper thresholds of filtration
size, we grouped samples by both thresholds to compare the AGS. MicrobeCensus
uses a set of gene markers to infer the AGS, and since these gene markers are
mainly present in cellular (not viral) genomes, the fractions enriched for virus and
giant virus (< 0.22 um and 0.1-0.22 um) showed very biased and aberrant results for
AGS, which was very high, up to 395.4 megabases; and genome equivalents. This is
because the AGS values are inversely proportional to the number of reads mapping
to the housekeeping gene markers, that are in very low abundance in virus-enriched
samples. Based on that, we decided to remove virus-enriched fractions from the
quantitative analysis, keeping 293 sample runs for downstream quantitative
analyses. In order to compare the abundance of ARG classes across different
marine regions, fractions and layers, we ran pairwise Tukey HSD tests on the ARG
classes (the sum of RPKG for each class). For example, we wanted to investigate if
the coastal biomes contained significantly more ARGs from any class than other
more pristine biomes. The quinolone and bacitracin ARG classes were significantly
more abundant in the coastal biome than in the westerlies biome (adjusted p-values
0.0169 and 0.0076, respectively). Furthermore, the fosmidomycin and quinolone
ARGs were significantly (adjusted p-value 0.0014 and 0.0438, respectively) more
abundant in the coastal biome than in the trades biome (Figure 3, Supplementary
Table 2). The high abundance of ARGs of quinolone class along other ARG classes
was previously reported on China’s coastal environment [50]. These results could
indicate that specifically, this class of ARGs is under anthropogenic pressure, and
future studies should be carried to investigate it in greater detail.
Surprisingly, the pristine polar biome showed significantly higher RPKG values for
ARGs from the class Polymyxin than any other biome. Polymyxin B and E (also
known as Colistins) are last-resort antibiotics used against gram-negative bacteria
when modern antibiotics are ineffective, especially in cases of multiple drug-resistant
Pseudomonas aeruginosa or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae [51,52].
We discuss mobilized colistin resistance genes (MCRs) in greater detail in a
separate section later in this manuscript.

When comparing abundances of classes on marine provinces, we found, for
example, a significant difference (p < 0.05) of bleomycin class in 2 Indian provinces
compared to most of the other provinces (Figure 4). Bleomycin resistance genes
were previously reported to be in association with New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase
(NDM-1) genes [53,54]. In this study, NDM-like genes (classified by deepARG as
NDM-17 variant) were also found in greater abundance in India South Subtropical
Gyre province. The first variant of NDM was identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae
strain isolated from a Swedish patient who travelled to New Delhi, India [76], and it
was spread globally in a few years and also in other species from the
Enterobacteriaceae family, being classified as a potential worldwide public health
problem [77]. This result raises concerns about the impact of antibiotics from the
production of pharmaceuticals and wastewater in marine environments.

In addition, we wanted to check the influence of other environmental parameters on
the abundance of ARG classes. Our OLS models showed mostly geographical
parameters affecting the variance of ARGs, in agreement with our Tukey HSD tests.
However, for some classes, the influence of non-geographical parameters (such as
nutrient concentration) on the abundance of ARGs could be demonstrated. For
example, for quinolone, the model shows inorganic phosphate (PO4)3− inverted
correlated (beta -0.13, p-value 0.0002), NO2NO3 (Nitrite+Nitrate concentration) direct
correlated (beta 0.007, p-value 0.002). The R2 of this model is 0.57 and p-value
9.82E-17. On the other hand, PO4 is positively correlated with polymyxin and
fosfomycin (p-values 1.918251E-05 and 1.651744E-08, respectively). The role of
inorganic nutrients concentration in antibiotic resistance genes abundance is poorly
understood and sometimes controversial, with some studies suggesting that high
concentration of nutrients is negatively correlated with ARGs because in nutrient-rich
environments competitive interactions are less important [55]. However, in
wastewater treatments plants [56] and agricultural soil receiving dairy manure [57]
the abundance of ARGs are increased. Further studies should be conducted to
better understand the role of different nutrients on the abundance of ARGs of
different classes in both pristine oligotrophic and impacted environments. The
supplementary table 3 shows all significant results ANOVA test on the coefficients of
OLS for each class.

Most mechanisms conferring resistance to Colistin are directed against modifications
of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with the addition of l-ara4N and/or
phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) to lipid A as the main mechanisms [58]. We found
evidence for the occurrence of mobilized colistin resistance genes related to the
recently discovered MCR-1 [59], which relies on the PEtN addition to lipid A. MCR-1
enzyme was described as 41% and 40% identical to the PEA transferases LptA and
EptC, respectively, and sequence comparisons suggest that the active-site residues
are conserved. However, until the discovery of the plasmid-borne mcr-1 in E. coli
from pig [59], colistin resistance has always been linked to chromosomally encoded
genes with few or no possibility of horizontal transfer. Further studies showed a high
prevalence of the mcr-1 gene (e.g. 20% in animal-specific bacterial strains and 1% in
human-specific bacterial strains in China) and the plasmid has been detected in
several countries covering Europe, Asia, South America, North America and Africa
[60–67]. Further MCR classes were described recently, with recent classification into
9 phylogenetically different classes MCR-1 to 9 [68,69]. In the present study, we
found 15 ORFs classified as MCR-1 by deepARG, they were most abundant in the
Atlantic Southwest Shelves Province followed by its adjacent region, Antarctic
Province (Figure 5). However, the employed version of deepARG did not classify
these sequences into the more recently described MCR-2 to 9. Therefore, we
performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 6), which included sequences of different
MCRs (MCR-1 to 5) and LptA (eptA as outgroup). The results suggested that 5
ORFs (from genus Psychrobacter, family Moraxellaceae [65]) are close to the MCR1/2 clade with support value 1 (Figure 7). Members of the genus Psychrobacter were
isolated from a wide range of habitats, including food, clinical samples, skin, gills and
intestines of fish, seawater and Antarctic sea ice [67–71]. Importantly, at least 2
isolates from this genus were already reported to be resistant to Colistin
(Psychrobacter vallis sp. nov. and Psychrobacter aquaticus sp. nov) both isolated
from Antarctica [72]. Coincidently, the regions with greater RPKG mean for MCR-1 in
our study were Southwest Atlantic and Antarctic Province. Our results support that
Psychrobacter might be an ecological reservoir for transfer of PEtN transferases to
other pathogens and further studies should be conducted to better understand the
dynamics and evolution of ARGs in this genus. In addition, some species of this
genus were also reported to cause opportunistic infections in humans, including at
least one case reported to be associated with marine environment exposure [74] In
this context it is therefore important to increase monitoring, by, for example, including
screenings for those genes.
The residual MCR sequences, mostly belonging to the Thioglobus genus, were
phylogenetically farther away from MCR-1/2 and might constitute new, distinct MCR
classes. Important to note is that the phylogenetically very close relationship to MCR
sequences does not prove the function as a colistin-resistant gene, which awaits
further experiments to confirm this role.

MCR

The tree was inferred by standard pipeline from phylogeny.fr (phyML with “WAG” model and statistical
test Alrt for support values). Sequences from NCBI for outgroup eptA and for clinical MCR-1 to MCR-5
were used in addition to the samples obtained from our results from Tara Oceans co-assemblies. The
name of the Tara Oceans sequences displayed in the tree are defined with the id of sequence, coassembly id, taxon name from Kaiju and yes/no for plasmid classification from PlasFlow.The blue
rectangles are marking the TARA sequences. The blue clade is MCR-1/2 clade, the grey clade is
MCR-5, the green clade is MCR-3/4 and the red clade is eptA clade (outgroup). The red circles are
marking the sequences in contigs classified as plasmids by PlasFlow.

For plasmid classification, we relied on the results of PlasFlow, which only classified
two of the sequences classified located on a plasmid. This can be explained by the
small size of many contigs (with eight of them smaller than 3 kb). Additionally, a
false-negative result from PlasFlow could be a result of a re-integration of plasmidial
sequences into the chromosome - or that the here detected MCR genes may
constitute an ancestor of the plasmidial E. coli MCR sequences, as was already
suggested for Moraxella species [66]. The two ARGs classified to be located on a
plasmid are detected in contigs with a size of 2 kb and 38 kb. The former, classified
as belonging to a Thioglobus species, is difficult to be validated as a plasmidial
sequence due to its small size. The latter could be classified as a sequence of a
Poseidonibacter species, a marine group of bacteria recently reclassified from the
Arcobacter genus which contains several pathogenic bacteria [70]. A toxin-antitoxin
system is encoded two ORFs upstream the MCR gene, which might be an indication
for a plasmidial location. However, no further genes usually located on Arcobacter
spp. plasmids [71] were found on this contig, hampering its definite classification as
a plasmidial mcr. That said, various mobile element genes located on this contig
(Figure 7) strengthen the assumption that this contig is related to a mobile genetic

region. Interesting is the unusual synteny of MCR, PAP2 and a downstream encoded
DAGK, of which the latter only appears in MCR-3 genetic environments [72]. Related
genes (amino acid sequence identity of about 70%) with a conserved gene synteny
are found in various Arcobacter species (Fig. 6). Several Arcobacter species which
do contain a similar mcr gene were susceptible to colistin treatment (REF), arguing
against this gene conferring colistin resistance. Further research would be necessary
to confirm or refute colistin resistance in marine Poseidonibacter [73].

showing MCR-1 and surrounding genes and including the mobile element related genes. Tnp Transposase, DAG - Diacylglycerol, PAP2 - phosphatase PAP2 family protein, Mcr - mobilized colistin
resistance protein. Colour code: green - mobile element related gene, blue - Other/metabolic genes,
yellow - DNA-related gene, light blue - Mcr-accessory genes, red - Mcr gene, grey - hypothetical
protein. Annotations from MetaGeneMark were manually refined using the conserved domains
database and blastp against the SwissProt database. Taxonomy of Arcobacter species is stated as
currently in the Genbank database.

The presence of MCR-related genes in both Antarctic and adjacent regions can also
raise concerns about gene flow due to ice melting, a problem already discussed
previously for other ARGs [73].

Conclusions
Our study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean
metagenome, conferring probably resistance to 26 classes of antibiotics. The
extensive analysis leads to a detailed taxonomic classification and varying ARG
abundance in different biomes. Potential horizontal gene transfer leads to the
spreading of some ARGs, resulting also in putative multi-resistant strains. For a
limited number of ARGs, gene transcription could be shown. Our study also exposes
the importance of monitoring coastal water for anthropogenic impact, since the inflow
of antibiotics by e.g. wastewater might strengthen (by selective pressure) the
antibiotic resistance development by microorganisms. Antarctic soil and ice might be
a huge potential reservoir for ARGs, and the discussion about ARG distribution
should not neglect the future impact of this reservoir under the influence of climate
change. This study could also bear an impact on investigations dealing with the
evolutionary history of ARGs, with the here presented genes as ancestors of
common ARGs in clinically relevant strains. Last but not least, the combination of
multiple modern machine learning tools and other open-source data science libraries
