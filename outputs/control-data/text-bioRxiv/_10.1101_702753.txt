Abstract
In the dual-stream model of language processing, the exact connectivity of
the ventral stream to the anterior temporal lobe remains elusive. To investigate
the connectivity among the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the lateral part of the
temporal and parietal lobes, we integrated spatiotemporal profiles of
cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) recorded intraoperatively from 14
patients who had had resective surgeries for brain tumor or epileptic focus. The
4D visualization of the combined CCEP data showed that the pars opercularis
(Broca’s area) connected to the posterior temporal cortices and the supramarginal
gyrus, while the pars orbitalis connected to the anterior lateral temporal cortices
and the angular gyrus. Quantitative topographical analysis of CCEP connectivity
confirmed an anterior-posterior gradient of connectivity from IFG stimulus sites
to the temporal response sites. Reciprocality analysis indicated that the anterior
part of the IFG is bi-directionally connected to the temporal or parietal area. The
present study revealed that each IFG subdivision has a different connectivity to
the temporal lobe with an anterior-posterior gradient and supports the classical
connectivity concept of Dejerine that the frontal lobe is connected to the temporal
lobe through the arcuate fasciculus and also a double-fan-shaped structure,
anchored at the limen insulae.

Language is a unique feature of human beings that should not be impaired
by surgery without the justification of clinical benefit. The posterior part of the
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which consists of the pars opercularis (pOpe) and the
pars triangularis (pTri), is known as Broca’s area, while the anterior part, the
pars orbitalis (pOrb), is reported to have an executive function in semantic
cognition tasks (Wagner AD et al. 2001; Gough PM et al. 2005; Hoffman P et al.
2010; Krieger-Redwood K et al. 2015). Recently, a dual-stream model of language
processing has been proposed and has received wide recognition on the strength
of an analogy with the processing of visual information (Hickok G and D Poeppel
2004, 2007; Saur D et al. 2008; Ueno T et al. 2011; Hickok G 2012; Gil-Robles S et
al. 2013). The model consists of a dorsal stream for phonological processing and a
ventral stream for semantic processing. Although this framework is generally
accepted, the details of the tracts and cortices involved in the dual network
remain to be established (Dick AS and P Tremblay 2012). While the superior
longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the arcuate fasciculus (AF) are established as
the main pathway of the dorsal network, additional studies are required to
identify the connectivity underlying the ventral network, which presumably
includes the uncinate fasciculus (UF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF),

and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF).
Among these, the IFOF is reported to be involved in semantic processing
based on high-frequency electrical stimulation of the white matter in awake
surgery (Duffau H et al. 2005). The IFOF consists of two components, superficial
and deep. The former originates from the anterior part of IFG (pOrb and pTri),
while the latter originates from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the middle
frontal gyrus, and the orbitofrontal cortex (Sarubbo S et al. 2013). Their posterior
termination includes the occipital lobe, the superior parietal lobule, and the
posterior part of temporo-basal area (Martino J, C Brogna, et al. 2010). Duffau
and coworkers reported that stimulation of the superficial component of the IFOF
induced semantic errors during picture naming. The supposition that IFOF
engages in semantic processing is also supported by functional studies on its
cortical terminations. The anterior part of the IFG, which is part of the frontal
termination of the superficial component of IFOF, has been shown to be engaged
in semantic control by meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and positron-emission tomographic (PET) studies (Noonan KA et al. 2013)
and by interventions using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Hoffman P
et al.

2010; Jefferies E 2013). The posterior fusiform gyrus, one of the posterior

terminations of IFOF, is known as the visual word-form area. A role for IFOF in

semantic processing is further supported by dynamic causality modeling of BOLD
(blood oxygenation level dependent) signals that showed effective connectivity
from the fusiform gyrus to the anterior IFG during a semantic judgment task
(Perrone-Bertolotti M et al. 2017). These pieces of evidence suggest that the
superficial component of the IFOF has a semantic function. However, the anterior
temporal lobe (ATL), which engages in semantic representation and is essential
in semantic cognition (Spitsyna G et al. 2006; Lambon Ralph MA et al. 2010;
Jefferies E 2013; Lambon Ralph MA et al. 2017), has not been reported as a
posterior termination of the IFOF. ATL subregions receive the termination of the
UF (temporal pole) and ILF (anterior-ventral area and temporal pole) (Binney RJ
et al. 2012; Fan L et al. 2014; Egger K et al. 2015; Jung J et al. 2017; Panesar SS
et al. 2018), although they seem not to be a main part of the ventral spoken
language stream. Electrical stimulation of the UF does not interfere with object
naming and resection of the UF is generally acceptable in neurosurgery (Duffau
H et al. 2008; Duffau H et al. 2009). The ILF projects posteriorly to the occipital
lobe without any frontal termination. If the superficial component of the IFOF
and the anterior part of the IFG are implicated in semantic function, it would be
natural to infer that the anterior temporal lobe, which is the semantic
representational hub, has a direct connection to the semantic control center (the

anterior part of IFG) via a subcomponent of the IFOF, although no termination of
the IFOF in the anterior temporal lobe has been proven. To verify this hypothesis,
we investigated in detail the connectivity between the IFG and the lateral
temporal cortices.
The cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) is an electrophysiological
method to probe effective connectivity by applying single-pulse electrical
stimulation to the cortex. The CCEPs are recorded from remote cortical areas and
are supposed to reflect orthodromic propagation of the stimulus signal through
the cortico-cortical connections (Matsumoto R et al. 2017; Matsumoto R and T
Kunieda 2018). This method was first applied for patients with implanted
subdural electrodes, which successfully delineated various functional cortical
networks (Matsumoto R et al. 2004; Lacruz ME et al. 2007; Conner CR et al. 2011;
Koubeissi MZ et al. 2012; Swann NC et al. 2012; Kubota Y et al. 2013; Matsuzaki
N et al. 2013; Keller CJ, CJ Honey, P Megevand, et al. 2014; Enatsu R et al. 2015;
Usami K et al. 2018). The connectivity pattern retrieved as CCEPs overlaps in
large part with the resting-state functional connectivity measured by
resting-state fMRI (Keller CJ et al. 2011; Keller CJ, CJ Honey, L Entz, et al. 2014).
Due to its high practicality and reproducibility, CCEP has been clinically utilized
to probe and monitor the connectivity of the AF during neurosurgical operations

(Saito T et al. 2014; Yamao Y et al. 2014; Yamao Y et al. 2017) to ensure speech
preservation (what we call “intraoperative CCEP” examination).
To investigate the patterns of connectivity from the IFG to the
temporoparietal area, we systematically applied single-pulse stimulation to three
IFG subdivisions (pOrb, pTri, and pOpe) and recorded CCEP responses in an
intraoperative setting. Although the connectivity between the posterior IFG and
the inferior parietal area and the posterior temporal area has been intensively
studied (Greenlee JD et al. 2004; Matsumoto R
2007; Garell PC et al. 2013; Yamao Y

et al.

et al.

2004; Greenlee JD et al.

2014), this study is unique in that we

visualized and analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of CCEP connectivity from
all the IFG subdivisions, in particular from the anterior IFG, in light of the
dual-stream model of language processing.

hemisphere between March 2014 and July 2016. All the selected patients were
supplied with the appropriate information about the study, provided written
informed consent, and received intraoperative CCEP. The inclusion criteria were
as follows: (1) the stimulus sites of the CCEP investigation covered all three
subdivisions of the IFG (pOrb, pTri, and pOpe), which was confirmed by
intraoperative photographs of the grid electrodes; (2) the recording electrodes
covered the lateral temporo-parietal area; (3) no invasion or severe mass effect
was observed in the temporal stem or extreme capsule, where the fibers of the
ventral stream converge. See Figure 1.

In 11 patients, the language-dominant hemisphere was determined by the
Wada test with intra-carotid administration of propofol (Takayama M et al. 2004).
In two patients (patients 4 and 5), the Wada test was omitted because of the
urgent clinical situation, and language fMRI was used instead to define the
dominant hemisphere (Yamao Y

et al.

2014). One patient (patient 2) could not

perform any language tasks because of motor aphasia resulting from the tumor,
indicating that the affected hemisphere was language dominant. Intraoperative
CCEP investigation was performed to monitor the integrity of the dorsal
language pathway during surgery. The clinical usefulness of monitoring the
dorsal language pathway was reported in the previous literature (Yamao Y

et al.

2014).
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University
Graduate School and the Faculty of Medicine (IRB C573, C443, and C1082).

Preparation and acquisition of intraoperative CCEP data
In all patients, the craniotomy was performed under general anesthesia.
After the dura was opened, one grid electrode was placed on the frontal lobe to
cover the anterior language core (Broca’s area) and another one or two grid
electrodes were placed on the tempo-parietal cortices to cover the posterior

language core (Wernicke’s area). The location of electrodes was always
determined by clinical need (that is, monitoring of CCEP and functional
mapping).
For the preoperative planning of grid placement, anatomical and functional
images were acquired with a 3-Tesla magnetic-resonance scanner (Trio, Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) as described elsewhere (Yamao Y

et al.

2014; Yamao Y

et al.

2017). We constructed a cortical surface model from the T1-weighted image using
FreeSurfer software ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ).
The electrodes were made of platinum with a recording diameter of 3 mm
and a center-to-center distance of 1 cm (Unique Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
The details of CCEP recording have been reported elsewhere (Matsumoto R
2004; Matsumoto R et al. 2007; Matsumoto R et al. 2012; Yamao Y

et al.

et al.

2014). A

32-channel intraoperative monitoring system (MEE 1232 Neuromaster,
Nihon-Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an electrical stimulator (MS-120B,
Nihon-Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) was used for generating single pulses for
stimulation, for recording the raw electrocorticogram (ECoG), and for online
analysis of the averaged CCEP waveform. The raw ECoG data were recorded at a
sampling rate of 5 kHz. Recordings from subdural electrodes were referenced to a
scalp electrode placed on the skin over the mastoid process contralateral to the

side of craniotomy.
Single-pulse electrical stimulation was applied in a bipolar fashion using a
pair of adjacent electrodes. Square-wave electrical pulses of alternating polarity
with a pulse width of 0.3 ms were delivered at 1 Hz. We fixed the stimulation
intensity at 15 mA to shorten the investigation time since we did not have enough
time to adjust the stimulus intensity in every session in the operating room. The
stimulation order was as follows: First, we stimulated all possible electrode pairs
in the IFG while recording the CCEP responses in the temporo-parietal area. We
then stimulated selected temporo-parietal electrodes, namely, those with discrete
CCEP responses to IFG stimulation, to investigate the reciprocal connectivity. All
the CCEP responses analyzed in this study were recorded under general
anesthesia. CCEP examination under general anesthesia was feasible since the
distribution of the CCEP response did not change even though the amplitude of
maximum response becomes slightly larger in the awake state (Yamao Y

et al.

2014).
The online CCEP analysis was obtained by averaging the ECoGs (30 trials
in each session) across time windows phase-locked to stimulation, each with a
post-stimulus duration of 200 ms and a pre-stimulus baseline of 20 ms. We
checked the reproducibility of the response in at least two sessions to distinguish

the CCEP responses from baseline activities. The raw ECoG was simultaneously
recorded and displayed to monitor seizure patterns during stimulation. The
online CCEP analysis was used to determine the stimulation electrodes to be
used for testing reciprocal connectivity. The recorded raw ECoG data were used
for further offline analysis. The offline analysis was obtained by averaging ECoGs
phase-locked to the stimuli (30 trials per session) with a time window of 300 ms
and a baseline of 30 ms before stimulus onset.

Visualization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the CCEP: the 4D CCEP map
Obtaining a clear understanding of the whole connectivity pattern just from
an inspection of the waveforms of individual patients is difficult because the
electrode locations differ by patient. To understand the spatiotemporal dynamics
based on the data derived from all patients, we created a “4D CCEP map,” that is,
a 4D (time-sequence of 3D) volume image in the Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) standard space, creating one such map for each stimulus area in the IFG
(pOrb, pTri, and pOpe). For each time point (time-locked at a stimulation), all
amplitude data were plotted in the MNI space, averaged and smoothed with a
Gaussian kernel (see Supplementary Materials for detailed procedures.) Uneven
electrode coverage was corrected by dividing the summed amplitudes by the

number of measurements. To visualize the 4D representation of the CCEP, we
digitally rendered a standard brain-surface model, providing each vertex with the
value at the nearest-neighbor voxel in the 4D CCEP map. The time sequence of
this rendered brain surface was presented as a movie. (Available in the
Supplemental Data.)

Topographical analysis of frontotemporal connectivity
To clarify the spatial relationships between the stimulus and response sites,
we performed a linear regression analysis on their coordinates, which we term
the “topographical analysis” of the CCEP. First, we determined the CCEP
response by visual inspection of the waveforms with the following criteria:
1. The polarity is negative.
2. The amplitude is larger than 6 × the standard deviation (SD) of the
baseline fluctuations. The baseline is defined as the period between 100 ms
and 5 ms pre-stimulus.
3. The response is reproducible across two consecutive sessions. (30 trials are
averaged for each session.)
We excluded data from electrodes located within 25 mm of the stimulus site to
rule out responses due to local U-fibers since our objective was to investigate the

long-range CCEP responses. Volume-conducted responses, although rare in areas
> 25 mm distant, were eliminated by visual inspection because they putatively
reflect large responses just under the stimulus area (Shimada S et al. 2017). We
judged responses to be volume-conducted when the waveforms were almost
invariant in shape and diminished steadily with distance from the stimulus site.
After we inspected all the recorded waveforms to determine the early and delayed
CCEP responses, the basic properties of the CCEP responses such as onset time,
peak time and amplitude were stored in a database (referred to hereafter as the
CCEP database) together with the MNI coordinates of the electrodes. We
classified each response as early (N1) or delayed (N2) by a cluster analysis of the
latency distribution (see Figure S1), although the N1 cluster determined in this
method was similar to the traditional criteria of N1 (onset < 30 ms, peak < 100
ms).
Although we judged the CCEP response based solely on single waveforms,
traditional waveform analysis has paid attention to locally maximal responses
that seem to be the center of the response when adjacent electrodes show a
similar waveform. To perform a similar analysis in this study for purposes of
comparison, we identified maximum response sites in the CCEP database
automatically using a MATLAB script written in-house. We defined a “max

response” site as one that had the largest amplitude in the spatio-temporal
neighborhood, where spatial proximity means within 15 mm of the inter-electrode
distance and temporal proximity means within 5 ms of the peak time difference.
After collating the CCEP database, we investigated whether the spatial
distribution of N1 responses in the temporo-parietal area differs according to the
stimulus site in the IFG. Because the distribution of the response sites is parallel
to the y-z plane, we verified the difference in the two-dimensional distribution (of
MNI y and z coordinates) using the Wilk’s lambda test. We also evaluated the
hypothesis that the more anterior the location of the stimulus site (in IFG), the
more anterior is the response site (in the lateral temporal cortices). We created
new coordinates for the stimulus and response sites, separately. We measured the
distance between the stimulus site and the midpoint of the lower third of the
precentral sulcus (see the left panel of Figure 4C) for the stimulus sites. We
performed principal-component analysis for all the N1 response sites and
extracted the anterior-posterior axis parallel to the temporal gyri as the first
component (which we named Y1; See Figure 4C) for the response sites. The
second component indicates the direction perpendicular, i.e. in a dorso-ventral
temporal lobe orientation, to Y1 (named Y2). We performed linear regression
analysis of X and Y1 or Y2.

Analysis of fronto-parietal connectivity
As the number of cases that cover the parietal area is small and statistical
analysis as above is not feasible, we only described the area-to-area connectivity
by detecting the maximum response electrodes in each CCEP examination. We
intended to perform a similar topographical analysis between the IFG and
parietal lobe. Here, we focused on pOrb connectivity to the inferior parietal area
as investigated by pOrb stimulation, since previous literature has reproducibly
reported the CCEP connectivity between pOpe/pTri and the inferior parietal area
(Matsumoto R
et al.

2014; Yamao Y

2012; Entz L et al. 2014; Keller CJ, CJ Honey, P Megevand

Probing reciprocal connections from and to the pars orbitalis
We investigated the reciprocality of the connections from pOrb rather than
pTri or pOpe because the latter has already been investigated in our previous
reports using a different patient population (Matsumoto R
al.

et al.

2004; Yamao Y

et

2017). We considered connectivity to be reciprocal when stimulation through

the temporal (or parietal) response electrode evoked a max response in at least
one of the paired stimulus electrodes in the IFG pOrb. Technical details regarding

this procedure are provided as supplementary data. We calculated the
reciprocality rate for six groups of stimulus-recording pairs stratified by area
(fronto-temporal vs. fronto-parietal) and type of response (max response, any
response, or no response). We treated the stimulus-recording pair with no CCEP
response equally as those with a CCEP response in order to obtain the negative
controls.

Comparison with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity
We compared the CCEP connectivity originating from the IFG pOrb with the
functional connectivity revealed by the rs-fMRI for the purpose of validation. We
utilized the functional connectivity maps available from the NeuroSynth website
(http://neurosyngh.org/) derived from 1000 healthy subjects as a reference. For
each stimulus site in IFG pOrb, a functional connectivity map was obtained from
the website as a 3D volume image by specifying the stimulus coordinate as the
seed voxel. We calculated the voxel-wise average of all functional connectivities
obtained as described above as one volume image. We subsequently visualized the
averaged connectivity map as a color map on the standard brain surface and
compared it with the CCEP map by visual inspection.

Results
Visualization of distinct connectivity patterns from IFG subdivisions
The CCEP connectivity pattern varied distinctly when stimulation was
administered through different subdivisions of the IFG. As shown in a
representative case (Figure 2), the distribution of the CCEP response changed
depending on whether the stimulation was applied through the pOpe, pTri or
pOrb. In each patient, we observed distinct connectivity patterns for different
IFG subdivisions. However, it is difficult to deduce a general rule of connectivity
directly from individual cases due to limitations and variations in electrode
coverage peculiar to each subject. Therefore, to systematically visualize the CCEP
connectivity, we combined all patient data into a standardized map of
connectivity between the IFG and the lateral temporoparietal cortices.

(Row 1) Shown are the locations of all electrodes in patient 12. A 2 × 8 electrode grid was placed
on the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; contains Broca’s area) and a 4 × 5 electrode grid was placed
on each of the temporal lobe and parietal lobe (jointly containing Wernicke’s area). The open
red circle indicates the location of the tumor. (Rows 2–4) Shown are the response patterns due
to stimulation in pOpe, pTri, and pOrb, respectively. pOpe, pars opercularis; pTri, pars

Figure 3 shows the averaged response map obtained by stimulation of the
three subdivisions in IFG. The 4D CCEP movie (provided as a supplemental data)
demonstrates the time course of the CCEP amplitude distribution. The
waveforms in Figure 3 represent the averaged temporal dynamics of the voxels
included in each ROI. The center of the four spherical ROIs were located at the
representative N1 (early negative) response areas in IFG stimulation: “R1” was
set on the N1 response area of pOrb stimulation; “R2” and “R3,” on that of pOpe
and pTri; and “R4,” on that of the stimulation in the three subdivisions. As the
movie and the waveforms show, pOpe stimulation elicited prominent N1
responses in the posterior part of the temporal lobe (STG and middle temporal
gyrus [MTG]) and adjacent parietal areas (supramarginal gyrus [SMG] and
angular gyrus [AG]) around 30 ms after stimulus onset. After the N1 response, a
larger and broader negative response (N2) with a peak latency of 150–200 ms was
evoked in each response area (R2, R3, and R4). Though the averaged waveform
suggests that the inferior part of the anterior lateral temporal lobe (R1) exhibited
an N1 response for pOpe stimulation, we regarded this activity as a far-field
potential reflecting the large response around the stimulus site; the R1 response
shares the temporal dynamics of those electrodes around the stimulus site in the
early phase (< 20 ms), as is demonstrated in the 4D CCEP movie. In contrast,

pOrb stimulation elicited an N1 response in the anterior part of the ITG and
MTG at around 40 ms after stimulation followed by a larger N2 response in the
same area (see the averaged waveform of R1 in the lower panel of Figure 3). It
also elicited an N1 response in the ventral part of the AG, followed by a large N2
response in the same area (see the averaged waveform of R4 in the lower panel of
Figure 3). pTri stimulation showed a response pattern intermediate between
those of pOpe and pOrb stimulation since its CCEP response locations comprised
the posterior STG, the posterior MTG, and the AG (N1 and N2), which resemble
those of pOpe stimulation, and the anterior MTG and ITG (N2), which resembles
those of pOrb stimulation.

Figure 3. The all-patients average response map, temporal lobe
(upper) Shown are all stimulus sites in the IFG transferred to MNI space, stratified by subregion, and
labeled with colored spheres (red, pOrb; yellow, pTri; green, pOpe). The dotted contour indicates a
recording area covered by data from no fewer than 5 patients. Any voxel within the dotted contour
contains the recording electrodes from no fewer than 5 patients within 15 mm of the center of the voxel.
(lower) The table shows the averaged response maps in the early and delayed phases stratified by IFG
subdivision. The 4D (movie) versions are provided in the Supplemental Materials to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of the response dynamics. While stimulation of pOpe elicited a prominent response
broadly in the temporoparietal area, stimulation of pOrb elicited the response in the anterior part of the
medial temporal gyrus (MTG) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and in the angular gyrus (AG).
Stimulation of pTri elicited a pattern intermediate between that of pOpe and pOrb. We set spherical
regions of interest (ROIs) of diameter of 20 mm, chosen to include the main response areas, and averaged
the voxels inside each ROI to obtain the waveform for that ROI. The waveforms in the rightmost column
show the time course of the response amplitudes in four ROIs located as follows: R1, in the anterior parts
of the middle and inferior temporal gyri (aMTG/aITG); R2, in the posterior part of the superior temporal
gyrus (pSTG); R3, in the posterior part of the middle temporal gyrus (pMTG); and R4, in the AG. Red and
blue vertical lines indicate the timing of typical early and delayed responses, respectively. The R1
waveforms in the pOpe and pTri rows are grayed out because of contamination by volume conduction.
(i.e., their time courses are similar to that of the stimulation neighborhood as demonstrated by the movie
version of the responses.) Color bars show relative amplitude. Note that the average response map
originally featured a Z-value for the amplitude, but it was smoothed by Gaussian kernel (FWHM 10 mm)
for visualization. Since the Gaussian smoothing blurs the values across the adjacent voxels while keeping
the sum, the values decrease after smoothing.

Topographical analysis of frontotemporal connectivity
To statistically validate the differences in connectivity pattern visualized
with the 3D average response map, we investigated the topographical
distribution of the early negative (N1) responses (Figure 4A, B). In pOrb
stimulation, the N1 response sites clustered in the anterior inferior part of the
lateral temporal area. On the other hand, in pOpe stimulation, the N1 response
sites clustered in the posterior part of the lateral temporal area. Stimulation of
pTri elicited N1 responses at sites between the former two clusters. The spatial
distribution was significantly different between any pair of the three parts, pOrb,
pTri, and pOpe by Wilk’s lambda, < 0.01. When the scatter plot was confined to
p

the max response sites for N1, the statistical differences remained significant
(Figure 4B).

Figure 4. Topographical analysis of cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) connectivity, temporal lobe
(A, B) To visualize the spatial distribution of the CCEP response in the lateral temporal cortices
due to stimulation in the IFG, we plotted the N1 response sites in the MNI y-z plane with different colors
for each stimulus area in the IFG. All response sites that satisfied the amplitude criterion of > 6 SDs of
the baseline fluctuation were plotted. (A) Shown is the spatial distribution of all response sites in the
lateral temporal area in the MNI y-z plane. The red circles, orange triangles, and green asterisks
indicate responses to stimulation in pOrb, pTri, and pOpe, respectively. We statistically tested the
difference in the response distribution for each pairwise combination of the three stimulus groups (pOrb,
pTri, and pOpe) by F-test. We selected the stimulus sites so that the three stimulus groups would be
mutually exclusive, excluding those stimulus sites whose electrodes located over the different
subdivision of the IFG. (B) Shown is the spatial distribution of the maximal (max) sites. The legend for
the symbols is the same as in (A). The differences among the 2D distributions were tested with Wilks’
lambda as above. (C) We generated two scatter plots to show the spatial correlation between X and Y1,
and between X and Y2. In these scatter plots, linear regression analysis for each response area (STG,
MTG, and ITG) was performed. Shown is the spatial correlation between the stimulus sites and the
maximal response sites. The locations of the IFG stimulus sites are approximated as their MNI
coordinates on the anterior-posterior axis (i.e., the distance from the midpoint of the ventral third of the
precentral sulcus, PreCS). Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that the main axis of the response
distribution is the anterior-posterior axis of the temporal lobe (Y1, first PCA component, left). Y1 is
linearly correlated with the anterior-posterior position of the stimulus sites in every part of the temporal
area, i.e., in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), MTG, and ITG (middle). Note that the value is always
positive in the IFG and that a larger value indicates a more anterior location. We also used the second
PCA component as the Y2-axis, which is orthogonal to the Y1-axis. Larger values on the Y2-axis indicate
more superior locations. Y2 values are not correlated with the location of the stimulus site (right).

The finding that pTri stimulation showed a connectivity pattern
intermediate between those of pOpe and pOrb stimulation implied a gradient in
the connectivity pattern revealed by IFG stimulation. We performed a linear
regression analysis based on the coordinates of stimulus sites and response sites.
The locations of the stimulus sites were linearly correlated with those of the N1
max response sites in the lateral temporal area (Figure 4C). In the
anterior-posterior axis, the regression line could be calculated both in each
temporal gyrus (STG, = 2.37 × - 56.27,

In summary, the more anterior part of the IFG connects to the more anterior part
of the lateral temporal area, while the more posterior IFG connects to the more
posterior temporal area, indicating a connectivity gradient along the
anterior-posterior axis. We also analyzed all response sites instead of maximal
response sites and observed a similar gradient of connectivity supported by linear
regression analyses.

The averaged response map clearly demonstrated the connectivity between
each IFG subdivision and the inferior parietal area. In the present study, pOrb
stimulation elicited discrete parietal CCEP responses in three of five patients
who had a grid on the parietal lobe (Figure 5). In all three patients, pOrb
stimulation elicited early negative (N1) response in the AG, while pTri or pOpe
stimulation elicited N1 response in the SMG. The N1 peak latency in the inferior
parietal area was always longer in pOrb stimulation than in pTri and pOpe
stimulation, as shown by the following data: patient 1, 45 ms (pOrb stimulation,
AG) vs. 31 ms (pTri stimulation, SMG) and 37 ms (pTri stimulation, SMG);
patient 9, 43 ms (pOrb stimulation, AG) vs. 31 ms (pTri stimulation, AG) and 34
ms (pOpe stimulation, SMG); patient 14, 34 ms (pOrb stimulation, AG) vs. 27 ms
(pTri stimulation, SMG) and 31 ms (pOpe stimulation, SMG).

Reciprocality
We investigated the occurrence rates of reciprocality in the connections
between the IFG pOrb and the temporal and parietal areas (Table 2). We
stimulated pOrb through a total of 41 stimulus sites and observed an anterograde
CCEP response in 52 electrodes in the temporal area. Among them, 22 electrodes
showed a max response. Due to limitations of time in the operating room, we were
able to stimulate only 36 electrode pairs that included at least one of the
anterograde response sites, and observed 25 “reciprocal” connections (25/36 =
69.44%) with max retrograde responses at the “initial” stimulus site. When the
analysis is confined to max anterograde response sites, we were able to stimulate
18 electrode pairs that included at least one of the anterograde max response
sites, and observed 13 reciprocal connections (13/18 = 72.22%). We performed a
similar analysis of the no-response electrodes as a negative control. We
aggregated all CCEP recordings that included at least one no-response electrode
(333 total), and among them, we found 30 reciprocal connections (30/333 = 9.01%).
The occurrence rate of reciprocal connections was significantly higher at max
response sites or at all response sites than at no-response sites (unpaired -test,
t

< 0.0001, uncorrected).
We performed a similar investigation on the connectivity between pOrb and

the parietal area and observed similar results, although the numbers were
smaller: 3 reciprocal responses upon stimulation of 7 max anterograde response
sites (3/7 = 42.86%), 6 reciprocal responses upon stimulation of 11 anterograde
response sites (6/11 = 54.55%), and 8 reciprocal responses upon stimulation of 93
no-response sites (8/93 = 8.60%). The occurrence rate was significantly higher in
both maximal response sites and all response sites than in no-response sites
(unpaired -test, < 0.05, uncorrected).

The occurrence rate was defined as the number of stimulus sites in the temporal or parietal
lobe where reciprocal connectivity was discovered divided by the number of stimulus sites
where retrograde stimulation was performed. Retrograde stimulation is defined as the
stimulation through the electrode with the CCEP response (classified into three groups; max,
all, and no response) by IFG pOrb stimulation. See supplementary material for the detailed
method to judge reciprocality. Asterisk (*) indicates p-value < 0.001 (unpaired t-test,

Comparison with resting-state functional connectivity
The connectivity pattern elicited by stimulation of pOrb was generally
similar to that of the resting-state functional connectivity obtained from the
NeuroSynth database by specifying the seed as a stimulus site in IFG pOrb
(Figure 6A, B). The distribution was similar between the two connectivity
modalities in the anterior part of the ITG and MTG and in the inferior parietal
lobule, while a difference was observed in the posterior part of the MTG (rs-fMRI
positive, CCEP negative). The discrepancy is attributable to the presence of an
indirect correlation via the posterior IFG (pTri and pOpe) for rs-fMRI connectivity,
because pTri showed strong correlation with both pOrb and the posterior MTG.
Because the resting-state functional connectivity is a measure of correlation, it
inevitably visualizes a chain of strong relationships as a single indirect
relationship.

Discussion
Based on a compilation of CCEP data, we investigated the connectivity
pattern between the IFG and the temporoparietal area. The CCEP response
pattern indicated a gradual transition of connectivity from stimulus sites in the
posterior IFG (pOpe) to those in the anterior IFG (pOrb). Topographical analysis
of stimulus and response sites confirmed the presence of a connectivity gradient
between IFG and the temporal lobe along the anterior-posterior axis. In
particular, the anterior part of the IFG (pOrb) showed connectivity to the anterior
lateral temporal area, which has not been well delineated by frozen-dissection,
although a recent study utilizing probabilistic tractography demonstrated the
connectivity between the pOrb and the lateral surface of the rostral temporal lobe
(Binney RJ

et al.

2012). We discuss the functional and clinical aspects of these

results below.

Candidate white matter pathways between the anterior IFG and temporal lobe
The present CCEP findings revealed connections between the anterior IFG
(pOrb) and the anterior lateral temporal lobe. Although CCEP does not provide
direct evidence about the underlying white-matter pathways, recent

in vivo

and

post-mortem anatomical studies utilizing diffusion tractography and frozen

dissection (Klinger’s method) potentially yield some clarification of the
white-matter fibers terminating in the IFG. They consistently find that the
anterior part (pOrb) and the posterior part (pTri and pOpe) of the IFG receive
distinct fibers. That is, pOrb receives the termination of the IFOF (especially the
superficial component) and UF, while pTri and pOpe receive terminations from
the SLF and AF (Catani M et al. 2005; Barrick TR et al. 2007; Glasser MF and JK
Rilling 2008; Lawes INC et al. 2008; Vassal F et al. 2016). Based on these
anatomical findings, it seems plausible that upon pOrb stimulation, the electrical
impulse is conveyed through the IFOF or UF, rather than the SLF or AF, to the
anterior lateral temporal lobe. A different connectivity pattern from each IFG
subdivision was also indicated by probabilistic tractography (Anwander A et al.
2007). That study demonstrated that the connectivity signature originating from
pOpe represented the AF, while that from pOrb represented the UF and IFOF. As
both structures pass through the extreme capsule in the temporal stem, we
expect the existence of a pathway between the IFG pOrb and the anterior lateral
temporal lobe via the extreme capsule. Since the UF mainly terminates in the
temporal pole, which was not covered by the electrode grids in this study, the
connectivity between the IFG pOrb and the anterior lateral temporal lobe implies
the existence of the temporal branch of the IFOF, which we referred to as IFOF-t.

The bundle comprised of the UF and IFOF-t can be depicted as a fan-shaped
structure spreading over the temporal lobe, as illustrated in the classical textbook
by Dejerine J and A Dejerine-Klumpke (Figure 6D). Here, we call this structure
the “frontotemporal radiation.”
Although the IFOF-t has not been found in recent frozen-dissection or
tractography studies, the existence of such connectivity is supported by our
finding of reciprocality for this connectivity (Table 2) and by similarity with the
resting-state functional connectivity (Figure 6). The reciprocal connectivity under
the discussion implies the functional relevance of the connectivity. The
resemblance between CCEP connectivity and rs-fMRI connectivity validates the
existence of connectivity, as the CCEP amplitude is reported to correlate with the
rs-fMRI connectivity (Keller CJ, CJ Honey, L Entz

, et al.

2014). Furthermore, in

one recent study, where whole-brain deterministic tractography was performed
and virtual dissection of the UF and IFOF by a novel “stem-based” approach was
carried out, a fanning structure comprising the UF and IFOF was visualized,
including what we call IFOF-t (Hau J, S Sarubbo, JC Houde, et al. 2016). The
discrepancy between the CCEP and the frozen-dissection/tractography results is
attributable to two points. One is the presence of small fiber diameters in the
ventral pathway (UF and IFOF), as revealed in an electron microscopic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/702753; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

49

investigation (Liewald D et al. 2014). The other is that, like all fibers running
through the extreme capsule complex and temporal stem, the IFOF-t is closely
bundled with many other, major long tracts (Martino J, F Vergani, et al. 2010;
Peltier J et al. 2010; Ribas EC et al. 2015; Bajada CJ, B Banks, et al. 2017). In the
frozen-dissection technique, the frozen white matter is peeled along the principal
fiber direction, which means that small fibers running across the major direction
are destroyed (Zemmoura I et al. 2016). The tractography technique is based on
the direction of local water diffusivity, which represents the principal direction of
fibers within the voxel, and will, therefore, neglect the small crossing fibers (Tuch
DS et al. 2003; Mukherjee P et al. 2008). CCEP relies on neurophysiological
measurement, and thus makes it a more sensitive method for tracing crossing
fibers.

Candidate white matter pathways between the anterior IFG and the parietal lobe
In the present study, pOrb stimulation elicited discrete responses in the
parietal area, and stimulation at the response sites revealed reciprocal
connections. Based on the above discussion, pOrb stimulation is assumed to
propagate through the IFOF. In the parietal termination, CCEP responses were
found predominantly in the AG, which is known to be one of the posterior

terminations of the IFOF (Caverzasi E et al. 2014; Hau J, S Sarubbo, G Perchey,
et al. 2016). We cannot exclude the possibility that anterior IFG-AG connectivity
is mediated by the SLF III because this tract is also reported to project to the AG
and anteriorly as far as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Mars RB et al. 2011;
Seghier ML 2013; Parlatini V et al. 2017). However, to the best of our knowledge,
there has been no report proving that the frontal termination of the SLF III
clearly includes the IFG pOrb.

Longer latencies of CCEP with stimulation in pOrb
The relatively long onset latency of CCEP responses seen with pOrb
stimulation is consistent with the existence of the IFOF-t, since, in an electron
microscopic investigation, the fiber diameter of the ventral pathway (UF and
IFOF) was found to be smaller than that of the dorsal pathway (SLF) (Liewald D
et al. 2014) and conduction velocity is well known to increase linearly with fiber
diameter (Hursh JB 1939). The longer response latency seen with pOrb
stimulation is also consistent with the fact that pOrb showed a lower myelin
density than pTri or pOpe in recent myelin-density mapping studies (Glasser MF
and DC Van Essen 2011; Glasser MF et al. 2016). The observation of a lower
myelin density supports the possibility that the axons originating in the area are

51

less myelinated and therefore have lower conduction velocities than those from
pTri or pOpe.

A connectivity gradient in the IFG
The linear regression analysis based on the coordinates of the stimulus and
response sites indicated that the IFG is connected to the lateral temporal cortex
with a gradation in the anterior-posterior axis. It is not only consistent with the
presence of a fan-shaped structure, but also implies a seamless transition from
the dorsal stream to the ventral stream in the IFG. Recently, a functional and
connectivity gradient along the anterior-posterior axis were found not only in the
IFG (Hagoort P 2005; Xiang HD et al. 2010; Udden J and J Bahlmann 2012;
Thiebaut de Schotten M et al. 2016) but also in the temporal lobe (Bajada CJ, RL
Jackson, et al. 2017; Jackson RL et al. 2018). Interestingly, in both, the anterior
part was associated with a modality-general network and the posterior part with
a modality-specific network. As Figure 6C shows, our results supported the
graded functional differentiation in the IFG. Although the concept of a
connectivity gradient appears in previous literature, this is the first report of an
anterior-posterior gradient in the temporal projection from the IFG based on an
electrical tracing method. Here, again, the gradual nature of the CCEP

52

connectivity agrees with the fanning structure illustrated in the historical
textbook, since the fan-shaped bundle of lines was drawn not only in the anterior
part but also in the posterior part of the IFG (Figure 6D).

Possibility of parcellation based on the CCEP connectivity
Our CCEP data indicated not only the existence of the two functional
networks in the IFG but also the possibility of parcellation based on the CCEP
connectivity. Though we can find numerous reports on the connectivity-based
parcellation of human brain by means of DTI (Anwander A

et al.

2007; Cloutman

LL and MA Lambon Ralph 2012) and rs-fMRI (Arslan S et al. 2018; Jackson RL
al.

et

2018; O'Muircheartaigh J and S Jbabdi 2018), to the best of our knowledge,

there are no reports on that of CCEP connectivity, though there have been reports
of the whole brain connectivity matrix (ROI analysis based on template)
collecting individual CCEP data (Entz L

et al.

2014; Donos C et al. 2016). As we

showed at the individual level (Figure 2) and in the group average level (Figure 3),
a 1 cm difference in the stimulus site resulted in a totally different connectivity
pattern and the average connectivity pattern was different for each stimulus area
in the IFG. Compared to the MRI-based methods, which make use of the whole
brain connectivity data, the CCEP-based parcellation seems to be difficult since

53

the spatial resolution is no better than MRI and the CCEP data is collected only
beneath the implanted electrodes. However, the CCEP-based method takes
advantage of CCEP, which is based on direct electrical stimulation and is free of
disadvantages such as artifacts caused by edema or tumors in MRI. Especially for
such an eloquent area as the IFG on the dominant side, the CCEP
connectivity-based parcellation is clinically important because it enables
functional mapping without requiring the patient’s conscious cooperation as is
often the case with children or patients with cognitive disturbance. Although
these results must be verified with a larger population, the present study proved
that the parcellation of a functionally confluent area such as the IFG solely by
CCEP is feasible.

Functional implications of the connectivity determined from pOrb
The present study demonstrated that visualizing the connectivity from the
anterior part of the IFG to the anterior part of the MTG/ITG is feasible by the
CCEP methodology. As discussed above, both the frontotemporal and the
frontoparietal connectivity from pOrb are considered to be mediated by
subcomponents of the IFOF. From a functional point of view, the IFOF is reported
to have a semantic function as evidenced by intraoperative electrical stimulation

at subcortical white-matter sites along the IFOF (Duffau H 2005). IFOF-t also
seems to be involved in a semantic function according to the following pieces of
evidence at its cortical terminations. The anterior IFG, which is the frontal
termination of the IFOF-t, has been revealed by means of fMRI to engage in
controlled semantic retrieval (Wagner AD

et al.

2001; Krieger-Redwood K

et al.

2015), and TMS in this area prolonged the response latency in a synonym
judgement task (Gough PM

et al.

2005; Hoffman P

et al.

2010). With regards to

the cortical termination in the temporal lobe, a PET activation study in healthy
subjects revealed the involvement of the anterior MTG and ITG in comprehension
of words presented auditorily and visually (Spitsyna G

et al.

2006) and studies

using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping in aphasic patients found
associations with semantic error in the lateral anterior temporal cortex (Walker
GM et al. 2011). It appears likely that the network between these two regions,
namely the IFOF-t, has a role in semantic processing.
We also determined the connectivity between pOrb and the AG, although the
number of patients was small (Figure 5). As mentioned previously, tractography
shows that the AG is connected with the pOrb, via the parietal branch of IFOF
(Caverzasi E

et al.

2014; Hau J, S Sarubbo, G Perchey

, et al.

2016), which was

confirmed by frozen-dissection (Curran EJ 1909; Martino J, C Brogna

, et al.

2010).

55

Just like pOrb, the AG is associated with a semantic role, as is proposed by
meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies focusing on semantic processing (Binder
JR et al. 2009), though the behavior of AG during task fMRI is significantly
different from that of ATL (Humphreys GF et al. 2015), which is the semantic
representational hub, as evidenced by a TMS study (Hoffman P

et al.

2010). The

facts that both the pOrb and AG are associated with semantic processing implies
that the parietal branch of the IFOF may be associated with semantic processing.
Even when looking outside the semantic network, a direct connection between
them deserves attention because not only the AG but also the anterior IFG is
involved in the default mode network (Buckner RL et al. 2008).

Clinical implications of the CCEP examination in IFG
Previous reports from our group showed that the intraoperative CCEP with
stimulation of pTri and pOpe is clinically useful to probe the posterior language
area (Wernicke’s area) through AF (Yamao Y

et al.

2014). The present study

extended its clinical implication to map the whole connectivity along the
anterior-posterior axis of the IFG. The graded connectivity along the IFG and the
temporal lobe underlies the functional gradient in both areas as discussed above:
the more anterior region connects to the more modality-general and the more

56

posterior to the more modality-specific. This comprehensive IFG connectivity
mapping would allow delineating the functional regions located in the anterior
part of the IFG and temporal lobes, such as the semantic control area. In the
future, we could refer to the “4D CCEP map” to guide the location of electrode
placement, when more patients are enrolled to refine its quality for clinical
practice.
In this study, we could not map the cortical functions in the anterior part of the
IFG and the temporal lobe during awake surgeries. To investigate the semantic
function, administration of specialized tasks for semantic cognition will be
required. Such deliberate tasks will be more time-consuming than intraoperative
tasks such as picture naming, and will demand more attention and motivation
from the patients, which is difficult to achieve in intraoperative settings.
Mapping studies in patients with chronically implanted electrodes for epilepsy
surgery will delineate more deliberate cognitive functions in these areas. We
believe mapping and preserving these higher functions out of the classical
“eloquent” area such as the Broca’s area would improve the quality of life for
patients undergoing neurosurgeries. In order to preserve the white matter
pathway such as the temporal stem, intraoperative sequential CCEP evaluation
would be clinically beneficial for patients who have lesions in the insula or the

temporal stem. Detailed longitudinal neuropsychological assessments of language
and semantic function warrants the functional relevance of these cortical and
subcortical areas for neurosurgery.

Study limitations and conclusion
This study investigated and clearly illustrated the connectivity between the
IFG and the temporoparietal area. However, some limitations should be noted.
First, we cannot absolutely exclude the pathological effect of the lesion,
though we excluded patients who had lesions or massive edema around the
temporal stem, the key structure of the ventral language network.
Second, the location of the electrodes was determined by the clinical
requirements of monitoring language function and the safety issues. For example,
electrode grids are placed on a flat surface for stability and for keeping a distance
from bridging vessels for safety. To compare the connectivity patterns among all
the three subdivisions in the IFG, we included only those patients where all the
three IFG subdivisions were covered by electrodes.
Third, this study lacks direct evidence on the white matter underpinning
connectivity between the anterior IFG and the anterior MTG/ITG. If we observe
an evoked potential in both terminals (the pOrb and the anterior MTG/ITG) by a
single-pulse electrical stimulation on the white matter, it would provide proof of

58

underpinning. Actually, we tried the stimulation of IFOF on the superior wall of
the inferior horn through the removal cavity using a 1 × 4 strip electrode after
anterior temporal lobectomy. However, the result was widespread CCEP
responses in almost all frontal and temporal electrodes, which made
interpretation difficult (unpublished data). At present, we have no direct evidence
though a smaller electrode and a weaker intensity of the stimulus may improve
the situation.
Fourth, this study includes no functional mapping of connectivity as
mentioned in the previous section. Further studies are expected to assess the
function of the connectivity observed here using electrical stimulation of the
white matter and the cortices in both terminals. These assessments should be
included in future studies because we believe that it is necessary for future
neurosurgeons to be aware of neural structure function within the operative field
even if it is out of the classical “eloquent” area.
Last, the number of patients in the present study is smaller than in other
studies that visualized connectivity using CCEP. Recently, several connectivity
maps based on a larger population of patients with implanted electrodes have
been published (Entz L

et al.

2014; Donos C

et al.

2016; Trebaul L et al. 2018).

Although our study includes a relatively small number of patients, it is

noteworthy that all our patients had single pulse stimulation in all subdivisions
of the IFG available for the observation of differences in connectivity patterns and
that all data were collected within one institute, which eliminates concerns about
differences in stimulus parameters and the measurement environment.
Our intraoperative CCEP data showed that the anterior IFG is connected to
the anterior MTG/ITG. Combined with prior anatomical knowledge about the
frontal termination of language-related fibers, these results show that the
anterior IFG has a connection with the anterior MTG/ITG through the ventral
stream (referred to herein as the IFOF-t) that appears as a fan-shaped structure,
here named the “fronto-temporal radiation,” together with the UF and the
classical IFOF. The anterior-posterior gradient in the connectivity we observed
between the IFG and the temporal area suggests the presence of a gradual
transition in IFG efferents between the ventral stream and the dorsal stream.
