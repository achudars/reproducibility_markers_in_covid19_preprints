Abstract

21

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, the

22

most common neoplastic disease of cattle, which is closely related to human T-cell

23

leukemia viruses. BLV has spread worldwide and causes a serious problem for the cattle

24

industry. The cellular receptor specifically binds with viral envelope glycoprotein (Env)

25

and this attachment mediates cell fusion to lead virus entry. BLV Env reportedly binds

26

to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1, but whether the CAT1/SLC7A1

27

is an actual receptor for BLV remains unknown. Here, we showed that CAT1

28

functioned as an infection receptor, interacting with BLV particles. Cells expressing

29

undetectable CAT1 levels were resistant to BLV infection but became highly

30

susceptible upon CAT1 overexpression. CAT1 exhibited specific binding to BLV

31

particles on the cell surface and co-localized with the Env in endomembrane

32

compartments and membrane. Knockdown of CAT1 in permissive cells significantly

33

reduced binding to BLV particles and BLV infection. In addition, bovine serum with

34

neutralizing activity from a BLV-infected cattle inhibited BLV particles. Expression of

35

CAT1 from various species demonstrated no species-specificity for BLV infection,

36

implicating CAT1 as a functional BLV receptor responsible for its broad host range.

37

These findings provide insights for BLV infection and for developing new strategies for

Author Summary

41

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which can infect a variety of animal species and induce

42

lymphoma in cattle, is a member of the family Retroviridae. BLV induces huge

43

economic losses by not only lymphoma but also subclinical forms of the disease. In

44

addition, BLV is frequently used as an animal model of human T-cell leukemia virus

45

(HTLV), as BLV has many similar characteristics to HTLV. Thus, understanding BLV

46

pathogenesis contribute to resolve not only BLV- but also HTLV-induced problems.

47

Retroviral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is specifically recognized by the cellular

48

receptor at cell surface, which induces a conformational changes between viral and cell

49

membrane to entry. Thus, the elucidation of cellular receptor for BLV infection is very

50

important for virus entry. However, the BLV receptor has not been identified yet. In the

51

current study, we found that BLV Env protein binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1

52

(CAT1)/SLC7A1 at cell surface, artificial expression of CAT1 in CAT1-negative cells

53

confers the cells susceptible to BLV infection, and CAT1-silencing significantly

54

reduces BLV infection, concluding that CAT1 is the BLV receptor. These findings will

55

have far reaching great advantages of insights in the retrovirus study.

Introduction

57

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, a B-

58

cell leukemia/lymphoma [1-4] that has spread worldwide and causes serious problems

59

for the cattle industry [5]. The natural hosts of BLV are domestic cattle and water

60

buffaloes [1] but BLV can also be experimentally transmitted to several other animal

61

species, such as sheep [6, 7], goats [8], pigs [9], rats [10], rabbits [11], and chickens

62

[12]. However, BLV induces leukemia/lymphoma only in cattle and sheep [1, 4].

63

Importantly, BLV has been detected in the breast epithelium of humans [13-16]. In

64

addition to the many studies showing that the BLV host range is broad, BLV can also

65

successfully infect a variety of cells in vitro [17].

66

Like other retroviruses, the BLV genome comprises gag, pro, pol, and env, as well as

67

regulatory genes tax and rex and accessory genes R3 and G4 [1, 4]. The Gag protein

68

encoded by gag plays important structural roles in the assembly of virions at the plasma

69

membrane and in genome packaging. BLV env encodes precursor Pr72 envelope

70

glycoprotein (Env), which is glycosylated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi

71

apparatus [18] and is processed into two mature proteins, the surface glycoprotein (SU)

72

subunit gp51 and the transmembrane (TM) subunit gp30 [19, 20]. The gp51 and gp30

73

proteins form a stable complex through disulfide bonds [20] and are incorporated into

74

budding viral particles [21]. Gp51 contains three conformational epitopes (F, G, and H)

75

in its N-terminus that are recognized by neutralizing antibody [4, 22]. The C-terminus of

76

gp51 also contains four linear epitopes (A, B, D, and E) [23]. In addition, there is evidence

77

that the N-terminal half of mature gp51 plays important roles in virus infectivity and

78

syncytium formation, suggesting that it probably contains the receptor-binding domain

79

(RBD) [20]. However, the actual cellular receptor for BLV infection has not been

80

identified.

81

The env genes of BLV and its close relative human T-cell leukemia virus type 1

82

(HTLV-1) are highly conserved [1, 4]. In particular, their Env proteins show 36% identity

83

in their amino acid sequences [4]. Entry of these retroviruses into target cells is initiated

84

by interaction between Env and host cellular receptors [24, 25]. Glucose transporter 1

85

(GLUT1) [26], neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) [27], and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)

86

[28] have been determined to be cellular receptors for HTLV attachment and/or infection.

87

When NRP-1, GLUT1, and the SU subunit of HTLV-1 are co-expressed in cells, they are

88

able to form a stable tripartite complex [27]. The initial attachment and concentration of

89

HTLV-1 virions at the cell surface [29] are induced via interaction of HSPG with the C-

90

terminal domain of the SU subunit of HTLV-1 [30]. HSPGs also directly bind with NRP-1,

91

which forms a complex with HTLV-1 Env to induce conformational changes in the SU

92

subunit allowing residues D106 and Y114 of SU to bind with GLUT1 [26, 30]. This multi-

93

receptor usage is required for HTLV-1 entry into target cells [30, 31].

94

GLUT1 is composed of 12 hydrophobic TM domains, six extracellular loops (ECL),

95

and seven intracellular domains [32]. Similar to GLUT1, cationic amino acid transporter

96

1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1 has 14 potential membrane-spanning domains and has been identified

97

as a membrane receptor on mouse cells for ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (eMuLVs)

98

[33]. CAT1 is a 622-amino acid sequences of protein that is extremely hydrophobic and

99

implicated in sodium-independent transport of arginine, lysine, and histidine [33-35].

100

Two distinct motifs (YGE and HE) in the third extracellular loop of CAT1 are known to

101

bind with the N-terminus of the eMuLV SU subunit for viral entry [36, 37] into mouse

102

and rat cells [38], indicating that the third extracellular loop in CAT1 is a determinant for

103

eMuLV infection. CAT1 of human cells does not provide susceptibility to eMuLV

104

infection; however, expressing mouse CAT1 in human cells can result in acquired

105

susceptibility [39]. Similar to human cells, hamster cells are completely resistant to

106

eMuLV infection [38] and CAT1 proteins from other animals are also resistant to eMuLV

107

infection, indicating CAT1 may provide the species-specificity for eMuLV infection.

serves as a cellular receptor for BLV. In the current study, we detected CAT1 protein in

111

various cells and its correlation with susceptibility to BLV infection. Next, using bovine

112

CAT1/SLC7A1 expression plasmid, we investigated whether exogenous expression of

113

CAT1 induces BLV infection in CAT1-negative, BLV-resistant cells. In addition, we

114

determined the CAT1 and BLV particles binding and co-localization with the Env in the

115

cells. Furthermore, we analyzed the impacts of CAT1 knockdown on BLV cell-free and

116

cell-to-cell infection and BLV particles binding. Finally, we clarified the species-specific

117

susceptibility of CAT1 for BLV infection.

128

K1 cells were the only cell line that did not express detectable levels of CAT1 protein.

129

As BLV-infected cells fuse with neighboring cells thereby forming syncytia in

130

culture, BLV infection is typically monitored in vitro using syncytium formation. To

131

evaluate a correlation between CAT1 expression and susceptibility to BLV infection, we

132

inoculated each cell line with BLV by co-culturing them with BLV-infected cells or by

133

transfection with the infectious molecular clone pBLV-IF2 (Fig. 1). Inoculation with

134

BLV induced syncytia in HeLa, 293T, and CC81 cells, which expressed CAT1 at high

135

levels, but not in PK15 cells, which expressed CAT1 at low levels. No syncytia were

136

detected in FLK-BLV cells since the CAT1 was already occupied by the BLV Env protein.

137

In contrast, CHO-K1 cells, which did not express detectable levels of CAT1, failed to

138

form syncytia upon inoculation with BLV. These results indicated that CAT1 expression

139

correlated with cellular susceptibility to BLV infection.

140
141

CAT1/SLC7A1 expression induced BLV infection. To investigate the role of CAT1 as

142

a receptor for BLV, we constructed an EGFP-tagged bovine CAT1 expression plasmid

143

(bCAT1/pEGFP-N1) and CAT1 expression was visualized. A single band of endogenous

144

CAT1 with the expected molecular size of 68 kDa was detected in positive control CC81

145

cells using an anti-CAT1 antibody, but no specific bands were detected in non-transfected

or pEGFP-N1-transfected CHO-K1 cells. In bCAT1/pEGFP-N1-transfected CHO-K1

147

cells, a protein band of the expected molecular size of 95.5 kDa was believed to be a

148

glycosylated EGFP-tagged bovine CAT1 protein with several additional bands of lower

149

molecular sizes also detected by western blotting using an anti-CAT1 antibody (Fig. 2A,

150

upper panel) and anti-EGFP antibody (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The lower molecular size

151

bands were thought to be glycosylated variants.

152

To evaluate whether overexpression of exogenous CAT1 would induce syncytia upon

153

BLV infection in CHO-K1 cells, which do not normally express detectable levels CAT1

154

and are resistant for BLV infectious, bCAT1/pEGFP-N1 were transiently co-transfected

155

with pBLV-IF2 into CHO-K1 cells. Interestingly, multinucleated syncytia expressing

156

EGFP were detected in the co-transfected CHO-K1 cells, despite the fact that syncytia

157

without EGFP expression were not observed (Fig. 2B, lower panel). In contrast, CHO-

158

K1 cells exhibited EGFP expression with no syncytia formation when transfected with

159

bCAT1/pEGFP-N1 alone or with negative control vector pEGFP-N1. Furthermore, BLV

160

infection via cell-to-cell transmission using FLK-BLV cells or cell-free transmission

161

using culture supernatants derived from FLK-BLV cells resulted in remarkable syncytia

162

that expressed EGFP in bCAT1/pEGFP-N1-transfected CHO-K1 cells. In contrast, there

163

was no syncytia formation when CHO-K1 cells not expressing CAT1 were infected with

164

BLV either by cell-to-cell infection or cell-free infection or transfected with pBLV-IF2

165

(Fig. 2B upper panel). These results clearly indicated that bovine CAT1 expression in

166

resistant CHO-K1 cells conferred susceptible to BLV infection.

167
168

CAT1/SLC7A1 bound to BLV particles on the cell surface. BLV binds to cellular

169

receptors on target cells, its membrane fusion is activated, and the virus enters the host

170

cells. To further determine whether CAT1 acted as a cell surface receptor for BLV

171

infection, we verified that BLV particles bound to CAT1 using flow cytometry (Fig. 3).

172

CHO-K1 cells were transfected with bCAT1/pEGFP-N1 and incubated for 1 h or 2 h at

173

4°C with BLV particles purified from the culture supernatant of FLK-BLV cells. The

174

cells were then washed and labeled with an anti-gp51 monoclonal antibody (BLV-1)

175

followed by an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect the BLV

176

particles adsorbed to the cell membrane of CHO-K1 cells. BLV-binding and EGFP-

177

tagged CAT1 expression were analyzed using flow cytometry. The proportions of APC-

178

EGFP double-positive cells were markedly increased in bCAT1/pEGFP-N1-transfected

179

cells (18.7% and 23.7% at 1 h and 2 h post-incubation, respectively) compared with those

180

of control CHO-K1 cells (0.04% and 0.24% in mock-transfected cells at 1 h and 2 h post-

181

incubation, respectively). These results demonstrated that BLV particles bound to CAT1

182

at the cellular membrane of cells expressing bovine CAT1, but not to cells that did not

183

express CAT1. These findings strongly suggest that CAT1 functioned as a BLV

184

attachment receptor.

185

In addition, we used bovine serum (BLV serum) with neutralizing activity from a BLV-

186

infected cattle [40] to examine whether the BLV serum affects the binding of CAT1-

187

expressing CC81-GREMG cells and BLV particles. This BLV serum has been reported

188

to inhibit syncytium formation when CC81-GREMG cells co-cultured with FLK-BLV

189

cells [40]. CC81-GREMG cells were treated with purified BLV particles in the absence

190

or presence of the serum for 2 h at 4°C. As shown in Fig. 3C the 60% of CC81-GREMG

191

cells bound with BLV particles as positive control in the absence of serum (grey). When

192

CC81-GREMG cells were treated with BLV particles in the presence of control serum

193

(1:10 and 1:50 dilution), 57% and 49% of cells bound with BLV particles, respectively

194

(blue). In contrast, when the cells were incubated with BLV particles in the presence of

195

the BLV serum, proportion of BLV-bound cells was significantly reduced to about 5.8%

196

(red). The results showed that the neutralizing serum inhibits the interaction between host

197

cells and BLV particles.

the cell membrane. To further confirm the binding between BLV particles and CAT1

201

described above, we visualized the subcellular localization of CAT1 and Env in

202

bCAT1/pEGFP-N1-transfected FLK-BLV cells and bCAT1/pEGFP-N1-transfected

203

PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cells were labeled with

204

an anti-BLV Env primary antibody followed by an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated

205

secondary antibody (red fluorescence) to detect cells expressing Env and stained with

206

Hoechst 33342 (blue fluorescence) for detection of the nucleolus. EGFP-linked CAT1

207

was detected as green fluorescence. The intensity differences of the two signals in FLK-

208

BLV cells and PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells were analyzed and the results depicted as a line scan

209

(Fig. 4). In FLK-BLV cells that expressed EGFP-tagged bovine CAT1, the signal location

210

of CAT1 (green) and Env (red) mainly coexisted in endomembrane compartments

211

(between arrows 3 and 4 of Fig. 4a) and to a slight extent at the cell membrane (between

212

arrows 1 and 2 of Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, the dual labeling of CAT1 (green) and

213

Env (red) was detected in endomembrane compartments (between arrows 2 and 3) and at

214

the cell membrane (between arrows 1 and 2, and 4 and 5) in PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells that

215

exogenously expressed bovine CAT1. The results showed that CAT1/SLC7A1 and Env

216

markedly colocalized in endomembrane compartments and at the cell membrane. Taken

217

together, these findings demonstrated a specific binding between bovine CAT1 and Env.

CAT1/SLC7A1 knockdown reduced BLV infection and the binding between

220

CAT1/SLC7A1 and BLV Env on the cell surface. To further confirm whether CAT1

221

acted as a cellular surface receptor for BLV infection, the impact of CAT1 knockdown

222

on BLV infection was analyzed. To visualize the BLV infection, we used CC81-GREMG

223

cells. CC81-GREMG cell is a CC81-derived reporter cell line harboring pBLU3GREM-

224

EGFP, which contains a mutant form of the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in

225

the U3 region of the BLV long terminal repeat [40, 41] that specifically responses to BLV

226

Tax expression. Knockdown with two small interfering RNAs (siRNA1 and siRNA2) that

227

target different regions of the CAT1 mRNA was confirmed by western blot analysis 48 h

228

post treatment using an anti-CAT1 antibody (Fig. 5A). CC81-GREMG cells in which

229

CAT1 expression had been suppressed were inoculated with BLV using either cell-free

230

culture supernatants derived from FLK-BLV cells (Fig. 5B upper panel) or cell-to-cell

231

infection using FLK-BLV cells (Fig. 5B lower panel). The number of syncytia was

232

significantly decreased in the CC81-GREMG cells treated with either CAT1-specific

233

siRNA1 or siRNA2 compared to that in the negative control siRNA-transfected cells or

234

in untreated cells. These results showed that knockdown of CAT1 inhibited cell-free and

235

cell-to-cell BLV infections.

236

Binding of BLV particles to the CC81-GREMG cells in which CAT1 expression had

237

been knocked down was analyzed using the same approach as that described for Fig. 3.

238

When CAT1 expression was reduced in CC81-GREMG cells by siRNA2 treatment

239

compared to that in the negative control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5C upper panel),

240

the number of Env binding cells was significantly decreased (Fig. 5C lower column),

241

indicating that the siRNA-mediated CAT1 knocked down attenuated the binding of

242

BLV particles to target cells.

243

Taken together, these results indicated that CAT1 was required for BLV binding and

244

infection. This supports the conclusion that CAT1 acted as a cell surface receptor for

245

BLV infection.

Species specificity of CAT1/SLC7A1 in susceptibility to BLV infection. To analyze

included mouse NIH 3T3 cells, rat F10 cells, Chinese hamster THK cells, cat CC81 cells,

251

sheep FLK-BLV cells, pig PK15 cells, monkey COS1 cells, and human Hela cells. EGFP-

252

tagged CAT1 expression plasmids were constructed and CHO-K1 cells were transfected

with the plasmids. The CHO-K1-transfected cells were inoculated with culture

supernatants derived from FLV-BLV cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, all CAT1 proteins

255

induced syncytia upon BLV infection. These results suggested that CAT1 did not

256

demonstrate any species specificity for BLV infection. This was consistent with previous

257

reports showing that BLV is able to infect cells isolated from various species in vitro and

258

to propagate in various animal species in vivo.

259

To further confirm that CAT1 exhibited no species specificity for BLV infection,

260

the ovine CAT1/pEGFP-N1 that encoded EGFP-tagged sheep CAT1 and the porcine

261

CAT1/pEGFP-N1 that encoded EGFP-tagged pig CAT1 were transfected into FLK-BLV

262

and PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells. Since these cells expressed BLV, it is likely that the CAT1

263

protein was occupied by Env protein and thereby de novo BLV infection did not occur.

264

However, other mechanisms may have inhibited BLV infection. For example, host

265

defense factors that restrict BLV infection may have been induced in the cells. As shown

266

in Fig. 6B, syncytia containing EGFP fluorescence was observed in both CAT1-

267

overexpressed FLK-BLV cells and CAT1-overexpressed PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells, as well

268

as in cells transfected with bCAT1/pEGFP-N1. In contrast, syncytia formation was not

269

detected in the pEGFP-N1-transfected FLK-BLV cells or pEGFP-N1-transfected

270

PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells. Overexpression of CAT1 resulted in unoccupied receptor protein,

271

resulting in the cells becoming susceptible to BLV infection. These cells did not express

272

any inhibitors against BLV infection. These findings strongly suggested that ovine CAT1

273

and porcine CAT1 proteins allowed BLV infection and served as cellular receptors for

274

BLV infection.

275
276

Taken together, these results suggested that the CAT1 proteins do not have species
specificity for BLV infection, all role as a cellular receptor for BLV.

277
278

Discussion

279

In the current study, we demonstrated that CAT1 also associated with BLV particles at

280

the cell surface and functioned as a receptor for BLV infection. This is the first report

281

demonstrating the identification of a BLV receptor. The BLVRcp1 cDNA clone

282

corresponding to a bovine BLV receptor gene was previously isolated [42, 43]. BLVRcp1

283

appears to encode a protein that spans the plasma membrane once and has a molecular

284

mass of 94 kDa. This recombinant protein, when expressed in Escherichia coli, binds to

285

the BLV Env protein [42, 44] and transfection of the cDNA into mouse NIH 3T3 cells

286

greatly increases their susceptibility to BLV infection [42]. However, the open reading

287

frame (ORF) of the cDNA of the murine ortholog codes at a site 280 amino acids

288

upstream of the termination codon of the ORF of the bovine ortholog [45] and the mRNA

289

from bovine cells that hybridizes with BLVRcp1 is longer than the BLVRcp1 clone [42,

290

43]. In addition, mouse BLVR homolog is closely related to the δ subunit of adaptor-

291

related protein complex AP-3 and does not associate with the cell surface [45]. Taken

292

together, these findings suggest that this particular bovine protein is not the BLV receptor.

293

Based on our current study, we clearly demonstrated that the CAT1 protein was the actual

294

BLV receptor. This conclusion is based on the following findings: (i) CAT1 expression

295

in resistant cells conferred susceptible to BLV infection, (ii) CAT1 knockdown in

296

susceptible cells reduced BLV infection, and (iii) CAT1 exhibited specific binding to

297

BLV Env and coexisted with BLV Env. Furthermore, GLUT1, NRP-1, and HSPG have

298

been previously determined to be cellular receptors for HTLV, a BLV-related virus [27-

299

29]. In addition, BLV and HTLV do not exhibit receptor interference and so it is

300

anticipated that these viruses use distinct receptors [25]. These results also help confirm

301

that CAT1 acted as a receptor for BLV infection.

302

CAT1 protein is highly regulated through transcription, mRNA stability, translation,

303

and subcellular localization [46]. As expected, CAT1 is expressed in a wide variety of

304

cultured cell lines since it has essential roles in basic cellular functions [46]. Indeed,

305

CAT1 was ubiquitously expressed in cells from a variety of species and all CAT1s from

306

the examined species were associated with susceptible to BLV infection. Therefore, the

307

binding domain of CAT1 with BLV Env is predicted to be well conserved among various

308

species. However, CAT1 has high diversity in the third extracellular loop near the virus-

309

binding motif [38] for eMuLV infection. Further clarification regarding the precise roles

310

of CAT1 and its regulation in BLV infection will help define the molecular basis of BLV

311

entry. This includes determining the mode of binding for CAT1 with BLV Env. These

312

results may greatly facilitate the development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies

313

for BLV, which has spread worldwide and is responsible for serious problems in the cattle

314

industry.

specificity for BLV infection. The pEGFP-N1 expression plasmids encoding different

725

CAT1/SLC7A1 proteins were derived using various animal species, including cattle

726

(bovine), sheep (ovine), human, monkey (primate), pig (porcine), cat (feline), rat,

727

mouse, and Chinese hamster. The plasmids were constructed and transfected into CHO-

728

K1 cells. After 48 h transfection, the cells were added to culture supernatants of FLK-

729

BLV cells and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and

730

stained with 10 µg/mL Hoechst 33342. EGFP-expressing syncytia were detected using

731

EVOS2 fluorescence microscopy. (B) Ovine, porcine, and bovine CAT1/SLC7A1

732

proteins formed syncytia in both FLK-BLV and PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells following BLV

733

infection. The permanently BLV-infected FLK-BLV cells and PK15/pBLV-IF2 cells

734

stably transfected pBLV-IF2 were transfected with either ovine CAT1/pEGFP-N1,

735

porcine CAT1/pEGFP-N1, bovine CAT1/pEGFP-N1, or pEGFP-N1 and incubated for

736

48 h. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained using 10 µg/mL

737

Hoechst 33342. EGFP-expressing syncytia were detected using EVOS2 fluorescence

738

microscopy.
