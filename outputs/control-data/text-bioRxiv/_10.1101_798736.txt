Abstract
Wolbachia are maternally-inherited endosymbiotic bacteria found within many insect species. Aedes
mosquitoes experimentally infected with Wolbachia are being released into the field for Aedes-borne
disease control. These Wolbachia infections induce cytoplasmic incompatibility which is used to
suppress populations through incompatible matings or replace populations through the reproductive
advantage provided by this mechanism. However the presence of naturally-occurring Wolbachia in
target populations could interfere with both population replacement and suppression programs
depending on the compatibility patterns between strains. Aedes aegypti were thought to not harbor
Wolbachia naturally but several recent studies have detected Wolbachia in natural populations of this
mosquito. We therefore review the evidence for natural Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti to date and
discuss limitations of these studies. We draw on research from other mosquito species to outline the
potential implications of natural Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti for disease control. To validate
previous reports, we obtained a laboratory population of Ae. aegypti from New Mexico, USA, that
harbors a natural Wolbachia infection, and we conducted field surveys in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where
a natural Wolbachia infection has also been reported. However, we were unable to detect Wolbachia
infection in both the laboratory and field populations. Because the presence of naturally-occurring
Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti could have profound implications for Wolbachia-based disease control
programs, it is important to continue to accurately assess the Wolbachia status of target Aedes
populations.

Wolbachia infections in natural populations
Wolbachia are best known for their profound effects on host reproduction and more recently for their
applied use in disease control programs. Wolbachia infect approximately half of all insect species but
their prevalence varies widely between orders and genera (Weinert et al., 2015). Variation in infection
also occurs within species, ranging from low frequencies to fixation (Charlesworth et al., 2019,
Hilgenboecker et al., 2008). The prevalence of Wolbachia infections may be underestimated because
infections can occur at low densities that are undetectable by conventional PCR (Mee et al., 2015).
Multiple Wolbachia variants have been detected within the same species, such as in Drosophila simulans
(Martinez et al., 2017) and Culex pipiens (Atyame et al., 2011). Superinfections, where multiple
Wolbachia strains infect the same insect (Sinkins et al., 1995, Arthofer et al., 2009), also occur.
Although Wolbachia are maternally inherited, interspecific transfer may occur through parasitism
(Heath et al., 1999, Ahmed et al., 2015), consumption of infected individuals (Le Clec'h et al., 2013,
Brown and Lloyd, 2015), sharing a common environment (Huigens et al., 2004, Li et al., 2017) or other
mechanisms. Successful horizontal transmission is likely to be rare, but Wolbachia can spread rapidly
throughout populations once introduced (Kriesner et al., 2013, Turelli and Hoffmann, 1991). For
Wolbachia to spread they must increase host fitness. Wolbachia infections may alter host reproduction

to favor infected females over uninfected females, particularly through cytoplasmic incompatibility,
which gives a frequency-dependent advantage to infected females (O'Neill et al., 1997). Cytoplasmic
incompatibility results in fewer viable offspring in crosses between Wolbachia-infected males and
uninfected females. Wolbachia may also provide fitness advantages through the protection of hosts
against viruses (Teixeira et al., 2008, Hedges et al., 2008), nutritional provisioning (Brownlie et al., 2009),
increased fertility (Dobson et al., 2002) or changes in life history (Cao et al., 2019).
Insects that are not naturally infected with Wolbachia may be amenable to infection experimentally.
Novel Wolbachia infections have been generated through microinjection, where cytoplasm or purified
Wolbachia from an infected donor is transferred to an uninfected embryo (Hughes and Rasgon, 2014).
Deliberate transfers of Wolbachia between species are challenging and can take thousands of attempts
to generate a stable line (McMeniman et al., 2009, Walker et al., 2011). But once an infection is
introduced, Wolbachia infections have applications for pest and disease vector control since they can
alter host reproduction and block virus replication and transmission (Hoffmann et al., 2015).

Releases of novel Wolbachia infections for vector and disease control
There is increasing interest in deploying mosquitoes with experimentally-generated Wolbachia
infections into the field for disease control. Over 25 novel Wolbachia infection types have been
generated in mosquitoes through embryonic microinjection, mainly in the principal dengue vectors Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Ross et al., 2019b). Most of these infections induce cytoplasmic
incompatibility and many also reduce the ability of their hosts to transmit viruses, making them
desirable for field release. For mosquito species that are naturally Wolbachia-infected such as Ae.
albopictus, novel infections can be generated either by first removing the natural infections with
antibiotics (Suh et al., 2009, Calvitti et al., 2010) or by introducing the novel infection into an infected
mosquito, resulting in a superinfection (Zhang et al., 2015, Suh et al., 2016). Different novel Wolbachia
infections may be incompatible with each other (Ant et al., 2018) and the addition of Wolbachia strains
to create superinfections can lead to unidirectional incompatibility, where females of the superinfected
strain produce viable offspring following matings with males with any infection type, but superinfected
males induce cytoplasmic incompatibility when mated with singly infected and uninfected females
(Joubert et al., 2016).
Mosquitoes with novel Wolbachia infections are being released into the field for two main purposes:
population replacement and population suppression. The objective of the former approach is to replace
natural populations with mosquitoes possessing Wolbachia infections that interfere with virus
transmission. This is achieved through the release of males that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and
females that transmit the Wolbachia infection and have reduced vector competence (Walker et al.,
2011). Successful population replacement of Ae. aegypti with novel Wolbachia infections has been
achieved in several countries (Hoffmann et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2019, Nazni et al., 2019). Following
releases in Australia and Malaysia, Wolbachia infections have maintained a stable, high frequency in
most locations, coinciding with reduced local dengue transmission (O'Neill et al., 2018, Ryan et al., 2019,
Nazni et al., 2019). Population suppression can be achieved through male-only releases of Wolbachiainfected males, resulting in cytoplasmic incompatibility with wild females. This was first demonstrated in
1967 in Cx. pipiens (Laven, 1967) by exploiting the natural variation in Wolbachia infection types
between mosquitoes from different locations (Atyame et al., 2014). Other releases have used Wolbachia

from a closely related species through introgression (O'Connor et al., 2012) and novel Wolbachia
transinfections generated through microinjection (Mains et al., 2016, Zheng et al., 2019).
Both population replacement and suppression approaches rely on the novel Wolbachia infection types
inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility with the resident mosquito population. Thus, the presence of
natural Wolbachia infections in mosquitoes may interfere with disease control programs, making
population replacement or suppression challenging or even impossible.

Detections of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti
Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue virus and has been the focus of Wolbachia-based
population replacement efforts, with releases of mosquitoes with novel Wolbachia infections now
underway in over 10 countries (e.g. Nazni et al. (2019), Garcia et al. (2019), Hoffmann et al. (2011)).
Until recently, Ae. aegypti was not thought to harbor Wolbachia naturally (Kittayapong et al., 2000),
though it is clearly amenable to infection given the number of stable experimental infections generated
in this species (Ross et al., 2019b). Evidence for horizontal gene transfer between Wolbachia and Ae.
aegypti may reflect a historical infection (Klasson et al., 2009). The most comprehensive survey to date
found no evidence for Wolbachia infection in Ae. aegypti through PCR assays on pools of mosquitoes,
except in a single location where the experimentally-generated wMel strain of Wolbachia had been
released deliberately (Gloria-Soria et al., 2018). The lack of natural infection is advantageous for both
population replacement and suppression programs because any cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing
Wolbachia infection should be unidirectionally incompatible with wild populations.
Coon et al. (2016) detected Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti collected from Florida, USA using 16S rRNA
sequencing and multi-locus sequence typing. This discovery suggested that natural Wolbachia infections
may occur in Ae. aegypti, with its occurrence perhaps being geographically restricted or at a low
frequency in other populations. Since then, seven further studies have purported to detect Wolbachia in
natural populations of Ae. aegypti (Table 1). These studies report variable infection frequencies in
populations and identify infections from several Wolbachia supergroups. Most studies found that the
infections detected were closely related to or identical to the wAlbB infection that occurs natively in
Aedes albopictus (Coon et al., 2016, Balaji et al., 2019, Carvajal et al., 2019, Kulkarni et al., 2019), while
other studies also detected Wolbachia from supergroups that do not normally occur within Diptera
(Carvajal et al., 2019, Thongsripong et al., 2018). Most evidence is limited to molecular detection but
some studies established laboratory colonies and have reported maternal transmission of Wolbachia
(Kulkarni et al., 2019) and the loss of infection through antibiotic treatment (Balaji et al., 2019).

Similar to Ae. aegypti, Anopheles mosquitoes (which transmit Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria)
were also thought to be uninfected by Wolbachia, though several recent studies have detected
Wolbachia in this genus (Baldini et al., 2014, Jeffries et al., 2018, Ayala et al., 2019). In a critical analysis
of studies in Anopheles gambiae, Chrostek and Gerth (2019) assert that the evidence is currently
insufficient to diagnose natural infections in this species. We highlight similar issues with detections of
Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti but also discuss the potential implications for disease control if Wolbachia do
occur naturally in this species.

Potential implications of natural Wolbachia infections for releases of novel infections
The presence of natural Wolbachia infections may influence compatibility patterns between mosquitoes
with the novel Wolbachia infection and the natural population. These patterns are summarized in Figure
1, although crossing patterns in nature are likely to be more complex. Natural Wolbachia infections can
have heterogeneous densities and frequencies in populations (Calvitti et al., 2015), making compatibility
patterns hard to predict. Crosses may differ in the strength of incompatibility in different directions
(O'Neill and Paterson, 1992, Sinkins et al., 1995, Joubert et al., 2016) and there are also environmentdependent effects on cytoplasmic incompatibility including adult age (Kittayapong et al., 2002b) and
temperature (Ross et al., 2019a). The presence of Wolbachia superinfections also increases the number
of potential compatibility patterns (Dobson et al., 2004).

Figure 1. Potential crossing patterns between mosquitoes with novel Wolbachia infections that induce
cytoplasmic incompatibility and mosquito populations with or without the presence of natural
Wolbachia infections of different crossing types. (A) Crosses between mosquitoes with a novel
Wolbachia infection and uninfected mosquitoes result in unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility. (B)
When novel and natural Wolbachia infections exhibit the same crossing type, no cytoplasmic
incompatibility occurs. (C) Bidirectional incompatibility occurs when novel and natural Wolbachia
infections exhibit different crossing types. (D-E) Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility may occur in
favour of the natural (D) or (E) novel infection. These situations are most likely when the natural (D) or
novel (E) infection is a superinfection, where one strain is compatible with the single infection but the
other is not.

With most novel infections generated in Ae. aegypti, the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into
an uninfected population will lead to cytoplasmic incompatibility (Figure 1A). Reduced egg hatch from
crosses between infected males and uninfected females favours infected females. For a Wolbachia
infection to invade an uninfected population, its frequency must exceed a threshold which depends on
the fidelity of cytoplasmic incompatibility and maternal transmission and any fitness costs of the
infection (O'Neill et al., 1997).
The presence of natural Wolbachia infections in a population may result in crossing patterns that make
population replacement or suppression more challenging (Figure 1B-E). The following scenarios assume
that the natural infection is at fixation in the population. When novel and natural infections are
compatible with each other (no reduction in egg hatch in any combination), invasion will depend on the
relative fitness of each infection type due to a lack of cytoplasmic incompatibility (Figure 1B). Since
transinfections in mosquitoes typically impose fitness costs while natural infections tend to be beneficial
(Ross et al., 2019b), population replacement may be unachievable even if high frequencies are reached.
In this situation population suppression is impossible due to the lack of cytoplasmic incompatibility in

any direction. Such patterns occur in Cx. pipiens, with multiple compatible strains coexisting within
natural populations (Duron et al., 2011, Atyame et al., 2014).
Incompatibility between males of novel and natural infections and females of the opposite infection
type in both directions, or bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, may occur (Figure 1C). Bidirectional
incompatibility is desirable for population suppression programs because it reduces the risk that
inadvertently released females will replace natural populations (Moretti et al., 2018). Novel Wolbachia
infections that are bidirectionally incompatible with natural populations have been generated in Ae.
albopictus (Xi et al., 2006, Calvitti et al., 2010) by first removing the native superinfection which is at
high frequency in most natural populations (Kittayapong et al., 2002a, Joanne et al., 2015). Such strains
have been deployed successfully for population suppression (Mains et al., 2016). Bidirectional
incompatibility can also occur between natural populations of Drosophila simulans (O'Neill and Karr,
1990, Montchamp-Moreau et al., 1991), Nasonia wasps (Bordenstein and Werren, 2007) and Cx. pipiens
(Yen and Barr, 1973).
When bidirectional incompatibility occurs, population replacement will be difficult to achieve unless
high frequencies of the novel infection are reached. Where population replacement is successful, spread
beyond the release area is unlikely since the frequency required for invasion is 50% when fitness is equal
(O'Neill et al., 1997). Novel infections may instead persist with natural infections (Telschow et al., 2005),
particularly in fragmented populations (Keeling et al., 2003).
Unidirectional incompatibility may also occur between natural and novel infections (Figure 1D-E). If a
natural population harbors a double infection and a novel infection with a single Wolbachia strain is
released, this can result in unidirectional incompatibility favouring the natural infection if one strain of
the superinfection is compatible and the other is not (Figure 1D). In this situation, population
suppression is impossible and population replacement will be challenging, therefore such infections are
not being considered for release. Natural populations of Ae. albopictus are superinfected with the
wAlbA and wAlbB strains at a high frequency although either strain may occasionally be lost
(Kittayapong et al., 2002a, Joanne et al., 2015), resulting in unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility
(Dobson et al., 2004).
Aedes albopictus with novel Wolbachia infections have not been released for population replacement
but triple infections may suitable for this purpose (Fu et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2015). Novel triple
infections are unidirectionally incompatible with the natural double infection (Fu et al., 2010, Zheng et
al., 2019) (Figure 1E), resulting in a similar pattern to crosses with uninfected mosquitoes (Figure 1A). In
cases of unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility with the target population (Figure 1A,E), the
accidental release of Wolbachia-infected females during releases of males for population suppression
could lead to population replacement (Dobson et al., 2002). This may be avoided by irradiating release
stocks to sterilise any released females, as demonstrated in a recent Ae. albopictus population
suppression program (Zheng et al., 2019).
Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility can also occur in crosses between two single Wolbachia
infections (Figure 1D-E) as demonstrated in Cx. pipiens (Atyame et al., 2014, Bonneau et al., 2018). In
this situation, both strains induce cytoplasmic incompatibility, but one lacks the ability to restore
compatibility with males of the other infection. Cytoplasmic incompatibility induction by males is
governed by two genes while the ability to restore compatibility by females are governed by a single
gene (Shropshire et al., 2018); the two phenotypes are therefore not always linked.

Although natural infections may interfere with releases of novel infections, their presence may also
provide opportunities for disease control. Wolbachia infections that cause cytoplasmic incompatibility
can be released in other locations for population suppression without the need for novel infections
(Laven, 1967). Natural infections may also be useful for population replacement if they can block virus
transmission (Glaser and Meola, 2010, Mousson et al., 2012).

Testing a putatively Wolbachia-infected laboratory population of Aedes aegypti
Of the eight studies reporting natural Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti, only two established
laboratory populations (Table 1). We obtained one of these populations with the intention of examining
crossing patterns between natural infections and novel infections that are being deployed into the field
(Walker et al., 2011, Ant et al., 2018). An Ae. aegypti population from Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA was
established in the laboratory in September 2018 (Kulkarni et al., 2019) and kindly provided to us by the
authors. We received eggs from the third and fourth generations of this population (denoted LC) which
were hatched and maintained in our laboratory according to methods described previously (Ross et al.,
2017a).
We performed a single cross to test whether Ae. aegypti males with the wAlbB strain (Xi et al., 2005,
Axford et al., 2016) induced cytoplasmic incompatibility with LC females. LC males do not induce
detectable cytoplasmic incompatibility with uninfected (Rockefeller strain) females (Jiannong Xu,
personal communication). Zero eggs hatched from a cross between wAlbB-infected males and LC
females (n = 1027 eggs), indicating that the infection is absent, at a low density or is not closely related
to the wAlbB infection. Due to the absence of Wolbachia in the LC strain as detected through molecular
analyses (see below), we did not proceed with further crosses.
We used molecular approaches to try and confirm Wolbachia infection in the Ae. aegypti LC strain.
According to the authors, this population harbors a natural Wolbachia infection closely related to the
wAlbB infection from Ae. albopictus (Kulkarni et al., 2019). Real-time PCR/high-resolution melt
(RT/HRM) assays were performed as previously described (Lee et al., 2012, Axford et al., 2016) using
primers specific to the wAlbB Wolbachia strain as well as Aedes and Aedes aegypti-specific primers
(Appendix 1). We also used a loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay which can detect the
wAlbB infection with high sensitivity (Jasper et al., 2019). Uninfected Ae. aegypti originating from Cairns,
Australia and wAlbB-infected Ae. aegypti (Axford et al., 2016) were included as negative and positive
controls respectively in each assay. Through these two approaches we did not detect any wAlbB
infection in 120 mosquitoes (including larvae and adults from both generations) from the LC population
(Appendix 2), demonstrating that the LC laboratory population is not infected with wAlbB.
To test whether the LC population harbors any Wolbachia infection, we performed additional assays
with general Wolbachia primers. TaqMan probe assays were performed as described previously (Mee et
al., 2015), targeting the 16S rDNA (Appendix 1). We also performed conventional PCR with 16S rDNA
and gatB primers following methods described by the authors of the original study (Kulkarni et al.,
2019). Finally, LAMP assays were performed using our protocol (Jasper et al., 2019) but with primers
used to diagnose Wolbachia infections by the original study (Kulkarni et al., 2019). From analyses of 72
individuals from both generations with the three molecular assays, zero were infected (Appendix 2).
Negative and positive controls were confirmed in all assays. Through these analyses, we demonstrate

conclusively that the LC population does not harbor Wolbachia. These results conflict with those from
the original study (Kulkarni et al., 2019) and more recent tests by the authors where Wolbachia is at a
high frequency (28/32, 87.5%) in the fourth laboratory generation (Jiannong Xu, personal
communication). Although the reason for this conflicting result is unclear, our study emphasizes the
need for independent evaluation of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti.
Field survey for natural Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti
Teo et al. (2017) detected Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti from a site in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. To further
test Wolbachia from Kuala Lumpur, we conducted our own sampling, undertaken as part of a release
program with the wAlbB Wolbachia infection (Nazni et al., 2019). We sampled 693 Ae. aegypti from a
site in 2013-2014 before Wolbachia releases commenced. We also sampled 382 Ae. aegypti from July
2017 to September 2018 from a control site where no Wolbachia releases were undertaken. Through
conventional PCR and RT/HRM assays (described above) we did not detect Wolbachia infection in any
individual (Appendix 3), in contrast to Teo et al. (2017). Our results are consistent with a global survey of
Ae. aegypti where no evidence for natural Wolbachia infections was found (Gloria-Soria et al., 2018).
Below we discuss the limitations of current studies and describe the evidence needed to confirm the
presence of putative natural Wolbachia infections.

Limitations of studies to date
Detections of Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti are accumulating (Table 1) but the evidence is largely molecular,
which is insufficient to diagnose an active Wolbachia infection (Chrostek and Gerth, 2019). Coon et al.
(2016) were the first to report the detection of Wolbachia in natural Ae. aegypti populations. In this
study, Wolbachia were found at a low abundance and frequency in Florida, USA through 16S rRNA
sequencing, and then characterized with multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Bennett et al. (2019) and
Hegde et al. (2018) also detected Wolbachia at a low frequency and abundance through 16S rRNA
sequencing but these results could not be validated with PCR amplification. These observations may
reflect true infections although there are several potential sources of contamination that can cause false
positives (discussed in Chrostek and Gerth (2019)).
Several species of filarial nematodes that infect Ae. aegypti harbor obligate Wolbachia infections from
supergroups C and D (Bouchery et al., 2013). Both Thongsripong et al. (2018) and Carvajal et al. (2019)
detected Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti that aligned to supergroup C. Carvajal et al. (2019) observed
substantial diversity in 16S rDNA and wsp sequences, with alignments to supergroups A, B, C, D and J.
Given that Wolbachia from supergroups C, D and J are not known to occur in Diptera, such diversity is
likely explained by contamination from other sources. Species misidentification may also cause false
positives if one species harbors Wolbachia and the other does not. Both Teo et al. (2017) and Carvajal et
al. (2019) used identification keys but did not confirm that samples were Ae. aegypti with molecular
approaches. Since Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are sympatric in both locations, detections of
Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti could result from species misidentification. Interspecific matings between
infected males and uninfected females might also lead to Wolbachia being detected in females given
that this has been observed at the intraspecific level (A. Callahan and J. Axford, unpublished data). For
molecular confirmation of Wolbachia infections, appropriate positive and negative controls are needed.

Carvajal et al. (2019) used water as a negative control, but this is inadequate because positive detections
may be due to amplification of mosquito nDNA. Mosquitoes or other insects of a known infection status,
both Wolbachia-infected and uninfected, are needed in each assay for confident diagnosis.
Two studies, Balaji et al. (2019) and Kulkarni et al. (2019), established laboratory colonies of Ae. aegypti
with natural Wolbachia infections, allowing for more robust evidence to be collected on infection status.
Kulkarni et al. (2019) demonstrate maternal transmission of the natural Wolbachia infection; ten
offspring selected randomly from a cross between Wolbachia-infected females and uninfected males
were infected, while none from the reciprocal cross were infected. However, our inability to detect a
Wolbachia infection in this laboratory population (as discussed above) suggests that this result may not
reflect a true infection.
Balaji et al. (2019) provide several lines of evidence for a natural Wolbachia infection in Ae. aegypti
(Table 1), although there are also limitations to this study. The infected laboratory population exhibited
a stable infection frequency of ~80% across four generations, though reciprocal crosses between
infected and uninfected populations are needed to confirm maternal transmission. Treatment of the
infected population with tetracycline for four consecutive generations removed the Wolbachia
infection, although the evidence for this provided in the supplementary information lacks controls.
Relative Wolbachia densities determined by RT/HRM are broadly consistent with natural infections in
Ae. albopictus where densities can vary across life stages and between sexes (Tortosa et al., 2010,
Calvitti et al., 2015). High Wolbachia densities in the ovaries are also consistent with a true infection,
since maternal transmission requires infection of the germ line (Veneti et al., 2004) but not somatic
tissues, although Wolbachia often occupy somatic tissues (Dobson et al., 1999). Electron microscopy
images show apparent localization of Wolbachia to the ovaries, but images are low resolution and there
is no clear distinction between Wolbachia and organelles as in other recent studies (Li et al., 2017,
Leclercq et al., 2016).

Evidence required to confirm natural Wolbachia infections
From the studies discussed above, we believe the evidence is currently insufficient to indicate that Ae.
aegypti mosquitoes harbor a natural Wolbachia infection. We propose three lines of evidence as a
minimum requirement for confirming a Wolbachia infection in this species: intracellular localization,
maternal transmission and removal of Wolbachia. Following molecular detection, laboratory
populations can be established from larvae, pupae or adults from Wolbachia-positive locations to
enable further characterization.
Intracellular localization can be demonstrated by visualizing Wolbachia within host tissues such as
through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Moreira et al., 2009). These observations require
appropriate controls including separate probes for Wolbachia and host and visualization of tissues with
the Wolbachia infection removed (see below).
Reciprocal crosses between Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquitoes can be conducted to
demonstrate maternal inheritance. In a true natural infection, only offspring from infected mothers are
expected to test positive for Wolbachia. Maternal transmission may be imperfect, particularly if the
infection has a low density in the ovaries (Narita et al., 2007), so sufficient numbers of offspring need to

be sampled. Other patterns of inheritance point against a Wolbachia infection or may indicate
horizontal transmission.
Wolbachia infections can be removed from insects through antibiotic or heat treatment (Li et al., 2014).
Novel Wolbachia infections can be cleared from Ae. aegypti with tetracycline added to larval rearing
water or sugar solution fed to adults, through rearing larvae at high temperatures, or a combination of
approaches (Ross et al., 2017b, Endersby-Harshman et al., 2019). Following removal, which may require
multiple generations of treatment, the lack of infection can be confirmed through molecular approaches
or by observing intracellular localization.
Together, these experiments should demonstrate conclusively whether the population harbors a
Wolbachia infection. Following confirmation, additional experiments would likely be worthwhile, as we
discuss below.
Future directions
The confirmation of natural Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti would open avenues for further
research, including applications for disease control programs. Laboratory crosses between natural
infections and novel infections are needed to test the potential for natural infections to interfere with
releases of novel infections. Surveys for natural infections prior to releases of novel infections may
inform release strategies, including the choice of Wolbachia strain. Effects of natural infections on host
fitness, reproduction and vector competence should be evaluated since they may possess properties
useful for reducing virus transmission and/or decreasing population size. Genome sequencing may
provide insights into their origin. Finally, natural infections could be transferred to other species through
microinjection to study their effects in novel hosts and provide further opportunities for disease control.
Although several studies have now claimed to detect Wolbachia in natural Ae. aegypti populations, the
evidence is not compelling. Studies to date have relied mostly on molecular approaches that may be
prone to contamination. These results conflict with a growing body of evidence for a lack of infection in
this species which includes a comprehensive global survey (Gloria-Soria et al., 2018), monitoring
undertaken before releases of novel infections (Hoffmann et al., 2011) and the data presented here. Our
inability to detect Wolbachia in a putatively infected laboratory population demonstrates the need for
more robust evidence when reporting natural Wolbachia infections. Although natural Wolbachia
infections in Ae. aegypti may not exist, releases of novel Wolbachia infections are continuing to expand,
and new target populations should therefore continue to be monitored prior to releases taking place.
