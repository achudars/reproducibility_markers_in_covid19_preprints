Abstract
Relatively little is known about regulated glucagon secretion by human islet α cells
compared to insulin secretion from  cells, despite conclusive evidence of dysfunction in both
cell types in diabetes mellitus. Distinct insulin sequences in humans and mice permit in vivo
studies of  cell regulation after human islet transplantation in immunocompromised mice,
whereas identical glucagon sequences prevent analogous in vivo measures of glucagon output
from human  cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to remove glucagon-encoding
codons 2-29 in immunocompromised (NSG) mice, preserving production of other proglucagonderived hormones, like Glucagon-like-peptide 1. These NSG-Glucagon knockout (NSG-GKO)
mice had phenotypes associated with glucagon signaling deficits, including hypoglycemia,
hyperaminoacidemia, hypoinsulinemia, and islet α cell hyperplasia. NSG-GKO host metabolic
and islet phenotypes reverted after human islet transplantation, and human islets retained
regulated glucagon and insulin secretion. NSG-GKO mice provide an unprecedented resource
to investigate unique, species-specific human α cell regulation in vivo.

Pancreatic islet α and β cells play an important role in maintaining euglycemia by secreting
peptide hormones in response to glucose and other blood metabolites. In healthy β cells,
hyperglycemia triggers insulin secretion, which promotes glucose uptake and glycogenesis or
adipogenesis in ‘insulin-target’ organs. In contrast, α cell glucagon secretion, stimulated by
hypoglycemia, amino acids, and autonomic nerve inputs, leads to glucose mobilization by
promoting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in ‘glucagon-target’ organs, like liver1. Impaired
regulation or output of insulin and glucagon by human β cells and  cells underlies development
and progression of diabetes mellitus. Thus, intensive efforts are focused on determining the
physiological and pathological mechanisms governing human islet α cell and β cell function.
Recent studies reveal that human and mouse islet cells have differences in cellular
composition, molecular regulation, physiological control, intra-islet cell interactions and other
crucial properties2-5, motivating increased research focus and resource generation in human
islet biology. Transplantation of human islets in immunocompromised mice, like the NOD.CgPrkdcscidIl2rgtm1WjlSz mice (NSG) strain6,7, has emerged as an important strategy for assessing
human islet β cell function in vivo8-10. Unlike distinct human and mouse insulins, the mature
glucagon sequence in these species is identical, precluding accurate quantification of circulating
human islet-derived glucagon secretion in mice and limiting studies of human α cells in
transplantation-based models. Thus, development of immunocompromised mouse strains that
permit detection of human glucagon in mice and in vivo studies of transplanted human islet 
cell function could be transformative by enabling mechanistic analysis under normal and
pathophysiological conditions.
Genetic targeting to eliminate endogenous glucagon production in mice could permit in vivo
quantification of glucagon output by transplanted human islets. The Gcg gene encodes
proglucagon, a prohormone expressed and differentially processed in islet α cells, gut
enteroendocrine cells, and the central nervous system to produce multiple distinct peptide

hormone products, including glucagon, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2)11. Differential proglucagon processing depends on coexpression of the prohormone convertase (PC) enzymes. In pancreatic islet α cells, PC2
enables cleavage of proglucagon into the mature 29 amino acid glucagon protein, which is
entirely encoded by Gcg exon 312. PC1/3 expression in enteroendocrine cells permits cleavage
of proglucagon into other products, including GLP-1, a secreted incretin hormone that enhances
postprandial insulin output by islet β cells13-17.
Glucagon production in mice has been eliminated by targeted mutation of the Gcg gene to
generate the Gcggfp allele; adult homozygous Gcggfp/gfp mice appeared normoglycemic, but
exhibited α cell hyperplasia and hypoinsulinemia18. In contrast, loss of glucagon signaling in
mice with a glucagon receptor (Gcgr) deletion, by Gcgr antibody inactivation19-22, or elimination
of PC223, 24 results in more extensive metabolic phenotypes reflecting impaired gluconeogenesis
and glycogenolysis, including elevated circulating amino acid levels and basal hypoglycemia.
Therefore, the milder metabolic phenotypes of Gcggfp/gfp mice18 likely reflect the combined loss of
mature glucagon and other products of proglucagon. Here we generated immunocompromised
mice that solely lack mature glucagon coding sequences (NSG-GKO) and demonstrate the
utility of NSG-GKO mice for analyzing human islet α cell function in vivo.

Results
Generation of NSG-GKO mice
To develop mice that permit transplantation of human islets and detection of human
glucagon, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in NSG-derived oocytes to create an in-frame
deletion of nucleotides from Gcg exon 3, which encode mature glucagon (Figures 1A and
S1A). This strategy should preserve production of metabolic regulators derived from the
proglucagon carboxy-terminus, including GLP-1. After generating candidate founder mice,

genotype screening identified one NSG founder harboring an in-frame 93 base pair (bp) deletion
of the 3' end of glucagon exon 3. This in-frame deletion includes the elimination of 84
nucleotides encoding amino acids 2-29 of mature glucagon (Figures 1A-B and S1A).
Subsequent breeding of heterozygous F1 mice produced viable, fertile homozygous NSG-GKO
mice that were born at a rate of 22.1% (compared to 32.8% wild type, and 45.1% heterozygous;
n= 122 mice). While three-week-old male and female NSG-GKO mice weighed significantly less
than NSG control littermates, no difference in body weight was detected in adult mice at eight
weeks of age (Figure S1C). This transient reduction of body mass in NSG-KO mice likely
reflects a combination of reduced circulating insulin levels in NSG-GKO mice (see below), and
possibly unrecognized roles for glucagon in development25-28. Thus, beginning at eight weeks of
age, NSG-GKO mice of both sexes were characterized for phenotypes associated with
glucagon signaling loss.
To validate elimination of mature glucagon, plasma glucagon levels were measured from ad
libitum fed and fasted NSG-GKO and NSG control mice. Unlike control NSG mice, plasma
glucagon was undetectable in NSG-GKO mice in both fed and fasted states (Figure 1C). By
contrast, plasma GLP-1 levels and excursion following an oral glucose tolerance test were
similar between NSG-GKO and NSG control littermates, despite the increased glucose
tolerance seen in NSG-GKO mice (Figures 1D and S1D). Consistent with this, antibodies that
detect mature glucagon (GCG1-29) did not label islet α cells in NSG-GKO mice, whereas these
cells were readily identified with an antibody that detects proglucagon (Figure S1B). Thus, our
CRISPR-based strategy successfully eliminated glucagon production while preserving GLP-1
output in NSG-GKO mice.

To assess the possibility of measuring circulating glucagon from human islets in NSG-GKO
mice, we transplanted human islets from previously-healthy donors under the renal capsule of
NSG-GKO mice (NSG-GKO Tx mice) (Figure 2A). Plasma glucagon was detectable in NSGGKO Tx mice two weeks after transplantation and thereafter for at least fourteen weeks, at
which point NSG-GKO Tx mice were sacrificed for tissue analysis. Four weeks after human islet
transplantation, plasma glucagon levels in fasted NSG-GKO Tx and control NSG mice were
remarkably similar, but circulating glucagon remained undetectable in sham-transplanted NSGGKO mice (Figure 2B).
To assess dynamic regulation of glucagon secretion from human  cells in NSG-GKO Tx
mice, we measured glucagon secretion in vivo after an intraperitoneal insulin challenge, which
elicits transient hypoglycemia. Reduced blood glucose levels stimulate  cell glucagon
secretion1, 29, and, as expected, acute hypoglycemia was accompanied by increased circulating
glucagon levels in NSG controls (Figures 2C and S2). By contrast, insulin challenge and
hypoglycemia elicited no glucagon output in sham-transplanted NSG-GKO mice (Figures 2C
and S2). Like in NSG controls, circulating human islet-derived glucagon levels increased upon
induction of hypoglycemia in NSG-GKO Tx mice (Figures 2C and S2). As transplanted human
islets are the sole source of circulating glucagon in NSG-GKO Tx mice, we conclude that insulin
challenge and ensuing transient hypoglycemia evoked glucagon secretion by human  cells in
these mice, an in vivo response not previously reported for human islets transplanted in mice.
These results suggest human  cell mechanisms governing regulated glucagon secretion
remained intact after transplantation.

Glucagon signaling is an essential regulator of hepatic amino acid metabolism,
gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis20, 30, 31. Consistent with prior mouse models of impaired
glucagon signaling from glucagon or glucagon receptor deficiency20-22, we observed increased
total plasma amino acid levels in NSG-GKO mice compared to NSG control littermates (Figure
3A). Moreover, measures of individual amino acids revealed specific amino acids that showed a
significant increase in NSG-GKO mice, including arginine, alanine, threonine, serine, leucine,
and glycine (Figures 3B and S3). To examine the impact of glucagon loss on gluconeogenesis
and amino acid metabolism, hepatic gene expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis
(G6pc and Pepck) and amino acid metabolism (Tat, Oat, Nnmt, and Gls2) were measured by
qPCR. Hepatic expression of G6pc, Tat, Oat, Nnmt, and Gls2 was significantly decreased in
NSG-GKO mice compared to NSG controls (Figure 3D). To assess differences in
glycogenolysis, liver glycogen levels were measured from fasted NSG-GKO and NSG control
mice. We observed a trend of increased average hepatic glycogen levels in NSG-GKO mice
compared to NSG control (Figure 3C). Together, these data suggest that, like in previous
studies of glucagon signalling loss20-22, 24, 38, gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism are
impaired in NSG-GKO mice.

To determine if human islet-derived glucagon was able to rescue phenotypes associated
with glucagon loss in NSG-GKO host tissues, we examined NSG-GKO Tx mice for reversion of
liver phenotypes. Fourteen weeks after human islet transplantation, we observed corrections of
liver defects, including reduction of total and individual plasma amino acids (Figures 3A-B and
S3), a reduction in liver glycogen levels (Figure 3C), and normalization of hepatic G6pc, Tat,
Oat, and Gls2 expression (Figure 3D). Together, these findings suggest that glucagon secretion
by human islet grafts durably reconstituted a physiological islet-liver signaling axis.

Impaired glucagon signaling in mice can evoke compensatory  cell proliferation and
hyperplasia19, 23, 24, 32. Elevated circulating amino acids in mice lacking glucagon signaling were
previously demonstrated to induce α cell proliferation and hyperplasia20-22 through a mechanism
involving the  cell amino acid transporter Slc38a5 20, 21. As NSG-GKO mice exhibited
hyperaminoacidemia, we next assessed islet  cell and  cell hyperplasia and proliferation in
NSG-GKO islets. For  cell morphometry in NSG-GKO islets, we used a proglucagon-specific
antibody that detected both wild type and internally-deleted GKO proglucagon (proglucagon),
and antibodies to detect MafB33, an adult  cell-specific islet transcription factor in mice
(Figures 4A-C). Islet morphometry in adult NSG-GKO mice revealed an increased percentage
of  cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 (Figures 4E-H) and increased  cell mass
(Figures 4A-D). No difference was observed in  cell mass or proliferation in islets from NSGGKO and NSG control mice (Figures 4A-H). In response to amino acids, mouse  cells
proliferate and induce expression of Slc38a521, 22, which is also expressed in mouse acinar
cells22, 34. NSG-GKO mice showed an increase in  cell expression of Slc38a5 compared to
islets from NSG control mice (Figures 4I-N), consistent with these prior studies. Thus, like in
prior models of glucagon deficiency, we observed adaptive  cell expansion, stimulated by
hyperaminoacidemia and accompanied by Slc38a5 expression.
As human glucagon from islet grafts restored circulating amino acid levels in NSG-GKO
mice (Figures 3A-B), we next assessed the impact on host islet α cells in NSG-GKO Tx mice
and controls. Morphometry revealed that host α cell mass ‘normalized’ in NSG-GKO Tx mice
compared to NSG control mouse islets (Figures 4C-D), and was accompanied by a reduction in
the number of proglucagon+ Ki67+ cells (Figures 4G-H), and loss of Slc38a5 production in
mouse α cells (Figures 4O-Q). Thus, restoration of glucagon signaling by human islet grafts in
NSG-GKO mice corrected adaptive pancreatic islet α cell expansion observed in NSG-GKO
mice.

Restoration of glucose and insulin regulation in transplanted NSG-GKO mice
Glucagon increases blood glucose levels by promoting hepatic glucose output and is also
implicated in regulating normal insulin secretion 35-37. Hence, mice lacking glucagon signaling are
hypoinsulinemic18 and hypoglycemic19, 23, 38. Consistent with these extant glucagon signaling
mutant mouse models, NSG-GKO mice had chronically reduced blood glucose levels and lower
ad libitum fed plasma insulin levels compared to NSG control mice (Figures 5A-B and S4B-C).
Four weeks after human islet transplantation, ad libitum fed blood glucose and total plasma
insulin levels in NSG-GKO Tx mice were increased and indistinguishable from NSG controls
(Figures 5A-B and S4B-C). In NSG-GKO Tx mice, total plasma insulin levels reflected
contributions from both host mouse  cells and transplanted human islets (Figure S4D). While
circulating glucagon levels differed in ad libitum fed NSG and NSG-GKO Tx mice, human
glucagon in NSG-GKO Tx mice was sufficient to maintain normoglycemia (Figures 2B, 5A, and
S4A-B). Upon consideration of the appropriateness of glucagon secretion under acute
hypoglycemia in NSG-GKO Tx mice (Figure 2C), these data suggest that human and mouse α
cells may have distinct glycemic thresholds, supporting conclusions from other studies39, 40.
Thus, transplanted human islets improved glycemic and insulin control in NSG-GKO Tx mice.
To examine insulin and glucose regulation further in NSG-GKO mice after human islet
transplantation, we performed an intraperitoneal glucose challenge. Compared to NSG controls,
glucose clearance by NSG-GKO mice was faster (Figure 5C) and accompanied by an
exaggerated (mouse) insulin excursion (Figure 5D). Glucose and insulin excursions in NSGGKO Tx mice more closely resembled that of NSG controls (Figures 5C-D). Dynamic total
circulating insulin levels in NSG-GKO Tx mice reflected a combination of mouse and human
insulins (Figures 5D-E). Notably, it appeared that human insulin release from transplanted islets
was well-regulated during glucose challenge, leading to acute rise then clearance from the
circulation (Figure 5E). These data suggest that human islet-derived glucagon improved

Discussion
To address the absence of models to study regulated glucagon secretion from human islet α
cells in vivo, here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to develop a glucagon-null immunocompromised
mouse strain (NSG-GKO). Human islets engrafted durably in NSG-GKO mice and retained
regulated glucagon and insulin secretion. Reconstituting glucagon signaling to target organs,
like the pancreas and liver, rescued multiple phenotypes associated with glucagon deficiency,
including deviations in circulating glucose, amino acid, and insulin levels. Prior reports of mice
that lack glucagon signaling18-23, 41, 42 revealed many phenotypes associated with loss of
glucagon signaling in pancreatic islets and other organs - phenotypes that we also observed in
NSG-GKO mice. However, NSG-GKO mice also have distinct properties not previously
reported18, 23, 42, likely reflecting preserved production of ‘nested’ proglucagon-derived peptides
like GRPP, GLP-1, and GLP-2, in addition to the superior receptivity of the NSG strain
background to xenotransplantation6, 7. While our approach led to the unavoidable loss of the
oxyntomodulin and glicentin peptide hormones (which incorporate amino acids 1-29 of GCG),
this also creates opportunities to study the in vivo functions of these hormones in NSG-GKO
mice.
Glucagon is a crucial intercellular and inter-organ regulator of pancreatic islet cells, liver, and
other organs43. Our results suggest that the NSG-GKO model should be useful for investigating
these cell-signaling interactions. This proposal is based upon the observed reversal of
hyperaminoacidemia, α cell hyperplasia, and islet Slc38a5 production in NSG-GKO mice after
human islet transplantation, indicating (re)-establishment of at least two homeostatic in vivo
signaling axes mediated by human glucagon and circulating amino acids. The first signaling axis
links transplanted human islets to the host liver, and the second links the liver to native
pancreatic islets cells. Further studies are needed to assess how other established intercellular
inputs governing islet cell function and activity, like signaling from autonomic neurons, adrenal

hormones, or afferents from the CNS44 might be reconstituted in the NSG-GKO model. Intraislet signaling between  cells,  cells, δ cells, and other islet cells is known to regulate islet
hormone secretion45, 46. Glucagon is a direct regulator of insulin secretion, while insulin inhibition
of glucagon secretion is thought to be mediated through δ cell-derived somatostatin35, 36, 47. For
example, we observed that restored circulating glucagon in NSG-GKO Tx mice curbed the
excessive insulin secretion response to hyperglycemia seen in NSG-GKO mice, providing
evidence that glucagon acts to restrain β cell post-prandial insulin secretion that may otherwise
cause hypoglycemia. Thus, to the extent that regulated reciprocal interactions between human
 cells and β cells are reconstituted and measurable in NSG-GKO mice, these mice could be
useful for in vivo studies of these and other intra-islet signaling interactions. For instance, δ cell
somatostatin is an inhibitor of glucagon secretion47-49 in rodents, and glucagon stimulates
somatostatin secretion in perfused canine pancreas50, 51. However, human α and δ cell
communication is largely uncharted. Studies of mechanisms governing cognate  cell signaling
in human islets should be feasible in the NSG-GKO model, a possibility requiring further
investigation.
The NSG-GKO mouse allows powerful new ways to study human islets. To evaluate the
function of candidate type 2 diabetes mellitus risk genes identified by GWAS and discover
human islet  cell regulators, we previously used loss-, and gain-of-function genetics in human
pseudo-islets transplanted in NSG mice4, 10. This experimental logic, using NSG-GKO mice, can
now be expanded to human α cells in islets from previously-healthy, pre-diabetic, or diabetic
donors. Importantly, we can now examine how  cell enriched genes3, 52 and genetic changes in
diabetes mellitus3, 53, 54 impact human  cell identity and function. Moreover, we envision that
NSG-GKO mice transplanted with islets from human donors (or other species) will be useful for
examining how pharmacological agents, or acquired environmental stressors, like starvation or
diet-induced obesity, impact human α cells. Using NSG mice, we recently reported that

responses of transplanted human islet  cells to high fat diet challenge were distinct from those
observed in (host) mouse  cells9. Additionally, NSG-GKO mice should be useful for assessing
the function of transplanted islet-like cells produced from renewable sources like human stem
cell lines55-59. Thus, NSG-GKO mice should be a useful resource for in vivo studies of human
islets, islet replacement cells using genetics, small molecules, or modeling of acquired in vivo
physiological or pathological risk states in diabetes mellitus.

Methods

Glucagon gene targeting in NSG mice
NSG-GKO mice were generated through the NIDDK Type 1 Diabetes Resource (TIDR)
and the Jackson Laboratory. Two mouse glucagon Exon 3 guide RNAs (sgRNA 3569:
GAAGACAAACGCCACTCACA and sgRNA 3572: CAGACTCTTACCGGTTCCTCT) and the
CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid were injected into NSG oocytes to generate founders. Out of 33
progeny, one male (termed 18-1) was confirmed by TOPO cloning and DNA sequencing to
carry the desired in-frame deletion and bred to NSG females for germ line transmission. Verified
F1 heterozygous offspring were used for further breeding to homozygosity. Subsequent
genotyping were performed using PCR amplification with 3573_F1
(TGAGGCTTTCCTAGTGCTGAG) and 3575_R1 (AACGATCAATACAGCTAAGGTCTC)
primers, which produces a 715 bp wildtype product and 622 bp from the glucagon exon 3
deletion mutant (Figure 1B). Homozygous glucagon knockout mice were born at near Mendelian
ratios. NSG-GKO mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility at Stanford University
Medical School, and were exposed to a normal 12-hour light cycle. Male and female mice (2-5
months old) were used for experiments along with age- and sex- matched control NSG mice.

Human islet procurement and transplantation
Deidentified human pancreatic islets were procured through the Integrated Islet
Distribution Program and Alberta Diabetes Institute Islet Core. Five hundred human islet
equivalents (IEQ) from previously healthy, nondiabetic organ donors (n=6) with less than 15hour cold ischemia time (Table 1) were used for transplantation under the kidney capsule of
NSG-GKO mice as previously described8,10.

Glucose tolerance testing
After a 5-hour fast, mice were administered an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of D-glucose
(3 g/kg body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a Contour glucometer (Bayer) at
0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post injection and EDTA-treated plasma samples were
collected for hormone assays. For circulating GLP-1 assessment, D-glucose (6 g/ kg body
weight) was given by oral gavage and EDTA- and DPP4-inibitor- treated plasma samples were
collected at 0, 15, and 30 minutes post-gavage.

Insulin tolerance test (ITT)
After a 5-hour fast, mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of Novolin R U100 (1U/kg body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a Contour glucometer
(Bayer) at 0, 15, and 30 minutes post insulin injection. EDTA- and protease cocktail-treated
(Bimake) plasma samples were collected at 0 and 30 minutes post-insulin injection for
circulating glucagon measurement.

Plasma hormones and amino acids assays
Plasma insulin and glucagon levels were assessed using ultrasensitive mouse insulin
ELISA (Mercodia) and glucagon ELISA (Mercodia), respectively. Circulating human insulin
levels in transplanted NSG-GKO recipients were measured with human insulin ELISA
(Mercodia). Plasma GLP-1 levels were quantified with an active GLP-1 ELISA (Eagle
Biosciences). Plasma amino acid levels were determined using the L-Amino Acid Quantitation
Kit (Sigma Aldrich) following manufacture’s instruction, and individual amino acids by the
Vanderbilt University Hormone Assay and Analytical Services Core using a Biochrom 30 amino
acid analyzer.

Immunostaining and morphometry
Pancreata were weighed (wet weight), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4oC,
and 10 μm thick cryosections were prepared. At least 10 sections per pancreas spaced at least
100 μm apart were stained with the following antibodies: Guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako, 1:500),
Rabbit anti-proglucagon (Cell Signaling Technologies, 1:400), Mouse anti-proglucagon (Novus
Biologicals, 1:300), Guinea pig anti-glucagon (Takara, 1:2000), Rabbit anti-MafB (Bethyl,
1:250), Rat anti-Ki67 (Biolegend, 1:100), Rabbit anti-SLC38A5 (Abcam 1:200). Fluorescent
micrographs were captured using a Zeiss AxioM1 microscope and a Leica SP2 confocal
microscope. For islet mass analysis, fluorescent micrographs were captured with a 10X
objective lens. For islet proliferation analysis and representative images presented in this
manuscript, fluorescent micrographs were captured with a 40x objective lens. Images were
processed in Image J for islet cell mass quantification and Image-Pro Plus for islet cell
proliferation using previously described methods 60-61.

Liver glycogen content assessment
60 mg of tissue from the liver (left lateral lobe) was collected from mice fasted for 5
hours and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver samples were homogenized on ice in buffer
containing protease cocktail inhibitor (Bimake) and quantified using a fluorometric glycogen
assay kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Cayman Chemicals).

RNA isolation, cNDA synthesis, and quantitative PCR
90 mg of tissue from the liver (left lateral lobe) was collected from mice fasted for 5
hours. Then, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and complementary DNA
was synthesized using Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific)
following manufacturers’ instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan

Supplemental Information
Figure Legends

Figure S1. Related to Figure 1. (A) Sequence from NSG-GKO founder (18-1) showing an inframe deletion of 93 base pairs within exon 3 of the glucagon gene compared to the WT-NSG
sequence (WT). Pink bar on top depicts exon 3 of glucagon. Blue bar represents nucleotide
sequences encoding mature glucagon peptide. Red-highlighted dashes indicate deleted
nucleotides in founder 18-1. (B) Representative immunostaining of NSG-GKO pancreatic islets
with antibodies raised against mature glucagon (GCG, green) and proglucagon (pro-GCG, red) peptide sequences of GLP-1 (7-17). (C) Body weight of male and female NSG-GKO and NSG
control littermates at 3 and 8-weeks of age (3-week old female mice P= 0.0007 and 3-week old
male mice P= 0.0019 by two-tailed Student’s t-test) (NSG female mice, n= 5; NSG-GKO female
mice, n= 6; NSG male mice, n= 7; NSG-GKO male mice, n= 11). (D) NSG-GKO and NSG
control blood glucose measures over 180 minutes post oral glucose gavage (15’: P= 0.0007,
30’: P= 0.0185, 60’: P= 0.0259 by two-way ANOVA, with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test)
(6g/kg body weight) (NSG mice, n= 4; NSG-GKO mice, n= 5). Data are represented as mean of
biological replicates ± SEM. * P ≤ 0.05, ** P ≤ 0.01, *** P ≤ 0.001.

Figure S2. Related to Figure 2. Percent of basal blood glucose 30-minutes post insulin
injection (1U/kg body weight) from NSG, NSG-GKO, and NSG-GKO Tx mice (P= 0.0017 by
one-way ANOVA, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (NSG mice, n= 5; NSG-GKO mice, n=
3; NSG-GKO Tx mice, n= 5). Data are represented as mean of biological replicates ± SEM.

Figure S4. Related to Figure 5. Data are from NSG control, NSG-GKO, and NSG-GKO mice
post-transplantation (NSG-GKO Tx). (A) Plasma glucagon levels in mice during ad libitum
feeding (NSG vs. NSG-GKO P≤ 0.0001, NSG-GKO vs. NSG-GKO Tx P≤ 0.0023, and NSG vs.
NSG-GKO Tx P= 0.004 by one-way ANOVA, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (NSG mice,
n= 8; NSG-GKO mice, n= 6; NSG-GKO Tx mice, n= 7). Blood glucose (B) (P= 0.003 by oneway ANOVA, with Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (NSG mice, n= 13; NSG-GKO mice, n= 9;
NSG-GKO Tx mice, n= 6) and plasma insulin levels (C) (P= 0.04 by one-way ANOVA, with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (NSG mice, n= 12; NSG-GKO mice, n= 10; NSG-GKO Tx
mice, n= 6) in fasted mice. (D) Mouse and human plasma insulin levels in ad libitum fed NSGGKO Tx mice (n=6 mice). Data are represented as mean of biological replicates ± SEM. * P ≤
