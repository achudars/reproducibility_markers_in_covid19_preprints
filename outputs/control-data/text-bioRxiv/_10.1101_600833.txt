Abstract
Thymus function depends on the epithelial compartment of the thymic stroma. Cortical thymic
epithelial cells (cTECs) regulate T cell lineage commitment and positive selection, while
medullary (m) TECs impose central tolerance on the T cell repertoire. During thymus
organogenesis, these functionally distinct sub-lineages are thought to arise from a common
thymic epithelial progenitor cell (TEPC). The mechanisms controlling cTEC and mTEC
production from the common TEPC are not however understood. Here, we show that
emergence of the earliest mTEC lineage-restricted progenitors requires active NOTCH
signaling in progenitor TEC and that, once specified, further mTEC development is NOTCHindependent. In addition, we demonstrate that persistent NOTCH activity favors maintenance
of undifferentiated TEPC at the expense of cTEC differentiation. Finally, we uncover a direct
interaction between NOTCH and FOXN1, the master regulator of TEC differentiation. These
data establish NOTCH as a potent regulator of TEPC and mTEC fate during fetal thymus
development and are thus of high relevance to strategies aimed at generating/regenerating
functional thymic tissue in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
In the thymus, thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are the essential stromal component required for T
lymphocyte development (Manley et al., 2011; Ritter and Boyd, 1993). Two functionally distinct
TEC subsets, cortical (c) TECs and medullary (m) TECs, exist and are found in the cortex and
the medulla of the organ respectively. Thymocytes migrate in a highly stereotypical fashion to
encounter cTECs and mTECs sequentially as T cell differentiation and repertoire selection
proceeds (Anderson and Takahama, 2012; Klein et al., 2014).

cTECs and mTECs originate from endodermal progenitor cells (thymic epithelial progenitor cells;
TEPCs), that are present in the thymic primordium during its initial generation from the third
pharyngeal pouches (3PPs) (Gordon et al., 2004; Le Douarin and Jotereau, 1975; Rossi et al.,
2006). Several studies have shown that, during development, both cTECs and mTECs arise
from cells expressing markers associated with mature cTECs, including CD205 and β5t (Baik et
al., 2013; Ohigashi et al., 2013), while clonal analyses have shown that a bipotent TEPC can
exist in vivo (Bleul et al., 2006; Rossi et al., 2006). Based on these observations, a serial
progression model of TEC differentiation has been proposed (Alves et al., 2014). This suggests
that fetal TEPCs, which exist as a transient population, exhibit features associated with the
cTEC lineage and that additional cues are required for mTEC specification from this common
TEPC. Identification of cTEC-restricted sub-lineage specific progenitor TECs in the fetal thymus
has proved elusive, due to the shared expression of surface antigens between this presumptive
cell type and the presumptive common TEPC (Alves et al., 2014; Baik et al., 2013; Shakib et al.,
2009), although cTEC-restricted progenitors clearly exist in the postnatal thymus (Ulyanchenko
et al., 2016). In contrast, the presence of mTEC-restricted progenitors has been detected from
day 13.5 of embryonic development (E13.5) (Rodewald et al., 2001). In the fetal thymus, these
mTEC progenitors are characterised by expression of Claudin3/4 and SSEA1 (Hamazaki et al.,
2007; Sekai et al., 2014). Receptors leading to the activation of NFκB pathway, including LTβR
and RANK, are known to regulate the proliferation and maturation of mTEC through crosstalk

with T cells and tissue inducer cells (Boehm et al., 2003; Hikosaka et al., 2008; Rossi et al.,
2007) and, recently, a hierarchy of intermediate progenitors specific for the mTEC sub-lineage
has been proposed based on genetic analysis of NFκB pathway components (Akiyama et al.,
2016; Baik et al., 2016). Additionally, HDAC3 has emerged as an essential regulator of mTEC
differentiation (Goldfarb et al., 2016), and a role for STAT3 signaling has been demonstrated in
mTEC expansion and maintenance (Lomada et al., 2016; Satoh et al., 2016). Despite these
advances, the molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of the earliest cTEC- and
mTEC-restricted cells in thymic organogenesis are not yet understood (Hamazaki et al., 2007).

NOTCH-signaling has been extensively studied in the context of thymocyte development (Shah
and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2014), and is also implicated as a regulator of TECs. Mice lacking the
Notch ligand JAGGED 2 showed reduced medullary areas (Jiang et al., 1998a; Jiang et al.,
1998b), while B cells overexpressing another Notch ligand, Delta like 1 (DLL1), induced
organized medullary areas in a reaggregate fetal thymic organ culture (RFTOC) system
(Masuda et al., 2009). In contrast, in adult thymic epithelium NOTCH activity appeared to
reside in cTECs, while its TEC-specific overexpression reduced TEC cellularity and led to an
imbalance between mature and immature mTECs, suggesting that NOTCH signaling might
inhibit mTEC lineage development (Goldfarb et al., 2016). Overall, these results suggest that
NOTCH has complex effects in TECs, but the stage(s) at and mechanism(s) through which
NOTCH influences TEC development have not yet been determined.

We have addressed the role of NOTCH signaling in early TEC differentiation using loss- and
gain-of-function analyses. Our data establish, via genetic ablation of NOTCH signaling in TECs
using Foxn1Cre;Rbpjfl/fl and Foxa2Cre;dnMAML mice, and via fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) in
the presence of NOTCH-inhibitor, that NOTCH signaling is required for specification of the
mTEC lineage. They further demonstrate that the initial sensitivity of mTEC to NOTCH is
restricted to a time-window prior to E16.5, and that NOTCH is required earlier than RANK-

mediated signaling in mTEC development. Finally, they show that NOTCH signaling is
permissive rather than instructive for mTEC specification, since TEC-specific overexpression of
Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) in fetal TEC dictated an undifferentiated TEPC phenotype
rather than uniform adoption of mTEC characteristics. Collectively, our data establish NOTCH
as a potent regulator of TEPC and mTEC fate during fetal thymus development.

Results
Early fetal mTECs exhibit high NOTCH activity
To begin to understand how NOTCH signaling affects thymus development, we first
investigated the expression of NOTCH ligands and receptors in TEC during early
organogenesis, via RT-qPCR of E10.5 3PP cells and defined E12.5 to E14.5 TEC populations
separated on the basis of EPCAM, PLET1 and UEA1 expression as appropriate (Fig.1; for
gating strategies see Supplementary Fig. 1). Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Jagged 1 (Jag1) and
Delta like 4 (Dll4), but no other NOTCH receptors and ligands, were expressed throughout this
time period (Fig. 1). Notch1 and Notch2 were significantly enriched in E14.5 UEA1+ mTECs
compared to all other populations examined. Notch3 and Jag1 were more highly expressed in
PLET1+ and UEA1+ TEC than in other TEC subpopulations, with Notch3 being most highly
expressed at E10.5 (Fig. 1A). Of the NOTCH target genes examined, Hes1 and Heyl showed
similar expression patterns to Notch3 from E12.5. In contrast and as anticipated, the highly
expressed NOTCH ligand and direct FOXN1 target Dll4 was initiated at E12.5. At E13.5 and
E14.5, Dll4 was more highly expressed in PLET1- than in PLET1+ TEC and in cTECs than
mTECs, respectively, consistent with the Foxn1 expression pattern (Fig. 1A). At the protein
level, at E13.5 NOTCH1 was enriched in UEA1+ TECs (NOTCH1+ among UEA1+, 51.5% ±
8.4%) compared to UEA1- TECs (24.7% ± 10.4%) (Fig. 1B). NOTCH2 and JAG1 were also coexpressed with UEA1 at E14.5, while NOTCH3 was more broadly expressed (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, analysis of the CBF:H2B-Venus mouse line, which reports NOTCH signaling
(Nowotschin et al., 2013), indicated ongoing or recent NOTCH activity in half of E14.5

UEA1+CD205- mTECs compared to only a small minority of cells in the CD205+UEA1- ‘cTEC’
population (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data show that the earliest TECs experience high levels
of NOTCH signaling, while early mTECs remain competent to receive further NOTCH signals.

NOTCH signaling is required for mTEC development
We next addressed the role of NOTCH in TEC development, by crossing Foxn1Cre mice
(Gordon et al., 2007) to the Rbpjfl/fl conditional knock out mouse line (Han et al., 2002). This
generated mice in which RBP-Jκ was absent from all TEC and at least some cutaneous
epithelial cells, rendering these cells unable to respond to NOTCH signaling (Han et al., 2002).
The recombination efficiency of Foxn1Cre was close to 100% in E14.5 EPCAM+ TECs when
tested using a silent GFP (sGFP) reporter (Gilchrist et al., 2003) (Supplementary Fig. 2), and
genotyping indicated complete deletion of Rbpj in total TECs purified from 4-week-old Foxn1Cre;
RBPJfl/fl thymi (Supplementary Fig. 2). Having validated the Foxn1Cre; RBPJfl/fl model (called
Rbpj cKO herein), we next analyzed the effect of loss of RBPJ on the postnatal thymus. This
revealed a significant proportional and numerical decrease in mTECs in both male and female
Rbpj cKO mice at two weeks of age (Fig. 2A), with cTEC numbers unaffected (Fig. 2B). The
decrease in mTEC numbers reflected reduced numbers of MHC Class IIhi (mTEChi) and MHC
Class IIlo (mTEClo) TEC in males, and of mTEChi in females (Fig. 2B). This phenotype
normalized by eight weeks of age, after which a second loss of mTEC was observed (Fig. 2CE). No other RBP-Jκ-dependent thymic phenotypes were observed: T cell development in the
Rbpj cKO mice was not blocked at any stage, and no difference in any of the intrathymic Treg
precursor or Treg populations (CD25-FOXP3+, CD25+FOXP3-, CD25+FOXP3+)(Lio and Hsieh,
2008; Tai et al., 2013) was detected versus controls (Fig. 2F, Supplementary Fig. 2C). Thus,
the thymic phenotype in the Rbpj cKO model appeared TEC-specific and affected mTEC but
not cTEC.

Temporal requirement for NOTCH signaling in mTEC development
To determine whether the Rbpj cKO mTEC phenotype arose postnatally or during development,
we then analyzed E14.5 control and Rbpj cKO thymi using markers characteristic of developing
mTEC and cTEC. Fewer K14+ and UEA1+ presumptive mTEC were present in E14.5 cKO thymi
than in littermate controls (Fig. 3A). This indicated that the medullary phenotype was evident by
E14.5, three days after the onset of Cre expression/Rbpj deletion, establishing that NOTCH
signaling is required during emergence of mTEC lineage cells and pointing to a potential role in
TEC progenitors.

This phenotype was independently confirmed using γ-secretase inhibition (DAPT) in fetal thymic
organ culture (FTOC) (Fig. 3B). Addition of DAPT to the culture medium in FTOC cultured at
the air-liquid interface (Ueno et al., 2005) (E15.5 or older) or submerged (E14.5 and younger)
(Supplementary Figs. 3-5) resulted in down-regulation of NOTCH receptors, ligands and targets
(Supplementary Fig. 3B). Moreover, E12.5 primordia cultured for three days in the presence of
DAPT contained significantly fewer UEA1+ mTEC than controls (Fig. 3B). DAPT treatment had
no effect on cTEC numbers or overall cellularity in this model (Fig. 3B). Control explants
contained medulla-like foci that co-expressed K14 and UEA1 (Fig. 3C), similar to E15.5 thymic
primordia (Fig. 3A) (Rodewald et al., 2001), while a substantial reduction in K14 and UEA1
expressing cells was observed in the DAPT-treated explants (Fig. 3C). These effects could not
be attributed to treatment-induced apoptosis or decreased proliferation, since the proportions of
Caspase+ and Ki67+ mTEC were not significantly affected at the concentration of DAPT used
(20μM) (Supplementary Fig 4A, B). To examine the time-dependence of NOTCH signaling in
early mTEC development, we extended these analyses by culturing E14.5 and E16.5 fetal thymi
± DAPT for three days. mTEC numbers in cultured E14.5 thymic primordia were significantly
reduced in the presence of DAPT (Fig. 3D). However, in contrast, the percentage of mTECs in
E16.5 thymi after three days of culture was unaffected (Fig. 3D). Collectively, NOTCH signaling

regulates mTEC development during early thymus organogenesis in a restricted time window
up to and including E15.5 but prior to E16.5.

NOTCH acts prior to NF-κB signaling to regulate mTEC lineage progression
The NF-κB pathway ligands (Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand [RANKL],
lymphotoxin beta and CD40L) are potent regulators of mTEC development and thymic lymphoepithelial crosstalk (Boehm et al., 2003; Hikosaka et al., 2008). Of these only RANKL stimulates
both proliferation of mTEC and upregulation of the autoimmune regulator (Aire). Recent studies
have shown that the expression of RANK receptor and hence responsiveness to RANKL
stimulation increases with increasing maturation of mTEC progenitors (Akiyama et al., 2016;
Baik et al., 2016; Mouri et al., 2011). To map the requirement for NOTCH- relative to RANKsignaling, we cultured E15.5 FTOC in the presence of deoxyguanosine (dGuo) to deplete T
cells, and then in the presence of RANKL and the presence or absence of DAPT. RANKL
elicited a proportional increase in mTEC as expected, (Fig. 4A) and co-treatment with DAPT
mildly attenuated this response (Fig 4A). This suggested that NOTCH and NF-κB might
independently regulate different aspects of mTEC development or could act sequentially in the
same developmental pathway. To discriminate between these possibilities, we cultured E15.5
Rbpj cKO and littermate control thymi in dGuo-FTOC conditions with or without RANKL.
Consistent with the data shown in Figures 2 and 3, some mTEC progenitors arose in the
Foxn1CreRbpjfl/fl model. Culture of Rbpj cKO thymi in RANKL resulted in an approximately threefold proportional increase in mTEC versus unstimulated cKOs and these mTECs displayed a
more mature phenotype (MHCII+) than controls, indicating that once generated, these mTEC
progenitors respond normally to RANK. Nevertheless, in RANKL-stimulated Rbpj cKO thymi
the proportion of mTEC was substantially lower than that in RANKL-stimulated wild-type
controls (Fig 4B), placing the requirement for NOTCH signaling developmentally upstream of
that for RANK. These data, together with those in Figure 3D, demonstrate a limited window for
NOTCH regulation of mTEC progenitor emergence and establish that NOTCH signaling acts at

an earlier stage than NF-κB signaling to regulate the number of mTEC progenitors. They
further indicate that once mTEC progenitors are specified, NOTCH is dispensable for mTEC
differentiation.

NOTCH signaling is required for specification of the mTEC lineage
The above data would be consistent with NOTCH-regulation of mTEC specification, mTEC
progenitor expansion, or both. The Foxn1Cre;Rbpj cKO model results in deletion of Rbpj from
around E12.0, with subsequent loss of RBP-Jκ function depending on protein turnover and cell
division time. The emergence of mTEC progenitors has however been suggested by
phenotypic studies to occur independently of FOXN1, possibly at least as early as E10.5
(Hamazaki et al., 2007; Nowell et al., 2011), and therefore the presence of reduced numbers
rather than total loss of mTEC progenitors in this model may reflect the relatively late timing of
RBP-Jκ deletion. Furthermore, Rbpj mRNA is expressed at only very low levels in E12.5 TEC
(not shown), suggesting that NOTCH-mediated effects should occur prior to this time-point. To
discriminate between the above possibilities, we therefore determined the effect of blocking
NOTCH signaling in TEC at or prior to mTEC and cTEC lineage divergence. For this we
generated mice in which NOTCH-mediated transcription is blocked in the developing endoderm
before E9.5, by crossing the Foxa2T2AiCre line with mice carrying the inducible dominant negative
Mastermind allele Rosa26loxp-STOP-loxp-dnMAML-IRES-eGFP allele (Horn et al., 2012; Maillard et al.,
2004). This Foxa2T2AiCre;Rosa26loxp-STOP-loxp-dnMAML-IRES-eGFP model (referred to herein as dnMAML)
provides a stronger and earlier block of NOTCH activity than that in Foxn1Cre;Rbpjfl/fl (i.e. Rbpj
cKO) mice.

E14.5 dnMAML thymi appeared smaller than controls but contained thymocytes and endothelial
networks (Supplementary Fig 7; controls were aged-matched
Foxa2T2iCre;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos embryos). At E14.5, CLDN3+ TECs are mTEC-lineage

restricted and contain cells with long-term mTEC reconstituting activity (Hamazaki et al., 2007;
Sekai et al., 2014). Crucially, at E14.5 this CLDN3+ TEC population was completely/almost
completely absent from dnMAML thymi (mean 8.6-fold reduction in dnMAML thymi, with some
thymi exhibiting a complete loss) (Fig. 5A,B,D; note that the CLDN3 staining seen in Fig. 5B is
restricted to endothelial cells). Similarly, the number of K14+ mTEC was reduced dramatically
in E14.5 dnMAML thymi versus littermate controls (Fig. 5C; note that the reduction is more
pronounced than that in E14.5 Rbpj cKO thymi). A profound effect on mTEC development was
also evident in E16.5 dnMAML thymi, with some thymi containing no K14+, UEA1+ or AIRE+
mTEC and others containing one or two foci staining with one or more of these markers (Fig.
5E-G; 3.7-fold decrease in K14+ area; 6.6-fold numerical reduction in AIRE+ mTECs). These
data indicate that blockade of NOTCH-mediated transcription prior to E9.5 results in a near
complete block in mTEC progenitor production, effectively resulting in a ‘medulla-less’ thymus.

This conclusion was supported by explant culture of E10.5 3PP. Initial validation of the culture
system (Supplementary Fig. 5) showed that during five days of culture, E10.5 3PP explants
undergo morphogenesis, differentiation and self-organization consistent with continuing
development of the thymus primordium (Supplementary Fig. 6A). Culture of E10.5 3PP
explants in the presence of DAPT resulted in the specific and near complete inhibition of mTEC
production, evidenced by the absence of UEA1+ TEC (Supplementary Fig. 6B, C). In contrast,
the numbers of CD205+ cTEC/common TEPC were not affected (Supplementary Fig. 6B,C). A
few explants contained very rare, isolated UEA1+ epithelial cells, and strikingly, these rare K14+
or UEA1+ TECs were exclusively located in the apparent remnant of 3PP lumen
(Supplementary Fig. 6C, arrow), consistent with the localization of CLDN3/4+ cells at E10.5
(Hamazaki et al., 2007). Moreover, the number of UEA1+ mTECs was unaffected by the
presence of RANKL in either control or NOTCH-inhibited conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6B),
indicating that the UEA1+ epithelial cells present in the cultures represented early, immature
mTECs not yet conditioned to respond to thymic crosstalk (Akiyama et al., 2016; Baik et al.,
2016).

Collectively, these data unequivocally establish an essential role for that NOTCH-signaling in
the normal emergence of the earliest mTEC progenitors, consistent with an obligatory role in
mTEC sub-lineage specification. They data further suggest that during normal thymus
development, mTEC progenitor emergence commences prior to E12.5.

Notch activity influences TEC progenitor differentiation
Based on the above data, we wished to test whether NOTCH signaling is permissive or
instructive for the specification of mTEC progenitors from the putative common TEPC. We thus
developed a TEC-specific NOTCH gain-of-functional model by crossing Foxn1Cre with R26LoxP-stop-LoxP-NICD-IRES-eGFP (NICD hereafter) mice (Murtaugh et al., 2003), to generate
Foxn1Cre;R26-stop-NICD-IRES-eGFP mice. In this model, high but physiological levels of NICD
- and thus constitutively active NOTCH signaling - are heritably induced in all Foxn1+ cells.

To test whether constitutive NICD expression actively promoted mTEC development, we
analyzed TEC differentiation at E14.5, assaying progression of TEC differentiation using PLET1
and MHC Class II (MHCII) as markers of undifferentiated and differentiated cells respectively
(Nowell et al., 2011).

eGFP expression indicated activation of NICD in >90% of E14.5 TECs

(Supplementary Fig. 8; 90.6% ± 1.3%). As expected, a broad down-regulation of PLET1 and
up-regulation of MHC Class II (MHCII) was observed in E14.5 control thymi compared to earlier
timepoints (Fig. 6A; see Supplementary Fig.1). In contrast, E14.5 NICD thymi exhibited higher
proportions of PLET1+ and lower proportions of MHCII+ TEC than controls. This established
that exposure to continuous NOTCH signaling from E12.5 onwards resulted in delayed TEC
differentiation (Fig. 6A; see also Supplementary Fig. 1). Analysis of the small population of
unrecombined GFP- TEC within the NICD thymus indicated this effect was cell autonomous
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The proportion of UEA1+ expressing mTECs was unchanged in NICD

thymi versus controls, and the cells binding the highest levels of UEA1 were missing (Fig. 6A;
NICD, 4.84% ± 0.21%; control 4.43% ± 0.34%) establishing that high NOTCH activity does not
drive immediate universal commitment of mTEC at the expense of cTEC.

Since a rapid expansion of mTEC occurs from E14.5, we also analyzed NICD mice at E16.5.
These NICD thymi lacked the clearly demarcated medulla present in age-matched controls
(indicated by K5, K14 and UEA1). Compartmental boundaries were indistinct, with a
pronounced extension of K5 into K8hi CD205+ regions suggesting that most TEC had a
progenitor cell phenotype (Fig. 6B)(Bennett et al., 2002; Gill et al., 2002; Klug et al., 1998). The
NICD sections also contained more extensive PLET1+ areas, while containing similar
proportions of UEA1+ AIRE+ mTECs to control thymi. Similarly, flow cytometry analysis
showed that the UEA1+ and CD205+ populations were less clearly defined, with many cells
exhibiting an apparently intermediate phenotype (Fig. 6C). Notwithstanding this perturbed
distribution, at E16.5 the NICD thymi contained 5-fold more UEA1+ mTECs (35.7% ± 7.6%) than
control thymi (6.6% ±1.1%). However, the proportion of UEA1+ TECs expressing the highest
levels of UEA1 was diminished (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the CD205+ cTEC/common progenitors
displayed considerably higher PLET1 and lower MHCII levels than controls, consistent with a
continued delay/block in cTEC differentiation (Fig. 6C).

Collectively, this establishes that overexpression of Notch promotes but does not dictate mTEC
specification from the common TEPC and additionally blocks or substantially delays cTEC
lineage progression.

Impact of NOTCH signaling modulation on gene expression in fetal TECs
To further interrogate the phenotype of NOTCH loss- and gain-of-function models, we analyzed
the transcriptome of fetal TECs, aiming to identify mechanisms regulated by NOTCH signaling

within specific TEC populations. For both Rbpj cKO and control thymi, we collected E12.5
PLET1+ TEPCs and E14.5 PLET1+ and PLET1- TEC, while for NICD at E14.5 we analyzed only
PLET1+ TEC, since most NICD TEC were PLET1+ at this timepoint (Fig. 6A; for data, see
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100314). A trend suggestive of downregulation of some Notch family and NOTCH target genes was indicated in the E14.5 PLET1+
Rbpj cKO versus controls (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 9) and confirmed by
RT-qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 10), pointing to a positive feedback loop regulating NOTCHsignaling competence. Conversely, several Notch family genes were significantly upregulated
in E14.5 NICD TEC versus controls (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Fig. 9).

Independent signaling pathway enrichment analysis using all genes differentially expressed
between the E14.5 NICD and wild-type datasets also revealed the NOTCH pathway as one of
those most affected by NICD overexpression (Fig. 7A). In addition, we found significant
upregulation of the EGFR pathway, known to promote the proliferation of mTEC precursors
(Satoh et al., 2016), and of several collagen genes (annotated as “Inflammatory Response
Pathway”), suggesting that NOTCH signaling may play a role in endowing proliferative capacity
on nascent mTECs and in regulating TEPC differentiation by modifying extracellular matrix
(Baghdadi et al., 2018). Neither Foxn1 nor Plet1 expression was significantly affected by loss
of Rbpj (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). The bHLH transcription factor
Ascl1 was markedly down-regulated in Rbpj cKO TEC and was also highly enriched in mTEC in
wild-type mice, with strong up-regulation occurring co-temporally with medullary expansion at
E14.5 (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10 and 11A). This suggested that ASCL1 might act downstream
of NOTCH in mTEC lineage regulation. However, no differences in thymic size, organization or
cellularity were detected in Ascl1-/- thymi (Guillemot et al., 1993) at E17.5 (Supplementary Fig.
11B) apparently ruling out this hypothesis.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) clustered the E12.5 and E14.5 PLET1+ Rbpj cKO and wild
type, and E14.5 PLET1+ NICD, datasets into three groups, E14.5 NICD samples (Group 1);

E14.5 PLET1+ and PLET1- Rbpj cKO and controls (Group 2; see also Supplementary Fig. 12);
and E12.5 Rbpj cKO and controls (Group 3)(Fig. 7B). The broad PCA analysis (Fig. 7B)
separated the samples by developmental stage (PC1) and PLET1 level (PC2; note that PC2 is
not solely PLET1), with Group 1 positioned between Group 2 and Group 3 in PC1. Overall, the
PCA is consistent with E14.5 NICD TEC exhibiting at least a partial developmental delay (in
keeping with conclusions from Fig. 6), or sustained NICD expression in early TEC inducing a
distinct cell state that is not found/ is very rare in the early wild type fetal thymus.

Consistent with these possibilities, clustering analysis revealed differential effects of NOTCH
signaling perturbation on markers associated with differentiation into the cTEC and mTEC sublineages, general TEC maturation, or the earliest TEPC state. In particular, genes associated
with cTEC lineage identity (Ctsl, Dll4, Psmb11, Prss16, Krt8, Ly75) were up-regulated normally
from E12.5 to E14.5 in the Rbpj cKO samples but were expressed at levels similar to E12.5
wild-type in the E14.5 NICD samples (Fig. 7C), consistent with maintained NOTCH signaling
imposing a block on cTEC generation from the common TEPC/early cTEC progenitor. Foxn1
also exhibited this expression pattern (Fig. 7C), and indeed many genes in this panel are direct
FOXN1 targets (Calderon and Boehm, 2012; Nowell et al., 2011; Zuklys et al., 2016). Notably,
overexpression of FOXN1 led to down-regulation of a number of NOTCH family and NOTCH
target genes in fetal TEC (Fig. 7D and data not shown), suggesting that induction of FOXN1
may down-regulate NOTCH signaling in TEC during normal development in vivo. Consistent
with this, our reanalysis of published FOXN1 ChIP-seq data (Zuklys et al., 2016) indicated Rbpj
as a direct FOXN1 target (Fig. 7E). Moreover, Zuklys and colleagues (Zuklys et al., 2016)
identified several known NOTCH targets and modulators as FOXN1 targets (Hey1, Hes6,
Deltex4 and Fbxw7). The relative down-regulation of Foxn1 resulting from sustained NICD
expression in early fetal TEC (Fig. 7C, Supplementary Fig. 9) thus suggests the possibility of
reciprocal inhibition.

Other genes associated with both cTEC and mTEC differentiation, were unaffected or only
marginally affected by the NOTCH signaling gain- or loss-of-function mutations. In contrast,
markers associated with the mTEC sub-lineage (Krt5, Epcam) were strongly up-regulated in the
E14.5 NICD samples compared to controls, and these genes also clustered with other genes
normally strongly down-regulated from E12.5 to E14.5 (Cldn3, Cldn4, Cyr61, Plet1, Ccnd1).
Tnfrs11a, the gene encoding RANK, was also significantly up-regulated in the E14.5 NICD
versus wild type samples (Fig. 7C). Finally, a category including Pax9, KitL and Fgfr2, which
are normally highly expressed at E12.5, was markedly down-regulated in the E14.5 NICD
compared to other E14.5 samples (Fig. 7C).

Overall, we conclude that upregulation of NOTCH signaling in TEC during early thymus
development at least partially blocks cTEC differentiation and promotes but does not dictate
mTEC development, suggesting that NOTCH regulates not only mTEC specification but also
maintenance of the fetal thymus common TEPC (Fig. 8).

Discussion
We have used conditional loss- and gain-of-function approaches together with pharmacological
inhibition to investigate the role of NOTCH signaling in TEC. Our data show, based on TECspecific RBP-Jκ deletion, γ-secretase inhibition in FTOC and enforced dnMAML expression in
the developing endoderm from E9.5, that NOTCH activity is essential for mTEC development.
Specifically, they establish that NOTCH signaling is required for the emergence of the mTEC
sub-lineage from the putative bipotent TEC progenitor, strongly suggesting that NOTCH
regulates mTEC specification, and further show that during mouse fetal thymus development,
this requirement is restricted to a developmental window prior to E16.5. Additionally, they
demonstrate that NOTCH signaling, whilst essential, is permissive rather than instructive for
mTEC development and indicate a further role for NOTCH in regulating exit from the early

bipotent TEPC state into mTEC and cTEC differentiation. These findings, summarised
schematically in Fig. 8, raise several issues which are discussed below.

Timing of the NOTCH signaling-requirement
NOTCH signaling has been shown to regulate distinct events in the different developmental
stages of a tissue (Hartman et al., 2010; Radtke et al., 2004; Shih et al., 2012). A recent study
reported that NOTCH activity is enriched in cTECs and that repression of NOTCH by the
histone deacetylase HDAC3 is important for expansion/maintenance of developing mTEC
(Goldfarb et al., 2016). This study analyzed the same NOTCH overexpression line as used
herein, but at the later time-points of 10 days and 6 weeks postnatal (Goldfarb et al., 2016). The
conclusions of this and our own studies are entirely compatible, with the data presented herein
establishing a requirement for NOTCH signaling at the earliest stages of TEC lineage
divergence, and the data of Goldfarb indicating that down-regulation of NOTCH signaling is
required for later stages of mTEC differentiation (Goldfarb et al., 2016). Indeed, the
phenotypes observed in each may reflect the outcome of same perturbation in TEC
differentiation, at separate stages. However, it is also possible that NOTCH has secondary roles
in TECs subsequent to its initial role in mTEC specification, which ceases by E16.5 (Fig. 2).

Thymic crosstalk
The NFκB pathway plays a vital role in mTEC development and consequently in the
establishment of central tolerance (Akiyama et al., 2005; Burkly et al., 1995; Kajiura et al., 2004).
Recent studies using transcriptomics and functional assays have led to more clarity on how the
several NFκB ligands, through which thymic crosstalk occurs, function during mTEC maturation
(Akiyama et al., 2016; Bichele et al., 2016; Desanti et al., 2012; Mouri et al., 2011). In particular,
Akiyama and colleagues identified two separable UEA1+ mTEC progenitor stages, pro-pMECs
and pMECs based on the expression of RANK, MHCII and CD24 (Akiyama et al., 2016). The

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/600833; this version posted April 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

transition from the more primitive pro-pMECs to pMECs depends on RELB, whereas further
maturation from pMECs is TRAF6-dependent. Crucially, both pro-pMECs and pMECs respond
to induction by RANKL in T cell-depleted FTOC (Akiyama et al., 2016). We initially interpreted
our data on potential interplay between NOTCH and NFκB to suggest synergy between these
two pathways in mTEC development, since NOTCH signaling-inhibition attenuated RANKL
stimulation in E15.5 wild-type T cell-depleted FTOC (Fig. 4A). However, comparison with E15.5
Rbpj cKO FTOC indicated that NFκB activation of already-specified mTEC progenitors is
unaffected by lack of NOTCH signaling-responsiveness: although the block in mTEC
development was more severe in the Rbpj cKO FTOC the few mTEC that were present could
be stimulated by RANK, indicating the presence of pMECs and/or pro-pMECs. The attenuation
of RANKL stimulation upon DAPT treatment of E15.5 wild-type FTOC thus suggests that mTEC
specification is still on-going at E15.5. However, we also observed that mTEC clusters in Rbpj
cKO thymi tended to be smaller than those in controls, and therefore the possibility that in
addition to regulating mTEC specification NOTCH also regulates the initial expansion of mTEC
progenitors cannot be ruled out. Indeed, our data reveal EGFR signaling as a major target of
NOTCH during early TEC development.

In contrast, our data show that while E10.5 3PP explants can generate UEA1+ mTECs and
CD205+ cTEC/progenitors in culture, these UEA1+ mTEC do not respond to RANKL. It is thus
likely that the UEA1+ cells in these explants represent an even more primitive mTEC progenitor
state than the pro-pMECs. Of note is that some DAPT-treated E10.5 3PP explants produced no
UEA1+ mTECs, and thus that mTEC specification can be completely suppressed in the absence
of NOTCH signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that although NOTCH and NFκB
are both required for mTEC development, the two pathways act sequentially but independently.

Notch regulation of mTEC progenitor emergence

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/600833; this version posted April 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

The loss of mTECs in NOTCH loss-of-function models could be explained by three hypotheses:
(i) NOTCH might regulate the decision of bipotent TEPCs to become mTECs. In this model, in
the absence of NOTCH signaling, bipotent progenitors fail to commit to mTEC fate and over
time become cTECs instead. (ii) Alternatively, high levels of NOTCH signaling might dictate that
TEPCs remain bipotent, with cells that experience lower NOTCH committing to the cTEC
lineage. Unlike the ‘specification hypothesis’, in this scenario mTECs would fail to emerge in the
absence of NOTCH signaling because the bipotent TEPCs undergo premature differentiation
into cTECs, exhausting the pool that retains the potential for mTEC generation. (iii) Finally,
NOTCH might be required for the proliferation of specialized mTEC progenitors; in this case we
would expect the perturbation to affect only mTECs and not cTECs or bipotent progenitors.

We conclude from the gain-of-function data that enhanced NOTCH activity neither switches all
TECs to become mTECs, nor only affects mTECs. Instead, NOTCH activity is necessary but
not sufficient for mTEC fate in the developmental timeframe investigated. Despite the caveats
with established markers, the considerable shift towards a PLET1+MHCII- (Fig. 6A, C) K5+ K8+
(Fig. 6B) phenotype suggests a more immature, TEPC-like state as the primary phenotype
resulting from high NOTCH activity. Indeed, the transcriptome of E14.5 NICD TECs occupies a
state that is separate from both E12.5 TEPCs and age-matched controls, whilst sharing certain
features with both clusters. As development progresses from E14.5 to E16.5, many TECs do
upregulate the mTEC markers UEA1 and K14, indicating that high NOTCH activity is
compatible with acquisition of mTEC fate. Importantly, the NICD+ UEA1+ mTECs at E16.5
display comparable maturation status to controls, whereas CD205+ cTEC/common TEPCs
continue to exhibit a primitive phenotype (Fig. 6). These data suggest that once mTECs are
specified, further development is independent of NOTCH signaling.

The gain-of-function results also support our hypothesis that NOTCH operates at the TEC
progenitor level, whilst opposing the model that NOTCH activity only influences mTECs. It does

not however rule out the specification model. Although retention of an early progenitor state
seems to be the primary outcome of enforced NOTCH signaling, the proportion of mTEC in the
E16.5 gain-of-function thymi is higher than controls. Several factors may be in play in this
second phase. The duration of signaling has been shown to result in the temporal adaptation of
sensitivity in several pathways (reviewed in (Kutejova et al., 2009)). Moreover, instead of a
simple ON/OFF response, the NOTCH response may be graded, as in the case of inner ear
(Petrovic et al., 2014) and pancreas development (Shih et al., 2012). mTEC specification may
require higher levels of NOTCH, which could for instance be achieved by positive feedback
above the levels of those imposed by the enforced NICD expression in the NICD hemizygous
mice used in these experiments. Variables independent from NOTCH may also play a part. A
potential candidate is FOXN1, which drives TEPCs out of the primitive undifferentiated state
and into differentiation (Nowell et al., 2011), and indeed our data indicate interplay between
FOXN1 expression levels and NOTCH activity (as depicted in Fig. 8). In addition to the direct
interaction suggested from our analysis, FOXN1-mediated repression of NOTCH activity could
be reinforced via its direct targets DLL4 and FBXW7; the former may mediate cis-inhibition of
NOTCH receptors, while the latter has been shown to enhance the degradation of NICD
(Carrieri and Dale, 2016; del Alamo et al., 2011). We note that the thymic phenotype of the
NOTCH gain-of-function mutant reported here resembles those of the Foxn1R/- (Nowell et al.,
2011) and the Foxn1Cre;iTbx1 (Reeh et al., 2014) mutant mice, in which exit from the earliest
TEPC compartment is also severely perturbed due to the inability to express normal levels of
FOXN1.

One of the long-term goals of the field is to create fully functional thymus organoids from TECs
derived from pluripotent stem cells or by direct conversion from unrelated cell types (reviewed in
(Bredenkamp et al., 2015)). Understanding the duration of TEPC bipotency, lineage plasticity
and NOTCH activity would improve protocols and inform strategies in this regard. Our data
predict that, by manipulating the levels of NOTCH signaling TEPCs experience, it may be
possible to produce more homogenous populations of TEC subsets, including TEPC. However,

the complexities indicated from studies on NOTCH in other organs, together with the potential
for differential effects on TEC at different stages of lineage progression, suggest that further
advances in this direction will require caution and precision.

Material and methods
Mice
CBAxC57BL/6 F1 mice were used for isolation of fetal TEC. For timed matings, C57BL/6
females were housed with CBA males, and noon of the day of the vaginal plug was taken as
E0.5. Representative data shown were obtained from littermates or, when not possible,
embryos sharing the same plug date. Foxn1Cre (Gordon et al., 2007), Rbpj conditional knockout
(Han et al., 2002), Rosa26-stop-NICD (Murtaugh et al., 2003), CBF1-Venus (Nowotschin et al.,
2013), Ascl1-/- (Guillemot et al., 1993), Rosa26CreERt2/CAG-Foxn1-IRES-GFP (iFoxn1) (Bredenkamp et al.,
2014), and Foxa2T2iCre;Rosa26loxp-STOP-loxp-dnMAML-IRES-eGFP and
Foxa2T2iCre;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos (Horn et al., 2012; Maillard et al., 2004) mice were as
described. All animals were housed and bred at the CRM animal facilities except for the Ascl1-/strain, which was housed and bred at NIMR, Mill Hill, London; the Rosa26NICD strain
(Murtaugh et al., 2003), which was housed and bred at EPFL, Lausanne; and the Foxa2T2iCre,
Rosa26loxp-STOP-loxp-dnMAML-IRES-eGFP (Horn et al., 2012; Maillard et al., 2004) and
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos (R26LSL-YFP) (Srinivas et al., 2001) strains which were housed and
bred at DanStem, University of Copenhagen. Foxn1Cre (Gordon et al., 2007) were also housed
and bred at EPFL, Lausanne. All experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with
the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Thymus dissociation: Postnatal thymi were dissociated in 1.25mg/ml collagenase D (Roche),
and subsequently in 1.25mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche) diluted in RPMI medium (Life
Technologies). 0.05mg/ml DNaseI (Lorne) was added to the buffer to minimize cell adhesion.
Fetal thymi were dissociated for 20 minutes using a PBS-based buffer consisting of 1.25mg/ml
collagenase D, 1.4mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) and 0.05mg/ml DNaseI. After digestion cells

were spun down and digested in 1x trypsin for two minutes. Cell suspension was then filtered
through 70μm cell strainer (Corning) to remove clumps.
Flow Cytometry: Adult thymi and grafted RFTOC were processed for flow cytometric sorting
and analysis as previously described (Bredenkamp et al., 2014; Nowell et al., 2011). See
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed protocols. For analysis and sorting, adult
thymic tissue was depleted of T cells using anti-CD45 MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec); fetal
tissue was not T cell depleted. Cell counts were carried out using a BioRad cell counter and
slides, where required. Sorting and analysis was performed using a BD FACS Aria II and a BD
LSR Fortessa respectively at the CRM, University of Edinburgh. For Rosa26NICD TEC, sorting
was performed on a BD FACS Aria II at the University of Lausanne, Epalinges. Sorting
protocols were identical for all cell isolation experiments. All flow cytometry data were analyzed
using FlowJo Version 9.7.6 (Tree Star, Inc).
Immunohistochemistry: Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (Gordon et al.,
2004). See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details. Appropriate isotype and
negative controls were included in all experiments. For detection of immunofluorescence, slides
were examined with Leica SP2, SPE and SP8 (Leica Microsystem, GmbH) confocal
microscopes. Images presented are of single optical sections. Fiji software (Schindelin et al.,
2012) was used to quantify the surface area of positive staining and the thymic section. Volume
percentage of K14+ or UEA1+ regions in an embryo was defined as total area of positive
staining divided by total area of thymic section.
Antibodies: The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were as listed
in Table S2. See also Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Medium: TEPC medium was N2B27 (DMEM) medium, 20ng/ml BMP4, 20ng/ml FGF8,
Penicillin/streptomycin, 1μg/ml heparin.
Fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC): For reaggregates or thymi older than E15, FTOCs were
cultured on a Millipore membrane raft floating on DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and Lglutamine. Third pharyngeal pouches or thymic primordia younger than E15.5 were submerged

and allowed to settle on thin matrigel (Corning), then cultured in N2B27 supplemented with
BMP4 (Peprotech) and FGF8 (Peprotech). Where DAPT (Tocris) or deoxyguanosine (dGUO;
Sigma) were used, the equivalent amount of DMSO was added to the control medium. RANKL
(Peprotech) was used at 500ng/ml.
Quantitative real-time PCR: RT-qPCR was performed as previously described (Bredenkamp
et al., 2014), on 50-200 cells per sample. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details. Data are shown after normalization to the geometric mean of three control genes (Hprt,
Ywhaz, Hmbs). Data analysis was carried out using LightCycler 1.5 software and the ΔCt
method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). Primers used for RT-qPCR are as shown in Table S3.
RNA-seq: 100 cells were sorted directly into Smartseq2 lysis buffer (Picelli et al., 2013) at the
CRM, University of Edinburgh (Rbpj cKO and littermate control samples) or at the University of
Lausanne, Epalinges, Ch (Rosa26NICD samples). Sorted samples were immediately frozen on
dry ice and were then shipped to the WIMM, University of Oxford for library preparation. The
libraries were then prepared and sequenced at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics,
University of Oxford. Quality control (QC) of the raw reads by FastQC (Andrews, 2010)
indicated small amount of adaptor contamination and few low quality reads, therefore the raw
data were trimmed with Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) using default parameters for PE
reads and the cropping option specific for the Nextera PE adapters. Only paired reads that
passed QC were aligned with STAR against the mouse genome assembly (GRCm28 –
Ensembl 87) and the aligned reads were assigned to genes with featureCounts (Liao et al.,
2014). The resulting count tables were imported to R for further normalisation and analysis.
Batch effect correction was applied for the within group lane effects, however, some batch
effects could not be corrected. This applied to the potential for a laboratory effect between the
E14.5 NICD and all other samples, since the E14.5 NICD sample was collected at EPFL
Lausanne. However, the same thymus dissociation and cell sorting protocols, and the same
make and model of cell sorter, were used, and the subsequent sample processing was
performed at the University of Oxford using the same protocol as for all of the other samples. To

control for this, the expression levels of housekeeping genes were determined for all samples
and were not biased in any particular groups (Supplementary Fig.12B).
Differential expression analysis was performed using the LIMMA package and voom (Ritchie et
al., 2015) from Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004) and a threshold of FDR ≤ 0.05 was set to
define genes that change with significance between the different datasets. The table of all
differentially expressed genes and their fold changes was used as a pre-ranked list in GSEA
(Subramanian et al., 2005) against the ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2011) to predict
signaling pathways that are enriched between the wild type and NICD samples. Pathways were
defined as enriched if they had an FDR value ≤ 0.25 (default significance criteria for GSEA).
ChIP-seq: Publicly available data under GEO accession number: GSE75219 (Zuklys et al.,
2016) were reanalyzed as follows. QC of the raw reads by FastQC (Andrews, 2010) indicated a
few low quality reads, and these were therefore removed trimming the raw data with
Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) using default parameters for PE reads. Read mapping was
performed with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with default parameters; MACS2
(Zhang et al., 2008) was used with a lenient p-value threshold of 1x10-3 to call peaks. The IDR
pipeline (Li et al., 2011) was followed to call confident peaks among replicates (IDR<=0.05).
Data availability: RNAseq data are deposited in GEO, and are available through the following
link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE100314.
Statistics: Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 7.02 software.
Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired) was performed for pair-wise comparisons. Multiple
comparison procedures were performed with one-way ANOVA test (two tailed), as appropriate
for normally distributed data (normal distribution was tested using Chi2 goodness of fit). The
alpha level is taken as 0.05. Errors shown are standard deviations (s.d.) throughout. Sample
sizes of at least n=3 were used for all analyses except where indicated. For all analyses, n
represents the number of independent biological experiments. No statistical method was used
to predetermine sample size, the experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were
not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. There were no
limitations to repeatability of the experiments. No samples were excluded from the analysis.

and epithelial marker K8. Scale bar=50μm. (D) Quantification of the number of CLDN3+ TECs in
E14.5 control and dnMAML thymi. Note that some weakly stained CLDN3+ cells co-localized
with endothelial marker CD31 (white arrowhead in B, and see Supplementary Figure 7A), hence
for quantification only CLDN3+K8+ double positive cells were counted. (E) Representative
images of E16.5 sections stained for DAPI, UEA1, K14 and AIRE. Scale bar=50μm. (F-G)
Quantification of the number of AIRE+ mTECs (F) and area of K14+ staining (area of marker
[over positive threshold]/area of thymus defined by DAPI staining) (G) in E16.5 control and
dnMAML thymi.
Data Collection: Foxa2T2iCre;Rosa26loxp-STOP-loxp-dnMAML-IRES-eGFP and
Foxa2T2iCre;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos (control) embryos were collected at E14.5 and E16.5.
Samples analyzed were littermates. (D,F,G) Each data point represents a section. Mean values
from several images from the same embryo were used for statistics. E14.5, n=3; E16.5, n=4.
Statistics: Error bars show 95% confidence interval. p values were calculated with the twotailed unpaired t-test.

Figure 6. Outcome of enforced NOTCH signaling in TEC. (A) The E14.5 Notch NICD TECs
exhibit considerable shift to a PLET1+MHCII- immature marker expression. The proportion of
UEA1+ mTECs is marginally higher in NICD primordia. (B) E16.5 control and NICD thymi
stained with the markers shown. (Left) Uniform K5+ K8+ epithelium in NICD, (middle) expansion
of K14 staining into CD205+ regions in NICD, compared to clearly demarcated K14+ and
CD205+ zones in controls, (right) both control and NICD thymi express AIRE in UEA1+ areas.
PLET1 expression is broader in NICD than controls. Scale bar=50μm. (C) (Left) In E16.5 thymi,
the percentage of UEA1+ mTECs is higher in NICD than in controls. Moreover, more TECs in
NICD appear to express intermediate levels of both UEA1 and CD205, or negative for both
markers. (Right) The CD205+ cTEC/common TEPC population continues to exhibit a PLET1hi
MHCIIlo immature phenotype.
Data Collection: Foxn1Cre;R26LSL-NICD-EGFP and C57BL/6 control embryos were collected at
E14.5 and E16.5. Samples analyzed were of the same litter. E14.5 NICD, n=4; E14.5 control,

from two E16.5 NICD and two control embryos.

Figure 7. Transcriptome analysis of NOTCH loss and gain of function mutants. (A)
Pathway analysis of the E14.5 NICD and E14.5 controls identified three signaling pathways as
enriched (FDR <= 0.25) in the E14.5 NICD versus the E14.5 controls comparison (top). GSEA
enrichment plot for NOTCH signaling pathway (bottom left). Leading edge subset genes
contributing to the enrichment for NOTCH signaling pathway (bottom right). (B) PCA of Rbpj
cKO, wild type and NICD TEC at the ages shown (500 most variable genes). Group 1, E14.5
NICD samples; Group 2, E14.5 PLET1+ and PLET1- Rbpj cKO and controls; and Group 3,
E12.5 Rbpj cKO and controls. (C) Heatmap of lineage specific genes among all groups of
samples shown in PCA above. Colors on top and bottom of the heatmap indicate clustering of
samples per group, while side colors indicate groups of genes regulated similarly across
conditions. Groups: E12.5 wild type, brown; W12.5 Rbpj cKO, orange; E14.5 wild type PLET1+,
dark blue; E14.5 wild type PLET1-, light grey; E14.5 Rbpj cKO PLET1+, light blue; E14.5 Rbpj
cKO PLET1-, dark grey; W, wild type; L, loss of function (Rbpj cKO); G, gain of function (NICD).
(D) RT-qPCR analysis of sorted cTEC and mTEC from E17.5 wild-type and iFoxn1 thymi for the
genes shown. Error bars show mean±SD. (E) Genomic locus of Rbpj showing Foxn1 peaks
identified in (Zuklys et al., 2016).
Data Collection: (A-C) To obtain the E12.5 and E14.5 cKO and wild type samples, thymi were
microdissected from E12.5 and E14.5 embryos generated from a Foxn1Cre;RbpjFL/+ x RbpjFL/FL
cross and TECs obtained by flow cytometric cell sorting. Following genotyping, cells from three
cKO and three control samples were processed for sequencing. The E12.5 and E14.5 samples
were each obtained from two separate litters, on two separate days for each timepoint. To
obtain the E14.5 NICD samples, thymi were microdissected from five E14.5 Foxn1Cre; R26LSLNICD-EGFP

embryos of the same litter, TECs were obtained by flow cytometric cell sorting, and the
