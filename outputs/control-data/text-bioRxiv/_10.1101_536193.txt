Abstract

24

Annexins are multifunctional proteins that bind to phospholipid membranes in a

25

calcium-dependent manner. Annexins play a myriad of critical and well-characterized

26

roles in mammals, ranging from membrane repair to vesicular secretion. The role of

27

annexins in the kingdoms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi have been largely overlooked.

28

The fact that there is no known homologue of annexins in the model organism may

29

contribute to this gap in knowledge. However, annexins are found in most medically

30

important fungal pathogens, with the notable exception of Candida albicans. In this

31

study we evaluated the function of the one annexin gene in Cryptococcus neoformans,

32

a causative agent of cryptococcosis. This gene CNAG_02415, is annotated in the C.

33

neoformans genome as a target of calcineurin through its transcription factor Crz1, and

34

we propose to update its name to cryptococcal annexin, AnnexinC1. C. neoformans

35

strains deleted for AnnexinC1 revealed no difference in survival after exposure to

36

various chemical stressor relative the wild type, as well as no major alteration in

37

virulence or mating. The only alteration observed in strains deleted for AnnexinC1 was a

38

small increase in the titan cells formation in vitro. The preservation of annexins in many

39

different fungal species suggests an important function, and therefore the lack of a

40

strong phenotype for annexin-deficient C. neoformans is suggestive of either redundant

41

genes that can compensate for the absence of AnnexinC1 function or novel functions

42

not revealed by standard assays of cell function and pathogenicity.

Importance

44

Cryptococcus neoformans is the deadliest human fungal pathogen, causing almost

45

200,000 deaths each year. Treatment of this lethal infection is lengthy, and in some

46

patients therapy is not curative and patients require lifelong therapy. Fundamental

47

research in this yeast is needed so that we can understand mechanisms of infection

48

and disease and ultimately devise better therapies. In this work we investigated a fungal

49

representative of the annexin family of proteins, specifically in the context of virulence

50

and mating. We find that the cryptococcal annexin does not seem to be involved in

51

virulence or mating but affects generation of titan cells, enlarged yeast cells that are

52

detected in the lungs of mammalian hosts. Our data provides new knowledge in an

53

unexplored area of fungal biology.

Introduction

55

Annexins are a multifunctional family of proteins that bind to phospholipid

56

membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. The bridging of membranes by annexins is

57

calcium dependent and is mediated through a structural domain consisting of about 70

58

amino acids in consecutive alpha helical conformations known as the ‘annexin fold’ (1).

59

Annexins have been reported in all domains of life, except Archaebacteria (2, 3). In

60

plants, annexins are important for immunity and resistance to nutrient stress (4). In

61

mammals, annexins play a critical role in membrane signaling, encompassing plasma

62

membrane repair, gene regulation, organelle trafficking, endosomal fusion, endocytosis

63

and exocytosis. Therefore, annexins are indispensable for tissue functions such as

64

clotting, immunity, among others (1, 5-7). In mammals, annexins are found in the

65

nucleus, the cytosol, and cell surface, and are also secreted into the extracellular milieu.

66

A recent review revealed a paucity of studies about microbial annexins, but the

67

available information suggests that these proteins are critical for the virulence of certain

68

pathogens (8, 9). Giardin from Giardia (10) is an immunodominant annexin protein (11).

69

Administration of giardin to mice induced protective immunity against Giardia and is

70

under investigation for its vaccine potential (8). The Burkholderia JOSHI_001 protein

71

possesses both a colicinD toxin domain and an annexin domain (9), which reinforces

72

the notion that microbial annexins contribute to microbial virulence.

73

Very little information is available on fungal annexins. In Neurospora crassa, no

74

phenotype was found during phenotype mutation efforts (12). The absence of an

75

annexin gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida spp. may have contributed to

76

the lack of information on fungal annexins, given that these organisms are the most

77

extensively studied fungi at the cellular level. However, annexin genes can be found in

78

all basidiomycota and the majority of medically important ascomycota. Thus far, annexin

79

deletion mutants were characterized in Aspergillus (13-16), a genus with 3 recognizable

80

annexins, and Thermomyces lanuginosus (17). Deletion of anxc1 in A. niger or anxc3 in

81

A. fumigatus did not result in growth or protein secretion defects (13). Deletion of anxc3

82

(previously anxc4) of A. fumigatus was associated with very subtle changes in the

83

protein secretion profile (13). In T. lanuginosus, annexinC7 is involved in conidia

84

formation and resistance to oxidative stress (17). In amoeba Diciostelyium discoideum,

85

one annexin gene is found and its deletion led to a delay in growth in low Ca2+

86

conditions (18).

87

Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of cryptococcosis, a life-

88

threatening infection that often results in high mortality and morbidity (19). The

89

cryptococcal genome contains one predicted annexin gene, CNAG_02415, annotated

90

as AnnexinXIV. A literature search for references to AnnexinXIV, fungal annexin or

91

CNAG_02415 found no reports on the function of this gene. A genetic screen showed

92

that CNAG_02415 deletion led to altered susceptibility to a range of small molecule

93

compounds (20). Further, CNAG_02415 is a target of Crz1, an effector of the

94

calcineurin pathway which is essential for virulence in C. neoformans (20-22). Chip-

95

Sequencing data identified AnnexinC1 as a target of Crz1 (23), a major calcineurin-

96

dependent transcription factor (22). This finding posits a role for AnnexinC1 as a

97

component of the Crz1-calcineurin response, involved in high-temperature growth, cell

98

wall stability and heavy metal susceptibility (22, 24). Available gene and protein

99

expression datasets in C. neoformans detected no alterations in expression of AnxC1

100

expression upon infection (25), nor was it was detected as secreted into the

101

extracellular milieu (26, 27). In a transcriptomic dataset, absence of Rim101 led to an

102

increase in expression of ANXC1 when placed for 3h in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle

103

Medium (28, 29), which suggest ANXC1 is additionally regulated by Rim101 (28), an

104

important cell morphology regulator. Based on its regulation by two important fungal

105

signaling pathways, we decided to characterize the function of this gene. We posited

106

that annexin in C. neoformans could play a role in fungal pathogenesis and its life cycle.

107

We found that annexin deletion affected titan cell production but had no contribution to

108

virulence in a mouse model. As with in the other fungi cited above, the molecular

109

function of the cryptococcal annexin remains cryptic, but we provide a first step in

110

characterizing its functions in the fungal world.

Results
Genetic information and previous data

113

Annexins share a common structural feature known as the annexin domain, a

114

fourfold repeat of alpha helixes made up of about 70 amino acids. This domain binds

115

Ca2+, which in turn mediates phospholipid binding. Despite this common structural

116

feature of the annexin fold, annexins show significant diversity between kingdoms

117

(9,29). Phylogenetic analysis shows that Annexins can be grouped in 5 clades (A

118

through E). Animal annexins manifest highly conserved motifs whereas annexins in

119

plants show motif diversity (3). In the kingdom Protista there is even greater diversity

120

among annexins and these organisms generally express more annexins genes than in

121

animal genomes (10). Bacterial annexin sequences are so diverse that the existence of

122

non-classical annexins was postulated (9). Mammals and Protista have multiple

123

different annexins in their genomes, but only one annexin has been identified in the

124

cryptococcal genome, the gene product of CNAG_02415 (13, 16). We performed

125

homology gene searches using DNA and protein sequences of mammalian (Mus

126

musculus), plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), fungal (Aspergillus spp.) and bacterial ‘non-

127

classical’ annexins (9) against the cryptococcal genome to identify other annexin-like

128

genes, but found no other homologue. Thus, we concluded that CNAG_02415 is the

129

only classical annexin in C. neoformans. We extracted the predicted protein sequences

130

of annexins from the fungal kingdom and built a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Fungal

131

annexins are phylogenetically closer to Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model

132

organism than to human or plant annexins, and consequently, fungal and amoeba

133

annexins are grouped in clade C. The sequence of fungal annexins differs significantly

134

from that of their mammalian and plant counterparts (16), with the 3rd and 4th folds of

135

fungal annexins harboring unusual sequences (30) while still retaining clear and

136

recognizable annexin folds. CNAG_02415 encodes a protein with four of the

137

characteristic annexin domains, one predicted calcium binding site (Figure 1) on the C-

138

terminus, and a NH2 terminal head (1). The annotation of the tau domain of DNA

139

polymerase III at the N-terminus is cryptic but may be related to nucleotide-binding

140

properties, which have been reported for annexins (31). This cryptococcal gene is

141

annotated as AnnexinXIV, likely due to homology with the first described fungal annexin

142

in Neurospora crassa (18). Based on the nomenclature conventions of annexins (32),

143

we name the gene product as annexinC1 (AnxC1) and the gene ANXC1.

144
145

Generation of a new deletion mutant

146

We constructed AnxC1-deficient strains in two independent rounds of biolistic

147

transformation using a H99 parental strain (lineage E, as indicated in Materials and

148

Methods. After individual colony screening we generated 10 isolates indistinguishable

149

by PCR and Southern blot (Supplementary Figure 1). We randomly selected 4 of these

150

clones AnxC1-deleted (anxC1∆) and their corresponding parental strain (wild-type H99)

151

for subsequent studies.

152
153

Functions of cryptococcal AnnexinC1

154

AnnexinC1 is reported to be a target of Crz1, a major component of the calcineurin

155

pathway (22). To ascertain possible defects in responses dependent on the calcineurin

156

pathway, we performed several phenotypic tests in functions strongly associated with

157

the calcineurin pathway (Figure 2). We found no alteration in growth when anxC1∆

158

strains were exposed to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, high temperature, or low

159

calcium conditions due to addition of calcium chelator (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-

160

N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The calcineurin pathway is also involved in defense

161

against cell wall stress, caused by hyperosmotic stress, calcofluor white (CFW), congo

162

red or caffeine. We found no evidence for a defect in cell wall stress for anxC1∆

163

compared to wild-type when exposed to either of these compounds. Other chemical and

164

physical stresses, such as pH, heavy metals, UV damage were also tested and no

165

alteration in susceptibility was detected (22, 33). In previous work, anxC1∆ deletion

166

strains in an H99 background showed a small increase in susceptibility to cell wall

167

stress and other chemical stressors (20, 22). We had access to some of these strains

168

as they originate from an available deletion library in C. neoformans, in an H99

169

background (34). We had also access to a bigger deletion library in a KN99 background

170

(from Hiten Madhani laboratory). To confirm the lack of cell wall stress alterations in the

171

mutants we generated and ascertained the effect of AnxC1 in a different strain of C.

172

neoformans we tested the deletion mutants from the available libraries for FK506

173

susceptibility, high temperature and the cell-wall stressor CFW. As previously reported

174

we found that the anxC1∆ in the H99 background had a small increase in susceptibility

175

to FK506 and high temperature (39˚C) (22). These defects were not observed in the

176

anxC1∆ from the KN99 background (Supplemental Figure 2). To test the contribution of

177

anxC1∆ to a wider range of calcineurin dependent conditions we measured sexual

178

mating and filamentation efficiency. We detected similar pattern and timing in mating

179

when we crossed our anxC1∆ strains (α mating type) with an isolate from a mating type.

180

Finally, we tested susceptibility to fluconazole and amphotericin B and determined an

181

MIC was 2 μg/ml and 0.5-1 μg/ml for all three experiments, respectively, and no

182

difference in MIC between wild-type and deletion strains (Figure 3).

183

Fungal annexins are poorly characterized and the literature provides no additional

184

clues to their functions. We performed a broad panel of assays to pinpoint the functions

185

of this protein in fungi (Figure 4). Annexins can be involved in oxidative stress (17).

186

However, we detected no alteration in growth when anxC1∆ strains after exposure to

187

oxidative and nitro-oxidative stress. Alternatively, annexins can be involved in

188

membrane trafficking, i.e., exocytosis and plasma membrane dynamics. We reasoned

189

that this could affect secretion of virulence factors and cellular morphology in stress

190

conditions. We found no defect in urease or melanin secretion or alteration in capsule

191

size in our experimental conditions. These results provide evidence against a defect in

192

secretion of virulence factors and therefore a role of cryptococcal annexin in secretion of

193

these virulence factors. However, we found that one of our deletion strains had an

194

increase in cell body size compared to its parental strain. Strikingly, we detected a

195

significant increase in the number of titan cells produced by anxC1Δ strains in vitro (35)

196

when compared to the parental strain H99, implicating AnxC1 as a possible negative

197

regulator of titan cell formation. We note the magnitude of this effect is small and

198

therefore its biological relevance is difficult to ascertain.

199

Given the lack of clues to cellular functions of AnxC1 we tested anxc1Δ strains for

200

alterations in virulence in several models of virulence that are routinely performed in our

201

laboratory (Figure 5). We found a similar survival rate when we exposed both deletion

202

strains and parental strains to murine macrophages. Because disease is a complex

203

interaction between host and pathogen we decided to measure animal survival when

204

challenged with anxC1∆ strains, and we used different routes of infection to cover the

205

broadest range of host-pathogen interactions. Infection of mice via intranasal (IN),

206

intravenous (IV), and intratracheal (IT) routes demonstrated indistinguishable death rate

207

and time to death between anxC1Δ strains and their parental wild-type. C. neoformans

208

when in environmental niches, soil and trees, is exposed to predation by amoeba. We

209

found that anxC1∆ strains had similar survival rates, as compared to wild-type, when

210

ingested by the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. When C. neoformans is exposed to

211

amoeba in a solid agar matrix, it can filament and form pseudohyphae structures

212

(36)(Fu, manuscript in preparation), but we observed no gross differences between the

213

wild-type and the deletion strains in filamentation morphology (data not shown). Finally,

214

in the Galleria mellonella invertebrate infection model, both deletion or wild-type strains

215

showed similar survival kinetics. Based on this data, we conclude that AnxC1 is not

216

required for virulence as measured by in these systems.

217

DISCUSSION

218

The importance of annexins to mammalian and plant biology led us to wonder about the

219

role of fungal annexins, specifically in C. neoformans. The scarcity of knowledge

220

regarding fungal annexins and our preliminary searches implicating annexin in

221

responses to two major regulators of fungal virulence, the calcineurin and the Rim101

222

pathways, encouraged us to pursue a characterization of the cryptococcal annexin.

223

Based on the most recent annexin nomenclature classifications, we propose that the

224

name annexinXIV should be replaced by AnnexinC1.

225

Our initial search through available datasets suggested that in C. neoformans,

226

annexin could be involved in the calcineurin pathway, given that it was previously

227

identified as a target of Crz1 and upregulated in high temperature (22). When testing for

228

phenotypes indicative of deficiencies in calcineurin/Crz1 pathway, AnxC1 is not an

229

effector of the known functions of calcineurin/Crz1. Another master regulator of

230

cryptococcal biology and virulence that was previously shown to affect ANXC1

231

expression levels was Rim101, which is critical for cell wall integrity (28), as well as

232

Titan cell induction. Titan cells are enlarged C. neoformans cells occurring in mouse

233

lungs during infection and that are generated in vitro under multiple conditions (35, 37,

234

38). The characteristic cell enlargement is associated with virulence and has been

235

shown to be negatively regulated by Pkr1 (35) and positively regulated by Rim101 (28).

236

The observed increase in titan cell production in ANXC1-deletion mutants posits a

237

negative regulation circuit between Rim101 and AnxC1.

238

We did not observe differences in virulence between anxC1Δ and wild type strains

239

in either mammalian or invertebrate infection models. Overall, the lack of phenotypes

12

240

associated with AnnexinC1 was puzzling, particularly given that its transcription is

241

altered by important virulence regulators such as Crz1 and Rim101. It may be that

242

annexinC1 functions are much subtler than our assays could detect. For example, in the

243

slime mold D. discoideum, deletion of annexin delays, but does not prevent, repair of

244

the plasma membrane upon laser wounding (39). An alternative hypothesis is that an

245

additional annexin is present in C. neoformans and that both annexins play redundant

246

roles. However, sequence analysis revealed no other annexin in C. neoformans and

247

therefore if another molecular player is responsible for redundancy in annexin functions,

248

it could not be readily identified by sequence homology. Our data is similar to what has

249

been previously shown for Aspergillus spp, where no obvious phenotypes were

250

observed upon deletion of annexin genes (13, 15, 16). Likewise, in Neurospora crassa

251

an annexin deleted strain had no gross growth or filamentation defects (40).

252

In contrast, in the thermophilic fungi Thermomyces lanuginosus a deletion mutant

253

of AnxC7 displayed normal growth in standard media, but had increased resistance to

254

cell-wall stress and oxidative stress. This fungal annexin C7 is predicted to localize to

255

fungal mitochondria (17). These authors also observed that conidia formation was

256

precocious. This observation may be somehow related to the observation that in C.

257

neoformans expression of AnxC1 peaked at the time of bud formation (41),

258

approximately 50 min after separation of cells by centrifugal elutriation, insinuating that

259

cryptococcal annexin, and maybe fungal annexins, are involved in membrane dynamics

260

during cellular replication. This framework would fit within our observation that AnxC1

261

deletion leads to an increase in the formation of titan cells, which display very atypical

262

size and replication patterns, requiring considerable coordination with cellular

263

membrane dynamics. AnxC1 was not differentially regulated during Titan cell formation

264

using Trevijano-Contador et al. dataset (the only RNAseq dataset available to date for

265

Titan cell formation) generated after 7 and 18h of Titan cell induction as compared to

266

normal sized cells (37). A role in membrane dynamics would also fit within the

267

generalized function of annexins as a bridge between phospholipid structures, given the

268

dynamic membrane remodeling needed during cellular replication. Given the scarcity of

269

studies focusing on fungal annexins and shortage of (dramatic) phenotypic insights from

270

deletion mutants, the role of cryptococcal annexins remains cryptic.

271

In summary, C. neoformans possesses one single annexin gene as evident from

272

sequence homology analysis. We were not able to identify a molecular function for

273

AnxC1 because comparisons of annexin-deficient to wild-type strains revealed no

274

discernible phenotype with the notable exception of an increase in titan cell formation.

275

Although it is conceivable that a critical function lurks beneath the absence of vivid

276

phenotypes, we were unable to find a strong effect in major phenotypic features of C.

277

neoformans and its virulence in mammalian, invertebrate and protozoal models of

278

infection. In this regard, our experience is similar to that of investigators who have

279

explored the role of annexin in Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus spp. (12, 13, 15)

280

who have found only weak phenotypes upon deletion of this gene. The explanation for

281

these negative results could lie in the existence of redundant mechanisms to

282

compensate for the absence of annexin or new functions that were not considered in

283

experimental design. In this regard, it is possible that annexins in fungi function very

284

differently than annexins in the other kingdoms of life. Although negative results are

285

disappointing, we take the optimistic view that a gene that is found as a single copy in

286

C. neoformans with homologs throughout the fungal kingdom must be important

287

somewhere in the biology or life cycle of these organisms. Perhaps as new assays are

288

developed to study C. neoformans physiology and mechanisms of virulence, a role for

289

its single annexin will become apparent. Accurate three-dimensional structures of fungal

290

annexin proteins, coupled with in-depth cellular localization and transcriptional studies,

291

would allow in silico structure homology search, which could help resolve the

292

conundrum of specific biological function of cryptococcal annexins.

Phylogenetic and protein modelling analysis

296

Conserved domains were detected with NCBI Conserved Domains (42). Fasta files

297

were downloaded and aligned using MUSCLE (MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment

298

with high accuracy and high throughput, Nucleic Acids Res., 2004b, vol. 32(pg. 1792-

299

1797) with Mega7 software. This software indicated that phylogenetic analysis should

300

be constructed with Maximum likelihood tree, Neighbor joining analysis, LG+G model

301

with partial deletion. Bootstrap method was performed with 500 replications and

302

phylogeny was found to be reliable between fungi annexins was above 95% (43, 44).

303

The tree is unrooted. A model of AnnexinC1 was built using Swiss-Model workspace

304

(https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive#structure) (45, 46), using

305

Homo sapiens as a template. FungiDB (http://fungidb.org/fungidb/) was used to look for

309

The strain H99 wild-type strain was obtained from Jennifer K. Lodge laboratory

310

(available at Fungal Genetic Stock Center) and is also identified as JLCN69, originating

311

from an H99E lineage (Jennifer K. Lodge, personal communication) (48). To confirm

312

some of the phenotypes of mutants, when indicated (in Supplemental Figure 2) we

313

used mutant strains and respective wild-types (one in KN99 and the other in H99

314

background) from freely available libraries, prepared by the laboratories of Suzanne E

315

Noble and Hiten D Madhani (34). Cells were kept in 10% glycerol frozen stocks. C.

316

neoformans mutants were prepared by biolistic transformation (49), using double-joint

317

nourseothricin-split (NAT) markers (50). We joined the NAT markers with sequences

318

flanking 1000-500 bp of CNAG_02415 coding region, which were deposited into gold

319

carrier particles and shot into a lawn of C. neoformans. Single colonies were picked

320

from 100 μg/ml NAT plates. We selected several clones and further characterized them

321

via PCR to verify insertion in the correct genomic location, as well as Southern blot

322

using DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and Detection starter kit II (Roche to verify only

323

each round of biolistic transformation, for a total of 4. Mutants are always compared to

337

their parental isolate (from the same round of biolistic transformation).

Spotting assays

340

Yeasts were grown overnight at 30°C in YPD broth with shaking. Early stationary

341

phase cultures were diluted to 1x106 cells/ml and then serially diluted 10-fold. The

342

dilutions were spotted (3μl) into each plate and incubated at 30, 37, or 39˚C until visible

343

colonies developed. Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) was purchased from DB. Minimal

344

media (MM) consisted of 15 mM glucose, 10 mM MgSO4, 29.4 mM KH2PO4, 13mM

345

glycine, and 3 μM of thiamine-HCl, with final pH=5.5. All chemicals were purchased

346

from Sigma and used in the concentrations indicated in the figure legend. Assays were

347

by incorporating the indicated amount of chemicals in minimal media agar, with the

348

exception of cell wall stress tests which were incorporated into YPD agar plates.

349

Alkaline stress was induced in minimal media supplemented 150mM HEPES and

350

adjusted to indicated pH. Urease secretion was performed in Christensen’s agar and

351

melanin secretion was measured by adding 1 mM L-DOPA to minimal media agar.

352

Dikaryon mating was induced by mixing equal suspensions of alpha and a strains in V8

353

juice agar (51).

Antifungal Drug Resistance

356

The susceptibility of yeast strains to fluconazole and amphotericin B was assessed

357

by broth microdilution according to CLSI M27-A3 (52). Briefly, strains were grown at

358

35C for two days on Sabouraud dextrose agar, then used to inoculate drug plates to

359

final concentration of 1.5 x 103 CFU/ml (determined by hemocytometer, rather than

360

spectrophotometer). Plates were incubated for three days at 35C prior to reading and

361

each well imaged (Cellular Technology). Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was

362

determined visually, with fluconazole MIC being the lowest concentration at which

363

growth was at least 50% inhibited, and amphotericin B MIC being the lowest

364

concentration at which no growth was observed. Each strain was tested in duplicate in

365

three independent experiments.

367

Macrophage Growth Assays and Capsule Measurements

368

Two macrophages cell lines were used for most experiments: the macrophage-like

369

murine cell line J774.16 (53) and the microglia-like cell line BV2. The BV2 cell line was

370

a kind gift from Herbert W Virgin. J774.16 were kept in DMEM complete media

371

consisting of DMEM (CellGro), 10% NCTC-109 Gibco medium (LifeTechnologies), 10%

372

heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and 1% non-essential amino acids (CellGro).

373

Macrophages were plated at a density of 5 x 104 cells /mL the day before infection. C.

374

neoformans, opsonized with 10 μg/ml of mAb 18B7 (54) were added at a Multiplicity of

375

Infection (MOI) indicated in the figure legend in a final volume of 250 μl and infection

376

proceeded for 24h. Macrophages were lysed by resuspending all cells with 10x the

377

volume of distilled water and number of surviving yeasts was measured via a “tadpole”

378

assay (55). Briefly, the aqueous suspension of yeast cells and lysed macrophages is

379

serially 10-fold diluted in YPD broth and allowed to grown overnight at 30°C. Colonies

380

are visible in the wells and the number of surviving yeasts is calculated by multiplying

381

the number of colonies by the dilution of each well. For capsule growth C. neoformans

382

cells were incubated in macrophage media in 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24h, conditions known

383

to induce capsule growth.

384
385

Amoeba Growth Assays

386

Amoeba infections were performed as described previously (56). Acanthamoeba

387

castellanii strain 30234 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection

388

(ATCC). Cultures were maintained in PYG broth (ATCC medium 712) at 25°C. C.

389

neoformans was grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth with 120 rpm shaking at 30°C

390

overnight (16 h) prior to infection of amoeba. A. castellanii cells were washed twice with

391

Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Corning, Corning, NY), supplemented

392

with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 1x104 cells seeded in DPBS into each well of 96-well plates.

393

After 1 h adhesion, 1x104 cells of C. neoformans in the same DPBS were added to

394

wells containing amoebae or control wells containing DPBS alone, and the plates were

395

incubated at 25°C. At 0, 24, and 48 h, the amoebae were lysed by repeated shearing

396

through a 27-gauge needles. The lysates were serially diluted, plated on Sabouraud

397

agar, and incubated at room temperature for 48 h for CFU determination. For solid agar

398

matrix infection experiments (pseudohyphae formation), 200 yeast cells were spread on

399

Sabouraud agar, and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Acanthamoeba castellanii at a

400

density of 5 x 103 cell per plate were randomly spotted on the agar. The plates were

incubated at 25 °C for 2-3 weeks until filamentation was observed macroscopically.

402

Filamention sites were observed for fungal morphology under regular light microscopy.

403
404

Titan Cell Generation

405

Titan cells were generated according to the protocol generated by Hommel et al.

406

(35). Briefly cells were pre-cultured in YPD overnight at 30°C with slow shaking, washed

407

in minimal media and diluted to 1x106 cells/ml in MM. Cell suspension was placed in

408

closed 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and shaken for two days in for two days in

409

Eppendorf Thermomixer® (Hambourg, Germany) at 30°C with 800 rpm shaking. Cells

410

were imaged and cell size (based on cell wall) was determined using ICY software (35).

411

Cells with body size >10 μm were considered Titan cells. Results are expressed as

412

median cell size [interquartile range, IQR] or as median frequency % of titan cells for

413

each strain.

414
415

Galleria Virulence Assays

416

Galleria mellonella larvae were picked based on weight (0.2g ± 0.02g) and appearance

417

(creamy white in color). Larvae were starved overnight at room temperature. Yeast

418

strains were inoculated overnight on Sabouraud broth, 30°C, with shaking. The

419

following day yeasts were washed 3 times with PBS and adjusted to 1.2 x107 cells/ml.

420

Yeasts were injected on the seventh front paw of the larva with 27G tuberculin needles.

421

Infected larvae were incubated at 30°C for 15 days and observed daily for lack of

422

movement (death). Control groups of larvae were inoculated with 10 μL of sterile PBS or

424

12 larvae at a time (57-60).

425
426

Animal infections

427

C57BL/6J mice, aged 8–10 weeks, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and

428

infected intratracheally as previously described with the indicated CFU per animal in a

429

final volume of 50 μl of sterile PBS (61). Intranasal experiments were performed by

430

dropping 40 μl of yeast suspension into the mouse nares while under isoflurane

431

anesthesia (35). Intravenous injections were performed by 40 μl injection in the

432

retroorbital sinus of the animal under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were monitored daily

433

for signs of stress and deterioration of health throughout the experiment. Animals were

434

euthanized if unable to feed. All animal experiments were approved by Johns Hopkins

435

University IACUC under protocol number MO18H152.

Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method. The evolutionary history

669

was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Le_Gascuel_2008

670

model [43]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-7069.32) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the

671

heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ

672

algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then

673

selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete Gamma distribution was

674

used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter =

675

2.7919)). The tree is unrooted with numbers indicating number of substitutions per site. The

676

analysis involved 17 amino acid sequences. All positions with less than 95% site coverage

677

were eliminated. That is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous

678

bases were allowed at any position. There were a total of 250 positions in the final dataset.
