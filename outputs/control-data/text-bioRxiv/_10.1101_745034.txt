Abstract: Spatial and temporal partitioning of habitat may facilitate diversity and have important impacts

10

on ant communities. To investigate niche overlap in an ant community in a northern California oak

11

woodland, we observed ant foraging on trees in 4 seasonal surveys, each lasting 2 weeks, in a 9.5-hectare

12

plot over the course of a year. Foraging activity in all 5 observed ant species differed by season, time of

13

day, and/or the genera of trees used. Of the 3 ant species most frequently observed, Camponotus

14

semitestaceus was most active during spring and summer nights, Formica moki was most active during

15

spring and summer days, and Prenolepis imparis was most active during both day and night of fall and

16

winter. All ant species preferred native trees to exotic trees and preferred evergreen trees to deciduous

17

trees. Our results suggest that native evergreen oaks such as Quercus agrifolia, currently threatened by

18

sudden oak death (Phytophthora ramorum), may be important for supporting ant biodiversity.

Introduction

33

A central question in community ecology is how communities preserve diversity despite

34

interspecific competition (1–3). Ant communities are ideal systems for studying coexistence because they

35

are diverse, may include many similar species (which are theoretically more likely to compete strongly),

36

and greatly influence ecosystem function (4–6). Many ant species have strong associations with particular

37

host plant species (6–8), and this may reduce competition among coexisting ant species.

38

Competing ant species exhibit niche partitioning in foraging activity along many different axes,

39

including season (9–11), day and night (4,9,10,12–14), temperature range (15,16), and space (12,17).

40

With some exceptions (9,10), few studies have examined how seasonal and diel scales interact to

41

influence ant community structure.

42

Urban and fragmented ecosystems may create complex, patchwork habitats that allow some

43

groups of organisms to partition niches effectively (18). Native ant biodiversity in northern California is

44

strongly linked to urbanization; disturbed, urbanized habitats have lower native ant species richness but

45

support higher levels of invasive ant species. (19). Many species of ants rely on the honeydew produced

46

by hemipteran insects as a nutritious food source (20–22). Compared to native trees, non-native trees have

47

been shown to provide an inferior food source for ants because they harbor, on average, a lower diversity

48

and abundance of hemipterans (23).

49
50

In our study system, five common native ant species (Camponotus semitestaceus,
Formica moki, Liometopum occidentale, Prenolepis imparis, and Tapinoma sessile) coexist in a mixed

native-exotic woodland in northern California in a Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry

52

summers. All five ant species forage on trees and all apparently forage on aphid honeydew (24–26).

53

Our study site has a mixture of native and exotic tree species planted over the last 200 years;

54

previously the site was a mixture of grassland and oak savanna (27). Typical native tree species include

55

oaks: Quercus agrifolia, Q. lobata, and Q. douglasii; typical exotic species include Eucalyptus

56

spp., Olea europaea, and Schinus molle. Oaks play an important role in maintaining biodiversity in

57

California forests (28). Quercus agrifolia is vulnerable to sudden oak death (Phytophthora ramorum), a

58

pathogen of emerging concern in northern California (28). Disturbances such as sudden oak death may

59

negatively affect ant community dynamics.

60

We conducted seasonal surveys during both day and night, across a variety of tree genera, to

61

examine niche partitioning in an urbanized, northern Californian ant community. We asked the following

62

questions:

63

1: Do ant species differ in foraging activity across seasons?

64

2: Do ant species differ in foraging activity between day and night?

65

3: Do ant species differ in their use of tree genera, native versus exotic trees, and deciduous versus

66

evergreen trees for foraging?

Survey Region

70

We surveyed ant activity on and around tree trunks in a 9.53 ha region of the wooded Arboretum

71

on the Stanford University campus. The survey region consisted of mixed oak-exotic woodland without

72

significant brushy understory. Trees were identified using maps from the Stanford Maps and Records

73

office (340 Bonair Siding Rd., Stanford, CA), which included GPS coordinates and species for each tree.

74

Common ant species at the site included Camponotus semitestaceus, Formica moki, Liometopum

75

occidentale, Prenolepis imparis, and Tapinoma sessile. We did not observe any other ant species at our

76

study site in significant abundance (i.e., inhabiting >10 trees in any season). We observed Linepithema

humile during spring, summer, and fall surveys in <10 trees on the northwestern edge of the survey

78

region.

79

Four seasonal surveys, each lasting up to 2 weeks, were conducted in 2016-2017 from 29-July-

80

2016 – 8-August-2016 (Summer); 12-November-2016 – 13-November-2016 (Fall); 22-February-2017 -

81

26-February-2017 (Winter); and 12-May-2017 – 19-May-2017 (Spring). We surveyed each of

82

approximately 870 trees twice during each season, once during the day and once at night, for a total of

83

7008 individual tree observations. We did not survey on rainy days as ants were not active. We did not

84

survey in the hour before or after sunrise and sunset. We eliminated trees that died between surveys from

85

the sample set. For about 20 trees, growth around the base was too dense to allow observation, and those

86

trees were not included in our final analysis.

87

Observations were made by the authors and six research assistants. Ants were identified to species

88

in the field or after observations using specimens collected at the time of observation. During each survey,

89

we observed the bottom 2m of the tree trunk and a 1m radius around the base of the tree. We recorded all

90

ant species present on the trunk and the base, and we estimated their abundance as follows: low

91

abundance = 1-5, medium abundance = 6-30, high abundance = >30 individuals. We also recorded the

92

presence of trails of any ant species. A trail was recorded if ants appeared concentrated in a line on the

93

tree trunk (as opposed to scattered randomly around the trunk) or if ants moving in opposite directions

94

touched antennae in passing. Observations lasted approximately 30 seconds - 1 minute per tree. All data

95

are available for download (29).

96

We observed but did not map the presence of nests within the survey region. We observed about

97

10 nests of Liometopum occidentale only in Quercus agrifolia. We observed several Prenolepis imparis

98

nests on the ground, greater than 10 Camponotus semitestaceus nests on the ground and 2 Formica moki

99

nests on the ground. We did not find any Tapinoma sessile nests.

102

All statistical tests were performed in RStudio Version 1.1.383. We compared ant presence across

103

seasons, day/night, tree genera, and ant species using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. We then performed a

104

second series of Kruskal-Wallis tests with the same factors and ant abundance as the response variable,

105

using the median values of our bins of ant abundance in each category (1-5 ants ≅3, 6-29 ants ≅18, 30+

106

ants ≅100). Because the results of the presence/absence model and the abundance model were very

107

similar (Table S1), we then used only the presence/absence model for species-specific analysis.

108

Season*Day_Night interaction terms were significant for the majority of species observed, so we

109

combined Season (four levels) and Day_Night (two levels) into a single factor with eight levels (for

110

example, one level was Summer Day). We ran post hoc Dunn tests on this combined variable for each ant

111

species. We adjusted all p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

112

For each of the 5 most common ant species: Camponotus semitestaceus,

113

Formica moki, Liometopum occidentale, Prenolepis imparis, and Tapinoma sessile, we performed a

114

Kruskal-Walls tests on season, day/night, and genus individually. We used post hoc Dunn tests to

115

determine the effect of season, day/night, and tree genus preference on ant presence for each individual

116

species.

117

For each survey, we calculated the percentage of all deciduous, evergreen, native, and non-native

118

trees that were occupied by any species of ant. We asked whether all species of ants preferentially used

119

deciduous or evergreen trees, and native or exotic trees, using paired t-tests.

Results

122

Question 1: Do ant species differ in foraging activity across seasons?

123

The species present depended on season (Kruskal-Wallis, 2 =265.6, p < 2.2x10-16). Camponotus

124

semitestaceus was observed most frequently during the spring and summer. Formica moki was observed

125

most frequently during the spring and summer. Liometopum occidentale was observed most frequently

126

during the summer. Prenolepis imparis was observed most frequently in the fall, slightly less frequently

in the winter, less in the spring, and rarely in the summer. Tapinoma sessile was observed most frequently

128

during the summer (See Figure 1 for Dunn post hoc results).

129
130
131

Question 2: Do ant species differ in foraging activity between day and night?
Most species differed in activity between day and night (Kruskal-Wallis, 2 =92.0, p < 2.2x10-16,

132

Table S1), and these day-night differences varied among seasons. Camponotus semitestaceus was

133

significantly more active at night than during the day, and this activity level depended on season

134

(Kruskal-Wallis, 2=1660, p < 2.2x10-16). C. semitestaceus was most often observed during spring and

135

summer nights and observed less commonly during fall and winter nights (Figure 1A). During all seasons

136

except winter, Formica moki was more active in the day than at night, and this activity level depended on

137

season (Kruskal-Wallis, 2 =897.98, p < 2.2x10-16). F. moki was most often observed on spring and

138

summer days (Figure 1B). Activity in Liometopum occidentale depended both on time of day and season

139

(Kruskal-Wallis, 2=59.646, p < 1.776x10-10). L. occidentale was more active on summer days than any

140

time during fall, winter, and spring (Figure 1C). Prenolepis imparis was more active during the night in

141

winter and spring and more active during the day in fall (Kruskal-Wallis, 2 =1483.9, p < 2.2x 10-16,

142

Figure 1D). Activity in T. sessile depended on a time of day/season interaction (Kruskal-Wallis, 2

143

=19.0, p = 0.0083, Figure 1E). All post hoc Dunn test results are presented in Figure 1, and Kruskal-

144

Wallis results are presented in Tables S1 and S2.

152

Question 3: Do ant species differ in their use of tree genera, native versus exotic trees, and

153

deciduous versus evergreen trees for foraging?
Species differed in their use of tree genera (Kruskal-Wallis, 2=216.0, p < 2.2x10-16); this effect

154
155

was observed in all species except Tapinoma sessile (Kruskal-Wallis test; CS: 2= 66.3, p< 2.4x10-12; FM,

156

2= 54.1, p < 7.0x10-10; LO: 2= 63.1, p < 1.0x10-11; PI: 2=182.8, p < 2.2x10-16; TS: 2= 5.8, p = 0.44,

157

Figure 3).

158

Camponotus semitestaceus and Formica moki were relatively uncommon on Olea trees (Figure

159

2A, 2B), while P. imparis used Olea trees more often than any other tree genus (Figure 2D). C.

160

semitestaceus preferred Quercus and Eucalyptus trees over Olea and Schinus trees (Figure 2A). F. moki

161

used most tree genera rather evenly but avoided Olea trees (Figure 2B). Liometopum occidentale

162

preferred Cedrus trees and then Quercus (Figure 2C).

167

genera were included as “Other.” Panel F shows the proportion of each tree genus present. Quercus (in bold) is the

Ants were observed significantly more often in native than non-native trees (t(7) = 6.2, p =

Discussion
Our study suggests that niche partitioning is occurring in a mixed oak-exotic woodland ant

181

community along three different axes: season, day/night, and tree genus. While other studies have

182

investigated seasonal partitioning or day/night partitioning separately, our study demonstrates that

183

seasonal and day/night scales may interact to influence partitioning.

184
185

Figure 4. Differences in diel and seasonal ant activity among the most abundant ant species in a woodland ant

186

community suggest niche partitioning. Camponotus semitestaceus was most active during spring and summer

187

nights; Formica moki was most active during spring and summer days, and Prenolepis imparis was most active in

188

fall and winter during both day and night. Liometopum occidentale was the second most active species during

189

summer day, summer night, and winter day.

190
191

Thermal niche partitioning may account for the seasonal and diel patterns we observed.

192

Prenolepis imparis foraged all day during fall, winter, and spring, which suggests this species relies on

193

colder temperatures. Other studies have shown temperature-dependent activity in P. imparis; in other

194

locations, P. imparis forages nocturnally in warm months and diurnally in cold months (10,30). Formica

195

moki is active only during the day in warmer months, which could indicate a preference for warmer

196

temperatures. By contrast, Camponotus semitestaceus has been observed to be nocturnal regardless of

197

temperature or season (24). As in previous studies (10,31,32), we did not observe strong diel or seasonal

198

activity patterns in Liometopum occidentale and Tapinoma sessile.

199

All species we observed foraged more frequently on native trees, particularly Quercus species.

200

Some niche partitioning, however, occurred in exotic tree genera: P. imparis foraged frequently on Olea,

201

and L. occidentale foraged most frequently on Cedrus, while other species avoided these two exotic tree

202

genera. All species preferred to forage on evergreen trees independently of their preference for native

203

trees, suggesting the distribution of honeydew resources may differ between evergreen and deciduous

trees. Quercus agrifolia, a native, evergreen species, was the most common tree at the field site and may

205

play an important role in maintaining ant biodiversity.

206

Species differed in trail formation and in their spatial use of trees (Figure S1), which may

207

facilitate niche partitioning. C. semitestaceus formed diffuse trails somewhat frequently (about 30% of

208

observations) and foraged from loosely clumped nest aggregations in the ground (Figure S1). F.

209

moki rarely formed trails (Figure S1) and was usually present in low abundance (Figure S3).

210

L. occidentale frequently formed large foraging trails (~60% of observations, Figure S1), and foraged in

211

clumped trail networks of around three to five trees, which often included a nest tree.

212

Several of the ant species, including F. moki, L. occidentale, and P. imparis, have been described

213

as dominant based on bait assays (9,10,17,26,33). Though we did not offer baits, we frequently observed

214

these species foraging together, which does not support a dominance-discovery tradeoff (34). The ants we

215

observed were probably foraging on trees for aphid honeydew, a spatially stable food source for which

216

repeated discovery may not be needed. Parr & Gibb (2012, 35) suggest that ant communities that rely on

217

honeydew do not demonstrate dominance-discovery tradeoffs.

218

Further research is needed to explore the degree of dietary overlap for these species and whether

219

the limitation and distribution of honeydew resources influences ant community structure. Preferences for

220

particular tree genera may be driven by differences among tree genera in aphid species composition and

221

honeydew availability. The emerging threat of sudden oak death in Quercus may affect ant communities

222

because these species may be disproportionately important in supporting honeydew-feeding ants. Thermal

223

niche partitioning may have important consequences for coexistence after climate change.
