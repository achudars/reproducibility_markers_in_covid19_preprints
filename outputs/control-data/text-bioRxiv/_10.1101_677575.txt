Abstract

2

Background: Amplification of monomer sequences into long contiguous arrays is the main

3

feature distinguishing satellite DNA from other tandem repeats, yet it is also the main obstacle in

4

its investigation because these arrays are in principle difficult to assemble. Here we explore an

5

alternative, assembly-free approach that utilizes ultra-long Oxford Nanopore reads to infer the

6

length distribution of satellite repeat arrays, their association with other repeats and the

7

prevailing sequence periodicities.

8

Results: We have developed a computational workflow for similarity-based detection and

9

downstream analysis of satellite repeats in individual nanopore reads that led to genome-wide

10

characterization of their properties. Using the satellite DNA-rich legume plant Lathyrus sativus

11

as a model, we demonstrated this approach by analyzing eleven major satellite repeats using a

12

set of nanopore reads ranging from 30 to over 200 kb in length and representing 0.73x genome

13

coverage. We found surprising differences between the analyzed repeats because only two of

14

them were predominantly organized in long arrays typical for satellite DNA. The remaining nine

15

satellites were found to be derived from short tandem arrays located within LTR-

16

retrotransposons that occasionally expanded in length. While the corresponding LTR-

17

retrotransposons were dispersed across the genome, this array expansion occurred mainly in the

18

primary constrictions of the L. sativus chromosomes, which suggests that these genome regions

19

are favorable for satellite DNA accumulation.

20

Conclusions: The presented approach proved to be efficient in revealing differences in long-

21

range organization of satellite repeats that can be used to investigate their origin and evolution in

22

the genome.

Background

27

Satellite DNA (satDNA) is a class of highly repeated genomic sequences characterized by its

28

occurrence in long arrays of almost identical, tandemly arranged units called monomers. It is

29

ubiquitous in animal and plant genomes, where it can make up to 36% or 18 Gbp/1C of nuclear

30

DNA (Ambrožová et al., 2010). The monomer sequences are typically hundreds of nucleotides

31

long, although they can be as short as simple sequence repeats (< 10 bp) (Heckmann et al.,

32

2013) or reach over 5 kb (Gong et al., 2012). Thus, satDNA is best distinguished from other

33

tandem repeats like micro- or minisatellites by forming much longer arrays (tens of kilobases up

34

to megabases) that often constitute blocks of chromatin with specific structural and epigenetic

35

properties (Garrido-Ramos, 2017). This genomic organization and skewed base composition

36

have played a crucial role in satDNA discovery in the form of additional (satellite) bands

37

observed in density gradient centrifugation analyses of genomic DNA (Kit, 1961). Thanks to a

38

number of studies in diverse groups of organisms, the initial view of satellite DNA as genomic

39

‘junk’ has gradually shifted to an appreciation of its roles in chromosome organization,

40

replication and segregation, gene expression, disease phenotypes and reproductive isolation

41

between species (reviewed in Plohl et al., 2014; Garrido-Ramos, 2015, 2017; Hartley et al.,

42

2019). Despite this progress, there are still serious limitations in our understanding of the

43

biology of satDNA, especially with respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying its

44

evolution and turnover in the genome.

45

Although the presence of satDNA is a general feature of eukaryotic genomes, its sequence

46

composition is highly variable. Most satellite repeat families are specific to a single genus or

47

even a species (Macas et al., 2002), which makes satDNA the most dynamic component of the

48

genome. A theoretical framework for understanding satDNA evolution was laid using computer

49

simulations (reviewed in Elder and Turner 1995). For example, the computer models

50

demonstrated the emergence of tandem repeats from random non-repetitive sequences by a joint

51

action of unequal recombination and mutation (Smith, 1976), predicted satDNA accumulation in

52

genome regions with suppressed meiotic recombination (Stephan, 1986) and evaluated possible

53

impacts of natural selection (Stephan & Cho, 1994). It was also revealed that recombination-

54

based processes alone cannot account for the persistence of satDNA in the genome, which

55

implied that additional amplification mechanisms need to be involved (Walsh, 1987). These

56

models are of great value because, in addition to predicting conditions that can lead to satDNA

57

origin, they provide testable predictions regarding tandem repeat homogenization patterns, the

58

emergence of higher-order repeats (HORs) and the gradual elimination of satDNA from the

59

genome. However, their utilization and further development have been hampered by the lack of

60

genome sequencing data revealing the long-range organization and sequence variation within

61

satDNA arrays that were needed to test their predictions.

62

A parallel line of research has focused on elucidating satDNA evolution using molecular and

63

cytogenetic methods. These studies confirmed that satellite repeats can be generated by tandem

64

amplification of various genomic sequences, for example, parts of dispersed repeats within

65

potato centromeres (Gong et al., 2012) or a single-copy intronic sequence in primates (Valeri et

66

al., 2018). An additional putative mechanism of satellite repeat origin was revealed in DNA

67

replication studies, which showed that repair of static replication forks leads to the generation of

68

tandem repeat arrays (Kuzminov, 2016). SatDNA can also originate by expansion of existing

69

short tandem repeat arrays present within rDNA spacers (Macas et al., 2003) and in

70

hypervariable regions of LTR-retrotransposons (Macas et al., 2009). Moreover, there may be

71

additional links between the structure or transpositional activity of mobile elements and satDNA

72

evolution (Meštrović et al., 2015). Once amplified, satellite repeats usually undergo a fast

73

sequence homogenization within each family, resulting in high similarities of monomers within

74

and between different arrays. This process is termed concerted evolution (Elder & Turner,

75

1995) and is supposed to employ various molecular mechanisms, such as gene conversion,

76

segmental duplication and rolling-circle amplification of extrachromosomal circular DNA.

77

However, little evidence has been gathered thus far to evaluate real importance of these

78

mechanisms for satDNA evolution. Since each of these mechanisms leave specific molecular

79

footprints, this question can be tackled by searching for these patterns within satellite sequences.

80

However, obtaining such sequence data from a wide range of species has long been a limiting

81

factor in satDNA investigation.

82

The introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (Metzker, 2009) marked a

83

new era in genome research, including the characterization of repetitive DNA (Weiss-

84

Schneeweiss et al., 2015). Although the adoption of NGS resulted in a boom of genome

85

assemblies, the genomes assembled using short-read technologies like Illumina are of limited

86

use for satDNA investigation because they mostly lack satellite arrays (Peona et al., 2018). On

87

the other hand, the short-read data are successfully utilized by bioinformatic pipelines

88

specifically tailored to the identification of satellite repeats employing assembly-free algorithms

89

(Novák et al., 2010, 2017; Ruiz-Ruano et al., 2016). Although these approaches proved to be

90

efficient in satDNA identification and revealed a surprising diversity of satellite repeat families

91

in some plant and animal species (Macas et al., 2015; Ruiz-Ruano et al., 2016; Ávila Robledillo

92

et al., 2018), they, in principle, could not provide much insight into their large-scale arrangement

93

in the genome. In this respect, the real breakthrough was recently made by the so-called long-

94

read sequencing technologies that include the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore

95

platforms. Especially the latter has, due to its principle of reading the sequence directly from a

96

native DNA strand during its passage through a molecular pore, a great potential to generate

97

“ultra-long” reads reaching up to one megabase (van Dijk et al., 2018). Different strategies

98

utilizing such long reads for satDNA investigation can be envisioned. First, they can be

99

combined with other genome sequencing and mapping data to generate hybrid assemblies in

100

which satellite arrays are faithfully represented and then analyzed. This approach has already

101

been successfully used for assembling satellite-rich centromere of the human chromosome Y

102

(Jain et al., 2018) and for analyzing homogenization patterns of satellites in Drosphila

103

melanogaster (Weissensteiner et al., 2017). Alternatively, it should be possible to infer various

104

features of satellite repeats by analyzing repeat arrays or their parts present in individual

105

nanopore reads. Since only a few attempts have been made to adopt this strategy (Cechova &

106

Harris, 2018) it has yet to be fully explored, which is the subject of the present study.

107

In this work, we aimed to characterize the basic properties of satellite repeat arrays in a genome-

108

wide manner by employing bioinformatic analyses of long nanopore reads. As the model for this

109

study, we selected the grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), a legume plant with a relatively large

110

genome (6.52 Gbp/C) and a small number of chromosomes (2n =14) which are amenable to

111

cytogenetic experiments. The chromosomes have extended primary constrictions with multiple

112

domains of centromeric chromatin (meta-polycentric chromosomes) (Neumann et al., 2015,

113

2016) and well-distinguishable heterochromatin bands indicative of the presence of satellite

114

DNA. Indeed, repetitive DNA characterization from low-pass genome sequencing data revealed

115

that the L. sativus genome is exceptionally rich in tandem repeats that include 23 putative

116

satDNA families, which combined represent 10.7% of the genome (Macas et al., 2015).

117

Focusing on the fraction of the most abundant repeats, we developed a workflow for their

118

detection in nanopore reads and subsequent evaluation of the size distributions of their arrays,

119

their sequence homogenization patterns and their interspersion with other repetitive sequences.

120

This work revealed surprising differences of the array properties between the analyzed repeats,

121

which allowed their classification into two groups that differed in origin and amplification

122

patterns in the genome.

123

Data Description

124

For the present study, we chose a set of sixteen putative satellites with estimated genome

125

proportions exceeding a threshold of 0.1% and reaching up to 2.6% of the L. sativus genome

126

(Table 1). These sequences were selected as the most abundant from a broader set of 23 tandem

127

repeats that were previously identified in L. sativus using graph-based clustering of Illumina

128

reads (Macas et al., 2015). The clusters selected from this study were further analyzed using a

129

TAREAN pipeline (Novák et al., 2017), which confirmed their annotation as satellite repeats

130

and reconstructed consensus sequences of their monomers (Supplementary file 1). The

131

monomers were 32 bp to 660 bp long and varied in their AT/GC content (46.3-76.6% AT).

132

Mutual sequence similarities were detected between some of the monomers, which suggested

133

that they represented variants (sub-families) of the same repeat family (Supplementary Fig. S1).

134

These included three variants of the satellite families FabTR-51 and FabTR-53 and two variants

135

of FabTR-52 (Table 1). Except for the FabTR-52 sequences, which were found to be up to 96%

136

identical to the repeat pLsat described by (Ceccarelli et al., 2010), none of the satellites showed

137

similarities to sequences in public sequence databases. We assembled a reference database of

138

consensus sequences and additional sequence variants of all selected satellite repeats to be used

139

for similarity-based detection of these sequences in the nanopore reads. The reference sequences

140

were put into the same orientation to allow for evaluation of the orientation of the arrays in the

141

nanopore reads.

142

We conducted two sequencing runs on the Oxford Nanopore MinION device utilizing

143

independent libraries prepared from partially fragmented genomic DNA using a 1D ligation

144

sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109). The two runs resulted in similar size distributions of the reads

145

(Supplementary Fig. S2, panel A) and combined produced a total of 8.96 Gbp of raw read data.

146

Following quality filtering, the reads shorter than 30 kb were discarded because we aimed to

147

analyze only a fraction of the longest reads. The remaining 78,563 reads ranging from 30 kb to

148

348 kb in length (N50 = 67 kb) provided a total of 4.78 Gbp of sequence data, which

149

corresponded to 0.73x coverage of the L. sativus genome.

155

reads were identified by similarity searches against the reference database employing the

156

LASTZ program (Harris, 2007). Using a set of nanopore reads with known repeat compositions,

157

we first optimized the LASTZ parameters towards high sensitivity and specificity. Under these

158

conditions, the satDNA arrays within nanopore reads typically produced a series of short

159

overlapping similarity hits that were filtered and parsed with custom scripts to detect the

160

contiguous repeat regions longer than 300 bp. Then, the positions and orientations of the

161

detected repeats were recorded, while distinguishing whether they were complete or truncated

162

by the read end. In the latter case, the recorded array length was actually an underestimation of

163

the real size.

164

When the above analyses were applied to the whole set of nanopore reads, the detected array

165

lengths were pooled for each satellite repeat, and their distributions were visualized as weighted

166

histograms with a bin size of 5 kb, distinguishing complete and truncated satellite arrays (Fig.

167

2). This type of visualization accounts for the total lengths of the satellite sequences that occur in

168

the genome as arrays of the lengths specified by the bins. Alternatively, the array size

169

distributions were also plotted as histograms of their counts (Supplementary Fig. S3). As a

170

control for the satellite repeats, we also analyzed the length distribution of 45S rDNA sequences,

171

which typically form long arrays of tandemly repeated units (Copenhaver & Pikaard, 1996).

172

Indeed, the plots revealed that most of the 45S rDNA repeats were detected as long arrays

173

ranging up to >120 kb (Fig. 2). A similar pattern was expected for the satellite repeats; however,

174

it was found for only two of them, FabTR-2 and FabTR-53. Both of these repeats were almost

175

exclusively present as long arrays that extended beyond the lengths of most of the reads. To

176

verify these results, we analyzed randomly selected reads using sequence self-similarity dot-

177

plots, which confirmed that most of the arrays spanned entire reads or were truncated at only one

178

of their ends (Supplementary Fig. S4 A,E). However, all nine remaining satellites generated very

179

different array length distribution profiles that consisted of relatively large numbers of short (< 5

180

kb) arrays and comparatively fewer longer arrays (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The

181

proportions of these two size classes differed between the satellites, for example, while for

182

FabTR-58, most of the arrays (98%) were short and only a few were expanded over 5 kb,

183

FabTR-51 displayed a gradient of sizes from < 5 kb to 174 kb. To check whether these profiles

184

could have partially been due to differences in the lengths of the reads containing these satellites,

185

we also analyzed their size distributions. However, the read length distributions were similar

186

between the different repeats, and there was no bias towards shorter read lengths

187

(Supplementary Fig. S2, panel B). Thus, we concluded that nine of eleven analyzed satellites

188

occurred in the L. sativus genome predominantly as short tandem arrays, and only a fraction of

189

them expanded to form long arrays typical of satellite DNA. This conclusion was also confirmed

190

by the dot-plot analyses of the individual reads, which revealed reads carrying short or

191

intermediate-sized arrays and a few expanded ones (Supplementary Fig. S4 I-N).

192
193

Analysis of genomic sequences adjacent to the satellite arrays identified a
group of satellites that originated from LTR-retrotransposons

194

Next, we were interested in whether the investigated satellites were frequently associated in the

195

genome with each other or with other types of repetitive DNA. Using a reference database for

196

the different lineages of LTR-retrotransposons, DNA transposons, rDNA and telomeric repeats

197

compiled from L. sativus repeated sequences identified in our previous study (Macas et al.,

198

2015), we detected these repeats in the nanopore reads using LASTZ along with the analyzed

199

satellites. Their occurrences were then analyzed within 10-kb regions directly adjacent to each

200

satellite repeat array, and the frequencies at which they were associated with individual satDNA

201

families were plotted with respect to the oriented repeat arrays (Fig. 3). When performed for the

202

control 45S rDNA, this analysis revealed that they were mostly surrounded by arrays of the

203

same sequences oriented in the same direction. This pattern emerged due to short interruptions

204

of otherwise longer arrays. Similar results were found for FabTR-2 and FabTR-53 which also

205

formed long arrays in the genome. Notably, the adjacent regions could be analyzed for only 33%

206

and 35% of the FabTR-2 and FabTR-53 arrays, respectively, because these repeats mostly

207

spanned entire reads. Substantially different profiles were obtained for the remaining nine

208

satellites, revealing their frequent association with Ogre LTR-retrotransposons. No other repeats

209

were detected at similar frequencies, except for unclassified LTR retrotransposons that probably

210

represented less-conserved Ogre sequences. At a much smaller frequency (~0.1), the FabTR-54

211

repeat was found to be adjacent to the FabTR-56 satellite arrays. Based on its position and size

212

in relation to FabTR-56, the detected pattern corresponded to short FabTR-54 arrays attached to

213

FabTR-56 in a direction-specific manner. Inspection of the individual reads confirmed that short

214

arrays of these satellites occurred together in a part of the reads (Supplementary Fig. S4L). A

215

peculiar pattern was revealed for FabTR-58 that consisted of a series of peaks that suggested

216

interlacing FabTR-58 and Ogre sequences at fixed intervals (Fig. 3). This pattern was found to

217

be due to occurrence of complex arrays consisting of multiple short arrays of FabTR-58

218

arranged in the same orientation and embedded into Ogre sequences (Supplementary Fig. S4Q).

219

Upon closer inspection, this organization was found in numerous reads.

220

Ogre elements represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage of Ty3/gypsy LTR-retrotransposons

221

(Neumann et al., 2019) that were amplified to high copy numbers in some plant species

222

including L. sativus. Because they comprise 45% of the L. sativus genome (Macas et al., 2015),

223

the frequent association of Ogres with short array satellites could simply be due to their random

224

interspersion. However, we noticed from the structural analysis of the reads that these short

225

arrays were often surrounded by two direct repeats, which is a feature typical of LTR-

226

retrotransposons. This finding could mean that the arrays are actually embedded within the Ogre

227

elements and were not only frequently adjacent to them by chance. To test this hypothesis, we

228

performed an additional analysis of the array neighborhoods, but this time, we specifically

229

detected parts of the Ogre sequences coding for the retroelement protein domains GAG, protease

230

(PROT), reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H (RH), archeal RNase H (aRH) and integrase

231

(INT). If the association of Ogre sequences with the satellite arrays was random, these domains

232

would be detected at various distances and orientations with respect to the arrays. In contrast,

233

finding them in a fixed arrangement would confirm that the tandem arrays were in fact parts of

234

the Ogre elements and occurred there in specific positions. As evident from Fig. 4A, that latter

235

explanation was confirmed for all nine satellites. We found that their arrays occurred

236

downstream of the Ogre gag-pol region including the LTR-retrotransposon protein coding

237

domains in the expected order and orientation (see the element structure in Fig. 4B). In two

238

cases (FabTR-54 and 57), some protein domains were not detected, and major peaks

239

corresponded to the GAG domain which was relatively close to the tandem arrays. These

240

patterns were explained by the frequent occurrence of these tandem arrays in non-autonomous

241

elements lacking their pol regions due to large deletions. In approximately half of the satellites

242

(e.g., FabTR-51 and 52), we detected additional smaller peaks corresponding to the domains in

243

both orientations located approximately 7-10 kb from the arrays. Further investigation revealed

244

that these peaks represented Ogre elements that were inserted into the expanded arrays of

245

corresponding satellites (Supplementary Fig. S4K). Consequently, they were detected only in

246

satellites such as FabTR-51 and 52 in which the proportions of expanded arrays were relatively

247

large and not FabTR-58 in which the expanded arrays were almost absent.

248
249

Satellites with mostly expanded arrays show higher variation in their
sequence periodicities

250

The identification of large numbers of satellite arrays in the nanopore reads provided sequence

251

data for investigating the conservation of monomer lengths and the eventual occurrence of

252

additional monomer length variants and HORs. To this purpose we designed a computational

253

pipeline that extracted all satellite arrays longer than 30 kb and subjected them to a periodicity

254

analysis using the fast Fourier transform algorithm (Venables & Ripley, 2002). The analysis

255

revealed the prevailing monomer sizes and eventual additional periodicities in the tandem repeat

256

arrays as periodicity spectra containing peaks at positions corresponding to the lengths of the

257

tandemly repeated units. These periodicity spectra were averaged for all arrays of the same

258

satellite (Fig. 5) or plotted separately for the individual arrays to explore the periodicity

259

variations (Supplementary Fig. S5). As an alternative approach, we also visualized the array

260

periodicities using nucleotide autocorrelation functions (Herzel et al., 1999; Macas et al., 2006).

261

In selected cases, we verified the periodicity patterns within arrays using dot-plot analyses

262

(Supplementary Fig. S4 B-D and F-H).

263

As expected, the periodicity spectra of all satellites contained peaks corresponding to their

264

monomer lengths (Fig. 5 and Table 1). In the nine Ogre-derived satellite repeats, the monomer

265

periods were the longest detected and corresponded to the fundamental frequencies. There were

266

only a few additional peaks detected with shorter periods that corresponded to higher harmonics

267

(see Methods) or possibly reflected short subrepeats or underlying single-base periodicities. In

268

contrast, FabTR-2 and FabTR-53 repeats, which occur in the genome as the expanded arrays,

269

displayed more periodicity variations. Various HORs that probably originated from multimers of

270

the 49 bp consensus were detected in the FabTR-2 arrays. Closer examination of the individual

271

arrays revealed that the multiple peaks evident in the averaged periodicity spectrum (Fig. 5)

272

originated as combinations of several simpler HOR patterns that differed between individual

273

satellite arrays (Supplementary Fig. S5). In FabTR-53, the HORs were not detected, but a

274

number shorter periodicities were revealed, which suggests that the current monomers of 660,

275

368 and 565 bp (subfamilies A, B and C, respectively) actually originated as higher-order

276

repeats of shorter units of ~190 bp (Fig. 5). An additional analysis using autocorrelation

277

functions generally agreed with the fast Fourier transform approach and confirmed the high

278

variabilities in FabTR-2 and FabTR-53 (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Array expansion of the retrotransposon-derived satellites occurred
preferentially in the pericentromeric regions of L. sativus chromosomes

281

To complement the analysis of satellite arrays with the information about their genomic

282

distribution, we performed their detection on metaphase chromosomes using fluorescence in situ

283

hybridization (FISH) (Fig. 6). Labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved

284

parts of the monomer sequences were used as hybridization probes in all cases except for

285

FabTR-53 for which a mix of two cloned probes was used instead due to its relatively long

286

monomers (Table 1 and Supplementary file 2). Although each satellite probe generated a

287

different labeling pattern, most of them were located within the primary constrictions. The

288

exception was FabTR-53, which produced strong hybridization signals that overlapped with

289

most of the subtelomeric heterochromatin bands (Fig. 6A). The other distinct pattern was

290

revealed for FabTR-2, which produced a series of dots along the periphery of the primary

291

constrictions on all chromosomes (Fig. 6B). This pattern was identical to that obtained using an

292

antibody to centromeric histone variant CenH3 (Neumann et al., 2015, 2016), which suggests

293

that FabTR-2 is the centromeric satellite. The remaining nine probes corresponding to Ogre-

294

derived satellites mostly produced bands at various parts of primary constrictions (Fig. 6C-F and

295

Supplementary Fig. S6). For example, the bands of FabTR-54 occurred within or close to the

296

primary constrictions of all chromosomes and produced a labeling pattern which, together with

297

the chromosome morphology, allowed us distinguish all chromosome types within the L. sativus

298

karyotype (Fig. 6C). A peculiar pattern was generated by the FabTR-51 subfamily A probe,

299

which painted whole primary constrictions of one pair of chromosomes (chromosome 1, Fig.

300

6D); a similar pattern was produced by the FabTR-52 probe, but it labeled the entire primary

301

constrictions of a different pair (chromosome 7, Fig. 6E).

302

Although the FISH signals of the Ogre-derived satellites were supposed to originate from their

303

expanded and sequence-homogenized arrays, we had to consider the possibility that the probes

304

had also cross-hybridized to the short repeat arrays within the elements; therefore these FISH

305

patterns may have reflected the genome distribution of Ogre elements. Thus, we investigated the

306

Ogre distribution in the L. sativus genome using a probe designed from the major sequence

307

variant of the integarse coding domain of the elements carrying the satellite repeats (see the

308

element scheme in Fig. 4B). The probe produced signals dispersed along the whole

309

chromosomes that differed from the locations of the bands in the primary constrictions revealed

310

by the satellite repeat probes (Fig. 6G-I). Thus, these results confirmed that, while the Ogre

311

elements carrying short tandem repeat arrays were dispersed throughout the genome, these

312

arrays expanded and gave rise to long satellite arrays only within the primary constrictions.

313

Discussion

314

In this work, we demonstrated that the detection and analysis of satellite repeat arrays in the bulk

315

of individual nanopore reads is an efficient method to characterize satellite DNA properties in a

316

genome-wide manner. This is a new addition to an emerging toolbox of approaches utilizing

317

long sequence reads for investigating satellite DNA in complex eukaryotic genomes. Currently,

318

these approaches have primarily been based on generating improved assemblies of satellite-rich

319

regions and their subsequent analyses (Weissensteiner et al., 2017; Jain et al., 2018).

320

Alternatively, satellite array length variation was analyzed using the long reads aligned to the

321

reference genome (Mitsuhashi et al., 2019) or by detecting a single specific satellite locus in the

322

reads (Roeck et al., 2018). Compared to these approaches, our strategy does not distinguish

323

individual satDNA arrays in the genome. Instead, our approach applies statistics to partial

324

information gathered from individual reads to infer the general properties of the investigated

325

repeats. As such, this approach can analyze any number of different satellite repeats

326

simultaneously and without the need for a reference genome. However, the inability to

327

specifically address individual repeat loci in the genome may be considered a limitation of our

328

approach. For example, we could not precisely measure the sizes of the arrays that were longer

329

than the analyzed reads and instead provided lower bounds of their lengths. On the other hand,

330

we could reliably distinguish tandem repeats that occurred in the genome predominantly in the

331

form of short arrays from those forming only long contiguous arrays and various intermediate

332

states between these extremes. Additionally, we could analyze the internal arrangements of the

333

identified arrays and characterized the sequences that frequently surrounded the arrays in the

334

genome. This analysis was achieved with a sequencing coverage that was substantially lower

335

compared with that needed for genome assembly. Thus, this approach could be of particular use

336

when analyzing very large genomes, genomes of multiple species in parallel or simply whenever

337

sequencing resources are limited.

338

We found that only two of the eleven-most abundant satellite repeats occurred in the genome

339

exclusively as long tandem arrays typical of satellite DNA. Both occupied specific genome

340

regions, FabTR-2 was associated with centromeric chromatin, and FabTR-53 made up

341

subtelomeric heterochromatic bands on mitotic chromosomes. Both are also present in other

342

Fabeae species (Macas et al., 2015), which suggests that they are phylogenetically older

343

compared with the rest of the investigated L. sativus satellites. The other feature common to

344

these satellites was the occurrence of HORs that emerge when a satellite array becomes

345

homogenized by units longer than single monomers. The factors that trigger this shift are not

346

clear, however, it is likely that chromatin structure plays a role in this process by exposing only

347

specific, regularly-spaced parts of the array to the recombination-based homogenization. There

348

are examples of HORs associated with specific types of chromatin (Henikoff et al., 2015) or

349

chromosomal locations (Macas et al., 2006), but data from a wider range of species and diverse

350

satellite repeats are needed to provide a better insight into this phenomenon. The methodology

351

presented here may be instrumental in this task because both the fast Fourier transform and the

352

nucleotide autocorrelation function algorithms employed for the periodicity analyses proved to

353

be accurate and capable of processing large volume of sequence data provided by nanopore

354

sequencing.

355

One of the key findings of this study is that the majority of L. sativus satellites originated from

356

short tandem repeats present in the 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of Ogre retrotransposons.

357

These hypervariable regions made of tandem repeats that vary in sequences and lengths of their

358

monomers are common in elements of the Tat lineage of plant LTR-retrotransposons, including

359

Ogres (Macas et al., 2009; Neumann et al., 2019). These tandem repeats were hypothesized to

360

be generated during element replication by illegitimate recombination or abnormal strand

361

transfers between two element copies that are co-packaged in a single virus-like particle (Macas

362

et al., 2009); however, the exact mechanism is yet to be determined. The same authors also

363

documented several cases of satellite repeats that likely originated by the amplification of

364

3’UTR tandem repeats. In addition to proving this mechanism by detecting various stages of the

365

retroelement array expansions in the nanopore reads, the present work on L. sativus is the first in

366

which this phenomenon was found to be responsible for the emergence of so many different

367

satellites within a single species. Considering the widespread occurrence and high copy numbers

368

of Tat/Ogre elements in many plant taxa (Neumann et al., 2006; Macas & Neumann, 2007;

369

Kubát et al., 2014; Macas et al., 2015), it can be expected that they play a significant role in

370

satDNA evolution by providing a template for novel satellites that emerge by the expansion of

371

their short tandem repeats. Additionally, similar tandem repeats occur in other types of mobile

372

elements; thus, this phenomenon is possibly even more common. For example, tandem repeats

373

within the DNA transposon Tetris have been reported to give rise to a novel satellite repeat in

374

Drosophila virilis (Dias et al., 2014).

375

The other important observation presented here is that the long arrays of all nine Ogre-derived

376

satellites are predominantly located in the primary constrictions of metaphase chromosomes.

377

This implies that these regions are favorable for array expansion, perhaps due to specific

378

features of the associated chromatin. Indeed, it has been shown that extended primary

379

constrictions of L. sativus carry a distinct type of chromatin that differs from the chromosome

380

arms by the histone phosphorylation and methylation patterns (Neumann et al., 2016). However,

381

it is not clear how these chromatin features could promote the amplification of satellite DNA. An

382

alternative explanation could be that the expansion of the Ogre-derived tandem arrays occurs

383

randomly at different genomic loci, but the expanded arrays persist better in the constrictions

384

compared with the chromosome arms. Because excision and eventual elimination of tandem

385

repeats from chromosomes is facilitated by their homologous recombination (Navrátilová et al.,

386

2008), this explanation would be supported by the absence of meiotic recombination in the

387

centromeric regions. The regions with suppressed recombination have also been predicted as

388

favorable for satDNA accumulation by computer models (Stephan, 1986). These hypotheses can

389

be tested in the future investigations of properly selected species. For example, the species

390

known to carry chromosome regions with suppressed meiotic recombination located apart from

391

the centromeres would be of particular interest. Such regions occur, for instance, on sex

392

chromosomes (Vyskot & Hobza, 2015), which should allow for assessments of the effects of

393

suppressed recombination without the eventual interference of the centromeric chromatin. In this

394

respect, the spreading of short tandem arrays throughout the genome by mobile elements

395

represents a sort of natural experiment, providing template sequences for satDNA amplification,

396

which in turn, could be used to identify genome and chromatin properties favoring satDNA

397

emergence and persistence in the genome.

Methods

399

DNA isolation and nanopore sequencing

400

Seeds of Lathyrus sativus were purchased from Fratelli Ingegnoli S.p.A. (Milano, Italy, cat.no.

401

455). High molecular weight (HMW) DNA was extracted from leaf nuclei isolated using a

402

protocol adapted from (Vershinin & Heslop-Harrison, 1998) and (Macas et al., 2007). Five

403

grams of young leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder and incubated for

404

5 min in 35 ml of ice-cold H buffer (1x HB, 0.5 M sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethyl-

405

sulphonylfluoride (PMSF), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). The H

406

buffer was prepared fresh from 10x HB stock (0.1 M TRIS-HCl pH 9.4, 0.8 M KCl, 0.1 M

407

EDTA, 40 mM spermidine, 10 mM spermine). The homogenate was filtered through 48 μmm

408

nylon mesh, adjusted to 35 ml volume with 1x H buffer, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min at

409

4°C. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended and centrifuged using the same conditions after

410

placement in 35 ml of H buffer and 15 ml of TC buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM

411

NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2). The final centrifugation was performed for 5 min only, and

412

the nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of TC. HMW DNA was extracted from the pelleted nuclei

413

using a modified CTAB protocol (Murray & Thompson, 1980). The suspension of the nuclei

414

was mixed with an equal volume of 2x CTAB buffer (1.4 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,

415

2% CTAB, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) Na2S2O5, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at

416

50°C for 30-40 min. The solution was extracted with chloroform : isoamylalcohol (24:1) using

417

MaXtractTM High Density Tubes (Qiagen) and precipitated with a 0.7 volume of isopropanol

418

using a sterile glass rod to collect the DNA. Following two washes in 70% ethanol, the DNA

419

was dissolved in TE and treated with 2 μml of RNase Cocktail TM Enzyme Mix (Thermo Fisher

420

Scientific) for 1 h at 37°C. The DNA integrity was checked by running a 200 ng aliquot on

421

inverted field gel electrophoresis (FIGE Mapper, BioRad). Because intact HMW DNA gave poor

422

yields when used with the Oxford Nanopore Ligation Sequencing Kit, the DNA was mildly

423

fragmented by slowly passing the sample through a 0.3 x 12 mm syringe to get a fragment size

424

distribution ranging from ~30 kb to over 100 kb. Finally, the DNA was further purified by

425

mixing the sample with a 0.5 volume of CU and a 0.5 volume of IR solution from the Qiagen

426

DNeasy PowerClean Pro Clean Up Kit (Qiagen), centrifugation for 2 min at 15,000 rpm at room

427

temperature and DNA precipitation from the supernatant using a 2.5 volume of 96% ethanol.

428

The DNA was dissolved in 10 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.5 and stored at 4°C.

429

The sequencing libraries were prepared from 3 μg of the partially fragmented and purified DNA

430

using a Ligation Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the

431

manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the DNA was treated with 2 μml of NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair

432

Mix and 2 μml of NEBNext Ultra II End-prep enzyme mix in a 60 μml volume that also included

433

3.5 μml of FFPE and 3.5 μml of End-prep reaction buffers (New England Biolabs). The reaction was

434

performed at 20°C for 5 min and 65°C for 5 min. Then, the DNA was purified using a 0.4x

435

volume of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter); because long DNA fragments caused

436

clumping of the beads and were difficult to detach, the elution was performed with 3 mM TRIS-

437

HCl (pH 8.5) and was extended up to 40 min. Subsequent steps including adapter ligation using

438

NEBNext Quick T4 DNA Ligase and the library preparation for the sequencing were performed

439

as recommended. The whole library was loaded onto FLO-MIN106 R9.4 flow cell and

440

sequenced until the number of active pores dropped below 40 (21-24 h). Two sequencing runs

441

were performed, and the acquired sequence data was first analyzed separately to examine

442

eventual variations. However, because the runs generated similar read length profiles and

443

analysis results, the data were combined for the final analysis.

444

Bioinformatic analysis of the nanopore reads

445

The raw nanopore reads were basecalled using Oxford Nanopore basecaller Guppy (ver. 2.3.1).

446

Quality-filtering of the resulting FastQ reads and their conversion to the FASTA format were

447

performed with BBDuk (part of the BBTools, https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) run

448

with the parameter maq=8. Reads shorter than 30 kb were discarded. Unless stated otherwise, all

449

bioinformatic analyses were implemented using custom Python and R scripts and executed on a

450

Linux-based server equipped with 64 GB RAM and 32 CPUs.

451

Satellite repeat sequences were detected in the nanopore reads by similarity searches against a

452

reference database compiled from contigs assembled from clusters of L. sativus Illumina reads

453

in the frame of our previous study (Macas et al., 2015). Additionally, the database included

454

consensus sequences and their most abundant sequence variants calculated from the same

455

Illumina reads using the TAREAN pipeline (Novák et al., 2017) executed with the default

456

parameters and cluster merging option enabled. For each satellite, the reference sequences in the

457

database were placed in the same orientation to allow for the evaluation of the orientations of the

458

satellite arrays in the nanopore reads. The sequence similarities between the reads and the

459

reference database were detected using LASTZ (Harris, 2007). The program parameters were

460

fine-tuned for error-prone nanopore reads using a set of simulated and real reads with known

461

repeat contents while employing visual evaluation of the reported hits using the Integrative

462

Genomics Viewer (Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013). The LASTZ command including the optimized

463

parameters was “lastz nanopore_reads[multiple,unmask] reference_database -format=general:

464

name1,size1,start1,length1,strand1,name2,size2,start2,length2,strand2,identity,score –ambiguous

465

=iupac --xdrop=10 --hspthresh=1000”. Additionally, the hits with bit scores below 7000 and

466

those with lengths exceeding 1.23x the length of the corresponding reference sequence were

467

discarded (the latter restriction was used to discard the partially unspecific hits that spanned a

468

region of unrelated sequence embedded between two regions with similarities to the reference).

469

Because the similarity searches typically produced large numbers of overlapping hits, they were

470

further processed using custom scripts to detect the coordinates of contiguous repeat regions in

471

the reads (Fig. 1). The regions longer than 300 bp (satellite repeats) or 500 bp (rDNA and

472

telomeric repeats) were recorded and further analyzed. The positions and orientations of the

473

detected satellites were recorded in the form of coded reads where nucleotide sequences were

474

replaced by characters representing the codes for the detected repeats and their orientations, or

475

“0” and “X”, which denoted no detected repeats and annotation conflicts, respectively. In the

476

case of the analysis of repeats other than satellites, the reference databases were augmented for

477

assembled contig sequences representing the following most abundant groups of L. sativus

478

dispersed repeats: Ty3/gypsy/Ogre, Ty3/gypsy/Athila, Ty3/gypsy/Chromovirus, Ty3/gypsy/other,

479

Ty1/copia/Maximus, Ty1/copia/other, LTR/unclassified and DNA transposon. These repeats

481

were not arranged nor scored with respect to their orientations. In cases of annotation conflicts

482

of these repeats with the selected satellites, they were scored with lower priority.

483

Detection of the retrotransposon protein coding domains in the read sequences was performed

484

using DANTE, which is a bioinformatic tool available on the RepeatExplorer server

485

(https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/) employing the LAST program (Kielbasa et al.,

486

2011) for similarity searches against the REXdb protein database (Neumann et al., 2019). The

487

hits were filtered to pass the following cutoff parameters: minimum identity = 0.3, min.

488

similarity = 0.4, min. alignment length = 0.7, max. interruptions (frameshifts or stop codons) =

489

10, max. length proportion = 1.2, and protein domain type = ALL. The positions of the filtered

490

hits were then recorded in coded reads as described above.

491

Analysis of the association of the satellite arrays with other repeats was performed by

492

summarizing the frequencies of all types of repeats detected within 10 kb regions directly

493

adjacent to all arrays of the same satellite repeat family. Visual inspection of the repeat

494

arrangement within the individual nanopore reads using self-similarity dot-plot analysis was

495

performed using the Dotter (Sonnhammer & Durbin, 1995) and Gepard (Krumsiek et al.,

496

2007) programs.

497

Periodicity analysis was performed for the individual satellite repeat arrays longer than 30 kb

498

that were extracted from the nanopore reads and plotted for each array separately or averaged for

499

all arrays of the same satellite. The analysis was performed using the fast Fourier transform

500

algorithm (Venables & Ripley, 2002) as implemented in R programming environment. Briefly, a

501

nucleotide sequence X was converted to its numerical representation

^
X

where

1if X (i)= A
^
X (i)= 2 if X (i)=C
3if X (i)=G
4 if X (i)=T

{

502

For the resulting sequences of integers, fast Fourier transform was conducted, and the

503

frequencies f from the frequency spectra were converted to periodicity T as:
T=

L
f

504

where L is the length of the analyzed satellite array. The analysis reveals the lengths of

505

monomers and other tandemly repeated units like HORs as peaks at the corresponding positions

506

on the resulting periodicity spectrum. However, it should be noted that, while these sequence

507

periodicities will always be represented by peaks, some additional peaks with shorter periods

508

could have merely reflected higher harmonics that are present due to the non-sine character of

509

the numerical representation of nucleotide sequences (Li, 1997; Sharma et al., 2004).

510

Alternatively, periodicity was analyzed using the autocorrelation function as implemented in the

511

R programming environment (McMurry & Politis, 2010). Nucleotide sequence, X, was first

512

converted to four numerical representations: ^
XA, ^
XC , ^
XT , ^
X G where:
^
X N = 1 if X (i )=N
0 if X (i)≠N

{

513

The resulting numerical series were used to calculate the autocorrelations with a lag ranging

514

from 2 to 2000 nucleotides.

515

Chromosome preparation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

516

Mitotic chromosomes were prepared from root tip meristems synchronized using 1.18 mM

517

hydroxyurea and 15 μM oryzalin as described previously (Neumann et al., 2015). Synchronized

518

root tip meristems were fixed in a 3:1 v/v solution of methanol and glacial acetic acid for 2 days

519

at 4°C. Then the meristems were washed in ice-cold water and digested in 4% cellulase

520

(Onozuka R10, Serva Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany), 2% pectinase and 0.4%

521

pectolyase Y23 (both MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 90

522

min at 37°C. Following the digestion, the meristems were carefully washed in ice-cold water

523

and postfixed in the 3:1 fixative solution for 1 day at 4°C. The chromosome spreads were

524

prepared by transferring one meristem to a glass slide, macerating it in a drop of freshly made

525

3:1 fixative and placing the glass slide over a flame as described in (Dong et al., 2000). After

526

air-drying, the chromosome preparation were kept at -20°C until used for FISH.

527

Oligonucleotide FISH probes were labeled with biotin, digoxigenin or rhodamine-red-X at their

528

5' ends during synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium). They were used for

529

all satellite repeats except for FabTR-53, for which two genomic clones, c1644 and c1645, were

530

primers LASm7c476F (5’-GTT TCT TCG TCA GTA AGC CAC AG-3’) and LASm7c476R (5’-

verification of randomly picked clones as described (Macas et al., 2015). The same approach

538

The clones were biotin-labeled using nick translation (Kato et al., 2006). FISH was performed

539

according to (Macas et al., 2007) with hybridization and washing temperatures adjusted to

540

account for the AT/GC content and hybridization stringency while allowing for 10-20%

541

mismatches. The slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),

542

mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined

543

using a Zeiss AxioImager.Z2 microscope with an Axiocam 506 mono camera. The images were

544

captured and processed using ZEN pro 2012 software (Carl Zeiss GmbH).

Figure legends

732

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the analysis strategy. (A) Nanopore read (gray bar)

733

containing arrays of satellites A (orange) and B (green). The orientations of the arrays with

734

respect to sequences in the reference database are indicated. (B) LASTZ search against the

735

reference database results in similarity hits (displayed as arrows showing their orientation, with

736

colors distinguishing satellite sequences) that are quality-filtered to remove non-specific hits

737

(C). The filtered hits are used to identify the satellite arrays as regions of specified minimal

738

length that are covered by overlapping hits to the same repeat (D). The positions of these regions

739

are recorded in the form of coded reads where the sequences are replaced by satellite codes and

740

array orientations are distinguished using uppercase and lowercase characters (E). The coded

741

reads are then used for various downstream analyses. (F) Array lengths are extracted and

742

analyzed regardless of orientation of the arrays but while distinguishing the complete and

743

truncated arrays (here it is shown for satellite A). (G) Analysis of the sequences adjacent to the

744

satellite arrays includes 10 kb regions upstream (-) and downstream (+) of the array. This

745

analysis is performed with respect to the array orientation (compare the positions of upstream

746

and downstream regions for arrays in forward (A1, A3) versus reverse orientation (A2)).

747

Figure 2. Length distributions of the satellite repeat arrays. The lengths of the arrays

748

detected in the nanopore reads are displayed as weighted histograms with a bin size of 5 kb; the

749

last bin includes all arrays longer than 120 kb. The arrays that were completely embedded within

750

the reads (red bars) are distinguished from those that were truncated by their positions at the

751

ends of the reads (blue bars). Due to the array truncation, the latter values are actually

752

underestimations of the real lengths of the corresponding genomic arrays and should be

753

considered as lower bounds of the respective array lengths.

754

Figure 3. Sequence composition of the genomic regions adjacent to the satellite repeat

755

arrays. The plots show the proportions of repetitive sequences identified within 10 kb regions

756

upstream (positions -1 to -10,000) and downstream (1 to 10,000) of the arrays of individual

757

satellites (the array positions are marked by vertical lines, and the plots are related to the

758

forward-oriented arrays). Only the repeats detected in proportions exceeding 0.05 are plotted

759

(colored lines). The black lines represent the same satellite as examined.

Figure 5. Periodicity spectra revealed by the fast Fourier transform analysis of the satellite

766

repeat arrays. Each spectrum is an average of the spectra calculated for the individual arrays

767

longer than 30kb of the same satellite family or subfamily. The numbers of arrays used for the

768

calculations are in parentheses. The peaks corresponding to the monomer lengths listed in Table

769

770

order repeats are indicated by the horizontal line.

Figure 6. Distribution of the satellite repeats on the metaphase chromosomes of L. sativus

772

(2n = 14). (A-F) The satellites were visualized using multi-color FISH, with individual probes

773

labeled as indicated by the color-coded descriptions. The chromosomes counterstained with

774

DAPI are shown in gray. The numbers in panel (C) correspond to the individual chromosomes

775

that were distinguished using the hybridization patterns of the FabTR-54 sequences. This

776

satellite was then used for chromosome discrimination in combination with other probes. (G-I)

777

Simultaneous detection of the Ogre integrase probe (INT) and the satellite FabTR-52 subfamily

778

A demonstrates the different distribution of these sequences in the genome. The probe signals

779

and DAPI counterstaining are shown as separate grayscale images (G-I) and a merged image

(J). The arrows point to the primary constrictions of chromosomes 7.

Figure 1

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the analysis strategy. (A) Nanopore read (gray bar) containing
arrays of satellites A (orange) and B (green). The orientations of the arrays with respect to sequences in the
reference database are indicated. (B) LASTZ search against the reference database results in similarity hits
(displayed as arrows showing their orientation, with colors distinguishing satellite sequences) that are
quality-filtered to remove non-specific hits (C). The filtered hits are used to identify the satellite arrays as
regions of specified minimal length that are covered by overlapping hits to the same repeat (D). The
positions of these regions are recorded in the form of coded reads where the sequences are replaced by
satellite codes and array orientations are distinguished using uppercase and lowercase characters (E). The
coded reads are then used for various downstream analyses. (F) Array lengths are extracted and analyzed
regardless of orientation of the arrays but while distinguishing the complete and truncated arrays (here it is
shown for satellite A). (G) Analysis of the sequences adjacent to the satellite arrays includes 10 kb regions
upstream (-) and downstream (+) of the array. This analysis is performed with respect to the array
orientation (compare the positions of upstream and downstream regions for arrays in forward (A1, A3)
versus reverse orientation (A2)).

Figure 2

Figure 2. Length distributions of the satellite repeat arrays. The lengths of the arrays detected in the
nanopore reads are displayed as weighted histograms with a bin size of 5 kb; the last bin includes all arrays
longer than 120 kb. The arrays that were completely embedded within the reads (red bars) are distinguished
from those that were truncated by their positions at the ends of the reads (blue bars). Due to the array
truncation, the latter values are actually underestimations of the real lengths of the corresponding genomic
arrays and should be considered as lower bounds of the respective array lengths.

Figure 3. Sequence composition of the genomic regions adjacent to the satellite repeat arrays. The plots
show the proportions of repetitive sequences identified within 10 kb regions upstream (positions -1 to 10,000) and downstream (1 to 10,000) of the arrays of individual satellites (the array positions are marked by
vertical lines, and the plots are related to the forward-oriented arrays). Only the repeats detected in
proportions exceeding 0.05 are plotted (colored lines). The black lines represent the same satellite as
examined.

arrays. (B) A schematic representation of the Ogre element with the positions of the protein domains and
short tandem repeats downstream of the coding region.

Figure 5

Figure 5. Periodicity spectra revealed by the fast Fourier transform analysis of the satellite repeat
arrays. Each spectrum is an average of the spectra calculated for the individual arrays longer than 30kb of
the same satellite family or subfamily. The numbers of arrays used for the calculations are in parentheses.
The peaks corresponding to the monomer lengths listed in Table 1 are marked with red asterisks. The peaks
in the FabTR-2 spectrum corresponding to higher-order repeats are indicated by the horizontal line.

Figure 6

Figure 6. Distribution of the satellite repeats on the metaphase chromosomes of L. sativus (2n = 14).
(A-F) The satellites were visualized using multi-color FISH, with individual probes labeled as indicated by
the color-coded descriptions. The chromosomes counterstained with DAPI are shown in gray. The numbers
in panel (C) correspond to the individual chromosomes that were distinguished using the hybridization
patterns of the FabTR-54 sequences. This satellite was then used for chromosome discrimination in
combination with other probes. (G-I) Simultaneous detection of the Ogre integrase probe (INT) and the
satellite FabTR-52 subfamily A demonstrates the different distribution of these sequences in the genome.
The probe signals and DAPI counterstaining are shown as separate grayscale images (G-I) and a merged
image (J). The arrows point to the primary constrictions of chromosomes 7.
