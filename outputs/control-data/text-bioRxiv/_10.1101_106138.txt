Phylogenetic trees are an important analytical tool for evaluating community diversity and evolutionary
history. In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to
generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history
of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that
can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can
be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is timeconsuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require
programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface
for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based
on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Iroki’s utility for exploring biological and ecological
trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which
trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of
metadata. The Iroki web application and documentation are available at https://www.iroki.net or
through the VIROME portal (http://virome.dbi.udel.edu). Iroki’s source code is released under

INTRODUCTION
Community and population ecology studies often use phylogenetic trees as a means to assess the diversity
and evolutionary history of organisms. In the case of microorganisms, declining sequencing cost has
enabled researchers to gather ever-larger sequence datasets from unknown microbial populations within
environmental samples. While large sequence datasets have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history
of microbial groups (Simister et al., 2012; Müller et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Larkin et al., 2016; Wu
et al., 2016), they have also posed new analytical problems, as extracting meaningful trends from high
dimensional datasets can be challenging. In particular, scientific inferences made by visual inspection of
phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree.
Many solutions to this problem currently exist. Standalone tree visualization packages allowing
manual or batch modification of trees are available (e.g., Archaeopteryx (Han and Zmasek, 2009),
Dendroscope (Huson et al., 2007), FigTree (Rambaut, 2006), TreeGraph2 (Stöver and Müller, 2010),
Treevolution (Santamarı́a and Therón, 2009)), but the process can be time consuming and error prone
especially when dealing with trees containing many nodes. Some packages allow batch and programmatic
customizations through the use of an application programming interface (API) or command line software
(e.g., APE (Paradis et al., 2004), Bio::Phylo (Vos et al., 2011), Bio.Phylo (Talevich et al., 2012), ColorTree
(Chen and Lercher, 2009), ETE (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016), GraPhlAn (Asnicar et al., 2015), JPhyloIO
(Stöver et al., 2016), phytools (Revell, 2012), treeman (Bennett et al., 2017)). While these packages are
powerful, they require substantial computing expertise, which can be an impediment for some scientists.
Current web based tree viewers are convenient in that they do not require the installation of additional

software and provide customization and management features (e.g., Evolview (He et al., 2016), IcyTree
(Vaughan, 2017), iTOL (Letunic and Bork, 2016), PhyD3 (Kreft et al., 2017), Phylemon (Sánchez et al.,
2011), PhyloBot (Hanson-Smith and Johnson, 2016), Phylo.io (Robinson et al., 2016)), but often have
complex user interfaces or complicated file formats to enable complex annotations. Iroki strikes a balance
between flexibility and usability by combining visualization of trees in a clean, user-friendly web interface
with powerful automatic customization based on simple, tab-separated text files. Here, Iroki was used to
customize large trees containing hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes according to extensive collections
of metadata. These applications demonstrated the utility of Iroki for distilling biological and ecological
insights from microbial community sequence data. The particular use cases included examinations of
phage-host interactions, relative abundance of populations across sample types, and comparisons of viral
community composition across environmental gradients.

Iroki is a web application for visualizing and automatically customizing taxonomic and phylogenetic
trees with associated qualitative and quantitative metadata. Iroki is particularly well suited to projects in
microbial ecology and those that deal with microbiome data, as these types of studies generally have rich
sample-associated metadata and represent complex community structures. The Iroki web application and
documentation are available at the following web address: https://www.iroki.net, or through the
VIROME portal (http://virome.dbi.udel.edu) (Wommack et al., 2012). Iroki’s source code is
released under the MIT license and is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mooreryan/
iroki.
Implementation
Iroki is built with the Ruby on Rails web application framework. The main features of Iroki are written
entirely in JavaScript allowing all data processing to be done client-side. This provides the additional
benefit of eliminating the need to transfer potentially private data to an online service.
Iroki consists of two main modules: the tree viewer, which also handles customization with tabseparated text files (mapping files), and the color gradient generator, which creates mapping files to use in
the tree viewer based on quantitative data (such as counts) from a tab-separated text file similar to the
classic-style OTU tables exported from a JSON or hdf5 format biom file (McDonald et al., 2012)).
Tree viewer
Iroki uses JavaScript and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG, an XML-based markup language for representing vector graphics) for rendering trees. The Document Object Model (DOM) and SVG elements
are manipulated with the D3.js library (Bostock et al., 2011). Rectangular, circular, and radial tree
layouts are provided in the Iroki web application. Rectangular and circular layouts are generated using
D3’s cluster layout API (d3.cluster). For radial layouts, Algorithm 1 from Bachmaier et al. (2005)
was implemented in JavaScript. In addition to the SVG based tree viewer, Iroki also includes an HTML5
Canvas based viewer with a reduced set of features capable of displaying huge trees with millions of leaf
nodes (Supplementary Materials Sec. 4).
Iroki provides the option to automatically style aspects of the tree using a tab-separated text file
(mapping file). Entries in the first column of this file are matched against all leaf labels in the tree
using either exact or substring matching. If a leaf name matches a row in the mapping file, the styling
options specified by the remaining columns are applied to that node. Inner nodes are styled to match
their descendant nodes so that if all descendant nodes moving towards the inner parts of the tree have
the same style, then quick identification of clades sharing the same metadata is possible. Aspects of the
tree that can be automatically styled using the mapping file include leaf label color, font, size, and name,
leaf dot color and size, branch width and color, as well as bar charts and arcs. In addition to automatic
customization using a mapping file, various aspects of the tree can be adjusted directly through Iroki’s
user interface.
Color gradient generator
Iroki’s color gradient generator accepts tab-separated text files (similar to the classic-style count tables
exported by VIROME (Wommack et al., 2012) or QIIME 1 (Caporaso et al., 2010)) and converts the
numerical data (e.g., counts/abundances) into a color gradient. Several single-, two-, and multi-color

gradients are provided including cubehelix (Green, 2011) and those from ColorBrewer (Brewer et al.,
2013).
Iroki reads numerical data from tab-separated text files. Similar to the mapping file for the tree viewer,
the first column should match leaf names in the tree, and the remaining columns describe whatever aspect
of the data of interest to the researcher (e.g., counts or abundance). In a dataset with M observations and
N variables, the input file will then have M + 1 rows (the first row is the header) and N + 1 columns (the
first column specifies observation names). From this data, Iroki can generate color gradients in a variety
of ways.
Observation means A color gradient is generated based on the mean value of each observation across
all variables. In this case, each observation i would be represented as µi = ∑Nj=1 ci j , where ci j is the value
of observation (row) i for variable (column) j.
Observation ”evenness” A color gradient is generated based on the ”evenness” of observation i across
all N variables. Then, each observation i is represented by Pielou’s evenness index (Pielou, 1966)
calculated across all variables:

Ei = Hi /Hmax ,
112
113
114

where Hi is the Shannon entropy for observation i with respect to the N variables specified in the input
file, and Hmax is the maximum theoretical value of Hi . In this case, Hmax occurs when observation i has
equal values ci j across all N variables. Thus, we calculate Pielou’s evenness index for an observation i as

Ei =

log2 (N)

,

(2)

where N is the number of variables and pi j is the proportion of observation i in variable j (i.e.,
ci j / ∑Nj=1 ci j ).
In this way, the user can map observations with high evenness (i.e., an observation with approximately
the same value for each variable) to one side of the color gradient and observations with low evenness
(i.e., an observation with high values in a few variables and low values in most others) to the other side of
the gradient for easy identification.
Observation projection Data reduction can be a powerful method for extracting meaningful trends
in large, high-dimensional data sets. Given that microbiome or other studies in microbial ecology can
have hundreds of samples and a rich set of metadata associated with those samples, data reduction often
proves useful. Thus, Iroki provides a method to project the data into a single dimension and then map
that projection onto a color gradient. For data reduction, Iroki conducts a principal components analysis
(PCA) calculated via the singular value decomposition (SVD) using the LALOLib scientific computing
library for JavaScript (Lauer, 2017). Briefly, performing singular value decomposition on the centered
(and optionally scaled) count matrix X, with observations as rows and variables as columns, the following
decomposition is obtained:

X = USV T ,

(3)

132

where the columns of US are the principal component scores, S is the diagonal matrix of singular
values, and the columns of V are the principal axes. In this way, the color gradient matches the first
principal component, which maximizes the data variance.

is a growing interest in connecting viruses with their hosts through the analysis of metagenome data.
As such, researchers have used a variety of computational techniques to predict viral-host interactions
including CRISPR-spacer (Roux et al., 2016; Coutinho et al., 2017; Nishimura et al., 2017a) and tRNA
matches (Bellas et al., 2015; Roux et al., 2016; Coutinho et al., 2017; Nishimura et al., 2017a), sequence
homology (Roux et al., 2016; Coutinho et al., 2017; Nishimura et al., 2017a), abundance correlation
(Coutinho et al., 2017), and oligonucleotide profiles (Roux et al., 2015, 2016; Munson-McGee et al.,
2018).
We used Iroki to examine phage-host interactions at the taxonomic scale by constructing a tree based
on proteomic content (Rohwer and Edwards, 2002) from a subset of viral genomes from the Virus-Host
DB (Mihara et al., 2016) using ViPTree (Nishimura et al., 2017b) (Fig. 1; Supplementary Materials Sec.
1). A proteomic tree clusters phage based on relationships between the collection of protein-encoding
genes encoded within their genomes (Rohwer and Edwards, 2002; Nelson, 2004; Wommack et al., 2015).
Specifically, ViPTree bases its clustering on normalized tBLASTx scores between genomes following the
method of Mizuno et al. (2013).
Tree branches were colored by host phyla and virus family was indicated by a ring surrounding the
tree using Iroki’s bar plot options (Fig. 1; Supplementary Materials Sec. 1). As shown by the branch
coloring, host phyla mapped well onto the proteomic tree (i.e., large clusters of viruses that are similar
in their proteomic content often infect the same host phylum). Firmicutes-infecting phage (represented
by blue branches of the tree in Fig. 1) are confined almost exclusively to a large cluster in the top-left
quadrant of the tree. This large cluster of mostly Firmicutes-infecting viruses can be further partitioned
according to virus family, with a distinct group of myoviruses clustering separately from the other clades
which include mostly siphoviruses. The Actinobacteriophage (pink) also cluster near each other with
most viruses being confined to a few clusters at the bottom of the tree. The tight clustering of the
Actinobacteriophage phage is likely explained by the fact that many of the viruses infect a limited number
of hosts including Propionibacterium and Mycobacterium smegmatis from the SEA-PHAGES program
(https://seaphages.org) (Pope et al., 2011). In contrast, the Proteobacteria-infecting viruses
(green) are clustered in a few locations across the tree, with each cluster showing high levels of local
proteomic similarity.
Homology and similarity-based methods have previously been shown to be effective in predicting a
phage’s host (Edwards et al., 2016), perhaps because viruses that infect similar hosts are likely to have
more similar genomes (Villarroel et al., 2016). Given this and the fact that the proteomic tree clusters
viruses based on shared sequence content using homology and multiple sequence alignments (Rohwer
and Edwards, 2002), it is unsurprising that viruses infecting hosts from the same phylum often cluster
near each other on the proteomic tree. In fact, previous studies have used proteomic distance (Nishimura
et al., 2017a) and other measures of genomic similarity (Villarroel et al., 2016) to transfer host annotations
from viruses with known hosts to metagenome assembled viral genomes with unknown hosts. In contrast,
virus taxonomy is primarily based on multiple phenotypic criteria including virion morphology, host
range, and pathogenicity, rather than on genome sequence similarity (Simmonds, 2015; Simmonds et al.,
2017). One study found that for prokaryotic viruses, members of the same taxonomic family (as defined
by phenotypic criteria) were divergent and often not detectably homologous in genomic analysis. This
was especially true when considering members of the Caudovirales, which make up all the phage we
included in our analysis (Aiewsakun et al., 2018). Similar trends can be seen in Fig. 1, in which multiple
viral families as defined by tail morphology are found in the same cluster on the tree.
Bacterial community diversity and prevalence of E. coli in beef cattle
Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are dangerous human pathogens that colonize the lower
gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of cattle and other ruminants. STEC-contaminated beef and STEC cells shed
in the feces of these animals are major sources of foodborne illness (Hancock et al., 1994; Caprioli et al.,
2005). To identify possible interactions between STEC populations and the commensal cattle microbiome,
a recent study examined the diversity of the bacterial community associated with beef cattle hide (Chopyk
et al., 2016). Hide samples were collected over twelve weeks and SSU rRNA amplicon libraries were
constructed and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Fadrosh et al., 2014). The study found that
the structure of hide bacterial communities differed between STEC positive and STEC negative samples.
To illustrate Iroki’s utility for exploring changes in the relative abundance of taxa in conjunction
with metadata categories, a subset of cattle hide bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were

selected from the aforementioned study (Supplementary Materials Sec. 2). A Mann-Whitney U test
comparing OTU abundance between STEC positive and STEC negative samples was performed. Cluster
representative sequences from any OTU with a p-value < 0.2 from the Mann-Whitney U test were selected
and aligned against SILVA’s non-redundant, small subunit ribosomal RNA reference database (SILVA
Ref NR) (Quast et al., 2012) and an approximate-maximum likelihood tree inferred using SILVA’s online
Alignment, Classification and Tree (ACT) service (https://www.arb-silva.de/aligner/)
(Pruesse et al., 2012). Iroki was then used to display various aspects of the data set (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Materials Sec. 2). Branches of the tree were colored based on the p-value of the Mann Whitney U test
examining change in relative abundance with STEC contamination (dark green: p ≤ 0.05, light green:
0.05 < p ≤ 0.10, and gray: p > 0.10). Additionally, bar charts representing the log of relative abundance
of each OTU (inner bars) and the abundance ratio (outer bars) of OTUs in samples positive and negative
for STEC are shown. The color gradient for the inner bar series was generated using Iroki’s color gradient
generator. Finally, leaf labels show the order and family of the OTU and are colored by predicted OTU
phylum using one of the color palettes included in Iroki.
Decorating the tree in this way allows the user to explore the data and look for high-level trends.
For example, Firmicutes dominates the tree (e.g., Bacillales, Lactobacillales, Clostridiales). Members
of Clostridiales are at low-to-medium relative abundance compared to other OTUs on the tree. Some
Clostridiales OTUs (e.g., a majority of the Ruminococcaceae) tend to be at higher abundance in STEC
positive samples, whereas other Clostridiales OTUs, namely those classified as Lachnospiraceae, tend to
be at lower abundance in STEC positive samples. Previous studies have also identified significant positive
associations between STEC shedding and Clostridiales OTU abundance in general (Zhao et al., 2013)
and Ruminococcus OTUs abundance more specifically (Zaheer et al., 2017). In contrast, other studies
have found certain Ruminococcus OTUs associated with shedding cattle and other Ruminococcus OTUs
associated with non-shedding individuals (Xu et al., 2014). Apparent contradictions may be explained
by the fact that the various studies were examining the bacterial microbiome associated with different
locations on the cow (e.g., GI tract, recto-anal junction, hide). In fact, significant spatial heterogeneity
in community composition exists even among different sites along the gastrointestinal tract (Mao et al.,
2015)). Other potential explanations include methodological differences, or that variation associated with
STEC presence may be better explained by using more granular groupings than taxa and OTUs (e.g.,
amplicon sequence variants) (Callahan et al., 2017).
In this dataset more of the OTUs had a higher average relative abundance (brown bars) in STEC
negative samples than in STEC positive samples (blue bars). Similarly, in a study of the upper and lower
gastrointestinal tract microbiome of cattle, a majority of differentially abundant OTUs were found to be at
higher abundance in animals that were not shedding E. coli O157:H7 (Zaheer et al., 2017). In contrast,
another study found that over 75% of deferentially expressed OTUs were at greater abundance in STEC E.
coli shedding cattle (Xu et al., 2014).
Tara Oceans viromes
The ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) gene is common within viral genomes (Dwivedi et al., 2013) and RNR
polymorphism is predictive of certain biological and ecological features of viral populations (Sakowski
et al., 2014; Harrison et al., 2019). As such, it can be used as a marker gene for the study of viral
communities. To explore viral communities of the global ocean, we collected RNR proteins from the Tara
Oceans viral metagenomes (viromes). The Tara Oceans expedition was a two-and-a-half year survey that
sampled over 200 stations across the world’s oceans (Bork et al., 2015; Pesant et al., 2015). Forty-four
viromes were searched for RNRs (Supplementary Materials Sec. 3). Of these, three samples contained
fewer than 50 RNRs and were not used in the subsequent analysis. In total, 5,470 RNR sequences
across 41 samples were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and post-processed manually
to ensure optimal alignment quality. Then, FastTree (Price et al., 2010) was used to infer a phylogeny
from the alignment. Using this tree, the unweighted UniFrac distance (Lozupone and Knight, 2005)
between samples was calculated using QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010). A tree was generated from this
distance matrix in R using average-linkage hierarchical clustering. Additionally, Mantel tests identified
that conductivity, oxygen, and latitude were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with the UniFrac distance
between samples (Supplementary Materials Sec. 3). Finally, Iroki was used to generate color gradients
and add bar charts to visualize the data (Fig. 3). Coloring of the dendrogram with the Viridis color palette
(a dark blue, teal, green, yellow sequential color scheme) was based on a 1-dimensional projection of

sample conductivity, oxygen, and latitude calculated using Iroki’s color gradient generator. The color
gradient generator was also used to make the color palettes used for the bar charts.
Coloring the dendrogram based on a projection of the environmental conditions of the samples results
in samples with similar environmental metadata being similar in color. For example, the station 66
surface and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) samples are nearly identical to one another with respect to
conductivity, oxygen, and latitude and have the same dark bluish branch color. In contrast, surface samples
from stations 31 and 32 both have a lighter yellowish-green branch color. As the bar charts indicate, these
two samples are very similar to one another with respect to the metadata (hence their similar coloring),
but are rather different from the station 66 samples in branch color, reflecting the differences in metadata
between the two groups.
The combination of dendrogram coloring and bar charts assists in finding trends in the data. Since the
dendrogram is based on UniFrac distance between samples based on RNR OTUs, samples that cluster
together on the tree have more similar viral communities, according to RNR gene allele content, than
samples that are far from one another. In contrast, dendrogram branch coloring and the bar charts show
environmental information about the samples themselves (conductivity, oxygen, and latitude). Combining
these two aspects of the samples enables visualization of the relationship between the similarity of
RNR-containing viral communities and the environments in which they are found.
For example, the samples in the bottom half of the tree are, in general, from northern latitudes,
whereas samples towards the top tend to be from southern latitudes. In a previous study of the T4like viral communities of Polar freshwater lakes, no significant correlation between latitude and viral
community diversity was found in the Antarctic samples (Daniel et al., 2016). Though the Arctic lakes
were not tested among themselves for significant associations between latitude and viral community
richness (presumably due to the small latitudinal variation in Arctic sampling locations), Arctic and
Antarctic lakes were tested against one another; however, no significant difference in viral diversity was
seen with respect to pole of origin. The Antarctic samples from the study ranged from 67.84◦ S to 62.64◦
S, whereas the Tara Oceans viromes used to build the tree in Fig. 3 ranged from 62.18◦ S to 41.18◦ N. The
increased range of samples from the Tara survey may have enabled this shift in diversity to be detected.
Additionally, the previous study used g23, the gene for major capsid protein, to survey the viral community.
It is possible that a functional protein like RNR is more connected with environmental conditions than a
structural protein such as the T4-like major capsid protein. RNRs reduce ribonucleotides, the rate-limiting
step of DNA synthesis (Kolberg et al., 2004; Ahmad et al., 2012). There are several different types of
RNR, each with specific biochemical mechanisms and nutrient requirements (Nordlund and Reichard,
2006). Accordingly, the type of RNR carried by a cell or virus often reflects the environmental conditions
in which DNA replication occurs (Reichard, 1993; Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2011; Sakowski et al., 2014;
Srinivas et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019). A survey based on RNR, then, may provide more sensitivity in
detecting environmental effects on viral community structure. A significant relationship between T4-like
viral communities and bacterial assemblages was found however (Daniel et al., 2016), and numerous
other studies have reported a significant relationship between bacterial community diversity and latitude
(e.g., Ladau et al. (2013); Raes et al. (2018)), latitudinal variation in bacterial communities is likely linked
to viral community variation.
Certain clusters have been marked on the tree for further analysis. Cluster A (Station 85 DCM, Station
67 surface) contains the samples with the most divergent RNR-containing viral populations (Fig. 3)
according to the dendrogram. Station 85 DCM is also the sample with the lowest conductivity, highest
dissolved oxygen, and most southerly latitude, suggesting that the divergent conditions of the sample with
respect to the other included samples could be influencing the divergent RNR-containing viral population.
Clusters B and C also offer a good point of comparison (Fig. 3). In addition to the similarity of their
RNR-containing viral populations, samples in cluster B have highly similar conductivity, oxygen, and
latitude (as shown by their highly similar branch color and bar charts), suggesting a close connection
between sample composition and viral population. Cluster C is separate from cluster B on the dendrogram,
implying their RNR-containing viral populations are less similar. The sample metadata between the two
clusters is less similar as well, with Cluster B having on average a lower conductivity and higher dissolved
oxygen content than samples from cluster C.
Connections between viral community composition and environment have been seen before. Salinity,
which can be estimated from measurements of electrical conductivity (Pawlowicz, 2012, 2019), has been
shown to affect viral-host interactions. In a viral-host system of halovirus SNJ1 with its host, Natrinema

sp. J7-2, viral adsorption rates and lytic/lysogenic rates were measured at varying salt concentrations.
Adsorption and lytic rate were found to increase with salt concentration, whereas the lysogenic rate
decreased (Mei et al., 2015). In a system of tropical coastal lagoons, salinity was found to be one of the
main factors positively affecting viral abundance (Junger et al., 2018). Viral community structure has also
been associated with shifts in salinity in various environments (Bettarel et al., 2011; Emerson et al., 2013;
Winter et al., 2013; Finke and Suttle, 2019). These shifts likely effect a change in the host communities,
which is reflected in the shifts in viral communities.
Cluster C can be further divided into two clusters, C1 and C2. While the samples in C1 are closer to
those in C2 than to those in cluster B in terms of their RNR-carrying viral populations, the samples in C1
are more similar to the samples in cluster B with respect to their metadata projection. The similar branch
coloring between samples in clusters B and C1, despite their large differences in latitude, occurs because
more of the variation in first principal component (the principal component on which the Viridis coloring
is based) is explained by conductivity and oxygen than by latitude (Fig. 4; full ordination: Supplementary
Figure S1). More striking examples can be found elsewhere in the tree. For example, station 66 surface,
station 66 DCM, and station 34 surface cluster together on the dendrogram based on viral community
similarity (cluster F), but the conductivity, oxygen, and latitude values for sample 34 surface are quite
different from the station 66 samples. Thus, while these three metadata categories were significantly
correlated with sample UniFrac distance, other factors also play a role in shaping the viral communities.
Overall, using Iroki to add color and bar charts based on environmental metadata to the dendrogram based
on RNR-carrying viral community structure helps visualize that high-level viral community structure can
be influenced by the environmental parameters of the sample in which they originate.

Iroki is a web application for fast, automatic customization and visualization of large phylogenetic trees
based on user specified, tab-delimited configuration files with categorical and numeric metadata. Various
example datasets from microbial ecology studies were analyzed to demonstrate Iroki’s utility. In each
case, Iroki simplified the processes of data exploration and presentation. Though these examples focused
specifically on applications in microbial ecology, Iroki is applicable to any problem space with hierarchical
data that can be represented in the Newick tree format. Iroki provides a simple and convenient way to
rapidly visualize and customize trees, especially in cases where the tree in question is too large to annotate
manually or in studies with many trees to annotate.

Figure 2. Changes in OTU abundance in two sample groups. Approximate-maximum likelihood
tree of hide SSU rRNA OTUs that showed differences in relative abundance between STEC positive and
STEC negative cattle hide samples. Branch and leaf dot coloring represents the p-value of a
Mann-Whitney U test (dark green: p ≤ 0.05, light green: 0.05 < p ≤ 0.1, gray: p > 0.1) testing for
changes in OTU abundance between STEC positive samples and STEC negative samples. Inner bar
heights represent log transformed OTU abundance, and outer bars represent the abundance ratio between
STEC positive and STEC negative samples (blue bars for higher abundance in STEC positive samples
and brown bars for OTUs with higher abundance in STEC negative samples). Taxa labels show the
predicted Order and Family of the OTU and are colored by the predicted phylum using the Paul Tol
Muted color palette included with Iroki.

Figure 3. Tara Oceans virome similarity with associated metadata. Average-linkage hierarchical
clustering of sample UniFrac distance based on RNR sequences mined from 41 Tara Oceans viromes.
Major and sub-clusters of samples (A-G) are labeled. Branch color is based on a scaled, 1-dimensional
projection of sample conductivity, oxygen, and latitude onto the cubehelix color gradient. Samples that
are more similar to each other in branch color represent those that are more similar to each other with
respect to the environmental parameters in the ordination. The first bar series (purple) represents sample
conductivity (mS/cm), the second bar series (orange) represents sample dissolved oxygen levels
(µmol/kg), and the third bar series (brown/green) represents sample latitude (degrees). For the first two
bar series, shorter bars with lighter colors indicate lower values, while longer bars with darker colors
indicate higher values. For the third series, longer, dark brown bars indicate samples with extreme
negative latitudes, whereas longer, dark blue bars indicate samples with extreme positive latitudes.
Samples with intermediate latitudes are represented by shorter, light colored bars. Sample labels
represent the station from which the virome was acquired and are colored by sampling depth, with light
blue representing surface samples and dark blue representing samples from the deep chlorophyll
maximum at that station.
