Abstract

16

A novel efflux pump similar to Nor efflux pumps and designated as NorK was identified in

17

Staphylococcus aureus. It contributes to norfloxacin resistance and presents a high level of

18

expression in different strains. Its expression is not regulated by MgrA, unlike other genes of the

19

nor gene family, suggesting that NorK could be important in the absence of expression of other

20

nor genes.

22

Staphylococcus aureus is a major opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for a

23

variety of diseases (1). Its success in causing life-threatening infections is due to its considerable

24

production of toxins and ability to develop resistance to a wide spectrum of antibacterial

25

compounds (2, 3). Various systems have been developed by S. aureus to make it resistant to these

26

substances, such as the alteration of drug binding sites, drug inactivation and the involvement of

27

efflux pumps.

28

The term multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps refers to numerous efflux pumps that are

29

classified into two major groups: (i) ABC-type transporters, which utilize ATP hydrolysis to extrude

30

target drugs, and (ii) secondary multidrug transporters, which exploit proton and sodium

31

gradients as energy sources. Among this latter group, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) has

32

been studied extensively in staphylococcal species. In S. aureus, the Nor protein family belongs

33

to the MFS and can extrude a broad range of antibiotic substances such as the fluroquinolones

34

(FQ), norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Four different pumps involved in FQ resistance have been

35

described previously (4–7). NorA and NorB are responsible for a relatively high-level of resistance

36

to hydrophobic quinolones, whereas NorC seems to be involved in a low-level of resistance (6).

37

The NorD substrates remain to be discovered.

38
39

Here, we report a new chromosomally encoded Nor protein called NorK, which is highly
expressed independently of MgrA regulation and involved in norfloxacin resistance.

40

Identification of a new putative efflux pump. In a previous study (Briaud et al., 2019), we

41

identified 4 different nor related genes from RNA sequencing data, using S. aureus NCTC8325 as

42

a reference genome (GenBank CP000253). Three of them have already been described: norB

43

(SAOUHSC_01448), norC (SAOUHSC_00058) and norD (SAOUHSC_02762). The last gene

44

SAOUHSC_02740 was encoded for an unknown protein and annotated as a putative drug

45

transporter. The so-called norK gene is 1.401 nucleotides long (Fig. S1) and encodes for a

46

hypothetical protein of 466 amino acids. This protein shares relatively high homology with NorB

47

(57% identity and 76% similarity) and NorC (59% identity and 74% similarity) but low homology

48

with the NorA and NorD pumps (16% identity and 34% similarity with NorA, 16% identity and 39%

49

similarity with NorD). A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on Nor proteins and major

50

chromosomically encoded MFS efflux pumps from S. aureus NCTC8325 using ClustalW alignment

51

and the Maximum Likelihood method. As depicted by the cluster formed by both proteins (Fig.1),

52

NorK is closely related to NorB and NorC. ClustalW alignment of NorK with NorB and NorC

53

proteins revealed that highly conserved domains were shared (Fig.2). Moreover, the NorK protein

54

presented 14 transmembrane domains predicted by the Phyre2 web portal (8), similar to those

55

observed in the NorB and NorC pumps. Together these data suggest that NorK belongs to the

56

same family as the Nor proteins previously described. To assess if this pump was widely

57

distributed among S. aureus, BLAST analysis on a large collection of genotypically diverse

58

bacteremia isolates (9) was performed. The results showed that 98% (123/126) harbor norK genes

59

(identity and coverage >90%).

60

The expression of norK genes was explored by RT-qPCR (protocol in supplementary data) on 5

61

different laboratory strains of S. aureus and compared to norA, B, C and D gene expressions. The

62

norK transcript was consistently detected in all the strains tested at a level similar to norA and

63

norD genes (Fig. 3 and S2), supporting functionality.

64

MgrA can act as a repressor or an activator of norA, norB and norC genes (5–7) depending on the

65

RsbU strain background and as a result of its phosphorylation state (22). We thus explored norK

66

gene expression in the Newman wild-type (WT, rsbU+) and the Newman ∆mgrA strain (11). mgrA

67

deletion had no impact on norK expression while increased norA and norC and decreased norB

68

expression were observed as expected for a RsbU positive background (Fig. 4) (10, 12).

69

NorK efflux activity and involvement in antibiotic resistance. To assess the functionality of NorK,

70

thus its efflux activity, an overexpressing S. aureus strain was built (protocol in supplementary

71

data) and an ethidium bromide efflux assay was performed as previously described (13). The rate

72

of fluorescent loss in norK-overexpressing strains was significantly higher compared to the WT

73

strain (Fig. 5). Antibiotic efflux was tested by time-kill assay in the presence of a representative

74

anti-staphylococcal fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, as previously described (14). Wild-type and

75

norK-overexpressing strains were cultivated for 8 hours in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented

76

with norfloxacin at ½MIC (0.19µg/mL), MIC (0.38µg/mL) and 2MIC (0.76µg/mL). At 2, 4, 6 and 8

77

hours, bacteria were enumerated by plating on TSA. The survival rates of the norK-overexpressing

78

strain were significantly higher (between 0.5 log and 1 log CFU/ml) than those for the WT strain.

79

In conclusion, NorK is a new member of the nor gene family and contributes to S. aureus

80

norfloxacin resistance. NorK is widely distributed within S. aureus strains and its high level of

81

expression may point to an important role in antibiotic resistance and fitness during the

82

colonization of infectious niches. Moreover, the MgrA-independent regulation of norK indicates

83

that its expression could be induced even though other nor-regulated genes were not expressed.

84

Further studies will be necessary to explore the expression profiles of nor genes in different

85

conditions (e.g., antibiotic stresses, infectious niches).
