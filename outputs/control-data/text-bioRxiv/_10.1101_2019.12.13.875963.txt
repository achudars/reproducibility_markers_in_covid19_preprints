Abstract: Fibrosis can affect any organ resulting in the loss of tissue architecture and
function with often life-threatening consequences. Pathologically, fibrosis is
characterised by expansion of connective tissue due to excessive deposition of
extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), including the fibrillar forms of collagen. A
significant hurdle for discovering cures for fibrosis is the lack of suitable models and
techniques to quantify mature collagen deposition in tissues. Here we have
extensively characterized an ex-vivo cultured human lung derived, precision-cut lung
slices model (hPCLS) using live fluorescence light microscopy as well as mass
spectrometry-based techniques to obtain a proteomic and metabolomic fingerprint.
Using an integrated approach of multiple readouts such as quantitative label-free
Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging to measure fibrillar collagen in the
extracellular matrix and ELISA-based methods to measure soluble ECM biomarkers,
we investigated TGFbeta1-mediated pro-fibrotic signalling in hPCLS. We
demonstrate that hPCLS are viable and metabolically active with mesenchymal,
epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells surviving for at least two weeks in ex vivo
culture. Analysis of hPCLS-conditioned supernatants showed strong induction of
ECM synthesis proteins P1NP and fibronectin upon TGFb stimulation. Importantly,
this effect translated into an increased deposition of fibrillar collagen in ECM of
cultured hPCLS as measured by a novel quantitative SHG-based imaging method
only following addition of a metalloproteinase inhibitor (GM6001). Together the data
show that an integrated approach of measuring soluble pro-fibrotic markers and
quantitative SHG-based analysis of fibrillar collagen is a valuable tool for studying
pro-fibrotic signalling and testing anti-fibrotic agents.
Introduction:
Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a hallmark of fibrosis. This
leads to alteration of tissue architecture, subsequently loss of its function and
ultimately to end-stage organ failure1. In the developed world, 45% of all deaths are
attributed to conditions related to an excess of ECM deposition2. While fibrosis
contributes to exacerbated pathology in cancer, myocardial infarctions and ageing, it
is also a primary cause of mortality in fibrotic disease of kidneys, liver and lung in
particular3. Chronic interstitial lung disease (ILDs) is the most common form of
pulmonary fibrosis (European Respiratory Society). ILDs have been subdivided into
over 300 subtypes among which idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most
prevalent (European Respiratory Society). Upon damage of epithelial and endothelial

cells in various organs, an inflammatory response is launched which triggers blood
clot formation and ECM repair. Part of this repair mechanism is the release of
cytokines such as TGFß1 that initiate the activation of macrophages and fibroblasts3.
Activated fibroblasts express alpha-SMA, which leads to their differentiation in
myofibroblasts3. Persistent chronic inflammation triggers unchecked proliferation of
myofibroblasts, increased epithelial to mesenchymal cell type transition 3.
Mesenchymal population of cells have an enhanced ability to produce ECM
components and a combination of these events result in a derailed tissue repair
process leading to tissue scarring3. TGFß1 is considered to be the master regulator
of signalling pathways (pro-fibrotic) that leads to an abnormally excessive deposition
of extracellular matrix4. Induction of pro-fibrotic signalling also shifts the delicate
balance between synthesis and breakdown of collagens and other ECM5 proteins in
favour of excessive deposition and pathological stiffening of ECM with loss of tissue
compliance. This excessive deposition and stiffness of ECM causes a physical
abnormality that leads to atrophying of alveolar tissue3 and subsequent suffocation.
In IPF patients the fibrotic foci are characterized by abnormally high content of
fibrillar collagen (type I, III and V)3,6. At the ECM level, presence of these fibrillar
collagens are the physical cause of eventual mortality7. Despite our understanding of
the molecular basis underlying the fibrotic process, to date only two licensed drugs;
pirfenidone and nintedanib8 are approved for the treatment of IPF. These medicines
have very low efficacy and hence patient high withdrawal rates9. The lack of more
effective anti-fibrotic therapies may be attributed in part (a) to the absence of
adequate model systems that can mimic the pathophysiology of the fibrotic process
as related to human physiology10, (b) to indirect functional readouts of biomarkers
used for quantifying disease progression. Currently, using ELISA based
measurements of cleavage products of collagen propeptides such as type I or III and
VI, collagen can be quantified as they are cleaved of during formation. These
cleavage products reveal information on fibrosis disease progression11. While these
biomarkers are crucial their correlation/ dynamics to excess deposition is still to be
established. Microscopic detection of fibrillar collagen is also difficult due to lack of
specific antibodies. Therefore, we have sought to establish a quantitative label-free
second harmonic generation imaging workflow for fibrillar collagen in hPCLS.
Murine experimental models of fibrosis are frequently used to study lung, liver and
kidney fibrosis. Typically, pulmonary fibrosis is induced either using genetic
manipulation (MUC5b overexpression, a genetic risk factor identified in large cohorts
of IPF patients)12 or chemical induction (bleomycin sulphate, amiodarone, carbon
tetrachloride)13. While these model systems help to understand acute signalling
pathways preceding tissue damage and, in some instances, chemicals such as
bleomycin sulphate can be used as causative agents14. Furthermore, in vivo models
lack histological features of human disease and can spontaneously resolve,
therefore failing to recapitulate the irreversible end-stage disease. These model
systems have highlighted an inflammatory component present during the
development of fibrotic disease, yet anti-inflammatory drugs have failed in clinical
development15,16. Based on these findings, therapies involving corticosteroids
(prednisone) with or without immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine and
cyclophosphamide) were used to treat IPF. In fact, some drugs have had adverse
effects that worsen patient condition15,16.
Human precision-cut lung slices (hPCLS), 3-dimensional, uniformly cut slices of lung
tissue that may be maintained in ex vivo culture have emerged as a promising
potential model system. PCLS (rat lung and human) came into existence in the early
1990s17,18 but have only recently been used as a model for evaluating human

disease pathophysiology19. Several groups have used this model system to
recapitulate pro-fibrotic signalling10,20,21although the mechanisms at play and the
validation of the molecular changes that hPCLS undergo in ex vivo culture are still
elusive. These studies do show an induction in fibrotic signalling but a functional
readout of enhanced ECM deposition is lacking. Furthermore, none of these studies
have characterized the presence of fibrosis essential cell types such as epithelial,
mesenchymal and immune cell types3. Myofibroblasts are the key cellular source of
collagen in fibrosis but these cells are derived from tissue-resident mesenchymal,
epithelial and endothelial cells3.
Also, it is assumed that in hPCLS cell/cell and cell/matrix interactions are well
preserved, however, no study has been conducted to evaluate such claims.
Therefore, in this study using mass spectrometry and light microscopy-based
approaches we first sought to investigate and characterize the changes of protein
expression in the four major cell types present in lung tissue when hPCLS are ex
vivo cultured. Second, to investigate the pro-fibrotic signalling induced by TGFß1
stimulation, we established a new, quantitative, label-free second harmonic
generation imaging method that can measure deposited fibrillar collagen in the
extracellular matrix upon pro-fibrotic stimulation. This model represents a human
translational model system that could be used for testing antifibrotic agents.
Results:
Proteomic dissection of molecular changes in hPCLS over time in ex-vivo
culture conditions.
To use hPCLSs for mimicking a particular disease involving certain cell types and
signalling pathways, it is imperative to characterize this model system in given ex
vivo culture conditions. We used mass spectrometry-based proteomics and
untargeted metabolomics to monitor hPCLS proteome and metabolome over time in
ex vivo culture. Here, ex vivo cultured hPCLS in DMEM were harvested on different
days (day 1, day 4, day 7, day 10 and day 13) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Subsequently, lysates were prepared for mass spectrometry-based proteomic and
metabolomic analysis. For proteomic analysis, 2 % SDS soluble fraction of hPCLS (4
donors) were subjected to LC/MS analysis. Approximately 5500 proteins were
detected across 4 donors (2 X 2hPCLS/donor at each time point) and of those, 4288
common proteins were subjected to analysis (excel sheetSuplementaryProtTimeCourse). Differential analysis (Figure 1 A) of log2 fold change
in protein levels with respect to the previous time point of harvest was plotted. The
analysis shows (blue and red points) that hPCLS undergo moderate molecular
changes compared to day 1 till day 13 (in total on day 13, 17%, 728 out of 4288
proteins changed significantly). Of the 17% changes, 10% of changes take place
from day 1 to day 7 and the remaining 7% from day 7 to day 13. No new proteins fit
the significance criterion upon comparing day 10, day 13 to day 7 and 10
respectively (Figure1A). On day 13, 343 proteins out of 728 regulated genes were
downregulated and 385 were upregulated.
Cytoscape based network analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B) of significantly
regulated proteins on day 13 vs day 1 showed primarily an upregulation of pathways
involving proteins related to degrading ECM whereas only few pertaining to the
formation of ECM. A significant upregulation of inflammatory signalling pathways
were observed, such as neutrophil degranulation and innate immune system.

Figure 01: Multiomic analysis of molecular changes in ex vivo cultured hPCLS: (A) Volcano plot
analysis of the proteome of hPCLS cultured ex vivo over time. Log2FC of the respective proteome on
a given day of culture was normalized to the previous time point. Analysis highlights that hPCLS
undergo moderate changes in first few days of culture and remain stable over time. (B) Untargeted
metabolomic analysis of hPCLS was performed. Volcano plot analysis of log2FC changes in ions was
performed similarly as above. The analysis confirms that hPCLS undergo very moderate metabolic
changes similarly as the proteome changes.

We further analysed the proteomics data to investigate the dynamics of different cell
types underlying the observed changes in protein levels. Human lung tissue is
mainly composed of Immune, mesenchymal, endothelial and epithelial cells. Lung
Gene Expression Analysis (LGEA) web portal has established a database of gene
expression of each cell type (also age-dependent, from neonatal to adult stages) in
both mouse and human lungs22,23. In this database, the transcriptome of flow-sorted
human lung cells have been designated as CD45+ immune cells, CD45-/PECAM/VECadherin-/EpCAM+ mixed epithelial cells, CD45-/PECAM+/VECadherin+ mixed
endothelial cells and CD45-/PECAM-/VECadherin-/EpCAM- mixed mesenchymal
cells. We compared (excel sheet-SuplementaryCellTypeComp-TimeCourse)
significantly regulated (log2FC ≥0.5 and ≤-0.5 and fdr p-value ≤ 0.05) proteins on
day 13 vs day 1 to the list of exclusive proteins attributed to different cell classes (in
LGEA23 analysis). Figure Suppl. 01C shows that different cell type markers are
present on day 13 in our culture system, and no exclusive upregulation nor any
downregulation of a particular cell type could be identified by this method over the
time here analyzed. Of the 728 significantly regulated proteins (day 13 vs day 1), we
found proteins exclusively expressed in specific cell types, 61 in mesenchymal, 33 in
immune, 25 in epithelial and 32 in endothelial cells. Among the significantly regulated
mesenchymal proteins, pro-fibrotic collagens7 such COL5A1 (Log2FC -0.7) and
COL3A1 (Log2FC -0.9) were significantly downregulated. Given collagen class of
proteins is highly relevant for fibrosis progression7, this observation prompted us to
look into the pattern of regulation of all the collagens detected. Data shows that
under current culture conditions, the majority of the detected collagens (TableS1)

undergo downregulation over time including COL1, COL4 and COL6. Furthermore,
there is a significant upregulation of MMP2 (Log2FC 2.1) and MMP14 (Log2FC
2.27), metalloproteinases involved in degrading fibrillar collagens24 such as COLI,
COLII, COLIII and COLV. In general, the metalloproteinases detected over the
course of ex vivo culture show an upregulated expression (Table S1).
Metabolomic and live imaging analysis hPCLS stability over time in ex-vivo
culture conditions:
To investigate whether hPCLS are metabolically active ex vivo, samples were
harvested as for the proteomic analysis, and in addition solubilized and mechanically
homogenized to extracts metabolites. These were subjected to LC/MS-based
untargeted metabolomic analysis 25. A total of 3523 metabolites were detected (excel
sheet-Suplementarymetabolome) reproducibly in > 90% of the samples (3 donors, 3
technical replicates/ donor, 1 technical replicate=2 hPCLS). Contrary to proteomics
data that showed a linear increase in significantly regulated proteins (each day
compared day 1), metabolome had ca. 330 metabolites differentially regulated on
day 04, 07, 10 and 13 (compared day 1). The differential analysis of metabolomics
data (Figure. 1B) revealed that the hPCLS metabolome undergoes changes between
day 1 to day 04 of ex vivo culture but is subsequently stable with no statistically
significant changes from day 04 to day 13 (Figure1B). Similar to the proteomic data,
metabolomic data also show that the changes occurred initially between day 1 to day
04 increase in magnitude till day 13 (supplementary Figure 01E). We also performed
a pathway analysis of the significantly regulated annotated metabolites (day 1 vs day
13), but no enrichment of specific pathways was observed. We analysed changes in
the response of selected metabolites sensitive to changes in tissue health. Here we
observed hPCLS are metabolically stable in ex vivo culture (Supplementary Figure01
F). Of note, Adenosine triphosphate levels of the hPCLS remained unchanged and
L-Lactic acid levels significantly built up over time in culture, implicating a
metabolically active 3D tissue system. Also, L-Glutamine was increasingly being
metabolized by hPCLS without undergoing any oxidative stress (as depicted by
stable levels of the redox-sensitive metabolites cysteine-glutathione disulfide and
glutathione).
To further assess cell viability in hPCLS ex vivo culture we also performed live
confocal microscopy for live/ dead cell analysis (CalceinAM/ Ethidium homodimer
kit). Subsequent image analysis showed that there is no significant change in livecell signal over time in the ex vivo culture from day 1 to day 13 (Supplementary
Figure01A) while dead cell number considerably decreased from day 1 to day 04.
These results are consistent with other studies10,20 that have assessed the viability of
hPCLS ex vivo culture albeit for 5-7 days.
Taken together these data show that in this hPCLS ex-vivo culture system all the
relevant cell types (mesenchymal, epithelial, endothelial, immune) and signalling
pathways whose interplay is important for studying pro-fibrotic signalling, are
present. The system shows the presence of complex healthy wound healing
response upon exposure to physical injury (tissue slicing), and of inherent
metalloproteinase signalling, extracellular matrix organization and smooth muscle
responses (Supplementary Figure 01B).
Induction of pro-fibrotic signalling upon TGFß1 stimulation in ex-vivo hPCLS
culture
TGFß1 is a cytokine regarded as master regulator of fibrotic signalling26. To induce
pro-fibrotic signalling in our culture system we used TGFß1 (10ng/ml) as reported

previously by other groups both in murine model systems27 and hPCLS10, however in
our case for longer time and repetitively. Here hPCLS were replenished with fresh
medium containing human recombinant TGFß1 after every 72 hours for 13 days in
ex vivo culture. Supernatants were collected on day 4, day 7 and day 13. These
supernatants were subjected to proprietary competitive ELISA for detecting selected
neoepitope28 pro-fibrotic markers such as Procollagen 1 N- terminal propeptide
(PRO-C1)29, the C-terminal part of Fibronectin (FBN-C), Collagen type III
degradation marker (C3M). Consistent with other studies10,30, TGFß1 stimulation
increased the level of PRO-C1 and FBN-C detected in the media supernatants
indicating induction of pro-fibrotic signalling, while C3M showed no changes.
To better characterize how the hPCLS model system would respond to TGFß1
stimulation, we analysed TGFß1 effects at the proteomic level (4 donors). Here,
hPCLS (vehicle-treated and TGFß1 treated) were harvested on day 13 of ex vivo
culture. The hPCLS were subjected to 2% SDS solubilization and mechanical
disruption. Subsequently, lysates were subjected to LC/MS. A total of 6600 proteins
per replicate per donor were detected,

of these only 3998 common proteins found (excel sheet SuplementaryProtTGF) in 8
replicates (4 donors) were subjected to downstream data analysis. On day 13
hPCLS treated with TGFß1 showed 109 proteins were significantly (Log2FC
between 0.58 and -0.58, fdr p-value of 0.05) regulated (out of 3998, Figure
supplement 2A). A curated data analysis of these proteins showed upregulation of
prominent pro-fibrotic markers such as COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, FBN-C and
many others (Figure 2B). Consistent with other studies many TGFß1 regulated profibrotic markers such as THBS131, THBS232 , VCAN and TNC33, FKBP1034 were
upregulated as well. Furthermore, significantly regulated proteins were subjected to
pathway analysis using Cytoscape (Supplementary Figure2B). This analysis shows
induction of pro-fibrotic pathways such as embryonic morphogenesis, ECM
organization, interleukin signalling and downregulation of pro-epithelial injury
signalling pathways such as surfactant metabolism35–38. Interestingly, proteomic
analysis of peripheral blood from IPF patients has been shown to have
downregulation of cell proliferation39pathways, similar to the proteome of TGFß1
treated hPCLS analysed in our study.
Furthermore, we curated the significantly regulated proteins on day 13 in TGFß1
treated hPCLS (vs day 13, unstimulated hPCLS) to those of different cell type
markers listed in LGEA web portal22,23. Strikingly, data (supplementary figure 2C)
shows that the majority of the significantly downregulated proteins (ca. 88%, 39 out
of 44) belong to Epithelial class of cells while those upregulated belong to
mesenchymal cell class (ca. 99%, 64 out of 65). These data support that this TGFß1
stimulation induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition based pro-fibrotic
signalling system4 in our culture condition of hPCLS. Both readouts of collagen
synthesis, ELISA for the supernatant and SDS soluble fraction for the intracellular,
showed high upregulation (Figure 2A-B). While it is important to measure regulation
of various markers of a pro-fibrotic process to validate induction of pro-fibrotic
signalling, to better assess the functional consequences it is necessary to confirm
that this signalling translates into higher extracellular deposition of fibrillar collagen.
Several recent studies10,20,21 have shown induction of pro-fibrotic signalling in ex-vivo
cultured hPCLS using TGFß1 stimulation10 or a cocktail of pro-fibrotic factors20 but a
validation of consistent and specific ECM deposition (fibrillar collagen in particular) is
still lacking. Next we investigated whether the observed upregulation was translating
into deposition of fibrillar collagens in the extracellular matrix.
Quantitative label-free Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging analysis of
fibrillar collagen in ECM upon TGFß1 stimulation.
Here, we employed label-free SHG imaging to quantitatively measure deposition of
fibrillar collagen in our ex vivo cultured hPCLS upon TGFß1 stimulation. When
biological tissue is illuminated with 2 photon laser, individual noncentrosymmetric
molecules generate a second harmonic signal with double the frequency and half the
wavelength length of the input laser40. In human tissues acto-myosin complex of
skeletal muscles (cytosolic)41, large microtubules42 (cytosolic) and fibrillar collagen40
(extracellular matrix) have the noncentrosymmetry required to generate SHG signal.
Given, large fibrillar collagen is only present in ECM, it makes SHG imaging a highly
specific and a suitable technique for quantitative measurements of matrix deposition.
Even though SHG imaging of tissue has been employed in several studies 43–45 and
also in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis12, a systematic quantitative workflow in
particular for human lung tissue samples is still lacking. First, we compared healthy
hPCLS (derived from tumour-free lung tissue) with those derived from end-stage

interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)] patients.
patients using SHG imaging. 250µm thick and 8mm in diameter hPCLS from day 0
were chemically fixed. The entire hPCLS were imaged (Figure 3A-B). Subsequently,
the acquired 3D stacks were analysed using a semi-automated image analysis
pipeline (Jython script-image analysis) in FIJI. As expected, the analysis showed
significantly more deposited fibrillar collagen in ILD hPCLS. We observed the SHG
signal originating from airways or blood vessels (Figure 3B*) was similar in intensity
between healthy and ILD tissues, while interstitial collagen signal (Figure 3B*)
showed dramatic increase in ILD compared to healthy condition. Next, to investigate
whetherTGFß1 induced pro-fibrotic signalling (Figure 2A-B) is translated into
excessive deposition of collagen in lung ECM, vehicle-treated and TGFß1 treated
hPCLS were similarly chemically fixed with 4% PFA on day 13 of ex vivo culture.
SHG imaging of whole slices was performed. However, high variability was observed
from the analysis within untreated or treated hPCLS as well across two conditions.
After careful observation, it became evident that this variability originates from fibrillar
collagen present in different structures of hPCLS (Supplementary Figure 3). Different
hPCLS have variable amounts SHG signal originating from the constituent fibrillar
collagen of blood vessel or airways and that of lung interstitium (Supplementary
Figure 3A). Therefore, to focus our analysis to interstitium of the hPCLS, we applied
a histological approach46 of image analysis where the 3D SHG image stacks of
hPCLS were divided into equally sized grids or regions of interest. Using a semiautomated FIJI based script, we manually excluded any grid that has SHG signal
originating from a blood vessel or an airway was excluded (purple Xs, Figure 3A)
from analysis, hence, only interstitium of the hPCLS was analysed. Furthermore, it
must be noted for analyzing fibrotic phenotype in interstitial lung diseases it is the
parenchymal interstitium47 which is affected, hence the need to analyze the
interstitium. This approach is further supported by our observation of increased SHG
signal of interstitium in IPF vs. healthy hPCLS (Figure 3B-C). This analysis shows
that there is a marginal increase in the deposition of fibrillar collagen upon TGFß1
stimulation but not statistically significant (Figure 3E).

fibrotic signal is induced, this induction might not be enough for conferring deposition
of fibrillar collagen in the ECM of this hPCLS ex vivo model.
Furthermore, studies have shown that the excessive deposition fibrillar collagen in
the ECM of fibrotic tissues is due to an imbalance of proteins involved in ECM
formation and degradation. A major component of this imbalance is that of abnormal
MMP activity in fibrotic tissues48. Furthermore, in murine models of PCLS, collagen
type I, III and elastin have been shown to have high turnover due to higher MMP
activity49. Han S. et al.50 has shown that pan inhibition of MMP activity using
Ilomastat (GM6001) enhances collagen fibril formation in human mesenchymal stem
cell in vitro culture. Encouraged by these observations, hPCLS were concomitantly
treated with Ilomastat and TGFß1 for two weeks. Subsequently, supernatants of
hPCLS (Vehicle, TGFß1 and TGFß1+GM6001) were collected and subjected to
ELISA measurements for PRO-C1 and FBN-C. Data show that concomitant
treatment of hPCLS with TGFß1 and Ilomastat significantly increases the levels of
both PRO-C1 and FBN-C in the media supernatants (Figure 4C) in comparison to
TGFß1 treatment alone. This observation can be attributed to reduced degradation
of these proteins due to MMP inhibition. It is important to note that Ilomastat
increased the levels of PRO-C1 approximately 3.5 times while as the effect on FBNC was moderate. Since, MMP inhibition resulted in an enhanced population of PROC1 available for deposition, we again analysed PFA fixed hPCLS on day 13 of ex
vivo culture (vehicle, TGFß1 and TGFß1+GM6001), The SHG analysis of these
hPCLS showed a significantly increased deposition of fibrillar collagen in the ECM
(Figure 4A-B), indicating that in the conditions here optimized for culturing hPCLS,
ECM deposition can be quantitatively measured by SHG. It should be noted that
hPCLS derived from two patients (magenta and yellow points Figure 4B) did not
show higher deposition upon concomitant treatment of TGFß1 and GM6001.

Discussion:
Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) affect functional alveolar units within the lung
parenchyma and are associated with high morbidity and mortality51. Animals studies
and evaluation of IPF patient lung biopsies, peripheral blood proteome and
bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) have shown that TGFß1 plays a significant role in
disease pathogenesis. Age52, smoking53 and MUC5 genetic variants12 are risk
factors identified for IPF. The impact of cellular ageing on the etiology of pulmonary
fibrosis, in particular, is difficult to study using rodent models and short time in vitro
fibroblast cultures54. hPCLS model has emerged as a putative model system with
high potential for recapitulating pathophysiological conditions close to that of human
physiology. However, a characterization of the inherent molecular changes that such
a system undergoes in ex vivo culture have not been reported to date.
In this study, we report for the first time proteomic and metabolomic changes of the
hPCLS culture over two of ex vivo culture. Importantly we report that markers of the
four major cell types are present after two weeks of ex vivo culture (Supplementary
Figure 01C). Wound healing response has 4 phases55, involving an inflammatory
phase of ECM degradation, and final proliferative ECM formation and remodeling
phase55. Cell type-specific markers data suggest a persistent ECM degradative
inflammatory phase present during the 2 weeks ex vivo culture. Indeed, we observe
that hPCLSs have high immune cell markers (Supplementary Figure 01C) therefore,
upregulated inflammatory pathways (Supplementary Figure 01B), sustained
upregulation of pathways related to ECM degradation (Supplementary Fig 01B),
downregulation of key structural ECM collagens (TableS2) and upregulation of
proteins involved in fibrillar collagen degradation (TableS1). Our proteomics data
also shows that hPCLSs are adapting to lack of serum in the culture media by
upregulating cholesterol biosynthesis56, a process vital for the viability of biological
membranes.
Interestingly, in contrast to the proteomic data, the metabolomic data of the hPCLS
showed minor changes after the initial adaptation period (4 days).
On the other hand, a persistent inflammatory process together with the presence of
other cell types such as epithelial, endothelial and immune cells, suggest a
possibility of transition of these cell types into myofibroblasts upon stimulation with
cytokines such as TGFß13, hence eliciting a physiologically relevant pro-fibrotic
response. Indeed, after treatment with TGFß1, ELISA measurements of soluble
biomarkers28 of fibrosis such as PRO-C1 and FBN-C1 showed a substantial
increase. Interestingly, repetitive stimulation resulted in sustained increased
production of PRO-C1 and Fibronectin (Figure 2A) over time, showing no response
attenuation to TGFß1. To get an in-depth knowledge of the nature of this pro-fibrotic
response, we carried out the proteomic analysis of ex vivo cultured hPCLS (day 13,
±TGFß1 treatment). Consistent with other studies10 the analysis showed
upregulation of many pro-fibrotic markers (Figure 2B) including pro-fibrotic fibrillar
collagens COLI, COLIII and COLV. On day 13 of hPCLS ex vivo culture, a total of
109 proteins were significantly upregulated. Strikingly, 64 out of 65 upregulated
proteins belong to mesenchymal cells and 40 out of 44 downregulated genes belong
to epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 1C). These data suggest that the pro11

fibrotic signal induced after TGFß1 treatment of hPCLS is due to epithelial to
mesenchymal transition3.
To further investigate the functional consequences of highly upregulated profibrotic
response we sought to measure the deposition of fibrillar collagen (tissue phenotypic
marker of fibrosis)3 in ECM of hPCLS. Other studies10,20 have made attempts to use
hPCLS for studying fibrotic signalling, however, a functional readout that confirms
excess extracellular matrix deposition has been lacking. Not only in this model
system but in other systems as well, only indirect readouts such as ELISA57 of procollagen peptides or hydroxyproline levels in serum have been used to infer on
fibrosis, e.g. in liver, kidney or lung58–60. In hPCLS model system, attempts have
been made to quantify the deposition of fibrillar collagen using
immunohistochemistry albeit qualitative20, therefore we applied label-free second
harmonic imaging to specifically quantify fibrillar collagen content present in the ECM
of hPCLS. A key advantage of label-free imaging is its ability to image deep into the
tissues and specifically measure fibrillar ECM deposited collagen. The SHG image
analysis of healthy and IPF derived hPCLS showed higher levels of fibrillar collagen
in IPF hPCLS (Figure 3B-C), showing the quantitative nature of the established
imaging workflow. Interestingly, upon SHG microscopy the increase in expression of
pro-fibrotic markers, in particular, COLI (PRO-C1-ELISA, COL1A2- mass spec) did
not result in a corresponding significant higher deposition in ECM of TGFß1
stimulated hPCLS (Figure 3E). Given hPCLS show upregulated expression of MMPs
(steady-state ex vivo culture, Table S1), we analysed the Log2FC levels of MMPs in
TGFß1 treated hPCLS proteomics (day 13). Indeed both MMP2 and MMP14 (MMPs
responsible for degradation of fibrillar collagens)24 show an upregulated expression
with Log2FC of 0.68 (fdr 0.16) and 0.52 (fdr 0.5) respectively. To enable the
deposition process of fibrillar collagens in hPCLS, we tested whether the process of
ECM degradation could be reduced by concomitantly treating the ex vivo cultured
hPCLS with TGFß1 and the MMP inhibitor GM6001, Indeed, the media supernatants
of hPCLS treated with TGFß1 and GM6001 have higher levels of PRO-C1 and
Fibronectin levels compared to just TGFß1 stimulation (Figure 4C). Pulmonary
fibrosis is essentially an ageing disorder61developing over several years and to
recapitulate the hallmark in 2 weeks of culture time represent a real challenge. Here
we show that concomitant treatment with TGFß1 and GM6001, could indeed enable
the measurement of fibrils deposition in this ex-vivo model system.
The observation that the expression of soluble markers does not correlate to the
deposition of fibrillar collagen in ECM further strengthens the need of an integrated
workflow to measure both soluble and ECM deposited fibrils.
Furthermore, our SHG data analysis has highlighted the variability of inherent fibrillar
collagen content in hPCLS (Supplementary Figure 03), showing the need for image
analysis of each hPCLS, where only the selected areas are quantified, excluding
SHG-confounding regions such as blood vessels and airways.
It should also be noted that not all patients respond equally to TGFß1+GM6001
(Figure 4B), there are hPCLS (donor-specific) that do not respond with
corresponding increase in ECM deposition (Fig 4B). The reasons for this selective
lack of deposition in certain hPCLS being donor-specific is hard to reason, however,
IPF lungs develop fibrotic foci62, rather than diffuse fibrosis, one explanation could be
that certain hPCLS are more predisposed for ECM deposition than others. These
fibrotic foci have been characterized well and Jones et al.,62 have made a significant
effort in this direction. Similar to this study, our analysis also focusses on interstitium
of lung parenchyma and could in future help to identify the progression and
development of such foci.

We propose that this method together with measurement of soluble markers such as
PRO-C1, FBN-C, C3M could enable the characterization of the dynamics of collagen
synthesis and degradation (the fractional synthesis) ex vivo upon fibrosis
progression.
Our study provides an integrated in-depth characterization of the here presented
hPCLS model system but it is important to note that there are additional points that
could be further investigated in future studies, for example, different culture
conditions such as microfluidic bioreactors or cell culture media composition.
Our current imaging set-up enables a deep view into the tissue and live imaging of
the fibrillar collagen dynamics would be the next frontier. Live SHG imaging can
quantify disease progression as well as regression upon therapeutic intervention. It
would be exciting to culture IPF derived hPCLS and use anti-fibrotic agents to
assess over time the effects on fibrillar collagen. Furthermore, recently, hPCLS and
non-human derived PCLS have also been subjected to siRNA knockdowns63 and
viral transductions64, indicating the amenability of this model also to genetic
manipulation for functional genomic studies.

Materials and methods:
Lung resection supply and licenses:
Tumour-free human lung tissue resections from lung cancer patients were obtained
from Thoraxklinik-Heidelberg with anonymized patient Ids. The patient consent and
use of tissue was obtained as per the research ethics committee (Medical Faculty of
University Heidelberg) approval reference number S-270/2001. Samples of ILD lung
tissue were obtained from patients undergoing lung transplant for end–stage disease
from Institute of Transplantation, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals. The patient
consent and use of ILD tissue was approved by national research ethics service
(11/NE/0291) and UK Health Research Authority. The human biological samples
were sourced ethically and their research use was in accord with the terms of the
informed consents under an IRB/EC approved protocol.
Precision-cut lung slice preparation and ex vivo culture:
Healthy and IPF hPCLS were prepared as described previously65. Briefly, on the day
when the tissue resection was received (day 0), lung tissue was inflated with 3% low
melting agarose (Sigma#A9414) prepared in phenol free DMEM (Gibco# 41965039). Next, 8 mm cores were prepared and 250 μm thick slices were generated
using a Krumdieck tissue slicer. Tissue media was supplemented with penicillin,
streptomycin, fungizone. The media (± stimulation) was replenished after every 72
hours till day 13. Cell culture grade plastic 24 well plates (Greiner#353226) were
used to culture hPCLS. On day 0 media was additionally supplemented with 10%
FCS (Gibco#10270106). The hPCLS were treated with 10ng/ml recombinant human
TGFß 1 protein (R&DSystems#240-B-010) and 25µM (in 750µl of DMEM) of
GM6001 (Merck#CC1010). Lived dead staining was carried out using calcein-am/
ethidium homodimer kit (ThermoFisher#L3224) as per supplier recommendations.
The hPCLS were incubated in recommended concentration of live/dead reagents for
45 minutes prior to live confocal microscopy. hPCLS were always cultured in

presence of penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco# 15140122) and amphotericin B
(Giboc#15290026).
ELISA measurements:
Soluble extracellular matrix fragments (PINP, FBN-C, C3M) were determined in the
media supernatant by competitive (ELISA) assays developed and validated by
Nordic Bioscience A/S (Herlev, Denmark). According to the manufacturer’s
instructions29 66 67. Values measured below the detection limit of the assay were
assigned the lower limit of detection (LLOD).
Mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis:
Proteomics:
Briefly, hPCLS were washed with PBS and harvested using snap freezing in liquid
Nitrogen. Upon thawing, samples (2 hPCLSs/technical replicate) were dissolved in
300μl of 2% SDS-H2O (with protease and phosphatase inhibitor) for 2 hours at room
temperature. Subsequently, mechanically homogenized using bead ruptor. Before
LC-MS/MS analysis, protein concentrations were measured (Pierce 660nm kit#
22660). Next samples were solubilized in 2 × SDS sample buffer and subjected to
short SDS gel electrophoresis. Samples were further processed for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
SDS PAGE gels were Coomassie stained. Gel lanes were cut into three slices
covering the entire separation range (∼2 cm) and subjected to in-gel tryptic
digestion68. Peptides were labeled via isobaric mass tags (TMT10, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA).TMT labeling was performed using the 10-plex TMT
reagents, enabling relative quantification of 10 conditions in a single experiment69.
Briefly, the labeling reaction was performed in 40 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate,
pH 8.53 at 22°C and quenched with glycine. Labeled peptide extracts were
combined to a single sample per experiment. Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 1.25% ammonia in water and subjected to LC-MS/MS69.
Peptide and protein identification & identification
Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) was used for protein identification by using
a 10 parts per million mass tolerance for peptide precursors and 20 mD (HCD) mass
tolerance for fragment ions. The search database consisted of a customized version
of the International Protein Index protein sequence database combined with a decoy
version of this database created by using scripts supplied by MatrixScience.
Reporter ion intensities were read from raw data and multiplied with ion
accumulation times (the unit is milliseconds) so as to yield a measure proportional to
the number of ions; this measure is referred to as ion area 70. Spectra matching to
peptides were filtered according to the following criteria: mascot ion score > 15,
signal-to-background of the precursor ion > 4, and signal-to-interference > 0.5 70.
Fold changes were corrected for isotope purity as described and adjusted for
interference caused by co-eluting nearly isobaric peaks as estimated by the signalto-interference measure 70. Protein quantification was derived from individual spectra
matching to distinct peptides by using a sum-based bootstrap algorithm; 95%
confidence intervals were calculated for all protein fold changes that were quantified
with more than three spectra 70.
Metabolomics:
hPCLSs were snap-frozen on the day of harvest. On the day of sample preparation,
2hPCLS/ technical replicate were shortly rinsed in 75mM Ammonium bicarbonate
(pH 7.4) and mechanically homogenised in MS grade H2O to extract metabolites.
Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed as described71. Briefly, samples
were analyzed on a LC/MS platform consisting of a Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000

liquid chromatography system with autosampler temperature set to 10° C coupled to
a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Plus Fourier transform mass spectrometer equipped
with a heated electrospray ion source and operated in negative ionization mode. The
isocratic flow rate was 150 μL/min of mobile phase consisting of 60:40% (v/v)
isopropanol: water buffered with 1 mM ammonium fluoride at pH 9 and containing 10
nM taurocholic acid and 20 nM homotaurine as lock masses. Mass spectra were
recorded in profile mode from 50 to 1,000 m/z with the following instrument settings:
sheath gas, 35 a.u.; aux gas, 10 a.u.; aux gas heater, 200° C; sweep gas, 1 a.u.;
spray voltage, -3 kV; capillary temperature, 250° C; S-lens RF level, 50 a.u;
resolution, 70k @ 200 m/z; AGC target, 3x106 ions, max. inject time, 120 ms;
acquisition duration, 60 s. Spectral data processing was performed using an
automated pipeline in R as described previously71. Detected ions were tentatively
annotated as metabolites based on matching accurate mass within a tolerance of 5
mDa using the Human Metabolome database72.
Data analysis:
Proteomics: The R programming language (ISBN 3-900051-07-0) was employed to
process the proteins output files of IsobarQuant. Only proteins which were quantified
with at least two unique peptides and which were quantified in all experiments were
used for further analysis. The “sumionarea_protein” columns were annotated to
different experimental conditions. Then, potential batch-effects were removed using
the limma package73 and the results were normalized using the vsn package74.
Limma was also used to test for differential expression of proteins. A protein was
considered significant with a 2-fold difference and a false discovery rate below 5 %.
All significant proteins were clustered (hierarchical clustering – ward.d2 method)
based on their Euclidean distances of log2 ratios towards the respective control.
Network analysis using Cytoscape:
Network analysis was carried out open source software platform Cytoscape75 was
used. Briefly, genes that were significantly regulated (log2fc ≥ 0.58 or ≤ and adjusted
p-value ≤0.05) were curated and subjected to pathway analysis. The graphs were
plotted using an in-house R script.
Second Harmonic generation imaging and sample preparation:
On the day of harvest, the media supernatant was aspirated from each well
containing hPCLS. hPCLS were washed with PBS (3X 1ml) and fixed in 1 ml of 4%
PFA (EMS EM grade#5710) overnight at 4ºC. Subsequently, hPCLS were washed
with PBS (3X). Next, each PFA fixed hPCLS was transferred to 24 well plate with
glass bottom (Greiner senso#662892). hPCLS were covered with 150µl of PBS and
pressed to the bottom using a circular glass cover slip and plastic ring (made locally
at EMBL workshop). Next, each well was further covered with 300µl of PBS to avoid
drying of hPCLS (due to evaporation of PBS in the process of image acquisition).
SHG imaging of hPCLS was performed on Zeiss NLO LSM780 microscope equipped
with a pulsed multiphoton laser. hPCLS were excited with 2-photon wavelength of
880nm with a 20X (0.8 NA, air objective). 150-180µm deep z-stacks were acquired
with a square tiled (7-8 x 7-8mm) scan. 2-photon excited signals originating from
hPCLS were captured in 3 different channels backward SHG, forward SHG and 2photon excited autofluorescence (2PEA). Forward SHG signal was captured using a
laser blocking filter and a band pass filter 436/20 nm. The backward SHG signal was

recorded using internal detectors in band width of 435-455 nm. 2PEA was detected
in a bandwidth of 550-650 nm

SHG image analysis:
Image analysis of z-stacks consisting of SHG channels (backward and forward) and
2PEA were analysed using a semi-automated Jython based FIJI pipeline. Pipeline is
available as supplementary document as well and is free for usage. Briefly, all the
channels were thresholded, the area or the number of pixels under the threshold
were counted for each channels (PBT), integrated intensity of PBT was also
calculated for each channel (Sumintensity). To measure the total fibrillar collagen
content, Sumintensity of PBT of backward and forward SHG signal were summed up
to termed as total fibrillar collagen content. A projection of sumSHG (2D) image was
created as well and this image was divided into 8x8 equally sized ROIs. And each
ROI was manually classified as interstitial collagen or Non-interstitial collagen. Only
ROIs of interstitial collagen were averaged per hPCLS SHG image. Each experiment
has untreated & treated hPCLS SHG images. Sumintensity of total collagen content
pixels/ ROI was normalized to the average SHG signal in untreated (average of all
the ROIs) hPCLS of the respective donor. For each hPCLS SHG stack a minimum of
20 ROIs were analysed.
FIJI code for interstitial and nor-interstitial ROI selection:
