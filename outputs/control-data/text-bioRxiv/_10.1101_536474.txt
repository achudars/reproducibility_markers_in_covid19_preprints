Abstract
Temperament profiles of an individual with high novelty seeking and low harm avoidance have
been reported to be related to substance addiction, but smartphone addiction could be different
from substance addiction. Medical students have high exposure to smartphone use. Screening
their risk of smartphone addiction based on the temperament profile may help in deciding best
prevention approach. This research aimed to examine the temperament profile and its association
with vulnerability to smartphone addiction of medical students in Jakarta, Indonesia. The
research was conducted with cross sectional design and simple random sampling. The
Temperament and Character Inventory and the Smartphone Addiction Scale were used to
measure desired outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the
relationship between demographic factors, pattern of smartphone use, temperament type, and
vulnerability to smartphone addiction. Of the 185 samples, most subjects have low novelty
seeking, high reward dependence, and high harm avoidance. The average smartphone usage in a
day was 7.94 hours (SD 3.92) with the initial age of smartphone usage was 7.58 years (SD 2.43).
The respondents used smartphone for communication and accessing social media. High harm
avoidance temperament was significantly associated with risk of smartphone addiction with OR
2.035; 95% CI 1.119 to 3.701). This study shows that smartphone addiction has similarities with
other behavior addictions. Harm avoidance temperament is associated with the risk of
smartphone addiction. Screening on risk of smartphone addiction based on temperament type
should be done on medical students.
Keywords: risk factors, smartphone addiction, temperament, young adult

Introduction
Smartphones, mobile phones that provide integrated communication and computation
services, play an important role in people’s lives worldwide (1,2). According to a study by Pew
Research Center, smartphone ownership strongly correlates with internet connectivity (3). The
numbers of smartphone owner and internet user have increased drastically in the last couple of
years. In developing countries, smartphone ownership has climbed from 21% in 2013 to 37% in
2015 (3). Approximately 21% of Indonesians own a smartphone in 2015 (3). Smartphone owners
in Indonesia are more likely to be 18 to 34 years old, highly-educated, and have high income (3).
The most popular activities on the smartphone are social networking through sites such as
Facebook®, Twitter®, dan Path® (3).
The high number of smartphone ownership raises questions about its risks. In general,
smartphone use is associated with motor vehicle accidents, academic problems, and health issues
(4). More frequent use of smartphone increases the prevalence of sleep disorders, depression, and
anxiety (5). Smartphone overuse will have a significant impact.
In a more severe condition, smartphone use can cause dependence or addiction. A study
reports that 46% of smartphone users feel that they cannot live without smartphones (3). Another
study found that, on average, university students checks their phones 60 times a day, with more
than 4 hours of regular use. This fear of separation from smartphone has been termed
nomophobia (6). When separation occurs, withdrawal-like restlessness and physiological
symptoms emerge. Some report that they heard their phones ring or vibrate, when they actually
do not. This phenomenon is not the same as compensation, as its objective is neither escape from
problems or responsibilities, nor avoidance of negative emotion. Considering these aspects, when
a person becomes addicted to smartphones, the symptoms of addiction and withdrawal can cause
impairment in that person’s life.
Early detection is the first step in mitigating the consequences of smartphone addiction
and should take individual risk factors into consideration. Temperament is one of such risk
factors. Currently, there is no study exploring the association between temperament profile and
smartphone addiction. Temperament is the emotional pattern of an individual, free from the
influence of values and norms, and is associated with specific systems in the brain that regulates

negative emotion and behavior. Cloninger divides temperament into three groups: novelty
seeking (NS), reward dependence (RD), and harm avoidance (HA) (7). The temperament profile
is important in understanding the reason behind someone’s thought, perception, and behavior.
Ko et al. has conducted a study of temperament in behavioral addiction (8). They found that
people with internet addiction has high NS, low RD, and high HA. However, such study has
never been done on those with smartphone addiction. Therefore, further research is needed
because risk factors for internet addiction may not apply in smartphone addiction.
According to Eley et al., Australian medical students tend to have high HA, similar to
those with internet addiction (9,10). This is quite concerning if medical students in Jakarta have
similar temperament profile, as students are required to keep up to date on medical information
and they rely on convenient devices such as smartphones and other gadgets (11). Additionally,
medical students are a group with long study period and high expectations (12). Smartphones
that were initially used for academic purposes later become an escape. If this is neglected, there
will be consequences on academic achievement, daily life, and their future (13). Before the
students become addicted to smartphones, prevention must be done, for example, through
screening, but screening is not feasible to be conducted on all students. Screening their risk of
smartphone addiction based on the temperament profile may help in deciding appropriate
approach in preventing or managing the condition. This study aims to identify the temperament
profile of medical students in Jakarta and its association to vulnerability to smartphone addiction.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional study, conducted in several medical faculties in Jakarta. Data
collection was performed from January to April 2018.

Participants
The sample for this study was all preclinical medical students in Jakarta who fulfil the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sample selection was done by simple random sampling,
randomized using the software for analysis.

aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

The inclusion criteria are those who were preclinical medical students in the fifth
semester, had completely filled out demographic form and both questionnaires, and had agreed
to be a respondent by signing the informed consent. Subject was excluded if he/she was not
fluent in Indonesia Language.

Measurements
Modified SAS Indonesian version
Vulnerability to smartphone addiction was measured using SAS, a self-report scale. This
instrument has 33 questions with a likert-scale response of 1 to 6. There are 6 subscales:
cyberspace-oriented relationship, daily life disruption, primary needs, overuse, positive
anticipation, and withdrawal (14). Cronbach’s alpha score for the whole scale is 0.967. This
instrument is valid, as compared to similar instruments. SAS has been validated into Indonesian
(15). SAS Indonesian version was modified into 21 questions with item-total correlation of 0.282
to 0.802 and Cronbach’s alpha of 0.890. SAS produces a numerical score, with a higher score
signifying a higher vulnerability to smartphone addiction.

Modified TCI Indonesian version
To identify a patient’s temperament type, modified TCI Indonesian version was used
(16). This self-report instrument has 23 questions on temperament (9 items on novelty seeking, 6
on reward dependence, and 8 on harm avoidance) and 16 questions on character (10 items on
self-directedness and 6 on self-transcendence). This study utilized only the questions on
temperament.
Temperament is measured using 23 items answered either ‘yes’ (2 points) or ‘no’ (1
point) according to respondent’s view of themselves. There is an answer key for the items. The
output of this instrument is the sum of each temperament group. Higher score on each item
means higher scores on harm avoidance, novelty seeking, and reward dependence. The low and
high cut-off point for each group is determined by the average of all subjects.

Ethical approval
This study was cleared by the local Ethics Committee. Study subjects were asked to sign
informed consent.

Statistical Analysis
Data was collected and then analyzed statistically. Data was processed using Statistical
Analysis Software Package for Windows (SPSS®, IBM, USA) version 25. Demographic factors
were summarized into proportion for nominal variables, mean and standard deviation for
numeric variables. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship
between demographic factors, pattern of smartphone use, temperament type, and vulnerability to
smartphone addiction.

Results
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 medical students in three medical
faculties on their fourth or fifth semester. Only 258 forms fulfilled the study criteria. Sample was
then randomly selected to obtain 185 samples.

Demographic Characteristics of Study Subjects
The mean age of study subjects is 20.39 years (standard deviation 1.14). Most are
females (66.5%) and none have married (Table 1).

Logistic regression of SAS score with pattern of smartphone use and
temperament
The mean total SAS score of all study subjects is 77.90 (SD 11.73). About 51% of
students have above average SAS score. Multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression
with three statistically-significant variables: 6 hours or more of smartphone use per day, using
smartphone for entertainment, and high HA score (Table 5). Hosmer and Lemeshow test showed
that this model is acceptable with p value of 0.722.
Through this multivariate model, high HA score is found to be statistically significant
(OR 2.035; 95% CI 1.119 to 3.701), while the other two variables are considered as confounding
factors: duration of daily smartphone use (OR 1.804; 95% CI 0.948 to 3.431) and using
smartphone for entertainment (OR 2.713; 95% CI 0.820 to 8.,977).

Discussion
This study is the first to report the temperament profile of young adults and relate it with
the risk of smartphone addiction. Besides temperament profile, this study also explored other
factors such as age, marital status, gender, duration of use, and age at first smartphone use.
Mean duration of smartphone use in this study, 7 hours per day, is higher than other
studies. Others have reported a mean daily duration of 3.7 hours (17), or less than 1 hour each
day (18). This difference may be accounted for by the difference in sample characteristics. Lin et
al. studied engineering students who generally use smartphone less than medical students (17). In
the Cho and Lee study, the sample was children who are still under their parent’s supervision
(18). This study did not detect a relationship between duration of use and risk of smartphone
addiction. However, other studies found such relationship (19,20). One of the diagnostic criteria
of addiction is tolerance. A person with addiction will spend more time using smartphones to get
the satisfaction.
Younger exposure is also an important factor in the development of addiction. The age at
first smartphone use in this study is relatively early, 13 years. Ching et al. proposed that younger
age at first use is related to higher risk of addiction (21). Teens are considered vulnerable to
addiction as their prefrontal cortex has not matured yet, so they cannot adequately judge the
cause and effect of their actions (22,23). A trans-generational study of Zhitomirsky-Geffet and
Blau showed that if mobile phone exposure started at teenage years, addiction is easier to happen
because their personality is still easily influenced (24).
Activities done using smartphone is quite variable. As a basic need, smartphone is used
as a communication device, for calls or short text messages, but nowadays more people use their
phones to access social media, browse for information (including shopping), and play games for
a long period of time (25). Use of smartphone has shifted from communication to entertainment
(26,27).
The search for entertainment is an important theme as it reflects a person’s coping
mechanism (28,29). This is supported by Nayak, who proposed that smartphone use in students
is related to a wish for escape from reality, even just temporarily (30). Such avoidant coping is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/536474; this version posted January 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

often associated with health problems and depression (31). Not only with psychopathology,
coping mechanism is related to temperament. The temperament most closely related to avoidant
pattern is high harm avoidance (32).
The subjects of this study is homogenous because they come from the same stage of their
medical studies. Eley et al. found that medical students are a relatively homogenous group in
many aspects, such as age of early 20’s, good educational background, and upper-middle
socioeconomic class (9). This study also found other similar characteristics: sex and marital
status. This similarity may influence other results such as temperament type and type of
smartphone activity.
More study samples are female. They also have a tendency toward HA. Similar to
previous studies, temperament is related to gender. Higher HA in female is caused by difference
in monoamine system and hormonal composition. With high HA, female has a more active
serotonin and noradrenaline components, as well as estrogen that is more sensitive to the HPA
axis, making females more vulnerable to anxiety (33). Additionally, female are faster to develop
more mature socialization skills compared to male (7).
Female’s tendency to socialize more concurs with the findings of this study: compared to
male, females are more likely to use smartphones for social media. Other studies explained
females’ use of smartphones for social media by their needs to have wider and deeper
relationships, compared to males who tend to only have wider relations (1,11). Through
smartphones, females with high HA can socialize more conveniently.
Males use smartphones for online and offline games in this study. Compared to female,
male are more likely to be active playing games as they have a more task-oriented motivation
(34). Majority of games have this element so they become more interesting for males.
Furthermore, games can also become a way to channel males’ aggression (27). Eastern societies,
especially Asians, have a higher mean HA scores compared to Americans and Europeans (35).
Aggresion tends to be channeled into non-threatening activities, such as games (36), because
Asian communities are less individualistic and more communal (35). Besides culture, channeling
of aggression in cyberspace is associated with biological factors (brain stucture, hormones,
neurotransmitter) that influences social cognition. Smartphone use for social media and games is

a good thing up to a certain point, as overuse is associated with avoidant coping, as discussed
previously.
Most samples in this study have high HA. Besides gender, this temperament profile can
be explained by the sample’s origins in medical faculties. Eley et al. found similar findings in
two studies of medical students in Australia: low NS, high RD, and high HA (10). Lee et al.
concluded that with high HA, combined with high CO and SD, medical students can develop
into independent, reliable, warm, empathic, and friendly doctors (12). However, this type of
individuals is also vulnerable to burnout, anxiety, and depression (9,10,37).
In this study, someone with high HA is almost two times more vulnerable to high risk of
smartphone addiction. This finding is similar to other studies in internet addiction (38–40). A
person with high HA is more likely to be addicted to smartphones compared to students with
high NS. This can be explained by the low persistence in NS, making the individual easier to be
bored and impulsively shift to other activities.
Duration of smartphone use, 6 hours or more, is not significantly associated, but this
variable is a confounding factor and is very important in making a person vulnerable to
smartphone addiction. Other studies have also found the relationship between duration of
smartphone use and smartphone addiction (13,19,41). This duration also shows a person’s
persistence and priorities, as well as the impairment in daily life that may occur. Consequently,
change of self priorities is one of the diagnostic criteria of addiction, in DSM 5 and ICD-11
(42,43).
Smartphone use for entertainment show a positive relationship with vulnerability to
smartphone addiction. Two studies found a significant relationship between smartphone use for
entertainment and smartphone addiction (13,44). Boumosleh and Jaalouk explained that the
search for entertainment through smartphones is related to a negative coping mechanism when
dealing with depression and anxiety (13). The more frequently a person uses this coping
mechanism, the more frequent the use of smartphone for entertainment. The assumption is that
this longer duration of use will raise the risk of smartphone addiction, like a vicious cycle;
however, this is not studied in this research, requiring further studies.
In general, this study shows that smartphone addiction has similarities with other
behavior addictions, such as pathological gambling, internet addiction, and online game

addiction (45). Even though not all factors contributing to smartphone addiction are studied, this
study shows that there are other factors that may play a role in the vulnerability to smartphone
addiction, such as education, social, and personal factors (1,38,40,46).
There are several limitations to this study. First, this study is conducted on only a small
proportion of medical students in Jakarta and did not compare between them and non-medical
sample, limiting the generalizability of the results. Second, this study did not take into account
the types of application used through smartphones, when there is, in fact, some multifunctional
application. Additionally, the type of game is not specified, whether online or offline, action,
adventure, role play, or puzzles. If the type of application and games are known, further studies
can be more specific. Third, there is no consensus on the cutoff score for SAS, so the
classification into high and low risk is unclear. Replication of this study with different cutoff will
yield different results. Fourth, this study is focused on temperament as a risk factor of
smartphone addiction. There are other factors that influence both temperament and smartphone
addiction that have not been explored, such as genetics, parenting, character, self-regulation,
self-image, comorbidities with other mental disorders, and peer pressure. The impacts of
smartphone use in the individual level was not included in this study either.
This study concludes that HA temperament is associated with the risk of smartphone
addiction. The higher one's tendency for HA, the higher the risk of smartphone addiction.
Screening on risk of smartphone addiction based on temperament type should be done on
medical students. Exposure to behavioral addiction knowledge could be done as early as possible
in the medical study as one of the prevention measures of addiction. Further research needs to be
conducted on other biological, psychological, and social factors that can also affect a person's
vulnerability to smartphone addiction. Assessment of psychopathology factors on the subject as
one of the factors influencing smartphone addiction.
