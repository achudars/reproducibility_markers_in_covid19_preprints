Abstract:
Background and Purpose: Smoothened (SMO) is a GPCR that mediates hedgehog
signaling. Hedgehog binds the Patched, which in turn regulates SMO activation.
Overactive SMO signaling is oncogenic and is therefore a clinically established drug
target. Here, we establish a nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy
transfer (NanoBRET)-based ligand binding assay for SMO providing a sensitive and
high throughput-compatible addition to the toolbox of GPCR pharmacologists.
Experimental Approach: In the NanoBRET-based binding assay, SMO is N terminally
tagged with nanoluciferase (Nluc) and binding of BODIPY-cyclopamine is assessed
by quantifying resonance energy transfer between receptor and ligand. The assay
allows kinetic analysis of ligand-receptor binding in living HEK293 cells and
competition binding experiments using commercially available SMO ligands (SANT-1,
cyclopamine-KAAD, SAG1.3 and purmorphamine).
Key Results: The NanoBRET binding assay for SMO is sensitive and superior to
purely fluorescence-based binding assays. BODIPY-cyclopamine showed complex
binding parameters suggesting separate binding sites.
Conclusions and Implications: The NanoBRET ligand binding assay for SMO
provides a fast, sensitive and reliable alternative to assess SMO ligand binding.
Furthermore, this assay is sufficiently sensitive to dissect a SANT-1-sensitive and a
SANT-1-insensitive cyclopamine binding site in the 7TM core, and will be important to
further dissect and understand the molecular pharmacology of Class F receptors.

What is already known: Cyclopamine targets SMO as antagonist and fluorescentlylabelled cyclopamine has been used for fluorescence-based binding assays for SMO.
Structural analysis has suggested two binding sites on SMO, one in the receptor core
and one the CRD.
What this study adds: We established a NanoBRET-based binding assay for SMO
with superior sensitivity compared to fluorescence-based assays. This assay allows
distinction of two separate binding sites for BODIPY-cyclopamine on SMO in live
cells in real time.
What is the clinical significance: The assay is a valuable complement for drug
discovery efforts and will support a better understanding of Class F GPCR
pharmacology.

1. INTRODUCTION
Smoothened (SMO) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which, alongside ten
paralogues of Frizzleds (FZDs), forms the Class F of GPCRs (Schulte, 2010). SMO
signaling is of utmost importance during embryonic patterning and development, and
dysfunction of SMO signaling is causative in the development of diverse tumors
including

basal

cell

carcinoma

(Ingham

&

McMahon,

2001).

Therefore,

pharmacological targeting of SMO and SMO signaling evolved as an attractive
antitumor treatment strategy established in clinical practice (Wu, Zhang, Sun,
McMahon & Wang, 2017). On a structural level, this seven transmembrane domain
spanning receptor is characterized by a large, extracellular cysteine-rich domain
(CRD) and a long C-terminal domain (Schulte, 2010). While SMO is essential for
transmitting transcriptional responses via heterotrimeric G proteins and Gliomaassociated oncogene (Gli) signaling induced by hedgehog proteins (three
mammalian homologues: Desert, Indian and Sonic hedgehog), the nature and mode
of action of the endogenous ligand and the mechanisms of receptor activation are not
fully understood (Byrne et al., 2016; Schulte & Kozielewicz, 2019). It is known that
hedgehog proteins bind Patched, a cholesterol transporter, which in turn regulates
SMO activation by postulated regulation of cholesterol levels (Zhang et al., 2018).
Cholesterol and other naturally occurring sterols are positive allosteric modulators
and agonists of SMO in Gli- and G protein-dependent signaling (Nachtergaele et al.,
2012; Qi, Liu, Thompson, McDonald, Zhang & Li, 2019; Raleigh et al., 2018; Sever et
al., 2016). Due to the distinct link to human cancer and occurrence of several cancerassociated SMO mutations (e.g. D473H6.54 or W535L7.55; superscript numbering
refers to Ballesteros Weinstein nomenclature of GPCRs (Ballesteros & Weinstein,
1995)), a plethora of small ligands – antagonists and inverse agonists – have been

developed to target this receptor (Wu, Zhang, Sun, McMahon & Wang, 2017). Two of
these compounds – vismodegib and sonidegib - are approved as drugs for the
treatment of basal-cell carcinoma (Chen, 2016). In addition, nature provides an
effective SMO antagonist, the plant alkaloid cyclopamine (Incardona, Gaffield, Kapur
& Roelink, 1998; Taipale et al., 2000).
These and other ligands, such as SMO agonists (e. g. SAG1.3, purmorphamine),
neutral antagonists (e. g. cyclopamine, SANT-1) or inverse agonists (e. g.
cyclopamine-KAAD), are frequently used to explore SMO pharmacology (Chen,
2016; Chen, Taipale, Young, Maiti & Beachy, 2002; Rominger et al., 2009). To date,
binding affinities of these compounds were determined using classical radioligand
binding methods (Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002; Rominger et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2014) and, more often, fluorescence-based assays using for example the greenyellow fluorescent BODIPY-cyclopamine (Chen, Taipale, Cooper & Beachy, 2002;
Chen, Taipale, Young, Maiti & Beachy, 2002; Gorojankina et al., 2013; Huang et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2018; Manetti et al., 2010). The fluorescently-labelled
cyclopamine has been used in three separate experimental approaches: assessment
of ligand-receptor interaction based on detection of fluorescence using confocal
microscopy, flow cytometry or fluorescence polarization (Bee et al., 2012; Chen,
Taipale, Cooper & Beachy, 2002; Chen, Taipale, Young, Maiti & Beachy, 2002;
Gorojankina et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). While these
methods offer valuable insight into ligand-receptor binding in live cells, they suffer
from several shortcomings, including: 1) laborious protocols that require long ligand
incubation times (up to 4-5 hours), 2) extensive cell washing due to lipophilicity of
BODIPY-cyclopamine, 3) high levels of non-specific binding in untransfected cells or
in the presence of saturating concentrations of unlabeled competitors and 4) the

need for data normalization of BODIPY-fluorescence values to receptor expression
values.
In order to overcome these experimental limitations, we established and validated a
live-cell, nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET)based binding assay to assess the binding properties of BODIPY-cyclopamine and
unlabeled SMO ligands to an N-terminally Nanoluciferase (Nluc)-tagged SMO and
CRD SMO in HEK293 cells devoid of endogenous SMO. This proximity-based
ligand-binding assay has recently been developed to assess ligand binding to Class
A GPCRs and receptor tyrosine kinases (Bosma et al., 2019; Bouzo-Lorenzo et al.,
2019; Mocking, Verweij, Vischer & Leurs, 2018; Stoddart et al., 2015; Stoddart,
Kilpatrick & Hill, 2018; Stoddart et al., 2018; Sykes, Stoddart, Kilpatrick & Hill, 2019).
It relies on the high specificity of BRET between Nluc-tagged protein (BRET donor)
and fluorescently-tagged ligand (BRET acceptor) that can only occur when both
BRET partners are within a distance of 10 nm (100 Å). Thus, the interference of nonspecifically bound probe, outside of the BRET radius to the receptor is – in contrast to
detecting solely ligand fluorescence – minimal. In the present study, we employ
NanoBRET to monitor binding of commercially available SMO ligands. Furthermore,
the sensitivity of the assay enables us to dissect the pharmacological properties of
separate cyclopamine binding sites in the transmembrane-spanning receptor core of
the Class F receptor SMO. Thus, this NanoBRET-based binding assay provides a
valuable complement to the toolbox of high-throughput compatible screening assays
for Class F GPCRs.

2.2 Live-cell ELISA
For quantification of cell surface receptor expression by labelling with anti-Nluc
antibody, SMO HEK293 cells at the density of 4·105 cells ml-1 were transfected in
suspension using Lipofectamine 2000 with 50-500 ng of the indicated receptor
plasmid DNA with 500-950 ng of pcDNA plasmid DNA. The cells (100 µl) were
seeded onto a PDL-coated transparent 96-well plate with flat bottom and grown
overnight. 24 hr later the cells were washed twice with 0.5% BSA in PBS and
incubated with a rabbit anti-Nluc (2 µg·ml-1; RnD Systems #MAB10026) in 1%
BSA/PBS for 1 hr at 4°C. Following incubation, the cells were washed four times with
0.5% BSA/PBS and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit antibody (1:3,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific #31460) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hr at
4°C. The cells were washed three times with 0.5% BSA/PBS, and 50 µl of the
peroxidase substrate TMB (3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine; Sigma-Aldrich #T8665)
were added. The cells were further incubated for 20 minutes and upon development
of a blue product, 50 µl of 2 M HCl were added and the absorbance was read at 450
nm using a BMG  POLARstar plate reader. The data were analyzed in GraphPad

2.3 Immunoblotting
SMO HEK293 cells were transfected in suspension using Lipofectamine 2000 (50500 of receptor plasmid DNA with 500-950 ng of pcDNA plasmid DNA per 4·105 cells
ml-1) and seeded (700 µl) onto wells of a 24-well plate. Protein lysates were obtained
using Laemmli buffer with 0.5% NP-40 and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were
sonicated and analyzed on 4–20 % Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast polyacrylamide gels
(Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot Turbo system
(Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% milk in TBS-T, membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies in blocking buffer: rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:5000; Cell Signaling
Technology #2118) and mouse anti-Nluc (0.5 µg·ml-1; RnD Systems #MAB10026),
overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:5,000; goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #31460 or
1:3,000; goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific #31430) and Clarity Western ECL
Blotting Substrate (Bio-Rad).
2.4 NanoBRET binding assay
SMO HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in suspension using Lipofectamine
2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4·105 cells ml-1 were transfected with 50-500 ng of
receptor plasmid DNA and 500-950 ng of pcDNA. The cells (100 µl) were seeded
onto a PDL-coated black 96-well cell culture plate with solid flat bottom (Greiner BioOne). 24 hr post-transfection, cells were washed once with HBSS (HyClone) and
maintained in the same buffer. In the saturation experiments, the cells were
incubated with different concentrations of BODIPY-cyclopamine (80 µl) for 60 min at
37°C before the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine h (5 µM final
concentration, 10 µl) for 6 min prior to the BRET measurement. In the competition

experiments, the cells were pre-incubated with different concentrations of unlabeled
ligands (70 µl) for 30 min at 37°C. Fixed concentration of BODIPY-cyclopamine was
then added (10 µl) and the cells were incubated for additional 60 min at 37°C before
the addition of the luciferase substrate colenterazine h (5 µM final concentration, 10
µl) for 6 min prior to the BRET measurement. In the association experiments, the
cells were pre-incubated with 10 µM SANT-1 (30 minutes), followed by colenterazine
h (5 µM final concentration) at 37°C prior to the addition of different BODIPYcyclopamine concentrations. The BRET signal was measured every minute for 90
min at 37°C. The BRET ratio was determined as the ratio of light emitted by BODIPYcyclopamine (energy acceptor) and light emitted by Nluc-tagged biosensors (energy
donors). The BRET acceptor (bandpass filter 535–30 nm) and BRET donor
(bandpass filter 475–30 nm) emission signals were measured using a CLARIOstar
microplate reader (BMG). BRET ratio was calculated as the difference in BRET ratio
of cells treated with ligands and cells treated with vehicle. BODIPY fluorescence was
measured prior to reading luminescence (excitation: 477–14 nm, emission: 525–30
nm). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.

2.5 Data and statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 and represent mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD) of n independent experiments (biological

extra-sum-of square F-test (p<0.05).
Competition binding curves were analyzed using a one-site binding model in order to
obtain equilibrium dissociation constants values (Ki) of unlabeled ligands as per the
Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng & Prusoff, 1973):

𝐾𝑖 =

In the equation: Ki is the searched dissociation constant of an unlabeled ligand, IC50 is
the inhibitory constant 50 of an unlabeled ligand obtained from the competition curve,
[LL] is the concentration of a labelled ligand used in the competition experiment and
Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of a labelled ligand obtained from the
saturation studies.
To analyze the labelled ligand binding kinetics data, one-phase association or twophase association models were selected based on an extra-sum-of square F-test:
One-phase association:
𝑌 = 𝑌0 + (𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑢 − 𝑌0 ) ∗ (1 − 𝑒 (−𝑘𝑜𝑏𝑠 ∗𝑥) )
Two-phase association:

3. RESULTS
N-terminally Nluc tagged SMO constructs are expressed at the cell surface
In order to establish a NanoBRET-based binding assay for the Class F receptor
SMO, we adopted the cloning strategy of previously presented Class A GPCR
including a 5-HT3A receptor-derived signal sequence and an extracellular, Nterminally Nluc fused to either the full length mouse SMO or SMO lacking the
extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Subsequently, these constructs are
referred to as Nluc-SMO and CRD Nluc-SMO, respectively (Fig. 1a). Both receptor
constructs are expressed in the cells and at the cell surface upon transient
transfection of SMO HEK293 cells as shown by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates
and a live-cell surface ELISA (Fig. 1a, b).

BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to Nluc-SMO can be monitored by NanoBRET
The commercially available, BODIPY-labelled derivative of the plant alkaloid
cyclopamine (BODIPY-cyclopamine; Fig. 2a) associates with Nluc-SMO transiently
expressed in SMO HEK293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner reaching
saturation at ~1000 nM (one-site fit Kd = 170.9 ± 26.6 nM, Fig. 2b, c). Similarly,
BODIPY-cyclopamine binds the SMO construct lacking the CRD (two-sites fit Kd1 =
4.0 ± 0.9 nM, Fig. 2d,e). The BODIPY-cyclopamine bound CRD Nluc-SMO with
higher affinity and importantly the NanoBRET produced by BODIPY-cyclopamine
binding was larger in the CRD Nluc-SMO compared to Nluc-SMO (two-sites fit
BRET Bmax1 CRD receptor = 0.08 ± 0.01 and one-site fit BRET Bmax full-length
receptor = 0.034 ± 0.001). Furthermore, BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to CRD

Nluc-SMO was more complex than binding to Nluc-SMO as indicated by the
multiphasic binding curve for CRD Nluc-SMO especially at higher concentrations of
the ligand (two-sites fit Kd2 = 371.3 ± 266.1 nM) . While quantification of BODIPYcyclopamine binding on living cells was assessed 60 min after ligand addition, we
were also interested in the binding kinetics of BODIPY-cyclopamine. Therefore, we
followed BODIPY-cyclopamine association at different ligand concentrations using
Nluc-SMO and CRD Nluc-SMO expressing SMO HEK293 cells (Fig. 3a,b). First,
the kinetic analysis confirmed that saturation was reached at 60 min ligand exposure
as used for experiments presented in Fig. 2. In agreement with our observations from
saturation experiments, the kinetic binding analysis underlined that the affinity of
BODIPY-cyclopamine to the CRD Nluc-SMO was higher and BRET counts were
larger compared to Nluc-SMO. Reflecting the different parameters of the BODIPYcyclopamine binding to the two different SMO constructs, we used 100, 200, 1000
nM ligand for Nluc-SMO binding kinetics and 10, 100, 1000 nM for CRD Nluc-SMO.
Moreover, the analysis also showed a substantial difference in t1/2 of BODIPYcyclopamine at both receptors (Table 1 and 2). In order to further dissect BODIPYcyclopamine association to SMO we employed the SMO antagonist SANT-1 at 10
µM, which interacts with the 7TM core of the receptor (Chen, Taipale, Young, Maiti &
Beachy, 2002). For both receptor constructs SANT-1 reduced association of
BODIPY-cyclopamine at the two lower concentrations but did not completely
abrogate binding of 1000 nM BODIPY-cyclopamine.

Cyclopamine is chemically similar to cholesterol rendering it cell permeable and
lipophilic resulting in high unspecific binding to cells and particularly membranes.
When comparing the increase in NanoBRET between BODIPY-cyclopamine and
Nluc-SMO (or CRD Nluc-SMO) with the increase in the fluorescence signal
emerging from BODIPY-cyclopamine, specific and saturable binding can be detected
by NanoBRET already in the lower nanomolar range especially with the CRD NlucSMO construct. On the other hand, the non-saturable increase in fluorescence is
detectable only at higher concentrations of BODIPY-cyclopamine. More importantly,
the NanoBRET signal saturates at ligand concentrations that produce an unreliable
increase in fluorescence, especially in the case of the CRD Nluc-SMO. At higher
BODIPY-cyclopamine concentrations, beyond those required to saturate the
NanoBRET signal, a linear increase of fluorescence was detectable indicating that
fluorescence includes a substantial component of unspecific ligand binding (Fig.
4a,b). This was particularly obvious when comparing the fluorescence signal at a
BODIPY-concentration producing maximal binding in the absence and presence of
10 µM SANT-1 for the Nluc-SMO and the CRD Nluc-SMO constructs (Fig. 4c). At
this concentration the NanoBRET signal was blocked by SANT-1, whereas
fluorescence was not affected.

BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to SMO is surmountable
To explore the competitive nature of BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to SMO in more
detail, we combined BODIPY-cyclopamine with increasing concentrations of
commercially available SMO antagonist (SANT-1), inverse agonist (cyclopamineKAAD) and agonists (SAG1.3 and purmorphamine) employing both the full length

Nluc-SMO (competition with 200 nM BODIPY-cyclopamine; the fluorescent ligand
used at this concentration gave approximately 50% of max NanoBRET in the
saturation experiments) as well as the CRD Nluc-SMO (competition with 10 nM
BODIPY-cyclopamine; the fluorescent ligand used at this concentration gave
approximately 50% of max NanoBRET in the saturation experiments). While
cyclopamine-KAAD and SANT-1 presented the highest affinity to Nluc-SMO, the
agonist SAG1.3 was intermediate and purmorphamine showed the lowest affinity
(Fig. 5a, Table 1). A similar rank order was obtained in the CRD Nluc-SMOtransfected cells (Fig. 5b, Table 2). Interestingly, residual BODIPY-cyclopamine
binding produced NanoBRET, at competitor concentrations sufficiently high to reach
saturation, that were substantially higher in the full length Nluc-SMO compared (Fig.
5a) to CRD Nluc-SMO (Fig. 5b). At maximal competition SANT-1 reduced BODIPYcyclopamine (200 nM) binding to 45.2% of maximal binding, whereas it completely
abolished BODIPY-cyclopamine (10 nM) binding at the CRD Nluc-SMO (~0.1%
binding left). These findings indicate that, at the tested concentrations, BODIPYcyclopamine binding is surmountable to a higher degree at the CRD Nluc-SMO
compared to Nluc-SMO. Additionally, cyclopamine-KAAD competition with BODIPYcyclopamine at the full-length receptor did not reach the plateau indicating further
displacement of the fluorescent ligand, presumably at a different binding pocket.

(Zhang, Sun, Liu & Song, 2018). Here, we introduced the double mutant
D477G6.54/E522K7.38 into Nluc-SMO and CRD Nluc-SMO (corresponding to human
D4736.54 and E5187.38 mutants) in order to further dissect the contribution of different
binding sites to BODIPY-cyclopamine-SMO interaction. The mutant versions are
expressed on the cell surface upon transient transfection in DSMO HEK293 cells
(Fig. 6a). In order to further define the binding characteristics of the two separate
BODIPY-cyclopamine binding sites in the 7TM core of the receptor, we made use of
a saturating concentration of SANT-1 (10 µM) and probed the wild type and

and

with

increasing

concentrations of BODIPY-cyclopamine (Fig. 6b, c). In line with the competition data
using a fixed BODIPY-cyclopamine concentration, we found that SANT-1, which
solely binds to the 7TM ligand binding site of SMO (Wang et al., 2014), reduces the
maximal binding of BODIPY-cyclopamine at the Nluc-SMO by one third with
maintained affinity. At the CRD Nluc-SMO, however, SANT-1 virtually prevents
BODIPY-cyclopamine interaction with SMO up to a concentration of 100 nM. At 100
nM and above BODIPY-cyclopamine reliably showed specific, SANT-1 (10 µM)insensitive binding in cells transfected with CRD Nluc-SMO. The SANT-1insensitive fraction of BODIPY-cyclopamine shows a reduced Bmax and a lower
affinity. In the full length Nluc-SMO, the double mutant did not affect Bmax of BODIPYcyclopamine and affinity was only slightly reduced (one-site fit Bmax = 0.035 ± 0.002,
Kd = 666.2 ± 121.8 nM). In CRD Nluc-SMO D477G6.54/E522K7.38, on the other hand,
the BODIPY-cyclopamine curve was clearly right-shifted and maximal binding was
reduced (one-site fit Bmax = 0.074 ± 0.001, Kd = 450.2 ± 38.7 nM). In both cases,
SANT-1 (10 µM), which targets the lower binding pocket, maintains its effect on
BODIPY-cyclopamine at both the wt and the D477G6.54/E522K7.38 for full length and

similar to Nluc-SMO, suggesting binding to the same ligand binding site.

4. DISCUSSION
The development of a NanoBRET-based ligand binding assay provides an interesting
complement to GPCR pharmacology enabling ligand binding studies on living cells in
real time with simplified protocols (Stoddart et al., 2015; Stoddart, Kilpatrick & Hill,
2018). Here, we optimize this assay for the Class F receptor SMO improving
sensitivity and performance of previously used fluorescence-based approaches
(Chen, Taipale, Cooper & Beachy, 2002; Chen, Taipale, Young, Maiti & Beachy,
2002; Gorojankina et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Manetti et al.,
2010; Tao et al., 2011). Due to its large assay window for specific binding and the low
influence of unspecific binding this NanoBRET-based assay is particularly suitable for
lipophilic ligands such as cyclopamine and potentially other cholesterol-like
molecules, which target SMO and generally show unspecific interactions with the
membrane. Furthermore, this high-throughput compatible assay should be adaptable
to any fluorescently-tagged molecule acting as SMO ligand and could – provided
small molecules become available to target Frizzleds also be employed for other
Class F receptors.

Recent insight into the molecular mechanisms of drug action on SMO by
crystallography and CryoEM provide somewhat controversial

yet intriguing

information regarding cyclopamine and cholesterol interaction with the 7TM ligandbinding site and the CRD (Deshpande et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al.,
2018; Qi, Liu, Thompson, McDonald, Zhang & Li, 2019; Weierstall et al., 2014). Here,
we have been able to pharmacologically separate two BODIPY-cyclopamine binding
sites on the 7TM core of SMO. Total BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to full length NlucSMO is composed of at least two components: ligand binding to the CRD (Huang et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018) – for which we did not find evidence for in our
experiments – and the 7TM core (Huang et al., 2018; Weierstall et al., 2014). Most
importantly, SANT-1, which solely binds to the receptor core in the lower pocket of
the SMO binding site (Wang et al., 2014), competes with BODIPY-cyclopamine more
efficiently in the CRD Nluc-SMO compared to the full length receptor. This large
increase in affinity and NanoBRET signal/Bmax suggest that the CRD exerts a
negative allosteric modulation on BODIPY-cyclopamine binding to the SMO 7TM
core. The residual binding of BODIPY-cyclopamine to CRD Nluc-SMO above 10-7 M
identifies a SANT-1-insensitive fraction suggesting an additional binding pocket for
BODIPY-cyclopamine. Given the simultaneous binding of SAG21k and cholesterol to
SMO in the recent crystal structure (PDB 6O3C) of active, nanobody NbSmo8-bound
SMO (Deshpande et al., 2019), and the fact that SANT-1 and cyclopamine occupy
two different parts of the small molecule binding space in SMO (Huang et al., 2018;
Wang et al., 2014; Weierstall et al., 2014) it could also be possible that BODIPYcyclopamine and SANT-1 bind the 7TM course simultaneously. It remains to be
verified by structural studies if binding modes of cyclopamine and BODIPYcyclopamine are indeed the same. Along these lines, different binding poses of

cyclopamine and related sterols were reported in several crystal structures using
SMO from various species. In summary, there is a cyclopamine/sterol binding site in
the lipid groove of the CRD (Byrne et al., 2016; Deshpande et al., 2019; Huang et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2018), one in the upper pocket of the 7TM core (Huang et al.,
2018; Qi, Liu, Thompson, McDonald, Zhang & Li, 2019) and one in the lower position
(Deshpande et al., 2019), which overlaps with the SANT-1 binding pocket (Wang et
al., 2014) (Fig. 7). Moreover, SAG1.3-induced Gli transcriptional activity still reaches
saturation albeit at lower efficacy following treatment with SANT-1.This further
provides functional evidence that both the upper (SAG1.3 binding site) and the lower
pocket (SANT-1 binding site) in the 7TM core of SMO can be occupied by ligands
simultaneously and that these pockets may allosterically regulate each other (Chen,
Taipale, Young, Maiti & Beachy, 2002). Similar conclusions were drawn from
radioligand binding studies (Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002; Tao et al., 2011).
Furthermore, the phenomenon of allosteric regulation in the SMO binding site was
also inferred from studies on other SMO ligands (Chen et al., 2016; Hoch et al.,
2015).
Interestingly, removal of the CRD of SMO increased both Bmax and the Kd of
BODIPY-cyclopamine. The absence of the CRD, which obviously includes extinction
of the proposed CRD binding site for BODIPY-cyclopamine, most likely provides
better access to the normally buried binding site in the core of the receptor causing a
left shift and an increased Bmax. Related to that, one might also postulate an allosteric
action of the CRD on the ligand-binding site on the 7TM core, an idea that is fueled
by the observation that CRD SMO exerts a higher constitutive activity (Byrne et al.,
2016). A part of the explanation for the efficacy shift of the BODIPY-cyclopamine
binding curve could also be the altered BRET parameters since the distance of the

NanoBRET donor and the acceptor are likely shorter in the CRD SMO compared to
the full length receptor. However, while the different BRET efficiencies in the two
receptor constructs could affect the amplitude of the NanoBRET signal originating
from BODIPY-cyclopamine binding, it cannot explain the leftward shift of the binding
curves indicating a higher affinity to the CRD Nluc-SMO. It should be noted that in
previous publications low concentrations of BODIPY-cyclopamine (usually 5 nM)
were used for SMO binding assays. Given our data regarding the different affinities of
the separate BODIPY-cyclopamine binding sites, these low ligand concentrations
neither allowed sampling the SANT-1-insensitive, low affinity site in the core of
CRD-Nluc SMO nor the putative site on the CRD of the full-length receptor.
Application of the novel NanoBRET methodology, however, allows to reliably detect
even picomolar and nanomolar amounts of BODIPY-cyclopamine bound to CRD
Nluc-SMO and CRD Nluc-SMO D477G6.54/E522K7.38.
In summary, we dissect BODIPY-cyclopamine interaction with two binding sites on
the 7TM core with different affinities. The high affinity site is the deep SANT-1 binding
pocket. Since the D477G6.54/E522K7.38 in TM6 and TM7 partially affect the high
affinity component of BODIPY-cyclopamine binding, it could be that interaction with
D4776.54/E5227.38 provides a transition mechanism of ligand binding to the deeper
pocket. Low affinity binding to the D477G6.54/E522K7.38 mutant in the upper 7TM site
is still possible and that binding is insensitive to allosteric modulation by SANT-1
binding to the deeper site.
For drug discovery efforts, the CRD Nluc-SMO probe presents a valuable tool with
an advantageous assay window. The intrinsic caveat of the lack of the physiologically
relevant CRD, however, remains, requiring thorough validation of screening hits in

separate ligand-binding sites interact allosterically and what role the CRD-core
contacts play for that potential communication.

Nluc-SMO (a) and CRD Nluc-SMO (b). NanoBRET (BRET) data are extracted
from the experiments shown in Fig. 1. Data points are shown as mean±SD of each
technical replicate of eight to nine independent experiments. Curve fitting for
fluorescence values was done using semi-log line function in GraphPad Prism 6. (c)
BODIPY-cyclopamine fluorescence is compared in the absence and presence of 10
µM SANT-1 in experiments with Nluc-SMO or CRD Nluc-SMO. While SANT-1
dramatically affects NanoBRET readings (see Fig. 3), fluorescence values are not
affected. Data present mean±SEM of three to four independent experiments.

Fig. 7: Separate ligand binding sites on SMO. Schematic presentation of reported
SMO ligand binding sites. The receptor model (transparent surface view with protein
backbone shown as ribbon) was derived from the SMO crystal structure bound to
Nanobody NbSmo8 and SAG21k (PDB ID: 6O3C) (Deshpande et al., 2019). The
major subdomains (CRD, linker and 7TM core) are color-coded. Ligands are shown
as spheres and are highlighted in green. Reported ligand binding sites on the CRD
and in the 7TM core are encircled in red. While our data did not indicate BODIPYcyclopamine binding to the CRD site, the NanoBRET-based binding assay supports
two communicating binding sites for BODIPY-cyclopamine in the 7TM core of SMO.
The mutations D477G6.54/E522K7.38 in TM6 and TM7, which affect BODIPYcyclopamine binding to SMO are depicted in red. Based on the effects of
D477G6.54/E522K7.38 and SANT-1 on BODIPY-cyclopamine binding we suggest a two
step binding mode of BODIPY-cyclopamine involving the upper and the lower 7TM
site (orange arrows). The SMO model was produced in PyMOL (The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC).
