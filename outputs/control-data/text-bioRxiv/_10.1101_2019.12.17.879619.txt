ABSTRACT
We used transcriptome analysis by paired-end strand specific RNA-seq to evaluate the

18

specific changes in gene expression associated with the transition to static biofilm growth in the

19

rhizosphere plant growth promoting bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS. Triplicate biological

20

samples of exponential growth, stationary phase, and static biofilm samples were examined.

21

DESeq2 and Rockhopper were used to identify robust and widespread shifts in gene expression

22

the transcriptomic signals specific to each growth phase. Weidentified 1711 protein coding

23

genes (28%) using DESeq2 that had altered expression greater than 2-fold specifically in

24

biofilms compared to exponential growth. Fewer genes were specifically differentially

25

expressed in stationary phase culture (757, 12%). A small set of genes (103/6020) were

26

differentially expressed in opposing fashions in biofilm and stationary phase, indicating

27

potentially substantial shifts in phenotype. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the only class

28

of genes specifically upregulated in biofilms were associated with nutrient transport,

29

highlighting the importance of nutrient uptake in the biofilm. The biofilm specific genes did not

30

overlap substantially with the loci identified by mutagenesis studies, although some were

31

present in both sets. The most highly upregulated biofilm specific gene is predicted to be a part

32

of the RNA degradosome, which indicates that RNA stability is used to regulate the biofilm

33

phenotype. Two small putative proteins, Varpa_0407 and Varpa_3832, are highly expressed

34

specifically in biofilms and are predicted to be secreted DNA binding proteins, that may stabilize

35

extracellular DNA as a component of the biofilm matrix. An flp/tad type IV pilus locus

36

(Varpa_5148-60) is strongly downregulated in specifically in biofilms, in contrast with results

37

from other systems for these pili. Mutagenesis confirms that this locus is important in surface

motility rather than biofilm formation. These experimental results suggest that V. paradoxus

39

EPS biofilms have substantial regulatory and structural novelty.

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that many if not most bacteria spend a large fraction of their time

43

in the biofilm state [1]. Many models of biofilm formation and growth have been evaluated,

44

and while there are differences in the outcomes [2], one widely accepted static biofilm model is

45

attachment to an abiotic surface while immersed in growth medium [3]. This model has been

46

used to study biofilm formation in pathogens, plant associated bacteria, and industrial

47

biofouling, and life attached to natural surfaces (for review see [1, 4]). Biofilm gene expression

48

patterns have been examined in many systems – a search of the sequence read archive (SRA)

49

for the terms “transcriptome and biofilm” yields 922 results! The rapid advancement of DNA

50

sequencing and reduction in cost have made genomes and transcriptomes much more widely

51

available beyond the traditional model microorganisms [5]. Transcriptome analysis can lead to

52

insights into an organism’s response to changing physiological conditions that evade traditional

53

mutagenesis approaches [6]. The costs for these analyses have dropped precipitously, and the

54

number of bacterial whole genomes available is very large (74,764 on 12-10-19,

55

https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi?section=ImgStatsOverview), especially in the easily

56

cultivatable groups, making it possible to use these approaches outside the common model

57

organisms. Shifts in gene expression have been specifically associated with the biofilm lifestyle,

58

across many different bacteria, and in different biofilm contexts [3, 7–9]. A wide distribution of

59

gene expression patterns have been observed, and there is a great deal of variability that is

60

both strain specific and driven by experimental setup.

61

Variovorax paradoxus is a soil dwelling member of the beta-proteobacteria that is

62

widely recognized as an important plant-growth promoting bacterium [10, 11]. It has been

63

frequently identified as a degrader of xenobiotics and source of important enzymes for

64

biocatalysis [10]. Several finished genomes of Variovorax paradoxus strains are published [12,

65

13], and many more are available as permanent draft sequences (twenty annotated genomes

66

including four complete genomes at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The strain that we discuss here, V.

67

paradoxus EPS, has been evaluated for its behavior in laboratory conditions that regulate

68

swarming motility and biofilm formation [14], and we have also used insertional mutagenesis to

69

identify some genes involved in these complex phenotypes [15]. In this work we show that the

70

shift to biofilm growth in V. paradoxus is accompanied by a large-scale change in transcript

71

profile. The biofilm gene expression profile is substantially different from the stationary phase

72

profile, and the robustness of the signal was confirmed using two independent analyses of the

73

raw transcript data. A total of 1711 genes were found to be uniquely and significantly altered

74

in expression by more than 2-fold in the biofilm cultures, representing 28% of protein coding

75

genes (1711/6020). A much smaller number of genes was identified as specifically differentially

76

regulated in stationary phase culture (757/6020, 12%). There were substantial deviations in the

77

number of genes identified using different analysis tools, but most of the deviations were

78

related to de novo gene identification and data normalization strategies, and do not

79

significantly alter the overall picture. Shifts previously observed in single gene qPCR are

80

observed again [15], providing further independent confirmation of the consistency of the data.

81

Only a few of the genes previously identified as affecting biofilm formation were present in the

82

significantly altered transcript profiles, and all of the ones identified were among the genes

83

downregulated in biofilm. The most highly upregulated biofilm specific gene, Varpa_1640

84

encodes a putative DEAD-box helicase that is predicted to be part of the RNA degradosome,

85

implying that biofilm transition may be globally regulated by RNA stability. Two small

86

hypothetical proteins with homology to the SNF2 superfamily of DNA binding proteins are also

87

highly upregulated. Both of these proteins have predicted signal peptides in their sequences

88

that lead to the hypothesis that they are non-specific DNA binding proteins that stabilize the

89

biofilm matrix. In contrast to many other previously described biofilm systems, pili appear to be

90

downregulated, and the transcriptome data on the tad locus (Varpa5148-60) along with

91

mutational analysis suggests that this pilus is involved in motility rather than attachment. All of

92

these insights and potential new avenues for exploration come from analysis of the gene

93

expression pattern, and most were not accessible by traditional mutational analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

95

Culture conditions. All cultures were grown in 2.5 g/L yeast extract (50% YE) for 24hrs from a

96

isolated colonies picked off of a low passage plate (1-2 passages since -80 storage). All cultures

97

were incubated at 30°C at all times, liquid growth cultures were incubated with shaking at 200

98

rpm for maximal oxygenation. For logarithmic growth, the culture was diluted 1:20 into 10 mL

99

of 50% YE, and monitored spectrophotometrically using OD595. Aliquots from three separate

100

cultures were collected when the OD595 was approximately 0.5, and RNA was immediately

101

extracted from ~109 cells per sample. Identical cultures were grown for stationary phase

102

analysis, but RNA was collected when the OD595 was stable for successive readings spaced

103

30m apart (approximately 18h after dilution inoculation). For biofilm cultures, an identical

104

dilution was grown for 24h in 12 well Falcon plates (non-tissue culture treated) with 2 ml of

105

liquid medium per well. The plates were incubated at an angle using a 10 ml serological pipet

106

to create an air/liquid interface on the bottom of the well. After 24h the medium was replaced

107

with minimal disruption to the biofilm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 24h

108

under the same conditions. After this incubation the liquid medium was removed, the plate

109

was washed with fresh medium, and the biofilm was recovered by scraping. One well in the

110

plate was incubated with media only as an inoculum control. The 11 inoculated wells from

111

each plate constituted a biological replicate.

112

RNA isolation. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 10000 x g and the supernatant was

113

discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of 1mg/mL lysozyme in 10 mM Tris 1mM EDTA

114

(TE, pH 8.0). Two volumes of RNAprotect (Qiagen) was added to each sample and the samples

115

were incubated for 10 minutes at 25 °C. Some samples were preserved in this solution at -80 °C

116

until further processing. The remaining steps were performed following the RNeasy (Qiagen)

117

protocol. Successive addition of 700 µL of Buffer RLT and 500 µL of 100% ethanol (RNA grade,

118

Fisher) was followed by transfer of the mixture into an RNeasy Mini Spin column. After

119

centrifugation the flow through was discarded. The column was washed with 350 µL of buffer

120

RW1. To eliminate DNA from the sample, 100 µL of RQ-1 RNase free DNase (Promega) was

121

added to the column and incubated at 25°C for 15 minutes. The column was then washed

122

again with 350 µL of RW1 and the remaining steps of the protocol were followed.

123

RNA purification and assessment. RNA was precipitated by adding 10% (v/v) 3M sodium

124

acetate, 5 µg glycogen and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, and incubating overnight at -20°C. The

125

RNA was pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge using a FA 45-30-11 rotor

126

at 12000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C. The liquid was carefully by aspiration removed and the

127

pellet resuspended in 1 mL of 70% ethanol. After an additional identical centrifugation step,

128

the pellet was dried and then resuspended in 24 µL of TE. The concentration and purity of the

129

RNA samples was determined spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop ND1000

130

spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Further analysis for sample suitability was performed by

131

Beijing Genomics Institute (Hong Kong).

132

RNA-seq. The RNA was sequenced using a strand-specific paired end protocol by BGI genomics

133

(Hong Kong). Each sample was sequenced for 91 cycles in an Illumina HiSeq instrument with a

134

total of 1.5x107 reads per sample. Each of the three conditions (logarithmic, stationary, biofilm)

135

was sampled in triplicate (biological replicates), derived from single colonies plated on YE agar

136

directly from the original V. paradoxus EPS stock culture. The raw sequences were transmitted

137

as fastq files for subsequent analysis. These files have been uploaded to NCBI and are available

138

as gzip archives (BioProject PRJNA594416, BioSample SAMN13517278, SRA accession #s

139

SRR10613920-8).

140

Expression analysis. Raw sequence data was uploaded to the Galaxy main server

141

(galaxy.psu.edu) and all of the bioinformatic tools described below were accessed at that site,

142

unless otherwise noted. Uploaded sequences were trimmed based on quality using the

143

Trimmomatic tool [16], and aligned to the Variovorax paradoxus EPS genome using BWA [17].

144

Trimmed sequences were also aligned to the genome using the Rockhopper suite of RNA-seq

145

tools for differential gene expression analysis [18] on a local desktop computer. The BWA

146

alignment was transformed into count data using the StringTie tool [19], and differential

147

expression analysis was undertaken using the DESeq2 version 1.18.1 toolkit following the

148

workflow outlined in [20]. The DESeq2 program treated each individual gene as a separate

149

transcript for the purposes of differential expression analysis. Venn diagrams were drawn in the

150

Galaxy tool using the output of DESeq2 filtered on >2x change in expression level, and tables of

151

up and down regulated genes were generated using the Filter tool on Benjamini-Hochberg

152

adjusted p-value p <0.05 and fold expression change > 2. Transcript counts from Rockhopper

153

were visualized (.wig files) in the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) available at

154

(https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). Additional Rockhopper text file output on

155

operon structure and de novo transcript structure were used for analysis of specific individual

156

genes.

157

Motility mutant screen and complementation. Transposon mutants were generated using Tn5

158

(tetR) as described previously [15]. Mutants with impaired motility were enriched in YE (5 g/L)

159

liquid culture by growth with shaking overnight followed by a 1h settling period, followed by

160

transfer of 1:100 of the culture volume into a fresh tube. This procedure was repeated x times

161

(look at Jenny’s proposal) followed by plating on swarming medium [14]. Isolates that were

162

identified as having decreased motility were subsequently tested for stability of the defect by

163

repeated swarming assays. The interrupted gene was identified by the rescue cloning approach

164

described previously [15]. PCR amplified fragments from the V. paradoxus EPS genome

165

corresponding to Varpa_5148 alone and the region including Varpa_5148-50 were cloned

166

including regulatory sequence identified from transcriptome examination into pCR2.1 (KanR)

167

(Invitrogen) and verified by Sanger sequencing. These elements were subcloned into

168

pBBR1MCS-2 (KanR) [21] using BamHI and HindIII sites incorporated into the primers. The

169

complementation constructs and control plasmids were then introduced into V. paradoxus EPS

170

by electroporation as described previously [15].

171

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

172

Differential Expression analysis using DESeq2. The DESeq2 suite of programs was used to

173

analyze transcripts from all three growth conditions in a pairwise fashion [20]. All of the

174

outputs of DESeq2 are included in Supplemental Data S1. The three sets of samples were

175

evaluated for sample consistency among biological replicates using PCA analysis (Figure 1A) and

176

a heatmap of Euclidian distance (Figure 1B). The three biological replicates from each sample

177

are clustered together as expected, and exponential growth samples (“log”) are less variable

178

than either the stationary phase or biofilm samples. Using the Benjamini-Hochberg false

179

discovery rate, the adjusted p-values were calculated for each pairwise comparison. The MA

180

plots of comparisons between log phase and either stationary phase (Figure 2A) or biofilm

181

(Figure 2B) show the distribution of differential expression. The top 25 up and down regulated

182

loci unique to biofilm growth are listed in Table 2 and Table 3. Loci identified by DESeq2 but not

183

corresponding to an open reading frame were ignored for this analysis but included in the

184

global expression analysis. After filtering for >2x change in expression, 1104 loci were identified

185

as having significantly increased expression uniquely during biofilm growth, while 607 had

186

decreased expression using the same parameters (Figure 3A, B). Interestingly, the unique

187

proportion of the differentially regulated genes in each direction (1104/1436 v 607/865) was

188

similar. An additional set of comparisons revealed a total of 103 genes which where expression

189

relative to exponential growth was regulated in opposite directions between biofilm and

190

stationary phase (Figure 3 C, D). The lists of genes specifically differentially expressed in biofilm

191

and stationary phase, and the list of genes with opposite regulation, are listed in Supplemental

192

Data S1 along with RPKM values and DESeq2 derived significance values.

193

Transcriptome structure analysis with Rockhopper. Pairwise analysis of the transcriptome

194

replicates was performed using Rockhopper [18] to compare the methods and evaluate the

195

robustness of the datasets. The overall results of differential expression analysis were similar

196

(not shown) with differences attributable to count normalization and annotation parameters.

197

We limited our use of Rockhopper to in depth analysis of individual loci and to identification of

198

operon structure. This program will also identify small RNA, but since our initial data collection

199

did not specifically isolate small RNA, data on differential small RNA expression is not presented

200

here. 1262 multigene operons were identified by Rockhopper based on transcript data, along

201

with 3021 gene pairs. The total number of protein coding genes identified as differentially

202

regulated in biofilms was 2145, while the number differentially regulated in stationary phase

203

was 2508. This was a substantially different outcome than with DESeq2. When examining the

204

text outputs of the comparison, it was observed that Rockhopper and DESeq2 both identify

205

many potential small RNAs and other non-coding elements, which are not directly comparable.

206

In all cases where an individual gene was evaluated for differential expression, the results were

207

similar, and quantitative differences in fold-induction or repression are likely due to different

208

normalization or de novo transcript identification algorithms. All of these results are included in

209

Supplemental Data S2.

210

Loci previously evaluated for biofilm transcription. Our previous work identified a number of

211

loci that when mutated resulted in altered biofilm and/or swarming phenotypes [15]. We found

212

that only 8/30 loci identified previously by transposon insertion [15] were differentially

213

regulated at the level of transcription, and all of those loci were downregulated in biofilms. In

214

that work several loci were identified by multiple insertions that were all associated with the

215

phenotypic alteration, namely multiple insertions into Varpa_5900 and Varpa_4680, encoding

216

the PilY1 tip adhesin and a glycosyl transferase, respectively. In both of these cases the RNA-

217

seq analysis confirmed the data collected previously by qRT-PCR [15], confirming the validity of

218

the assay conditions independently. Interestingly, there are 3 PilY1 loci in V. paradoxus EPS

219

(5900, 3518, 4912), but only Varpa_5900 is expressed to a significant degree under any of the

220

conditions tested.

221

Gene Ontology Enrichment. Gene ontology analysis of the upregulated and downregulated loci

222

is presented in Figure 4. Panels A and B show diverse sets of gene categories that are

223

overrepresented among the genes with differential expression in biofilms, while panel C

224

identifies a much narrower set of genes overrepresented in the set of genes upregulated

225

specifically in biofilms. No gene categories were overrepresented among the loci specifically

226

downregulated in biofilms. The overrepresented categories in Figure 4C are indicative of the

227

increased need for transport of essential micronutrients such as metal co-factors and nutrients

228

that tend to limit replication and viability such as inorganic phosphorus. This latter gene family

229

may also be connected to the use of eDNA as a nutrient storage mechanism as well as a

230

structural component of the biofilm matrix [22]. These GO category patterns are consistent

231

with a biofilm structure with increased nutrient transport to maintain viability throughout the

232

structure and to distribute resources throughout the biofilm.

233

Secreted snf2 family proteins. A pair of small proteins were specifically highly upregulated in

234

biofilm growth (Table 1, red), which have high homology to one another (Varpa_0407 and

235

Varpa_3832). Highly similar proteins are found in some other V. paradoxus genomes examined,

236

but no close orthologs were found outside the genus using BLASTp [23]. Both genes are highly

237

expressed specifically in the biofilm state, and both have an extensive 5’ untranslated region

238

(Figure 5A, only Varpa_0407 shown). They are annotated as members of the Snf2 superfamily

239

of DNA binding proteins [24, 25], but were much smaller than all previously described proteins

240

in this superfamily. The proteins in Variovorax paradoxus are also annotated as having a 24

241

amino acid leader peptide cleaved in each case to generate a mature 102 amino acid protein.

242

The most common association of Snf2 proteins with function is with helicase activity and

243

chromatin remodeling [25], neither of which is compatible with a bacterial secreted protein.

244

Our conjecture based on this information is that these small proteins are non-specific DNA

245

binding proteins that are secreted to stabilize the biofilm structure which likely contains

246

extracellular DNA (eDNA) as a structural component, as is common in many bacterial species

247

[22]. The presence of these proteins may stabilize the biofilm matrix and protect against

248

extracellular DNAse activity (Figure 5B). It also may be that they were not uncovered by

249

mutational analysis because of their likely functional redundancy.

250

RNA turnover role in Biofilm Regulation. The most specifically highly upregulated gene in our

251

analysis was Varpa_1640 (Table 1, green), which was not identified in our previous biofilm

252

mutant screen. This protein is predicted to be a DEAD-box RNA helicase, a widespread family of

253

proteins recently shown to play a role in biofilm formation [26]. We hypothesize that this

254

protein is active in RNA turnover in V. paradoxus EPS based on the KEGG predicted RNA

255

degradation pathway [27] (Figure 6A). The RNA degradosomes Type A-C (representing

256

machinery identified in E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Rhodobacter, respectively) are overlapping

257

phosphorylase (PNPase, Varpa_4029), enolase (Varpa_2167), RNaseE/R (Varpa_1519,

259

Varpa_3333), and helicases (DEAD/DEAH box, Varpa_4256, Varpa_0178, Varpa_2773), along

260

with the RNA 5’ pyrophosphohydrolase RppH (Varpa_4825) and the Rho transcription

261

termination factor (Varpa_2500). Varpa_1640 was not identified in the KEGG orthology as part

262

of this machinery, nor was the RhlB protein present in the KEGG assignments (Figure 6A) but

263

the STRING network map [28] for Varpa_1640 connects this locus to the RNA degradosome

264

(Figure 6B).The other DEAD/DEAH box helicase (Varpa_4256) is upregulated 15x specifically in

265

biofilms, while none of the other proteins involved in RNA degradation are specifically

266

upregulated in this growth phenotype. The PNPase, enolase, and RNAses are all highly

267

expressed in biofilm (Supplemental Data S1, S2), leading to the hypothesis that differential

268

expression of Varpa_1640 is a mechanism for regulating RNA stability and drastically altering

269

the gene expression profile. A relationship between a DEAD-box helicase and biofilm growth

270

was recently described in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri [26], based on mutations in the

271

HrpB helicase resulting in reduced expression of Type IV pili. Intriguingly, our prior work

272

indicated that Type IV pili are critical for the switch between biofilm and swarming phenotypes

273

in V. paradoxus EPS [15], suggesting a possible link between RNA stability, pilus formation, and

274

attachment phenotypes.

275

Regulation of Pilus formation and the tad locus. The V. paradoxus EPS genome encodes

276

multiple pili, including a Type IV pilus with multiple PilY1 proteins and a putative tad/flp pilus

277

locus (Varpa 5148-5160) similar to the tad locus characterized in the bacterium Aggregatibacter

278

actinomycetemcomitans [29]. Diverse roles in surface attachment and motility have been

279

identified for pili in different bacterial systems especially type IV pili (T4P) [30], making

280

inference about the roles of these appendages difficult. The tad/flp pilin is classified as a T4Pb

281

class pilin, and is broadly distributed in both gram negative and gram positive bacteria [31]. This

282

pilus has been identified as the appendage responsible for tight adhesion, and also as the

283

bundle forming pilus, and has been implicated in adherence to surfaces and virulence in several

284

different bacteria [32–34]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa pilus gene expression changes in

285

different strains and biofilm conditions can vary widely and be difficult to interpret [2][35].

286

Inspection of the set of V. paradoxus EPS genes with altered expression for pilus related loci

287

revealed that all of the identified pilus genes were downregulated in biofilm with the exception

288

of Varpa_3516 and Varpa_3520. However, the expression levels at these loci (which are

289

predicted to be cotranscribed – see Supplemental Data S2) are quite minimal, so it is not clear

290

that this signal is meaningful. The tad locus genes are predicted to be expressed in three

291

distinct transcripts (Supplemental Data S2), with only the pilus gene and the prepilin peptidase

292

having a very large fold decrease in expression in biofilms (Supplemental Data S1). The

293

putative prepilin peptidase (Varpa_5149) was annotated as a pseudogene initially but in more

294

recent annotations has been identified as an open reading frame (not shown,

295

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_014931.1?report=graph). The putative operons for

296

the rest of the tight adhesion pilus are also downregulated, but to a much lower degree than

297

the pilin and peptidase (Figure 7B). The presence of a strong antisense RNA signal in this

298

operon (Figure 7B, green box) suggests potential regulation by RNA stability, as this rise in

299

potential double stranded RNA formation corresponds with the lower transcript levels

300

specifically in biofilm growth. An independent experiment attempting to enrich for motility

301

mutants identified transposon insertions within the tad locus leading to deficiencies in

302

swarming motility (Figure 7A). Using a Tn5 insertion disrupting the Varpa_5148 pilin gene, we

303

showed using complementation in trans with different constructs (Figure 7A) that both the pilin

304

and the prepilin peptidase (Varpa_5149) are necessary and sufficient to restore motility in this

305

background (Figure 7C). This data supports experimentally the operon structure suggested by

306

transcriptome analysis, and is evidence that this pilus is directly involved in swarming motility,

307

which has not previously been shown in any system. Previously, only Pseudomonas aeruginosa

308

had been shown to contain both Type IVa and IVb pili [34], and this is the first time to our

309

knowledge that the tad/flp pilus has been associated directly with motility.

CONCLUSIONS

311

We show here that the rhizosphere isolate Variovorax paradoxus EPS has a substantial shift in

312

gene expression when it grows in a biofilm, with about 28% of its genome specifically altered in

313

expression in a static biofilm model. Analysis of the expression pattern has led to a potential

314

new hypothesis about the role of RNA stability in this phenotype, and the specific role of the

315

Varpa_1640 DEAD-box helicase in this mechanism. A previously unrecognized type of small

316

secreted DNA binding protein was identified and is proposed to have an important and specific

317

role in biofilm growth. In contrast with previous work in other systems, the expression profile,

318

presence of a cis-antisense RNA, and mutational analysis suggest that the flp/tad locus is

319

suppressed in biofilms and expressed during motile growth. Mutational analysis of biofilm

320

formation yields sharply contrasting results compared to transcriptomic analysis, suggesting

321

both methods are necessary for a complete picture of this complex phenotype.
