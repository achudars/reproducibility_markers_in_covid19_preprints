Abstract

17

Growing evidence suggests the outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is

18

established rapidly after exposure, but how the current tuberculosis vaccine, BCG, impacts early

19

immunity is poorly understood. Here we found that murine BCG immunization promotes a

20

dramatic shift in infected cell types. While alveolar macrophages (AM) are the major infected

21

cell for the first two weeks in unimmunized animals, BCG promotes the accelerated recruitment

22

and infection of lung infiltrating phagocytes. Interestingly, this shift is dependent on CD4 T

23

cells, yet does not require intrinsic recognition of antigen presented by infected AM. Mtb-

24

specific T cells are first activated in lung regions devoid of infected cells, and these events

25

precede vaccine-induced reduction of the bacterial burden, which occurs only after the co-

26

localization of T cells and infected cells. Understanding how BCG alters early immune responses

27

to Mtb provides new avenues to improve upon the immunity it confers.

Introduction

29

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the current tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, is effective at

30

preventing disseminated disease in infants and young children (1). However, in most settings it

31

provides little or no protection against adult pulmonary TB, the transmissible form of disease (2).

32

Thus, despite widespread BCG immunization for nearly a century, Mycobacterium tuberculosis

33

(Mtb) kills over 1.5 million people every year, more than any other single infectious agent (3). A

34

better TB vaccine is urgently needed, but attaining this goal has been surprisingly difficult (4).

35

Furthermore, because BCG reduces childhood mortality, a new vaccine will likely be added to a

36

regimen that includes BCG, rather than replace it (5). To develop a strategy that builds upon

37

BCG-mediated protection, we must first understand how BCG shapes immunity to Mtb,

38

especially during early stages of infection when protective immunity is established.

39

In mice, pulmonary Mtb burdens are equivalent between BCG-immunized and control mice until

40

two weeks after infection (6). The failure of BCG to impact the Mtb burden during the first two

41

weeks of infection has been attributed to the delayed arrival of T cells in the lung (7). However,

42

BCG-specific T cells have been shown to be present in the lungs (8) of immunized mice even

43

prior to Mtb challenge, indicating that impaired T cell recruitment cannot fully account for the

44

inability of BCG to induce early protection.

45
46

In this study, we utilized the mouse model to investigate the impact of BCG on the early immune

47

response to Mtb infection. Our findings reveal unexpected roles for CD4 T cells in: 1)

48

accelerating the translocation of Mtb-infected alveolar macrophages (AM) into the lung

49

interstitium; 2) recruiting monocyte-derived macrophages; and 3) promoting the early transfer of

50

Mtb from AM to other phagocytes.

Materials and Methods

52

Mice

53

C57BL/6 and MHCII-/- mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All

54

mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions at Seattle Children’s Research Institute

55

(SCRI). Experiments were performed in compliance with the SCRI Animal Care and Use

56

Committee. Both male and female mice between the ages of 8-12 weeks were used.

57
58

BCG immunization

59

BCG-Pasteur was cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth at 37°C to an OD of 0.2-0.5. Bacteria was

60

diluted in PBS and 106 CFU in 200ul was injected subcutaneously. After immunization, mice

61

were rested for 8 weeks prior to Mtb infection.

62
63

Aerosol Infections

64

Infections were performed with wildtype H37Rv Mtb or H37Rv transformed with an mCherry

65

reporter plasmid (9). Mice were enclosed in a Glas-Col aerosol infection chamber and 50-100

66

CFU were deposited directly into the lungs.

67
68

Intratracheal and intravenous labeling

69

For intratracheal labeling, 30min prior to sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with 25% isoflurane

70

in propylene glycol (Fisher Scientific) and 0.25ug of CD45.2 PE-Cy7 in 50ul of PBS was

71

pipetted into the airway. For intravenous (i.v.) labeling, mice were anesthetized as above and

72

infused with CD45.2 PE 10 min prior to sacrifice.

Lung cell isolation and antibody staining

75

Mouse lungs were homogenized in HEPES buffer with Liberase Blendzyme 3 (70ug/ml; Roche)

76

and DNaseI (30ug/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) using a gentleMacs dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Lungs

77

were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then further homogenized with the gentleMacs. Cells

78

were filtered through a 70um cell strainer and resuspended in RBC lysis buffer (Thermo) prior to

79

a PBS wash. Cells were next incubated with 50ul Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend) for

80

10min at room temperature. Viability dye was quenched with 100ul of antibody cocktail in 50%

81

FACS buffer (PBS containing 2.5% FBS and 0.1% NaN3)/50% Fc block buffer. Staining was

82

performed for 20min at 4°C. Cells were washed with FACS buffer and fixed with 2%

83

paraformaldehyde for 1hr prior to analysis on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). When

84

stain sets contained tetramers, staining was performed for 1hr at room temperature. Ag85B and

85

TB10.4 tetramers were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility.

86
87

Imaging

88

Mice were infected with H37Rv Mtb-mCherry and sacrificed at D10 and D14. Lungs were

89

excised and submerged in BD Cytofix fixative solution diluted 1:3 with PBS for 24hr at 4°C.

90

Lungs were washed 2x in PBS and dehydrated in 30% sucrose for 24hr prior to OCT embedding

91

and rapid freezing in a methylbutane-dry ice slurry. 20um sections were stained overnight at

92

room temperature and coverslipped with Fluoromount G mounting media (Southern Biotec).

93

Images were acquired on a Leica SP8X confocal microscope, compensated for fluorophore

94

spillover using LAS X (Leica), and analyzed with Imaris (Bitplane) and FlowJo (10).

Results and Discussion

113

BCG vaccination promotes Mtb egress from AM early in infection.

114

To understand the effects of BCG immunization on early Mtb infection, we examined the

115

pulmonary Mtb burdens in BCG-immunized and control mice. Consistent with prior reports (6,

116

7), lung burdens rose similarly in both groups through two weeks (Fig. 1A). At D15, the Mtb

117

burden in the immunized group began to diverge and was reduced by one log by D21. These

118

findings are consistent with the idea that BCG-induced immunity is not initiated until the third

119

week of Mtb infection.

120
121

We recently found that Mtb first infects AM before disseminating to other cells including

122

neutrophils (PMN) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (12). As tissue-resident and

123

recruited phagocytes have been shown to differ in their capacity to curb Mtb replication (13, 14),

124

we next asked whether immunization alters the proportions of cell types that harbor infection.

125

Consistent with the similar Mtb burdens at D14, the numbers of cells harboring fluorescent Mtb

126

(Mtb-mCherry) were also similar in each group (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, even at this early phase,

127

we observed a dramatic shift in the composition of infected cells. At D14, the proportion of Mtb-

128

infected AM was significantly reduced in immunized animals compared to controls, with a

129

corresponding increase in infected PMN and MDM (Fig. 1C-D). We confirmed these findings

130

using confocal microscopy and quantitative histocytometry (10), wherein most Mtb was within

131

SiglecF+ AM at D14 in controls but within CD11b+ SiglecF- cells (primarily PMN and MDM) in

132

immunized mice (Fig. 1E-F). As Mtb dissemination to PMN and MDM requires translocation of

133

infected AM to the lung interstitium (12), we next assessed whether this translocation was

134

accelerated in immunized mice. Indeed, intratracheal antibody administration, which specifically

135

labels alveolar-localized cells (12), revealed significantly increased interstitial localization (label-

136

negative) of infected AM in immunized mice at D14 (Fig. 1G). Finally, immunization

137

significantly enhanced MDM recruitment to the lung at D14 (Fig. 1H), which was not observed

138

at earlier time points or in Mtb-naïve mice (Supplemental Fig. 1A), suggesting that the

139

accelerated recruitment of MDM in immunized mice begins between D10 and D14. Thus,

140

although BCG does not impact the pulmonary Mtb burden in the first 2 weeks of infection, it

141

accelerates the translocation of infected AM from alveoli to the lung interstitium, MDM

142

recruitment, and Mtb dissemination to PMN and MDM.

143
144

BCG accelerates the recruitment of antigen-specific T cells to the lung following Mtb

145

infection.

146

This unexpected impact of BCG on the early dynamics of infection led us to next investigate

147

how immunization affects the kinetics of T cell recruitment to the lung. Before infection,

148

antigen-specific CD4 (Ag85B) and CD8 (TB10.4) T cells could be identified in lung cell

149

suspensions of immunized mice (Fig. 2A-C). Although ~25% of the Ag85B-specific cells were

150

located in the lung parenchyma (as evidenced by their failure to stain with i.v. CD45 antibody),

151

virtually all of the TB10.4-specific cells resided in the vasculature (Fig. 2D). Following

152

infection, immunized mice had significantly more Ag85B-specific and TB10.4-specific cells in

153

the lung parenchyma than controls as early as D10; by D14 they contained >5-fold more (Fig.

154

2B-C). Thus, BCG induces a small population of lung-resident Mtb-specific CD4 T cells prior to

155

infection. After infection, BCG accelerates the pulmonary recruitment of both CD4 and CD8

156

Mtb-specific T cells, even before impacting the Mtb burden.

158

CD4 T cells are required for the accelerated transfer of Mtb from AM to recruited

159

phagocytes.

160

Given the presence of lung-resident Mtb-specific T cells in immunized mice prior to infection,

161

we next determined whether T cells play a role in the accelerated transfer of Mtb from AM to

162

other myeloid cells. CD4 or CD8 T cells were depleted from immunized mice beginning 1 day

163

prior to Mtb-mCherry infection and lung cells were assessed at D14 (Supplemental Fig. 1B-C).

164

In the absence of CD4 T cells, the accelerated transfer of Mtb from AM to PMN and MDM was

165

partially reversed, whereas CD8 T cell depletion had no effect (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the

166

accelerated MDM recruitment (Fig. 1H) was also abolished by CD4 depletion (Fig. 3B). We next

167

investigated whether direct recognition of Mtb-infected cells by CD4 T cells was required for the

168

early dissemination out of the AM niche and whether MHCII-/- AM, which cannot present

169

antigen to CD4 T cells, would retain Mtb longer than WT AM. WT:MHCII-/- mixed bone

170

marrow chimeras were generated, BCG immunized, and infected with Mtb-mCherry. At D14,

171

BCG induced the accelerated transfer of Mtb from AM to other myeloid cells irrespective of

172

intrinsic MHCII expression (Fig. 3C). Taken together, BCG-induced CD4 T cells promote the

173

early transfer of Mtb from AM to other myeloid cells in a process that does not require direct

174

cognate interactions between T cells and Mtb-infected AM. Our finding that CD4 T cells

175

promote MDM recruitment to the lung, thereby providing new bacterial targets, may help

176

explain the increased proportion of infected MDM in immunized animals. This recruitment

177

likely relates to T cell production of cytokines, such as IFN-gamma and TNF, which are known

178

to trigger the release of chemokines that act on MDM, i.e., CCL2 and CXCL10 (15).

179
180

BCG-induced CD4 T cells are initially activated distal to the site of Mtb infection.

181

We next investigated the site of CD4 T cell activation during early Mtb infection using phospho-

182

S6 (pS6) as a marker of TCR signaling, which is rapidly induced by TCR engagement, peaking

183

at 4 h and resolving within 24 h (16). To confirm that pS6 expression by T cells is TCR-

184

dependent in the context of Mtb-infected lungs, we demonstrated that pS6 was robustly

185

expressed by adoptively transferred TCR transgenic Mtb-specific (ESAT-6; C7) CD4 T cells

186

compared to irrelevant TCR transgenic T cells (OVA-specific) (Supplemental Fig. 2A). We next

187

performed quantitative histocytometry to assess the intrapulmonary location of pS6 expression

188

by CD4 T cells. At D10, there were significantly more pS6+ CD4 T cells in the lungs of

189

immunized mice compared to controls (Fig. 4A-B, Supplemental Fig. 2F). Surprisingly, few of

190

these cells were located near infected cells (Fig. 4A, 4D, Supplemental Fig. 2B-E). Thus,

191

although BCG induces early T cell recruitment and activation, at D10 this occurs primarily in

192

uninfected areas of the lung, which may be due to Mtb antigenic export from infected to

193

uninfected antigen-presenting cells (17). Taken together, the activation of BCG-induced CD4 T

194

cells, which occurs distal to sites of infection, shapes immunity to Mtb challenge earlier than

195

previously appreciated by facilitating the pulmonary recruitment of MDM and accelerating the

196

transfer of Mtb from AM to other myeloid cells. This transfer likely influences the ability of the

197

BCG-immunized host to control Mtb, as prior studies have shown that tissue-resident vs.

198

recruited macrophages differ profoundly in their capacity to control Mtb replication (13, 14).

199

Future studies are needed to elucidate the overall impact on protection because the settings in

200

which distinct macrophage types mediate enhanced immunity remain unclear.

201
202

Interestingly, BCG-induced CD4 T cells only begin to curb Mtb replication at D14, when they

203

finally co-localize with cells harboring Mtb, as evidenced by the identification of many pS6+ T

204

cells at sites of infection compared to controls (Fig. 4C-D). This is consistent with the finding

205

that optimal immunity against Mtb requires direct interactions between antigen-specific CD4 T

206

cells and Mtb-infected cells (21). Why do T cells and Mtb-infected cells not co-localize earlier?

207

The AM is the first cell type to become infected and remains the primary infected cell type for at

208

least a week (12). During this time, the immune system appears largely unaware of the looming

209

threat, as few MDM or PMN are recruited to the lung. The recent finding that AM infection is

210

non-inflammatory and poorly induces chemokines may help explain the covert nature of early

211

infection (Rothchild, A.C. et al. 2019. bioRxiv: 520791). Furthermore, the replication and spread

212

within the AM population, a process associated with cell death of infected macrophages and

213

phagocytosis by other macrophages, likely involves apoptosis, as necrotic cell death is associated

214

with chemokine release and recruitment of MDM/PMN (19). Perhaps vaccine-induced T cells

215

that express receptors for apoptotic “find-me” signals could co-localize with infected AM and

216

exhibit earlier Mtb control compared to BCG-induced T cells, which may not express such

217

receptors (20). Together, these results further our understanding of the features of pulmonary

218

Mtb dissemination in the context of BCG, which could aid rational vaccine design to effectively

219

complement BCG.

Figure 4: BCG-induced CD4 T cells are initially activated distal to the site of Mtb infection.

330

Quantitative histocytometry was used to identify the location of CD4 T cells (blue) and pS6 +

331

CD4 T cells (green) relative to infected cells (red) in lung sections at D10 (A) and sites of

332

infection at D14 (C). (B) Number of pS6+ CD4 T cells per mm2 of lung at D10 as determined by

333

quantitative histocytometry (n=2-3 mice/group). (D) Number of pS6+ CD4 T cells within 80 μm

334

of an infected cell (n=2 mice/group). This cutoff was based on the limit of IFNg diffusion within

335

tissue (21). Single-group comparisons were performed by unpaired t test. Data are presented as

336

mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
