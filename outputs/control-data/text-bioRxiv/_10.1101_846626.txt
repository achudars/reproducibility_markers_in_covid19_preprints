Abstract

22

Despite evidence of augmented Natural Killer (NK) cell responses after influenza vaccination,

23

the role of these cells in vaccine-induced immunity remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that

24

NK cells might increase viral clearance but possibly at the expense of increased severity of

25

pathology. On the contrary, we found that NK cells serve a homeostatic role during influenza

26

virus infection of vaccinated mice, allowing viral clearance with minimal pathology. Using a

27

diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model, we were able to specifically deplete NKp46+

28

NK cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin. Using this model, we assessed the effect

29

of NK cell depletion prior to influenza challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. NK-

30

depleted, vaccinated animals lost significantly more weight after viral challenge than vaccinated

31

NK intact animals, indicating that NK cells ameliorate disease in vaccinated animals. However,

32

there was also a significant reduction in viral load in NK-depleted, unvaccinated animals

33

indicating that NK cells also constrain viral clearance. Depletion of NK cells after vaccination,

34

but 21 days before infection, did not affect viral clearance or weight loss - indicating that it is the

35

presence of NK cells during the infection itself that promotes homeostasis. Further work is

36

needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which NK cells regulate adaptive immunity in influenza-

37

vaccinated animals to allow efficient and effective virus control whilst simultaneously

38

minimizing inflammation and pathology.

Introduction

40

Influenza viruses are a significant cause of respiratory tract infections, leading to seasonal

41

epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Globally, influenza affects approximately 20-30% of

42

children and 5-10% of adults, resulting in 3-5 million cases of severe illness with up to 500,000

43

deaths, annually (WHO, 2014). The very young, old, and immunocompromised are at greatest

44

risk of succumbing to severe illness and death (Lewis, 2006). Currently, vaccination with live-

45

attenuated or inactivated influenza virus is the most effective method for reducing infections at

46

both the individual and population level (Cox and Subbarao, 1999;Ting et al., 2017).

47

Although adaptive immune responses play a key role in the resolution of influenza infection,

48

innate immune responses play an essential role in restricting virus replication and thus limiting

49

the scale of the initial infection (Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014). Amongst other innate immune players,

50

Natural Killer (NK) cells can kill virus-infected cells and help to orchestrate nascent adaptive

51

immune responses (White et al., 2008). Defects in NK cells are associated with increased

52

susceptibility to viral infections (Biron et al., 1989;Orange, 2002). NK cell killing is mediated by

53

cell surface cytotoxicity receptors (such as the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and

54

NKp46) binding to viral components or stress-induced ligands on the surface of virus-infected

55

cells, leading to directed release of granzyme- and perforin-containing cytotoxic granules and/or

56

Fas/Fas-ligand interactions (Smyth et al., 2005). Additionally, cytokine (particularly interferon

57

(IFN)-γ) production by NK cells plays an integral role in shaping adaptive immunity (Vivier et

58

al., 2008;Wagstaffe et al., 2018). For example, NK-derived IFN-γ can activate dendritic cell

59

migration, thus promoting T cell priming (Ge et al., 2012). Evidence for the importance of NK

60

cells in influenza virus infection comes primarily from studies in mice, although conclusions vary

61

depending on the precise model employed (Table 1). For example, depletion of NK cells with

62

anti-asialo GM1 antibody in mice and hamsters resulted in increased morbidity and mortality

63

from influenza A virus infection (Stein-Streilein and Guffee, 1986). In addition, influenza

64

infection is lethal in mice lacking the NK cell specific receptor NKp46 (NCR1) (Gazit et al.,

65

2006), which has been reported to be a receptor for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein

66

(Arnon et al., 2001;Mandelboim et al., 2001). Conversely, others have reported that NK cell

67

deficiency (whether through depletion with anti-asialo GM1 or anti-NK1.1, or due to a lack of

68

interleukin (IL)-15) reduced weight loss and increased survival (Nakamura et al., 2010;Abdul-

69

Careem et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2013). Moreover, little is known regarding the role of NK cells in

70

vaccine-induced immunity to influenza. We set out, therefore, to address the role of NK cells

71

during acute influenza infection, before and after vaccination, using diphtheria-toxin (DT)

72

mediated ablation of NK cells in genetically modified mice in which NKp46 expression drives

73

expression of the DT receptor. Given that IL-2 produced from influenza-specific T cells is

74

dependent on the NK cell driven IFN-γ response in early influenza infection (He et al.,

75

2004;Wagstaffe et al., 2018), we hypothesized that NK cell ablation would impair viral clearance

76

and increase disease severity.

C57BL/6J and C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(HBEGF)Awai/J mice were purchased from Jackson

85

Laboratories via Charles River (Tranent, UK). C57BL/6-NKp46:iCre+/+ mice were kindly

86

provided by Professor Eric Vivier (Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Institut

87

Universitaire de France, France). C57BL/6-Rosa26iDTR+/+ and C57BL/6-NKp46:iCre+/+ mice

88

were crossed to generate F1 NKp46-iCre/Rosa26iDTR+/- (referred to as NKp46-DTR). Groups of

89

NKp46-DTR mice were age- and sex-matched for all experiments, with influenza challenge

90

occurring between 8 and 10 weeks of age. Both sexes of the F1 generation were used in this

91

study, with 68 female and 106 male NKp46-DTR mice being used in total. The sexes of mice

92

used in each experiment are shown in the figure panels ({M} male, {F} female) and figure

Egg grown influenza A/California/4/2009 virus was kindly provided by Dr. John McCauley

97

(Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre, The Francis Crick Institute, London UK) at 128

98

hemagglutination units (HAU)/mL and stored at -80°C until use. For infections, mice were

99

anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) and

100

then inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 30 μL of virus (0.5 HAU) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-

101

buffered saline (DPBS) (Gibco, Loughborough UK). Mock-treated control mice were inoculated

102

similarly with DPBS. Mice were monitored and weighed daily to assess infection and euthanized

103

at day 4 post-infection (p.i.), or if they reached the humane endpoint of 20% loss of body weight

104

at an earlier time point. Twenty eight days prior to challenge, some mice were vaccinated by i.p.

107

including A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like strain NYMC X-179A), diluted 1:3 in DPBS

108

with 500 μL per mouse with a final dose of 5 μg of each HA.

109

Depletion of NK cells

110

For selective depletion of NK cells, NKp46-diphtheria toxin receptor (NKp46-DTR) mice were

111

injected i.p. with 1.25 μg DT (diluted in 100 μL DPBS) on days 25 and 28 post-vaccination.

112

Alternatively, mice were injected once with 2.5 μg DT and allowed to recover for 3 weeks prior

113

to influenza challenge. Control (mock depleted) NKp46-DTR mice were injected i.p. with 100

114

μL DPBS.

115

Isolation of lung cells and viral supernatant

116

Lungs were aseptically removed from euthanized mice and stored in 5 mL DPBS on ice until

117

processing. Lung single-cell suspensions were obtained using methods previously described

118

(Sauer et al., 2007). Briefly, isolated lungs were cut into 2-3 mm2 sections and resuspended in 5

119

mL digestion solution of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 Medium (Gibco)

120

supplemented with 5 mM GlutaMax (Gibco), 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and 1% (v/v)

121

Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (10,000 units/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough

122

UK). Digestion solutions contained DNAseI (20 μg/mL) (Roche, Basel Switzerland), and

123

LiberaseTM (0.2 digestion units/lung) (Roche). The lung suspensions were digested at 37°C for

124

60 minutes with gentle rotating and then processed on a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi,

125

Surrey UK). Lung homogenates were then sieved through a 40 μm nylon filter to remove debris

126

(BD Biosciences, Berkshire UK) and sieve washed with 5 mL DPBS. After centrifugation, an

127

aliquot of lung supernatant was frozen at -70°C for downstream viral qPCR and IL-6 protein

128

ELISA. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 5 mL ACK Lysis Buffer (Lonza, Edinburgh UK),

129

washed and resuspended with DPBS for flow cytometry.

131

Cells were stained in 96-well U-bottom plates as described previously (Mooney et al., 2015).

132

Briefly, cell suspensions were stained with antibodies to cell surface markers, fixed

133

(Cytofix/Cytoperm; BD Biosciences) and stained for intracellular markers. Antibodies and dyes

134

used for flow cytometry staining are shown in Table 2. Cells were acquired on an LSRII flow

135

cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FACSDIVA software. Data were analyzed using FlowJo V10

136

(Tree Star). Gates were initially set on singlets, followed by leukocytes (removing high SSC-A

137

and low FSC-A) and live cells. Subsequent gates were based on unstained and/or FMO controls.

138

Viral burden determination

139

Influenza burden in lung-purified ribonucleic acid (RNA) was determined by one-step

140

quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the HA gene, as

141

previously described (Lam et al., 2010). RNA was isolated from 500 μL of frozen lung cell

142

supernatant (PureLink Viral RNA Mini Kit, Thermo). As a standard, RNA was isolated from

143

stock virus (128 HAU/mL) and diluted 1:5 starting from 2.3 HAU equivalents per well. Purified

144

RNA (5 μL of 25 μL elution) was mixed with 5 μL of TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix

145

(Thermo), 7 μL of ultra-pure water, and 1 μL each of forward primer SWH1-1080 (0.8 μM,

146

GATGGTAGATGGATGGTACGGTTAT),

147

TTGTTAAGTAATYTCGTCAATGGCATT), and probe SWH1-1128 (0.25 μM, FAM-

148

149

2min; 40 cycles of 95°C, 15 sec and 60°C, 30sec, on a 7900HT Fast RT-PCR system (Applied

150

Biosystems, Loughborough UK). For viral burden from whole lung tissue, 500 ng of purified

151

RNA (as reported below) was assayed in the same manner as above.

152

RNA analysis from tissue

156

homogenization. RNA was then treated with DNAseI (Ambion) to remove genomic

157

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contamination. For a quantitative analysis of messenger RNA

158

(mRNA) levels, 1μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed in a 20 μL volume

159

(SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix; Thermo), and 2μL of complementary DNA (cDNA) was

160

used for each real-time reaction. RT-qPCR was performed using the primers listed in Table 3,

161

SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) and 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).

Plasma analysis

166

Plasma was isolated by centrifugation of whole blood taken via cardiac puncture into a

167

heparinized syringe and stored at -70°C. Plasma IL-6 levels were determined by sandwich

168

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Biolegend ELISA MAX Deluxe, London UK).

169

Values below the blank were reported at the limit of detection for statistical purposes. To

170

determine circulating influenza HA antibodies following influenza vaccination, a direct ELISA

171

was done. Here, flat MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with the vaccine

172

(diluted 1:3000 in DPBS, or 0.01 μg/mL HA) or live virus (1.28 HAU/mL) at 100 μL. Using a

173

commercial ELISA reagent kit (eBioscience catalogue number BMS412, Loughborough UK),

174

plates were washed three times and blocked for 1 hour with 200 μL of assay buffer. After

175

washing, 100 μL of serially-diluted plasma was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours.

and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by the University of Edinburgh Easter Bush

185

Pathology Laboratory and scored, in a blinded fashion, for inflammation (vasculitis,

186

bronchiolitis, and alveolitis), oedema (perivascular oedema, peribronchiolar oedema, and alveolar

187

oedema), leukocyte infiltration (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and in alveolar walls) and

188

neutrophil infiltration (perivascular, peribronchiolar, and in alveolar walls). Each criterion was

189

scored numerically as unremarkable (0), mild (1), mild to moderate (2), moderate (3), moderate

Influenza vaccination reduces weight loss and viral burden in mice.

201

To characterize the role of NK cells in influenza infection and immunization, we established a

202

model of acute influenza infection in C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 1). C57BL/6J mice were infected i.n.

203

with 0.5 HAU of influenza strain A/California/04/2009. Infected mice developed an acute

204

infection, losing 20% of their body weight by 4 days post-infection (Fig. 1A). Mice were also

205

vaccinated, intraperitoneally with the human Sanofi-Pasteur-MSD inactivated trivalent influenza

206

vaccine (split-virion), four weeks prior to influenza challenge. Vaccinated mice lost significantly

207

less weight (Fig. 1A) and had lower viral burden in their lungs (Fig. 1B) compared to

208

unvaccinated mice; the reduction in influenza burden in the lung correlated with reduced weight

209

loss (Fig. 1C).

210

Acute influenza infection was marked by a significant increase in the frequency of CD11b+ cells

211

in the lung, with a decrease in proportions of T (%CD3+) and B cells (%CD19+) (Fig. 1D). The

212

frequency of NK cells, identified by NK1.1 and NKp46 co-expression (Walzer et al., 2007;Zhou

213

et al., 2013), did not change after influenza infection (Fig 1D). However, there was a significant

214

increase in the side-scatter (SSC) of the NK cell population (Fig. 1E), indicating increased

215

activation (Brady et al., 2004;Skak et al., 2008;Marçais et al., 2014) and expression of NKp46, an

216

activating NK cell receptor reported to bind influenza-derived HA (Gazit et al., 2006;Achdout et

217

al., 2010;Glasner et al., 2012), was also increased in infected animals. Lastly, there was a

218

significant increase in the frequency of NK cell activation marker CD69 (Fig. 1E). Together,

219

these results suggest that the immune response to acute influenza infection, whether in a naïve or

220

vaccinated animal, is characterized by an influx of CD11b+ cells and activated NK cells.

221
222

Depletion of NK cells prior to influenza challenge reduces lung virus burden but increases

223

weight loss in vaccinated mice.

224

To evaluate the contribution of NK cells to vaccine-induced protection from influenza infection,

225

transgenic mice (NKp46-DTR) were selectively depleted of NK cells by injection of DT (Fig.

226

2A) three days before infection. DT treatment resulted in a robust depletion of NK cells from the

227

lung (Fig. 2B) but did not change circulating antibodies established by vaccination (Fig. 2C).

228
229

Depletion of NK cells prior to influenza challenge infection led to a significant decrease in

230

influenza burden in the lung, regardless of vaccination status (Fig. 2D). Viral burden was 2.9 fold

231

higher in naïve NK cell-intact mice than in naïve NK cell-depleted mice (p=0.002) and 2.6 fold

232

higher in vaccinated NK cell-intact mice than in vaccinated NK cell-depleted mice (p=0.007)

233

(Fig. 2D). However, infected NK-depleted animals lost more weight in the 4 days post infection

234

compared to NK-cell sufficient mice (Fig. 2E, male, and Fig. 2F, female). While unvaccinated

235

mice reached their humane endpoint of 20% weight loss by 6 days post infection, vaccinated

236

animals lost only 5% of their body weight and recovered to pre-infection weights by day 8 (Fig.

237

2G). However, vaccinated and infected animals which lacked NK cells had prolonged weight loss

238

which was more severe (10%) than in NK cell-intact vaccinated mice (5%) and recovered to

239

baseline only by day 14 (Fig. 2G).

240
241

Reduction of IFN-γ with influenza and NK cell depletion.

242

Given that vaccinated NK cell-depleted animals lost more weight than vaccinated NK cell-intact

243

animals despite a lower viral burden (Fig. 2), we next looked at inflammatory markers in the lung

244

and plasma. In agreement with data from lung supernatants (Fig. 2D), viral burden determined

245

from whole lung RNA preparations was significantly lower after NK cell depletion in

246

unvaccinated animals (p=0.002), and not in vaccinated animals (p=0.08) (Fig. 3A). While Il6 and

247

Ifnγ expression were increased with influenza infection (Fig. 3B), regardless of vaccination status

248

and viral burden (Fig. 3A), transcripts of Ifnγ were lower in NK cell depleted mice than in NK-

249

intact mice (naïve p=0.004, vaccinated p=0.057).

250
251

Given that neutrophil influx into an influenza-infected lung can enhance viral control (Dienz et

252

al., 2012), but can also contribute to tissue damage through the release of extracellular traps

253

(Narasaraju et al., 2011), we wondered whether increased neutrophil activity in NK cell-depleted

254

mice might explain our findings. We therefore determined transcript levels of neutrophil

255

chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2) and neutrophil secreted protein Lcn2 but found no significant

256

differences in transcript concentrations between NK cell-deficient and NK cell-intact animals

257

(Fig. 3C). Lastly, we assessed circulating levels of IL-6 (which have been implicated in

258

neutrophil-mediated effects (Dienz et al., 2012)) and found a tendency towards lower plasma IL-

259

6 concentrations in both vaccinated and unvaccinated NK-depleted mice compared to NK cell-

260

intact mice (vaccinated p=0.15, unvaccinated p=0.06) (Fig. 3D), reflecting lower transcript levels

261

in the lung (Fig. 3B). At the protein level in whole lungs after enzymatic digestion, IL-6 is lower

262

in unvaccinated NK-depleted mice but not in vaccinated mice (vaccinated p=0.74, unvaccinated

263

p=0.05) (Fig. 3E).

vaccinated NK cell-depleted mice compared to NK cell-sufficient mice (Fig. 2), we examined the

268

lungs for histological evidence of pathology. H&E stained lung sections were assessed for

269

pulmonary inflammation (vasculitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis), edema (perivascular,

270

peribronchiolar, and alveolar), and infiltrating lymphocytes and neutrophils (perivascular,

271

peribronchiolar, and alveolar) (Fig. 4; see Supplementary Table 1 for individual mouse data).

272

Influenza infection alone induces severe pathology (Fig. 4). Reduced viral load after vaccination

273

was accompanied by reduced pulmonary leukocyte influx (p=0.024), with a trend for reduced

274

pulmonary inflammation (p=0.065) and edema (p=0.09). NK cell depletion per se (i.e. in the

275

absence of infection) induced mild lung pathology with evidence of inflammation (p=0.008) and

276

leukocyte infiltration (p=0.006). However, after influenza infection, pathology was significantly

277

less severe in NK-depleted mice compared to NK cell-sufficient mice (inflammation p=0.04,

278

leukocyte infiltration p=0.048). Interestingly, while weight loss was more severe in vaccinated

279

and influenza challenged NK-depleted mice than in NK cell-sufficient mice, pathological

280

changes in the lungs were not significantly different between the two groups of mice (Fig. 4).

281
282

Finally, we quantified infiltrating leukocytes and neutrophils in the lung by flow cytometry (Fig.

283

5). Influenza infection led to an infiltration of activated (CD69+) CD3+ T cells into the lung; this

284

was not affected by NK-depletion but was attenuated in vaccinated mice (Fig. 5A). There were

285

no obvious effects of infection or vaccination on CD19+ B cell populations in the lung; the

286

modest apparent increase in B cell proportions in NK cell-depleted mice may simply reflect

287

distortion of cell percentages by the absence of NK cells (Fig 5B). However, given that influenza

288

infection increases the influx of CD11b+ cells into the lung (Fig. 1D), we further characterized

289

influx of both inflammatory monocytes (%Ly6C-high) and neutrophils (%Ly6G+) in the lungs of

290

NK-depleted mice. The modest reduction in leukocyte infiltration in the lung that was evident

291

from histology (Fig. 4), was reflected in reduced infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the

292

lung in vaccinated NK cell-sufficient animals compared to unvaccinated animals (p=0.005) and

293

in infected NK cell-depleted animals compared to NK cell intact animals (p=0.002) (Fig. 5C) but

294

there was no additional effect of combining vaccination and NK cell depletion (p=0.99).

295

Neutrophil infiltration into the lung was also reduced by vaccination in NK cell intact mice (p =

296

0.007) but in this case, the effect was reversed by NK cell depletion such that neutrophil

297

infiltration was higher in vaccinated NK cell-depleted mice than in vaccinated NK cell intact

298

mice, p=0.03 for proportion of neutrophils (Fig. 5D) and p=0.06 for absolute counts (data not

299

shown), and correlated with weight loss (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these data suggest that the

300

increased weight loss observed with influenza infection in NK cell-depleted vaccinated mice

301

compared to NK cell intact vaccinated mice may be due, in part, to failure of NK cell-depleted

302

mice to control neutrophil infiltration into the lungs, despite reduced viral burden.

303
304

Depletion of NK cells after vaccination, and subsequent repopulation, does not alter the

305

response to influenza challenge in mice.

306

To determine if the effects of NK cell depletion on post vaccination immunity to influenza were

307

mediated by NK cells present at (and potentially affected by) vaccination (Goodier et al., 2016),

308

we depleted NK cells (by a single treatment with 2.5 μg of DT) 3 weeks after influenza

309

vaccination (as previously) but then waited another 3 weeks before challenging the mice (to

310

allow repopulation) (Fig. 6A). NK cells were initially (after 3 days) very effectively depleted by

311

the DT treatment and, as predicted, the NK cell compartment did partially recover by the time of

312

influenza challenge (Fig. 6B). In this case, removal of NK cells present at vaccination and

313

subsequent NK cell repopulation resulted in influenza infections that were not significantly

314

different from those in intact mice, with no significant differences in disease severity (weight

315

loss; Fig. 6C), lung viral load (Fig. 6D) or circulating IL-6 concentrations (Fig. 6E). This

316

experiment suggests that the effects of NK cell depletion on post vaccination immunity are due to

317

the lack of all NK cells, rather than a lack of NK cell populations that were primed or activated

318

by vaccination.

322

The key findings of this study, summarized in Fig. 7, are that: (1) influenza vaccination is

323

effective in reducing viral burden and weight loss in mice; (2) in both vaccinated and

324

unvaccinated mice, NK cells ameliorate disease (weight loss) at the expense of delaying viral

325

clearance; (3) that the magnitude of the effect on disease is greater in vaccinated than

326

unvaccinated mice (2.5-fold greater weight loss vs 1.11-fold, respectively), and (4) the depletion

327

of any ‘memory’ NK cells that might have been induced by vaccination did not alter the response

328

to influenza virus in vaccinated mice. These data suggest that NK cells play an important

329

homeostatic role, allowing influenza virus to be controlled without causing severe disease, and

330

that this effect is enhanced by vaccination – indicating a role for NK cells in regulating the

331

adaptive immune response. Our study therefore supports previous data suggesting an important

332

role for NK cells in moderating adaptive immune effector mechanisms (Pallmer and Oxenius,

333

2016).

334
335

Previous work has suggested that the role of NK cells during influenza infection is dependent on

336

the infecting dose of the virus, with NK cells being protective during low dose infection (0.5

337

HAU) and pathogenic during high dose infection (5 HAU) (Zhou et al., 2013). Although we used

338

the A/California/4/2009 strain of influenza rather than PR8 strain used by Zhou et al, we used an

339

infecting dose that is similar to the low dose used by Zhou et al. (0.5 HAU) and saw a similar

340

trend. Interestingly, an opposite effect was seen during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)

341

infection where NK cells prevented pathology at high viral doses but enhanced disease at low

342

doses (Waggoner et al., 2011). In our study, NK cell-depleted unvaccinated male mice lost

343

significantly more weight than intact mice after infection (Fig. 2E); however this effect was not

344

seen in female mice (Fig. 2F) suggesting that NK cells moderate disease severity differently in

345

male and female mice despite the two sexes having similar viral loads. Regardless, in NK-dell

346

depleted and vaccinated mice we saw significant weight loss in both sexes (Fig. 2E and 2F),

347

suggesting that sex differences are ablated by vaccination.

348
349

The mechanisms by which NK cells moderate adaptive immune responses are not fully

350

understood. Our observation that NK cell depletion tended to increase neutrophil influx into the

351

lungs of influenza infected mice, and significantly increased neutrophil accumulation in lungs of

352

vaccinated mice, suggests that NK cells may serve to limit neutrophil migration to sites of

353

infection. This would be in line with studies showing that neutrophils are important in controlling

354

influenza virus infection (Tate et al., 2008;Tate et al., 2009;Tate et al., 2011) but can contribute to

355

severe pulmonary pathology (Tumpey et al., 2005;Perrone et al., 2008;Feng et al., 2015).

356
357

Another possibility is that NK cells regulate the accumulation of adaptive, cytotoxic (CD8+)

358

effector T cells at the site of infection, thereby reducing tissue damage but slowing viral

359

clearance. In RSV infection, for example, CD8+ cells are directly associated with weight loss and

360

depleting them reduces disease (Tregoning et al., 2008). NK cells have been shown to eliminate

361

activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in different model systems (Waggoner et al., 2011;Lang et al.,

362

2012;Pallmer and Oxenius, 2016), mediated by either perforin or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing

363

ligand (TRAIL) (Peppa et al., 2013;Schuster et al., 2014). However, thus far, in influenza

364

vaccination models CD8+ T cells appear to contribute to both reduced viral load and reduced

365

disease severity (Lambert et al., 2016). Unfortunately, we did not determine CD8 T cell

366

responses in this current study and therefore further work is needed to determine whether the lack

367

of NK cells removes the brake on adaptive T cell responses during influenza infection.

369

In a recent study (Zamora et al., 2017), murine NK cells licensed on self MHC were shown to

370

localize to infected lung tissue and produce IFN-γ after influenza A (strain PR8) infection.

371

Unlicensed NK cells, in contrast, were enriched in draining (mediastinal) lymph nodes, produced

372

GM-CSF and promoted dendritic cell infiltration and CD8+ T cell responses. It is therefore likely

373

that distinct subsets of NK cells may selectively promote inflammation or antiviral immunity.

374

Furthermore, this may differ depending on levels of adaptive immunity.

375
376

In humans, memory-like NK cells can be generated by cytokine or influenza virus pre-activation;

377

these cells show enhanced responses to cytokines or influenza virus upon re-stimulation

378

(O'Sullivan et al., 2015;Goodier et al., 2016;Wagstaffe et al., 2018). It is conceivable that prior

379

activation of NK cells, for example by vaccine-induced inflammatory cytokines, could influence

380

the migration and function of these cells upon viral challenge. Certainly, human nasal challenge

381

with Fluenz induces a local (nasal mucosal) innate cytokine signature with potential NK cell

382

activating capacity (Jochems et al., 2018). Nevertheless, we wondered whether a similar

383

phenomenon might also be apparent in this mouse model (where more precise dissection of the

384

underlying local mechanism of NK cell enhancement might be possible). Therefore, we depleted

385

NK cells immediately after vaccination (thus removing any putative ‘memory’ NK cells, defined

386

as cells with altered function after prior exposure), and rested the mice for three weeks to allow

387

repopulation before challenging with influenza virus. We observed no differences in the outcome

388

of influenza infection between these NK cell-depleted/repopulated vaccinated mice and intact,

389

vaccinated mice. These data suggest that “memory” NK cells are not induced by influenza

390

vaccination in mice or that any such cells are no more effective at moderating adaptive responses

391

to influenza than are “naïve” NK cells. In mice, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells can be

392

adoptively transferred and maintained by homeostatic proliferation (Keppel et al., 2013), but have

393

to date not been demonstrated after influenza vaccination. Human studies have been limited to

394

peripheral blood and further investigations are needed to test how NK cells influence

395

inflammatory cellular infiltrates at the site of virus infection. Vaccination and challenge studies

396

(with local mucosal sampling for virus, cellular infiltrates and cytokine production) are now

397

needed to reveal the impact of vaccine-induced NK cell priming and “memory” generation on

398

virus replication and pathology.

399
400

There are some important caveats to keep in mind, however. Firstly, in contrast to previous

401

studies using mice lacking NK cells at the time of infection or vaccination, or depleted of NK

402

cells with antibodies on animals of different sexes (Table 1), we used an inducible, endogenous

403

method of NK cell depletion which may have fewer limitations (Walzer et al., 2007).

404

Nevertheless, DT treatment alone lead to some limited weight loss and pulmonary pathology,

405

likely due to death of approx. 15% of lung leukocytes, although there was no induction of

406

inflammatory cytokines nor any influx of immune cells into the lung. It remains a possibility,

407

therefore, that the mild inflammation induced by NK cell depletion may have affected the

408

outcome of the experiments. Further, sex differences in influenza-mediated lung pathology have

409

been noted (Klein et al., 2012). Secondly, the ethically-approved humane end point for our study

410

was deemed to be 20% weight loss (after which animals were euthanized), essentially precluding

411

determination of long-term survival after NK cell depletion but some studies have shown only

412

limited correlation between weight loss and long term survival (Abdul-Careem et al., 2012), with

413

viral challenge dose a greater predictor of survival despite similar weight loss kinetics (Zhou et

414

al., 2013). A further caveat of the Rosa-DT conditional ‘NK cell’ depletion system used here is a

415

potential parallel depletion of mature NKp46+ ILC1 and ILC3 cells (Cortez et al., 2015). Studies

416

in deficient ncr1gfp mice, which are susceptible to lethal influenza A infection, demonstrate

417

systemic loss of ILC1, whilst maintaining NKp46 negative NK cell subsets (Gazit et al.,

418

2006;Wang et al., 2018). Although rare in the non-pathologic lung, our studies do therefore not

419

exclude a potential contribution of ILC-1s to inflammatory processes after influenza vaccination

420

or challenge infection. Lastly, characterization of cytokine protein levels in the bronchoalveolar

421

lavage fluid would be beneficial in understanding transcriptional changes observed in this study.

422
423

To summarize, we have demonstrated that NK cells play a homeostatic role in adaptive immunity

424

to influenza infection in mice. While the precise mechanism by which NK cells modulate

425

adaptive immunity remains unclear, their presence is crucial for resolving infection with minimal

426

immune pathology. Further studies to determine the mechanism(s) at play may inform the design

427

of safer and more effective influenza vaccines.

Figure 7. Summarized model of changes seen with influenza vaccination and challenge with

NK cell depletion. (A) Influenza virus infection in naïve mice results in robust lung pathology,

characterized by interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA and inflammatory monocytes (%Ly6C-high) influx

722

with rapid weight loss at 4 days post infection. (B) Vaccination with the human Sanofi trivalent

723

influenza vaccine reduces lung viral burden, pathology and monocytes with minor weight loss

724

(4%). (C) In unvaccinated, naïve animals which were infected with influenza, NK cell depletion

725

reduced viral burden, IFN-γ mRNA, pathology, and monocyte influx. However, these mice still

726

progressed to 20% weight loss by day 4 post infection. (D) In vaccinated mice which were

727

lacking NK cells, influenza virus burden was reduced even further and robust IFN-γ from

728

vaccination now lower, yet total pathology score was similar to NK intact mice – however with

729

PMNs now increased in frequency in the lung by flow cytometry. Despite a reduced viral burden,

730

these animals showed sustained weight loss at 11%. Model created with BioRender.
