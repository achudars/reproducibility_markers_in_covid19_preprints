ABSTRACT
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic
syndrome recognized as the most prevalent chronic liver disease across all age groups. NFLD is strongly
associated with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidemia. Extensive research efforts are
geared, through pharmacological approach, towards preventing or reversing this. Erythrina abyssinica

Lam ex DC is an indigenous tree used widely used in traditional medicine, including for the
treatment of liver related diseases, and has been shown to possess hypoglycemic, anti-oxidant,
antimicrobial and anti-plasmodia effects. The present study is aimed at establishing the effects of
E. abyssinica on the development of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease induced by a high-fat and
high-sugar diet in rats, in-vivo model.
Methods: Forty rats (40) were randomly divided into five groups: positive control (pioglitazone),
Negative control (high fat/high sugar diet), low test dose (200 mg/kg), high test dose (400 mg/kg)
and normal group (standard chow pellets and fresh water).
The inhibitory effect of the stem bark extract of E. abyssinica on the development of NAFLD was
evaluated by chronic administration the herb extracts to rats on a high-fat/high-sugar diet.
Biochemical indices of hepatic function including serum lipid profile, serum aspartate
transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were then determined. Histological analysis of liver
samples was carried out to quantify the degree of steato-hepatitis. Liver weights were taken and
used to determine the hepatic index. The data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and Tukey’s
post-hoc tests were done in cases of significance. Histology data was analyzed using KruskalWallis and Dunn’s post-hoc test was done in cases of significance. Significance was set at p<0.05.
Results: The freeze dried extract of E. abyssinica had significant effects on fasting blood glucose
[5.43 ± 0.17 (HF/HSD) vs 3.8 ± 0.15 (E 400 mg/kg) vs 4.54 ± 0.09 (E 200 mg/kg) vs. 4.16 ± 0.13

value < 0.0001],
The extract had significant effects on hepatic indices including, hepatic triglycerides (P value <
0.0001), liver weights (P value < 0.0001), liver weight-body weight ratio (P value < 0.0001),
serum ALT levels (P value < 0.0001), serum AST (P value < 0.0017), serum total cholesterol
(P value < 0.0001), serum triglycerides (P value < 0.0001), and serum LDL-cholesterol (P value
< 0.0001). The extracts however showed no significant effects on HDL-cholesterol (P value =
0.4759).
Histological analysis showed that the extract appears to possess protective effects against steatosis,
inflammation and hepatic ballooning, with the high dose (400mg/kg) being more hepatoprotective.

Conclusion:

The freeze dried stem bark extract of Erythina abyssinica possesses significant inhibitory effects
against the development of NAFLD in Sprague Dawley rats.

1.0 Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by excessive
accumulation of hepatic fat (primarily triacylglycerols) that occurs in the absence of secondary
causes such as alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication and steatogenic hereditary
disorders[1–4] . This condition which has a prevalence of between 6% and 35% globally may often
progress to hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma and is the leading cause of chronic liver
disease worldwide [2,3].
Although initially recognized as being primarily as a hepatic disorder, NAFLD is now
known to affect multiple organs in the body such as the heart, kidneys and endocrine organs, and
is a major risk factor in chronic diseases affecting these organs [5–8]. More pertinently, NAFLD
is now recognized as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome with the majority of
NALFD patients having some, if not all, features of this syndrome [2,9,10]. Indeed, longitudinal
studies suggest that NAFLD precedes development of both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
metabolic syndrome [6,8,11]. Unfortunately, no pharmacological treatment has been shown to
reverse the natural history of NAFLD with current treatment regimens focusing mainly on exercise
and dietary modifications [12,13].
This study investigated the effects of the chronic administration freeze dried extracts of
Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex DC (a plant species which has several medicinal uses in African
communities and possesses demonstrated hypoglycemic and cytotoxic effects) in preventing the
development of NAFLD in Sprague Dawley rats. The NALFD was induced by chronically feeding
the rats a high fat/high sugar diet containing monosodium glutamate.
The freeze-dried stem bark extracts of Erythrina abyssinica Lam Ex DC significantly
decreased biochemical and histological markers associated NAFLD namely: fasting blood

glucose, insulin resistance, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol, serum ALT, hepatocellular
ballooning, micro-vesicular steatosis and lobular inflammation. The freeze-dried extracts of
Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex. DC therefore significantly inhibited the development of NAFLD in
Sprague Dawley rats.

2.0 Materials and Methods
The study was conducted in the Department of Medical Physiology, University of Nairobi.
2.1 Plant Collection and Extract Preparation.
The stem barks of Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex DC were harvested from trees growing in
Kitui County, Kenya and the identity of the collected plant specimens verified by the staff of the
university herbarium located at the School of Biological Sciences, University of Nairobi and a
voucher specimen deposited therein (EA2016). The plant parts were air dried for ninety-six hours
after which they were milled into a fine powder at the Department of Chemistry, University of
Nairobi.
The weight of the resultant powder was then measured using an analytical scale. The
powder was then macerated in water in a ratio of 1:10 (weight: volume) and left to stand for one
(1) hour. The resulting suspension was then sequentially filtered using cotton wool and
Whatmann’s® filter paper to obtain the filtrate which was then placed in a standard laboratory
freezer overnight. The filtrate was then lyophilized, and the resulting freeze-dried extract weighed
and placed in amber colored sample bottles and stored within a laboratory freezer until when
required for administration to the experimental animals.
2.2 In vivo experiments.
Forty (40) freshly-weaned (4 week old) Sprague-Dawley rats (twenty female and twenty
male) weighing between thirty to fifty grams were randomized into the normal control (normal
diet and distilled water), negative control ( high fat/ high sugar diet only), the positive control (high
fat/high sugar diet plus pioglitazone ), low dose test (high fat/ high sugar diet plus 200mg/kg freeze

dried extract of Erythrina abyssinica and high dose test (high fat/high sugar diet plus 400mg/kg
freeze dried extracts of Erythrina abyssinica) groups.
The experimental animals were housed at the animal house located within the Department
of Medical Physiology University of Nairobi. The following were the conditions maintained within
the animal house: at a room temperature of 23.2°C, relative humidity of 60+/- 10 with twelvehour light/dark cycles. They were habituated for two weeks prior to the start of the study and were
fed standard chow pellets ad libitum during this period.
The high fat/ high sugar diet was prepared by the addition of 20% w/w saturated fat
(Cowboy™ manufactured by Bidco™ industries) to standard rat chow which contained protein
29.82%, fat 13.43% carbohydrates 56.74%, fiber 5.3%, vitamins and minerals small quantitiesppm (Unga™ Feeds) to ensure that the pellets delivered approximately 30% of calories as fat.
Sucrose on the other hand was added to drinking water to make up a 30% sucrose solution.
Monosodium glutamate (MSG) was added to the pellets to make up 0.8% of the pellets to increase
the palatability of the pellets [14] . The resulting high-fat/high sugar diet contained 30% fat and
30% sucrose in water.
All the animals received diets ad libitum and the extracts/treatments were administered via
oral gavage.
2.3 Ethical approval
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was
approved by the bio-safety, animal use and ethics committee Department of Veterinary
physiology, University of Nairobi (REF: FVM BAUEC/2016/111 ) In addition, the experimental

design obeyed the 4Rs (reduction, replacement, refinement and rehabilitation) of ethical animal
experimental design [15,16] .
2.4 Assay of fasting blood glucose
Assay of fasting blood glucose was performed in the manner described by Lee and
Goossens [17]. Briefly blood was sampled from the lateral tail vein after a six hour fast. The tail
was warmed by dipping in warm water for five (5) minutes to cause vasodilation of the vein and
therefore ease visualization and blood sample collection. The blood glucose was determined using
a glucometer (Nova Biomedical) and recorded.
2.5 Insulin tolerance test
Insulin tolerance tests were performed on Days 21, 42 and 56. The insulin tolerance tests
were performed according to the protocol by Bowe [18]. Briefly the experimental animals were
fasted for six (6) hours. They were thein weighed after which soluble insulin (Humulin S™ Eli
Lilly USA) was administered by an intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.75IU/kg. The blood
glucose levels were then assayed at regular time intervals after the administration of the insulin as
described in 3.2.2. (at time 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes). A 50% Glucose
solution was made available to prevent fatalities due to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (i.e. if blood
glucose levels ≤1.1 mmol/L). The animals would be withdrawn from the procedure if this
happened and the glucose solution administered via oral gavage. The areas under the curve
(AUCs) for the respective rats were then calculated and then recorded.
2.6 Assay of serum biochemistry
The procedure for determination of the serum biochemical parameters was as follows: the
rats were fasted overnight on the last day of the study (day fifty-six) and then sacrificed under

euthanasia using pentobarbital. The absence of the Pupillary light reflex was used as a confirmative
marker of death. Five (5) milliliters of blood were harvested from each using cardiac puncture.
The collected blood was then centrifuged to obtain serum which was then assayed for the following
biochemical parameters: fasting serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and total
cholesterol, aspartate transaminase (AST) land alanine transaminase. The assays were performed
at the Clinical Chemistry laboratory, Kenyatta National Hospital.
2.7 Assay of hepatic triglycerides.
A midline abdominal incision was performed after the rats were euthanized and the liver
tissues excised. The respective livers were then weighed using an analytical balance and the
weights recorded. The respective liver tissues were each divided into two unequal portions with
the larger portion weight: smaller portion weight ratios being 2:1. The smaller portions were used
in the hepatic triglyceride assay while the larger portions were used in the histological studies.
The smaller portions were stored in a laboratory freezer and then later homogenized with
phosphate buffer acting as the liquid medium. The resulting liquid homogenates were then used to
determine hepatic triglyceride content using the protocol previously described by Butler et.al [19].
2.8 Liver histology
The larger portions of the harvested liver tissues were preserved in 10 % neutral
formaldehyde. Sections (4 mm² in size) were later fixed in PAF and embedded in paraffin. These
sections were further sliced to 5 µm and stained with H/E stain for evaluation of hepatic steatosis.
Liver tissues were scored according to the grading system introduced by [20] for NAFLD:
Steatosis: Grade 1 < 33 % steatotic hepatocytes, Grade 2 < 33% to 66% steatotic hepatocytes,
grade 3 > 66% steatotic hepatocytes in a X 200 microscopic field of view.

Hepatocellular ballooning: Grade 1- minimal zone 3, Grade 2 – present zone 3, Grade 3- marked
predominantly zone 3.
Lobular inflammation: 0- absent, grade 1 <2 foci of inflammation, grade 2: 2-4 foci, grade 3 > 4
foci.
Portal inflammation 0 –absent, grade 1 – mild, grade 2- moderate, grade 3-severe.
Stages of fibrosis: stage 1: zone 3 peri-sinusoidal fibrosis, stage 2-focal or extensive periportal
fibrosis, stage 3- bridging fibrosis, stage 4-cirrhosis.

2.9 Statistical analysis
The experimental data were expressed as Mean ± S.E.M. and analyzed using One-way ANOVA
and Tukey’s post-hoc tests carried out in cases of significance (set at p<0.05) using Graph Pad
Prism™ software version 6. The semi-quantitative histological data were analyzed using the
Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post-hoc tests were carried out in cases of significance which was also
set at p<0.05.

3.0 RESULTS
3.1 Extract preparation
The stem barks of Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex DC were harvested from trees growing in Kitui
county, Kenya. The plant parts were air dried for forty-eight hours. The dried parts were then
milled at the Department of Chemistry, University of Nairobi. The weight of the resultant
powder was measured using an analytical scale. The powder was mixed in a ratio of 1:10 with
water in a flask and swirled severally before being left to settle. The mixture was then filtered
using cotton wool and Watmann® filter paper to obtain a crude extract solution which was
frozen and lyophilized at ICIPE Nairobi, Kenya.
The percentage yield of the extract was 3.4% (885.3g of plant powder yielded 29.88g of extract)

dose) (P = 0.0399). There were significant differences between the normal control and low dose
test groups (P < 0.0001) as well between the normal control and the high dose test groups (P =

4.0 Discussion
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a wide range of hepatic changes, ranging from
simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma and is one of the most common chronic liver disorders worldwide [1,3,5]. It is
associated with diverse clinical conditions including but not limited to obesity, renal failure,
osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, hypothyroidism, male infertility among others
[5,6,8,21–25]. Current therapies for this condition however remain unsatisfactory underscoring the
need for discovering new efficacious treatments for this condition [12,13,26].
Various animal models that aim to mirror both the histopathology and the pathophysiology of each
stage of human NAFLD have been developed [27,28]. Indeed, selection of the appropriate animal
model remains an important consideration in experimental design. We used a modified high
fat/high sugar diet which was prepared by the addition of 0.8% monosodium-glutamate to a
standard high-fat/high sugar diet. High-fat/high-sugar diets (“cafeteria diets”) are a popular animal
model for the induction of NAFLD and are normally administered chronically over a period of
six to sixteen weeks [29]. However, high-fat/high-sugar diets administered ad-libitum normally
have the limitation of reduced food consumption compared to normal rat chow and this has been
attributed to reduced palatability and satiety induction in the cafeteria diets [30]. Monosodium
glutamate is a dietary tastant that confers the umami flavor to food and has been previously shown
to increase food consumption was therefore added to the diet.
The NALFD model used in this study reproduced the serum biochemical and histological
(steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular injury) features of NAFLD [27] showing that the
model possessed both construct and ecological validity and can therefore be used experimentally
in the evaluation of anti-NAFLD therapies.

This study investigated the effects of the chronic administration of the freeze-dried stem bark
extracts of Erythrina abyssinica on the development of NAFLD. This plant species finds extensive
application in traditional medicine and is used in the preparation of health tonics by the Maasai
community of East Africa [31,32]. In addition, this plant is shown to be rich in flavonoids, a group
of natural products known to be efficacious in the management of NAFLD and other metabolic
syndrome conditions [33–36].
The freeze-dried stem bark extracts of Erythrina abyssinica displayed potent dose-dependent
antihyperglycemic effects in rats chronically fed a high-fat/high-sugar diet. Previous studies have
shown that plant species belonging to this genus including the species that is the subject of this
study possess antihyperglycemic activity [37,38]. The freeze- dried extracts of Erythrina
abyssinica also possessed significant effects on insulin sensitivity. This was a significant finding
in our opinion since insulin resistance is regarded as the most important pathophysiological
mechanism of NAFLD [10,39]. In addition, it is also known that insulin resistance is one of the
multiple hits determining the progression from NAFLD to non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH)
[10,20,40]. It can therefore be seen that the extract can potentially prevent the establishment of, as
well as slow the progression of NAFLD via the positive effects on insulin resistance.
There several putative mechanistic explanations for the observed effects on blood glucose levels
as well as the insulin resistance. Benzo furans and Coumestan which possess agonist activities on
AMP Kinase (AMPK) have been isolated from this plant species [41]. Activation of this enzyme
is an attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic
disorders [42]. Indeed leading diabetic drugs such as metformin and rosiglitazone mediate their
metabolic effects partially through AMPK activation [42–44] .

In addition, fifteen pterocarpan derivatives which possess inhibitory effects on protein tyrosine
phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) have been isolated from the stem bark of this plant species [33,38].
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of the leptin and insulin signaling
pathways and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes [45]. The inhibition
of this enzyme can therefore be expected to have beneficial effects in obesity, diabetes as well as
NAFLD. This observation is supported by the fact that mice with the whole body deletion of
PTP1B were protected against the development of obesity and diabetes [45,46].
The freeze-dried extracts possessed significant anti-dyslipidemic effects i.e. lowering plasma totalcholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides. This was an important finding in our
opinion. This is because NAFLD is characterized by atherogenic dyslipidemia, postprandial
lipemia and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) dysfunction which are established risk factors for both
cardiovascular and liver disease [47,48]. A possible mechanistic explanation for the observed antidyslipidemic affects is the AMP kinase inhibition described previously. It is known that AMPkinase phosphorylates and inactivates the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP1)
which has been implicated in the hepatic accumulation seen in NAFLD via its effects on lipid
biosynthesis, LDL receptor biosynthesis and de novo cholesterol biosynthesis [49].
The freeze-dried stem bark extracts of Erythrina abyssinica significantly reduced hepatic lipid
deposition as shown by the reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations, liver weights and liver
weight-body. These hepatic indices have been shown to be increased in NAFLD as well as in
insulin resistance [50]. This was also a key finding in our opinion since according to the “two-hit”
hypothesis on the pathophysiology of NAFLD, the hepatic triglyceride deposition is the first hit
while the lipotoxicity that accompanies this deposition leads to hepatic injury and inflammation
marks the second hit [51].

The extract of Erythrina abyssinica had significant effects on the serum alanine amino-transferase
levels (ALT) which are a recognized marker of hepatocellular injury. Indeed, several
epidemiologic association studies have shown that this enzyme is elevated in, and consequently
can be used as a biomarker of NAFLD [52–54].
The extract significantly prevented the development of Histopathological evaluation of the liver
showed prevention of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular injury. These effects were
especially marked in the higher dose test group (400 mg/kg). It can therefore be seen that the results
of the histopathological examination agree with those of the hepatic enzymes assay: i.e. that the
extracts prevent the development of hepatic injury despite the chronic administration of a high
fat/high sugar diet for eight (8) weeks.
Conclusions and future directions
The freeze-dried extracts of Erythrina abyssinica had significant protective effects against the
development of NAFLD in this study and show potential as a prophylactic against the development
of this condition. These beneficial actions can be attributed to the rich variety of chemical
compounds found in this plant species which have been shown to have positive effects in metabolic
syndromes, cardiovascular disease and other conditions associated with aging [33,35,38,41,55].
The results of this study also validate the traditional use of this plant species as a tonic for the
maintenance of good health.
