Abstract

12

The TRPV1 cation non-selective ion channel plays an essential role in thermosensation and perception of

13

other noxious stimuli. TRPV1 can be activated by low pH, high temperature or naturally occurring

14

pungent molecules such as allicin, capsaicin or resiniferatoxin. Its noxious thermal sensitivity makes it an

15

important participant as a thermal sensor in mammals. However, details of the mechanism of channel

16

activation by increases in temperature remain unclear. Here we used a combination of approaches to try

17

to understand the role of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) in channel behavior. First, a computational

18

modeling approach by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of the whole TRPV1 embedded in

19

a phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) membrane provides insight into

20

the dynamics of this channel domain. Global analysis of the structural ensemble shows that the ankyrin

21

repeat domain is a region that sustains high fluctuations during dynamics at different temperatures. We

22

then performed biochemical and thermal stability studies of the purified ARD by means of circular

23

dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence and demonstrate that this region undergoes structural changes

24

at similar temperatures that lead to TRPV1 activation. Our data suggest that the ARD is a dynamic

25

module and that it may participate in controlling the temperature sensitivity of TRPV1.

Statement of Significance

27

This work demonstrates that the temperature-dependent dynamics of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)

28

of TRPV1 channels, as probed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics, corresponds to the experimentally

29

determined dynamics of an isolated ARD domain. These results show that this region of TRPV1 channels

30

undergoes significant conformational change as a function of increased temperature and suggest that it

31

participates in the temperature-dependent structural changes that lead to channel opening.

Introduction

36

TRPV1 is a non-specific cation channel implicated in nociception by chemicals, temperature, and pH (1–

37

3). This channel is one of the chemosensors involved in the sensation of pain and thermal stimuli and it

38

participates in a diverse range of cellular processes (2, 4). The latter has been evidenced from studies

39

where deletion of TRPV1 in mice alters noxious and mild temperature sensation (5, 6), while knock-out

40

of other thermoTRPs such as TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4 shows little effects in sensory transduction in

41

rodents (6–8). Moreover, while deletion of TRPV1 in rodents does not affect corporal temperature,

42

blockage of TRPV1 in vivo triggers hyperthermia (9).

43

The rat TRPV1 structure is a tetramer (Fig. 1a), with every monomer consisting of 838 amino acids (Fig.

44

1c). The structure solved by cryo-EM is from a minimal-functional TRPV1 that lacks 100 amino acids from

45

the N-termini and 80 amino acids in the C-termini and which is also missing a longer S5-pore

46

extracellular loop named the turret. This minimal-functional 586 amino acid construct provides a model

47

for the full-length channel, although without unfolded loops. In TRPV1, the structure of the membrane-

48

embedded domains is canonical with other ion channels like voltage-gated potassium, sodium and

49

calcium ion channels. A tetramer is formed by a voltage sensing domain (VSD)-like domain, surrounding

50

a pore formed by the contribution of the four pore domains (PD) of each subunit.

51

The C-terminus of TRPV1 has been shown to be functionally important. Several modulating lipids, such

52

as PIP2 and LPA bind in this region (10, 11). In the cryo-EM structures, the alpha helix after the S6

53

transmembrane segment is well defined and is known as the TRP-box; it is a conserved domain in almost

54

all the members of the TRP family. In all the solved structures for TRPV1 (12–14), TRPV 2 (15), TRPV3

55

(16), TRPV4 (17), TRPV5 (18) and TRPV6 (19), the TRP-box is folded in the same manner. In the case of

56

TRPV1, Cryo-EM experiments show that the TRP-box displays a conformational change when the

57

channel is bound to capsaicin (13), or resiniferatoxin and double-knot toxin (DkTx) together (13), similar

58

to what happens in TRPV2 sensitized by 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl Borate (2-APB) (15). Until now the

59

structure of the distal part of the C-terminus remains unknown, but there is some evidence that it is

60

located near the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), and that these two structures may undergo intradomain

61

interactions (20).

62

The ARD and the membrane proximal domain (MPD), a structure located between the ARD and the first

63

transmembrane segment, have a non-canonical interaction only seen in TRP channels. A “finger” loop

64

from ANK4 touches the MPD at a recognition site in a neighboring subunit (Figure 1a and Sup. Fig. 1)

65

(12, 19). Although some of the functions of these domains are still not known, others have been well

66

characterized and include the direct interaction of the ARD with calmodulin (18, 21) and the possible

67

participation of the MPD in heat activation (22). Thus, the ARD and MPD are functional regulatory

68

domains and it should be noted that, before the first cryo-EM structures for TRP channels were

69

obtained, the intracellular domains were visualized as individual and not interconnected domains.

70

Thanks to structural analysis, today we know that the intracellular domains of TRPV ion channels, form

71

tetramers and that coupling between these domains regulates channel function (19, 23). In this context,

72

the overall nature of ARD interactions is poorly understood, but some evidences correlate with the

73

notion that they play a leading role in the functional mechanism of the channel (21, 24). For example,

74

there is some evidence of the ARD contributing to gating by selective oxidation of intracellular cysteines

75

present in the ARD (3, 25). Additionally, a complex formed by TRPV5 and calmodulin was solved

76

Recently (18). This interaction can be of interest since it also exists in TRPV1 and other members of the

77

family and it is located between C-termini and the ARD.

78

To further study the role of the ARD in TRPV1 we studied the integral relationships between ARD

79

function and channel gating. For this purpose, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics of the

80

whole TRPV1 channel embedded in a POPC/POPE membrane and also performed experiments with the

81

purified ARD in solution, making use of the thermal shift unfolding, circular dichroism, and tryptophan

82

fluorescence measurements. We find that the ARD is a dynamical domain and that these dynamics are

83

modulated by temperature in a way that might be relevant to activation by temperature.

Methods

85

Model Preparation

86

The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a minimal-functional rat TRPV1, solved at 3.4 Å

87

resolution, was used as initial coordinates to perform coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (PDBID:

88

3J5P) (12). The missing loops and side chains were built in the Swiss Modeler web server (26, 27). To

89

generate our model, the server used the whole channel model (12) and the transmembrane cryo-EM

90

structure solved in nanodiscs (14). The repaired TRPV1 structure was prepared for coarse-graining by

91

means of the Martinize.py (28) program. A 20 nm per side, square POPC/POPE (coarse-grained)

92

membrane was prepared in CHARMM-GUI (29), the channel model was embedded into the membrane

93

using Pymol scripts written in-house. The TRPV1-POPC/POPE structure was prepared for molecular

94

dynamics (MD) simulation in the Gromacs 4.5 Suite (30, 31). The model was minimized and solvated

95

with CG water and surrounded by 30 mM NaCl ions. A 200 ns NVT equilibration dynamics with a

96

Berendsen Thermostat was performed before the production run (28, 30).

97

Structural comparison

98

Composite alignment was performed for cryo-EM models of open and closed states of TRPV1 and TRPV3

99

ion channels using the TopMatch Server (32). A blue to red gradient was used to represent root-mean

100

square deviation (RMSD) divergence in structural alignments. The Pymol module colorbyrmsd.py was

101

used for coloring.

102

Molecular Dynamics Simulations

103

We used coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to characterize the dynamics of the

104

ion channel in the membrane. We simulated the initially repaired APO model (PDBID: 3J5P) at various

105

temperatures varying from 290 K to 350 K (17 °C to 77 °C) sampling every 5 K. The structure of TRPV1

106

was embedded in a POPC/POPE bilayer with a MARTINI force field; several equilibrating simulations with

107

temperature coupling were performed, and then an equilibrating simulation with pressure and

108

temperature was performed until the RMSD was stable at 298 K (28). A production run at 290 K was

109

sampled as an initial structure. From a stable point in a 290 K run, thirteen replicas were prepared. The

110

RMSD corresponds to the mean of the whole protein main-chain over the whole simulation time and the

111

root-mean square fluctuation (RMSF) corresponds to the mean of a single amino acid position over time.

112

Both were calculated with Gromacs 4.5. The output trajectories were used as input for Normal Mode

113

Analysis (NMA). This analysis was performed in bio3D for the four subunits (33). Production runs were

115

the National Autonomous University of México (UNAM).

116

ARD expression and purification

117

The DNA sequence encoding for the ARD of rat TRPV1 (residues 100-262) was cloned into a pET28c

118

vector (Merck-Millipore, USA). For expression, the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain (NewEngland

119

Biolabs, USA) was transformed with this vector. Batch cultures of transformed cells were grown in Luria

120

Bertani broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to an OD of 0.7-0.8, protein expression was then induced with

121

Isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside 0.1 mM (GoldBio, Canada) for 12 h at room temperature. The cell

122

pellet was lysed in Tris 50 mM, pH 8, dithiothreitol 0.1 mM, NaCl 300 mM (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The

123

lysate was purified by Histrap FF columns (GE Healthcare) with an imidazole gradient from 0 to 0.5 M.

124

The eluted protein was concentrated and desalted in a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) against a Tris 50

125

mM, pH 8, dithiothreitol 0.1 mM buffer. Then, the protein was injected into a cation exclusion

126

chromatography column (MonoQ) and eluted against Tris 50 mM, pH 8, dithiothreitol 0.1 Mm buffer

127

with an increased linear gradient from 0-1 M of NaCl. The final step was a size exclusion

128

chromatography in a hand-made 275 mL Superdex 75 Column (Dimensions 2.50 x 60 cm, GE

129

Healthcare). ARD concentration was determined using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 1.21

130

L/mg·cm obtained using the ProtParam Expasy WebServer (34) and by bicinchoninic acid assays with

131

reduction compatible reagents (Pierce Chemicals, USA).

132

Thermal Shift Unfolding

133

Assays were prepared in a 96 well plate for real-time PCR; each well was prepared with 1 µL of SYPRO

134

Dye 1X (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1 µL of 1mg/mL solution of pure ARD, and 1 µL of solubility and stability II

135

kit (Hampton Research, USA), water was added to fill 10 µL per well. A real-time thermocycler

136

QuantStudio 3 (ThermoFisher, USA) was used for collecting data from 20 to 80 °C, sampling every 1 °C.

137

The data were exported and analyzed in IgorPro 6 (WaveMetrics, USA).

138

Size Exclusion Chromatography - Multiple Angle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS)

139

The SEC-MALS analysis was performed on a DAWN HELEOS multi-angle light scattering detector, with

140

eighteen angles detectors and a 658.9 nm laser beam, (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and

141

an Optilab T-rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technology) in-line with a Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE Life

143

isocratic pump (Agilent) with a flow of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature (25°C). Data collection was

144

performed with ASTRA 6.1 software (Wyatt Technology). For the experiments, 300 μl at 1 mg/ml protein

145

were loaded on the columns with running buffer of 20 mM glycine pH 9.5, 200 mM NaCl. The molecular

146

weight (MW) and the ratio of gyration (Rg) were calculated by the ASTRA software.

147

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy

148

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was carried out in a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter with a 1 mm

149

path length cuvette, the sample was prepared at 250 µg/mL in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Samples

150

were heated at a 0.5 K min-1 rate with a Peltier device (JASCO). A thermal unfolding curve was generated

151

by measuring a spectrum for every step. CD data were analyzed in custom-made scripts and plotted with

152

Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics, USA). Normalized ellipticity data obtained at 208 nm were fitted to the

Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy

156

Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were obtained in a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., USA) configured with

157

a 10 W halogen lamp as the excitation source. All samples were prepared at 50 µg/L. Tryptophan

158

fluorescence spectra were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, emission spectra were

159

collected from 310 to 400 nm, using excitation and emission slits of 0.25 and 1 mm respectively. The

160

temperature was controlled with a Peltier device (Quantum Northwest). Normalized intensity at 330 nm

161

and SCM data (see below) were fitted to Eq. 1.

162

The fluorescence spectral center of mass (SCM) was obtained from each spectrum and plotted as a

Cytosolic domains of TRPV1 fluctuate more at higher temperature

It is generally assumed that TRPV1 is formed by a cluster of functional domains (Fig 1c), each with a set

168

of specific interactions. The ARD, MPD and TRP-Box domains are intracellular. Several groups have found

35) and no more than one hundred amino acids from the C-terminus can be deleted without rendering

171

the channel non-functional (35) .

172

As an initial point in our research to understand the behavior of TRPV1 as a function of temperature, we

173

carried out coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures using a full-length

174

model of TRPV1 embedded in a phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine (POPC/POPE) lipid

175

membrane (Fig. 1a). The initial model was derived from the closed TRPV1 structure (PDBID: 3J5P) solved

176

by cryo-EM (12). The model was simulated for 200 ns in temperature-controlled conditions (NVT) for

177

stabilization and then 200 ns of pressure and temperature controlled conditions (NPT) with Berendsen

178

thermostat and pressure coupling (see Methods). The simulations were equilibrated until the channel

179

was in a stable RMSD state, from that point on, 12 replicas were simulated at 290, 295, 300, 305, 310,

180

315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345 and 350 K. At these temperatures independent runs of 500 ns were

181

simulated to sample for an adequate time in order to observe critical large-scale structural transitions.

182

In figure 1b, we represent the RMSF of a single subunit of the whole TRPV1 tetramer. Temperatures

183

from 290 to 350 K were sampled and averaged; each point is the average of RMSF of a particular residue

184

for all the temperatures. The variance (s2) of the mean RMSF is plotted as a measure of dispersion from

185

0 to 0.26. The mean RMSF for all the subunit is 0.27 ± 0.22; 0.45 ± 0.21 for the ARD and 0.40 ± 0.21 for

186

the ARD + MPD. The RMSF deviation, which correlates the fluctuation per amino acid during the

187

trajectory of the dynamics, shows that there are some regions that fluctuate more than others as the

188

temperature is increased. The regions with well-defined secondary structure have less movement and

189

the loops and less structured chains move more (Figure 1b). The transmembrane region of the channel

190

has smaller magnitude movements in relation to the cytosolic part; this is likely due to the two-

191

dimensional restriction of the lipid membrane. Interestingly, the data shows that the mean RMSF greatly

192

increases in the N and C-termini, even though these are regions with well-defined secondary structure.

193

All the N-terminus (ARD + MPD) shows a significant increase in main movement as temperature rises.

194

The ankyrin motifs (ANK) are represented in Fig 1a. ANK1 and ANK2 are not solved in the cryo-EM

195

structure (Supplemental Fig. 1c) and in our analysis these repeats presented a large average RMSF of

196

0.66 and the highest variance per amino acid, above 0.20. While the C-terminus also has a high value of

197

temperature-dependent RMSF, for the purpose of this study, it will not be discussed.

198

Protein dynamics and inter-subunit interactions of TRPV1

199

In order to study the coarse-grained dynamics of TRPV1 and provide a quantitative interpretation of the

200

simulations, we performed normal mode analysis (NMA), (36, 37). We identified a first mode in which

201

the ARDs undergo alternate up-and-down movements. Figure 2a and b shows the structure at two

202

different stages of the oscillation. The arrows indicate the direction of the movement of each of the

203

coarse-grained beads. The bottom panels show a view from the intracellular region of the channel. This

204

normal mode represents more than 70% of the movements of each trajectory and this is seen at all the

205

simulated temperatures.

206

Fluctuation analyses were performed from the trajectories by means of the greater NMA eigenvectors

207

(33). Figure 2c shows the fluctuation analysis of the 290 K trajectory depicted from the same normal

208

mode from 2a and 2b. It can be seen that the highest values of the fluctuations occur at the ankyrin

209

repeats one and two and the fluctuations extend into the whole ARD.

210

A deformation displacement analysis was performed from the NMA; this is obtained by the averaged

211

values of each individual mode, and by measuring the contribution of each backbone bead to the energy

212

density as a function of position (36). This analysis provides information on the correlation between

213

regions with high deformation and regions that are most affected by this deformation. Figure 2d shows

214

that the regions with higher deformation are the ARD and that the regions with highest correlation with

215

the deformation of the ARD is the MPD. This is a reflection of the physical interactions between these

216

two domains but also means that the conformational changes in one domain are transmitted to the

217

other in the interaction pair.

218

Comparision of Molecular Dynamics Trajectory with CryoEM Structures

219

The structures of closed and open TRPV1 were compared by means of composite alignment. In contrast

220

to rigid body alignment, this method allows the part-by-part alignment leaving out the regions without

221

structural match.

222

The structure of TRPV1 in the apo, closed-like state (PDBID: 2J5P), the capsaicin-bound (CB) structure

223

(PDBID: 2J5R) and an open-like structure bound to the activating double-knot toxin (DkTx) and

224

resiniferatoxin (RTX) (PDBID: 2J5Q), were analyzed. First, the published DkTx/RTX toxin-bound structure

225

(TXB) has a selectivity filter in an expanded open conformation (13) while the CB structure only shows

226

an increase in the diameter of the lower gate (12, 13) (Supplemental figure 2). The closed-like

227

conformation has similarity with both TXB and CB structures; in supplemental figure 2 we show that the

228

closed structure is similar to CB in the upper part of transmembrane domain, as well as in the selectivity

229

filter. The TXB structure has a wide-open selectivity filter but this structure is similar in the lower part of

230

the transmemebrane domain, S6 helix and TRP-box domain to the CB structure. TRPV3 closed (PDBID:

231

6DVW) and open (PDBID: 6DVY) structures were also analyzed for comparison (Supplemental Fig 2c).

232

The composite alignment of open vs. closed TRPV3 is closer to CB-TRPV1 vs. closed TRPV1 (23),

233

(Supplemental Fig 2a and 2c). Closed TRPV1 and open TRPV3 are not comparable, but the composite

234

alignment between structures has many similarities and importantly the ARD domain presents a high

235

RMSD.

236
237

The conformation of the ARD shows a thermal dependency at physiological temperature.

238

The simulation data illustrates that the intracellular domains of TRPV1 undergo conformational changes

239

at temperatures that are relevant to the physiological activation of the channel. The region that shows

240

the largest mobility is the ARD, a 260 amino acid region in the N-terminus of TRPV channels. In TRPV1,

241

the ARD is implicated in adenosine triphosphate binding, Ca2+-calmodulin modulation and regulation by

242

cysteine oxidation (3, 21, 25, 38). In the whole channel, the ARD has several complex interactions with

243

the pre-S1 region (MPD, 90 amino acids) in the same subunit, and a characteristic ARD-MPD interaction

244

with the adjacent subunit (Fig 1a and 1c) (12). The ARD also has an interaction with the distal C-

245

terminus, this region is not well solved in TRPV1 cryo-EM structure but in TRPV2 and TRPV3 it is (15, 16).

246

The functional significance of these interactions remains unknown.

247

As a first approximation to study the biophysical properties of the N-terminus, we purified an ARD from

248

rTRPV1 and screened its stability by a thermal shift assay (Figure 3), utilizing several pH and salt

249

concentration conditions (see Methods). Figure 3a shows the fluorescence signal from the dye SYPRO

250

orange as a reporter of the thermal unfolding process. SYPRO emits a fluorescence signal by binding to

251

hydrophobic regions exposed during unfolding. The fluorescence signals show a characteristic sigmoid

252

dependence on temperature, which is a feature of a two-state unfolding process in soluble proteins. To

253

characterize the cooperativity of the change in fluorescence, the first derivative was calculated for every

254

trace (Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c).

255

The data show that the first derivative of the fluorescence increases linearly as a function of pH. The

256

data in Figure 3a, inset, indicate that the cooperativity of the unfolding of the ARD is highest at basic pH,

257

as the value of the derivative increases as pH increases. The inset in Fig. 3b shows that additionally to

258

the increased cooperativity, the domain becomes more stable, since the Tm value, defined as the

259

temperature at which the derivative is maximal, shifts to higher temperatures. Next, the dependence on

260

salt concentration was analyzed for the pH 9.5 condition. In Figure 3c we show the data for glycine

261

buffer (pH 9.5) and several NaCl concentrations. The steepness of the fluorescence change is higher at

262

low salt concentrations and the Tm decreases with increasing salt concentration, with a slope of -0.05

263

and a change in Tm from 36 to 38 °C. The behavior of ARD in glycine buffer (pH 9.5) was also studied by

264

SEC-MALS to control for its possible oligomeric assembly. The experiment shows that the ARD is

265

monodisperse in these conditions (Supplementary figure 3).

266

Significantly, these series of experiments indicate that the thermal transitions of the isolated ARD occur

267

in a range of temperatures that is rather narrow (Tm = 36-38 °C for the most stable condition) and very

268

close to the physiological temperature of mammals.

269
270

Stability of the ARD in solution

271

Since SYPRO thermal shifts are mostly qualitative, we compared the thermal sensitivity of the ARD by

272

means of tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) experiments. Figure 4a shows far-UV CD

273

spectra (200 to 240 nm) of ARD obtained at increasing temperatures (see methods for details). The CD

274

spectrum at 25°C is consistent with the high alpha helical content of the ARD structure. The shape and

275

ellipticity of individual spectra changes as temperature is increased, indicating the presence of thermal

276

unfolding of the ARD.

277

Since the main CD signal is due to a macro dipole formed by the sum of dipoles of all the secondary

278

structures, the decrease of ellipticity is characteristic of a random array of secondary structures, even

279

when a single alpha helix does not have cero signal. In the case of the ARD, the loss of signal can be

280

associated to an increase of mobility between motifs. To characterize the change in CD, we normalized

281

the signal at 208 nm and plotted it as a function of temperature (Fig. 4b). The unfolding occurs with a

282

very steep dependence on temperature, with a Tm of ~34 °C, which is in agreement with the Tm observed

283

in the thermal shift experiments. We attempted to measure the reversibility of the unfolding reaction;

284

this result is plotted as blue circles in figure 4b and shows that thermal unfolding of the ARD is

285

irreversible. In comparison, the closest ARD previously studied is from the hTRPV4, which has a Tm of

286

37.1 °C measured by CD but its reversibility was not tested (38).

287

Thermal unfolding was also measured by tryptophan fluorescence experiments. The ARD has an

288

exposed Trp at position 272 of the ANK4 repeat. Excitation of this Trp at 295 nm and measurement of

289

the fluorescence at 330 nm as a function of increasing temperature shows an increase in the

290

fluorescence counts (Fig. 4c). The fluorescence increases (dequenching) in a temperature dependent

291

manner and a sigmoid function was fitted with a Tm of 39.7 oC (Fig 4d). A more robust analysis of Trp

292

fluorescence dequenching is provided by a spectral center of mass analysis (SCM), which takes into

293

account the contribution of the whole emission spectrum (39). This analysis is shown in the inset in

294

figure 4d and indicates that the Tm value obtained from the fit is Tm of 34.9 oC, which is closer to the Tm

295

obtained from the CD experiments.

296

Discussion

297

A defining characteristic of TRPV and other thermoTRP channels is the presence of several ankyrin

298

repeats in the N-terminus. Elucidation of their functional role has been a main objective of TRP channel

299

structure function studies. Others ARDs from different proteins show a variety of functions, from

300

replication/translation regulation to protein-protein interaction and ligand binding (40–42).

301

TRPV1 is one of the best-studied members of the thermoTRP channel subfamily. Notwithstanding the

302

wealth of available information, the mechanisms of heat sensitivity and heat-dependent activation

303

remain poorly understood. Several mechanisms of thermal sensing have been proposed: The

304

transmembrane regions could contribute with a significant heat capacity and serve as a thermal sensor

305

domains (43); the pore domain could act as a temperature sensing domain (44) and the intracellular

306

and transmembrane domains could act cooperatively to contribute to thermal sensation through a

307

mechanism involving a linker domain (22). In TRPA1 channels, the ARD, although much bigger than the

308

TRPV1 ARDs, have been implicated in temperature sensation.

309

Several TRPV1 structures determined by cryo-EM exist and are useful in interpreting experiments and

310

proposing new ones, but the quality of these structures is in general poor. All of them are missing

311

electronic density that should correspond to the initial ankyrin repeats of the ARD. Possible reasons for

312

this are: high density of side chain of the amino acids, presence of salt bridges or the loss of density near

313

Asp and Glu residues (45). Another possibility is higher mobility of this whole region of the protein

314

structure (Supplemental figure 1). Our coarse-grain MD simulations with a repaired model show that

315

indeed the amino terminus and, in particular the ARD, are highly dynamic regions. An important result

316

stemming from these simulations is that increased temperatures also modulate the high mobility of

317

ARDs. Experimentally, deletion of the ARD results in non-functional TRPV1 channels (12, 35), a result

318

that has hindered an understanding of the role of ARs in heat sensitivity and other forms of gating in this

319

channel. The ARDs are responsible for auto recognition, and probably an auto modulation mechanism

320

by self-interaction.

321

Our approach identifies the dynamics of the ARD of TRPV1 as important for the overall function of the

322

ion channel. The low frequency movement represented by the first normal mode identified in this study,

323

suggest that the ARD is a dynamical module that might contribute to the response of TRPV1 to

324

temperature. We propose that these fluctuations might be important in controlling temperature

325

dependent gating of TRPV1. At the very least, our results highlight the importance of the ARD and its

326

interactions with other parts of the channel in regulating channel gating.

327

The structure of the ARD of TRPV1 was previously solved by crystallography (46). Lishko et al. also

328

showed that basic pH is better for ARD purification (46). Also, there are some groups that report a brief

329

activation of the functional TRPV1 at basic pH (47).

330

Our data from CGMD simulations support a highly dynamical conformation of the ARD, and show

331

breaking of some contacts between the second and third AR motifs at higher temperatures. This kind of

332

perturbations may decrease stability of ARD as illustrated by the unfolding experiments in designed

333

ARDs (40, 48) and might contribute to a conformational change coupled to channel opening.

334

Our biochemical data provide experimental support for the fluctuations observed in the simulations.

335

Importantly, we observe conformational changes in the structure of the isolated ARD that occur at

336

physiologically relevant temperatures. Our results indicate that the structure of the ARD undergoes

337

important changes over a range of ~25oC. The CD data indicates that at 50 oC the structure is highly

338

altered, but still contains a significant amount of alpha-helical structure. This result might indicate that

339

the ARD is not completely unfolded into a random coil. An important observation is the fact that this

340

structure is not reversible. In accordance with this, we have recently shown that temperature-

341

dependent gating of full length TRPV1 is also irreversible and this irreversibility is reflected in a large

342

hysteresis during the activation processes (49). It is thus possible that the behavior of the ARD observed

343

here could be related to this irreversible gating process.

344

Some naturally occurring splicing variants of TRPV1 have been described. The ARD and MPD are part of

345

two different exons, and the splicing variants ARD-less and MPD-less express ion channels that are not

346

sensitive to temperature (50). In our simulations and structural analysis, it is observed that the distal

347

ARD (ANK1-2) approaches the MPD domain. This interaction is hard to measure by MD because it is

348

known that in this region a C terminal peptide forms a third beta strand of the MPD finger loop. Our

349

analysis of the correlations of fluctuation during a simulated trajectory also highlights this interaction.

350

Our data derived from NMA indicate that the regions that show highest correlated movement are

351

precisely the proximal ARD and the MPD.

352

The importance of the ARD-MPD interaction in TRPV1 function is also highlighted by experiments by Yao

353

et al., in which several TRPV1-MPD chimaeras were generated between rTRPV2, hTRPV2, mTRPV3 and

354

mTRPV4. All the chimeras increased the sensitivity to temperature. These results are consistent with the

355

ARD being in direct contact with the adjacent MPD, in such a way that its ability to interact with a viable

356

MPD might play a role in the capacity of the TRPV channels to being thermally sensitive.

357

In conclusion, structure-function studies and natural occurring variants of the N-terminus (ARD + MPD)

358

support its fundamental role for TRPV1 function. Our study contributes to an understanding of the

359

dynamics of ARD and suggests that it participates in the regulation of thermal sensing, although its

360

function as a thermal sensor or an element in temperature coupling remains to be elucidated.

Figure 1. Depiction of the all-atom model of TRPV1, derived from the 3J5P PDB structure. (a, left), side

501

view of TRPV1. The coloring of its domains is as follow: ARD, violet; MPD, yellow; VSD, cyan; PD, blue

502

TRP-box, red. The bilayer is represented as spheres. (a, right), the intracellular view of the channel is

503

represented with the same coloring code. Inter-subunit interactions are seen between MPD and ARD.

504

(b) Analysis of the structural fluctuations induced by temperature by RMSF of the beads that correspond

505

to main chain of each amino acid in coarse-grained MD. Averaged values were plotted as black dots. The

506

discontinuity in the PD corresponds to the turret loop, which is not resolved in the cryo-EM structure.

507

The ankyrin motifs have the greatest variance and RMSF are ANK1 and ANK2. All the ankyrin motifs are

508

numbered from 1-6. (c) Single subunit depiction, voltage sensor-like domain (VSD) and pore domain (PD)

509

are membrane embedded domains, ARD is fully cytosolic. The membrane proximal domain (MPD) has

510

complex interactions with ARD, VSD, TRP-box. The TRP-box is sandwiched between the MPD and VSD.

red arrows indicate the direction of movement. The subunits are numbered for clarity. (a) Domains 1

514

and 3 moved downwards while 2 and 4 are upwards. (b) Opposed domains moved upwards (1 and 3)

515

and downwards (2 and 4). The bottom panels show the intracellular view of the channel after a 90 °

516

rotation. (c) Fluctuations calculated by RMSF per bead relative to main chain. ARDs show the highest

517

values of fluctuations. Bottom panel, view of a 90° rotation of the channel. The scale represents the

518

value of the calculated fluctuation. (d) Deformation values of motion relative to neighbors. The MPDs

519

show the highest correlated movement with the ARD (pink color). The values were calculated with Bio3d

520

(see methods), (33, 36). The scale represents the calculated deformation values. The proximal ARD

521

(ANK3 to MPD) was highly correlated.

Figure 3. Thermal shift unfolding of ARD. (a) Representative raw SYPRO fluorescence signals obtained in

523

a real time thermocycler are plotted as a function of temperature. The lower panel shows the first

524

derivative of each signal. (b) First derivative (FD) plot (A.U./°C) of similar data as in (a) obtained at

525

different pH values. The melting temperature, Tm, was calculated as the temperature where the

526

maximum occurs. Inset shows the Tm of the ARD at different pH values. (c) Melting temperature Tm of

527

ARD in glycine buffer (pH 9.5) at different sodium chloride concentration. The inset shows the

528

dependence of Tm on the NaCl concentration.

530

(b) The normalized ellipticity change at 208 nm is plotted as a function of temperature. Data are mean

531

and s.e.m. for n = 3 experiments (black circles). The blue circles are the data from one experiment at an

532

attempt at refolding of the ARD by returning the temperature to 30 °C and indicate an irreversible

533

unfolding transition. The continuous curve represents a fit to a sigmoid function (slope 1.13 ± 0.14). The

534

value of Tm from the fit is of 34.2 °C ± 0.2 °C. (c) Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the ARD at the

535

temperatures indicated by the color scale. (d) The normalized fluorescence intensity increase for n = 3

536

experiments is plotted as the mean ± s.e.m. The continuous curve represents a fit to a sigmoid function

537

(slope 2.17 ± 0.10). The value of Tm from the fit of intensity data is 39.7 °C ± 0.1 °C. The SCM analysis is

538

shown in the inset. The parameters of the SCM fit are: slope 3.69 ± 0.13 and a Tm 35.0 ± 0.2 °C.

occupancies in the APO structure (3J5P), the missing occupancies vs. the CB structure are represented;

545

the APO structure is a reliable model for coarse-grained MD. (c) Ankyrin motifs 1 (ANK1) and 2 (ANK2)

546

do not show an electronic density in the 2J5P structure, this implies a low stability or high movement

547

even at cryogenic temperatures. The electron density is shown in blue, while the structure of the ARD

548

determined by X-ray diffraction is fitted to the density and show in ribbon representation. (d) Beta-

549

factor representation in putty cartoon of the crystallographic structure of the ARD in solution (PDBID:

550

551

have a good density (lower movement).

Supplemental Figure 2. Composite alignment of closed and open structures. (a) Root mean square

554

deviation of CB structure vs. closed structure of TRPV1 (3J5R/3J5P), the color code represents low to

555

high RMSD by the blue to red gradient plotted in Pymol. The gray areas are not aligned by the algorithm.

556

The values are represented over the CB structure; higher variations are seen in the cytosolic regions and

557

the ARD presents higher movement in ANK1 and ANK2. (b) Flexible alignment of DkTx and RTX bound

558

structure vs. closed structure (3J5Q/3J5P). The color code is as in (a). The RMSD is represented over the

559

DkTx+TRX -bound structure. Higher values are seen in ANK 1 and ANK2 and the inner region of the TRP-

560

box. (c) Alignment of the 2APB-bound structure of TRPV3 vs. closed structure of TRPV3 (6DVY/6DVW)

561

represented as in (a). The main changes are similar to CB vs. closed alignment in TRPV1 (a). The color
