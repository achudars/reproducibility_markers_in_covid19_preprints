Abstract

35

physical component of the cell wall, a target of mycobacterial specific antibiotics, and a

36

mediator of M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Mycolic acids are synthesized in the

37

cytoplasm and are thought to be transported to the cell wall as a trehalose ester by the

38

MmpL3 transporter, an antibiotic target for M. tuberculosis. However, the mechanism by

39

which mycolate synthesis is coupled to transport, and the full MmpL3 transport

40

machinery, is unknown. Here we identify two new components of the MmpL3 transport

41

machinery in mycobacteria. The protein encoded by MSMEG_0736/Rv0383c is

42

essential for growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, is anchored to the

43

cytoplasmic membrane, physically interacts with and colocalizes with MmpL3 in growing

44

cells, and is required for trehalose monomycolate transport to the cell wall. In light of

45

these findings we propose Msmeg_0736/Rv0383c be named “TMM transport factor A”,

46

TtfA. The protein encoded by MSMEG_5308 also interacts with the MmpL3 complex,

47

but is nonessential for growth or TMM transport. However, MSMEG_5308 accumulates

48

with inhibition of MmpL3 mediated TMM transport and stabilizes the MmpL3/TtfA

49

complex, indicating that it stabilizes the transport system during stress. These studies

50

identify two new components of the mycobacterial mycolate transport machinery, an

51

emerging antibiotic target in M. tuberculosis.

Introduction

55

Mycobacteria have a complex cell wall, which is crucial for maintaining cell integrity,

56

protects against environmental stress, provides a barrier against access of potentially

57

harmful molecules into the cell, and plays a critical role in mycobacterial pathogenesis.

58

The cell wall of mycobacteria is comprised of the common bacterial cell wall

59

glycopolymer, peptidoglycan, external to the cytoplasmic membrane, as well as an

60

additional covalently attached glycopolymer layer comprised of arabinogalactan.

61

Arabinogalactan bridges peptidoglycan and mycolic acids, the signature long chain lipid

62

of mycobacteria. Arabinogalactan esterified mycolates constitute the inner leaflet of the

63

outer membrane bilayer, with the outer leaflet being comprised of hydrophobically

64

associated complex lipids including trehalose dimycolate, sulfolipids, lipomannan and

65

lipoarabinomannan. This outer membrane increases both the complexity of the cell wall

66

structure and its hydrophobicity. The enzymatic steps of the arabinogalactan and

67

mycolate precursor biosynthesis have been well described and are the targets of

68

several antimycobacterials, including isoniazid and ethambutol [1-3].

69

Mycolic acid synthesis begins with FASI system that produces C16-C18 and

70

C24-C26 fatty acids. The FASII system then extends these products to produce the long

71

meromycolate chains that are the substrates for the polyketide synthetase, Pks13.

72

Pks13 catalyzes the final condensation step to produce α-alkyl β-ketoacids (C60-C90)

73

which are then acetylated and transferred to the 6 position of trehalose [4,5]. Mono-α-

74

alkyl β-ketoacyl trehalose is then reduced by CmrA to trehalose monomycolate (TMM)

75

presumably in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane [6,7]. TMM can then be

76

modified by non-essential mycolic acid methyltransferases to produce cyclopropane

77

rings and methyl branches, and in the case of M. tuberculosis these modifications alter

78

host-mycolic acid responses [8-14].

79

After synthesis, TMM must be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane to

80

reach the cell wall; this step is known to require the MmpL3 transporter [7,15-17]. The

81

MmpLs [Mycobacterial membrane protein, Large) are multi-substrate transporters of the

82

Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) class that usually act as homotrimers and are

83

exporters of molecules from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, to, or through

84

the outer membrane. In Mtb they include lipid and fatty acid transporters of virulence-

85

associated lipids across the cell envelope. Transport is driven by downhill movement of

86

H+ in response to the electrochemical H+ gradient (∆µ̃H+) across the plasma membrane.

87

MmpL3 is the only MmpL protein that is essential in vitro, though mutations in several

88

other MmpLs severely compromise virulence in infection models [7,15-18]. Mutational

89

analyses and ‘transposon-site-hybridization’ (TraSH) revealed MmpL3 is essential for

90

Mtb viability in vitro [19] and in vivo [20], and several inhibitors of MmpL3 are already in

91

clinical development, among them are a set of diamine-indole-carboxamides [21-23]

92

including Novartis NITD-304, and the pyrrole BM212 [24].

93

Genetic, pharmacologic, and biochemical studies strongly indicate that the MmpL3

94

transporter is the TMM flippase. MmpL3 has been shown to have flippase activity in

95

spheroplast assays [25] and genetic depletion leads to growth arrest and loss of TMM

96

transport [26,27]. Recent crystal structures of MmpL3 suggest potential mechanisms of

97

TMM transport [28]. However, the full mechanisms linking TMM biosynthesis to MmpL3

98

transport, and the full set of cofactors used by MmpL3 to transport TMM, are unknown.

99

MmpLs share close homology with other bacterial RND proteins, typified by the

100

acridine resistance complex (AcrB) transporter that is involved in the efflux of

101

hydrophobic small molecules from or through the periplasm of E. coli. Like AcrB, the

102

MmpLs are thought to be localized to the inner membrane [29]. However AcrB does not

103

act alone: it additionally forms the core of a comprehensive secretion system that

104

traverses both the inner and outer membrane of the cell envelope in Gram negative

105

bacteria, allowing the AcrB substrates to bypass the periplasm [30]. To form this

106

membrane spanning system, AcrB interacts with a periplasmic coupling protein called

107

AcrA (or more generally, the Membrane Fusion Protein (MPF)), which in turn links to an

108

outer membrane channel called TolC (or more generally, the Outer Membrane Protein

109

(OMP)) [31-33] The mechanism of bacterial RND transporters is thought to be highly

110

conserved and involves the engagement of the Proton Motive Force (∆µ̃H+) to drive

111

drugs, ions and other small molecules from the periplasm across the outer membrane

112

through the MPF, thus preventing the entrance of toxic substances into the bacterial

113

cytoplasm[34-36]. We thus have hypothesized that MmpL3 acts in concert with other

114

mycobacterial proteins, but no MmpL3 associated proteins have been identified. Here

115

we describe two previously unknown cofactors for MmpL3, one of which is required for

116

TMM transport, and one of which is stress inducible and stabilizes the MmpL3 complex.

Results

122

MmpL3 is stably associated with two proteins of unknown function, MSMEG_0736

123

and MSMEG_5308

124

In order to discover stable binding interactions with MsMmpL3 in situ, we devised

125

a native, stringent, affinity purification. MsMmpL3 was fused to a flexible linker

126

connecting the C-terminus of MmpL3 to monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP) at the

127

native chromosomal locus of MmpL3. As mmpL3 is an essential gene, the normal

128

growth rate of this strain suggests that fusion did not disrupt the essential function of the

129

protein. Cell membranes were collected and solubilized with the mild detergent n-

130

Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM). Anti-GFP nanobodies covalently linked to a magnetic

131

bead were incubated with detergent-solubilized membranes and then extensively

132

washed with 0.2% DDM containing buffer. Co-purifying proteins were identified via

133

shotgun mass spectrometry (Fig 1). One of the most abundantly co-purifying proteins

134

was a protein of unknown function, MSMEG_0736 (Table 1 and Table S1A,B). In

135

contrast, pulldown of MmpL10, another MmpL transporter, did not copurify

136

MSmeg_0736 or any proteins in common with MmpL3 (Table S1A,B). To validate this

137

interaction, we created a strain in which a msfGFP was fused to MSMEG_0736. When

138

MSMEG_0736-msfGFP was purified from detergent solubilized membranes under the

139

same conditions, the most abundantly copurified protein was MsMmpL3 (Table 1 and

140

Table S1A,B). In a control experiment using MSMEG_0410 (MmpL10) fused to msfGFP

141

as a bait, neither MSMEG_0736, MSMEG_0250 or MSMEG_5308 were co-purified

142

(Table 1 and Table S1A,B). In a biological replicate of the MSmeg_0736 pulldown, we

143

confirmed the identity of the prominent band at approximately 100 kDa as MmpL3 (Fig

144

1B, Table S2). As MSMEG_0736 interacts with MmpL3, and evidence we will present in

145

this paper shows MSMEG_0736 is required for TMM transport, we propose

146

MSMEG_0736 be named “TMM transport factor A”, TtfA.

147

Analysis of MsTtfA and MsMmpL3 copurifying proteins identified by anti-GFP

148

nanobody purification showed a third complex member found in both pulldowns, the

149

protein encoded by MSMEG_5308. This seven bladed beta-propeller protein has a

150

homolog in M. tuberculosis, Rv1057, that has been shown to be non-essential, although

151

Mtb lacking Rv1057 fails to properly secrete ESAT-6 and replicated poorly in

152

macrophages [37]. The Rv1057 gene has been shown to be under control of two two-

153

component systems involved in sensing cell stress, MprAB and TcrRS, as well as the

154

envelope stress responsive sigma factor SigE [38-40]. Rv1057 was also reported to be

155

the most transcriptionally induced gene in response to MmpL3 depletion [41],

156

suggesting a connection to MmpL3 function.

157

TtfA is essential for growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis in vitro

158

The M. tuberculosis H37Rv homolog of TtfA is Rv0383c. rv0383c was predicted

159

to be an essential gene in H37Rv based on transposon mutagenesis [19,42], but its

160

essentiality in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis is unknown and its molecular function

161

obscure. With no predicted protein domains or homologs of known function,

162

confirmation of its essentiality in both organisms was the first step to analyze its

163

function. To test the essentiality of ttfA in M. smegmatis, we generated a merodiploid

164

strain in which a second copy of ttfA was integrated in the chromosome. We then

165

deleted the endogenous coding sequence, so that the only a single copy of ttfA

166

remained at the attB site. We then attempted to remove the second copy of ttfA

167

from attB by marker exchange with either a vector or a plasmid encoding TtfA and

168

conferring kanamycin resistance, pAJF792 [43]. Only transformation with the plasmid

169

encoding TtfA yielded transformants that were kanamycin resistant and streptomycin

170

sensitive. Similar results were obtained with a plasmid encoding TtfA from M.

171

tuberculosis (Fig 2A). This inability to remove ttfA from attB in our ΔttfA strain suggested

172

that ttfA was required for growth of M. smegmatis (Fig 2A). To further assess the

173

essential role of MsTtfA, we generated CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) strain that

174

allows anhydrotetracycline (ATc) inducible knockdown [44]. Growth inhibition by gene

175

knockdown was visualized by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions on plates with and without

176

ATc, MsTtfA depletion led to an ATc dependent growth defect not seen in the non-

177

targeting control (Fig 2A). Gene knockdown of ttfA in M. smegmatis also led to

178

cessation of growth in liquid media between 9 and 12 hours post induction with ATc (Fig

179

2B). To test whether TtfA was essential in M. tuberculosis, we attempted to knockout

180

the gene using a temperature sensitive phage and were unsuccessful, suggesting

181

essentiality. We then generated three ttfA targeting CRISPRi strains with independent

182

guide RNAs. Gene knockdown of ttfA in M. tuberculosis with all three guide RNAs all led

183

to cessation of growth in liquid media after three days after induction with ATc,

184

indicating that TtfA is essential for M. tuberculosis growth in vitro (Fig 2C).

185

To examine the morphologic changes that accompany growth arrest during loss

186

of MsTtfA, we depleted the protein using CRISPRi and tracked morphological changes

187

using a MalF(1,2)-mCitrine expression strain that uniformly labels the cell membrane.

188

Time-lapse microscopy indicated that growth arrest without MsTtfA was characterized

189

by shorter, misshapen cells (Fig 2D, Movies S1, S2).

190

revealed that MsTtfA depleted cells were significantly shorter (2.88± 0.89 𝜇m) as

191

compared to control cells (6.00±2.03 𝜇m) (Fig 2E). The short cell phenotype suggested

192

that MsTtfA might be required for cell elongation. These data indicate that TtfA is

193

essential for mycobacterial viability and that the function of this gene is conserved

194

between fast and slow growing mycobacteria.

195

MSMEG_0736 localizes to poles and septa

196

The predicted protein encoded by MsTtfA contains a predicted N-terminal

197

transmembrane domain from amino acids 2-24, indicating that it is either a

198

transmembrane or secreted protein. To determine the localization and topology of

199

MsTtfA, we assessed the in vivo functionality of mCitrine fused at the N or C-terminus.

200

Marker exchange with a plasmid encoding MsTtfA-mCitrine yielded kanamycin

201

resistant, streptomycin sensitive transformants in similar numbers to pAJF792, encoding

202

the wildtype gene, indicating the C-terminal fusion is functional. In contrast, the plasmid

203

encoding an N-terminal mCitrine fusion did not yield kanamycin resistant, streptomycin

204

sensitive transformants, indicating that this fusion failed to complement for essential

205

function.

206

We next localized MsTtfA using live cell fluorescence microscopy. The C-terminal

207

mCitrine fusion protein produced fluorescent signal at the cell poles and septa (Fig 3A,

208

and Movie S3). It has been previously reported that mCitrine does not fluoresce when

209

localized in the periplasm, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of MsTtfA is localized

210

in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane [45]. We then generated an MsTtfA C-terminal

211

fusion to msfGFP by recombination such that the fused copy was expressed from its

212

endogenous locus and was the only copy, guaranteeing functionality. The resulting

213

MsTtfA-msfGFP strain demonstrated fluorescent signal exclusively at cell poles and

214

septa (Movie S4). Fractionation of cell free supernatants showed no detectable MsTtfA-

215

msfGFP in the supernatant (Fig 3B), suggesting that the protein is not secreted.

216

Fractionation of the cell lysate showed that MsTtfA-msfGFP localized in the Trition-X100

217

soluble fraction, similar to a membrane protein control FtsY, but not the soluble fraction

218

marked by cytosolic RNAPb, supporting that MsTtfA is membrane anchored, is not

219

secreted, and has a cytoplasmic C-terminus.

220

The essential portion of TtfA is conserved among mycolate producers

221

To further delineate the functional domains of the protein, we examined the

222

conservation of the protein sequence across homologs. BLAST searches identified

223

homologous predicted proteins among mycolate producing organisms (Fig S1).

224

Alignments of these homologs suggested that amino acids 1 through approximately 205

225

were well conserved, with poor conservation in the C-terminal 73 amino acids (Fig S1).

226

The C-terminal 73 amino acids are also predicted to be disordered [46]. This lack of

227

conservation at the C-terminus was also apparent in the alignment with the MtbTtfA,

228

which we demonstrate above is functional in M. smegmatis (Fig 2A). To assess the

229

functional contribution of these conserved regions, we generated MsTtfA truncations

230

fused at the C-terminus to msfGFP and assessed the ability of these truncations to

231

complement the essential function by marker exchange. Only the plasmid encoding

232

amino acids 1-205 yielded kanamycin resistant, streptomycin sensitive transformants,

233

indicating that amino acids 1-205 were essential (Fig S2A).

234

After confirming that all of these truncations accumulate as stable proteins at

235

their predicted sizes when expressed in wild type M. smegmatis (Fig S2A), we localized

236

each truncation by fluorescence microscopy. MsTtfA(1-205aa)-msfGFP localized to

237

poles and septa in a pattern similar to the full-length protein (Fig S2B), indicating that

238

the poorly conserved C-terminus is not required for essential function or proper

239

localization. However, truncations shorter than 205AA, which did not complement

240

essential function, also failed to localize to poles and septa, indicating that the first

241

205AA of the protein, including the N terminal transmembrane domain, are required for

242

proper localization and that this localization is tightly linked to its essential function.

243

The N-terminus of TtfA is required for interaction with MmpL3

244

To determine the regions of MsTtfA required for interaction with MmpL3, we

245

immunopurified MsTtfA truncations fused to msfGFP when coexpressed with MmpL3-

246

mCherry. MsTtfA-msfGFP was purified from DDM detergent solubilized lysates with

247

GFPTrap resin. Unfused msfGFP did not coprecipitate MmpL3-mCherry, whereas full-

248

length MsTtfA-msfGFP copurified with MmpL3-mCherry (Fig 4A). All truncations were

249

visible at comparable levels in DDM solubilized lysates at their predicted sizes (Fig 4B).

250

However, only MsTtfA(1-205aa)-msfGFP copurified with MmpL3-mCherry, quantitatively

251

similar to full-length MsTtfA-msfGFP (Fig 4B). However, loss of any segment of MsTtfA

252

within the first 205AA abolished interaction with MmpL3. These results demonstrate an

253

exact correlation between the ability of MsTtfA to interact with MmpL3 and the essential

254

function of this protein, suggesting that the essentiality of TtfA may be due to a role as

255

an MmpL3 cofactor.

256

The MmpL3 and MSMEG_0736 complex and its localization is independent of

257

TMM biosynthesis

258

To examine whether the TtfA-MmpL3 interaction requires TMM synthesis, the substrate

259

of the MmpL3 flippase, we depleted Pks13, the TMM synthetase in M. smegmatis

260

[47,48]. Depletion of Pks13 in the MmpL3-mCherry/TtfA-msfGFP caused growth arrest

261

after 6 hours of induction, indicative of depleting essential Pks13 (Fig S3) However,

262

Pks13 depletion did not affect levels of either TtfA-msfGFP or MmpL3-mCherry in DDM

263

solubilized lysates (data not shown), nor did depletion of Pks13 have any effect on the

264

TtfA-msfGFP-MmpL3-mCherry complex (Fig 4C). These results indicate that active

265

TMM biosynthesis is not required for TtfA-MmpL3 complex formation.

266

MmpL3-GFP has been previously reported to localize to cell poles and septa

267

[49], a finding we confirm with our MmpL3-msfGFP strain, which localizes the MmpL3

268

protein to poles and septa (Movie S5). This pattern is very similar to the pattern

269

observed with TtfA-msfGFP (Movie S4). To colocalize MmpL3 and TtfA we again

270

utilized strains co-expressing mCherry and msfGFP fusions to TtfA and MmpL3. By

271

fluorescence microscopy, MmpL3 and TtfA strongly co-localized to cell poles and septa

272

(Fig 5A) and were indistinguishable in their localization patterns. Depletion of Pks13 via

273

CRISPRi led to cessation of growth between 6 and 9 hours, but did not affect

274

localization of TtfA-msfGFP or MmpL3-msfGFP, again indicating that TMM synthesis

275

was not required for localization of either protein to the poles or septa (Fig 5B). Taken

276

together, these results strongly indicate that MmpL3 and TtfA form a complex in vivo at

277

the site of cell growth.

278

TtfA is required for MmpL3 TMM transport in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis

279

We next assessed whether TtfA is functionally required for TMM flipping. Loss of

280

MmpL3 function via genetic or pharmacologic inhibition results in TMM accumulation

281

and TDM depletion due to the inability of TMM to flip across the cytoplasmic membrane

282

where Antigen85 enzymes process TMM to TDM and arabinogalactan attached mycolic

283

acids [25-27]. To assess the functional role of TtfA in TMM flipping, we utilized CRISPRi

284

strains that depleted TtfA or MmpL3, and a non-targeting control in M. smegmatis. 6

285

hours after knockdown of gene expression, we labeled mycolic acids with

286

and assessed TMM/TDM levels in cell wall organic extracts. Depletion of MmpL3 had

287

the reported effect of

288

attributable to MmpL3 dysfunction. Depletion of TtfA has a quantitatively similar effect

289

on TMM transport as depletion of MmpL3, as shown by the TDM/TMM ratio in depleted

290

cultures as compared to replete cultures (Fig 6A,B). As a control for essential protein

291

depletion, we depleted the essential DnaK chaperone [43] and found no effect on

292

TMM/14C-TDM, indicating that cell arrest by depletion of any essential protein does not

293

alter TMM and TDM levels (Fig S4).

294

We saw similar results in M. tuberculosis depleted of TtfA or MmpL3. Either TtfA

295

or MmpL3 depletion impaired TMM transport, with the resulting accumulation of TMM

296

and loss of TDM (Fig 6C,D). These results indicate that loss of the MmpL3 interacting

297

protein TtfA impairs MmpL3 dependent TMM transport in both M. smegmatis and M.

298

tuberculosis, strongly indicating that TtfA is an essential cofactor in MmpL3 function.

300

An additional complex member is responsive to MmpL3 and TtfA depletion and

301

inhibition of flippase activity

302

MSMEG_5308 was also found to co-purify with both MsTtfA and MmpL3 (Fig 1

303

and Table 1). To further investigate this MmpL3 complex member, we generated a C-

304

terminal msfGFP fusion to MSMEG_5308 at the chromosomal locus. We then depleted

305

either MmpL3 or TtfA in the MSMEG_5308-msfGFP strain. Either MmpL3 or TtfA

306

depletion, but not non-targeting control, led to accumulation of MSMEG_5308 protein

307

(Fig 7A). In contrast, CRISPRi depletion of Pks13 led to cessation of cell growth after 6

308

hours of induction, but did not induce MSMEG_5308 accumulation (Fig 7A).

309

We further examined the response of MSMEG_5308 to inhibitors of the

310

TMM/TDM pathway, including early mycolate biosynthesis (isoniazid (INH)), and

311

inhibitors targeting late steps in TMM/TDM transport (SQ109, BM212, and AU1235).

312

Resistance mutations to SQ109, BM212, and AU1235 arise in MmpL3, however only

313

BM212 and AU1235 have been shown to directly inhibit MmpL3 flippase activity and all

314

three inhibitors may have effects outside of MmpL3 flippase activity [24-26,50]. Both

315

SQ109 and AU1235 caused MSMEG_5308-msfGFP accumulation at 1.5 and 3 hours,

316

but INH or BM212 (at 5 and 10 μM) had no effect (Fig 7B and data not shown). The lack

317

of accumulation of MSMEG_5308 with INH treatment or Pks13 depletion suggests that

318

MSMEG_5308 does not accumulate in response to loss of TMM or TDM biosynthesis,

319

but rather inhibition of their transport.

MSMEG_5308-msfGFP localizes to cell poles and septa and stabilizes

321

MmpL3/TtfA interaction

322

The identification of MSMEG_5308 as an MmpL3/TtfA interacting protein suggested

323

that MSMEG_5308 may co-localize with the MmpL3 complex. Indeed, MSMEG_5308-

324

msfGFP localized to cell poles and septa in a pattern similar to both TtfA-msfGFP and

325

MmpL3-msfGFP by live cell fluorescence microscopy (Fig 8A). To examine the role of

326

MSMEG_5308, we targeted MSMEG_5308 using CRISPRi and verified efficient

327

knockdown using a MSMEG_5308-msfGFP strain (Fig S5). Depletion of MSMEG_5308

328

had no impact growth or cell morphology, confirming MSMEG_5308 was not essential

329

in M. smegmatis (data not shown).

330

To assess the effect of MSMEG_5308 on MmpL3/TtfA complexes, we isolated

331

TtfA-msfGFP using anti-GFP nanobodies and probed for MmpL3-mCherry in the

332

presence and absence of MSMEG_5308. In DDM solubilized lysates, TtfA copurified

333

with MmpL3-mCherry in MSMEG_5308 depleted lysates similarly to control cells (Fig

334

8B). However, in Triton X-100 solubilized lysates, although the MmpL3-TtfA complex

335

was intact when MSMEG_5308 was present, TtfA-msfGFP did not coprecipitate

336

MmpL3-mCherry in the absence of MSMEG_5308 (Fig 8B). These results indicate that

337

MSMEG_5308 is a nonessential member of the MmpL3 complex that is induced by

338

stress and stabilizes the MmpL3-TtfA protein complex.

Discussion

341

We have identified two new components of the essential machinery of mycolic acid

342

transport and cell growth in mycobacteria. The MmpL3 transporter was previously

343

known to transport trehalose monomycolate, but its cofactors were unknown. The

344

MmpL3 machinery contains the essential protein TtfA, which we show is required for

345

TMM flipping across the cytoplasmic membrane. A third complex member,

346

MSMEG_5308, while not required for TMM transport, appears to stabilize the MmpL3

347

complex and is upregulated in response to MmpL3 dysfunction. All three of these

348

proteins localize to cell poles and septa, which are the sites of cell elongation and the

349

previously reported localization sites of early mycolic acid synthetic machinery such as

350

MabA and InhA [49].

351

TtfA, a protein with no predicted domains of known function, is an essential

352

component of the mycolic acid transport machinery. We have defined the essential

353

portions of TtfA, amino acids 1-205 that includes the N-terminal transmembrane domain

354

but not the poorly conserved disordered C-terminus. Using coprecipitation techniques,

355

we see that truncations that disrupt localization and interaction with MmpL3 fail to

356

support the essential TMM transport function of MmpL3. Our model for the molecular

357

function of TtfA in TMM transport is that the protein links the mycolate biosynthetic

358

machinery to the MmpL3 transporter, possibly by binding directly to TMM. MmpL3 is

359

distinct from several other MmpL proteins in that disruption of the transporter does not

360

inhibit synthesis of the transported lipid. For several MmpL proteins, transport and

361

synthesis are linked. For example, deletion of the sulfolipid transporter MmpL8

362

abolishes sulfolipid synthesis, rather than simply inhibiting its transport [16,51].

363

Similarly, MmpL7 is physically and functionally coupled to PDIM biosynthesis [52].

364

However, the lack of such coupling in the MmpL3 system may suggest that a coupling

365

protein is required to chaperone the transported glycolipid to the transporter, a function

366

we hypothesize for TtfA.

367

Alternatively, it is possible that that TtfA is a scaffolding protein that nucleates

368

additional essential MmpL3 complex members yet to be elucidated. TtfA has been

369

previously shown to interact with the non-essential vesiclulogenesis regulator VirR in M.

370

tuberculosis, that we also find in our purifications of MsTtfA [53].

371

The second protein we identify in the MmpL3 complex, MSMEG_5308, is a seven

372

bladed propeller protein. This protein structural motif has been previously described to

373

aid in protein-protein interactions though members are functionally diverse [54-56]. In

374

Mtb, the MSMEG_5308 homolog, Rv1057, is responsive to a variety of membrane

375

stresses as well as MmpL3 depletion. Our data indicates that the function of

376

MSMEG_5308 is to stabilize the MmpL3/TtfA complex. We hypothesize that

377

MSMEG_5308 is upregulated during times of membrane stress in order to stabilize

378

MmpL3 complexes and preserve TMM transport and cell wall biosynthesis in conditions

379

that may dissociate the MmpL3 complex.

380

MmpL3 mediated TMM transport has emerged as an attractive drug target after

381

several high throughput screens identified whole cell active inhibitors that appear to

382

target this transporter. Our identification of two previously unidentified cofactors for

383

MmpL3 will empower future studies to investigate these proteins as drug targets and

384

their potential roles in cellular response and resistance to MmpL3 targeting small

385

molecules. Additionally, future biochemical and structural studies will examine the

386

biochemical and structural organization of this essential mycolic acid transport complex.

479

injected onto a C18 reverse phase capillary column (75 um inner diameter x 25 cm

Raw mass spectrometry data were analyzed using the MaxQuant software package

was performed with a mass accuracy of +/- 20 parts per million and the main search

was performed with a mass accuracy of +/- 6 parts per million. A maximum of 5

491

modifications were allowed per peptide. A maximum of 2 missed cleavages were

492

allowed. The maximum charge allowed was 7+. Individual peptide mass tolerances

493

were allowed. For MS/MS matching, a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da was allowed and the

Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School. The gel band corresponding to

502

the molecular weight of MmpL3 was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin

503

digestion. Excised gel bands were cut into approximately 1 mm3 pieces. Gel pieces

504

were then subjected to a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure [59]. Gel pieces

505

were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min. followed by removal of

506

acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a speed-vac. Rehydration of the gel

507

pieces was with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/µl modified

508

sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 4ºC. After 45 min., the excess

509

trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution

510

to just cover the gel pieces. Samples were then placed in a 37ºC room overnight.

511

Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution,

512

followed by one wash with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid.

513

The extracts were then dried in a speed-vac (~1 hr). The samples were then stored at

514

4ºC until analysis.

515

On the day of analysis the samples were reconstituted in 5 - 10 µl of HPLC solvent A

516

(2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary

517

column was created by packing 2.6 µm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica

518

capillary (100 µm inner diameter x ~30 cm length) with a flame-drawn tip [60]. After

519

equilibrating the column each sample was loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC

520

Packings, San Francisco CA) onto the column. A gradient was formed and peptides

521

were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic

As peptides eluted they were subjected to electrospray ionization and then entered into

524

an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

525

Waltham, MA). Peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem

526

mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Peptide sequences (and

527

hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the

528

acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, Sequest (Thermo Fisher

529

Scientific, Waltham, MA) [61]. All databases include a reversed version of all the

530

sequences and the data was filtered to between a one and two percent peptide false

531

discovery rate.
