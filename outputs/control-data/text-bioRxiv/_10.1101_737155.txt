Abstract

2
3

Mapping the chromosomal rearrangements between species can inform our understanding of genome

4

evolution, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Here we present a systematic survey of chromosomal

5

rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We

6

build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp.

7

petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax. Using a novel algorithm implemented in the accompanying R

8

package syntR, we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published

9

high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those

10

synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 9.7 chromosomal rearrangements

11

per million years – a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher

12

than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished

13

by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This non-random sampling

14

suggests that certain chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute

15

disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our understanding

16

of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus has an exceptional rate of chromosomal

17

rearrangement that likely facilitates similarly rapid diversification.

Introduction

19
20

Organisms vary widely in the number and arrangement of their chromosomes – i.e. their karyotype.

21

Interestingly, karyotypic differences are often associated with species boundaries and, therefore,

22

suggest a link between chromosomal evolution and speciation (White 1978, King 1993). Indeed, it is

23

well established that chromosomal rearrangements can contribute to reproductive isolation. Although

24

not a universal phenomenon, individuals heterozygous for divergent karyotypes are often sterile or

25

inviable, illustrating a direct link to reproductive isolation (King 1987, Lai et al. 2005, Stathos and

26

Fishman 2014). Apart from being underdominant per se, chromosomal rearrangements can also

27

facilitate the evolution of reproductive barriers by extending genomic regions that are protected from

28

introgression (Noor et al. 2001, Rieseberg 2001), accumulating genetic incompatibilities (Navarro and

29

Barton 2003), and simplifying reinforcement (Trickett and Butlin 1994).

30
31

Despite their prevalence, the fixation of underdominant chromosomal rearrangements is still not well

32

understood. The simplest model is that in sufficiently small populations, underdominant

33

rearrangements can be stochastically fixed by genetic drift (Lewis 1966, Templeton 1981, Grant 1981).

34

However, several other mechanisms have been proposed to explain chromosomal evolution (Rieseberg

35

2001). These include individually neutral chromosome fissions and fusions (Baker and Bickham 1986,

36

Britton-Davidian 2000), meiotic drive (Novitski 1951, White 1978, Chmátal et al. 2014) and association

37

with locally adapted genes (Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006, Lowry and Willis 2010). The importance of

38

each of these mechanisms will largely depend on the types of rearrangements fixed (e.g., chromosome

39

fusions, pericentric inversions, or reciprocal translocations) and the cost/benefit of the genes

40

associated with them. Consequently, mapping and characterizing chromosomal rearrangements is a

41

critical step towards understanding their evolutionary dynamics.

42
43

The genus Helianthus is well known to have particularly labile genome structure. These sunflowers

44

have several paleopolyploidy events in their evolutionary history (Barker et al. 2008), have given rise to

45

three homoploid hybrid species (Rieseberg 1991), and are prone to transposable element activity

46

(Kawakami et al. 2011, Staton et al. 2012). Evidence in the form of hybrid pollen inviability, abnormal

47

chromosome pairings during meiosis, and genetic map comparisons suggests that Helianthus

48

karyotypes are extremely diverse (Heiser 1947, Heiser 1951, Heiser 1961, Whelan 1979, Chandler

49

1986, Rieseberg et al. 1995, Quillet et al. 1995, Burke et al. 2004, Heesacker et al. 2009, Barb et al.

50

2014). In fact, annual sunflowers have one of the highest described rates of chromosomal evolution

51

across all plants and animals (Burke et al. 2004). Furthermore, while Helianthus species generally have

52

large effective population sizes (but see Stebbins and Daly 1961, Carney et al. 2000), where drift should

53

be relatively weak, chromosomal rearrangements appear to be strongly underdominant in this group

54

(Chandler 1986, Lai et al. 2005). This means that chromosomal evolution is less likely to be driven by

55

drift alone and more likely to be an important driver of reproductive isolation in sunflower.

57

Studying chromosomal evolution within any group requires high-density genetic maps and a method

58

for systematic comparison of karyotypes. Recently, high-density genetic maps of H. niveus ssp.

59

tephrodes and H. argophyllus were built and compared to H. annuus (Barb et al. 2014). This analysis

60

clearly mapped previously inferred karyotypes (Heiser 1951, Chandler 1986, Quillet et al. 1995) and

61

showed that chromosomal rearrangements affect introgression between sunflowers. That said,

62

creating additional high-density maps for related species would yield a fuller picture of chromosomal

63

evolution.

64
65

Previously constructed genetic maps with limited marker density suggest that several chromosomal

66

rearrangements differentiate H. annuus and H. petiolaris (Rieseberg et al. 1995, Burke et al. 2004) and

67

evidence from cytological surveys suggests that subspecies within H. petiolaris subspecies carry

68

divergent karyotypes (Heiser 1961). Creating high-density genetic maps for H. petiolaris and adding

69

them to the above analysis will allow us to (1) precisely track additional rearrangements and (2)

70

reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for the group, untangling overlapping rearrangements that can be

71

obscured by directly comparing present-day karyotypes and that are likely to occur in lineages with

72

extensive chromosomal rearrangement like sunflower. At the same time, these H. petiolaris maps will

73

be useful to breeders looking to introgress beneficial alleles from crop wild relatives into domesticated

74

sunflower lineages (Chetelat and Meglic 2000, Foulongne et al. 2003, Dirlewanger et al. 2004).

75
76

A key part of a multi-species comparative study of chromosome evolution is a systematic and

77

repeatable method for identifying syntenic chromosomal regions (sensu Pevzner and Tesler 2003)

78

using genetic map data. This is especially important for cases with high marker density, because

79

breakpoints between synteny blocks can be blurred by mapping error, micro-rearrangements, and

80

paralogy (Hackett and Broadfoot 2003, Choi et al. 2007, Barb et al. 2014, Bilton et al. 2018). In previous

81

studies, synteny blocks have been found by counting all differences in marker order (Wu and Tanksley

82

2010), by visual inspection (Burke et al. 2004), or by manually applying simple rules like size thresholds

83

(Heesacker et al. 2009, Barb et al. 2014) and Spearman’s rank comparisons (Berdan et al 2014,

84

Schlautman et al 2017). However, these methods become intractable and prone to error when applied

85

to very dense genetic maps. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there is no software available that

86

identifies synteny blocks based on relative marker positions alone (i.e., without requiring reference

87

genomes, sequence data, or markers with known orientations). Therefore, there is a need for software

88

that implements an algorithm to systematically and repeatably identify synteny blocks from any

89

number of paired genetic map positions.

90
91

Here, with the goal of understanding chromosome evolution in Helianthus and more generally, we

92

aimed to: (1) build high density genetic maps for two subspecies of Helianthus petiolaris, (2) develop a

93

method and software to systematically identify chromosomal rearrangements from genetic maps, (3)

94

reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for a subsection of annual sunflowers, and (4) detect general patterns

95

of chromosomal rearrangement in Helianthus.

Study system

98
99

We focused on five closely related diploid (n = 17) taxa from the annual clade of the genus Helianthus

100

(Fig 1). These sunflowers are native to North America and are naturally self-incompatible, although

101

domesticated lineages of H. annuus are self-compatible.

110
111

The five taxa are found in the United States (Fig S7, Rogers et al. 1982). Helianthus annuus is found

112

throughout much of the central United States and commonly occurs in somewhat heavy soils and along

113

roadsides (Heiser 1947). With a similarly widespread range, H. petiolaris occurs in sandier soils and is

114

made up of two subspecies: H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris, which is commonly found in the southern

115

Great Plains, and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax, which is limited to more arid regions in Colorado, Utah, New

116

Mexico, and Arizona (Heiser 1961). Where H. petiolaris is sympatric with H. annuus, gene flow occurs

117

between the species (Strasburg and Rieseberg 2008). Helianthus argophyllus is primarily found along

118

the east coast of Texas where it also overlaps and hybridizes with H. annuus (Baute et al. 2016). Finally,

119

H. niveus ssp. tephrodes is a facultative perennial that grows in sandy dunes from the southwestern US

120

into Mexico.

121

Controlled crosses

122
123

To make genetic maps, we crossed an outbred individual with presumably high heterozygosity from

124

each H. petiolaris subspecies to a homozygous line of domesticated sunflower and genotyped the

125

resulting F1 offspring. Specifically, we used pollen from a single H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris plant

126

(PI435836) and a single H. petiolaris ssp. fallax plant (PI435768) to fertilize individuals of a highly inbred

127

and male sterile line of H. annuus (HA89cms). This design allows us to infer where recombination

128

occurred in the heterozygous parents because we can reliably track the segregation of those parents’

129

alleles against a predictable background.

130
131

The self incompatible H. petiolaris accessions were collected in central Colorado (PI435836, 39.741°, -

132

105.342°, Boulder County) and the southeast corner of New Mexico (PI435768, 32.3°, -104.0°, Eddy

133

County, Fig S7) and were maintained at large population sizes by the United States Department of

Agriculture. When it was originally collected, accession PI435768 was classified H. neglectus. However,

135

based on the location of the collection (Heiser 1961) and a more recent genetic analysis of the scale of

136

differences between H. petiolaris ssp. fallax and H. neglectus (Raduski et al. 2010), we believe that this

137

accession should be classified H. petiolaris ssp. fallax.

138

Genotyping

139
140

We collected leaf tissue from 116 H. annuus x H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris F1 seedlings and 132 H.

141

annuus x H. petiolaris ssp. fallax F1 seedlings. We extracted DNA using a modified CTAB protocol

142

(Doyle and Doyle 1987) and prepared individually barcoded genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries

143

using a version the Poland et al. (2012) protocol. Our modified protocol includes steps to reduce the

144

frequency of high-copy fragments (e.g. chloroplast and repetitive sequence) based on Shagina et al.

145

(2010) and Matvienko et al. (2013) and steps to select specific fragment sizes for sequencing (see

146

Ostevik 2016 appendix B for the full protocol).

147
148

Briefly, we digested 100ng of DNA from each individual with restriction enzymes (either PstI-HF or PstI-

149

HF and MspI) and ligated individual barcodes and common adapters to the digested DNA. We pooled

150

barcoded fragments from up to 192 individuals, cleaned and concentrated the libraries using SeraMag

151

Speed Beads made in-house (Rohland and Reich 2012), and amplified fragments using 12 cycles of PCR.

152

To deplete high-copy fragments, we used the following steps (M. Todesco unpublished): (1) denature

153

the libraries using high temperatures, (2) allow the fragments to re-hybridize, (3) digest the double

154

stranded fragments with duplex specific nuclease (Zhulidov et al 2004), and (4) amplify the undigested

155

fragments using another 12 cycles of PCR. We ran the libraries out on a 1.5% agarose gel and extracted

156

300-800 bp fragments using a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA). Then,

157

following additional library cleanup and quality assessment, we sequenced paired-ends of our libraries

158

on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

159
160

To call variants, we used a pipeline that combines the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner version 0.7.15 (BWA,

161

Li & Durbin 2010) and the Genome Analysis Toolkit version 3.7 (GATK, McKenna et al 2010). First, we

162

demultiplexed the data using sabre (https://github.com/najoshi/sabre, Accessed 27 Jan 2017). Next,

163

we aligned reads to the H. annuus reference (HanXRQr1.0-20151230, Badouin et al. 2017) with ‘bwa-

164

mem’ (Li 2013), called variants with GATK ‘HaplotypeCaller’, and jointly genotyped all samples within a

165

cross type with GATK ‘GentypeGVCFs’. We split variants into SNPs and indels and filtered each marker

166

type using hard-filtration criteria suggested in the GATK best practices (DePristo et al. 2011, Van der

167

Auwera et al. 2013). Specifically, we removed SNPs that had quality by depth scores (QD) less than 2,

168

strand bias scores (FS) greater than 60, mean mapping quality (MQ) less than 40, or allele mapping bias

169

scores (MQRankSum) less than -12.5 and indels that had QD < 2 or FS > 200. After further filtering

170

variants for biallelic and triallelic markers with genotype calls in at least 50% of individuals, we used

171

GATK ‘VariantsToTable’ to merge SNPs and indels into a single variant table for each cross type.

172
173

Finally, we converted our variant tables into AB format, such that the heterozygous parents contribute

174

‘A’ and ‘B’ alleles to offspring, while the H. annuus parent contributes exclusively ‘A’ alleles. At biallelic

175

markers, sites with two reference alleles became ‘AA’ and sites with the reference allele and the

176

alternate allele became ‘AB’. At triallelic markers, sites with the reference allele and one alternate

177

allele became ‘AA’ and sites with the reference allele and the other alternate allele became ‘AB’. This

178

method randomly assigns ‘A’ and ‘B’ alleles to the homologous chromosomes in each heterozygous

179

parent, so our genetic maps initially consisted of pairs of mirror-imaged linkage groups that we later

180

merged.

181

Genetic mapping

182
183

We used R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) in conjunction with R/ASMap (Taylor and Butler 2017) to build

184

genetic maps. After excluding markers with less than 20% or greater than 80% heterozygosity and

185

individuals with less than 50% of markers scored, we used the function ‘mstmap.cross’ with a stringent

186

significance threshold (p.value = 1x10-16) to form conservative linkage groups. We used the function

187

‘plotRF’ to identify pairs of linkage groups with unusually high recombination fractions and the function

188

‘switchAlleles’ to reverse the genotype scores of one linkage group in each mirrored pair. We did this

189

until reversing genotype scores no longer reduced the number of linkage groups.

190
191

Using the corrected genotypes, we made new linkage groups with only the most reliable markers.

192

Namely, we used the function ‘mstmap.cross’ (with the parameter values: dist.fun = "kosambi", p.value

193

= 1x10-6, noMap.size = 2, noMap.dist = 5) on markers with less than 10% missing data and without

194

significant segregation distortion. We refined the resulting linkage groups by removing (1) markers

195

with more than three double crossovers, (2) markers with aberrant segregation patterns (segregation

196

distortion more than two standard deviations above or below the mean segregation distortion of the

197

nearest 20 markers), and (3) linkage groups made up of fewer than four markers.

198
199

We progressively pushed markers with increasing amounts of segregation distortion and missing data

200

into the maps using the function ‘pushCross’. After adding each batch of markers, we reordered the

201

linkage groups and dropped markers and linkage groups as described above. Once all the markers had

202

been pushed back, we used the function ‘calc.errorlod’ to identify possible genotyping errors (error

203

scores greater than 2), and replaced those genotypes with missing data. We continued to drop linkage

204

groups, markers, and genotypes that did not meet our criteria until none remained.

205
206

Finally, we dropped five excess linkage groups, each made up of fewer than 30 markers, from each

207

map. The markers in these linkage groups mapped to regions of the H. annuus genome that were

208

otherwise represented in the final genetic maps but could not be explained by reversed genotypes.

209

Instead, it is likely that these markers were polymorphic in the HA89cms individual used for crosses

210

because of the 2-4% residual heterozygosity in sunflower inbred lines (Mandel et al. 2013).

211

SyntR development

212
213

To aid in the identification of chromosomal rearrangements, we developed the R package ‘syntR’

214

(code and documentation available at http://ksamuk.github.io/syntR). This package implements a

215

heuristic algorithm for systematically detecting synteny blocks from marker positions in two genetic

216

maps. In short, syntR combines a biologically-informed noise reduction method and a cluster

217

identification method better suited for detecting linear (as opposed to circular) clusters of data points.

aCC-BY-NC 4.0 International license.

218

The algorithm compares sets of homologous genetic markers from two genetic maps, clusters the

219

markers into synteny blocks using a method that is similar to the “friends-of-friends” clustering

220

algorithm (Huchra and Geller 1982), and identifies breakpoints. The algorithm correctly recovers

221

breakpoints in simulated genetic maps under biologically reasonable scenarios and performs at least

222

well as prior methods while being systematic and repeatable. We fully describe this method and its

223

performance in the supplemental materials.

224

Finding synteny blocks

225
226

We used syntR to identify synteny blocks between our newly generated genetic maps and an ultra-

227

high-density map of H. annuus (Badouin et al. 2017). The H. annuus genetic map was used to build the

228

sunflower genome that we use as a reference (Badouin et al. 2017). This allowed us to easily convert

229

between physical position in the H. annuus reference and position in the H. annuus genetic map. Using

230

this property, we further compared two previously published genetic maps for the closely related

231

sunflower species, H. niveus ssp. tephrodes and H. argophyllus (Barb et al. 2014), to the same H.

232

annuus map. We aligned the published maps’ marker sequences to the H. annuus reference using bwa

233

and converted the definitively aligned markers (MQ > 40) to their positions in the H. annuus genetic

234

map.

235
236

Initially, we ran syntR on each individual map comparison using the parameters that maximized the

237

genetic distance (i.e. coverage of the genome) represented across synteny blocks (Table 1) given that

238

synteny blocks should represent all positions in the genetic maps being compared (Chen et al. 2009).

239

However, varying the tuning parameters of syntR resulted in the identification of additional

240

rearrangements, which were clearly shared between the maps (Fig S8). Therefore, we ran syntR using

241

values of the parameter ‘max_clust_dist’ (see supplemental material for details) that covered the

242

range of best parameters for each species (max_clust_dist = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5) and extracted a

243

curated set of synteny blocks from the output using the following hierarchical criteria. A synteny block

244

was retained if it: (1) was found in another species, (2) was identified in the majority of syntR runs for a

245

single species, (3) maximized the genetic distance represented by synteny blocks. We present this

H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris, F = H. petiolaris ssp. fallax). For example, a H. petiolaris ssp. fallax

255

chromosome made up of regions that are syntenic with H. annuus chromosomes 4 and 7 is called F4-7.

256

Karyotype reconstruction and analysis

257
258

We used our inferred synteny blocks and the software MGR v 2.01 (Bourque and Pevzner 2002) to infer

259

ancestral karyotypes for our five Helianthus taxa and to determine the number of chromosomal

260

rearrangements that occurred along each branch of the species tree. To run the MGR analysis, we

261

needed the order and orientations of synteny blocks in all five maps. However, individual synteny

262

blocks were often missing from one or more of our final maps. We took two approaches to addressing

263

this problem. First, we inferred the likely position of missing synteny blocks based on the location of

264

markers that were too sparse to be grouped together by syntR and matched the location of synteny

265

blocks in other maps. In the second case, we simply dropped any synteny blocks that were not

266

universally represented. Because we already had two sets of synteny blocks for each map (curated and

267

individually optimized), we ran the MGR analyses using three different sets of synteny blocks: (set 1)

268

curated and inferred, (set 2) curated and present in all five maps, (set 3) individually optimized and

269

present in all five maps.

Genetic maps

275
276

Both of the final H. petiolaris genetic maps are made up of the expected 17 chromosomes and have

277

very high marker density (Table 1, Fig 2, Fig S9, Fig S10). Only 6% of the H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris map

278

and 10% of the H. petiolaris ssp. fallax map fails to have a maker within 2 cM. Overall, both maps are

279

somewhat longer than the H. petiolaris map reported by Burke et al. (2004), but the higher marker

280

density combined with some genotyping error likely explains this discrepancy. Indeed, building maps

281

with variants that were thinned to 1 per 150 bp using vcftools version 0.1.13 (Danecek et al. 2011)

282

yields collinear maps that are closer to the expected lengths (Table 1, Fig S11). We present subsequent

283

results based on the full maps to improve our resolution for detecting smaller rearrangements.

Despite the general expansion of our maps, we find that chromosomes 2 and 4 in the H. petiolaris ssp.

fallax map (F2 and F4) are unexpectedly short (Fig 2). When we look at the distribution of markers for

289

this map relative to the H. annuus reference, we find very few variable sites in the distal half of these

290

chromosomes. This suggests that the shortness of F2 and F4 is explained by a lack of variable sites

Using syntR, we recovered 97 genetic regions that are syntenic between the H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris

306

and H. annuus and 79 genetic regions that are syntenic between the H. petiolaris ssp. fallax and H.

comparisons that are similar, although likely more conservative (see supplementary materials), to

309

those presented in Barb et al. (2014). In all four comparisons, syntR successfully identified synteny

310

blocks that cover large proportions (63%-90%) of their respective genetic maps even in the face of a

311

very high proportion of markers that map to a different chromosome than their neighbours (Table 3).

312

These “rogue markers” could be the result of very small translocations, poorly mapped markers, or

313

extensive paralogy.

without translocations in any map (i.e., chromosomes 1-3, 5, 8-10, 11, and 14). For those chromosomes, the

318

majority of marker mapped to a single H. annuus chromosome. The other markers are considered rogue.

Using all sets of synteny block orders and orientations, our MGR analyses identified similar overall

330

the similarity of karyotypes matches known phylogenetic relationships. As expected, MGR analyses run

Using our most complete set of synteny blocks (set 1), we find 88 chromosomal rearrangements across

the phylogeny (Fig 2). If we then use the most current divergence time estimates for this group

(Mason 2018; H. niveus ssp. tephrodes and H. annuus = 1.89 MYA, range = 0-5.25; H. argophyllus and

H. annuus = 1.54 MYA, range = 0-4.96) and conservatively assume that H. niveus ssp. tephrodes and

356

both H. petiolaris subspecies arose at approximately the same time (such that they all have 1.89 Ma

357

long branches), we find that 9.7 rearrangements occurred per million years in this clade. We cannot

358

reliability put an upper bound on this estimate because the lower bounds of divergence time estimates

359

within this groups overlap 0. However, at 2.3 rearrangements per million years, even our most

360

conservative estimate of rearrangement for this group, which uses the less complete sets of synteny

361

blocks and the upper bounds of divergence time estimates, is among the highest measurements

362

reported in Burke et al. (2004).

363
364

These 88 rearrangements are made up of 74 inversions and 14 translocations that are distributed

365

across the phylogeny. Except for the branch between reconstructed karyotypes 1 and 2, where there

366

are no translocations and many inversions, each branch has 2-12 inversions and 1-3 translocations.

367

Although inversion and translocation rates are fairly even across the tree, it is unlikely that the rate of

368

inversions is equal to the rate of translocation (binomial test, 5.1x10-11). Furthermore, we find that only

369

8 of the 17 chromosomes are involved in the 14 translocations identified on the phylogeny. This

370

extreme asymmetry is highly unlikely to have happened by chance if translocation is equally likely for

371

all chromosomes (p = 8.0x10-8, Fig S22). Therefore, this pattern of rearrangement suggests that some

372

chromosomes are more likely than others to be involved in translocations. In line with this observation,

373

we see that some sections of chromosomes are frequently found in new positions. For example, we

374

see that A4 and A7 are involved in repeated translocations and that part of A6 has a different position

375

in almost every map.

376

Discussion

377
378

Large-scale chromosomal changes may be key contributors to the process of adaptation and

379

speciation, yet we still have a poor understanding of the basic evolutionary patterns and rates of

380

chromosomal rearrangement. Here, we performed comprehensive analysis of the evolution of

381

chromosomal rearrangements in a clade of sunflowers. We created multiple new genetic maps for taxa

382

in this clade, and devised a novel, systematic method for comparing these maps. Using our new

383

method, we identified a wide range of karyotypic variation in our new maps, as well as previously

384

published maps. Consistent with cytological data, we discovered an extremely high rate of

385

chromosomal evolution in this clade of plants. Here, we discuss the evolutionary and methodological

386

implications of this finding, and suggest next steps in understanding the dynamic process of

387

chromosomal rearrangement.

388

Similarity of H. petiolaris maps to previous studies

389
390

Compared with previous work, we found more inversions and fewer translocations between H.

391

petiolaris subspecies and H. annuus (Rieseberg et al. 1995, Burke et al. 2004). This is probably due to a

392

combination of factors. First, there appears to be karyotypic variation within some Helianthus species

393

(Heiser 1948, Heiser 1961, Chandler et al. 1986) and the individuals used to make maps in each study

394

were not identical. Second, the maps presented here are made up of more markers and individuals,

395

which allowed us to identify small inversions that were undetected in the previous comparisons, as

396

well as to eliminate false linkages that can be problematic with small mapping populations. Lastly, we

397

required more evidence to call rearrangements, especially translocations. Although we did recover

398

some of the translocations that were supported multiple markers in Rieseberg et al. (1995) and Burke

399

et al. (2004), for example a translocation between A6 and A15 in H. petiolaris ssp. fallax and the

400

fragmentation of A16 across multiple chromosomes in both H. petiolaris maps, we did not recover any

401

of the translocations supported by only a single sequence-based marker. Given the high proportion of

402

“rogue markers” in our maps it is likely that some of the putative translocations recovered in those

403

earlier comparisons are the result of the same phenomenon.

404
405

On the other hand, we found that rearrangements between our H. petiolaris maps match the

406

translocations predicted from cytological studies quite well. Heiser (1961) predicted that H. petiolaris

407

ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax karyotypes would have three chromosomes involved in two

408

translocations that form a ring during pairing at meiosis, as well as the possibility of a second

409

independent rearrangement. This configuration of chromosomes would occur at meiosis in hybrids

410

between the H. petiolaris subspecies maps we present here (Fig S23). Furthermore, one of the

411

cytological configurations that included the most chromosomes in H. petiolaris and H. annuus hybrids

412

reported by Whelan (1979) and one of the most common configurations in other cytological studies

413

(Heiser 1947, Ferriera 1980, Chandler et al. 1986) was a hexavalent (a six-chromosome structure) plus

414

a quadrivalent (a four-chromosome structure). Again, this is the configuration that we would expect in

415

a hybrid between the H. petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. annuus individuals mapped here. Further, the

416

complicated arrangement and relatively small size of A12, A16 and A17 synteny blocks in our H.

417

petiolaris maps might explain why cytological chromosome configurations in hybrids between H.

418

petiolaris and H. annuus are so variable. Interestingly, the rearrangements identified between H.

419

argophyllus and H. annuus karyotypes here and in Barb et al. (2014) also match the cytological studies

420

better than an earlier comparison of sparse genetic maps (Heesacker et al. 2009). It seems that in

421

systems with the potential for high proportions of rogue markers, many markers are needed to reliably

422

identify chromosomal rearrangements.

423

Rearrangement rate

424
425

Our data suggest that annual sunflowers experience approximately 9.7 chromosomal rearrangements

426

per million years (the upper bound for this estimate is undefined because divergence time estimates

427

for the group include 0, while the lower bound is 2.3). This rate is higher than initially reported for

428

sunflower (5.5-7.3, Burke et al. 2004) and overlaps with more recent estimates for this group (7.4-10.3,

429

Barb et al. 2014). It is also much higher than recent estimates in other taxa (0.03-0.12, Wu and

430

Tanksley 2010), but is not the highest ever reported (e.g. a comparisons of genome sequence revealed

431

up to 35.7 rearrangements per million years in some grass lineages, Dvorak 2018). That said, 9.7 is very

432

likely an underestimate of the actual chromosomal rearrangement rate in sunflower for several

433

reasons. First, we were conservative in our estimates of divergence time and thresholds for calling

434

rearrangements. For example, some proportion of the rogue markers that we identified could, in fact,

435

be the result of very small but real chromosomal rearrangements. Second, our ability to resolve very

436

small synteny blocks and breakpoints between synteny blocks is dependent on marker density. Until

437

we have full genome sequences to compare (like for the grass lineages), we are likely failing to detect

438

very small rearrangements and potentially infer that some independent rearrangements are shared.

439

However, regardless of just how much we are underestimating the rate, sunflower chromosomes are

440

evolving quickly. This high rate of chromosomal evolution could be a consequence of a higher rate of

441

chromosomal mutation, a decreased chance that chromosomal polymorphisms are lost, or both

442

processes. Although there are factors that could increase the rate of all types of chromosomal

443

rearrangements (e.g. repetitive sequence or small inbred populations), other factors are dependent on

444

the specific type of rearrangement.

445

Type of rearrangements

446
447

All annual sunflowers have 17 chromosomes (Chandler et al. 1986). Therefore, it seemed unlikely that

448

chromosomal evolution was caused by fissions and fusions in sunflower, and our results are consistent

449

with that expectation. Instead, we see that inversions and interchromosomal translocations dominate

450

chromosomal evolution in Helianthus, which is a common pattern in angiosperm lineages (Weiss-

451

Schneeweiss and Schneeweis 2012). Furthermore, we found that inversions are happening at a higher

452

rate than translocations. This is consistent with examples of inversions occurring more often than

453

translocations in other plant lineages (Wu and Tanksley 2010, Amores et al. 2014) and reports that

454

intrachromosomal rearrangements are more common than interchromosomal rearrangements

455

generally (Pevzner and Tesler 2003). The difference between the rate of inversion and translocation is

456

notable because many studies do not clearly differentiate the evolutionary dynamics expected for

457

different rearrangement types. Both inversions and translocations are associated with reduced gene

458

flow between types in sunflower (Rieseberg et al. 1999, Barb et al. 2014) and in other systems (Basset

459

et al. 2006, Yannic et al. 2009). However, translocations have a more predictable effect on hybrid

460

fertility while the main effect of inversions is to reduce recombination.

461
462

Reciprocal translocation heterozygotes affect fertility because of missegregation during meiosis and

463

are expected to cause half of gametes to be unbalanced and therefore inviable (White 1973, King

464

1993). Inversion heterozygotes can also produce unbalanced gametes, but whether that happens is

465

dependent on the size of the inversion and whether disrupted pairing during meiosis actually inhibits

466

crossovers (Searle 1993). When inversions are small or have suppressed crossing over, they will not be

467

strongly underdominant. Indeed, inversions typically are not strongly underdominant in sunflowers (L.

468

Rieseberg, pers. comm.), which might explain why translocations are less common than inversions and

469

why pollen viability is accurately predicted by the number of translocations inferred from cytological

470

studies (Chandler et al. 1986).

471
472

In the case of inversions, the consequences of reduced recombination for adaptation and speciation

473

has been extensively examined (Hoffman and Rieseberg 2008). Recombination in inversions can be

474

suppressed because of disrupted pairing (Searle 1993) or ineffective because the products are inviable

475

(Rieseberg 2001). In either case, reduced recombination can facilitate adaptation in the face of gene

476

flow because regions of low recombination (e.g. an inversion) increase the chance that new mutations

477

with positive effects on fitness will arise either linked to a region that is already diverged (Via and West

478

2008, Via 2012) or linked to other similar loci (Yeaman and Whitlock 2011, Yeaman 2013) and will

479

therefore be more likely to persist under migration-selection balance. On the other hand, in a case of

480

multiple locally adapted alleles, a mutation that reduces the production of maladaptive recombinants

481

(e.g. an inversion) can be advantageous and thereby drive low recombining regions to fixation

482

(Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006). Both processes will lead to clusters of adaptive traits inside inversions

483

and examples of this pattern are accumulating quickly (Jones et al. 2012, Lee et al. 2017, Hooper and

484

Price 2017, Fuller et al. 2017, Coughlan and Willis 2019). It is not clear whether the same pattern will

485

be common for translocations (but see Fishman et al. 2013, Stathos and Fishman 2014 for one

486

example). Mispairing at translocation breakpoints could suppress crossing over, but recombination

487

inside reciprocal translocations will not necessarily produce inviable gametes.

488

Non-random chromosomal rearrangement

489
490

We found that some sunflower chromosomes are involved in more translocations than others. A bias

491

in the identity of chromosomes involved in translocation is common in species with sex chromosomes,

492

where sex chromosomes are rearranged more often than autosomes (e.g., Neafsey et al. 2015), but

493

this is not relevant for sunflowers. However, it is also known that centromeres and other repetitive

494

regions can affect the rate of mutations that cause chromosomal rearrangements (Hardison et al.

495

2003, Vitte et al. 2014) and breakpoint reuse is a common phenomenon in comparative studies of

496

karyotypes (Bailey et al. 2004, Larkin et al. 2009, Murphy et al. 2005, Pevzner and Tesler 2003).

497

Therefore, it is possible that the overactive chromosomes identified in this study are outliers for

498

centromeric/repeat content. In fact, we see some hints that centromeric repeats might be associated

499

with repeated translocation in this clade. Using the locations of the centromere specific

500

retrotransposon sequence, HaCEN-LINE (Nagaki et al. 2015), to roughly identify the locations of

501

centromeres in our reference, we find that some rearrangement breakpoints, for example the section

502

of A16 with a different position in each map, are close to putative centromeres (Fig S24-S29).

503
504

An association between repeated translocations and centromere properties would be interesting

505

because rearrangements that change the position of centromeres might cause meiotic drive to fix

506

those rearrangements (Chmátal et al. 2014, Zanders et al. 2014). Although a more thorough analysis of

507

centromeric repeat locations and their association with rearrangement breakpoints is required to draw

508

strong conclusions about the importance of centromeres to chromosomal evolution in sunflower, the

509

development of reference sequences for wild sunflower species is underway, which will allow those

510

associations to be confirmed. Further, it is time to directly test for meiotic drive in this system by

511

examining the transmission of rearrangements that affect centromeres in gametes produced by plants

512

that have heterozygous karyotypes. However, regardless of how they arise, if translocations are

513

primarily responsible for reducing pollen viability in sunflower and certain chromosomes are

514

translocated more often, these chromosomes could be playing an outsized role in maintaining

515

divergence between sunflower lineages.

516

Identifying rearrangements

517
518

Studying the evolution of chromosomal rearrangements requires dense genetic maps and systematic

519

methods to analyze and compare these maps between species. Our new software, syntR, provides an

520

end-to-end solution for systematic and repeatable identification of synteny blocks in pairs of genetic

521

maps with any marker density. Our tests on real and simulated data find that syntR recovers

522

chromosomal rearrangements identified by both previous manual comparisons and cytological study,

523

suggesting that syntR is providing an accurate view of karyotypic differences between species.

525

Although the number of species with whole genome sequence and methods to detect synteny blocks

526

from those sequences are rapidly accumulating, it is still rare to have multiple closely related whole

527

genome sequences that are of sufficient quality to compare for karyotype differences. At the same

528

time, the proliferation of reduced representation genome sequencing methods means that it is easy to

529

generate many genetic markers and produce dense genetic maps. These maps coupled with this

530

software will allow us to discover many karyotypes. Furthermore, syntR allows comparisons to include

531

older genetic map data that would otherwise go unused. Overall, we believe syntR will be a valuable

532

tool for the systematic study of chromosomal rearrangements in any species.

533
534

We also believe that syntR provides a baseline for the development of further computational and

535

statistical methods for the study of chromosomal rearrangements. One fruitful direction would be to

536

integrate syntR’s synteny block detection directly into the genetic map building process (much like

537

GOOGA, Flagel et al. 2019). Another key extension would be to allow syntR to compare multiple

538

genetic maps simultaneously to detect synteny blocks in a group of species (e.g. by leveraging

539

information across species). Finally, formal statistical methods for evaluating the model fit and

540

uncertainty involved with a particular inferred set of synteny blocks would be a major (albeit

541

challenging) improvement to all existing methods, including syntR.

542

Conclusion

543
544

Understanding the evolution of chromosomal rearrangements remains a key challenge in evolutionary

545

genetics. By developing new software to systematically detect synteny blocks and building new genetic

546

maps, we show that sunflowers exhibit rapid and non-random patterns of chromosomal evolution.

547

These data expand the relatively short list of taxa in which karyotype evolution as been systematically

548

studied (e.g, Wu and Tanksley 2010, Huang et al. 2009, Vogel et al. 2010, Yogeeswaran et al. 2005,

549

Ferguson-Smith and Trifonov 2007) and generate specific and testable hypotheses about chromosomal

550

evolution in sunflower. We believe that our work will spur additional studies of karyotypic evolution

551

and diversity, and ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between

552

chromosomal evolution and speciation.
