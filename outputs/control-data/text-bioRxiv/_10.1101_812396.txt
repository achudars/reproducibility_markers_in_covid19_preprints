ABSTRACT
The central goals of mechanobiology are to understand how cells generate force and
how they respond to environmental mechanical stimuli. A full picture of these
processes requires high-resolution, volumetric imaging with time-correlated force
measurements. Here we present an instrument that combines an open-top, singleobjective light sheet fluorescence microscope with an atomic force microscope (AFM),
providing simultaneous volumetric imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and high
dynamic range force capability (10 pN – 100 nN). With this system we have captured
lysosome trafficking, vimentin nuclear caging, and actin dynamics on the order of one
second per volume. To showcase the unique advantages of combining Line Bessel light
sheet imaging with AFM, we measured the forces exerted by a macrophage during
FcɣR-mediated phagocytosis while performing both sequential two-color, fixed plane
and volumetric imaging of F-actin. This unique instrument allows for a myriad of novel
studies investigating the coupling of cellular dynamics and mechanical forces.
MAIN
Cells interact mechanically with their environment by generating and responding to
forces. A focus on the mechanical dynamics of cell phenomena such as motility,
division and phagocytosis is essential for understanding stem cell fate 1, cancer
progression 2 and innate immunity 3. These mechanical processes are inherently threedimensional (3D) and are regulated both by very local (nm) interactions as well as
whole-cell scale (m) biochemical and mechanical signaling. Obtaining a more
complete picture of a cell’s mechanical interaction with its environment requires
monitoring local and global structures in 3D while simultaneously measuring associated
forces. These goals necessitate integrating high spatial and temporal resolution
volumetric imaging methods with high resolution force acquisition. Light sheet
florescence microscopy (LSFM) enables acquisition of volumetric, multicolor time series
at a high resolution and frame rate with low background fluorescence and low
phototoxicity 4-6. Among single cell force methods 7, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) 8
is unique in combining a large force range (10-11-10-6 N) that enables molecular-scale to
tissue-level mechanics measurements, with high bandwidth temporal resolution (s)
and sub-nanometer spatial control. Combining LSFM with AFM (AFM-LS) imposes
significant geometrical constraints to the optical system design, and demands low
vibration operation to accommodate sensitive force measurements. To address this
challenge, we used a single-objective selective plane microscopy (soSPIM) technique
integrated with, and time-synchronized to, an AFM. As described in a report on our first
generation system 9, we generated a fixed vertical light sheet through the objective
while collecting a side-ways view (x-z) fluorescence image through the same objective
with the aid of a 45 degree mirrored prism. Here we describe our second generation
system that combines vertical Line-Bessel Sheet (LBS) illumination with volumetric
image collection for multicolor, 3D fluorescence movies that are time-correlated with
sensitive force measurements.
The second generation system comprises several advances that enable high frame rate
volumetric imaging with accompanying force application and measurement. Full

computer control of the optical path by electronically controlled steering mirrors and
electrically tunable lenses (ETL) on the input and output sides provide high frame rate
sheet scanning and image focusing capabilities. The system employs a remote
focusing technique that uses an ETL on the detection path to change the focal plane
without moving the objective lens. This minimized the mechanical vibrations that would
otherwise compromise force measurements. To provide extended depth of field for the
desired light sheet width 10, a LBS was implemented 11. We collected two-color, 4D (3D
+ time) volumetric scans with the LBS on live cells with simultaneous, timesynchronized AFM force data acquisition. Our single cell 3D scans were collected on
the order of one second, which is comparable with reports of similar fluorescence
imaging techniques 10,12.
To challenge our imaging system, we investigated several contexts for which high
quality visualization of 4D cytoskeletal dynamics is essential to address the critical
biophysical questions. To demonstrate the volumetric imaging capabilities of our
system, we focused on vimentin. Vimentin is a representative component of the
intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton, a network with viscoelastic properties 13,14 and
functions distinct from those of the actin and microtubule systems 15. IFs are essential
for normal cell morphology, motility and signal transduction, and IF dysregulation
underlies over 80 human diseases 14. Despite its importance, we understand relatively
little about the mechanobiology, dynamics and regulation of the IF network, as
compared to other cytoskeletal components 15,16. Current techniques are unable to
connect optical measurements of assembly state dynamics with force measurements to
probe the mechanical properties of IFs in real time. Using our system, we monitored the
3D architecture of the vimentin cytoskeleton in human cells on a single-second
timescale, demonstrating sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to capture IF
assembly state dynamics. Additionally, we demonstrate the 4D data collection
capabilities of our system by presenting data of lysosome movement within the vimentin
network.
To demonstrate our combined imaging and force capabilities, we investigated the
biophysics of Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages. Phagocytosis is
the process by which large pathogen particles are engaged through specific ligandreceptor interactions, engulfed, and then digested 17. Although the details of actin
structural dynamics during phagocytosis have been investigated 18-20, it is increasingly
clear that forces and mechanosensitivity are also integral to immune cell function, a
research area recently dubbed “mechanoimmunology” 3. We present simultaneous
volumetric image and force data acquisition of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in the
phagocytic cup during target engulfment. With the AFM-LS, we were able to test
current hypotheses of the time course of outward and inward engulfment forces 21, and
their relation to actin remodeling 22. The relative timing, spatial structure and magnitudes
of the macrophage forces and cytoskeletal dynamics may be critical in understanding
the connection between morphological and biochemical events that occur during the
phagocytic process. To this end, we also present quantitative cross-correlation of
engulfment force and local actin dynamics.

RESULTS
AFM-LS design
Our system combines high spatiotemporal resolution 3D fluorescence microscopy with
single-molecule level force spectroscopy; LSFM provides the former while AFM is
capable of the latter (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We
have previously described implementation of single-objective LSFM in a conventional
microscope 23. In brief, a vertical LBS was generated at the sample plane by relaying
the image of an elliptically shaped beam intersecting an annular aperture to the back
focal plane of the objective. A right-angle prism was lowered adjacent to a cell of
interest and the image plane was raised, using the objective focus, to the height on the
prism where the virtual image of the rotated view of the specimen is formed. The x-y
virtual image is the x-z plane of the cell as it was illuminated by the vertical light sheet
(See Supplementary Fig. 3 for side-view imaging optical theory and Supplementary
Fig. 4 for point spread function). ETLa and ETLb (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1)
control axial scanning of the illumination light and image plane respectively; the
scanning mirror (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1) translated the light sheet at the
sample plane. We can achieve either full frame rate fixed light sheet side-view imaging
of an x-z plane, or sequentially offset x-z slices to produce volumetric imaging of an
entire cell.
Integration of the AFM into the optical system is shown in Fig. 1b. The AFM cantilever
was positioned between the cell and the prism 9. All of the beam-shaping optics were
designed to fit within the AFM hood, and the beam scanning was tuned to have no
measurable effect on the AFM force noise, which at ~10 pN, is sufficient for molecular
scale force measurements (Supplementary Fig. 5). Each dynamic optical component
was computer-controlled, which allowed us to seal the acoustic hood enclosing the
system throughout the duration of each experiment (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Fig.
1c illustrates a typical side-view image of a cell, in this case a RAW 264.7 macrophage.
The two-color image shows the fluorescence of Halo-tagged F-tractin in green and a 6
m polystyrene bead attached to an AFM cantilever and coated with fluorescent IgG
(magenta), touching the top of the cell.
Two-color volumetric imaging
Our system is capable of performing fast (~1 s), single-objective, two-color LSFM
volumetric imaging (Fig. 2, Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Video 2). We
first performed volumetric imaging of a live HeLa cell stably expressing vimentinmEmerald and labeled with Lysotracker Deep Red (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Video 1).
This temporal resolution allowed us to visualize the 3D dynamics of lysosomes within
the vimentin network on single-second timescales. This opens up the potential to study
lysosome transport dynamics and their interaction with the cytoskeleton 24 in cells under
controlled mechanical load. Recent reports show that the vimentin cytoskeleton plays a
central role in regulating lysosome trafficking in autophagy 25.
To illustrate the ability of the system to visualize fine detail while scanning at a high
frame rate, we fixed the mEmerald vimentin cells and stained them with AlexaFluor 594
phalloidin for F-actin. We then performed volumetric imaging as before, but with one
half the axial step size (Fig. 2b,c, Supplementary Video 2). A single-pixel line scan

through the filopodia (Fig. 2c) demonstrates the signal-to-background and feature
resolution our system can achieve at this scan rate with a reasonable laser intensity for
live-cell studies (see Methods). Two-color volumetric imaging paves the way for
experiments to characterize the mechanobiological role of IFs in processes such as
organelle motility 26,27 and filopodia dynamics 28.
Forces during phagocytosis
We employed the AFM-LS system to investigate forces generated during phagocytosis.
An antibody-coated 6 m diameter bead was attached to an AFM cantilever, and was
lowered to ~0.5 µm above the top of the cell (Fig. 3a). The force applied by the
macrophage (RAW 264.7) on the bead was measured as the cell sampled, and then
subsequently attempted to engulf the bead. As in Fig. 1c, the macrophage was stably
expressing F-actin marker F-tractin and the bead was coated with fluorescent IgG
(AlexaFluor 488). We first describe fixed light sheet experiments (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Sequential images were recorded at 1.25 frames/s
over the duration of ~30-40 min for each experiment, and synchronized with the AFM
force data. We focused first on forces generated early in the phagocytic process. Forces
generated by the macrophage early in the process are of interest as they may promote
ligand-receptor engagement 29 and facilitate target stiffness sensing3. Second, we
directly compared cup progression and force to test models of phagocytic cup
generated engulfment mechanics. To make this comparison, we generated a
kymograph of the structure of the cup around the bead’s circumference, as measured
by F-tractin fluorescence (see Fig. 3).
Fig. 3c shows four time points of the side-view fixed light sheet experiment, with
corresponding dashed lines in Fig 3d. The force on the bead vs. time is graphed below
the kymograph, with the negative force direction chosen as downward (cell-ward).
From the pattern of forces and extent of the cup formation, we observed in this
particular experiment that significant downward force (> 1 nN in magnitude) was
generated by the cell well before the cup reached the equator of the bead. In 11 of 20
experiments, we observed downward forces (> 100 pN) exerted by cells before the
bead equator was reached. We also observed that in 10 of 20 experiments, an upward
force greater than 50 pN was observed before the cup formed, most likely related to the
macrophage probing the phagocytic target with ruffling structures or filopodia. We note
for context that mechanochemical signaling at cell matrix adhesions can occur with
forces below 10 pN 30. For the data set depicted in Fig. 3, we found a maximum of 4 nN
of force which corresponds to an average downward surface stress over the bead
hemisphere of approximately 70 pN/m2 (70 Pa). These values are similar to mean
traction stresses measured for adherent and motile cells as measured with flexible post
31 or traction force substrates 32. Other studies have shown forces within the phagocytic
cup include compressive forces 33 on the target near the cup edge consistent with an
actomyosin contractile ring 18. In our data, we did not find an obvious change in the
direction or magnitude of the force as the cup approached and passed the midway of
the target as would be expected if the contractile force at the edge dominated the net
force on the target. Although the net downward force did undergo considerable
fluctuations, on average the force continued to increase in the downward direction
during the entire cup progression. Cell-ward forces from initial stages of cup formation

were in agreement with observations and subsequent modeling performed by Herant, et
al and van Zon, et al. 34,35.
Correlation of force with local actin dynamics
Our side-view videos of phagocytosis (Supplementary Videos 3 and 4) showed that
the actin cytoskeleton was dynamic across the entire cross section of the cell with
significant structural features (membrane ruffles and filopodia) forming well away from
the cup region. We were interested in how F-actin accumulations fluctuated during
engulfment, both around the cup and in regions distal to the cup, and how this related to
engulfment force. We therefore collected dynamic F-actin intensity within several
distinct cell regions during phagocytosis, and cross-correlated those data with the bead
engulfment force (see Online Methods for details). Because F-tractin binds only to Factin, fluorescence intensity is taken as a proxy for local F-actin concentration. We
hypothesized that F-actin concentration fluctuations within critical cell regions (e.g. the
cup) were related to our measured force via combinations of protrusive polymerization
forces and acto-myosin based, contractile activity. Three full engulfment experiments,
performed as described for Fig. 3, were analyzed for such correlations at the cup, and
in regions away from the cup, as shown in Fig. 4a, panel 3. We show a representative
analysis in Fig. 4, for a different cell than that shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4b shows the raw
intensity data (average intensity over region) from the three regions, along with the force
data.
Note in Fig. 4c that the cup region (R1) and left-hand cell edge (R2) initially showed
weaker negative correlation (at zero time lag) prior to and early in cup development
(~700 s) while the right-hand cell edge (R3) was weakly positively correlated. The
negative cross-correlation here at the beginning of cup development (Fig. 4a, 715 s),
indicated higher actin concentration corresponding to a downward force. As the cup
matured and actin intensity spiked in R1 (especially after 1500 s), regions R1 and R2
showed strong positive correlation between force and actin intensity (upward force with
high actin concentration) while region R3 showed the reverse. The cross-correlation
analysis also allowed us to assess relative timing of local F-actin concentration
fluctuations and fluctuation in the total force on the bead. Fig. 4d-f depicts the crosscorrelation data for each region as a 2D plot with the y-axis as time lag and the x-axis
as lab time. Note similarity in patterns for data from R1 and R2 and the inverse pattern
in R3. The fainter blue signal (corresponding to negative correlation) on the zero time
lag axis at ~700 s for R1 indicates downward force coincident with initial cup formation,
which is consistent with data in Fig 4c. We observed this particular correlation in all
three cells for which this analysis was performed – early cup formation as indicated by
increased F-actin density in the cup region coincided with downward force. Focusing
next on the F-actin spike in the cup that occurred after 1500 s, we observed that the
actin concentration (R1, Fig. 4d) preceded the upward force by approximately 60 s. This
was similar to the correlation in region R2 and to the timing of the actin concentration of
R3, although R3 displayed a negative correlation. This was also generally consistent
across all three data sets: large actin intensity events in the region of the cup were
strongly correlated with forces on the bead. However, later in the process after early cup
formation, the direction of the forces, upward or downward, and the correlations of the
local actin concentrations were variable (sometime positively correlative, sometime

negatively). These results suggest that in the period following early cup formation, there
is complex cell-wide coordination of actin dynamics that give rise to competing force
mechanisms. This is consistent with the contributions from both actin polymerization
forces and actomyosin contractile forces. For example, we hypothesize that myosin II
activity is more highly correlated in time and location with downward-directed
engulfment forces and less correlated with upward-directed protrusive forces. Future
studies using fluorescent imaging tools to highlight myosin activity and actin
polymerization will be the next step in delineating how each force generating
mechanism contributes.
Volumetric Imaging with Forces during Phagocytosis. We employed volumetric
imaging to obtain a more complete view of actin structure during phagocytosis. We
collected a series of volume scans of a macrophage engaging and attempting to engulf
a bead. RAW 264.7 cells were prepared and labeled as described for Fig. 3. Fig. 5
presents selected volume frames and the corresponding forces during engulfment. The
image sequence in Fig. 5a depicts the process of target engagement and cup
formation. Fig. 5b shows the force data associated with the volumetric sequence with
red lines that correspond to the frames shown in Fig. 5a. We note that here, as in the
experiments of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, there was an initial downward force of approximately 1
nN soon after macrophage engagement. Volume imaging provided a view of the F-actin
signal throughout the volume of the cell. As seen in Fig. 5c and Supplementary
Videos 5 & 6, an x-y plane maximum intensity projection of the image data in the
volume of the cup showed actin accumulations, spaced ~1.5 µm from each other, at the
base of the bead. These podosome-like structures 29 are consistent with observations
reported by Barger et al 36 in their study investigating the interplay between myosin-I
and actin structure in the phagocytic cup. In the future we will perform 3D correlation
analysis to understand the role of these structures in force generation on target cells.
DISCUSSION
We have combined a vertical light sheet, single objective system that provides fast sideview (top to bottom) volumetric imaging simultaneous with AFM for mechanobiology
applications. The implementation of a reflecting prism within the field of view provides
good light collection and convenient specimen access for force probes. The LBS allows
high aspect ratio illumination for low levels of phototoxicity, which enables long-term
imaging. Through the complete computer control of microscope operation and careful
amelioration of instrumental vibrations, we achieved single-molecule force sensitivity
during image acquisition (Supplementary Fig. 5). The primary disadvantage of our
system is the loss of light collection efficiency when imaging in side-view. The signal to
noise ratio is reduced by approximately a factor of two in comparison to plan-view due
to the reduced cone of light intercepted by the reflecting prism, a recognized difficulty in
high viewing-angle, single objective imaging systems. The resolution suffers as well,
depending upon how far the cell is from the prism. We find this is an acceptable tradeoff given our systems other advantages. These issues can be fixed by employing
horizontal light sheet illumination by reflecting the light sheet off the prism, with the
imaging focus of the objective at the plane of the horizontal light sheet 23.
We demonstrated volumetric imaging of vimentin and actin networks (Fig. 2b,c) and
presented 4D data revealing the movement of lysosomes within the IF cytoskeleton

(Fig. 2a). We anticipate that the ability to couple force measurements with highresolution, volumetric optical imaging will be a powerful tool for studying the
mechanobiology and regulation of the IF cytoskeleton, which remain poorly understood
27,37. For example, vimentin filaments organize around the nucleus (Fig. 2b,c) and are
known to stiffen in response to deforming forces 38, but the mechanism of stiffening is
not yet known 15. Our system, combined with known vimentin mutants that limit
assembly state 39, will allow us to interrogate this question directly. Our results also set
the stage for new discoveries on IF cytoskeleton regulation. All IF proteins are
decorated with post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation and
O-glycosylation, which may alter IF function 37,40. We previously demonstrated that the
site-specific O-glycosylation of vimentin is required for IF assembly and function in
human cells 37, but the real-time effects of these PTMs on IF network dynamics and
mechanical properties remain elusive. Using simultaneous AFM-LS, we are poised to
characterize the 4D effects of chemical or genetic inhibition of PTMs (e.g.,
phosphorylation, O-glycosylation) on the vimentin cytoskeleton, addressing a
longstanding question in the IF field. In the case of lysosomes, our 4D data along with
the force application capabilities we have demonstrated opens up the potential to study
how load-induced distortions of cytoskeletal networks influence vesicle movement 24 as
well as other cellular transport dynamics.
Our application of AFM-LS to the biophysics of phagocytosis revealed complexity in
engulfment related actin dynamics, and in force progression. During the initial
macrophage engagement, the macrophage introduced downward forces in excess of
100 pN, of sufficient magnitude for mechanoreceptor induced signaling 30. For cases
where the cup progressed, these downward forces exceeded 4 nN in some trials. Our
actin dynamics data showed strong location dependent correlation with engulfment
forces, and implicated not only the actin dynamics in the cup region, but also regions
distal from the cup. The correlation analysis also revealed complexity in the interplay of
actin concentrations, and suggests that coordinated cell-wide cytoskeletal dynamics
result in the forces imposed on the target. This in turn suggests mechanotransductive
signaling during phagocytosis may be happening not only within the cup itself, but also
across the cell at its basal contact, and potentially within the nucleus, with downstream
consequences for cell motility, adhesion, and gene expression 41.
ONLINE METHODS
Optics for LSFM setup. The light sheet fluorescent microscope (LSFM) comprises five
optical modules; four modules are in the illumination pathway and one in the imaging
pathway. The optical set up with parts list and components can be found in our previous
publication 23. We implemented modules 1-5 for the work reported here.
Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 provide detailed schematic and
pictures of the system. Illumination lasers (561 nm and 488 nm, OBIS, Coherent) are
combined colinearly into an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) (AOTnC-400.650-TN,
AA optoelectronic, France) to control intensity and precise timing of each laser. A fiber
optic cable (FT030-Y, Thorlabs) guides laser light into the AFM hood where the beam is
shaped and relayed to the specimen through the four modules. In Module 1, the beam
is expanded using beam expanders. In Module 2, the beam is focused using a

cylindrical lens (LJ1567RM-A, Thorlabs) into an annulus (R1DF200, Thorlabs) forming
the Line Bessel sheet (LBS). In Module 3, the lateral steering mirror (OIM 101 1”,
Optics-in-Motion) controls the motion of the LBS at the specimen, enabling volume
scans. In Module 4, a 4f system comprising two relay lenses and ETLa (EL-16-40-TC,
Optotune) in the middle controls the axial motion of the LBS independently of the
objective height. Then the beam passes through a tube lens and the objective lens to
the specimen. In the imaging pathway, Module 5, a second 4f system with ETLb (EL-1640-TC, Optotune) in the middle controls the image plane independently of the objective
height. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 V2+ sCMOS. A dual
band pass filter cube assembly was used to pass 488 nm and 561 nm laser light to the
sample and GFP and RFP emission to the camera (TRF59904-EMOL2 C173202;
Chroma, USA). A short pass filter was used in the imaging path to remove light from the
AFM super luminescent diode (880nm). A UplanSAPO 60x/1.2 NA W (Olympus, USA)
with PIV controlled heater (HT10k; TC200; Thorlabs, USA) was used for imaging.
Production of polyacrylamide gels. To eliminate glare from the coverslip surface that
interfered with side-view imaging, we plated cells on a ~10 µm thick pad of 55 kPa
polyacrylamide (PA). Bottom coverslips (40 mm round, #1; Fisher Scientific) were
cleaned in a UV cleaner and vapor treated with 0.1% APTES (aminopropyl
triethoxysilane; Sigma) in toluene at 80 deg for 30 min. Top coverslips (22 x 22 mm
#1.5; Fisher, USA) were silanized with HMDS (hexamethyldisilane) for 30 min at 80
deg. PA gel solution was prepared with standard reagents, but with the addition of 1%
polyacrylic acid v/v to provide carboxylic acid groups for linkage of ECM proteins 33
Quickly, 2 µL APS was added to 125 µL of gel solution, vortexed for 2 seconds, and 10
µL were placed on the center of each round, 40 mm coverslip. A 22 x 22 mm coverslip
was then placed on top of the PA to spread it evenly, and a 3 g weight was placed in the
center to compress it. Deionized water was placed at the edges of the 22 mm coverslip
to keep the gel hydrated and aid in release. A corner of the coverslip was slowly lifted to
separate the square coverslip from the gel, leaving the gel pad on the round coverslip.
The round coverslip with gel pad was then placed in a biosafety hood for 15 minutes
and allowed to dry enough so that a 10 mm cloning cylinder could be affixed to the gel
pad with a small coating of vacuum grease (High Vacuum grease, Dow Corning, USA).
An EDAC solution (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; 10 mg/mL) in PBS
was then added to the cloning cylinders for 15 min at 37 deg. The PBS/EDAC was then
removed, and 10 ug/mL fibronectin in PBS was added for 60 min at 37C. This was
replaced by PBS for storage, or media for immediate use with cells.
Prism Mounting and Cleaning. Right angle prisms (POC part 8531-607-1) were
mounted onto a shaved glass capillary tube secured to a Thorlabs compact table clamp
(Thorlabs CL3). A thin layer of UV polymerizing glue (Norland optical adhesive 81) was
used to glue the bottom square side to the capillary tube, exposing the mirrored surface.
The prism and capillary tube were then cured for 5 minutes.
Prisms were rinsed with 70% ethanol and DI water after each use to remove any
accumulated debris. If further cleaning was necessary, Red First Contact polymer
cleaner (Photonic Cleaning, WI) was placed onto the surface of the prism, allowed to
cure for 5 minutes, then peeled off with tweezers. Repeat cleanings were performed if
needed.

Prism alignment. A right-angle prism was secured to a thin capillary tube and mounted
to the prism holder stage equipped with a tip, tilt, and rotation stage (TTR001,
Thorlabs). The pitch, roll, and yaw adjustments to the prism were made before each
experiment using a coverslip with fluorescent beads to align the light sheet with the
prism. Using translation micrometers, the prism was positioned over but not touching
the AFM cantilever and cell. The relative position of the prism and light sheet was
adjusted such that ETLa had enough working range to position the waist of the light
sheet in the specimen while imaging in side-view. All pitch, roll, and yaw adjustments to
the prism were done with the prism holder stage.
Bead functionalization and bead attachment to AFM cantilever. 6.1 µm carboxylate
beads (Polysciences, Inc, USA) were dried on a cleaned coverslip coated in tetrachlorosilane (Gilest, USA). Using the AFM head manual z translation stage (Asylum
Research MFP3D, Oxford Instruments, UK), a tipless cantilever (Nanoworld TL1-Arrow50; Nanoworld, Switzerland) was lowered onto a droplet of UV polymerizing glue
(Norland optical adhesive 81; Norland Products, USA) on the same coverslip. The
cantilever was lowered onto a suitable bead and a UV flashlight was used to slightly
cure the glue before raising the beaded cantilever off the surface of the coverslip. The
entire chip was placed under a UV lamp for 5 minutes to cure the glue completely.
The beaded cantilever was then placed in the chip holder and onto the AFM head. The
tip was then dipped into a series of four droplets on a UV-cleaned coverslip: (1) a
droplet of 10 mg/mL EDAC (1-ethyl-3-(-3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide; Fisher
Scientific) in PBS for 2 min; (2) PBS, 2 min; (3) 33 ug/mL Goat anti-Mouse IgGAlexaFluor488 (ab175473, Abcam) for 5 min; (4) PBS, >2 min and submerged until
used. IgG was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000g before use in functionalization steps.
Cantilever Calibration. Calibration of the AFM cantilever’s spring constant and optical
lever sensitivity (OLS) were performed with the Sader method in air 42. To calculate the
OLS in liquid, a thermal noise spectrum was taken while the cantilever was submerged
in imaging media. The super luminescent diode (SLD) was set midway along the
cantilever. Using the built-in Igor software (Asylum 15.6.4), the peak was fit and the
OLS was determined using the Sader method determined spring constant 43.
Cell culture for vimentin, actin and lysosome 3D imaging. Vimentin-/- HeLa cells
stably expressing vimentin-mEmerald were generated as described 37. In brief, the
endogenous vimentin gene was deleted via CRISPR-Cas9 methods and a verified
vimentin-/- clone was stably transduced with a lentiviral vimentin-mEmerald vector.
Transduced cells were selected in 500 µg/ml G418 and sorted for uniform mEmerald
expression via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells were grown in DMEM-F12
media without phenol red. For experiments, cells were plated on collagen coated 55
kPa, thin (~10 µm) PA gels within 1 cm cloning cylinders (Corning, USA). The cloning
cylinder was removed prior to imaging.
Volume imaging of vimentin, actin and lysosomes. Live HeLa cells expressing
vimentin-mEmerald were treated with 1 µM lysotracker dark red (Invitrogen, USA) for 10
min at 37 degrees, washed several times in fresh, equilibrated medium, and then placed
on the AFM stage of the optical microscope. Indirect transmitted light was used to find
a cell of interest and the prism was positioned next to the cell. The imaging was then

switched to side-view. As described in 23, a custom MatLab program generated a lookup table for points of best focus. This look-up table was used by custom software in
LabView to synchronize the AOTF, camera, mirror and ETLb for volume imaging. Laser
power at the sample for live cell imaging was 98 uW for 488 nm and 290 uW for 561
nm. To image F-actin with vimentin, the expressing cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde
for 5 min, stained with alexafluor 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 deg,
washed with PBS, and imaged. Laser power at the sample for fixed cell imaging was
116 uW for 488 nm and 80 uW for 561 nm.
Generation and use of RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells expressing F-tractin.
RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (TIB-71) and maintained in RPMI 1640
medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat# 61870036, MA) supplemented with GlutaMAX
and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Product, CA). Cells
expressing F-tractin-Halo were generated using a PiggyBac transposon system. We
first produced a stable macrophage cell line expressing reverse tetracycline-controlled
transactivator (rtTA) and then used those cells to produce a stable cell line expressing
F-tractin-Halo under the control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter. The transfection
was performed using the Viromer Red transfection reagent (Lipocalyx, Weinbergweg,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2.5 x 10 5 cells were
seeded into one well of a six-well plate, and the cells were transfected the following day.
For each well, we used 1.2 µL of Viromer Red transfection reagent, 2.5 µg piggyBac
transgene plasmid (PB-rtTA or PB-tre—F-tractin—Halo-Hygro) and 0.5 µg of piggyBac
transposase plasmid (ratio at 5:1). After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with fresh
culture medium and the cells were allowed to recover for 24 hours. Stable transfectants
were selected by gradually increasing antibiotic concentrations; geneticin (G418) to a
concentration of 500 µg/ml for PB-rtTA and Puromycin to 2.5 µg/ml for PB-F-tractinHalo. To induce the expression of F-tractin-Halo, the cells were grown in medium
containing 50 nM doxycycline for 48 hours. On the day of imaging, cells were plated
onto fibronectin coated PA gels within 1 cm cloning cylinders. After one hour, 4 µL of
10-8 M JaneliaFluor 549 (JF549) HaloTag ligand was added to the cells for a 30 minute
incubation. The dye containing media was replaced with imaging media three times
every 10 minutes to removed unbound dye.
Plasmid construction pEGFP-C1 F-tractin-EGFP was a gift from Dyche Mullins
(Addgene plasmid # 58473; http://n2t.net/addgene:58473; RRID:Addgene_58473).
PiggyBac plasmids PB-rtTA and PB-miRE-tre-Puro were kindly provided by Mauro
Calabrese (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); PB-rtTA encodes reverse
tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) and G418 resistant gene under UbC
promoter 44, and PB-miRE-tre-Hygro encodes a protein of interest and a hygromycin
resistant gene under tetracycline-dependent and EF1 promoters, respectively. pFtractin-Halo was first generated by cloning Halo-Tag cDNA (forward primer,
aggggggctagcgctcgccaccatggcagaaatcggtactggctttc; reverse primer,
cgaagcttgagctcgagatctagtcgactgaattcgcgttatcgc) between AgeI and BglII site of pEGFPC1 F-tractin-EGFP using Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs, MA). Halo-F-tractin
was then amplified using the primers (forward primer,

aggcacagtcgaaacgcattgtcgacttatggctcgccggaaatctcg), and cloned between AgeI and
SalI sites of PB-miRE-tre-Hygro, yielding PB-tre-F-tractin-Halo-Hygro. Those plasmids
were confirmed by sequencing before use. The primers were synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (CA) and sequences were performed by Genewiz (NJ).
Fixed light sheet phagocytosis experiment. A 3D printed custom specimen insulating
chamber (uploaded as Thingiverse 2035546) was placed on top of the coverslip, with
the hole aligned for prism access. The specimen insulator was magnetically secured to
the heated microscope stage using Asylum Research’s petri dish clamp. A thin circle of
silicone grease (High Vacuum grease, Dow Corning, USA) secured the specimen
coverslip to the 3D part as well as functioned to prevent leakage of media. Deionized
water was added to a well in the specimen chamber to reduce evaporation. The AFM
head with evaporation shield and a calibrated, functionalized cantilever was placed on
the scope with the cantilever in the media and allowed to equilibrate.
Using brightfield illumination, a cell was chosen that had lamellipodia and filopodia. The
cantilever was lowered to within a few microns above the cell. The prism was brought
as close as possible next to the cell and cantilever without touching the cantilever or
interfering with the SLD light path. Imaging in side-view then allowed adjustments to
cantilever height, light sheet height (using ETLa) and image focus (objective and ETLb).
The camera was set to accept external trigger (HCImageLive). Using custom LabView
software, the AOTF was synchronized with the camera. The system was triggered by
the AFM controller when the force curve began using Asylum Research Software and
custom code (IGOR). The sequential timing was 300 ms exposure with a 100 ms delay
for both 561 nm and 488 nm lasers. Laser power was chosen to maximize image quality
while limiting photobleaching. For 561 nm, this was typically 30 µW of light delivered to
the sample, while for 488 nm, this was 15 µW. A virtual deflection curve was taken prior
to each experiment. The AFM was set to closed loop Z-position feedback. The trigger
distance for the cantilever to travel and stay was chosen so that the bead tip would be
within 0.5 µm of the top of the cell. The cantilever was lowered at 1 µm/s. Duration of
the experiment was 1800 s dwell toward the cell with a 200 s dwell away from the cell.
Volume scanning during phagocytosis. Our protocol for initialization of volume
scanning is described in our prior report 23. Otherwise, the set up for the volume imaging
of phagocytosis experiment was similar to the fixed light sheet. The AFM cantilever’s
bead tip was positioned over a macrophage and the prism was placed next to the
cantilever. After switching to side-view and adjusting the LBS, the volume scan
proceeded as described above. AFM settings were the same as in the fixed light sheet
experiment. As in the fixed light sheet experiment, the system was triggered to start the
experiment with the AFM, synchronizing the force data with the volume imaging.
Environmental Control. The specimen insulating chamber sits atop the circular sample
coverslip. The specimen insulator made use of the Asylum Research petri dish heater
and magnetic petri dish clamp while also allowing the prism to freely enter and exit the
specimen space. A well that runs along the inside of the specimen insulator above and
separate from the specimen media holds DI water to increase humidity of the chamber
and discourage evaporation of the media. Additionally, the AFM head is equipped with
an evaporation shield that caps the specimen insulating chamber. Once the chamber is

enclosed a stable temperature environment (37oC) can be maintained with minimal
evaporation.
In addition to the petri dish heater, we used an objective heater (Thorlabs HK-100) with
a PIV controller (Thorlabs TC200) to maintain the temperature at the sample location.
Settings for both controllers were adjusted until the specimen reached the desired
temperature, stability and gradient. The specimen temperature was measured with an
Omega thermocouple placed directly in a test media. 37.0oC was achieved with a 0.1oC
gradient of the media from edge of the coverslip to the center of the coverslip.
PA spheres for the PSF in Supplementary Figure 4. PA spheres were generated by
the methods as described 33, with some minor changes. We used the 3 µm SPG frits to
extrude high stiffness PA gel into hexane at 300 RPM stirring. Beads were fixed
overnight in AIBN as described 33, washed in fresh hexane, dried in air and
resuspended into PBS with sonication to separate the beads. The spheres were 12-20
µm in diameter after resuspension, and were coated in a similar manner to the pads
above. An aliquot of the PA beads was centrifuged in an Eppendorf tube (7000 RPM, 4
min), and resuspended in 10 mg/mL EDAC in pH 6 MES buffer and rotated for 15 min at
room temperature. We centrifuged the beads to remove the EDAC as above, and
resuspended them in 10 ug/mL alexafluor 488 goat anti mouse IgG (Invitrogen). After
30 min rotation, the beads were again centrifuged to remove unbound IgG, and
resuspended in EDAC (10 mg/mL) with a 10-6 dilution of 0.1 µm red fluorescent
microspheres (Invitrogen) in PBS. Beads were again rotated for 30 min and then
pelleted, and resuspended in plain PBS.
To attach the coated beads to a PA gel pad, low concentrations of beads were
suspended onto the gels within the cloning cylinders, and again EDAC was added to 10
mg/ml final concentration. The IgG fluorescence was used to find the PA beads, and
then an isolated red fluorescent bead was imaged for the PSF.
Correlation of Force signal and Local Actin Activity. We performed cross-correlation
analysis on our AFM force time series, F(t), and the local F-tractin fluorescence
intensity, I(t). Regions of interest (ROI) within the fluorescence image stack were
selected and the average intensity within the ROI was saved as a time series. The force
signal and ROI image intensity signal were then analyzed using cross-correlation code.
Both force and intensity data were high pass filtered prior to cross-correlation
calculation to remove offset and slope (frequency cut off = 0.5 mHz). For these data,
downward forces (in the direction of engulfment) are negative, and upward forces
(pushing force of the cell on the bead) are positive. Positive correlations between force
and ROI intensity indicate where increased actin and pushing (upward) forces coincide,
while negative correlations indicate where higher actin intensity is coincident with
downward engulfment forces.
We assumed that the dynamics we observed were not stationary, that is we did not
expect the statistics of either of the force or the intensity to be consistent throughout the
multistage phagocytic process. Thus we needed to perform our cross-correlation
calculations on subsets of the data to assess correlations more locally in time. We
selected a time window, tw, over which to make our local assessment of correlation. This
window was stepped through the data set at small time increments (1 s) to collect the

correlation strength at each experimental time t, as a function of time lag, 𝜏 (in this case,
lag of intensity relative to force).
𝑡+𝑡𝑤 /2

(𝐹 ⋆ 𝐼)(𝑡, 𝜏) = ∫

𝐹(𝑡′) 𝐼(𝑡′ + 𝜏)𝑑𝑡′

𝑡−𝑡𝑤 /2

Where (𝐹 ⋆ 𝐼) is the unnormalized cross-correlation strength between force and
intensity, t is the “zero lag time” over which the correlation is centered,  is the time lag,
and tw is the time window. We chose not to use a normalized cross-correlation
calculation. With normalization (as for Pearson correlation), certain time windows with
very small but correlated intensity fluctuations yielded cross-correlation strength
comparable to those time windows with very large signal fluctuation correlation, falsely
emphasizing the smaller signals’ significance. With no normalization, correlation
strength was proportional to signal magnitude. This emphasized correlations between
larger, and in our view, more relevant fluctuations in force and actin intensity.

FIGURES AND FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1| Schematic of the combined AFM and LSFM system. a, Laser lines housed
in our light engine are coupled into an optical fiber that passes into the AFM hood. A
cylindrical lens focuses a sheet of light onto an annulus which is re-imaged to the back
focal plane (BFP) of the objective to generate a Line Bessel Sheet. ETLa and ETLb
control the axial position of the light sheet and image plane respectively. The steering
mirror (SM), conjugate to the BFP of the objective, controls the position of the light
sheet at the sample plane (See also Supplementary Figure 1). b, Schematic of the
integration of the prism and AFM in the sample space. c, Side-view LSFM image of a
RAW 264.7 cell expressing HaloTag F-tractin labeled with Janelia Fluor 549 (green) and
a polystyrene bead attached to an AFM cantilever coated with fluorescent IgG
(magenta). Scale bar = 5 µm.

Figure 2 | Volumetric imaging of vimentin cytoskeleton and lysosome movement.
a, LSFM volumetric imaging of a live HeLa cell with labeled Lysotracker Red (magenta)
and vimentin-mEmerald (green). Each volume consists of 75 slices per color acquired at
5 ms exposure time and 5 ms readout time; the total volume acquisition time is 1.5 s. A
100 ms delay is taken between volumes. Insets show dynamics of vesicles on the
single-second timescale. Voxel size: 106 x 106 x 220 nm. Total volume: 29.3 x 26.3 x
16.5 µm (See Supplementary Video 1). b, LSFM volumetric image of a fixed HeLa cell
with labeled actin (AlexaFluor 568-Phalloidin - magenta) and vimentin-mEmerald
(green). The volume consists of 300 slices per color acquired at 5 ms exposure time
and 5 ms readout time; the total volume acquisition time is 6 s. Voxel size: 106 x 106 x
108 nm. Total volume: 52.6 x 19.1 x 32.4 µm (See Supplementary Video 2). c,
Selected side-view image from the volume data set shown in (b). A single-pixel line
scan (dashed white line) through the actin channel shows we resolve individual filopodia
at the above volume acquisition rate with adequate signal-to-noise (inset). Scale bar = 5

Figure 3 | Side-view visualization and force characterization of phagocytic cup
formation using LSFM and AFM. a, A cartoon of the experimental procedure. The
base end of the cantilever is lowered using the z-piezo such that the bead is located < 1
um above the cell. Holding the z-piezo position fixed for a 30 min dwell, the cell is
imaged in side view and forces are measured as the macrophage attempts to engulf the
bead. We note that the bead is affixed to the much larger cantilever and therefore
cannot be fully engulfed. b, A circular kymograph is formed by drawing a 5 pixel thick
circle around the bead circumference and plotting the average intensity across this 5
pixel line vs. position along the circle. The unfurled intensity plots for each image frame
are then put together in a kymograph as depicted in bottom representation of b. The red
dashed line marks the equator of the bead tip. c, A fixed LS image sequence of the
RAW 264.7 cell stably expressing HaloTag F-tractin labeled with JaneliaFluor 549 and
illuminated using a 561 nm vertical line Bessel light sheet (see also Supplementary
Video 3). Each image corresponds to its labelled orange dashed line in (d): 1, the cell
before phagocytic cup formation, 2, at initial cup formation, 3, point where cup reaches

the bead equator, 4, mature cup showing punctate actin. Scale bar = 5 µm. Bead tip
was coated in AlexaFluor488-conjugated IgG, and was imaged in a separate channel
with 488 nm laser (bead channel not shown). Each channel was imaged for 300 ms with
100 ms delay between channels. d, Circular kymograph depicting the actin intensity
around the bead tip over the course of the experiment (retraction data not shown). Note
for intensity scale for d is optimized for clarity and does not correspond to that of c.
Position along circumference is represented in radians on left axis and in µm on right
axis. The dashed horizontal red lines in the kymograph represent the equator of the
bead. The white lines represent the edge of the phagocytic cup, taken as 11% of the
maximum intensity. Lower part of the kymograph represents the right side of the bead.

Figure 4 | Correlation of Force and Actin Dynamics. a, Three regions of the
macrophage were selected for actin intensity analysis: region 1 (R1), the cup, region 2
(R2), the left edge and region 3 (R3), right edge of cell where much ruffling and
filopodia activity were present (See Supplementary Video 4). Note the regions are
non-overlapping. b, Raw force data and intensity data time series for the corresponding
image above. c, Time evolution correlation coefficient for force and intensity for each
region at zero time lag. The cross correlation calculation (see text for details) was done
on a 240 s window of data at increments of 2 s over the whole data set. Both force and
intensity data were high pass filtered prior to cross correlation calculation to remove
offset and slope (frequency cut off = 0.5 mHz). d-f, show the correlation strength as a
function of time lag across the whole duration of the phagocytic process for each region.

Figure 5 | LSFM volumetric imaging and force measurement of macrophage
phagocytosis. a, Image sequence of actin dynamics during phagocytosis. RAW 264.7
cells expressing HaloTag F-tractin labelled with JaneliaFluor 549 and the beaded tip,
labelled with AlexaFluor488-conjugated IgG, were illuminated with a 561 nm and 488
nm vertical line Bessel light sheet, respectively (see also Supplementary Video 5).
Voxel size: 106 x 106 x 200 nm. Total volume: 28.1 x 21.7 x 19.0 µm. Time stamps
represent the time at the end of the volume scan. Each slice was imaged for 10 ms with
5 ms allotted readout time. Each two-color volume is 2.85 s in total with 7 s delay
between colors to reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity for the half hour experiment
duration. The first image corresponds to a point before the cup has started, the second
to a point where the cup is forming and protruding up the bead, and the third, to a point
where the cup has matured. Parts of a second cell show up in the background. b, Force
data synchronized to the imaging. A lowpass filter with cut off frequency of 0.064 Hz
was applied to the data for visualization purposes. Red lines on the force curve mark
the corresponding volume frames in (a). c, A maximal image projection in the xy plane
with accompanying intensity plot captured at 866.8 s shows bright, punctate actin
structures are regularly separated by ~1.5 µm around and underneath the bead tip.
Scale bar = 2 µm. (see also Supplementary Video 6).
