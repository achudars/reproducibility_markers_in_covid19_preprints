Abstract

28

In Firmicutes, the nutrient-sensing regulators (p)ppGpp, the effector molecule of the

29

stringent response, and CodY work in tandem to maintain bacterial fitness during infection.

30

Here, we tested (p)ppGpp and codY mutant strains of Enterococcus faecalis in a catheter-

31

associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) mouse model and used global transcriptional

32

analysis to investigate the (p)ppGpp and CodY relationship. Absence of (p)ppGpp or single

33

inactivation of codY led to lower bacterial loads in catheterized bladders, and diminished biofilm

34

formation on fibrinogen-coated surfaces under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Single inactivation

35

of the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase rel did not affect virulence supporting

36

previous evidence that association of (p)ppGpp with enterococcal virulence is not dependent on

37

activation of the stringent response. Inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0 strain restored E.

38

faecalis virulence in the CAUTI model as well as the ability to form biofilms in vitro.

39

Transcriptome analysis revealed that inactivation of codY restores, for the most part, the

40

dysregulated metabolism of (p)ppGpp0 cells. While a clear linkage between (p)ppGpp and CodY

41

with expression of virulence factors could not be established, targeted transcriptional analysis

42

indicate that a possible association between (p)ppGpp and c-di-AMP signaling pathways in

43

response to the conditions found in the bladder may plays a role in enterococcal CAUTI.

44

Collectively, this study identifies the (p)ppGpp-CodY network as an important contributor to

45

enterococcal virulence in catheterized mouse bladder and supports that basal (p)ppGpp pools

46

and CodY promote virulence through maintenance of a balanced metabolism during adverse

47

conditions.

the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections that are

54

often difficult to treat due to the exceptional multidrug resistance of some isolates.

55

Understanding the mechanisms by which E. faecalis causes CAUTI will aid in the discovery of

56

new druggable targets to treat these infections. In this study, we report the importance of two

nutrient-sensing bacterial regulators, named (p)ppGpp and CodY, for the ability of E. faecalis to

58

infect the catheterized bladder of mice.

Introduction

61

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are one of the most common

62

hospital-acquired infections, accounting worldwide for about 40% of all nosocomial infections (1-

63

3). In addition to substantially increasing hospitalization time and costs, CAUTI can lead to

64

serious and potentially deadly secondary bloodstream infections (4). Complicated CAUTI is

65

often the result of bacteria forming biofilms on indwelling urinary catheters, and enterococci

66

(mainly Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium) appear as the second leading cause of

67

complicated CAUTI in many healthcare facilities (4-6). In addition, E. faecalis and E. faecium

68

are major etiological agents of other life-threatening infections such as infective endocarditis,

69

and an even more serious threat to public health due to their exceptional antibiotic resistance

70

(7). The recent rise in enterococcal infections urges the development of new therapies, and

71

understanding the mechanisms that promote E. faecalis CAUTI might uncover new druggable

72

targets.

73

The pathogenic potential of E. faecalis, and of all enterococci in general, is tightly

74

associated with their outstanding ability to survive an array of physical and chemical stresses,

75

including common detergents and antiseptics, fluctuations in temperature, pH, humidity, and

76

prolonged starvation (7). The regulatory second messengers ppGpp (guanosine

77

tetraphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine pentaphosphate), collectively known as (p)ppGpp,

78

broadly promote bacterial stress tolerance and virulence (8, 9). In E. faecalis, (p)ppGpp has

79

been shown to promote virulence in invertebrate and vertebrate animal models, and to mediate

80

expression of virulence-related traits such as growth in blood and serum, biofilm formation,

81

intraphagocytic survival and antibiotic tolerance (10-17). Originally described as the mediator of

82

the stringent response (SR) (8), (p)ppGpp has distinct effects on bacterial physiology; at low

83

(basal) concentrations it fine-tunes bacterial metabolism to adjust cellular growth in response to

84

mild environmental changes (18), whereas at high levels it activates the SR responsible for

85

promoting cell survival by slowing down growth-associated pathways and activating stress

86

survival pathways (8, 18).

87

Two enzymes, the bifunctional synthetase/hydrolase Rel and the small alarmone

88

synthetase RelQ, are responsible for enterococcal (p)ppGpp turnover (10, 19). Despite both

89

Δrel and ΔrelΔrelQ strains being unable to mount the SR (10, 13), there are fundamental

90

differences in basal (p)ppGpp levels between these two strains. Specifically, while the double

91

mutant, herein (p)ppGpp0 strain, is completely unable to synthesize (p)ppGpp, basal (p)ppGpp

92

pools are about 4-fold higher in the Δrel strain due to the constitutively and weak synthetase

93

activity of RelQ (10, 14, 19). Accumulated evidence indicates that the metabolic control exerted

94

by basal (p)ppGpp pools is more important during enterococcal infections than the semi-

95

dormancy state characteristic of the SR (10, 13-17). This is exemplified by the distinct virulence

96

phenotypes of Δrel and (p)ppGpp0 strains, both unable to mount the SR . Specifically, while only

97

the (p)ppGpp0 strain displayed attenuated virulence in Caenorhabditis elegans (10), Galleria

98

mellonella (11, 13, 16) and in a rabbit abscess model (15), the Δrel single mutant strain showed

99

attenuated virulence in a rabbit model of infective endocarditis (17).

100

In low-GC Gram-positive bacteria such as E. faecalis, (p)ppGpp controls transcription of

101

nutrient uptake and amino acid biosynthesis genes via the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-

102

and GTP-sensing CodY regulator (20). It follows that (p)ppGpp accumulation during BCAA

103

starvation severely depletes intracellular GTP pools in all Firmicutes such that CodY regulation

104

is severely impaired due to depletion of its two co-factors (20). We recently confirmed the

105

existence of the (p)ppGpp-CodY network in E. faecalis and demonstrated that inactivation of

106

codY restored several phenotypes of the (p)ppGpp0 mutant strain, including virulence in G.

107

mellonella (16). However, the contribution of the global nutritional regulator CodY to

108

enterococcal pathogenesis in mammalian hosts remains unknown.

109

In this work, we examined the contribution of the (p)ppGpp and CodY to the

110

pathogenesis of E. faecalis in a murine CAUTI model (21). We discovered that, in separate,

111

basal levels of (p)ppGpp and the transcriptional regulator CodY promote biofilm formation in

112

urine under in vitro conditions as well as virulence in a murine CAUTI model. Global

113

transcriptome analysis validate earlier findings that deletion of codY restores, at least in part, the

114

dysregulated metabolism of the cell in the absence of (p)ppGpp. Finally, targeted mRNA

115

quantifications reveal that the (p)ppGpp/CodY network alters expression of genes coding for

116

cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) biosynthetic enzymes and of CAUTI virulence

117

factors. Altogether, this study identifies the (p)ppGpp-CodY network as a contributor to

118

enterococcal catheter colonization in the urinary tract and further supports that basal levels of

119

(p)ppGpp promote bacterial virulence through maintenance of a balanced bacterial metabolism.

Results
The (p)ppGpp0 and ΔcodY strains show impaired colonization in a murine CAUTI

123

model. We compared the ability of the E. faecalis OG1RF parent, Δrel, ΔrelQ, (p)ppGpp0,

124

ΔcodY and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains to colonize and persist in the bladder of catheterized mice.

125

Briefly, catheters were implanted into the bladder of C57BL/6Ncr mice prior to transurethral

126

inoculation with ~ 2 x 107 CFU of each designated strain. Three days post-infection, the OG1RF

127

strain was readily recovered from bladders (6.3 ± 0.6 log10 CFU) and catheters (6.0 ± 0.3 log10

128

CFU) of all infected animals (Fig. 1). Inactivation of rel (Δrel) or relQ (ΔrelQ) did not significantly

129

alter E. faecalis colonization in bladders, but recovery of ΔrelQ from catheters was significantly

130

lower (~ 0.8 log10 reduction, p =0.0027 when compared to OG1RF). On the other hand, the

131

(p)ppGpp0 strain displayed ~ 0.8 log10 (p=0.0015) and 1.5 log10 (p<0.0001) reductions in CFU

132

recovered from bladders and catheters, respectively (Fig. 1). The ΔcodY strain phenocopied the

133

(p)ppGpp0 strain showing ~ 0.8 log10 reductions in CFU recovered from both bladders

134

(p=0.0156) and catheters (p=0.0031) (Fig. 1). However, inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0

135

background [(p)ppGpp0ΔcodY triple mutant] restored bacterial bladder and catheter colonization

136

to near parent strain levels. In relative agreement with the bacterial loads detected on catheters

137

and in bladders, only the OG1RF and Δrel strains were consistently able to ascend and persist

138

in mice kidneys three days post-infection (Fig. 1C).

139
140

(p)ppGpp promotes timely growth of E. faecalis in human urine. The (p)ppGpp0

141

strain was previously shown to have growth and survival defects in whole blood and serum (15,

142

16). Interestingly, inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0 background [(p)ppGpp0ΔcodY] restored

143

the (p)ppGpp0 growth defect in blood but not in serum (16). Here, we tested the ability of

144

(p)ppGpp-defective (Δrel, ΔrelQ and (p)ppGpp0) and codY (ΔcodY and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY)

145

strains to replicate in pooled human urine ex vivo. Despite the colonization defect in the murine

146

CAUTI model (Fig. 1), the ΔcodY strain grew as well as the parent and ΔrelQ strains (Fig. 2).

147

On the other hand, Δrel, (p)ppGpp0, and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains grew slower in the first 12

148

hours of incubation, with ~ 0.6 log10 CFU difference at 3 and 7 hours post-inoculation (Fig. 2).

149

Nevertheless, upon entering stationary phase, all strains reached similar growth yields and

150

remained viable for at least 24 hours.

151
152

(p)ppGpp and CodY support biofilm formation in urine. Biofilm formation on urinary

153

catheters is critical for enterococcal CAUTI (22-24). This is exemplified by the observation that

154

E. faecalis OG1RF requires the presence of a catheter to persist for more than 48 hours in

155

murine bladders (21). Follow up studies revealed that catheterization, in mice and in humans,

156

triggers an inflammatory response that releases the host protein fibrinogen, which is used by E.

157

faecalis as a nutrient as well as a scaffold to adhere and colonize the catheter surface (22-25).

158

Taking into account that the reduction in bacterial counts of ΔrelQ, (p)ppGpp0 and ΔcodY strains

159

was more pronounced on catheters than in bladders (Fig. 1) and that (p)ppGpp supports long-

160

term survival of E. faecalis in biofilms (12), we sought to investigate if the attenuated virulence

161

of these strains in murine CAUTI was linked to a reduced ability to form biofilms on fibrinogen-

162

coated surfaces in the presence of urine. Since catheterization normally elicits proteinuria in the

163

host, and E. faecalis requires a protein source to optimally form biofilms in urine (22, 24), human

164

urine was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA). In agreement with the bacterial

165

loads obtained from the implanted catheters (Fig. 1B), quantifications of E. faecalis biofilm

166

biomass revealed that ΔrelQ, (p)ppGpp0 and ΔcodY strains were deficient in biofilm production

167

while the Δrel strain phenocopied the parent OG1RF strain (Fig. 3A). Notably, inactivation of

168

codY in the (p)ppGpp0 background alleviated the defective phenotype of the (p)ppGpp0 strain

169

albeit the differences between the (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY and OG1RF strains were still statistically

170

significant.

171

As indicated above, the main factor involved in E. faecalis biofilm formation on urinary

172

catheters is production of the Ebp pilus, which binds directly to fibrinogen via the EbpA N-

173

terminal domain (22, 26, 27). Quantification of EbpA via ELISA showed no noticeable reductions

174

in EbpA production in any of the mutant strains (Fig. 3B) suggesting that the (p)ppGpp/CodY

175

network promotes biofilm formation of fibrinogen-coated surfaces in an Ebp-independent

176

manner.

177
178

Inactivation of codY restores the dysregulated metabolism of the (p)ppGpp0 strain.

179

Previously, we proposed that the virulence attenuation of the (p)ppGpp0 strain in different animal

180

models is, in large part, due to the dysregulated metabolism caused by lack of (p)ppGpp control

181

(13, 14, 16). By monitoring H2O2 production and the culture pH, we provided the first evidence

182

that inactivation of codY restored a balanced metabolism to the (p)ppGpp0 background strain

183

(16). To obtain additional insights into the (p)ppGpp-CodY relationship, we used RNA

184

sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to compare the transcriptome of OG1RF, (p)ppGpp0 and

185

(p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains grown to mid-exponential phase in the chemically-defined FMC

186

medium (28) supplemented with 10 mM glucose (FMCG). In the (p)ppGpp0 strain, 690 genes

187

were differentially expressed when compared to OG1RF (Table S1, p < 0.05, 2-fold cutoff),

188

representing ~ 27% of the entire E. faecalis OG1RF genome. In agreement with a previous

189

microarray analysis (14), multiple PTS systems as well as citrate, glycerol, malate and serine

190

utilization pathways were strongly induced in the (p)ppGpp0 strain under these conditions. A

191

selected and representative number of dysregulated transport and metabolic genes in the

192

(p)ppGpp0 strain are shown, respectively, in Tables 1 and 2. The upregulation of alternate

193

carbon metabolism genes that are expected to be under carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in

194

the glucose-rich condition of the FMCG medium indicates that complete lack of (p)ppGpp places

195

E. faecalis in what we have originally termed a “transcriptionally-relaxed” state (14). When

196

compared to the parent strain, 737 genes (~ 29% of entire genome) were differentially

197

expressed in the (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY triple mutant strain (Table S2, p < 0.05, 2-fold cutoff). Despite

198

the even large number of differentially expressed genes, inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0

199

background strain normalized transcription of 274 genes that were dysregulated in the

200

(p)ppGpp0 background (Table S3). The great majority (~ 95%) of these genes were upregulated

201

in the (p)ppGpp0 strain, supporting that deletion of codY abrogates, at least in part, the

202

“transcriptionally-relaxed” state of the (p)ppGpp0 mutant. More specifically, inactivation of codY

203

in the (p)ppGpp0 background normalized transcription (or brought to levels much closer to the

204

parent strain) of ~ 70 transport systems as well as over 130 metabolic genes including citrate,

205

glycerol, malate, and serine utilization pathways, dehydrogenases, and molybdenum-dependent

206

enzymes (Table S3).

208

Dysregulation of c-di-AMP homeostasis may affect fitness of (p)ppGpp0 and

209

ΔcodY strains in urine. Previously, the Ebp pilus and two high-affinity manganese

210

transporters, EfaCBA and MntH2, were shown to be essential for E. faecalis virulence in a

211

mouse CAUTI model (27, 29). In an attempt to identify (p)ppGpp- and CodY-dependent

212

processes directly relevant to enterococcal CAUTI, we compared the transcriptional profile of

213

these virulence factors in parent and mutant strains. In brief, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)

214

was used to compare expression of selected genes in exponentially-grown BHI cultures of

215

OG1RF, ΔcodY, (p)ppGpp0 and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains before and after switching to pooled

216

human urine. We found that transcription of ebpA (coding for the pilin sub-unit), efaC (the ATP-

217

binding subunit of the ABC-type transporter EfaCBA) and mntH2 was strongly induced upon

218

shifting the parent strain culture from BHI to urine (Fig. 4). While full upregulation of efaC in

219

urine appears to be dependent on CodY, ebpA and mntH2 transcription was differentially

220

impacted by (p)ppGpp and CodY. Specifically, while inactivation of CodY (ΔcodY) limited

221

induction of these genes after transition to urine, loss of (p)ppGpp induced transcription of ebpA

222

and mntH2 by ~ 10-fold. Simultaneous inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0 background

223

[(p)ppGpp0ΔcodY] modestly raised ebpA but fully restored mntH2 mRNA levels (Fig. 4).

224

We also assessed transcription levels of genes coding for enzymes involved in c-di-AMP

225

metabolism, a nucleotide second messenger essential for osmotic stress survival and whose

226

regulatory network appears to be intertwined with the (p)ppGpp regulatory network in other

227

bacteria (30-34). In the OG1RF strain, transcription of the c-di-AMP cyclase cdaA was not

228

significantly altered upon transition from BHI to urine; however, transcription of both c-di-AMP

229

hydrolases (pde and gdpP) was induced by  50- to 100-fold, respectively (Fig. 4). While

230

induction of gdpP was dependent on CodY, activation of pde in urine was not as robust in all

231

mutants strains. Unexpectedly, cdaA transcription was strongly induced ( 50-fold) in the

232

(p)ppGpp0 strain when shifted from BHI to urine, suggesting that c-di-AMP levels may be

233

dysregulated in the (p)ppGpp0 strain during CAUTI. Notably, c-di-AMP pools must be tightly

234

controlled given that it is essential for growth but also highly toxic when present at high

235

concentrations (35).

236
237

Discussion

238

In this report, we showed that basal (p)ppGpp pools and the transcriptional regulator

239

CodY mediate virulence of E. faecalis in a murine CAUTI model. These results corroborates

240

previous findings that changes in basal levels of (p)ppGpp contribute to the virulence of E.

241

faecalis (10, 11, 13, 15, 17) and show, for the first time, that CodY regulation is also important

242

for the virulence of E. faecalis. Despite the attenuated virulence of the ΔcodY, ΔrelQ and

243

(p)ppGpp0 strains, simultaneous inactivation of both regulatory pathways [(p)ppGpp0ΔcodY

244

strain] restored virulence to near parent strain levels. While this finding may appear

245

contradictory, it is in line with previous studies showing that inactivation of codY restores

246

virulence of (p)ppGpp0 strains in Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (36, 37).

247

The association between (p)ppGpp and CodY, by which (p)ppGpp upregulates gene

248

transcription via GTP depletion and concomitant alleviation of CodY repression, has been well

249

established (20). We previously found that the (p)ppGpp and CodY regulatory networks are also

250

intertwined in E. faecalis by showing that inactivation of codY restored phenotypes of the

251

(p)ppGpp0 strain, such as the inability to grow in whole blood ex vivo and reduced virulence in

252

the G. mellonella invertebrate model (16). By comparing final culture pH and H2O2 production of

253

(p)ppGpp0 and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains, we hypothesized that deletion of codY restores a

254

balanced metabolism to the (p)ppGpp0 strain (14, 16). The RNA-seq analysis reported here

255

clearly supports this observation as multiple genes coding for alternate carbon utilization

256

pathways were strongly upregulated in the (p)ppGpp0 strain but not in the (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY

257

triple mutant strain.

258

Our results also indicate that restoration of global metabolism in the (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY

259

strain when compared to the (p)ppGpp0 strain may be particularly relevant in experimental

260

CAUTI. Specifically, we show that while absence of either (p)ppGpp or CodY results in defects

261

in biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo, simultaneous inactivation of the (p)ppGpp and CodY

262

regulatory systems restores CAUTI virulence and partially restores in vitro biofilm formation to

263

near parent strain levels (Fig 1. and Fig. 3). Considering that the levels of the surface protein

264

EbpA was not altered in any of the mutant strains (Fig. 3), we propose that (p)ppGpp and CodY

265

promote biofilm formation on urinary catheters by mediating the metabolic rearrangements

266

required for biofilm growth and survival in urine. In fact, a comparative transcriptome analysis

267

reveals that several metabolic pathways previously identified as relevant to enterococcal

268

adaptation to growth in urine (38) overlap with the (p)ppGpp and CodY regulons (13, 14, 20).

269

For example, transcriptional activation of alternate carbon utilization and amino acid

270

biosynthesis/transport genes in response to the relatively low urinary concentrations of amino

271

acids and glucose (38-41) are shown here to be regulated by (p)ppGpp and CodY (Table S1,

272

Table 1 and Table 2) (13, 14, 20).

273

In an attempt to identify specific (p)ppGpp- and CodY-regulated processes that are

274

important for CAUTI, we used qPCR to compare transcription of known virulence factors such

275

as the Ebp pilus and the metal transporters EfaCBA and MntH2 (27, 29) in parent and mutant

276

strains. Although there were significant alterations in transcription of ebpA, efaC and mntH2 in

277

the (p)ppGpp and codY mutant strains, it was not possible to establish a firm correlation

278

between the transcriptional expression of these virulence factors and the attenuated virulence

279

phenotypes shown in Figure 1. Due to the association of c-di-AMP signaling with biofilm

280

formation (33, 34) and adaptation to osmotic stress (31, 32) – two relevant traits during CAUTI –

281

and the previous linkage with (p)ppGpp signaling (30, 35, 42), we similarly assessed gene

282

expression of the enzymes responsible for c-di-AMP synthesis (cdaA) and degradation (pde and

283

gdpP). c-di-AMP is an emerging regulatory nucleotide shown to control a number of cellular

284

processes, including potassium homeostasis, osmotic adaptation and biofilm formation (35). In

285

addition, previous investigations revealed an intricate but poorly understood association

286

between the c-di-AMP and (p)ppGpp signaling networks, in which (p)ppGpp regulates c-di-AMP

287

levels by serving as an allosteric regulator of c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes,

288

while c-di-AMP stimulates (p)ppGpp synthesis via an unknown mechanism (30, 35, 42). The

289

strong activation of pde and gdpP in the parent strain upon shift to urine suggests that

290

intracellular c-di-AMP levels decrease in the presence of urine. This is not surprising

291

considering that salt concentrations in urine are generally high (average osmolality between 300

292

to 900 mOsm/kg H2O), and that low c-di-AMP pools are associated with bacterial salt tolerance

293

(43) whereas increased c-di-AMP levels are linked to salt hypersensitivity (44-46). Interestingly,

294

transcription of the c-di-AMP synthetase gene (cdaA) in urine was approximately 100-fold higher

295

in the (p)ppGpp0 strain when compared to the parent strain, indicating that c-di-AMP

296

homeostasis may be severely disrupted in the (p)ppGpp0 strain. Finally, transcription of the pde

297

and gdpP genes was not as strongly induced (or not induced at all) in the (p)ppGpp0 and ΔcodY

298

strains. While the cellular levels c-di-AMP in cells grown in urine remain to be determined, and

299

the possibility of the (p)ppGpp/c-di-AMP signaling crosstalk in E. faecalis confirmed, the qPCR

300

analysis suggests that E. faecalis lowers c-di-AMP pools to adjust its metabolism to the

301

environment (i.e. high osmolality) encountered in urine.

302

By comparing the genes restored by codY inactivation in our RNA-Seq analysis (Table

303

S1, Table 1 and Table 2) to the transcriptome of E. faecalis OG1RF grown in urine (38), several

304

other common pathways were identified providing additional leads as to why alleviation of CodY

305

repression restored the biofilm defect of the (p)ppGpp0 strain. Specifically, Vebø et al. showed

306

that transcription of a major glycerol uptake system was induced when the OG1RF strain was

307

grown in urine ex vivo, suggesting that E. faecalis utilizes glycerol as a source of energy to grow

308

and survive in urine (38). Notably, aerobic metabolism of glycerol by the GlpO enzyme is also

309

the main source of H2O2 generation in E. faecalis (47) and E. faecalis activates transcription of

310

several oxidative genes (such as sodA, npr and trxB) when grown in urine (38), possibly to cope

311

with increased ROS generation caused by aerobic glycerol metabolism. In agreement with

312

previous microarray data (14), the current RNA-seq analysis revealed that transcription of

313

glycerol catabolic genes, such as glpO and gldA2, was activated by 6-fold or more in the

314

(p)ppGpp0 strain (Table S1, Table 2), likely augmenting ROS production in the urinary tract.

315

Another possibility, which is not mutually exclusive from the others, is that the strong (~ 20-fold)

316

upregulation of molybdenum metabolism genes in the (p)ppGpp0 strain is disadvantageous to E.

317

faecalis when grown in the urinary tract environment. Molybdenum is a rare transition metal that

318

functions as a co-factor of several redox active enzymes (48-50); it should be noted that

319

urothione, the degradation product of the molybdenum cofactor in humans, is excreted in urine

320

(51). In contrast to other metal co-factors, molybdenum is catalytically active only when

321

complexed with a pterin-based scaffold, forming the Moco prosthetic group (50). The Moco

322

biosynthetic genes that are highly induced in the (p)ppGpp0 mutant strain code for enzymes that

323

require GTP and the oxygen-reactive iron and copper metals (50), possibly linking molybdenum

324

metabolism to (p)ppGpp and oxidative stress. Finally, E. faecalis appears to downregulate

325

serine catabolism in urine (38). However, serine dehydratases were among the most highly

326

expressed genes in the (p)ppGpp0 strain (~ 100-fold), likely favoring pyruvate generation

327

instead of protein synthesis. While it is unknown how serine catabolism and dysregulation of

328

other metabolic and transport pathways affect biofilm formation and virulence in E. faecalis,

329

alleviation of CodY repression for the most part restored transcription of these genes to wild-

330

type levels.

331

Collectively, the results presented here reveal that (p)ppGpp and CodY support E.

332

faecalis presence in the catheterized murine urinary tract by controlling the metabolic

333

arrangements necessary for the fitness of E. faecalis in this environment and, possibly, by

334

modulating biofilm formation. Future studies using global transcriptome and metabolome

336

coupled with characterization of pathways relevant to biofilm formation in urine, are necessary

337

to fully understand how alleviation of CodY repression restores biofilm formation in the absence

338

of (p)ppGpp. In addition, the relevance of c-di-AMP signaling to enterococcal CAUTI and the

339

relationship between (p)ppGpp and c-di-AMP signaling pathways will warrant further

340

investigations. In this regard, work is underway to determine the scope and targets of c-di-AMP

341

regulation in E. faecalis. These studies should expand our mechanistic understanding of how

342

global metabolic regulators such as CodY, (p)ppGpp and possibly c-di-AMP mediate

343

enterococcal pathogenesis in the urinary tract and beyond.

Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The parent E. faecalis OG1RF strain and its

347

derivatives rel, relQ, relrelQ [(p)ppGpp0], ΔcodY and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains have been

348

previously described (10, 16). All strains were routinely grown in BHI at 37°C. For RNA-seq

349

analysis, overnight cultures of E. faecalis OG1RF, (p)ppGpp0, and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY strains

350

were diluted in a 1:100 ratio in 50 ml of the chemically-defined FMC medium (28) supplemented

351

with 10 mM glucose (FMCG) and allowed to grow statically at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.3. Growth

352

in pooled human urine from healthy donors (Lee Biosolutions) was monitored as described

353

elsewhere, with minor modifications (29). Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in PBS

354

and inoculated 1:100 for growth assessment in urine. Cultures were incubated aerobically at

355

37°C and, at selected time-points, aliquots were serially diluted and plated on TSA plates for

356

colony-forming unit (CFU) determination. To determine the transcriptional responses of selected

357

genes upon transition from laboratory media to human urine, overnight cultures grown in BHI

358

were diluted 1:20 in 5 ml of fresh sterile BHI and allowed to grow statically at 37°C to an OD600

359

of 0.5. The bacterial cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.0) and pelleted down by

360

centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 8 min. After washing, pellets were resuspended in 7.5 ml filter

Mouse catheter implantation and infection. The mice used in this study were 6-week-old

365

female wild-type C57BL/6Ncr mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were

366

subjected to transurethral implantation and inoculated as previously described (21). Mice were

367

anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and implanted with a 5-mm length platinum-cured

368

silicone catheter. When indicated, mice were infected immediately following catheter

369

implantation with 50 µl of ~2 × 107 CFU of bacteria in PBS introduced into the bladder lumen by

370

transurethral inoculation as previously described (21). To harvest the catheters and organs,

371

mice were sacrificed 3 days post-infection by cervical dislocation after anesthesia inhalation;

372

silicone catheter, bladder and kidneys were aseptically harvested. The Washington University

373

Animal Studies Committee approved all mouse infections and procedures as part of protocol

Biofilm formation in human urine. For assessment of biofilm formation on fibrinogen-coated

379

96-well polystyrene plates (Grenier CellSTAR), wells were coated overnight at 4°C with 100 µg

380

ml-1 human fibrinogen free of plasminogen and von Willebrand Factor (Enzyme Research

381

Laboratory). The next day, E. faecalis overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density

382

(OD600) of 0.2 in BHI broth. The diluted cultures were centrifuged, washed three times with 1x

383

PBS, and diluted 1:100 in urine supplemented with 20 mg ml-1 BSA. Bacterial cells were

384

allowed to attach to the fibrinogen-coated plate at 37°C under static conditions as described

385

in(29, 52). After 24 hours, microplates were washed with PBS to remove unbound bacteria and

386

biofilm formation assessed by staining wells with crystal violet as previously described (52).

Excess dye was removed by rinsing with sterile water and then plates were allowed to dry at

388

room temperature. Biofilms were resuspended with 200 µl of 33% acetic acid and the

Presence of EbpA on the cell surface of (p)ppGpp- and CodY-deficient strains. Surface

393

expression of EbpA by E. faecalis OG1RF and derivatives was determined by ELISA as

394

previously described (23). Bacterial strains were grown for 18 hours in urine supplemented with

395

20 mg ml-1 of BSA. Then bacterial cells were washed (3 times) with PBS, normalized to an

396

OD600 of 0.5, resuspended with 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) containing 0.1% sodium azide

397

and used (100 µl) to coat Immulon 4HBX microtiter plates overnight at 4°C. The next day, plates

398

were 3 times washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) to remove unbound

399

bacteria and blocked for 2 h with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)–0.1% sodium azide–PBS

400

followed by three PBS-T washes. EbpA surface expression was detected using mouse anti-

401

EbpAFull antisera, which was diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1%

402

BSA, and 0.5% methyl α-d-mannopyronoside) before serial dilutions were performed. A 100-μl

403

volume was added to the plate, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h. Subsequently,

404

plates were washed with PBS-T, incubated for 1h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antisera

405

(1:2,000), and washed again with PBS-T. Detection was performed using a TMB substrate

406

reagent set (BD). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min to allow color to develop, and

407

the reactions were then stopped by the addition of 1.0 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance was

408

determined at 450 nm. Titers were defined by the last dilution with an A450 of at least 0.2. As an

409

additional control, rabbit anti-Streptococcus group D antiserum was used to verify that whole

410

cells of all strains were bound to the microtiter plates at similar levels. EbpA expression titers

411

were normalized against the bacterial titers at the same dilution.

rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and resuspended in 4 ml of sterile RNA stabilizing solution [3.5 M

415

(NH4)2SO4, 16.6 mM sodium citrate, 13.3 mM EDTA, adjusted to a pH of 5.2 with H2SO4]. After

416

a 10 min incubation at room temperature, cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C,

417

and pellets were stored at - 80°C. RNA was extracted using the hot acid-phenol:chloroform

418

method previously described (53). Subsequently, precipitated RNA was treated once with

419

DNase I (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA), followed by a second DNase I treatment using the DNA-free

420

kit (Ambion) to completely remove DNA, divalent cations and traces of the DNase I enzyme

(204). RNA concentrations were quantified with the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer

422

(NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE) and RNA quality assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent,

423

Santa Clara, CA). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), data processing and statistical analysis was

Figure 1. (p)ppGpp and CodY promote virulence of E. faecalis in a murine CAUTI model.

472

The parent strain OG1RF and its derivatives were inoculated into the bladder of mice

473

immediately after catheter implantation (n = 10). After 72 hours, animals were euthanized and

474

bacterial burdens in (A) bladders, (B) catheters and (C) kidneys were quantified. Graphs show

475

total CFU recovered from these sites, each symbol represents an individual mouse, and the

476

median value is shown as a horizontal line. Symbols on the dashed line indicate that recovery

477

was below the limit of detection (LOD, 40 CFU). The data was pooled from two independent

478

experiments. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to determine significance (*p <

479

0.05, **p < 0.005, ****p < 0.0001).

482

parent E. faecalis OG1RF and its derivative mutant strains in pooled human urine. Aliquots at

483

selected time points were serially diluted and plated on TSA plates for CFU enumeration. The

484

graph shows the average log10-transformed CFU mean and standard deviations of three

485

independent experiments. Mutant strains were compared to wild-type OG1RF by a two-way

486

ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test Asterisks indicate significant differences at 3

487

hours of incubation for Δrel, (p)ppGpp0 and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY and at 7 hours of incubation for

488

Δrel and (p)ppGpp0ΔcodY (p <0.0001).

491

Fibrinogen-coated 96-well polystyrene plates were incubated with E. faecalis strains for 48

492

hours in human urine supplemented with 20 mg ml-1 BSA. Plates were stained with 0.5% crystal

493

violet, which was subsequently dissolved with 33% acetic acid and absorbance at 595 nm was

494

measured. (B) EbpA quantification in urine. Strains were grown in urine + BSA overnight prior to

495

quantification of EbpA by ELISA. EbpA surface exposure on E. faecalis cells was detected using
