Calcium signaling plays a crucial role in the physiology of the organs but also in various aspects of
the organogenesis of the embryo. High versatility of calcium signaling is encoded by the dynamic
variation of intracellular calcium concentration. While the dynamics of calcium is important, little is
known about it throughout the embryogenesis of the largest class of animals, insects. Here, we
visualize calcium dynamics throughout embryogenesis of Drosophila using a fluorescent proteinbased calcium indicator, GCaMP3, and report calcium transients in epithelium and neuronal tissues.
Local calcium transients of varying duration were detected in the outer epithelium, trachea and
neural cells. In addition, gap-junction-dependent calcium waves were identified at stage 16 in the
outer epithelium and in the trachea at stage 17. Calcium transient waveform analysis revealed
different characteristics as a function of the duration, location and frequency. Detailed
characterization of calcium transients during embryogenesis of Drosophila will help us better
understand the role of calcium signaling in embryogenesis and organogenesis of insects.

Introduction
The calcium ion is a versatile and universal
second messenger involved in the regulation
of embryogenesis (Markova et al., 2015,
Slusarski and Pelegri 2007, Webb and Miller
2003). Calcium signals have been shown to
play a central role in several developmental
processes, such as fertilization and organ
formation (Kaneuchi et al., 2015, YorkAndersen et al., 2015, Christodoulou and
Skourides 2015, Berridge, Bootman and
Roderick 2003). However, we still lack
information about calcium activity during
embryogenesis, particularly in non-excitable
tissues such as epithelia.
Intercellular calcium waves transmit local
information from the initiator cell to a large
number of cells in order to coordinate and
synchronize their activity during development
(Moreno-Juan et al., 2017; Akahoshi , Hotta
and Oka 2017, Wallingford et al 2001, Webb

and Miller 2003, Chen et al 2017, Wu,
Brodskiy, Narciso et al, 2017, Özsu and
Monteiro 2017). Surprisingly, endogenous
calcium waves during embryogenesis of
insects have not been documented. Only local
calcium transients were reported during
gastrulation (Markova et al., 2015), dorsal
closure (Hunter et al., 2014) and during the
trachea formation (Caviglia et al., 2016).
Here, using GCamp3 as a long-term, calciumsensitive indicator and confocal imaging, we
investigated the dynamics of calcium
signaling during Drosophila melanogaster
embryogenesis. We analyzed calcium
transients from the onset of gastrulation to the
end of embryogenesis and detected
endogenous intercellular calcium waves
propagating through gap junctions in the outer
epithelium and in the trachea. hese waves
occur with a reproducible spatio-temporal
pattern, suggesting their potential link to
tissue extension, cuticle deposition and
neuronal
activity.

Results
Detected calcium transients

decreases over a few hours before it increases
again during dorsal closure (11h ael) (Figure
2F).

To detect calcium activity in the fruit fly
embryo, we ubiquitously expressed GCaMP3
in the embryo using the sqh promoter
(sqh::GCaMP3, Markova et al., 2015) and
monitored the fluorescence of this indicator
throughout embryonic development. Calcium
activity is pronounced at particular stages and
in specific regions of the embryo. We focused
on epithelium tissues and detected the
following calcium activity: calcium peaks in
the outer epithelium, calcium peaks in the
trachea, calcium waves in the outer
epithelium, calcium peaks in neurons and
calcium waves in the trachea (Figure 1).
Below, we characterize each phenomenon
separately.

Calcium spikes in the outer epithelium
To extend the characterization of calcium
signals after the stage of gastrulation that we
studied previously (Markova et al., 2015) we
imaged the outer epithelium until larval
hatching and monitored calcium signals at
cellular resolution (Figure 1A, SMovie1). We
found that each of these transients is spatially
restricted to small area of 5-10 µm
corresponding to the size of one cell (Figure
2B). Calcium transients were detected in
different parts of the outer epithelium
thorough embryogenesis (Fig 2C). Temporal
projection of calcium spikes shows that
calcium spikes are present throughout the
outer epithelium (Figure 2D). Spikes last 15
+-7 sec (n = 48 spikes, N = 5 embryos,
mean+-SD Fig. 2E). The occurrence of
calcium spikes is maximal at gastrulation (3h
after egg laying (ael), thereafter the frequency

Long calcium spikes
At 9-14 h ael, we detected calcium spikes
localized a few micrometers below the
embryo surface along the margin between the
dorsal ectoderm and the amnioserosa (Figure
3A, SMovie2). By high resolution confocal

imaging, we found that many of these spikes
arise from cells that have an elongated shape
similar to tracheal cells (Figure 3B). While
single spikes occurred at different times
(Figure 3C, different snapshots), their
temporal projection reveals a clear pattern
(Fig 2D). Spikes occur on the surface of an
ellipse that marks the border between
amnioserosa and ectodermal cells (Figure
3D). The duration of these calcium spikes was
120 +/- 60 sec (n = 34 spikes) (Fig 3E) that is
much longer than those in the ectoderm
described above. The location and duration of
these long calcium spikes are very similar to
those recently reported in the trachea
(Caviglia et al. 2016). Spikes occur over a 4hour period from 9 ael with a maximum
frequency at 12 ael (Fig 3F).

Calcium waves in the outer epithelium
Between 13 and 16 h ael we found calcium
waves that propagate in the epithelium at the
surface of the embryo (Figure 4A). Calcium
waves spread over areas typically 10-30 fold
larger than single cell area (5 µm in diameter)
(Figure 4B, SMovie3). The propagation
velocity of the waves is higher along the
dorsal-ventral axis (V_dv = 6.2 +/- 3.5
µm/sec, mean+/-SD, n = 115 waves) than
along the antero-posterior axis (V_ap = 1.9
+/- 0.7 µm/sec, n = 98 waves). Waves
propagate in all directions, cross segment
boundaries (Figure 4C-D, SMovie4). The
duration of the local calcium increase in the
one cell area is 14 +/- 5 seconds (n = 123
increases, N = 6 embryos, Figure 4E).
Calcium waves start at 12h ael, reach a peak
of activity at14h ael and fully disappear after
16h ael (Figure 4F).
Finally, we noticed that the waves were
repeatedly initiated in the same locations
(Figure 4J). The initial locations of show high
accuracy: they initiated at the same location
with variability smaller than a cell size (std =
2.3 µm, N = 95 waves, Figure 4K). These
data suggest the presence of an initiator
region that generates repetitive calcium
waves.
To test if intercellular communication through
gap junctions was involved in calcium wave
propagation, we knocked-down Innexin
which is a major component of gap junctions.
Specific knocked down of Innx-2 in the
epidermis by RNAi abolished wave
propagation, but not transient spikes (Fig 4 GI). These data indicate that calcium waves
propagate in the epithelium via gap junctions.
Neuronal activity
In addition to the calcium waves that spread
on the surface of the embryo, we have
detected calcium events located in the
neurons underneath the epithelium (Figure
5A). The cells in which calcium events occur
have elongated shapes (Figure 5B, SMovie5).
Calcium events occur in different segments of
the embryo (Figure 5C) and exhibit a regular

pattern as shown in the time-projected image
(Figure 5D). The duration of the neuronal
calcium events is 9+/-7 sec (n = 27 events, N
= 4 embryos. Figure 5E). The temporal
sequence of these events is as follows: they
start at 12 h ael, reach maximum frequency at
14 h ael and disappear at 16 h ael (Figure 5F).
This temporal pattern is very similar to that of
the epithelium described above.

occur at the same stage of development, we
further quantified the extent to which their
spatiotemporal patterns are similar. We noted
that the spatiotemporal calcium characteristics
in neurons and in the outer epithelium depend
on the segment in which they occur. We
therefore quantified these calcium activities in
different segments (Figure 6). Both events
occur first in the posterior part of the embryo
(Figure 6C, D). They are then visible in the
middle and finally in the anterior part of the
embryo (Figure 6C, D). The total duration of
calcium events varies from 0.75 h in the A5
segment to 1.7 h in the A5 segment (Figure
6E). The development times at which these
events occur range from 13.3 h ael in the A5
segment to 14.4 h ael in the A1 segment
(Figure 6F). The segment-by-segment
comparison of epithelial waves and neuronal
activities show no significant difference for
all segments (Fig6 C-F). This points to a
possible link between these two calcium
events.
Tracheal waves

The spatiotemporal patterns of calcium
activity in neurons and in the outer
epithelium are not significantly different.
Since the calcium waves in the outer
epithelium and neuronal calcium activity

When calcium waves in the outer epithelium
become less frequent, the first calcium waves
appear in the trachea (Figure 7). The first
tracheal calcium waves propagate within the
segments and do not pass through the
branching points (Figure 7I). A few hours
later, calcium waves from the trachea spread
along the main trunk and secondary branches
(Figure 7B,I, SMovie7). These tracheal waves
are produced at intervals with average t = 20
+/- 15 min, N = 5 embryos, n = 37 waves,
Figure 7I. The temporal projection shows that
the waves cover the entire trachea (Figure
7C). Tracheal waves propagate in both
directions along the main trunk and secondary
branches. The propagation velocity of the
calcium wave in the inner segments of the
main trunk (V_trunk = 5.2+/-2 µm /sec, N =
51 waves) is lower than that in the secondary
branches (V_branches = 9+/-6 µm /sec N =
32 waves). Calcium waves propagating in the
main trunk are delayed at each branching
point by 6.8+/-2 sec (N = 24 waves).

To test if intercellular communication through
gap junctions was involved in trachea calcium
wave propagation, we knocked-down Innx-2
by RNAi in in the trachea, which abrogated
wave propagation, but not transient spikes
(Figure 7 D-F). These data indicate that
calcium waves propagate in the trachea via
gap junctions.
The duration of calcium increase within one
cell area was 9+/-6 sec (n = 42 events, N = 5
embryos, Figure 7G). Calcium waves in the
trachea start at 5h ael and persist until the
embryo hatches (Figure 7H).

Discussion
In this study, we performed long-term
calcium imaging of the entire Drosophila
embryo thorough embryogenesis and
characterized the calcium transients from
gastrulation to hatching. In addition to the
previous local calcium transients observed by
the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor
(Markova et al. 2015; Caviglia et al. 2016),
calcium
activity in
neuronal
cells,
intercellular calcium waves in the epithelium
and trachea were identified and characterized
by their duration, frequency and distribution
(Figure 5).
Epithelial calcium waves that we report here
coincide in time with several developmental
events: the onset of epithelial secretion and

cuticle formation (Bate and Arias 1993), the
massive expression of coherent gene
expression
(Papatsenko,
Levine,
and
Papatsenko 2010) of ion channels producing
first neural activity (Baines and Bate 1998)
and morphogenic movements that cause head
involution (Czerniak et al. 2016). All these
events could potentially be related to calcium
waves in the covering epithelium.
What determines the time window of calcium
waves? The calcium epithelial wave occurs
for a short interval at stage 16. It is unlikely
that the establishment of gap junctions is
involved in this time window, as calcium
waves could already be experimentally
induced several hours earlier (Hunter et al.
2014). In Drosophila, soluble extract of wing
disc triggers calcium epithelial waves (Balaji
et al. 2017) and morphogen regulates their
amplitude and frequency (Wu, Brodskiy,
Huizar, et al. 2017). It is possible that the
secretion of a specific molecular component
controls the embryonic calcium waves
described here. In addition, exogenous release
of mechanical load stimulates calcium
activity in the embryo (Markova et al. 2015)
and the wing disc in the pupa (Narciso et al.
2017). During the period at which epithelial
calcium waves occur, the epithelium is
actively deformed (Czerniak et al. 2016) and
during the tracheal calcium wave period, the
muscles strongly contract the embryo. Thus,
mechanical stress could potentially activate
calcium waves. Finally, the first strong
neuronal activity occurs during the epithelial
calcium wave period (Baines and Bate 1998).
We also show here a striking spatiotemporal
correspondence between the neuronal and
epithelial activities. The link between these
two calcium signals remains to be elucidated.
Calcium waves show distinct speeds of
propagation. Epithelial waves propagate more
rapidly along the dorso-ventral axis than
along the antero-posterior axis. The speed of
the tracheal waves also varies as a function of
their location in the trachea. It is possible that
the differences in wave velocity may be
related to differences in cell shape, as
reported for wound-induced calcium waves in
the wing disk (Narciso et al. 2017).

Although the specific molecular mechanisms
underlying calcium signaling associated with
Drosophila development remain to be
elucidated, our quantitative study provides a
solid resource to improve our understanding
of the role of calcium signaling during insect
embryogenesis.
Methods
Genetics. Reporter flies (Sqh::GCaMP3) were
constructed
using
classic
P-element
transgenesis as described in (Markova et al.
2015) and used in all experiments except
those involving Innx2. The UAS-GCaMP3 fly
line was purchased from the Bloomington
Drosophila Stock Centre (Fbti0131642); the
Gal4-69B fly line was a kind gift of the
Razzell Laboratory (Razzell et al. 2013); and
the RNAi UAS-dsInnx2 fly line was
purchased from the Vienna Drosophila
Resource Centre (VDRS Fbgn0027108).
Innexin RNAi embryos were obtained by
crossing Gal4-69B, UAS-GCaMP3 with
UAS-dsInnx2.
Drosophila care and embryo preparation.
The flies were raised at room temperature,
while the embryos intended for experiments
involving RNAi were raised at 29ºC to
increase the activity of Gal4 and RNAi.
Embryo imaging. Time-lapse movies have
been acquired using a confocal spinning disc
microscope (Roper) equipped with the
following oil-immersion objective lenses
(Nikon): 20x 0.75NA Water, 40x 1.2NA
Water and 100x 1.4NA Oil. The imaging plan
was placed 3-6 μm from the apical surface to
image the Calcium signal in the epithelium
and 12-20 μm to record the Calcium signal in
the trachea and neurons. The temperature
during the recordings was maintained at
25°C. The time between frames ranged from
200 ms to 10 s, and the total acquisition time
from 1 min to 36 h. The fluorescence of the
GCaMP3 gene sensor was excited by a 491
nm laser.
Image Processing: Temporal Color Coded
Projection. Time lapse movies were
processed using Fiji as follows: first the
Gaussian filter was applied to the whole
