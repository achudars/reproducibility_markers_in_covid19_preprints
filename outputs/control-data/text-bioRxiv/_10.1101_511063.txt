Abstract: Dense plant cultivation is an efficient approach to improve the maize production by maximizing the utilization

18

of energy and nutrient. However, dense plant populations may aggravate the abortion rate of young grains and result in

19

fewer number of kernels per ear. Grain filling rate and duration play a decisive role in maize grain yield. Therefore,

20

increasing plant density, consideration of enhancing the grain filling rate and duration of individual maize plant and

21

regulating crop senescence would be the first priority. In this study, we examined the regulatory effects of GA4+7 under

22

two application methods (shank-smearing and silk-smearing). Shank-soaking with GA4+7 at the rate of 0 (CK1), 10 (T1),

23

60 (T2), and 120 (T3) mg L−1, while silk-smearing at the rate of 0 (CK2), 10 (S1), 60 (S2), and 120 (S3) mg L-1 were used.

24

The results showed that GA4+7 improved the grain filling rate by increasing the content of auxin, gibberellin and zeatin

25

and abscisic acid in grains compared to control plants. In addition, The auxin, gibberellin and zeatin contents in the grains

26

were positively and significantly correlated with the maximum grain weight and the maximum and mean grain-filling rates;

27

the abscisic acid level was positively correlated with the maximum grain weight and the maximum and mean grain-filling

28

rates. Moreover, GA4+7 increased the activities of superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases , and reduced the

29

malondialdehyde content in leaves compared with untreated plants. At the rate of 60 mg L-1, GA4+7 showed the greatest

30

effect for shank-smearing and silk-smearing (T2 and S2), followed by 10 mg L-1 (T1) for shank-smearing and 120 mg L-1

31

(S3) for silk-smearing. Our results suggest that application of 60 mg L-1 GA4+7 for smearing application could efficiently

32

be used for changed the level of hormones in grains and antioxidant enzymes in ear leaf, would be useful for enhancing

33

grain filling rate and delaying leaves senescence, and resulting in an increasing of maize grain yield.

1．Introduction

37

Maize is one of the most important cereal crops and is widely used as food, fodder, and as industrial raw material

38

worldwide [1]. Recently, the global production of maize has been exceeded that of rice and wheat [2]. Also, the global

39

population is projected to further increase by 34% in 2050 (a total of 9.15 billion), thus an estimated 70% increase in

40

agricultural production is demanded [3]. Achieving the food demands for such a huge population is a challenge of food

41

security [4]. While, dense plant cultivation has the potential to attain higher crop productivity [5-8], which leads to greater

42

leaf area index (LAI) and increases interception of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and enables the crops to

43

use the intercepted solar radiation more efficiently [9-12]. However, dense plant cultivation should greatly affect the grain-

44

filling process and result in lower maximum and average maize grain-filling rate [13-14]. Although, dense plant populations

45

increase the number of spikes per unit area, but result in a decline of per-plant growth rates and exacerbate young kernel

46

abortion, and so the ears per plant and kernels per ear were decreased [15-18]. Therefore, while adopting high planting

47

density of maize, improving the individual maize grain filling rate is of great concern in modern crop systems.

48

Grain filling is the ultimate growth stage of cereals caryopses formation, which determines final weight of grains and

49

thereby contribute greatly to grain productivity [19,20] The plant hormones have been stated to play a significant role in

50

modifying grain filling progress and other various factors that regulated the grain filling progress. Yang, et al. [21] have

51

reported that the wheat grain-filling rate is mediated by the balance between abscisic acid and ethylene, and the grain-

52

filling rate increases with an increase in the ratio of ABA to ethylene in grains. The zeatin (Z) and zeatin riboside (ZR) in

53

developing seeds have shown to temporarily improve endosperm cell division and fertilization during kernel setting [22].

54

The contents of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were higher in superior grains than in inferior [23],

55

and the increased ABA and reduced IAA shortened grain-filling period in the inferior grains [24]. Liu, et al. [25] and Ali,

56

et al. [26] have reported a positive and significant correlation of ABA, IAA, and Z + ZR contents with the maximum grain

57

weight and grain-filling rates. In addition, a negative and significant correlation of ETH concentration with grain weight

58

and grain-filling rates was reported by Liu, et al. [25]. Additionally, the higher gibberellins (GAs) contents were present at

59

early stages of grain filling [27]. These studies showed that cereals grain filling is markedly affected by alterations in

60

hormones level in grains.

61

In recent decades, plant growth regulators (PGRs) including gibberellins (GAs) are gaining interest among agriculture

62

scientists are broadly used in agronomic crops. GAs comprise a large family of hormones that are ubiquitous in higher

63

plants and have long been known as endogenous plant growth regulators, promoting several aspects of plant growth and

64

developmental processes, such as cell division, stem elongation, seed germination, dormancy, leaf expansion, flower and

fruit development [28,29]. They were first discovered in 1930s by Teijiro Yabuta and Yusuke Sumiki and named after the

66

pathogenic fungus called Gibberella fujikuroi culture [30]. Since then 136 different types of gibberellins structures have

67

been identified and isolated from different fungi and plants sources [31,32]. Despite a large number of GAs, relatively a

68

few gibberellins such as GA1, GA3, GA4, GA7 are believed to have intrinsic biological activity in higher plants [29]

69

(chemical structure of GAs with high bioactivity shown in Scheme 1). GA3 is one of the most widely used plant growth

70

hormones. With the deepening of research, other hormones of GAs, especially GA4 and GA7 attract more and more

71

attention due to their special effects on plants. Some researchers suggested that GA4+7 could successfully induce the fruit

72

set and increased fruit size in cucumber [33], pear [34], apple [35]. In addition, compared to pollinated fruit, GA4+7-treated

73

fruits accumulated more quantities of sucrose and fewer organic acids [34]. Therefore, the application of GA4+7 proved to

74

be an utmost agricultural remedy in horticultural crops, which would otherwise dramatically increase yield and income.

75

However, the application of GA4+7 in cereal crops is limited and the effect of exogenous GA4+7 on the regulation of maize

76

grain filling and its mechanism remains unclear.

77

Scheme 1 The chemical structure of GAs with high bioactivity

78

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continually being produced in plants, which can act as a signal molecule in plants

79

and trigger a series of cellular responses [36,37]. In plants, an increase in the ROS levels exceeding the detoxification levels

80

of plant tissues could be toxic. However, plants have evolved an enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants defense

81

mechanism to effectively scavenge the ROS and maintain a proper balance within the plants. Enzymatic antioxidants

82

mainly include superoxide dismutase (SOD) peroxidase (POD) ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT). However,

83

senescence and various environmental stresses could disrupt the balance between ROS generation and detoxification,

84

resulting in lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll degradation and loss of cell membrane integrity [38]. The research of exogenous

85

GA4+7 stress on antioxidants in maize is limited and unclear.

86

These previous literature have indicate that the potential of GA4+7 to control grain filling of maize is limited, and the

87

possible eﬀects on hormone change and antioxidants have not been investigated in details. Therefore, the objectives of the

88

present study were to instigate the effects of shank-smearing and silk-smearing with different concentrations of GA4+7 on

89

grain filling rate, hormonal changes and its relation with grain filling and possible changes in antioxidants. We provided

90

the first detailed description of the GA4+7 application in improving grain filling rate of maize and antioxidants, with the aim

91

of achieving higher grain yield in high-density maize.

2.3. Experimental design and treatments

112

The regulatory eﬀect of GA4+7 under two application methods (shank-smearing and silk-smearing) were studied in

113

2015-2016. Shank-smearing with GA4+7 at the rate of 0 (CK1), 10 (T1), 60 (T2), and 120 (T3) mg L-1, while silk-smearing

114

also at the rate of 0 (CK2), 10 (S1), 60 (S2), and 120 (S3) mg L-1 were used. Smearing applications were conducted at one

115

week after silking stage (R1). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) using three

116

replications. Maize seeds were manually sown at a density of 97,500 plants ha-1 on 13 and 25 June 2015 and 2016, and

117

harvested on 14 and 21 October 2015 and 2016, respectively. The plot size was 45 m2 (5m x 9m) with the plant-plant and

118

row- row distance of 17 and 60 cm, respectively. All plots were supplied with 225 kg N ha−1, and 120 kg P2O5 ha−1. All P

119

fertilizers and 60% of the N fertilizer were applied at pre-sowing. The remaining 40% of urea (N 46%) was applied as a

120

top dressing at the twelfth leaf stage (V12). During the entire growth period, disease, pest and weed control in each

121

treatment were well controlled. Irrigation was applied when it was necessary.

122

2.4. Sampling and measurements

123

At tasseling stage (VT), healthy and uniform maize plants were marked in each plot. Three marked ear leaves from

124

each plot were sampled at 10 days intervals from the 15 days after silking (DAS) to maturity. Ear leaves were stored in

125

liquid nitrogen for the determination of reactive oxygen species. While three marked ears from each plot were sampled at

126

7 days intervals from the 14 DAS to maturity. The averages grain weight was taken for the three representative ear samples

127

from each time point. First, 100 grain was sampled from the middle part of the maize ear. Half of the sampled grains were

128

used for the hormones measurements, and remaining grains were oven dried at 70 oC until to a constant weight.

129

2.4.1. Grain-filling process

130

The grain-filling data were fitted using the Richards growth equation [39]:

131
132

𝑊=

Where W is the grain weight (mg), A is the final grain weight (mg), t is the time after anthesis (d), and B, k and N are

135

coefficients determined by regression analysis.

136

2.4.2. Endogenous hormone

137

The extraction, purification, and quantification of IAA, ZR, GA3, ABA by an indirect ELISA technique were

138

essentially identical to those described by Liu, et al. [25] and Yang, et al. [27]. The antigens and monoclonal antibodies

139

against IAA, ZR, GA3, ABA and immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP) used in the ELISA were produced

140

at the Phytohormones Research Institute, China Agricultural University, China.

141

For the extraction and purification of IAA, ZR, GA3 and ABA, a sample of approximately 0.5 g was ground in ice

142

bath with 4 mL 80% (v/v) methanol extraction buffer containing 1 mmol L−1 butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as an

143

antioxidant. The homogenates were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h and centrifuged at the same temperature. Afterwards the

144

supernatants were taken into a new centrifuge tube, precipitated with 1 mL methanol extraction buffer, incubated for 1 h

145

and centrifuged again. The supernatants were passed through Chromosep C18 columns (C18 Sep-Park Cartridge, Waters

146

Corp, USA) and prewashed with 5 mL 100% ether and then 5 mL 100% methanol. The hormone fractions were dried with

147

N2 and dissolved in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and 0.1% (w/v) gelatin (pH

148

7.5) for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) evaluation.

149

The quantification of IAA, ZR, GA3 and ABA was done using 50 µL sample (standard sample or the test sample) and

150

50 µL of the diluted antibody were added into each well of the elisa plate, and the plate was placed in the wet box at 37 °C

151

for 0.5 h. The plate was then washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1%(v/v) Tween-20, and

152

Then add 100 µL of the diluted IgG-HRP was added to each well, and the plate was put in the wet box at 37 °C for 0.5 h.

153

Afterwards, the plate was washed 4 times again, and then it's the color reaction. To each well will be added 100 µL

154

coloration liquid containing 0.1% (W/V) o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and 0.04% (V/V) H2O2 in substrate buffer (the

155

substrate buffer contains 5.10g C6H8O7·H2O, 18.43g Na2HPO4·12H2O and 1 mL Tween-20 per litre with pH 5). The

156

chromogenic reaction was also carried out in the wet box, and the reaction was terminated by adding 50 µL 2 mol L-1

157

H2SO4. The absorbance of the solution was read at 490 nm by a spectrophotometer.

158
159

The logit curve was used to calculate the ELISA results. Hormone concentration was expressed as ng g–1 fresh weight.
2.4.3. Antioxidant enzyme

160

For enzyme extraction, 0.5 g of fresh leaf samples were ground with 5mL pre-cooled 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH

161

7.5). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 30 min at 4 oC, and the resulting supernatants were used for

162

enzyme assay. All enzyme activity data were expressed as U mg-1 fresh weight (FW).

163

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined by recording the decrease in the absorbance of nitro-blue

164

tetrazolium (NBT) by the enzyme [40]. The reaction mixture consisting of 1.5 mL 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 0.3

165

mL 130 mmol L-1 methionine, 0.3 mL 750 mol L-1 NBT, 0.3 mL 100 mol L-1 EDTA-Na2, 0.3 mL 20 mol L-1 FD and 0.3

166

mL distilled water was mixed with 20 μL crude enzyme extract. Control and enzyme solution was placed at 4000 lux light

167

for 30 min. The blank sample was placed in the dark. The absorbance of the solution was monitored at 560 nm by an

168

ultraviolet spectrophotometer.

169

Peroxidase (POD) activity was assayed according to Ekmekci and Terzioglu [41]. 20 μL enzyme extract was drawn

170

and mixed with 3mL of POD reaction solution. The reaction mixture contained 1.5 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer

171

(pH 6.0), 0.5 mL H2O2 (30%), 0.5 mL 50 mMguaiacol, and 0.5 mL distilled water. The absorbance values were recorded

172

once every 30 s at 470 nm by using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer.

173

Catalase (CAT) activity was assayed by measuring the decomposition of H2O2 [42]. The reaction mixture contained

174

1.5 mL 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.2 mL crude extract, 1 mL distilled water and 0.3 mL 100 mM H2O2.

175

The breakdown of H2O2 was followed by measuring the absorbance change at 240 nm.

176

The lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) by following the

177

procedure of Zhang [43]. 0.5 g leaf samples were homogenized in 5 mL of 5 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the

178

homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min at 25 oC. 2 mL enzyme solution was drawn and mixed with 3 mL of 2-

179

thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in 20 % trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was water-bath heated at 100°C for 20 min and

180

centrifuged for cooling down. The absorbance of the supernatant was determined respectively at 450 nm, 532 nm, and 600

181

nm.

182

2.4.4. Yield and yield components

183

To determine ear characteristics and grain yield, thirty representative plants from each replicate were sampled at

184

physiological maturity. Kernel number ear-1 and thousand kernels weight (TKW) were measured on 20 representative ears

185

per plot. TKW was determined after drying a thousand grains at 75 °C to constant weight. Grain yield was determined at

186

13.0% moisture content.

187

2.5. Statistical analysis

188

Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were determined by using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The

189

data from each sampling were analyzed separately. Least significance difference test (LSD) was applied to determine the

190

significance between different treatments (p < 0.05).

3.1. Effects of GA4+7 on yield and yield component

Results

193

The results of field experiments in 2015–2016 showed that GA4+7 treatments significantly (P<0.05) enhanced the ear

194

characteristics (ear length and diameter, kernels ear-1, and 1000 kernel weight) and grain yield of maize when compared

195

with control treatments (Table 2). Compared with control treatment, T2 and S2 treatments had the best effects on the maize

196

yield, followed by T1 and S3. The shank smearing treatments affected the grain yield mainly by increasing the thousand

197

grain weight of maize, two years average thousand grain weight under T1 and T2 treatments were increased by 24.5g,

198

36.99 g, respectively, i.e. 8.5%, 12.8%. While the silk smearing treatments mainly increased kernel number to improve

199

grain yield, two-year average kernel number under S2 and S3 treatments were increased by 77, 44 kernels per ear,

200

respectively, i.e. 26.9% and 15.5%. In 2015, the highest concentration of GA4+7 in shank smearing treatment and the lowest

201

concentration of GA4+7 in silk smearing treatment, i.e., T3 and S1 had a relatively small impact on increasing yield

202

compared with control treatment (CK). However, the grain yield of T3 and S1 were still improved by a relatively large

203

amount in 2016. The two year average grain yields under T1, T2, and T3 treatments were increased by 1050.4kg ha-1,

204

2132.6 kg ha-1, 348.8 kg ha-1, 12.1%, 24.6%, and 4.0% increases compared with CK1, whereas that of S1, S2, and S3

3.3.1. IAA and ZR contents in grains

237

The IAA and ZR contents in maize grains exhibited a similar pattern during the grain filling process. The IAA and

238

ZR contents increased linearly during the initial grain-filling stage and attained the maximum peak curves at 28 DAS for

239

all treatments (Fig. 3 and 4). The IAA and ZR contents under shank-smearing treatments were greater than that under CK1

240

from 14 to 28 DAS. Compared with CK1, the average IAA contents from 14 to 28 DAS under T1, T2 and T3 were increased

241

by 50.2%, 82.7%, and 50.7%, while the average ZR contents from 14 to 28 DAS increased by 23.6%, 41.0%, and 14.6%

242

under T1, T2 and T3 treatment. The IAA contents in grains under S2 and S3 treatments were greater than that under CK2

243

from 14 to 49 DAS. Compared with CK2, the mean IAA contents at all sampling stages of S2 and S3 were raised by 32.4%

244

and 20.3%. At 49 DAS, S1 treatments have no significant effects on ZR contents in maize grains; however, the ZR contents

245

in the grains under other shank-smearing and silk-smearing treatments in every sampling period were significantly higher

246

than that under CK1 and CK2. And the mean ZR contents under T1, T2, and T3 treatments were increased by 25.5%,

247

45.2%, 24.0% compared with CK1, while that of S1, S2 and S3 increased by 20.7%, 37.0%, and 22.0% compared with

257

3.3.2. GA3 contents in grains

258

The GA3 contents in the grains exhibited a gradually decreasing trend during grain filling, except for S3 treatment

259

(Fig. 5). S3 treatment decreased the level of GA3 in grains from 14 to 21 DAS and rose abruptly to a peak of 28 DAS, and

260

then decreased steadily after the respective peak. The trend is different from other treatments, and it is necessary to deepen

261

the research to explore the mechanism of its raise. Compared with control treatments, T2 and S2 treatments significantly

262

increased the GA3 contents in grains and followed by T1 and S3. The average GA3 contents under T1, T2, and T3 treatments

263

during the whole grain filling stage were increased by 9.1%, 26.4%, 5.1% compared with CK1, while that of S1, S2, and

264

S3 treatments were greater by 11.6%, 25.9%, and 22.3% compared with CK2.

269

3.3.3. ABA contents in grains

270

The ABA content increased rapidly at the early grain-filling stage, reached to a maximum at 28 DAS, and then

271

declined progressively in later stages. At the same sampling period, ABA content was decreased with the increase of GA4+7

272

concentration under shank-smearing treatments, while that under silking-smearing treatments was gradually increased with

273

the increasing of GA4+7 concentration (Fig. 6). T1 and S3 treatments have the significant effects on ABA contents in grains

274

at all sampling period, followed by S2 and T2. The average ABA contents during the whole grain filling stages under T1

275

and T2 treatments were increased by 14.0 ng g FW-1, 7.4 ng g FW-1, 12.8%, and 7.4% increases compared with CK1,

276

whereas that of S2 and S3 increased by 7.9 ng g FW-1, 14.9 ng g FW-1, respectively, i.e., 13.6% and 7.9% increases

277

compared with CK2. However, T3 and S1 had no significant effect relatively on increasing ABA contents compared with

278

control treatment (CK).

The SOD activity showed a downward trend from 15 to 45 DAS under all treatments (Fig. 7). The SOD activity was

286

significantly improved in GA4+7-treated plants at a varied level, Compared to control. 10 mg L-1 (T1 and S1) and 60 mg L-1

287

(T2 and S2) GA4+7 treatments had the significant effects for improving SOD activity than highest concentration of 120 mg

288

L-1 GA4+7 (T3 and S3 treatments) and control. The SOD activity in T3 treatment was significantly greater than CK1 at 25

289

DAS, and no significant difference was associated with control at other stages. S3 treatment significantly increased the

290

SOD activity compared with CK2 at 15 and 25 DAS; however, from 35 to 45 DAS, there was no significant difference

291

between S3 and CK2. The SOD activity revealed an increase of 12.7%, 17.2% and 5.9% (mean of all sampling stages) in

292

shank-smearing-treated plants, compared to CK1, while that of silk-smearing-treated plants was 12.3%, 16.6%, and 9.3%

293

higher than CK2.

298

3.4.2. POD activity

299

The POD activity in ear leaf displayed a gradually decreasing pattern of change from 15 to 45 DAS. And at the same

300

stage, with the increase of GA4+7 concentrations, POD activity decreased gradually (Fig. 8). T1 treatment had the best

301

effect on increasing the POD activity, followed by T2. There was no significant difference between T1 and T2. The POD

302

activity revealed a significant increase of 9.0%, 45.6%, 10.8% and 15.8% in T1-treated plants, compared to CK1 at 15, 25,

303

35 and 45 DAS, while that of T2 was 6.1%, 37.4%, 14.2%, and 15% higher than CK1. Whereas at the early grain filling

304

stage (from 15 to 25 DAS), the POD activity of T3 is higher than that of CK1, then the POD activity of T3 decreased

305

rapidly, and at 45 DAS, the POD activity of T3 was significantly lower than that in CK1. The treatments of silk-smearing

306

with GA4+7 significantly increased the POD activity at all sampling stages compared with CK2, except for T3 treatment at

307

15 DAS. At 15 and 25 DAS, S1 had the best effects on increasing the POD activity, followed by S2. And from 35 to 45

308

DAS, the POD activities of T1, T2, and T3 were not significantly different from each other. S1, S2, and S3 increased the

309

average POD activities of the whole grain filling stages by 17.8%, 18.0% and 15.3%.

314

3.4.3. CAT activity

315

Application of GA4+7 had obvious effects on the activity of CAT and showed a gradually decreasing trend from 15 to

316

45 DAS (Fig. 9). With GA4+7 shank-smearing applications, T1 treatment showed the best effect of CAT activity at all

317

sampling stages, followed by T2. And at 25 DAS, the CAT activity of T2 was significantly less than that of T1, but there

318

was no significant difference in CAT activity between T1 and T2 in other sampling periods. The CAT activity in T3 was

319

significantly higher than that of CK1 and significantly less than that of T2. All concentrations of GA4+7 silk-smearing

320

treatments significantly increased CAT activity compared with CK2. The CAT activity of S2 was significantly higher than

321

S1, S3, and CK2. The average of CAT activity of all sampling stages in T1, T2, and T3 treatments was increased by 58.4%,

322

46.1%, and 17.7% compared with CK1. Similarly, S1, S2, and S3 treatments improved the average CAT activity by 20.2%,

significant effects on decreasing the MDA from 15 to 45 DAS and were not significantly different from each other. While

332

the T1 and T2 treatments significantly reduced the MDA contents at all sampling times and were not significantly different

4.1 Effects of GA4+7 smearing application on grain yield

Discussion

344

The present study illustrates the positive effects of GA4+7 on grain yield of high-density maize by regulating the

345

endogenous hormones level in grains and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in leaves to promote the grain filling rate

346

and regulate the leaves senescence. Previously, GA4+7 have been shown to be an effective growth regulator for several

347

crops that could increase the yield and improve the income for farmers [33-35]. In our study, GA4+7 at a rate of 10 (T1) and

348

60 (T2) mg L-1 of under shank-smearing application significantly increased the grain yield of maize in 2015 and 2016.

349

With the silk-smearing application, all concentrations of GA4+7 significantly improved the maize yield in both 2015 and

350

2016. The application of GA4+7 improved the agronomic characteristics of ears, increased the kernel number per ear and

351

thousand kernels weight. The yield potential of maize can be divided into three key components: kernel number per ear,

352

grain weight, and a number of ear per plant. However, the average thousand grain weight under shank-smearing treatments

353

in 2015 and 2016 were higher than that in silk-smearing treatments, and the average kernel number of silk-smearing

354

treatments in 2015 and 2016 were higher than that in shank-smearing treatments. These results indicated that GA4+7 with

355

shank-smearing application improved the yield mainly by increased the grain weight, while silk-smearing with GA4+7

356

increased the kernel number per ear to promote the maize yield.

357

4.2 Relationship of hormone changes and maize grain filling

358

Cytokinins (CTKs) plays a significant role in the regulation of grain filling process, and high CTK levels in maize

359

spike tissues are markedly associated with kernel development [44-45]. CTKs are generally found in the endosperm of

360

developing seeds and may be required for cell division during the early phase of seed setting in other cereal crops [44, 46-

361

49]. Besides CTKs, IAA also plays a significant role in regulating grain filling [50]. Xu, et al. [24] and Fu, et al. [51]

362

suggested that regulation of the IAA content in grains could potentially increase the weight of inferior grains. In present

363

study, ZR and IAA contents in the maize grains showed a significantly positive correlation with the maximum grain weight,

364

the maximum and mean grain-filling rates (Table 4). The results indicated that ZR and IAA contents in grains were involved

365

in regulating maize grain filling. In addition, the changes of ZR and IAA contents in grains during grain filling stages

366

showed a similar pattern. The ZR and IAA contents in the grains transiently increased in the early grain-filling stage and

367

then decreased, reaching a maximum at 28 DAS. We also observed that the IAA and ZR contents between GA4+7-treated

368

plants and untreated maize had significant difference at early filling stage. However, with the development of grain filling

369

process, the difference of IAA and ZR contents between GA4+7-treated maize and control gradually narrowed (Fig. 3 and

370

4). The researchers suggested that auxin and CTKs control endosperm cell growth and division [24, 52]. Seth [53] and

371

Singh [54] stated that high IAA levels in a sink organ can create an “attractive power”, leading to increased cytokinins

372

levels in grains. These previous findings as well as the findings in this research indicate that IAA and ZR contents may

373

control early grain filling in maize.

380

Furthermore, ABA and GAs also play important roles in regulated grain filling. Yang, et al. [27] suggested that a

381

higher ABA concentration in grains enhanced the remobilization of prestored carbon to the grains and accelerated the grain

382

filling rate. And the previous studies showed that ABA content in grains was significantly and positively correlated with

383

the maximum and mean grain filling rates and maximum grain weight [25-26, 55]. In our present study, the ABA content

384

in grains were increased by exogenous GA4+7, and there was positively correlated between ABA and grain filling rate

385

(Table.4). However, the correlation between GAs and grain filling rate and grain weight were not in consistent. Liu, et al.

386

[25] and Liu, et al. [55] suggested that the content of GAs in the grains was not significantly correlated with the maximum

387

grain weight or the maximum and mean grain-filling rates. In contrast, Our findings are consistent with Ali, et al. [26], that

388

GAs was significant correlated with the maximum grain weight and the maximum and mean grain-filling rates. Yang, et

389

al. [56] stated that spraying exogenous GA reduced the ratio of ABA to GA in the grains. These results indicated that the

390

application of exogenous GA4+7 changes the content of ABA and GA in the grains, and a hormonal balance, rather than

391

individual hormone content, regulates and improves the maize grain filling.

392

4.3 Effects of GA4+7 smearing application on the antioxidant enzymes

393

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continually being produced in plants, which can act as a signal molecule in plants

394

and trigger a series of cellular responses [36]. In plants, an increase in the ROS levels exceeding the detoxification levels

395

of plant tissues could be toxic. However, plants have evolved an enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants defense

396

mechanism to effectively scavenge the ROS and maintain a proper balance within the plants [57]. Enzymatic antioxidants

397

mainly include superoxide dismutase (SOD) peroxidase (POD) ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT). However,

398

senescence and various environmental stresses could disrupt the balance between ROS generation and detoxification,

399

resulting in lipid peroxidation, chlorophyll degradation and loss of cell membrane integrity [58]. Indeed, our result showed

400

a remarkable increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, POD, and CAT, and decreased MDA

401

accumulation in the GA4+7-treated maize plants at various growth stages. These trends could be interpreted as enhanced

402

scavenging capacity of reactive oxygen species and reduced membrane lipid oxidation of treated plants. It is well-known

403

that chloroplasts are a potential source for generation of active oxygen [59]. Therefore, GA4+7-treated plants kept more

photosynthetic pigments content and subsequent in the delayed aging.

405

With the knowledge of that developing seeds contain large amounts of hormones, which possess the ability of inducing

406

directional movement of nutrients within plants. The leaves senesce appears when a “sink” (young developing leaves or

407

seeds) needs the nutrients which were moved from the rest of the plant. Seth and Wareing [60] suggested that hormone-

408

directed transport plays an important role in directing the movement of nutrients towards developing seeds. These indicated

409

that the application of exogenous GA4+7 changed the level of hormones in seeds, thus affecting the antioxidant enzymes in

410

leaves and the senescence of maize. However, there are little research about exogenous GA4+7 on reactive oxygen

411

metabolism in maize, and the specific mechanism needs further study.

412

Conclusions

413

Application of GA4+7 under high density leads to an increase in the level of IAA, ZR, GA3, and ABA. This increase

414

is attributed to improving the grain filling rate, grain weight and the number of kernels ear-1 were also increased, as well as

415

increased the yield. In addition, GA4+7 applications improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes in leaves senescence.

416

The grain filling period could be prolonged by delaying the senescence of maize so that the grain filling was sufficient and

417

eventually increased the yield. Our results showed the positive effect of GA4+7 on maize grain filling rate and antioxidant

418

enzymes, and could effectively be used for crop improvement, especially for cereal crops. At the rate of 60 mg L-1, GA4+7

419

showed the greatest effect for shank-smearing and silk-smearing (T2 and S2), followed by 10 mg L-1 (T1) for shank-

420

smearing and 120 mg L-1 (S3) for silk-smearing. The results from the present study illustrate that GA4+7 application could

421

efficiently be used for altering the level of hormones in grains and antioxidant enzymes in ear leaf, would be useful for

422

enhancing grain filling rate and delaying leaves senescence and increasing grain yield of maize.
