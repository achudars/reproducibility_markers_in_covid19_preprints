Abstract
Myelopoiesis is invariably present, and contributes to pathology, in animal models of
graft versus host disease (GVHD). In humans, a rich inflammatory infiltrate bearing
macrophage markers has also been described in histological studies. In order to
determine the origin, functional properties and role in pathogenesis of these cells, we
isolated single cell suspensions from acute cutaneous GVHD and subjected them to
genotype, transcriptome and in vitro functional analysis. A donor-derived population
of CD11c+CD14+ cells was the dominant population of all leukocytes in GVHD.
Surface phenotype and nanostring gene expression profiling indicated the closest
steady-state counterpart of these cells to be monocyte-derived macrophages. In
GVHD, however, there was upregulation of monocyte antigens SIRPα and
S100A8/9, and transcripts associated with leukocyte trafficking, pattern recognition,
antigen presentation, and co-stimulation. Isolated GVHD macrophages stimulated
greater proliferation and activation of allogeneic T cells, and secreted higher levels of
inflammatory cytokines than their steady-state counterparts. In HLA-matched mixed
leukocyte reactions, we also observed differentiation of activated macrophages with
a similar phenotype. These exhibited cytopathicity to a cell line and mediated
pathological damage to skin explants, independently of T cells. Together, these
results define the origin, functional properties and potential pathogenic roles of
human GVHD macrophages.

Introduction
Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) affects up to 50% of patients receiving
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and remains a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality (1, 2). GVHD most commonly affects the skin, gut, liver and
may also contribute to idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (3). In animal models, donor
T lymphocytes play an essential role in immune-mediated damage to host epithelium
(4). In human GVHD, mononuclear infiltrates have been observed that include
CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tregs although no pathognomic effector
subset has been observed in all patient cohorts (5–8). Despite the obvious
importance of effector T cells, they may not be sufficient to mediate GVHD pathology
(4). In almost all GVHD models, pathology occurs in the presence of neutrophils,
monocytes and other myeloid components that may infiltrate tissues and amplify
local immune responses (9).

Animal models previously demonstrated that immunocompetent donor myeloid cells
enhance GVHD, without specifying a particular cell type (10, 11). Macrophages
have been implicated through observations that GVHD may be modulated by
manipulation of the CSF-1 axis, although opposing effects have been reported,
depending on the timing of interventions (12–15). Glucocorticoids also appear to
reduce GVHD at least partly through attenuation of macrophage responses (16) and
in humanized mice, donor monocytes or DC are absolutely required for xeno-GVHD
(17). Knock-out of the ATP receptor P2Y2 on recipient monocytes reduces GVHD
lethality (18). Most recently, a specific role of T cell-derived GM-CSF was described
in promoting the differentiation of effector macrophages (19).

In humans, a number of reports highlight an increase in myeloid cells bearing
macrophage markers, showing that the level of infiltration correlates with clinical
severity and outcome (7, 20, 21). However, as shown by high resolution analysis,
the myeloid cell compartment of human skin is highly complex with discrete
populations of classical dendritic cells (DC), monocyte-derived cells and resident
macrophages, (22–26). These observations suggest that the nature of myeloid
infiltrates cannot be adequately resolved using in situ microscopy; hence their origin
and immune functions in GVHD remain undefined.

The role of (recipient) myeloid cells in responding to danger signals is integral to
most models of GVHD, but is not known whether human GVHD infiltrates bearing
macrophage markers are recipient, donor, immunogenic or anti-inflammatory.
Although donor myelopoiesis usually dominates the peripheral blood compartment
during GVHD, recipient dermal macrophages have very slow kinetics of turnover in
humans (22) and potentially expand during inflammation (27). Macrophages are
capable of mediating a wide spectrum of tolerogenic or pathogenic responses (28).
By extrapolation from mouse models, macrophages are likely to promote GVHD.
However, their ability to stimulate local effector T cells and mediate direct epithelial
damage remain untested in humans.

Here we employ direct methods of isolation and testing to show that acute GVHD
lesions in human skin are dominated by CD11c+CD14+ myeloid cells with the
genotype, phenotype and transcriptional profile of donor monocyte-derived
macrophages. These cells have potent immunological functions that are likely to
contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD and may offer opportunities for therapeutic
intervention.

Results
In order to investigate the properties of myeloid cells in human cutaneous acute
GVHD, mononuclear cells of the human dermis were defined by
immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry in
healthy controls, BMT recipients without acute GVHD, and BMT recipients with
GVHD (Table S1, S2). BMT control patients without GVHD were biopsied on
median day 83 post-transplantation (range 28-148 days). GVHD skin biopsies were
taken at the onset of an acute onset erythematous rash, prior to initiation of therapy.
Classical acute GVHD, immunosuppression withdrawal acute GVHD, and acute
GVHD following donor lymphocyte infusion were all included. A pathological
diagnosis of acute-type GVHD was confirmed by standard histological criteria in all
cases and patients with clinical or histological features of chronic GVHD were
excluded. The median day of biopsy was day 53 (range 13-304; Mann-Whitney p =
0.27 compared with BMT controls). In situ analysis showed an increase in CD3+ T
cells and CD11c+ myeloid cells in a perivascular and epidermal interface distribution
in GVHD (Figure 1a). The nature of the leukocytic infiltrate was also documented
using 4-colour immunofluorescence of whole-mount specimens. There was marked
infiltration of perivascular spaces by CD11c+ cells that usually remained distinct from
FXIIIA-expressing resident macrophages (22) (Figure 1b). Further comparison of
CD11c, FXIIIA and CD163 antigen expression by this approach is shown in Figure
S1a-c.

The infiltrates of acute GVHD infiltrate were characterized by flow cytometry of single
cell suspensions. Gating on live singlets expressing CD45 and HLA-DR revealed
SSC low lymphocytes and HLA-DR+ SSC high myeloid cells as previously described
(22, 25). Surprisingly, the proportion of cells falling in the lymphoid gate was not

significantly increased in GVHD relative to BMT controls or healthy donors (Figure
S1e) although a relative expansion of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T cells was observed in
relative to both controls (Figure S1d-f). Myeloid cells were further divided on the
bivariate plot of CD14 versus CD11c allowing identification of subsets previously
described in healthy control skin, without relying upon autofluorescence to capture
resident macrophages (22–24, 26). The linkage between this new gating strategy
and previously identified myeloid cell populations is explained in Figure S2a-d.

In contrast to the modest changes in overall cellularity and T cell populations,
CD11c+CD14+ myeloid cells were expanded more than 10-fold compared with
healthy control skin or BMT skin without GVHD (Figure 1c, d, red gates; Figure
S1a-c). This GVHD-related subset lacked CD1c expression and mapped to
parameter space containing monocyte-macrophages in the steady-state (25). Cells
in the CD14+ CD11c- gate contained FXIIIA+ CD163+ macrophages with high
melanin content and auto-fluorescence, representing ‘fixed’ or resident macrophages
(22, 29, 30). These were relatively depleted in GVHD as were classical DC2 (cDC2;
CD11c+ CD1c+ CD14-) and cDC1 (CD141+ cells in the CD14-CD11c- gate; Figure
1c, d). A ratio of >0.55 between CD11c+ CD14+ GVHD cells and CD1c+ cDC2 was
84% sensitive and 81% specific for the histological diagnosis of GVHD in skin
biopsies post BMT (Figure 1f). Sequential biopsies showed resolution of the GVHD
infiltrate in parallel with clinical improvement (Figure S2e, f).

We sought to characterize the excess of CD11c+CD14+ cells observed in GVHD
further, showing by morphology that they were small macrophages with eccentric
dense nuclei, cytoplasmic vacuoles and granules, distinct from larger, melanin-rich
macrophages isolated from the CD14+ CD11c- gates (Figure 2a). They retained
similar migratory capacity in vitro to their steady-state counterparts (25) (Figure 2b,
c). CD11c+CD14+ GVHD cells expressed common macrophage antigens (CD163,
CD64 CD206 and CD209) but showed upregulation of monocyte-associated
antigens (CD172a, S100A8/9, CD16 (Figure 2d).

In order to define the ontogeny of CD11c+CD14+ cells relative to known populations
of macrophages and DC, GVHD and steady state populations were sorted, and
expression of 609 immunology-related genes was surveyed by Nanostring. By
principal component analysis (PCA), CD11c+CD14+ GVHD cells segregated with
steady state monocyte-macrophages and resident dermal macrophages, away from
DC populations (Figure 3a). Focusing on a previously defined subset of 29 genes
that distinguish between DC and monocytes/macrophage lineages (25),
CD11c+CD14+ GVHD cells clustered with steady-state monocyte-macrophages and
resident macrophages in unsupervised analysis (Figure 3b). Genotype analysis by
XY FISH in sex-mismatched transplants showed a median of 98-100% donor origin
of CD11+CD14+ GVHD macrophages, equal to the level of blood myeloid chimerism
(Figure 3c, d). Based on these results, we conclude that CD11c+CD14+ myeloid
cells in GVHD are donor monocyte-derived macrophages. Recipient T cells were
present in the dermis in 3 out of 4 patients at the time of GVHD, in keeping with the
recent study of Divito et al., submitted to JCI.

Although myeloid cells have previously been described in human GVHD by
histology, their functional properties have not been directly tested. Steady-state
CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages are not potent allo-stimulators compared
with dermal CD141+ cDC1 and CD1c+ cDC2 (22, 23). In contrast, GVHD
macrophages were capable of stimulating T cell proliferation and expression of
activation antigens to the level associated with steady-state DC populations (Figure
4a, b). Gene expression profiling of 2,000-5,000 sorted cells, revealed upregulation
of allo-stimulatory functions included antigen presentation (HLA, TAP1), recruitment
(CCL24) and stimulation of lymphocytes (CD82), stimulation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines (SPP1), and leukocyte extravasation (SELPLG) (Figure 4c). Differential
expression of several key chemokines and cytokines was also revealed at the
protein level, including IL-6, IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10 and IL-10 (Figure 4d).

The preceding data suggest that GVHD macrophages are derived from blood
monocytes and achieve a higher state of functional activation than their steady state
counterparts. Further evidence of their likely function in GVHD was sought by
deriving allo-stimulated macrophages from monocytes and testing their functional
properties. HLA-matched donor and recipient blood was taken prior to
transplantation and PBMC stored in order to prepare mixed leukocyte reactions. The
cytokine milieu of an HLA-matched MLR was similar to that observed when GVHD
skin was cultured (Figure 5a), and a prominent population of macrophages
appeared, with similar phenotype to GVHD macrophages (Figure 5b). MLRactivated macrophages also expressed cytotoxic molecules perforin, granzyme A,
granulolysin and TRAIL, similarly to GVHD macrophages (Figure 5b-d). Many of
these products were already upregulated in CD14+ monocytes isolated from the
blood of patients with GVHD, compared with healthy control monocytes (Figure 5d).

The expression of cytotoxic molecules prompted us to test the possibility that MLRactivated macrophages might mediate cytotoxicity to epidermal cells. We observed
that MLR-activated macrophages were directly cytotoxic to a keratinocyte cell line in
vitro, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6a, b). In order to test a setting more
relevant to GVHD, we adapted the in vitro skin explant model. When a small explant
of intact skin is exposed to a clone of minor-histocompatibility antigen-specific T
cells, GVHD-like epidermal pathology is observed in an HLA-restricted and antigenspecific manner (31). GVHD pathology is also observed, in proportion to HLAmatching and sex differences, when recipient skin is exposed to donor leukocytes
pre-sensitized to recipient antigens in a mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) (32).
Although it has been assumed that GVHD pathology in vitro is exclusively mediated
by T cells in the MLR, we were surprised to observe nearly equivalent cytopathic
effects when the ‘donor’ MLR was sorted into macrophage and T cell components
(Figure 6c, d).

Discussion
In this study we have defined the role of myeloid cells in human cutaneous acute
GVHD by characterizing mononuclear infiltrates from primary tissue, isolating the
dominant myeloid cell, and defining its origin, transcriptional profile and functional
properties. The data indicate that human GVHD lesions are highly infiltrated with
donor monocyte-derived macrophages with enhanced allo-stimulatory activity and
the potential to mediate epidermal pathology.

Myeloid cells found in GVHD have previously been characterized as macrophages
based on descriptive histopathology with a small number of surface antigens. These
studies lack further details of the biological characteristics or potential pathogenic
role of macrophages in GVHD (7, 20–22). Indeed, evidence that macrophages
enhance local effector immune functions is surprisingly hard to find in any scenario
of inflammation in human tissues. Where they have been isolated from primary
human tissues, their function has been described as regulatory, in comparison with
DC (33, 34). Our findings that GVHD macrophages have functional attributes
capable of promoting GVHD provide an important corroboration of recent mouse
models describing the dependence of GVHD pathology upon donor myeloid cells
activated by T cell-derived GM-CSF (19).

Numerically, macrophages show the greatest fold increase in GVHD of any
mononuclear cell and constitute the most consistent ‘cellular signature’ of acute
GVHD relative to recipients without GVHD or healthy control skin. The
macrophage:DC ratio is sensitive and specific relative to BMT control skin without
GVHD, increasing more than 100-fold in the presence of GVHD. Previous studies of
human GVHD have placed emphasis upon the potential existence of a

pathognomonic subset of T cells in GVHD, although none has been consistently
identified (6–8). Unlike animal models of BMT in which additional splenic T cells are
added to initiate GVHD (4), human BMT recipients are typically severely
lymphopenic owing to the routine use of post-transplant cytotoxic agents, calcineurin
inhibitors, and T cell depletion strategies. Numerically, the T cell infiltrate is
surprisingly modest and insignificantly different to healthy human skin, especially in
classical early acute GVHD. The observations that MHC class I and II mismatches
both increase the risk of GVHD and that CD4 or CD8 selective depletion does not
abrogate GVHD are in keeping with multiple pathways of T cell alloreactivity that
may vary from patient to patient (4). The striking feature is that all appear to result in
the profound recruitment of inflammatory macrophages.

Here, GVHD macrophages were defined as CD11c+CD14+ cells, based on the most
direct means of distinguishing the infiltrate from auto-fluorescent CD11c- resident
macrophages by flow cytometry. Several lines of evidence point to a monocyte
origin; most notably they are donor-derived and therefore unlikely to arise by
proliferation of resident recipient macrophages. Additional staining demonstrated
high expression of monocyte antigens S100A8/A9 and SIRPA (CD172), consistent
with recent emigration of monocytes from the blood (35, 36). Nanostring gene
expression analysis confirmed transcription of a core set of macrophage-related
genes including MAF, MERTK, F13A1, CD163 and CD14. Although GVHD
macrophages have higher expression of monocyte antigens and a number of
important functional differences, they are most closely related to CD11c+CD14+
dermal cells found in steady-state tissues and previously reported to have a
transient, monocyte origin (25). Enhanced monocyte priming and recruitment to
tissues is also suggested by the phenotypic activation of peripheral blood

monocytes, previously been reported in patients with active GVHD (37–39). We
observed a similar phenomenon in the expression of cytotoxic genes by GVHD
monocytes compared with those from healthy controls. In corroboration, we also
observed that monocytes differentiating into macrophages in HLA-matched MLRs
had a similar phenotype and functional properties to GVHD macrophages.

The data indicate that single surface markers previously used to define GVHD
macrophages by histology often have variable expression under more detailed
scrutiny. In keeping with previous reports (7, 20–22), CD163 was detectable by flow
cytometry, but was less consistent than CD11c+ in identifying GVHD infiltrates by
immunohistochemistry. CD163 is expressed by resident macrophages (40) and
chronic inflammatory macrophages found in psoriasis (41), coeliac disease (42) and
Crohn’s disease (43). Higher CD163 expression was associated with longer
intervals post-transplant, consistent with the description of abundant CD163
expression in advanced GVHD lesions (20, 21). These findings are also in keeping
with the original characterization of CD163 (clone RM3/1) as a ‘late phase’
macrophage antigen with more delayed kinetics of expression (44).

GVHD macrophages demonstrated enhanced T cell stimulatory functions, compared
with steady-state CD11c+CD14+ cells, including greater expression of pattern
recognition, leukocyte adhesion and trafficking, antigen presentation and T cell costimulation genes, production of chemokines and capacity to stimulate allogeneic T
cell proliferation. The potential of macrophages to mediate direct cytotoxic effects is
described in classical studies but, until recently, has received little attention in the
field of GVHD. Early studies showed that GVHD induced priming of macrophages
resulting in direct cytotoxicity following LPS challenge (45) and subsequent work

elaborated on the secretory properties of activated macrophages (46). However,
contemporary models of GVHD present the contribution of macrophages to GVHD
almost exclusively in terms of sensing danger and enhancing accessory cell function
(9–11). It was not possible to harvest sufficient GVHD macrophages directly from
biopsies to test their effector function so we generated allo-stimulated macrophages
from monocytes in HLA-matched MLRs, as a surrogate. MLR-stimulated
macrophages were capable mediating direct cytopathicity with a cell line and
surprisingly, caused a similar degree of immunopathology as T cells in the skin
explant model of GVHD. Although the latter lacks all the complexity of GVHD in
vivo, it is the only human system amenable to manipulation. Furthermore, the
degree of pathological damage consistently reflects levels of major and minor
histocompatibility antigen matching and has been used previously to dissect HLArestricted antigen-specific GVHD responses (31, 32). This result revises the
assumption that T cells are the only relevant effectors when the an MLR product is
added to explanted skin.

In classical animal models of GVHD, myelopoiesis is invariable present during the
effector phase of GVHD, even when the sole instigator of GVHD is a T cell clone
directly targeted to epithelium (47, 48). Investigators have now revealed nonredundant functions for myeloid cells in GVHD pathogenesis (12–15, 17, 19). The
conceptual advance that T cells are necessary but may not be sufficient for GVHD
has important therapeutic implications. Unlike T cells in the human adult, which may
take more than 2 years to recover after transplantation, myeloid cells are
continuously generated, and rapid immune reconstitution is possible following
myeloid-targeted interventions. The ability to isolate discrete mechanisms that

govern the infiltration of tissues by myeloid cells, such as GM-CSF dependence, may
also offer a means of minimising GVHD without compromising GVL (19).

Inflammatory macrophages with a similar phenotype to GVHD macrophage have
been characterized in other pathological states such as psoriasis (41) coeliac
disease, (42) and Crohn’s disease (43). In coeliac disease, acute gluten challenge
induces an increase of CD11c+CD14+ cells with modest expression of CD163,
reminiscent of the population found in GVHD (49). These observations suggest that
similar inflammatory myeloid cells are found in other conditions. Owing to the
distinct clinical context of BMT, these are unlikely to become confused with GVHD,
but may present opportunities to target common pathways across a wide range of
conditions.

Intriguingly, in the field of solid organ transplantation, macrophages have been
reported to sense histocompatibility differences. This mechanism has not been
explored in GVHD but could initiate inflammatory responses especially in the context
of lymphopenia. (Zecher et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Oberbarnscheidt et al., 2014;
Fox et al., 2001). Furthermore, as shown in the recently submitted manuscript of
Divito et al., abundant host tissue resident T cells, survive conditioning and may
initiate GVHD by stimulating an initial host versus graft (HVG) reaction by recipient T
cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been observed that DP mismatches in
the HVG direction are associated with higher levels of GVHD than fully DP-matched
transplants (Reid et al, manuscript in preparation). The possibility that a tissuebased HVG reaction can cause pathology in distinguishable from GVHD is also
suggested by the observation that lethal GVHD may be mediated by a ‘bystander’

MLR effect in which recipient epithelium is not directly recognizable by T cells, in
animal models (50).

In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that GVHD lesions contain
abundant donor macrophages, likely to be derived from activated circulating classical
monocytes. GVHD macrophages secrete chemokines, are capable of stimulating T
cells and can mediate direct cytotoxicity. Together, these results shed new light on
human macrophage functions and suggest that they may be a universal therapeutic
target for the prevention and treatment GVHD.

Methods

Human subjects
Sequential patients undergoing allogeneic BMT were recruited from the Northern
Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust over a 3 year period between 2013 and 2016. 5-15mm2 skin
shaves were obtained using 1% lidocaine local anesthesia and a DermabladeTM from
BMT recipient controls with no evidence of GVHD and BMT recipients with GVHD.
Biopsies were transported in serum-free medium (X-VIVO, Lonza) and analysed
within 24 hours. An independent clinical pathologist provided diagnosis and
histological grading of GVHD in controls and GVHD biopsies. Healthy control skin
was obtained from patients undergoing mammoplasty or abdominoplasty as
previously described (22). Specimens comparable to clinical biopsies were obtained
by immobilizing skin strips on a cork block covered with sterile silicon and performing
skin shave biopsies.

Cell lines and mononuclear cells
Unless stated otherwise all cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Lonza) with 100IU/ml
penicillin, 10μ/ml streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Sera Lab). MLR macrophages were generated from co-culture of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-matched BMT donor and
recipient pairs. Recipient PBMCs were irradiated (20Gy) and used as stimulators for
donor PBMCs at a 1:1 ratio. Cultures containing 1-5x107 donor PBMCs were
maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% human AB serum (Sigma) for 7 days.

Skin shave biopsies were used whole or split into dermis and epidermis by treatment
with dispase 0.5-1.0mg/ml in RPMI for 60-90 minutes at 37°C (Gibco) before
digestion in medium with 1.6mg/ml type IV collagenase (Worthington) for 12-16
hours at 37°C in RPMI with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Gentle
dissociation and passage through a 100μm filter generated single cell suspensions.
For some experiments, an enzyme-free preparation of leukocytes was required. Skin
was cultured as above but without collagenase. After 48 hours, migratory leukocytes
were harvested from the supernatant. Supernatants were stored at -80°C and later
used for cytokine analysis by Luminex assay (see below)

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded skin shave biopsies from GVHD diagnostic
material were used. 4μm sections were made. Antigen retrieval and staining were
performed using the BenchMark autostainer (Ventana). CD3, CD163, CD11c, factor
XIII and Ki67 primary antibodies and the ‘ultraview’ detection kit were used (X).

Fluorescence microscopy
200μm sheets of whole skin were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (X) and 30%
sucrose (X) in PBS (X) for 12-18 hours at 4°C, washed in PBS and stored at 4°C
until staining. Specimens were blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin (X) with 0.3%
TritonX-100 (X) in PBS and stained at 4°C for 12-18 hours with the following
primary:secondary combinations: CD11c-biotin (X):Streptavidin Cy5 (X); Factor XIII:
donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 647 (X); CD3 (X): donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor488
(X). Sections were immersed in DAPI-containing mounting medium for 12-18 hours
at 4°C, then visualized on a Zeiss Axioimager Z2 using the Apotome function and
Axiovision version 4.8 software.

Flow cytometry analysis and sorting
Antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed in Table S3. DAPI was added for dead
cell discrimination (X). Flow cytometry analysis and sorting was performed using BD
FACS Canto II, BD Fortessa X20, BD FACS Aria II and BD FACS Fusion running
FACSDiva version 7 and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar version X).

X/Y fluorescence in situ hybridization
Sorted cells were spun onto slides, fixed in methanol and acetic acid and prepared
with dual labeled XY FISH probes on a ThermoBrite system (Abbott) in accordance
with manufacturer’s instructions.

Gene expression by NanoString
Gene expression was quantified by NanoString, using the Human Immunology v2
panel with a custom 30-gene add-on targeting monocyte/macrophage and DC genes
(ASIP, C19orf59, CCL17, CD1C, CD207, CLEC10A, CLEC9A, CLNK, COBLL1,
CXCL5, DBN1, F13A1, FGD6, FLT3, GCSAM, GGT5, Ki67, LPAR2, LYVE1, MAFF,
MERTK, NDRG2, PACSIN1, PPM1N, PRAM1, S100A12, SIRPA ,TMEM14A,
UPK3A and ZBTB46). 3,000-10,000 sorted cells were pelleted and lysed in 5μl RLT
buffer (Qiagen) + 1% beta- mercaptoethanol yielding 50-150ng total RNA for
analysis. Hybridization was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions
using a NanoString Prep Station and Digital Analyzer. nSolver Analysis software
version 3.0 was used for background correction and normalization.

Healthy volunteer T cells were prepared from healthy blood donors by
immunodensity negative selection (Human T cell enrichment cocktail, Stemcell
15021) and labeled with 1μM CSFE (Invitrogen). T cells were co-cultured with
sorted macrophages or DCs at a 25:1 ratio for 7 days , incubated with antibodies to
CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR and CD69 (Table S3), and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Cytokine and chemokine quantification
Quantification was performed on medium from isolated macrophage populations
stimulated ex-vivo and medium conditioned by explanted GVHD skin and by donorrecipient MLR. For macrophage stimulation, FACS sorted skin macrophages were
stimulated with 100ng/ml LPS from E. coli (Sigma) and harvested at 10 hours.
Supernatants were cryopreserved at -80°C and batch-analyzed by Luminex assay
(ProcartaPlexTM 34-plex, EBioscience) using a Qiagen Liquichip 200 running
Luminex 100 integrated system software version 2.3. Procartaplex Analyst version
1.0 was used to define standard curves.

Skin explant assay
Blood from BMT donor and recipient pairs was prospectively collected into EDTA,
prior to transplnatation. Recipient PBMCs were irradiated (20Gy) and used as
stimulators for donor PBMCs at a 1:1 ratio. Cultures containing 1-5x107 donor
PBMCs were maintained in RPMI with 10% human AB serum (Sigma) for 7 days.
Macrophages and T cells were sorted from MLR outputs as HLADR+CD14+CD11c+ cells and SSCloCD3+ cells respectively. Shave biopsies of
recipient skin were taken prior to BMT conditioning. Biopsies were divided and
incubated with medium alone (negative control), 2x105 MLR lymphocytes or 2x105
MLR macrophages for 3 days in RPMI 1640 with 20% heat inactivated autologous

serum. Explants were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, sectioned and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin. Severity of histological damage was graded using the
Lerner scale by an experienced assessor blinded to experimental conditions (XN
Wang).

Quantification and statistical analysis
FlowJo version 9.6.7 was used for analysis of flow cytometry data. Principal
component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering and unpaired t-tests were
performed in MultiExperiment Viewer software version 4.8 (Saeed et al., 2003).
Other statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism, version 7.0.
