Summary
1. The on-going environmental crisis poses an urgent need for predicting future
extinction events, which can aid with targeting conservation efforts. Commonly,
such predictions are made based on conservation status assessments produced by
the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, when researchers apply these conservation status data for predicting future extinctions,
important information is often omitted, which can majorly impact the accuracy of
these predictions.
2. Here we present iucn_sim, a command line program, which implements an
improved approach for simulating future extinctions based on IUCN status data.
In contrast to previous approaches, iucn_sim explicitly models future changes
in conservation status for each species, based on information derived from the
IUCN assessment history of the last decades. Additionally the program considers
generation length information when translating status information into extinction
probabilities, as intended per IUCN definition.
3. The program implements a Markov-chain Monte Carlo estimation of extinction rates for each species, based on the simulated extinctions. These estimates
inherently contain the chances of conservation status changes and the generation
length of each given species.
4. Based on an empirical data example including all birds (class Aves), we find
that our improved approach has a strong effect on the estimated species-specific
extinction rates as well as on the overall number of predicted extinctions. Using
simulated data we show that iucn_sim reliably estimates extinction rates with
high accuracy if run for a sufficient number of simulations.

Introduction

2

We are in the middle of a massive biodiversity crisis (Barnosky et al., 2011; Davis

3

et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2019). Extinction risks have been steadily increasing for

4

as long as we have been keeping record (Ceballos et al., 2015), with no indications

5

of a slow down. It remains therefore vital to predict the number of future ex-

6

tinctions, whether in terms of species, phylogenetic, or functional diversity (Davis

7

et al., 2018; Cooke et al., 2019). An important use of such predictions is to aid

8

conservation prioritization (Mooers et al., 2008). However, all predictions require

9

reliable estimates of extinction risk.

10

One of the most authoritative global initiatives to quantify extinction risks

11

across animal and plant species is the IUCN Red List (IUCN, 2019), which cat-

12

egorizes the conservation status of organisms based on expert assessments. Since

13

2001, IUCN has adopted the IUCN v3.1 evaluation system for determining species’

14

conservation statuses (IUCN, 2001). By this standard, extant species are assessed

15

as Least Concern (LC), Near Threatened (NT), Vulnerable (VU), Endangered

16

(EN), or Critically Endangered (CR). If there is not sufficient information avail-

17

able for a species to enable a proper status assessment, the species is categorized

18

as Data Deficient (DD). Species that have not yet been reviewed by IUCN are

19

categorized as Non Evaluated (NE).

20

IUCN conservation status assessments have been used in numerous scientific

21

studies to infer future biodiversity loss (Cooke et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2018;

22

Faith, 2015; Mooers et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2019; Veron et al., 2016). The

23

challenge in this approach is to meaningfully transform the IUCN-defined conser-

24

vation status categories into explicit extinction probabilities. In these previous

25

studies, researchers have used specific extinction risks, which per IUCN definition

26

are associated with the threatened statuses VU, EN, and CR. Sometimes these

27

risks are also extrapolated to species of the statuses LC and NT (e.g. Davis et al.,

28

2018; Mooers et al., 2008; Veron et al., 2016).

29

In order for IUCN to decide on assigning a species to one of the threatened cate-

30

gories VU, EN, or CR, this species must meet at least one of five assessment criteria

31

(A-E). One of those criteria (E) is associated with a specific extinction probability,

32

while the other criteria (A-D) mostly encompass estimates of decreasing population

33

trends and fragmentation. The IUCN extinction probability thresholds defined in

34

criterion E are as follows:

35

• VU: 10% extinction probability within 100 years

36

• EN: 20% extinction probability within 20 years or 5 generations, whichever

37

38

39

is longer (maximum 100 years)
• CR: 50% extinction probability within 10 years or 3 generations, whichever
is longer (maximum 100 years)

40

Even though these extinction probabilities only apply to species assessed un-

41

der criterion E, they are commonly applied equally to all species sharing the same

42

conservation status (e.g. Davis et al., 2018; Mooers et al., 2008). The underly-

43

ing assumption that the minimum extinction risks defined for criterion E can be

44

meaningfully transferred to species listed under one of the other four criteria (A-D)

45

is difficult to test empirically, but is a necessary simplification in order to model

46

the extinction probabilities for the majority of species. However, there are several

47

other important aspects that can be easily incorporated but are commonly ne-

48

glected when translating IUCN conservation statuses into extinction probabilities.

49

Neglected information

50

To the best of our knowledge, there are two key elements that are usually not

51

incorporated when using IUCN data for future extinction predictions: generation

52

length (GL) and expected future conservation status changes.

53

Generation length is defined as the average turnover rate of breeding indi-

54

viduals in a population (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee, 2019) and

55

therefore reflects the turnover between generations. Generation length should not

56

be confused with age of sexual maturity, which can be used in the calculation

57

of generation length, but is not equivalent. As per the IUCN definition that we

58

stated above, the extinction probability for the categories EN and CR is to be

59

understood in context of the GL of the given species, if 5 × GL exceeds 20 years

60

for EN species, or if 3 × GL exceeds 10 years for CR species. We argue that in-

61

cluding GL data should be the standard practice when modelling extinction risks

62

based on IUCN data, particularly because GL data is readily available for many

63

species (e.g. BirdLife International, 2019; IUCN, 2019; Pacifici et al., 2013) and

64

can be meaningfully approximated through phylogenetic or body mass correlation

65

(Cooke et al., 2018) for species missing GL data.

66

A second missing element in future predictions, which has not previously been

67

addressed, relates to the fact that IUCN categories are generally treated as static

68

entities that do not change over time. However, almost two decades of IUCN re-

69

assessments of species (IUCN, 2019), using the IUCN v3.1 standard, have shown

70

that the conservation status of species can change significantly in a relatively short

71

time span, for instance as a result of the effectiveness of conservation efforts. For

72

a species classified as LC, the immediate extinction risk is negligibly small, while

73

for a species classified as CR, the immediate extinction risk is very high. But if

74

we simulate for example 100 years into the future, categories may change due to

75

new or intensified risks or thanks to conservation efforts, which inadvertently will

76

affect the extinction probabilities.

77

An example of a change in IUCN status is the Pink Pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri ),

78

which was listed as CR in the 1990’s, with only 9 birds remaining, due to habitat

79

loss and predation by introduced species (IUCN, 2019; Swinnerton, 2001). How-

80

ever, following an intensive conservation recovery program, the Pink Pigeon is now

81

listed as VU, with around 470 wild birds (IUCN, 2019). Yet, most species show

82

changes with the opposite trend, for example several species of vultures, which

83

are declining due to poisoning and persecution (Green et al., 2007). There are 22

84

species of vulture according to the IUCN Red List, 12 of these are classified as

85

threatened (VU, EN or CR), including 9 CR (IUCN, 2019), with sharp declines in

86

population sizes. For instance, the White-headed Vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis),

87

White-backed Vulture (Gyps africanus), Hooded Vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus)

88

and Rüppell’s Vulture (Gyps rueppelli ) were all listed as LC in 2004 but are now

89

all classified as CR. Information about these changes can be accessed through the

90

IUCN history record and can then be used to inform future simulations.

91

The iucn_sim program

92

Here we introduce iucn_sim, a command-line program that uses available IUCN

93

status assessments of species and generation lengths to simulate 1) future changes

94

in IUCN status, 2) possible times of extinction across species, 3) estimates of

95

species-specific extinction rates for any given set of extant species over a user-

96

defined time span (Fig. 1).

97

The program, including all software dependencies, is easy to install with a sin-

98

gle command (Supplementary Code Sample 1), using the conda package manager

99

(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Future simulations are based on extinc-

100

tion risks associated with the current IUCN statuses of the target species, while

101

modeling the possibility of status change informed by the IUCN history of a spec-

102

ified taxonomic group (reference group). The simulator accounts for generation

103

length of the target species, if these data are provided by the user, to properly

104

model the extinction probabilities associated with the IUCN statuses EN and CR.

105

Our simulation approach further allows for modeling DD and NE species for which

106

iucn_sim draws new statuses based on the IUCN history data and the current sta-

107

tus distribution of the reference group.

108

The program produces a future diversity trajectory of all input species as well

109

as an overview of the simulated future status distribution (Fig. 2). Further the

110

user can choose to plot individual histograms of simulated extinction times for each

111

species within a specified time frame. Finally iucn_sim estimates species-specific

112

extinction rates from the simulated extinction times, using a Markov-chain Monte

113

Carlo algorithm (MCMC).

114

The get_rates function

115

The purpose of the get_rates function (Supplementary Code Sample 2) is to

116

estimate the rates at which species are changing their IUCN status. It incorporates

117

user-provided GL data to calculate the extinction risk for statuses EN and CR, as

118

intended by IUCN definition. These rates are then applied in a subsequent step to

119

simulate future extinctions, while simultaneously modeling potential changes in the

120

IUCN status of species. We note that generation length is only directly involved

121

in the extinction risk for species with statuses EN and CR by IUCN definition,

122

but since our simulation approach incorporates the possibility of changes in IUCN

123

status there will also be a marginal effect of generation length in the extinction

124

risk for species currently assigned to other IUCN categories (see Fig 2a).

125

There are two main input types the user needs to provide for this function: A)

126

the name of a reference group which will be used to calculate status transition rates

127

and B) the list of target species names for which to simulate future extinctions,

128

including estimates of GL (if available).

129

Reference group

130

We model the changes in IUCN status as a stochastic process defined by transition

131

probabilities that quantify the expected number of transitions between any pair

132

of IUCN statuses. The status-transition events are derived from empirical IUCN

133

history data of a user-defined reference group. From these data we estimate annual

134

transition rates between all pairs of IUCN statuses, and use them in simulations

135

to predict future changes.

136

In order to estimate the status transition rates, the get_rates function down-

137

loads the complete IUCN history (starting at year 2001, to ensure compatibility

138

with the IUCN v3.1 standard) of all species belonging to the reference group,

139

using the rl_history() function of the R-package rredlist (Chamberlain, 2017).

140

As reference group, the user can either choose a single taxonomic group, such as

141

the class ‘Aves’, or a list of taxonomic groups, such as the orders ‘Passeriformes’

142

(passerines) and ‘Psittaciformes’ (parrots), or a list of species names.

143

Based on the fetched IUCN history data, the get_rates function counts all

144

types of status changes that have occurred in the history of the specified group

145

as well as the cumulative amount of time spent in each status across all species

146

(Table 1). The program then estimate the rates of transitions between pairs of

147

statuses using Bayesian sampling. For example, if Nij transitions were observed

148

from status i to status j and the cumulative time spent in i across all species

149

in the reference group is ti , the program applies a MCMC to sample the annual

150

transition rate qij from the following posterior:

P (qij |Nij , ti ) ∝ P (Nij , ti |qij ) × P (qij )

(1)

151

where the log likelihood function is that of a Poisson process describing status

152

change

log P (Nij , ti |qij ) ∝ Nij log(qij ) − qij ti
153

and P (qij ) ∼ U[0, ∞] is a uniform prior on the the transition rate. Posterior

154

samples of the transition rates are then used in the subsequent simulations to

155

predict future status changes while incorporating uncertainties in the rates.

156

The choice of the reference group is important, because the precision of the

157

estimated transition rates depends on the available number of empirical transi-

158

tions (Supplementary Fig. S1). There are two main considerations to make when

159

choosing a reference group: 1) Is the chosen reference group expected to reflect

160

the trends of status change for the species that are being simulated? 2) Does the

161

reference group contain a sufficient number of species so that stochastic effects do

162

not overrule the actual trends for that group?

163

These two objectives can conflict, for example if the objective is to simulate

164

future extinctions for vultures. In that case using all birds (class Aves) as reference

165

group (∼ 11,000 species) provides a large enough group where several occurrences

166

of each type of status change are being observed in the IUCN history. However,

167

given the notable recent worsening of almost all vulture species‘ conservation sta-

168

tus, the trends observed over all birds may not be representative of this group.

169

It is not an analytical requirement to choose a monophyletic clade as a reference

170

group.

171

As a general guideline we recommend to choose sufficiently large reference

172

groups of more than 1000 species to minimize stochastic effects (see Fig. S1).

173

In the best case (but not necessarily) this group should contain all of the target

174

species.

175

Target species list and GL data

176

Besides the reference group that is used for status transition rate estimation, the

177

user also provides a list of target species, which are the species whose future ex-

178

tinctions are being simulated. For all these species, get_rates fetches the current

179

IUCN protection status, if available. To translate these categories into explicit

180

extinction probabilities to be used for future simulations, we transformed the ex10

181

tinction probabilities (Et ) associated with threatened IUCN statuses (see Intro-

182

duction), defined over specific time frames (t), into annual extinction probabilities

183

(E1 ), using the formula provided by (Kindvall & Gärdenfors, 2003):

E1 = 1 −

p
t

1 − Et

184

From these annual extinction probabilities for threatened categories, we extrapo-

185

lated the annual extinction probabilities for statuses LC and NT by fitting a power

186

function to these points (Appendix 1), estimating the parameters a and b:

E1 = a × x b
187

with x representing the index of the IUCN category, sorted by increasing severity

188

(i.e. xLC = 1, xN T = 2, ..., xCR = 5).

189

To properly model the extinction probabilities linked to the IUCN categories

190

EN and CR for individual species, we strongly encourage users to provide GL esti-

191

mates for all target species. For species that are lacking GL information, this aspect

192

is disregarded. When ignoring GL information, the extinction risk for species with

193

moderate or long generation times (>3.33 years) will be overestimated (Fig 2),

194

based on the IUCN extinction risk assumptions outlined in the introduction.

195

The user may provide multiple GL estimates for each species, representing the

196

uncertainty around the GL estimate of each species, in which case get_rates will

197

calculate separate extinction probabilities for the statuses EN and CR for each

198

provided GL estimate. In that case each simulation replicate will draw randomly

199

from the produced EN and CR associated extinction probabilities, in order to

200

incorporate the uncertainty surrounding these estimates into the simulations.

201

The final status transition rates and the species-specific extinction probabilities

202

are exported as text files and are used in the next step to generate q-matrices

203

containing all transition rates and probabilities of extinction (separate q-matrix

204

for each species and simulation replicate). These q-matrices are then used to

205

simulate future extinctions, while simultaneously evolving the IUCN status of all

206

species.

207

The run_sim function

208

For running the run_sim function, the user provides the output of the get_rates

209

function and sets the number of years to be simulated into the future, as well

210

as the number of simulation replicates (Supplementary Code Samples 1 and 3).

211

The function will simulate future extinction dates, which are then used to infer

212

averaged extinction rates.

213

Treating non-assessed species

214

Before simulating into the future, each species is assigned its current IUCN status

215

as starting status. For all species currently assigned as DD, the function randomly

216

draws a new status at the beginning of each simulation replicate, based on the em-

217

pirical frequency of the estimated transition rates leading from DD to the statuses

218

LC, NT, VU, EN, or CR. All user-provided species names that cannot be found

219

in the IUCN taxonomy are modeled as NE. For these species a new valid status

220

is randomly drawn based on the frequencies of known IUCN statuses across all

221

species in the list. In each simulation, the function re-initializes the IUCN status

222

of DD and NE species, thus incorporating this uncertainty in the simulation.

227

The transitions rates between statuses are sampled from their posterior distri-

bution based on the reference group (Eqn. 1), whereas the extinction rates for

each status are assigned based on the IUCN guidelines and using GL information

for statuses EN and CR for each species. Rates from EX to any other class are

necessarily set to 0, as once extinct species are not allowed to switch back to any

For example one can simulate an increase of conservation efforts by a specific factor.

This factor is then applied to all rates in the q-matrix leading to an improvement

244

in conservation status for each species. The user can disable future status changes,

245

which simulates extinctions only based on the current conservation status of each

246

species, equivalent to the approach of Mooers et al. (2008) (Fig. 3).

247

As output, the function provides a summary of the sampled extinction dates

248

for each taxon and the probability of extinction by the user-provided date. After

249

replicating the simulations multiple times, the function collects for each species

250

a vector of extinction times tEX if tEX < tmax or waiting times of size tmax dur-

251

ing which the IUCN status might change without resulting in extinction. These

252

extinction and waiting times are then applied to estimate species-specific annual

253

extinction rates averaged across the time window considered for the simulations.

254

We note that the actual annual extinction rates can vary over time as a function

255

of changes in the IUCN status, so the extinction rates inferred here are a time-

256

averaged proxy of the process. However, since we do not expect the extinction

257

rate for a given taxon to stay constant over long time periods, particularly when

258

modeling changes in conservation status, we do not advice using iucn_sim to

estimate extinction rates spanning across several hundred years or more.

260

For a given set of extinction times and waiting times simulated for species i,

261

the run_sim function uses MCMC to obtain posterior samples of the extinction

262

rate µi using the likelihood function of a death process (Silvestro et al., 2019):

P (w|µi ) ∝ µD
i × exp(−µi

X

(wj ))

(2)

j∈w
263

where D is the number of instances in which w ≤ tmax , i.e. the number of species

264

predicted to go extinct within the considered time window. Posterior estimates

265

of the extinction rates are obtained through MCMC sampling from the posterior

266

distribution:

P (µi |w) ∝ P (w|µi ) × P (µi )

(3)

267

where P (µi ) is a uniform prior distribution set on the extinction rate U[0, ∞].

268

Testing accuracy of rate estimation

269

Status transition rates

270

We simulated IUCN status transitions under known rates, in order to test how

271

accurately our program estimates transition rates and what effect the size of the

272

chosen reference group has. Mimicking the empirical IUCN history data, we sim-

273

ulated IUCN status changes over a time period of 20 years for reference groups of

274

100, 1,000, and 10,000 species. The starting status for each species was drawn ran-

275

domly, based on the empirical frequencies of the current IUCN status distribution

276

across all birds. To produce realistic transition rates to use for our simulations, we

277

randomly drew these rates from a uniform range in log-space, ranging between the

278

minimum to the maximum empirical rate estimated for birds. We drew 30 rates

279

to reflect the 30 possible transition types between the six valid IUCN statuses

280

LC, NT, VU, EN, CR, and DD. We then simulated the change of IUCN statuses

281

through time in the same manner as described above for the future simulations

282

for the empirical bird data, with the difference that no extinction events are being

283

modeled.

284

After the IUCN history for all species was simulated in this manner, we counted

285

the occurrences of each status transition type and estimated the transition rates

286

from these counts, using the get_rates function. For comparison we plotted

287

the resulting rate estimates against the true rates that were used to simulate the

288

data (Fig. S1). Based on the results we recommend choosing reference groups

289

of preferably more than 1,000 species, because stochastic fluctuations of status

290

counts below that threshold preclude the estimation of transition rates with any

291

meaningful accuracy, particularly so for low rates.

292

Extinction rates

293

We simulated extinction times for 1000 species under known extinction rates, to

294

evaluate the accuracy of the estimated extinction rates produced by the run_sim

295

function. The extinction rates (µ) that were used for these simulations were ran-

296

domly drawn from a uniform range (in log-space) with a minimum and maximum

297

value derived from the annual IUCN extinction risks of the statuses LC and CR,

298

respectively, as modeled in this study. Based on the chosen number of simula-

299

tion replicates, N extinction time replicates (te ) were drawn randomly from an

300

exponential distribution with mean 1/µ for each species:

This simulation was repeated for 100, 1,000, and 10,000 simulation replicates, in

303

The results show that iucn_sim estimates extinction rates with high accuracy, yet

304

it requires around 10,000 simulation replicates to ensure this accuracy also for very

305

low rates, as those for species starting as LC (Fig. 4).

We ran iucn_sim to estimate future extinction events for all birds over the next

Generating GL estimates

310

As an underlying taxonomy we downloaded species lists of all extant bird species

311

from IUCN v2019-2 (IUCN, 2019), with the R-package rredlist (Chamberlain,

312

2017). Generation length data for the majority of these species was provided

313

by BirdLife International (http://www.birdlife.org). For all remaining species we

314

modeled GL estimates using multivariate phylogenetic imputation under the as-

315

sumption that GL has a phylogenetic correlation and is also correlated with body

316

mass. Body mass data was downloaded from Cooke et al. (2019), which is based

317

on data from the databases EltonTraits (Wilman et al., 2014) and the Amniote

318

Life History Database (Myhrvold et al., 2015). To obtain phylogenies we down-

319

loaded 1000 samples of the posterior species trees distribution produced by Jetz

320

et al. (2012), based on the Ericson backbone (“EricsonStage2_0001_1000.zip").

321

A fraction of 90% of bird species names listed in IUCN v2019-2 were also present

322

in the phylogenies. After taxonomic revision we matched 96% of all IUCN bird

323

species with the tips in the phylogenies.

324

To estimate GL values for all species lacking such data, we ran a phylogenetic

325

imputation, using the R-package rphylopars (Goolsby et al., 2017). To determine

326

the best model we calculated the AIC score for all available models (Supplemen-

327

tary Fig. S2) and chose ‘EB’ as the best model based on the AIC results. In

328

order to incorporate the uncertainty of the phylogenetic estimates, we ran sepa-

329

rate imputations for 100 randomly selected trees from the downloaded species tree

330

distribution. We exported the 100 resulting mean values of the GL estimates for

331

each species.

332

For all remaining species that were not present in the phylogeny we modelled

333

the GL value to be the mean of the encompassing genus, calculated separately for

334

each of the 100 GL data replicates. This resulted in our final dataset containing

335

GL estimates for all bird species listed by IUCN v2019-2. The GL estimates for

336

all birds as well as those for other groups are available on the project’s GitHub

337

page.

338

Running iucn_sim

339

We provided the list of IUCN bird species names and the 100 GL estimates for

340

each species as input for get_rates (Supplementary Code sample 1). As refer-

341

ence group we used the whole class Aves (∼ 11,000 species). Table 1 shows the

342

counted empirical occurrences of each status transition type within the IUCN his-

343

tory of birds. The transition rates estimated from these counts can be found in

344

the Supplementary Data.

345

We used these transition rate estimates and the GL-informed extinction prob-

346

abilities calculated by the get_rates function to run 10,000 future simulations for

347

the next 100 years for all birds, using the run_sim function (Supplementary Code

348

sample 1). Figure 2 shows the resulting simulated diversity trajectory and status

349

distribution for the next 100 years, with a predicted mean of 737 bird species losses

350

(95% credibility interval: 680 to 799 species). The resulting simulated extinction

351

probabilities and estimated extinction rates for all bird species can be found in the

352

Supplementary Data.

353

Our empirical results show that accounting for GL decreases the resulting ex-

354

tinction rate estimates (Fig. 3). As an example we highlight this effect for the

355

Red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), which is categorized as CR and has a rel-

356

atively long generation length of 15 years (Fig. 3b). This effect on CR species

357

with long GL times is expected since the immediate extinction probability applied

358

in the simulations for EN and CR species decreases when incorporating the GL

359

information, according to IUCN definition (see Introduction). But also for LC

360

species, as highlighted for the Turkey vulture (Cathartes aura, GL = 9.9 years),

361

a small decreasing effect of GL data incorporation can be seen in the extinction

362

rate estimates, since occasionally these species will change to the categories EN or

363

CR in the future simulations, when allowing for future status changes (Fig. 3a).

364

Overall, accounting for GL data leads to a decrease in the number of predicted ex-

365

tinctions across the whole target group (birds in our example, see Supplementary

366

Fig. S3).

367

The effect of modeling future status changes can vary and can lead to an

368

increase or decrease in the estimated extinction rates for a given species. The

369

strength and direction of this effect depends on the estimated status transition

370

rates and is therefore expected to change depending on the chosen reference group.

371

However, for LC species this usually leads to an increase in the estimated extinction

372

rates (Fig. 3c), because these species can only change to a more threatened status

373

(LC being the least threatened status). Similarly for CR species the effect of

374

modeling future status changes typically leads to a decrease in extinction rates

375

(Fig. 3d), since species can only switch to less threatened categories in the future

376

(CR being the most threatened status). Overall, modeling future status changes

377

leads to a sharp increase in the number of predicted extinctions across the whole

378

target group (Fig. S3).

379

Conclusions

380

To summarize, the incorporation of both GL and future status changes increases

381

the biological credibility of the resulting extinction rate estimates for individual

382

species, as well as that of the estimated number of species extinctions for the

383

whole target group. It is therefore strongly advisable to include these two factors

384

when producing future extinction predictions based on IUCN status information

385

and it should be adopted as standard practice, particularly for groups with a well

386

covered IUCN record and with available GL data. The source code of our program

387

388

389

open for contributions and feedback from users, leading to the incorporation of

390

further improvements for predicting future extinctions. Future additions to the

391

program could for example include more specific future modeling of species based

392

on similarities in biological traits, geographic location, or niche space.

Figure 1: Workflow of iucn_sim. The user defines a reference group for status
transition rate estimation, as well as a list of target species for which future extinctions and status changes will be simulated. Optionally the user is encouraged to
also provide GL estimates for each target species, which are applied in calculating
the extinction risks associated with the statuses EN and CR. The current conservation status of all species is determined, using available IUCN information. All of
these steps take place within the get_rates function, as indicated by the grey box
in the top right of the figure. The estimated transition rates, calculated extinction
risks, and current status distribution of all target species is parsed on into the
run_sim function. Next, these data are applied to simulate future status changes
and extinctions. Finally extinction rates are estimated from the simulation output
and various summary statistics and plots are being produced as output.

simulations included body mass data for all species and we allowed for future
status changes.

Figure 3: The effect of generation length (GL) and status-change (SC) on estimated extinction rates. The plots show histograms of the posterior density of
extinction rates estimated with iucn_sim for two different species: the Turkey
vulture (Cathartes aura, GL = 9.9 years, Least Concern), panels a) and c); and
the Red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus, GL = 15 years, Critically Endangered),
panels b) and d). Upper panels show that the extinction rate estimates slightly decrease when including GL data into the simulations (purple) compared to ignoring
GL data (red) for both LC and CR species. Bottom panels show that modeling
future status changes slightly increases the extinction rate of LC species, but leads
to a decrease for CR species (d). Note that the effect of future status changes on
extinction rates depends on the estimated status transition rates and is therefore
expected to change depending on the chosen reference group.

Figure 4: Increasing precision and accuracy of extinction rate estimates with more
simulation replicates. We plotted the true extinction rates that were used to
simulate extinction times for 1000 putative species (x-axis) against the extinction
rates estimated with the run_sim function (y-axis). We then ran three analyses
with (a) 100, (b) 1,000, and (c) 10,000 simulation replicates. The plots show
the mean values (blue dots) and the 95% credible interval (grey vertical lines).
The dotted horizontal line shows the minimum extinction rate estimate based on
the empirical dataset for all birds (10,000 simulation replicates). Extinction rates
below this line are therefore unlikely to occur in empirical data sets. The diagonal
red line shows a theoretical perfect correlation for reference.
