ABSTRACT

25

Many bacteria interact with target organisms using syringe-like structures called

26

Contractile Injection Systems (CIS). CIS structurally resemble headless bacteriophages

27

and share evolutionarily related proteins such as the tail tube, sheath, and baseplate

28

complex. Recent evidence shows that CIS are specialized to puncture membranes and

29

often deliver effectors to target cells. In many cases, CIS mediate trans-kingdom

30

interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes, however the effectors delivered to target

31

cells and their mode of action are often unknown. In this work, we establish an in vitro

32

model to study a CIS called Metamorphosis Associated Contractile structures (MACs)

33

that target eukaryotic cells. We show that MACs kill two eukaryotic cell lines, Fall

34

Armyworm Sf9 cells and J774A.1 murine macrophage cells through the action of a

35

newly identified MAC effector, termed Pne1. To our knowledge, Pne1 is the first CIS

36

effector exhibiting nuclease activity against eukaryotic cells. Our results define a new

37

mechanism of CIS-mediated bacteria-eukaryote interaction and are a first step toward

38

understanding structures with the potential to be developed as novel delivery systems

39

for eukaryotic hosts.

INTRODUCTION

42

Bacteria interact with eukaryotic organisms with outcomes ranging from pathogenic to

43

beneficial. One mechanism used by bacteria to interact with eukaryotes is through

44

Contractile Injection Systems (CIS) (Taylor et al., 2018). CIS are evolutionarily related to

45

the tails of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) and are composed of an inner tube

46

surrounded by a contractile sheath, capped with a tail spike and a baseplate complex.

47

CIS can be classified into two types; Type 6 Secretion Systems (T6SS) and

48

extracellular CIS (eCIS), also known as phage tail-like bacteriocins or tailocins. While

49

T6SS reside within the bacterial cytoplasm and are anchored to the inner membrane of

50

Gram-negative bacteria (Ho et al., 2014)(Böck et al., 2017), eCIS are released

51

extracellularly by bacterial cell lysis and bind their target cell surface (Hurst et al., 2004;

52

Shikuma et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2006). It has been speculated that eCIS may be an

53

evolutionary intermediate between bacteriophage and T6SS (Büttner et al., 2016).

54
55

In both eCIS and T6SS, contraction of the sheath drives the inner tube and tail spike

56

through the target cell membrane and both often deliver effectors to host cells. For

57

example, an eCIS called Photorhabdus Virulence Cassettes (PVC) injects an effector

58

causing actin condensation in insect hemocytes (Yang et al., 2006). In T6SS, a number

59

of effectors are described that specifically target eukaryotic cells (Lien and Lai, 2017).

60

The modes of action of these T6SS effectors include actin cross-linking in macrophages

61

(Pukatzki et al., 2007), interaction with microtubules for invasion of epithelial cells (Sana

62

et al., 2015), and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of HeLa cells (Suarez et al., 2010).

63

However, to our knowledge and until the present work, no CIS effectors (T6SS or eCIS)

64

targeting eukaryotic cells are yet described that possess nuclease activity.

65
66

One group of evolutionarily related CIS have been shown to mediate interactions with

67

diverse eukaryotic organisms including amoeba, grass grubs, wax moths and wasps

68

(Böck et al., 2017; Hurst et al., 2007; Penz et al., 2012, 2010; Sarris et al., 2014; Yang

69

et al., 2006). We recently described a related eCIS mediating the beneficial relationship

70

between the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudoalteramonas luteoviolacea and a marine

71

tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, hereafter Hydroides (Shikuma et al., 2014, 2016). We

72

called this eCIS from P. luteoviolacea MACs for Metamorphosis Associated Contractile

73

structures, because they stimulate the metamorphosis of Hydroides (Shikuma et al.,

74

2014). MACs are the first CIS discovered to form arrays of phage tail-like structures

75

composed of about 100 tails and often measure about 1 µm in diameter. While MACs

76

provide another example of CIS-eukaryote interactions, the range of hosts targeted by

77

eCIS like MACs as well as the identity and mode of action of effectors that mediate

78

these interactions remain poorly understood.

79
80

To study the interaction between MACs and eukaryotic cells, we establish an in vitro

81

CIS-cell line interaction model with insect and mammalian cell types. Using these

82

systems, we identify a new MAC effector with nuclease activity that is responsible for

83

cytotoxicity in both cell types. Our results indicate that MACs can interact with a range

84

of host cells and a specific effector mediates killing of eukaryotic cells.

RESULTS

87

MACs kill insect cell lines in vitro. To study MACs from P. luteoviolacea and test their

88

effect on eukaryotic cells, we focused on an insect cell line from the Fall Armyworm

89

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9), the closest relative to Hydroides where established cell

90

lines are commercially available. Upon co-incubation of purified MACs, we observed the

91

lysis of Sf9 cells within 48 hours (Figure 1A). As a control, we included cell-free

92

purifications from a strain lacking the MAC baseplate gene macB, which is unable to

93

produce intact phage tail-like structures and multi-tailed arrays (Shikuma et al., 2014).

94

When Sf9 cells were co-incubated with purifications from a DmacB strain or extraction

95

buffer alone, the cells remained viable (Figure 1B and C). We quantified the activity of

96

MACs against Sf9 cells by staining dead cells using a colorimetric stain, trypan blue, or

97

by a fluorescent dual stain, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI), which

98

stains live and dead cells, respectively. Using both methods, we observed cell death

99

when cells were exposed to wild-type MACs, while death was not observed with

100

purifications from a ∆macB strain or the extraction buffer (Figure 1D-H). Filtering extract

101

from wild-type cells through a 0.45-µm filter abolished the cell killing effect (Figure 1I),

102

consistent with the observation that MACs form >0.45µm arrays (Shikuma et al., 2014).

103

Our results suggest that MACs are capable of targeting and killing insect cells.

showed that a locus containing six genes (JF50_12590-JF50_12615) within the P.

115

tubeworm Hydroides, yet a mutant lacking all 6 genes is still able to produce intact MAC

116

structures (Shikuma et al., 2016). To determine whether MACs require this same locus

117

for killing of insect cell lines, we tested whether P. luteoviolacea mutants lacking each of

118

the six genes were deficient in MAC-mediated insect cell killing. Among those six

119

genes, only a DJF50_12610 mutant was unable to cause cell death upon co-incubation

120

with insect cells (Figure 2A-G). These results were quantified and confirmed using

121

trypan blue or FDA/PI staining (Figure 2K and L). When JF50_12610 was introduced

122

back into its native chromosomal locus, the killing effect of MACs was restored (Figure

123

2H). Intriguingly, when we tested MACs from the DJF50_12610 mutant against larvae

124

from Hydroides elegans we found that this strain was capable of stimulating

125

metamorphosis at levels comparable to that of wild-type MACs (Figure 2M), suggesting

126

functional structures are still present.

127
128

To determine whether the ∆JF50_12610 strain produces intact MAC structures, we

129

employed electron cryo-tomography (ECT). Upon inspection, MACs from wild type and

130

∆JF50_12610 were indistinguishable; forming intact phage tail-like structures in both

131

extended and contracted conformations (Figure 2N and O). In order to confirm that

132

JF50_12610 is part of the MAC complex, we utilized protein identification by mass

133

spectrometry on purified MAC extracts from WT P. luteoviolacea. In two independent

134

experiments, we detected JF50_12610 which indicated that the protein is associated

135

with the MAC complex (Figure S1A). To determine whether the ∆JF50_12610

136

phenotype was due to the differential production of MACs, we quantified MACs tagged

137

with super folder GFP by fluorescent microscopy and found no difference in quantity

138

between wild-type and ∆JF50_12610 strains grown under identical conditions (Figure

140

does not affect the ability of MACs to stimulate tubeworm metamorphosis or the

141

production of functional MACs. The genes within the JF50_12590-JF50_12615 locus

142

required for tubeworm metamorphosis, and not insect cell killing, are the subject of a

143

separate work.

158

The JF50_12610 protein possesses nuclease activity in vitro and this activity is

159

necessary for insect cell death. To determine the function of JF50_12610, we

160

searched the 496 amino acid long protein for conserved domains and homologous

161

proteins. We found that JF50_12610 contains a DNA/RNA non-specific nuclease

162

domain (Pfam: PF13930). Analysis with the Phyre2 protein prediction program (Kelley

163

et al., 2015) showed that residues 258-348 of JF50_12610 bear 20% identity to the

164

nuclease Spd1 from Streptococcus pyogenes (Korczynska et al., 2012), and residues

165

267-348 bear 30% identity to the nuclease Sda1 also from S. pyogenes (Moon et al.,

166

2016) (Figure 3A). Through these partial alignments, we identified a conserved glutamic

167

acid at residue 328 corresponding to Glu164 of Spd1 and Glu225 of Sda1 that

168

coordinate water molecules hydrating the magnesium in the enzyme’s active site

169

(Korczynska et al., 2012; Moon et al., 2016). Consistent with its predicted function as a

170

toxic effector against eukaryotic cells, JF50_12610 protein is predicted to contain a

171

nuclear localization signal [NLStradamus program (Nguyen Ba et al., 2009)], which

172

typically targets proteins to the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Based on the predicted

173

function of JF50_12610 and the results below, we named this effector Pne1 for

174

Pseudoalteromonas nuclease effector 1.

176

To determine whether Pne1 possesses nuclease activity, we cloned the wild type pne1

177

gene and a pne1-Glu328Ala mutant into an IPTG-inducible vector system with N-

178

terminal 6xHis tag and purified both proteins by nickel affinity chromatography (Figure

179

3B). When co-incubated with linear double-stranded DNA, Pne1 and Pne1-Glu328Ala

180

both exhibited nuclease activity (Figure 3C), whereas a control protein, green

181

fluorescence protein (GFP), cloned and purified under the same conditions, did not

182

exhibit DNase activity. Based on similarities between Pne1 and magnesium-dependent

183

homologous proteins Spd1 and Sda1, we tested the DNase activity of Pne1 protein in

184

the presence of the divalent cation chelator, EDTA. Interestingly, Pne1 and the Pne1-

185

Glu328Ala proteins were still functional in the presence of EDTA (Figure 3D).

186
187

To test whether Pne1 requires its nuclear localization signal or the conserved Glu328

188

for killing insect cells, we created P. luteoviolacea mutants lacking the predicted nuclear

189

localization signal (residues 19-52) pne1-∆NLS or with the pne1-Glu328Ala point

190

mutation in their native chromosomal loci. Upon exposure to insect cells, MACs from the

191

pne1-∆NLS strain partially abolished the killing effect and MACs from the pne1-

192

Glu328Ala strain were unable to kill insect cells when compared to wild-type MACs

193

(Figure 3G, H, K, F). Our results show that Pne1 possesses nuclease activity in vitro

194

and its nuclear localization signal may be partially responsible for the killing effect. While

195

the Glu328Ala is not required for nuclease activity in vitro, this residue is necessary for

196

MACs to kill insect cells. We are currently investigating how the Glu328Ala residue

197

contributes to insect cell killing.

212

MACs possess a broad host range, killing J774A.1 murine macrophage cell line in

213

vitro. To determine whether MACs are capable of targeting a broader range of

214

eukaryotic cells, we tested the ability of MACs to kill mammalian cells. We chose the

215

commonly used murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 as these immune cells often

216

encounter microbial pathogens and their effectors. Upon exposure of J774A.1 cells to

217

wild-type MACs, we observed cell death within 24 hours (Figure 4A). In contrast, MACs

218

from a ∆pne1 and ∆macB, or buffer alone did not exhibit cell killing (Figure B-D).

219

Quantification of cytotoxicity by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays confirmed

220

the observed killing upon exposure to wild-type MACs and lack of killing upon exposure

221

to MACs from the ∆pne1 (Figure 4E). Taken together, our results show that MACs are

222

capable of targeting and killing mammalian cells and the cell killing phenotype is

223

dependent on the presence of Pne1.

DISCUSSION

233

In this work, we establish an in vitro interaction model between an eCIS and two

234

eukaryotic cell lines. With this system, we determined that the bacterial protein, Pne1, is

235

a novel eCIS effector and possesses nuclease activity. To our knowledge, our work is

236

the first to identify a CIS with broad eukaryotic host range and identify the first

237

eukaryotic-targeting CIS effector with nuclease activity.

238
239

Here, we show Pne1-dependent cell death of insect and mammalian cell lines, yet we

240

have also previously observed that MACs stimulate metamorphosis in the tubeworm

241

Hydroides (Shikuma et al., 2014). While it is unclear why MACs possess an effector-

242

mediated killing of eukaryotic cells, some symbiotic bacteria have been shown to use

243

CIS to modulate their host range. For example, the nitrogen-fixing plant symbiont

244

Rhizobium leguminosarum limits its host range to plants in the clover family by secreting

245

proteins through a T6SS, while mutation of the imp gene cluster (encoding components

246

of the T6SS) allowed the bacterium to form functional root nodules on pea plants,

247

normally outside of its host range (Bladergroen et al., 2003). In the environment,

248

Pseudoalteromonas species are found in association with many marine invertebrates

249

(Holmstrom and Kjelleberg, 1999), and might utilize MACs and Pne1 to antagonize

250

specific eukaryotes, like bacterivorous ciliates, while also stimulating the metamorphosis

251

of other eukaryotes like Hydroides. While several CIS nuclease effectors have been

252

identified targeting bacterial cells, including Tde1 from the soil bacterium Agrobacterium

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/543298; this version posted February 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

253

tumefaciens (Ma et al., 2014), RhsA from D. dandantii (Koskiniemi et al., 2013), and

254

RhsP from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Jiang et al., 2018), Pne1 is the first CIS nuclease

255

effector to our knowledge that targets eukaryotic organisms. Interestingly, the eukaryotic

256

NLS at the N-terminus of Pne1 had a partial effect on its ability to kill insect cells, further

257

implying its evolved role in targeting eukaryotic hosts. We are currently examining how

258

MACs have different effects on other cell types and organisms.

259
260

The host range of eukaryotic-targeting eCISs are currently poorly understood.

261

Intriguingly, work on related CIS show that many of them target eukaryotic organisms

262

from diverse lineages (e.g. Grass Grubs, Wax moth, Wasps, and Amoeba)(Böck et al.,

263

2017; Hurst et al., 2007; Penz et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2006),. While the ability of

264

related eCIS, the Anti-feeding prophage (Afp) and Photorhabdus Virulence Cassettes

265

(PVC), to target eukaryotic cells has been attributed to tail fibers that resemble receptor-

266

binding proteins from adenovirus (Hurst et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006), we detected no

267

protein homology in MAC structures. We report here that MACs are capable of targeting

268

multiple in vitro cell lines from insect and mammalian lineages. By further studying how

269

eCIS, like MACs, have evolved from bacteriophage origins to target eukaryotic cells, we

270

can begin to determine the underlying mechanisms associated with these diverse

271

interactions.

272
273

In addition to expanding our basic understanding of CIS, our work opens the door for

274

potentially using eCIS for biotechnology purposes. eCIS that target bacterial pathogens

275

are already under development as narrow host-range antimicrobial agents (Scholl,

276

2017), for example against the gastrointestinal pathogen, Clostridium difficile (Gebhart

277

et al., 2015). As syringe-like structures that deliver proteinaceous cargo to eukaryotic

278

cells, we are currently working to develop MACs as potential delivery systems for

279

biotechnology applications. While the mechanism of any eCIS-eukaryotic cell

280

attachment has yet to be determined, it is tantalizing to imagine using genetically-

281

modified CIS to deliver peptides of interest to specific eukaryotic cell types. The in vitro

282

system described in this work will significantly facilitate the realization of these efforts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

285

Bacterial Strains and Plasmid Constructions

286

All the strains and primers used throughout the experiments reported can be seen in

287

tables below (Table 1, 2). All deletion and fusion strains were created according to

288

previously published protocols (Shikuma et al., 2014, 2016). Plasmid insert sequences

289

were verified by DNA sequencing. Deletion and insert strains were confirmed by PCR.

290

All E.coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37°C shaking at 200

291

revolutions per minute (RPM). All P. luteoviolacea cultures were grown in seawater

292

tryptone (SWT) media (35.9 g/L Instant Ocean, 2.5g/L tryptone, 1.5 g/L yeast extract,

293

1.5 mL/L glycerol) at 25°C shaking at 200 RPM. Media that containing antibiotics were

294

at a concentration of 100 mg/mL unless otherwise stated.

295
296

MAC Purifications

297

MACs are produced by the marine bacteria Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea as

298

described previously (Shikuma et al., 2014). Briefly, cells were struck out from frozen

299

stock on SWT agar and grown at 25˚C or room temperature for 1-2 days. Cells were

300

inoculated into 5 mL SWT broth and grown for 24 hours, 25˚C at 200 rpm. Cultures

301

were inoculated 0.5 mL into 50 mL SWT in a 250 mL flask and grown for 16 hours, 25˚C

302

at 200 rpm. Cultures were transferred to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes and

303

centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 minutes at 4˚C. Cultures were kept on ice after this step.

304

Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 5mL

305

of cold extraction buffer (20mM Tris Base, 1M NaCl, 1L of deionized water, adjust the

306

pH to 7.5 with HCl). The resuspension mixture was then transferred to a 15mL

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/543298; this version posted February 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

307

centrifuge tube and placed in the centrifuge for another 20 minutes at 4000g at 4°C.

308

This time, the supernatant was transferred to another 15mL tube and spun down one

309

last time with the same above conditions. After this final spin, the supernatant (now

310

called MAC extract) was carefully poured to another clean 15mL tube and kept at 4°C

311

until it was ready to be used for cell infections. In some experiments, MAC extract was

312

filtered through a 0.45µm syringe filter.

313
314

MAC Quantification

315

The quantification of MACs followed the same protocols and methods from with the

316

following modifications (Thurber et al., 2009). As MACs do not contain nucleic acids, no

317

SYBR staining was performed. We used a 0.22µm anodisc to filter clusters using the

318

same apparatus set forth by Rower and group. The anodisc was placed on the vacuum

319

stage with the shiny side facing up. Then, the glass column and clamp were secured on

320

top of it and 2mL of 1XPBS was added and allowed to run through the column. Once

321

the PBS was filtered and the anodisc apparatus was successfully placed, 100µL of MAC

322

extract was added to 900µL of 1XPBS and run through the filter. Once all the liquid

323

passed through the anodisc, the clamp and column were taken out before shutting off

324

the vacuum to assure that the anodisc stayed on the stage. The anodisc was placed on

325

a kimwipe to allow it to dry properly for a few minutes. Once dried, a slide was made

326

using 10µL of the microscope mount (10% ascorbic acid 1XPBS with 50% glycerol, filter

327

sterilize mount with 0.02µm filter) “sandwiching” the anodisc. A ZEISS microscope was

328

used to quantify MACs tagged with sf-GFP. Quantification of MACs were performed

329

using column diameter, field of view and volume.

330
331

Insect Cell Culture

332

To test the effect of P. luteoviolacea MACs interaction with eukaryotic insect cell lines,

333

we used Sf9 cells (Novagen #71104-3). Cells were cultured in ESF 921 Insect Cell

334

Culture Medium (Expression systems #96-001-01). Frozen cell line stocks were taken

335

from -80°C freezer and thawed quickly at 27°C in a water bath. Thawed cells (~1mL)

336

were added to a 125mL flask containing 10mL of room temperature ESF 921. Cells

337

were then placed in a 27°C incubator shaker, shaking at 130 rpm, in the dark. Cell lines

338

were maintained by passaging every 2-3 days using routine cell culture techniques.

339
340

Insect Cell Co-incubation with MACs

341

Prior to treatment with MACs, Sf9 cells were passaged five to twenty times and seeded

342

into 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 4x105 cells/mL a few hours before

343

infection. MACs that were extracted no more than a week prior to cell infections were

344

added to each well of the 24-well plates with cells at a 1:50 ratio (10µL of the extracts

345

into 500µL of cells). Infected cells were incubated at 27°C, adherently. At 48 hours,

346

trypan blue or PI/FDA was added to each well of the 24-well infection plates and

347

microscopic images were taken of each well to visualize and quantify cell viability.

348
349

Protein Purification

350

The JF50_12610 wild type, JF50_12610-Glu328Ala and Green Fluorescence Protein

351

(GFP) were cloned into a pET15b vector with N-terminal 6xHis tag. The protein was

352

overexpressed in 500mL of LB medium growing at 37ºC until 0.9OD600 and induced

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/543298; this version posted February 11, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

353

using 1.0mM IPTG at 25ºC for 4 hours, followed by a centrifugation step of 4000g for

354

20min at 4ºC. The cell pellet was resuspended using a native lysis buffer (0.5M NaCl,

355

20mM Tris-HCl, 20mM imidazole, pH 8). The resuspended cell lysate was then

356

submitted to a French press 2X, which was followed by sonication on high (10 seconds

357

sonication, repeated twice, done on ice). Following cell sonication, the supernatant was

358

purified by a bulk Ni-NTA beads, washed with 20mL lysis buffer on column, and eluted

359

using elution buffer (0.5M NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl, 250mM imidazole, pH 8) where protein

360

fractions were collected. Eluted protein was buffer exchanged using pierce protein

361

concentrators (thermos fisher cat# 88513) into (0.15M NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8)

362

Collected protein fractions were then quantified using a Thermo-Fisher Pre-diluted

363

protein standards kit (catalog# 23208), and subsequently read on a Biotek plate reader

364

(catalog# 49984). Proteins were then normalized to equal concentrations prior to

365

nuclease assay.

366
367

Nuclease Assay

368

In order to test the bioinformatically predicted nuclease activity found in JF50_12610, a

369

DNase assay was developed. The wild type JF50_12610, JF50_12610-E328A and

370

Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) were purified simultaneously and identically prior to

371

assay. After protein purification, protein concentrations were normalized to 0.5µg/µL,

372

including a positive control commercially available DNase I (BioBasic #DD0099-1). All

373

normalized proteins were then incubated for 2 hours at 37ºC with a PCR DNA fragment

374

of known size and concentration and NEB cutsmart buffer (New England Biosciences

375

#B72045). A reaction total volume of 20µL consisted of 12µL of protein, 6µL of DNA

376

diluted in buffer (0.15M NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), and 2µL of 10X cutsmart buffer.

377

After 1-hour of incubation, all reactions and their replicates were resolved in an 1%

378

agarose gel stained with EtBr in 1XTBE (Tris-Borate EDTA, BioBasic #A00265) at 110

379

volts for about 45 minutes. Gel products were then visualized in a BioRad gel imaging

380

machine (Gel Doc™ EZ System #1708270) appropriately. The +EDTA reaction was

381

completed identically to the protocol above with the exclusion of the NEB cut smart

382

buffer and addition of 20mM EDTA (final concentration) to the reaction mixture.

383
384

Gentle MAC extraction and mass spectrometry

385

P. luteoviolacea was grown in 50mL Marine Broth (MB) media in 250mL flasks at 30˚C

386

for 6 hours or overnight (12-14 hours). Cells were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 7000 g

387

and 4˚C and resuspended in 5mL cold extraction buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1M NaCl).

388

The resuspensions were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 g and 4˚C and the

389

supernatant was isolated and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 7000 g and 4˚C. The pellet

390

was resuspended in 20-100µL cold extraction buffer and stored at 4°C for further use.

391

All mass spectrometry was done by the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ). To

392

prep the MAC extracts for mass spectrometry, the extracts were precipitated by mixing

393

30µL of sample with 70µl water and 100µl 20% TCA. The samples were then washed

394

twice with cold acetone. The dry pellets were dissolved in 45µl buffer (10mM Tris/2mM

395

CaCl2, pH 8.2) and 5µl trypsin (100ng/µL in 10mM HCl). They were then microwaved for

396

30 minutes at 60˚C. The samples were dried, then dissolved in 20µL 0.1% formic acid

397

and transferred to autosampler vials for LC/MS/MS. 1µL was injected.

399

Electron cryo-tomography of MAC arrays

400

For ECT imaging of MAC arrays, P. luteoviolacea WT and ΔJF50_12610 were cultured

401

for 5-6 hours at 30°C and subsequently centrifuged for 30 minutes at ~7000 g. The

402

pellet was resuspended in 5mL of extraction buffer and centrifuged for 30 minutes at

403

4000 g to separate intact cells from MAC arrays. The supernatant was carefully

404

transferred into a new tube and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 7000 g. The pellet was

405

resuspended in about 50 µL of extraction buffer and mixed with Protein A-conjugated

406

10-nm colloidal gold (Cytodiagnostics Inc.) before plunge freezing. Plunge freezing and

407

ECT imaging were performed according to Weiss et al. (Weiss et al., 2017). 4 µL of

408

sample was applied to glow-discharged EM grids (R2/1 copper, Quantifoil), blotted twice

409

from the back for 3.5 s and vitrified in liquid ethane–propane using a Vitrobot Mark IV

410

(ThermoFisher). ECT data were collected on a Titan Krios (ThermoFisher) transmission

411

electron microscope equipped with a Quantum LS imaging filter (Gatan, slit with 20 eV)

412

and K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). Tilt series were acquired with the

413

software SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) using a bidirectional tilt scheme. The angular

414

range was −60° to +60° and the angular increment was 2°. The total electron dose was

415

between 60–100 electrons per Å2 and the pixel size at specimen level was 2.72 Å.

416

Images were recorded in focus with a Volta phaseplate (ThermoFisher) for WT and

417

without phaseplate at 5 µm under-focus for ΔJF50_12610. Tilt series were aligned using

418

gold fiducials and three-dimensional reconstructions were calculated by weighted back

419

projection using IMOD (Mastronarde, 1997). Visualization was done in IMOD. Contrast

420

enhancement of the ΔJF50_12610 tomogram was done using the tom_deconv

421

deconvolution filter (https://github.com/dtegunov/tom_deconv).

423

Macrophage Cell Culture

424

To test the effect of P. luteoviolacea MACs on eukaryotic cells, we tested their effect on

425

murine macrophages J774A.1. Macrophage cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's

426

Modified Eagle's Medium, Gibco #10566-016), which was prepared with the addition of

427

10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% sodium pyruvate. Frozen cell

428

line stocks were taken from nitrogen tank and thawed quickly at 37°C in a water bath.

429

Thawed cells (~1mL) were added to a 50mL conical centrifuge tube containing 5mL of

430

pre-warmed DMEM. Cells were then centrifuged at 500 g at room temperature for 4

431

minutes. The supernatant was carefully discarded, and cells were resuspended in

432

7.5mL of pre-warmed DMEM. This step assured complete removal of DMSO from

433

frozen cell stocks. Resuspended cells were transferred from the 50mL conical

434

centrifuge tube into a 25cm2 tissue culture flask and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

435

Cell lines were maintained by passaging every 2-3 days using routine cell culture

436

techniques.

437
438

Macrophage Cell Co-incubation with MACs and LDH Assay

439

Prior to exposure to MACs, J774A.1 cells were passaged two to five times and seeded

440

into 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 4x105 cells/mL the night before the

441

treatment. MACs that were extracted no more than a week prior to cell treatment were

442

added to each well of the 24-well plates with cells at a 1:50 ratio (10µL of the extracts

443

into 500µl of cells). Treated cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. Culture

444

supernatants were collected at between 1 and 24 hours post-infection. At each time

445

point, the plate was first spun down at 400 g for 2 minutes, then 100µL of the

446

supernatant was transferred into a 96-well plate in duplicate. For t=0 time point,

447

remaining supernatants were removed and cells were lysed with PBS+ 1% tritonX. 100

448

µL of the cell lysates was also transferred to 96-well plates. Microscopic images were

449

taken of each well to visualize and record the cells viability, using a phase-contrast

450

microscopy.

451
452

To assess cell lysis, we quantified the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) using

453

Takara LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401). The LDH reaction mix was made per

454

manufacturer's instructions and kept away from the light. Cell supernatants were diluted

455

1:10 in PBS and diluted supernatants were mixed 1:1 with the LDH reaction mix. After

456

the addition of the reaction mix, plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room

457

temperature away from the light and absorbance was measured at 492nm using a plate

458

reader. Total LDH level at t=0 was calculated by adding LDH levels of t=0 supernatants

459

and lysates. LDH release 24 hours post-treatment was calculated as a fraction of total

460

LDH available at the time of infection (t=0).
