Platinum and palladium are much sought-after metals of global critical importance in terms
of abundance and availability. At the nano-scale these metals are of even higher value due to
their catalytic abilities for industrial applications. Desulfovibrio alaskensis is able to capture
ionic forms of both of these metals, reduce them, and synthesize elemental nanoparticles.
Despite this ability very little is known about the biological pathways involved in the
formation of these nanoparticles. Proteomic analysis of D. alaskensis in response to platinum
and palladium has highlighted those proteins involved in both the reductive pathways and the
wider stress-response system. A core set of 13 proteins was found in both treatments and
consisted of proteins involved in metal transport and reduction. There were also 7 proteins
specific to either platinum or palladium. Over-expression of one of these platinum-specific
genes, a NiFe hydrogenase small subunit (Dde_2137), resulted in the formation of larger
nanoparticles. This study improves our understanding of the pathways involved in the metal
resistance mechanism of Desulfovibrio and informs how we can tailor the bacterium for
nanoparticle production, enhancing its application as a bioremediation tool and as way to
capture contaminant metals from the environment.

Bacteria, in particularly D. alaskensis, represent a biological and greener way to capture high
value metals such as platinum group metals from environmental and industrial waste streams.
The recovery of these metals in nanoparticle forms adds extra value to this process as they
can be used in a variety of different industrial applications as they have exceptional catalytic
capabilities. D. alaskensis ability to do this, has been widely reported, though very little is
understood about the underlying protein and genetic components. It is by understanding the
biological basis of this capability that we can further improve and adapt this bacterium to be
better at bioremediation and to control its ability to do so.

There is an increasing demand for expensive platinum group metals. Amongst other
applications, they are used for automotive catalytic converters from which platinum and
palladium escape via the exhaust and are therefore a source of environmental pollution (1).
Although heavy metal ions are toxic to most bacteria, highly-resistant strains are available
that absorb them and reduce them to the metallic state. This results in the formation of
nanoparticles that can be harvested to provide a source of these valuable metals.
Furthermore, small nanoparticles from bacteria have important biotechnological applications,
for example, as chemical catalysts. Not only does biological recovery from environmental
sources offer an attractive way to recover them from dilute solutions, but also it provides a
mechanism for decontaminating polluted environments. Prokaryotes have been used to
remediate metal ions from solution for decades: mostly high value metals such as gold,
platinum and silver have been targeted (2, 3).

The potential uses of nanoparticles are expanding, from cancer treatment using platinum or
arsenic nanoparticles (4, 5) to the use of silver nanoparticles as antimicrobials (6), palladium
nanoparticles as catalysts in fuel cells (7) and to treat water contaminated with
pharmaceuticals (8). Tailoring these nanoparticles to their implementation for industrial or
medical use is vital but so far there has been little standardisation with regards to the size of
nanoparticles formed (9). As different sized nanoparticles have different catalytic properties,
their use has been limited. Bacteria potentially represent a genetically programmable method
for the customisation of nanoparticle size and morphology for specific purposes. As well as
this bioremediation by bacteria involves mild conditions and ambient temperatures, thus
avoiding the disadvantages of chemical recovery that requires the use of high temperatures or
hazardous chemicals.

Anaerobic, sulphate reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfovibrio are amongst the most
widely used bacteria to remediate metal ions. They reduce multi-valent metal ions to zerovalent or bi-elemental nanoparticles. The list of known metals that it can process is ever
increasing and currently consists of chromium, magnesium, iron, technetium, uranium, nickel
(10-15), and also includes platinum and palladium: palladium has been the most studied. The
Desulfovibrio sp. are ideally suited for further analysis as they are already highly tolerant to
platinum and palladium ions, and can survive up to 2 and 5 mM respectively (15). They
reduce these metals at incredible speed, with up to 100% of Pd2+ being converted to Pd(0)
within 5 minutes (7).

Only fragmentary information is available at the genetic level concerning Desulfovibrio
genes required for heavy metal ion reduction. One exception is cycA from D. vulgaris
Hildenborough, which encodes a tetraheme cytochrome c3 involved in uranium reduction in
vitro (16). The NiFe hydrogenases of D. fructosovorans have been shown to be involved in
technetium reduction (17). They similarly have a role, along with a Fe-containing
hydrogenase, in Pd(0) deposition and clustering in both the periplasm (18) and on cellular
membranes (19), while more recently have been implicated in having a roll in palladium
deposition in Shewanella (20). While important for the anaerobic reduction of palladium by
Desulfovibrio sp., they are not required for the aerobic reduction of palladium by E. coli (21).
Large gaps remain in our knowledge of the proteins involved in metal ion reduction. As the
particles formed differ between growing and non-growing cultures, in many previous studies
washed bacteria were incubated in the presence of the target metal in buffer rather than in
substrates required for growth. We therefore designed experiments to identify changes in the
proteome of D. alaskensis strain G20 during incubation with Pt4+ or Pd2+ solutions under
conditions used in previous studies both by ourselves and many other research teams. One of

the genes implicated in Pt4+ reduction was cloned into an expression vector in a proof of
principle experiment designed to demonstrate that over-production of the gene product results
in changes in the physical properties of the nanoparticles formed.

Experimental Details
Growth of bacterial strains. D. alaskensis G20 was purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) and grown in Postgate Medium C
(PGMC) using lactate as a carbon source (22). Cultures were grown and manipulated in an
anaerobic chamber (Don Whitley) at 30°C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2, 10% H2 in N2. For
strains carrying the pMO9075 plasmid the medium was supplemented with 100 µg/ml
spectinomycin (Cambridge Bioscience).

Platinum and palladium treatment. Bacteria were grown in Postgate Medium C to an
OD600 of 1.0 and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The cell pellets were washed three
times in 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) and re-suspended finally in MOPS. Solutions of PtCl4 or
Na2PdCl4 were then added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The cells in the presence of
palladium and platinum and an unsupplemented control suspension were incubated
anaerobically at 30°C. After 2 h, samples were centrifuged as before and the supernatant was
removed. The pellets were either snap-frozen and stored at -80°C or used immediately for
TEM analysis.

Proteomics analysis: trypsin digestion, LC-MS and data analysis. Cells were disrupted in
8 M urea and the total protein was assayed using a Bradford kit (Biorad, UK). One milligram
of protein per sample was digested with trypsin as described previously (23). Briefly, samples
were diluted to a final concentration of 2 M urea with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 5
mM DTT. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, iodoacetamide was added to a
final concentration of 12.5 mM. Trypsin (10 µg; Worthington) was added and the sample
was digested overnight at room temperature. The samples were cleaned with 25 mg of Bond
Elut LMS (Agilent Technologies). Peptides eluted with acetonitrile were aliquoted, dried
under low pressure and stored at -20°C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, 4 µg of the
samples were reconstituted in 12 µl of loading buffer (0.05% Trifluoroacetic acid in water)
and analysed by capillary-HPLC-MS/MS on an on-line system consisting of a 1200 binary
HPLC micro-pump system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap XL
instrument (Thermo-Fisher) on a 140 minute gradient.

MS/MS data were analysed using MASCOT Versions 2.4 (Matrix Science Ltd, UK) against
the 3258 sequences in the D. alaskensis G20 genome from
http://genome.ornl.gov/microbial/ddes (24). The Mascot search parameters were two
missed-cut. Allowances were made for variable methionine oxidation and fixed cysteine
carbamidomethylation in all searches. The precursor mass tolerance was fixed at 7 ppm and
MS/MS tolerance to 0.4 amu. The significance threshold was set at 0.05 and an additional cut
off peptide score of 20. Progenesis (Nonlinear Dynamics, UK) was used for label-free
quantitation. Only peptides that were not shared between different proteins were used for
quantification. Data for a sub-set of MS/MS peaks with positive charges of 2, 3, or 4 were
extracted from each LC-MS run and the median global ion intensities were extracted for
normalization. The abundance of each protein was calculated from the sum of the intensities
of unique peptides with positive charges of 2, 3, or 4. Because the method of detection can
generate a significant amount of near zero measurements for which a standard log
transformation is not ideal, the calculated protein abundances were transformed using an
ArcSinH function. The within group means were calculated to evaluate the fold change and

the ArcSinH transformed data were then used to calculate the p-values using one-way
ANOVA. Proteins were considered to be differentially expressed only if at least two peptides
were detected with an absolute ratio of at least 1.5-fold more abundant or 0.667 less abundant
and a probability of false discovery of p<0.05, as illustrated in Figure 1. The mass
spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via
the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD004457 and
10.6019/PXD004457 (25). The data are also available in the supplemental material.
Functions of the proteins highlighted in this study were predicted using a combination of
literature searches and cross-referencing with the KEGG
(http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg2.html), STRING (http://string-db.org/), Pfam
(http://pfam.xfam.org/) and UniProt databases (http://www.uniprot.org/). The presence of
platinum group metals in RNA preparations prevented us from using Quantitative Real-Time
PCR to confirm at the transcription level changes in expression of genes for the proteins
highlighted.

Construction of pMO-2137. The gene for the Dde_2137 subunit of the nickel-iron
hydrogenase was cloned using a standard Phusion PCR protocol into the expression vector
pMO9075 (26).Forward and reverse primers were dde_2137F 5’CAGTACTCTGCAGATCTGATCCTTTCATTGC-3’ and dde_2137R 5’TGCATGCCAATTCGTTTCGGTACCGGC-3’. Restrictions sites for ScaI and SphI are
underlined. The PCR product was digested with ScaI and SphI and ligated into pMO9075
using these restriction sites. The sequence was inserted downstream of the promoter of the
kanamycin resistance gene in pMO9075, the expression from which has been shown to
complement mutations in Desulfovibrio sp.

The pMO-2137 and empty pMO9075 plasmids were transformed into D. alaskensis made
competent using an adaptation of Li and Krumholz’s method (27). Briefly, cultures at an
OD600nm of 0.6-0.8 were centrifuged, washed twice in 400 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2, and
finally resuspended in 1/10 of the original volume of sucrose solution. One microgram of the
plasmid was then added. After 30 min on ice, the suspension was electroporated at 1.5 kV.
After electroporation 1 ml of PGMC broth was added immediately to allow the cells to
recover at 30°C. After 4 hours, cells were plated onto PGMC agar containing 100 µg/ml of
spectinomycin. After 7 days at 30°C, transformants were purified and screened by plasmid
isolation for the presence of the construct. For comparative analysis of nanoparticles
produced by bacteria transformed with either the empty plasmid control or the plasmid
carrying the extra copy of the dde_2137 gene, the OD600nm of the cells were matched before
the addition of platinum ions.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Samples were drop cast onto a 200 mesh
copper grid with a formvar coating (TAAB). The sample was allowed to settle for 5
minutes before excess liquid was removed using filter paper. The grid was then loaded
into a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus electron microscope and imaged using a GATAN
OneView Camera. The images were processed and the size of the nanoparticles was
determined using ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

Using a significance threshold of 1.5-fold change and a p-value below 0.05, the abundance of
46 proteins decreased during incubation in the presence of palladium and platinum ions of
which 24 were in the platinum dataset, 22 were in the palladium dataset, with 20 proteins
found in both datasets (Figure 1). Only 20 proteins were found to be more abundant in cells
treated with palladium compared with untreated cells. Similarly, 20 proteins were also more
abundant in cells treated with platinum, thirteen of which were also induced during
incubation with palladium ions. Consequently, 7 of the more abundant proteins were unique
to each dataset (Figure 2).

Transfer of a bacterial culture from a growth medium into buffer containing toxic
levels of a heavy metal results in an almost total cessation of growth. Amongst many
other consequences, this results in ribosome degradation and therefore decreased
demand for stable RNA and ribosomal proteins (Table 1). The degradation products
can then be recycled for the synthesis of components beneficial to the stress response.
Conversely, incubation in a buffer in the absence of growth nutrients inevitably limits the
ability of bacteria to respond to stress. Any increased protein synthesis is therefore likely to
be limited to synthesis of those proteins that increase survival of the stress imposed. These
were expected to be proteins involved in the reduction of the specific metal ions, in
transporting them out of the cell, or in a more general response to stress. A total of 1061
proteins from the D. alaskensis G20 potential proteome were identified by shotgun label-free
proteomics, representing 32% of the global proteome (See supplemental material for
complete list). In terms of coverage this is in with good keeping with other proteomic studies
with metal trails in bacteria, including those of Desulfovibrio sp. (28, 29).

Proteins less abundant in both the platinum and palladium datasets.
As expected, proteins found in lower amounts in both datasets are predominantly those
involved in RNA transcription and translation. These include both large and small
ribosomal subunit proteins (L32, L29, S187, S12) as well as transcription regulators of
the TraR/DskA and MucR families (Table 2). One hypothetical protein identified
(Dde_0492) is also predicted to be involved in valyl-tRNA synthesis while another
(Dde_1811), of unknown function, is only conserved among the Desulfovibrio sp. and
SRB deltaproteobacteria. The least abundant protein relative to the control was the
periplasmic Fe hydrogenase small subunit (Dde_2280), which together with Dde_2274
are potential hydrogenases not involved in the reduction of either platinum or
palladium. This suggests that there might be a separate hydrogenase and other electron
transfer proteins that are specific for platinum and palladium reduction. Also in the
less-abundant dataset are proteins involved in energy production and metabolism such
as oxidoreductases (Dde_0584, Dde_1113, Dde_3240, Dde_2272 and Dde_1638), one
ATPase subunit (Dde_0990) and the prokaryotic molybdopterin-containing
oxidoreductase (Dde_2274).
Platinum specific proteins. Proteins involved in cell integrity and maintenance as well
as those required for growth dominated the list that were less abundant following
incubation with Pt4+ ions. Proteins such as Dde_1413, Dde_0453, Dde_1368,
Dde_2153, Dde_3632, Dde_1689 and Dde_1131 are predicted to be involved in
membrane biogenesis and integrity, which is consistent with decreased synthesis of
new membranes due to cessation of growth. This list also includes other proteins with
a common role: Dde_3488, Dde_3490, Dde_3567, Dde_2763, Dde_3070, Dde_3703 and
Dde_2744 are all predicted to be involved in amino acid synthesis. Again this supports that

due to the limited media in which the NPs are produced (MOPS, (3-(Nmorpholino)propanesulfonic acid) buffer) there is limited new synthesis of new proteins.
Other less abundant proteins Dde_2018, Dde_0445, Dde_2669 and Dde_2670 are required
for iron or haem uptake, possibly as a risk reduction strategy due to their general metal
binding and transportation ability.

Palladium specific proteins. The palladium dataset is dominated by ribosomal subunit
proteins both small (Dde_2233, Dde_2608, Dde_2253, Dde_2232, Dde_1133) and
large (Dde_2637, Dde_1095, Dde_2254, Dde_2607, Dde_2255). There are also other
proteins involved in transcription and translation such as the rRNA E-loop binding
protein (Dde_2127), the response regulator and CheY-like protein (Dde_0327), the
translation initiation factor (Dde_3162) and the MucR transcriptional regulator
(Dde_0346). Decreased levels of these proteins would have a global effect on
transcription and translation and silencing their expression would arrest the cell cycle.
The next largest group that are less abundant specifically in Pd2+-treated bacteria are
proteins required to provide metabolites for energy production and growth. The
proteins Dde_1111 to 1114 (with Dde_1113 found down regulated following both
platinum and palladium specific treatment) are products of a group of contiguous
genes encoding part of the membrane bound Qmo electron transport complex. The
operon is vital to the growth of D. vulgaris Hildenborough on lactate-sulphate media
(26, 30). Down-regulation of this operon, would make sense as the cells have gone
from a lactate-sulphate containing growth medium to a very minimal one.

Three of the proteins of increased abundance in both datasets included a ferredoxin and a
molybdoprotein, MopB, encoded by adjacent genes on the chromosome, and the rhodanese
Dde_0806. Evidence that these proteins are required for metal ion reduction includes a
report that a mopB mutant is unable to grow with hydrogen or formate as the electron donor
(31), and that a rhodanese mutant is also unable to use hydrogen as an electron donor (32).
More recently it was shown that molybdoproteins are required for Pd4+ reduction by E. coli
(21).

Five other proteins encode putative ABC-type transportation proteins, Dde_0155, Dde_0186,
Dde_0258, and an efflux pump, Dde_3627 and Dde_1010, which potentially encodes an
outer membrane porin. Also in this group is a member of the TolC family of type I secretion
systems (Dde_1415) (Table 1). The remaining five proteins common to both datasets all
play more general roles in the response to stress. They include Dde_0194, which is an
alpha-beta barrel protein, and Dde_1442, an ATP-dependent peptidase likely to be
involved in the degradation of proteins that have misfolded due to the presence of the
heavy metals (33). Also in this group is Dde_3216, a protein predicted to be involved
in lipid metabolism and repair: such proteins would have a role in managing the
effects heavy metals or nanoparticles have on lipid membranes. Lipid peroxidation in
particular is one of the ways in which bacterial treatment with TiO2 nanoparticles (33)
and copper ions/nanoparticles act as antimicrobials (34). Finally Dde_2342 is
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which understandably would play a
critical role in glycolysis as the cells metabolise endogenous reserves for ATP
production.

the NiFe hydrogenase, and Dde_2138, which a c3-type cytochrome that is believed to
donate electrons to the NiFe hydrogenase active site. The NiFe hydrogenase subunit is
transported into the periplasm by the twin arginine targeting TAT pathway. Both of
these proteins were shown to be required for metal ion reduction by D. fructosovorans
(17). The NiFe hydrogenase genes are flanked by two genes encoding the large and
small subunits of an alternative NiFeSe hydrogenase and maturation proteins, but none
of these other proteins were more abundant following incubation with Pt4+. Another
ferredoxin, Dde_2642, also accumulated during incubation with Pt4+ ions. This
protein is thought to be involved in metal-binding and electron transfer in the
cytoplasm. Whether it is able to shuttle electrons to the platinum ions in Desulfovibrio
is unknown.

291
292

An outer membrane efflux protein, Dde_3267, accumulated only in the platinumtreated bacteria. This could be involved either in the export of platinum ions out of the
cell to limit their cytotoxic effect, or even in the efflux of the nanoparticle itself once it
has been formed.

The ability of platinum ions to cause DNA lesions that inhibit cell division is the basis for
their chemotherapeutic use in drugs such as cisplatin. The single strand binding (SSB) protein
(Dde_1545) accumulated in bacteria incubated with Pt4+ ions (35). Binding of Pt is
prevented by the binding of SSB to single stranded DNA. Two other potential stress
response proteins accumulated during incubation with Pt4+ ions. One was rubrerythrin
(Dde_1214) that due to its ability to protect D. vulgaris against hydrogen peroxide damage is
suggested to protect against cytoplasmic oxidative stress (36, 37), it was also previously
found to be down-regulated when using nitrate as electron acceptor (38). The other is a
methyl-accepting chemotaxis sensory transducer (Dde_1279), which contains a PAS domain
at the conserved-C-terminus that is likely to be part of a signal response to promote motility
in the presence of platinum.

Proteins accumulated only in response to exposure to Pd2+ ions.
No obvious candidates for redox proteins required for Pd2+ reduction accumulated
specifically in response to incubation with Pd2+ ions. Although carbon monoxide reductase
(Dde_3028), the hybrid cluster protein (Hcp) (Dde_2640) and a quinone-linked NAD(P)H
dehydrogenase (Dde_1618) were more abundant than in the control, these increases were just
over 1.5-fold. The Hcp in particular has been implicated in response to nitric oxide stress in
both D. vulgaris (39) and E. coli (40). The four other proteins that increased significantly
included a peptidase that might be involved in a stress response, but again the increases
relative to the control were only about two-fold. The Dde_2200 protein is a 1-deoxy-Dxylulose-5-phosphate synthase involved in the metabolism of pyruvate, a key intermediate in
various metabolic pathways. Since the cells are in buffer (with palladium), it is likely that this
would increase metabolism of what little pyruvate is available. Similarly Dde_1699 and
Dde_0444, both of which are zinc-containing peptidases, are also present and are likely to be
degrading proteins that have misfolded due to the presence of the palladium/oxidative stress
involved in metal reduction (41). Clearly, however, most of the proteins induced in response
to exposure to Pd2+ were those also induced in the presence of Pt4+ ions.

Increase in nanoparticle sizes due to increased synthesis of the NiFe hydrogenase.
A major aim of the proteomics experiments was to investigate whether proteins could be
identified that when over-expressed might facilitate the controlled production of metal
nanoparticles of a specific size. Given the previous demonstration that a mutant defective in
NiFe hydrogenase synthesis was also defective in nanoparticle production, the observation
that this enzyme accumulated during Pt4+ reduction was especially significant. We therefore

designed experiments to determine whether over-expression of the NiFe hydrogenase would
result in changes in the physical properties of the nanoparticles formed. The gene encoding
the NiFe hydrogenase protein Dde_2137 was cloned into the D. alaskensis plasmid
pMO9075 to give pMO-2137. Introduction of this plasmid to D. alaskensis G20
significantly increased the size of the Pt nanoparticles when cells were exposed to
platinum ions (p<<0.005) (Figure 4). On average the size increased from 117 nmfor
the empty plasmid control to 324 nm for the strain carrying the pMO-2137. Increased
production of the NiFe protein also increased the range of nanoparticle sizes formed
(Figure 5 and Figure 6). Many of the larger particles were free in the buffer, not
attached to the cell. Though larger nanoparticles were formed, the transformants were
not more resistant to platinum treatment. We therefore suggest that the increased amount
of Dde_2137 leads to increased deposition of platinum nanoparticles on the cell
surface. This leads to an increased deposition rates and, in turn, an increased localised
turnover rate of the platinum ions by the autocatalytic abilities of the platinum
nanoparticles thus leading overall to larger nanoparticles. This supports previous work
which concluded that the NiFe hydrogenase is required for nanoparticle synthesis in
Desulfovibrio (18) and also their deposition on the outer membranes in Shewanella
(20). Samples of nanoparticles produced by Desulfovibrio transformed with either
pMO-2137 or the empty vctor control were analysed using EDS (Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy). In both cases the nanoparticles were shown to be entirely made of
platinum with some regions containing very regular atomic lattices (Figure 7).

Conclusions
Despite years of use of D. alaskensis for metal ion bioremediation, this paper to our
knowledge presents the first shotgun proteomic analysis of bacteria synthesizing palladium
and platinum nanoparticles. Although various strains of Desulfovibrio were used for these
previous studies, only a few of the proteins reported here have previously been implicated in
metal reduction and nanoparticle production.

We have identified some proteins that accumulate during both palladium or platinum
reduction and others that respond to one of the metals, but not the other. This implies that
there are separate pathways for reduction of each metal, but also an underlying core pathway
that features in the reduction of both. One possible reason for this is that Pt4+ ions are reduced
via Pt2+ and that the divalent Pd2+ and Pt2+ cations are reduced by a common pathway.
Identification of both groups of these proteins presents the opportunity not only of increasing
the removal of metals from platinum and palladium-containing solutions, but also for
increasing the specificity of the process. Genetic manipulation to control the expression of
the genes for these target proteins might enable increase metal specificity, efficiency and
even metal resistance to be achieved. In proof of principle experiments to test these ideas, we
have also shown the feasibility of genetically engineering D. alaskensis to alter nanoparticle
sizes. One aim of future work will be to develop the ability to produce nanoparticles tailored
for specific needs as well as the application of what we have engineered to environmental
samples.

Figure 1. Volcano plot for the data generated in the shotgun proteomics. Red full circles are
those proteins less abundant and green full circles are those that are more abundant, both of
which are greater than 0.05 probability. Grey circles are proteins that are not significantly
different across the three different datasets. Empty circles are those that are significant but are
represented by a single peptide only.

Figure 7. Samples of nanoparticles produced by D. alaskensis cells in the presence of
platinum. (A) Cells containing the empty plasmid pMO9075 and attributed EDS spectra
confirming the presence of only platinum, (B) cells containing the pMO-2137 plasmid
expressing the small NiFe subunit, as before, the associated EDS spectrum shows only the
presence of platinum. Note: the presence of nickel in the sample is due to the samples being
mounted on a nickel grid.
