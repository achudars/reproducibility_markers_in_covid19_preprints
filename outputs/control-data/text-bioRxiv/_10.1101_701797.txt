Running Title: Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
Abstract
We have characterized the structural determinants of phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN)
self-association using site-directed mutagenesis, SDS-PAGE, and fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) microscopy. PLB and SLN are single-pass transmembrane (TM) peptides that are
critically involved in regulation of contractility in cardiac and skeletal muscle via reversible inhibition of
calcium (Ca) transport by SERCA. PLB and SLN also exhibit ion channel activity in vitro, yet the
physiological significance of these functions is unknown. Here we have determined that structural insights
offered by the tetrameric PLB Cys41 to Leu (C41L) mutation, a mutant with four possible
leucine/isoleucine zipper interactions for stabilizing PLB tetramers. Using scanning alanine mutagenesis
and SDS-PAGE, we have determined the C41L-PLB tetramer is destabilized by mutation of Leu37 to Ala
(L37A) or Ile40 to Ala (I40A), which are the same a- and d-arm residues stabilizing the PLB pentamer via
leucine/isoleucine zippers, highlighting the importance of these two zippers in PLB higher-order
oligomerization. The new possible zipper arm in C41L-PLB (N34, C41L, I48) did not contribute to
tetramerization. On the other hand, we determined that tetramer conversion back to pentamer was
induced by alanine mutation of Ile48, a residue located on the e-arm below C41L, implicating steric
interaction and restriction are the stabilizing and destabilizing forces that control the distribution between
pentamer and tetramer populations. We propose that the e-arm and hydrophobic residues in the adjacent
b-arm act as secondary structural motifs that help control the stoichiometry of PLB oligomerization. FRET
microscopy and alanine mutagenesis of SLN residues Val14 (V14A) or Leu21 (L21A) decreased the
binding affinity of the SLN‒SLN complex, demonstrating the importance of each residue in mediating
self-association. Helical wheel analysis supports a heptad-repeat TM zipper mechanism of SLN
oligomerization, similar to the 3.5 residue/turn Leu and Ile zippers found in PLB pentamers. Collectively,
our studies add new insights on the conservation of homologous hydrophobic 3-4 pattern of residues in
zipper motifs that mediate PLB and SLN self-assembly. We propose that the importance of these apolar,
steric interactions in the TM domain are widespread in stabilizing higher-order oligomerization of
membrane proteins.

Introduction
Sarcolipin (SLN)1 and phospholamban (PLB) are two key proteins that regulate muscle and cardiac
contractility. Both SLN and PLB monomers have a primary regulatory function of inhibiting Ca (Ca)
transport of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-transporting ATPase (SERCA). SLN inhibits SERCA in fasttwitch skeletal and atrial muscle, while PLB inhibits SERCA in cardiac and slow-twitch muscle. Adrenaline
stimulation of these muscle results in phosphorylation of SLN and PLB, thereby reversing SERCA
inhibition and stimulating contractility, with ionotropic and lusitropic effects.
While the primary function of monomeric SLN and PLB is known, both proteins are also capable of
self-assembling into higher order oligomers. PLB avidly forms pentamers, and does so in dynamic
equilibrium with the monomeric population that actively inhibits SERCA (Wegener and Jones 1984,
Simmerman, Kobayashi et al. 1996, Autry and Jones 1997, Cornea, Jones et al. 1997, Kimura,
Kurzydlowski et al. 1997, Autry and Jones 1998, Cornea, Autry et al. 2000) Similarly, SLN forms
oligomers in detergent micelles, live cell ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membranes, and reconstituted
proteoliposomes and tubular lipid crystals (Hellstern, Pegoraro et al. 2001, Becucci, Guidelli et al. 2009,
Autry, Rubin et al. 2011, Cao, Wu et al. 2017).
The physiological function of oligomeric SLN and PLB remain unknown. It has proposed that higherorder oligomers act as a conglomerated pool of non-inhibitory PLB or SLN that exist in equilibrium with
monomers, which in the non-phosphorylated form actively inhibit SERCA (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011,
Shaikh, Sahoo et al. 2016), though the effect of phosphorylation on oligomerization remains unclear.
There is also a growing body of evidence that SLN and PLB oligomers possess channel activity. The
idea of this second function was proposed when purified PLB was added to lipid bilayers (Kovacs, Nelson
et al. 1988, Arkin, Adams et al. 1994, Arkin, Rothman et al. 1995, Oxenoid and Chou 2005, Becucci,
Cembran et al. 2009, Smeazzetto, Saponaro et al. 2013, Smeazzetto, Sacconi et al. 2014, Smeazzetto,
Tadini-Buoninsegni et al. 2016). PLB was reported to form channels through the bilayers, and the bilayers
were reported to be selective for cations (Ca or K+). Thus, it was proposed that either (i) PLB acts as a
Ca leak channel, acting to inhibit Ca reuptake by SERCA in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), (ii) adding
to Ca release from the SR, and/or (iii) providing K+ counter-cation flux to help neutralize the large electrogradient generated during Ca release. PLB expression in E. coli has also been reported to decrease cell
viability, presumably due to formation of pentameric Ca leak channels (Cook, Huggins et al. 1989). SLN
too shows ion channel activity. When reconstituted in lipid bilayers, SLN increases conductivity of small
inorganic anions such as chloride (Cl -), phosphate (Pi), and sulfate, and was proposed to serve as a
voltage-gated Pi channel (Becucci, Cembran et al. 2009, Becucci, Guidelli et al. 2009).
Structural investigation of the mechanics of PLB and SLN oligomerization has helped further elucidate
function. It has been demonstrated that one side of the PLB transmembrane (TM) domain contains
hydrophobic residues that form zippers in pentamer formation (Simmerman, Kobayashi et al. 1996,
Kimura, Kurzydlowski et al. 1997, Adams, Lee et al. 1998). Previous homology modelling has suggested
that like its cousin protein, SLN forms higher-order oligomers using leucine/isoleucine zippers. Helical

Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
wheel analysis and sequence comparison have indicated that position I17-SLN is analogous to the Ile40PLB zipper position, and indeed when Ile17 was mutated to Ala (I17A), the formation of higher-order
oligomers and self-association binding affinity were decreased (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011). Wild-type (WT)
SLN expression in the E. coli DH5α strain also reduces cell viability, as what had been previously
observed with PLB expression (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011). However, expression of the I17A mutant
restores bacterial cell viability, suggesting that the I17A mutation disrupts a leucine-isoleucine zipper that
stabilizes a toxic SLN ion channel in E. coli (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011). Residue-residue interactions in
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have also predicted leucine-isoleucine zippers in SLN dimerization
and pentamerization (Cao, Wu et al. 2016, Cao, Wu et al. 2016, Cao, Wu et al. 2017).
In recent studies, homology modelling and MD stimulations have been used to study a model of
pentameric SLN channel in membrane. Potential mean force (PMF) energy barrier values indicated
permeability of hydrated sodium (Na+) and Cl- ions through pentameric SLN. As the narrowest portion of
the pore and highest energy barrier for either Na+ or Cl- passage correlated with the hydrophobic L21
position, it was hypothesized this residue serves as the ion gate and that hydration expanded the pore
size sufficiently enough to allow ion passage—a “hydrophobic gate” (Cao, Wu et al. 2016, Cao, Wu et al.
2017). MD simulations also predicted that phosphorylated SLN pentamers (phospho-Thr5) have greater
ion permeability than non-phosphorylated SLN pentamers (Cao, Wu et al. 2016).
Much remains to be understood of the structural motifs for PLB and SLN oligomerization and the
functional characteristics of channel activity. Our FRET and SDS-PAGE results help define the TM
residue interactions and zipper mechanisms involved in SLN and PLB self-assembly. An improved
understanding of how PLB and SLN oligomers form and what regulates their assembly is crucial in
determining their physiological function.

with 30 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at pH 7.4 for 1 hr.
cDNA cloning, plasmid construction, and site-directed mutagenesis
SLN cDNA was cloned from rabbit fast-twitch muscle mRNA using reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011), finding a cDNA sequence that was the same as
previously described (Odermatt, Taschner et al. 1997). cDNA encoding CFP or YFP was then fused to
the N-terminus of SLN cDNA using a restriction enzyme/ligation strategy to generate CFP-SLN and YFPSLN cDNA (Winters, Autry et al. 2008, Autry, Rubin et al. 2011). To eliminate dimerization of CFP or
YFP, residue Ala206 was mutated to Lys (A206K) (Zacharias, Violin et al. 2002). Alanine mutagenesis
of SLN TM residues Val14 or Leu21 was used to create CFP-V14A-SLN or YFP-L21A-SLN.
Oligomerization assay of C41L-PLN tetramer mutants expressed in Sf21 insect cells
PLB cDNA was cloned from dog left ventricle using RT-PCR (Autry, Rubin et al. 2011), with a
sequence the same as previously reported (Fujii, Ueno et al. 1987). C41L mutagenesis was conducted
to generate a PLB sequence that forms predominantly tetramers on SDS-PAGE (Simmerman, Kobayashi
et al. 1996). Subsequent alanine scanning mutagenesis of TM domain residues L37, I38, L39, I40, L42,
and I48 to examine effect on oligomerization. The cDNA of the C41L-PLB mutant and each of its alanine
TM mutants were then expressed in Sf21 insect cells via baculovirus infection. SDS-PAGE was used to
analyze oligomerization of WT-PLB, C41L-PLB, and TM mutants of C41L-PLB, as expressed in Sf21
cells. Prior to electrophoresis, gel samples were solubilized in 1.0% SDS for 5 min at 23°C. Pre-cast 4‒
15% acrylamide Laemmli gels were run per manufacturer instructions (BioRad). Immunoblotting was
performed using anti-dog PLB mAb 2D12 and secondary antibody with chemiluminescence detection.
FRET assay of SLN fluorescent fusion proteins expressed in Sf21 insect cells
CFP-SLN, YFP-SLN, CFP-V14A-SLN, and YFP-L21A-SLN proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect
cells via recombinant baculovirus (Autry and Jones 1997, Autry and Jones 1998, Autry, Rubin et al.
2011). For FRET microscopy, 6.0 × 105 cells were infected in 60 mm2 glass-bottom dishes with a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 viruses/cell for the donor construct (CFP-based fusion protein) and 3
viruses/cell for the acceptor construct (YFP-based fusion protein). FRET was measured 48 hr postinfection, as described below (acceptor photobleaching and spectral unmixing).
FRET microscopy was used to assess interaction between CFP- and YFP-labeled SLN constructs.
The epifluorescence microscope, photobleaching protocol, and fluorescence quantification of CFP and
YFP fusion proteins were the same as previously described (Autry and Jones 1997, Autry and Jones
1998, Autry, Rubin et al. 2011). The Förster equation was used to calculate energy transfer efficiency:

significant given the position of Ile48 on the e-arm
below C41L in the proposed helical wheel model
(Figure 1B). We propose that introduction of the C41L mutation, via conversion from a polar to apolar
residue, provides increased hydrophobicity to an additional zipper arm (e-arm with C41L and Ile48) which
in addition to the native b-arm (Ile38, Ile45, Leu52) and a- and d-arms, totals four zipper arms to stabilize
tetramers (Figure 1B). While C41L may add hydrophobicity to strengthen e-arm zipper interactions, the
added bulk of the leucine residue likely provides a sterically counteractive force that destabilizes
pentamers. This is supported by the I48A mutation below C41L likely relieving this steric constraint and
thus allowing “native” hydrophobic zipper interactions—which we propose to include the same four arms
as the C41L tetramer—to again favor pentamer formation. Observation of these changes provide added
support for the helical wheel model, the proposed leucine/isoleucine zippers motifs (Figure 2), and the
importance of hydrophobic van der Waals forces in higher-order oligomer stabilization.

Mutagenesis and FRET microscopy identify zipper residues that mediate SLN self-association
In previous experiments, the baculovirus system was used to express SLN as a fusion protein with
green fluorescent protein derivatives tagged at the N-terminus—CFP-SLN and YFP-SLN (Autry et al
2011). As reported, confocal fluorescence microscopy indicated CFP-SLN and YFP-SLN are localized to
the ER when expressed in Sf21 insect cells, and fluorescence microscopy with acceptor-photobleaching
indicated a high degree of association between SLN molecules, i.e. that SLN self-associates in live cell
membranes. Corroborating this data in a different method of measurement, fluorescence spectroscopy

Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
of cell homogenates with detergent dissociation used to disrupt SLN-SLN interactions in isolated Sf21
microsomes demonstrated similar FRET efficiencies.
In this experiment, SLN mutants with alanine substitution to Val14 and to Leu21 were similarly fused
with green fluorescent protein derivatives tagged at the N-terminus (YFP-L21A and CFP-V14A),
expressed in Sf21 cells, and FRET microscopy conducted on the interactions between each of these
mutants with SLN following acceptor-photobleaching. Mean FRET was calculated and binding curves
generated using FRET vs acceptor expression (Figure 3A). The binding curve for interactions between
CFP-SLN and YFP-SLN from the previous experiment is displayed for comparison. Mean FRET between
CFP-V14A and YFP-SLN was 0.254 ± 0.009, a decrease of 0.084 ± 0.010 from that between CFP-SLN
and YFP-SLN, and Kd was 19.7 ± 1.2, a 2-fold reduction in binding affinity from a Kd of 8.07 ± 0.31
between CFP-SLN and YFP-SLN. This significant reduction in binding affinity indicates Val14 provides
important contribution to SLN self-binding affinity, and the decreased mean FRET that occurs with
disruption of this residue alone indicates SLN oligomerization may to some extent be dependent upon it.
Mean FRET for interactions between CFP-SLN and YFP-L21A was not different from interactions
between CFP-SLN and YFP-SLN, but Kd was 13.7 ± 0.8, thus also demonstrating a reduction in binding
affinity. Therefore, the L21 residue also plays an important role in stabilization of oligomer formation.
FRET analysis from our previous experiment demonstrated that mutation of the Ile17 residue,
mapped on the d-arm of a proposed 3.5 residue/turn helix model, similarly impairs FRET efficiency.
Adding V14 and L21 to this helical wheel analysis places them in the a-arm of this model (Figure 3B).
This adds to a growing body of hydrophobic residues identified as important in self-assembly, and which
we propose are stabilizing oligomers via leucine/isoleucine zippers on these two adjacent helical arms.

Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
Discussion
Novel structural insights into SLN and PLB self-assembly
In the present study, we investigated interactions of SLN and PLB, using a combination of cellular
and biochemical assays. Our results have provided several new insights into the structure and function
of these integral membrane proteins.
Results obtained using two heterologous in vivo systems—baculovirus and E. coli—indicate that SLN
assembles into oligomeric complexes like PLB. In addition to the I17 residue previously identified, our
FRET data has identified two additional hydrophobic TM residues, V14 and L21, which are important in
SLN higher-order oligomerization (Figure 3A). Placing these results in helical wheel analysis supports a
leucine/isoleucine zipper mechanism of oligomerization, with at least two zippers located on the a- and
d-arms of a repeating heptad coiled-coil helix (Figure 3B). These proposed SLN zippers bear striking
similarity to the two leucine/isoleucine zippers on the a- and d-arms of pentameric PLB, previously
identified via disruption of PLB pentamer on gel from mutation of L37, I40, L44, I47, L51 (Simmerman,
Kobayashi et al. 1996). Our SDS-PAGE gel results here have also identified a- and d-arm residues of a
PLB tetramer as necessary for stabilization as well as two other potential zippers on the c- and e-arms
(Figure 1, Figure 2). Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that cousin proteins SLN and
PLB share a conserved motif of hydrophobic leucine/isoleucine zippers stabilizing higher-order
oligomers.
The discovery here of a “steric switch” capable of converting between PLB tetramer and pentamer,
and an examination of the mechanics of how this switch impacts oligomeric order, further supports a
hydrophobic zipper mechanism of oligomerization centered on a- and d-arm interactions. Mutation of aand d-arm residues have the greatest evidence of disrupting higher-order oligomerization (Error!
Reference source not found.B, Error! Reference source not found.B) and thus may be the point of
strongest contact between monomeric units in higher-order oligomer formation. However, with an
increasing oligomer number—i.e., tetramer to pentamer—an increasing angle between monomeric units
would require a shift in monomeric contact toward the e-arm. Accordingly, the steric bulk introduced at
C41L on the e-arm likely provides a barrier to any expanding angle between monomers and restricts
C41L-PLB to a tetramer, with the tetramer further strengthened by zippers between the e-arm (mutant)
and b-arm (native). Interestingly, a hexameric form of PLN has been observed with N34A mutation—a
residue also lying on the e-arm (Simmerman, Kobayashi et al. 1996). With reduction of steric bulk on the
e-arm from this mutation, hydrophobic zipper interactions may be able to maintain a greater angle
between monomers, resulting in the preponderance of hexamers rather than pentamers. Taken together,
these examples demonstrate the e-arm of PLB as an important “steric switch” position and corroborates
the hydrophobic zipper model of oligomerization (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4).
Notably, previous experiments which truncated the polar upper-TM region of an engineered, watersoluble form of PLB found that this also served as a switch from pentamer to tetramer, which could
suggest a greater role for polar forces in higher-order PLB oligomerization (Slovic, Lear et al. 2005).
However, emerging research has also continued to demonstrate the prominent role of van der Waal
forces in stabilizing peptide oligomers and an engineered PLB-like molecule devoid of strongly polar
residues has even been shown to easily stabilize as a pentamer (Mravic, Thomaston et al. 2019), which
we suggest is secondary to hydrophobic zipper interactions. The evidence presented here show PLB and
SLN as examples supporting the prominent role of hydrophobic interactions in small peptide
oligomerization as well as determination of oligomer order.
Proposed hypothesis on PLB and SLN pore size and channel activity
With SLN known to increase conductance in membranes (Becucci, Cembran et al. 2009, Becucci,
Guidelli et al. 2009), and with recent molecular dynamic simulations demonstrating the SLN pentamer as
capable of small ion transport (Cao, Wu et al. 2016, Cao, Wu et al. 2017), this adds to a growing body of

Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
evidence of SLN oligomers having ion channel capacity. Given an anionic conductance in membranes,
we predict that SLN forms Pi or Cl- channels. A modest population of SLN Pi channels, especially upon
phosphorylation, may be physiologic in design to allow for a controlled amount of Pi import and Ca
precipitation in muscle SR. Cl- currents have also been measured in the SR (Tanifuji, Sokabe et al. 1987,
Rousseau 1989), though no Cl- channel yet identified. Interestingly, an anti-PLB antibody has been
observed to halt Cl- current across vesicles from the SR (Decrouy, Juteau et al. 1996), though it is possible
the antibody was cross-reacting with SLN channels.
Do PLB or SLN act as a hexameric or higher-order oligomeric ion channel?
While there is growing evidence that PLB can acts as a cation channel, PLB pentamers are predicted
to have too narrow of a pore to conduct hydrated Ca (Arkin, Rothman et al. 1995). We have demonstrated
that WT-PLB can form hexamers in on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A, lane 1), along with additional higherorder oligomers (Supplementary Figure S1). Given that current structural models indicated that PLB
pentamers are likely too narrow to form channels for hydrated Ca ions; we predict that higher-order
oligomers of PLB, such as hexamers or larger, are capable of pore formation (Figure 2, Figure 4). As
noted previously, the N34A mutant of PLB also forms a high-order oligomer on SDS-PAGE (probably
hexamer), with alanine mutation at this cleft position (e-arm) facilitating formation by alleviating steric
hindrance (Simmerman, Kobayashi et al. 1996). Ultracentrifugation and cross-linking have also detected
PLB hexamers and decamers in detergent (Vorherr, Wrzosek et al. 1993, Hellstern, Pegoraro et al. 2001),
while FRET has detected a significant fraction of higher-order PLB oligomers with 10‒12 subunits when
reconstituted in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers (Reddy, Jones et al. 1999). Much focus and
study has been on the PLB pentamer given its preponderance in SDS-PAGE assays. However, it is
possible that the presence of SDS does not favor formation of high-order oligomers of PLB. we
demonstrate greater temperature alone has the capacity to reduce the hexamer population to
undetectable, while the pentameric population remains (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, PLB
hexamers and species with a greater number of subunits may well exist SR membranes in greater
populaiton than previously appreciated.
There is an increasing number of protein channels built from TM helices proving to demonstrate a
fluid rather than set oligomerization number in membranes, with some proposed capable of spanning up
to a dodecameric order (Saravanan and Bhattacharjya 2011, Bortolus, De Zotti et al. 2013, Serban, Breen
et al. 2018). Similarly, hexameric and a spectrum of greater order PLB channel-forming oligomers may
well be in an equilibrium with lower-order oligomers, resulting in a modest population of PLB Ca channels
that may be physiologic in design to allow for controlled flux of Ca or K ions across the SR membrane.
Given the demonstrated range of PLB higher-order oligomers and the facility with which steric alterations
can tune zipper interactions and control oligomer order (Figure 1A), this fluid rather than static model of
channel oligomer model is conceivable.
Given homologous structure and function, we hypothesize SLN is also capable of forming hexameric
and higher-order oligomeric channels. SLN has been shown to be capable of hexamer formation from
ultracentrifugation (Hellstern, Pegoraro et al. 2001), though further evidence is needed on the capacity
of SLN for higher-order oligomerization. Though we favor a hexameric or greater oligomer number for
SLN acting as a Pi selective-channel, yet a Cl- selective-channel of SLN with a lower stoichiometry is also
conceivable given the smaller anion size.
Role of PLB pentamer
If hexamer and greater order PLB oligomers are required to form calcium channels, what is the
physiologic role of pentameric PLB; the oligomeric species with the greatest preponderance on gels and
most studied? There are number of studies providing evidence that PLB pentamers regulate SERCA,
including a crystal structure of SERCA interaction with PLB pentamer and a demonstration that SERCA
Vmax is increased with a higher concentration of PLN pentamer (Reddy, Cornea et al. 2003, Trieber,

Structural determinants of SLN and PLB self-association
Douglas et al. 2005, Stokes, Pomfret et al. 2006, Glaves, Primeau et al. 2019). The Young group
proposes that the PLN pentamer sits at the calcium entry funnel of SERCA when bound and its basic
residues may thus perturb the surrounding lipid bilayer, resulting in greater mobility of SERCA catalytic
pumps and an increased turnover capacity (Glaves, Primeau et al. 2019). Evidence suggesting functions
of the PLB pentamer beyond direct regulation of SERCA have also been brought forth, such as its
capacity to attenuate PKA to delay the phosphorylation of the PLB monomer (Wittmann, Lohse et al.
2015).
Interestingly, there is also a growing body of evidence on the presence of “chansporters”— complexes
between two structurally unrelated but interacting channel and transporter proteins—throughout various
different physiologic systems in the body. The neuronal Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channel, for example, has
been found capable of interacting with two different sodium-coupled neurotransmitter transporters, where
the potassium channel may be enhancing sodium transport while reducing the depolarization effect from
sodium influx (Bartolomé-Martín, Ibáñez et al. 2019). In this context and with the evidence above, it
becomes quite conceivable that PLB and SLN pentamers may interact with SERCA in chansporter-like
complexes in order to modulate Ca influx into the SR.
The standing paradigm of PLB and SLN self-assembly equilibrium has long been that PLB/SLN
monomers inhibit SERCA, which can pentamerize to becomes inactive. While oligomerization may in part
serve a storage function for monomers, we believe self-assembly equilibrium is likely far more complex,
with a fluid range of oligomer order possible including pentamers, hexamers, and greater, and where
these oligomer species carry multiple important functions including SERCA regulation and ion channel
activity.
Proposed physiological function of PLB and SLN channels and medical relevance
We propose a physiologic model whereby PLB and SLN oligomeric channels serve as regulatory
mechanisms of muscle contraction. Given ion concentrations in the cell, we predict that a Ca-leak PLB
channel would inhibit muscle contraction, while a Pi uptake SLN channel would activate contraction. A
PLB Ca-leak channel would be conceivable as a mechanism to quickly remove Ca to improve cycling
during rapid contraction. A mechanism by which SLN Pi uptake channels activate muscle contraction or
improve contractility is also conceivable. Inorganic Pi levels can increase to >30 mM in contracting muscle
cells, and this Pi enters the SR to form dissolvable Ca-Pi precipitates to assist calsequestrin with Ca
storage (Dutka, Cole et al. 2005). High concentrations of inorganic Pi also inhibit myosin (Debold, Walcott
et al. 2013). Pi uptake channels may thus provide a regulated mechanism of increasing Pi in the SR
lumen during contraction that can help store Ca to increase contractility or maintain contractility in
fatiguing muscle, while ATP is preserved from reduced Ca release and inhibition of myosin (Debold,
Walcott et al. 2013). Pi uptake channels may thus provide a regulated mechanism of increasing Pi in the
SR during contraction that can help store Ca to increase contractility or maintain contractility in fatiguing
muscle, while ATP is preserved from reduced Ca release and inhibition of myosin.
The proposed roles of SLN and PLB channels in Ca cycling and muscle contractility would have
important medical relevance and implications in heart disease. Pathologic Ca leakage out of the SR has
been shown to lead to atrial fibrillation (Sood, Chelu et al. 2008, Shan, Xie et al. 2012) and inhibition of
this Ca leakage shown to correct arrhythmias (Mohamed, Hartmann et al. 2018). Thus a PLB channel
serving as a Ca leakage mechanism would have immediate relevance in pathophysiology or therapeutics.
It is also known that decreased SLN expression and enhanced SERCA expression are common in atrial
fibrillation, likely causing disruption of Ca cycling in and out of the SR (Shanmugam, Molina et al. 2011).
Might this be not only because of SLN’s absent inhibition of SERCA, but also because of the absence of
SLN Pi channels, diminishing the capacity of Ca storage in the SR in fatiguing muscle? Indeed, if PLB
and SLN channels are involved in the Ca cycling of the SR, then formation of these channels may be
directly involved in the pathophysiology of any number of other aberrant Ca cycling diseases, or if not
directly aberrant themselves may hold promise as therapeutic targets to reverse problems with other

two important regulatory proteins.
Summary
In this research, we have used cellular and biochemical assays to contribute new structural insights
to PLB and SLN self-oligomerization. Our studies have added to understanding of the hydrophobic TM
residues involved in PLB and SLN self-assembly, in particular demonstrating the conservation of
leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs between these cousin proteins and emphasizing the importance of
hydrophobic interactions in oligomerization. Adding observation of effects of PLB and SLN oligomers in
E. coli to a growing understanding of structure, known conductance capacities, and molecular
simulations, we have proposed that these oligomers can form ion channels that have a physiologic role
in muscle contraction regulation. Continued study of the structure and function of PLB and SLN oligomers
is needed to better elucidate their physiologic role, as this may have wide-ranging implications in Ca
cycling and play an important role in both pathophysiology and potential therapeutics in muscle and
cardiac diseases.
