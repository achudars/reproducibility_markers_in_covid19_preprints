Abstract

18

Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the

19

clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells. Though durable remissions are possible, MM is

20

considered incurable, with relapse occurring in almost all patients. There has been limited

21

data reported on the lipid metabolism changes in plasma cells during MM progression. Here,

22

we evaluated the feasibility of concurrent lipidomics and proteomics analyses from patient

23

plasma cells, and report these data on a limited number of patient samples, demonstrating the

24

feasibility of the method, and establishing hypotheses to be evaluated in the future.

25

Methods: Plasma cells were purified from fresh bone marrow aspirates using CD138

26

microbeads. Proteins and lipids were extracted using a bi-phasic solvent system with

27

methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and water. Untargeted proteomics, untargeted and targeted

28

lipidomics were performed on 7 patient samples using liquid chromatography-mass

29

spectrometry. Two comparisons were conducted: high versus low risk; relapse versus newly

30

diagnosed. Proteins and pathways enriched in the relapsed group was compared to a public

31

transcriptomic dataset from Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium reference collection

32

(n=222) at gene and pathways level.

33

Results: From one million purified plasma cells, we were able to extract material and

34

complete untargeted (~6000 and ~3600 features in positive and negative mode respectively)

35

and targeted lipidomics (313 lipids), as well as untargeted proteomics analysis (~4100

36

reviewed proteins). Comparative analyses revealed limited differences between high and low

37

risk groups (according to the standard clinical criteria), hence we focused on drawing

38

comparisons between the relapsed and newly diagnosed patients. Untargeted and targeted

39

lipidomics indicated significant down-regulation of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in relapsed

40

MM. Although there was limited overlap of the differential proteins/transcripts, 76

41

significantly enriched pathways in relapsed MM were common between proteomics and

42

transcriptomics data. Further evaluation of transcriptomics data for lipid metabolism network

43

revealed enriched correlation of PC, ceramide, cardiolipin, arachidonic acid and cholesterol

44

metabolism pathways to be exclusively correlated among relapsed but not in newly-

45

diagnosed patients.

46

Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and workflow to conduct integrated

47

lipidomics and proteomics analyses on patient-derived plasma cells. Potential lipid

48

metabolism changes associated with MM relapse warrant further investigation.

Introduction

53

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy characterized by plasma cell

54

infiltration of the bone marrow, and/or the presence of extramedullary plasmacytomas [2].

55

With an increasing number of treatment options available, median survival for MM has

56

improved, and now approaches six years [5]. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies and

57

an increasing number of pharmacological agents to choose from, MM eventually relapses for

58

the majority of patients, hence there is a need to understand the mechanisms of relapse and

59

identify potential new therapeutic approaches.

60

The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) for MM incorporates serum biomarkers

61

(lactate dehydrogenase, beta-2-microglobulin and albumin) and cytogenetic abnormalities of

62

known prognostic significance to predict disease behavior [4]. It is imprecise however, with

63

different patients in the same risk group exhibiting heterogeneous behavior and prognoses.

64

MM treatment strategies predominantly use regimens built around immunomodulatory drugs

65

such as thalidomide or its analogues, or proteasome inhibitors including bortezomib or

66

carfilzomib. These treatments may be followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. With

67

an increasing number of treatment options available, median survival has improved in the last

68

decade, now approaching six years [5], but despite these advances, myeloma eventually

69

relapses for the majority of patients.

70

Perturbations in lipid metabolism are emerging as potential drivers and therapeutic targets in

71

cancer development and progression [7]. This is of particular relevance because obesity is a

72

risk factor for a number of cancer types, including multiple myeloma (MM) [1]. A pooled

73

analysis of 1.5 million participants from 20 unique prospective cohorts found a 1.2 to 1.5 fold

74

increased risk of MM mortality with increasing body mass index [3]. In addition to the

75

systemic chronic inflammation associated with obesity, increased bone marrow adiposity of

76

the MM microenvironment may directly fuel MM progression [6].

77
78

In MM, initial lipidomic studies comparing malignant plasma cells to healthy plasma cells

79

have reported decreased levels of phosphatidylcholines [8], and differing fatty acid

80

composition of cellular membranes [8, 9]. There are limited studies on the metabolic changes

81

that occur during MM relapse, with most studies focusing at the genomic level [10]. Using

82

Raman spectroscopy to compare between drug resistant and sensitive MM cell lines, Franco

83

et al. suggested differences in nuclear structure, as reflected by altered DNA:RNA ratio as

84

well as cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamine content [11]. Metabolic reprogramming,

85

elevated oxidative stress response and up-regulated prostaglandin synthesis were reported by

86

Zub et al. who compared the proteome and transcriptome of melphalan sensitive and resistant

87

RPMI8226 cell lines [12].

88
89

Advances in omics technologies herald the potential of multi-omics systems analysis, where

90

regulatory networks could be evaluated, for example, by combining proteomics and

91

transcriptomics data. One challenge of performing multi-omics analysis on clinical samples is

92

the limited patient-derived material. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of

93

conducting lipidomic and proteomic analyses from the same patient-derived plasma cell

94

sample. To validate the omics results from our pilot cohort, we compared the proteomics data

95

with a larger public transcriptomic dataset from Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium

96

reference collection, and interpreted the lipidomics data against a combined transcriptomics-

97

proteomics lipid metabolism network for relapsed MM.

Materials and Methods

100

Study design and setting

101

A single-center, prospective pilot study was performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital,

102

Brisbane, Australia. We identified patients as possible candidates (on the basis of clinical

103

features) prior to bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and informed consent was sought prior

104

to the aspiration and biopsy procedure. Bone marrow biopsies were all performed in the

105

outpatient setting. Participant details are in Table S1.

106

Plasma cell isolation from bone marrow

107

Plasma cells were isolated from fresh bone marrow aspirate samples using CD138

108

microbeads (Miltenyi). Purity was verified by flow cytometry (on the basis of CD38 and

109

CD138 expression) and was >80% for all samples. Purified plasma cells were stored in

110

aliquots of 106 cells at -80°C until analysis.

111

Lipid and protein extraction

112

Samples were selected based on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of myeloma with

113

>10% plasma cells in the marrow aspirate sample, and >80% of CD138+ plasma cells post-

114

purification. Extraction of lipids and proteins from 106 isolated plasma cells was carried out

115

using a bi-phasic solvent system of cold methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and water

116

[13]. Briefly, each sample was suspended in 20 µL of cold Milli-Q water and homogenized

117

with a pipette tip, followed by addition of 20 µL of a 20 µM solution of zidovudine (AZT) in

118

methanol as internal standard. Cold methanol (205 µL) was then added. The sample was

119

vortexed briefly, frozen in liquid nitrogen for 2 min, thawed, and sonicated for 10 min. The

120

freeze-thaw-sonication cycle was repeated twice. After incubating at -30 °C for 1 h, the

121

sample was extracted by 750 µL cold MTBE with shaking at 4 °C for 15 min. Phase

122

separation was induced by addition of 188 µL Milli-Q water, vortexing and centrifugation at

123

14000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper phase was collected (700 µL) as the lipid-rich extract

124

fraction, and protein was recovered as the pellet. The lipid extract was evaporated to dryness

125

under vacuum and then reconstituted in 100 µL of a methanol/toluene (9:1) mixture for LC-

126

MS analysis.

127
128

Untargeted lipidomics

129

Untargeted lipidomics using LC-MS was performed as previously described [14], using

130

Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC with 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF mass spectrometer and Dual

131

Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) source. Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus RRHD C18 column (2.1 × 50

132

mm, 1.8 µm) was used at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phases for positive mode LC-MS

133

consisted of A: acetonitrile/water (60:40) and B: isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10). Both A and

134

B contained 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. In negative mode, ammonium

135

formate and formic acid was replaced with 10 mM ammonium acetate in both eluents. LC

136

gradient is described in Supplementary File S2.

137

Full scan MS spectra were acquired for samples at a mass range of m/z 100-1700. The TOF

138

component was tuned using reference masses 118.09, 322.05, 622.03, 922.00, 1221.99 and

139

1521.97 in positive ionization mode, and the masses 112.99, 302.00, 601.98, 1033.99,

140

1333.97 and 1633.95 in negative mode. Source capillary voltages were set to 4000 V for

141

positive ionization mode and 3500 V for negative ionization mode whilst the nozzle voltage

142

was set to 0 V, fragmentor was set to 365 and octopoleRFPeak to 750. Nitrogen gas

143

temperature was set to 250°C at a flow of 15 L/min and a sheath gas temperature of 400°C at

144

a flow of 12 L/min. During the experiment reference masses were enabled for positive

145

(121.05 and 922.01 Da) and negative modes (68.99, 112.98 and 1033.99 Da) to enable auto-

146

recalibration of compounds with known masses.

147

The MS1 untargeted LC-MS data were subjected to batch Molecular Feature Extraction

148

(MFE) with Agilent Profinder (B.08.00, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).

149

Data were then imported into R statistical framework for analysis. Data were first filtered to

150

retained only features that in at least 75% of samples of one or more comparison groups.

151

Remaining missing values were imputed with the minimum value. After quantile

152

normalization and log2 transformation, differential analysis was carried out using limma

153

package [15] to identify significant features (p value < 0.05, logFC > 1.5).

154

To assign the molecular identity to candidate features, LC-MS/MS was performed using

155

nitrogen as the CID collision gas. MS/MS acquisition was performed in targeted mode. The

156

HPLC, column and source parameters were identical to those used in the MS acquisition. A

157

fixed collision energy of 20 eV was used to induce fragmentation for all targets in positive

158

and negative mode. MS/MS data was acquired between 70-1500 m/z with MS and MS/MS

159

scan rates of 3 spectra per second, with a maximum of 5 seconds between MS scans. The

160

isolation width for all targets was set to medium (~4 amu) and a delta retention time of 0.3

161

minutes. The LC-MS/MS data were submitted to the open source software MS-DIAL [16]

162

with LipidBlast in-silico LC-MS/MS library [17] for identification of lipids.

163

Targeted lipidomics

164

Targeted lipidomics experiments were performed using an Agilent Technologies 1290 Infinity

165

II UHPLC system with an Agilent HILIC Plus RRHD 2.1×100 mm 1.8-micron column,

166

coupled online to an Agilent 6490A Triple Quadrupole Mass spectrometer with iFunnel and

167

AJS source. The mass spectrometer was operated in dynamic MRM mode. Each sample was

168

analyzed in three separate dynamic MRM runs for the following lipid classes: Cer, PC and SM

in method F1; PC-O, PC-P, HexCer, LPE, LPC in method F2; PE, PE-O, PE-P, PI, PG in

170

method A1. MRM lipid transitions are shown in Supplementary File S2.

171

The source nitrogen gas temperature was set to 250°C at a flow of 15 L/min. The sheath gas

172

temperature was 400°C with a flow of 12 L/min. The capillary voltage was set to 4000 V for

173

positive mode and 5000 V for negative mode and the nebulizer operated at 30 psi. Ion funnel

174

low and high pressure in positive mode were 150 and 60, and in negative mode 150 and 120

175

respectively. The autosampler was operated at 4°C and the column compartment was operated

176

at 30°C for the duration of the experiment. A solution of 95% acetonitrile was used to perform

177

the needle wash with a duration of 15 seconds. An injection volume of 8µL was used for all

178

samples. Pooled quality control (QC) samples were injected multiple times to condition the

179

HPLC column prior to analyzing the biological samples. Chromatographic separation of lipids

180

was performed using 2 different HILIC buffer systems; 25 mM ammonium formate (pH4.6) or

181

10 mM ammonium acetate (pH7.6). The acetonitrile gradient was from 50% to 95% as

182

described in Supplementary File S2.

183

Raw LC-MS data was imported into Skyline [18], where peak integration was automated but

184

manually confirmed and adjusted if required. Retention time for internal standard of each

185

lipid class was used to confirm correct peak integration of lipids belonging to the same class.

186

Peak areas were exported from Skyline for further analysis in R. Data were then normalized

187

using probabilistic quotient normalization [19] to correct for injection variations, and then

188

log2 transformed. Differential analysis was carried out using limma package identify

189

significant lipids (p value < 0.05, logFC > 1.5).

190

To perform enrichment analysis, lipid sets were generated based on class, total chain length

191

and total chain unsaturation. Lipid set enrichment analysis was performed in R using the

192

fgsea package [20].

194

Proteomics

195

Proteins pellets were thawed on ice then centrifuged. Any excess liquid was removed and

196

samples dried under N2 for 10 min. Protein pellets were resuspended in 15 uL of buffer (70

197

mM Tris pH8, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 40 mM

198

2-chloroacetamide), and sonicated in the Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 15 minutes. Protein

199

concentration was measured using DirectDetect® infrared spectrometer (Merck). A 10 µg

200

aliquot of 1 mg/mL protein extract was denatured by heating at 95°C for 5 minutes. After

201

cooling to room temperature, 0.2 µg trypsin (Promega) was added and incubated at 37C

202

overnight. Digest was stopped by acidification to 0.5 % TFA, and peptides were isolated

203

using OMIX C18 tips (Agilent). NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a Waters

204

nanoACQUITY UPLC system interfaced to an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite hybrid mass spectrometer

205

as described in [21].

206

Acquired data was searched using MaxQuant [22] version 1.5.8.3 against SwissProt human

207

proteome downloaded on 25/10/2017, and later exported to R for analysis. Proteins were

208

filtered according to unique peptides (≥2) and Score (>5), and then according to missing

209

values, where proteins were only kept if they were detected in at least 75% of samples of one

210

or more comparison groups. Data was then quantile normalized and remaining missing values

211

imputed using two techniques: i) proteins missing in < 25% of all samples were considered

212

missing at random, and were imputed using localized least square regression as described in

213

[23], ii) proteins missing in > 25% were imputed from a normal distribution centred at

214

minimum intensity. Log2 transformed data was analyzed using limma package to identify

215

significant proteins (p value < 0.05, logFC > 1.5). Pathway enrichment analysis was carried

216

out using the fgsea package and pathways from Reactome database [24].

Transcriptomics data set

219

Gene expression profiles of the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC) reference

220

collection were downloaded from the Multiple Myeloma Genomics Portal

221

(http://portals.broadinstitute.org/mmgp/) as a GCT file. Expression signals were obtained as

222

median centered and log2 transformed, and imported into R. Patient samples were filtered to

223

include only those diagnosed with Multiple myeloma and reported treatment status.

224

Microarray probes were first mapped to UniProt IDs, followed by differential analysis and

225

pathway enrichment using limma and fgsea packages, respectively.

226
227

Network analysis

228

Biopax level 3 file of the “Metabolism of Lipids” pathway was downloaded from the

229

Reactome database, imported and analyzed in R using NetPathMiner package [25].

230

Transcriptomic data was used to weight network based on adjacent pairwise correlation. Top

231

50 correlated paths, with a minimum path length of 6 reactions, were then extracted for

232

relapsed and newly-diagnosed patients. Association of extracted paths with disease status was

233

assessed by a path classification model. A subnetwork of top paths was then exported to

234

Cytoscape [26] for interactive visualization and analysis.

Results

238

Following clinical diagnosis, plasma cell isolation and quality control, a total of 7 participant

239

samples were available for inclusion (Table S1). For each participant, 1×106 plasma cells

240

were extracted for proteomics and lipidomics analyses. Lipidomics was performed using both

241

untargeted and targeted approaches. Two comparisons were conducted based on clinical

242

information, with the caveat that the sample sizes were small in this study. Firstly, high risk

243

MM (n=3) were compared to low risk MM (n=4) according to R-ISS staging. Secondly,

244

relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM, n=2) versus newly diagnosed MM (NDMM, n=7). Table 1

Untargeted lipidomics profiling of plasma cells

253

For untargeted lipidomics profiling, 6069 and 3617 features were detected in the positive and

254

negative mode, respectively. Filtering missing and low intensity features retained 3015 and

255

2080 features. Differential analysis between risk groups identified 62 and 88 significant

256

features in positive and negative mode (Supplementary File 3). The number of significant

257

features was much higher (>400 features) in RRMM/NDMM comparison, indicating higher

258

variation compared to different risk groups. Differential features with logFC > 1.5 were

259

selected for identification via MS/MS fragmentation and database matching using MS-DIAL.

260

Out of ~400 features, MS-DIAL matched 17 features to their lipid composition, in which

261

several PCs were diminished in RRMM as well as in high risk patients (Table 2).

Targeted lipidomics profiling of plasma cells

269

The targeted lipidomics method included 313 lipids, from which 219 lipids were retained

270

after manual inspection and filtering through Skyline (Supplementary File 4). Differential

271

analysis confirmed untargeted profiling results with several PCs diminished in both high risk

272

and RRMM (Table 3). To investigate if the observed differences are specific to particular

273

lipid class, we performed Lipid set enrichment analysis (Figure 1, Supplementary File 4),

274

which revealed significant down-regulation trend in PCs in both high risk and RRMM.

275

Ceramides and lyso-PEs were significantly enriched for upregulation in high risk patients,

276

while down-regulated in RRMM. Elevated levels of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs),

277

sphingomyelins and sphingosines resulted in significant enrichment of these classes in

278

RRMM.

Untargeted proteomics of plasma cells

287

In the untargeted proteomic analysis, 4169 proteins were identified, of which 2569 were

288

subjected to differential analysis after filtering. Difference between risk groups was limited to

289

28 significant proteins, while RRMM vs NDMM comparison reported 182 differential

291

analysis using Reactome pathways identified ~ 150 significant pathways in RRMM

292

(Supplementary File 6). In contrast, risk groups had only ~25 enriched pathways, mostly

293

related to extracellular matrix.

294
295

Comparison of RRMM proteomics dataset with gene expression data

296

In both lipidomics and proteomics measurements, the differences between RRMM and

297

NDMM were larger than those observed between risk groups. We followed up on these

298

observations in RRMM by integrative analysis with the publicly available MMRC reference

299

collection which contains gene expression profiles for plasma cells from a total of 222

300

patients, with 107 being NDMM (termed untreated) and 115 RRMM (termed treated).

301

Mapping microarray probes to their corresponding UniProt IDs obtained expression levels for

302

~ 17,000 genes. Differential expression analysis followed by pathway enrichment identified

303

430 significant pathways (Supplementary File 6).

304
305

There was significant overlap between the proteomics results from our cohort and the

306

independent transcriptomics results at the pathway level but not at the gene level

307

(hypergeometric test, Figure 2). Out of 6900 significantly expressed genes, 62 genes were

308

also found significant at the protein level, only 20 of which were regulated in the same

309

direction (p = 0.99) (Supplementary File 5). Interestingly, out of the 430 significantly

310

enriched pathways in the transcriptomics dataset, 76 pathways were also enriched at the

311

protein level, 67 of which in the same direction (p < 1e-16). Overlapped pathways included

312

TCR, NF-kß signalling and protein synthesis pathways (Supplementary File 6).

315

Next, we focused on the lipid related pathways in RRMM. Reactome pathway group

316

“Metabolism of lipids” was converted into a single connected network using NetPathMiner R

317

package. Following the package instructions, small ubiquitous compounds, such as water and

318

co-factors, were removed to prevent over-connectivity of the network, resulting in a network

319

with 1130 nodes and 1571 edges. Metabolite nodes were then removed to obtain a reaction

320

network, subsequently weighting the edges using transcriptomics datasets (see Methods). Top

321

correlated paths showed strong association with their corresponding conditions. This was

322

demonstrated by the ability of pathClassifier function to correctly predict path condition.

323

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showed area under the curve (AUC) of 0.995,

324

indicating high sensitivity and specificity of the path classifier (Figure ).

325

Subnetworks constructed from correlated paths resulted in substantially smaller networks. In

326

RRMM, a subnetwork of 101 nodes and 125 edges was obtained, with paths related to PCs,

327

ceramides, cardiolipin metabolism, production of leukotrienes, exotoxins from arachidonic

328

acid (AA), and production of dihydroxycholestanoic acid from cholesterol (Figure 4, red

329

edges). On the other hand, the subnetwork correlated amongst NDMM consisted of 87 nodes

330

and 96 edges, and incorporated FA and PE metabolism, production of prostaglandins and

331

thromboxanes from AA, and production of phosphoserine from cholesterol. Subnetworks

332

from both conditions showed a small overlap, with only 32 nodes and 23 edges (Figure 4,

333

grey edges).

334

Exploring the proteomics data in the context of correlated subnetwork for RRMM revealed a

335

low detection rate (Figure 5). Notably, PLBD1, a phospholipase B implicated in sn1 and sn2

336

hydrolysis PCs, was up-regulated in RRMM proteomics and transcriptomics. This up-

337

regulation of PLBD1, along with the correlation of PC metabolic subnetwork in RRMM,

338

propose a possible explanation for the reduced levels of PCs observed in lipidomics data.

Discussion

340

This study confirmed the feasibility of conducting concurrent lipidomics and proteomics

341

profiling of freshly isolated plasma cells from patients with MM. We observed more

342

lipidomic and proteomic differences between RRMM and NDMM, than between high and

343

low risk MM based on the current R-ISS staging system. As an initial cross-validation, the

344

proteomics data from our small pilot cohort was compared to a larger transcriptomics dataset

345

for RRMM versus NDMM cases. This comparison revealed limited overlap at the

346

transcript/gene level, likely due to the lower proteomics depth compared to transcriptomics.

347

However, significant correlation was observed in the differential pathways at the transcript

348

and proteome level, indicating agreement of our pilot cohort data with the larger

349

transcriptome data. Together, these results confirm the feasibility of concurrent lipidomics

350

and proteomics analyses from a single aliquot of one million plasma cells prepared from

351

freshly collected bone marrow.

352

From both targeted and untargeted lipidomics, we observed significantly lower level of PC in

353

RRMM compared to NDMM, and in high risk compared to low risk patients. Decreased PC

354

was previously observed in MM cells compared to normal plasma cells [8]. Recently, Steiner

355

et al. reported significantly lower circulating plasma levels of several PCs, and elevated lyso-

356

PCs in RRMM compared to NDMM [27]. Hydrolysis of PCs by phospholipases generate

357

lyso-PCs and a free fatty acid which could be further processed to generate lipid second

358

messengers such as arachidonic acid, prostaglandins and leukotrienes [28]. These bioactive

359

lipids play multiple roles in promoting cancer development and metastasis [29]. Interestingly,

360

our transcriptomics network analysis of the larger independent cohort revealed high

361

correlation of PC, arachidonic acid, prostaglandin metabolic pathways among RRMM.

362

Furthermore, although the proteomic coverage of lipid metabolic enzymes was overall very

363

limited, we found phospholipase B-like 1 gene product PLBD1 to be elevated in RRMM. The

364

major cellular phospholipases that participate in signal transduction are PLA, PLC and PLD

365

[28]. PLBD1 was recent identified from neutrophils as a phospholipase which removes fatty

366

acids from either sn-1 or sn-2 positions [30]. Coupled with observed high level of transcripts

367

in the arachidonic pathway, it is tempting to suggest that elevated PLBD1 levels contributes

368

to MM progression and relapse by increasing arachidonic acids levels. Future studies in

369

larger cohorts should examine this pathway.

370
371

We acknowledge that the small patient numbers in our study limit the broader applicability of

372

the work, but in our small dataset, plasma cells from patients with RRMM appear to have a

373

different lipidomic and proteomic profile when we compare with samples from NDMM. This

374

is potentially clinically relevant, as patients who have relapsed disease experience poorer

375

outcomes, with shorter periods of disease control than patients receiving front-line therapy at

376

first diagnosis. The altered lipidomic and proteomic profile observed may reflect the clonal

377

evolution that occurs in the malignant cells over time following serial chemotherapeutic

378

challenges. To this end, it is interesting to note that PC is an important lipid in maintaining

379

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, and that ER stress response pathways is implicated in

380

the development of resistance to proteasome inhibitors in MM [31]. Further studies, with

381

larger groups of patients will be beneficial in establishing the relationship between clonal

382

evolution, subsequent lipidomic and proteomic changes. These results may enable

383

personalized therapy selection, thereby improving patient outcomes.

384
385

In summary, we report the feasible concurrent lipidomic and proteomic analyses of purified

386

plasma cells collected from a small cohort of multiple myeloma patients. As the goal was to

387

determine the methodological feasibility and develop a suitable workflow, interpretation of

388

the biological data from this study is limited by the small cohort size and possible

389

confounders which were not considered. Nonetheless, in alignment with previous reports of

390

reduced levels of PCs in MM (compared with healthy plasma cells), we observed reduced

391

levels of several PCs in high risk MM and in RRMM. Furthermore, independent

392

transcriptome data from a larger cohort corroborates altered PC metabolism in RRMM, and

393

further suggest altered arachidonic acid and eicosanoid metabolism. We believe these

394

preliminary observations warrants further exploration in a larger cohort, as these approaches

395

are likely to provide valuable clinical insights into disease biology, as well as perhaps offer

396

novel biomarkers for the prediction of disease kinetics.

Figure 1. Targeted lipidomics measurements per lipid class, with significantly enriched classes

540

marked with red. Targeted lipidomics data were grouped by lipid class and then evaluated for

541

significance for high versus low risk MM (left) and RRMM versus NDMM (right) using enrichment

542

analysis of fgsea R package. Lipid classes with adjusted P value < 0.05 are considered significantly

543

different between the two groups (labelled red). LogFC, log fold change.

Figure 2. Overlap between proteomics and transcriptomics data at the gene and pathway levels.

547

Proteomic level changes in RRMM compared to NDMM were evaluated against independent

548

transcriptome data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium reference collection. The graph

549

shows the number of genes/proteins (left) or pathways (right) that are significantly different in the

550

proteomics data (red bar), which also was significantly different in the transcriptome data (green bar),

551

in the same direction (blue bar).

Figure 3. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for correlated path classification

555

model of lipid metabolic pathways based on transcriptome data for RRMM. Diagnostic plot of

556

the result from the path classification model for RRMM transcriptome data. ROC curves are shown

557

for each component (M1, M2), which represent a path structure pattern. This gives information about

558

which components is associated with RRMM and NDMM. A ROC curve with an AUC < 0.5 relates

559

to RRMM. Conversely, ROC curve with AUC > 0.5 relates NDMM. Complete ROC represents the

560

performance of the classifier using both components.

563

A sub-network comprised of top 50 correlated paths based on gene expression in RRMM and NDMM

564

was extracted from the lipid metabolism path network. Red and blue edges indicate exclusive

565

correlation in RRMM and NDMM patients, respectively. Grey edges indicate correlation in both

566

conditions.

Conversely, blue nodes indicated down-regulated proteins. Inset: PC metabolism pathways, showing
