Abstract
To develop efficient therapies and identify novel early biomarkers for chronic kidney disease an
understanding of the molecular mechanisms orchestrating it is essential. We here set out to
understand how differences in CKD origin are reflected in gene expression. To this end, we
integrated publicly available human glomerular microarray gene expression data for nine kidney
disease entities that account for a majority of CKD worldwide. We included data from five
distinct studies and compared glomerular gene expression profiles to that of non-tumor parts of
kidney cancer nephrectomy tissues. A major challenge was the integration of the data from
different sources, platforms and conditions, that we mitigated with a bespoke stringent
procedure. This allowed us to perform a global transcriptome-based delineation of different
kidney disease entities, obtaining a landscape of their similarities and differences based on the
genes that acquire a consistent differential expression between each kidney disease entity and
nephrectomy tissue. Furthermore, we derived functional insights by inferring activity of signaling
pathways and transcription factors from the collected gene expression data, and identified
potential drug candidates based on expression signature matching. We validated representative
findings by immunostaining in human kidney biopsies indicating e.g. that the transcription factor
FOXM1 is significantly and specifically expressed in parietal epithelial cells in RPGN whereas
not expressed in control kidney tissue. These results provide a foundation to comprehend the
specific molecular mechanisms underlying different kidney disease entities, that can pave the
way to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. To facilitate this, we provide our
results as a free interactive web application: ​https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/ckd_landscape/​.

1. Introduction
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major public health burden affecting more than 10 % of the
population globally 1​ There is no specific therapy and the associated costs are enormous 2​​ . The
origin of CKD is heterogenous and has slowly changed in recent years due to an aging
population with increased number of patients with hypertension and diabetes. Major contributors
to worldwide CKD include Diabetic nephropathy (DN) and Hypertensive nephropathy (HN).
Other contributors are immune diseases such as Lupus Nephritis (LN) and glomerulonephritides
including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), Minimal Change
Disease (MCD) as well as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Rapidly
progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).

Regardless of the type of initial injury to the kidney the stereotypic response to chronic repetitive
injury is scar formation with subsequent kidney functional decline. Scars form in the
tubulointerstitium as tubulointerstitial fibrosis and in the glomerulus as glomerulosclerosis.
Despite this stereotypic response the initiating stimuli are quite heterogeneous, ranging from an
auto-immunological process in LN to poorly controlled blood glucose levels in DN. A better
understanding of similarities and differences in the complex molecular process orchestrating
disease initiation and progression will guide the development of novel targeted therapeutics.

A powerful tool to understand and model the molecular basis of diseases is the analysis of
genome-wide gene expression data. This has been applied in the context of various kidney
diseases contributing to CKD 3–7​
​ , and most studies are available in the online resource
NephroSeq. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study so far has combined these data

sets to build a comprehensive landscape of the molecular alterations underlying different kidney
diseases that account for the majority of CKD cases. We collected data from five large studies
with microarray gene expression data from kidney biopsies of patients of eight different
glomerular disease entities leading to CKD (from hereon referred to as CKD entities), FSGS,
MCD, IgAN, LN, MGN, DN, HN and RPGN. We normalized the data with a bespoke stringent
procedure, which allowed us to study the similarities and differences among these entities in
terms of deregulated genes, pathways, and transcription factors, as well as to identify drugs that
revert their expression signatures and thereby might be useful to treat them.

2.1. Assembly of a pan-CKD collection of patient gene expression profiles

identified five studies - GSE20602 10​

(see section 4.1.) - with human microarray gene expression data for nine different glomerular

disease entities: FSGS, MCD, IgAN, LN, MGN, DN, HN and RPGN, as well as healthy tissue
and non-tumor part of kidney cancer nephrectomy tissues as controls (Figure 1A and B). In
addition, in one dataset, patients were labeled as an overlap of FSGS and MCD (FSGS-MCD)
and we left it as such. These studies were generated in two different microarray platforms. To
jointly analyze and compare the different CKD entities, we performed a stringent preprocessing
and normalization procedure involving quality control, either cyclic loess normalization or
YuGene transformation and a batch effect mitigation procedure (see Methods and
Supplementary material). At the end we kept 6289 genes from 199 samples in total. From the
two potential controls, healthy tissue and nephrectomies, we chose the latter for further analysis
as the batch mitigation removed a large number of genes from the healthy tissue samples.

2.2. Technical heterogeneity across samples
We first examined the similarities among the samples to assess potential batch effects. Data did
not primarily cluster by study source or platform, which can be attributed to our batch mitigation
procedure (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1), although some technical sources of variance
potentially still remained (see section 4.4. and Supplementary Figure 1). Samples from RPGN
and FSGS-MCD conditions seemed to be more affected by platform-specific batch effects than
samples from other conditions, due to the unbalanced distribution of samples: RPGN and
FSGS-MCD samples were exclusively represented in one study and in one of the two platforms
(Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (GPL570)). Therefore, batch effect mitigation
procedure could not be conducted on them.

2.3. Biological heterogeneity of CKD entities
We set out to find molecular differences among glomerular CKD entities. First, we calculated the
differential expression of individual genes between the different CKD entities and TN using
limma 15,16​
​
. From the 6289 genes included in the integrated dataset, 1791 showed significant
differential expression (|logFC| > 1, p-value < 0.05) in at least one CKD entity. RPGN was the
CKD entity with the largest number of significantly differentially expressed genes (885), while
MCD was the one with the least (75). Twelve genes showed significant differential expression
across all the CKD entities (AGMAT, ALB, BHMT2, CALB1, CYP4A11, FOS, HAO2, HMGCS2,
MT1F, MT1G, PCK1, SLC6A8). Interestingly, all these genes were underexpressed across all
the CKD entities compared to TN. In contrast, QKI and LYZ genes were significantly
overexpressed in HN, IgAN, and LN, while significantly underexpressed in FSGS-MCD, and
RPGN (and DN for QKI). 107 different genes were significantly differentially expressed relative
to TN in at least 6 CKD entities (Figure 2A). Of note, several of the above mentioned genes are
considered to be expressed mainly in tubule. This is one drawback of the microdissection
technique and future studies using scRNA-seq will dissect which genes are specifically
expressed in glomerular cells during homeostasis and disease.

To better comprehend the divergence and similarities of the CKD samples, we asked how the
distinct CKD entities localised with respect to each other using a common set of differentially

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/265447; this version posted February 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

expressed genes with regard to the tumor nephrectomies using diffusion maps (Figure 2B). The
diffusion distances of each given CKD entity sample relative to tumor nephrectomy samples
reflects a non-linear lower dimensional representation of the differences in gene expression
profiles

between

those

samples.

The Diffusion map orders the patients along a

“pseudo-temporal” order, which we interpret here to indicate disease progression severity in
glomeruli 17​
​ .

The most distant condition from nephrectomy samples was RPGN, which is arguably the most
drastic kidney disease condition with the most rapid functional decline among the entities
included. Interestingly, healthy donor samples were distinct from tumor nephrectomy samples
despite the fact that the later were resected distantly from the tumors. This might be explained
by either minor contamination with cancer cells or paraneoplastic effects on the non-affected
kidney tissue such as immune cell infiltration or solely the fact that the nephrectomy tissue was
exposed to short ischemia whereas the biopsy tissue from healthy donors was not. DN and LN
were in close proximity to RPGN, whereas HN localised near IgAN. Differences were harder to
asses in the middle of the diffusion map, but were visible when plotting the dimension
components pair-wise (Sup. Figure 2). For instance, MCD samples spanned from a point
proximal to tumor nephrectomy to near FSGS, but some MCD samples were in close proximity
to MGN or even hypertensive nephropathy. While it makes sense that MCD as a relatively mild
disease with normal light microscopy, is relatively close to the control groups of TN and HLD, it
remains unclear why other disease entities such as LN and DN. spread widely in the diffusion
map. Unfortunately, the data we used did not include information about disease severity, which
might help to explain this heterogeneity with early stage disease possibly closer to the control
groups and late stage disease closer to RPGN. Dimension component 1 (DC1) seems to offer

a focus on the dissimilarity between the two reference healthy conditions, tumor nephrectomy
and healthy living donor from the CKD entities. Dimension component 2 (DC2) provides more
insight into the disparity of the reference conditions. Dimension component 3 (DC3) discerns the
subtle geometrical manifestation of the distinct CKD entities with regard to each other. In
summary, using diffusion maps we find clear differences in the global expression profiles of the
CKD entities.

2.4. Transcription factor activity in CKD entities
To further characterize the differences among the CKD entities, we performed various functional
analyses. First, we assessed the activity of transcription factors (TFs; Figure 3), based the levels
of expression of their known putative targets (see Methods). Changes in putative target genes
provided superior estimates of the TF activity than the expression level of the transcription factor
itself 18,19
​
(Figure 3). We found 10 TFs differentially regulated in at least one CKD entity (Figure
3). Furthermore, we correlated the identified TF’s activities with the expression of those genes,
that are encoding for these TFs. The idea was that, while factors with negative correlations are
potentially acting as repressors, those with positive correlations are acting as activators. Those
with no correlation indicate factors whose activity may be significantly modulated using
post-translational modifications or factors whose regulation or expression measurements are
unconfident. For instance, Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) is significantly enriched in LN
and moderately correlated -Spearman’s rho ( r​s = 0.624- with the expression level of the gene
encoding for IRF1. This suggests an as of yet undiscovered potential role of

IRF1 as a

transcriptional activator in LN. In addition, IRF1’s transcriptional activity was elevated in LN
compared to the other disease entities. The activity of the upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2)
- a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF 20
​ - was estimated to be significantly decreased in MCD
compared to the rest of the conditions. Interestingly, USF2’s estimated activity across the CKD
entities was inversely correlated - Spearman’s rho (r​s =
​ -0.867) - with the expression level of the
gene USF2, that is encoding for the TF USF2. Intriguingly, USF2 has been implicated as a
potential transcriptional modulator of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) - associated protein
(ATRAP/Agtrap) in mice 20​
​ .

We next sought to validate the expression of two identified TFs in human tissue by
immunostaining. We stained for USF-2 in human kidney biopsies from healthy controls and
patients with MCD. USF-2 was expressed in podocytes, the mainly affected glomerular cell-type
in MCD (Figure 4A-B). However, when compared to controls, USF-2 expression in podocytes
showed no significant difference detectable by immunofluorescence (Figure 4C-C’’).

The

reason for this might be that USF-2 activity as a TF might be regulated not only by its
abundance in the nucleus but rather by its DNA binding capability in the interaction with other
proteins. FOXM1 is a transcription factor of the forkhead box family and a known regulator of
cell cycle progression in normal cells as well as a predictor of adverse outcomes across 39
human malignancies 21​
​ . Our analysis suggests a highly increased activity of FOXM1 in RPGN
(Figure 3). We next validated this observation in human biopsy samples from RPGN patients
and normal controls. FOXM1 showed a unique expression in CD44 positive glomerular parietal
epithelial cells in RPGN lesions whereas we did not find any expression of FOXM1 in healthy
human glomeruli (Figure 4. D-F). Consistent with our TF activity analysis, quantification of this
finding in 5 RPGN biopsies versus 6 controls yielded a highly significant difference (Figure 4F),
indicating that FOXM1 has a significant role in RPGN progression. This data suggest that our
computational method might be useful to identify novel regulators in CKD.

2.4. Signaling Pathway Analysis
We complemented the functional characterization of transcription factor activities with an
estimation of pathways activities with the tools PROGENy 22​
​ and Piano 23​
​ .

2.4.1. Pathway activity of CKD entities using PROGENy
PROGENy infers pathway activity by looking at the changes in levels of the genes affected by
perturbation of pathways. This provides a better proxy of pathway activity than assessing the
genes in the actual pathway 22​
​ . We used PROGENy scores to estimate pathway activity in a
disease entity from the gene expression data (Figure 5A). Essentially, the degree of pathway
deregulation was associated with the degree of disease severity, and present rather divergent
activities across the CKD entities. For example, VEGF was estimated to be significantly

influential in five CKD entities: RPGN, HN, DN, LN and IgAN, out of which VEGF is predicted to
be deactivated in RPGN and DN, but more prominently activated in HN, LN and IgAN. 10 out of
11 pathways were predicted to be significantly deregulated in RPGN with respect to TN, which
is aligned with the diffusion map (Figure 2B) outcome; the divergence of RPGN from TN
(control) was considerably more prominent both at a global transcriptome landscape and
signaling pathway level. Intriguingly, the pathway JAK-STAT did not appear to be affected in
RPGN, but was considerably activated in LN and markedly deactivated in DN in comparison to
TN. Overall, the separate CKD entities were characterised by distinct combinations, magnitudes
and directions of signaling pathway activities according to PROGENy.

2.4.2. Pathway enrichment with Piano
While PROGENy can give accurate estimates of pathway activity, it is limited to 11 pathways for
which robust signatures could be generated 22​
​ . To get a more global picture, we complemented
that analysis with a gene-set-enrichment analysis using Piano 23​
​ . ​A total of 160 pathways out of
1329 were significantly enriched (up-/down-regulated, corrected p-value < 0.05) in at least one
CKD entity. HN was the entity with the largest number of differentially enriched pathways (81,
25 down-regulated, 56 up-regulated), while FSGS-MCD did not show significant enrichment for
any pathway. Cell-cycle and immune-system related pathways were significantly up-regulated in
7/9 CKD entities (FSGS, HN, IgAN, LN, MGN and RPGN in both cases, DN for immune system,
and MCD for cell-cycle); in contrast, the VEGF pathway was differentially enriched in LN only.
Interestingly, the TNFR2 pathway was differentially enriched in IgAN, HN, and LN, in line with
the results from PROGENy where the VEGF pathway was significantly deregulated not only in
IgAN, HN and LN, but also in RPGN and DN. 59 different pathways showed significant

enrichment in at least 3 CKD entities (Figure 5B). Figure 4B also shows that HN (52), MGN (45),
and IgAN (37) are the CKD entities with more pathways differentially enriched in at least 3
entities, a result that agrees with Figure 2B showing these entities in the center of the diffusion
map.

2.5 Prediction of potential novel drugs that might affect the identified disease signature
in different kidney diseases
Finally, we

applied a signature-search-engine, L1000CDS​2 24​
​ . L1000CDS​2 prioritizes small

molecules that are expected to have a reverse signature compared to the disease signature.
This is based on computing the distance between two signatures of disease data and the
LINCS-L1000 data, a large collection of changes in gene expression driven by drugs. We
performed this analysis separately for the nine CKD entities and identified 220 small molecules
across the CKD entitles (Supplementary Figure 5). In order to narrow down the list of 220 small
molecules, we focused on 20 small molecules observed in the L1000CDS​2 ​output of at least 3
subtypes (Figure 6A).

By curation of scientific publications, we found that four small molecules have experimental
evidence to support their clinical relevance in CKD or renal disease animal model testing
(Supplementary Figure 7.). BRD-K04853698 (LDN-193189) which is known as a selective bone
morphogenic protein signaling inhibitor, has been shown to suppress endothelial damage in
mice with CKD 25​
​ . Wortmannin, a cell-permeable PI3K inhibitor, decreased albuminuria and
podocyte damage in early diabetic nephropathy in rats 26​
​ . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib
is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia in man.​27 Nilotinib treatment resulted in stabilized
kidney function and prolonged survival after subtotal nephrectomy in rats when compared to
vehicle 28​
​ . Finally, narciclasine was identified and it has been reported to reduce macrophage
infiltration and inflammation in the mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of kidney
fibrosis 29​
​ .

To further explore the association of these drugs with CKD and its’ progression, we analysed
the expression data for the targets of the literature supported drug candidates. First, each drug
candidate was mapped to genes that encode the proteins targeted by these drugs (Figure 6B).
For each gene, its differential expression of any CKD entity against TN was evaluated. Out of
the 11 mapped genes, MYLK3, a target of narciclasine, was significantly differentially expressed
(under-expressed, logFC<-1, p<0.05) in two CKD entities (IgAN and LN) (Supplementary figure
6). Complementarily, screened drugs were mapped to the pathways they affect based on their
functional information. The enrichment of the subset of pathways was evaluated using the
previous results from gene set analysis algorithm (piano). This time, only the PI3KCI pathway
appeared to be enriched in HN (up-regulated, p<0.05), and as pathway affected by the
candidate repositioned drugs (Wortmannin, PI3K inhibitor). Taken together, this data suggests
that kidney transcriptomics might be useful to predict potential novel drug candidates.

3. Discussion
We have aimed to shed light on the commonalities and differences among glomerular
transcriptomes of major kidney diseases contributing to the CKD epidemic affecting >10% of the
population worldwide. Multiple pathologies are covered under the broad umbrella of CKD and,
while they share a physiological manifestation, i.e. loss of kidney function, the driving molecular
process can be different. In this study we explored these processes by analyzing glomerular
gene expression data from kidney biopsies obtained via microdissection. ​We observed
expression data of many genes that are considered to be tubule specific in the glomerular
dataset e.g. ALB and CALB1. The reason for this might be that microdissection techniques are
imperfect, resulting in contamination of glomerular preps with tubule. Current technologies
including scRNA-seq will help to dissect expression in particular cell-types of the glomerulus.

Genes such as ​Quaking (QKI) or Lysozyme C (LYZ), were significantly ​overexpressed,
underexpressed or not altered depending on the underlying kidney disease. It is known that QKI
is associated with angiogenic growth factor release and plays a pathological role in the kidney
30​

, while LYZ was known to be related to the extent of vascular damage and heart failure but

was recently found to be increased in plasma during CKD progression 31​
​ . This data supports the
fact that despite a stereotypic response of the kidney to injury with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial
fibrosis and nephron loss, there are various disease specific differences that are important to
understand in order to develop novel personalized therapeutics.

CKD is a complex disease with a

high degree of polygenicity. Furthermore, it is a very

heterogeneous condition that can be acquired through a variety of biological mechanisms which

is reflected by the results of pathway analysis. There was little to no overlap in significantly
enriched pathways between the different kidney disease entities. We found 59 different
pathways that showed significant enrichment in at least 3 disease entities (Figure 5B), indicating
that different disease entities share some general mechanisms but their underlying
pathophysiology differs from one entity to another. Besides increasing the interpretability, the
pathway analysis identified many more differences among disease-identities than the gene-level
analysis (Figure 2A). For example, pathway analysis identified pathways related to the
metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins significantly down-regulated in MCD, MGN, and HN; and
pathways related to fatty acid metabolism significantly down-regulated in MCD, IgAN, MGN, and
HN, results similar to those reported by Kang et al 6​​ .

We also used the signature-matching paradigm to explore potential drugs that could revert the
disease phenotype, and found that four drugs hold promise in different CKD entities. Even
though more experimental validation is required for the unknown medical interaction between
drugs of our results and CKD progression, our approach suggests that it is possible to find
promising treatments for CKD via drug repositioning. In particular, for one of the identified drugs,
nilotinib, use in humans has already been granted in leukemia and there is supporting data of its
value insight at indications for CKD 28​
​ .

The analysis of the drug targets’ expression found that MYLK3, a gene encoding for one of the
targets of narciclasine, was significantly underexpressed in IgAN and LN when compared with
TN. Similarly, the PI3KCI pathway, the target of Wortmannin was enriched in HN (up-regulated,
p<0.05). This analysis attempted to refine the outcome of the repositioning analysis, and at the
same time helped to connect it to the disease mechanism both at the gene as well as the
pathway level.

We view our analysis as a first step towards a characterization of the similarities and differences
of the various pathologies that lead to CKD. As more data sets become available, either from
micro-arrays or RNA-seq, these can be integrated in our pipeline. Furthermore, the burgeoning
field of single-cell RNA (scRNA) has just started to produce data sets in kidney 36,37
​
and holds
the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the functioning of the kidney and its
pathologies 38
​ 39​
​ . In particular, scRNA data can provide signatures of the many cell types of the
kidney, which in turn can be used to deconvolute the composition of cell types​12 in the more
abundant and cost-effective bulk expression datasets 39​
​ . Other data sets, such as
(phospho)proteomics​40 and metabolomics​41​, may complement gene expression towards a more
complete picture of the CKD-entities. Ideally, all these data sets would be collected in a
standardized manner to facilitate integration, which was a major hurdle in our study. Such a
comprehensive analysis across large cohorts, akin to what has happened for the different
tumour types thanks to initiatives such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium, can
lead to major improvements in our understanding of and treatment venues for CKD 42​

4. Methods

4.1. Data collection
Raw data CEL files of each microarray dataset - GSE20602 10​
​ ; GSE32591 11​
​ ; GSE37460 11​
​ ;
GSE47183 12,13​
​
; GSE50469 14
​ - were downloaded and imported to R (R version 3.3.2). For
more information see Supplementary Methods.

4.3. Normalization
Cyclic loess normalization was applied using the limma package 16,43,44​
​
. YuGene transformation
was carried out using the YuGene R package 45​
​ .
4.4. ​Detection of genes with consistently small p-values across all studies
Based on the assumption that common mechanisms might contribute to all CKD entities we
performed a Maximum p-value (maxP) method 46
​ - which uses the maximum p-value as the test
statistic - on the output of the differential expression analysis of the hypothetically separate
studies. For more information see Supplementary Methods.

4.6. Diffusion map
The batch mitigated data containing merely the maxP identified (section 4.5.) 1790 genes
(Supplementary Material/Data and Code) (FDR < 0.01), were YuGene transformed 45
​ and the
destiny R package 47​
​ was utilised to produce the diffusion maps.

4.7. Functional Analysis

4.7.1. Transcription factor activity analysis
We estimated transcription factor activities in the glomerular CKD entities using DoRothEA​18
which is a pipeline that tries to estimate transcription factor activity via the expression level of its
target genes utilizing a curated database of transcription factor - target gene interactions (TF
Regulon). ​For more information see Supplementary Methods.

4.7.2. ​Inferring Signaling Pathway Activity fusing PROGENy
We used the cyclic loess normalised and batch effect mitigated expression values for
PROGENy 22​
​ , a method which utilizes downstream gene expression changes due to pathway
perturbation in order to infer the upstream signaling pathway activity. ​For more information see
Supplementary Methods.

4.7.3. Pathway Analysis with Piano
Pathway analysis was performed using the piano package from R 23​
​ . ​For more information see
Supplementary Methods.

4.8. Drug repositioning
For each CKD entity, the signature of cosine distances computed by characteristic direction was
applied to a signature-search-engine, L1000CDS​2​ ​24​ with the mode of reverse in configuration.

Supplementary Methods

Data collection
Raw data CEL files of each microarray dataset - GSE20602 10​
​ ; GSE32591 11​
​ ; GSE37460 11​
​ ;
GSE47183 12,13​
​
; GSE50469 14
​ - were downloaded and imported to R (R version 3.3.2) using the
getGEOSuppFiles and read.affy function of the GEOquery and simpleaffy package, respectively
49​

. Each dataset came from either Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array or Affymetrix Human

Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array, therefore the preprocessing was done with the affy R package 50
​
accordingly.

Preprocessing and mapping
RNA quality was assessed by RNA degradation plots using the AffyRNAdeg function from the
affy package. In order to assess the statistical characteristics of the raw data, the affyPLM
package 51
​ was used and probe-level metric calculations were carried out on the CEL files by
calling the fitPLM function. The homogeneity of probe sets was evaluated by Normalized
Unscaled Standard Error (NUSE) and Relative Log Expression (RLE) boxplots 52–54​
​
. We
removed all arrays that showed greater spread of NUSE value distribution with respect to the
rest or where the median NUSE value was above 1.05, as these features indicated the sign of
low quality array. The RLE values represent the ratio between the expression of a probe set
and the median expression of that probe set across all arrays in the data set. The ratios are
expected to be centered around zero on a logarithmic scale. RLE boxplots were generated to
visualise the distribution of RLE values. Array quality was evaluated by taking NUSE and RLE
plots into account. The preprocessing step also constituted background correction and log2

transformation of the raw values, of which was done by the Robust Multichip Average (RMA)
package 55–57​
​
. ​Probe IDs were mapped to Entrez Gene ID resulting in 20514 (Platform GPL570,
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) and 12437 (Platform GPL96, Affymetrix
Human Genome U133A Array) unique Entrez gene identifiers, respectively. In the case where
datasets contained multiple probes for the same Entrez ID gene, the probe with the highest
interquartile range (IQR) was retained as the representative of that given gene in the dataset.
For this filtering step, the nsFilter function from the genefilter package 58​
​ was utilized.
Correlation of arrays
Correlation of arrays was assessed by hierarchical clustering of the arrays based on gene
expression Spearman’s rank-based correlation coefficients. Low Spearman correlation
coefficients imply considerable differences between array intensities 59​
​ .
Batch effect mitigation
The efficient integration of the data from different sources and platforms requires batch effect
management, which should be customised to the data at hand. The current data was heavily
affected by platform- and study-specific batch effects, because the outcome categories (CKD
entities and their samples) were unevenly distributed across studies and microarray platforms.
The commonly used algorithms for correcting batch effects assume a balanced distribution of
outcome categories across batches and are vulnerable to the group-batch imbalance 60–63​
​
. We
conducted a stringent batch effect mitigation process in order to minimize the influence of
technical heterogeneity. First, we structured the data in a platform-specific manner. Then, we
conducted differential gene expression analysis between those identical biological conditions
that are originating from distinct study sources after cyclic loess normalization and removed
those genes that are significantly differentially expressed between them, as it indicated

differences mainly due to the data source, rather than the biological difference. Note that this is
a more stringent approach than other batch correction approaches which seek to “model-away”
batch-related variance but retain all the data. In our case, this was not possible, and we opted to
simply remove genes that are most affected by batch effects. We applied this procedure for the
data fragments coming from ​Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array and Affymetrix
Human Genome U133A Array. Next, we merged the data sets between the two platforms using
the overlapping genes, followed by a process to mitigate the platform-induced batch effect. This
latter procedure is similar to the one used for the data source-specific batch effect mitigation.
By applying this stringent procedure, we eliminated the genes that are the most affected by
batch effects. ​For the illustration of this procedure, see Sup. Figure 1. The scater R package 64
​
was used for producing the batch effect management related plots.

Detection of genes with consistently small p-values across all studies
The maxP test follows a beta distribution that is parametrized by ​α​ = ​K and ​β​ = 1 under the
null hypothesis:

where ​θk​ ​ is the effect size of study ​k​.
This hypothesis setting (symbolised by HS​A​) aims
to uncover differentially expressed (DE)
​
genes that acquire non-zero effect sizes in all studies. To phrase it differently, it is designated to
unravel DE genes that are characterised by a small p-value across all studies 46,65,66​

To obtain the p-values, ​differential expression analysis was conducted on the batch effect
mitigated data using the limma R package 15​
​ . We contrasted each glomerular CKD entity with
tumor nephrectomy condition - each CKD - tumor nephrectomy contrast represented a
hypothetically separate “study” - and the lmFit function was used to fit a linear model to the
expression data for each probe set in the array series, followed by the estimation of eBayes
values and the execution of a moderated t-test by the empirical Bayes method for differential
expression (eBayes function) 15,59​
​
.

Transcription factor activity analysis with DoRothEA
The cyclic loess normalized expression values of all genes in all conditions were scaled and
re-centered across the conditions and the transcription factors activities were estimated from the
TF Regulon of DoRothEA​18 using VIPER 19​
​ . We then conducted a Spearman’s rank-based
correlation between the identified transcription factors’ activity and the scaled and re-centered
expression of the genes encoding for these transcription factors. Since as a consequence of the
batch effect mitigation procedure we lost many potentially informative genes, the coverage of
the TF regulon database was limited and hence our statistical power decrease, meaning that
there might be more differentially regulated TFs.

Inferring Signaling Pathway Activity using PROGENy
The expression values were standardised to express a distance of each CKD sample from
tumor nephrectomy (CKD entity sample scaled by the standard deviation of tumor
nephrectomy). We used the overlapping genes between the standardised gene expression
matrix and the PROGENy model. Then, a matrix multiplication was done to get the product
matrix,

containing a PROGENy score for each pathway in each CKD entity. A positive

PROGENy score in a given pathway in a given CKD entity implies higher signaling activity
compared to that specific pathways’ activity in tumor nephrectomy, and vice versa for a negative
PROGENy score.

Statistical significance was assessed using permutation-based hypothesis testing. We
resampled the standardised gene expression values in a way that results in the randomised
allocation of expression values to different glomerular disease labels. This resampling was
done ten thousand times. We then computed PROGENy scores from these permuted Z-scores,
resulting in a list of glomerular CKD entity specific PROGENy scores. By applying this approach
we generated an empirical null distribution on the basis of the original gene expression sample
distribution. The probability that the original PROGENy score in a given glomerular CKD entity is
coming from the estimated null distribution or not was evaluated in a pathway-specific manner.
We used a p-value of 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance. Furthermore, we applied
the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment 67​
​ on the p-values to correct for multiple testing.

Pathway Analysis with Piano
Pathway analysis was performed using the piano package from R 23​
​ . The Molecular Signature
Database - Curated Pathways - Canonical Pathways (MSigDB-C2-CP) was used as biological
model to map the individual genes to functional sets. Gene-level statistics were obtained after
applying the limma algorithm (see section 4.5.). All disease entities were compared to tumor
nephrectomy, because the healthy living donor samples were highly corrupted by batch effects
and as a result of the batch effect mitigation, we had to remove a considerably large number of
genes from these samples.The following ten methods (with their corresponding gene-level
statistics) were used as input of the pathway analysis algorithm to calculate gene set

enrichment: Fisher (PVal), Stouffer (PVal), Reporter (PVal), PAGE (TVal), Tail Strength (PVal)
,GSEA (TVal), Mean (FC), Median (FC), Sum (FC), MaxMean (TVal). For each pathway/p-value
pair the geometrical average across all ten methods was calculated. For simplicity, only the
p_dist_down and p_dist_up features were retrieved.

Drug repositioning
Cyclic loess normalized gene expression data for nine glomerular CKD entities were analyzed
separately for measuring characteristic direction (CD) 68​
​ . Cosine distance for each gene was
computed to the line which has 90 degree to the hyperplane which set the given CKD entity
apart from tumor nephrectomy in N-dimensional gene expression space. Then, for each CKD
entity, the signature of cosine distances computed by characteristic direction was applied to a
signature-search-engine, L1000CDS​2 24
​ with the mode of reverse in configuration. L1000CDS​2
provided the top 50 ranked small molecule candidates with 1-cos(a), p-value, drug database
links. Significant small molecules with FDR < 0.05 were filtered in for the nine CKD entities,
separately. For converting the name of small molecules into general chemical names, we
referred to LINCS phase I, II dataset stored in GEO (GSE92742, GSE70138) 69​
​ .

Immunofluorescent staining of human kidney biopsies and analysis
The following primary antibodies were used and incubated 1h: USF-2 (5E9, Santa Cruz, 1:100,
mouse), FOXM1 (ab207298, Abcam, 1:100, rabbit), CD44-Alexa-Fluor-647 (IM7, BioLegend,
1:100, rat). The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti​–​rabbit, ​–​mouse, Alexa
Fluor 546 (Dianova, 1:200). The nuclei were stained using DAPI (Sigma). Sections were
evaluated with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with 40x objective. Image processing was
performed using NIH ImageJ software.
