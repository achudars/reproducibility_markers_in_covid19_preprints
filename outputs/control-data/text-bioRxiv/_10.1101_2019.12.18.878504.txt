Abstract
During inflammatory reactions, the production and release of chemotactic factors guide the
recruitment of selective leukocyte subpopulations. HMGB1 and the chemokine CXCL12,
both released in the microenvironment, form a heterocomplex, which exclusively acts on the
chemokine receptor CXCR4, enhancing cell migration and, in some pathological conditions
such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, exacerbating the immune response. An excessive cell influx at
the inflammatory site can be diminished by disrupting the heterocomplex.
Here, we report the computationally driven identification of a novel peptide (HBP08), which
binds HMGB1 with the highest affinity reported so far (Kd of 0.8 ± 0.1 μM), able to
selectively inhibit the activity of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex.
The identification of this peptide represents an important step towards the development of
innovative pharmacological tools for the treatment of severe chronic inflammatory conditions
characterized by an uncontrolled immune response.

Introduction
Chemokines are key regulators of leukocyte migration and play fundamental roles both in
physiological and pathological immune responses.1 Chemokine receptors differentially
expressed by all leukocytes and many non-hematopoietic cells, including cancer cells,
constitute the largest branch of the γ subfamily of rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCR). In modern pharmacology, this receptor superfamily represents the most successful
target of small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of human diseases.2 In the
last 25/30 years, an impressive amount of preclinical and clinical evidence has progressively
validated the role of chemokines and their receptors in immune-mediated diseases.3, 4
Furthermore, in the last decade, several studies have pointed out how the activity of
chemokines on cell migration can be modulated by their binding to other chemokines or
proteins released in inflammation.5, 6 In particular, our group has shown that High Mobility
Group Box 1 (HMGB1), an alarmin released under stress conditions, forms a heterocomplex
with the chemokine CXCL12, favoring cell migration via the activation of the chemokine
receptor CXCR4 in the presence of low concentration of CXCL12, which normally is
insufficient to trigger a cellular response.7 Moreover, we have demonstrated that synergism
between CXCL12 and HMGB1 sustains inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).8
These observations suggest that the identifications of molecules able to suppress the
interaction between chemokines and their modulators could lead to the discovery of effective
inhibitors able to promote resolution of inflammation.
HMGB1 is a highly conserved nuclear protein expressed in bacteria, yeast, plants and in all
vertebrate cells. Structurally, it is composed by two homologous, but not identical domains,
BoxA and BoxB, and a negatively charged C-terminal tail (Figure 1).9 In addition to its
nuclear function, HMGB1 is released under inflammatory conditions or by necrotic cells, and
acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP).10, 11

In the extracellular space, HMGB1 can be present in different redox states, depending on the
presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond between two cysteines at position 23 and 45.12
Reduced HMGB1, once released in the extracellular space, can form a heterocomplex with
CXCL12 and synergistically promote, via CXCR4, the recruitment of leukocytes to
inflammatory sites.7, 8, 13 Moreover reduced HMGB1 can bind to the receptor for advanced
glycation endproducts (RAGE) to induce CXCL12 secretion and authophagy.14 Once
oxidized, by reactive oxidative species present in the extracellular space, HMGB1 binds to
the Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) leading to activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB)
and transcription of cytokines, and chemokines.12, 15
To date, despite the importance of this target, only few inhibitors of the CXCL12/HMGB1
interaction, or of the HMGB1 functions have been identified.16,

17, 18, 19

Currently,

glycyrrhizin is the most potent and the best structurally characterized inhibitor of the
CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex, but has a low affinity for HMGB1 (Kd ~ 150 μM), and it
lacks of specificity.7, 16, 19
Peptides are receiving increasing attention due to their ability in targeting large surfaces as
those involved in protein-protein interactions (PPI), and to promising pre-clinical and clinical
results.20,22 Recent efforts have been put into the development of innovative strategies to
overcome their intrinsic limitations such as low bioavailability and poor metabolic stability.21,
22, 23

It is estimated that more than 400 peptides are in clinical development, and 60 are

already available for therapeutic use in different countries.24, 25
Here, we report the computationally driven identification of a novel high affinity nonapeptide
able to inhibit the formation of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex and to abolish the
synergistic effect on cell migration in CXCR4 transfected cells and in human monocytes,
without affecting the ability of HMGB1 to trigger TLR4. The peptide is the strongest
HMGB1 binder reported so far, with an affinity Kd of 0.8 µM.

Results
Design of a peptide inhibitor of the CXCL12/HMGB1 interaction
Taking advantage of the known interaction between glycyrrhizin and HMGB1,16 we
developed a computational pipeline to identify novel and selective peptide inhibitors of the
CXCL12/HMGB1 interaction (Figure 2A).
We generated a model of the glycyrrhizin/BoxA complex consistent with the results of
previously reported NMR chemical shift perturbation studies (Figure 2B).16
To maximize the heterogeneity of the peptides considered in our screening, we generated a
library of 40.000 nonapeptides with a randomly selected sequence. All peptides were docked
in the glycyrrhizin binding site and ranked according to the binding energy of the
corresponding peptide/HMGB1 complex (Figure 2C, See Materials and Methods). Finally,
aiming to reduce the number of potential false positives, the best 100 ranking peptides were
re-docked to BoxA, with the program Glide,26 without constraining the algorithm to explore
only the glycyrrhizin binding site.
The peptides resulting after these calculations were visually inspected and only the best
GSCORE (a scoring function aimed to estimate binding affinity) pose of 57 peptides with a
glycyrrhizin-like binding mode were retained for further analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
Several studies have shown that approximated free energy methods like MM-GBSA,27, 28
especially when coupled with long MD simulations, can be a valuable help in selection of
active molecules in virtual screening investigations.29,

30

Therefore, a 500 ns long MD

simulation was performed for each of the 57 peptides obtained from docking calculations.
Those detaching from the BoxA binding pocket during the simulations (14 out of 57) were
considered unstable and not further analyzed in MM-GBSA calculations (Supplementary
Table 1).

Based on the MM-GBSA score, 13 different peptides were selected to be tested in vitro
(Table 1, and Supplementary Figure 1).

In vitro assessment of the identified peptides.
The 13 identified peptides were tested in in vitro chemotaxis assay, to evaluate their efficacy
as inhibitors of the CXCL12/HMGB1-induced migration, on a murine cell line expressing the
human CXCR4. Our experiments showed that 4, out of 13 peptides tested, efficaciously
inhibited the enhanced migration induced by the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex
(Figure 3A). Of note, the inhibition observed using 100 µM of HBP05, HBP07, HBP08, or
HBP12 was similar or better than the one observed using glycyrrhizin at 200 µM
(Figure 3A). Further experiments performed with CXCL12 alone, showed that HBP07 and
HBP08 do not affect CXCL12-induced cell migration, while HBP05 and HBP12 inhibit the
migration induced by the chemokine alone (Figure 3B), and therefore were not used for
further experiments. HBP07 and HBP08 were then tested on primary human monocytes.
Only the HBP08 significantly blocked the activity of the heterocomplex (Figure 3C), without
altering the migration induced by CXCL12 alone (Figure 3D), and exhibited no toxicity on
both cell types (data not shown).

Selective activity of the HBP08 peptide
In the extracellular space oxidized HMGB1, through the binding to TLR4, activates the NFkB pathway and induces the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines.12, 15 In order
to determine whether HBP08 was a selective inhibitor of the activity of the
CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex or could also prevent the binding of HMGB1 to its
receptor TLR4, we performed a cytokine release assay on monocytes treated with HMGB1
alone, or in the presence of HBP08. Monocytes stimulation with HMGB1 induced a

significant release of IL-6 and TNF, which could be blocked by treatment with a neutralizing
antibody against TLR4 (Figure 4A, B). HBP08 did not induce IL-6 or TNF release and did
not block the HMGB1-mediated release of these cytokines. These data indicate that HBP08
selectively inhibits the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex activity, leaving HMGB1 able to
trigger TLR4.

Characterization of the HMGB1-HBP08 interaction
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) was performed to determine the affinity of HBP08 to
HMGB1, resulting in a Kd of 0.8±0.1 μM (Figure 5). The affinity of the identified peptide is
therefore two orders of magnitude higher than the reported value for glycyrrhizin
(Kd~150 µM).16 Overall, these results indicate HBP08 as the first selective and potent peptide
inhibitor of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex, developed so far.
To further characterize the interaction between HBP08 and HMGB1, we performed both
experimental and computational alanine scanning of the peptide, comparing the binding
affinities of the mutants measured by MST with the change in free energy (∆∆G) estimated
by the computational procedure implemented in BioLuminate.31, 32 (Table 2).
The comparison between the experimentally determined Kd and the predicted ΔΔG values
showed a good agreement. Out of the four mutations with the highest positive binding ∆∆G
value predicted (HBP08-Ala3, HBP08-Ala6, HBP08-Ala7 and HBP08-Ala9), three showed a
clear decrease in the affinity for HMGB1 measured by MST (HBP08-Ala3, HBP08-Ala7 and
HBP08-Ala9). A high positive ∆∆G was estimated also for HBP08-Ala6, in which an
arginine residue is mutated in alanine, however this change resulted in a poorly soluble
peptide which affinity could be not determined by MST. Concerning the other HBP08
residues, for which smaller binding ∆∆G were predicted, their Kd values resulted similar to
the value measured for HBP08.

Finally, we also tested the affinity of two peptides formed by the first (pentapept-1) or the last
(pentapept-2) five residues of HBP08. Concerning pentapept-1, we did not observe binding in
the range of concentration applied to the analysis of the other peptides, while a Kd of
160±80 µM was determined for pentapept-2. In summary, both computational and
experimental analysis of the binding determinants of HBP08 indicated that the residues at the
positions 3, 7 and 9 are the most important for the binding.
To further understand the structural determinants of the individual contributions of these key
residues to the binding of the peptide, we analyzed the 3D structure of the HBP08/HMGB1
complex (Figure 6A, B). From this analysis, HBP08-Arg6 and HBP08-Trp7 form h-bond
interactions with Asp67, while HBP08-His9 establishes the same type of interaction with
Arg24. Differently, HBP08-His3 is placed in a cavity delimited by Ala17, Val20 and Arg24
and its contribution to the binding seems to be mainly due to VdW interactions.
Finally, we compared the structure of the HBP08/BoxA complex with the one of the
CXCL12/BoxA complex, obtained integrating previous NMR investigations7 and
computational modeling13 (Figure 6C). This analysis disclosed that the HBP08 binding site
on BoxA is formed by some residues Ala17, Val20, Arg24 and Glu25, important also for the
CXCL12 binding.13 Therefore, the peptide binding might antagonize by competition the
formation of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex.

HBP08 retro-inverso
L-peptides are susceptible to the action of proteolytic enzymes such as peptidases, hindering
their application in vivo. D-peptides are less prone to the action of peptidases and to the
acidic hydrolysis that occurs in the stomach, which increases their oral bioavailability and
half-live in the blood circulation. Furthermore D-peptides have a lower immunogenicity.33
Taken together, all these features make D-peptides more suitable for drug development.34

To exploit the potential of D-peptides, we investigated the binding of a retro-inverso analog
of HBP08 (HBP08-RI) made by D-amino acids in reversed order. The results of the binding
experiments indicated that HBP08-RI has a good affinity for HMGB1 (Kd = 14.0 ± 4.5 µM)
and represents, therefore, a good candidate for future drug development studies.

Discussion
Over the last years, several reports have demonstrated the relevance of the CXCL12/HMGB1
heterocomplex both in physiological and in pathological processes. Recently, the
CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex has been shown to be crucial in the perpetuation of the
chronic inflammation observed in RA, by fueling the recruitment of immune cells.8 Several
therapeutic approaches based on the use of biologic and synthetic therapies are currently in
use for the treatment of RA, but a portion of patients does not benefit of the available
treatments and only the 20-30% of them reach a low disease activity status.35, 36 Interestingly,
Pitzalis and coworkers have recently pointed out that the composition of the synovial tissue
of patients with RA can be related with the response to therapies.35
We have recently shown that the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex is present in the synovial
fluids of patients affected by RA, and that its function is maintained in patients with active
disease.8 Therefore, small molecules or peptides able to hinder the formation of this
heterocomplex could be useful as novel personalized therapeutic strategies.
Multiple attempts have been made to identify small molecules able to bind HMGB1.19 The
majority of inhibitors reported in literature so far show a weak affinity for HMGB1, and are
not selectively targeting its synergistic interaction with CXCL12.16 Recently, diflunisal has
been reported as a specific inhibitor of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex activity, without
affecting the TLR4 signaling, but its Kd for HMGB1 is only in the mM range.18

Peptides are considered a class of molecules particularly suitable to target protein-protein
interaction and they are attracting a renewed interest by medicinal chemists.37 Therefore, we
have applied a computational pipeline to design peptides able to inhibit the formation of the
CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex.
Out of the 13 candidates selected with the computational procedure, HBP08 resulted to be
able to efficiently inhibit the synergy induced by the heterocomplex on murine cells
transfected with the human CXCR4 and on human monocytes. HBP08 and its retro-inverso
version bind to HMGB1 with an affinity greater than glycyrrhizin or diflunisal, representing
new molecular tools to be exploited for further investigating in vitro and in vivo the role of
the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex in different inflammatory conditions.
Previous studies of Al-Abed and coworkers38 indicated that the TLR4 activation by HMGB1
can be inhibited by both BoxA and an anti-HMGB1 antibody (2G7) that interacts with
HMGB1 binding to the region within the residues 53-63 of BoxA.39 These results indicated
that the same region, far from those we identified for the HBP08 binding, should be
responsible of the HMGB1/TLR4 interaction, and in fact we have demonstrated that the
developed peptide does not influence the HMGB1 functions related to the TLR4 axis.
The results presented here, demonstrate how the applied computational pipeline allows the
fast and efficient design of peptides able to antagonize protein-protein interaction. We
propose its application as a novel strategy for the development of powerful inhibitors of
protein-protein complex formation.

Methods
Glycyrrhizin docking to HMGB1. A model of the HMGB1-glycyrrhizin complex was built by
ligand docking, starting from NMR HMGB1 structure available in the protein data bank with
the code 2YRQ. All the docking calculation were carried out using Glide (Schrodinger Inc.)
in the version 2016-4.40 The grid necessary to perform docking was centered in the COG
(center of geometry) of the protein and both the enclosing and the bounding box were set
bigger than entire protein, to allow a blind-docking, i.e. docking without previous knowledge
of a binding site. Standard precision (SP) mode was used to score the resulting ligand-protein
complexes.
The twenty poses with the best Glide score were kept for further investigation. Finally, the
structure with the best agreement with NMR chemical shifts perturbation (CSP) data by
Mollica et al.16 was selected as the most likely representative model of the HMGB1glycyrrhizin complex.
Computational design of binding peptides. Peptides were designed following a multistep
process. First, the model of the BoxA-glycyrrhizin complex was used to define the target
binding site for the peptides. To this end, we selected all amino acids from BoxA for which at
least a carbon atom was at a distance smaller than 7.5 Å from a glycyrrhizin carbon atom.
These gave a list of 17 amino acids, namely: LYS_12, MET_13, SER_14, SER_15, TRY_16,
ALA_17, VAL_20, GLU_21, ARG_24, GLU_25, LYS_28, SER_35, VAL_36, ASN_37,
PHE_38, PHE_41, SER_42.
Since the size of glycyrrhizin is approximatively equal to the length of a linear 9-residue
peptide we proceeded with the generation of 40,000 9-residue peptides with a random
sequence. All these peptides were then docked on the BoxA domain using the torsional
angular molecular dynamics (TMD) module41, 42 of the software package ALMOST.43

The docking of the peptides was guided by a set of 17 synthetic NMR-like ambiguous upperdistance restraints44 between the Cα atoms, , of the residues of the binding site of BoxA and

Peptide re-docking with Glide. The ability of the 100 peptides with the best CHARMM
binding energy to form complexes with the BoxA domain of HMGB1 was then additionally
assessed with the peptide-docking protocol of Glide,46 implemented in the Schrodinger suite
for molecular modeling (Version 2016-4).
Aiming to leave the algorithm free to explore the entire surface of the protein we performed,
also in this case, blind docking using a grid positioned in the center of geometry (COG) and
large enough to contain the entire BoxA.
For each peptide, the 15 best poses were saved for further analysis, resulting in a total of
1,500 peptide-BoxA complexes. The 200 complexes with the best Glide score were inspected
and, for each peptide, only the best pose conserving some of the glycyrrhizin interactions was
kept. Peptides without a glycyrrhizin-like pose in the top 200 solutions were discarded. At the
end of this process, 43 peptides were discarded and 57 retained for subsequent analysis.

Molecular dynamics (MD) and binding free energy calculations. To further asses the stability
of the 57 selected complexes and to better estimate their affinity, we performed 0.5 µs MD
simulations in explicit water using AMBER16. Snapshots from the corresponding trajectories
were extracted to compute the binding energy ∆G with MM-GBSA, a computational method
already applied in similar studies with positive results.30, 47, 48
All the peptide-BoxA complexes were solvated in a water box with a minimum distance from
the protein surface of 10 Å. The total charge of the system was neutralized adding a proper
number of Cl-/Na+ ions.
All molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the ff14SB49 force field for the
protein, the TIP3P model50 for water, and the parameters proposed by Joung et al.51 for the
counter-ions. The peptide-BoxA complexes were first relaxed with a two-step computational
protocol consisting of an energy minimization for 10,000 steps or until the energy gradient of
0.2 kcal/mol/Å2 was reached, restraining the backbone atomic coordinates with a harmonic
restraint (k = 20 kcal/mol/Å2), followed by an unrestrained energy minimization for 100,000
steps (or until an energy gradient of 0.0001 kcal/mol/Å2 was reached). The systems were then
heated to their final temperature of 300K in 40 ps. All simulations were run at constant
volume, restraining the backbone coordinates (k = 20 kcal/mol/Å2) during the first 20 ps.
Subsequently, the velocities were assigned again, and the systems equilibrated for 20ps at
constant pressure (1 Atm). Finally, all complexes were simulated for 500 ns. All the
simulations were analyzed and only those in which the peptide –BoxA complex was stable,
were retained for MM-GBSA analysis. 500 snapshots selected in the more stable part of the
simulation were used in the MM-GBSA calculations. Water molecules and counter-ions were
stripped, while the protein and the peptide were parametrized using the same force field as in
MD simulations. The polar contribution to solvation energy was computed with the Onufriev,
Bashford and Case model setting the dielectric constant to 1 for the solute and 80 for the

tested experimentally in vitro.
Computational Alanine Scanning. The difference in affinity between the mutate peptides and
HMGB1 was calculated by the residue scanning functionality of Bioluminate. Starting from
the HBP08 pose obtained by docking all residues were mutated, one at the time, to alanine.
The structure of the complex between the mutated HBP08 and HMGB1 was then refined by
the side-chain prediction and backbone minimization procedure. Finally, the change in the
binding free energy (ΔΔG) has been estimated by the Prime MM-GBSA procedure
(OPLS2005 force field53 and VSGB2.1 solvent model).31
Proteins and peptides. CXCL12 was chemically synthesized as previously.54 Histidine tagged
HMGB1 was produced at the Institute of Research in Biomedicine Protein Facility
(Bellinzona, Switzerland) as previously described,12 and stored in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; D8537, Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the peptides were customsynthesized and HPLC-purified by GenScript (New Jersey, USA). Peptides were
reconstituted with DMSO and stored at -20 ºC. HPLC-MS was used to confirm 98% or
higher purity for each peptide.
Cells. A murine 300.19 PreB cell line stably transfected with the human CXCR4 was kept in
culture in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1x non-essential amino
acids,

1 mM

Sodium

pyruvate,

20 mM

GlutaMAX,

50 µM

β-Mercaptoethanol,

50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 µg/ml Streptomycin (GIBCO). Human monocytes were freshly
isolated from buffy-coats obtained from spontaneous donation from healthy individuals
(Schweizerisches Rotes Kreuz, Basel), using positive selection with CD14 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec), as previously described.7

Chemotaxis assay. Chemotaxis was performed using Boyden chambers with 5µm pore
membranes, as previously described 55. Murine 300.19 PreB cells stably transfected with the
human CXCR4, or freshly isolated human monocytes were allowed to migrate for 90 min at
37°C in response to a sub-optimal CXCL12 concentration (1 nM), in the presence or absence
of HMGB1 (300 nM), as previously described 7. Inhibition of the synergistic activity of the
CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex was obtained by incubating CXCL12 and HMGB1 with
200 µM glycyrrhizin (Sigma Aldrich), as positive control7. All peptides, at 100 µM, were
incubated with CXCL12 and HMGB1 before assessing chemotaxis, to evaluate their ability
to interfere with the heterocomplex formation and inhibit the synergistic effect of HMGB1.
Assessment of peptides toxicity. Peptides toxicity was assessed on the murine 300.19 PreB
cell line expressing the human CXCR4, and on human monocytes. Cells were incubated for
2h in the presence of the different peptides at 100 µM, stained by AnnexinVFITC/Propidium
Iodide following manufacturer’s instructions, and cell viability analyzed by flow cytometry
in comparison to the untreated control.
Cytokines quantification. Human monocytes were incubated for 8h at 37°C at a density of
1x106 cell/ml in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.05% pasteurized human albumin in the
presence or absence of 20nM HMGB1. A polyclonal neutralizing antibody against TLR4
(AF1478, R&D System,) was used to block TLR4 engagement. HBP08 at 100 µM was tested
for its ability to inhibit HMGB1/TLR4-mediated release of cytokines. Quantification of IL1β,
IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, and TNF in the supernatants was determined by using Cytometric Bead
Array (CBA) - Human Inflammatory Cytokines Kit (551811, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA), that allows the determination of the indicated human cytokines simultaneously.
Acquisition was performed with FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and the
concentration was calculated from the MFI according to a standard curve of each cytokine.

Affinity determination by Microscale thermophoresis (MST). The binding affinity (Kd)
between HMGB1 and the HBP08 peptide was measured by microscale thermophoresis
(MST).56

Briefly, histidine tagged HMGB1 was labeled by the his-tag specific NT-647 dye (Monolith
NTTM Protein Labelling Kit RED-NHS, NanoTemper® Technologies GmbH, Munchen,
Germany), for 30 minutes at room temperature. A fixed concentration of labeled HMGB1
(20nM) was mixed with 16 1:1 serial dilution of the HBP08 peptide (range 5mM-0.15 nM).
The protein and the peptide were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, to allow
binding. MST analysis was performed using premium-coated capillary tubes on a
NanoTemper instrument using the following experimental settings: LED power of 5% (for
fluorescence excitation), and laser power 40% (to create temperature gradient). Kd values
were

calculated

from

compound concentration-dependent

changes

in normalized

fluorescence (Fnorm).
At least two independent experiments were performed to calculate the Kd values. Data were
analyzed by the NanoTemper analysis software.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance between more than two groups was calculated
by using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multicomparisons test or two-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multicomparisons test.
