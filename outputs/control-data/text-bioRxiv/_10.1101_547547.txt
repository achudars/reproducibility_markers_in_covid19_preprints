Abstract
Background: Sclerocornea is a rare congenital disorder characterized with cornea
opacification. We identified a heterozygous missense RAD21 variant in a nonconsanguineous Chinese family with multiple peripheral sclerocornea patients spanning
across three generations inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Methods: Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were conducted on all 14 members.
Whole exome sequencing was used to identify the genetic alterations in the affected pedigree
members. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established using blood samples from all
members. Cleavage of RAD21 protein was quantified in these cell lines.

Results: All affected individuals showed features of scleralization over the peripheral cornea
of both eyes. Mean horizontal and vertical corneal diameter were significantly decreased in
the affected members. Significant differences were also observed on mean apex pachymetry
between affected and unaffected subjects. A RAD21C1348T variant was co-segregated with
affected members. Both the wild-type allele and the missense variant were expressed at the
mRNA level. This variant caused RAD21 R450C substitution at the separase cleavage site,
which led to reduced RAD21 cleavage.

Conclusion: We believe this is the first report of genetic variant in sclerocornea without other
syndromes. Further work is needed to confirm the RAD21R450C variant with sclerocornea.

Sclerocornea is a rare corneal opacification disease. The transition between the sclera and
cornea is indistinct in sclerocornea cases (1, 2). If the opaque area is too larger to affect
vision, corneal transplantation is the only way to restore vision in sclerocornea patients.
Given the shortage of cornea for transplantation and the high failure rate of keratoplasty for
young children (3), better understanding of the disease mechanism of sclerocornea is needed
so that alternative treatments can be developed.
Cohesin is comprised of two structural maintenance of chromosomes subunits, SMC1 and
SMC3, and a kleisin subunit RAD21 to form a ring-structure protein complex that encircles
sister chromatids and prevents premature sister chromatid separation (4, 5). At centromeres
and telomeres, before the onset of anaphase, the active separase cleaves RAD21
proteolytically after the arginine at positions 172 (Arg172) and 450 (Arg450) (6). These
cleavages on RAD21 open the cohesin complex to allow sister chromatid separation. Rad21
has been found to be highly expressed in both postnatal developing cornea and adult cornea
in mice compared with other ocular tissues, suggesting potential roles of Rad21 in cornea
development and cornea diseases (7).
In this study, we identified a Chinese family with multiple peripheral sclerocornea patients
spanning three generations. We discovered a heterozygous variant at one of the separase
cleavage sites of RAD21, R450C, associated with peripheral sclerocornea. And this variant
led to reduced separase cleavage of RAD21.

measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometer and optic disc assessment were performed
(Table 1). Axial lengths were determined with IOL Master V.5 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, USA).
Corneal topography, pachymetry, anterior chamber depth, and anterior chamber angle were
assessed using a Casia SS-1000 swept source OCT (Tomey, Japan). Retinal nerve fiber layer
was evaluated with a Cirrus HD-OCT spectral domain OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec). Fasting
serum lipid profile was performed for all 14 members who attended the clinic.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
WES analysis (Macrogen) was performed in four affected cases and two unaffected cases.
Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and
exome DNA was enriched with an Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 kit (Agilent
Technologies, USA). Paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq 4000
(Supplementary Table 1 and 2).
To identify functional variants that were associated with sclerocornea, raw sequencing reads
were mapped onto human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)
(8) (Supplementary Table 3). Both SAMtools (9) and Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (10)
were used to call SNPs and indels. Around 77,000 variants were obtained for each case.
Among all the variants, 28,593 variants that appeared in all the four affected members were
filtered using an in-house pipeline to obtain 3,744 variants within protein coding regions.
2,838 variants were excluded since two unaffected members also carried them. Remaining

variants were further filtered using the autosomal dominant disease model, the dbSNP135
and the 1000 Genomes datasets to exclude population associated variants. Since sclerocornea
is a rare disease, a minor allele frequency threshold at 0.0001 was applied to obtain 15 rare
variants. Published data were used to further examine these 15 variants (11). 5 nonsynonymous SNPs were excluded since they appeared in a Han Chinese control group of 190
unrelated controls who had received comprehensive ophthalmological examinations and
showed no features of sclerocornea. 15 candidate variants were obtained and summarized in
Supplementary Table 1.

Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)
Fresh blood was collected and lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare,
USA). Lymphocytes were transformed with B95-8 Epstein-Barr virus (ATCC, ATCC)
according to the described protocol (12). 2µg/mL cyclosporin A (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was
added to the culture medium until cells formed a rosette morphology. LCLs were cultured
with Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum,
100U/mL penicillin and 100μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, USA) at 37 ºC in a 95% air-5%
CO2 incubator.

LCLs characterization
Allele specific gene expression analysis was conducted with data from RNA sequencing
(Macrogen, South Korea). Western blot was conducted with anti-RAD21 antibody (ab42522,
Abcam, UK) and goat anti-rabbit antibody (sc-2004, Santa Cruz, USA). GAPDH (G9295,
Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control.

A Chinese peripheral sclerocornea pedigree spanning three generations
A non-consanguineous Chinese family with peripheral sclerocornea was identified from the
Hong Kong Eye Hospital. 8 cases (6 males and 2 females) of peripheral sclerocornea
spanning across 3 generations were found in this family (Figure 1A). Fourteen members were
examined with slit-lamp and 6 cases (I-1, II-1, II-2, II-3, III-1 and III-5) were identified to
have peripheral sclerocornea (Figure 1B). Two additional cases in the third generation were
identified to have peripheral sclerocornea solely based on histories. All affected subjects had
bilateral sclerocornea. The degree of peripheral scleralization was similar in both eyes,
despite the variations that existed among individuals. Peripheral sclerocornea was not noted
in the examined unaffected subjects (II-4, II-5, III-6, III-8, III-9, III-10, III-11 and III-12). For
all 14 members, the overall mean±standard deviation and median age was 38.9±21.6 years
(range: 10-87 years) and 34.5 years respectively. Comparing the affected and unaffected
members, the mean age was 54.0±20.6 years (range: 26-87 years; median 53.5 years) and
27.6±14.8 years (range: 10-50 years; median 25.5 years) respectively (p=0.020). In the
affected subjects, two members (II-1 and II-3) had cataract and one member (I-1) had agerelated macular degeneration.

Corneal diameter was influenced by peripheral sclerocornea
11 of the 14 members had best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥20/30 in either eye. Three
affected members had BCVA of < 20/30. The mean logMAR BCVA was 0.17±0.22 (range:
0–0.7) for all the 14 members of the family. Only myopia or mild hypermetropia was noted.
The spherical equivalent ranged from -15.0D to +2.5D for all the 14 members. Comparing
the affected and unaffected subjects, the mean spherical equivalent was -4.70±5.97 diopters
for the 6 affected members and -1.57±2.89 diopters for the 7 unaffected members (p=0.138).
The mean horizontal and vertical corneal diameter for the affected subjects was 8.7±1.4mm

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/547547; this version posted March 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

and 6.6±1.7mm, respectively. The corresponding diameter was 11.6±0.4mm and
10.6±0.5mm for the unaffected subjects. Significant differences in both horizontal and
vertical corneal diameter were observed between affected and unaffected family members
(p=0.013 and p=0.001 for horizontal and vertical diameter, respectively).
In all the 14 members, there were no corneal endothelial guttate, deep central corneal stromal
opacities, iris abnormalities, iridocorneal adhesion or shallow anterior chamber. Anterior
chamber and angle analysis did not reveal any abnormality (Figure 1B). An open angle was
identified in all cases. The intraocular pressure of both affected and unaffected subjects was
comparable; the corresponding mean value was 14.6±1.1mmHg (range, 12 to 18mmHg) and
16.3±1.3mmHg (range, 14 to 19mmHg) (p=0.073) respectively. There were no features of
glaucoma either on optic disc assessment or retinal nerve fiber layer evaluation.

Mean apex pachymetry differs significantly between the affected and unaffected
members
The keratometric readings of the 6 affected subjects ranged from 41.9 to 46.5 diopters (mean,
44.1±0.9 diopters), while the readings of the unaffected 7 subjects ranged from 42.7 to 46.2
diopters (mean, 44.8±1.0 diopters) (Figure 1C) (p=0.153). III-9 was excluded in this analysis
because of the previous bilateral laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). The
keratometry readings of affected subjects were within normal range and were not different
from the unaffected subjects of the same family (Table 1). The mean preoperative
keratometry for the affected subject who underwent bilateral cataract surgery (I-1) was 46.5D
for right eye and 44.5D for left eye whereas the postoperative mean keratometry values were
47.3D for right eye and 45.2D for left eye. The mean apex pachymetry of the 6 affected
members was 471±39μm and the corresponding value of the unaffected members was
561±19μm, which differed significantly (p=0.003). The mean anterior chamber depths were

2.60±0.60mm and 3.11±0.25mm for the affected and unaffected members, respectively (p =
0.013). Axial length of the affected subjects varied between 22.39 and 28.86mm (mean,
24.67±2.14mm), while the axial length of the unaffected subjects ranged from 21.92 to 26.60
mm (mean, 24.29±1.56mm) (p=0.796). None of the family members had mental deficits,
metabolic syndromes or systemic abnormalities except for hypertension in 3 cases. Serum
lipid profile was normal for all 14 cases. The average keratometry and axial length in the
affected subjects were not particularly hypermetropic as expected in cornea plana (13).

Co-segregation of heterozygous variant RAD21 c.C1348T with peripheral sclerocornea
in the pedigree
We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in four affected (I-1, II-1, II-2, II-3) and two
unaffected (II-4, II-5) members (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1, 2 and 3). By using a
stepwise filtering method, 15 rare candidate variants from 10 genes were obtained
(Supplementary Table 1). Among these 15 variants, the missense variant RAD21 c.C1348T
(p.R450C) showed complete co-segregation with the peripheral sclerocornea in the pedigree.
Sanger sequencing results confirmed that the affected members carry both wild-type and
variants (Figure 2A).

RAD21 variant was less prone to separase mediated cleavage
The Arg450 is one of the two separase cleavage sites on RAD21, we thus examined whether
the R450C variant would affect the separase cleavage on RAD21. We found that the RAD21
c.C1348T allele counted for 55% and 52% of the total RAD21 expression levels in the
affected member II-2 and II-3, respectively, whereas unaffected LCLs only express the wildtype allele. To examine whether the heterozygous RAD21 R450C variant could influence the
separase cleavage on RAD21, we used a commercial antibody to detect the 31.5kDa RAD21
fragment (amino acid 172-450) generated by separase cleavages on Arg172 and Arg450 in
LCLs. Although the full-length protein levels of RAD21 show no difference between the
affected and unaffected LCLs (Figure 2B), the RAD21172-450 protein levels were lower in the
affected group than that in the unaffected group, suggesting less separase cleavage on the
RAD21 C450 site (Figure 2B).

Discussion

In this study, we performed systematic ophthalmic exams on 14 family members of this
pedigree. The results showed that all affected members have non-transparent corneal rim and
other features of peripheral sclerocornea. These clinical results indicated that peripheral
sclerocornea of this pedigree is not complicated with other syndromes, thus allowing us to
identify molecular causes for peripheral sclerocornea.
Although a few familial hereditary sclerocornea were reported (14, 15), sclerocorneaassociated gene mutations have only been reported in individual sclerocornea patients. For
example, heterozygous mutations in RAX were found in a single unilateral anophthalmia and
sclerocornea case (16). Mutations in FOXE3 were reported to cause anterior segment ocular
dysgenesis, including sclerocornea, microphthalmia, aphakia and absence of iris (17, 18).
Mutations at the chromosomal locus Xp22.3 were associated with a X-chromosome linked
sclerocornea, microphthalmia and dermal aplasia syndrome (19). Although these mutations
were reported associated with sclerocornea, clinical outcomes of these mutations are
complicated with other syndromes. In addition to rs1051321465 (R450H), RAD21 R450C
has been included as rs130282588 in the dbSNP database. However, neither population nor
clinical association was reported with these two SNPs.
RAD21 contains two reported separase cleavage sites and mutations of these two sites to
alanine would lead to sister chromatids mis-segregation, cell cycle defects and aneuploidy (6).
The variant identified in our pedigree is located on Arg450, one of the two separase cleavage
sites and our Western blotting result revealed less separase cleavage product on the RAD21
carrying this variant, suggesting R450C affects separase cleavage. Further studies and
additional patients will be useful for defining the genotype-phenotype correlations.

Figures
Figure 1 A. The pedigree of a family showing autosomal dominant inherited peripheral
sclerocornea. Black and white indicate affected and unaffected members respectively,
whereas squares and circles represent male and female respectively. Roman numbers indicate
the generations and Arabic numbers show the family members who gave consent to clinical
exams and genetic analysis. B. Photographs of the eyes from three affected members (II-1, II2, II-3) and one unaffected individual (II-5). In the eyes of affected members, white regions
were observed on the periphery of corneas, indicating the peripheral sclerocornea. These
white regions were not observed in the unaffected eye. Anterior segment imaging with the
swept source anterior segment OCT in selected family members (II-1, II-2, II-3, and II-5).
Only horizontal section images of each subject are shown. No abnormality of the anterior
chamber angle is found in affected and unaffected individuals. C. Corneal topography of
selected family members. Keratometry readings are shown on the corneas and represented by
color codes as shown on the right. Top left: the image for the left eye image of II-1 (affected
subject); Top right: The left eye image of II-2 (affected subject); Bottom left: The image for

Figure 2 A. Sanger sequencing spectra of RAD21 alleles in affected and unaffected members.
In the locus, the affected sample (II-2) showed two sequencing peaks, indicating both signals
of dC and dT. The unaffected sample (II-4) showed only one peak of dC. B. Total protein
extracts were analyzed using Western blotting. The intensities of the separase cleaved
RAD21 bands decreased in affected members. Normalized levels of cleaved RAD21 relative
to that of II-5 are shown under the Western blot image. Protein levels of the full-length
RAD21 were comparable. GAPDH is shown as loading controls.
