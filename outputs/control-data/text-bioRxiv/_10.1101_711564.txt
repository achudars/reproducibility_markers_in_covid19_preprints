Abstract
Blood flow in an artery is a fluid-structure interaction problem. It is widely accepted
that aneurysm formation, enlargement and failure are associated with wall shear stress
(WSS) which is exerted by flowing blood on the aneurysmal wall. To date, the combined
effect of aneurysm size and wall elasticity on intra-aneurysm (IA) flow characteristics,
particularly in the case of side-wall aneurysms, is poorly understood. Here we propose a
model of three-dimensional viscous flow in a compliant artery containing an aneurysm
by employing the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann-finite element method. This
model allows to adequately account for the elastic deformation of both the blood vessel
and aneurysm walls. Using this model, we perform a detailed investigation of the flow
through aneurysm under different conditions with a focus on the parameters which may
influence the wall shear stress. Most importantly, it is shown in this work that the use
of flow velocity as a proxy for wall shear stress is well justified only in those sections of
the vessel which are close to the ideal cylindrical geometry. Within the aneurysm
domain, however, the correlation between wall shear stress and flow velocity is largely
lost due to the complexity of the geometry and the resulting flow pattern. Moreover, the
correlations weaken further with the phase shift between flow velocity and transmural
pressure. These findings have important implications for medical applications since wall
shear stress is believed to play a crucial role in aneurysm rupture.

Introduction

1

Brain aneurysms lead to almost 500,000 deaths per year [1]. Physiological flows, such as
arterial blood flow, are generally characterized by the transport of fluids in compliant
tubes [2], which involves complex fluid-structure interaction problems. The interplay of
hemodynamics and elastic arterial vessel walls (e.g. through wall shear stress (WSS)
and blood pressure) is believed to play a central role in the aneurysm initiation, growth
and rupture [3–7].
It is known that abnormal WSS drives degradation of the vascular wall [8–10]. Flow
velocity is one of the principal factors determining the magnitude of WSS. Compared
with WSS, in practice, flow velocity is easier to be measured and often acts as a proxy
observable for WSS [11–13]. In this work, we study how size, elastic deformation of the
aneurysm and the waveform of transmural pressure determine the connection between
flow velocity and wall shear stress as an important hemodynamic factor.

Aneurysms can be classified into two major categories: fusiform and saccular
aneurysms; the latter is the most common type of aneurysm and the type most prone to
rupture [14]. The saccular aneurysm has two subtypes: end-wall and side-wall
aneurysms [15].
Intra-aneurysm (IA) hemodynamics is sensitive to morphological factors such as
shape and size of the aneurysm [16–19]. It has been reported that an increase of
aneurysm size leads to a decrease of the average IA flow velocity, U , and wall shear
stress, σw , in the case of side-wall-type aneurysms [20, 21]. In these studies, the
aneurysm wall is assumed to be rigid [20] or modeled as a stiff hyperelastic wall [21]. To
date, however, the effect of wall elasticity and the resulting deformation is poorly
studied.
Another objective of this work, therefore, is to investigate the combined effect of
aneurysm size and wall softness on the variations of the average IA flow velocity and
WSS, centering on the side-wall-type aneurysm.
We model the interaction of hemodynamics and wall elasticity in an idealized
aneurysm using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the fluid flow, the finite
element method (FEM) for the thin-walled vessel dynamics and the immersed boundary
method (IBM) for the fluid-structure interaction.
The paper is organized as follows. The physical model is introduced in Sect Physical
model. The numerical methods are presented in Sect Numerical methods, and
benchmark tests are shown in Sect Validation. Simulation results using a curved artery
with a side-wall aneurysm are presented and discussed in Sect Results and discussion,
with a particular focus on the effect of aneurysm softness on IA hemodynamics. Our
work is concluded in Sect Conclusion.

Aneurysms occur in different sizes and shapes, and their detailed properties depend on
the subject and progression state. According to [20, 21], the trends of the variations of
flow velocity and wall shear stress due to the effect of aneurysm size are not specific to
any particular side-wall aneurysm geometry. Therefore, after benchmark studies of flow
through a straight cylindrical channel (Fig 1a), we use a representative model of a
curved artery segment including a simple side-wall aneurysmal dome (Fig 1b and 1c).
Without losing generality, this approach is similar to the simplification used in studies
of the end-wall aneurysms [24–26].
Vascular tissues are generally heterogeneous. Healthy arterial walls are normally
strain-hardening due to the existence of collagen fiber constituents; aneurysms, however,
often exhibit strain-softening behavior [27–30]. The arterial wall in our model is,
therefore, divided into different regions (Fig 1b and 1c) with different constitutive laws.
Similar to Charalambous et al. [31], we employ the strain-hardening Skalak (SK)
model [23] for the healthy arterial wall:

strain invariants depending on the local principal in-plane stretch ratios λ1 and λ2 as
I1 = λ21 + λ22 − 2 and I2 = λ21 λ22 − 1.
The vessel wall is represented as a two-dimensional surface with zero thickness.
However, one important effect closely related to a finite vessel wall thickness is
resistance to bending. In order to account for this property in our membrane model, we
explicitly introduce a local bending energy with a bending constant κb , which can then
give rise to forces normal to the wall (for further details, please refer to [32]).
The two free parameters κα and κb are related to the Young’s modulus E, wall

study versus a 3D model. Obviously, the inverse mapping from a two-parameter model
to a three-parameter one is not unique. This is not necessarily a drawback. Rather, it
enhances the generic character of our model and allows the results obtained within these
simulations to be transferred to vessels with different materials properties and wall
thickness.
The transmural pressure P tr is the pressure difference between the mean arterial
pressure and the intracranial pressure. It is generally believed that, given heterogeneity
of elastic properties along the arterial wall, P tr is mainly responsible for the wall
deformation and plays a crucial role in the progress of aneurysm growth as well as
failure. Therefore, the transmural pressure needs to be taken into account in our model.
Although blood is non-Newtonian, it is often treated as an incompressible Newtonian
fluid (e.g., [20, 21, 34–37]). Since the focus of this work is on the basic understanding of
the effect of aneurysm size and softness rather than making accurate predictions, we
model blood as a homogeneous Newtonian fluid with constant dynamic viscosity η.
Finally, we can assume the no-slip velocity boundary condition at the wall.

Wall shear stress (WSS) is a crucial factor for the development of aneurysms. The fluid
stress tensor includes pressure (isotropic stress) and viscous contributions (deviatoric
stress):
Tαβ = −pδαβ + σαβ
(5)
where p denotes pressure and σ the viscous stress tensor. The traction vector τ is the
projection of the stress tensor onto the wall normal n:
τα = Tαβ nβ .

Note that the projection of the normal stress −pδαβ onto the tangential is zero,
therefore σw is a function of σ, but not a function of p.

where Re = 2ρU R/η is the Reynolds number and ρ is the fluid density. Note that in
normal arteries, U ≈ 0.3 m/s and P tr ≈ 10 kPa, and, therefore, both viscous and
inertial wall deformation effects are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the
transmural pressure contribution. This is in line with previous reports that the axial
motion of vascular walls is negligibly small [38, 39]. We can therefore safely assume that
deformation of the vessel wall is mainly due to the action of transmural pressure, rather
than flow.

method has previously been applied to suspensions of deformable red blood cells [40–42].

The transmural pressure P tr is known to be one of the main factors dominating the
enlargement and rupture of aneurysms [44–46]. There are basically two ways of
modeling the transmural pressure. The most obvious one is to treat the transmural
pressure as different pressures on either side of the arterial wall. This approach,
however, poses a major challenge when combined with the immersed boundary method.
We follow an alternative approach, introducing a transmural-pressure-based force F tp
acting on each facet i along its normal direction:
F tp i = P tr Ai ni

where κsp represents the spring constant, i denotes those vertices forming the open ends
of the vessel segment and ∆xi is the displacement of these vertices from their desired
positions.

In addition to parameters such as maximum pressure difference along the blood vessel,
which drives the flow, and size as well as flexibility of the aneurysm, the dynamics of the
aneurysm wall may also strongly influence the IA flow field and thus lead to significant
variations of the wall shear stress. In order to address this aspect, we will monitor the
rate of variation of the elastic energy and investigate its correlations with WSS. The
rate of elastic energy variation due to fluid-wall interactions can be calculated as

In order to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we employ a standard
LBM on a D3Q19 lattice with the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator for
improved stability and accuracy [47–49]. Forces are included according to the Guo’s
forcing scheme [50]. The viscous stress tensor is computed from the non-equilibrium
populations according to [51].
Peskin’s IBM is used to couple the arterial wall and fluid dynamics [52]. Elastic
forces calculated for each vertex i are spread to surrounding lattice nodes where they
are used as input for the LBM. After the updated fluid velocity field has been obtained,
fluid velocities are interpolated at the vertex positions via IBM. A tri-linear stencil with
23 lattice nodes for each vertex is used during spreading and interpolation. The
forward-Euler scheme is used to update all vertex positions. Further details can be
found in [32].

where Ai is the current area of facet i and ni the outward facing unit normal vector of
the facet. F tp acts as a pressure drop across the wall without the necessity of having
different pressures on either side of the wall in the numerical model. Note that F tp
tends to dilate the artery if P tr is positive. We emphasize that the transmural pressure
has to be imposed, and it is generally a function of time: P tr (t). Fluid dynamics inside
the deforming artery leads to additional spatio-temporal pressure fluctuations. This
means that the local pressure drop across the arterial wall consists of a homogeneous
term P tr (t) and a fluctuating term P fluc which emerges from the simulation.
The fourth force contribution is a spring force F sp which is used to tether the ends
of the artery:

A body force F along the axis of the tube is applied on all fluid nodes inside the tube
to drive the flow. For Poiseuille flow, F is equivalent to the constant pressure gradient

extrapolation-based correction scheme is necessary to reach good agreement near the
wall. The velocity and stress in direct wall vicinity are affected by the diffuse nature of
the immersed boundary method. The basic idea behind the correction scheme is to
enforce the no-slip condition in the diffuse interface IBM [54]. Specifically, fluid velocity
and stress at the fluid nodes near the wall (i.e., at |r/R∗ | = 11/11.035 in Fig 2 and
Fig 3) are corrected using a second-order Lagrange extrapolation from corresponding
information of their extrapolation points (i.e., at |r/R∗ | = 10/11.035, 9/11.035 and
8/11.035). For general geometries, the extrapolation points may be off lattice lines. In
such cases, fluid quantities (denoted by f ) on each extrapolation node are computed by
a linear
P interpolation
P of information at neighboring lattice nodes as
f = ( i fi /`i )/( i 1/`i ) where `i indicates the distance between the extrapolation
node and its neighboring lattice node i. For the sake of stability, when the extrapolation
point is very close to a lattice node (e.g., ` < 0.0001), the value at that node is taken
(f = fi ). With this correction approach, the maximum relative L2 error of the shear
stress σ is reduced from 31.2% to 2.2% in the Poiseuille flow and from 32.7% to 3.5% in
the Womersley flow.
Note that the wall location as recovered from the simulation is not exactly where it
is expected to be. Due to the diffuse nature of the IBM, the location of zero velocity (as
obtained from a quadratic extrapolation from the interior solution) is shifted with
respect to the location of the Lagrangian markers. We treated the tube radius as fit
parameter to obtain the best agreement with the simulated velocity profile. For our
simulation parameters the apparent tube radius is R∗ = 11.035∆x compared to the
input value of R = 11.459∆x. Similar deviations have been reported in the
literature [55–57] and are acceptably small.

In order to show that the numerical model can faithfully reproduce flow in flexible
three-dimensional geometries, we simulate steady flow in an elastic tube with a circular
cross section (Fig 1a). In contrast to the steady Poiseuille flow, we consider the
transmural pressure and the radial deformation of the tube walls. We use the
well-developed software SimVascular [58] to generate reference results. SimVascular
employs a simple linear elastic model for the walls.
To compare results from two different software tools, we need to ensure that the
material models and properties used are identical. SimVascular requires the Young’s
modulus E, the wall thickness d, and the Poisson ratio ν as input parameters. In the
present model, the input parameters are the surface elastic shear modulus κs , the area
dilation modulus κα , and the bending modulus κb . Both sets of parameters are related
according to Eq (3) and Eq (4). For the sake of stability of simulations with a certain
resolution, small values of Young’s modulus E and transmural pressure P tr are utilized.
Nevertheless, it is Cp , rather than P tr or E alone, that dominates the wall deformation.
Typical values used in SimVascular are E = 0.05 MPa, d = 0.15 mm and ν = 0.45. To
match these parameters we set κs = 0.025, κα = 0.025 and κb = 0.002 in simulation
units. The other simulation parameters are listed in Table 1. The length-diameter
aspect ratio of the tube is 7.5. In all simulations, the ends of the tube are tethered and
thus the deformation is not homogeneous along the tube axis; the radial displacements
are zero at the ends and maximum in the middle region where the diametric strains
(∆R/R) are measured.
The combined effect of transmural pressure and elasticity on wall deformation is
expressed by the dimensionless parameter Cp , see Eq (10). We vary Cp by changing the
transmural pressure P tr in the present test case. Specifically, P tr varies from 5.1 Pa to
153.2 Pa (i.e., 0.0001 ≤ Cp ≤ 0.003) in SimVascular simulations. Correspondingly, P tr
in our model ranges from 3.3 · 10−6 to 1 · 10−4 in simulation units. The radial strain

velocity ux and shear stress σ are compared with the analytical steady solution of
Poiseuille flow (black lines). Green squares and red circles, respectively, denote results
without and with the extrapolation-based correction scheme. The data are taken along
the z-coordinate axis. The difference is visible near the walls (r/R∗ → 1) and is caused
by the diffuse nature of the immersed boundary method. In particular the shear stress
benefits from the correction scheme.
∆R/R of the wall is linearly proportional to Cp in SimVascular simulations due to the
underlying linear elastic model. In order to investigate the strain-hardening behavior of
the tube in the present model, five additional simulations with P tr up to 6.5 · 10−4 in
simulation units are carried out.
We find that simulation results using our model compare well with those obtained
from SimVascular within the small strain regime (Fig 4a). In the large strain range,
however, the strain-softening and strain-hardening features of the Neo-Hookean and
Skalak models, respectively, become dominant and deviate from the behavior of the
linear elastic model used in SimVascular.
Our simulation results also compare well with the so-called tube law (Fig 4b). In

Fig 4. Benchmark of the elastic wall model. (a) The diametric strain, ∆R/R,
versus Cp (the ratio of transmural pressure to Young’s modulus). SimVascular uses a
linear elastic model and thus predicts ∆R/R ∝ Cp . We use both the strain-hardening
Skalak law and the strain-softening neo-Hookean model for the straight circular tube
(Fig 1a). The parameters of these models are related via Eqs (3) and (4). As seen from
the inset, in the limit of small strains (∆R/R ≤ 0.1), these models produce the same
linear behavior. (b) Validation of the model used in this work with the analytical result
of reference [60]. The plot shows transmural pressure P tr (normalized by Kp ) as a
function of the cross-sectional area A (normalized by A0 ). As expected, simulation
results using the Skalak model are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction,
Eq (21).

Characteristic parameters

Blood and artery properties show variations among patients, but reference values based
on a reasonable number of measurements have been reported. In general, the radius R
of the cerebral artery ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 mm [21, 61, 62]. Young’s modulus E and
Poisson’s ratio ν of the healthy cerebral artery are approximately 1–2 MPa and 0.45,
respectively [21, 63]. The wall thickness is between 0.03 and 0.2 mm in most aneurysms,
and is here assumed to be uniform and 0.15 mm, as adopted by [63]. There is no
uniform ideal value for the transmural pressure P tr . However, its range lies roughly
between 50 and 70 mmHg (i.e., between 6.7 and 9.3 kPa). Blood density ρ and dynamic
viscosity η are within the range of 1–1.06 g/cm3 and 3–4 mPa s, respectively [21, 63].
The flow velocity u in cerebral arteries ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 m/s, and those in the
common carotid and middle cerebral arteries are approximately 0.4 and 0.6 m/s,
respectively [64–67].
In order to better highlight the effects arising from the interplay between elasticity,
complex geometry and the time-dependent forces acting on the wall and on the fluid, it
is useful to express physical quantities in such a way that trivial effects such as
quadratic dependence of the maximum flow velocity and the linear dependence of
maximum shear stress on tube radius as well as their linear dependence on the applied
pressure gradient are “divided out”. A way to achieve this goal is to divide the
quantities of interest such as flow velocity, u, wall shear stress, σw , and viscous
dissipation rate, φ̇, by their corresponding characteristic values in a straight cylindrical
∗
channel subject to a stationary Poiseuille flow, u∗ , σw
and φ̇∗ . Throughout the paper,
we will use the following reference values to make the corresponding quantities
∗
dimensionless: u∗ = −p0 R2 /(4η) = 0.355 m/s, σw
= −p0 R/2 = 1.42 Pa, and

φ̇ = (σw ) /(2η) = 252 W/m . In this estimate, we used the values of the mean
pressure gradient, p0 = 14.2 Pa/cm (Fig 5), vessel radius, R = 2 mm and dynamic blood
viscosity, η = 4 · 10−3 Pa s.

Simulation setup

302

We consider pulsatile flow in seven different cases:

303

1. Reference channel: straight cylindrical artery (Fig 1a) with elastic Young’s
modulus E0 = 2 MPa. In the following, we will refer to this choice of E0 as the
“Normal Elastic” (NE) case.

305
306

2. LA/stiff: large aneurysm (Fig 1b) with P tr = 0

307

3. LA/NE: large aneurysm (Fig 1b) with normal elasticity E0

308

4. LA/RE: large aneurysm (Fig 1b) with reduced elasticity E0 /3

309

5. SA/stiff: small aneurysm (Fig 1c) with P tr = 0

310

6. SA/NE: small aneurysm (Fig 1c) with normal elasticity E0

311

7. SA/RE: small aneurysm (Fig 1c) with reduced elasticity E0 /3

312

The initial (equilibrium) volume of the large aneurysm is approximately twice as large
as that of the small aneurysm. The cases with zero transmural pressure mimic nearly
rigid walls and allow to focus on the effects of size and deformability separately. All
relevant parameter values used in the following simulations are given in Table 2.
Pulsatile flow is generated by applying a time-dependent body force (equivalent to
the pressure gradient p0 ) at the inlet. The transmural pressure is applied on the entire
wall. In reality, it is challenging to obtain both pressure gradient (or flow velocity) and
transmural pressure waveforms from the same underlying mechanism (heart beat).
Therefore, they are fed separately into the present model.
In practice, fluid velocity is often used as a proxy observable for wall shear
stress [11–13]. While obvious in the case of a straight cylindrical channel, the complex
shape of the aneurysm and its deformability introduce new aspects whose effects on the
connection between flow velocity and wall shear stress needs a thorough investigation.
Here, we address this issue via two different classes of spatially and temporally resolved
simulations using the present hybrid model.

1. First we employ realistic waveforms (Fig 5) for both the pressure gradient and the
transmural pressure. Given the chosen input parameters, the Reynolds,
Womersley and Cp values inside the parent artery region with normal elasticity
are approximately 350, 3 and 0.005, respectively. Within the aneurysm dome, the
Reynolds number is almost 10 times smaller and Cp changes according to the
variation of aneurysmal wall elasticity.
2. In the second class of simulations, to simplify the analysis, we assume sinusoidal
waveforms for the pressure gradient, p0 (t) = p0 (0) sin(2πt/T ), and the transmural
pressure, P tr (t) = P tr (0) sin(θ + 2πt/T ). We introduce a phase shift θ between
both waveforms in order to quantify the individual contributions of both
waveforms to the flow field.
Simulations are repeated for six cycles, which is sufficient to reach a time-periodic flow
field. In all the simulations whose results are reported below, the open ends of the blood
vessel are tethered. A body force (equivalent to pressure gradient p0 in Fig 5) is imposed
at the inlet, and periodic boundary conditions are applied along the vessel axis.

Figure 6 shows the time evolution of the space-averaged WSS and flow velocity in the
straight artery (reference case). A comparison with the imposed waveforms in Fig 5
reveals that the time evolution of the hydrodynamic observables in the reference case
basically follow the pressure gradient and transmural pressure. This is to be expected
since the straight artery does not have complex geometrical features that could affect
the flow. The average flow velocity and WSS are similar to those obtained for the
corresponding steady Poiseuille flow.
The time evolution of the intra-aneurysm (IA) WSS and flow velocity for the large
(LA) and small (SA) aneurysm cases are shown in Fig 7. Similar to the straight tube
case, the key features of the temporal variations of WSS and flow velocity stem from the
pulsatility of flow rather than the existence of the aneurysm (compare Fig 5 and Fig 7).
However, both the aneurysm size and wall softness impact the finer details of the IA
hemodynamic characteristics as will be discussed in the following.
For the small-deformation cases (normal elasticity, LA/NE and SA/NE, and
non-deformable, LA/stiff and SA/stiff), we find that the spatial average wall shear
stress, σw , and flow velocity, U , decrease with increasing the aneurysm size. In these

cases the IA flow can be approximated by flow in a rigid cavity. The larger aneurysm
has more potential to result in flow regions of recirculation and stagnation which are
generally accompanied by lower WSS. This is in line with reported results in [20]
and [21].
In real aneurysms, arterial wall stiffness may decrease due to tissue degradation. For
the softer aneurysm (cases SA/RE and LA/RE), we find that σw and U increase with
aneurysm size (solid and dashed red lines in Fig 7). Note that the size of the initially
larger aneurysm (LA) always remains larger than that of the smaller aneurysm. The
variation of aneurysm volume (i.e., volumetric strain) directly follows the time evolution
of the transmural pressure in Fig 5. The maximum volumetric strains are 61% and 86%
in the cases SA/RE and LA/RE, respectively. Apparently, the aneurysm size no longer
dominates the IA WSS and flow velocity behavior if the aneurysm is sufficiently soft.
We can, therefore, conclude that there are at least two independent mechanisms
controlling the IA flow properties: (i) size and (ii) deformability of the aneurysm dome.
Focusing on either the large or the small aneurysm, Fig 7 demonstrates that, the
softer the aneurysm, the larger the IA WSS and the flow velocity, all averaged within
the aneurysm domain. In order to gain more insight into the problem, a detailed view of
the velocity field is shown in Fig 8 for three choices of a non-deformable (rigid) wall
(indicated as stiff in the plot), a membrane with an intermediate (‘normal’) elastic
constant, E0 , and a soft aneurysm tissue with reduced elasticity. The plot shows that
the flow velocity within the soft aneurysm reaches higher values than the two other
cases. This observation may be rationalized as follows. Since the velocity of fluid at the
wall is equal to that of the wall (stick boundary condition), a rigid and immobile vessel
acts like a sink with respect to fluid momentum and thus decelerates the flow. A
deformable tissue, on the other hand, can move under the action of transmural pressure
and thus represents a less severe obstacle to the flow. In fact, depending on the phase of
the flow with respect to the motion of the membrane, a partial enhancement of the fluid
velocity is also possible. One possibility here would be that an elastic wall can store
energy during one period of a cycle and release it during a different period again. This
effect becomes stronger as the membrane softens further and its deformability increases.
Such correlation between wall softness and flow parameters may, however, be
reduced or even violated to some extent when effects of input waveforms become

From the viewpoint of energy, the effect of wall softness can be indicated by the
variation of elastic energy. The elastic energy follows the transmural pressure (Fig 9a)
since the shear and inertial contributions are relatively negligible (at least two orders of
magnitude smaller) compared with the transmural-pressure contribution. As expected,
the elastic contribution disappears in the case of a stiff wall (zero transmural pressure)
(Fig 9a).
In the case of side-wall aneurysms with realistic waveforms, we find a linear

aneurysm geometries and input signals because the hemodynamics in aneurysms is
sensitive to a number of conditions, including shape parameters such as inflow angle.
Naively, the IA WSS should follow the imposed pressure gradient. The deformation
of the aneurysm, largely caused by the transmural pressure waveform, however, modifies
the flow field in the aneurysm, which in turn affects the WSS. In order to investigate
this effect, we consider sinusoidal input waveforms for the large aneurysm (Fig 1b) in
the following.

Using sinusoidal waveforms for both pressure gradient p and transmural pressure P tr ,
together with a phase shift θ for the latter, we consider the following cases:

413
414

1. θ = −π/2: cosine-type P tr , i.e., p0 and P tr are uncorrelated

415

2. θ = 0: sine-type P tr , i.e., p0 and P tr are positively correlated

416

3. θ = π: sine-type P tr with inverse amplitude, i.e., p0 and P tr are negatively
correlated

417
418

We begin with an analysis of the flow in the parent vessel before moving on to the
aneurysmal dome. Well away from the aneurysm, flow velocity and WSS are governed
by the input pressure gradient, and the phase shift between this driving force and the
transmural pressure does not play any significant role (Fig 10). The cross-sectional
average values of the flow velocity and wall shear stress are linearly correlated in the
parent vessel (Fig 11a). There also exists a linear correlation between maximum velocity
and average WSS and between maximum velocity and maximum WSS (the
corresponding data is very similar to Fig 11a and is thus not shown). This strong
correlation is also reflected in a high Pearson correlation coefficient, which turns out to
be close to unity outside the aneurysm domain for all the investigated cases:
0.98, 0.99, 0.99 for θ = 0, −π/2 and π, respectively. Other combinations of size and
transmural pressure give similarly large correlation coefficients: 0.99 (LA/NE/θ = π),
0.96 (LA/stiff) and 0.98 (SA/stiff). For the fluid outside the aneurysm, therefore, one
can safely use the flow velocity as a proxy for wall shear stress.
Within the aneurysmal domain, however, the flow has a more complex pattern so
that a one-to-one correspondence between characteristic flow velocity and wall shear
stress is no longer ensured. This is particularly the case for different values of the phase
shift θ between pressure gradient and transmural pressure waveforms (Fig 12). From
Fig 11b it is evident that the correlation between the velocity and WSS within the
aneurysm is deteriorating with increasing phase shift angle θ. In terms of Pearson
correlation coefficient, one obtains 0.91 (θ = 0), 0.76 (θ = −π/2), 0.67 (θ = π), 0.84
(LA/NE/θ = π), 0.72 (LA/stiff) and 0.93 (SA/stiff). One contributing factor to this
deterioration is that the transmural pressure directly controls the aneurysm wall motion,
which in return affects the IA flow and WSS.
Results shown in Fig 11b also reveal effects of the aneurysm size on the correlations
between flow velocity and WSS. It can be seen from this data that the proxy role of flow
velocity as an estimate of WSS is less justified in the case of larger and more flexible
domes. This finding is of great practical importance as serious pathological cases are
often associated with large aneurysm sizes and an advanced state of degradation, which
leads to a weak elasticity and hence large deformability.

Fig 10. Time evolution of wall shear stress and flow velocity in parent
vessel. The cross-sectional averages of (a) WSS, σw , and (b) flow velocity, U , are
computed in the parent vessel region (i.e., sufficiently far from the aneurysm) and
normalized by their reference values in a circular tube (page 11). The flow is driven by a
simple sine-type pressure gradient, p0 . Transmural pressure, P tr , is also a sine wave but
has a phase shift, θ, with respect to p0 as indicated. Acronyms in the legends: SA=Small

Conclusion

449

In this work, an immersed-boundary-lattice-Boltzmann-finite-element method is
employed to simulate three-dimensional viscous flow in an elastic vessel containing a
side-wall aneurysm, with a special focus on the relevance of the aneurysm deformability.

Fig 11. Relation between wall shear stress and flow velocity. The spatial
averages of WSS, σw , and flow velocity, U , are computed (a) outside and (b) within the
aneurysmal region. Acronyms in the legends: SA=Small Aneurysm; LA=Large
Aneurysm; NE=Normal Elasticity (using E0 ); RE=Reduced Elasticity (using E0 /3)
(page 12). For fluid in the parent vessel, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the
average flow velocity and WSS in different cases are close to unity (≥ 0.95; see text for
more details). For the fluid inside the aneurysm, however, the Pearson correlation
coefficients can become as small as 0.7. The WSS σw and velocity U are normalized by

the characteristic value σw
and u∗ , respectively.
Accuracy of the method is shown through steady Poiseuille and pulsatile Womersley
flow tests in a circular rigid tube. Furthermore, the deformation behavior of an elastic
pipe under the effect of transmural pressure is studied using the present model and

Hemodynamic quantities, such as flow velocity and wall shear stress (WSS), play a
crucial role in the development and failure of aneurysms. Using the above described
simulation tool, we investigate the combined effect of aneurysm size and wall softness on
intra-aneurysm (IA) flow parameters. Under the rigid wall assumption, the IA flow
velocity and WSS decrease with increasing aneurysm size. However, the situation
becomes more complex when the aneurysm deformation becomes important.
The central result of our investigation concerns the connection between WSS and
flow velocity, the latter often used as a proxy observable to estimate the former. While
an indirect evaluation of the WSS via the flow velocity is a reliable method for regular
geometries (planar or cylindrical), the present study reveals that the correlation

between the two quantities deteriorates within the aneurysmal domain. The situation
becomes more problematic in the case of large and easily deformable aneurysms.
In aneurysms, arterial wall stiffness can significantly decrease due to tissue
degradation. This is often accompanied by an increase of the aneurysm’s size. Our
results suggest that, in such serious pathological cases, fluid velocity is no longer a
reliable proxy for WSS.
