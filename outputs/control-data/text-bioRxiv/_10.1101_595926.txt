Abstract

17

The Tibetan Plateau is an important component of the global carbon cycle due to the large

18

permafrost carbon pool and its vulnerability to climate warming. The Tibetan Plateau has

19

experienced a noticeable warming over the past few decades and is projected to continue warming

20

in the future. However, the direction and magnitude of carbon fluxes responses to climate change

21

and elevated CO2 concentration under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios in

22

the Tibetan Plateau grassland are poorly known. Here, we used a calibrated and validated

23

biogeochemistry model, CENTURY, to quantify the contributions of climate change and elevated

24

CO2 on the future carbon budget in the alpine grassland under three RCP scenarios. Though the

25

Tibetan Plateau grassland was projected a net carbon sink of 16 ~ 25 Tg C yr-1 in the 21st century,

26

the capacity of carbon sequestration was predicted to decrease gradually because climate-driven

27

increases in heterotrophic respiration (Rh) (with linear slopes 0.49 ~ 1.62 g C m-2 yr-1) was greater

28

than the net primary production (NPP) (0.35 ~ 1.52 g C m-2 yr-1). However, the elevated CO2

29

contributed more to plant growth (1.9% ~ 7.3%) than decomposition (1.7% ~ 6.1%), which could

30

offset the warming-induced carbon loss. The interannual and decadal-scale dynamics of the

31

carbon fluxes in the alpine grassland were primarily controlled by temperature, while the role of

32

precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon cycle. The strengthened

33

correlation between precipitation and carbon budget suggested that further research should

34

consider the performance of precipitation in evaluating carbon dynamics in a warmer climate

35

scenario.

1. Introduction

38

The distinctive geographic environment of the world highest plateau—Tibetan Plateau (with an

39

average elevation of over 4000 m above sea level) makes its carbon cycle be strongly sensitive to

40

climate variation and environmental change [1-3]. The Plateau covers a vast area of alpine

41

vegetation and has a large reservoir of organic carbon in the permafrost soil, and it has been

42

reported as a significant terrestrial carbon sink for recent decades due largely to warming and CO2

43

fertilization [3-5]. The Plateau has undergone significant warming during the last decades.

44

Increasing temperatures have been reported to prolong growing season lengths [6], metabolic

45

rates, and in the productivity and distribution [7] of vegetation at the Plateau and high latitude

46

areas [8-10]. Furthermore, the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) is controlled by the complex

47

processes involving accumulation of carbon input by plant production and loss through microbial

48

decomposition. Warming may also suppress plant growth by increasing evapotranspiration [11]

49

and induce the soil carbon loss through enhanced Rh [12]. Thus the carbon fluxes can be

50

amplified by increased carbon emissions from thawing permafrost [13,14]. Schaphoff et al. [15]

51

revealed that warming contributed to the net uptake of carbon in the permafrost zone in previous

52

decades because carbon uptake by vegetation increased at a faster rate than that released from soil.

53

Furthermore, increasing the atmospheric CO2 concentrations tends to stimulate photosynthesis and

54

reduce water loss [16,17], which is likely to offset the adverse effects of climate change.

55

The temperature on the Tibetan Plateau increased with a linear trend of 0.2 ºC/decade during

56

the past five decades [18,19] and is projected to continue warming in the future under different

57

representative concentration pathways (RCPs) [20,21]. Although there has been several studies on

58

the carbon cycle and climate change associated with the elevated CO2 on the Tibetan Plateau for

59

historical research and sensitivity analysis [2,3,20,22,23], there is still a lack of studies on the

60

carbon dynamic projections under different RCPs on the Plateau. Temperature has been reported

61

as the critical determinant of carbon exchange in alpine ecosystems [24,25]. The warming had

62

prolonged the alpine plant phenology [26-28] and promoted the vegetation productivity [3,29],

63

and consequently enhanced carbon inputs into the soil, offseting the carbon release from thawing

64

permafrost in the Tibetan Plateau [4]. The vegetation production on Tibetan Plateau was projected

65

to increase under future climate scenarios [7,30]. The results of field experiments, however, have

66

shown some opposite responses of vegetation productivity to warming, which varied by regions

67

[31-33]. Ganjurjav et al. [34] found that the aboveground net primary production (NPP) was

68

significantly stimulated in an alpine meadow under experimental warming, whereas it decreased

69

in an alpine steppe due to warming-induced drought. Furthermore, there are situations that the

70

climatic warming stimulated the ecosystem respiration more than NPP, which potentially led to

71

loss of soil carbon in the Tibetan Plateau [18,22,30]. This discrepant responses of NPP and

72

heterotrophic respiration (Rh) to the climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau might be quite

73

different from that in the northern high-latitude permafrost zones [15], where warming increased

74

NPP more than Rh. In previous historical period modeling studies [3,5,35], a net carbon sink has

75

been estimated for the Tibetan Plateau grassland for the 20th century, albeit with variability in

76

absolute value of 11.8 ~ 29.8 Tg C yr-1. Based on a field experiment in the Tibetan Plateau alpine

77

meadow, Zhu et al. [36] found that warming caused a seasonal shift in ecosystem carbon exchange

78

but had little impact on net carbon uptake. However, the direction and magnitude of carbon fluxes

80

Tibetan Plateau grassland remains uncertain. Thus, quantifying the influence of the future climatic

81

change on the carbon exchange in alpine ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau will promote our

82

understanding of the mechanisms in the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks.

83

In this study, we used an onsite calibrated and validated process-based model, CENTURY, to

84

explore the responses of three important carbon cycle indicators, namely NPP, Rh and net

85

ecosystem production (NEP), to future climate change projections on alpine grasslands of the

86

Tibetan Plateau. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios of the climate change

87

projections under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)

88

vary in their total radiative forcing increase by 2100 [37,38]. Three different RCP scenarios (i.e.,

89

RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were applied in this study. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to

90

predict the trends and differences in the ecosystem carbon cycle components in alpine grasslands

91

under RCP scenarios during the 21st century; and (2) to differentiate the contributions of the

92

changing climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and elevated CO2 on the future carbon

93

budget on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands.

94

2. Materials and methods

95

The CENTURY model was originally developed for the U.S. Great Plains grassland ecosystem

96

[39] and has been successfully adapted to simulate carbon fluxes under climate change across a

97

wide latitudinal gradient, from tropical to temperate to high-latitude ecosystems [40-44]. A

98

detailed description of the CENTURY model has been presented by [39,41]. The observed data

99

for parameterization of the CENTURY model included the nutrient contents in vegetation and soil

100

that were derived from the Haibei research station of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network

101

(CERN), Chinese Academy of Sciencies. The performance of the CENTURY model on the

102

Tibetan Plateau grassland has been evaluated by the observed net ecosystem exchange (NEE),

103

ecosystem respiration (Re), gross primary production (GPP) (2003 ~ 2005) obtained from the

104

Haibei flux tower observations and aboveground biomass (AGC) (2000 ~ 2012) obtained from the

105

field sampling at Haibei research station

106

autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) according to the study of [45], and

107

the net primary production (NPP) was then obtained by subtracting Ra from GPP. The site-level

108

verification from our previous study showed that the parameterized CENTURY model was able to

109

capture the carbon fluxes of alpine grassland (R2 > 0.80, Fig 1). The simulated monthly AGC

110

exhibited a good agreement with the observed data with the slope close to 1, and the intercept and

111

the root mean square error (RMSE) were less than 25 g C m-2. Compared to the eddy-covariance

112

flux data, the simulated monthly NPP and Rh were comparable to the observation with slopes

113

equal to 0.77 and 1.10, and the estimated errors of RMSE were 29.06 g C m-2 and 13.24 g C m-2,

114

respectively. The simulated NEE was also agreed well with the field observation ( R2 = 0.88,

115

RMSE = 17.94), while the seasonal amplitude of the simulated NEE was slightly higher than that

116

from the flux tower data with a slope of 0.64) [23]. We acknowledged that the model

117

parameterization was dependent on data from Haibei station, which could cause a certain degree

118

of uncertainty. This was due largely to the fact that most of the existed observations on the Plateau

119

were not long-term experiments and lacked necessary information for model calibration. At the

120

regional scale, our previous historical simulated results were comparable to other studies, with a

121

mean NPP and NEP of 259 g C m-2 yr-1 and 10 g C m-2 yr-1 from 1981 to 2010, respectively [23],

122

which was within the range of 120 ~ 340 g C m-2 yr-1 and 8 ~ 24 g C m-2 yr-1 reported by [3,5,46].

129
130

The simulation began with an equilibrium run to generate an initial condition using long-term

131

average climate data for the period from 1901~1930, which was then followed by a spin up (1980

132

~ 2005) to eliminate system fluctuations and to steady the transient simulation. The climate input

133

data for the history period of 1901 ~ 2005 was obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU)

134

Time-Series (TS) version 3.23 (TS 3.23), School of Environmental Sciences, University of East

135

Anglia, United Kingdom [49,50]. The CENTURY model was then forced with outputs from the

136

Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), including monthly maximum and

137

minimum temperature and precipitation under three RCPs scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and

138

RCP8.5). The CORDEX data used in this study were dynamical downscaled at a high spatial

139

resolution of 0.5° with two regional climate models (RCMs) of RCA4 and REMO2009 driven by

140

ICHEC-EC-EARTH and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR global models based on the Coupled Model

141

Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations [51]. The calibrated parameters for the

142

regional simulation were obtained from our previous studies on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands

[23].

3. Results

145

3.1 Temporal dynamics of the carbon budget on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands

146

Interannual variations in the grassland carbon budget on the Tibetan Plateau in response to

147

changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 over the 21st century were simulated. The CENTURY

148

model predicted that the grass NPP would range from 308 ± 13 g C m-2 yr-1 to 495 ± 21 g C m-2

149

yr-1, with a multiyear mean NPP of 357 ± 18 g C m-2 yr-1 for RCP2.6, 375 ± 20 g C m-2 yr-1 for

150

RCP4.5, and 408 ± 26 g C m-2 yr-1 for RCP8.5 on the Tibetan Plateau, respectively (Fig 2a). The

151

interannual variation in the grass NPP was projected to increase to different degrees under the

152

three RCP scenarios over the period 2006 ~ 2100, with linear slopes of 0.35 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01),

153

0.85 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01), and 1.52 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5,

154

respectively. The temporal dynamics of Rh were consistent with the NPP trends in all scenarios,

155

with mean absolute values of 346 ± 9 g C m-2 yr-1, 360 ± 12 g C m-2 yr-1, and 390 ± 19 g C m-2

156

yr-1, whereas the magnitude of the variation rates of Rh were all greater than that of NPP, with

157

slopes of 0.49 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01), 0.91 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01), and 1.62 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01) for

158

RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively (Fig 2b). These higher rates of Rh increase in all the

159

three scenarios may suggest that Rh was more sensitive to climate change than NPP. On average,

160

the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau behaved as a carbon sink, with a simulated NEP on a

161

range of 11 ± 16 g C m-2 yr-1, 15 ± 16 g C m-2 yr-1, and 18 ± 16 g C m-2 yr-1 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5,

162

and RCP8.5, respectively, for the period from 2006~2100 (Fig 2c). However, the temporal

163

dynamics of the NEP indicated relatively less variability than NPP and Rh under the three RCP

164

scenarios, and decreased continually with the slopes of -0.14 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01), -0.07 g C m-2

yr-1 (P=0.13), and -0.10 g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.05) for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively.

166

This indicated that the potential capacity for carbon sequestration on the Tibetan Plateau

167

grasslands would gradually decrease under future climate change, because the magnitude of the

168

variation rate of Rh was greater than that of NPP.

scenarios, and the shading area denotes one standard deviation.

173

3.2 The response of the interannual carbon budget to future climate variability

174

The simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with precipitation across the three

175

RCP scenarios with the partial correlation coefficients (R) in the range of 0.07 ~ 0.48 (Fig 3). The

176

positive response of the carbon fluxes to annual precipitation variation became stronger with

177

increasing temperature. Higher correlations between carbon fluxes (NPP and Rh) and precipitation

178

were found in RCP8.5 with R values of 0.33 (P < 0.05, Fig 3c) and 0.48 (P < 0.05, Fig 3f) than

179

those in RCP2.6 (R = 0.25 and 0.34, P < 0.05, Fig 3a,d), respectively. Spatially, the carbon fluxes

180

showed a strong positive relationship with precipitation in the midwestern and northeastern part of

181

the Tibetan Plateau grassland (R > 0.3, P < 0.05, Fig 3). However, an obvious negative correlation

182

between NEP and precipitation was found in the southern and middle part of the Plateau (Fig

183

3g-i). This was probably due to the fact that precipitation gradually decreased from the southeast

184

to the northwest [20]. Increased precipitation in the southeastern mountainous area could lead to

185

more cloud cover, and thus have negative effects on photosynthesis. The Rh tended to be most

to 2100 under the three RCP scenarios. Black point signs showed significance level at P < 0.05.

192
193

As illustrated in Fig 4, the simulated carbon fluxes exhibited a positive correlation with

194

temperature (Tmean) (R: 0.03 ~ 0.76), while the R between NEP and Tmean equal to – 0.09. The

195

positive responses of the NPP and Rh to Tmean were stronger in RCP8.5 with R values of 0.54 (P

196

< 0.05, Fig 4c) and 0.76 (P < 0.05, Fig 4f) than those in RCP2.6 (R = 0.32 and 0.30, P < 0.05, Fig

197

4a,d). Spatially, the strong positive responses of simulated NPP and Rh to Tmean change were

198

found across the majority of the Plateau (R > 0.4, P < 0.05, Fig 4a-f), while the NPP and NEP

199

showed an obvious negative responses to increasing temperature in the midwestern and

200

northeastern part of the Plateau (R < -0.2, P < 0.05, Fig 4a-c,g-i). This was probably related to the

201

the fact that limited rainfall in these areas could not meet the increase in water demand under

202

warming. The magnitude of Rh increase in response to Tmean (R:0.30 ~ 0.76, P < 0.05, Fig 4d-f)

203

was larger than that of NPP (R:0.33 ~ 0.55, P < 0.05, Fig 4a-c) and NEP (R:-0.09 ~ 0.14, P >

204

0.05, Fig 4g-i), indicating that warming stimulates respiration more than plant growth and

205

subsequently decreases carbon sink.

3.3 The response of the decadal carbon budget to future climate change

211

To quantify the carbon cycle of the Tibetan Plateau grasslands in response to the climate

212

variability, we further evaluate the decadal-scale dynamics of climate and carbon budgets during

213

three time periods (Fig 5). The 2010s ~ 2030s time period was calculated as the difference

214

between the decadal averages of the years 2010 ~ 2019 and 2030 ~ 2039, and the same was done

215

for the 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods. The decadal change of carbon fluxes (e.g.

216

∆NPP and ∆Rh) were positively linearly correlated with the ∆Tmax (Fig 5d,e) and ∆Tmin (Fig

217

5g,h), with R2 in a range of 0.59 ~ 0.67 (P < 0.01). It was suggested that the increase in

218

temperature could stimulate both vegetation production and also Rh. Furthermore, the linear

219

slopes indicated that 1% increase in Tmax and Tmin caused a larger increase of Rh by 0.27%

220

(Fig 5c) and 0.24% (Fig 5h) than those of NPP by 0.23% (Fig 5d) and 0.21% (Fig 5g). This

221

suggested that Rh was more sensitive than NPP to increasing temperature. Consequently, the

222

simulated NEP exhibited a decreasing trend under a warming climate. With respect to the

223

response to the decadal change of precipitation, the dynamics of the ∆NPP and ∆Rh showed an

224

increasing trend with ∆Precipitation, while these positive responses tended to be stagnant (Fig

225

5a,b). As the decadal change of precipitation varied within comparatively small ranges (~ 5%),

226

temperature might play an important role in modulating the carbon fluxes of alpine

227

grassland.Taken together, the changes in ∆NEP suggested that the alpine grassland still behaved

228

as a carbon sink but its capacity declined over the 21st century.

Plateau grassland to climate change over the 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s

232

time periods under the three RCP scenarios.

233
234

Under RCP2.6, the ∆Precipitation was 3%, 0%, and -1% (Fig 5a-c), with the ∆Tmax being

235

13%, -5%, and -8% (Fig 5d-f), and the ∆Tmin 8%, -4%, and -7% (Fig 5g-i) for 2010s ~ 2030s,

236

2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. This decadal climate change led to a

237

corresponding decrease in ∆NPP from 4% to 1% and 0% for the three time periods (Fig 5a, d, g),

238

and the same decrease in ∆Rh (Fig 5b, e and h), and consequently led to a decrease in ∆NEP from

239

25% to 16% and 6% (Fig 5c, f and i). In response to the continual decrease in temperature and

240

precipitation, the changes in the decadal carbon dynamics were predicted to show a corresponding

241

downward trend in the RCP2.6 scenario. For RCP4.5, the ∆Precipitation was -1%, 1%, and 0%,

242

with the ∆Tmax 12%, 6%, and 4%, and the ∆Tmin 6%, 6%, and 4% in the 2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~

243

2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. In this scenario, the reduction in the

244

magnitude of the warming trend was accompanied by stable precipitation, which led to a

245

corresponding decrease in ∆NPP of 5%, 3%, and 4%, and in ∆Rh of 7%, 5%, and 4%,

246

respectively. The discrepant magnitudes of the increase in NPP and Rh across different periods,

247

resulting in the variations of the ∆NEP were -13%, -30%, and 8%, respectively. The decrease in

248

∆NEP in the first two periods was mainly due to a larger increase in Rh than NPP. Under RCP8.5,

249

both the precipitation and temperature were projected to increase when the ∆Precipitation was 5%,

250

1%, and 7%, and the ∆Tmax was 10%, 22%, and 14%, and the ∆Tmin was 7%, 20%, and 25% for

2010s ~ 2030s, 2040s ~ 2060s and 2070s ~ 2090s time periods, respectively. The projected large

252

warming trend over the Tibetan Plateau would favor the growth of alpine grass, with a ∆NPP of

253

8%, 6%, and 8%, and could also exacerbate carbon decomposition with a ∆Rh of 9%, 7%, and

254

8%, respectively. Consequently, the NEP correspondingly decreased by -3%, -21%, and -3%,

255

respectively. The substantial decrease in the ∆NEP over the 2040s ~ 2060s time period was also

256

partially due to the water stress under strong warming conditions. The dynamics of NEP were

257

largely dependent on the different responses of NPP and Rh to climate change.

3.4 The response of the carbon budget to future elevated CO2 concentrations

260

To quantify the effect of increased CO2 on the carbon fluxes on alpine grasslands, we conducted

261

two model simulations: with and without CO2 fertilization. Then, the difference between the two

262

simulated results was analyzed to evaluate the impacts of CO2 on the carbon budget under the

263

three RCP scenarios (Fig 6). Across all scenarios, the increasing CO2 concentration accounted for

264

1.9%, 3.6%, and 7.3% of the increase in NPP (Fig 6a), and 1.7%, 3.0%, and 6.1% of the increase

265

in Rh (Fig 6b) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. Furthermore, the linear slopes

266

indicated that 1 ppm increase in CO2 concentration caused a slightly larger increase of NPP by

267

0.06 ~ 0.45 g C m-2 yr-1 (Fig 6a) than those of Rh by 0.06 ~ 0.43 g C m-2 yr-1 (Fig 6b). Notably,

268

the CO2 fertilization effect would be substantially amplified when accompanied by an increase in

269

temperature (slopeTmax = 0.6 °C decade-1 and slopeTmin = 0.7 °C decade-1, Fig 5d, g) and

270

precipitation (slope = 10.0 mm decade-1, Fig 5a) under RCP8.5. By the end of the 21st century

271

(2090s), the ∆NPP and ∆Rh both largely increased from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5, ranging from 2.4% to

11.0%. However, the magnitude of the difference in NEP was relatively small, with multi-model

273

mean values of 0.9, 2.3, and 4.9 g C m-2 yr-1 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively (Fig

274

6c). The elevated CO2 contributed more to plant growth than decomposition, indicating that the

275

Tibetan Plateau grassland was able to sequester carbon from the atmosphere due to CO2

276

fertilization.

4. Discussion

281

. The carbon fluxes of the alpine grassland in the Tibetan Plateau were stimulated to be strongly

282

influenced by the climate change and elevated CO2 concentrations [3,5]. Over the 21st century, the

283

Tibetan Plateau grassland NPP and Rh were projected to significantly increase, at rates of 0.35 ~

284

1.52 g C m-2 yr-1 and 0.49 ~ 1.62 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively, under the three scenarios. These

285

increases in NPP and Rh were primarily due to the effects of warming and elevated CO2

286

concentrations, while the positive impact of precipitation became stable (Fig 5,6). The enhanced

287

vegetation production in future projections was consistent with the model estimations of Gao et al.

288

[7] and Jin et al. [30].

289

to decrease with precipitation and temperature under RCP2.6, and with temperature in a relatively

290

stable precipitation scenario under RCP4.5 (Fig 5). Across all scenarios, the partial correlation (R)

291

between the carbon fluxes (NPP and Rh) and Tmean (Fig 4a-f) were higher than those with

292

precipitation (Fig 3a-f), except for the Rh in RCP4.5. These results suggested that the carbon cycle

293

in the alpine region may be primarily controlled by the temperature increase. However, the partial

294

correlation between carbon sink (NEP) and Tmean was predicted to decrease from 0.14 in RCP2.6

295

to -0.09 in RCP8.5 under a warmer scenario (Fig 4g,i). The partial correlation of NEP with

296

precipitation were equal to 0.07 and 0.08 in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Fig 3h,i), which were higher

297

than with Tmean (0.04 and -0.09, Fig 4h,i). Furthermore, the decadal carbon fluxes were predicted

298

to decrease with decreasing precipitation, albeit increasing temperature under RCP8.5 during the

299

2040s ~ 2060s (Fig 5). The role of precipitation was becoming increasingly important in carbon

300

uptake of the Tibetan Plateau grassland. The seasonal dynamics of carbon exchange in alpine

301

grassland under warming were likely to be modulated by water availability [36]. Similar results

302

were found in Inner Mongolia [52], the central and eastern United States [53], and California [54],

303

which indicated that grass production would largely decrease under warmer and drier climate

304

scenarios. The warming accelerated the evapotranspiration and then changed the soil water

305

availability [55,56]. When the soil water availability became limited, the vegetation production

306

might decrease due to suppressed photosynthesis [57] and also reduce root biomass [58]. Shen et

307

al. [6] and Shen et al. [59] further indicated that the precipitation may regulate the response of

308

vegetation phenology and soil respiration to climatic warming on the Tibetan Plateau. The water

309

availability became an increasingly important factor on carbon dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau

310

grasslands, particularly under a warmer climate scenario. These results highlight the significance

311

of accurate projection of precipitation (i.e. the amounts and distributions) under three RCP

312

scenarios, which should be considered in estimates of the carbon fluxes.

313

The Tibetan Plateau grasslands were projected to be a net carbon sink (16 ~ 25 Tg C yr-1)

314

over the 21st century, which was comparable to the results of Jin et al. [30] with NEP ranging

315

from 18 to 46 Tg C yr-1. However, the temporal dynamics of NEP all exhibited a slightly

316

decreasing trend, with slopes of -0.07 ~ -0.14 g C m-2 yr-1 across the three RCP scenarios. This

317

was probably due to the fact that warming induced more carbon inputs into the soil and

318

accelerated respiration rates (Rh), leading to reduced carbon uptake [60,61]. On the other side,

319

Cao and Woodward [62] found that the increasing trend in carbon uptake would be diminished by

320

the acclimated response to climate variability and CO2 fertilization effect. Consequently, the

321

temporal dynamics of simulated SOC increased 10 ~ 15 Mg C ha -1 (i.e., 1.4 ~ 2.1 Pg C for 1.4 ×

322

106 km2) over the 21st century, while the changing rate showed a decreasing trend of -0.12 ~ -0.06

323

g C m-2 yr-1 (P<0.01) under the three RCP scenarios. These results were in line with the

324

projections from the CMIP5 [63], but inconsistent with the findings of Crowther et al. [64], due

325

largely to the high initial SOC density in high-latitude areas. Our findings suggested that the

326

carbon sequestration in the vegetation and soil was projected to increase under three RCP

327

scenarios, but the carbon sequestration rate was predicted to decrease gradually on the Tibetan

328

Plateau grasslands.

329

The carbon dynamics exhibited a large discrepancy in response to climate change with and

330

without the effect of elevated CO2 concentrations. The carbon uptake by vegetation could be

331

strongly stimulated by CO2 fertilization, especially in July [65]. The increasing CO2 concentration

332

accounted for 1.9% ~ 7.3% of the increase in NPP (Fig 6a), which was less than the range of 9% ~

333

11% in the perennial grassland experiment at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in

334

central Minnesota during 1998 ~ 2010 [66]. Furthermore, the slope of NPP was predicted to

335

increase by 18% ~ 29% under CO2 fertilization among all scenarios, which was slightly less than

336

the estimates of Piao et al. [3] (~ 39%) on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands during the past five

337

decades. This was probably due to the effect of CO2 fertilization, which tended to be saturated

338

over time, and the discrepancy that existed in different models. Furthermore, the response of Rh to

339

CO2 was of the same magnitude (1.7% ~ 6.1%) as that in NPP during the 21st century. The

340

elevated CO2 concentrations generally had a positive effect on soil respiration by regulating the

341

carbon uptake and allocation, and on the availability of substrate and soil water [67].

342

Consequently, the almost consistent increase in NPP and Rh caused by the elevated CO2 on the

343

alpine grassland resulted in a relatively small difference in NEP (0.9 ~ 4.9 g C m-2 yr-1, Fig 6c).

344

However, the grassland carbon cycle was projected to be amplified by around two to three times

345

due to higher CO2 concentrations under RCP8.5 compared to that in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The

346

different potential responses to elevated CO2 levels were partly due to the different climate

347

conditions among the three RCP scenarios. For RCP2.6, the increasing CO2 associated with a

348

decreasing trend in temperature and precipitation had a minor effect on the carbon cycle (Fig 6a).

349

Furthermore, the elevated CO2 favored plant growth limitedly in RCP4.5, as the continually

350

warming and stable precipitation may induce water stress (Fig 6b). However, increasing

351

temperature and precipitation, together with increasing CO2, greatly enhanced the carbon uptake

352

in the alpine ecosystem under RCP8.5 (Fig 6c).

353

Furthermore, the dynamically downscaled climate data using regional climate models

354

(RCMs) indicated an improved performance compared to the coarse output from global climate

355

models (GCMs) [51,68]. Jin et al. [30] indicated that the increased resolution of RCMs was

356

preferable for capturing the regional climate patterns, especially under the complex surface

357

characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau. There are also substantial uncertainties in projected climate

358

change for RCMs, coming from the driving GCMs and human action [69,70]. Moreover, without

359

taking the effect of nitrogen (N) into account, the quantitative attribution of future climate change

360

and elevated CO2 concentrations on the carbon dynamics of the Tibetan Plateau grasslands should

361

be considered merely suggestive. The N is regarded as a limiting factor, controlling the carbon

362

uptake and further influencing the climate – carbon cycle feedback [71,72]. However, most of the

363

current carbon cycle models lack N dynamics [71]. Further efforts should be made to incorporate

364

N feedback to constrain the uncertainty of the carbon cycle in response to a changing environment

365

[73,74].

366

5. Conclusions

367

By applying a process-based biogeochemistry model, CENTURY, we quantified the carbon

368

dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands in response to climate change and elevated CO2 under

369

the RCP scenarios. The Tibetan Plateau grasslands behaved as a net carbon sink with the NEP of

370

16 ~ 25 Tg C yr-1 over the 21st century. However, the potential capacity for carbon sequestration

371

on the Tibetan Plateau grasslands was predicted to decrease gradually with the slopes ranging

372

from -0.14 to -0.07. The partial correlation between carbon fluxes and climate indictated that

373

warming stimulated respiration more than plant growth. However, the elevated CO2 contributed

374

more to plant growth than decomposition, which could offset the warming-induced carbon loss.

375

The interannual and decadal-scale dynamics of the carbon fluxes were primarily controlled by

376

temperature, while the role of precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon

377

budgets in the alpine grassland. The stable precipitation accompanied by noticeable warming in

378

RCP4.5 (2010s ~ 2030s and 2040s ~ 2060s) and RCP8.5 (2040s ~ 2060s) led to a reduction of

379

carbon sink (∆NEP) by -13%, -30% and -21%, respectively. These results highlighted the
