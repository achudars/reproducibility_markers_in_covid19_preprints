Abstract

19

Background

20

Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic

21

modality for cellular therapy because of their rapid proliferation and potent cellular activity

22

compared to conventional bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Cosmetic

23

lipoaspirates provide an easily obtainable source of ADSCs. Cryopreservation facilitates their

24

clinical application due to increased transportability and pooling of sufficient numbers of cells.

25

However, proper cryopreservation techniques have not been established yet.

26

Methods

27

We evaluated the post-thaw viability and ADSC functions after cryopreservation with three

28

cryoprotectants (serum containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), serum-free: CP-1TM,

29

DMSO-free: SCB-DFTM) at two temperature (−80°C, −150°C) and two cell densities: (1 × 106,

30

7 × 106 cells/mL) for up to 18 months using cryovials. After determining optimal conditions, we

31

also tested if large quantities of ADSCs remained viable after 18 months of cryopreservation in

32

a 100-mL cryobag. Rate-controlled freezing methods or liquid nitrogen storage were not

33

exploited.

34

Results

35

ADSCs cryopreserved in serum containing 10% DMSO or CP-1TM at −150°C and 7 × 106

36

cells/mL were most viable (>85%) after 18 months without perturbation of MSC functions.

37

Even suboptimal conditions (−80°C, 1 × 106 cells/mL, no DMSO) assured >80% viability when

38

stored for up to 9 months. Large quantities of ADSCs in a cryobag were properly

39

cryopreserved.

40

Conclusions

41

A programmable freezer or liquid nitrogen storage is not necessary. CP-1TM is preferable in

42

terms of side effects. Simplified cryopreservation methods (−80°C and no DMSO) can be used

43

for up to 9 months, resulting in reduced infusion toxicities and lower costs.

Introduction

46

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a new therapeutic modality for regenerative

47

medicine and immunosuppressive therapy. MSCs can be established from various tissues: bone

48

marrow, adipose tissue, cord blood, dental pulp, umbilical cord, amniotic fluid, etc. Increasing

49

interest has focused on adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs), because of higher proliferation and

50

cellular activity in addition to the abundant source of adipose tissue obtained by liposuction.

51

MSCs do not elicit allo-reactive lymphocyte responses because they do not express human

52

leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II (1). Thus, third-party ADSCs can be established on a large

53

scale and utilized in many unrelated recipients. Cryopreservation of ADSCs facilitates the

54

clinical application of these cells due to increased transportability and pooling of a sufficient

55

number of cells with the same quality. Compelling studies have shown that strict conditions

56

(stored at an ultra-low temperature, freezing rate controlled by a programmable freezer, usage of

57

cryoprotectant) assure the quality of stem cells, especially hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),

58

after long-term (more than 10 years) cryopreservation. However, these methods are costly.

59

HSCs should be cryopreserved for a considerably long period because these cells cannot be

60

transplanted into major histocompatibility (MHC) incompatible donors. However, MHC

61

compatibility for MSCs is not necessary as described above, suggesting that more convenient,

62

low-cost methods may be applicable for MSC cryopreservation and subsequent transplantation.

63

Several studies have focused on this aspect of MSC cryopreservation, but most assessed the

64

durability of MSCs in the short term (weeks to months) in small-scale experiments with

65

cryovials (2-4), which are not ideal for clinical settings. Serum containing 10%

66

dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) has been used for years as a standard cryoprotectant agent (CPA),

67

but this type of CPA has several drawbacks. Serum can provoke an immune reaction and

68

transmit infection. When infused, DMSO exerts side effects such as nausea, emesis, chills,

69

rigors, and cardiovascular events (5-7). Thus, clinical application of ADSCs requires further

70

development of safe, convenient, low-cost cryopreservation methods. Here, we evaluated the

71

post-thaw viability and ADSC functions after cryopreservation with three different CPAs

72

(serum containing 10% DMSO, serum-free, or serum- and DMSO-free) at two different

73

temperatures (−80°C and −150°C) for up to 18 months with the use of cryovials. After setting

74

optimal conditions for storage, we confirmed that large quantities of ADSCs were still viable

75

after cryopreservation in a 100-mL cryobag for 24 months.

82

cryoprotectant solutions CP-1™ and Stem-CellBankerTM DMSO FREE GMP Grade (hereafter

83

abbreviated as SCB-DF) were purchased from Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial (Tokyo

84

Japan) and TakaraBio (Shiga, Japan), respectively. For the final freezing medium (hereafter

85

abbreviated as CP-1), 32 mL 25% human serum albumin was added to 68 mL CP-1TM just

86

before use. Human ADSCs were established from adipose tissues to be discarded following skin

87

flap operations after obtaining informed consent (n = 3), as described previously (8).

Cryopreservation

90

Human ADSCs were plated onto T75 flasks and cultured until cells reached a enough number

91

for cryopreservation. Prior to freezing, ADSCs (80% confluency) were detached from the flask

92

walls with trypsin/EDTA, and viable cells were counted with the trypan blue exclusion method.

93

After centrifugation, supernatant was removed completely, and cells were resuspended in one of

94

three types of freezing medium: 10% DMSO in FBS (hereafter abbreviated as DMSO), CP-1, or

95

SCB-DF, at two different cell densities: 1 × 106 or 7 × 106 cells/mL in 0.2-mL cryopreservation

96

vials (0.1 mL/vial), and then stored in a −80°C deep freezer or a −150°C ultra-low temperature

97

freezer for 3, 9, or 18 months. In another setting, cell suspensions of ADSCs were prepared at

(Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). The cryobags containing ADSCs were directly placed into a −150°C

100

ultra-deep freezer and stored for 24 months.

102

Cell thawing and cell recovery rate

103

Frozen cryovials or cryobags were quickly thawed in a circulating 37°C water bath by gently

104

shaking and agitating until the ice mass disappeared. Then, the cell suspension from cryovials

105

was washed with culture medium once, and recovery rates were evaluated with the trypan blue

106

exclusion method. The recovery rates were calculated as follows: (viable cell number/total cell

107

number) × 100 (%). The rest of the cells were grown in culture to evaluate

108

hematopoietic-supporting activities, surface antigen profiles, and differentiation abilities into

109

adipocytes and osteoblasts.

Coculture of human CD34-positive progenitor cells with

human ADSCs

131

Coculture of human CD34-positive peripheral blood stem cells and human ADSCs was

132

performed as described previously (10). Briefly, feeder layers comprised of intact ADSCs or

133

ADSCs after the freeze-thawing process were pre-established (80% confluency) in 48-well

134

plates pre-coated with gelatin. Then, CD34-positive cells (1.0 × 104 cells per well), purchased

135

from the RIKEN BRC through the National Bio-Resource Project of the MEXT, were

136

suspended in long-term culture medium (α-MEM containing 12.5% horse serum, 12.5% FBS, 1

137

μM hydrocortisone, and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol) and applied to the feeder layers. The

138

cocultures were incubated for 4 weeks with replenishment of long-term culture medium twice a

139

week, and proliferation of floating cells was assessed in three randomly selected microscopic

140

fields (200×). At the end of the coculture, the progenitor content of each well was assayed with

methylcellulose colony assays as described previously (11). All adherent cells in each well were

detached by trypsinization and plated in 3 mL MethocultTM H4034 (Stemcell Technologies,

To identify the optimal storage conditions for human ADSCs, cells were suspended in three

different CPAs: DMSO (open columns), CP-1 (black columns), or SCB-DF (gray columns), at

159

two different cell densities: 1 × 106 or 7 × 106 cells/mL in 0.2-mL cryopreservation vials (0.1

3, 9, or 18 months. The stored cells were rapidly thawed in a water bath at 37°C, and viable

162

cells were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method under a microscope. Cells in all

163

subgroups showed minimal cell aggregation.

164

When stored at −80°C (Figure 1A), the post-thaw recovery rate of human ADSCs was stable

165

after 9 months, but rapidly and significantly decreased after 18 months. None of the CPAs or

166

cell densities tested prevented the decrease in the post-thaw recovery rate at 18 months.

167

However, DMSO, CP-1, and storage at high cell density (7 × 106 cells/mL) were superior to

168

SCB-DF and storage at low cell density (1 × 106 cells/mL).

169

When stored at −150°C (Figure 1B), the post-thaw recovery rate of human ADSCs decreased

170

over time, similar to storage at −80°C. However, cell viability was better in all subgroups at 18

171

months compared to storage at −80°C. Additionally, storage at the high cell density (7 × 106

172

cells/mL) maintained greater viability of ADSCs than storage at the low cell density (1 × 106

173

cells/mL) in each CPA. Minimal cell damage was observed in cells stored at high cell density (7

174

× 106 cells/mL) with DMSO or CP-1, even after 18 months.

181

The stored cells were rapidly thawed in a water bath at 37°C, and viable cells were counted with

182

the trypan blue exclusion method. The percent post-thaw viable cells was calculated as follows:

DMSO or CP-1, low temperature (−150°C), and high cell density (7 × 106 cells/mL). ADSCs

can be safely cryopreserved for at least 18 months in such a condition.

The hematopoiesis-supporting ability of human ADSCs

192

is not affected by long-term cryopreservation

193

To assess the quality of human ADSCs after long-term cryopreservation, we focused on the

194

hematopoiesis-supporting ability of ADSCs, because ADSCs support human CD34+ HSCs to a

195

greater degree than conventional bone marrow-derived MSCs. In cocultures, we observed that

196

CD34+ cord blood cells overlaid onto fresh ADSCs (hatched column) or ADSCs cryopreserved

197

in CPAs (DMSO: open columns, CP-1: black columns, SCB-DF: gray columns) formed clusters

198

of round cells that were unattached or tightly attached to the monolayers (Figure 2A, left upper

199

panel), which was consistent with a previous report (10). We compared the number of these

200

nonattached cells at the indicated time points, and found that the number of nonadherent cells

201

was not significantly different among the four subgroups (Figure 2A, right upper panel). After

202

28 days of coculturing, adherent cells were quantitated with colony-forming cell assays. The

203

cocultured cells formed CFU-GEMM, CFU-G, and CFU-M in the four subgroups. The major

204

lineages of the colonies were CFU-G and CFU-GM (Figure 2B), consistent with our previous

205

report (12). We found no significant difference in the proportion of each lineage or the total

206

number of colonies among the four subgroups (Figure 2B).

conditions: in CP-1 (approximately 1 × 106 cells/mL in a total volume of 50 mL) at −150°C.

214

After 24 months of cryopreservation, cells were quickly thawed in a water bath at 37°C. The

215

viability of cells was 91.9 ± 3.9% (mean ± SD) with minimal cell aggregates. The cells showed

216

no morphological changes and propagated well, similar to fresh ADSCs. FACS analysis showed

that post-thawed human ADSCs were positive for CD29, CD73, CD105, CD90, and

met the minimal criteria of MSCs as defined by the International Society for Cell Therapy (13).

temperatures (−80°C and −150°C) for up to 18 months. We did not exploit rate-controlled

256

freezing methods or liquid nitrogen storage. We found that the following conditions were

257

optimal: higher cell density (7 × 106 cells/mL), usage of DMSO, and lower storage temperature

258

(−150°C) (Figure 1A and 1B). However, even suboptimal conditions (−80°C, 1 × 106 cells/mL,

259

no DMSO) in which cells were stored up to 9 months produced a post-thaw recovery rate >80%

260

(Figure 1A and 1B). These facts suggest that rate-controlled freezing methods or liquid nitrogen

261

storage are not necessary for cryopreservation of ADSCs over a short- to mid-term period.

262

Serum containing 10% DMSO has been used for years as a standard cryoprotectant agent,

263

because DMSO can penetrate into cells and prevent the formation of intracellular ice crystals

264

and subsequent membrane rupture. Our current experiments showed that post-thaw cell

265

recovery was significantly low in ADSCs cryopreserved with SCB-DF (Figure 1A and 1B),

266

suggesting an important role for DMSO. However, DMSO, when infused into the body, exerts

267

side effects such as nausea, emesis, chills, rigors, and cardiovascular events in a dose-dependent

268

manner (5-7). CP-1 is a 25% human serum albumin solution that is mixed just before use and

269

added to an equal volume of cell suspension, yielding a final freezing medium with 5% DMSO,

270

which has low risk for side effects. In Japan, CP-1 has been clinically used for cryopreservation

271

of HSCs for decades with few side effects reported (14, 15). Thus, CP-1 may be a safe,

272

easy-to-prepare, low-cost cryopreservation medium for ADSCs.

273

Freezing cells and thawing cryopreserved cells properly is crucial to the viability and

274

functionality of the cells. Freezing and thawing a large number of cells, which is imperative for

275

clinical application, in cryobags takes longer compared to cryovials. However, the viability of

276

human ADSCs cryopreserved in cryobags at −150°C for 24 months was over 90% with minimal

277

cell clumps. The morphology, growth rate, surface antigen profiles, and adipogenic

278

differentiation, but not osteogenic differentiation, of these cells were the same as those of fresh

279

ADSCs. The osteogenic potential of ADSCs is inferior to that of BMSCs (16), and the

280

cryopreservation process decreases the osteogenic differentiation ability of ADSCs (17, 18).

281

Little was known about how long-term cryopreservation affects the hematopoietic-supporting

282

ability of ADSCs, one of the major features of ADSCs (19). Here, we show that both

283

cryopreserved and fresh ADSCs generated almost equal numbers of granulocytes and progenitor

284

cells from human HSCs using in vitro coculture and progenitor assays (Figure 2B), even though

285

the cell recovery rates of ADSCs stored with SCB-DF were lower compared with those with

286

DMSO or CP-1 (Figure 1A and 1B). These facts clearly suggest that cryopreservation can

perturb the ability of osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs but not the hematopoietic-supporting

288

ability.

289

Together, these observations provide helpful information about safe, cost-effective

290

cryopreservation of ADSCs that could be used in the clinical setting.
