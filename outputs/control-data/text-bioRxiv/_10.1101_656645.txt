Abstract
Female reproductive success depends on the size and quality of a finite ovarian reserve.
Paradoxically, mammals such as mice and humans eliminate up to 80% of the initial oocyte pool
during development through the enigmatic process of fetal oocyte attrition (FOA). Here we
report that the combined inhibition of retrotransposon L1 reverse transcriptase and the Chk2dependent DNA damage checkpoint prevents FOA, thus preserving the entire fetal oocyte
population. Remarkably, reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT-treated Chk2 mutant oocytes
initially accumulate, but subsequently resolve L1-instigated genotoxic threats and differentiate,
resulting in a maximized functional ovarian reserve. We conclude that FOA is a consequence of
genotoxic stress that acts to preserve oocyte genome integrity, and is not an obligatory
developmental program for oogenesis.

Results and Discussion
The size and quality of the finite supply of immature oocytes established at birth are critical
determinants of female reproductive lifespan and success (1). Paradoxically, the size of this
starting ovarian reserve reflects only a minor share of the initial pool of fetal oocytes. In humans,
as little as 20% of oocytes survive massive fetal oocyte attrition (FOA) to form the ovarian
reserve at birth (2). Intriguingly, since the discovery of FOA in the 1960s, the rationale and
mechanisms of this conserved process remain debated. Over the ensuing decades, inadequate
oocyte nutrition, oocyte self-sacrifice, and meiotic DNA damage featured prominently in models
attempting to explain this phenomenon (3). However, it remains unknown whether preventing
FOA, if possible, would benefit or perturb fertility.
Previously, we implicated retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1), a highly abundant mobile
element in mammalian genomes, in FOA in mice (Fig. 1A, B) (4-6). While DNA methylation
and other mechanisms normally repress L1 (7, 8), epigenetic remodeling of primordial germ
cells creates permissive conditions for L1 expression (9). In male germ cells, Piwi-interacting
small RNAs (piRNAs) guide DNA methylation to rapidly repress transposons, whose excessive
activity could otherwise lead to DNA damage, meiotic defects and germ cell death (10-13). In
contrast, oocyte genomes remain demethylated throughout meiotic prophase I and until the onset
of postnatal differentiation, expressing L1 during FOA (14, 15). In addition to correlating
expression levels of L1-encoded ORF1p with DNA damage and oocyte fate, we also reported a
remarkable protective effect of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) on oocyte
viability (4, 16, 17). Intriguingly, AZT treatment prevents oocyte death only temporarily, until
embryonic day (E) 18.5. We surmised that the inability of AZT to prevent FOA completely is

due to the persistent endonuclease activity of L1 ORF2p (18) resulting in excessive DNA
damage and subsequent activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in E18.5 oocytes (4, 19, 20).
To test if FOA is dependent on both L1 activity and L1-instigated activation of the DNA
damage checkpoint, we first examined the role of checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), which transduces
information regarding DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) to downstream apoptotic machinery
in the mid-pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I (21). Chk2 mutant mice are viable, fertile and,
unlike in wild-type animals, unrepaired DSBs do not cause death of oocytes lacking CHK2 (19).
However, whether CHK2 has a role in FOA under physiological conditions is unknown. We first
compared the number of oocytes in Chk2-/- to Chk2+/- E15.5 ovaries at the onset of FOA. At this
timepoint, there was no difference in oocyte number between Chk2-/- and Chk2+/- ovaries,
suggesting that CHK2 does not impact primordial germ cell proliferation (Fig. 1C and fig. S1).
We also analyzed the role of CHK2 in progression through meiotic prophase I based on
synaptonemal complex morphology. We found no significant difference in the percent of total
oocytes in each stage of meiotic prophase I between Chk2-/- and Chk2+/- ovaries at E15.5 (fig.
S2A). However, in Chk2-/- ovaries at E18.5, we observed an over-representation of diplotene
stage oocytes, likely spared in the absence of DNA damage checkpoint activation in midpachynema (Fig. 1A and fig. S2B and table S1). We went on to compare oocyte number per
ovary in Chk2-/- and Chk2+/- at E18.5 when approximately half of the oocytes are eliminated in
wild-type mice, and at P2, the endpoint of FOA (4). At E18.5, the oocyte number is again
comparable between Chk2-/- and Chk2+/- ovaries (Fig. 1D). However, by P2, Chk2-/- ovaries
contained significantly more oocytes than P2 Chk2+/- ovaries, and a comparable number to E18.5
Chk2-/- ovaries, suggesting no further FOA has occurred (Fig. 1E). These observations are
consistent with the timing of DNA damage checkpoint activation in mid-pachynema as measured

by upregulation of the transactivating p63 (TAp63) isoform that is downstream of CHK2 to
trigger apoptosis at E18.5, but not at E15.5 (fig. S3). Therefore, CHK2 plays a role in FOA
starting at E18.5, but not earlier.
Since the onset of CHK2 function in FOA at E18.5 coincided with the endpoint of the
protective effect of AZT described previously (4), we tested if the combination of AZT treatment
inhibition and DNA damage checkpoint would prevent FOA. We first validated the previous
finding that daily administration of AZT to pregnant females starting at E13.5 prevents FOA
between E15.5 and E18.5 but fails to maintain this effect until P2 in control Chk2+/- mice (Fig. 1,
C-E) (4). In contrast, AZT treatment of Chk2-/- animals preserved more oocytes by P2 than either
condition alone (Fig. 1E). In some cases, all fetal oocytes initially generated at E15.5 persist to
P2 in Chk2-/- +AZT conditions, resulting in a maximized oocyte supply (Fig. 1C-F). Notably,
ending AZT treatment of Chk2-/- mice at E18.5 did not maximize oocyte supply at P2 (fig. S4
and table S2). This evidence supports our hypothesis that FOA is a consequence of L1 reverse
transcriptase activity throughout meiotic prophase I and activation of DNA damage checkpoint
by L1 endonuclease activity and meiotic defects beginning in mid-pachynema.

To obtain a comprehensive picture of cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous
mechanisms of oocyte loss during FOA and upon FOA evasion, we compared gene expression
profiles of wild-type untreated and AZT-treated isolated oocytes and whole ovaries at the onset
and at the peak of FOA (E15.5 and E18.5, respectively) (fig. S5, A - D). At E18.5, untreated
samples contain surviving oocytes while AZT-treated samples contain rescued oocytes that
should have been lost to FOA as well as surviving oocytes. Globally, RNA sequencing of ovaries
and oocytes revealed similar gene expression profiles in both untreated and AZT-treated

conditions at their respective developmental time points (fig. S6, A). This observation suggests
that AZT treatment does not impact global gene expression significantly and that oocytes retain
their cellular/developmental identities irrespective of their fate in FOA. However, closer analysis
of gene expression between untreated and AZT-treated conditions at E18.5 shed light on
differences related to FOA (fig. S6, B-E). Specifically, gene ontology enrichment analysis in
E18.5 AZT-treated whole ovaries made apparent lower mRNA expression levels of a cohort of
genes involved in the complement system of innate immunity compared to untreated ovaries
(Fig. 2A-B). In contrast, E18.5 AZT-treated oocytes showed increased expression of the CD55
gene also known as Decay Accelerating Factor DAF that protects cells from autologous
complement attack (Fig. 2B). These observations indicated a role for the complement system in
FOA that was further supported by the reduced occurrence of macrophages in ovaries that
evaded FOA at E18.5 (fig. S7). Interestingly, antiviral innate immunity genes showed little
ovarian and oocyte expression in all conditions, arguing against a prominent role of this pathway
in FOA despite a strong response to L1 overexpression observed in other somatic tissues (Fig.
2B) (22).
L1 expression remains a prominent feature distinguishing AZT-treated from untreated
oocytes during FOA and dictates the fate of an individual oocyte (fig. S8) (4). To better
understand transcriptional heterogeneity between fetal oocytes and gene expression profiles
related to FOA, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of E18.5 ovaries in untreated and
AZT-treated conditions. Cells from both wild-type untreated and AZT-treated E18.5 ovaries
were clustered and re-clustered into oocyte-specific populations (Fig. 2, C - D and fig. S9, A D). Oocytes separated into early, intermediate, and advanced developmental stages relative to the
E18.5 timepoint based on expression of established germ-cell markers (Fig.2, E-F and fig. S9, E6

F, and table S4). Consistent with the earlier results of bulk oocyte RNA sequencing, AZT
treatment did not change the E18.5 oocyte transcriptome significantly, nor the separation into
early, intermediate, and advanced developmental stages. However, the proportion of oocytes
present at each stage differed slightly. Consistent with the predominant activity of FOA in early
meiotic prophase I between E15.5 and E18.5, and increased expression of meiotic genes in bulk
AZT-treated oocytes, we observed a greater proportion of oocytes cluster into the early and
intermediate developmental stages in the AZT-treated sample, while the untreated sample
contained more oocytes expressing advanced markers such as Gdf9 (Fig. 2E-F). Cumulatively,
gene expression analyses suggest that oocytes surviving and perishing in FOA are fundamentally
similar, with an over-representation of early and intermediate stage oocytes in conditions of FOA
evasion, which is consistent with the predominant oocyte loss in early meiotic prophase I.
To determine how oocytes evading FOA progress through development in the presence
of substantial genotoxic stress, we measured the nuclear abundance of γH2AX (a DSB marker)
and L1 ORF1p in individual oocytes of Chk2+/-, Chk2-/-, and AZT-treated Chk2+/- and Chk2-/ovaries. Consistent with previous findings (4), a population of AZT treated E18.5 Chk2+/- or
Chk2-/- oocytes showed higher γH2AX abundance compared to untreated ovaries (Fig. 2H).
Additionally, AZT-treated Chk2+/- and Chk2-/- E18.5 ovaries contained a population of oocytes
with high levels of L1 ORF1p and L1 ORF1 mRNA never observed in untreated controls (Fig.
2G, I and fig. S8). Although untreated Chk2-/- showed higher L1 ORF1p levels compared to
controls in E18.5 oocytes, AZT treatment increased L1 ORF1p levels further (Fig. 2I). Thus,
inhibition of both L1 and the DNA damage checkpoint results in the appearance of E18.5
oocytes exhibiting L1 overexpression and excessive genome damage. Unexpectedly, although
Chk2-/- and Chk2-/- +AZT P2 oocytes still showed elevated L1 ORF1p levels compared to

Chk2+/- and Chk2+/- +AZT oocytes, P2 oocytes in all conditions showed significantly reduced L1
ORF1p and γH2AX levels compared to E18.5 (Fig. 2, G, J-K and table S2E-H). An FOAindependent reduction of L1 expression and γH2AX levels indicates that while FOA acts as
quality control for genome integrity, given a chance, an oocyte can ultimately reduce genotoxic
threats.
While previous studies showed significant DNA damage repair capacity of Chk2-/- mutant
postnatal oocytes (19), the unexpected reduction of L1 ORF1p levels prompted us to examine the
involvement of piRNAs in FOA. Indeed, robust downregulation of L1 ORF1p expression in
E18.5-P2 oocytes coincided with increased expression of piRNA pathway genes including Mili
that encodes the predominant Piwi family protein in wild-type fetal oocytes (Fig. 3, A-B) (23).
Consistent with piRNA pathway activation, RNAs of 26-27 nucleotides in length (characteristic
of piRNA) became highly abundant in E18.5 and P2 wild-type ovaries and superseded RNAs of
22-23 nucleotides (characteristic of endo-siRNAs) dominating the E15.5 RNA profile (Fig. 3C).
Mapping of small RNA reads to repetitive elements revealed a massive increase in antisense
small RNAs targeting evolutionarily young L1MdA and L1MdT elements at E18.5 and P2
compared to E15.5 (Fig. 3D-E and table S5). Importantly, Mili mutant P2 ovaries had negligible
amounts of piRNAs based on the absence of the 26-27 nucleotide long small RNA population,
proving that piRNA production at this time is Mili-dependent (Fig. 3F). However, we found that
P2 oocytes evading FOA in Mili-/-;Chk2-/- double-mutant mice treated with AZT still
downregulated L1 ORF1p levels (Fig. 3, G and H and table S6). Cumulatively, these results
suggest that oocytes use multiple mechanisms to reduce L1 upon evading FOA, one candidate
being HSP90a, expression of which negatively correlates with L1 ORF1p in human germ cells
and is implicated in post-transcriptional transposon repression in mice (24, 25). Indeed, we found

that Hsp90a family genes are significantly expressed and upregulated between E15.5 and E18.5
oocytes (Fig 3A).
The striking reduction of L1 expression and repair of DNA breaks in oocytes evading
FOA prompted us to test their differentiation and developmental capacity. To assess oocyte
differentiation, we analyzed the Balbiani body, an organelle aggregate that contains the Golgi
complex, mitochondria, and RNAs, and whose size increases with oocyte growth and
differentiation (26). We quantified Balbiani body size at E18.5 and P2, based on Golgi content
area. We found an increase in Golgi content from 40µm2 to 70µm2 in Chk2+/- untreated control
oocytes (Fig. 4B). Importantly, oocytes in Chk2-/- untreated and Chk2+/- and Chk2-/- AZT-treated
conditions also experienced a significant increase in Golgi content (Fig. 4A). Therefore, oocytes
allowed to reach the P2 stage, regardless of L1 expression or amount of DNA damage initially
accumulated at E18.5, have the potential to differentiate if FOA is prevented (Fig. 4B).
To assess the significance of FOA for folliculogenesis, we quantified growing follicle
types in P4 and P19 ovaries of Chk2+/-, Chk2-/-, and Chk2-/- +AZT females. P4 is an early stage of
folliculogenesis at which the transition from primordial to primary follicles occurs through
encapsulation of oocytes with somatic granulosa cells. P19 stage ovaries have further progressed
through folliculogenesis and contain all follicle types that form by further accumulation of
granulosa cell layers and theca cells around oocytes, but before ovulation. We observed the
characteristic growing follicle types at P4 and P19 in both Chk2-/- +AZT and control ovaries,
suggesting that folliculogenesis is not impeded in the absence of FOA (Fig. 4, C - D).
Quantification of primordial and non-primordial follicles in P4 ovaries that have evaded FOA
revealed an increased number of primordial follicles compared to controls and comparable

numbers of non-primordial follicles (Fig. 4, C - D). P19 ovaries that do not undergo FOA also
contain more follicles, but the increase observed was less significant (Fig. 4, C - D).
To test the consequences of possessing increased numbers of primordial follicles on
fertility as a result of FOA prevention, we crossed females born to Chk2-/- +AZT-treated females
that have reached reproductive maturity to Chk2+/- males and monitored the number of litters and
litter size compared to untreated Chk2-/- and Chk2+/- females. Both litter number and litter size
over the course of 10 months was comparable between the three conditions, suggesting that FOA
is not obligatory for fertility, nor is it detrimental to have an increased number of primordial
follicles in the ovarian reserve (Fig. 4F and table S7).
Cumulatively, this work identifies FOA as a consequence of genotoxic stress during fetal
oogenesis that is triggered by excessive L1 reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities
leading to DNA damage and meiotic defects. We showed that oocytes can be manipulated to
evade FOA, downregulate L1 expression, and maximize the functional ovarian reserve without
disrupting oogenesis or reducing fertility. Therefore, in mammals, massive oocyte loss is not an
obligatory developmental program for oogenesis. Crucially, due to the conservation of FOA and
L1 expression in human oocytes, this work is of biomedical relevance for human female fertility
as it identifies an avenue for the improvement of the ovarian reserve by inhibiting L1 activity.

Fig. 1. The dynamics and experimental evasion of L1-mediated FOA. (A) Diagram of
developmental programs concurrent with FOA and their dynamics, including DNA methylation
(DNAme), L1 ORF1p expression, and meiotic prophase I (Leptotene (L), zygotene (Z),
pachytene (P), and diplotene (D) stages indicated with red checkmark representing DNA damage
checkpoint. (B) Diagram of L1 structure and retrotransposition mechanism. L1 propagation
involves cytoplasmic packaging of L1 RNA in ribonucleoprotein particles along with L1encoded RNA chaperon ORF1p and a reverse transcriptase (RT)/endonuclease (EN) ORF2p.
Once in the nucleus, ORF2p endonuclease nicks DNA releasing a 3'-OH end to prime reverse
transcription of L1 RNA into cDNA. The subsequent RNA removal from the L1 RNA:cDNA

Materials and Methods
Animals
For this study, Chk2-/- mice in a mixed C57Bl/6 and 129X1/Sv genetic background were used (27).
Chk2-/- mice were backcrossed one time to C57Bl/6 to generate Chk2+/- controls. We chose Chk2+/as a control to account for the mixed genetic background resulting in a significant increase in
oocyte number compared to wild-type mice of pure C57Bl/6 background (fig. S1). To determine
how genetic background contributed to differences in oocyte number between Chk2-/- and C57Bl/6
wild-type mice, we backcrossed Chk2-/- for 4 generations. This reduced the percent genome
containing homozygous 129X1/Sv SNPs from approximately 4% to 0.03% (SNP genotyping by
DartMouse, Dartmouth School of Medicine). Mili+/+, Mili+/-, and Mili-/- mice used were in C57Bl/6
genetic background. Mili-/-;Chk2-/- mice and control littermates were generated by crossing Chk2/and Mili+/- animals. Wild-type mice of CD1 (Charles River Laboratories) genetic background
were used for all quantitative PCR, mRNA and small RNA sequencing experiments unless
otherwise noted. All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with ethical
regulations and approved by the IACUC of the Carnegie Institution for Science.
AZT treatment
50mg/kg/day AZT was administered daily by gavage to ~8-month-old pregnant female from E13.5
until experiment end point. AZT (Sigma Aldrich, Cat# A2169) was diluted to 5mg/ml in nuclease
free water, aliquoted and stored at -20°C.
Oocyte and follicle quantification
We quantified oocytes per ovary at E15.5, E18.5, and P2 using a whole-mount
immunofluorescence and tissue clearing method previously described (28). Ovaries were dissected
and labeled with the germ cell-specific antibody TRA98 (29). After immunofluorescence, samples
were treated with ScaleA2 clearing reagent for 7 days, changing solution each day. Confocal
imaging through the entire tissue using SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) followed by 3D
reconstruction of Z-stacked images and spot and surface analysis using Imaris software (Bitplane)
were performed. For statistical analysis, average number of oocytes per ovary was counted in
embryos from at least 3 different litters (table S2A). Variability between numbers due to timing of
plug during the day as well as natural variation between embryos that is more apparent at earlier
stages between litters and embryos. Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test (table S2B). In the case of Mili;Chk2 double mutants, we quantified
oocytes labeled with germ cell-specific antibody TRA98 and nuclei counterstained with DAPI by
scoring every 5th section through the entire ovary, and estimating total number per ovary. Statistical
significance was determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (table S6A-B).
We quantified primordial and non-primordial (primary, secondary, antral) follicles at P4 and P19
by performing immunohistochemistry and DAB staining. We quantified follicles in every 5th
section through the entire ovary, then estimated total number per ovary. Sections were labeled with
the cytoplasmic germ cell marker MVH and nuclei counterstained with hematoxylin. MVHpositive follicles were quantified and categorized as primordial or non-primordial based on the
number of somatic cell layers surrounding the oocyte. At least three ovaries from three different
females were quantified for each experimental group and two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test used
to determine statistical significance (table S7A-B).

Immunostaining
Whole-mount immunofluorescence and immunofluorescence protocols on cryosections and
meiotic spreads were performed as previously described (4, 28). For immunohistochemistry with
DAB staining, ovaries were fixed in Bouin’s overnight at 4°C, transferred to 70% ethanol
overnight, and embedded in paraffin. Ovaries were sectioned into 10µm slices. Sections were
deparaffinized by washing slides in Citrisolv (Decon Labs) 3x 15 minutes, re-hydrated through
graded ethanol washes, blocked with hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, avidin block for 15
minutes (Vector Laboratories), biotin block (Vector Laboratories), and goat serum block (Vector
Labs cat # PK-4001). Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-DDX4/MVH and for 30
minutes at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Vector
Labs cat # PK-4001). Samples were incubated 30 minutes at room temperature with Vectastain
ABC reagent (Vector Labs cat # PK-4001) followed by DAB detection. Slides were dipped in
hematoxylin, rehydrated in ethanol, dipped in Citrisolv and mounted.
Microscopy
Imaging of whole-mount ovaries and ovary sections was performed using TCS-SP5 laserscanning confocal microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), histological sections using Nikon
Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Diagnostic Instruments model 2.3.1 digital camera,
and meiotic spreads using Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95
digital Camera as previously described (4, 28). Image analysis was completed using Imaris
(Bitplane) and ImageJ.

(Invitrogen). RNA was DNase treated using TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion). cDNA synthesis
reactions were performed using oligo dT and Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RTPCR (Invitrogen). cDNA was diluted equally and added to the qPCR reactions containing
SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR was performed on CFX96
Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System to detect SYBR Green. Relative quantities were analyzed
using DDCt methods with Actb as the housekeeping control gene. Primer sequences used for RTPCR experiments include F-actb: CGG TTC CGA TGC CCT GAG GCT CTT; R-actb: CGT CAC

Western blot
6-12 whole ovaries were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH=8, 150mM NaCl,
1%NP40, 1%SDS, 1mMEDTA, and 10% glycerol. 1mM PMSF and 1mM Halt protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail were added to buffer just before lysis. Ovaries were homogenized
using RNase-free pestle and protein quantified using BCA. Lysates were run on 12%
polyacrylamide running, 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Proteins transferred overnight at 4°C to
PVDF membrane that had been activated for 15 seconds in 100% methanol followed by 2 minutes
water and 15 min in transfer buffer. Membrane rinsed with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 and blocked
with 5% nonfat milk in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies
were incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies used at 1:2000 and
incubated 1 hour at room temperature. Detection by ECL was performed.
Meiotic chromatin spread preparation
Ovaries were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using dissociation buffer containing 0.025%
trypsin, 2.5 mg/mL collagenase, and 0.1mg/mL DNase I. One volume of Hypotonic buffer (30mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50mM sucrose, 17mM sodium citrate) was added to the cell suspension and set
on nutator for 30 minutes. Cells were pelleted and supernatant replaced with 100µM sucrose, pH
8.2 solution. Approximately 600µl sucrose solution per ovary pair. Slides were dipped in fixative
(1% PFA, 0.15% Triton X-100, pH 9.2) and 20µL resuspended cells pipetted along bottom edge.
Cells were slowly spread around slide by tilting the slide gently. Slides were dried in humid
chamber for 2 hours, then treated with 0.08% Photo-Flo (Kodak). Slides used immediately for
immunostaining or stored at -80°C.

Analysis of L1ORF1p and gH2AX nuclear fluorescence
Ovary sections of 8µm thickness were stained with DAPI, germ cell marker TRA98, and L1
ORF1p. Confocal stacks were taken through the section. Imaris bitplane was used to generate a
surface around each DAPI-positive nucleus in TRA98-positive germ cells. Then, relative mean
nuclear (RMN) fluorescence was calculated for the channel containing L1 ORF1p signal within
the surface. This procedure was used in the same manner to calculate gH2AX RMN fluorescence.
Each germ cell RMN value was then divided by the average of three RMN values from TRA98negative somatic cell nuclei that should not contain L1 ORF1p nor gH2AX to normalize for
background fluorescence. On average, about 200 oocytes were quantified per experimental group.
Oocytes come from at least 3 different ovaries and 2 different litters unless noted otherwise (table
S2C, E and table S6C). Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed KolmogorovSmirnov test (table S2D, F and table S6D).
Analysis of Golgi element area
Ovary sections of 8µm thickness were stained with DAPI, germ cell marker TRA98 and GM130
(26). Confocal stacks were taken through the section. Imaris bitplane was used to generate a
surface around each GM130-positive Balbiani body region in a TRA98-positive cell. Area of
surface generated for GM130 channel was calculated. Each bar represents 70 to 200 individual
oocytes measured. Oocytes come from at least 3 different ovaries and 2 different litters unless
noted otherwise (table S2G). Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (table S2H).
FACS sorting
Ovaries were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using dissociation buffer containing 0.025%
trypsin, 2.5 mg/mL collagenase, and 0.1mg/mL DNase I. Cell suspensions were filtered using
40µm filter. Oocytes were FACS-sorted from remaining ovarian somatic cells based on size and
complexity using forward and side scatter parameters (fig. S6A-C) (30). Propidium iodide
treatment for 10 minutes and gating for negative red fluorescence was used to eliminate dead cells
from the sort. BD FACS Aria III sorter was used.
Bulk RNA-Seq analysis
RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), DNaseI-treated using TURBO DNA-free
kit (Ambion), and libraries generated using ribo-zero kit. 75bp unpaired, single-end reads were
sequenced on Illumina Next-seq 500 system. Remaining rRNA sequences were removed
computationally using bowtie by aligning reads to mm10 rRNA genome. Reads that did not align
were subsequently mapped to mm10 genome using Tophat splice aligner (31). To determine
differential gene expression, cuffdiff was used followed by cummeRbund in R to obtain FPKM
values and generate plots (fig. S7A-B and table S3A-D). GO pathway enrichment analyses was
performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (table S3E-H) (32, 33).
Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis
Ovaries were dissociated into a single-cell suspension using dissociation buffer containing 0.025%
trypsin, 2.5 mg/mL collagenase, and 0.1mg/mL DNase I. Cells were pelleted and washed with
PBS 3 times. Viability and cell count were determined using trypan blue staining and Countess II
automated cell counter. Samples with greater than 90% viability and 1 million cells per milliliter
were used for sequencing. GEM generation, barcoding, and library construction were performed

with 10x genomics Chromium Genome Reagent Kit (v2 Chemistry). Libraries were sequenced on
Illumina Next-Seq 500 system. For the untreated sample, 16,448 cells with 48,924 mean reads per
cell were sequenced. For the AZT-treated sample, 15,551 cells with 48,450 mean reads per cell
were sequenced. Differential gene expression and clustering analysis was performed using Cell
Ranger 3.0 and Seurat packages (table S4A-D) (34).
Small RNA-Seq analysis
Total RNA was extracted from whole ovaries using mirVana miRNA isolation kit. RNA was run
on 15% urea gel and 18-35 nucleotide region excised. Small RNAs were eluded from gel slice
with 0.3M NaCl overnight at room temperature. 3’ and 5’ adapters were added and reverse
transcription reaction performed to generate cDNA. Libraries were PCR amplified and 75 or 150
bp reads sequenced on Illumina Next-Seq 500 system. piPipes small RNA analysis pipeline was
used to determine small RNA length and align reads to repeats (table S5A-D) (35) (Han et al,
2015). For small RNA length distribution, rRNA and miRNA hairpins were removed. For repeat
alignment and quantification, reads were normalized to miRNA. At least three pairs of ovaries
were used per sample. WT samples were of CD1 genetic background. Mili+/+ and Mili-/- were of
B6 genetic background.
Fertility assay
Chk2-/- females that were treated with AZT during their fetal development and raised to adults
were crossed to Chk2+/- males. Chk2-/- females that were untreated as well as Chk2+/- females that
were untreated were crossed to Chk2+/- males for controls. The number of live pups per litter at the
day of birth from 6 Chk2-/- +AZT females, 3 Chk2-/- females, and 6 Chk2+/- females were monitored
for at least 10 months (table S7C). Number of litters over 10 months were reported in females that
survived the duration of the assay. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student’s
t-test (table S7).

RT-PCR detection of L1 ORF1 relative mRNA expression at E15.5, E16.5, E17.5, and E18.5 in
untreated and AZT-treated FACS-sorted oocytes. Expression normalized to that of the E15.5
untreated oocyte sample using the Actb gene as an internal control. All mice used were of CD1
genetic background. Each sample contained oocytes from at least 6 embryos.

Fig. S9. Identification of early and advanced oocyte clusters in single-cell RNA-Seq. (A) t-SNE plot of untreated
ovarian cell clusters. (B) t-SNE plot of AZT-treated ovarian cell clusters. Black stars indicate clusters expressing
germ cell-specific gene Ddx4 that were used for re-clustering of oocytes. (C-D) t-SNE plot highlighting germ cellspecific gene Ddx4 in blue in untreated (C) and red in AZT-treated (D) ovarian cells. (E-F) t-SNE plots showing
germ cell-specific genes ranging from early (Ccnb3), intermediate (Sycp2, Taf7l, Dppa3), and late (Gdf9)
developmental markers in untreated (E) and AZT-treated (F) re-clustered oocyte populations. All embryos used
were at E18.5 and of CD1 genetic background.
