Abstract
Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) are an important resource for mapping genes

20

controlling complex traits in many species. While RIL populations have been developed

21

for maize, a maize RIL population with multiple teosinte inbred lines as parents has

22

been lacking. Here, we report a teosinte nested association mapping population

23

(TeoNAM), derived from crossing five teosinte inbreds to the maize inbred line W22.

24

The resulting 1257 BC1S4 RILs were genotyped with 51,544 SNPs, providing a high-

25

density genetic map with a length of 1540 cM. On average, each RIL is 15%

26

homozygous teosinte and 8% heterozygous. We performed joint linkage mapping (JLM)

27

and genome-wide association study (GWAS) for 22 domestication and agronomic traits.

28

A total of 255 QTLs from JLM were identified with many of these mapping to known

29

genes or novel candidate genes. TeoNAM is a useful resource for QTL mapping for the

30

discovery of novel allelic variation from teosinte. TeoNAM provides the first report that

31

PROSTRATE GROWTH1, a rice domestication gene, is also a QTL associated with

32

tillering in teosinte and maize. We detected multiple QTLs for flowering time and other

33

traits for which the teosinte allele contributes to a more maize-like phenotype. Such QTL

34

could be valuable in maize improvement.

Introduction

38

Recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations are powerful tools for investigating the

39

genetic architecture of traits and identifying the causal genes that underlie trait variation.

40

RIL populations have been widely used in many organisms. In mammals, the well-

41

known Collaborative Cross (CC), consisting of a large panel of multiparental

42

recombinant inbred mouse lines, has been specifically designed for the analysis of

43

complex traits (Churchill et al. 2004). Similarly, the Drosophila Synthetic Population

44

Resource (DSPR), which consists of two sets of RILs, has been designed to combine

45

the high mapping resolution offered by multiple generations of recombination with the

46

high statistical power afforded by a linkage-based design (King et al. 2012). In plants,

47

the maize nested association mapping population (NAM), which crossed 25 founders to

48

a common parent in maize (Yu et al. 2008), has been successfully applied to a large

49

number of traits (Buckler et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2011; Kump et al. 2011). The NAM

50

design has also been utilized to other crops such as barley (Maurer et al. 2015; Nice et

51

al. 2016), rice (Fragoso et al. 2017), sorghum (Bouchet et al. 2017), wheat (Jordan et al.

52

2018), and soybean (Xavier et al. 2018). In Arabidopsis, another design, called

53

Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population, provides high

54

precision to detect QTLs (Kover et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011). This design has also

55

been used in wheat (Huang et al. 2012; Mackay et al. 2014), rice (Bandillo et al. 2013),

56

and maize (Dell'Acqua et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2016).

57

For the study of maize domestication, many new discoveries were made using a

58

biparental maize-teosinte BC2S3 RIL population. Shannon (2012) performed QTL

59

mapping for 16 traits and examined the genetic architecture of domestication at the

60

whole genome level. This RIL population has also been widely used to fine-map QTL

61

and identify causal or candidate genes for many QTLs including ones controlling seed

62

shattering (Lin et al. 2012), leaf number (Li et al. 2016), kernel row number (Calderón et

63

al. 2016), shoot apical meristem morphology (Leiboff et al. 2016), vascular bundle

64

number (Huang et al. 2016), tassel related traits (Xu et al. 2017b), and nodal root

65

number (Zhang et al. 2018). With this population, several QTL have been fine-mapped

66

to single genes including grassy tillers1 (gt1) for controlling prolificacy (Wills et al. 2013),

67

prolamin-box binding factor1 (pbf1) for kernel weight (Lang et al. 2014), glossy15 (gl15)

68

for vegetative phase changes (Xu et al. 2017a), ZmCCT10 for photo-period response

69

(Hung et al. 2012), and zea agamous-like1 (zagl1) for kernel row number and flowering

70

time (Wills et al. 2017), as well as several more genes regulating flowering time:

71

ZmCCT9 (Huang et al. 2018), Zea mays CENTRORADIALIS8 (ZCN8) (Guo et al.

72

2018), and ZmMADS69 (Liang et al. 2018). In addition to phenotypic traits, the maize-

73

teosinte BC2S3 RIL population was used for a comprehensive genome-wide eQTL

74

analysis to study the changes in gene expression during maize domestication (Wang et

75

al. 2018).

76

Despite its utility, the maize-teosinte BC2S3 RIL population has three limitations.

77

First, there is only a single teosinte parent, which cannot broadly represent the diversity

78

of teosinte. Second, this population had two generations of backcross, which produces

79

a background in which some teosinte traits are suppressed and do not segregate

80

among the RILs. Third, the teosinte parent was a wild outcrossed individual which,

81

unlike an inbred line, could not be maintained as a permanent resource.

82

In this paper, we report the development of a teosinte NAM population (TeoNAM)

83

of 1257 BC1S4 RILs using five teosinte inbred parents crossed with a common maize

84

parent (W22) for mapping QTLs for domestication and agronomic traits. We have

85

genotyped the RILs with 51,544 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers that provide a

86

high-density genetic map. The TeoNAM population captures a large number of

87

recombination events for localizing QTL to genomic locations and the single generation

88

of backcross allows enhanced expression of teosinte traits as compared to the BC 2 S3

89

RIL population. We report data for 22 traits but focus our discussion on 9 traits to

90

illustrate the utility of TeoNAM including identifying candidate genes. TeoNAM will be a

91

valuable resource for dissecting the genetic basis of domestication and agronomic traits.

Results

94

Characterization of a teosinte NAM population

95

We developed a teosinte NAM population (TeoNAM), which was constructed by

96

crossing five teosinte inbred lines to a maize inbred line W22, followed by one

97

generation of backcross to the common recurrent maize parent and four generations of

98

selfing (Figure S1). The teosinte parents include four Zea mays ssp. parviglumis lines

99

and one Zea mays ssp. mexicana line. As such, TeoNAM encompasses five bi-parental

100

families, each with 219-310 BC1 S4-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for a total of

101

1257 RILs. The number of segregating SNP markers range from 11,395 to 16,109 per

102

family with over 51,000 total SNP markers (Table 1).

103

The expected segregation for a BC 1 S4 population is 73.44% homozygous

104

recurrent, 3.13% heterozygous, and 23.44% homozygous donor parent. Overall, the

105

percentage of genotypes observed were 76.6% W22 homozygous, 15% teosinte

106

homozygous and 8.1% heterozygous across all SNP sites in the TeoNAM population

107

(Table 1). The percentage of teosinte varied among subpopulations from 14.2%-16.2%

108

(Table 1) and also varied across the genome in all subpopulations (Figure S2). The

109

observed higher than expected heterozygosity may be due to unconscious selection for

110

more heterozygous plants which had hybrid vigor. The chromosomal region of highest

111

heterozygosity is on the short arm of chromosome 4 near teosinte glume architecture1

112

(tga1) (Wang et al. 2005). Selection against homozygotes for the teosinte allele of tga1,

113

which have poor ear and kernel quality, may be the cause. For a BC1 S4, the expected

114

frequency of the maize allele is 75%. All subpopulations deviate from this with an

115

excess of maize allele (Table 1) and the amount of excess varies across the genome

116

(Figure S3).

117

We constructed genetic linkage maps for each family and a composite linkage

118

map based on all RILs across all families and identified and annotated 51,544 high

119

confidence SNPs that were used to impute the SNP alleles in the RILs. The composite

120

genetic map based on these markers is 1540 cM in length including 35,880 crossovers.

121

We examined the relationship between genetic distance in cM and physical distance in

122

Mb based on the composite genetic map. The mean value is 0.75 cM/Mb. However,

123

there is a wide deviation from the mean across the genome (0 - 5.52 cM/Mb). As

124

expected, there is suppressed recombination near the centromeres (Figure S2) and

125

frequent recombination near the telomeres where gene density is high as well (Figure

126

S2).

127

We scored 22 traits for the TeoNAM lines of which 15 traits are domestication

128

related, including vegetative gigantism (CULM, LFLN, and LFWD), prolificacy (PROL),

129

tillering (TILN), ear shattering (SHN), conversion of the inflorescence from staminate to

130

pistillate (STAM), multiple ear-related traits (EB, ED, EL, KRN, KW), glume traits (GLCO

131

and GLUM), and red pericarp color (REPE) (Table 2). Additionally, several agronomic

132

traits were scored including flowering (ASI, DTA, and DTS), plant architecture (PLHT

133

and TBN), barren ear base (BARE), and yellow pericarp color (YEPE). Most traits (ASI,

134

CULM, DTA, DTS, ED, EL, KRN, KW, LFLN, LFWD, PHLT, and TBN) follow

135

approximately normal distribution, suggesting an oligo- or polygenic genetic control of

136

these traits, but other traits (BARE, EB, GLCO, GLUM, PROL, REPE, SHN, STAM,

137

TILN, and YEPE) exhibited a skewed or non-normal distribution. Some of these traits

138

are meristic or discrete traits (e.g. PROL or TILN). A few traits, like STAM, show a two-

139

part distribution with a spike at 0 plus continuous range of values from 0 to 2, which

140

suggest they may be polygenic threshold traits (Figure S4). There are also substantial

141

differences in trait mean among the five subpopulations, indicating underlying

142

differences in genetic architecture among the five teosinte inbreds (Figure S5).

143

QTL mapping

144

We used both Joint Linkage Mapping (JLM) and the Genome-Wide Association

145

Study (GWAS) method as two complementary approaches for QTL detection. We also

146

used basic interval QTL mapping for the five individual subpopulations to provide a

147

guide for future work to fine-map the genes underlying the QTL. We detected 255 QTLs

148

for 22 traits by JLM which combines information across all families (Figure 1; Table S1).

149

We detected a total of 150 QTLs by GWAS, among which 57 QTLs overlapped with

150

QTLs by JLM (Table S2). Separate QTL mapping for each subpopulation detected 464

151

QTLs in total, among which 310 QTLs overlapped with QTLs by JLM (Figure S6-S27;

152

Table S3). Below, we focused on QTL detected by JLM for our characterization of the

153

genetic architecture and the distribution of QTL allelic effects.

154

Among 22 traits, the number of QTL ranges from 2 to 24; the trait with most QTL

155

is KRN. Genetic architecture varies considerably among traits (Figure 2; Figure S28).

156

Several traits, including BARE, GLCO, GLUM, PROL, REPE, STAM and YEPE, had

157

relatively simple genetic architectures with two to ten QTL including one of large effect.

158

The largest QTL for each of these traits has between 2.1 and 11.7 times the additive

159

effect of the second largest QTL. A second class of traits have a genetic architecture

160

that is either more polygenic (ED, KRN, KW, LFLN, TBN, and TILN) or having only a

161

few QTL of small effect (ASI, CULM, EB, LFWD, PLHT and SHN). For these traits, there

162

was no single large effect QTL that accounts for the majority of the explainable

163

variation. The largest effect QTL for each of these traits has between 1 and 1.8 times

164

the size of the effect of the second largest QTL. A final class of traits has a genetic

165

architecture with both a single QTL of large effect plus multiple QTLs of small effect.

166

These traits include DTA, DTS, and EL. The largest effect QTL for each of these traits is

167

between 2.4 and 3.7 times the size of the second largest QTL.

168

QTL for agronomic traits: DTA is a classical quantitative trait for maize, and in

169

TeoNAM, it is controlled by a large-effect QTL plus many small-effect QTLs from JLM

170

results. We detected 19 QTLs that explained 68% of the total variance for DTA (Figure

171

3). Among them, several recently cloned flowering time genes were detected. For

172

example, QTL DTA1.1 mapped to zea agamous like1 (zagl1), which affects flowering

173

time as well as multiple traits related to ear size with the maize allele conferring larger

174

ears with more kernels (Wills et al. 2017). The QTL DTA3.1 mapped to MADS-box

175

transcription factor69 (ZmMADS69), which functions as a flowering activator through the

176

ZmRap2.7-ZCN8 regulatory module and contributes to both long-day and short-day

177

adaptation (Liang et al. 2018). QTL DTA8.1 mapped to ZCN8, which is the maize

178

florigen gene and has a central role in mediating flowering (Meng et al. 2011; Guo et al.

179

2018). QTL DTA9.1 mapped to ZmCCT9, in which a distant Harbinger-like transposon

180

acts as a cis-regulatory element to repress its expression to promote flowering under

181

the long days of higher latitudes (Huang et al. 2018). QTL DTA10.1 mapped to

182

ZmCCT10, a known gene involved in photoperiod response in maize (Hung et al. 2012;

183

Yang et al. 2013).
In addition to these genes, we also identified several other candidate genes for

184
185

DTA that have not previously been characterized as genes underlying a QTL. QTL

186

DTA3.2 mapped to Zea mays CENTRORADIALIS12 (ZCN12), which is a potential floral

187

activator (Meng et al. 2011). QTL DTA4.1 mapped to Zea mays MADS19 (zmm19) and

188

DTA5.1 mapped to Zea mays MADS31 (zmm31). QTL DTA6.1 mapped to silky1 (si1),

189

which is also a MADS box gene required for lodicule and stamen identity (Ambrose et

190

al. 2000). QTL DTA6.2 mapped to zea agamous1 (zag1), which is known to affect

191

maize flower development (Schmidt et al. 1993). It’s well known that MADS-box genes

192

encode transcription factors that are key regulators of plant inflorescence and flower

193

development (Theissen et al. 2000). Other than MADS genes, QTL DTA7.2 mapped to

194

delayed flowering1 (dlf1), a floral activator gene downstream of ZCN8 (Meng et al.

195

2011).

196

As expected, the teosinte alleles delayed flowering for the QTL that mapped to

197

candidate genes. We plotted the phenotypic difference in DTA between teosinte and

198

maize across the whole genome, and the teosinte genotype is associated with late

199

flowering over most of the genome, even where no QTL were detected, suggesting that

200

there are many additional minor-effect QTLs that were not detected due to insufficient

201

statistical power (Figure S29). Interestingly, chromosome 5 and 7 are exceptions to this

202

pattern with teosinte genotype being associated with early flowering at most sites

203

(Figure S29). Results for DTS are similar to DTA as expected (Figure S30).

204

TBN is the only tassel trait we scored. We detected 12 QTLs of small effects that

205

explained 52% of the total variance for TBN (Figure S31). Among them, several

206

classical genes were identified. QTL TBN6.1 mapped to fasciated ear4 (fea4), a bZIP

207

transcription factor with fasciated ears and tassels as well as greatly enlarged

208

vegetative and inflorescence meristems (Pautler et al. 2015). QTL TBN6.2 mapped to

209

tasselsheath1 (tsh1), a GATA class transcription factor that promotes bract growth and

210

reduces branching (Whipple et al. 2010). QTL TBN7.1 mapped to ramosa1 (ra1), a

211

C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor which has tassels with an increased number of

212

long branches as well as branched ears (Vollbrecht et al. 2005). QTL TBN7.2 mapped

213

to tasselsheath4 (tsh4), a SBP-box transcription factor that functions to repress lateral

214

organ growth and also affects phyllotaxy, axillary meristem initiation and meristem

215

determinacy within the floral phase (Chuck et al. 2010). QTL TBN8.1 mapped to barren

216

inflorescence1 (bif1), which shows a decreased production of branches and spikelet

217

pairs (Barazesh and McSteen, 2008). QTL TBN10.1 mapped to zea floricaula leafy1

218

(zfl1), which together with its homolog zfl2, leads to a disruption of floral organ identity

219

and patterning, as well as to defects in inflorescence architecture and in the vegetative

220

to reproductive phase transition (Bomblies et al. 2003).

221

QTL for domestication traits: TILN is a classical domestication trait that

222

measures difference in plant architecture between maize and its wild relative, teosinte –

223

that is the low apical dominance of a highly branched teosinte plant as compared to the

224

less-branched maize plant. We detected 18 small-effect QTLs that explained 68% of the

225

total variance for TILN (Figure S32). Among them, QTL TILN1.3 mapped to tb1, a TCP

226

family of transcriptional regulators contributing to the increase in apical dominance

227

during maize domestication (Doebley et al. 1997). Additionally, QTL TILN3.2 mapped to

228

Zea AGAMOUS homolog2 (zag2), a MADS box gene recently found to be downstream

229

of tb1 (Studer et al. 2017). QTL TILN1.1 and TILN5.2 mapped to zmm20 and zmm26,

230

two other MADS box genes that were possible targets of selection during domestication

231

(Zhao et al. 2011). QTL TILN7.1 mapped to PROSTRATE GROWTH1 (PROG1), a

232

C2H2 zinc finger protein controlling a key change during rice domestication from

233

prostrate to erect growth, and also affects plant architecture and yield-related traits (Jin

234

et al., 2008; Tan et al. 2008). There are 13 genes in the support interval and the QTL

235

peak is closest to PROG1, being ~14 kb 5’ of the start site (Figure S32). This is the first

236

evidence that PROG1 may have had a role in maize domestication.

237

GLUM is classical maize domestication trait measuring the dramatic change from

238

the fruitcase-enveloped kernels of the teosinte ear to naked grains of maize ear.

239

Previously, this trait was shown to be largely controlled by a single gene which is known

240

as teosinte glume architecture1 (tga1) (Wang et al. 2005). Interestingly, tga1 is a direct

241

target of tb1. We detected 11 QTLs that explained 62% of the total variance for GLUM.

242

These QTL include a large effect QTL at tga1 itself plus many small effect QTLs (Figure

243

S33). Among the small effect QTL, our results show that two of them (GLUM2.2 and

244

GLUM7.1) mapped to MADS genes. In this regard, Studer et al. (2017) recently defined

245

a maize domestication gene network in which tga1 regulates multiple MADS-box

246

transcription factors.

247

PROL is also an important domestication trait that measures difference in

248

prolificacy or the many-eared plants of teosinte and the few-eared (one or two) plants of

249

maize. Previously, a large effect QTL was fine-mapped to a region 2.7 kb upstream of

250

grassy tillers1 (gt1) (Wills et al. 2013). Interestingly, gt1 is a known target of tb1

251

(Whipple et al. 2011). We detected four QTLs that explained 39% of the total variance

252

for PROL, which include a single large effect QTL plus three small effect QTLs (Figure

253

S34). Concordantly, QTL PROL1.1 mapped to gt1. QTL PROL2.1 mapped to

254

zea floricaula leafy2 (zfl2), which was shown to have a pleiotropic effect on lateral

255

branch number (Bomblies and Doebley, 2006). QTL PROL3.1 mapped to sparse

256

inflorescence1 (spi1), a mutant that has defects in the initiation of axillary meristems

257

and lateral organs during vegetative and inflorescence development in maize (Gallavotti

258

et al. 2008). QTL PROL5.1 mapped to yabby9 (yab9), a class of transcription factor that

259

might play important roles during maize domestication.

260

STAM measures the proportion of the terminal lateral inflorescence on the

261

uppermost lateral branch that is staminate. Relative to domestication, this trait

262

represents the sexual conversion of the terminal lateral inflorescence from tassel

263

(staminate) in teosinte to ear (pistillate) in maize. Currently, teosinte branched1 (tb1)

264

and tassel replace upper ears1 (tru1) are the only two genes that have been shown to

265

regulate this sexual difference. We detected five QTLs that explained 27% of the total

266

variance for STAM (Figure 4). QTL STAM1.2 mapped to tb1, which is an important

267

domestication gene known for various traits (Doebley et al. 1995). QTL STAM3.1

268

mapped to tru1 which is a direct target of tb1 (Dong et al. 2017). QTL STAM1.1 mapped

269

to tassel seed2 (ts2), a recessive mutant that produces pistillate spikelets in the terminal

270

inflorescence (tassel) (Irish and Nelson, 1993). QTL STAM3.2 mapped to Zea mays

271

MADS16 (zmm16), which shows high expression in tassel and silk. QTL STAM7.1

272

mapped to tassel sheath4 (tsh4), a SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING (SBP)-box

273

transcription factor that regulates the differentiation of lateral primordia (Chuck et al.

274

2010). In addition to these QTLs, two other STAM QTLs were detected by GWAS.

275

Notably, a QTL on chromosome 1 (AGPv4 chr1:234.4-249.9Mb) is located upstream of

276

tb1 and co-localized with STAM1.1 from a recent study (Yang et al. 2018). The known

277

gene anther ear1 (an1) is a strong candidate gene for this QTL since loss of an1

278

function results in the development of staminate flowers in the ears (Bensen et al.

279

1995). The tb1 QTL region was also detected by GWAS with a strong signal for interval

280

AGPv4 chr1:264.1-283.1Mb.

281

SHN measures ear shattering, the loss of which is a key step during crop

282

domestication (Doebley, 2006). Teosinte ears have abscission layers between the

283

fruitcases (modified internodes) that allow the ear to shatter into single-seed units

284

(fruitcase) at maturity. The maize ear lacks abscission layers and remains intact at

285

maturity. Currently, only two maize orthologs (ZmSh1-1 and ZmSh1-5.1+ZmSh1-5.2) of

286

sorghum and rice Shattering1 (Sh1) were verified for seed shattering (Lin et al. 2012).

287

We detected six QTLs that explained 30% of the total variance for SHN (Figure S35).

288

QTL SHN1.1 and SHN5.1 mapped to Sh1.1 and Sh1-5.1/5.2, respectively, confirming

289

prior identification of these maize paralogs of the sorghum shattering gene as strong

290

candidates for our QTL.

291

KRN is a domestication trait measuring the dramatic change from the two-ranked

292

teosinte ear to multiple (4 or more) ranked maize ear. We detected 24 small-effect QTLs

293

that explained 62% of the total variance for KRN (Figure S36). Among them, QTL

294

KRN1.3 mapped to indeterminate spikelet1 (ids1), an APETALA2-like transcription

295

factor that specifies determinate fates by suppressing indeterminate growth within the

296

spikelet meristem (Chuck et al. 1998). A previous fine-mapping study of KRN using a

297

maize-teosinte BC2S3 RIL population also identified ids1 is a strong candidate for KRN

298

(Calderón et al. 2016). QTL KRN4.2 mapped to unbranched3 (ub3), a SBP transcription

299

factor that has been shown to regulate kernel row number in both mutant and QTL

300

studies (Chuck et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015).

301

REPE for reddish-brownish pericarp is a trait that distinguishes teosinte kernels

302

from those of most maize. The role of pigmentation in domestication is complex in that

303

pigment can provide defense against molding and bird predation but can also impart

304

bitterness and astringency (Morohashi et al. 2012). The red (or reddish brown)

305

pigmentation often results from the accumulation of phlobaphenes - a flavonoid pigment

306

(Morohashi et al. 2012). In the absence of the reddish-brown pigment, the kernels are

307

white kernels unless anthocyanins (blue-purple) or carotenoids (yellow-orange) are

308

present. Our results show that QTL REPE1.1 mapped to Pericarp color1 (P1) (Figure

309

S37), which encodes an R2R3 Myb-like transcription factor that governs the

310

biosynthesis of brick-red flavonoid pigments (Grotewold et al. 1994).

311

Results for 13 additional traits (ASI, BARE, CULM, DTS, EB, ED, EL, GLCO,

312

KW, LFLN, LFWD, PLHT, and YEPE) are reported in supplemental figures and tables

313

(Figure S30, S38-S49; Table S1).

314

QTL detection and effects

315

To evaluate the power of QTL mapping using TeoNAM, we summarized the

316

distribution of QTLs detected with significant effects in the different subpopulations.

317

Among 255 QTLs for 22 traits, 246 QTLs (96%) were detected in two or more

318

subpopulations, 186 QTLs (73%) were detected in three or more subpopulations, 83

319

QTLs (33%) were detected in four or more subpopulations and 29 QTLs (11%) were

320

detected in all five subpopulations (Figure 5A). These percentages are conservative as

321

not all traits were scored in all five subpopulations. If one considers whether the QTL

322

was detected in subpopulations in which it was scored, then 205 QTLs (80%) were

323

detected in at least half of the subpopulations and 39 QTLs (15%) were detected in all

324

subpopulations.

325

The allelic effect from different teosinte parents were estimated simultaneously

326

by JLM. For most QTLs, the allelic effects from different subpopulations are in the same

327

direction (Figure 5B). For seven traits (EB, GLUM, LFWD, PROL, SHN, STAM, and

328

YEPE), the teosinte genotypes were consistently associated with a teosinte phenotype

329

and the W22 allele with a maize phenotype at all QTLs. For all other traits, cases in

330

which a teosinte allele was associated with the maize phenotype were detected. For

331

example, the teosinte genotype is associated with late flowering at most QTLs for DTA

332

except DTA5.2 and DTA7.1, for which the teosinte genotype consistently contributes to

333

early flowering in at least three subpopulations (Figure 2). Similar results were observed

334

for KRN and EL. The teosinte genotype is associated with fewer kernel row number

335

(KRN) at most QTLs, but there is one QTL (KRN5.1) for which the teosinte genotype is

336

consistently associated with more kernel row number in four subpopulations and also in

337

the BC2S3 population (Figure S36). The teosinte genotype is associated with shorter ear

338

length (EL) at most QTLs, but there are two QTLs (EL4.1 and EL9.1) for which the

339

teosinte genotype is consistently associated with longer ear length in four and two

340

subpopulations, respectively (Figure S43). These QTLs might be worth exploring further

341

for use in maize improvement.

342

We also observed some interesting results for different teosinte parents. For KW,

343

the teosinte genotype from different subpopulations is associated with reduced kernel

344

weight at most QTLs. Only three QTLs (KW5.3, KW6.2 and KW9.1) are exceptions with

345

one teosinte allele conferring heavier kernels. Interestingly for these three QTLs, the

346

teosinte alleles with effects in the opposite direction are all from the TIL14

347

subpopulation (Figure S45). Similar results were observed for ED, where the teosinte

348

genotype is associated with a decrease in ear diameter at most QTLs, but the teosinte

349

allele from TIL03 at two QTLs (ED2.1 and ED6.1) is associated with the increase of ear

350

diameter (Figure S42). These results suggest that there are beneficial alleles from

351

teosinte that could be utilized for maize improvement.

352

Comparing and combining TeoNAM with the BC2S3

353

We compared TeoNAM with the previous maize-teosinte BC2S3 RIL population.

354

The composite genetic map for TeoNAM is 1540 cM in length. The individual genetic

355

maps based on the five subpopulations have an average length of 1461 cM with a

356

range of 1348-1506 cM. The genetic map for BC2 S3 RIL population is 1478 cM in

357

length. Thus, the TeoNAM subpopulations are similar to the BC 2S3 RIL population in

358

genetic map length. The median length of homozygous teosinte segment in TeoNAM is

359

6 Mb. The median length of homozygous teosinte segment in BC2S3 population is 4.8

360

Mb. The longer segment length for TeoNAM is expected given it had one fewer

361

generations of backcrossing and less opportunity for recombination. The mean number

362

of homozygous teosinte segment in TeoNAM is 3502, and the number of homozygous

363

teosinte segment in BC2S3 is 5745. The total length of teosinte segments for the five

364

subpopulations is 67 GB (W22×TIL01), 87 GB (W22×TIL03), 66 GB (W22×TIL11), 56

365

GB (W22×TIL14) and 79 GB (W22×TIL25), and the BC2S3 (W22×8759) exceeds this

366

range with 110 GB.
Previously, Shannon (2012) performed a comprehensive interval QTL analysis

367
368

for 16 agronomic traits in the BC2S3 population and identified 218 QTLs for 16 traits.

369

Among these traits, 14 traits were also scored in TeoNAM population. For the common

370

14 traits, 168 and 179 QTLs were detected for TeoNAM and BC 2 S3 population,

371

respectively. The mean QTL support interval across 14 traits for BC2 S3 is 5.7Mb, which

372

is significantly smaller than TeoNAM of 17.2Mb (P=2.6E-08) (Figure S50). Among these

373

QTLs, 50 QTLs overlapped between the two populations. For the common QTLs, the

374

mean variance explained by QTL is 3.4% and 2.9% for BC 2S3 and TeoNAM,

375

respectively. Thus, there is no significant difference in QTL effect size (P=0.3) (Figure

376

S51).

377

To maximize the power to detect QTLs, we combined TeoNAM and BC 2S3 for

378

eight traits (DTA, ED, EL, KRN, KW, GLCO, GLUM, and TILN) that were measured in

379

all six subpopulations by the exactly same method to perform JLM. Before analysis, we

380

imputed the genotype for BC 2S3 at 4578 TeoNAM SNPs according to the flanking

381

markers using the same procedure as for TeoNAM and permuted a new p-value cutoff

382

for statistical significance for each trait. The LSMs from previous analysis (Shannon

383

2012) were used for JLM. With the combined TeoNAM-BC2S3 data, we detected 184

384

QTLs for these eight traits, which include 109 QTLs overlapped with TeoNAM, 80 QTLs

385

overlapped with the BC2S3 and 32 novel QTLs not detected in either TeoNAM or the

386

BC2S3 (Table S4). The QTLs with significant allele effects in multiple subpopulations will

387

be good targets for fine-mapping. For future analysis of additional traits, one could

388

combine TeoNAM and the BC2S3 together. The value of this combination is that there is

389

one additional teosinte allele and increased QTL detection power, but the downside is

390

that one would need to assay the BC2S3 population with 866 RILs plus TeoNAM with

391

1257 RILs.

392

Discussion

393

RILs are powerful tools for dissecting complex genetic architecture of different

394

traits and for gene discovery. RILs such as maize NAM population have been

395

successfully used for genetic dissection of many traits (Buckler et al. 2009; Tian et al.

396

2011; Kump et al. 2011). RILs with the multiple parents greatly increase the power and

397

precision to identify QTLs compared to the traditional bi-parent RIL population. Multi-

398

parent RILs also enable the estimation of allele effects simultaneously from each inbred

399

parent. Our TeoNAM RILs were created by crossing five teosinte inbred parents with a

400

maize inbred parent, but differs from MaizeNAM in that we applied a generation of

401

backcrossing to the maize parent before four generations of selfing. The power and

402

precision of TeoNAM can be shown with several traits. For example, we detected 19

403

QTLs for DTA, among which many QTLs mapped to recently cloned genes such as

404

ZmCCT10, ZmCCT9, ZCN8, zagl1 and ZmMADS69. QTLs also mapped to some novel

405

candidates such as dlf1, si1, zag1, ZCN12, zmm19 and zmm31, which may have an

406

important role in flowering time regulation.

407

For RIL populations, both JLM and GWAS are common methods for QTL

408

detection. In this study, we identified 255 QTLs for 22 traits by JLM, and significant

409

peaks were detected at 57 QTLs by GWAS, which suggests that GWAS is less powerful

410

than JLM for mapping QTLs in TeoNAM. Nevertheless, there are a few instances in

411

which GWAS gave evidence of closely linked QTL that were not separated by JLM. For

412

example, we did not identify an1, a strong candidate for STAM QTL on chromosome 1

413

with JLM possibly because it’s closely linked to tb1 (candidate of QTL STAM1.1), but we

414

detected significant peaks at both an1 and tb1 through GWAS as it tests each SNP

415

independently.

416

TeoNAM has allowed us to infer distinct genetic architectures for different traits.

417

Traits like PROL and GLUM are controlled by a major effect QTL plus several QTLs of

418

very small effect, while traits like DTA and KRN show more classic polygenic

419

inheritance. These contrasting genetic architectures suggest that evolution during

420

domestication did not always follow the same path. A variant of large effect at one locus

421

with a few other small effect genes allowed naked kernels to evolve from covered

422

kernels, but the more quantitative increase in the number of kernel rows required a

423

larger number of genes with no single gene of substantially greater effect than all

424

others.

425

In our study, a total of 15 domestication traits and 7 agronomic traits were

426

analyzed. Further fine-mapping and gene cloning will be required to find the causal

427

genes underlying QTLs for these traits. TeoNAM should also be useful for investigating

428

genetic control of many new traits that we did not assay. Morphological traits such as

429

root architecture, shoot apical meristem size, vasculature, and kernel shape can be

430

explored. Also, molecular traits such as gene expression (eQTL), alternative splicing,

431

grain protein content, and metabolites can also be explored to better understand the full

432

spectrum of changes that occurred during maize domestication.

433
434

Materials and Methods

435

Population development

436

The teosinte NAM population was designed as a genetic resource for studying

437

maize genetics and domestication. Five wild teosinte parents were chosen with four

438

teosinte inbred lines that capture some diversity of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis (TIL01,

439

TIL03, TIL11 and TIL14) and one teosinte inbred line of Zea mays ssp. mexicana

440

(TIL25). The common parent is a modern maize inbred line W22 that has been widely

441

used in maize genetics. The five teosinte parents were crossed to W22, and followed by

442

one generation of backcross and four generations of selfing (Figure S1). We obtained

443

1257 BC1S4 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with 223, 270, 219, 235 and 310 lines for

444

W22×TIL01, W22×TIL03, W22×TIL11, W22×TIL14 and W22×TIL25, respectively.

446

All DNA samples of 1257 lines were genotyped using Genotype-by-Sequencing

447

(GBS) technology (Elshire et al. 2011). The genotypes were called from GBS raw

448

sequencing reads using the TASSEL5-GBS Production Pipeline based on 955,690

449

SNPs in the ZeaGBSv2.7 Production TagsOnPhysicalMap file (Glaubitz et al. 2014).

450

Then, the raw GBS markers were filtered in each RIL subpopulation using following

451

steps. We first removed sites with minor allele frequencies below 5% and thinned sites

452

with 64 bp apart using "Thin Sites by Position" in TASSEL5 (Bradbury et al. 2007), and

453

then we ran FSFHap Imputation in TASSEL5 separately for each chromosome using

454

the following parameters: backcross (bc), Phet=0.03125, Fillgaps=TRUE, and the

455

default settings for other features. The imputed parental call files from the 10

456

chromosomes were then combined together and passed to R/qtl (Broman et al. 2003) to

457

estimate genetic map. The B73 reference genome v2 was used to determine marker

458

order, and genetic distances between markers was calculated using the Haldane

459

mapping function as part of the est.map command with an assumed genotyping error

460

rate of 0.001 taking the BC 1S4 pedigree of the RIL into consideration (Shannon 2012).

461

Bad genetic markers were identified by visual inspection of the genetic map and

462

removed, then we repeated all filtering steps. Finally, an average of 13,733 high-quality

463

SNPs was obtained for each subpopulation (Table 1).

464

Field design and phenotyping

465

The teosinte NAM population was planted using a randomized complete block

466

design at the University of Wisconsin West Madison Agricultural Research Station (UW -

467

WMARS) in different years. The subpopulations W22×TIL01, W22×TIL03, W22×TIL11

468

were grown in summer 2015 and 2016, the subpopulation W22×TIL14 was grown in

469

summer 2016 and 2017, and the subpopulation W22×TIL25 was grown in summer 2017

470

with two blocks. We planted one subpopulation within each block, and all lines were

471

randomized within each block. Each row had 16 seeds planted with 1-foot apart, and

472

spacing between any two rows was 30-inch.

473

Twenty-two traits were scored (Table 2): days to anthesis (DTA) (number of days

474

between planting and when at least half the plants in a plot were shedding pollen); days

475

to silk (DTA) (number of days between planting and when at least half the plants in a

plot were showing silk); anthesis-silk interval (ASI) (number of days between anthesis

477

and silk); tassel branch number (TBN) (number of tassel branches on the main stalk);

478

culm diameter (CULM) (diameter of the narrowest plane of main stalk right above the

479

ground); plant height (PLHT) (distance from ground to the topmost node on the main

480

stalk); leaf length (LFLN) (length of a well-developed leaf, usually 4th-6th from top); leaf

481

width (LFWD) (width of a well-developed leaf, usually 4th-6th from top); tiller number

482

(TILN) (number of tillers surrounding main stalk); prolificacy (PROL) (0 vs. 1 for

483

absence/presence of secondary ears at the topmost branch-bearing node on the main

484

stalk); ear branch number (EB) (number of branch on the primary lateral inflorescence);

485

staminate spikelet (STAM) (0-3 scale for spikelet sex on the primary lateral

486

inflorescence, where 0 indicates completely feminized, and 3 indicates completely

487

staminate); kernel row number (KRN) (number of internode columns on the primary

488

lateral inflorescence); ear length (EL) (length of the primary lateral inflorescence); ear

489

diameter (ED) (diameter of the primary lateral inflorescence); kernel weight (KW)

490

(average weight of 50 random kernels from 5 ears); shattering (SHN) (number of pieces

491

into which an ear shattered when dropped to the floor from a height of ~1.8m); barren

492

ear base (BARE) (0-2 scale for lack of kernels at the base of ear, where 0 indicates

493

kernels present at the base, and 2 indicates no developed kernels at the base of the

494

ear); glume score (GLUM) (0-3 scale for glume size, where 0 indicates small and 3

495

indicates large); glume color (GLCO) (0-4 scale glume color for white through brown);

496

red pericarp (REPE) (0-2 scale for colorless to red pericarp); yellow pericarp (YEPE) (0-

497

2 scale for dull yellow to bright yellow pericarp). The average trait value from two years

498

were used for QTL analysis.

499

Genetic map construction and marker imputation

500

A composite genetic map was constructed for the TeoNAM population. The

501

markers from the five RIL subpopulations were combined together into 51,544 unique

502

SNPs, and the missing genotypes were imputed according to the flanking markers. If

503

the flanking markers have same genotypes, the missing genotype was imputed as the

504

same with flanking markers, otherwise left as missing. The imputed genotypes were

505

then passed to R/qtl software to estimate the genetic map.

506

Since stepwise regression cannot use individuals with missing marker data, we

507

performed a further step to impute missing data around break point as previously

508

described (Tian et al. 2011). First, we transformed genotype to numeric format, in which

509

markers with homozygous W22 parent were coded as 0, markers with homozygous

510

non-W22 parent were coded as 2, and markers with heterozygous genotypes were

511

coded as 1. Markers within breakpoint were imputed according to the genetic distance

512

of flanking two markers. Considering stepwise regression is computationally intensive,

513

we thinned SNPs within 0.1 cM. We finally obtained 4,578 markers for subsequent joint

514

linkage analysis.

515

Simple QTL mapping

516

QTL mapping was carried out using a modified version of R/qtl (Broman et al.,

517

2003) which takes into account the BC 1 S4 pedigree of the RILs (Shannon, 2012). For

518

each trait, a total of 1000 permutation tests were used to determine the significance

519

threshold level for claiming QTLs. After permutation, an approximate LOD score of 4.0

520

at P < 0.05 was obtained across all traits. With the LOD threshold, simple interval

521

mapping was first fitted using Haley-Knott regression implemented in the scanone

522

command of R/qtl. The multiple QTL model was then applied to search for additional

523

QTL and accurately refine QTL positions using refineqtl and addqtl in R/qtl. The entire

524

process was repeated until significant QTLs could no longer be added. The total

525

phenotypic variation explained by all QTLs was calculated from a full model that fitted all

526

QTL terms in the model using the fitqtl function. The percentage of phenotypic variation

527

explained by each QTL was estimated using a drop-one-ANOVA analysis implemented

528

with the fitqtl function. The confidence interval for each QTL was defined using a 1.5-

529

LOD support interval. To make results comparable among five subpopulations, the

530

composite genetic map was used for QTL mapping.

531

Joint linkage mapping

532

To map QTL in the TeoNAM population, a joint linkage mapping (JLM) procedure

533

was performed as previously described (Buckler et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2011). First, a

534

total of 1000 permutation were performed to determine the significance cutoff for each

535

trait. JLM was performed using the stepwise linear regression fixed model implemented

536

by PROC GLMSELECT procedure in SAS software. The family main effect was fit first,

537

and then marker effects nested within families were selected to enter or leave the model

538

based on the permutated P-value using a marginal F-test. After the model was fit with

539

stepwise regression, each marker was dropped from the full model one at a time and a

540

single best marker was refit to improve the overall fit of the model using the remaining

541

QTL as background. A threshold of α=0.05 was used to declare significant allele effects

542

across families within each QTL identified by stepwise regression. The QTL support

543

interval was calculated by adding each marker from the same chromosome of that QTL

544

at a time to the full model. If the p-value of the marginal F-test of the QTL was not

545

significant at the 0.01 level, the flanking marker should be in the support interval for the

546

QTL as the new flanking marker explained the QTL as well as the original marker.

547

GWAS
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was also used to map QTL

548
549

in the TeoNAM population. Since GBS produces relatively low-density markers, the

550

955,690 raw SNPs from GBS pipeline were filtered using a less conservative criteria:

551

MAF>0.01, missing rate < 0.75, and heterozygosity rate < 0.1. After this filtering,

552

181,404 GBS SNPs were used to run FSFHap Imputation in TASSEL5 separately for

553

each chromosome and subpopulation using the following parameters: backcross (bc),

554

Phet=0.03125, Fillgaps=TRUE, and the default settings for other features. Im puted

555

genotypes were then combined together and SNPs with missing rate more than 0.2 and

556

MAF less than 0.05 across 1257 RILs were removed and a total of 118,838 SNPs were

557

kept and used for GWAS. GWAS was performed using a linear mixed model accounting

558

for population structure (Q) and kinship matrix (K), where Q was computed as the first

559

five principle components and K was calculated using centered IBS method as

560

implemented in TASSEL (Bradbury et al. 2007). The P value below P=0.00001 (LOD=5)

561

was considered as significance threshold following a previous study (Kremling et al.

562

2018).

QTL candidate analysis
To report the QTL position following the latest genomic version, we used the

565

CrossMap (Zhao et al. 2014) software to uplift the GBS SNP positions from maize B73

566

reference AGPv2 coordinates to AGPv4 coordinates. QTL candidates were analyzed by

567

checking the gene annotations of genes within QTL support intervals.

568

Data Availability

569

Seeds for all 1257 RILs are available through the Maize Genetics Cooperative

570

Stock Center and the SNP genotypes of TeoNAM are available at the Cyverse

571

Discovery Environment under the directory:

572

/iplant/home/shared/panzea/genotypes/GBS/TeosinteNAM/. The genotypes were

573

uploaded with AGPv2 position in the marker name.

Figure 1 Genomic distribution of QTLs for all 22 traits in TeoNAM. The 22 agronomic
(A) and domestication (B) traits are plotted in layers with different background colors,
following the order of ASI, BARE, DTA, DTS, PLHT, TBN, YEPE, CULM, EB, ED, EL,
GLCO, GLUM, KRN, KW, LFLN, LFWD, PROL, REPE, SHN, STAM and TILN
outwards. Black dots indicate QTL peaks detected by JLM and colored bars indicate the
support interval of QTLs for different traits. The heat map in the outmost layer (C) shows
the number of QTL peaks using a sliding window of 10 cM and 1 cM steps, where low to
high density of QTLs (0-12) are shown in light to dark red, respectively.

Figure 2 Distinct genetic architectures for different traits. The nine traits that we focused
in the main text are shown. The horizontal axis indicates QTLs and the vertical axis
indicates the phenotypic variation explained by each QTL (R 2 ). Red number indicates
variance explained by the QTL model for each trait. The R2 distribution for 13 additional
traits can be found in Figure S28.

Figure 3. QTL characterization for agronomic trait DTA. (A) Genomic distribution of 19
QTLs for DTA detected by JLM. The known candidate genes are shown above the
corresponding QTLs in bold italic. (B) Heat map shows additive allele effects of teosinte
relative to maize in number of days for 19 QTLs detected by JLM. The allele effect of
teosinte parent 8759 was estimated from the 866 maize-teosinte BC2 S3 RILs (Shannon
2012). Insignificant effects are shown as blank. Red and blue color indicates that the
teosinte allele delays or promotes flowering time, respectively. (C) Manhattan plot
shows QTLs detected by GWAS. The significance threshold at LOD=5 is indicated by
black dotted line. The red stars indicate GWAS signals overlapping with QTLs by JLM.
In (A) and (C), chromosomes in odd and even numbers are shown in blue and orange
colors, respectively.

Figure 4 QTL characterization for domestication trait STAM. (A) Genomic distribution of
five QTLs for STAM detected by JLM. The known candidate genes are shown above
the corresponding QTLs in bold italic. (B) Heat map shows additive allele effects of
teosinte relative to maize for five QTLs detected by JLM. The allele effect of teosinte
parent 8759 was estimated from the 866 maize-teosinte BC2S3 RILs (Shannon 2012).
Insignificant effects are shown as blank. The teosinte genotypes at all QTLs consistently
contribute to a staminate lateral inflorescence. (C) Manhattan plot shows QTLs detected
by GWAS. The significance threshold at LOD=5 is indicated by black dotted line. The
red stars indicate GWAS signals overlapping with QTLs by JLM. In (A) and (C),
chromosomes in odd and even numbers are shown in blue and orange colors ,
respectively.
