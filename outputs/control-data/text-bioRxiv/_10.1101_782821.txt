Abstract

21

Elucidating how the diverse evolutionary mechanisms interact to determine species diversification is

22

crucial to understanding the evolution and persistence of biodiversity. The genus Aquilegia (columbine)

23

is a model system to identify genetic and epigenetic signatures underpinning the rapid adaptive

24

radiation. In this study, we surveyed the genomes and DNA methylomes of ten worldwide Aquilegia

25

species to investigate whether specific genomic architectures were associated with rapid species

26

diversification in the Asian, European and North American lineages. The resulting phylogenies and

27

population structure inferences revealed clearly high genetic and DNA methylomic divergence among

28

the three lineages. Genome-wide scanning demonstrated significantly higher positive and purifying

29

selection pressures among the Asian species compared to the European and North American lineages.

30

More importantly, candidate genes identified at the genetic and epigenetic levels are functionally

31

related to diverse adaptation-related traits, such as stress tolerance, photosynthesis and cell

32

reproduction. While a considerable proportion of the candidate genes share hotspots of intra- and inter-

33

lineage divergence, genetic and epigenetic factors were found to act on complementary biological

34

pathways. By assessing the interaction between genetic variations and epigenetic variability, we found

35

that epigenetic variability is a partially independent factor that intertwines with genetic mechanism to

36

facilitate the diversification of the Aquilegia species. Taken together, these findings suggest that specific

37

genetic architectures have been involved in vital biological pathways in response to diverse

38

environmental conditions and epigenetic modifications may play a complementary role in the process of

39

adaptive speciation. Our study provides an exploratory overview of how the established genetic and

40

epigenetic signatures are associated with the rapid species diversification of Aquilegia species.

Author Summary

46

Disentangling the genetic and epigenetic bases underpinning species diversification is crucial to

47

understanding the evolution and persistence of biodiversity. The columbine (genus Aquilegia) is a model

48

system to address biological mechanisms associated with rapid adaptive radiation. We surveyed the

49

genomes and DNA methylomes of ten worldwide columbine species to investigate whether specific

50

genetic and epigenetic architectures were involved in the diversification of Asian, European and North

51

American columbine species. We pinpointed candidate genes featuring rapid adaptive radiation

52

identified at either the genetic or the epigenetic levels. These candidate genes are functionally

53

associated with diverse adaptation-related traits such as cell reproduction, plant growth, and stress

54

tolerance. Such genetic and epigenetic signatures have potential contributed adaptabilities to the

55

columbine species to cope with diverse environmental conditions. In addition, we also showed that

56

epigenetic modifications could act as a complementary factor that intertwined with genetic mechanism

57

to facilitate the diversification of the columbine species. In all, our study provides a genome-wide view

58

of how the genetic and epigenetic factors are associated with the rapid species diversification of the

59

columbine species.

Introduction

62

Adaptive radiation is the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into a vast array of common

63

descendants that inhabit different ecological niches or use a variety of resources, but differ in

64

phenotypic traits required to exploit diverse environments [1-4]. Disentangling the evolutionary

65

mechanisms underpinning adaptive radiation is fundamental to understanding the evolution and

66

persistence of biodiversity (5, 6). This has been a key focus of many studies investigating different

67

animal and plant lineages that diversified through adaptive radiation, including Hawaiian silversword,

68

Caribbean anoles, Darwin’s finches, and African cichlids (7-10). However, it remains under-investigated

69

as to why some lineages could diversify rapidly but their close relatives or other sympatrically

70

distributed lineages did not. In the past decades, accumulating evidence from diverse radiation lineages

71

suggests that both the extrinsic environmental variables (e.g., resource availability) and intrinsic factors

72

(e.g., genetic variants determine lineage-specific morphological variations) are the potential

73

mechanisms in determining the rate and volume of species diversification [11]. Among the

74

environmental triggers, ecological opportunity is considered as the primary mechanism that causes

75

rapid adaptive radiation through the acquisition of key innovations, invasion of new environments and

76

extinction of competitors [2, 12]. On the other hand, new species can also arise as a result of multiple

77

evolutionary mechanisms (e.g. natural selection) acting on genetic factors (e.g., advantage alleles) that

78

ultimately influence the phenotypic disparity among closely related species [13]. An illustration of rapid

79

adaptive radiation is the African cichlid fishes, on which the extrinsic environmental factors (e.g.,

80

ecological specialization) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., adaptive introgression) acted together to

81

provoke the repeated adaptive radiation in geographically isolated lakes [10, 11, 14, 15].

82

The genus Aquilegia L. (columbine) is a well-recognized model system to address the evolutionary

83

mechanisms underlying rapid adaptive radiation [16, 17]. This genus includes approximately 70 recently

84

diversified species that are widely distributed in the temperate areas of North America and Eurasia [18].

85

Phylogenetic and geographic inferences have illustrated two independent adaptive radiations of North

86

American and European lineages from the distinct ancestral Asian species [16, 19]. For example, floral

87

diversification of the North American Aquilegia species is highly correlated with the pollinator

88

specialization [20-23]. In contrast, ecological adaptation and geographic isolation are considered as the

89

major driving forces that promoted rapid radiation of the European species [16, 24]. In Asia, changes in

90

pollinator and ecological habitat are both proposed to be the underpinning mechanisms that resulted in

91

the diversification of more than 20 morphologically distinct species [25, 26]. These Asian Aquilegia

92

species constitute four highly divergent lineages corresponding to respective geographic origins and

93

evolved relatively independent under distinct external conditions [25, 26]. This well-described

94

evolutionary history renders the Aquilegia species an ideal system to address how the extrinsic and

95

intrinsic factors shaped genome-wide genetic and epigenetic variation patterns.

96

In this study, we survey the genomes and DNA methylomes of 36 accessions from ten worldwide

97

Aquilegia species to elucidate the genetic and epigenetic bases underlying rapid diversification of the

98

Asian, European and North American Aquilegia species. Among the Asian species, four phylogenetically

99

distinct species (A. japonica, A. oxysepala, A. yabeana, and A. viridiflora) are selected according to their

100

geographic distributions and ecological habitats. Aquilegia japonica and A. oxysepala are sister species

101

inhabiting alpine tundra and low altitude forest niches in northeastern China, respectively [26, 27]. Our

102

previous studies have documented that natural selection during ecological specialization together with

103

genetic drift under geographic isolation caused the rapid evolution of reproductive isolation between

104

these two species [26, 28]. Here, we further investigate how diverse evolutionary driving forces shaped

105

genetic and epigenetic architectures of the two species in the processes of speciation and adaptation. In

106

addition, we also evaluated patterns of nucleotide variation and cytosine methylation in the A. yabeana

107

and A. viridiflora. The former species shares highly similar morphological traits and ecological niches

108

with the A. oxysepala but is allopatrically distributed in the northern China. In contrast, while the A.

109

viridiflora is sympatrically distributed with A. yabeana and A. oxysepala in the northern and

110

northeastern China, it often occupies rocky and sandy ecological niches. As a supplementary, we also

111

examined nucleotide and cytosine methylation variation patterns of the North American and European

112

lineages to investigate how the distinct evolutionary mechanisms shaped genomic and epigenomic

113

architectures on a genome-wide scale. Our study will provide a genome-wide view of how the genetic

114

and epigenetic architectures associated with the phenotypic divergence and ecological specialization of

115

the Aquilegia species.

118

Population structure and nucleotide variation pattern

119

Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were reconstructed for the 36 Aquilegia accessions based on 689,123

120

homozygous SNPs. The established phylogenies showed that accessions of the ten species formed three

121

distinct lineages corresponding to their geographic origins (Figure 1a and Figure S1). In brief, all the 22

122

accessions of the four East Asian species, A. japonica, A. oxysepala, A. yabeana and A. viridiflora,

123

clustered as a monophyletic lineage, with the former two species and their hybrid forming a clade and

124

the latter two species grouping as a sister clade. In contrast, the West Asian species A. fragrans

125

clustered with geographically adjoining European species. Within the North American lineage,

126

phylogenetic relationships of the four species varied across the seven chromosomes. In particular, one

127

European accession of the A. alpina var. alba fell into the North American lineage at the chromosomes 1

128

and 3. Likewise, the principal component analysis (PCA) and population structure inferences also

129

revealed distinct genetic structure of the three phylogenetic lineages (Figure 1b and c). Consistent with

130

the above phylogenies, one A. alpina var. alba accession shared the same ancestral genetic cluster with

131

the North American lineage and the putative hybrid of the A. oxysepala and A. japonica possessed a

132

mixed genomic constitution (Figure 1b and c).

133

To further gain genome-wide nucleotide variation pattern of the ten Aquilegia species, we

134

calculated nucleotide diversity (π) and genetic divergence (FST) for each chromosome and 100-kb sliding

135

window, respectively. Among the three phylogenetic lineages, the Asian Aquilegia species harbored

136

relatively higher nucleotide diversity compared to the European and North American lineages across the

137

seven chromosomes (Figure S2). By comparing the nucleotide diversity for each 100-kb sliding window,

138

we observed a moderate correlation of genome-wide variation pattern among the three lineages

139

(Spearman R = 0.40-0.52) and a high correlation between the A. oxysepala and A. japonica (Spearman R

140

= 0.83) (Figure S3). In particular, 116 of 260 low genetic diversity genomic regions (LDGRs, the top 5%

141

lowest π) were shared by at least two of the three lineages (Figure S4). Between the A. oxysepala and A.

142

japonica, while we defined 148 LDGRs and 148 high divergence genomic regions (HDGRs, 5% highest FST),

143

only seven candidate genomic regions showed overlap between the HDGRs and LDGRs (Table S1).

144
145

Identification of the genes indicating selection pressure and highly impactful genetic variations

146

Candidate genes associated with the adaptive divergence were determined according to the following

147

three strategies. First, we considered the genes localized within the HDGRs and LDGRs more prone to be

148

exposed to selection in the adaptive evolution process. Under this hypothesis, we identified 23 genes

149

from the above seven candidate genomic regions between the A. oxysepala and A. japonica (Table S1).

150

Genes within these genomic regions were functionally associated with meiotic nuclear division, adenine

151

methyltransferase and basic cellar activities.

152

The first strategy mainly relied on genome-wide scanning for 100-kb non-overlapping sliding

153

window. We next employed a functional annotation-based approach to identify highly impactful

154

conservative clade-specific variations (CCVs; e.g., frameshift mutations, stop mutation and splicing

155

alteration) from both the within and between lineage comparisons. Our results revealed that a

156

considerable proportion (17.9-40.5%) of the CCVs were identified in the gene body regions (Table

).

157

We then examined the potential impacts of these identified CCVs on gene functions. Between the A.

158

oxysepala and A. japonica, the CCV-carrying genes were enriched in several vital biological pathways

159

related to cell reproduction, including telomere maintenance, DNA repair, and DNA helicase activity

160

(Figure 2 and Table 1). For example, two candidate genes (Aqcoe6G160300 and Aqcoe7G062500) coding

161

for Xklp2 (TPX2) were functionally correlated with spindle assembly during the mitotic process [29, 30].

162

Among the three phylogenetic lineages, the CCVs-harboring genes were also functionally involved in the

163

mitotic chromosome condensation, DNA ligase activity and aminopeptidase activity (Figure 2 and Table

167

). For instance, two CCV-containing genes (Aqcoe2G276600 and Aqcoe1G273400) encoding DNA

Thirdly, we also performed genome-wide scanning to identify genes informative of selection

168

pressure from the within and between lineage comparisons. By estimating the pair-wise synonymous (dS)

169

and non-synonymous (dN) mutation rate, we found that species within the Asian lineage experienced

170

significantly higher positive (dN/dS > 1) and purifying (dN/dS < 1) selection pressures compared to the

171

European and North American lineages (Wilcoxon rank sum test, all Bonferroni-corrected p values <

172

1.5x10-16) (Figure

174

Among the three lineages, all the comparisons showed significant purifying and positive selection

175

pressures (Wilcoxon rank sum test, all Bonferroni-corrected p values < 0.0018) except those that

176

indicated positive selection between the North American and the other two lineages (Wilcoxon rank

). Likewise, the European species showed significant purifying selection (Wilcoxon

CG methylation patterns and differentially methylated genes

180

In parallel with the above genomic analyses, we also investigated CG methylation pattern of the

181

representative Aquilegia species. Despite variance across the 36 Aquilegia accessions, the North

182

American, Asian and European species showed no distinguishable differences (t test, all Bonferroni-

183

corrected p values > 0.01) in overall percentage of methylated cytosines (Figure 3a). We then performed

184

PCA to examine CG-cytosine methylomic relatedness of all the Aquilegia accessions. The resulting

185

overall methylation pattern highly resembled the above genomic inferences, with the European and

186

American species forming two independent groups and the four Asian species forming three separated

187

clusters (Figure

188

American lineages as well as the three Asian species (A. japonica, A. oxysepala and A. viridiflora)

). We then assessed the CG methylation patterns for the European and North

189

separately. Consistent with the described genomic features, heterogeneous pattern of the CG

190

methylation was also observed among the seven chromosomes, with the chromosome 4 demonstrating

191

obviously higher overall CG methylation divergence compared to the other six chromosomes (Figure 3b).

192

We further quantified CG methylation deposited in the genic regions, putative cis-regulatory regions and

193

CG island, respectively. In genic and regulatory regions, all three lineages shared similar modification

194

patterns with apparent depletion of CG methylation around the transcription start site (TSS) and

195

transcription end site (TES) (Figure

196

(more than 10%) around the center of CG islands and a more drastic decrease throughout the CG island

197

shores compared to the European and Asian species (Figure 3d).

). However, the American lineage exhibited hyper-methylation

3c

198

To examine the biological impacts of CG methylation on the species diversification, differentially

199

methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified from both the

200

within and between thee three lineages, respectively (Tables S3 and S4). Within the Asian lineage, 3,622

201

DMRs in 2,899 DMGs were identified between the A. japonica and A. oxysepala. Functional enrichment

202

of these DMGs indicated that the two species may have different activities in photosynthesis-related

203

pathways, including photosystem I, photosynthesis and chloroplast (Figure 2). For example, two

204

photosynthesis-related genes, PsaA/PsaB and CemA, showed significantly differential methylation

205

between the two species in the genic regions (Figure S7a and b). At the inter-lineage level, apparently

206

more DMGs were identified between the North American and European species (6,087 genes)

207

compared to those of between the two lineages and Asian species (3,308-5,003 genes) (Table S3 and S4).

208

DMGs characterized from the inter-lineage comparisons were mainly involved in the plant growth (e.g.,

209

response to auxin) and defense, response to biotic stimulus and wounding (Figure 2).

210

We then examined whether the candidate genes (CCV-carrying genes and DMGs) superimposed on

211

the same signature of natural selection. We found while a considerable proportion of the candidate

genes were shared for each of the genetic and epigenetic assessments (Figure

Association between epigenetic variability and genetic variations

Since both genetic variation and differential CG methylation seemed to have crucial and multifaceted

220

influences on the adaptation of the ten Aquilegia species, we wondered whether differential epigenetic

221

modifications were dependent on genetic variability. Among the 588,659 CG sites examined, 224,222

222

(38.09%) carried a CG-loss variation. We then illustrated epigenetic variability for the variation-carrying

223

and non-variant CG sites, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, genetic-epigenetic associations of varying

224

magnitude were observed in both types of CG sites. The variation-carrying CG sites conveyed

225

information that highly resembled their genetic background. The overall methylation pattern was highly

226

conserved within the same species but exhibited obvious divergence across the ten Aquilegia species

227

(Figure

228

variability at both the intra- and inter-specific levels (Figure 4b). By examining the correlation of genetic

229

variability and cytosine methylation, we found that CG methylation divergence at variation-carrying CG-

230

site was largely attributable to the CG-loss variations (Figure

231

variations occurring at the most highly variable CG-methylated dinucleotides could explain at least 75%

232

of the total epigenetic variability per se. Nevertheless, there was still a considerable proportion of

233

epigenetic variability that could not be sufficiently explained by the variant-CG site (Figure 4d).

). In contrast, CG methylation divergence at the non-variant CG sites varied with higher

could probably assist selection pressure in shaping genotypes. In contrast, DMGs were significantly less

Elucidating evolutionary mechanisms underpinning species diversification is crucial to understanding the

evolution and persistence of biodiversity [2, 5, 6]. The genus Aquilegia provides an ideal system to

address how the diverse evolutionary mechanisms promoted rapid adaptive radiation [16, 17]. Although

250

various environmental conditions related to ecological opportunities, such as shifts in pollinator and

habitat, have been proposed to facilitate the evolution of reproductive isolation [22, 26], genetic basis

252

associated with the rapid diversification of Aquilegia species has still remained largely unclear. In this

253

study, we surveyed the genomes of ten worldwide Aquilegia species to address whether specific genetic

254

architectures have been involved in the rapid species diversification. Broadly consistent with previously

255

inferred phylogenies [16, 19, 26, 28], the ten Aquilegia species from Asia, Europe and North America

256

formed three phylogenetically independent lineages corresponding to their geographic origins. This

257

attribute offers the ten Aquilegia species a suitable system to identify genomic determinants associated

258

with the repeated adaptive speciation by extensive comparisons from different facets.

259

It has been proposed that if a genetic factor is the potential determinant promoting adaptive

260

speciation, one would expect to identify specific genetic architectures in the diversified lineages [9, 14,

261

32]. In Darwin’s finches, for example, polyphyletic topology was observed as a general pattern in 14

262

morphologically distinct species, phenotypic diversity of the beak shape was mainly determined by

263

natural selection acting on the ALX1 gene during the ecological specialization process [9]. A similar

264

phenomenon was observed in the East African cichlid fish where the radiating lineages are more

265

dynamic in terms of gene content and transcriptomic landscape compared to their non-radiating

266

relatives [14, 32]. In this study, while the Asian, European and North American species have clearly

267

diverged and evolved allopatrically in respective geographic regions, similar genome-wide nucleotide

268

variation pattern was observed among the three lineages, suggesting that a considerable of the genomic

269

variants might have evolved naturally during the diversification process. Nevertheless, while both the

270

North American and European lineages were descendants of the ancestral Asian species, shifts in

271

pollinator and ecological habitat are supposed to drive the independent adaptive radiations,

272

respectively [16, 17, 19]. This attribute suggest that specific genetic determinants are potentially related

273

to the repeated adaptive speciation of the Aquilegia species. As expected, our genome-wide scanning of

274

selection not only revealed higher positive and purifying selection pressures among the Asian species,

275

but also demonstrated significant differences in selection pressures in all inter-lineage comparisons

276

excepting these of experienced positive selection in North American and European lineages. More

277

importantly, the CCV-carrying genes identified from the three lineages are associated with cell

278

reproduction (e.g., telomere maintenance and mitotic chromosome condensation) and some other

279

functionally important pathways, indicating distinct selection pressures in specific lineages of these loss

280

function genes.

281

Similar genomic feature was also observed in the two ecological species A. japonica and A.

282

oxysepala. Our previous studies have demonstrated that natural selection and genetic drift together

283

resulted in the rapid evolution of reproductive isolation [26, 28]. Here, we further demonstrated that

285

cell reproduction (e.g., telomere maintenance), stress tolerance (e.g., response to wounding) and basic

286

cellular activities. These findings from intra- and inter-lineage comparisons suggest that specific genetic

287

architectures might have played important roles in the repeated adaptive speciation of the Aquilegia

288

species. It should be noted that although a majority of the enriched pathways are specific to each

289

comparison, enrichment of cell reproduction-related pathways (e.g., telomere maintenance, DNA repair

290

and DNA helicase activity) is consistent across the intra- and inter-lineage comparisons. Taken together,

291

our study indicates that both the common and specific genetic determinants might have conferred high

292

adaptability to the Aquilegia species to cope with diverse environmental conditions.

Evolutionary potential of cytosine methylation in the adaptation of

295

The role of epigenetic modification in the long-term evolutionary process has long been debated [33-35].

296

It has been proposed that epigenetic variations are frequently under the genetic control but which can

297

also alter rapidly as a result of environmental induction and stochastic epimutation [36, 37].

298

Nevertheless, it has also been recognized that some epigenetic variants can persist over generations and

299

be highly correlated with phenotypic diversity [35]. As illustrated in Arabidopsis, changes in cytosine

300

methylation can produce meiotically stable epialleles, which could eventually lead to phenotypic

301

diversity in the absence of genetic variations [38-40]. Here, we assessed whether the epigenetic

302

modifications are also associated with the adaptive speciation of the Aquilegia species. Consistent with

303

the genomic features detailed above, high divergence of cytosine methylation was observed across the

304

Asian, European and North American lineages. Nevertheless, differential cytosine methylation is not

305

only found across the seven chromosomes but also evident in the gene body of DMGs and CG island

306

region among the three lineages. Particularly, functional enrichment analyses identified significant

307

associations with adaptation-related traits, including plant growth, stress tolerance and basic cellular

308

activities. Between the A. japonica and A. oxysepala, for example, the identified DMGs showed

309

significant enrichment in categories related to diverse important phenotypic traits, such as

310

photosynthesis, embryo development and response to auxin. These epigenomic features indicate that

311

epigenetic factors may also play a role in response to diverse environmental conditions.

species

312

We noted that some candidate genes and enriched pathways shared hotspots of both genetic and

313

epigenetic disparities, especially those related to cell reproduction, plant growth and stress tolerance.

314

Many studies based on human and mouse have shown genetic variations can not only directly control

315

CG methylation patterns [41, 42], but also manipulate long-range CG methylation at specific sites to

316

further influence phenotypes, where CG methylation serves as a mediator [43, 44]. However, precedent

317

studies on explaining, in a time-span of evolutionary history, whether CG methylation functions

318

independent of genetic variations are few to our knowledge. To this end, we asked whether the

319

epigenetic mechanism works independently without certain genetic control. By analyzing the

320

associations between genetic and epigenetic variability, we conclude that while many CG-loss variations

321

can directly lead to depletion of CG methylation, a lot of DMRs are not manipulated by any cis-variations.

322

Since gene body CG methylation in plants generally stabilizes gene expression and is positively

323

correlated with gene expression [45-48], differential methylation in our study is indicative of the amount

324

of eventual gene products. Based on these attributes together with the informative associations

325

between differential methylation (DMGs) and positive selection (dN/dS), we propose that epigenetic

326

modification is a complementary mechanism facilitating phenotypic diversity of the Aquilegia species.

327
328

Limitations and future directions

329

Our study has important limitations. First of all, the small sample size in our study may introduce bias

330

and inflation of false positives, and we postulate that our findings should be interpreted carefully and

331

considered exploratory. When investigating the association between genetic divergence and

332

evolutionary events, it is impossible to deny the roles of other evolutionary forces. We acknowledge

333

that the lineage-specific allele frequencies are possibly consequences of genetic drift and that genetic

334

hitchhiking may lead to identification of candidate genes residing in neighboring genomic regions

335

representing the same driving force. Therefore, we claim that the candidate genes identified to be

336

associated with adaptive radiation do not necessarily point towards driving evolutionary mechanisms.

337

They may also be by-products of the long-term process of adaptive radiation. Besides, we only focused

338

on analysis of CG methylation as puzzles persist regarding the functional roles of CHG and CHH

339

methylation. While our sample size is not sufficient to yield enough statistical power even if such trans-

340

association tests were to be performed, our findings at least suggest that the epigenetic variability also

341

possesses autonomy to some extent.

Methods and Materials

344

Sample collection, DNA extraction and sequencing

345

In this study, a total of 36 accessions from ten worldwide Aquilegia species were collected (Table

346

Among these samples, 18 accessions were collected to represent the two Asian species, A. japonica and

347

A. oxysepala, and their putative hybrid. In addition, four accessions were collected from the other two

348

Asian species A. yabeana and A. viridiflora. Furthermore, six and eight accessions were sampled from

349

the European and North American lineages, respectively. All the 36 accessions were grown in green

350

house under the same conditions (25°C/12 hours, 16°C/12 hours). Genomic DNA was extracted from

351

fresh mature leaves using TianGen plant genomic DNA kit. Whole genome resequencing and bisulfite

352

sequencing were performed on the extracted genomic DNA using the Illumina X-ten platform (Illumina,

353

California, USA). Short-insert (350 bp) DNA libraries of all accessions were constructed by NovoGene

354

(NovoGene, Tianjin, China). Genome assembly of an admixed species A. coerulea “Goldsmith” was

355

obtained from Phytozome v12.1 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov) as the reference genome [17]. All data

356

generated from the study were submitted to EBI under the accession number PRJEB34182.

357
358

Sequence assembly, population genetic structure and functional annotation

359

Whole genome sequences of each accession were aligned against the reference genome using Burrows-

360

Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [49]. Raw assemblies were realigned using IndelRealigner provided in the

361

Genome Analysis Tool Kit [50]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions

362

(INDELs) were reported using SAMtools [51]. Only the high-quality variants (SNPs and INDELs) (read

363

depth > 3, mapping quality > 20 and missing allele < 1%) were retained for subsequent population

364

genomics analyses. Genomic context and predicted functional effects of the identified variants were

365

reported for each of the 36 samples separately. Intergenic variants occurring within 5 kb up- and down-

366

stream of TSS or TES were defined as regulatory variations. Functional annotation of each identified

367

variant was performed using SnpEff [52].

368

To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the ten Aquilegia species, NJ trees were reconstructed for

369

each chromosome and the whole genome dataset using MEGA 7 [53]. PCA was also carried out to

370

examine the genetic relatedness of the 36 Aquilegia accessions [54]. Ancestral components were

371

estimated using ADMIXTURE [55] with the assumed population number ranging from one to ten.

372

Optimal population composition with the least cross-validation error was selected to decompose

373

ancestral admixture. To obtain the genome-wide nucleotide variation pattern, nucleotide diversity (π)

374

and genetic differentiation (Weir and Cockerham’s FST) were calculated for each 100 kb non-overlapping

375

sliding window using VCFtools [56, 57]. Pair-wise non-synonymous-to-synonymous (dN/dS) ratios of the

376

ten species were inferred by yn00 program in the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML)

377

package [58]. Inter-lineage dN/dS value for each gene was derived by averaging dN/dS values obtained

378

from all pairwise comparisons of samples belonging to the two lineages under investigation. Candidate

379

genes with the 5% highest and 5% lowest dN/dS values were considered to have undergone strong

380

positive and purifying selection, respectively.

Cytosine methylation pattern and epigenetic population structure

383

Whole genome bisulfite sequencing data were pre-processed using TrimGalore (https://www.

384

bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, accessed August 21, 2018). Trimmed paired-end

385

reads were aligned to the reference genome using Bismark [59] with a moderately stringent minimum-

386

score function (L,0,-0.3). De-duplicated alignments of the 36 Aquilegia accessions were used to report

387

cytosine methylation level using bismark_methylation_extractor, on loci with a read depth ≥ 3. Genomic

388

annotations of the methylated cytosine site were identified based on the reference genome using an in-

389

house Python script. PCA was conducted to infer the CG-methylomic relatedness of the ten Aquilegia

390

species. Differential cytosine methylation was determined at both the gene and chromosome levels,

391

respectively. At the gene level, we determined DMRs for each 100 bp non-overlapping sliding window

392

using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test to account for imbalanced read depth (Supplementary

393

Notes). Genomic regions that possess a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value < 0.05 and show inter-

394

specific or inter-lineage methylation divergence higher than 25% are defined as significant DMRs. Genes

395

with > 20% of the genic region being DMR(s) were defined as DMGs. Chromosome-level methylation

396

patterns were measured by chromosomal methylation discrepancy index (MDI) [60]. Methylation

397

patterns of the identified DMGs were visually verified on Integrative Genomics Viewer [61] prior to

398

downstream analyses and biological interpretation. In addition, we identified CG islands from the A.

399

coerulea “Goldsmith” reference genome using EMBOSS cpgplot with default settings [62]. Only the

400

identified CG-enriched genomic regions with > 200 bp were defined as CG islands. We then investigated

401

inter-specific and inter-lineage methylation divergence in and around the CG islands.

402
403

Associations between the genetic variation and cytosine methylation

404

To address how the genetic and epigenetic variations interacted to promote species diversification, we

405

tested for associations between the identified DMGs and genes under positive selection by a Chi-square

406

test. Linear regression model was adopted to measure the direct causal effect of CG-loss variation on CG

407

methylation. To further assess whether genetic variations drive the establishment of DMG, driving

408

mutations of DMRs between the A. japonica and A. oxysepala were identified using an Eigenstrat

409

method (See Supplementary Notes for more details) [63].

412

CCVs were defined as these that were conserved across all samples belonging to the same

413

species/lineage but not present in any sample of the other species/lineages. Since the biological

414

consequences of heterozygous variants are less affirmable, only the homozygous point mutations and

415

INDELs were considered in the characterization of CCVs, including frameshift, stop-gain, stop-loss, start-

416

loss and splicing-alteration variations.

417
418

Functional enrichment analysis

419

The aforementioned genetic and epigenetic analyses identified candidate genes that might be

420

associated with the rapid diversification of the Aquilegia species from different perspectives. These

421

candidate genes were employed to conduct functional enrichment analyses using R package topGO [64].

422

Enriched GO terms that possessed a p value <0.05 and has an occurrence ≥ 5 in the background were

423

considered statistically significant. Since the statistical tests performed by topGO are not independent,

424

multiple testing correction does not apply [64]. Structures of functional domains of targeted genes were

425

determined based on the InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro, accessed January 25,

426

2019). Distribution pattern of the identified candidate genes and their related functional pathways was

427

visualized using the R package jvenn [65].

: Each percentage represents the proportion of genes belonging to either DMGs or non-DMGs
compared between the two corresponding clades that are under corresponding or higher strength of
positive selection. For example, 7.2% indicates that 7.2% DMGs compared between A. japonica and A.
oxysepala are under strong selection; 4.4% indicates that 4.4% non-DMGs compared between these two
species are under strong selection. p values were obtained from Chi-square tests and were not adjusted
for multiple testing due to dependence arising from overlapping gene sets.
