Abstract
The calcium-permeable transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel plays a
key role in redox sensation in many cell types

1-3

. Channel activation requires binding of both

ADP-ribose (ADPR) 2,4-6 and Ca2+ 7. The recently published TRPM2 structures from Danio rerio
in the ligand-free and in the ADPR/Ca2+-bound conditions represent the channel in closed and
open states, which uncover substantial tertiary and quaternary conformational rearrangements 8.
However, it is unclear how these rearrangements occur within the tetrameric channel during
channel gating. Here we report two cryo-electron microscopy structures of TRPM2 from the same
species in complex with Ca2+ alone, and with both ADPR and Ca2+, determined to an overall
resolution of ~3.8 Å and ~4.2 Å respectively. In comparison with the published results, our studies
capture TRPM2 in two-fold symmetric intermediate states, offering a glimpse of the structural
transitions within the tetramer that bridge the closed and open conformations.

Main
The transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channel family is part of the TRP
channel superfamily and comprises eight members (TRPM1 to TRPM8) that carry out diverse
functions in a variety of physiological pathways 9. TRPM2 is a calcium-permeable non-selective
cation channel that is widely expressed in the nervous, immune, and endocrine systems, and plays
a crucial role in warmth and redox-dependent signaling 1-3. Studies of TRPM2-deficient mice have
shown that TRPM2 channels expressed in sensory and central neurons are responsible for
sensation of warm temperatures and body temperature regulation 10,11. TRPM2 has also been found
to be activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), consequently playing a key role in Ca2+ signaling
involved in chemokine production, insulin production, and cell death under oxidative stress 12-16.
Extensive electrophysiological studies have shown that activation of TRPM2 by ROS is
caused by an increase of intracellular ADP-ribose (ADPR), a TRPM2 agonist, and that both ADPR
and Ca2+ are required for channel activation 2,4-7,17. Notably, TRPM2 contains a putative enzyme
domain, called the Nudix Hydrolase 9 Homology (NUDT9H) domain located at the C-terminus,
which exhibits a high degree of homology to the mitochondrial ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase
NUDT9

18,19

. As such, TRPM2 was initially classified as a channel-enzyme in which enzymatic

activity was believed to be coupled to channel gating 2,18. However, subsequent studies have since
repudiated this mechanism, as the NUDT9H domain lacks enzymatic activity. Instead it has been
suggested that the NUDT9H domain merely serves as a binding site for ADPR 20.
Recently, structures of the zebrafish Danio rerio TRPM2 were reported in the ligand-free
closed state and in the ADPR/Ca2+-bound open state (hereafter referred to as TRPM2DR_closed and
TRPM2DR_open respectively) 8. This study not only revealed the location of the NUDT9H domain,
but also showed that the Ca2+ ion binds in the cavity formed by the voltage-sensor like domain

(VSLD) comprising transmembrane segments 1-4 (S1-S4). Unexpectedly, ADPR was found to
bind in the cleft of the melastatin homology domain 1/2 (MHR1/2) and not, as had long been
predicted, in the NUDT9H domain. Structural analyses of the closed and open conformations have
provided a mechanism for ligand-dependent activation of the channel, wherein binding of ADPR
in the MHR1/2 domain triggers substantial conformational rearrangements in the cytoplasmic
domain (CD), which are sequentially transduced and propagated to the distal transmembrane
channel domain (TMD) to induce pore opening.
In spite of this progress towards understanding ligand-dependent activation of the TRPM2
channel, it remains unclear whether these drastic quaternary structural rearrangements occur in a
concerted, four-fold symmetric manner. We recently reported that the transient receptor potential
vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel adopts two-fold symmetric conformations upon resiniferatoxin
(RTx)-mediated activation

21

, and that two-fold symmetric states are associated with ligand-

dependent gating of the TRPV3 channel 22. It is presently unclear if reduced symmetry is associated
with gating in other TRP channel families. To address these questions, we determined the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the full-length TRPM2 from Danio rerio (TRPM2DR)
in the presence of Ca2+ (referred to as TRPM2DR_Ca2+) and in the presence of both ADPR and Ca2+
(referred to as TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+). Our structural analyses identify unusual quaternary structural
rearrangements in the channel assembly which likely represent intermediate gating states.
Moreover, a comparison with the published TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures enabled us to
speculate on the conformational pathway involving reduced symmetric rearrangements between
the closed and open states of TRPM2.

Structure determination and overall architecture of TRPM2DR
TRPM2DR shares approximately 50% sequence identity with human TRPM2
(Supplementary Fig. 1), and when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T)
cells, wild-type TRPM2DR channels exhibit large currents in response to direct application of
ADPR and Ca2+ to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches (Supplementary Fig. 2). Notably, in the
presence of saturating [Ca2+] (125 µM), TRPM2DR shows an ADPR sensitivity similar to that of
human TRPM2 23.
For structural characterization, TRPM2DR was purified in detergent in the presence of Ca2+
(TRPM2DR_Ca2+) or subsequently reconstituted into amphipol in the presence of both Ca2+ and
ADPR (TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+) (see methods). The TRPM2DR_Ca2+ and TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+
structures were determined by cryo-EM to an overall resolution of ~3.8 Å and ~4.2 Å, respectively
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), enabling model building of ~85% of the TRPM2DR
polypeptide (see methods, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Table 1). In our study, we observed density
corresponding to two unique structural features of the TRPM2 channel: a second coiled-coil and
the NUDT9H domain at the C-terminus of the channel (Fig. 1). However, since these regions were
the least well-defined in the EM maps, we facilitated model building and analysis by docking the
homology model of the crystal structure of human ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT9 (PDB
1Q33) 19 into the NUDT9H density (see methods).
Our TRPM2DR channel forms a homo-tetramer (Fig. 1a,b). Viewed orthogonally to the
membrane plane, the channel can be divided into four layers. Like other published TRP channel
structures, the TMD layer adopts a domain-swapped configuration between the VSLD and the pore

TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structures (Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). While the TMD and two membraneproximal CD layers resemble the architecture observed in the TRPM8 and TRPM4 structures 2831

, the additional second coiled coil (CC2) and the NUDT9H domain together comprise a unique

bottom CD layer in the TRPM2 structures (Fig. 1c). Similar to the previously reported TRPM2,
TRPM4, and TRPM8 structures

8,26-31

, each TRPM2DR protomer contains an N-terminal region

composed of MHR1 to MHR4, a transmembrane channel region, and a C-terminal region. The
CC2 serves as a link between the C-terminal NUDT9H domain and the rest of the channel (Fig.
1d).

TRPM2DR structures in the intermediate states adopt two-fold symmetry
In contrast to the canonical four-fold symmetry reported in the TRPM2closed and TRPM2open
structures, our TRPM2DR_Ca2+ and TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structures adopt a two-fold symmetric
arrangement when viewed along the central axis of the channel. This C2 symmetry was readily
apparent upon reference-free 2D classification of the particle images (Supplementary Figs. 3e and
4e). To illustrate the key features associated with the observed two-fold symmetry, we focus first
on the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure, which exhibits different magnitudes of two-fold symmetry across
the layers of the channel. This reduced symmetry is most pronounced in the middle layer of the
CD, comprising the MHR1/2 and MHR3 domains (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably,
comparisons with the published TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures show that protomer A of
our TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure resembles the closed conformation while protomer B approximates
the open conformation (Fig. 2b,c). This observation suggests that our TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure may
represent an intermediate state in which neighboring subunits adopt closed and the open

conformations in an alternating manner, resulting in the two-fold symmetry between diagonally
opposing subunits.

Domain rearrangement at flexible junctions
To identify the origin of the two-fold symmetry, we performed global and local alignments
of protomers A and B in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure. The MHR3, MHR4, and VSLD are
conformationally similar between protomers, whereas significant differences in domain
arrangement are observed at three junctions: NUDT9H-MHR1/2, MHR1/2-MHR3, and VSLDpore (Fig. 3a,b). When the MHR3 and MHR4 domains of protomers A and B are aligned, the
MHR1/2 and NUDT9H domains exhibit a drastic rotation along individual axes (Fig. 3c).
Moreover, this movement within the CD is propagated to the TM helices, resulting in two-fold
symmetry within the TMD (Fig. 3d). The TMDs of the protomers A and B diverge at the S4b and
the S4-S5 linker regions. In protomer A, the S4b adopts a 310-helical structure, while the equivalent
region in protomer B contains an a-helical structure and an unstructured loop. In addition, the S4S5 linker in protomer A contains a p-helix, while the corresponding region in protomer B is ahelical and forms a continuous straight helix with S5. Due to the absence of a bend-inducing phelix at the junction between the S4-S5 linker and S5, the entire pore domain of protomer B is
positioned differently from that of protomer A with respect to the central axis of the channel.
Therefore, the flexible elements in the S4b and the S4-S5 linker lead to a two-fold symmetric
configuration of the TMD. Notably, a similar two-fold symmetric TMD arrangement induced by
a conformational change in the S4-S5 linker was recently observed in the TRPV2 channel 21. The
substantial conformational change at the S4b and S4-S5 linker between adjacent protomers leads
to unexpectedly distinct configurations of the S6 gate. Although the distance between diagonally

opposed gate residues in TRPM2DR_Ca2+ are larger than those observed in the TRPM2closed
structure, the S6 gate in TRPM2DR_Ca2+ is not as wide as that observed in the TRPM2open structure
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). Taken together, the structural differences between protomers A and B in
TRPM2DR_Ca2+ originate at the flexible junctions located between NUDT9H-MHR1/2, MHR1/2MHR3, and VSLD-pore. This flexibility allows the channel to assume a two-fold symmetric
intermediate state, where two subunits approximate the closed conformation and the other two
adopt an arrangement that is similar to the open state.
Importantly, the conformational differences between the closed and open states of
TRPM2DR are similar to those between two neighboring protomers in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Given that protomers A and B in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure resemble
the closed and open conformation, respectively (Fig. 2b,c), we hypothesized that the addition of
ADPR would induce further domain rearrangements at the junctions and enable transition of
protomers A/C to the B/D configuration, converging the channel into a four-fold symmetric open
conformation. To test this hypothesis, we prepared TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ by addition of ADPR to
TRPM2DR_Ca2+ and determined its structure (Fig. 4). While protomer B in both structures retains
the overall conformation similar to the open state (Fig. 4a), protomer A in TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+
undergoes significant domain rearrangements in the CD at the interfaces between NUDT9HMHR1/2 and MHR1/2-MHR3 (Fig. 4b). Notably, following the addition of ADPR, the CDs of
protomers A and B in the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure align well, which indicates that ligand
binding changes the conformation of the CD in protomer A from the closed to the open state (Fig.
4c). Consequently, the CDs of the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure converge to a nearly four-fold
symmetric arrangement (Figs. 2a and 5).

Alternating quaternary structure rearrangement in the bottom CD layer
Based on these structural comparisons, we suggest that the four subunits of TRPM2
channel adopt a two-fold symmetric intermediate quaternary structure assembly before ultimately
assuming the canonical four-fold symmetric arrangement in the open conformation. To visualize
the conformational changes associated with reduced symmetry, we compared our structures with
the published TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures at the bottom layer of the CD, which is
comprised of the mobile MHR1/2 and NUDT9H domains, and identified substantial
rearrangements mediated by critical interfacial interactions (Fig. 5).
It was shown that in the apo conformation, the NUDT9H domain in the TRPM2closed
structure merely makes primary intra-subunit interactions with the MHR1/2 domain (Fig. 5a,d),
while the binding of ADPR in the MHR1/2 domain relocates the NUDT9H domain to generate a
secondary interface with the MHR1/2 domain from the neighboring protomer (Fig. 5c,g).
Functional studies have shown that the interaction between the core subdomain of NUDT9H and
the rest of the channel is important for stabilizing an open state of the TRPM2 channel,
underscoring the importance of this secondary interface in channel opening

20

. Strikingly, our

TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure adopts a combination of the two distinct interactions associated with the
NUDT9H domain and the neighboring MHRs. Whereas the NUDT9H and MHR1/2 domains in
protomer A exhibit only intra-subunit interactions, the core subdomain of the NUDT9H in
protomer B makes additional contacts with the MHR1/2 domain in the neighboring protomer (Fig.
5b,e), resembling the interaction networks depicted in the TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures,
respectively. Furthermore, we observed changes in the interfacial interactions between the
MHR1/2 domains and CC1. In the apo and closed state, the MHR1/2 domain is in loose contact
with CC1 (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 10a). By contrast, in the open state, the binding of

ADPR induces a displacement of the MHR1/2 domain, causing it to become disengaged from the
CC1 helical bundle and positioned away from the central axis (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig.
10d). Our TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure adopts both types of interactions between the MHR1/2 domain
and CC1, further indicating a hybrid of the closed and the open conformations in the CD (Fig. 5e).
Therefore, based on the comparison with the TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures, the
alternating quaternary organization of the CDs in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure suggests that ADPRbinding might induce further rearrangements that ultimately converge the reduced symmetry to
adopt the four-fold symmetry apparent in the TRPM2open structure. In our TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+
structure, we observe density for ADPR in the cleft of the MHR1/2 domain in protomers B and D,
the shape and location of which resemble those depicted in the TRPM2open structure in complex
with Ca2+ and ADPR (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Although it is difficult to identify corresponding
ADPR density in protomers A and C due to the low resolution of the NUDT9H and MHR1/2
domains, we observed that the addition of ADPR converts protomers A/C from the closed to the
open conformation, wherein the MHR1/2 domains detach from CC1 and the NUDT9H domains
form interactions with neighboring MHR1/2 domains in all four protomers (Fig. 5f). As a result,
the CDs in the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure have been converted to a nearly four-fold symmetric
arrangement that is similar to the CD conformation shown in the TRPM2open structure.
While its CDs adopt a nearly four-fold symmetric conformation, the TMDs of our
TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure still adopt a hybrid of the closed and the open conformations
(Supplementary Fig. 8b-e), indicating that the TMDs have not converged towards the open
conformation. This suggests that the captured TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure may represent an
intermediate state in which the structural rearrangements occurring at the CD have not been fully
propagated to the TMD.

Subunit-subunit interfaces in the middle CD layer
The interfaces between the MHR1/2 and MHR3 domains in adjacent subunits comprise the
middle layer of the CD, which undergoes the largest conformational changes between the closed
and the open state upon ADPR binding. Notably, the reduced symmetry is most pronounced in the
middle layer of the CD in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure (Fig. 2a). Comparison between the published
TRPM2DR_closed and TRPM2DR_open structures showed that ADPR-induced conformational changes
between MHR1/2 and MHR3 in each protomer leads to drastic changes in the subunit-subunit
interface in the middle CD layer (Fig. 6a,c). While the closed state of TRPM2DR exhibits large
interfacial interactions between neighboring MHR1/2 and MHR3 domains, the corresponding
areas are significantly smaller in the open state (Fig. 6d,f). Notably, in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure,
the middle CD layer accommodates two distinct subunit-subunit interfaces (Fig. 6b,e), consistent
with the most pronounced two-fold symmetry observed in this region (Fig. 2a). While the interface
between MHR1/2 in protomer A and the neighboring MHR3 is similar to the interfacial network
in the closed state, the contact mediated by MHR1/2 in protomer B and the adjacent MHR3 domain
resembles that of the open state. Our observation of these alternating interfaces in the
TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure prompted us to question why such a two-fold symmetric intermediate
state might exist. We posit that concerted quaternary structural changes from the closed to the open
state would invoke substantial rearrangements at the subunit-subunit interfaces, which could be
energetically costly. However, by adopting an intermediate state with alternating subunit-subunit
interfaces, the transition from the closed to the open state through a two-fold symmetric
intermediate could reduce the energetic barrier for each structural rearrangement, thereby
facilitating the channel gating (Fig. 6).

Discussion
In this study, we observe a two-fold symmetric arrangement in the homo-tetrameric
channel TRPM2 in complex with only Ca2+ (TRPM2DR_Ca2+), and with both ADPR and Ca2+
(TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+), a feature previously observed in the TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels

21,22

.

Interestingly, comparing our structures with the recently published four-fold symmetric
TRPM2closed and TRPM2open structures reveals that protomers A and C of TRPM2DR_Ca2+ resemble
the closed conformation, while protomers B and D approximate the open conformation, indicating
that the homo-tetramer can accommodate a hybrid of structural arrangements that are
representative of the closed and the open states.
We consider the possible reason for the unique two-fold symmetric arrangement observed
in our TRPM2DR structures may lie in the biochemical preparation of our samples. While the
construct (full-length wild type TRPM2DR), expression system (HEK293 cells), and detergent
(digitonin) we used were very similar to those of the previously published structures 8, our
biochemical preparation also included Ca2+. Notably, our TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure is the only
structure of TRPM2 to date that was determined in the presence of Ca2+ only, thus enabling us to
dissect the role of Ca2+ in TRPM2 gating. It is possible that Ca2+ binding in the VSLD confers
flexibility to the junction at the S4-S5 linker, thus priming the channel for opening. Consistent
with this idea, the density for Ca2+ in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ reconstruction is stronger in protomer B
compared to that of protomer A (10.8 s versus 9.5 s, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). In
addition, we cannot exclude another possibility that endogenous ADPR was captured in the Ca2+bound TRPM2 during sample preparation, as we also observe weak densities in the cleft of the
MHR1/2 domain in protomers B and D of the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ reconstruction, which may

correspond to ADPR (Supplementary Fig. 6d). However, the quality of the density in these regions
was insufficient to unambiguously assign these detailed structural components.
Taken together, the alternating closed and open conformations of neighboring protomers
observed in both our TRPM2 structures, as well as the conversion of the CD to a four-fold
symmetric open conformation in the presence of additional ADPR, suggests that the TRPM2
channel adopts two-fold symmetric intermediate states en route to the open state (Fig. 7c). Reduced
symmetry transitions could potentially be a stepwise mechanism used to accommodate the
substantial conformational changes that occur during channel activation. Consistent with this idea,
our interface analysis suggests that the two-fold symmetric intermediates confer an advantage by
reducing the energetic barrier to the concerted quaternary structural changes going from the closed
to the open state (Figure 6). A similar departure from the canonical four-fold symmetry associated
with TRP channel gating was recently observed during ligand-induced gating in the TRPV2 and
TRPV3 channels 21,22, suggesting that adoption of a C2-symmetric conformation may be a more
widely used mechanism in the TRP channel superfamily.

Methods
Protein expression and purification
Zebrafish TRPM2 showed optimal biochemical stability based on a screen of eight
orthologues including human and rat TRPM2. A codon-optimized and full-length gene for
zebrafish (Danio rerio, XP_009303266.1) TRPM2 (TRPM2DR) was synthesized and cloned into a
modified pEG BacMam vector 32 in frame with a C-terminal FLAG affinity tag (Bio Basic Inc.).
The full length wild-type protein was expressed by baculovirus-mediated transduction of
HEK293S GnTI- (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative) suspension cells. In brief, the wildtype construct was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells and the recombinant bacmid
was isolated and transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The BacMam virus was
generated, amplified and added to HEK293S GnTI- cells (ATCC) at a cell density of 3-3.5 M ml1

. Cells were grown in Freestyle 293 media (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS

(Gibco) at 37°C in the presence of 8% CO2. After 18 h, 10 mM sodium butyrate was added to the
cell culture and the temperature was reduced to 30 °C to boost protein expression. 43-48 h after
induction, cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl,
1% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich), 6.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 12 µg mL-1 leupeptin, 12 µg mL-1
pepstatin, 12 µg mL-1 aprotinin, 1.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DNase I). Phytic acid
(InsP6, Sigma-Aldrich) and CaCl2 were added to a final concentration of 1 mM and 2 mM
respectively. The protein was solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h. The insoluble material was removed by
centrifugation at 8,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 resin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30-40 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed with ten column
volumes of filtered buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.06-0.1 % digitonin, 1 mM InsP6,

supplemented with 0.1 mg mL-1 FLAG peptide. The elution was concentrated and further purified
on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with filtered buffer B. The peak
fractions were concentrated to 0.5 mg mL-1 for cryo-EM analysis of the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure.
To solve the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure in complex with both ADPR and Ca2+, after
purifying the protein by size-exclusion chromatography as described above, peak fractions were
combined and mixed with Amphipol PMAL-C8 (Avanti polar lipid) at 1:10 (wt/wt) ratio and
incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. To remove detergent, 25 mg ml-1 Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) was added and incubated at 4°C for 1 h. After removing the Bio-Beads, the

reconstituted protein was mixed with 50 µM ADP-Ribose (Sigma-Aldrich) and further purified on
a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM Tris pH8,
150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 50 µM ADPR). The peak fractions were collected and concentrated
to ~1.25 mg mL-1 and incubated with ADPR to a final concentration of ~1 mM for 30-45 min
before sample freezing for cryo-EM study.
Cryo-EM sample preparation
For cryo-EM study of the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure, a thin amorphous carbon film was
floated onto UltrAuFoil® R1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids (Quantifoil). 3 µL of TRPM2 (0.5 mg/ml) was
applied to freshly plasma cleaned grids, and the grids were manually blotted

33

using a custom-

built manual plunger in a cold room (≥95% relative humidity, 4 °C). Sample was blotted for ~4
s with Whatman No.1 filter paper immediately prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane cooled by
liquid nitrogen.
The cryo-EM grids for the analysis of the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure were prepared by
applying 3 µL PMAL-C8 reconstituted TRPM2 (~1.25 mg mL-1) in the presence of ADPR and
Ca2+ to freshly glow-discharged UltrAuFoil® R1.2/1.3 300-mesh grids (Quantifoil). The grids
were blotted for 2 s at 25 °C under 95% humidity before being plunged into liquid ethane using a
Leica EM GP2 (Leica Microsystems). The grids were stored in liquid nitrogen before data
acquisition.
Cryo-EM data acquisition and data processing
TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure
The Cryo-EM data used for the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure were acquired using
the Leginon automated data acquisition program 34. All image pre-processing (frame alignment,
CTF estimation, particle picking) were performed in real-time using the Appion image processing
pipeline

35

during data collection. Images of frozen hydrated TRPM2 were collected on a Talos

Arctica (Thermo Fisher) TEM operating at 200 keV. Movies were collected using a K2 Summit
direct electron detector (Gatan) in counting mode at a nominal magnification of 36,000x
corresponding to a physical pixel size of 1.15 Å/pixel. A total of 3,039 movies (64 frames/movie)
of TRPM2 were collected by navigating to the center of four holes and image shifting ~2 µm to
each exposure target. Movies were collected using a 16 second exposure with an exposure rate of

5.2 e-/pixel/sec, resulting in a total exposure of ~63 e-/Å2 (1.17 e-/Å2/frame) and a nominal defocus
range from -1.2 µm to -2 µm. The MotionCor2 frame alignment program 36 was used to perform
motion correction and dose-weighting as part of the Appion pre-processing workflow. Frame
alignment was performed on 5 x 5 tiled frames with a B-factor of 100 applied. Unweighted
summed images were used for CTF determination using CTFFIND4 37. Difference of Gaussians

38

was used to automatically pick particles from the first 636 dose-weighted

micrographs yielding a stack of 176,961 particles that were binned 4 × 4 (4.6 Å/pixel, 80 pixel box
size) and subjected to reference-free 2D classification using RELION 2.1 39. The best nine classes
were then used for template-based automated particle picking against the whole dataset using
RELION. A total of 1,791,114 particles were extracted from these micrographs and binned 4 x 4
(4.6 Å/pixel, 80 pixel box size). Reference-free 2D classification in RELION was then used to sort
out non-particles and poor-quality picks in the data. A total of 435,692 particles corresponding to
2D class averages that displayed strong secondary-structural elements were input to 3D autorefinement in RELION without symmetry imposed. EMD-7127 was low-pass filtered to 30 Å and
used as an initial model. The refined particle coordinates were then used for re-centering and reextraction of particles binned 2 x 2 (2.3 Å/pixel, 160 pixel box size). The resulting stack was
subjected to 3D auto-refinement using the map obtained from the previous refinement as an initial
model, and with a soft mask (5 pixel extension, 5 pixel soft cosine edge) generated from a volume
contoured to display the full density. These particles were then subjected to 3D classification (k=6,
tau fudge=12) without angular or translational searches using the same soft mask. Particles
contributing to the classes that possessed the best resolved densities around the transmembrane
domain of the channel were 3D auto-refined and then re-centered and re-extracted without binning
(135,215 particles, 1.15 Å/pixel, 320 pixel box size). These particles were then 3D auto-refined
and subjected to 3D classification (k=3, tau fudge=12) without angular or translational searches.
Two classes, comprising 94,028 particles, displayed the best-resolved density around the
transmembrane region and C2 symmetry. 3D auto-refinement of these particles with C2 symmetry
imposed yielded a ~3.9 Å reconstruction as determined by gold-standard 0.143 Fourier shell
correlation (FSC) 40, using phase-randomization to account for the convolution effects of a solvent
mask on the FSC between the two independently refined half maps 41. To improve map quality,

particle stack (93,573 particles) with C2 symmetry imposed yielded a ~3.8 Å reconstruction as
determined by gold-standard 0.143 FSC.

TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure
For the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure, the cryo-EM data were acquired using the EPU
automated data-acquisition program. Images were collected on a Titan Krios (FEI) operating at
300 keV equipped with a Falcon III direct electron detector operating in counting mode. 2496
movies were collected at a nominal magnification of 59,000x with a physical pixel size of 1.39
Å/pixel using a nominal defocus range of -0.5 to -2.25 µm. Each movie (45 frames) was acquired
using a dose rate of ~0.91 e-/pixel/s and a total exposure of ~40 e-/Å2.
Motion correction and dose-weighting was performed using the MotionCor2 frame
alignment program on 5 x 5 tiled frames with a B-factor of 150 applied 36. Gctf

was used for

CTF estimation of unweighted summed images and 2426 good micrographs were selected. 1719
particles were manually picked and subject to reference-free 2D classification (k=10, tau=2) in
RELION 3.0

43

. The best seven classes were used as templates for auto-picking of a total of

1,949,622 particles. The dataset was extracted unbinned and subjected to reference-free 2D
classification, construction of ab-initio model, heterogeneous refinement, and homogeneous
refinement in CryoSPARC 44, yielding a 3D reconstruction of ~4.3 Å resolution. In parallel, the
1,949,622 particles were extracted, Fourier binned 4 x 4 (5.56 Å/pixel, 64 pixel box size) and
subjected to reference-free 2D classification. Good 2D classes showing secondary structural
features were selected. After further removing micrographs with a figure of merit (FOM) below
0.1 and with astigmatism above 500 nm, a total of 736,565 particles from 2366 good micrographs
were combined and input to 3D auto-refinement in RELION with C1 symmetry. The model of
~4.3 Å resolution generated by CryoSPARC was low-pass filtered to 30 Å and used as an initial
model without a reference mask. The refined particles were re-centered, re-extracted, Fourier
binned 2 x 2 (2.78 Å/pixel, 128 pixel box size), and subject to 3D auto-refinement with C1
symmetry, using the model from the previous auto-refinement as the reference mask and with a
soft mask (5 pixel extension, 5 pixel soft cosine edge). The refined particles were input to 3D
classification (k=4, tau=12) without alignment using the same mask. 135,120 particles comprising
the best 3D class which shows the most well-defined cytoplasmic domain (CD) were re-centered,

Bayesian polishing 45 were attempted, but the resolution was not improved.
Model building and refinement
An initial model of TRPM2 was generated by the RaptorX structure prediction server

46

with the sequence of zebrafish TRPM2 (XP_009303266.1). For the model building of the
TRPM2Ca2+ structure, individual domains (NUDT9H, VSLD, pre-S1, pore, CC1, CC2, MHR1/2,
MHR3, and MHR4) were manually docked into the electron density map and the subsequent model
building was performed manually in Coot

47

. A series of rigid-body fitting was performed for

secondary structures within the structural domains, including the MHR domains, the pre-S1
domain, VSLD, the pore domain, and the NUDT9H domain. Residues with bulky side chains
guided the correct register of helices and β-strands. Side chains were adjusted to optimal rotamer
conformations and some loops that connect secondary structures were rebuilt to fit in the electron
density. Unstructured loops and side chains whose electron density was not resolved in the map
were deleted from the model. To facilitate the model building of the NUDT9H domain, the crystal
structure of human ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT9 (PDB ID: 1Q33) was docked into the
electron density. The coordinates of the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure was docked into cryo-EM map
for the TRPM2ADPR/Ca2+ structure, and the subsequent model building was performed in a similar
manner in Coot. Ideal geometry restraints were imposed on the secondary structure and the rotamer
conformation as much as possible during the initial manual model building in Coot. In the TRPM2
DR_Ca2+ structure,

a calcium ion was placed into the EM density at the putative binding site in each

protomer; while in the TRPM2 DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure, a calcium ion and an ADPR molecule were
built into the putative EM density in protomers B and D. The ligand restraints were generated by
eLBOW

48

. The two structure models were subsequently real-space refined in the PHENIX

graphical interface against the cryo-EM map along with ligand restraints, using global
minimization and rigid body refinement with secondary structure restraints 49. Problematic regions
in

the

real-space

refined

structure

were

identified

using

the

Molprobity

server

(http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/) 50 and were manually fixed in Coot. FSCs of the half maps
against the refined model agree with each other, indicating that the model is not over-refined

Electrophysiology
HEK293T cells (62312975 – ATCC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
(Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and were sustained in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37ºC.
Cells between passage 10 – 30 grown in 40-mm wells were transiently transfected at 30 – 50%
confluency with plasmids encoding for TRPM2DR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) using
FuGene6 (Promega). Transfected cells were subcultured onto laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated 12mm round glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) 24 hours post transfected and used 12 – 24 hours
after for electrophysiological measurements.
Voltage-clamp recordings were performed in the inside-out patch clamp configuration with
glass electrodes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments) with a final
resistance of 1.5 – 2.5 MΩ. The extracellular pipette solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl,
2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, and adjusted to pH 7.4 (NaOH). Glass coverslips were placed in
an open bath chamber (RC-26G, Warner Instruments) filled with the external pipette solution and
after obtaining a GΩ seal, the patch was excised into the bath. An intracellular bath solution

Supplementary Figure 8. Comparison of the transmembrane channel domain (TMD) in
TRPM2DR structures.
a, Cartoon and surface representations of the S6 gate viewed from the intracellular side. In the
TRPM2closed (grey) and TRPM2open (violet) structures, residues N1064 and Q1068 form the
narrowest restriction points, while residues F1063 and F1067 on S6 form the intracellular gate in
the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ (yellow) and TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ (red) structures.
b, the TMD of protomer A in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure (yellow) resembles that of the
TRPM2closed structure (silver).
c, the TMD of protomer B in the TRPM2DR_Ca2+ structure (teal) resembles that of the TRPM2open
structure (violet).
d, the TMD of protomer A in the TRPM2DR_ADPR/Ca2+ structure (red) resembles that of the
TRPM2closed structure (silver).
