ABSTRACT
Deaminase base editing has emerged as a tool to install or correct point mutations in the
genomes of living cells in a wide range of organisms and its ultimate success
therapeutically depends on its accuracy. Here we have investigated the fidelity of cytosine
base editor 4 (BE4) and adenine base editor (ABE) in mouse embryos using unbiased
whole genome sequencing of a family-based trio cohort. We demonstrate that BE4-edited
mice carry an excess of single-nucleotide variants and deletions compared to ABE-edited
mice and controls.

INTRODUCTION
Deaminase base editing (1,2) directly converts target C•G base pairs to T•A by cytosine
base editors (CBE), or target A•T base pairs to G•C by adenine base editors (ABE),
without inducing double-stranded DNA breaks (3). Since the majority of known human
pathogenic variants are single nucleotide alterations (2,4), base editing has been
heralded as a high-fidelity tool to correct single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with many human disorders. While exceptional precision is paramount in a
quest to correct somatic and in particular germline mutations, recent studies have
revealed that CBEs can induce bystander mutations, including deletions, in mouse
zygotes (5) and plants (6). In contrast, ABE displays a greater fidelity (5,7).
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of base-edited rice (8) and mouse embryos (9)
revealed that BE3, a commonly used CBE, induces a large number of inadvertent base
changes throughout the genome, while ABE displayed high fidelity. In a separate study,
WGS of BE3-edited sheep did not reveal an obvious increase of off-target mutations (10).
Since BE3 can introduce unwanted indels (1,5) and other undesirable base substitutions
in addition to C-to-T conversions (5,7,11), the fourth-generation BE4, containing a second
uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) domain and optimized linker architectures, appears to
have an increased fidelity in vitro (12), in mouse zygotes (5) and in rabbit embryos (13).
Off-target effect for BE4 might be expected based on WGS studies that examined offtarget mutations introduced by BE3 and ABE (8,9). However, as different sgRNA, editors,
and analysis methods might yield different results (8,9), there is a definitive need for
investigating in vivo genomic effects of BE4 in comparison with ABE. Along those lines,

the original study on WGS of CRISPR/Cas9 edited mice suggested the presence of
extensive off-target mutations (14), which was, however, likely the result of an imperfect
experimental design as pointed out in editorials (15-19). Further WGS investigations by
Iyer and colleagues as well as our group (20,21) using trio studies demonstrated that
CRISPR/Cas9 does not introduce an excess of off-target mutations. Therefore, it is
prudent to examine critical issues of base editing, such as the extent of off-target
mutations with a larger number of mice and under several conditions. In this study, we
have addressed the question of base editing fidelity and conducted unbiased WGS on a
total of 44 BE4- and ABE-edited mice, control mice and their wild-type parents.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION
To assess on- and off-target fidelities of the advanced BE4 and ABE in mouse embryos,
we conducted a family-based trio WGS study (Figure 1A). Fertilized eggs were injected
with BE4 or ABE7.10 mRNA together with a sgRNA used by both editors, which permitted
a direct comparison. Two-cell stage embryos were implanted into surrogate mothers and
13 ABE-edited and nine CBE-edited founder mice were born, together with 13 noninjected controls (Figure 1B). All founders (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1) were
screened by Sanger sequencing to identify mutants and targeted deep-sequencing was
performed to determine haplotypes. ABE introduced A-to-G transitions in the target
window and, except one, no bystander or proximal off-target mutations were detected in
the 33 edited alleles. In contrast, BE4 induced not only the expected C-to-T transitions
but also C-to-G and C-to-A conversions in the target site, frequent proximal off-target
mutations, and deletions in four of the nine founders (12 out of the 17 edited alleles)
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1).
Unbiased WGS was performed on the 22 edited mice, 13 controls and nine parents
at an average depth of 60x (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1). The WGS data were
analyzed using GATK with Joint Genotyping and subsequent filtering to identify single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels for each individual mouse (Figure 2A). Lumpy with
SvTyper was used to identify indels. To explicitly identify de novo mutations, the SNVs
and indels present in the parents were subtracted from those identified in the progeny
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Non-edited control mice had accumulated an average

4
of 132 de novo SNVs (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 2). On average 119 SNVs
were detected in ABE-edited mice, comparable to that in controls. In contrast, BE4-edited
mice carried on average 221 SNVs, a significant increase (Kruskal-Wallis chi-square:
p=0.002), especially C-to-T variants (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 2 and
Supplementary Table 2).
About 2% of off-target SNVs coincided with the predicted off-target site, CRISPR,
suggesting that the majority of mutations were not dependent of the sgRNA and
predictable by predicted off-target sites (Supplementary Table 4). The increased off-target
editing observed in BE4 but not ABE implies that these mutations were the result of
cytosine deaminase AID/APOBEC1 which can induce SNVs in the absence of sgRNAs
(1). C-to-T conversions (plus some C-to-A and C-to-G) are overrepresented in de novo
SNVs observed in BE4-edited mice, consistent with enzymatic activity of BE4. Since four
out of the nine BE4-edited mice carried additional deletions proximal to the target region,
we analyzed globally their indel frequencies compared with controls (Figure 2C and
Supplementary Table 3). The numbers of indels in the BE4- and ABE-edited group
showed no differences from the control group (Figure 2C), also not regarding their
characteristics (Supplementary Table 5).
Our results confirm and extend previous work that BE3 but not ABE increases offtarget SNVs in mouse embryos (9) and rice (8) by analyzing a large data set of nine BE4edited and 13 ABE-edited mice (a total of 50 mutant alleles). We observed a significant
mutation rate with the improved BE4 in mouse embryos. While base-edited mouse
embryos (9) acquire off-targets independent on sgRNAs, in base-edited rice off-target
mutations

can coincide with predicted off target sites (8) suggesting sgRNA

dependence. Thus, using the same sgRNA for both BE4 and ABE eliminates latent
promiscuous guide targeting as the explanation for off-target mutations in BE4, a unique
aspect of our study. We demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase of de novo offtarget mutations in BE4-edited embryos, which favorably compares to the more than 20fold increase observed in BE3-edited mouse embryos (9). However, given the variation
between individual mice, our study and that in rice (8) show a statistically significant
difference in off-target SNVs. BE4, an advanced version of BE3, contains an additional
UGI (uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor) and a shortened linker, as a means to enhance its

5
specificity (12). Further studies will be needed to validate the higher genome-wide fidelity
of BE4. However, BE4 caused inadvertent proximal off-target mutations and deletions in
four of the nine founders, which has implications in its use as therapeutic agent. These
adverse mutations are likely independent of the sgRNA used as none of the 13 embryos
edited with ABE and the same sgRNA displayed any proximal off-target mutations and
deletions. It is not clear whether BE3-induced proximal off-target mutations were detected
in the two WGS studies (8,9).
In summary, our study emphasizes the high fidelity of ABE as compared to BE4,
which also induces increased unwanted base substitutions and deletions in close
proximity to the designed target site. Such unwanted mutations are of particular concern
when correcting disease-associated SNPs in proteins, as they could adversely alter nontargeted amino acids. Our study also emphasizes the need to monitor off-target mutations
in clonal populations, as the analysis of large pools of cells with variable editing, as
commonly conducted in in vitro experiments (22-24), results in population averaging.
Based on our study and previous experiments (5,8,9), ABE appears to be the current
choice for base editing because of its fidelity at target sites and throughout the genome.
However, caution about the fidelity of deaminase base editors comes from recent studies
that demonstrated extensive off-target RNA editing (25,26).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Use Committee (ACUC) of the NIH (https://oacu.oir.nih.gov) and all animal experiments
were approved by the ACUC of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK, MD) and performed under the NIDDK animal protocol K089-LGP-17.
Base edited founder mice were generated using C57BL/6N mice (Charles River
Laboratories, MD) by the Transgenic Core of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI, MD).

The Wap-E1 sgRNA (GGCACAGTATGGGCCCTTCT) (27), which contains two cytidines
and two adenines near the editing window, was designed and synthesized using
ThermoFiser’s sgRNA in vitro transcription service. The pCMV-BE4 plasmid (gift from
David Liu’s laboratory) and pCMV-ABE7.10 plasmid (Addgene plasmid #102919) were
linearized and then their mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the mMESSAGE
mMACHINE T7 kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Mouse zygotes were produced by in vitro
fertilization (IVF) using eggs collected from eight superovulated C57BL/6N female mice
and sperm collected from one C57BL/6N male (Charles River Laboratories). The ABE
and BE4 mRNAs (50ng/ul) were separately microinjected with the sgRNA (20ng/ul) into
the cytoplasm of the IVF zygotes. After culturing overnight in M16 medium, those embryos
reached 2-cell stage of development were implanted into oviducts of pseudopregnant
foster mothers (Swiss Webster, NY). Mice born to the foster mothers were genotyped
and subsequently analyzed by whole genome sequencing.

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from the tip of tails of 3-week-old mice using Wizard Genomic
DNA purification Kit (Promega), amplified by PCR, and followed by Sanger sequencing
(Quintarabio, CA). Mutations were identified by PCR amplifying a 599 bp fragment
encompassing the target sequence, followed by Sanger sequencing. Library preparation
and whole genome sequencing was conducted by the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA)
using Illumina HiSeq X, at a coverage of 60x using 150bp paired-end reads
(Supplementary Table 1).

GATK analysis
WGS (60x) was performed on 44 mice, nine parents (one male and eight females), and
their progeny, including 22 founder mice carrying base substitutions at target sites
induced by ABE or BE4 using one guide RNA and 13 non-injected control ones. The

analysis was performed accordingly to the GATK best practices guidelines (28-30) for
germline mutations (version 3.8-0). Quality control and alignment was done by BBmap
(31) (version 37.36) and BWA MEM (32) (version 0.7.15), respectively, using the
reference genome mm10.
For runtime opitmazation, the aligned BAM files were split up to a chromosome level (for
runtime optimization) and reads aligned to different chromosomes were filtered using
SAMtools (33) (version 1.5), followed by Picard tools (34) (version 2.9.2) to mark
duplicates. The GATK analysis workflow was applied as follows: (i) base recalibration GATK BaseRecalibrator, AnalyzeCovariates, and PrintReads - using the databases of
known polymorphic sites, dbSNP142 and MGPv5 (provided by the high-performance
computing team of the NIH (Biowulf)); (ii) variant calling - GATK HaplotypeCaller - with
the genotyping mode “discovery”, the “ERC” parameter for creating gvcf and a minimum
phred-scaled confidence threshold of 30. The final step included merging the VCF files of
each chromosome (GenomeAnalysisTK, GATK).

GATK SNV analysis
Joint genotyping was applied on on all 44 samples together and hard filters were applied:
“QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0 || MQRankSum < -12.5 || ReadPosRankSum < -8.0
|| SOR > 3 ". The resulting SNVs were additionally filtered by removing those overlapping
with repetitive elements (35) (UCSC’s masked repeats plus simple repeats;

mouse/). On an individual level, only SNVs with a genotype of 0/1 or 1/1 were kept.
Further filtering steps comprised the removal of SNVs with a read depth smaller than 10,
an excessive read depth (37) (d+3√d, d = average read depth), an allele frequency less
than 10% using a variety of tools (38-40). All SNVs within +/- 5bp of an indel border were
removed as likely false-positives.

Simple GATK indel analysis
Indels identified by GATK where extracted after joint genotyping and subsequently hard
filters were applied according to the GATK recommendations: "QD < 2.0 || FS > 200.0 ||

genotypes of 0/1 and 1/1, removing those with a read depth smaller than 10 as well as
sites with an excessive number of reads (37) (d+3√d, d = average read depth). Last, all
simple indels that overlap with complex indels identified using LUMPY were excluded.
For all those steps a variety of tools (38-40) was applied.

Complex indel analysis using Lumpy
The analysis of complex indels was done on the same samples using Lumpy (41)
according to the guidelines. Mapping was done using BWA MEM (32), with the
parameters “--excludeDups --addMateTags --maxSplitCount 2 --minNonOverlap 20”
(reference genome mm10), followed by Lumpy (41) using the discordant and split reads
as input and genotypes were identified using SVTyper (42). The subsequent filtering
steps comprised the selection of indels with a genotype of 0/1 and 1/1 and the removal
of indels with a quality smaller than 100 and an excessive read coverage (d+3√d (37),
where d is the average read depth) or a SU value (Number of pieces of evidence
supporting the variant across all samples) smaller than 5. Indels overlapping with
repetitive elements (35) or black regions (36) were excluded.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with R package 3.3.3 (http://www.R-project.org/).
Kruskal-Wallis test was applied using kruskal.test and pairwise comparison was done
with a Wilcoxon Rank Sum wilcox.test in R. All values represent means ± S.D.

Targeted deep-seq
Target sites were amplified from mouse genomic DNA using Phusion polymerase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and PCR products were prepared as libraries for next-

Figure legends
Figure 1. Base-editing by BE4 and ABE in mouse embryos. (A) Experimental design
of the family-based trio study. (B) Summary of data obtained from mouse zygotes coinjected with ABE or BE4 mRNA and a sgRNA. (C) Alignment of sequences from founder
mice. 33 mutant alleles edited by ABE, and 17 alleles edited by BE4 were analyzed. The
sgRNA sequence is underlined and the PAM sites shown in green. The target nucleotides
and edited nucleotide are shown in bold black and blue, respectively. Unintended
nucleotide substitutions are shown in red. Deletions are marked with a deletion symbol.

Figure 2. De novo mutation frequencies in base-edited and control mice compared
to their parents. (A) Workflow of whole genome sequencing analysis for SNVs and
indels. (b and c) Numbers of de novo SNVs (B) and indels (C) identified in mutants and
controls. Boxplot: center line, mean; box limits, plus and minus standard deviation;
whiskers, minimum and maximum. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Mann-Whitney-U-Test for
the pairwise comparison were used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences
between groups.
