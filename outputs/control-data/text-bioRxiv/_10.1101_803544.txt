Abstract
Primary cilia are sensory organelles that are essential for eukaryotic development and
health.

These antenna-like structures are synthesized by intraflagellar transport protein

complexes, IFT-B and IFT-A, which mediate bi-directional protein trafficking along the ciliary
axoneme. Here using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), we investigate the ciliary roles of
two mammalian orthologues of Chlamydomonas IFT-A gene, IFT139, namely Thm1 (also
known as Ttc21b) and Thm2 (Ttc21a). Thm1 loss causes perinatal lethality, and Thm2 loss
allows survival into adulthood. At E14.5, the number of Thm1;Thm2 double mutant embryos is
lower than that for a Mendelian ratio, indicating deletion of Thm1 and Thm2 causes midgestational lethality. We examined the ciliary phenotypes of mutant MEF. Thm1-mutant MEF
show decreased cilia assembly, shortened primary cilia, a retrograde IFT defect for IFT and BBS
proteins, and reduced ciliary entry of membrane-associated proteins. Thm1-mutant cilia also
show a retrograde transport defect for the Hedgehog transducer, Smoothened, and an impaired
response to Smoothened agonist, SAG. Thm2-null MEF show normal ciliary dynamics and
Hedgehog signaling, but additional loss of a Thm1 allele impairs response to SAG. Further,
Thm1;Thm2 double mutant MEF show enhanced cilia disassembly, and relative to Thm1-null
MEF, increased impairment of IFT81 retrograde transport and of INPP5E ciliary import. Thus,
Thm1 and Thm2 have unique and redundant roles in MEF. Thm1 regulates cilia assembly, and
together with Thm2, cilia disassembly. Moreover, Thm1 alone and together with Thm2, regulates
ciliary protein trafficking, Hedgehog signaling, and embryogenesis. These findings shed light on
mechanisms underlying Thm1-, Thm2- or IFT-A-mediated ciliopathies.

Introduction
Cilia are evolutionarily-conserved organelles present in most eukaryotic organisms from
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to vertebrates (1). These microtubular organelles can confer motility
or act as sensory organelles. In the latter role, a singular cilium, termed a primary cilium,
extends from the apical surface of a cell, where it detects and transduces extracellular signals.
Primary cilia regulate cell cycle, cell differentiation and cell-cell communication (2).
Mutations that disrupt cilia function cause multi-system disorders, termed ciliopathies (3).
Clinical manifestations can include craniofacial and neural tube defects, retinal degeneration,
skeletal dysplasia, fibrocystic diseases of the kidney, liver, and pancreas, obesity, and male
infertility (4). Understanding the role of ciliary proteins in mediating ciliary processes can
provide insight into cellular mechanisms underlying these various defects.
The primary cilium consists of a microtubule-based ciliary axoneme, ensheathed in a
ciliary membrane. Extension and maintenance of the axoneme is dependent on multiple protein
complexes (5). The IFT-B complex, comprised of approximately 15 proteins, and the kinesin
motor mediate anterograde transport, moving protein cargo from the base to the tip of the
primary cilium. The IFT-A complex, comprised of approximately 7 proteins, together with the
dynein motor mediate retrograde transport, returning cargo from the tip to the base of the
primary cilium. IFT-A proteins also mediate ciliary entry of signaling and membrane-associated
proteins (6-8). Another protein complex, the BBSome, traffics signaling molecules to the cilium
and throughout the cilium where it acts as an adaptor between the IFT complexes and the protein
cargoes(9). Despite that these ciliary proteins assemble into complexes, mutations in ciliary
genes that encode proteins of the same ciliary complex can result in different phenotypes (10).
Thus, individual ciliary proteins likely have cell-specific roles.
Previously, we identified the mammalian IFT-A gene, Thm1 (TPR-containing Hedgehog
Modulator 1; also known as Ttc21b), an orthologue of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
FLA17/IFT139 (11, 12). In mouse, early embryonic loss of Thm1 misregulates Hedgehog (Hh)
signaling and causes perinatal lethality, polydactyly, and defects of the skeleton, forebrain,
palate, and neural tube (11, 13). Additionally, in mice, Thm1 deletion in the perinatal period
causes renal cystic disease (14), and its deletion in adulthood causes obesity (15).

These

phenotypes recapitulate the clinical features present in individuals with ciliopathies who have
THM1 mutations.

Causative mutations in THM1 have been identified in patients with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/803544; this version posted October 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

nephronophthisis, a renal fibrocystic disease, while modifying mutations in THM1 have been
found in patients with Bardet Biedl Syndrome, which manifests obesity as a cardinal clinical
feature (16).
Loss or deficiency of Thm1 impairs retrograde IFT, resulting in accumulation of IFT
proteins and signaling molecules at the ciliary distal tip (11, 17).

In some cells, such as

mesenchymal cells of the developing limb bud, Thm1 depletion causes shortened cilia (11),
while in cultured RPE cells, cilia length was not affected (17). In Chlamydomonas Ift139-null
mutants, levels of other IFT-A proteins were reduced, indicating that in the green alga, IFT139 is
required for assembly of the IFT-A complex (18).
While there is only one IFT139 gene in Chlamydomonas, evolution has generated two
vertebrate orthologues, which we have called Thm1 and Thm2. THM1 and THM2 are both 50%
identical to Chlamydomonas IFT139 (11, 12).

Additionally, the murine Thm1 and Thm2

sequences are 50% homologous and encode proteins that have very similar predicted protein
structures with multiple (10-11) tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. At embryonic day (E)
10.5, Thm1 and Thm2 also show very similar RNA expression patterns in whole mouse embryos.
Recently, THM2 mutations were reported in adult males with subfertility (19). Still the role of
Thm2 in ciliogenesis and development remains uncharacterized. By generating a Thm2-null
mouse and using Thm1- and Thm2-null derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), here we
show a role for Thm1 in cilia assembly, and an interaction between Thm1 and Thm2 that is
important for cilia disassembly, ciliary protein trafficking, Hh signaling and embryogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Thm2 knockout (Thm2-/-) mouse
Thm2-null mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Two guide RNAs
(gRNAs) – one targeting exon 4 (target sequence CATACTCCCTGGCCTTGTCGTGG) and the
other in intron 8 (target sequence AACCTGACCGACAGCCCACCTGG) - were designed to
delete exons 4-8 and ultimately cause a premature stop codon. gRNAs were generated and
validated by the Washington University Genome Engineering and iPSC Center). Pro-nuclear
injections of 20ng/μl of each in vitro transcribed gRNA and 50ng/μl of Cas9 mRNA of 317 F1
embryos derived from FVB oocyte donors and C57BL6/J males yielded 42 founders. Genomic
DNA of founders was amplified and sequenced to determine presence of exon 4-8 deletion and a

resulting premature stop codon. Founders carrying a large deletion and stop codon were then
crossed to FVB mice to expand the Thm2-/- lines.

Genotyping of NHEJ events following CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing
Three PCR primer sets were designed to characterize the deletions generated by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) following CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Two sets of primers
were designed around the exon 4 gRNA, and one set of primers was designed to flank the entire
region between exon 4 and intron 8. The first primer set surrounding exon 4 included FThm2ex4p (5’-TAC TAC GCC AGC CTC TTC CT- 3’) and R-Thm2ex4p (5’-CCC TCC TGT
ACC TCT TTG GA-3’) and was expected to produce a WT band of 107bp. The second primer
set surrounding exon 4 included F-Thm2ex4r (5’- TGT CTG AAG CCA ACA GAG AGG-3’)
and R–Thm2ex4r (5’-GTT CAA GGC CAC CTT TGC T-3’) and was expected to produce a WT
band of 1,000bp. PCR amplicons with a lower molecular weight indicate evidence of NHEJ in
exon 4. Primers designed to detect the large exon 4-8 deletion flank exon 4 and intron 8 include
F-Thm2ex4b (5’-GGA GAG CAG CTT GAA GGA AA-3’) and R-Thm2ex4b (5’-GTC ACG
GCT GGT GTG ATT C-3’). A PCR amplicon was expected of approximately 216bp, only in the
event of NHEJ. To detect the presence of a WT allele, a separate PCR reaction was performed
using primers within exon 6, F-WT (5-AAC TTC CTG CCC GCT TTA GT- 3’) and R-WT (5’GTG TCA GAT ACC CTG GAA CCA GAG-3’). In the presence of a WT allele, this PCR
reaction yields an amplicon of approximately 461bp.

Sequencing of Thm2 knockout alleles
PCR products were run on an agarose gel, excised, and extracted using the Qiaex II DNA
extraction kit (Qiagen, 20021). Samples were sequenced by Genewiz. Sequencing results were
analyzed to determine the presence or absence of stop codons resulting from NHEJ events. A
line harboring a deletion from exon 4 to intron 8, producing a stop codon in exon 4 was chosen,
with the allele designation of Ttc21a∆4-8. The founder of this line was mated to FVB mice to
expand the line. This line was maintained on the C57BL6/J/FVB mixed genetic background.

Analysis of mouse embryos and generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts

Timed matings were performed between Ttc21a∆4-8/+; Thm1aln/+ mice. The aln allele of
Thm1 results in absence of protein, and thus acts like a null allele (11). Visualization of a
vaginal plug was designated as embryonic day (E) 0.5. Mouse embryos were dissected at E10.5,
E12.5 and E14.5 using a Leica dissection microscope. Tails of mouse embryos were collected
for genomic DNA extraction and genotyping. To generate MEF, embryos were eviscerated. In a
fresh 10cm cell culture plate, an individual carcass was minced with a razor in 0.25% trypsinEDTA, then media (DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin streptomycin antibiotics) was
added. Cells were grown to confluency, then trypsinized and plated for an experiment. Cells
were passaged maximally up to two times.

Cilia assembly and disassembly assays
Cells were plated on 12mm poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips in a 24-well plate with
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and pen/strep antibiotics. Two days after cells reached
100% confluency, medium was replaced with serum-free medium for 24 hours to induce
ciliogenesis. Cells were fixed, immunostained for ciliary markers, imaged and quantified for
presence of cilia.
To measure cilia disassembly, cells were plated on 12mm poly-lysine coated glass
coverslips in a 24-well plate with complete medium containing 10% FBS. Two days after cells
reached 100% confluence, media was replaced with serum-free media for 24 hours to bring cells
to G0 and induce ciliogenesis. Following 24-hour serum starvation, cells were cultured in media
containing 10% FBS for 2 hours to induce cilia disassembly (20). Cells were fixed,
immunostained for ciliary markers, imaged and quantified for presence of cilia.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were washed with PBS, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/0.2% triton X-100 in
PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed again with PBS, and blocked with
1% BSA in PBS for 1 hour. Cells were then incubated with antibodies against SMO (Abcam),
IFT52, IFT81, IFT88, IFT140, BBS2, BBS5 (Proteintech), ARL13B and INNP5E (Proteintech)
and acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma) overnight at 40 C. Following 3 washes in PBS, cells were
incubated with anti-rabbit AF488 and anti-mouse AF594 (InVitrogen Technologies) for 30
minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed 3X in PBS, and mounted with Vectashield

containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Immuno-labeled cells
were viewed and imaged using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope configured on a DM550
Q upright microscope.

qPCR
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), then reverse transcribed into cDNA
using Quanta Biosciences qScript cDNA mix (VWR International).

qPCR for Gli1 was

performed using Quanta Biosciences Perfecta qPCR Supermix (VWR International) in a BioRad
CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System. Primers used were mGli1 (Forward: 5’CTGACTGTGCCCGAGAGTG-3’; Reverse: 5’-CGCTGCTGCAAGAGGACT-3’). qPCR was
performed using RNA lysates from three lines for each genotype.

Results
Thm2 interacts with Thm1 in embryogenesis
Timed matings of Thm2∆4-8/+;Thm1aln/+ intercrosses were performed. At E10.5, E12.5
and E14.5, pregnant females were dissected and their embryos analyzed. Thm2-null (Thm2∆48/∆4-8

) and Thm2-null;Thm1+/- (Thm2∆4-8/∆4-8;Thm1aln/+) embryos were normal, while Thm1-null

(Thm1aln/aln) and Thm1; Thm2 double knock-out (Thm2∆4-8/∆4-8;Thm1aln/aln) embryos showed
polydactyly and occasional exencephaly. At E10.5 and E12.5, the number of Thm1-null mutants
and Thm1; Thm2 double knock-outs (dko) was consistent with a Mendelian inheritance pattern,
but at E14.5, the frequency of Thm1; Thm2 dko embryos was reduced (Table 1). Thm1 deletion
causes perinatal lethality (11). Thus, the reduced number of Thm1; Thm2 double mutants at
E14.5 suggests that additional loss of Thm2 exacerbates the Thm1-null developmental phenotype
causing mid-gestational lethality.

Thm1 regulates ciliogenesis
We derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from E12.5 Thm2-null, Thm2null;Thm1+/- (triple allele mutant), Thm1-null (ko), and Thm1; Thm2 double-knockout (dko) mice.
Following 24 hours of serum starvation, Thm1 ko cells exhibited shorter ciliary length (mean
length of 3.5µm) than control cells (Thm2+/-; mean length of 5.2µm), while the loss of Thm2 did

not alter cilia length (Thm2-null and Thm2-null;Thm1+/- mutants; mean lengths of 5.3µm and
5.2µm, respectively; Figures 1A and 1B).
We next assessed capacity of mutant cells to undergo ciliogenesis. Loss of Thm2 alone
does not affect embryogenesis nor result in a phenotype at weanling age, but loss of Thm2
together with one allele of Thm1 (Thm2-null;Thm1+/-) causes a postnatal skeletal phenotype
(data will be communicated in a separate manuscript). Therefore, all subsequent experiments
were carried out using MEF of Thm2-null;Thm1+/- (triple allele) mutants rather than of Thm2null cells. At 6 and 24 hours of serum starvation, percentage of ciliated cells and cilia length was
measured in control (Thm2∆4-8/+), triple allele mutant (Thm2∆4-8/∆4-8;Thm1aln/+), Thm1 ko
(Thm1aln/aln) and Thm1; Thm2 dko (Thm1aln/aln; Thm2∆4-8/∆4-8) MEF at 100% confluency.

At 6

hours of serum starvation, approximately 75% of control MEF were ciliated. At 24 hours of
serum starvation, percentage of ciliated control cells was not altered, but cilia length was
increased (Figures 1C-1E). We posit that under our experimental conditions, early events in
cilium formation, such as maturation and docking of the basal body, were completed at 6 hours
of serum starvation, and that axoneme elongation occurred from 6 to 24 hours of serum
starvation. In triple allele mutant MEF, percentage of ciliated cells and cilia lengths were similar
to control MEF. In contrast, percentage of ciliated Thm1-null MEF was lower than control MEF
(48% vs. 75%, respectively) at 6 hours serum starvation, and increased (to 64%) at 24 hours of
serum starvation, suggesting absence of Thm1 reduces and delays ciliogenesis. From 6 to 24
hours serum starvation, cilia length did not change in Thm1-null MEF, suggesting that events
required for axoneme elongation are hindered by Thm1 loss. A similar percentage of ciliated
cells and cilia length was observed in Thm1;Thm2 dko MEF as in Thm1-null MEF, suggesting
that Thm2 does not participate in cilia assembly.

Thm2 interacts with Thm1 to regulate cilia disassembly
Primary cilia undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly in coordination with the cell
cycle, and the cilia assembly:disassembly ratio regulates cilia length (21, 22). To examine cilia
disassembly, serum was added back to the media for 2 hours following 24 hours of serum
starvation.

In control and triple allele mutant MEF, percentage of ciliated cells was not

significantly altered (approximately 78%), but cilia length was decreased (Figures 1D and 1E).
In Thm1-null MEF, the 2-hour serum addition resulted in a lower mean of percent ciliated cells

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/803544; this version posted October 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

(63% vs. 55%) although this reduction did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, cilia
length was not altered. In Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF, serum addition significantly reduced percent
ciliated cells, but did not modify cilia length. These data suggest that the loss of Thm1 and Thm2
promotes cilia disassembly.
Following 2 hours of serum addition, cells were also immunostained for IFT-B protein,
IFT81. This revealed the presence of IFT81 to be separate and distal to its axonemal localization
(Figure 1F; cilia + dot). This observation may reflect the release of ciliary vesicles from the
distal tip, a phenomenon that is termed decapitation or ectocytosis, and contributes to cilia
disassembly (23). In Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko cells, frequency of IFT81 localization that
was separate from the axoneme was increased (Figure 1G), suggesting Thm1 regulates this
phenomenon.

Thm2 interacts with Thm1 to regulate retrograde transport of IFT-B component, IFT81
We next investigated the roles of Thm1 and Thm2 in ciliary protein transport. Following
24 hours of serum starvation to maximize cilia length, cells were immunostained for IFT-B
subunits, IFT81 and IFT52, and for anterograde IFT motor, KIF3A. Ciliary localization of IFTB proteins was similar between control and triple allele mutant MEF, while Thm1-null and
Thm1;Thm2 dko MEFs exhibited aberrant accumulation of proteins in a bulbous distal tip,
indicative of defective retrograde IFT (Figures 2A-2C). As described previously for IFT-A
mutant cells (7), protein localization was classified as either absent in cilia (Cilia-), present in
cilia without a bulb (Cilia w/o bulb), or present in cilia with a bulb (Cilia with bulb). Across all
genotypes, virtually 100% of cilia showed the presence of IFT81, IFT52 and KIF3A. However,
while most control and triple allele mutant MEF showed localization of IFT81, IFT52 and
KIF3A in cilia without a bulb, approximately 50% of Thm1-null and Thm1;Thm2 dko MEF
showed localization of IFT81, IFT52 and KIF3A in a bulbous ciliary distal tip. Additionally,
Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF displayed a higher percentage of cells with IFT81 localizing to a ciliary
bulbous distal tip than Thm1-null MEF (52% vs. 43%; Figure 2A). These data indicate that
THM1 is required for retrograde transport of these IFT-B proteins, and that THM2 enhances
THM1-mediated retrograde transport of IFT81.

Thm1 regulates ciliary entry and retrograde transport of IFT-A component, IFT140

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/803544; this version posted October 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

We next examined ciliary localization of IFT-A component, IFT140. Approximately 90%
of cilia of control and triple allele mutant MEF showed the presence of IFT140, while only 65%
of Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF had IFT140-positive cilia. Additionally, approximately
35% of Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko cilia showed IFT140 localization in a bulbous distal tip
(Figures 3A and 3B). These data indicate that THM1 mediates both ciliary entry and retrograde
transport of an IFT-A protein.

Thm1 mediates retrograde transport of BBSome subunits
The BBSome is an 8-subunit complex, which acts like an adaptor between IFT
complexes and protein cargo within cilia. BBSome subunits are normally rapidly exported from
cilia (7, 24, 25).

Consistent with this, we observed light ciliary staining of BBS2 in

approximately 80% of control and triple allele mutant MEF (Figures 4A-4C) and light ciliary
staining of BBS5 in approximately 62% of control and triple allele mutant MEF (Figures 4D-4F).
However, approximately 95% of Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF showed ciliary presence
of BBS2 and BBS5, and approximately 20% showed BBS2 and BBS5 localization in bulb-like
structures at the distal tip (Figures 4B and 4E). Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko cilia also
showed increased intensity of BBS2 and BBS5 immunofluorescence relative to control and triple
allele mutant cilia (Figures 4C and 4F). These data indicate that THM1 loss impairs retrograde
IFT of the BBSome.

Thm2 interacts with Thm1 to mediate ciliary localization of INPP5E
Since the IFT-A complex mediates ciliary entry of membrane-associated proteins (6-8),
we next examined ciliary localization of ARL13B and INPP5E. While 100% of control and
triple allele mutant MEF showed ciliary presence of ARL13B, approximately 90% of Thm1-null
and Thm1; Thm2 dko cilia were positive for ARL13B (Figures 5A and 5B). Additionally,
immunofluorescence intensity was decreased by almost 50% in Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko
cilia relative to control and triple allele mutant cilia (Figure 5C). Further, while 100% of control
and triple allele mutant MEF showed ciliary presence of INPP5E, only 50% of Thm1-null MEF
and 40% of Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF had INPP5E-positive cilia (Figures 5D and 5E). These data
suggest Thm1 regulates ciliary entry of ARL13B and INPP5E, and that Thm2 enhances Thm1mediated ciliary entry of INPP5E.

Thm2 interacts with Thm1 to regulate Hh signaling
During activation of the mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, the Smoothened
(SMO) signal transducer enriches in the primary cilium (26). In control MEF, treatment with
SMO agonist, SAG, resulted in presence of SMO in 60% of cilia, compared to 20% of cilia in
untreated MEF (Figures 6A and 6B). Treatment with SAG also induced expression of Gli1, a
transcriptional target and reporter of Hh activity (27).

In triple allele mutant MEF, SAG

treatment resulted in a ciliary enrichment of SMO similar to control cells (Figure 6B), yet Gli1
expression was reduced relative to control MEF (Figure 6C). In untreated Thm1-null and Thm1;
Thm2 dko MEF, SMO was present in 90% of cilia, and 20% showed SMO accumulation in a
bulbous distal tip (Figure 6A). With SAG treatment, approximately 90% of cilia were SMO+,
unchanged from untreated cells, but approximately 30% of cilia had SMO localized in a bulbous
distal tip (Figure 6B). SAG-induced Gli1 expression in Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF
was minimal to almost absent (Figure 6C). Thus, Thm1 regulates retrograde transport of SMO,
and also Hh pathway activity downstream of SMO ciliary localization. Further, Thm2 interacts
with Thm1, to positively regulate Hh signaling downstream of SMO ciliary localization.

Discussion
In this study, we reveal that Thm1 loss decreases cilia assembly, and that loss of both
Thm1 and Thm2 increases cilia disassembly. Since the ratio of cilia assembly:disassembly
governs cilia length, this may account for the shorter cilia length in Thm1-null and Thm1;Thm2
dko MEF. Further, in a Thm1-dependent manner, Thm2 also regulates retrograde IFT, and Hh
signaling activity downstream of SMO ciliary translocation.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that a role for IFT-A in cilia disassembly is shown.
In control MEF, two hours of serum restimulation following 24hrs of serum starvation did not
alter percentage of ciliated cells, but decreased cilia length. Conversely, in Thm1; Thm2 dko
cells, two hours of serum restimulation decreased percentage of ciliated cells, while cilia length
was unchanged. This difference between control and mutant cells may indicate that in the
presence of dysfunctional IFT-A, the mechanism of cilia disassembly is shifted.

Several

mechanisms contribute to cilia disassembly. These include cilia resorption, which gradually
shortens cilia length; complete cilia shedding, which cleaves the entire cilium; and a combination

of both mechanisms (28). The reduction in cilia length in control MEF suggests gradual cilia
resorption may be a predominant mechanism within 2hrs of FBS stimulation, whereas the
unaltered cilia length together with less ciliated Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF may suggest whole
cilium shedding may be more common when IFT-A is deficient. Additionally, we observed
increased frequency of IFT81 localization that was separate and distal to the ciliary axoneme in
Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko cells after 2 hour of serum addition. This IFT81 localization
may present decapitation or ectocytosis (23). The reduced ciliary INPP5E in Thm1-mutant and
Thm1; Thm2 dko MEF could promote ectocytosis, since Inpp5e-null MEF have enhanced
ectocytosis (23). Ectocytosis precedes cilia resorption (23), thus cilia resorption may also occur
in Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko cells, but may be more evident beyond 2 hours of serum
restimulation.

Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which IFT-A

dysfunction regulates cilia disassembly.
The IFT-A complex can be subdivided into core and peripheral subcomplexes, comprised
of IFT122/IFT140/IFT144 and of IFT42/IFT121/IFT139, respectively (18). Depletion of core
versus peripheral subcomplex components can result in different phenotypes. For instance,
Ift144-null RPE cells showed absence of SMO from cilia, suggesting defective ciliary import,
while Ift139-null RPE cells accumulated SMO in cilia, indicating defective retrograde IFT (18).
These contrasts may reflect differences in cargos carried by the subcomplexes or by the
individual IFT-A proteins. As a paralog of Thm1, Thm2 is likely a component of the IFT-A
peripheral subcomplex. Consistent with this, Thm1-null and Thm1;Thm2 dko MEF have ciliary
protein trafficking defects similar to those of RPE cells depleted of another peripheral
subcomplex component, Ift121/WDR35 (7). This includes defective retrograde transport of IFT
and BBSome proteins and impaired ciliary import of IFT-A protein, IFT140, and of membrane
proteins, ARL13B and INPP5E. Similar also to IFT121/WDR35-depleted cells, Thm1-null MEF
showed both reduced and delayed ciliogenesis. Reduced ciliary ARL13B in Thm1-null MEF
may contribute to the reduced cilia assembly, since ARL13B is essential for ciliary membrane
extension that is coupled to axoneme elongation (29).
Although ciliary presence of SMO was increased in Thm1-null and Thm1; Thm2 dko
MEF, Gli1 expression was not induced by SAG treatment (Fig 6C), suggesting THM1 is
required for Hh pathway activation downstream of SMO ciliary localization. This result was
unexpected since we previously observed increased Gli1 and Ptch1 expression in E10.5 Thm1-

null (Thm1aln/aln) whole-mount mouse embryos, and ventralization of the neural tube of E9.5 and
E10.5 Thm1-null embryos indicating enhanced activation of the Hh pathway (11).

Two

possibilities may explain this discrepancy. Additional signals or cell-cell interactions may be
present in vivo, resulting in enhanced activation of the pathway during development.
Alternatively, a study has demonstrated that Thm1 can act as either a positive or negative
regulator of Hh signaling in a cell-specific manner, since deletion of Thm1 resulted in reduced
Hh signaling in glial cells during cerebellum development (30). We observed that SAG-treated
triple allele mutant MEF had reduced pathway activation relative to control cells, indicating that
in a Thm1-dose dependent manner, Thm2 positively regulates Hh signaling downstream of SMO
ciliary localization in MEF.

In this light, absence of Hh activation in Thm1-null cells is

consistent with Thm1 acting as a positive modulator of Hh signaling in MEF. The factors that
determine whether Thm1 positively or negatively regulates the Hh pathway are yet to be defined.
Pathogenic mutations of THM1 have been identified in approximately 5% of patients
with ciliopathies (16).

Interestingly, one-third of patients with a homozygous mutation in

another ciliary gene also harbored a heterozygote Thm1 mutation, suggesting that THM1
mutations can have causal or modifying effects in human ciliopathies. More recently, mutations
in THM2 were reported in male individuals with subfertility (19). Our studies reveal that Thm2
interacts with Thm1, and thus identifying mutations in THM2 and THM1 in the same individual
may warrant investigation. Our findings that Thm1, alone and/or together with Thm2, regulates
ciliary protein trafficking, cilia assembly and disassembly, Hh signaling, and development,
provide insight into potential mechanisms underlying IFT-A related ciliopathies.
