ABSTRACT

26

Plant spectral diversity — how plants differentially interact with solar radiation — is an integrator

27

of plant chemical, structural, and taxonomic diversity that can be remotely sensed. We propose

28

to measure spectral diversity as spectral variance, which allows the partitioning of the spectral

29

diversity of a region, called spectral gamma (γ) diversity, into additive alpha (α; within

30

communities) and beta (β; among communities) components. Our method calculates the

31

contributions of individual bands or spectral features to spectral γ-, β-, and α-diversity, as well

32

as the contributions of individual plant communities to spectral diversity. We present two case

33

studies illustrating how our approach can identify “hotspots” of spectral α-diversity within a

34

region, and discover spectrally unique areas that contribute strongly to β-diversity. Partitioning

35

spectral diversity and mapping its spatial components has many applications for conservation

36

since high local diversity and distinctiveness in composition are two key criteria used to

37

determine the ecological value of ecosystems.

INTRODUCTION

39

Major environmental changes, including land-use change, climate change, and invasive species

40

are altering the Earth’s biodiversity. The rapid rate and broad extent of those changes far

41

exceed our capacity to monitor them via field-based sampling alone. This calls for the

42

development of new remote sensing approaches that can provide rapid estimates of biodiversity

43

over broad regions (Pereira et al. 2013; Turner 2014; Bush et al. 2017). For terrestrial plants,

44

imaging spectroscopy is emerging as the most promising remote sensing method for estimating

45

biodiversity (Féret & Asner 2014; Wang & Gamon 2019). This is because its high spectral

46

resolution allows plant species to be discriminated from one another, while also enabling the

47

determination of ecologically important foliar functional traits (Asner & Martin 2009; Ustin et al.

48

2009).

49

For every pixel of an aerial image, imaging spectroscopy measures reflected solar radiation in

50

tens to hundreds of contiguous, narrow (~10 nm wide) wavelength bands, usually covering all or

51

part of the visible to shortwave infrared range (400–2500 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum.

52

Leaf “spectral signatures” of plants provide unique expressions among species of how solar

53

radiation interacts with photosynthetic pigments, water, proteins, as well as structural and

54

chemical defense compounds, and thus represent the evolution of plant adaptations to different

55

environmental conditions (Cavender-Bares et al. 2016; McManus et al. 2016). At the crown

56

scale, these spectral signatures are further influenced by architectural traits due to scattering of

57

photons within canopies (Asner 1998; Ollinger 2010). Therefore, plant spectral diversity is

58

emerging as an integrator of plant chemical, structural and taxonomic diversity that can be

59

remotely sensed (Cavender-Bares et al. 2017; Schweiger et al. 2018; see also Appendix S1 in

60

Supporting Information).

61

One of the most influential conceptual developments in community ecology has been

62

Whittaker’s (1960, 1972) suggestion to partition biodiversity across space into α, β, and γ

63

components. Originally, α diversity was defined as the species diversity within communities, and

64

β as the variation in species composition among communities; together, α- and β-diversities

65

jointly determined γ-diversity, which is the species diversity across an entire region of interest. In

66

this paper, we transpose this foundational ecological concept from species diversity to spectral

67

diversity (Fig. 1). This requires that the spatial resolution of the imagery matches the size of the

68

object of interest (Woodcock & Strahler 1987), meaning that pixels should be approximately

69

equal or smaller than the size of an average canopy plant. At such fine spatial resolutions, the

70

relationship between spectral and taxonomic diversity is strongest (Wang et al. 2018a) and

71

imaging spectroscopy can provide direct, spatially explicit estimates of plant alpha (α; within

72

community) diversity (Féret & Asner 2014; Wang et al. 2018b), and can detect changes in plant

73

community composition across landscapes (Draper et al. 2019). The ability to generate wall-to-

74

wall, high-resolution maps of canopy plant diversity across entire regions brings tremendous

75

benefits for biodiversity science and conservation (e.g., Asner et al. 2017); however, conceptual

76

and methodological challenges remain, especially with regard to β-diversity estimation (Rocchini

77

et al. 2010, 2018).

78

Spectral diversity is sometimes called spectral heterogeneity or spectral variability (Rocchini et

79

al. 2010), and has been defined as spatial variation in spectral reflectance (Rocchini et al. 2010;

80

Ustin & Gamon 2010; Gholizadeh et al. 2018; Wang & Gamon 2019). Intuitively, spectral

81

diversity can be conceptualized as multivariate dispersion, for which there are various statistical

82

measures highlighting different aspects of spectral diversity. For example, Wang et al. (2018a)

83

used the average coefficient of variation (CV) of each band for a set of pixels, whereas Rocchini

84

et al. (2010) used the mean distance from the spectral centroid; we note that the latter has also

85

been proposed as a measure of functional diversity in multivariate trait space (Laliberté &

86

Legendre 2010). However, none of the currently used metrics allow the partitioning of spectral

87

diversity into its α (within communities) and β (among communities) components (Fig. 1).

88

Here we propose to use the spectral variance among image pixels as a measure of spectral

89

diversity. Our approach builds on that of Legendre and De Cáceres (2013) for species inventory

90

data, adapts it to spectral data, and extends it to jointly consider α-, β-, and γ-diversity. Casting

91

spectral diversity as spectral variance has a number of benefits:

92

1. the classical partitioning of sums of squares allows us to partition spectral γ-diversity into

93

additive spectral α- and β-diversity components (Fig. 1), from which the relative

94

importance of local and regional processes regulating spectral diversity across a region

95

of interest can be inferred;

96

2. it allows us to estimate the contributions of individual plots or communities to spectral β-

97

diversity, highlighting areas that are spectrally distinct within the broader region;

98

3. it allows us to calculate the contributions of individual bands or spectral features to

99
100
101
102

spectral γ-, β- or α-diversity (Fig. 2), providing information about the underlying biological
traits driving spectral diversity;
4. it is easily implemented in software packages in a computationally efficient way, which is
important when dealing with high-volume image data;

103

5. it provides a direct link to other statistical procedures based on least squares (e.g.,

104

MANOVA, multiple linear regression, canonical redundancy analysis, K-means

105

partitioning).

106

After describing the theory behind our spectral diversity partitioning approach, we illustrate it

107

using a simulation. We then apply our method to imaging spectroscopy data collected over the

108

Bartlett Experimental Forest by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne

PARTITIONING SPECTRAL DIVERSITY

112

Size and shape of spatial units

113

Partitioning spectral γ-diversity into its α and β components first requires defining the extent of

114

the region of interest (Fig. 1). Delineating the region of interest is relatively straightforward since

115

it corresponds to the region over which imagery is acquired or a subset thereof. Delineating the

116

size and shape of communities across the region of interest, however, is more difficult. What

117

constitutes an ecological community has been the subject of considerable debate (see review

118

by Ricklefs 2008). Generally, a community is defined as “a group of organisms representing

119

multiple species living in a specified place and time” (Vellend 2010). This definition implies that

120

a community must be larger than the size of an individual organism, but how much larger will

121

depend on the objectives of the study. For the purpose of this work, we focus on communities of

122

canopy plants, because these are the organisms that can be seen in aerial images. We use

123

“community” in the sense of “sampling unit” in vegetation surveys, which can be defined as the

124

area in which the species composition of the vegetation type of interest is adequately

125

represented (Mueller-Dombois & Ellenberg 1974).

126

Setting the size of a community to the size of typical inventory plot for a given ecosystem type

127

facilitates interpretation as this is the sampling unit that field ecologists are familiar with. For

128

example, forest inventory plots often measure 20 m × 20 m (Fig. 1), which is large enough to

129

include several canopy trees. However, we recognize that setting fixed and regularly shaped

130

boundaries to delineate communities is artificial (Ricklefs 2008), and point out that community

131

size and shape can be changed in the analysis.

Spectral gamma (γ) diversity

133

Let Y = [yij] be a matrix containing the positions, along the p axes defining the spectral space

134

(column vectors y1, y2, … yp of Y), of n pixels (row vectors x1, x2, … xn of Y) in a region of

135

interest (Fig. 2). We use indices i and j to denote rows (pixels) and columns (axes) of matrix Y,

136

respectively. The p axes could be all or a subset of the original spectral bands, a set of

137

vegetation indices calculated from selected spectral bands (Bannari et al. 1995), or a set of p

138

uncorrelated spectral features extracted using dimensionality reduction methods such as

139

principal component analysis (PCA). We use PCA in this section and in our case studies and

140

point out the mathematical relationships between the principal components (PCs) and spectral

141

variation below. We use the general term variation for sums of squares (SS, an abbreviation for

142

“sum of the squared deviations from the mean”), and reserve the term variance when talking

143

about spectral diversity (SD).

144

We refer to the total spectral diversity of the entire region as spectral γ-diversity (SDγ). SDγ is

145

measured by the total variance of Y, or Var(Y). This is done by first computing for every pixel

146

and spectral feature yij the squared deviations sij from the average pixel (across the whole

147

region) in terms of spectral reflectance, i.e. the column means of Y:
)

𝑠"# = %𝑦"# − 𝑦# ( .
148

(1)

The total sum of squares (SS) of matrix Y is calculated by summing all sij:
SS+ = ∑0"./ ∑-#./ 𝑠"# .

(2)

149

Contrary to SSγ, SDγ is scaled by the number of pixels in the region, such that SDγ of regions

150

containing different numbers of pixels can be compared with one another:
SD+ = Var(𝐘) = SS+ ⁄(𝑛 − 1).

151

We note that for calculating the joint SDγ of adjacent regions, their SSγ statistics can be added

152

and divided by the total number of pixels minus one, but their region-level SDγ statistics cannot

153

be added directly.

154

One might be interested in determining the individual contribution of the jth spectral feature to

155

SSγ. We call this the feature contribution to spectral γ-diversity or FCSDγ,j (Fig. 2), which can be

156

calculated from the sum of squares of the jth feature:
SS+,# = ∑0"./ 𝑠"# .

157

Dividing SSγ,j by (n – 1) gives the variance of the jth feature, or Var(yj). FCSDγ,j can then be

158

calculated as:
FCSD+,# = Var(𝐲# )⁄Var(𝐘) = SS+,# ⁄SS+ .

(4)

(5)

159

If the p features are principal components from PCA scaling type 1, then the FCSDγ,j values

160

correspond to their relative eigenvalues. We note that FCSDγ,j cannot be mapped because the

161

contribution of each spectral feature applies to the region as a whole.

162

Likewise, one might wish to estimate the individual contribution of the ith pixel within the region

163

to SDγ. We refer to this as the local contribution to spectral γ-diversity, or LCSDγ,i, which is

164

calculated as:

165

LCSD+," = SS+," ⁄SS+

(6)

SS+," = ∑-#./ 𝑠"# .

(7)

where

166

We note that LCSDγ,i indices are important visual elements in PCA ordination: each LCSDγ,i

167

value corresponds to the squared distance from one pixel to the centroid in the p-dimensional

168

PCA ordination plot. In addition, the LCSDγ,i can be plotted on maps since one value is

169

associated with every pixel in the image. Doing so indicates which pixels are most spectrally

170

dissimilar from the mean pixel of the region in spectral feature space. We note that the SSγ,i and

171

LCSDγ,i indices are additive. The indices from adjacent pixels within an area of interest, for

172

example an individual tree, can be added up, such that their sums represent the local

173

contributions of the area of interest to SSγ and SDγ. LCSD indices are also useful when

174

computed at the community scale (i.e. LCSDβ), because they then correspond to the ecological

175

concept of β-diversity; see “Spectral beta (β) diversity” below.

176

Partitioning the total sum of squares

177

Partitioning the sum of squares forms the basis of a series of classic statistical approaches

178

based on least squares, such as the analysis of variance (ANOVA). From these methods, it is

179

well known that the total sum of squares of a matrix Y (SStotal) can be partitioned into additive

180

among-group (SSamong) and within-group (SSwithin) components:
SS@A@BC = SSBDAEF + SSHI@JIE.

(8)

181

In linear regression analysis, we talk about the SS explained by the regression equation and the

182

residual variation. These two components sum to the total sum of squares.

183

Using the same indices as in the previous section, the ANOVA relationship can be expressed

184

as:

187

and where m is the number of samples (rows) in each group k; an important assumption here is

188

that m is equal in each group. The proof of this theorem can be found in standard statistics

189

textbooks and is therefore not shown here.

190

In the next two sections, we apply Equation 9 to partition the total sum of squares of a region

191

SSγ into additive among- (β) and within-group (α) components from which spectral β- and α-

192

diversity can be calculated directly.

193

Spectral beta (β) diversity

194

Let us divide Y into q groups of m spatially contiguous pixels, where each group corresponds to

195

a local community (e.g., a vegetation survey plot); n = q m. Here, we assume that each of these

196

communities corresponds to a square of equal area, which is √𝑚 pixels wide; with this setup,

197

each community is represented by the same number of pixels. We will present later our

198

suggestion to use a rarefaction procedure to handle situations where m differs among groups.

199

Spectral β-diversity, or SDβ, represents the degree to which the q communities within a region

200

differ from each other in terms of spectral composition. We note that SDβ is a non-directional

201

measure of β-diversity sensu Anderson et al. (2011). To calculate SDβ, we first compute the

202

squared deviations skj of the kth community from the average pixel of the region in terms of

203

spectral reflectance, i.e. the column means of Y across all variables j:
sS# = N𝑦TS# − 𝑦O# P

)

(11)

204

where 𝑦TS# is the arithmetic mean of the kth community (i.e. the community centroid) for the jth

205

spectral feature (Equation 10).

206

The sum of squares associated with each community k (SSβ,k) is:

(12)

R

SS[,S

(13)

from which SDβ is calculated as:
SD[ = SS[ ⁄(𝑛 − 1).

(14)

209

The contribution of each community k to SDβ, which we call the local contribution to spectral β-

210

diversity (LCSDβ,k), can be computed by the following ratio of sum of squares:
LCSD[,S = SS[,S ⁄SS[ .

(15)

211

Finally, one can compute the feature contribution to spectral β-diversity or FCSDβ,j of the jth

212

spectral feature as:

213

FCSD[,# = SS[,# ⁄SS[

(16)

SS[,# = ∑RS./ 𝑚 𝑠S# .

(17)

where

214

We note here that LCSDβ,k can be mapped because each community k has its own LCSDβ

215

value. On the other hand, FCSDβ,j or SDβ cannot be mapped because they refer to the region as

216

a whole.

217

Spectral alpha (α) diversity

218

Spectral α-diversity, or SDα, is the degree to which neighbouring pixels within a local community

219

differ spectrally from each other. Contrary to SDβ and SDγ, which apply to the entire region, SDα

220

is defined at the community level. Therefore, we denote SDα by the index k, SDα,k, since it is

221

measured for each community k. To calculate SDα,k, we first compute for every pixel and

223

the kth community for each spectral feature or column of Y:
)

s"#S = N𝑦"#S − 𝑦TS# P .
224

The sum of squares associated with the jth spectral feature of community k is:
SS\,#S = ∑U
"./ 𝑠"#S ,

225

(18)

(19)

and the total sum of squares for community k is:
-

SS\,S = ∑#./ ∑U
"./ 𝑠"#S .

(20)

226

SDα,k is obtained by dividing SSα,k by (m – 1), where m is the number of pixels within one

227

community, to make it comparable with other communities differing in their numbers of pixels:
SD\,S = SS\,S ⁄(𝑚 − 1).

228

The total sum of squares of the α-component for all q communities within the entire region is:
SS\ = ∑RS./ SS\,S .

229

(21)

(22)

Importantly, following Equations 8 and 9, SSα and SSβ are linked to SSγ by the relationship:
SS+ = SS[ + SS\ .

(23)

230

Therefore, SSα and SSβ can be used directly to determine the relative importance of the α and β

231

components to spectral γ-diversity.

232

Finally, the contribution of the jth feature to the spectral α-diversity of the kth community, which

233

we call FCSDα,jk, can be computed as:
FCSD\,#S = SS\,#S ⁄SS\,S .

234

These FCSDα,jk values can be mapped and give us useful information about the origin of

235

spectral α-diversity across different communities.

CASE STUDY 1: SIMULATED REGIONS

237

To illustrate our approach, we first use leaf spectra data to simulate imagery (Appendix S2).

238

This removes much of the complexity associated with real imagery, where one has to deal with

239

much higher numbers of pixels, varying illumination and sensor viewing geometry, and

240

presence of shaded and non-vegetated pixels. We simulated two regions with equal spectral γ-

241

diversity, but contrasting spectral β- and α-diversities (Fig. 3). Each region is composed of 25 ×

242

25 pixels, populated with leaf-level spectra of three temperate tree species (i.e. Populus

243

deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall subsp. deltoides Marsh, P. tremuloides Michaux, and Betula

244

alleghaniensis Britton) measured in the field on 15 individual plants (Fig. S1). These 25 × 25

245

pixels regions are equally split into 25 communities, each composed of 5 × 5 pixels.

246

For both scenarios, we calculated the SS across the entire region (SSγ), partitioned SSγ into its

247

β and α components, and calculated spectral γ- β-, and α-diversity (Fig. 4a). As spectral

248

features (columns of Y) we used the first three PCs (using type-I scaling in PCA), which

249

together explained >97% of the total variation in spectral reflectance. As expected, spectral γ-

250

diversity was equal for both scenarios (Table 1), whether expressed as the total sum of squares

251

(SSγ = 1.66), or standardized by n – 1 pixels (SDγ = 0.0027). In addition, in the high β-diversity

252

scenario, spectral variation among communities (SSβ, ~84%) largely exceeded spectral

253

variation within communities (SSα, ~16%), whereas in the low β-diversity scenario SSβ was

254

much lower (~5%) than SSα (~95%) (Table 1).

255

Next, we determined the local contributions of individual communities to spectral β-diversity

256

(LCSDβ). In the high β-diversity scenario (Fig. 4b, left panel), communities 12 and 21 (numbered

257

as in Fig. 3) contributed the most to spectral β-diversity. These were the only two plots (out of

258

25) containing spectra of Populus tremuloides. In other words, these two plots had the most

259

distinctive spectral composition compared to other communities. By contrast, in the low β-

260

diversity scenario, community 16 was the most spectrally distinct community, something that

261

could not be easily detected by examining this scenario visually (Fig. 3, right panel). As

262

illustrated here, it is important to note that a region with low SDβ can still have individual

263

communities showing high LCSDβ values, because LCSDβ values are proportions of SDβ.

264

We then estimated the contributions of individual spectral features to spectral diversity (FCSD)

265

for each scenario. For spectral γ-diversity (total variance of the region), FCSDγ declined

266

progressively from the first to the third PC (Table 1). As mentioned previously, FCSDγ values are

267

equal to the relative PCA eigenvalues of the spectral feature. Likewise, for spectral β-diversity,

268

the contribution from the first to subsequent PCs decreased in both scenarios (Table 1). The

269

relative contributions of individual spectral features to β-diversity were fairly similar in both

270

regions, even though they differed considerably in spectral β-diversity. For spectral α-diversity,

271

however, FCSDα values differed noticeably among the two scenarios (Fig. 4c–d). In the low α-

272

diversity scenario (Fig. 4c-d, left column), PC 2 contributed more strongly to the spectral α-

273

diversity of most communities than PC 1, whereas the opposite was true for the high α-diversity

274

scenario (Fig. 4c–d, right column). The FCSDα values were not expected to decrease in a

275

monotonic way since α-diversity is orthogonal to γ-diversity and the PCs are those of γ-, not of

276

α-diversity.

277

We note that SS, SD and LCSD indices are exactly the same whether using the original spectral

278

bands or all PCs, because PCA type-I scaling preserves the Euclidean distance among objects

279

(e.g., image pixels in spectral space). Conversely, the equations developed in this paper hold

280

and can be used directly with the original band data. However, FCSD values would change

281

when using the original spectral bands instead of PCs, since this would then indicate the relative

282

contributions of individual spectral bands (instead of PCs) to spectral diversity.

CASE STUDY 2: NEON IMAGERY

284

Next, we applied our method for partitioning spectral diversity to imaging spectroscopy data

285

collected by NEON’s Airborne Observation Platform (AOP; Kampe et al. 2010) over the Bartlett

286

Experimental Forest (https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/BART). In this case

287

study, we used a scene measuring 280 m (east-west) x 1000 m (north-south), acquired in

288

August 2017. Spectral data were processed to surface reflectance and subsampled to 1-m pixel

289

size by NEON. Our workflow is illustrated in Figure 2.

290

For spectral diversity calculations we selected a community (i.e. plot) size of 40 m × 40 m, which

291

is the base plot size used by NEON. We used rarefaction to standardize the number of pixels

292

per community used for analysis. We used a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)

293

threshold of ≥0.8 to identify the minimum number of vegetated pixels across all plots in the

294

image (termed mmin), which was 1474 (= 92% of the 1600 pixels per community). We randomly

295

selected mmin pixels per plot, and applied our spectral diversity partitioning approach to all

296

selected pixels. The rarefaction was repeated 30 times and results were averaged across all 30

297

repeats (Fig. 2). Alternatively, one could take the median value instead of the mean if

298

distributions are skewed.

299

Our analyses revealed that spectral α-diversity in this forested landscape accounted for 77% of

300

the spectral γ-diversity, whereas β-diversity accounted for the remaining 23% (Table 1). In other

301

words, there is considerably more spectral diversity within individual 40 m × 40 m communities

302

than among communities in this forest. Figure 5 illustrates how spectral diversity is spatially

303

structured. Two areas contribute strongly to spectral β-diversity (LCSDβ, darker colours in Fig.

304

5). The tree communities in these areas are more spectrally dissimilar from the average

305

community than communities with lower LCSDβ (lighter colours in Fig. 5).

306

For completeness, we evaluated the effects of shadows and community size on spectral

307

diversity calculations (Appendix S3). We found that removing shadows had little influence on

308

spectral diversity (Figs. S4–S6) and that results remained remarkably stable for plots ranging

309

from 20 m × 20 m (400 m2) to 140 m x 140 m (almost 2 ha) in size (Figs. S7–S9).

310

DISCUSSION

311

In this paper, we proposed a new method for partitioning plant spectral γ-diversity (i.e. the

312

spectral diversity of a region) into additive α- (within community) and β-diversity (among

313

community) components. Our approach builds on a method for partitioning β-diversity initially

314

designed for community data (Legendre & Cáceres 2013), adapts it to spectral data and,

315

importantly, extends it to include α, β and γ components. Partitioning spectral diversity can bring

316

new insights and generate new hypotheses about the origins and maintenance of plant spectral

317

diversity across regions. For instance, high spectral β-diversity could result from turnover in

318

plant species and/or functional trait composition across environmental gradients (e.g., soil

319

properties, hydrology), whereas high spectral α-diversity might result from local biotic

320

interactions among co-occurring plants (e.g., resource partitioning, conspecific negative density

321

dependence). Mapping spectral indices such as LCSDβ and SDα could be used as a biodiversity

322

“discovery tool” to design targeted field sampling campaigns to test such hypotheses, e.g., by

323

comparing community composition and diversity in areas with high and low LCSDβ and SDα

324

values, respectively (Fig. 5).

325

Partitioning spectral diversity allows the determination of the spectral features contributing most

326

strongly to spectral α-, β- or γ-diversity (FCSD), which helps in understanding the underlying

327

biological traits driving spectral diversity at different spatial scales. In our case studies, the

328

spectral features were principal components (PCs), which are linear combinations of the original

329

wavelength bands. As such, the individual contributions of all wavelength bands to each

330

spectral feature can be retrieved. The bands, in turn, can be linked to specific plant properties,

331

since the biophysical and biological causes of spectral variation across spectral regions and for

332

specific absorption features of molecules are reasonably well understood (Gates et al. 1965;

333

Curran 1989; Asner 1998; Kokaly et al. 2009; Ustin et al. 2009). Identifying the traits contributing

334

most strongly to spectral α-diversity might inform us about how co-occurring species are

335

partitioning resources at the local scale, whereas identifying the traits contributing most strongly

336

to spectral β-diversity might reveal important mechanisms driving changes in community

337

composition across environmental gradients.

338

Partitioning plant spectral diversity and mapping its spatial components has applications in

339

biodiversity management. Indeed, managers often need to estimate the ecological value of

340

different ecosystems over large regions, for example to prioritize conservation or restoration

341

efforts. However, access to field data might be limited. Using imaging spectroscopy data, our

342

approach of partitioning spectral diversity allows the identification of areas with high spectral α-

343

diversity, which likely coincide with local “hotspots” of taxonomic and/or functional trait diversity.

344

Further, high LCSDβ values indicates areas with rare spectral composition, i.e., containing

345

communities that are most spectrally dissimilar from the average community within the region of

346

interest. Given that species spectral dissimilarity is linked to their functional and phylogenetic

347

dissimilarity (Schweiger et al. 2018), spectrally rare communities can be expected to have rare

348

taxonomic and/or functional composition, either because they harbor uncommon species, or

349

rare combinations of common species.

350

Our approach measures spectral variance directly (Fig. 2), which is in contrast to other studies

351

that have prior to deriving biodiversity metrics first translated remotely-sensed spectra into plant

352

species (e.g., Féret & Asner 2013), “spectral species” (Féret & Asner 2014), or plant functional

353

traits (e.g., Dahlin et al. 2013; Schneider et al. 2017). While spectral diversity does not isolate

354

any particular facet of plant biodiversity (e.g., taxonomic, chemical, structural), it integrates all of

355

these facets (Schweiger et al. 2018; Appendix S1). From a practical perspective, casting

356

spectral diversity as spectral variance depends on fewer user decisions compared to other

357

approaches (e.g., selecting the number of clusters for classifying spectral species, selecting the

358

plant traits and modelling approach to predict traits from spectra). This makes spectral diversity

359

easily comparable across different regions. Therefore, maps of SDα and LCSDβ could be ideal

360

candidates for biodiversity products from remotely sensed spectral imagery.

361

Comparison with other approaches

362

Much of the interest in measuring spectral diversity from remote sensing data stems from the

363

spectral variation hypothesis (Palmer et al. 2002), stating that the spatial variation in spectral

364

reflectance expresses overall variation of the environment. As areas of high environmental

365

variation often harbour more species than areas with low environmental variation, spectral

366

variation across space can potentially uncover botanically interesting areas (Palmer et al. 2002).

367

However, spectral diversity has been predominantly used to investigate relationships between

368

plant spectra and taxonomic units at the α- and γ-diversity scale, whereas the β component has

369

received less attention (Rocchini et al. 2018).

370

Historically, Landsat satellites were instrumental for spurring large-scale biodiversity studies.

371

Early sensors contained few spectral bands; thus, a large body of literature deals with using

372

NDVI for predicting and mapping taxonomic diversity (Gould 2000; see review by Pettorelli et al.

373

2005). Recent advances in sensor technology, particularly increased spectral resolution, have

374

led to a variety of approaches to calculate spectral α-diversity (Rocchini et al. 2010). This

375

includes metrics such as the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of spectral indices

376

(Oindo & Skidmore 2002), or spectral bands among pixels (Hall et al. 2010; Gholizadeh et al.

377

2018; Wang et al. 2018a), the convex hull volume of pixels in spectral feature space (Dahlin

378

2016), the mean distance of pixels from the spectral centroid (Rocchini et al. 2010), the number

379

of spectrally distinct clusters or spectral species in ordination space (Féret & Asner 2014), and

380

diversity metrics based on dissimilarity matrices among species spectra or image pixels

381

(Schweiger et al. 2018). Of these, our method is most similar to the mean distance to the

382

spectral centroid (Rocchini et al. 2010). The difference is that we square the individual distances

383

to the spectral centroid; doing so allows us to partition sums of squares into additive

384

components (Equation 9).

385

Fewer studies have considered spectral β-diversity (Rocchini et al. 2018). One approach for

386

studying β-diversity using spectra has been to combine ordination scores of species inventories

387

with spectral data in multivariate models to predict the positions of pixels with unknown species

388

composition in species-ordination-space (Schmidtlein et al. 2007). This method and some of its

389

variants (Rocchini et al. 2018) do not measure spectral β-diversity per se, but instead use

390

spectra to estimate changes in community composition across the landscape. Rao’s quadratic

391

entropy has been suggested as a measure of spectral β-diversity, based on the dissimilarity

392

among image pixels within a moving window (Rocchini et al. 2018). However, a moving window

393

approach expresses spectral β-diversity for many small sub-regions independently from one

394

another and does not estimate the spectral β-diversity of the region as a whole. Another

395

approach for studying spectral β-diversity has been to measure the pairwise dissimilarity in the

396

composition of spectral species among mapping units, and to re-project those pairwise

397

dissimilarities onto an RGB colour space (Féret & Asner 2014). This method yields a useful map

398

showing changes in spectral composition across the region, similar to our mapping of the first

399

three PCs in Figure 5, but it does not calculate spectral diversity.

400

Methodological considerations

401

A number of methodological aspects should be considered before applying our approach to

402

imaging spectroscopy data. These include: (1) the choice of a brightness normalization

19

403

procedure, (2) whether all or a subset of the wavelength bands, or spectral features, should be

404

used, (3) masking non-vegetated pixels, or not, (4) determining community size, and (5)

405

deciding on the scaling type (i.e. type I or II; Legendre & Legendre 2012) if using PCA as a

406

spectral feature extraction method. We discuss these methodological points in detail in

407

Appendix S4.

408

CONCLUSION

409

Plant spectral diversity is emerging as an integrator of chemical, structural, and taxonomic

410

aspects of plant biodiversity, which can be remotely sensed (Cavender-Bares et al. 2017).

411

Partitioning plant spectral diversity using our approach can help us to better understand and

412

generate new hypotheses about the origins of, and the processes that drive, biodiversity

413

variation across regions. Given the rapid and broad extent of current environmental changes,

414

remote sensing of plant biodiversity over large regions is more important than ever (Turner

415

2014; Wang & Gamon 2019). Our approach can identify local α-diversity hotspots as well as

416

unique areas contributing strongly to β-diversity – two central facets of biodiversity.

417

Our approach is timely since current technological developments in high-resolution UAV

418

imaging spectroscopy will make this technology more accessible to ecologists in the coming

419

years (Aasen et al. 2018; Arroyo-Mora et al. 2019). For example, the Canadian Airborne

420

Biodiversity Observatory (www.caboscience.org) is developing UAV spectroscopy to understand

421

how plant biodiversity is responding to major environmental changes across Canada. We

422

anticipate that a growing number of ecologists will embrace this transformative technology for

423

mapping plant biodiversity. In fact, a wealth of moderate-resolution imaging spectroscopy data

424

are already freely available for a wide range of ecosystems across the United States as part of

425

the NEON program (www.neonscience.org). Partitioning spectral diversity could become a

426

useful tool for remotely sensing plant biodiversity from these new data sources.

Figure 1 Partitioning plant spectral γ-diversity into additive β and α components. A region of

562

interest is split into a number of communities of a specific size and shape (here, 20 m × 20 m

563

squares, representing standard forest inventory plots). Spectral γ-diversity refers to the total

564

spectral diversity in the entire region calculated from pixel-level reflectance. The β component

565

corresponds to spectral diversity among communities, with similar colours sharing more similar

566

spectral composition. The α component refers to spectral diversity within individual

567

communities. The left-most panel is a true colour (red-green-blue, RGB) image of an area of

568

Bartlett Experimental Forest; colours for the other panels were obtained using the reflectance of

569

different wavelength bands (R = 779 nm, G = 639 nm, B = 2301 nm), followed by linear

570

stretching.

571

Figure 2 Overview of our proposed workflow for partitioning plant spectral diversity. In our

572

NEON case study, spectral data pre-processing included removing atmospheric water

573

absorption bands (wavelengths between 1340–1455 nm and 1790–1955 nm) and noisy regions

574

of the spectrum (wavelengths <400 nm and >2400 nm), and applying a Savitzky-Golay filter

575

(order = 3, size = 7) to every pixel in the image to remove high-frequency noise. We masked all

576

pixels with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values <0.8, and brightness-

577

normalized all spectra (Feilhauer et al. 2010). Then, we performed a PCA with type I-scaling,

578

and visually inspected the first 17 PCs which together accounted for >99% of the total spectral

579

variation among all pixels (Fig. S3). Only the first five PCs showed meaningful biological spatial

580

patterns and were retained for spectral diversity measurements; PCs 6–17 were excluded

581

based on visual inspection as they expressed artefacts from image acquisition and processing

582

(Fig. S3). For illustration purposes, in the diversity partitioning analysis (bottom panel) we show

583

communities composed of only three pixels, whereas in fact we used a community size of 40 ×

Figure 3 Two simulated landscapes of equal spectral γ-diversity, but with contrasting spectral β-

587

diversity and α-diversity. Left: high spectral β-diversity but low α-diversity. Right: low spectral β-

588

diversity but high α-diversity. Each landscape is composed of 25 communities (numbered black

589

squares), each composed of 5 × 5 pixels (smaller coloured squares). The size of each pixel is

590

equivalent to the size of an individual plant and their colour corresponds to one of the 15 leaf

591

spectra (= 3 species × 5 individuals) shown in Figure S1. These colours were set by mapping

592

the scores of the first three principal components (PC) for each spectrum to a red-green-blue

593

(RGB) scale (PC 1 = green, PC 2 = red, PC 3 = blue). We generated the high spectral β-

594

diversity but low spectral α-diversity scenario (left panel) by randomly assigning (with

595

replacement) pixels within each community with individual spectra from single species (Fig. S1,

596

bottom row). We selected species identity per community at random using the following

597

probabilities: 0.60 (Betula alleghaniensis, green hues), 0.35 (Populus deltoides, blue hues) and

598

0.05 (Populus tremuloides, red hues). In this scenario, spectral β-diversity was high and spectral

599

α-diversity low because interspecific spectral variation (particularly between Betula and the two

600

Populus species) was higher than intraspecific spectral variation (Fig. S2). Next, to reduce

601

spectral β-diversity and increase α-diversity while holding γ-diversity constant, we moved the

602

pixels of the left panel to randomly selected positions in the right panel.
