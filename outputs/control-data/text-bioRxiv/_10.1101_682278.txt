ABSTRACT
Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen
responsible for septicaemia and endocarditis in elderly persons. Sgg is also a commensal of the
human gastrointestinal tract. Here we demonstrate that Sgg strain UCN34 translocates across
tight intestinal barriers in vitro in a Pil3-dependent manner. Confocal images of UCN34 passage
across human colonic cells reveals that Sgg utilizes a paracellular pathway. Pil3 was previously
shown to be expressed heterogeneously and WT UCN34 consists of about 90% of Pil3low and
10% of Pil3high cells. We found that both the ∆pil3 mutant and the Pil3+ overexpressing variant
could not translocate across Caco-2 and T84 barriers. Interestingly, combining live ∆pil3 mutant
cells with fixed Pil3+ variants in a 10:1 ratio (mimicking UCN34 WT population) allowed efficient
translocation of the ∆pil3 mutant. These experiments demonstrate that heterogeneous
expression of Pil3 plays a key role in optimal translocation of Sgg across the intestinal barrier.

ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for
septicemia and infective endocarditis in elderly persons. Sgg is a commensal of the rumen of
herbivores and transmission to humans most probably occurs through the oral route. In this
work, we have studied how this bacterium crosses the intestinal barrier using well-known in vitro
models. Confocal microscopy images revealed that Sgg UCN34 can traverse the epithelial
monolayer in between adjacent cells. We next showed that passage of Sgg from the apical to
the basolateral compartment is dependent on the heterogenous expression of the Pil3 pilus at
the bacterial surface. We hypothesize that Pil3high cocci adhere firmly to epithelial cells to
activate transient opening of tight junctions thereby allowing the traversal of Pil3low bacteria.

INTRODUCTION

2
3

Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg), formerly known as S. bovis biotype I,

4

is an emerging opportunistic pathogen responsible for septicemia and infective endocarditis in

5

elderly and immunocompromised individuals (1, 2). This Gram-positive coccus is one of the few

6

intestinal bacteria that have been consistently linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) over the last 40

7

years (3) and a recent study confirms this suspicion (4). Whether Sgg is a driver and/or

8

passenger of CRC is the subject of recent studies and evidence for both models have been

9

obtained experimentally (5–10).

10

The first complete S. gallolyticus genome obtained was that of strain UCN34, isolated

11

from a patient suffering from endocarditis and later diagnosed for colon cancer, provided

12

important insights on the adaptation and virulence strategies developed by this bacterium (11).

13

We previously showed that the Pil1 pilus is important for binding to collagen through the pilus

14

associated adhesin Pil1A as well as colonization of heart valves in a rat model of experimental

15

endocarditis (12). We also showed that the Pil3 pilus is important for colonization of the host

16

colon via attachment to the intestinal mucus covering colonic cells (13, 14).

17

Pil1 and Pil3 are both expressed heterogeneously in the UCN34 population, with a

18

majority of cells weakly piliated and a minority highly piliated, through a mechanism combining

19

phase variation and attenuation (15).

20

In this report we investigated how Sgg adheres to and translocates across tight epithelial

21

barriers in the absence of a secreted mucus layer. We demonstrate a key role of the Pil3 pilus in

22

this process and visualized Sgg passage through a paracellular pathway. Our results indicate

23

that in the UCN34 WT Sgg population, the highly piliated bacteria activate opening of the tight

24

junctions to allow paracellular crossing of Pil3low expressing bacteria. This demonstrates the

25

functional relevance of Pil3 heterogeneity by a very unique mechanism.

RESULTS

28

The Sgg Pil3 pilus enhances adherence to human colonic cells

29

Streptococcal pili have been implicated both in adherence to eukaryotic cells as well as in

30

bacterial translocation across host epithelial barriers (16, 17). We previously showed that the

31

Sgg Pil3 pilus strongly contributes to bacterial attachment to human mucus-producing cells

32

HT29-MTX (13). Therefore, we wondered whether Pil3 could also play a role in bacterial

33

translocation. However, HT29-MTX cells were not able to form tight epithelial barriers on

34

Transwell filters. We therefore tested two other well-studied human colonic cell lines Caco-2 and

35

T84, which are both able to form tightly polarized epithelial monolayers in vitro (18).

36

We first compared adherence of Sgg UCN34 (WT), a highly Pil3 piliated variant (Pil3+) and a

37

deletion mutant (∆pil3) to Caco-2 cells at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1, higher Pil3

38

expression levels led to increased bacterial adhesion to Caco-2 cells as compared to the WT

39

while bacterial adherence in the absence of Pil3 was decreased at 6h post-infection. Very similar

40

results were observed in T84 cells (Fig. S2 A). It is worth noting that Sgg strain UCN34, which

41

displays intermediate adherence, is composed of a heterogeneous population

42

approximately 10-20% highly expressing Pil3 pilus (Pil3high) and 80-90% weakly piliated (Pil3low).

43

Taken together, these results indicate that the Pil3 pilus also contributes to Sgg adhesion to

44

human colonic epithelial cells. We next investigated Sgg translocation in these model cell lines.

46

In order to study translocation of Sgg, we first established an in vitro model of polarized cells

47

using human colonic Caco-2 and T84 cell lines (Fig. S1 and S2). In particular, the T84 cell line

48

has been widely used because of its ability to form a tall columnar epithelial monolayer and to

49

develop tight intercellular junctions when grown on a permeable support, with the basolateral

50

surface attached to the support and the apical surface exposed. Both cell lines were cultured on

51

Transwell inserts for 3 to 21 days which allowed their polarization and differentiation. On these

52

filters, fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells expressed well-organized cell-to-cell junctions,

53

forming a cell monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. Integrity of the epithelial

54

barrier was monitored over time using two complementary methods: transepithelial electrical

55

resistance (TER) of the monolayers and permeability to 4 kDa FITC-Dextran molecular ruler

56

(Fig. S1). After 11 days in culture, the Caco-2 and T84 monolayers were already impermeable to

57

the 4 kDa dextran molecules and reached a TER of approximately 300 and 2500 Ω cm2,

58

respectively (Fig. S1). The capacity of Sgg UCN34 to translocate across the impermeable Caco-

59

2 and T84 barriers was assessed at days 7, 14, and 21 and although translocation of UCN34

60

WT increased with cell differentiation (data not shown), day 14 was chosen as the time point

61

giving the most consistent results. In order to demonstrate that bacterial translocation is an

62

active process, cell monolayers were apically infected with Sgg UCN34 by inverting the transwell

63

(lower chamber of the transwell insert) and translocated bacteria were recovered in the upper

64

chamber at 2, 4, and 6 h post- infection (Fig. 2A). The rate of translocation increased over time

65

with a maximum translocation of about 10% in Caco-2 (Fig. 2B) and 12% in T84 monolayers

66

(Fig. S2B) at 6h post-infection. The effect of Sgg on epithelial barrier function was also

67

assessed by measuring the TER following infection. TER values remained stable upon infection

68

and were comparable to non-infected control monolayers, indicating no major disruption of the

69

epithelial barrier by Sgg UCN34 (Fig. S1C and Fig. S2D). In order to visualize bacteria during

70

the translocation process, confocal imaging was carried out on infected Caco-2 cells grown on

71

filters at 6 h post-infection. Caco-2 cells were stained with E-cadherin which localizes at

72

epithelial junctions, actin was stained with phalloidin to visualize the cytoskeleton and bacteria

73

were labeled using a specific polyclonal antibody directed against strain UCN34. During

74

translocation Sgg UCN34 was found primarily close to E-cadherin, at epithelial junctions

75

between adjacent cells (Fig. 2C). These images suggest that UCN34 uses a paracellular route

76

with a transient opening of cell junctions, as suggested by a previous study (3). Cell monolayers

77

were considered well polarized, as demonstrated by the specific accumulation of actin close to

78

the apical membrane of the cells. No intracellular Sgg UCN34 could be detected inside Caco-2

79

cells (data not shown). Thus, these results strongly suggest that Sgg UCN34 is able to

80

translocate epithelial barriers of human intestinal cells through a process involving a transient

81

and subtle opening of tight junctions.

82

Pil3 pilus heterogeneity in Sgg is required for efficient bacterial translocation

83

To gain further mechanistic insights about Sgg translocation across epithelial barriers, we

84

analyzed the possible contribution of the Pil3 pilus in this process. Caco-2 (Fig. 3A) and also

85

T84 (Fig. S2B) monolayers of cells were infected with Sgg UCN34 (WT), a Pil3+ variant and the

86

pil3 mutant for 2, 4, and 6h. WT Sgg was able to translocate these barriers at a rate of 5-10%.

87

In contrast, the otherwise isogenic Pil3+ variant and pil3 mutant were significantly impaired by

88

about 5-fold in this process as compared to WT UCN34. These results demonstrate that: i) the

89

Pil3 pilus is essential for Sgg translocation across intestinal barriers as the ∆pil3 mutant is

90

unable to translocate and more surprisingly ii) that Pil3 pilus heterogeneity is also functionally

91

important since a highly expressing Pil3+ variant cannot translocate these cell monolayers. We

92

hypothesize that increased adherence of the Pil3+ variant at the apical surface of the cells

93

impaired bacterial translocation. Hence, it appears that a delicate balance in Pil3 expression is

94

important for efficient Sgg translocation. To test this hypothesis, we artificially mimicked the

95

expression levels of the Pil3 pilus in the natural Sgg UCN34 population (around 90% of Pil3low

96

and 10% of Pil3high). To achieve this, we mixed the pil3 mutant with PFA killed Pil3+ variant in a

97

proportion of 9:1, respectively. We then infected Caco-2 monolayers with this mixture and

98

observed the capacity of the live pil3 mutant to translocate (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the

99

presence of fixed Pil3+ bacteria allowed the pil3 mutant to cross the Caco-2 monolayer with the

100

same efficiency as Sgg UCN34. These data demonstrate that heterogeneous expression of Pil3

101

in Sgg is crucial for efficient translocation across intestinal barriers. Furthermore, blocking

102

experiments were carried out in this experimental setting using specific antibodies against Pil3

103

(Fig. 3C). First, we showed that the addition of antibodies against both Pil3 subunits impaired

104

translocation of the ∆pil3 mutant in the presence of PFA killed Pil3+ variant cells (Fig. 3C). The

105

Pil3 pilus is composed of a putative tip-located Pil3A adhesin and of a major Pil3B pilin subunit

106

constituting the backbone of the Pil3 filamentous structure. In order to demonstrate the specific

107

role of the Pil3A adhesin in Sgg translocation, antibodies against Pil3A were tested in the same

108

experimental setting and were shown to be sufficient to block translocation of the ∆pil3 mutant

109

with PFA killed Pil3+ cells (Fig. 3D). As a control, we used a similar type of antibody raised

110

against Pil1 that did not prevent translocation of live pil3 mutant cells in the presence of PFA

111

killed Pil3+ bacteria. Altogether, these results demonstrate that heterogeneous expression of the

112

Pil3 pilus in the Sgg UCN34 is critical for its ability to translocate efficiently across tight epithelial

113

barriers, and that the paracellular opening process depends on Pil3A adhesin interaction with

114

one or several as yet unknown host cell receptor(s).

DISCUSSION

117

S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/ Streptococcus

118

equinus complex, a diverse group of streptococci that are commensals of the gut, opportunistic

119

pathogens and used in dairy product fermentation. Sgg is described as a weak colonizer of the

120

the gastrointestinal tract with a fecal carriage of about 2.5 to 15%. It is believed that under

121

certain specific physiological conditions such as development of colon malignancies, Sgg is able

122

to overgrow by benefiting from specific tumoral nutrients and outcompeting closely related

123

microbiota gut commensals (7, 8). This increase in Sgg load and the changes in the gut

124

intestinal barrier resulting from tumor development are suspected to favor Sgg translocation

125

across the tight intestinal barrier, which in turn can lead to invasive infections such as septicemia

126

and infective endocarditis (19, 20).

127

In this work, we investigated the ability of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain UCN34 to

128

translocate across intestinal barriers using Caco-2 and T84, two widely used model cell lines

129

derived from human colon adenocarcinoma. Our results are in perfect agreement with a

130

previous report by Boleij et al. showing that Sgg UCN34 could efficiently translocate across

131

polarized Caco-2 cells while the closely related non-pathogenic S. gallolyticus subsp.

132

macedonicus (Sgm) was not able to do so (3). Since Sgm does not possess any pili, we

133

hypothesized that that the Pil3 pilus could be involved in translocation. Pili have long been

134

considered important players in bacterial attachment to host tissues and their role in

135

translocation across intestinal epithelia was elucidated for GBS (17).

136

Here, we demonstrate that translocation of Sgg UCN34 across polarized intestinal cells is a Pil3-

137

dependent process. Indeed, the ∆pil3 mutant was unable to translocate across Caco-2 and T84

138

monolayers. Expression of Pil3 in WT UCN34 is known to be heterogeneous at the population

139

level, with a majority of cells weakly piliated (90%) and a minority highly piliated (10%).

140

Interestingly we found that a Pil3+ variant homogeneously expressing high levels of Pil3 pilus is

141

unable to translocate intestinal barriers. This result suggested that heterogeneous expression of

142

Pil3 plays a key role in the translocation process. We were able to mimic this heterogeneity in

143

vitro by mixing live ∆pil3 mutant cells with the PFA-killed Pil3+ variant. Both the ∆pil3 and Pil3+

144

variants were unable to translocate the intestinal barrier alone. Strikingly, when combined in a

145

proportion similar to that found in the UCN34 WT population, about 9 ∆pil3 for 1 Pil3+, we found

146

that the presence of Pil3+ variant cells allowed translocation of the ∆pil3 mutant. Based on these

147

results we propose the following model to explain crossing of epithelial junctions by Sgg. Highly

148

piliated Pil3 bacteria in the UCN34 population interact with an unknown cell surface receptor, or

149

a component of the tight junctions, likely through the Pil3A adhesin, activating signaling

150

pathway(s) involved in regulation of epithelial cell junctions. This then leads to opening of cell

151

junctions allowing loosely bound bacteria with low Pil3 levels to pass in between adjacent cells.

152

This translocation occurs without major disruption of the epithelial junctions. As shown for Pil1,

153

this heterogeneity of Pil3 pilus expression can also mitigate host immune responses allowing

154

Sgg to more efficiently evade host intestinal immune defenses in the lamina propria and later in

155

the blood. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the identity of the Pil3A receptor on

156

polarized cell monolayers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

159

Cell cultures and bacterial strains

160

Caco-2 and T84 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM

161

GlutaMAX, pyruvate and 4.5 g/L D-glucose) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal

162

bovine serum (FBS). To obtain polarized Caco-2 and T84 monolayers, cells were trypsinized

163

and seeded on inverted 12 mm polycarbonate, 3 µm-pore, tissue culture inserts (Transwell

164

permeable support, Corning) at a density of 106 cells/cm2. After incubation for 6 h at 37°C,

165

transwell inserts were placed back into the wells and supplemented with fresh media every two

166

days for 14 days. Trans Epithelial Resistance (TER) was measured with an Ohmmeter (Millicell-

167

ERS, Millipore) and paracellular permeability was measured using the nonionic macromolecular

168

tracer FITC-Dextran 4000 Da (Sigma). The cell medium in both compartments was removed.

169

The lower compartment (corresponding to the apical surface of the epithelium) was replaced

170

with RPMI without phenol red (Invitrogen) supplemented with FITC-dextran 4000 (5 mg/ml) and

171

the upper compartment (i.e. basolateral side) with RPMI without phenol red. After incubation for

172

1 h, the upper compartment was sampled and absorbance at 490 nm measured. S. gallolyticus

173

strains were grown at 37°C in Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth in standing filled flasks.

174

Adherence assays

175

Caco-2 and T84 cells were seeded at 3 X 105 cells ml-1 in 24-well plates and incubated at 37°C

176

in 5% CO2 until 100% confluence. Overnight cultures of S. gallolyticus strains were washed

177

once in PBS and resuspended in DMEM medium prior to infecting cells at a MOI of 10 bacteria

178

per cell. Bacteria added to confluent monolayers were centrifuged at 500 RPM 90g to

179

synchronize infections. After 2, 4, 6 h of incubation at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere,

180

monolayers were washed 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria, cells were then lysed in cold

181

water and plated to count cell-associated bacteria. The percentage of adherence was calculated

182

as follows: (CFU on plate count / CFU in inoculum) X100. Assays were performed in triplicate

183

and were repeated in at least 3 independent experiments.

184

Bacterial translocation assays

185

Overnight cultures of S. gallolyticus were washed in PBS and resuspended at 1 x 108 CFU/ml in

186

pre-warmed DMEM. Cell monolayers were washed with DMEM and inverted in 6-well plates. 50

187

µL of Sgg inoculum was then added to the apical side of the cells and incubated for 1h at 37°C

188

in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The transwell inserts were placed back into the corresponding wells

189

and fresh culture media was added to both compartments. At each time point of infection, the

190

medium from the upper compartment was recovered for CFU determination and replaced by

191

fresh media to prevent bacterial planktonic growth. For the preparation of the artificial mixture,

192

Sgg Pil3+ cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min. Following fixation,

193

bacteria were washed 4 times in DMEM. We verified that no CFU could be recovered after this

194

treatment. Live ∆pil3 mutant cells were then added to the PFA killed Pil3+ variant, a ratio of 9:1.

195

For the blocking experiments with antibodies directed against Pil3, a combination of antibodies

196

directed against the C- and N-terminal domains of Pil3A were added to the fixed Pil3+ variant

197

and preincubated for 30 min at room temperature. This mixture was then added to the live ∆pil3

198

mutant for cell monolayer infection as indicated above.

199

Confocal microscopy

200

At 6 h post-infection, cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and then fixed with PFA 4%

201

for 10 min at room temperature. Monolayers were then washed three times with PBS and

202

subsequently quenched with Glycine 0.1M. For confocal microscopy, cells were permeabilized in

203

PBS-Triton-X100 0.2% for 10 min at 4°C. Cell monolayers were then incubated with anti-UCN34

204

polyclonal antibody at a 1:200 dilution (Covalab, France), to specifically label S. gallolyticus,

205

followed by incubation with secondary DyLight-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200).

206

In addition, the adherens junction protein E-cadherin was stained using an anti-E-cadherin

207

HECD-1 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:100 with subsequent incubation with the

208

secondary DyLight594 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:100). Finally, Hoecht 33342 (1:2000)

209

was added to visualize cell nuclei and Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin (1:50) to detect the actin

210

cytoskeleton. Samples were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent and Z-stacks of 300

211

nm step size were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope with a 63x oil objective.

212

Immunofluorescence images were analyzed using the Fiji software.

Fig. 1- Role of Pil3 pilus in the adherence of Sgg UCN34 to human colorectal cancer cells
Caco-2. Adherence is presented as percentage of bacterial inoculum after 4h and 6h at 37°C at
a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacteria per cell. Planktonic growth of the various Sgg strains in
this cell medium was monitored and did not change during the infection period.
Fig. 2- Translocation of Sgg UCN34 across Caco-2 cells. A- Schematic representation of the
infection process using inverted transwell system. The transwell inserts were washed, inverted
and incubated for about 1h to allow bacterial attachment to the cells. Then the inserts were
placed back into a new 6 well plate. At each time point of infection, the medium for the upper
compartment was completely recovered for CFU quantification and replaced by fresh medium.
B- Translocation of Sgg UCN34 across Caco-2 monolayer. Cells were infected for 2, 4 and 6 h
with a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacteria per cell. Translocation values are relative to the
inoculum and represent 5 independent experiments performed in duplicate. C- Visualization of
Sgg UCN34 translocation using confocal microscopy. After 6 h of infection, Caco-2 monolayer
were fixed, permeabilized and stained with a monoclonal antibody against E-cadherin (in red),
A547 conjugated-phalloidin to visualize actin (purple), and Hoescht 33342 to reveal cells nuclei
(cyan). Bacteria were detected with a specific polyclonal antibody raised against the whole
bacterium (green). The upper panels show an YX view of the filter, whereas the lower panels
show an YZ view. The arrows are pointing to UCN34. In the upper panels the scale bar
represents 10 µm and in the yz planes 5 µm. Right panel: representative image from another
independent experiment. The scale bar corresponds to 10 µm.

after 2 h, 4 h and 6 h of infection. B- translocation of a mix of 10:1 ∆pil3 and fixed killed Pil3+ as
compared to WT UCN34 and ∆pil3 alone. C- inhibition of translocation with antibodies against
Pil3. D- inhibition of translocation with specific antibodies directed against Pil3A adhesin but not
with control antibodies directed against Pil1. Results are means  SD from 5 independent
experiments performed in duplicate. Asterisks represent statistical differences relative to WT
strain UCN34 with * p< 0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001 using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
post-test in GraphPad Prism version 5.

monolayer to 4 kDa- FITC fluorescent dextran added in the upper compartment at 5 mg/ml for
1h. B- Measurement of transepithelial resistance (TER) after various days of culture. CMeasurement of the TER at the beginning of infection (NI) and after 6h of infection with Sgg
UCN34. Results are means  SD from 3 independent experiments performed in duplicate.
Fig. S2. Adhesion and translocation of Sgg across T84 epithelial monolayer. Adherence of
UCN34, Pil3+ and ∆pil3 is presented as percentage of bacterial inoculum after 4h and 6h at
37°C at a multiplicity of infection of 10 bacteria per cell. B- UCN34, Pil3+ and ∆pil3 translocation
across T84 monolayer after 2 h, 4 h and 6 h of infection. C- Monitoring of the epithelial integrity
of T84 monolayers by permeability to 4 kDa FITC dextran and measurement of transepithelial
resistance (TER) after various days of culture. D- Measurement of the TER at the beginning of
infection (NI) and after 6h of infection with Sgg UCN34. Results are means  SD from 3
independent experiments performed in duplicate. Note that the transepithelial resistance of T84
cells is 10-fold higher than in Caco-2 cells reaching 3,000 ohms per square centimeter after 11
days of culture.
