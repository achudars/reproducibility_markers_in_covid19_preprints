Abstract
The integrity and organization of animal tissues depends upon specialized protein complexes
that mediate adhesion between cells with each other (cadherin-based adherens junctions), and
with the extracellular matrix (integrin-based focal adhesions). Reconstructing how and when
these cell junctions evolved is central to understanding early tissue evolution in animals. We
examined focal adhesion protein homologs in tissues of the freshwater sponge, Ephydatia
muelleri (phylum Porifera). We found that sponge homologs of focal adhesion proteins coprecipitate as a complex and localize to cell junctions in sponge tissues. These data support
that the adhesion roles of these proteins evolved early, prior to the divergence of sponges and
other animals. However, in contrast to the spatially partitioned distribution of cell junctions in
epithelia of other animals, focal adhesion proteins were found to be co-distributed with the
adherens junction protein Emβ-catenin in sponge tissues; both at certain cell-cell and cellextracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. Sponge adhesion structures were found to be unique in
other ways, too. The basopinacoderm (substrate-attachment epithelium) lacks typical polarity in
that cell-ECM adhesions form on both basal and apical surfaces, and compositionally unique
cell junctions form at the interface between cells with spicules (siliceous skeletal elements) and
between cells and environmental bacteria. These results clarify the diversity, distribution and
molecular composition of cell junctions in tissues of E. muelleri, but raise new questions about
their function and homology with cell junctions in other animals.

Introduction
Beyond simply gluing cells together, cell adhesion molecules are dynamically regulated during
development and cell migration, spatially regulated in polarized tissues, and involved in cell
signaling and mechanotransduction (Collins and Nelson, 2015; Halbleib and Nelson, 2006;
Hynes, 2007, 1992; Kuo, 2013; Pinheiro and Bellaϊche, 2018; Zaman, 2008). Consequently,
myriad adhesion mechanisms have evolved to function in different contexts in animals (e.g.,
(Ebnet, 2017)). Of these, two predominate: 1) the adherens junction, which is involved in cellcell adhesion and is composed of cadherin receptors, p120-, α- and β-catenin, and 2) focal
adhesions, which are involved in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and composed of
protein such as integrins, vinculin, paxillin, talin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).
The molecular components of both the adherens junction and focal adhesions are widely
conserved in animals, and some of their components have origins outside of animals (Dickinson
et al., 2011; Grau-Bové et al., 2017; Grimson et al., 2000; Murray and Zaidel-Bar, 2014; SebéPedrós et al., 2010). However, experimental studies of cell junction composition and function
are largely restricted to bilaterian animals, such as the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and vertebrates. Recent studies demonstrate conserved roles
for adherens junction proteins in cnidarians, as well (Clarke et al., 2019, 2016; Pukhlyakova et
al., n.d.).
Organisms of critical importance for reconstructing early steps in the evolution of animal cell
adhesion mechanisms are the sponges (Porifera). They are one of the most phylogenetically
divergent groups of animals (King and Rokas, 2017; Simion et al., 2017), their anatomy is
fundamentally different from other animals (Leys and Hill, 2012), and there are long-standing
questions about the structure and homology of their tissues compared to epithelia in other
animals (Leys et al., 2009; Tyler, 2003). It has been argued that sponge cell adhesion relies
primarily upon an extracellular proteoglycan complex termed the Aggregation Factor (Bucior and
Burger, 2004; Cauldwell et al., 1973; Grice et al., 2017; Haseley et al., 2001; Henkart et al.,
1973; Humphreys, 1963; Vilanova et al., 2016). Antibodies raised against the Aggregation
Factor have been reported to block reaggregation of dissociated cells (Schütze et al., 2001),
and purified Aggregation Factor can mediate adhesion between beads in cell-free assays
(Jarchow and Burger, 1998). Consequently, the integrity of sponge tissues is thought to depend
upon the interaction of cells with the Aggregation Factor, an ECM component, rather than
through cell junctions like those found in epithelia of other animals (Harwood and Coates, 2004;
Varner, 1995).

The singular importance of the Aggregation Factor has been challenged by sequencing studies
that have revealed conserved homologs of genes encoding adherens junction and focal
adhesion proteins in diverse sponges (Fahey and Degnan, 2010; Nichols et al., 2006;
Srivastava et al., 2010). Moreover, there is mounting experimental evidence that these proteins
have conserved adhesion roles in sponge tissues. In the homoscleromorph sponge Oscarella
pearsei (formerly O. carmela), a homolog of vinculin (common to adherens junction and focal
adhesions in bilaterians) was detected at cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesions, and was found to
interact with actin and talin in vitro (Miller et al., 2018). Also, a yeast two-hybrid screen revealed
conserved interactions between the adherens junction component β-catenin with a classical
cadherin (Nichols et al., 2012a). Likewise, in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri, both a
classical cadherin and α-catenin were detected as co-precipitates of β-catenin (Emβ-catenin),
which localized to actin plaques at cell-cell contacts that resemble adherens junctions (Figure 1)
(Schippers and Nichols, 2018). These data indicate that adherens junction and focal adhesion
proteins may have conserved functions in sponge tissues.

However, the study of Emβ-catenin has also revealed new peculiarities of cell adhesion in
sponges. Cells of the basopinacoderm (the tissue at the interface with the substrate) contain
actin bundles that Max Pavans De Ceccatty (De Ceccatty, 1986) described as “devices for cell-

to-substratum attachment.” If the mechanisms of cell-substrate adhesion in sponges are
conserved with other animals, one might expect that these are integrin-based focal adhesions.
Instead, they were found to stain positive for Emβ-catenin, an adherens junction component
(Schippers and Nichols, 2018).
To better understand the composition and organization of cell junctions in sponge tissues, we
examined the endogenous interactions and distribution of the focal adhesion proteins vinculin
(Vcl), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and integrin-β (ITGB) in E. muelleri. We found that this
species has diverse adhesion structures composed of adherens junction and focal adhesion
proteins, but these proteins are not as strictly partitioned to cell-cell versus cell-ECM junctions
as they are in epithelial tissues of bilaterian animals. Instead, these proteins are often codistributed in both contexts. Moreover, sponge tissues have specialized junctions not found in
other animals; including cell-spicule junctions and cell-bacteria junctions. These data contribute
to an increasingly complex narrative about the ancestral diversity and organization of cell
junctions and their roles in early animal tissue evolution.
Results
BLAST search (Altschul, 2014) of the E. muelleri transcriptome (Peña et al., 2016) revealed
highly conserved homologs of the primary protein components of focal adhesions. We detected
seven integrin-β homologs, six integrin-α homologs, two talin homologs, and one homolog each
of vinculin, focal adhesion kinase, and paxillin (Supplement); integrins were numbered to reflect
their relative expression levels, not to indicate their orthology to integrin subfamilies in other
animals). We characterized the distribution of select focal adhesion proteins in sponge tissues
by immunostaining with custom antibodies against EmVcl, EmFAK and EmITGB1. Each
antibody was validated as specific to its target antigen under non-denaturing conditions
(Supplement). Anti-EmITGB1 was also found to recognize EmITGB2 and EmITGB4. We
subsequently refer to EmITGB generally, rather than EmITGB1 specifically, to reflect this crossreactivity.
Focal Adhesion-like structures may function in substrate attachment.
To determine whether focal adhesion-like structures in the basopinacoderm (Figure 1) are
involved in cell-substrate attachment, it was important to distinguish whether they form at the
interface between the tissue and the substrate (coverslip), or between the tissue and the
mesohyl (ECM-filled interior of the sponge). To test this we used Total Internal Reflection
Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy (Axelrod, 1981; Fish, 2009) and found that junction-associated
stress fibers (Livne and Geiger, 2016) were within 100-200 nm of the coverslip, near the

substrate-adjacent cell membrane (Figure 2a) – consistent with a role in cell-substrate
attachment. We further reasoned that shear forces associated with water flow and turbulence
should lead to an increase in the number of focal adhesion-like structures, as mechanical tissue
stress induces focal adhesion formation in cultured vertebrate cells (Davies et al., 1994). To test
this we grew sponges in dishes on a rocking platform for comparison with sponges grown in
dishes on a stable platform. As shown in Figure 2b, a 43% increase was detected in sponges
grown on a rocking platform (n=12, p-value = 0.0058).

subcellular localization of focal adhesion-like structures in the basopinacoderm. (b) Their abundance was
quantified in individuals grown on a stable surface and compared to individuals grown on a rocking
platform.

Three different types of focal adhesion-like structures in the basopinacoderm
Further examination of stress fiber-like structures in the basopinacoderm revealed three distinct
categories (Figure 3). The first category included the actin filaments detected by TIRF at the
substrate-adjacent cell membrane (Figure 3a), which we termed ‘ventral adhesions’. The
second category resembled ventral adhesions, but with one or both ends terminating at a
membrane invagination or vesicle containing bacteria (Figure 3b). We termed these ‘bacterial
adhesions’. A third category of actin filaments was found to span vertically from the substrateadjacent (ventral) cell membrane to the mesohyl-adjacent (dorsal) cell membrane. These actin
filaments formed prominent plaques on the dorsal surface of the cell (Figure 3c) that we termed
‘dorsal adhesions’.

(a-c) Basopinacocytes (cells of the substrate-attachment epithelium) are drawn at the top in profile view,
with the mesohyl-interface (dorsal surface) at the top and substrate-interface (ventral surface) at the
bottom. Bundles of actin filaments were found at the (a) ventral surface, and (b) were sometimes
associated with membrane invaginations containing bacteria (white arrowheads). Panel (c) shows actin
staining, colored to depict pixel depth within the confocal stack. White arrows indicate dorsal adhesions,
from which actin filaments descend ventrally within cell. (panels a, b: red = actin; cyan = DNA)

Immunostaining of adhesion proteins at these three different categories of focal adhesion-like
structures revealed that they were compositionally distinct. Only EmVcl was found to be
associated with ventral adhesions (Figure 4), whereas both Emβ-catenin and EmVcl were
consistently detected at bacterial adhesions (Figure 5), and only EmITGB was detected at
dorsal adhesions (Figure 6). The staining patterns of EmFAK were inconsistent in the
basopinacoderm, and difficult to discern due to high levels of cytosolic staining. For example,
EmFAK was not usually detected at focal adhesion-like structures (Figures 4-6), except rarely at
bacterial adhesions (Supplement).
Cell junctions at the spicule interface
A unique component of the ECM of many sponges are spicules; siliceous skeletal elements that
form tent pole-like tissue supports. Specialized transport cells attach to spicules and move them
into position (Nakayama et al., 2015) where they are anchored at rosette-shaped clusters of
cells in the basopinacoderm by collagen (Nakayama et al., 2015).

We consistently detected cell junctions at the interface of cells and spicules, which stained
positive for both Emβ-catenin and EmVcl. Again, EmFAK had a low signal-to-noise ratio, making
it difficult to determine if it was present at these structures. EmITGB was not detected (Figure
7). It was unclear if the cells forming these structures were transport cells, basopinacocytes, or
a different cell type altogether.
No evidence for focal adhesion-dependent cell migration
Focal adhesions have well characterized roles in the migration of cultured vertebrate cells,
where they provide traction needed for movement across two-dimensional surfaces. Cell
migration through three-dimensional ECM is often less dependent on integrin-mediated
adhesion (Paluch et al., 2016). Sponges have dense populations of migratory cells in the threedimensional environment of the mesohyl (Supplement), and we previously showed that filopodia
of migratory cells in the sponge O. pearsei stain positive for vinculin (Miller et al., 2018). In
contrast, neither EmVcl, EmFAK nor EmITGB were detected in migratory cells of E. muelleri
(Supplement).

Both Emβ-catenin and focal adhesion proteins are present at cell-cell junctions
We previously reported cortical staining of Emβ-catenin in the basopinacoderm, choanoderm,
and the apical endopinacoderm (the inner tissue layer of the sponge surface; see Figure 1)
(Schippers and Nichols, 2018). As shown in Figure 4a, Emβ-catenin was again detected at the
cell cortex in the basopinacoderm, but we also detected EmVcl (Figure 4b) and less frequently
EmITGB (Supplement). This staining was generally of low intensity and patchy, and we
wondered whether this might reflect the developmental stage of the immature juvenile tissues
examined. To test this we grew sponges for an additional three weeks and found markedly
elevated levels of cortical staining and robust adherens junction-like structures that were EmVclpositive (Supplement).
We detected focal adhesion proteins at cell-cell junctions in other tissues, as well. The most
conspicuous cell-cell junctions in E. muelleri are found in the apical endopinacoderm at points
where actin tracts align between neighboring cells (Figure 1b). Emβ-catenin was previously
detected at these structures (Schippers and Nichols, 2018), and we found that EmVcl, EmFAK
and EmITGB were also constitutively present (Figure 8). Cortical staining of EmITGB was also
detected in an adjacent tissue, the exopinacoderm (Figure 8d) – this is the outermost sponge

tissue and is so close in proximity to the apical endopinacoderm that they cannot be separately
resolved by confocal microscopy.
The detection of EmVcl and EmFAK at cell-cell junctions is not unprecedented. Applied force on
E-cadherin has been shown to lead to phosphorylation of human vinculin at Y822 and
recruitment to the adherens junction (Bays et al., 2014; Mui et al., 2016). However, alignment of
EmVcl to human vinculin revealed low conservation in the region that contains Y822
(Supplement), making it difficult to predict if this mechanism for regulating vinculin function is
conserved in E. muelleri. But, EmVcl was not detected as a co-precipitate of Emβ-catenin
(Schippers and Nichols, 2018), nor did we detect adherens junction proteins as co-precipitates
of EmVcl (Supplement).
Like vinculin, focal adhesion kinase has also been reported to function in contexts other than
focal adhesions, including at the adherens junctions of vascular endothelia, where it directly
binds VE-cadherin and phosphorylates β-catenin in response to VEGF activation (Chen et al.,
2012). However, EmFAK was not detected as a co-precipitate of Emβ-catenin (Schippers and
Nichols, 2018), whereas it did co-precipitate with EmITGB (Supplement). We treated sponges
with 5µM FAK inhibitor 14 and found that this treatment abolished FAK staining at cell-cell

junctions, but detected no other effects on the formation or molecular composition of adhesion
structures in the apical endopinacoderm (Supplement).
The only tissue where we did not find evidence of co-distributed adherens junction- and focal
adhesion-proteins at cell-cell contacts was the choanoderm (Supplement). In this tissue, Emβcatenin alone was detected (Schippers and Nichols, 2018).
Focal adhesion proteins co-precipitate
The localization of both adherens junction and focal adhesion proteins to cell-cell junctions, cellspicule junctions, and bacteria-associated stress fibers raised the question of whether they
interact directly, in ways not characterized from other animals. To test this, we analyzed the
immunoprecipitates of EmVcl, EmITGB, and EmFAK using LC-MS/MS to identify their
endogenous binding partners. EmITGB was found to co-precipitate with EmFAK, EmTalin2,
EmITGA1, EmITGA2, and EmITGA3; all homologs of proteins known to function at integrinbased focal adhesions (Horton et al., 2016). Notably, EmVcl essentially had no co-precipitating
proteins (it was the most abundant protein in the precipitate by nearly two orders of magnitude),
and neither EmVcl nor EmPaxillin (a constitutive focal adhesion component in bilaterian
animals) were detected in EmITGB precipitates.
Discussion
Most animal cell adhesion proteins evolved early, concurrently with or before the transition to
multicellularity (Abedin and King, 2010, 2008; Belahbib et al., 2018; Dickinson et al., 2011;
Fahey and Degnan, 2010; Harwood and Coates, 2004; Nichols et al., 2012b, 2006; SebéPedrós et al., 2010). However, our understanding of how these proteins functioned ancestrally,
and when they were organized into interacting complexes (i.e., cell junctions) is limited. We
examined the interactions and distribution of focal adhesion proteins in tissues of E. muelleri.
We found that they co-precipitate as a complex from cell lysates and that EmVcl, EmFAK and
EmITGB localize to apparent cell junctions, supporting that they have conserved adhesion roles.
However, we also detected a critical difference in the spatial distribution of these proteins in
sponge tissues compared to epithelia in other animals. Rather than being restricted to focal
adhesion-like structures at cell-ECM contacts, they were also detected at adherens junction-like
structures at cell-cell contacts, and were often co-distributed with the adherens junction protein
Emβ-catenin.
In a prior study, we reported a similar anomaly: Emβ-catenin localizes to focal adhesion-like
structures in the basopinacoderm of E. muelleri (Schippers and Nichols, 2018). Here, we found

that these structures can be parsed into structurally and compositionally distinct categories:
ventral, dorsal, and bacterial adhesions. When taken into consideration, we found that Emβcatenin was not actually associated with either ventral or dorsal adhesions. Instead, these
structures respectively stained positive for EmVcl and EmITGB, consistent with their homology
to focal adhesions in bilaterian tissues. The absence of EmITGB staining at EmVcl-positive
adhesions does not necessarily indicate the absence of integrins altogether, as our antibody
recognized only three of seven identified paralogs. In the future, the focal adhesion protein talin
may serve as a more universal marker of integrin-distribution, as it is constitutively present at all
integrin-based adhesions in other animals, and was detected as a co-precipitate of EmITGB
from E. muelleri lysates.
The previously reported Emβ-catenin staining at focal adhesion-like structures in the
basopinacoderm is actually restricted to bacterial adhesions. In this context, Emβ-catenin is codistributed with the focal adhesion protein homologs, EmVcl and (sometimes) EmFAK. The
functional significance of these junctions is unknown, but intriguing. In natural environments,
bacterial biofilms are abundant and often provide settlement cues for the larvae of aquatic
animals, including sponges (Whalan and Webster, 2015). Thus, it seems plausible that bacterial
adhesions could be involved in environmental sensing through integrin-mediated signaling. An
alternative possibility comes from the observation that the bacteria at these structures are
encapsulated in membrane invaginations or vesicles. Most sponge cells are phagocytic
(Wilkinson et al., 1984), and perhaps bacterial adhesions are involved in phagocytosis. This
could be an undescribed mode of feeding, or function in the uptake of intracellular symbionts or
pathogens. There is precedent for such a mechanism in vertebrates, where integrins are known
to be involved in phagocytosis of particles, including microorganisms as part of a pathogen
defense system (Dupuy and Caron, 2008; Underhill and Ozinsky, 2002). A difference is that βcatenin is not detected at these structures in vertebrates.
In the future, it will be interesting to identify the bacterial species at these structures, track their
fate in sponge cells, and test for bacterial adhesions in attached larvae undergoing
metamorphosis. Animals evolved in an environment dominated by bacteria (Alegado and King,
2014), and a compelling hypothesis is that cell adhesion molecules may have first evolved to
mediate interactions with bacteria (Abedin and King, 2008).
A mixture of adherens junction and focal adhesion proteins was also detected in adhesion
contexts other than bacterial adhesions. Specifically, focal adhesion proteins were co-distributed
with Emβ-catenin at cell-spicule junctions, which essentially have the same composition as

bacterial adhesions, and cell-cell junctions. The latter had previously been interpreted as
probable adherens junctions (Schippers and Nichols, 2018), but until the role of focal adhesion
proteins (particularly integrins) at these structures is clarified, this conclusion is less certain.
The co-distribution of Emβ-catenin with EmVcl, EmFAK and EmITGB could indicate that these
proteins are part of a common adhesion complex in sponges tissues, but our
immunoprecipitation results do not support this view. Focal adhesion proteins co-precipitate as a
complex, just as adherens junctions proteins were found to co-precipitate (Schippers and
Nichols, 2018); each to the exclusion of the other. Also, Emβ-catenin alone was detected at cellcell contacts in the choanoderm, and focal adhesion proteins alone were detected at ventral and
dorsal adhesions in the basopinacoderm. This indicates that these protein complexes are
functionally separable and may have discrete roles, even where they are co-distributed.
Full characterization of sponge cell junctions will require further identification of associated
adhesion receptors (e.g., cadherins), and integration of these data with models of Aggregation
Factor-mediated cell adhesion. One clue to how these adhesion systems may interact is that the
Aggregation Factor has reported RGD motifs, leading to the hypothesis that it may activate
integrin signaling (Fernàndez-Busquets et al., 1998; Harwood and Coates, 2004). But, the
Aggregation Factor has predominantly been studied in vitro, in cell dissociation/re-aggregation
assays. Its distribution is not well-characterized in intact tissues.
An important consideration is that, until recently, hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of
animal cell adhesion mechanisms have been inadvertently biased toward bilaterian models. As
we begin to examine cell adhesion in non-bilaterian lineages, there appears to be more
mechanistic diversity than anticipated. For example, the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis has a
conserved classical cadherin/catenin complex (Clarke et al., 2016), but β-catenin is not always
detected at cadherin-positive cell-cell adhesions in tissues (Pukhlyakova et al., n.d.; SalinasSaavedra et al., 2018). Likewise, sequence analyses of ctenophores indicate that they lack
conserved cadherin/β-catenin interaction motifs (Belahbib et al., 2018), and a recent study
indicates that β-catenin is altogether absent at cell-cell contacts in Mnemiopsis leidyi (SalinasSaavedra et al., n.d.). The molecular composition of cell junctions in placozoans is entirely
uncharacterized, but from an ultrastructural perspective they resemble adherens junctions
(Smith and Reese, 2016). Placozoans altogether lack cell-ECM junctions and a basal lamina
(Hynes, 2012). A comprehensive understanding of the timing and sequence of cell junction
assembly and the evolution of epithelia will require detailed studies of adhesion in diverse nonbilaterian tissues.

Conclusions
This study supports that adherens junction and focal adhesion proteins functioned in adhesion
and tissue organization in the last common ancestor of sponges and other animals. This stands
in apparent contrast to studies which have emphasized the Aggregation Factor as the
predominant adhesion mechanism in sponges. Sponge tissues are organized much more like
epithelia in other animals than previously appreciated.
However, in contrast to cell adhesion properties that sponges share in common with other
animals, we also discovered new ways in which they differ. Adherens junction and focal
adhesion proteins are not always spatially partitioned into compositionally distinct cell-cell and
cell-ECM junctions; rather, they are often co-distributed. This complicates narratives about the
origins of these cell junctions and their ancestral roles in tissue organization.
Finally, the discovery of specialized cell-bacteria junctions raises new questions about the
functional significance of these structures for sponge physiology (environmental sensing,
feeding, symbiosis, or pathogen defense), and possibly about the ancestral role of cell adhesion
molecules in animals. It is widely acknowledged that animals evolved in a bacteria-rich
environment. If the interaction of cell adhesion proteins with bacteria is an ancient feature of
animal biology, bacterial adhesions in sponges may provide clues to the nature of these
interactions.
Materials and Methods
Identification of focal adhesion protein homologs in E. muelleri
Representative sequences of the focal adhesion proteins integrin-α, integrin-β, vinculin, talin,
focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were retrieved from Uniprot (UniProt Consortium, 2019) and
used to query the Ephydatia muelleri transcriptome (Peña et al., 2016) by BLAST search
(Altschul, 1990) to identify candidate sponge homologs. The putative domain composition of E.
muelleri sequences was then annotated using HMMER (Finn et al., 2011) and SMART (Letunic
and Bork, 2018) web-servers. E. muelleri vinculin was previously distinguished from its close
paralog α-catenin by phylogenetic analysis (Miller et al., 2018).
Specimens
Ephydatia muelleri gemmules were collected from “upper” Red Rock Lake, Colorado, USA
(40.0802, -105.543) in early October. This lake is several hundred meters southwest of Red

Rock Lake, Boulder County and is unnamed. Gemmules were stored in autoclaved lake water,
in the dark at 4°C. Before plating, gemmules were washed in 1% hydrogen peroxide for 5
minutes, washed three times in autoclaved lake water and grown at room temperature.
Cloning and Recombinant Protein Expression
The coding sequence of target antigens were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from an E. muelleri cDNA library using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Primer
sequences and amplicons are specified in the Supplement (Supplement). PCR products were
cloned into pET28a (Novagen), pET28 His6 Sumo TEV LIC (1S) #29659 or pET His6 GST TEV
LIC (1G) #29655 (Addgene) for expression.
Expression constructs were validated by Sanger Sequencing (Eurofins) and transformed into a
protease deficient Escherichia coli strain (Rosetta 2(DE3), Promega). For expression, a single
colony was grown in Luria Broth at 37 ºC to an OD600 between 0.4-0.6, then induced with 300
mM of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3-5 hours at 30 ºC. Bacterial pellets
were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1X PBS pH 7.4 on ice. Cells were lysed by the
addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), incubation at
room temperature (RT) for 15 min, then sonication for 4 x 30 seconds. Bacterial debris was
removed by centrifugation and the supernatant incubated with either with HisPur Cobalt or
Nickel Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for His-tagged proteins or GST-agarose resin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for GST-tagged proteins, for ~18 h at 4°C on a tube rotator. The resin was
collected by centrifugation, and washed in either 1X PBS pH 7.4 (His-tagged proteins) or 50 mM
Tris, 1M NaCl, pH 8.0 (GST-tagged proteins). After washing, purified recombinant protein was
eluted by the addition of either 150 mM imidazole (His-tagged proteins) or 10 mM reduced
glutathione (GST-tagged proteins).
Antibody Production
Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbit against His-EmVcl, His-EmFAK and GSTEmITGB1 (Syd Labs) recombinant proteins. For affinity purification, two columns were made: 1)
whole E. coli lysates, and 2) 6-10 mg of recombinant protein. Each were covalently bound to 1
mL of AminoLink Plus Coupling resin (Thermo Scientific, Cat#20501) according to manufacturer
specifications. Anti-sera were passed over the E. coli column to remove antibodies against
bacterial proteins, then the flow-through was incubated with the antigen-coupled resin for 1 h at
RT under rotation. This column was washed with 12 mL of AminoLink Wash Buffer and the
antibodies were eluted with 500 µL 0.1 M glycine HCl, pH 2.5. The pH of eluted fractions was
adjusted to neutral by adding 30 µL of 0.75 M Tris-HCL pH 9.0. Antibody titer was quantified by

spectrophotometry (A280) and by visual comparison to BSA standards via sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE). The specificity of each antibody was
validated by Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation coupled with LC-MS/MS, and by pre-adsorption
with the injected antigen prior to immunostaining. Validation details and results are available in
the Supplement.
Western Blot
For each Western Blot, ~100 gemmules were grown in petri dishes with lake water containing
100 µg/mL ampicillin for 6-13 days at RT. Juveniles were scraped with a razor into 4X SDSPAGE reducing loading buffer (1M Tris, pH 7.0, 20% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol
blue and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol), vortexed and boiled at 95ºC for 3 min. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10%-12% gel, and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore)
at 350 mAmp for 30 min. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT in 5% nonfat milk in 1x PBST,
pH 7.4 (0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with affinity purified antibodies (1mg/mL stocks)
against EmVcl (1:3,000), EmFAK (1:1,000) and EmITGB (1:1,500), in blocking solution for 1 h at
RT and washed twice in 1x PBST pH 7.4. After 45 minutes of incubation with the secondary
antibody (Alexa488® Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody; Life Technologies, 1:1000 dilution) at RT,
membranes were washed in 1x PBST pH 7.4 and imaged using the Molecular Imager FX
ProPlus (BioRad).
Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry
Affinity purified antibodies were coupled to agarose A/G using the Pierce Crosslink CoIP Kit
(Thermo Scientific Cat #26147). A control IP was performed using rabbit IgG (I5006, SigmaAldrich). For EmVcl, cell lysates were prepared by combining 1.1 mg of frozen adult tissues with
1.8mL Pierce Lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche, EDTA-free), Aprotinin and Leupeptin (1 mM). Lysates for EmFAK and
EmITGB1 IPs were prepared by scraping ~300 week-old sponges into 1 mL Triton Lysis Buffer
(TLB; 20 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10%
Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, protease Inhibitor cocktail (ROCHE), 1mM
Aprotinin, 1mM Leupeptin). Different tissue sources and lysis buffers were used as the
technique was optimized over the course of the project. Samples were vortexed 15 seconds and
returned to ice for 2 minutes; this was repeated 3 times. Samples were further then
homogenized by hand (Argos Tech. A0001) for 30 seconds, and debris and gemmules were
removed via centrifugation at 13,000 xg for 10 min at 4 ºC. 350 µL of the lysate was diluted with
an additional 200 µL of lysis buffer and combined with the antibody-coupled agarose at 4ºC for
1.5 h. After collecting the flow-through (FT) and completing the washes recommended by the

manufacturer, an extra wash using 1 M LiCl solution was performed to remove any non specific
proteins. Finally, precipitates were eluted with Pierce Low pH Elution Buffer (Cat#21004,
ThermoFisher) and neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl pH 9.0 (Cat#42020208-1, Bioworld). 20-25 µL
aliquots of these precipitates were mixed with 5 µL 4x SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing
freshly added 20% beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), boiled for 3 min, then loaded on a 12% gel for
SDS-PAGE. One gel was used for Coomassie staining, and a replicate was analyzed by
Western blot.
EmVcl precipitates were directly sent for further analysis by LC-MS/MS. EmFAK and EmITGB1
precipitates were excised from an SDS-PAGE gel to separate the precipitate from the co-eluted
antibody. LC-MS/MS was performed by the Proteomics Core Facility, University of California,
Davis for EmVcl and CU- Anschutz Proteomics Core Facility for EmFAK and EmITGB1. Results
were analyzed using the software Scaffold (v3.1).
Immunostaining
E. muelleri juveniles were grown from gemmules for 5-7 days on No. 1.5 uncoated dishes
(MatTEK) or on glass coverslips. Tissues were fixed in 4% Formaldehyde in 95% cold EtOH for
30 min - 1 h at 4ºC. Juveniles were then washed three times with 1x PBS pH 7.6, and incubated
in blocking buffer (3% BSA in 1x PBST pH 7.4) overnight at 4ºC. All antibody preparations were
titrated to determine their optimal working concentration, from 1:250 - 1:5000. After incubation,
samples were washed three times with 1x PBST and then incubated for 45 min with secondary
antibody (Alexa488® Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody; Life Technologies, 1:500 dilution), plus
Alexa Fluor568® Phalloidin (Life Technologies, 1:80) and Hoechst (33342, 1 µg/mL) at RT.
Samples were washed once in 1x PBST and twice in 1x PBS pH 7.6 and preserved for imaging
using anti-fade mounting medium (0.1M Propyl gallate, 1x PBS pH 7.6 and 90% glycerol).
Confocal Images were acquired on an Olympus Fluoview FV3000 confocal laser scanning
microscope using either a 20x/0.85 NA, 60x/1.4 NA or 100x/1.4 NA objectives, and processed
using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012). Neither brightness nor contrast was adjusted in the antibody
channel. Immunostaining results were validated by secondary-only control and by preincubating each antibody with its corresponding antigen for at least 1 h at 4ºC before staining
(Supplement).
Quantification of Focal Adhesion Abundance
Single gemmules (n=12) from E. muelleri were placed in 3 mL of lake water in No. 1.5 uncoated
dishes (MatTEK) and allowed to attach (3 days). After attachment half were transferred to a
rocking platform for 24 hours, while the others were left on a steady surface. All individuals were

fixed and stained with anti-EmVcl and phalloidin, and the basopinacoderm imaged as described.
Focal adhesion-like structures were counted in each of three image stacks per individual and
their abundance in each treatment was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with single factor of
treatment in R studio (RStudio Team, 2015).
Pharmacological inhibition of FAK
Five day-old-juveniles were treated with 5 µM FAK Inhibitor 14 (Sigma-Aldrich) for four hours at
RT in the dark. Treatment was removed and tissues were immediately fixed, immunostained,
and imaged as described. The effects of FAK inhibition on cell motility are described in the
Supplement.
