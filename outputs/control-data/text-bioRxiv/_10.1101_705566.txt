Abstract

26

Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) performing bacteria self-assemble into compact

27

biofilms by expressing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Anammox EPS are poorly

28

characterized, largely due to their low solubility in typical aqueous solvents. Pronase digestion

29

achieved 19.5 ± 0.9 and 41.4 ± 1.4% (w/w) more solubilization of Candidatus Brocadia sinica-

30

enriched anammox granules than DNase and amylase respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance

31

profiling of the granules confirmed that proteins were dominant. We applied ionic liquid (IL)

32

1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate and N,N- dimethylacetamide (EMIM-Ac/DMAc)

33

mixture to extract the major structural proteins. Further treatment by anion exchange

34

chromatography isolated homologous S/T-rich proteins BROSI_A1236 and UZ01_01563,

35

which were major components of the extracted proteins and sequentially highly similar to

36

putative anammox surface-layer (S-layer) protein KUSTD1514. EMIM-Ac/DMAc extraction

37

enriched for these putative S-layer proteins against all other major proteins, along with six

38

monosaccharides (i.e. arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, fucose, galactose and mannose). The

39

sugars, however, contributed <0.5% (w/w) of total granular biomass, and were likely co-

40

enriched as glycoprotein appendages. This study demonstrates that S-layer proteins are major

41

constituents of anammox biofilms and can be isolated from the matrix using an ionic liquid-

42

based solvent.

Introduction

45

Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), whereby ammonium is anaerobically oxidized

46

directly to nitrogen gas with nitrite as electron acceptor, contributes up to 80% of oceanic N

47

losses1, and when coupled with partial nitrification is a more sustainable option for N removal

48

from waste waters than conventional processes2. Anammox has been researched intensively

over several decades across different natural environments as well as more than 100 full-scale

50

wastewater treatment plants3. Nineteen anammox species have been identified so far with all

51

belonging to the Planctomycetes phylum4. Each species, regardless of habitat, self-assembles

52

through extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) expression, into either supported biofilms or

53

granules5. Biofilm existence allows anammox bacteria to form syntrophic relationships with

54

other bacteria (e.g. ammonium oxidizing bacteria)6 and enhances sludge retention. EPS can also

55

increase microbial tolerances to a range of environmental stresses, such as shear, oxidative and

56

salinity stress7.

57

EPS have key roles in anammox biofilms. Little is known about the structure and function of

58

specific EPS in water and wastewater biofilms8. Research into anammox EPS has largely

59

focused on general classes of molecules9, for example changes in total protein or sugar content

60

in response to environmental conditions like shear10 and salinity stress11,

61

characterizations have revealed the spatial distribution of proteins, polysaccharides and cells in

62

anammox sludges. For example, loose protein secondary structure in anammox EPS has been

63

shown to expose large amounts of hydrophobic amino acid groups for hydrophobic interactions

64

that effectively mediate anammox EPS aggregation13. Similarly, a β-sheet structure of

65

extracellular proteins in anammox granules was found to maintain the function of inner

66

hydrophobic groups, while uronic acids further support the biofilm matrix and prevent cell

67

detachment14. Nonetheless, the precise identities and compositions of anammox EPS remain

68

undescribed.

69

Identifying key biopolymers within anammox EPS has always been a major challenge due to

70

their poor solubility in conventional, typically aqueous, extraction solvents. In addition, a

71

variety of anammox biofilm morphologies, including homogeneously-distributed15, 16, stratified

72

granules17-20, flocs21 and surface-attached22 structures further confound the extraction and

73

characterization of anammox EPS. Numerous attempts to extract anammox EPS through either

74

cationic exchange resin (CER)23, physical methods such as centrifugation, heating and

75

sonication or chemical methods by using organic solvents (detergents and ethanol), have been

76

made. However, to date no exopolymer has been isolated from the matrix of anammox biofilms,

77

which is a minimum requirement for subsequent biophysical and functional analysis.

78

While some metabolic proteins are conserved between anammox species (e.g. the c-type heme

79

proteins)24, it is unknown whether any extracellular proteins are similarly conserved. It has been

80

reported that surface layer (S-layer) proteins may be common to anammox biofilms as a

81

structural component of the cell. For example, KUSTD1514 forms a shell on the outside of the

82

cell envelope of Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartsiensis25, while a homologous S-layer protein is a major

83

EPS constituent of Ca. Brocadia-enriched granular biofilm and hypothesized to also contribute

84

to biofilm matrix structure (i.e. following shedding)26. S-layer proteins could be important to

85

biofilm formation more broadly27. Describing a function for S-layer proteins in biofilm

86

formation is confounded by the fact that they are embedded in EPS and the S-layer protein has

87

not been isolated from the anammox biofilm matrix.

88

To address the challenge of processing anammox EPS, we used ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl

89

imidazolium acetate (EMIM-Ac) to dissolve a laboratory anammox granular biofilm.

90

Imidazolium-based ionic liquids are green solvents that have also been applied to process

91

similarly recalcitrant biopolymers (e.g. cellulose and chitosan)28, as protein stabilizers and co-

92

solvents, and enzyme catalysts. We extracted and purified the putative S-layer protein from a

93

laboratory anammox granular biofilm. We found a putative S-layer protein to be the dominant

94

polymer in our biofilm extract. While six monosaccharides were co-enriched with the EPS, they

95

contributed <0.5% (w/w) of total granular biomass and were all common protein o-

96

glycosylating sugars. It is thus likely that they were enriched as glycoprotein appendages rather

97

than free exopolysaccharides. We provide further support for an important role for S-layer

98

proteins in anammox biofilms, and present a method, involving EMIM-Ac, that allows for S-

Anammox granular sludge enrichment

107

Anammox granular sludges (GR) were cultivated in a 4 L reactor seeded with activated sludge

108

from a full-scale water reclamation plant (WRP) in Singapore and fed a synthetic medium

109

consisting of (g/L): KHCO3 1.25, KH2PO4 0.025, CaCl2∙6H2O 0.3, MgSO4∙7H2O 0.2 and

110

FeSO4∙7H2O 0.025. More details on laboratory anammox granules enrichment are provided in

111

the Supporting Information (SI).

112

Granules were extracted from the reactor immediately prior to the settle and decant phase,

Enzymatic treatment of granules

117

Granules (GR) were digested by Pronase E, DNase A, and α and β amylase (Sigma Aldrich,

118

Singapore), either independently or in sequence. 2 mg/mL of each enzyme was applied to 10

119

mg/mL biofilm in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. An incubation time of 2 h was applied for all the

120

treatments at 37C (for Pronase E and DNase A) and 60C (for α and β amylase). Pronase E

prepared in 0.1 M Tris, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0 while α and β amylase (25 µL/mL

123

and 2.5 µL/mL) were prepared in 16 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6. After digestion, the

124

supernatant was removed and the residual solids washed three times with double distilled water.

125

Total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according to

126

the APHA standard method29. TSS and VSS solubilization percentages were calculated as the

127

percentage difference in TSS and VSS respectively before and after enzymatic treatment.

Anion exchange column

171

IL-EPS was dissolved in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and passed through 0.2 μm filter prior to being

172

passed through purified anion exchange column connected to Amersham Akta fast protein

173

liquid chromatography (FPLC). The IL-EPS mixture was loaded onto a Source15Q column pre-

(Invitrogen™). The electrophoresis was carried out at 180 V in NuPAGE MES SDS running

185

buffer (50 mM Tris base, 50 mM MES, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM EDTA. pH 7.3) for 40 min.

186

After electrophoresis the gel was removed from the cassette, washed multiple times with double

187

distilled water and stained with Coomassie Blue (1g Coomassie Brilliant Blue in methanol

194

200 and 170 kDa bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to reduction,

195

alkylation and in-gel tryptic digestion as described by Shevchenko et al.31. Following digestion,

196

the peptides were eluted with 1:1 (v/v) water/acetonitrile (ACN) solution with 0.2% (v/v) TFA

197

into a microtiter receiver plate by vacuum and then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation

198

(miVac, SP Scientific).

199

Peptide analysis was performed by LCMS-TripleTOF 5600 (refer to Supporting Information

200

for details). Peptides were identified using ProteinPilot 5.0 software Revision 4769 (AB

201

SCIEX) with the Paragon database search algorithm (5.0.0.0.4767) and the integrated false

202

discovery rate (FDR) analysis function. These protein data were searched against a protein

203

reference database of translated predicted genes from metagenome assemblies constructed from

204

previously sampled reactor gDNA. The metagenome contained a recovered complete genome

205

of Ca. Brocadia32 and also included five extant draft AnAOB genomes, enabling comparative

206

analysis.

211

protein33, in a three-month immunization protocol consisting of four injections on days 0, 30,

212

50 and 80 (SABio, Singapore). The serum was collected and affinity purified from rabbit

213

antiserum. Total IgG fractions (crude serum) of one rabbit were used as primary anti-

214

BROSI_A1236 antibody. Refer to Figure S1 for Dot Blot analysis of the rabbit sera binding to

218

Proteins were transferred from the SDS-PAGE gel to a membrane using iBlot transfer system

219

(Invitrogen™). The polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was blocked with PBS-T

220

(137 mM NaCl, 12 mM PO43-, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.05% Tween®20, pH 7.4) and 5% (w/v) bovine

221

serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 22°C. The primary antibody was then diluted 3000 times in

222

blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at 22°C. PVDF membrane was washed three times with

223

PBS-T for 10 min before incubating with Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody,

224

HRP (ThermoFisher Scientific) diluted 5000 times in blocking buffer for 1 h at 22°C in the

225

dark. After incubation, the membrane was washed five times for 15 min with PBS-T. For

226

immune detection, the blot was then developed in 1:1 (v/v) dilution of SuperSignal™ West

227

Femto Trial Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) to achieve the desired signal intensity in the

228

Amersham HypercassetteTM Autoradiography Cassettes.

229

X-ray film (CARESTREAM Medical X-ray Green/MXG Film) was exposed to the blot in the

230

cassette from 2 s to 10 min, depending on the intensity of the signal. The film was then inserted

231

into an auto processor provided by Abnova for film development.

233

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis with fluorescence detector

234

SEC was performed using (i) a liquid chromatograph with pump (LC-20AD), (ii) a fluorescence

235

detector (RF-20AXS), (iii) an auto sampler (SIL-20AHT), and (iv) a communication module

236

(CMB-20A). The molecular weights (MW) of the EPS samples were estimated by passing 15

237

μL of the filtered samples through an analytical scale SEC column (OHpak SB-804 HQ)

238

following its guard column (OHpak SB-G). Tris buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.0 ± 0.1) was used

239

as the mobile phase. The SEC column was calibrated using transferrin, serum albumin bovine,

240

myoglobin and beta amylase obtained from Sigma Aldrich (the details are provided in

Global protein analysis of Ca. B. sinica-enriched granules

244

Protein extraction was performed as previously described34. Briefly, lyophilized anammox

245

granules were resuspended in extraction buffer and cells were lysed by bead beading. Cell

246

debris was removed, and extracted proteins were precipitated overnight using trichloroacetic

247

acid (TCA). Pellets were washed three times in 100% ice-cold acetone, dried, and resuspended

248

in 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). Protein concentration for each sample was estimated in a single

249

technical replicate using the Qubit Protein Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer

250

(Invitrogen).

251

Protein samples were then subjected to preparative denaturing SDS-PAGE (refer to Supporting

252

Information). Gels were Coomassie-stained (Bio-Safe Coomassie Stain, Bio-Rad) and the

253

protein bands (1 x 1 x 0.08 cm) excised and subjected to reduction, alkylation and in-gel tryptic

254

digestion, as described elsewhere31. Following digestion, peptides were recovered, dried and

255

reconstituted in 5% formic acid prior to desalting and clean-up using StageTips35, 36 prepared

256

as previously described37 with the modification that an additional layer of PorosOligo R2

257

material (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was added on top of the PorosOligo R3

258

material. Following purification, peptides were eluted using 66% (v/v) ACN, dried using

259

vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 0.1% (v/v) TFA/2% (v/v) ACN solution.

260

Peptides were subsequently analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography

261

(UHPLC) using an Easy-nLC1200 (Thermo Scientific) online system coupled to a Q Exactive

262

High Field mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) (refer to Supporting Information for

263

264

1.6.3.4. Each experiment was defined as its own parameter group. The label-free quantification

265

(LFQ) and the intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) features were enabled, and LFQ

reactor enriched with Ca. B. sinica had a higher VSS content of 88% compared to industrial

285

granules39. All enzymes achieved a higher degree of solubilization of the organic fraction

286

relative to total biofilm, as indicated by low and high reductions in TSS and VSS respectively,

287

following enzymatic digestions. This is likely due to the presence of inorganic minerals, which

288

are common features of anammox biofilms (e.g. apatite)40. Digestion with pronase achieved a

289

higher degree of solubilization than either DNase A, α and β amylase or the control (i.e. heating

290

only at 60 °C). A similar amount of VSS and TSS solubilization was observed in the control

sample as for α- and β- amylase-treated granules (i.e. same buffers and heated to the same

292

temperature). Thus, neither α- or β-sugars contributes to the structure of the anammox EPS.

293

Furthermore, high EPS solubilization is consistently achieved for granules treated with pronase,

294

either by itself or coupled with DNase A, α- or β-amylase. This suggests that proteins are

295

important structural components of the Ca. B. sinica-enriched anammox EPS matrix.

The heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum of acid-digested

consistent with the anomeric region of polysaccharides41 (δH and δC are the 1H and 13C chemical

like exopolysaccharides)42. Another explanation could be that glycoproteins are a component

of the anammox biofilm EPS. Nonetheless, the spectrum is dominated by HSQC cross peaks at

315

(δH, δC) of (4.2-4.8, 45.6-67.5), (7.2-7.6, 119.1-131.7) and (8.5-8.7, 130.7-136.7), which

represent amino acid α-regions and aromatics, and histidines, respectively, further supporting

our finding that proteins dominate Ca. B. sinica-enriched granules43, 44.

Ionic liquid-based EPS extraction

320

We therefore aimed to extract structural proteins from the Ca. B. sinica-enriched granules, and

321

used ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate (EMIM-Ac) for this purpose given its

322

demonstrated ability to dissolve recalcitrant polymers. The recovery yields of representative

323

biofilm exopolymers (i.e. basic and acidic proteins, anionic, cationic and neutral

324

polysaccharides) following dissolution in 40:60 (v/v) EMIM-Ac/DMAc with recovery by

325

ethanol precipitation (i.e. anti-solvent), were determined (Figure S3). Recovery yields of 54.1

326

± 9.0 and 23.2 ± 8.7% (w/w) for basic and acidic proteins (i.e. cytochrome C and lipase)

327

respectively were achieved following EMIM-Ac/DMAc solubilization and ethanol

328

precipitation. EMIM-Ac/DMAc dissolution with ethanol precipitation is therefore a viable

329

strategy for recovering extracellular proteins from anammox biofilms. Further, EMIM-

330

Ac/DMAc coupled with ethanol as anti-solvent recovered neutral and cationic polysaccharides

331

(i.e. cellulose and chitosan), consistent with what has been described in the literature45.

332

Anammox granules dissolved in EMIM-Ac/DMAc at 55°C (16 h) separated into two phases;

333

an insoluble granular phase (IGS), and an ionic liquid soluble phase (IL-S) (Figure 1). The

334

recovery yield following EMIM-Ac/DMAc solubilization and ethanol precipitation and dialysis

335

was 8.2 ± 2.0 % (w/w). The recovered fraction subsequently separated during dialysis into a

336

water soluble fraction (IL-EPS) and a water insoluble gel (IL-GEL).

Ionic liquid treatment increases the permeability of, but does not fluidize, Ca. B. sinica

339

cells

340

Ionic liquids are known to kill cells, which is believed to be due to osmotic shocking of cell

341

membranes46. Live-dead stain of the anammox biofilms indicated both live and dead cells, even

342

in the non-treated component (Figure 3A). Relative to the control, EMIM-Ac/DMAc treatment

343

disrupted aggregate organization such that clusters of dead cells dominated and were less evenly

344

distributed (Figure 3B). Nonetheless, there were also live and dead cells and the loss of order

345

in how the cells are arranged could indicate that the EPS has been extracted.

346

Planctomycetes are Gram-negative bacteria with an outer membrane that contains eukaryotic-

347

like phospholipids in the inner leaflet47. To investigate whether increased permeability was due

348

to membrane fluidization, we used

349

released into EMIM-Ac/DMAc upon dissolution. The phospholipid standard (i.e. asolectin

350

from soybean) displayed a range of sharp spectral peaks at δP -3 – 0 ppm, consistent with

351

diesterified phosphates (Figure 3C, blue), demonstrating that phospholipids dissolved in

352

EMIM-Ac/DMAc can be detected by 31P NMR. In contrast, no 31P NMR peaks were observed

353

in the spectrum of EMIM-Ac/DMAc following anammox biofilm dissolution (IL-S) (Figure

354

3C, green) apart from the reference phosphate peak (i.e. H3PO4) seen at δP 0 ppm. To support

355

the hypothesis that cell lysis can be detected by

356

Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells treated with lysozyme showed several sharp spectral peaks in

357

the monoesterified and disesterified phosphate region (Figure 3C, red). The signal observed at

δP 0 ppm in every sample arose from the 7.5 mM H3PO4 standard, where the neat H3PO4 31P

Co-enrichment of surface layer (S-layer) glycoprotein with commonly o-glycosylating

422

monosaccharides

423

The AEC-purified proteins (EPI) extracted from Ca. B. sinica-enriched granules by EMIM-

424

Ac/DMAc were analyzed by MS/MS and the identified polypeptide fragments mapped against

425

a database for all bacteria. Two hypothetical proteins dominated, BROSI_A1236 and

426

UZ01_01563, that were identical with the exception that BROSI_A1236 has an additional 247

427

amino acids at the N-terminus49. We henceforth refer to them as BROSI_A1236. Immunoblot

428

analysis of the isolated protein, using antibodies raised against amino acids 742-753 of

429

BROSI_A1236, further validated its identity as BROSI_A1236 (Figure 4C; Figure 1). It is

430

highly similar to putative S-layer protein KUSTD1514 (e-value: 0, protein 44%)50. The most

431

highly similar abundant proteins in terms of iBAQ (i.e. > 5% abundance) in Ca. B. sinica-

432

enriched granules (GR) and the EMIM-Ac extract (IL-EPS) are presented in Figure 5A, with

433

the BROSI_A1236 being the most abundant protein in the EPS prior to AEC purification (i.e.

434

extracted directly by ionic liquid and recovered by ethanol, IL-EPS). There was a two-fold

435

enrichment of BROSI_A1236 following extraction by EMIM-Ac relative to the crude granules,

436

to almost 40% abundance. It is likely, however, that the true abundance of BROSI_A1236

437

following EMIM-Ac/DMAc extraction was even higher given that mass spectrometry

438

underestimates glycoprotein content due to inhibition of trypsin digestion by the sugars51.

439

Hence, EMIM-Ac/DMAc extraction followed by ethanol recovery leads to a high enrichment

440

of a putative S-layer glycoprotein from the extracellular matrix of the anammox granules.

441

The anammox biofilm contains sugars, as demonstrated by the HSQC NMR spectrum of acid-

442

digested IL extracted anammox EPS (IL-EPS) (Figure 2B). The concentrations of

443

monosaccharides commonly associated with either exopolysaccharides or glycoproteins were

444

measured, and the eight most abundant monosaccharides present in crude anammox biofilms

445

(GR) and in the EMIM-Ac/DMAc soluble material (IL-EPS) are presented in Figure 5B. The

446

fraction of all sugars in the anammox biofilm was 0.45% (w/w), increasing to 1.3% (w/w) in

447

the EMIM-Ac/DMAc extract (IL-EPS). Thus, sugars constitute only a small fraction of the dry

448

weight of the Ca. B. sinica-enriched granule (GR), providing further evidence of the importance

449

of proteins in the granule structure. An approximately three-fold increase was observed for all

450

sugars except glucose and ribose, concomitant with a two-fold increase in glycoprotein

451

BROSI_A1236 (EPI). BROSI_A1236 (EPI) is enriched in serine and threonine (11.8 and 16.0%

452

respectively), which are the most commonly o-glycosylated52 amino acids. Given that

453

arabinose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, mannose and galactose are co-enriched with

454

BROSI_A1236 (IL-EPS) in the extracted protein versus the crude anammox biofilm (GR), it is

455

probable that they are appended to the putative S-layer glycoprotein BROSI_A1236.

456

Two protein bands and GPC peaks were observed from the SDS-PAGE gel and gel permeation

457

chromatogram respectively of the AEC purified fractions (EPI F6 & F7). The high MW peak

458

dominated in EPI F6 from AEC and the low MW peak dominated in EPI F7. These confirm the

459

existence of two structurally similar glycoproteins (i.e. BROSI_A1236 and UZ01_01563), or

460

reflect the different proteoforms of a single protein (e.g. in different glycosylation states).

Discussion

475

We observed that proteins are key structural components of Ca. B. sinica-enriched biofilms and

476

demonstrated a means to extract and concentrate a putative S-layer glycoprotein using ionic

477

liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate (EMIM-Ac), which allowed for its subsequent

478

isolation and identification. It is very similar to putative surface layer proteins KUESTD1514

479

from Ca. K. stuttgartsiensis anammox sludge and also to WP_070066019.1 from Ca. Brocadia

480

sapporiensis sludges53. Furthermore, while sugars were only minor components of the Ca. B.

481

sinica-enriched biofilm, they were co-enriched along with the glycoprotein and thus likely exist

482

in the biofilm predominately attached to proteins rather than as free polysaccharides.

483

While S-layers have been postulated to promote biofilm formation, as for Tannerella forsythia,

484

the mechanism by which they achieve this is unknown. S-layers may appear as crystalline

485

structures in the matrix as a result of cell-surface shedding26. However, it is not clear how

486

crystalline structures might support biofilm formation. The means to extract and subsequently

487

S-layer glycoproteins from biofilm matrices, as described here, will enable methods to be

488

applied to describe the mechanism by which they contribute to the growth of other biofilms.

489

Interestingly, part of the ethanol recovered IL-soluble fraction (IL-S) also formed a gel (IL-

490

GEL) during dialysis. It is therefore possible that, in addition to performing role as a S-layer

491

protein, Brosi_A1236 could also contribute to biofilm formation by undergoing phase

492

separation to a gel. One possible mechanism by which the putative S-layer protein contributes

493

to anammox biofilm could therefore be that it mediates phase separation of the matrix into gels.

494

This could further inform the role of S-layer protein in anammox biofilms, but possibly in

495

biofilms more broadly.

496
497

To date, the only reported method of S-layer protein extraction from anammox biofilms was

498

physical extraction by means of Potter homogenizer, which is known to disrupt cells25.

499

Chaotropes such as lithium chloride (LiCl)54 or guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl)55 are

500

typically used in S-layer protein extractions. LiCl is believed to solubilize S-layer proteins in

501

gram positive bacteria by disrupting the hydrogen bond between protein and secondary cell

502

wall polysaccharides. Such treatments have not been demonstrated for biofilm and EPS

503

solubilization and hence are not likely to be effective at facilitating the isolation of S-layer

22

504

proteins from extracellular matrices. Ionic liquids can isolate S-layer proteins from biofilm

505

matrices because they are equally effective at solubilizing proteins as they are for recalcitrant

506

polysaccharides like cellulose. Furthermore, they achieve this by disrupting intermolecular

507

hydrogen bonds and increasing solvent order without destabilizing the solute or protein.

508

Similar to LiCl and GnHCl, interactions between the cation and anion of ionic liquids (like

509

EMIM-Ac) have chaotropic effects on the protein and kosmotropic effect on the solvent56. The

510

exception to this is cytochrome c, where Fujita et al.57 found that ionic liquid had a kosmotropic

511

effect leading to its solubilization. Nonetheless, ionic liquids are good options for isolating

512

extracellular proteins where it is important to preserve their tertiary structure, as would be

513

required to describe the mechanism of the role of S-layer protein in biofilm formation, i.e. to

514

describe their biophysical properties and roles in biofilms, higher order structures and how they

515

interact with cells, other exopolymers and their environment. In addition, ionic liquid EPS

516

extraction was also found here to cause minimal cell disruption as shown by the absence of the

517

phosphate signal in the 31P NMR analysis of the ionic liquid EPS extract supernatant (IL-S).

518
519

Similarly, the means to solubilize EPS enables a range of approaches to be applied for assigning

520

function, not least of all accurate quantification, but also immunofluorescence microscopy58,

521

single molecular structural (e.g. circular dichroism)59 and biophysical (e.g. optical tweezing)60

522

analyses. Global quantitative profiling of anammox EPS components has also been applied

523

widely to correlate EPS with certain process parameters, such as salinity resistance61, settling

524

performance62 and preservation techniques63. However, most studies assume that the key EPS

525

are solubilized, which is challenging for the notoriously recalcitrant anammox EPS. Thus,

526

isolating, non-destructively, extracellular polymers from the biofilm will lead to an improved

527

understanding of their function in the anammox biofilm.

529

We illustrate with this study a non-destructive means to extract extracellular polymers from

530

anammox granules. Additionally, this allows for the subsequent isolation of an S-layer

531

glycoprotein, by anion exchange chromatography, which will enable more detailed structural

532

and functional characterization of a putative S-layer protein from a complex, ecologically and

533

industrially important biofilm.
