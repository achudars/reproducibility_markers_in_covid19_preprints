Abstract

11

Assessing chromatin profiles at single-cell resolution is now feasible thanks to recently published

12

experimental methods such as single cell chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing

13

(scChIP-seq) (Grosselin et al., 2019; Rotem et al., 2015) and single-cell assay for transposase-

14

accessibility chromatin (scATAC-seq) (Buenrostro et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; Cusanovich et al.,

15

2015; Lareau et al., 2019). With these methods, we can detect the heterogeneity of epigenomic

16

profiles within complex biological samples. Yet, existing tools used to analyze bulk epigenomic

17

experiments are not fit for the low coverage and sparsity of single-cell epigenomic datasets. Here,

18

we present ChromSCape: a user-friendly Shiny/R application that processes single-cell epigenomic

19

data to help the biological interpretation of epigenomic landscapes within cell populations. The user

20

can identify different sub-populations within heterogeneous samples, find differentially enriched

21

regions between subpopulations and identify associated genes and pathways. ChromSCape accepts

22

multiple samples to allow comparisons of cell populations between and within samples.

23

ChromSCape source code is written in Shiny/R, works as a stand-alone application and is freely

24

downloadable at https://github.com/vallotlab/ChromSCape. Here, using ChromSCape on multiple

Introduction

32

Epigenetic landscape defined by histone modifications is driving chromatin folding and genes

33

accessibility to transcription machineries. The recent development of single-cell methods to study

34

the epigenome enables the appreciation of the heterogeneity of chromatin features within a

35

population, which cannot be assessed using bulk ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq method. Such methods

36

include scChIP-seq (Grosselin et al., 2019; Rotem et al., 2015), scChIL-seq (Harada et al., 2019),

37

scChIC-seq (Ku et al., 2019) and scCUT&Tag (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) which identify genomic

38

regions enriched for repressive or active histone marks (H3K27me3, H3K4me3, ...) and scATAC-

39

seq (Chen et al., 2018; Cusanovich et al., 2015; Lareau et al., 2019) which assesses regions of open

40

chromatin. There are existing tools publicly available to analyze scATAC-seq such as chromVar

41

(Schep et al., 2017), Cicero (Pliner et al., 2018) or Scasat (Baker et al., 2019). However these tools

42

are dedicated to scATAC-seq and are not stand-alone applications, thus requiring some scripting

43

skills. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any stand-alone analytic tool destined to

44

comprehensively analyze region-based scChIP-seq count data. With ChromSCape, we propose a

45

user-friendly, step-by-step and customizable Shiny application to analyze sparse single-cell

46

chromatin profiling datasets. The pipeline is designed for high-throughput single-cell datasets with

47

samples containing as low as 100 cells and with a minimum of 1000 reads per cell. The interactive

48

process includes filtering out cells with low coverage and regions with low cell count,

49

dimensionality reduction by PCA, classifying cells in an unsupervised manner to identify sub-

50

populations and find biologically relevant loci differentially enriched in each sub-populations. To

51

overcome the sparsity of matrices due to the current technical limitations of these technologies,

52

reads mapped to the genome must be binned prior to the use of ChromSCape into successive bins of

53

the genome. These bins range from 5,000bp (recommendation for H3K4me3 scChIP-seq datasets)

54

up to 50,000bp (recommendation for H3K27me3 scChIP-seq datasets), depending on the

55

modification studied, to increase signal with a resolution trade-off.

56
57

Implementation

58

ChromSCape is developed in Shiny/R employing various Shiny related packages (shinyjs,

59

shinydashboard, shinyDirectoryInput) for the user interface. The application takes advantage of

60

public R libraries for data vizualisation (RcolorBrewer, colorRamps, Rtsne, colourpicker,

61

kableExtra, knitr, viridis, ggplot2, gplots, png, grid, gridExtra, DT) as well as for data manipulation

62

(tibble, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, irlba, reshape2, splitstackshape, rlist). Some available bioinformatics

63

packages are used for manipulation of single-cell data (scater (McCarthy et al., 2017), scran (Lun

64

ATL and JC, 2016)), manipulation of genomic regions (IRanges and GRanges (Lawrence et al.,

65

2013)) and for clustering of cells (ConsensusClusterPlus (Wilkerson et al., 2010)). Some custom

66

functions are embedded in the application under the ‘Modules’ directory and serve for both

Methods

73

ChromSCape consists of multiple filtering and processing steps, saving files on a user specified

74

directory at each step. When the user relaunches ChromSCape and selects a saved analysis, the

75

application automatically reloads the data and recomputes all the plots. This enables users to try

76

various filtering and clustering parameters, visualize the data in reduced dimensional space and

77

choose the most appropriate set of parameters for their analysis.

78
79

Quality Control and Normalization

80

ChromSCape takes as input one or multiple count matrices with genomic regions in rows and cells

81

in columns. Each input matrix should have the same regions as rows to allow merging of the

82

different matrices. An example matrix is available on the GitHub repository; guidelines given

83

within the application allow users to understand the requirements for input formating. In order to

84

efficiently remove outlier cells from the analysis, e.g. cells with excessively high or low coverage,

85

the user sets a threshold on a minimum read count per cell and the upper percentile of cells to

86

remove. The latter could correspond to doublets, e.g. two cells in one droplet, while lowly covered

87

cells are not informative enough or may correspond to barcodes ligated to contaminant DNA or

88

library artifacts. Regions not supported by a minimum user-defined percentage of cells that have a

89

coverage greater than 1,000 reads are filtered. Defaults parameters were chosen based on the

90

analysis of multiple scChIP-seq datasets from our previous study (Grosselin et al., 2019): a

91

minimum coverage of 1,600 unique reads per cell, filtering out the cells with the top 5% coverage

92

and keeping regions detected in at least 1 % of cells. Post quality control filtering, the matrices are

93

normalized by dividing each cell by its total read count, and multiplying by the average total read

94

count across all cells. At this step, the user can provide a list of genomic regions, in BED format, to

95

exclude from the subsequent analysis, in cases of known copy number variation regions between

96

cells for example.

97
98

Dimensionality Reduction

99

In order to reduce the dimensions of the normalized matrix for further analysis, principle

100

component analysis (PCA) is applied to the matrix, with centering, and the 50 first PCs are kept for

101

further analysis. The user can visualize scChIP-seq data after quality control in the PCs dimensional

102

space. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm (Maaten and Hinton,

103

2008) is applied on the PCA to visualize the data in two dimensions. The PCA and t-SNE plots are a

104

convenient way to check if cells form clusters in a way that was expected before any clustering

105

method is applied. For instance, the user should verify whether the QC filtering steps and

106

normalization procedure were efficient by checking the distribution of cells in PC1 and PC2 space.

107

Cells should group independently of normalized coverage. In our hands, for our scChIP-seq

108

H3K27me3 datasets, minimum coverage of 1,600 unique reads per cell was required to separate

109

cells independently of coverage post normalization (Grosselin et al., 2019). We haven’t observed

110

any batch effect between our experiments in our first study most probably because we were

111

working with a single batch of hydrogel beads. Therefore no correction is implemented in this

112

version of the application, but we are planning to implement solutions to correct batch effect in a

113

future version.

114
115

Correlation and Filtering

116

Using the normalized dataset as input, hierarchical clustering is performed on the pairwise

117

Pearson’s correlation matrix. To improve the stability of our clustering approaches and to remove

118

from the analysis isolated cells that do not belong to any subgroup, cells displaying a Pearson’s

119

pairwise correlation score below a threshold t with at least p % of cells are filtered (p is

120

recommanded to be set at 1 % or 2 % depending on the dataset). The correlation threshold t is

121

calculated as a user-defined percentile of Pearson’s pairwise correlation scores for a randomized

122

dataset (percentile is recomanded to be set as the 99th percentile). The correlation heatmaps before

123

and after correlation filtering and the number of remaining cells are displayed to inform users on the

124

filtering process.

126

Consensus Correlation Clustering

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/683037; this version posted July 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was
not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made
available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

127

ChromSCape uses Bioconductor ConsensusClusterPlus package (Wilkerson et al., 2010) to examine

128

the stability of the clusters and compute item consensus score for each cell. Consensus partitions of

129

the dataset into a number of cluster ranging from 2 to 10 is done on the basis of 1,000 resampling

130

iterations (80% of cells sampled at each iteration) of hierarchical clustering, with Pearson's

131

dissimilarity as the distance metric and Ward's method for linkage analysis. The optimal number of

132

clusters can be chosen in order to maximize intra-cluster correlation scores based on the graphics

133

displayed on the ‘Consensus Clustering’ tab after processing. Clustering results can also be

134

visualized in two dimensions with the t-SNE plot. This unsupervised clustering allows to discover

135

clusters of cells based on their respective chromatin profile within a population without any prior

136

knowledge.

137
138

Peak Calling for genomic region annotation

139

This step of the analysis is optional, but recommended in order to obtain meaningful results with the

140

enrichment analysis. To be able to run this module, some additional command line tools are

141

required such as Samtools (Li et al., 2009), Bedtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and MACS2 (Liu,

142

2016). The user needs to input BAM files for the samples (one separate BAM file per sample), with

143

each read being labeled with the barcode ID. ChromSCape merges all files according and split them

144

again according to the previously determined clusters of cells (one separate BAM file per cluster).

145

Customizable significance threshold for peak detection and merging distance for peaks (defaults to

146

p-value=0.05 and peak merge distance to 5,000) allows to identify peaks in close proximity

147

(<1000bp) to a gene transcription start site (TSS); these genes will be later used as input for the

148

enrichment analysis. For the annotation, ChromSCape uses the reference human transcriptome

149

Gencode hg38 v26 (Frankish et al., 2018), limited to protein coding, antisense and lncRNA genes.

Differential Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

152

To identify differentially enriched regions across single-cells for a given cluster, ChromSCape

153

performs a non-parametric two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing normalized counts from

154

individual cells from one cluster versus all other cells. We test for the null hypothesis that the

155

distribution of normalized counts from the two compared groups have the same median, with a

156

confidence interval 0.95. The calculated p-values are then corrected by the Benjamini-Hocheberg

157

procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The user can set a log2 fold-change threshold and

158

corrected p-value threshold for regions to be considered as significantly differentially enriched (we

159

recommend to set corrected p-value and log2 fold-change thresholds respectively to 0.01 and 1).

160

Using the refined annotation of peaks done in previous step, the final step is to look for enriched

161

gene sets of the MSigDB v5 database (Subramanian et al., 2005) in differentially enriched regions.

162

We apply hypergeometric tests to identify gene sets from the MSigDB v5 database overrepresented

163

within differentially enriched regions, correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg

164

procedure. Users can then visualize most significantly enriched or depleted gene sets corresponding

165

to the epigenetic signatures of each cluster and download gene sets enrichment tables.

Application : ChromSCape deconvolves chromatin landscapes

168

of the tumor micro-environment

169

To showcase the use of ChromSCape to interrogate heterogeneity of chromatin landscapes within

170

several samples, we analyzed together four H3K27me3 mouse scChIP-seq datasets (GSE117309),

171

two of which had not been analyzed in our previous study (Grosselin et al., 2019). The raw FASTQ

172

reads were processed using the latest version of our scChIP-seq data engineering pipeline that

173

allowed a more precise removal of PCR and RT duplicates (code available at Github). Count

174

matrices (available at Figshare) were formatted into a ChromSCape compliant format. The samples

175

correspond to the mouse cells from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) originating from two different

176

human donors. The HBCx-22 and HBCx-22-TamR datasets correspond to mouse cells from a pair

177

of luminal ER+ breast PDXs: HBCx-22, responsive to Tamoxifen and HBCx-22-TamR, resistant to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/683037; this version posted July 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

178

Tamoxifen. The HBCx-95 and HBCx-95-CapaR correspond to a triple-negative breast cancer

179

(TNBC) tumor model of acquired resistance to chemotherapy. The four 50,000-bp binned matrices

180

of raw counts, in mm10 reference genome, were given as input to ChromSCape to interrogate the

181

heterogeneity of chromatin states within the tumor micro-environment of both luminal and TNBC

182

tumors. Tumor micro-environment is a key player in tumor evolution processes, and can vary

183

between tumor types and with response or resistance to cancer therapy. With ChromSCape, we

184

propose a comprehensive view of cell populations based on their chromatin profiles, and the

185

identification of tumor-type and treatment-specific cell populations and respective chromatin

186

features. All figures excepted Fig. 2d were automatically produced by the application and are easily

187

downloadable.

188

In the quality filtering step, a threshold of 2,000 minimum reads per cell was set due to a relatively

189

high initial number of cells (5,516 cells in total, see Fig. 1d). Samples were not affected to the same

190

extent by the filtering step (Fig. 1d, p-value = 5e-04, Fisher’s exact test): sample HBCx-95-CapaR

191

was affected twice more than all other samples by the filtering probably due to a lower initial cell

192

coverage. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, the data is visualized in reduced

193

dimensional spaces (after PCA and t-SNE reduction steps) according to either total count or sample

194

of origin (Fig. 1a-b). In both representations, we can observe multiple clouds of high count cells,

195

showing that total count is not the only source of variation between cells post normalization.

196

Interestingly, cells from the two different model mix generally well together showing that no major

197

batch effect was present between samples. Correlation filtering (Fig. 1c-d) was done setting the

198

quantile threshold at 99%, i.e cells need to have a correlation score greater than 0.44 with at least

199

1% of other cells to be kept for downstream analysis (Sup. Fig. 1). We note that this filtering step

200

may be biased towards removing meaningful cells from samples with low cell number, as they

201

might not have enough representative cells with each chromatin profile to pass treshold.

202

After performing consensus clustering approach on the filtered dataset for k=2 to k=10 clusters, we

203

chose to partition the data into k=4 clusters based on the knee method as a major leap in area under

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/683037; this version posted July 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

204

the CDF curve was observed between k=3 and k=4 clusters, and not between k=4 and k=5 (see Sup.

205

Fig. 2 a-b). Consensus score matrix in Fig. 1e shows that most of the cells were stably assigned to

206

four chromatin-based populations. Cluster C2 and C4 cells assignment is less stable than C1 and C3

207

(mean consensus scores are respectively 0.84 and 0.90 for C1-C3 and 0.70 and 0.71 for C2-C4, see

208

Sup. Fig. 2.a), suggesting that cells from C2 and C4 might share H3K27me3 features, whereas cells

209

from C1 and C3 have distinct H3K27me3 landscapes. Clusters C1, C2 and C4 contain cells from all

210

four samples, with a significantly higher proportion of HBCx-22-TamR for C1 (p-value = 3e-05,

211

Pearson’s Chi-squared test) (Fig. 1f, 1g, 2a). On the other hand, cluster C3 is almost exclusively (p-

212

value < 1e-05) composed of cells from model HBCx-95 (Fig. 1b, 2a), revealing a stromal cell

213

population specific to the triple negative breast cancer model (HBCx-95).

214

To further identify the specific features of each chromatin-based population, we proceeded to peak

215

calling, differential analysis and gene set enrichment analysis using default parameters (see

216

Methods). As H3K27me3 is a repressive histone mark, we focused our analysis on loci depleted in

217

H3K27me3, where transcription of genes can occur. The differential analysis identified respectively

218

189, 210, 83 and 9 depleted regions for clusters C1 to C4 (Fig. 2b). We found loci devoid of

219

H3K27me3 specific to cluster C2, enriched for genes involved in apical junction such as Bcar1

220

(Fig. 2c) and Ptk2, which are characteristic of genes expressed in fibroblasts. We found a depletion

221

of H3K27me3 specific to cluster C3 over the genes Nrros (Fig. 2c) and Il10ra, two genes

222

characteristic of immune expression programs. Depletion of H3K27me3 over the transcription start

223

site of Rap1gap2, a gene expressed in endothelial cells, was a key feature of cluster C4 (Fig. 2c).

224

For cluster C1 and C2, we found a depletion of H3K27me3 over Eln, a gene expressed in

225

fibroblasts.

226

Gene set enrichment analysis (q-value < 0.1) for genes located in regions depleted of H3K27me3

227

enrichment only revealed very few enriched gene lists, mostly for cluster C2 (Fig. 2d, multiple gene

228

230

transcription is indeed indirect, we see our gene list tool more appropriate for H3K4me3 scChIP-seq

231

or scATAC-seq datasets, where enriched regions are directly associated to gene transcription. In

232

addition, we are working on improving this step in future versions of the application, including

233

enhancer annotation for example.

234

Overall, these results are consistent with our previous analysis of HBCx-95 scRNA-seq datasets

235

where subpopulations were differentially expressing markers of fibroblasts, endothelial and

236

macrophage cells (Grosselin et al., 2019). This new analysis comprising the HBCx-22 dataset

237

allowed us to identify the H3K27me3 signature of potential endothelial cells (cluster C4). These

238

cells are present in each model, but might not have been previously detected in the previous

239

scChIP-seq analysis due to low cell representation. In addition, the H3K27me3 signature of

240

potential immune cells is restricted to cells from the TNBC model (cluster C3), suggesting that

241

these immune cells are absent from the luminal tumor. Altogether, ChromSCape can effectively

242

deconvolve chromatin landscapes in complex samples, such as tumors.

243
244

Conclusion

245

ChromSCape is a standalone Shiny/R application designed for both biologists and bioinformaticians

246

to analyze complex chromatin profiling datasets such as scChIP-seq datasets. The comprehensive

247

application is quick to take over plus the direct visualization of cells clusters combined to

248

configurable parameters and incremental saving of intermediary R objects eases bench-marking of

249

parameters. With an analysis of several scChIP-seq datasets of mouse stromal cells, we show that

250

heterogeneity of chromatin landscapes between and within cell populations can robustly be detected

251

by implementing multiple filtering steps as well as consensus clustering approach. Overall, we

252

predict that ChromSCape will be a useful tool to probe heterogeneity and dynamics of chromatin

253

profiles in various biological settings, not only in cancer development but also in cell development

254

and cellular differentiation.

Fig. 1. Filtering and Unsupervised Clustering of single-cell ChIP-seq H3K27me3 histone mark profiles of
mouse stromal cells from patient derived xenografts models (HBCx-22, HBCx-22-TamR, HBCx-95,
HBCx-95-CapaR PDXs, see Grosselin et al., 2019). Cells with lower than 2000 counts or with higher counts
than the 95th percentile were filtered. Regions not represented in at least 1% (n=23) of remaining cells were
excluded. (a) PCA and t-SNE plots colored by unique mapped reads. (b) PCA and t-SNE plots colored by
sample of origin. (c) Hierarchical clustering of cell-to-cell Pearson’s correlation scores before filtering step. (d)
Table of each sample's cell number before and after correlation filtering. (e) Hierarchical clustering and
corresponding heatmap of cell-to-cell consensus clustering of cells using k = 4 clusters. Consensus score ranges
from 0 (white: never clustered together) to 1 (dark blue: always clustered together). Cluster membership is color
coded above the heatmap. (f) Hierarchical clustering and corresponding heatmap of cell-to-cell Pearson’s
correlation scores for ‘correlated’ cells only. (g) Table of samples memberships to the clusters. P-value column
results from Pearson's Chi-squared goodness of fit test without correction, checking if the observed distribution
of samples in each cluster differs from theoretical distribution.

Fig. 2. Differential Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of single-cell ChIP-seq H3K27me3
histone mark profiles of mouse stromal cells (samples HBCx-22, HBCx-22-TamR, HBCx-95,
HBCx-95-CapaR PDXs). (a) t-SNE representations after correlation filtering (n=903 cells) and colored by
cluster or sample of origin. (b) Differentially bound regions identified by Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Genomic regions were considered enriched (red) or depleted (green) in H3K27me3 if the adjusted pvalues were lower than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2. (c) t-SNE representation of scChIP-seq
dataset, points are colored according to H3K27me3 enrichment signals in each cell for genes located in
depleted regions in C1 to C4, respectively Eln, Bcar1, Nrros and Rap1gap2. The adjusted p-values and
log2FC of the associated regions are indicated above each plot. (d) Barplot displaying the -log10 of
adjusted p-values from pathway analysis for cells of cluster C2 compared to all other cells in depleted loci.
Only the top 15 significant gene sets are indicated, filtering out depleted gene sets from MSIGdb classes
"c2_computational" and "c3_motifs".
