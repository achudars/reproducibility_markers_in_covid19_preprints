ABSTRACT

24
25

Pleural tuberculosis (PlTB), a form of extrapulmonary TB, remains as a challenge in the

26

diagnosis among many causes of pleural effusion. We recently reported that the combinatorial

27

analysis of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and adenosine

28

deaminase (ADA) from the pleural microenvironment was useful to distinguish pleural effusion

29

caused by TB (microbiologically or not confirmed cases) among other etiologies. In this

30

prospective cohort study, a set of inflammatory mediators was quantified in blood and pleural

31

fluid (PF) from exudative pleural effusion cases, including PlTB (n = 22) and non-PlTB (NTB; n

32

= 17) patients. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF, IP-10, TGF-β1, and

33

ADA were measured and a principal component analysis was applied in order to identify the

34

mediators who contributed most for the variance in data. IFN-γ, IP-10, TNF, TGF-β, and ADA

35

quantified in PF showed significantly higher concentrations in PlTB patients when compared to

36

NTB ones. When blood and PF were compared, we have identified significantly higher

37

concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 in PF, in both groups. TGF-β, solely, showed significantly

38

increased levels in PF and blood from PlTB when both clinical specimens were compared to

39

NTB patients. Principal components analysis from PF revealed that the ADA, IP-10, TGF-β, and

40

IFN-γ contributed most for the discriminatory capacity between TPlB and NTB. Our findings

41

showed that important inflammatory mediators in PF may discriminate TB cases from other

42

causes of exudative effusion, the main diseases considered in the differential diagnosis of PlTB.

INTRODUCTION

48
49

Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is currently endemic in the

50

world and represents an important public health problem every year. Globally, in 2017, more than

51

10 million new cases of TB were reported with an estimated 1.3 million deaths. Among

52

infectious diseases, TB is the leading cause of death from a single agent, surpassing the human

53

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1). Although TB affects mainly the lungs,

54

extrapulmonary forms can appear as an initial manifestation in approximately 25% of adults with

55

TB, of which the pleural space is the second site of involvement followed only by the lymph

56

nodes (2). In Brazil, a high burden TB country, PlTB is responsible for more than 40% of cases

57

among many clinical sites of extrapulmonary TB (3) and still imposes a challenging diagnosis

58

due to, mainly, its paucibacillary nature and the need of invasive producers (4).

59

Cellular immune response (Th1 immunity) involving CD4+ T-lymphocytes, classically

60

studied and associated with the containment of Mtb in pulmonary parenchymal TB, is also

61

predominant in TB pleuritis, which is confirmed by the higher levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-

62

γ) and other inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-12) in pleural fluid in comparison to peripheral

63

blood (2, 5–7). IFN-γ promotes cell differentiation, stimulates an increased phagocytic activity

64

and intermediate nitrogen and oxygen species production, which are bactericidal and participate

65

in resistance to Mtb infection (8, 9). In addition, other T-cell effectors patterns are involved in

66

Mtb control in the pleural microenvironment, such as Th17, which express the retinoic acid-

67

related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), and are characterized by secretion of large quantities

68

of IL-17 (also known as IL-17A), IL-21, and IL-22 (9, 10). Th17 cells induce the expression of

69

many pro-inflammatory factors, chemokines, ultimately involved in granulopoiesis and

70

recruitment of innate cells, mainly neutrophils, especially in the early stages of infection (11, 12).

71

It is well described that patients at early stages of the PlTB (less than 2 weeks duration) or those

72

who present pleural effusion with high complexity (e.g., loculated pleural effusion, TB

73

empyema) are more likely to have a neutrophilic exudate (reviewed by 13), which may contribute

74

to injuries and decreases pleuro-pulmonary functions.

75

Since that the gold standard for the diagnosis of PlTB which is the detection of Mtb in the

76

sputum, pleural fluid or pleural biopsy has a discrete and variable yield, the histological

77

demonstration of caseating granuloma even in the absence of acid-fast bacilli can be sufficient for

78

anti-TB treatment (14, 15). Additionally, values > 40 IU/L of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in

79

pleural effusion, a purine-degrading enzyme, associated with a predominantly lymphocytic

80

exudate, and clinical suspicious of TB, altogether, indicates that the most likely diagnosis is

81

tuberculosis (16, 17). However, high pleural fluid ADA values can also be found in certain

82

conditions, such as adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and pleural empyema of

83

bacterial etiology, making the differential diagnosis very hard (18, 19).

84

Considering the difficulty in the differential diagnosis already mentioned and the current

85

knowledge about the products of the immune response against Mtb in pleural space, the present

86

study aimed to identify biomarkers among Th1, Th2, and Th17 T-cells subsets and other

87

inflammatory mediators in peripheral blood and pleural fluid which could present high potential

88

of utility for the PlTB diagnosis among exudative pleural effusion from other etiologies. Based

89

on a principal component analysis (PCA), we could demonstrate a pattern of mediators which

90

was able to discriminate TB from non-TB pleural effusion.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

94
95

Study population and settings. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with pleural effusion under

96

investigation with thoracentesis indication were recruited in this cross-sectional prospective study

97

which was conducted at the Pulmonology and Tisiology Service, Pedro Ernesto University

98

Hospital/Rio de Janeiro State University (HUPE/UERJ), a tertiary care center at Rio de Janeiro,

99

RJ, Brazil. Patients who were under 18 years of age, pregnant, or refused consent were not

100

recruited. Of 49 recruited patients, 10 were excluded: 8 patients had transudative pleural effusion

101

(cardiac or renal failure), and 2 patients were HIV-seropositive. Thus, 39 patients with exudative

102

pleural effusion were enrolled in the study: 22 PlTB and 17 non-TB (NTB) patients. PlTB cases

103

were defined by the patient history reviewed, followed by a detailed physical examination, and at

104

least one diagnostic criteria: i) positive results in the microbiological and/or histopathological

105

tests (acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, mycobacterial culture, or Xpert MTB/RIF ®) on pleural

106

fluid or pleural tissue; ii) presence of granuloma with or without caseous necrosis; iii) clinical

107

manifestations suggesting TB (fever, pain, dyspnea, cough, night sweats, hyporexia, and/or

108

weight loss) in combination with a lymphocytic pleural effusion, followed by a full recovery after

109

at least six months of anti-TB treatment. Non-TB cases consisted of patients with pleural or

110

pleuro-pulmonary diseases, excluding active TB based on clinical, laboratory, radiological,

111

microbiological and/or pathological features. Malignant pleural effusions were diagnosed by a

112

positive pleural fluid cytology result or malignant cells identified in the pleural fragment. Even

113

when both of these tests results were negative, malignant effusion was diagnosed when a primary

114

cancer was known to have disseminated and no other cause of pleural effusion was identified.

115

Patients who did not fit the criteria used for PlTB diagnosis as above and with unknown cause of

116

pleural effusion were classified as “undefined” pleural effusion and considered as non-PlTB.

117

Medical information, peripheral blood, and pleural fluid sample collection were obtained from all

118

study subjects after signing a written consent. The study protocol was approved by the respective

119

institutional ethics committee (HUPE/UERJ; number 1.100.772).

120
121

Sample collection. Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was performed by a trained pulmonologist

122

who collected pleural fluid which was directly drawn into collection tubes for routine diagnostic

123

tests, including chemistry panel, total, and differential cell count, ADA measurement by Hermes

124

Pardini laboratory according Giusti´s method (20), cytopathology, microbiological analysis

125

(bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria), and inflammatory biomarkers for the purpose of the present

126

study. During collection, whole blood and pleural fluid were sampled in appropriated collection

127

tubes without anticoagulant additive. After collection, whole blood and pleural fluid tubes were

128

centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min and 25 °C or 4 °C, respectively. Then, serum and pleural fluid

129

(without cells) samples were aliquoted and stored frozen at -20 °C until cytokines quantification.

130
131

Cytokines assays. Cytokine levels in clinical samples were assessed using the following

132

commercially available kits: i) human Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit (BD Bioscience, San Jose,

133

CA, USA) based on the principle of cytometric bead array (CBA) technology for simultaneous

134

detection of seven cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-17A). Briefly, capture

135

beads labeled with distinct fluorescence intensity (allophycocyanin; APC) conjugated to specific

136

antibodies for cytokines were incubated around 3 hours in the dark at room temperature with the

137

undiluted samples, and fluorescent detection antibody (phycoerythrin; PE). All unbound

138

antibodies were washed and samples acquired on a BD fluorescence-activated cell sorting

139

(FACS) analyzer FACSCanto II. Cytokine standard curves ranged 0-5,000 pg/mL. ii) IP-10 and

140

TGF-β levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) sandwich using

141

human CXCL-10/IP-10 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems Inc, MN, USA) and human/mouse TGF

142

beta 1 ELISA Ready-SET-Go! Kit (2nd Generation; Affymetrix, eBioscience), respectively,

143

following the manufacturer’s instruction. The range of these assays was 31.3-20,000 pg/mL for

144

IP-10 and 15.6-1,000 pg/mL for TGF-β. Readings greater than the upper limit were set at 20,000

145

(IP-10) or 1,000 (TGF-β) pg/mL for the purpose of analysis.

146
147

Statistical analysis. For the description of the population included in the study, according to

148

their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among the individuals with exudative pleural

149

effusion due to PlTB or other causes (non-TB), non-parametric Mann-Whitney test were used for

150

continuous variables or Fisher's exact tests for comparison of the relative frequencies of the

151

different levels of nominal/categorical variables. In the comparison between the levels of log-

152

transformed expression (bases 10) of proteins in peripheral blood/serum and pleural fluid (tissue

153

effect) between individuals with or without TBPl (TB effect), the expected mean marginal values

154

obtained from multiple linear regression (log-linear) models of fixed effects were used with the

155

inclusion of first-order interactions between the main tissue and TB effects. For the adjusted

156

models, graphical analysis of residuals was performed to confirm their randomness. In the

157

comparisons between expected mean marginal values obtained from linear regression models,

158

adjustments of the confidence level were made by Sidak's method, and p-value adjustments by

159

multiple comparisons by Tukey's method. Finally, for log10-transformed protein and ADA

160

expression data, a multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to visualize

161

the distribution of sample individuals in 2D dimensional spaces. Ellipses of the quantiles 68% of

162

the normal distribution adjusted to the individuals of the different interest groups in these new

163

dimensional spaces are presented. The level of significance, P ≤ 0.05, was used in the analysis,

164

and all analyses were performed in R software version 3.5.2.

RESULTS

167
168

Patients and characteristics. Study population was composed by 39 individuals who were

169

diagnosed as PlTB (n = 22) or non-TB (n = 17) according previously described. Their

170

sociodemographic and clinical data are shown in Table 1. We observed a significant difference

171

between the age distributions between the groups, which presented medians corresponding to 65

172

years (IQR: 20) in the non-TB group, and 41 years (IQR: 14) in the PlTB group (p < 0.0001).

173

Smoking and alcoholic habits among participants did not show statistical differences. Similarly,

174

symptoms presentation was not dissimilar among groups. Fourteen (82%) patients in the non-TB

175

group had one or more comorbidities, showing that this group had a significantly higher number

176

of patients with comorbidities than observed in the P1TB group, which had 4 individuals (18%)

177

with others diseases (p = 0.0217). The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension, which was

178

reported in 6 (35%) non-TB patients and 2 (9%) P1TB patients. Among non-TB patients, 13 were

179

malignancies, 1 autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus), and 3 undefined pleural

180

effusion.

Cytokines measurement in blood and pleural fluid from PlTB and non-TB patients. In order

188

to evaluate the potential diagnosis of cytokines Th1/Th2/Th17, IP-10 chemokine, and ADA in

189

exudative cases of pleural effusion, serum and pleural fluid samples from PlTB and non-TB

190

patients were analyzed. As recently reported by our group (7) and others (21–23), IFN-γ and IP-

191

10 levels were significantly increased (p < 0.0001 in both) in pleural fluid comparison to serum

192

in PlTB group (Figure 1A and H). As shown in Figure 1B, TNF concentration also showed a

193

significant increase in the pleural fluid when compared to serum in PlTB patient (p = 0.0016).

194

When these cytokines were compared with discriminatory objectives between PlTB and

195

non-TB patients, we predominantly observed significant differences in pleural fluid. IL-6 and IL-

196

10 levels presented the same behavior when serum and pleural fluid were compared in PlTB or

197

non-TB groups (Figure 1G and E, respectively). Both IL-10 and IL-6 concentrations show that

198

patients in both PlTB (p < 0.0001 in both) and NTB (p < 0.0001 in both) groups show increased

199

concentrations of this cytokine in pleural fluid when compared to serum in their respective

200

groups. As expected, ADA levels were significantly higher in pleural fluid of PlTB patients

201

compared to non-TB (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, TGF-β concentrations were significantly higher

202

in the serum (p < 0.0001) and pleural fluid of P1TB patients, compared to concentrations found

203

in non-TB patient samples (p < 0.0001). Concentrations of this growth factor showed no

204

significant serum and pleural fluid difference when compared in the same group (Figure 1I).

205

Finally, IFN-γ, TNF, IP-10, TGF-β and ADA concentrations in the pleural fluid presented

206

a differentiated profile between PlTB and non-TB patients. Cytokines IL-17A, IL-4, and IL-2 did

207

not show significant differences in their concentrations.

Principal component analysis of pleural fluid cytokines. Finally, it was observed whether the

224

overall cytokines profile was able to discriminate PlTB and non-TB cases. In the principal

225

components analysis (PCA), 57.21% of the total variance in response to 9 cytokines and

226

biomarkers was expressed by 2 principal components (Table 2; Figure 2). The first component

227

accounted for a total of 40.58%, while the second accounted for 16,63% of the total variance

228

(Figure 2). Altogether, these 9 cytokines were able to discriminate between PlTB and non-TB.

229

The most determinant variables of each of these two principal components were respectively

230

ADA, IP-10, TGF-β, IFN-γ, and TNF, for the first principal component (PC1), and IL17A, IL-4,

231

and IL-2 for the second principal component (PC2).

NTB patients. The analysis of variance of cytokine concentrations by CBA (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL10, TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) and ELISA (TGF-β and IP-10) ADA were evaluated by the PCA
method, with the objective to finding heterogeneity between the cytokine profile of patients with
pleural tuberculosis (P1TB) and other diagnoses non-TB (NTB). Two components were used to
explain most of the total variation of these data.

DISCUSSION

250
251

Among many known causes of pleural effusion, heart failure, malignant conditions,

252

pneumonia, and PlTB are responsible for three-quarters of all cases (24). Currently, there is

253

scarce literature comparing PlTB with other causes of exudative pleural effusions, which

254

contributes to the difficulty of establishing criteria for the differential diagnosis of PlTB. The

255

present study sought to find elements that are capable of differentiating the tuberculous effusion

256

from other agents causing pleural effusion. Analyzing the pleural microenvironment, the

257

quantification of cytokines showed higher concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF, TGF-β, IP-10 and ADA

258

in LP of P1TB patients, when compared to LP of non-TB patients. Analysis of principal

259

components revealed that these cytokines and inflammatory mediators showed the largest

260

variations associated with a partial distinction between PlTB and non-TB patients.

261

As mentioned, ADA dosage is routinely used as a marker of PlTB, although it does not

262

define the differential diagnosis (17, 18). As for the general characteristics of pleural effusions, as

263

expected, the median value corresponding to ADA concentrations was significantly higher in the

264

PlTB group, compared to the non-TB group. Although very useful in the differentiation of

265

tuberculous effusion, several authors diverge about the true diagnostic value of the ADA, often

266

setting other cutoff values. However, although they are found in greater amounts in the pleural

267

fluid, these mediator have not been used, alone, as differential markers in exudative pleural

268

effusions. In a recent work published by our group (7), we proposed a model where the values of

269

IP-10, IFN-γ, and ADA in a revised cutoff value, analyzed together, can be used in the

270

differential diagnosis of P1TB with high performance in microbiologically unconfirmed cases of

271

PlTB.

272

The immune system plays a pivotal role in the evolution of Mtb infection. To contain the

273

infection, the defense cells together with inflammatory mediators generated at the site of the

274

infection produce a potent and aggressive response, which can generate important tissue lesions

275

(25). In addition, the direct action on the mesothelial cells and vascular endothelium, present

276

great participation of the tissue repair and fibrosis processes, causing functional impairment of

277

the pleural and lungs (26, 27). At the same time, an insufficient immune response may allow the

278

multiplication and dissemination of the bacillus (25). Otherwise, the immune system products can

279

be used to identify pleural effusions caused by TB.

280

Classically, the Th1 response is the most studied in TB, being responsible both for the

281

containment of Mtb and for the tissue injury caused by the excessive response to the bacillus

282

(reviewed by 28). As expected, Th1-related cytokines IFN-γ and TNF, as well as the biomarker

283

IP-10, are increased in the pleural fluid of P1TB patients compared to blood (Figure 1). Recently,

284

the dosage of IFN-γ in pleural effusion raised importance as an auxiliary method for the diagnosis

285

of PlTB, becoming an example of a test used for this purpose, since this cytokine is at high levels

286

during the active phase of the disease (23, 28). The IFN-γ-release assay (IGRA) has also been

287

highlighted in this context. The test evaluates the activity of T lymphocytes under stimulation of

288

Mtb ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antigens. However, as reviewed by Aggarwal and collaborators (2015)

289

there are many conflicting results regarding this diagnostic method of active tuberculosis, both in

290

pulmonary and pleural forms (29). Moreover, as recently delineated by our group, IGRA has a

291

poor meaning in PlTB (7), perhaps due to their paucibacillary nature or due to the enrichment of

292

inflammatory mediators in pleural space, without needing of an additional antigen-stimuli. TNF

293

is another important mediator in the response against Mtb and it is directly related to the

294

maintenance of the granuloma structure, maintaining the colonization of the bacillus and necrosis

295

area in a restricted manner (30). Other evidence shows that patients treated with an anti-TNF

296

antibody developed active tuberculosis after reactivation of latent infection (31). In addition, TNF

297

is important in the intracellular control of Mtb (Review by 25). Li et al. (2014) found a higher

298

diagnostic value in TNF measurements than that found in ADA values (22). IP-10 is well studied

299

as a possible biomarker in TB and is directly associated with INF-γ since its production is mainly

300

induced by this cytokine. As revised by Porcel (32), IP-10 is not an essential biomarker for the

301

PlTB diagnosis but has been the subject of several studies in this context, based on its

302

participation in the immunopathogenesis of the disease and their correlation with IFN-γ (7, 21).

303

Recently, the Th17 response also gained prominence in the immunopathology of

304

tuberculosis, especially in the early stages of infection (9, 10). Particularly in PlTB, Ye et al.

305

(2011) showed an increase of lymphocytes with Th17 profile in pleural fluid compared to blood.

306

Our results, presented here, show high concentrations of IL-6 and TGF-β in pleural fluid of PlTB

307

patients compared to serum (34). These two biomarkers are critical in the differentiation of Th17

308

cells (35). Therefore, although our study did not focus on the characterization of Th17 cells, it is

309

quite probable that the microenvironment, through the high concentration of IL-6, TGF-β, and the

310

low concentrations of IL-2 is favoring the differentiation of this T-lymphocytes effector

311

phenotype in the PLTB group.

312

IL-10 is a cytokine involved in the suppression of the immune response (36). In the case

313

of TB, it has been associated with suppression of dendritic cell activity, the formation of foamy

314

macrophages and defective formation of granuloma (37–39). The production of IL-10 is one of

315

the more classic mechanisms of suppression by T regulatory cells, however, this cytokine can be

316

produced by many other cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, B lymphocytes and

317

Th2 lymphocytes (40). Our study has shown higher concentrations of IL-10 in the pleural fluid of

318

patients with PlTB compared to serum, and in the same way in the NTB group. However, the

319

methodology used in this study was not able to identify which cells present in the pleural fluid

320

were responsible for the increase of IL-10 concentrations, as well as the other cytokines. Geffner

321

et al. (2013) showed an increased IL-10 production after stimulation of mononuclear cells in

322

pleural fluid and peripheral blood with Mtb antigens, and decrease of this cytokine after removal

323

of culture Treg cells provides evidence that Treg is also responsible for the production of IL-10

324

from the pleural cavity (41).

325

The cytokine pattern related to the Th2 effector phenotype was also evaluated. In the

326

methodology employed, but did not detect significant levels of IL-4. This finding confirms the

327

literature data that show little influence of this effector phenotype in cases of tuberculosis (2, 33),

328

although IL-4 concentrations in miliary TB have already been reported (5).

329

Another important finding in our study was the quantification of TGF-β in serum and

330

pleural fluid. This growth factor, secreted by monocytes, is a chemotactic agent for fibroblasts,

331

plays an important role in extracellular matrix remodeling (42). One of the possible contributions

332

of TGF-β to the pathophysiology of PlTB is its ability to induce fibrosis, as shown in the study by

333

Sasse et al (2003), where animals infected with Mtb showed increased pleural thickening in

334

proportion to the increase in TGF- β (43). Seiscento et al (2007) also found elevated TGF-β

335

levels in serum and pleural fluid of PlTB patients, associating with the degree of pleural

336

thickening in these patients (44). Our findings, together with the evidence found in the literature,

337

reinforce the hypothesis that this mediator may be related to the development of pleural effusions

338

in TBP1 patients since TGF-β levels were found to be significantly higher in the pleural fluid of

339

these patients, compared to the results found in non-TB patients. Although the cited studies found

340

a significant increase of TGF-β in pleural fluid and serum, the comparison group in the

341

experimental model of these studies was composed of patients with transudative pleural effusion.

342

Our work was able to detect the increase of TGF-β in the serum and pleural fluid of PlTB

343

patients, compared to blood and pleural fluid in patients with other causes of exudative effusion.

344

This finding may contribute to future investigations, associating TGF-β as a possible biomarker

345

to aid in the differential diagnosis of PlTB.

346

In fact, the cytokines analyzed alone are not able to provide data of high specificity and

347

sensitivity, especially in comparison to exudative effusions. However, when analyzed together,

348

they can provide high diagnostic value (7, 22). Therefore, in the present study, PCA was

349

performed in an attempt to establish a pattern of cytokines and mediators in blood and pleural

350

fluid capable of discriminating the PlTB and non-TB cases. Our results show that 9 cytokines and

351

biomarkers, measured in blood and pleural fluid, were reduced to two principal components

352

(Table 2). Together, they were able to discriminate the PlTB and non-TB cases and explained

353

57% of the variation. The cytokines with determinant values were ADA, TGF-β, IP-10, IL-17A,

354

IFN-γ, TNF, IL-4, and IL-2. These results provide new data in the search for new markers

355

capable of differentiating the causes of exudative pleural effusion.

356

Some limitations should be considered in our study. First, it was conducted in a single-

357

center, imposing a validation in other reference centers and in different populations. Another

358

consideration is regarding the relatively low number of patients included per group. However,

359

patients were included prospectively, in a real routine of clinical practice in a tertiary reference

360

center which reflected in variable clinical characteristics inherent of each group of study, as can

361

be observed in Table 1. Moreover, we have analyzed only exudative cases of pleural effusion, the

362

main confounders in the differential diagnosis of TB. Also, we have excluded transudative cases

363

which could add some bias in our analysis.

364

In summary, the analysis of a panel of inflammatory mediators previously highlighted in

365

the TB literature was useful to provide new hypotheses and better comprehension about

366

microenvironment of the pleural cavity during the immunopathology of Mtb infection. In

367

addition, the screening in pleural fluid identified biomarkers with high potential for use alone or

in combination, which is able to increase the sensitivity of diagnosis and prompt the TB

treatment, especially in cases of hard identification and distinction by conventional diagnostic
