Abstract

25

Food technologies provide numerous benefits to society and are extensively vetted for safety.

26

However, many technological innovations still face high levels of skepticism from consumers.

27

To promote development and use of food technologies, it is critical to understand the

28

psychological and neurobiological processes associated with consumer acceptability concerns.

29

The current study uses a neuroscience-based approach to understand consumer attitudes and

30

perceptions of risk associated with food technologies and investigate how such attitudes impact

31

consumer’s processing of information related to food technologies. We used functional magnetic

32

resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation while participants processed infographics

33

related to food technology topics. For technology topics perceived as riskier (antibiotics and

34

hormones), activation was higher in areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex that are associated with

35

decisional uncertainty. In contrast, technology topics that were viewed more favorably

36

(sustainability and animal welfare) tended to activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region

37

that processes positive affect and subjective value. Moreover, for information about hormones,

38

the lateral PFC activation was associated with individual differences in resistance to change in

39

risk perception. These results reveal how attitudes and risk perception relate to how the brain

40

processes information about food technologies and how people respond to information about

41

such technologies.

1. Introduction
Innovations in food technology hold great promise for improving food quality,

48

availability, safety, and sustainability. However, like other technological innovations (Kleijnen,

49

Lee, & Wetzelsa, 2009), new food technologies are often met with resistance in the marketplace.

50

Consumers tend to be neophobic when it comes to foods (Pliner & Hobden, 1992), particularly

51

foods produced with new technologies (Cox & Evans, 2008), even when expert scientists have

52

vetted the technologies for safety (Hansen, Holm, Frewer, Robinson, & Sandøe, 2003). Such

53

neophobia presents a barrier to development of novel technologies as well as their adoption by

54

food producers. The high cost of investment in bringing technologies to market or deploying

55

such technologies in food production can become financially risky when faced with the high

56

potential for rejection by consumers (Lusk, Roosen, & Bieberstein, 2014). Thus, to promote

57

development of safe, effective technologies for improving food sustainability and safety, it is

58

critical to understand the psychological and neurobiological factors associated with consumer

59

attitudes and risk perception for new technologies.

60

Consumer research on food technologies has uncovered several factors that influence

61

acceptance and resistance to innovation, as well as people’s willingness-to-pay for such

62

innovations in the marketplace (Lusk et al., 2014). At a proximal level, people’s attitudes and

63

perceptions of risk play a critical role in influencing acceptance of new food technologies.

64

Compared to organic or “natural” foods, foods produced with technologies are often viewed as

65

having fewer benefits and higher risks (Frewer, Shepherd, & Sparks, 1994; Saba, Rosati, &

66

Vassallo, 2000). Thus, consumers are often willing to pay more to avoid technologies such as

67

genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hormones, or antibiotics than they are to purchase food

68

created with them (Lusk et al., 2015; Lusk et al., 2014; Roosen et al., 2015). The origins of

69

consumers’ less positive attitudes and heightened risk perception to food technologies remain

70

elusive, but factors that are known to play a role are the perceived naturalness of foods or a

71

technology (Tenbült, de Vries, Dreezens, & Martijn, 2005; Siegrist, 2008), tendencies to

72

overweight low probability risks (Slovic, 2016), perceived controllability of exposure (Siegrist,

73

Stampfli, Kastenholz, & Keller, 2008), familiarity (Tenbült, de Vries, Dreezens, & Martijn,

74

2008), trust in science (Lang & Hallman, 2005; Siegrist, Cousin, Kastenholz, & Wiek, 2007),

75

and personal ethical beliefs (Sparks, Shepherd, & Frewer, 1995).

76

More recently, research on food technology has begun to turn to neuroscience techniques

77

to understand the cognitive mechanisms related to consumer acceptance of food technology at a

78

finer-grained level (Bruce et al., 2014; Lusk et al., 2015). Neuroscience research on food

79

technologies follows the recent focus in behavioral economics on “neuroeconomic” approaches

80

that have proven useful for understanding a number of basic economic phenomena, such as loss-

81

aversion (Rick, 2011), temporal discounting (Kable & Glimcher, 2007; Ballard & Knutson,

82

2009), and how uncertainty influences preferences and perceptions of value (Platt & Huettel,

83

2008; Rushworth & Behrens, 2008). Multiple brain systems track basic behavioral economic

84

constructs like value and risk, including “hot” affective systems that tend to be governed by more

85

automatic, affective information, and “cool” systems that promote more deliberate, rational

86

decision making (Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2000; Goel & Dolan, 2003; McClure, Laibson,

87

Loewenstein, & Cohen, 2004).

88

Much of neuroeconomic research has focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as critical

89

for value-based decision making processes. The prefrontal cortex is part of the frontal lobe and

90

governs much of our higher-level cognitive functions such as planning and reasoning, as well as

91

numerous social and affective processes. In terms of its role in value-based decision making,

92

there are key differences within the prefrontal cortex between the lateral PFC (on the sides of the

93

brain) and the medial PFC (the middle part of the brain, behind the forehead and above the eyes).

94

The lateral PFC tends to track measures of economic risk and uncertainty, which are related to

95

variability in possible outcomes associated with a decision (Kahnt, Heinzle, Park, & Haynes,

96

2011; Schonberg, Fox, & Poldrack, 2011). It typically activates more when a variety of different

97

outcomes are possible and less when an outcome is completely predictable. The lateral PFC also

98

tends to track individual differences in risk aversion, such as people’s tendency to overvalue sure

99

bets (Christopoulos, Tolber, Bossaerts, Dolan, & Schultz, 2009). On a mechanistic level, the

100

lateral PFC is thought to be involved in resolving conflicting information (e.g., outcome

101

variability) in cases of higher uncertainty, due to its more general role as a center for cognitive

102

control (Koechlin, Ody, Kouneiher, 2003; Badre & D’Esposito, 2009).

103

In contrast to the lateral PFC, the medial PFC, particularly the ventral part of it (the

104

underside; ventromedial PFC), tends to track the overall subjective value of a decision (Levy &

105

Glimcher, 2012; Bartra, McGuire, & Kable, 2013). When a decision has high subjective value,

106

this brain region tends to activate more, and when there is low subjective value, it activates less.

107

The medial PFC tracks individual differences in preference for immediate reward (Kable &

108

Glimcher, 2007) and sensitivity to gains versus losses (Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007).

109

Whereas the lateral PFC is often depicted as a “cold,” rational part of the brain, the medial part is

110

often depicted as part of the “hot,” affective part of the brain due to its sensitivity to immediate

111

reward (McClure et al., 2004; Krain, Wilson, Arbuckle, Castellanos, & Milham, 2006).

112

However, both are sensitive to cognitive and affective information. The lateral PFC is involved

113

in basic regulation of cravings and emotional responses (Delgado, Gillis, & Phelps, 2008; Kober

114

et al., 2010; Kahathuduwa, Boyd, Davis, O’Boyle, & Binks, 2016; Kahathuduwa et al., 2018).

115

Likewise, the ventromedial PFC integrates cognitive and more visceral affective information

116

when computing a subjective value (Roy, Shohamy, & Wager, 2012). For example, the

117

ventromedial PFC tracks people’s tendency to rate wines as more subjectively valuable when

118

they are associated with a higher price tag than when the equivalent wine is low priced (“price

119

placebo effect”; Plassmann, O’Doherty, Shiv, & Rangel 2008; Plassmann & Weber, 2015).

120

6

Following general neuroeconomic research, fMRI research on the neurobiological

121

underpinnings of food technology choice has focused on how the PFC engages when making

122

willingness-to-pay judgments. Consistent with the role of the lateral PFC in resolving uncertainty

123

and conflict, lateral PFC has been found to be more active when participants are considering

124

multi-attribute food choices that require them to consider both price and technology attributes

125

(e.g., the price of milk and that it was produced from cloned cows; Lusk et al., 2015), and when

126

participants opt for a higher-priced organic food to avoid a technology (Linder et al., 2010; Lusk

127

et al., 2015). Likewise, activation in the lateral PFC tends to track relevant individual differences

128

that contribute to price-technology conflicts, such as trait-level food technology neophobia

129

(Bruce et al., 2014) and how much people adjust their willingness-to-pay judgments based on

130

advertising (McFadden et al., 2015). In contrast, the ventromedial PFC has been found to be

131

more associated with people’s final willingness-to-pay decisions in price-technology trade-offs

132

(Crespi et al., 2015), consistent with its role in computing subjective value. In some cases, such

133

signals from the PFC have been shown to contribute above and beyond many well-established

134

demographic and individual difference contributors to willingness-to-pay, leading to the

135

conclusion that functional neuroimaging provides incremental value in predicting and

136

understanding consumer choices regarding food technology tradeoffs (Lusk et al., 2015).

With the relatively limited neuroscience research on how people perceive food

138

technologies, there are many open questions regarding how the brain processes information

139

about food technology and how these processes influence potential consumer behavior. Given

140

the critical role that information and education about technologies plays in consumer acceptance,

141

one important question is how the brain processes information about food technologies and how

142

this processing relates to perceived risk and consumer attitudes. Perceived risk and attitudes are

143

key pre-decisional factors that influence not only how consumers will behave when given a

144

choice between foods produced with new technologies or more “natural” foods, but also how

145

receptive they will be to new information (Hart et al., 2009; Sears & Freedman, 1967; Smith,

146

Fabrigar, & Norris, 2008).

147

In the present study, we scanned individuals while they viewed infographics describing

148

six food technology topics: hormones, antibiotics, vaccines, GMOs, animal welfare technologies,

149

and sustainability technologies (for task design see Figure 1; Supplemental Figures 1-6). The

150

infographics were selected from materials designed for marketing purposes and are publicly

151

available on Merck Animal Health’s website prior to the study (https://www.merck-animal-

152

health-usa.com/about/us/veterinary-consumer-affairs/animal-welfare). Thus, the infographics

153

used are highly ecologically valid in the sense that they are from actual informational campaigns

154

aimed at influencing consumer acceptance. Based on an online norming study (described below),

155

we expected attitudes and risk perception to vary across the food technology topics such that

156

hormones and antibiotics would be perceived as most risky and associated with less positive

157

attitudes, GMOs and vaccines as intermediate, and animal welfare and sustainability

158

technologies as least risky and associated with the most positive attitudes.

In terms of the brain, we hypothesized that the same basic lateral and medial PFC regions

161

that are involved with processing decisional information in willingness-to-pay judgments would

162

be involved in processing the food technology infographics and that such processing would be

163

associated with subsequent risk perception and attitudes. To this end, we hypothesized that

164

lateral PFC activation would track the perceived riskiness of the technologies and would be

165

associated with less positive attitudes for the technologies. Specifically, we expected that the

166

higher perceived risk and less positive attitude technologies would be associated with more

167

lateral PFC activation. This prediction is based on the fact that lateral PFC often tracks

168

uncertainty and risk aversion in choice contexts (Schonberg et al., 2011). Likewise, we

169

hypothesized that ventromedial PFC activation would track positive attitudes such that the

170

technologies with the most positive attitudes would activate the ventromedial PFC more. This

171

prediction is based on the fact that ventromedial PFC often tracks liking and positive value, even

172

outside of choice contexts (Roy et al., 2012).

173

In addition to our primary goals, which are to examine how risk perception and positive

174

attitudes relate to brain activation during infographic processing, we also examine how

175

individual differences in risk perception and attitude change (from pre- to post-infographic) are

176

associated with individual differences in brain activation. These individual difference effects can

177

augment the primary associations by answering whether, for example, the hypothesized risk-

178

related processing in lateral PFC is generally associated with improving risk perception and

179

attitudes or if it is associated with resisting such change.

2.2.1 Online Norming Study

192

The online norming study (Figure 2) consisted of a demographic section, attitudes and

193

risk perception survey sections for each of the following technology/animal welfare topics:

194

antibiotics, vaccines, hormones, GMOs, sustainability, and animal welfare, followed by a set of

195

non-technology specific standardized questionnaires: Food Technology Neophobia, Trust-in-

196

Science, and Chemical Reasoning.

197

The demographics section included questions asking people to report their age, sex,

198

ethnicity, first language, zip code (or country) in which they spent majority of childhood, highest

199

level of education completed, political orientation, organic buying behavior, whether they eat

200

meat, and whether they subscribe to any dietary philosophies (vegan, vegetarian, etc.; see Table

201

202

The attitudes and risk perception survey sections went through each technology, one at a

203

time, such that all attitudes questions were asked about a given technology prior to beginning the

204

next. The online norming group did not see any infographics. The order of the technologies was

205

balanced across participants using a Latin square to neutralize potential order effects. For each

206

technology, the attitudes surveys began with a brief description of the technology, which

207

participants were required to briefly summarize in their own words prior to moving on (to ensure

208

participants were paying attention). Next, participants were asked two questions each on

209

familiarity, subjective norms, trust in science (with respect to the specific technology), past

210

behavior with the technology (consuming or avoiding food produced with the technology), and

211

perceived control. All of these factors are known to potentially impact attitudes and risk

212

perception (Aizen, 1991; Slovic, 2016). We used wordings that are consistent with these existing

213

risk perception studies and the Theory of Planned Behavior (see Supplemental Table 1 for

214

wording for all questionnaires). However, in some cases we had to adapt wordings from typical

215

wordings to ensure that the same basic questions could be used for all of the technologies of

216

interest. After the preliminary questions, participants answered a section on risk perception and

217

two sections on attitudes: one on more personal attitudes and one on more general benefits. Each

218

of the risk and attitude sections contained eight questions, two of which were designated as “pre”

219

questions and added to the pre-surveys for the neuroimaging study, and six were designated as

220

“post” questions and asked after the infographic exposure in the neuroimaging study. Because no

221

infographics were shown in the online norming study, both “post” and “pre” questions were

222

asked at the same time in the online norming study. Examples of the wording of all questions in

223

the attitudes sections are listed in Supplemental Table 1.

224

After completing the technology-specific questions for each of the six technologies,

225

participants completed standardized surveys on Food Technology Neophobia scale (Cox and

226

Evans, 2008), a standardized Trust in Science Scale (Bak, 2001), and a set of questions from a

227

study on chemical risk perception (Kraus, Malmfors, & Slovic, 1992) that includes factors

2.2.2 Neuroimaging Study

231

11

The neuroimaging study (Figure 2) included a demographic section, a pre-infographic

232

exposure survey taken outside of the scanner, infographic exposure and attitude/risk perception

233

surveys done inside the scanner for each technology, and a set of willingness-to-pay judgments

234

and non-technology specific standardized questionnaires (Food Technology, Neophobia, Trust-

235

in-Science, chemical risk perception) taken after all of the infographic exposures and technology

236

specific attitudes/risk perception surveys.

237

The demographic section was the same as that used for the online norming study, except

238

we also included a question asking for household income (Table 1). After the demographic

239

section, the participants completed a pre-infographic survey for each technology that included all

240

of the questions used in the norming study for familiarity, perceived norms, technology-specific

241

trust-in-science, past behavior with the technology, and perceived control, as well as two pre-

242

infographic questions on each of general attitudes, benefits, and risk perception.

243

In the infographic and attitude/risk perception section (see Figures 1 and 2), infographics

244

depicting the six food technology topics (antibiotics, vaccines, hormones, GMOs, sustainability,

245

and animal welfare; See Supplemental Figures 1-6 for the infographics used in the study) were

246

presented to participants separately in different scanning runs. The order of infographics was

247

balanced across participants using a Latin square. Within a run, participants were presented with

248

an infographic depicting one of the technologies three times. Prior to each infographic

249

presentation, participants were cued/primed (2 seconds) with what information they would be

rating next (“attitudes”, “benefits”, and “risks”). Priming participants about the type of questions

they would be answering next was done to encourage participants to actively process the

252

infographics during the presentation blocks and to scan all of the information in the infographic

253

across the three presentations. The cues were separated by variable duration fixation cross (2, 3,

254

or 4s), which participants were simply told to keep their eyes on while awaiting infographics.

255

The fixation cross provides a baseline that helps to statistically isolate the responses to the

256

different task components. After fixation, the infographic was presented for 30s. After the

257

infographic was presented, fixation was briefly presented (5, 6, or 7 seconds) and then six post-

258

infographic Likert-type questions about risks or attitudinal information (attitudes or benefits)

259

were presented for 4 seconds each. During these questions, participants keyed in their responses

260

on a sliding scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) by using an MR-

261

safe button box held in their right hand. Finally, the risk and attitudes questions were also

262

separated by fixation, which averaged 4 seconds and was drawn from a truncated exponential

263

distribution. A second and third infographic cue, infographic presentation, and question period

264

would then begin until all questions were answered for an infographic.

265

After the primary infographic runs, participants completed a set of willingness-to-pay

266

judgments and the same Food Technology Neophobia, Trust-in-Science, and chemical risk

267

perception surveys as were used in the online norming study. The willingness-to-pay judgments

268

consisted of a Becker-DeGroot-Marschack (1964) style auction. In this auction, participants were

269

asked to bid from $1-$5 on a variety of food items produced with food technologies (see

270

Supplemental Figure 7 for an example trial). Participants were told that one of the food items

271

would be selected randomly at the conclusion of the auction for purchase using their $5

272

endowment. They were told that the cost of the item would be whatever they bid, and that the

273

probability a specific food item would be selected was based on how much they bid, such that a

each food item to be worth $5 retail and thus the rational choice was to bid however much they

276

were willing to pay for each item. The foods the participants evaluated were beef jerky, turkey

277

jerky, canned chicken, chili, coffee creamer, and frosting. Participants considered these foods

278

with each of the following technology related prompts: “Animals raised fully organic”, “Animals

279

raised all natural”, “Animals raised with hormone implants”, “Animals previously vaccinated”,

280

“Animals previously treated with antibiotics”, “Animals raised with genetically modified (GM)

281

feed”, “Animals raised with animal welfare technologies”, and “Animals raised with sustainable

282

food technologies”. Because some of the technology options do not exist for particular foods

283

(e.g., hormone implants are only used in beef production) or are impossible to verify through

284

labeling (type of feed), at the end of the study, participants were told that they could simply

285

select one of whatever food item they wanted from conventional, “natural” labeled, or organic

286

labeled versions of each of the food options. Six participants did not have willingness-to-pay

287

judgments properly recorded and were excluded from that analysis.

2.3 Image Acquisition

289

Imaging data were acquired at Texas Tech Neuroimaging Institute on a 3T Siemens Skyra

290

using a 20-channel head-coil. Functional images were acquired in the axial plane using the

291

Siemen’s product EPI sequence: TR = 2.09 s; TE = 25 ms; θ = 70°; FoV= 192 x 192 mm; matrix

292

= 64 x 64; number of slices = 41, slice thickness = 2.5 mm; 0.5 mm gap. Slices were tilted to

293

reduce orbitofrontal dropout (Deichmann, Gottfried, Hutton, & Turner, 2003). In addition, a

294

high-resolution anatomical image was collected for each of the participants using an MPRAGE

295

sequence acquired in the sagittal plane: TR = 1.9 s; TE = 2.49 ms; θ = 9°; FoV = 240 x 240 mm;

296

matrix = 256 x 256 mm; slice thickness = 0.9 mm, slices = 192.

2.4.1 Behavioral Data Analysis

298

Participant averages were calculated for each of the behavioral measures by averaging

299

across the respective scale items for each construct (e.g., averaging across all post-infographic

300

attitudes questions for hormones to get a single hormone attitude average for each participant).

301

Group-level averages and standard deviations were then calculated for each measure by

302

averaging across participant means. Benefits and personal attitudes were combined a priori into a

303

single positive attitudes measure for all analysis (behavioral and neuroimaging) because there

304

were no a priori differences predicted between benefits and personal attitudes in terms of brain

305

processing or behavior, and because the combination of personal attitudes and benefits only

306

increased reliability (see Supplemental Table 2 for Cronbach’s coefficient alpha for all risk and

307

attitude measures).

308

Behavioral data from both studies were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models

309

implemented in R’s nlme package (Pinheiro and Bates, 2006). The overall analysis strategy was

310

to assess whether participants’ mean risk perception, attitudes, and willingness-to-pay varied

311

significantly across the food technologies. Follow-up t-tests were used to test specific planned

312

contrasts for how these measures varied across the technologies. Specifically, for risk perception

313

and attitudes, we tested whether hormones and antibiotics were associated with higher risk

314

perception and less positive attitudes compared to (1) GMOs and vaccines and (2) animal

315

welfare and sustainability technologies. We also tested (3) whether GMOs and vaccines were

316

associated with higher risk perception and lower positive attitudes than sustainability and animal

317

welfare technologies. For the willingness-to-pay judgments, we tested whether participants were

318

more willing to pay for organic and natural foods relative to (1) animals raised/treated with

319

antibiotics and hormones, (2) animals raised/treated with GM feed and vaccines, and (3) animals

raised with sustainability and animal welfare technologies.

321

To test whether attitudes or risk perception changed from pre- to post-infographic in the

322

neuroimaging study, we adopted a standardization procedure using the online norming data. Z-

323

scored risk perception (Zrisk) and attitude (Zatt) variables were calculated for each participant j

324

and technology t by:

325

𝑍𝑎𝑡𝑡$% = (𝑎𝑡𝑡$% − 𝜇𝑎𝑡𝑡% )⁄𝜎𝑎𝑡𝑡% ,

326

where 𝑎𝑡𝑡$% is neuroimaging participant j’s mean positive attitude rating for technology t, 𝜇𝑎𝑡𝑡%

327

is the mean positive attitudes rating for technology t from the online norming study, and 𝜎𝑎𝑡𝑡% is

328

the standard deviation of positive attitude ratings for technology t from the online norming study.

329

Four Z values were calculated for each technology and neuroimaging participant: one for each

330

pre- and post-infographic scale for risk perception and attitudes. The purpose of this

331

standardization procedure was to neutralize mean differences between the pre- and post- attitudes

332

questionnaires that were simply due to differences in the pre and post question means. By

333

removing the online norming study’s means, any remaining differences between pre- and post-

334

infographic should be due to changes in risk perception or attitudes from viewing the

335

infographics. The differences between pre- and post-infographic Z’s (post- pre) were tested using

336

separate t-tests for each technology. The Z difference (post - pre) measures are also used in the

337

fMRI analysis testing for individual differences in risk perception and attitude change (see 2.4.2

344

motion correction and skull stripping. The first-level model included explanatory variables (EVs)

345

for cue presentation, infographic presentation (separate EVs for risk and attitudes prompts),

346

stimulus presentation for risk and attitudes questions, and participants’ ratings as a parametric

347

modulator of the rating questions. First-level models also included nuisance regressors for

348

motion (6 motion parameters and their temporal derivatives) and regressors to “scrub” (censor)

349

volumes with framewise displacement > .9mm (Siegel et al., 2014). The first level model also

350

included temporal derivatives for each task variable, high-pass filtering, spatial smoothing (6mm

351

FWHM), two-stage registration to high resolution anatomical and standard space, and pre-

352

whitening to account for temporal autocorrelation. Second level models included EVs for each

353

infographic type (antibiotics, vaccines, hormones, GMOs, sustainability, and animal welfare) and

354

included one contrast weighting each infographic type by its average risk rating, and one contrast

355

weighting each infographic by its average attitude rating (ratings were z-scored to ensure

356

contrast weights summed to zero). These contrasts estimate, for each participant, which brain

357

regions correlate with between-infographic differences in risk perception and attitudes,

358

respectively. Third-level models tested the average group-level effect of the second-level

359

contrasts, treating participant as a random effect for population inference. Additional third-level

360

models were used to test whether brain activation for any of the infographics was associated with

361

change in attitudes or risk perception from pre- to post-infographic by correlating activation with

362

participants’ post – pre infographic Z scores (see 2.4.1 Behavioral Data Analysis).

3. Results

371

3.1 Behavioral Results

372

3.1.1 Online Norming Study.

373

Our primary question for the online norming study was whether the technologies differed

374

in terms of mean positive attitudes and risk perception (Table 2). Using linear mixed effects

375

models, we found significant variability in the technology means across each of the scale

376

measures (Table 3). Note that the pre- and post-scales are separated to align with the

377

neuroimaging study, but because no infographics were presented in the online norming study, all

378

measures were taken at the same time. Planned contrasts revealed that hormones and antibiotics

379

were perceived as significantly riskier and associated with significantly less positive attitudes

380

compared to (1) vaccines and GMOs and (2) sustainability and animal welfare technologies.

381

Vaccines and GMOs were perceived as significantly riskier and associated with significantly less

382

positive attitudes compared to sustainability and animal welfare technologies (Table 4). Means

383

and standard deviations for other survey measures are listed in Supplemental Tables 3 & 4.

384

3.1.2 Neuroimaging Study.

385

The behavioral results of the neuroimaging study were similar to the online norming

386

study. There was significant variability across the technologies in all risk perception and attitudes

387

measures (pre- and post-infographic; Tables 2-3; Figure 3). Like the online norming study,

388

hormones and antibiotics were perceived as significantly riskier and were associated with less

389

positive attitudes compared to (1) vaccines and GMOs and (2) sustainability and animal welfare

390

technologies. However, vaccines and GMOs did not significantly differ from sustainability and

391

animal welfare technologies for any measures except for the pre-infographic attitudes measure

392

where they were associated with significantly less positive attitudes (Table 4). Comparing post-

393

infographic to-pre- attitudes using Z difference scores (post – pre) that were normalized with

394

respect to the online norming study’s scale means and standard deviations revealed that risk

395

perception decreased and positive attitudes increased for all technologies after viewing the

396

infographics (Table 5). Means and standard deviations for other survey measures are listed in

397

Supplemental Table 3.

398

Analysis of willingness-to-pay judgments also revealed significant variability across the

399

technologies (Table 2; Figure 4), with willingness-to-pay for organic and natural labeling

400

exceeding (1) hormones and antibiotics, (2) vaccines and GMOs, and (3) sustainability and

401

animal welfare technologies (Tables 4 & 6).

3.2.1 Activation related to risk processing.

405

Four clusters of activation were positively associated with mean risk ratings across infographics

406

(greater activation for higher risk; Figure 5; Table 7): one spanning the left dorsolateral

407

prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; P < .001), two in bilateral superior

408

parietal lobe (left: p = .002; right: p = .040), and one in the superior and middle temporal gyrus

409

around the temporo-parietal junction (p < .001).

The observed lateral PFC cluster is part of the lateral PFC region that we predicted
would be associated with between-infographic differences in risk perception. To further illustrate

how activation in the lateral PFC varied between the infographics, we extracted mean risk and

413

attitude activation from each subject and plotted them along with the whole-brain results in

414

Figure 5. Note that, because these results are from a region already showing significant tracking

415

of between-infographic risk, it is not appropriate to run additional statistical tests on them

416

(Kriegeskorte, Simmons, Bellgowan, & Baker, 2009); however, the graph is useful to visualize

417

how the lateral PFC is tracking risk. The graph shows that lateral PFC activation tends to be

418

highest for the high perceived risk topics (antibiotics and hormones), but there is less

419

differentiation between the lower perceived risk topics (GMOs, vaccines, animal welfare, and

420

sustainability).

421
422
423

3.2.2 Activation related to attitude processing.
Six clusters of activation were positively associated with attitude differences between the

424

infographics (higher activation for more positive attitudes; Figure 6; Table 7), and nine clusters

425

were negatively associated with attitude differences between the infographics (higher activation

426

for more negative attitudes; Figure 6; Table 7). The positively associated regions included the a

427

priori region of interest ventromedial prefrontal cortex (p = .049), along with dorsal anterior

428

cingulate cortex (ACC; p < .001), two clusters in the precuneus (cluster 1: p < .001; cluster 2: p =

429

.026), the supramarginal gyrus (p = .007), and the lingual gyrus (p = .030).

430

The observed ventromedial PFC cluster is part of the ventromedial PFC region that we

431

predicted would be associated with between-infographic differences in attitude positivity. The

432

ventromedial PFC activation is depicted, along with the whole brain activation, in Figure 6. As

433

the bar graph illustrates, this region again primarily distinguished between the less positive

attitude (higher perceived risk; antibiotics and hormones) technologies and the more positive

435

attitude technologies. Note that the overall direction of activation is deflected negative in medial

436

PFC, which simply reflects its lower activation relative to the baseline fixation periods. This

437

negative deflection is typical in cognitive tasks as this brain region is part of the “default mode

438

network,” a network of regions that tend to be more active during rest (Raichle, 2015).

439

Clusters that were negatively associated with between-infographic differences in positive

440

attitudes were bilateral (both sides of the brain) lateral PFC regions (both p < .001), the left of

441

which overlaps with the cluster revealed for the risk perception analysis, as well as superior

442

parietal regions that overlapped with the risk results (both p < .001). The lateral PFC region was

443

again part of predicted lateral PFC region that we expected to be negatively associated with

444

attitudes (more activation for less positive attitudes).

445

3.2.3 Individual Differences in Attitude Change

446

In addition to examining overall risk and attitudes associated with the infographics, we

447

wanted to examine whether any brain regions were predictive of an individual’s change in

448

attitudes or risk perception toward the food technologies. To this end, we entered participants’

449

post - pre-infographic attitude and risk perception Z change scores into third-level whole-brain

450

GLM analysis to test which brain regions were significantly associated with individual

451

differences in risk and attitude change.

452

Two of these analyses showed significant results: change in risk perception for the

453

hormone infographic and change in attitudes for the GMOs infographic. For the hormone

454

infographic (Figure 7A & 7C; Table 7), we found four clusters that were significantly associated

455

with change in risk perception: bilateral lateral PFC (Left: p = .01; Right: p = .006), superior

456

frontal gyrus (p = .01), and frontal pole (p = .006). Specifically, these regions were positively

457

associated with change in risk perception, which indicates that these regions were associated

458

with either resisting change in risk (as most participants decreased) or increasing perceptions of

459

risk. These results help to interpret the within-subject lateral PFC effects, where the lateral PFC

460

was associated with higher risk perception and less positive attitudes across the infographics.

461

Specifically, they suggest that the lateral PFC may be inhibiting attitude change for hormones, as

462

opposed to encouraging attitude change. However, these results seem to be specific for

463

hormones, as they did not appear for any of the other risk change measures.

464

In addition to the hormone results, we found three significant clusters that were positively

465

associated with attitude change for GMOs (higher activation for more positive attitude change):

466

in the supramarginal gyrus (p < .001), the thalamus (p = .01), and left cerebral white matter (p =

467

.02; Figure 7B & 7C; Table 7).

468

4. Discussion

469

Food technologies play an important role in food quality, sustainability, and global food

470

security, yet technological innovation is often met with resistance from consumers. The present

471

study used neuroimaging to reveal how the brain processes information related to food

472

technology topics and how these neurobiological processes vary with perceived riskiness and

473

attitudes associated with the technologies. Participants viewed infographics about six different

474

food technology topics including antibiotics, hormones, GMOs, vaccines, sustainability, and

475

animal welfare. We found that activation in lateral PFC tracked between-infographic differences

476

in risk perception and attitudes and was most activated for the higher perceived risk / less

477

positive attitude topics (antibiotics and hormones). In contrast, ventromedial PFC activation

478

tracked positive attitudes and was most activated for the topics (GMOs, vaccines, sustainability,

479

and animal welfare) associated with more positive attitudes. In addition to our primary, between-

480

infographic results, we found individual differences in risk perception change for hormones was

22

481

negatively correlated with lateral PFC activation, suggesting that, for this topic, higher lateral

482

PFC activation was associated with resistance to change in risk perception. Finally, part of the

483

supramarginal gyrus was positively correlated with individual differences in attitude change for

484

GMOs.

485

The fMRI results present a critical step forward in understanding consumer attitudes and

486

risk perceptions surrounding food technology. Because education and dissemination of

487

information are necessary tools for reducing consumer resistance to technological development,

488

it is important to understand how processing such information is related to differences in

489

attitudes and risk perception. Functional neuroimaging provides a promising window into

490

consumer information processing as it has the potential to show—above and beyond self-report

491

surveys—which information is being processed overall more positively, by examining how

492

activation in regions associated with positive subjective value, such as the ventromedial PFC,

493

track attitudes and risk perception. It also has the potential to uncover which information is being

494

processed more effortfully, which tends to activate regions associated more with uncertainty

495

processing. Brain activation patterns can thus reveal how and whether informational campaigns

496

are leading to effective processing by consumers, and potentially index attitude and risk

497

perception change.

498

Despite the success of the current study at identifying regions that track attitude and risk

499

perception differences between food technologies, it is important to note that it remains unclear

500

whether attitudes are affecting how the information about the technologies is being processed or

501

are a reflection of the information the infographics contain. For example, the increased

502

ventromedial PFC may reflect more positive attitudes toward animal welfare technologies and

503

sustainability in general, or may reflect the fact that participants like the specific contents of

504

these infographics better. Future research will need to dissociate individuals’ baseline affective

505

responses to and cognitive information about food technology topics from the information

506

present in the infographics and determine how these factors overlap. Nevertheless, the current

507

results point to connections between infographic processing and attitudes/risk perception that are

508

useful for understanding how consumers approach information about food technologies.

509

The present results complement and extend previous fMRI studies on willingness-to-pay

510

for foods (e.g., milk, eggs) produced with food technologies. Previous studies have largely

511

focused on the same lateral PFC regions that we identified here. The lateral PFC tends to be

512

more active when participants are considering both price and technology in willingness-to-pay

513

judgments, in addition to tracking participants’ choices to opt for more expensive organic or

514

natural choices (Linder et al., 2010; Lusk et al., 2015). These results are related to the present

515

finding that the lateral PFC tends to activate more for the less liked, higher perceived risk

516

technologies and may reflect the same general uncertainty-related mechanism. When people are

517

confronted with technologies that conflict with their preferences, the lateral PFC may be engaged

518

to help them resolve this uncertainty. Likewise, consistent with previous findings that the

519

ventromedial PFC tracks the outcomes of willingness-to-pay judgments (Crespi et al., 2015), we

520

found the ventromedial PFC tracks overall attitudes for the technologies.

521

What is critical about the present results, relative to previous willingness-to-pay studies,

522

is that such lateral PFC and medial PFC activation are connected to information processing

523

surrounding technologies outside of choice-related contexts. This suggests that the activation

524

found in previous willingness-to-pay studies may not reflect simple trade-offs between price and

525

technology, but more basic pre-decisional attitudes that feed into such choice trade-offs. For

526

example, it may be the case that lateral PFC activation during a choice to pay more for organic

527

foods specifically reflects less positive attitudes toward technologies as opposed to uncertainty

528

about the decisions per se. Whether the PFC activation observed in previous studies reflects an

529

attitudinal “input” into the decision process or an “outcome” of the decisional process (see e.g.,

530

Davis, Love, & Maddox, 2009) is an important question for future research. In many cases,

531

attitudes, risk perception and decision processes are tightly coupled, and thus the practical

532

upshot—that people will pay to avoid technologies that generate conflict or uncertainty—may be

533

the same in both scenarios.

534

In addition to its higher activation for technologies that were perceived as higher risk and

535

associated with less positive attitudes, our finding that lateral PFC activation was negatively

536

correlated with individual differences in change in risk perception for hormones gives important

537

information about the lateral PFC’s potential function in the present context. The lateral PFC has

538

been shown in previous studies to track individual differences in decision-making and cognitive

539

performance (Christopoulos et al., 2009; Schonberg et al., 2011; Worthy et al., 2016). Although

540

the lateral PFC has been shown to track participants’ willingness to pay more to avoid food

541

technologies and is often associated with individual differences in risk aversion, other results

542

suggest that activation in lateral PFC may not always be associated with increases in negative

543

attitudes or perceived risk. Indeed, a recent study on willingness to pay for animal welfare

544

technologies in egg production has shown that lateral PFC may more generally reflect updating

545

of willingness-to-pay based on information (McFadden, et al., 2015). This could mean that

546

lateral PFC activation is not necessarily positively or negatively related to acceptance of a

547

technology, but rather simply reflects controlled deliberation (i.e., elaboration; Petty &

548

Cacioppo, 1986). The outcome of such controlled deliberation may be an increase or decrease in

549

attitudes (or potentially even no change), depending on several factors such as argument

strength, personal relevance, cognitive ability, and participants’ motivations for changing their

551

attitudes (Petty, Briñol, & Priester, 2009). For example, here lateral PFC was associated with

552

resistance to changing risk perception for hormones, but perhaps with different arguments or

553

with participants motivated to change their risk perceptions, it may have been associated with

554

decreased risk perception.

25

555

Interestingly, in the present study, the results for risk perception and positive attitudes

556

were largely overlapping in the sense that the same lateral PFC regions that tracked between-

557

infographic differences in risk perception also tended to be negatively correlated with positive

558

attitudes (higher activation for less positive attitudes). These results suggest, in the present case,

559

that risk perception and attitudes may tap many of the same neurobiological systems. This is not

560

a surprise as risk perception is often tightly coupled with attitudes, and attitudes are a facet of

561

risk perception (Kraus, Malmfors, & Slovic, 1992). However, whether this observation will

562

extend to other areas of risk perception or attitudes remains an open question. One reason why

563

the present results may overestimate the neurobiological overlap between risk perception and

564

more general attitude processing is that many of the technologies were associated with low risk

565

overall. Indeed, only the highest perceived risk categories (antibiotics and hormones)

566

consistently exceeded the scale midpoint (2.5) and even then, they were well below the limits of

567

the scale (scale max = 5; see Table 2). It is possible that more extreme risks may tap additional

568

brain regions associated with fear and negative affect, such as the amygdala (Feinstein, Adolphs,

569

Damasio, & Tranel, 2011).

570

A second reason we may not have observed large differences between the brain regions

571

tracking attitudes and risk perceptions is that the infographics chosen for the study were

572

developed as tools for promoting food technologies and thus did not contain extensive risk

573

information (e.g., of possible antibiotic resistance from livestock use). Although some of the

574

infographics presented information relevant to aspects of chemical risk perception, such as dose-

575

to-response reasoning (e.g., in the hormones and antibiotics infographics; Kraus, Malmfors, &

576

Slovic, 1992), or risks to livestock from wild animals or the elements (animal welfare

577

infographics), none of the information would be expected to increase risk perception a priori.

578

Our goal in the present study was not to induce perception of risk per se by presenting risky

579

information, but instead to test how brain activation tracked people’s general perceptions of risk

580

about the technologies, and how such risk perception related to infographic processing. In this

581

way, our study was consistent with the majority of risk perception studies on chemicals and food

582

technologies that simply seek to measure people’s perceptions of risk without telling them

583

specific known risks of such chemicals and technologies (e.g., Cox & Evans, 2008; Kraus,

584

Malmfors, & Slovic, 1992). Future studies should consider testing whether presenting

585

participants with information intended to increase perceptions of risk would change which brain

586

regions track risk perception. Indeed, a mix of information that is congenial and uncongenial to

587

participants’ baseline inclinations may better represent the real-life information environment and

588

provide opportunities to study the roles of selective information search and memory on

589

perceptions of food technologies (Hart et al., 2009).

590

With respect to whether brain regions involved in risk perception and attitude processing

591

may diverge in studies using riskier technologies or those giving participants more risk-specific

592

information, another possible limitation of the current study is that participants may not have

593

followed the cue to focus on risks or attitudes/benefits during infographic processing at all. For

594

example, it is possible participants focused on the same information in the infographics

595

regardless of whether they were cued to focus on risks or personal attitudes/benefits. As we

596

discuss above, the cueing procedure was primarily intended to encourage active processing of the

597

infographics and prime participants for what types of questions they would be answering next.

598

Because all participants received the same cues, it is not possible to definitively answer whether

599

this priming changed how participants processed the infographics. Indeed, the strong consistency

600

of the results across cue types suggests that the participants may not have changed their

601

infographic processing substantially based on the cues. However, the individual difference

602

results are suggestive that some risk and attitude-specific processing differences across cue types

603

may have occurred. For example, lateral PFC activation for hormones during the risk perception

604

blocks specifically correlated with individual differences in risk perception change for hormones,

605

but this association was not observed for attitude change during the attitude change blocks.

606

Nevertheless, our primary goal of examining how risk perception and attitudes relate to brain

607

processing during infographic viewing is not dependent on participants changing how they

608

processed the infographics based on the cues. For example, even if all infographic viewing

609

blocks were processed the same (or if there were no cues presented at all), our findings that brain

610

activation during infographic processing tracks subsequent between-infographic differences in

611

risk perception and attitudes presents a useful starting point for studying how information about

612

food technologies is processed by the brain.

613

A final limitation of the present study is that the infographics we employed contained a

614

wide range of varied strategies to convey the safety and utility of the food technologies. Thus, it

615

is not possible to separately conclude which aspects of the infographics may have been stronger

616

or weaker in influencing attitudes and risk perception, or brain activation, the most. For example,

617

the hormones infographic contains information highlighting the low tissue accumulation of

618

hormones from hormone implants, relative to other dietary sources of estrogen, information

28

619

about sustainability and environmental benefits, and the fact that the implants replace some

620

naturally occurring hormones that are removed by food production practices. Any of these

621

strategies could be leading to the observed attitude and risk perception results and activation for

622

this infographic. Future studies interested specifically in isolating cognitive and neurobiological

623

factors that lead to increases in attitudes and consumer acceptability may wish to constrain the

624

arguments to be presented in more serial fashion to isolate their individual effects. Nevertheless,

625

the use of preexisting real-world infographics offers a strong, ecologically valid simulation of

626

how participants may encounter information about food technologies outside of the laboratory.

627

The tight coupling we observed between participants’ attitudes and risk perception and brain

628

activation suggests that fMRI may be useful for screening such infographics before public

629

information campaigns are deployed.

630

4. Conclusions

631

The present study examined the neurobiological processes engaged when participants

632

viewed information related to food technologies. We found that areas of the lateral PFC tracked

633

heightened risk perception and less positive attitudes for technologies, whereas the medial PFC

634

tracked positive attitudes. These results give a unique window into the minds of consumers, as

635

they illustrate how differences in attitudes and risk between food technologies affect basic

636

information processing in the brain. Connections between the basic attitudinal-risk processing

637

and individual differences in activation suggest that functional neuroimaging may be a useful

638

tool for assessing how people process informational materials about the benefits of food

639

technologies, which may lead to more effective strategies for combatting resistance to such

640

technologies. Indeed, to promote increasing advances in food quality, sustainability, and security,
