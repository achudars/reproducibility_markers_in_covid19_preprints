Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting
mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET)
requires a mechanically-gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma
HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose
primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex.
Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET
channel assembly and function have not been analyzed.

Here we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a
expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression
is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in
auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line
neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5
function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged
Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFPLhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa
motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work
corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals
novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest
that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently
of Lhfpl5 proteins.

The mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex of sensory hair cells is an assembly of proteins
and lipids that facilitate the conversion of auditory, vestibular and hydrodynamic stimuli into electrical
signals. Our current understanding is that the proteins of the MET complex consist of the tip link
proteins cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) at the upper and lower ends of the tip
link respectively (Kazmierczak et al., 2007), the pore-forming subunits transmembrane channel-like
proteins TMC1 and TMC2 (Kawashima et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2013, 2018), and the accessory subunits
transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) and lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) (Cunningham
and Müller, 2019; Xiong et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2014). How these proteins are correctly localized to
the sensory hair bundle and assemble into a functional complex is a fundamental question for
understanding the molecular basis of how mechanotransduction occurs.

Recent studies have revealed extensive biochemical interactions between the MET complex proteins
that are required for the function and / or stable integration of each component in the complex. In
particular, LHFPL5 is a central player in MET complex formation, stability, and function. LHFPL5
(a.k.a. tetraspan membrane protein of the hair cell stereocilia / TMHS) is a four transmembrane domain
protein from the superfamily of tetraspan junctional complex proteins. This superfamily includes
junctional proteins like claudins and connexins, as well as ion channel auxiliary subunits such as
transmembrane α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)
regulatory proteins (TARPs) and the gamma subunits of voltage gated calcium channels. Pathogenic
mutations in LHFPL5 are a cause of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss in humans (DFNB67),
mice and zebrafish (Longo-Guess et al., 2005; Nicolson et al., 1998; Obholzer et al., 2012; Shabbir et
al., 2006). LHFPL5 localizes to the tips of stereocilia (Li et al., 2019; Mahendrasingam et al., 2017;
Xiong et al., 2012) where it directly interacts with other MET complex components. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in heterologous cells suggests that LHFPL5 can directly interact
with PCDH15 and TMIE (Xiong et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2014). A structure of the PCDH15 - LHFPL5
complex has also been reported (Ge et al., 2018).

A precise role for LHFPL5 has yet to be defined. One current hypothesis is that LHFPL5 acts as an
auxiliary subunit of the MET channel to stabilize the complex, similar to TARPs and the gamma
subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. In mouse cochlear hair cells, PCDH15 and LHFPL5
require each other for stable localization at the tips of stereocilia (Mahendrasingam et al., 2017; Xiong
et al., 2012), consistent with their well-defined biochemical interaction. The partial loss of PCDH15
from the stereocilia explains the observed reduction in the number of tip links and the dysmorphic hair
bundles in Lhfpl5-/- hair cells. Interestingly, although experiments have failed to demonstrate a
biochemical interaction between LHFPL5 and the TMCs, LHFPL5 is required for the localization of
TMC1, but not TMC2, in the hair bundle of mouse cochlear hair cells (Beurg et al., 2015). Consistent
with this finding, the researchers identified a residual TMC2-dependent MET current in Lhfpl5 mutant
mice. The basis for the selective loss of TMC1 is not known.

In zebrafish, Lhfpl5a plays a similar role in mechanotransduction as its mammalian counterparts. A
mutation in zebrafish lhfpl5a was reported in a forward genetic screen for genes required for hearing
and balance (Nicolson et al., 1998; Obholzer et al., 2012). The loss of Lhfpl5a disrupts the targeting of
Pcdh15a to stereocilia and results in splayed hair bundles (Maeda et al., 2017). However, Lhfpl5a is
not required to correctly localize Tmie and vice versa (Pacentine and Nicolson, 2019), in spite of their
biochemical interaction in cultured cells (Xiong et al., 2012). Lhfpl5 still localizes to the tips of
stereocilia in Tmc1/Tmc2 double mutants (Beurg et al., 2015), as well as transmembrane Omethyltransferase (tomt) mouse and zebrafish mutants, which fail to traffic TMCs to the hair bundle

(Cunningham et al., 2017; Erickson et al., 2017). This phenotype suggests that Lhfpl5 localization does
not require the TMCs. However, a number of questions regarding the functions of Lhfpl5 remain
unanswered: 1) In zebrafish, what are the molecular requirements for targeting Lhfpl5a to the hair
bundle? 2) Is the Lhfpl5-dependent targeting of Tmc1 to the hair bundle an evolutionarily-conserved
aspect of their interaction? 3) lhfpl5a mutants have defects in auditory and vestibular behaviors, yet
sensory hair cells of the lateral line are unaffected (Nicolson et al., 1998). What is the genetic basis for
the persistence of lateral line function in lhfpl5a mutants?

In this work, we report that teleost fish have two lhfpl5 genes, lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b. The zebrafish lhfpl5
ohnologs are expressed in distinct populations of larval sensory hair cells: lhfpl5a in the auditory and
vestibular system; lhfpl5b in the hair cells of the lateral line organ. Their divergent expression patterns
explain why lateral line hair cells are still mechanically-sensitive in lhfpl5a mutants. CRISPR-Cas 9
knockout of lhfpl5b alone silences the lateral line organ but has no effect on otic hair cell function. We
also show that neither Lhfpl5a nor Lhfpl5b are required for Tmc localization in stereocilia.
Additionally, we use a GFP-tagged Lhfpl5a to demonstrate that Myo7aa and the tip link proteins Cdh23
and Pcdh15a are required for proper Lhfpl5a localization in otic hair cell bundles. This study reveals
the subfunctionalization of the zebrafish lhfpl5 ohnologs through the divergence in their expression
patterns. Furthermore, our work complements previous results from murine cochlear hair cells by
highlighting a conserved association between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also demonstrating novel
requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa in localizing Lhfpl5a. Lastly, our work indicates that Lhfpl5dependent localization of Tmc1 is not a universal feature of sensory hair cells and that Lhfpl5 proteins
are required for mechanotransduction independently of a role in localizing the Tmc channel subunits
to stereocilia.

We performed the microphonic measurements as previously described (Pacentine and Nicolson, 2019).
In brief, we anesthetized 3 dpf larvae in extracellular solution (140 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2,
1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); pH 7.4)
containing 0.02% 3-amino benzoic acid ethylester (MESAB; Western Chemical). We pinned the larvae
with two glass fibers straddling the yolk and a third perpendicular fiber to prevent sliding. For pipettes,
we used borosilicate glass with filament, O.D.: 1.5 mm, O.D.: 0.86 mm, 10 cm length (Sutter, item #
BF150-86-10, fire polished). Using a Sutter Puller (model P-97), we created recording pipettes with a
long shank with a resistance of 10-20 MΩ, after which we beveled the edges to a resistance of 4-5 MΩ
using a Sutter Beveler with impedance meter (model BV-10C). For the glass probe delivering the piezo
stimulus, we pulled a long shank pipette and fire polished to a closed bulb. We shielded the apparatus
with tin foil to completely ground the piezo actuator. To maintain consistent delivery of stimulus, we
always pressed the probe to the front of the head behind the lower eye, level with the otoliths in the ear
of interest. We also maintained a consistent entry point dorsal to the anterior crista and lateral to the
posterior crista. During delivery of stimulus, the piezo probe made light contact with the head. We
drove the piezo with a High Power Amplifier (piezosystem jena, System ENT/ENV, serial # E18605),
and recorded responses in current clamp mode with a patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, EPC 10 usb
double, serial # 550089). Voltage responses were amplified 1000x and filtered between 0.1 - 3000 Hz
by the Brownlee Precision Instrumentation Amplifier (Model 440). We used a 200 Hz sine wave
stimulus at 10 V and recorded at 20 kHz, collecting 200 traces per experiment. Each stimulus was of
40 ms duration, with 20 ms pre- and post-stimulus periods. The piezo signal was low-pass filtered at
500 Hz using the Low-Pass Bessel Filter 8 Pole (Warner Instruments). In Igor Pro, we averaged each
set of 200 traces to generate one wave response per larva. To quantify hair cell activity, we calculated
the amplitude from base-to-peak of the first peak. Larvae were genotyped as described above.

Genes that have been duplicated as a result of a whole genome duplication (WGD) event are known as
ohnologs (Ohno, 1970; Wolfe, 2000). Due to the teleost-specific WGD, it is not uncommon to find
ohnologous genes in teleost fish where other vertebrate classes possess a single gene. The Danio rerio
(zebrafish) genome contains two lhfpl5 genes: lhfpl5a (ENSDARG00000045023) and lhfpl5b
(ENSDARG00000056458). To determine if lhfpl5 duplication is general to the teleost lineage, we
queried either GenBank or Ensembl databases to collect Lhfpl5 protein sequences for humans, mice,
chick, frogs, and representative sequences from 14 phylogenetic orders of ray-finned fish
(Actinopterygii), including 13 orders from the Teleostei infraclass and one from the Holostei infraclass
(Supplemental Table 1). The latter (Spotted gar, Lepisosteus oculatus) is commonly used to infer the
consequences of the teleost WGD, since the Holostei and Teleostei infraclasses diverged before the
teleost WGD (Braasch et al., 2016). Phylogenetic analysis of the Lhfpl5 protein sequences supports
the idea that duplicate lhfpl5 genes originated from the teleost WGD event (Figure 1A). In all 13 teleost
orders surveyed, there are two lhfpl5 genes whose protein products cluster with either the lhfpl5a or
lhfpl5b ohnolog groups. Based on available genomic data, there is no evidence that spotted gar fish
have duplicated lhfpl5 genes. Nor is there evidence that the Salmonid-specific WGD (Allendorf and
Thorgaard, 1984) lead to further expansion of the lhfpl5 family. These analyses suggest that the
ancestral lhfpl5 gene was duplicated in the teleost WGD and that the lhfpl5 ohnologs were retained in
all teleost species examined here.
Alignment of the zebrafish Lhfpl5a and Lhfpl5b proteins with those from human, mouse and chicken
reveals that both zebrafish ohnologs retain the same protein structure (Figure 1B). Zebrafish Lhfpl5a
and Lhfpl5b are 76% identical and 86% similar to one another (Needleman-Wunsch alignment).
Compared to human LHFPL5, Lhfpl5a and Lhfpl5b are 70 / 65 % identical and 86 / 81 % similar
respectively. The ENU-generated mutation in lhfpl5a (tm290d) (Obholzer et al., 2012) is indicated by
the red triangle (K80X). To investigate the function of lhfpl5b, we generated a Cas9-induced lesion in
the lhfpl5b gene in a similar location as the tm290d mutation. We recovered a line with a 5 base pair
deletion leading to a frameshift mutation (lhfpl5bvo35, red square; S77FfsX48).

To characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of lhfpl5a/b gene expression, we performed whole
mount mRNA in situ hybridization on zebrafish larvae at 1, 2, and 5-days post-fertilization (dpf)
(Figure 2). After one day of development, there are nascent hair cells of the presumptive anterior and
posterior maculae in the developing ear, but no lateral line hair cells at this stage. We detect lhfpl5a
expression in the presumptive anterior and posterior maculae at 1 dpf (Figure 2A). No signal for lhfpl5b
was observed at this time point (Figure 2B). At 2 dpf, we observe a clear distinction in the expression
patterns of the lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b genes (Figure 2C, D). lhfpl5a continues to be expressed in the ear,
but expression is not observed in the newly deposited neuromasts. Conversely, we detect lhfpl5b
expression exclusively in neuromasts at this stage, both on the head (Figure 2D) and trunk (data not
shown). This divergence in lhfpl5 ohnolog expression continues at 5 dpf, with lhfpl5a found
exclusively in the sensory patches of the ear and lhfpl5b restricted to lateral line hair cells (Figure 2EJ). Taken together, our results suggest that both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b have been retained since the teleost
whole genome duplication because of their non-overlapping mRNA expression patterns.

lhfpl5atm290d (astronaut / asn) mutants were initially characterized by balance defects, an absence of
the acoustic startle reflex, and a lack of brainstem Ca2+ signals after acoustic startle. However,
neuromast microphonic potentials were normal (Nicolson et al., 1998). In light of our in situ
hybridization data (Figure 2), these results suggest that lhfpl5a is required for auditory and vestibular
hair cell function only. To test this possibility, we performed several functional assays measuring the
activity of hair cells in the otic capsule. First, we tested macular hair cell activity (Lu and DeSmidt,
2013; Yao et al., 2016) by recording extracellular microphonic potentials from the inner ears of
lhfpl5atm290d mutants, along with wild type and lhfpl5bvo35 larvae at 3 dpf. We then measured baselineto-peak amplitude of the first peak to quantify activity (Supplemental Figure 1A-D). Consistent with
the initial characterization of the behavioral defects in lhfpl5atm290d mutants, we did not detect robust
microphonic potentials from the inner ear of lhfpl5atm290d mutants (Figure 3A). We measured an
average first peak microphonic of 53.1 µV from lhfpl5atm290d mutants (n = 7), which was significantly
less than the 296.2 µV average value of their WT siblings (n = 5; p = 0.01, Welch’s t-test). We believe
that at least some of the signal detected in lhfpl5atm290d mutants may be a stimulus artefact due the
unusual rise time and similar observations we have made in other known transduction-null mutants.

For the lhfpl5bvo35 mutants (n = 6), we measured an average first peak microphonic potential of 280.9
µV. These values were not significantly different from their WT siblings (n = 4, average 243.8 µV; p
= 0.7) but were significantly greater than the lhfpl5atm290d mutants (p = 0.036). Thus, lhfpl5atm290d
mutants exhibit defects in inner ear function, while the lhfpl5bvo35 mutation has no effect on these hair
cells. To further confirm the lack of inner ear function in lhfpl5atm290d mutants, we performed an
acoustic startle test on larvae at 6 dpf (Figure 3B). Results confirm that lhfpl5atm290d mutants are
profoundly deaf, displaying little to no response to acoustic stimuli (p < 0.001 compared to all other
genotypes). Finally, we examined the basal MET channel activity of hair cells of the inner ear by
injecting FM 4-64 into the otic capsule and imaging the lateral cristae sensory patch. WT hair cells
readily labeled with FM 4-64 whereas lhfpl5atm290d mutant cells showed no sign of dye internalization
(Figure 3C-D). These three tests confirmed that all sensory patches in the otic capsule are inactive in
lhfpl5atm290d mutants.

previously (Erickson et al., 2017). GFP-Lhfpl5a is present at the tips of stereocilia, similar to the
localization observed for mouse LHFPL5 (Mahendrasingam et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2012). To

demonstrate that the GFP-Lhfpl5a protein is functional, we assayed for rescue of the acoustic startle
reflex and MET channel activity in homozygous lhfpl5atm290d mutants expressing the transgene. The
startle reflex of lhfpl5atm290d mutants expressing GFP-Lhfpl5a were statistically indistinguishable from
non-transgenic and transgenic WT siblings (p = 0.48 and 0.26 respectively; Figure 3B). Likewise, FM
4-64 dye-labeling in the inner ear was restored to lhfpl5atm290d mutants expressing GFP-Lhfpl5a (Figure
3E-F’). From these results we conclude that the hair bundle-localized GFP-Lhfpl5a protein is
functional and can rescue the behavioral and MET channel defects in lhfpl5atm290d mutants.

The divergent expression patterns of the lhfpl5 ohnologs suggests that lhfpl5b alone may be mediating
mechanosensitivity of lateral line hair cells. To test this, we compared basal MET channel activity in
neuromast hair cells of WT, lhfpl5atm290d and lhfpl5bvo35 larvae using an FM 1-43 dye uptake assay
(Figure 4A-C). Strikingly, lateral line hair cells in lhfpl5bvo35 mutants do not label with FM 1-43 while
there is no difference in the intensity of FM 1-43 labeling of hair cells between WT and lhfpl5atm290d
mutants (Figure 4A-C, Supplemental Figure 2A - C). We quantified this loss of lateral line function in
lhfpl5b mutants by measuring the average FM 1-43 fluorescence intensity per hair cell in each imaged
neuromast of lhfpl5bvo35 mutants and wild type siblings at 2 dpf (Figure 4D, E, H) and 5 dpf (Figure
4F-H). lhfpl5bvo35 mutants exhibit a statistically significant decrease in FM 1-43 uptake at both 2 dpf
and 5 dpf (Welch’s t-test, p < 0.001 both time points). While there is negligible FM dye labeling in the
vast majority of lhfpl5bvo35 mutant neuromasts, we occasionally observe labeling in some hair cells,
most reproducibly in the SO3 neuromast. Occasional labeling persists in lhfpl5a / lhfpl5b double
mutants, indicating that lhfpl5a is not partially compensating for the loss of lhfpl5b (Supplemental
Figure 3A-D). The loss of MET channel activity in lhfpl5bvo35 neuromasts is rescued by expression of
the GFP-lhfpl5a vo23Tg transgene (Figure 4I, J; n = 7/7 mutant individuals). This result indicates that
Lhfpl5a and Lhfpl5b are functionally interchangeable in this context.

We have previously reported a reduced number of neuromast hair cells in other transduction mutants
such as myo7aa (mariner), pcdh15a (orbiter), and tomt (mercury) (Erickson et al., 2017; Seiler et al.,
2005). The ultimate cause for this reduction in hair cell number is not known. If lhfpl5bvo35 mutants are
defective in mechanotransduction, we would expect a similar decrease in the number of neuromast hair
cells. To test this idea, we compared hair cell counts between wild type, lhfpl5atm290d, and lhfpl5bvo35
larvae at 5 dpf. As expected, wild type and lhfpl5atm290d mutants have statistically equivalent numbers
of hair cells in the neuromasts surveyed (Supplemental Figure 2D, p = 0.58). In lhfpl5bvo35 mutant
neuromasts, we observe a statistically significant decrease in the number of hair cells (Figure 4K,
n = 11 individuals per genotype, 3 NM each, p < 0.001 each NM type by Welch’s t-test; representative
neuromasts are shown in Supplemental Figure 4). This decrease in the number of neuromast hair cells
is consistent with lhfpl5b mutants being deficient in mechanotransduction in this cell type.

Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of LHFPL5 leads to a ~90% reduction in the peak
amplitude of the transduction current in mouse cochlear outer hair cells (Xiong et al., 2012). Single
channel recordings from Lhfpl5 mutants revealed that the remaining transduction current in Lhfpl5
mutants was mediated by TMC2 (Beurg et al., 2015). Using antibodies to detect endogenous protein,
TMC1 was found to be absent from the bundle of Lhfpl5 mouse mutants. However, injectoporated
Myc-TMC2 was still able to localize to the hair bundle, supporting the idea that LHFPL5 is required
for the targeting of TMC1, but not TMC2. The localization of exogenously-expressed TMC1 in Lhfpl5
mutants was not reported.

lhfpl5 is not required for Tmc localization to the hair bundle in zebrafish hair cells.

To determine if the Tmcs require Lhfpl5a for localization to the hair bundle of zebrafish hair cells, we
bred stable transgenic lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of Tmc1 (vo27Tg) and Tmc2b (vo28Tg)
(Erickson et al., 2017) into the lhfpl5atm290d mutant background and imaged Tmc localization in the
lateral cristae of the ear. In contrast to what was observed in mouse cochlear hair cells, both Tmc1GFP and Tmc2b-GFP are still targeted to the hair bundle in lhfpl5atm290d mutants (n = 11/11 and 9/9
individuals respectively; Figure 5A-D’). We also observe Tmc2b-GFP localization in the neuromast
hair bundles of lhfpl5bvo35 mutants (n = 7/7 individuals; Figure 5E-F’). Additionally, we do not observe
any rescue of hair cell function in lhfpl5b mutants expressing the Tmc2b-GFP protein (Supplemental
Figure 5A-C). As such, these results suggest that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b do not require Lhfpl5
for hair bundle localization in zebrafish hair cells.

Previous work has shown that PCDH15 and LHFPL5 are mutually dependent on one another to
correctly localize to the site of mechanotransduction in mouse cochlear hair cells (Mahendrasingam et
al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2012). Likewise in zebrafish, Lhfpl5a is required for proper Pcdh15a
localization in the hair bundle, as determined Pcdh15a immunostaining and the expression of a
Pcdh15a-GFP transgene in lhfpl5atm290d mutants (Maeda et al., 2017). Using the previously
characterized antibody against Pcdh15a, we observe the highest level of Pcdh15a staining at the apical
part of the hair bundle, with less intense punctate staining throughout the stereocilia in 3 dpf wild type
larvae (Figure 6A). lhfpl5atm290d mutants exhibit splayed hair bundles, with low levels of Pcdh15a
staining restricted to the tip of each stereocilium (n = 5/5 individuals; Figure 6B), confirming our
previous report.

To determine if Lhfpl5a also depends on Pcdh15a for its localization, we imaged GFP-Lhfpl5 in the
lateral cristae of pcdh15apsi7 homozygous mutants. In wild type larvae, GFP-Lhfpl5a is distributed
throughout the hair bundle at the tips of stereocilia (yellow arrow heads), with a higher intensity of
GFP evident in the tallest rows, possibly at the sites of kinociliary links (Figure 6C, C’, arrow). In
pcdh15apsi7 mutants, GFP-Lhfpl5a is absent from the hair bundle except for the tallest rows of
stereocilia adjacent to the kinocilium (n = 4 individuals; Figure 6D, D’, arrow). We observed similar
results using the pcdh15ath263b allele (n = 6/6 individuals; Supplemental Figure 6A, B). Consistent with
our earlier studies (Maeda et al., 2017; Seiler et al., 2005), we observe splayed hair bundles in both
pcdh15a alleles suggesting a loss of connections and tip links between the stereocilia. These results
indicate that GFP-Lhfpl5a requires Pcdh15a for stable targeting to the shorter stereocilia, but Pcdh15a
is not required for retaining GFP-Lhfpl5a in the tallest rows of stereocilia adjacent to the kinocilium.

The observation that some GFP-Lhfpl5a signal remains in the tallest stereocilia of pcdh15a mutants
suggests that additional proteins are involved in targeting Lhfpl5a to these sites in zebrafish vestibular
hair cells. Previous research has shown that mouse CDH23 still localizes to tips of stereocilia in
PCDH15-deficient mice (Boëda et al., 2002; Senften et al., 2006) and that CDH23 is a component of
kinociliary links (Goodyear et al., 2010; Siemens et al., 2004). Based on these reports, we tested
whether Cdh23 was required for GFP-Lhfpl5a localization. In cdh23nl9 mutants, GFP-Lhfpl5 is
sparsely distributed throughout the length of the kinocilium (n = 4/4 individuals, Figure 6E, E’). We
also observe a redistribution of GFP-Lhfpl5a into the kinocilium using the cdh23tj264 allele (n = 4/4
individuals; Supplemental Figure 6C). In both cdh23 alleles, we see occasional GFP signal in the
stereocilia as well, though this localization is not as robust. Interestingly, these results contrast with
those from mouse cochlear hair cells which showed that Lhfpl5 does not require Cdh23 for bundle
localization (Zhao et al., 2014). The same study also could not detect any biochemical interaction
between LHFPL5 and proteins of the upper tip link density including CDH23, USH1C / Harmonin, or

GFP-Lhfpl5a localization in stereocilia requires Pcdh15a, Cdh23, and Myo7aa.

Myosin 7A (MYO7A) is an actin-based motor protein required for the localization of many proteins
of the hair bundle, including PCDH15 and USH1C / Harmonin, along with several proteins of the
Usher type 2 complex (Boëda et al., 2002; Lefevre et al., 2008; Maeda et al., 2017; Morgan et al., 2016;
Senften et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2017). Results in both mice and zebrafish suggest that MYO7A is not
required for CDH23 bundle localization (Blanco-Sanchez et al., 2014; Senften et al., 2006). However,
its role in Lhfpl5 localization has not been examined. In myo7aaty220 (mariner) mutant hair cells, GFPLhfpl5a localization in hair bundle is severely disrupted (n = 5/5 individuals; Figure 6 F, F’). We
observe GFP signal near the base of hair bundles and occasionally in stereocilia (yellow arrowheads),
but do not see robust Lhfpl5a localization in the presumptive kinocilial links nor to the kinocilium
itself. Taken together, our results using the GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene suggest that Pcdh15a, Cdh23, and
Myo7aa all play distinct roles in Lhfpl5 localization in the bundle of zebrafish vestibular hair cells.

In this study, we provide support for the following points: 1) The ancestral lhfpl5 gene was likely
duplicated as a result of the teleost whole genome duplication, leading to the lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b
ohnologs described in this paper. 2) In zebrafish, there has been subfunctionalization of these genes as
a result of their divergent expression patterns. As determined by mRNA in situ hybridization, lhfpl5a
is expressed only in auditory and vestibular hair cells of the ear while lhfpl5b is expressed solely in
hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consistent with their expression patterns, we show that each ohnolog
mediates mechanotransduction in the corresponding populations of sensory hair cells in zebrafish. 3)
Targeting of GFP-tagged Tmcs to the hair bundle is independent of Lhfpl5a function. 4) Proper
targeting of GFP-tagged Lhfpl5a to the hair bundle requires the tip link protein Pcdh15a, but as in mice,
Lhfpl5a can localize to regions of the hair bundle independently of Pcdh15 function. Additionally, we
demonstrate novel requirements for Cdh23 and the Myo7aa motor protein in Lhfpl5 localization.

With regards to genes involved in hair cell function, the zebrafish duplicates of calcium channel,
voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1D (cacna1d / cav1.3), C-terminal binding protein 2 (ctbp2 / ribeye),
myosin 6 (myo6), otoferlin (otof), pcdh15, and tmc2 have been analyzed genetically. In the cases of
cacna1db, pcdh15b and myo6a, these ohnologs are no longer functional in hair cells (Seiler et al., 2004,
2005; Sidi et al., 2004). For the ctbp2, otoferlin, and tmc2 duplicates, both genes are required in at least
partially overlapping populations of hair cells (Chou et al., 2017; Lv et al., 2016; Maeda et al., 2014;
Sheets et al., 2011). In contrast, our results for the lhfpl5 ohnologs suggest that each gene is expressed
and functionally required in distinct, non-overlapping hair cell lineages. To our knowledge, this is the
first description of duplicated genes whose expression patterns have cleanly partitioned between inner
ear and lateral line hair cells.

We constructed a phylogenetic tree using publicly available Lhfpl5 protein sequence data (Figure 1)
Our results suggest that the ancestral lhfpl5 gene was duplicated during the teleost WGD event and that
both genes have been retained throughout the teleost lineage (Figure 1). Our conclusion that lhfpl5a
and lhfpl5b are ohnologs is substantiated by a recent study of ohnologs in teleosts (Singh and Isambert,
2019). In all four teleost species surveyed, Singh and Isambert show that lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b are true
ohnologs that arose from the teleost-specific WGD under the strictest criteria used in their study.

Some kind of selection pressure is required for the retention of both gene ohnologs (Glasauer and
Neuhauss, 2014). Our in situ hybridization results show that lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b are expressed in
distinct populations of hair cells and support the idea that the zebrafish lhfpl5 ohnologs were retained
because of their divergent expression patterns (Figure 2). Analysis of hair cell function in the different
lhfpl5 mutants agrees with the gene expression results, showing that lhfpl5a is required for transduction
in the ear while lhfpl5b plays the same role in the lateral line organs. However, rescue of the MET
channel defects in lhfpl5bvo35 mutants by GFP-tagged Lhfpl5a suggests that the functions of these
ohnologs are at least partially interchangeable. This result is not surprising given the high degree of
similarity between the Lhfpl5a and 5b proteins. As such, the subfunctionalization of the lhfpl5 ohnologs
appears to be caused by the divergence in their expression patterns rather than functional differences
in their protein products. It is possible that a similar mechanism is responsible for the retention of both
genes in other teleost species as well, though the expression patterns of the lhfpl5 ohnologs have not
been examined in other fish.

The non-overlapping expression of the lhfpl5 ohnologs provides us with a unique genetic tool to study
lateral line function. Most mechanotransduction mutants in zebrafish disrupt both inner ear and lateral
line hair cell function (Nicolson, 2017). As such, we are unable to assess the role of the lateral line
independently of auditory and vestibular defects, which are lethal for larval fish. The lhfpl5b mutants
are adult viable (data not shown) and represent a possible genetic model for understanding the lateral
line in both larval and adult fish. Future studies on adults will determine whether the lateral line remains
non-functional and whether lhfpl5b contributes to inner ear function in the mature auditory and
vestibular systems.

Our understanding of mechanotransduction at the molecular level is heavily informed by work done
using mouse cochlear hair cells. However, analysis of zebrafish inner ear and lateral line hair cells can
lead to a more complete picture of how vertebrate sensory hair cells form the MET complex. At their
core, the genetic and molecular bases for mechanotransduction are well conserved between mouse and
zebrafish hair cells. For example, the tip link proteins Cdh23 and Pcdh15a, MET channel subunits
Tmc1/2, Tmie, and Lhfpl5, along with additional factors such as Tomt, Cib2, and Myo7aa are all
necessary for MET channel function in both mice and fish (Cunningham et al., 2017; Erickson et al.,
2017; Giese et al., 2017; Gleason et al., 2009; Kawashima et al., 2011; Nicolson et al., 1998; Pacentine
and Nicolson, 2019; Senften et al., 2006; Siemens et al., 2004; Söllner et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2014). However, while each of these factors are required for mechanotransduction in
vertebrate hair cells, the details of how they contribute to MET channel function may differ depending
on the particular type of hair cell or the vertebrate species. For example, Tmie is required for Tmc
localization to the hair bundle in zebrafish (Pacentine and Nicolson, 2019), but this does not appear to
be the case in mouse cochlear hair cells (Zhao et al., 2014). The evolutionary pressures that lead to
these differences between mouse and zebrafish hair cells are not understood.

Based on multiple lines of evidence gathered from mice, TMC1 and TMC2 have different requirements
for LHFPL5 regarding localization to the hair bundle (Beurg et al., 2015). Endogenous TMC1 is absent
from the bundle in LHFPL5-deficient cochlear hair cells with the remaining MET current mediated
through TMC2. Exogenously-expressed TMC2 is still targeted correctly in Lhfpl5 mutants, but it was
not reported whether the same is true for exogenous TMC1, nor whether similar requirements hold for
vestibular hair cells. As such, the role of LHFPL5 in mechanotransduction is not clear: is LHFPL5

The molecular requirements for bundle localization of MET complex proteins differs
between mouse and zebrafish hair cells.

For our study, we used stable transgenic lines expressing GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b to show that
the Tmcs do not require Lhfpl5a for targeting to the stereocilia of zebrafish vestibular hair cells. Nor
is Lhfpl5b required for Tmc2b-GFP localization in the hair bundle of neuromast hair cells. The
occasional FM labeled-hair cell in lhfpl5b and lhfpl5a/5b mutant neuromasts is consistent with the
continued ability of the Tmcs to localize to the hair bundle. This observation is reminiscent of the
sporadic, low level of FM dye labeling in the cochlear hair cells of Lhfpl5 mutant mice (György et al.,
2017). Partial compensation by yet another member of the lhfpl family remains as a possible
explanation for the remaining basal channel function. Lastly, we find that exogenous Tmc expression
does not rescue MET channel activity in either lhfpl5 mutant zebrafish. Taken together, our results
support a Tmc-independent role for Lhfpl5 proteins in mechanotransduction.

What then is the role of LHFPL5 in vertebrate mechanotransduction? LHFPL5 and PCDH15 are known
to form a protein complex and regulate each other’s localization to the site of mechanotransduction in
mouse cochlear hair cells (Ge et al., 2018; Mahendrasingam et al., 2017; Xiong et al., 2012). However,
their localization to the hair bundle is not completely dependent on one another. For example, tips links
are not completely lost in Lhfpl5-/- cochlear hair cells and exogenous overexpression of PCDH15
partially rescues the transduction defects in Lhfpl5 mutant mice (Xiong et al., 2012). Similarly, a
detailed immunogold study in wild type and Pcdh15-/- cochlear hair cells showed that there are
PCDH15-dependent and PCDH15-independent sites of LHFPL5 localization (Mahendrasingam et al.,
2017). PCDH15 is required for stable LHFPL5 localization at the tips of ranked stereocilia in
association with the MET channel complex. However, LHFPL5 is still targeted to shaft and ankle links,
unranked stereocilia, and the kinocilium in P0-P3 inner and outer hair cells from both wild type and
Pcdh15-/- mutant mice (Mahendrasingam et al., 2017). Whether the kinocilial localization would
remain in mature cochlear hair cells is not known because the kinocilia degenerate by P8 in mice and
detailed LHFPL5 localization in vestibular hair cells (which retain their kinocilium) has not been
reported.

Zebrafish hair cells retain a kinocilium throughout their life, thus providing a different context in which
to examine Lhfpl5 localization. In wild type hair cells, GFP-Lhfpl5a is present at the tips of the shorter
ranked stereocilia, but the most robust signal is detected in the tallest stereocilia adjacent to the
kinocilium. In pcdh15a mutants, only this “kinocilial link”-like signal remains in the hair bundle. This
result is similar to the LHFPL5 localization reported at the tips of the tallest stereocilia of P3 cochlear
hair cells from wild type mice, a region where LHFPL5 would presumably not be associated with either
PCDH15 or the TMCs (Mahendrasingam et al., 2017). Since the kinocilium does not degenerate in
zebrafish hair cells, our results suggest that Lhfpl5a is normally targeted to these kinocilial links in
wild type cells and that its retention at this site does not require Pcdh15a. Thus, there are PCDH15dependent and PCDH15-independent mechanisms of LHFPL5 localization in both mouse and
zebrafish hair cells. These results suggest that LHFPL5 performs as-of-yet uncharacterized PCDH15independent functions as well.

Cdh23 is thought to form part of the linkages between the kinocilium and adjacent stereocilia, and
therefore may play a role in retaining Lhfpl5a at these sites. Consistent with this hypothesis, cdh23
mutants do not exhibit GFP-Lhfpl5a accumulation in stereocilia. Instead, GFP-Lhfpl5a is diffusely
distributed throughout the kinocilium. These data suggest that normal Lhfpl5a localization requires
both Pcdh15a and Cdh23 function, albeit in distinct ways. This result differs from previous reports
which found that Lhfpl5 still localized to the tips of stereocilia in CDH23-deficient cochlear hair cells

of mice. The same study also could not detect a biochemical interaction between Lhfpl5 and CDH23
via co-IP in heterologous cells (Xiong et al., 2012). Given these contrasting results for mouse and
zebrafish hair cells, it seems that the requirement for Cdh23 in the localization of LHFPL5 is not a
universal one.

Given the available biochemical evidence, it is possible that the association between Lhfpl5a and
Cdh23 is indirect through an as-of-yet unidentified protein or protein complex. Based on the defects in
GFP-Lhfpl5a localization in myo7aa mutants, Myo7aa is a candidate member of this uncharacterized
protein complex. Taken together, these results highlight the fact that, although all sensory hair cells
share many core genetic and biochemical features, there are important details that differ between the
various types of hair cells and between vertebrate species. Analyzing these differences will allow for
a more comprehensive understanding of vertebrate hair cell function and the underlying principles of
mechanotransduction.
