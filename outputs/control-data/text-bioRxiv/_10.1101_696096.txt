ABSTRACT
Understanding how cell sub-populations in a tissue impact the function of the overall system is often
challenging. There is extensive heterogeneity among insulin-secreting β-cells within islets of
Langerhans, including their insulin secretory response and gene expression profile; and this
heterogeneity can be altered in diabetes. Several studies have identified variations in nutrient sensing
between β-cells, including glucokinase (GK) levels, mitochondrial function or expression of genes
important for glucose metabolism. Sub-populations of β-cells with defined electrical properties can
disproportionately influence islet-wide free-calcium activity ([Ca2+]) and insulin secretion, via gap
junction electrical coupling. However, it is poorly understood how sub-populations of β-cells with
altered glucose metabolism may impact islet function. To address this, we utilized a multicellular
computational model of the islet in which a population of cells deficient in GK activity and glucose
metabolism was imposed on the islet, or where β-cells were heterogeneous in glucose metabolism and
GK kinetics were altered. This included simulating Glucokinase gene (GCK) mutations that cause
monogenic diabetes. We combined these approaches with experimental models in which gck was
genetically deleted in a population of cells or GK was pharmacologically inhibited. In each case we
modulated gap junction electrical coupling. Both the simulated islet and the experimental system
required 30-50% of the cells to have near-normal glucose metabolism. Below this number, the islet
lacked any glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] elevations. In the absence of electrical coupling the change in
[Ca2+] was more gradual. As such, given heterogeneity in glucose metabolism, electrical coupling allows
a large minority of cells with normal glucose metabolism to promote glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. If
insufficient numbers of cells are present, which we predict can be caused by a subset of GCK mutations
that cause monogenic diabetes, electrical coupling exacerbates [Ca2+] suppression. This demonstrates
precisely how heterogeneous β-cell populations interact to impact islet function.

SIGNIFICANCE
Biological tissues contain heterogeneous populations of cells. Insulin-secreting β-cells within the islets
of Langerhans are critical for regulating blood glucose homeostasis. β-cells are heterogeneous but it is
unclear how the islet response is impacted by different cell populations and their interactions. We use a
multicellular computational model and experimental systems to predict and quantify how cellular
populations defined by varied glucose metabolism interact via electrical communication to impact islet
function. When glucose metabolism is heterogeneous, electrical coupling is critical to promote electrical
activity. However, when cells deficient in glucose metabolism are in the majority, electrical activity is
completely suppressed. Thus modulating electrical communication can promotes islet electrical activity,
following dysfunction caused by gene mutations that impact glucose metabolism.

INTRODUCTION
Most biological tissues are multi-cellular systems where a diverse range of cellular elements function
collectively through dynamic interactions. Understanding the function of such a multicellular system
requires understanding the characteristics of the constituent cell population and the way in which these
populations interact over a defined architecture. As such the dynamics of multicellular systems often
show complex emergent behaviors [1-4]. Many diseases can arise from genetic variations that impact
molecular and cellular function. Given the complexities of multi-cellular systems, effectively predicting
how molecular and cellular dysfunction lead to tissue and organ dysfunction, and cause disease is
challenging.
The islets of Langerhans are micro-organs located within the pancreas that are critical for
regulating blood glucose homeostasis. Complex multicellular dynamics occur between insulin-secreting
β-cells and other endocrine cell types that underlie regulated hormone secretion. Death or dysfunction
of β-cells that results in a reduction or absence of insulin secretion is the main cause of diabetes. Glucose
metabolism and cellular excitability are key features of β-cell insulin secretion. Specifically, upon
elevated blood glucose, glucose is transported into the β-cell and phosphorylated by the low affinity
hexokinase, glucokinase (GK), which is the rate limiting step in glucose metabolism [5]. The increase
in ATP/ADP inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, causing membrane depolarization, activation
of voltage-gated calcium channels and generating bursts of action potentials. The elevated oscillations
in intracellular free-calcium activity ([Ca2+]) trigger pulses of insulin granule exocytosis [6-8]. In the
absence of elevated ATP/ADP KATP channels remain open hyperpolarizing the cell, preventing voltage
gated calcium channel activation and suppressing [Ca2+].
β-cells in the islet are electrically coupled by Connexin36 (Cx36) gap junction channels [9-11].
As a result of electrical coupling, β-cells exhibit coordinated [Ca2+] oscillations under elevated glucose
and are uniformly silent under basal glucose [9,11-14]. β-cells are functionally heterogeneous, showing
variations in electrical activity and insulin secretion [15-18], as well as varying gene expression profiles
[19-21]. However as a result of electrical coupling, β-cells within the islet show near-identical [Ca2+]
responses and oscillatory dynamics [11]. Nevertheless, the overall [Ca2+] response across the islet can
be impacted by β-cell populations. In a normal islet nearly all β-cells are capable of responding to
elevated glucose. However, a small number of inexcitable cells that remain hyper-polarized at elevated
glucose can reverse this response and silence the whole islet [22-24]. Conversely a small number of
highly excitable cells alone may be support the uniformly elevated [Ca2+] dynamics [25]. Understanding
how different cell populations, characterized by different molecular signatures, interact and affect overall
islet function is lacking.
We and others have previously examined how heterogeneity in KATP channel activity and
electrical coupling impact overall islet [Ca2+] [9,22,24,26]. However, both single-cell based studies and
in-situ analysis have demonstrated that β-cells exhibit substantial heterogeneity in glucose metabolism
[27], which includes varying GK expression [21,25,28], metabolic fluxes [29-32], or mitochondrial
function [19,21]. While extensive heterogeneity in glucose metabolism exists within the islet, it is not
clear how cell sub-populations with differing GK expression or levels of glucose metabolism influence
each other via electrical coupling.
Computational models have been utilized to examine how islet function is impacted by different
cellular populations. For example, the frequency of islet [Ca2+] oscillations can be predicted by the
relative numbers of slow-oscillating and fast-oscillating β-cells and their electrical coupling [33,34]. In
the presence of a broad heterogeneous population, electrical coupling was also suggested to sharpen the
islet response [34]. We predicted this concept computationally, where electrical coupling allows the islet
to withstand a critical number of inexcitable cells and show near-normal glucose-stimulated [Ca2+].
Beyond this critical number, the islet sharply transitions to lack any glucose responsiveness [22,26],
despite there being a population of β-cells that would otherwise be capable of responding to glucose.

Computational models have also predicted that electrical coupling increases the impact of human KATP
channel mutations that cause neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) [26]. These models predicted islet
dysfunction was reversible upon modulating electrical coupling for many mutations, by allowing a
population of β-cells to show [Ca2+] elevations. Mutations to GCK which reduce its activity can cause
monogenic diabetes, either mature onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or NDM [35,36]. Prior
computational studies therefore suggest that electrical coupling may play an important role upon
heterogeneity to GK activity, including mediating how mutations to GCK impact islet function.
In this study we apply experimental and computational approaches to examine the role of gap
junction mediated electrical coupling between β-cells in the presence of heterogeneity to GK activity.
We examine how a defined population deficient in GK and glucose metabolism impacts islet function
and how electrical coupling mediates the impact of this sub-population. We also examine how electrical
coupling between a broad heterogeneous population of cells impacts islet function, and compare this
with endogenous heterogeneity in the islet. Finally, we predict how human GCK mutations impact islet
function, and the role that heterogeneity in glucose metabolism and electrical coupling play in mediating
the impact of these mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics Statement– All experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and
institutional guidelines and were approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Biosafety
Committee (IBC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, B-95817(05)1D).
Animal Care– The generation of GKlox/lox (Glucokinase with loxP sites flanking exon2); Pdx-CreER (βcell specific inducible Cre); and Cx36-/- (Connexin36 global knockout) have been described previously
[37-39]. Expression of variable GK deficiency was achieved by crossing GKlox/lox and Pdx-CreER mice,
and inducing GK deletion in 8-24 week old mice by 1-5 daily doses of tamoxifen (50mg/kg bodyweight
or 5mg/kg bodyweight as indicated) administered IP. Littermates lacking Pdx-CreER, lacking GK loxP
sites, or wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. Mice were held in a temperature-controlled
environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum.
In-Vivo Measurements–Blood glucose was measured 3/week using a glucometer (Ascensia Contour,
Bayer), and averaged over day 10-15 post-tamoxifen induction. Plasma insulin was measured at day 15
post-tamoxifen induction, from plasma extracted from blood samples centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000
rpm at 4°C and assayed using mouse ultrasensitive insulin ELISA (Alpco).
Islet Isolation– Pancreas dissection and islet isolation were performed in mice under Ketamine/Xylazine
anesthesia that were subsequently euthanized via exsanguination and cervical dislocation or bilateral
thoracotomy. Islets were isolated by collagenase injection into the pancreas through the pancreatic duct;
the pancreas was harvested and digested, and islets were handpicked [40,41]. Islets were maintained in
RPMI medium at 11mM glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100U/ml penicillin,
100μg/ml streptomycin, at 37oC under humidified 5% CO2 for 24-48 hours prior to study.
Calcium Imaging– Isolated islets were loaded with 4M Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) for 45min at 37oC in
imaging medium (125mM NaCl, 5.7mM KCl, 2.5mM CaCl2, 1.2mM MgCl2, 10mM Hepes, 2mM
glucose, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) and were imaged in 35mm glass bottom dishes maintained at 37°C.
Fluo-4 fluorescence was imaged on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM800) with a 40x 1.2 NA water
immersion objective, 488nm diode laser for excitation, and 490-550nm band-pass emission filter. Images
were acquired at 1 frame/sec for 2min at 2mM glucose and for 5min at 11mM glucose after 15min of
glucose stimulation. 20mM KCl was then added during continuous imaging. Microscope settings
(integration time, scan time, gain, laser power) were constant for all images collected within the same
day. For mannoheptulose (MH) experiments, after imaging islets at 11mM glucose, islets were imaged
for 5min, after either 3, 5, or 10mM MH was applied for 15min at 11mM glucose.
NAD(P)H imaging– NADH(P)H autofluorescence was imaged under two-photon excitation using a
tunable mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon) set to 710nm for excitation. Fluorescence
emission was detected at 425-475 nm using a non-descanned detector. A z-stack of 6 images were taken
at 2m intervals starting 10m from the bottom of the islet. Images were acquired at both 2mM and
15min after 20mM glucose stimulation. Microscope settings (scan time, gain, laser power) were constant
for all images collected within the same day.
Image Analysis– All images were analyzed using custom MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts. For calcium
imaging, a 5x5 smoothing filter was first applied. Areas with very low to no fluorophore staining were
excluded from analysis by excluding pixels at or below the average fluorescence of a manually chosen
background area. Saturated areas were also removed by limiting the area to intensities below the
maximum. To determine if a cell was active, a peak detection algorithm was used to determine if areas

of the islet had peak amplitudes greater than 1.5 times the average of quiescent reference cells [32]. A
quiescent reference cell (or background region if no cells were quiescent) was chosen manually, and
showed no significant fluctuations in intensity during the entire time course. The fraction of active area
was then calculated as the number of pixels detected as active relative to the total number of pixels that
were not excluded as background in the defined islet. Activity maps are presented in HSV format, with
the hue representing the [Ca2+] oscillation synchronization, as described previously [11]. Briefly, crosscorrelation coefficients (between 0-1) were calculated between every pixel area and a reference
consisting of the average [Ca2+] fluorescence of the whole islet. This was calculated only for areas of the
islet determined as active (see above). For MH treatments, [Ca2+] activity was normalized to the activity
of the islet at 11mM glucose.
NAD(P)H images were analyzed by averaging the intensity across the z-stack for the islet. For
each experimental condition these intensity values were normalized to mean NAD(P)H intensity at 2mM
of islets from control mice that were acquired on the same day. The average intensity at 2mM was
subtracted from the average intensity at 20mM to obtain the NAD(P)H response for the islet.
Coupled β-cell Electrical Activity Model– The coupled β-cell model with and without stochastic noise was

described previously [26] and adapted from the published Cha-Noma single cell model [42,43], with
modifications to the ATP dependence as previously described [44]. All code was written in C++ and run
on JANUS (University of Colorado Boulder) or Rosalind (University of Colorado Denver)
supercomputers. Model code is included in the Supporting Information (Supplemental Information, File
S1).

active if membrane potential, Vm exceeded -45mV. The fraction of cells that were active was determined
relative to the total number of simulated cells (1000).
Duty Cycle was determined as the fraction of the [Ca2+] oscillations spent above a threshold value
during the time course analyzed. This threshold value was determined as 50% of the average amplitude
at 11mM glucose with no changes in rate of glycolysis. Duty cycle was reported as the average across
all cells in the simulated islet.
Average parameters within a population of cells were calculated using a single simulation when
the islet lacked electrical coupling (gcoup=0pS) and when a fraction of the cells were active. This
corresponds to either PMut=0.50 (Fig.1) or 𝑘
1 .65 ∙ 𝑘 (Fig.3). Each parameter was
averaged over time where applicable, and across all GK- cells/GK+ cells (Fig.1) or active/non-active
cells (Fig.3).
When simulation results were binned according to OGTT values, ‘mild’ mutations had a 2h
OGTT result of <145mg/dL, ‘moderate’ mutations had an OGTT result of 145mg/dL-175mg/dL, and
‘severe’ mutations had an OGTT value of >175mg/dL. Simulation results were also binned according to
HbA1c and were characterized as mild if HbA1c <6.5%, moderate if HbA1c was 6.5-7.0% and severe
if HbA1c >7.0%.
Statistical analysis– All statistical analysis was performed in Prism (Graphpad). Either a Student’s t-test
or a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-hoc analysis was utilized to test for significant differences
between [Ca2+] activity, ΔNAD(P)H, plasma insulin, blood glucose, and simulation results. Matched
pairs of Cx36+/+ and Cx36-/- islets were chosen as islets imaged on the same day and a paired t-test was
used to determine significance. If uneven numbers of islets with the same genotype were imaged on the
same day, their results were averaged before the paired t-test was performed. Linear regression was used
to evaluate the correlation between [Ca2+] activity, plasma insulin, or blood glucose vs. ΔNAD(P)H.
Outliers were removed from experimental data sets based on the interquartile range (IQR). Data was first
grouped by genotype, then outliers identified as any data point outside of [Q1 – 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR]
where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartiles, respectively. Data is reported as mean  s.e.m. (standard
error in the mean) or mean  SD (standard deviation) where indicated. For data in Figure 5e and S6 some
groups failed normality by an Anderson-Darling normality test (MATLAB) and therefore a nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) and Dunn’s post-hoc analysis was used. Data is reported as mean
 s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated.

RESULTS
Computational model predicts how discrete populations of metabolically deficient cells impact islet
function. Previous studies have demonstrated how excitable and inexcitable cells (defined by KATP
channel activity) interact within the islet via electrical coupling. Given that glucose metabolism varies
extensively between previously identified β-cell sub-populations, we first set out to examine how cells
with high and low levels of glucose metabolism interact. We simulated islets at elevated glucose with
varying numbers of cells lacking GK activity. Simulated islets with normal electrical coupling and
normal GK activity showed elevated [Ca2+] with coordinated oscillatory dynamics closely matching
previously published models [11,22,42,59] (Fig. 1a). As the number of cells lacking GK activity (GK-)
increased in number up to ~40% of GK- cells, the simulated islet retained normal coordinated [Ca2+]
elevations albeit with a reduced plateau fraction (Fig. 1b). However above ~50% GK- cells, the simulated
islet lacked elevation in [Ca2+] (Fig. 1c), with all remaining GK+ cells remaining silent. In the absence
of electrical coupling, as the number of GK- cells was increased, the disruption to [Ca2+] was more
gradual (Fig. 1a-c), with all remaining GK+ cells responding. Thus, with fewer than ~40% GK- cells, the
absence of electrical coupling diminished [Ca2+] compared to in the presence of coupling (Fig. 1d).
However, with greater than 50% GK- cells, the absence of electrical coupling increased [Ca2+]. Simulated
GK- cells showed reduced ATP and NADH levels, but normal total KATP conductance (Fig. 1e).
Thus, simulations predict the islet requires ~50% of the cells to have near-normal glucose
metabolism to show glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. Below this number, the islet will sharply transition to
lack any glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. However, in the absence of electrical coupling the change in [Ca2+]
is gradual and only cells with near-normal glucose metabolism will show glucose-stimulated [Ca2+].

deficient in GK activity (GK-) at 50% GK- cells. Error bars in E represent standard deviation over 500 cells. All simulations
were run at 11mM glucose. Scale bar in A-C represents 0.5μM.

Experimentally testing how discrete populations of metabolically deficient cells impact islet
function. To experimentally test these computational model predictions, we used a mouse model where
GK deficiency is induced in a population of β-cells. We focused on testing: 1) That the threshold number
of GK deficient cells required to sharply suppress islet [Ca2+] is ~50%; and 2) That above this threshold
number of GK deficient cells, a loss of gap junction electrical coupling elevates [Ca2+].
GKlox/lox;Pdx-CreER mice received doses of tamoxifen totaling between 10mg/kg body weight
(bw) and 250mg/kg bw. For tamoxifen doses 50-250mg/kg bw, blood glucose levels elevated
significantly compared to control mice (see methods), with no significant difference in blood glucose
between groups within this range (Supplemental Information, Figure S1). Below this dosage (1025mg/kg bw) mice remained euglycemic, similar to control mice. Plasma insulin levels were
significantly lower than control mice for tamoxifen doses 50-250mg/kg bw (Figure S1).
We isolated islets from these GKlox/lox;Pdx-CreER mice and control mice that received varying
tamoxifen dosages. We performed two-photon imaging of NAD(P)H to assess changes in the islet
metabolic response (Fig. 2a). The NAD(P)H response decreased with increasing tamoxifen dosage (Fig.
2a), where doses 50-250mg/kg bw were significantly lower than in controls (Fig. 2b). This showed good
correlation with blood glucose and plasma insulin (Figure S1). We also performed [Ca2+] imaging to
assess changes in the islet electrical response (Fig. 2c). Doses of 10-25mg/kg bodyweight did not
significantly impact [Ca2+], with coordinated [Ca2+] oscillations remaining showing varying patterns of
slow or fast oscillations. In contrast, doses of 50-250mg/kg bw led to significantly lower [Ca2+] than in
controls (Fig. 2d,e). However, the remaining [Ca2+] elevations were coordinated, indicating electrical
coupling was not substantially diminished (Fig. 2e). For doses 50-250mg/kg bw KCl treatment elevated
[Ca2+] across the majority of the islet, equivalent to in control islets (Fig. 2f), indicating that the
disruption to [Ca2+] is due to an absence of metabolic-regulation of KATP and not due to cell death or dedifferentiation.
The greatest decline in glucose-stimulated [Ca2+], from ~70% to ~20% of the islet showing
elevated [Ca2+], occurred between 25 and 50mg/kg bw tamoxifen dosage. Given the lack of an associated
fluorescent reporter, we were unable to directly quantify the % of cells showing GK deletion. However,
the sharp decline in [Ca2+] occurred around an NAD(P)H response of approximately 0.15-0.2 (Fig. 2f),
which is approximately 30-50% of the mean NAD(P)H response in control islets (Fig. 2b). This suggests
that a sudden decline in [Ca2+] occurs upon a 50-70% loss in metabolic activity, which is equivalent to
a complete loss of metabolic activity in 50-70% of cells. This is consistent with the simulated islet results
(Fig. 1), where greater than 50% GK- metabolically deficient cells leads to a dramatic decrease in [Ca2+].
We next tested whether a decrease in Cx36 and electrical coupling can increase [Ca2+] for levels
of GK deletion above the threshold at which [Ca2+] is suppressed. We examined islets from age-matched
GKlox/lox;Pdx-CreER;Cx36+/+ and GKlox/lox;Pdx-CreER;Cx36-/- mice following tamoxifen injection.
50mg/kg bw tamoxifen is the smallest dose that led to markedly decreased [Ca2+] in the presence of
Cx36 (Fig. 2d). At this dose similar NAD(P)H responses were observed in the presence and absence of
Cx36, consistent with similar GK deletion (Fig. 2g). Despite this there was a significant elevation in
[Ca2+] activity in islets lacking Cx36, consistent with simulation predictions (Fig. 2h). Islets from mice
treated with either lower tamoxifen doses where islet [Ca2+] is near normal (25mg/kg bw), or higher
doses where islet [Ca2+] is suppressed (250mg/kg bw), showed similar [Ca2+] irrespective of Cx36. This
is also consistent with model predictions.
Therefore, islets lacking GK in a sub-population of metabolically deficient β-cells, show
behavior in good agreement with computational model predictions. There exists a threshold number of
~50% β-cells in which GK deficiency causes a sharp suppression in [Ca2+]; and this suppression depends
on gap junction electrical coupling.

Computational model predicts how a distribution of metabolically active/inactive populations
impact islet function. We have examined how the islet responds with 2 distinct cell populations, with
either elevated metabolic activity (normal GK) or deficient metabolic activity (deficient GK). While
some studies have suggested distinct sub-populations exist within the islet with differing metabolic
activity [19,25], other studies have demonstrated a continuous distribution of metabolic activity is
present [29,31]. Within a continuous distribution, a ‘metabolically deficient’ population of cells may fall

below some threshold metabolic activity required for stimulating [Ca2+]. We therefore simulated islets
with a continuous distribution of GK activity between cells. With a normal distribution of GK activity,
elevated [Ca2+] with coordinated oscillatory dynamics were observed in the presence of electrical
coupling, but these oscillatory dynamics lacked coordination in the absence of electrical coupling (Fig.
3a). As the mean GK activity was reduced in the presence of electrical coupling, coordinated [Ca2+]
elevations were maintained until a certain decrease in GK activity, at which point there was a transition
to a complete absence of [Ca2+] elevation (Fig. 3b-d). In the absence of electrical coupling the decline in
[Ca2+] was more gradual as GK activity was reduced (Fig. 3b-d). The change in NAD(P)H, indicating
metabolic activity, was similar across the islet in the presence and absence of electrical coupling (Fig.
3e). As such, when the decrease in GK activity was low (<70% decrease), and the islet was metabolically
active, the absence of electrical coupling decreased [Ca2+] as some cells lacked elevated [Ca2+] (Fig.
3d,f). However, with greater decreases in GK activity (>70%) such that the islet was metabolically
deficient, the absence of electrical coupling increased [Ca2+] as some cells maintained elevated [Ca2+].
In the absence of electrical coupling, the population of cells where [Ca2+] elevations remained had
slightly higher metabolic activity (higher kgly, NADH levels), and lower KATP open channel conductance
(gKATP) (Fig. 3g) and thus were more excitable. When excluding heterogeneity in gKATP, similar
observations were made when GK activity was reduced (Figure S2): the population of cells where [Ca2+]
elevations remained had higher metabolic activity (higher kgly, NADH levels). Thus elevated metabolic
activity was sufficient for the cells to be more excitable.
GK kinetics can be impacted in additional ways, such as substrate affinity [60]. To understand
more generally how islet function can be impacted by changes in GK activity, we simulated islets with
other perturbations to GK kinetics. When the affinity for glucose is reduced (increasing KG), the islet
showed uniform elevated [Ca2+] until the affinity was reduced ~2-fold (KG increased by ~70%), at which
point [Ca2+] declined sharply (Fig. 3h). In the absence of electrical coupling the decline in [Ca2+] was
more gradual (Fig. 3h), where the population of cells where [Ca2+] elevations remained had higher
metabolic activity (higher NADH), and lower KATP open channel conductance (gKATP) (Fig. 3i).
Reducing the affinity for ATP (by increasing KmATP) or increasing the hill coefficient for glucose affinity
had much weaker effects on islet activity (Figure S3). Inclusion of stochastic noise under conditions of
decreased GK activity also elevated [Ca2+] (Figure S3), consistent with prior predictions [26].
Thus, upon a distribution of cellular metabolic activity, similar results were observed as with 2
distinct populations of cells. The islet transitions from islet-wide [Ca2+] elevations to a complete lack of
[Ca2+] according to the mean GK level: a lower mean GK level results in more cells falling into being
metabolically deficient. The simulations specifically predict the islet requires >30% of the cells to have
near-normal glucose metabolism to show islet-wide glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. This behavior again
depends on electrical coupling, where in the absence of electrical coupling the decline is gradual and
excitable cells with near-normal glucose metabolism remain active.

Experimentally testing how endogenous metabolically active/inactive populations impact islet
function. To experimentally test these model predictions, we reduced GK activity across the islet with
the GK inhibitor mannoheptulose (MH), in the presence (Cx36+/+) and absence (Cx36-/-) of gap junction
coupling. In both the presence and absence of gap junction coupling, increasing concentrations of MH
decreased [Ca2+] (Fig. 4a-c). In islets from Cx36+/+ mice the decline in [Ca2+] was modest for low MH
concentrations (3mM), but a substantial decline occured between 3 and 5mM MH, and no further decline
between 5 and 10mM MH (Fig. 4d). However, in islets from Cx36-/- mice the decline in [Ca2+] was more
gradual up to the maximal 10mM MH. At 5mM MH, where [Ca2+] was almost completely suppressed
in islets from Cx36+/+ mice, [Ca2+] was significantly higher in islets from Cx36-/- mice, where ~30% of

cells continued to show elevated [Ca2+] (Fig. 4d). For all MH treatments, the NAD(P)H response was
similar between islets from Cx36+/+ mice and Cx36-/- mice (Fig. 4e), indicating the differences in [Ca2+]
are not a result of differing metabolic activity, which is consistent with simulated data (Fig. 3e).
Thus, good agreement with simulations that demonstrates a sharp decrease in [Ca2+] in the
presence of gap junction electrical coupling as a result of decreased GK activity; but a gradual decrease
in [Ca2+] in the absence of gap junction coupling. There is also good agreement with simulations, where
30-40% of cells maintain elevated [Ca2+] in the absence of gap junction coupling for a level of GK
activity sufficient to suppress [Ca2+] in the presence of gap junction coupling.

Computational predictions for gap junction coupling and GCK mutations that cause diabetes. Our
results so far indicate that gap junction electrical coupling substantially impacts islet function when GK
activity is heterogeneous. This includes enabling a large minority of metabolically active cells to increase
[Ca2+] across the islet, and exacerbating the decline in [Ca2+] when a majority of cells show deficient
GK and metabolic activity. We next applied our computational model to examine the role of electrical
coupling in the presence of specific GCK mutations that cause NDM or MODY. We simulated the islet
in the presence of electrical coupling and included altered GK kinetics based upon the biochemical
characterization of a set of GCK mutations that cause MODY or PNDM (Table S1) [36,45-58]. The
majority of PNDM GCK mutations (4/5) fully suppressed [Ca2+] at elevated glucose (Fig. 5a). In
comparison, only a sub-set of MODY GCK mutations (~35%) suppressed [Ca2+] at elevated glucose
(Fig. 5b, Figure S4), showing more moderate impact than PNDM mutations (Fig. 5c). When accounting
for MODY mutations being single allele variants, and thus modeling half of GK with normal kinetics,
MODY GCK mutations reduced the [Ca2+] oscillation plateau fraction compared to controls (Figure S5).
We next compared simulation predictions for the impact of GCK mutations with corresponding
clinical assessments for the loss of glucose control. We specifically examined a set of mutations for
which patients had received oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and segmented the mutations into 3

classes (‘mild’, ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’) according to the level of glucose intolerance (2h blood glucose)
(Fig. 5d). ~50% of both mild and moderate mutations suppressed [Ca2+]. However, all severe mutations
suppressed [Ca2+] (Fig. 5e). When accounting for MODY mutations being single allele variants, the
[Ca2+] oscillation plateau fraction was reduced to a greater degree by severe mutations compared to
mild/moderate mutations (Fig. 5f). Similar results in terms of suppression of [Ca2+] or impact on [Ca2+]
oscillation plateau fraction were observed considering HbA1c, albeit with reduced difference between
mild, moderate and severe mutations (Figure S6). These data show a good correlation between the
clinical severity of GCK mutations and the simulated impact on [Ca2+].
With this agreement we examined the impact of electrical coupling on [Ca2+] upon GCK
mutations. We simulated all MODY and PNDM mutations in the absence of electrical coupling and
compared [Ca2+] to simulations in the presence of electrical coupling (Figure S4). No PNDM mutation
showed a change in [Ca2+], but a subset of MODY mutations (~10%) showed changes in [Ca2+] in the
absence of electrical coupling (Fig. 5g,h). This impact of removing electrical coupling included increases
in [Ca2+] for a subset of mutations in which [Ca2+] was normally suppressed; a reduction in [Ca2+] for
different mutations in which [Ca2+] remained active (Fig. 5h,i). Thus, gap junction mediated electrical
coupling plays a partial role in mediating islet dysfunction caused by GCK mutations.

DISCUSSION
β-cells in the islet respond collectively to glucose, despite the individual β-cells themselves being highly
heterogeneous. Prior studies have demonstrated that small changes in the oscillatory properties or
glucose-responsiveness of individual β-cells can lead to large changes in the collective behavior of the
whole islet [22,25,32,33]. Heterogeneity in metabolic activity between β-cells is extensive [28,29,31].
In this study we controlled the heterogeneity in GK activity between β-cells to examine how electrical
coupling between metabolically heterogeneous cells impacts islet function. Using computational models
and experimental systems, we discovered that small changes in the number of cells with deficient GK
and glucose metabolism led to large changes in islet [Ca2+]. Electrical coupling was important, mediating
either the recruitment of metabolically deficient cells to show elevated [Ca2+], or meditating the
suppression of metabolically active cells to supress [Ca2+]. Based on these results, computational models
further predicted a role for changes in electrical coupling to impact islet dysfunction in monogenic
diabetes that results from mutations to GCK.
Cell heterogeneity and phase transitions within the islet network.
Our previous work examined the impact of heterogeneity in KATP channel activity in the islet, using
computational models and experimental systems [22,61]. β-cells were rendered inexcitable via
expression of mutant KATP channels that do not close in response to elevated metabolism, thus
hyperpolarizing the cell. As the number of these inexcitable β-cells was progressively increased, the islet
initially showed near-normal responses. However, at some critical number of inexcitable cells there was
a sharp transition between islet-wide [Ca2+] elevations and complete suppression of [Ca2+]. Here, our
computational and experimental results demonstrate similar findings. As the number of metabolically
deficient cells, caused by reduced or absent GK activity, is increased beyond a critical threshold (4050%) there is a sharp transition between islet-wide [Ca2+] elevations and complete suppression of [Ca2+].
The remaining cells with normal GK are suppressed via electrical coupling by the metabolically deficient
cells. This is supported by results in the absence of coupling where remaining metabolically active cells
show elevated [Ca2+] (Fig. 1). Our experimental results are consistent with these findings: the lowest
level of GK deletion (in ~50% of cells) sufficient to suppress islet [Ca2+] shows elevated [Ca2+] in the
absence of gap junction coupling (Fig. 2).
We observed similar results whether GK activity was partially reduced across all cells in the islet
(Figs. 3,4). Computationally (Fig. 3), there was a level of GK reduction at which there existed a sharp
transition between islet-wide [Ca2+] elevations and complete suppression of [Ca2+]. This transition
occurred where 30-40% of cells have sufficient metabolic activity to show [Ca2+] elevations if
electrically isolated. Experimentally (Fig. 4), the lowest concentration of mannoheptulose that was
sufficient to fully suppress islet [Ca2+] (5mM), only suppressed [Ca2+] in a sub-set of cells in the absence
of gap junction coupling, leaving ~30% of cells remaining active. The correspondence between
computational and experimental results (Figure S7) indicates the presence of broad metabolic
heterogeneity within the islet. Thus, when GK activity is partially inhibited, less metabolically active
cells will have insufficient glucose metabolism to elevate [Ca2+], whereas more metabolically active
cells will have sufficient glucose metabolism to elevate [Ca2+]. If there are sufficient numbers of cells
capable of elevating [Ca2+] (predicted to be 30-50%, Figure S7), they can resist being suppressed by less
metabolically active cells, and the islet can elevate [Ca2+]. These findings are summarized in Figure 6.
Of note we do observe differences in this study compared to prior studies. Previously, when
examining heterogeneity in KATP channel activity the number of inexcitable cells (cells with elevated
KATP activity) required to suppress [Ca2+] across the islet was 20-40% (depending whether KATP
overactivity was in a defined population of cells or broadly distributed [61]). This number is smaller than
the number of metabolically deficient cells required to suppress islet-wide [Ca2+], which was 50-70%.
Thus, populations of metabolically deficient cells are less effective at suppressing islet [Ca2+] than cells
17

with elevated KATP activity. Conversely, this means smaller populations of metabolically active cells are
effective at stimulating islet [Ca2+] which has significant implications for the role of metabolic
heterogeneity in islet function (see discussion below). The residual ATP levels in metabolic deficient
cells will partially close KATP channels, and therefore cells with elevated KATP activity may transmit
greater hyperpolarizing current across the islet compared to metabolically deficient cells. Furthermore,
in our model elevated ATP also regulates voltage-gated calcium channel (ICaV) activity, thus providing
additional depolarization and Ca2+ entry at elevated glucose. Thus, cells with increased GK and
metabolic activity may also transmit greater depolarizing current across the islet compared to cells with
lower KATP activity. Since we were unable to precisely measure NADH changes on a cell-by-cell basis,
we also cannot exclude the presence of metabolic coupling.
Therefore, following changes in glucose metabolism, a certain number of β-cells will show
sufficient metabolism to elevate [Ca2+]. If this is above some critical number then the islet will elevate
[Ca2+], whereas below this number a complete loss of glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] occurs. In the absence
of electrical coupling, the population of β-cells with sufficient metabolism to elevate [Ca2+] will not be
suppressed. These cells have sufficient GK activity for ATP generation and KATP closure, but may also
have low KATP conductance, or other factors that promote elevated electrical activity and insulin release.

Implications for Islet Physiology
It has long been known that β-cells in the islet are functionally heterogeneous [16], including
heterogeneity in GK expression, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function [28,30,31]. Recently

using transcriptome, protein labelling, surface markers or fluorescent reporters, specific subpopulations
have been defined with diminished GK expression or reduced mitochondrial function or glucose
metabolism [27]. Our results indicate quantitatively how changes in the proportion of these cell subpopulations with deficient GK or glucose metabolism will impact islet function. Assuming the electrical
coupling remains unchanged between sub-populations, the islet will remain tolerant to cells low in
glucose metabolism and recruit these deficient cells to show elevated [Ca2+]. However, when they form
a substantial majority (above 50-70%) islet electrical activity will be disrupted.
That the majority of β-cells need to be deficient in glucose metabolism for islet [Ca2+] to be
suppressed means that gap junction electrical coupling generally serves to mediate the recruitment of
metabolically deficient cells. Upon a minority of 30-50% of metabolically deficient βcells, gap junction
electrical coupling mediates their activation by more metabolically active cells. Indeed, our
computational and experimental results upon uniform changes in GK activity indicate that as few as
~30% of metabolically active β-cells can recruit and elevate [Ca2+] across the islet (Figs. 3,4). Therefore,
cells with high levels of glucose metabolism play an important role for elevating [Ca2+] across the islet
via electrical coupling. As such the preferential disruption of metabolically active cell populations under
pathogenic conditions could critically impact islet function.
Despite the import roll a large minority of metabolically active cells may play in elevating[Ca2+]
in metabolically deficient cells, some studies have demonstrated that sub-populations low in glucose
metabolism also show lower GJD2 expression (encoding Cx36) [19]. As a result, with increasing number
of cells low in glucose metabolism, the islet electrical activity may trend towards the behavior we
observe in the absence of electrical coupling. Cells low in glucose metabolism may not be recruited to
elevate [Ca2+], and islet [Ca2+] elevations may remain in a population of metabolically active cells even
if large numbers of cells are deficient in glucose metabolism. Thus, remodeling of electrical coupling
may be protective against large numbers of cells with deficient glucose metabolism.
We simulated a Gaussian distribution of glucose metabolism which agreed well with our
experimental results. However recent studies have indicated that small populations of cells, characterized
by high electrical coupling and GK expression, play a substantial role in coordinating islet electrical
activity [25]. Other highly metabolic subpopulations may also exist. Thus, within the populations of GK+
cells able to elevate [Ca2+] across the islet, a smaller sub-population may dominate this recruitment.
Furthermore, cells with higher glucose metabolism may also show elevated gap junction coupling, again
to aid in elevating [Ca2+]. Understanding the distribution of glucose metabolism, electrical coupling and
other aspects of islet function will be important for future work.
Implications for monogenic diabetes
Many forms of monogenic diabetes arise from mutations to genes that encode components regulating
insulin secretion [62]. We previously applied computational models to demonstrate that eliminating
electrical coupling could blunt the effect of many mutations to KATP channel subunits that cause NDM
[26]. This relies on electrical coupling mediating the hyperpolarization and suppression of [Ca2+] by
more inexcitable cells expressing mutant ATP-insensitive KATP channels. Our experimental and
computational results show a role for electrical coupling in mediating islet-wide suppression of [Ca2+]
by inexcitable cells that show decreased GK activity. For large decreases in GK activity (e.g. upon 5mM
MH), a reduction in electrical coupling elevates [Ca2+]. Thus, we rationalized that for a subset of GCK
mutations that cause diabetes, reducing electrical coupling may recover islet function.
Our computational model, which well described experimental data, also generated results that
were consistent with clinical data regarding GCK mutations. Mutations that cause NDM suppressed
[Ca2+] to a greater degree than mutations that cause MODY2, and those MODY2 mutations associated
with poorer glucose control (OGTT or HbA1c) caused a greater reduction in [Ca2+]. Thus, we can be
confident that the model can predict the effect of GCK mutations. The computational model predicts that
reducing electrical coupling improves [Ca2+] elevations in a small number of mutations. This is

consistent with the relatively narrow range of reduced GK or % cells low in GK over which electrical
coupling mediates a suppression of islet [Ca2+] (Fig.1,3). The larger set of mutations in which electrical
coupling promotes elevations in islet [Ca2+] is consistent with the idea that electrical coupling can
mediate more metabolically active cells to elevate [Ca2+] in metabolically inactive cells (see discussion
above). Thus, elevating electrical coupling may improve islet function in the face of GCK mutations,
especially if electrical coupling is diminished by factors such as poor glucose control.
There are important considerations when modulating electrical coupling to promote β-cell [Ca2+]
in the face of GCK mutations. Firstly, the terminal measurement we have made is glucose-regulated
[Ca2+], which follows close agreement with our computational model. However a deficiency of GK and
glucose metabolism will impact the production of mitochondrial derived amplifying factors that enhance
insulin secretion [63]. Furthermore, paracrine signals that rely on metabolic products, such as glutamate,
may also be disrupted and impact islet responses [64,65]. Therefore, while modulating gap junction
electrical coupling can improve [Ca2+] upon GK deficiency, the elevation of insulin secretion may be
modest given β-cells with low glucose metabolism would show low amplification. This may be
overcome by stimulating incretin pathways such as GLP1R activation that amplify insulin secretion. We
also note that our model is based upon a mouse islet and has been validated by mouse model data. The
cyto-architecture and electrical regulation differs in human islets and there may be differences in GK
action and electrical coupling in regulating islet function. However experimental data in human islets as
to the role of heterogeneity and gap junction electrical coupling is limited and thus our ability to
accurately simulate these properties and validate their role in the human context is limited. Nevertheless,
our mouse-based computational model provided good agreement with clinical data, supporting our
results and conclusions. Examining the role of heterogeneity in glucose metabolism and electrical
coupling in regulating human islet function is an important goal for future work.

CONCLUSIONS
The results from this study illustrate how gap junction mediated electrical coupling coordinate the
response of metabolically heterogeneous β-cells within the islet. Using both experimental systems and
computational models we have demonstrated that gap junction electrical coupling robustly coordinates
the [Ca2+] response in the presence of high levels of metabolic heterogeneity. Electrical coupling
promotes islet [Ca2+] elevations when low numbers of metabolically deficient β-cells are present but
suppresses islet [Ca2+] elevations when higher numbers of metabolically deficient β-cells are present.
Computational models support these findings, showing relevance to monogenic diabetes involving GCK
