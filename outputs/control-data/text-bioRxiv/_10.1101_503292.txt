Abstract

2

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of

3

intercellular communication that carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids via the circulation

4

to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. In pregnancy, EVs are

5

released in high quantities from the placenta and have been postulated to target

6

multiple cell types, including those of the vascular and immune systems. However, most

7

studies of pregnancy-associated EVs have used clinical samples and in vitro models; to

8

date, few studies have taken advantage of murine models in which pregnancy can be

9

precisely timed and manipulated. In this study, we used a murine model to determine

10

whether the quantity of EVs is altered during healthy pregnancy and during

11

inflammation-associated preterm birth. To facilitate data analysis, we developed a

12

novel software package, tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import,

13

clean, and quickly summarize raw data generated by the nanoparticle tracking device,

14

NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical). We also developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web

15

application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. In mice,

16

EV concentration in blood increased linearly across pregnancy, with significant rises at

17

GD14.5 and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Additionally,

18

lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in circulating EV

19

concentrations relative to vehicle-treated controls at GD16.5 within 4 hours. Use of

20

tidyNano facilitated rapid analysis of EV data; importantly, this package provides a

21

straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and

22

efficiently analyzed, is freely available under the MIT license, and is hosted on GitHub

23

(https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/). Our data highlight the utility of the mouse as a

Introduction

28

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) encompass a broad class of membrane-enclosed structures

29

secreted by cells, and are classified based on their size and subcellular origin.

30

Exosomes, which range from 40-150nm, arise from the inward budding of late

31

endosomes, and microvesicles, which range from 100-1000nm, develop as a result of

32

outward budding of the plasma membrane. Because EVs have the capacity to induce

33

physiological responses in recipient/target cells, they are of immense interest for many

34

life science disciplines including immunology, cancer biology, and medicine [1–4].

35

Molecular contents of EVs, which include lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, serve as

36

the basis for intercellular communication [5]. Indeed, EVs have been shown to be

37

effective and important in mediating processes including antigen cross-presentation [6],

38

establishing local ‘niches’ for metastasis of cancer cells [7], delivery of microRNAs for

39

suppression of gene expression in target tissues [8], and even transfer and subsequent

40

translation of mRNAs into target cells [9].

41

Within the context of pregnancy, the conceptus-derived placenta secretes

42

copious amounts of EVs that are detectable in maternal blood as early as the first

43

trimester in women [10–12]. Humans and mice share in common the hemochorial

44

anatomic arrangement of the placenta, in which maternal and fetal circulations are

45

separated by only 2 to 4 cellular layers. Importantly, in both species, the embryo-

46

derived trophoblast is suffused with maternal blood during much of pregnancy, serving

47

as a surrogate ‘endothelium’ across which maternal nutrients and fetal waste products

48

are exchanged. This intimacy also allows for the trophoblast to shed large amounts of

49

EV directly into the maternal circulation. Studies in women have suggested that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/503292; this version posted June 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

50

placental EVs contribute to critical processes in pregnancy, including vascular

51

development of the maternal-fetal interface and establishment of maternal immune

52

tolerance to the antigenically foreign fetus [1,13]. Further, because placental EVs

53

circulate in maternal peripheral blood, they can serve to provide a noninvasive ‘liquid

54

biopsy’ indicating fetal health in utero; similar concepts are applied to overall health as a

55

potential diagnostic for cancer [3,7]. The similarities in placentation between humans

56

and mice highlight the utility of the murine model to understand the function of

57

pregnancy-associated EVs; surprisingly, however, only a few recent studies [14,15]

58

have explored the pregnant mouse as a model for placental EV function, and no studies

59

have yet explored the response of pregnancy-associated EV to inflammation-induced

60

preterm birth.

61

Interest in EVs has burgeoned for the above reasons; however, their isolation

62

and analysis has posed a number of technical challenges. Because of their small size,

63

direct observation and quantification of isolated EVs require specialized equipment that

64

generates large amounts of data. One method of measuring the size and concentration

65

of nanoparticles is nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA; NanoSight, Malvern

66

Instruments, USA), which makes use of a microfluidic system and laser together with a

67

camera and software to track individual particles, measuring their size and

68

concentration on the basis of Brownian motion [16,17]. However, while NanoSight

69

provides an effective means of measuring EVs, experiments with more than one

70

condition require the use of independent spreadsheet software for extraction of raw

71

counts, treatment information, statistical analysis, and graphical representation.

72

Further, because this approach necessitates direct manipulation of raw data by the

73

user, it is susceptible to user- or software-introduced error [18]. Analysis of large

74

number of samples would benefit from a computational approach but requires

75

experiment-specific scripts, which are not easily adaptable to complex experimental

76

designs or conducive for reproducible research [19, 20].

77

In this study, we aimed to establish baseline quantities of murine EVs across

78

pregnancy, and further to determine the effects of inflammation on pregnancy-

79

associated EVs in a model of preterm birth. In addition, we sought to develop a

80

computational framework to standardize the process of NTA analysis including data

81

import, organization, visualization, and statistical analysis.

All experiments were approved by Michigan State University Institutional Animal Care

86

and Use Committee protocol: 04/18-050-01. Mice (C57Bl/6; Jackson Laboratory, Bar

87

Harbor, ME, USA) were anesthetized by 3% isoflurane and euthanized by cervical

88

dislocation and subsequent bilateral pneumothorax. Mice were housed in temperature-

89

controlled environments in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with standard diet and water

90

available ad libitum. Timed matings were performed in 6-8 week old mating pairs, and

91

the presence of a vaginal plug was designated as gestational day (GD) 0.5. For

92

preterm birth experiments, mated GD16.5 females were injected with 10mg LPS

93

(Salmonella enterica, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 100l PBS or 100l PBS

94

(vehicle control) i.p. and sacrificed 4 h later. Following anesthesia with isofluane and

95

oxygen (2L/min), whole blood was harvested via cardiac puncture using 1.2ml S-

96

Monovette EDTA-containing tubes fitted with a 22-gauge needle (Sarstedt, Newton, NC,

97

USA). Plasma was isolated by two rounds of centrifugation at 2000 x g for 15 minutes at

98

4°C and frozen at -80°C.

Exosome isolation and validation.

100

Frozen plasma samples were thawed on ice and exosomes were harvested using Total

101

Exosome Isolation reagent (Thermo Fisher, Burlingame, CA, USA) for plasma following

102

the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were resuspended in 25- 50 l of phosphate

103

buffered saline (PBS) [Corning, Manassas, VA, USA]. Plasma exosomes were

104

examined by transmission electron microscopy as previously described [2] (S1 Fig).

automated syringe sampler. Plasma EV samples were diluted 1:125-1:500 in PBS and

113

loaded into 1ml syringes with the flow rate set to 50 and the operator blinded to sample

Fig 1 summarizes the core functions of tidyNano, which serve to simplify importation of

raw NanoSight data into a data frame suitable for rapid computational analysis in the R

environment. To this end, tidyNano rearranges data into a ‘tidy’ format in which

123

observations are represented in rows and variables in a single column, rearranging the

124

data from the canonical ‘wide’ format (provided by NTA software), to the ‘long’ format

125

that is characteristic of ‘tidy’ data (Fig 2, 3A, 3B) [21], and conducive for manipulation

126

with the dplyr package [22], visualization with the ggpplot2 package [23], and

127

computation with base R statistics [24] (Fig 1). tidyNano also parses out sample

information and performs back calculations to account for sample dilution during NTA

129

measurement. Once in this ‘tidy’ format, tidyNano provides functions to summarize data

130

and calculate statistics that are immediately suitable for further analysis visualization

131

with ggplot2 and/or shinySIGHT, as described below (Fig 1). Functions within tidyNano

132

make use of dplyr and tidyr packages to transform and aggregate data, allowing each

133

tidyNano output to be compatible with a wide variety of R packages and suitable for

134

recent changes in visualization paradigms [22,23,25,26].

154

Data import and cleaning

155

TidyNano provides nanoimport() and nanocombine() functions to import individual NTA

156

experiment files or combine multiple experiment files into a single data frame within the

157

R environment. Both functions determine NTA software versions and import raw tabular

158

data, and can accommodate user-specified NTA parameters including bin widths and

159

particle ranges. The functions automatically determine the number of samples in an

160

NTA experiment, extract sample names and particle counts for each sample, and return

161

a single data frame. To do this, the nanotidy() function uses the gather() function from

162

the tidyr package to convert the data from ‘wide’ to ‘long’ format, i.e., the condensing of

163

individual sample columns into key-value pairs [21]. The function then splits the sample

164

column into multiple columns based on user-specified names, and performs back

165

calculations to determine the true count of particles in the original sample. Finally, the

166

column headers are converted to the correct class (e.g., categorical factor or numeric)

167

(Fig. 2).

171

The nanolyze() function calculates summary statistics by group and generates a data

172

frame that includes the number of samples within groups, mean, standard deviation,

173

and standard error. Further, it calculates a wide variety of statistics such as technical

174

and biological replicate means or differences between other experimental conditions.

175

Nanolyze() contains arguments for specifying prefixes to summary statistic columns

176

which allows for the function to be used sequentially to average replicates such as

177

technical, biological, and group/treatment replicates. Each iteration of Nanolyze returns

178

a visualizable tidy data frame (Fig 2). The nanocount() function allows for rapid

179

calculation of the total sum of particles within groups of samples and can be combined

180

with existing functions such as filter() to subset data.

181
182

Data visualization and statistical analysis

183

We also developed shinySIGHT, a web application built within the R shiny framework

184

that allows the user to upload, interact with, and visualize the NanoSight data without

185

needing to program. shinySIGHT facilitates dynamic exploration of NTA data and can

186

provide an understanding of particle size distribution and concentration with user-

187

adjustable sliders to specify particle size ranges (Fig 2). shinySIGHT is available within

188

the tidyNano package and can be run locally by using the shinySIGHT() command.

Results

192

To demonstrate the utility of the package, we used tidyNano to analyze three NanoSight

193

datasets. The first set consisted NanoSight data from polystyrene fluorescent and non-

194

fluorescent bead standards (S2 Fig) and a second set consisted of peripheral exosomes

195

from C57Bl/6 female mice across six time points of pregnancy. The third dataset

196

consisted of peripheral exosome data from a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of preterm

197

birth in GD16.5 C57 Bl/6 mice.

198

Data Import and Cleaning

199

To demonstrate the nanotidy() function, we imported raw NTA data from a dataset of

200

murine plasma exosomes from a preterm birth model of pregnancy. We used

201

nanoimport() to import NTA data into R which worked by extracting column headers and

202

individual particle counts and combined them into a large data frame (S3 Fig). If

203

desired, NTA data can also be cleaned manually by the user in spreadsheet software

204

such as Excel, as was done with the murine pregnancy time course exosome dataset

205

(Fig 3A). Next, nanotidy() was used to reshape the data into a key-value pairs such that

206

the individual samples and values were condensed into single columns resulting in the

207

conversion from ‘wide’ to ‘long’ format in an intermediate step (Fig 3B). Nanotidy() then

208

parsed the ‘Sample’ column into individual (user-specified) columns and performed

209

back-calculations to obtain a ‘True_count’ column containing the corrected count values

210

(Fig 3C). The output of nanotidy() resulted in a tidy data frame that could be

211

summarized, visualized or manipulated for further analysis (Figs 1 and 2).

213

Data summarization

214

To study the concentration of peripheral exosomes in murine pregnancy, we sampled

215

blood from 6 experimental groups (nonpregnant, four time points of gestation

216

corresponding to different embryonic developmental stages, and one postpartum) (n=5-

217

7/group). From each experimental group, three technical replicates, and two injection

218

replicates were measured, resulting in 222 distinct measurements (S4 Fig). Nanolyze()

219

was used to average the technical and injection replicates within each biological

220

replicate, resulting in a data frame that was suitable for plotting (S5 – S6 Fig). To

221

demonstrate sequential use of nanolyze(), we calculated averages of technical

222

replicates from two separate injections of the same dilution (S5 Fig, Fig 4A). Nanolyze()

223

was then repeated sequentially to determine the mean exosome concentration between

224

biological replicates using data in Fig 4A as input (Fig 4B). This was possible due to the

225

name argument, which allows custom naming of the column headers by users, and

226

param_var argument, which specifies the column on which to perform the calculation.

227

We then used nanocount() (data in Fig 4A) to determine the total concentration of

228

particles within each biological replicate, resulting in a data frame that could be plotted.

Visualization

240

Each tidyNano function described above returns a data frame conducive for flexible

241

downstream graphical representation. In the examples above, we created all plots from

242

nanolyzed data using ggplot2. Further, we developed an R Shiny web application,

243

shinySIGHT, that facilitates NTA data visualization, interactive exploration, and

244

interpretation, and may be particularly practical for users who are less experienced in

245

computer programming. To this end, after importing and tidying the murine exosome

246

time course data with nanoimport() and nanotidy(), respectively, we used the

247

nanosave() function to create a .Rds file. We then used the shinySIGHT() function to

248

launch shinySIGHT, and imported the .Rds file. This allowed interactive visualization of

249

NTA data from the preterm birth data without needing to be explicitly coded (Fig 5). A

257

up the visualizations.

If desired, technical and injection replicates (S5 Fig) and/or individual samples

259

(Fig 3D) may be visualized using shinySIGHT (not shown). Summarization steps from

260

each time point across gestation was examined by line graph using ggplot2, and

261

demonstrated mean exosome concentration of each animal split by gestational time

262

point (Fig 4A) as well as mean concentration of biological replicates (Fig 4B). After

263

plotting mean concentration of individual replicates with nanocount(), total exosome

264

concentration was plotted to determine the variations in exosome concentrations across

265

gestation (Fig 6B).

We used nanoShapiro() to determine the normality of the murine exosome dataset,

which returns a data frame with suggestions for the appropriate statistical test (Fig 6C).

278

Next, we used existing base R statistical packages [24] to run an ANOVA on our

279

samples to compare total exosome count across gestational days using data in Fig 6A.

280

The result of the ANOVA suggested that there were significant differences in exosome

Development of the nanoTidy package enabled rapid analysis of the changes in

circulating EVs across gestation (Fig 6B) and following LPS treatment (Fig 7). Maternal

plasma EV rose linearly with advancing gestational age, peaking at GD14.5 and

290

corresponding with placental mass (S7 Fig). EV concentrations were significantly

291

higher (p < 0.05) between non-pregnant and GD14.5, non-pregnant and GD17.5, and

292

trends (p < 0.1) towards an increase between GD5.5 and GD14.5. Likewise, there was

293

a trend towards reduction in circulating EVs between GD14.5 and 1 day postpartum.

294

Further, EV concentrations at GD5.5 and 10.5 were intermediate between those of

295

nonpregnancy and GD14.5 and 17.5.

significant decrease circulating EV concentration (p < 0.0017) (Fig 7).

Discussion

306

In this study, we quantified the murine plasma EVs across normal gestation, as well as

307

in a model of inflammation-induced preterm birth. The principle findings were that

308

plasma EVs concentrations increased with advancing gestational age in mice in

309

comparison to nonpregnant females, and that LPS-induced fetal loss was associated

310

with a striking reduction in circulating EV. Additionally, we report a novel pipeline in the

311

R platform for rapid exploration and visualization of data generated from NanoSight

312

analysis of EVs.

313

In pregnant females, plasma EV concentrations rose progressively and were

314

highest during the latter stages of gestation, reaching a maximum at GD14-17. This

315

finding is consistent with both a recent report of EV across gestation in mice and with

316

reports that EVs are highest during the third trimester of human pregnancy [14,27].

317

Additionally, mean plasma EV concentrations at GD5.5 and 10.5 rose to intermediate

318

concentrations levels between those of nonpregnancy and GD14.5, reminiscent of

319

increases in circulating EV observed during the first trimester of human pregnancy [27].

320

This may reflect heightened release of maternal, rather than placental, EVs, as neither

321

the first trimester of human pregnancy nor the first half of murine pregnancy is

322

characterized by established maternal blood flow to the placenta. Factors regulating an

323

early pregnancy-associated increase in EV are unknown; hormones from the conceptus

324

and embryo are already very high at these stages, and may induce systemic – possibly

325

vascular – release of maternal EVs. Early rises in circulating EV during pregnancy may

326

reflect a mechanism that controls systemic changes in the mother in preparation for her

327

own dramatic physiological adaptations to pregnancy and/or her accommodation of

328

rapid fetal growth.

329

EV concentrations tended (p = 0.076) to drop rapidly at one day postpartum from

330

the highest values at GD14. These data are also in line with rapid clearance of

331

placental EVs from the circulation of women following birth [10]. Changes in exosome

332

content during late gestation have been suggested to contribute to parturition in mice,

333

due in particular to a progressive increase in EVs carrying proinflammatory mediators

334

[14]. Alterations in the EV microRNA profile towards late gestation were also observed

335

in women, and further changes occurred in preterm birth [28]. Interestingly, we

336

observed a striking reduction in circulating EV concentrations following LPS

337

administration into pregnant dams, modeling infection-induced preterm birth. This

338

reduction in peripheral exosomes may reflect acute placental dysfunction and thus

339

placental EV secretion. In humans, peripheral EVs increase in pre-eclampsia, however

340

no quantitative differences were observed between normal term and spontaneous

341

preterm birth [28–30]. Time of sample collection relative to onset of preterm birth

342

symptoms as well as variable etiology of preterm birth in human clinical samples may

343

explain differences observed in our study. It also remains possible, and even likely, that

344

inflammation-induced preterm birth in mice alters EV cargo as in women. Ongoing

345

studies are addressing this possibility.

346

In addition to our experimental findings, we developed a computational

347

framework, tidyNano, in the R platform that facilitates analysis of data generated by

348

NanoSight. Following sample measurement, the NanoSight software generates a PDF

349

report that includes a line graph depicting size distribution and particle concentration, as

350

well as summary statistics including mean, median, and mode size of the EVs (S8 Fig).

351

For downstream analysis, including combinatorial analysis of multiple datasets within a

352

single experiment, users can access the raw NanoSight data, which includes particle

353

counts and size, as well as user-defined acquisition parameters. However, experiments

354

typically consist of multiple conditions, and require the use of independent spreadsheet

355

software (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Although spreadsheets can facilitate this by providing

356

intuitive processing through a point-and-click interface, the requirement for users to

357

directly interact with raw data is a major disadvantage as it is tedious and increases the

358

chances for user-introduced error [18]. Further, Excel itself has been known to

359

inadvertently change underlying raw data (e.g., the gene name OCT4 can be converted

360

to the date 10-04), which can also become problematic for downstream analysis

361

[18,31,32]. Spreadsheet software is also limited to user-specific pipelines, cannot be

362

easily expanded to accommodate multiparameter experiments, and the work and time

363

required to analyze data typically increases linearly with added data.

364

To develop software that avoids these pitfalls, we took advantage of a recent

365

paradigm in computational data analysis known as data ‘tidying’, which has become

366

increasingly popular due to its consistent format that is amenable to rapid data

367

exploration and analysis [21]. Tidy data is organized into a format such that

368

observations are represented in rows and variables in a single column, which allows for

369

subsetting, statistical calculation, and visualization of the data. Several popular

370

packages that accept tidy data have been developed, and allow for efficient

371

rearrangement, manipulation, programming, and visualization of data [22,23,25,26].

372

TidyNano employs a similar strategy, allowing users to quickly import and transform

373

nanoparticle data into a ‘tidy’ format. We showed here that this software was able to

374

efficiently process and analyze large sets of biological data. We also created an R

375

Shiny web application, shinySIGHT, for further exploration of the data using a graphical

376

user interface that can facilitate the process of inspecting and visualizing data without

377

requiring the user to know how to code.

378

In summary, the present study reveals changes in EV concentrations across

379

gestation and in a model of inflammation-induced preterm birth, and describes a novel

380

software package that provides a framework for analyzing NTA data by performing

381

functions that address the key components of data analysis: import and cleaning,

382

summarization, visualization, and statistical calculation. TidyNano, which will be

383

updated to accommodate future NanoSight models and NTA software, is an open

384

source package developed in R, hosted on GitHub

385

(https://github.com/nguyens7/tidyNano), and is freely available under the MIT license.

386

Data, supporting documentation, and vignettes can be accessed at the package website

387

(https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/). TidyNano summarization functions are general

388

purpose and can be adapted to analyze other tidy data, including non-nanoparticle data.
