Abstract

21

Nitrogen (N) is an important factor that influences potato production; appropriate N

22

fertilizer management can optimize tuber yield and quality and thus reduce the risk of

23

environmental N losses. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen

24

(N) application rates (0, 75, 150, 225, 300, and 375 kg ha−1) on the total tuber yield,

25

marketable yield, dry matter content, reducing sugar content, sucrose content of tuber, and fry

26

color index of two potato cultivars (Kennebec and Shepody) in 2016 and 2017. N supply

27

significantly affected tuber yield and processing quality, but these effects depended on the

28

year and/or cultivar. The results indicated that low (75 kg ha−1) and medium-N application

29

rates (150 or 225 kg ha−1) had a positive effect on tuber yield and processing quality;

30

however, high-N application rates (300 and 375 kg ha−1) resulted in lower yield and poor

31

quality. Total and marketable yields responded quadratically to N, and they were optimized at

32

150 kg ha −1 for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1 for Shepody in both the years. The processing

33

quality of tubers also responded quadratically with increasing N application rates. The

34

optimal range of N application was approximately 145–185.83 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and

35

approximately 93.44–288.67 kg ha−1 for Shepody according to the processing quality

36

standards of French fried potatoes in China. To achieve the goals of high yield and high

37

quality, N application rates should be 150 kg ha−1for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1 for Shepody.

Introduction

42

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a major global food crop because they can be grown

43

under a wide range of environments and have high nutritional value [1]. In addition, potatoes

44

can produce nutritious food more rapidly on less land and in harsh climates than other major

45

crops. Most potatoes are grown for starch processing and French fry production, with a small

46

proportion used for seed and table markets [2].

47

The processing of potatoes into French fries requires certain minimum quality attributes,

48

including oblong to long tubers (> 75 mm), shallow eyes, minimal loss due to peeling, low

49

reducing sugar, and light coloration [3]. Important factors influencing French fry grades and

50

total tuber yield are nutrient management and choice of cultivar [4]. Kennebec and Shepody

51

are widely grown in North China for French fries [5, 6].

52

Appropriate nitrogen (N) fertilizer management is a critical component for successful

53

potato production [7, 8]. A sufficient N supply is important for achieving economically viable

54

potato yields and the desired tuber size and quality targets from potato contracts [9, 10]. The

55

availability of soil mineral N in planting can improve yields, but large doses of these soil

56

minerals can delay tuber bulking, thereby leading to a decreased production of large tubers

57

[11, 12]. For several cultivars, research conducted overseas has demonstrated that N nutrition

58

can affect potato tuber quality [13-17].

59

Few studies have been conducted on the effects of N application on the processing

60

quality of French fried potatoes. This research was initiated to investigate the effects of N

management on potato yield and processing quality, including dry matter content, reducing

62

sugar content, sucrose content of tuber, and fry color index. The specific objectives of the

63

present study were to determine whether the range of N application rates applied to

64

harvesting potatoes corresponded to specifications used for processing French fry products

65

and to identify the optimal N application rate for Kennebec and Shepody cultivars. The

66

results of the present study may help farmers planting potatoes for French fry processing and

67

eventually improve the efficiency of N nutrition use and crop management.

Experimental design and treatments

62

84

All the experiments were conducted using a randomized complete block design with four

85

replicates of each treatment. Treatments comprised Kennebec and Shepody cultivars and six

86

N application rates (0, 75, 150, 225, 300, and 375 kg ha−1). The treatment with no N applied

87

was considered a control, the 75 kg ha−1 was a low-N treatment, 150 and 225 kg ha−1 were

88

medium-N treatment, and 300 and 375 kg ha−1 were high-N treatment. The plot size was 43.2

89

m2, with 8 m long rows and 0.90 m row spacing.

Crop management

92

Potatoes were planted on May 5, 2016, and May 8, 2017, and the plant population was

93

equivalent to 55555 plant−1. The source of N used was urea (46% N), and half of the N was

94

applied as a base fertilizer and the remaining half was applied 45 days after introduction of

95

each treatment. For all treatments, 180 kg P2O5 ha−1 (calcium phosphate) and 240 kg K2O

96

ha−1 (K2SO4) were applied at planting.

applied when soil moisture reserves were reduced to 65% of the soil water-holding capacity.

101

Water was applied at a rate of 6.8 mm h−1 with a portable overhead irrigation system.

Tuber yield

104

The potatoes were harvested on September 25, 2016, and September 28, 2017. Sections

105

(6 m long) from each of the four center rows of each plot were individually harvested,

106

washed, and weighed, and tubers of 10 kg were selected from each plot for their quality

107

assessment.

108

109

Dry matter content

110

Dry matter content was calculated on the basis of specific gravity measurements. The

111

specific gravity of marketable tubers was established by the weight in water, weight in air

112

method on a composite of subsamples obtained from marketable tubers [18].

113

114

Reducing sugar content

115

The concentration of reducing sugars in the potato tubers was determined using a

116

colorimetric technique with dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). Briefly, an extract was isolated from

117

each potato tuber and was centrifuged to obtain pure juice; a 1:20 dilution (extract:distilled

118

water) was then prepared with distilled water. The samples with the diluted extract were then

119

supplemented with DNS at a ratio of 1:3 (diluted extract:DNS) and incubated in a boiling

120

water bath for 5 min. The samples were cooled to room temperature, and their optical density

121

was determined using a spectrophotometer at 540 nm as an excess of the optical density of

122

the sample with the extract over the optical density of the background DNS solution. The

123

obtained optical densities were recalculated to the concentrations of reducing sugars in g/L

124

using calibration curves, and the dependences of the concentrations of reducing sugars on the

125

irradiation dose were plotted for each stage [19].

126

127

Fry color index

128

Five tubers were sampled from each replicate, and after removing 1–2 cm of each end,

129

the tubers were peeled and five longitudinal strips (1 cm) were removed from the center of

130

each tuber and fried for 3 min at 190°C. The average color of each of the 25 fries was

131

visually rated immediately after frying according to the USDA frozen French fried potato

132

color chart [20]. If the darker portions constituted more than approximately 50% of the strip,

133

the strip would be given a higher rating. The chart ratings of 000, 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4

134

represented the color of fried chips from light to dark, with 000 corresponding to the lightest

135

color and 4 corresponding to the darkest color. The number of each grade of fried chips was

136

counted as C000, C00, C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4. The equation of fry color index is as follows:

137

Fry color index = (C000 × 1 + C00 × 2 + C0 × 3 + C1 × 4 + C2 × 5 + C3 × 6 + C4 × 7) /

Statistical analysis

140

Regression analysis was performed to determine the N application rate response curves

141

for the measured potato traits (dependent variables). Significant regression equations with the

142

highest coefficients of determination and that best explained the relationship between N

143

application rates and dependent variables were selected and plotted using the software

144

statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) 16.0 package [21]. Every treatment was

145

replicated four times. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and differences between

146

means were tested at the 5% level using Duncan's new multiple range test.

148

Results

149

The total tuber yield was affected by cultivar, year, and N application rate. In addition,

150

significant correlations were observed between cultivar and N application rate as well as

151

between year and N application rate (Table 2). N application rate had a significant effect on

152

the total tuber yield of Kennebec and Shepody cultivars in both 2016 and 2017. The total

153

tuber yield of Kennebec and Shepody was lower in the absence of N fertilizer than in the

154

presence of N fertilizer. N fertilizer application increased the total tuber yield in low- and

155

medium-N treatments, but tuber yield decreased when N application rates were higher. The

156

maximum total tuber yield was obtained with an N application rate of 150 kg ha−1 in 2016

157

and 2017 for Kennebec (41.35 and 48.47 Mg ha−1, respectively), whereas the maximum total

164

The marketable yield accounts for all tubers that can be sold for French fry production,

165

after removing the small (< 7.5 cm), green, growth cracked, malformed, or decayed tubers.

166

Cultivar, year, and N application rate, as well as cultivar and N interactions had no effects on

167

marketable yield. The effects of N application on marketable yield were similar to those on

168

total yield. Marketable yield responded quadratically with increasing N application rates in

169

both Kennebec and Shepody cultivars across the two years (Table 2).

170

The dry matter content of the tubers was affected by year and N application rate. The

171

dry matter content of Kennebec and Shepody increased in both the years when an N

172

application rate of <225 kg ha−1 was applied (Table 2). High-N treatment had no positive

173

effect on dry matter accumulation in tubers.

174

Reducing sugar content is a major quality factor in potato processing. In the present

175

study, the reducing sugar content was affected by all the factors. However, the reducing sugar

176

content of tubers did not differ between 0 and 75 kg ha−1 N treatments for Kennebec in 2016

177

or 2017, but low-N treatment affected the reducing sugar content of tubers of Shepody

178

cultivar (Table 2). The N application rates of <150 kg ha−1 and 225 kg ha−1 decreased the

179

reducing sugar contents in Kennebec and Shepody, respectively, both in 2016 and 2017.

180

The sucrose content of tubers was affected by year and N application rates. In 2016, an

181

N application rate of 150 kg ha−1 resulted in the least sucrose content for Kennebec (1.43 mg

182

g−1), with only slightly higher amounts in 2017 (1.53 mg g−1). There was no significant

183

difference in the sucrose content in tubers between N application rates of 75 kg ha−1 in 2016

184

or 225 kg ha−1 in 2017. However, the N application arte of 150 kg ha−1 resulted in the lowest

185

sucrose content for Shepody in both the years (1.43 and 1.53 mg g−1), which was significantly

186

different from that for other N application rates (Table 2).

187

The fry color index was affected by N application rate, with a significant cultivar and N

188

interaction (Table 2). A lower color index indicates better potato quality. An increase in the N

189

application rate from 0 to 150 kg N ha−1 resulted in a decrease in the fry color index of

190

Kennebec in 2016 and 2017, but an increase in the N application rate of >150 kg N ha−1

191

resulted in an increase in the fry color index (Table 1).

192

193

The relationship between N application rate and tuber yield and processing of Kennebec

194

and Shepody can be expressed as a quadratic function (Fig. 1). By derivation of these

195

equations, the optimal N application rate was obtained for quality traits (Table 3). Only

potatoes that meet the quality index for standard French fry can be processed. The quality

197

standards for French fry potatoes in China are as follows: dry matter content of tubers should

198

be within 21%–23%, reducing sugar content of tubers should within 0.25%–0.35%, sucrose

199

content of tubers should be within 1.50–1.7 mg g−1, and fry color index should ≤2.0 [22]. The

200

range of N application rate for French fry potatoes was determined using the equation of each

201

processing quality (Table 3). Based on the ranges of N application rates of quality traits, we

202

can conclude that the optimal range of N application rate was 145–185.83 kg ha−1 for

203

Kennebec and 93.44–288.67 kg ha−1 for Shepody. To achieve the goal of high yields and high

Discussion

219

A previous study has reported that N supply significantly affected the total tuber yield

220

and processing quality, but the amount of N applied was dependent on the year and/or

221

cultivar [23]. A higher tuber yield and higher quality was achieved in the warm and longer

222

growing season in 2016 than in the cooler, shorter growing season in 2017. The climate was

223

more favorable for tuber bulking in 2016 than in 2017. Shepody demonstrated higher or

224

comparable marketable yield and higher quality than the standard cultivar Kennebec.

225

However, the tuber yield and quality traits were the best when the N application rates was

226

150 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1 for Shepody. These results indicate that the

227

efficiency of applied N use differs among cultivars. In addition to the specifics of each

228

cultivar, marketable yield and quality must be considered for selection of French fried

229

potatoes.

230

The effect of N on the growth and yield of potatoes has been the subject of several studies

231

[24, 25], with an increase in potato tuber yield by N fertilization being a common finding

232

[26-29]. Studies have reported that an increase in the N application rate increased the tuber

233

yield, but the tuber yield did not always increase with an increasing N application rate. It has

234

been demonstrated that excessive N reduces the tuber yield [30, 31]. The present study found

235

that the maximum total tuber yield and marketable yield was obtained with the N application

236

rates of 150 kg ha−1for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1 for Shepody in both the years.

237

Dry matter accumulation in tubers is a result of the carbohydrates photosynthesized during

238

tuber development that were retransmitted from leaves and stems [18]. The results of the

239

present showed that the dry matter content increased in tubers when N was applied prior to

240

the starch accumulation period; however, excessive N caused a decrease in the dry matter

241

content and maturity of potatoes, which was in contrast with the findings of Sharifi et al. [32]

242

who reported that N fertilization had no significant effect on tuber dry matter accumulation.

243

Laboski and Kelling [33] have reported that tuber specific gravity decreases with increasing

244

N application rates, particularly when the N rate exceeds the required N rate.

245

High reducing sugar content in the tuber causes darkening as a consequence of the mallard

246

reaction and is therefore undesirable, and a low content of reducing sugar is preferred

247

because it results in light and pleasing colors of desirable quality [34]. Dahlenburg et al. [5]

248

have reported that the reducing sugar content in tubers was affected by the N application rate.

249

In the present study, an increase in the reducing sugar content of Kennebec was observed in

250

response to excessive N. The reducing sugar content of potatoes for French fry should range

251

from 0.2% to 0.4% [22].

252

Sucrose is a good indicator of the chemical maturity of potatoes and is used to schedule

253

harvests and monitor storage stress [6]. It has been demonstrated that increasing N

254

fertilization can result in a decrease in the sucrose content at harvest, as well as in decreased

255

effects on sucrose and increased effects on fructose accumulation in stored potatoes [35].

256

However, in this study, the sucrose content of Kennebec increased when the N fertilizer rate

257

was higher than the optimal value.

258

Fry color index is an important indicator of food product characteristics because it is the

259

essential quality parameter that is evaluated by consumers even before the food is consumed

260

[36]. The N fertilizer rate has an inconsistent effect on chip or fry color [2]. Chip color has

261

been reported to be unaffected by the N fertilizer rate [13, 16, 37, 38]. In the present study, N

262

application did improve the fry color index when the N application rate increased from zero

263

to the optimal N fertilizer rate (150 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1 for Shpody);

264

however, it resulted in a darker fry color with excessive N fertilization as reported in a

265

previous study [25].

266

The range of N application rates was determined using the regression equation for dry

267

matter, reducing sugar content, sucrose content of tuber, and fry color. The optimal range of

268

N application was 145–271.81 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and 93.44–339.50 kg ha−1 for

269

Shepody. It is remarkable that these ranges are basic standards for French fry potatoes. For

270

example, if the dry matter content of a tuber is >21%, the tubers can also be used for French

271

fries, but the dry matter content should not be <18%, indicating that the lower the reducing

272

sugar content, sucrose content of tuber, and fry color index, the better is the quality of French

273

fries.

Conclusions

276

In the present study, we found that N supply significantly affected the tuber yield and

277

processing quality of French fried potatoes, but these effects were dependent on the year

278

and/or cultivar. Low- and medium-N application rates had a positive effect on tuber yield and

279

processing quality; however, high N application rates resulted in lower yield and poor

280

quality. The findings of our study demonstrated that the optimal range of N application was

281

approximately 145–185.83 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and approximately 93.44–288.67 kg ha−1

282

for Shepody according to the processing quality standards of French fried potatoes in China.

283

We suggest that the N application rates should be 150 kg ha−1 for Kennebec and 225 kg ha−1

284

for Shepody to obtain high yield and high quality.
