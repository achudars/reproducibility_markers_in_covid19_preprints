Abstract

35

The molecular mechanisms that shape the gene expression landscape during the development

36

and maintenance of chronic states of brain hyperexcitability are incompletely understood.

37

Here we show that cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation, a posttranscriptional mechanism for

38

regulating gene expression, undergoes widespread reorganisation in temporal lobe epilepsy.

39

Specifically, over 25% of the hippocampal transcriptome displayed changes in their poly(A)

40

tail in mouse models of epilepsy, particular evident in the chronic phase. The expression of

41

cytoplasmic polyadenylation binding proteins (CPEB1-4) was found to be altered in the

42

hippocampus in mouse models of epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy patients and CPEB4

43

target transcripts were over-represented among those showing poly(A) tail changes.

44

Supporting an adaptive function, CPEB4-deficiency leads to an increase in seizure severity

45

and neurodegeneration in mouse models of epilepsy. Together, these findings reveal an

46

additional layer of gene expression control during epilepsy and point to novel targets for

47

seizure control and disease-modification in epilepsy.

Introduction

60

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders, affecting approximately

61

70 million people worldwide1,2. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common

62

refractory form of epilepsy in adults and typically results from an earlier precipitating insult

63

that causes structural and functional reorganisation of neuronal-glial networks within the

64

hippocampus resulting in chronic hyperexcitability3. These network changes, which include

65

selective neuronal loss, gliosis and synaptic remodelling, are driven in part by large-scale

66

changes in gene expression4-7. The gene expression landscape continues to be dysregulated

67

once epilepsy is established8.

68

Recent studies have uncovered important roles for post-transcriptional mechanisms during

69

the development of epilepsy. These include the actions of small noncoding RNA, such as

70

microRNA and post-translational control of protein turnover via the proteasome contributing

71

to altered levels of ion channels, changes in neuronal micro- and macro-structure and glial

72

responses within seizure-generating neuronal circuits9-13. The molecular mechanisms

73

underlying the transcriptional and translational landscape in epilepsy remain, however,

74

incompletely understood.

75

In the cell nucleus, the majority of mRNAs acquire a non-templated poly(A) tail. Although

76

the addition of a poly(A) tail seems to occur by default, the subsequent control of poly(A) tail

77

length is highly regulated both in the nucleus and cytoplasm14. Cytoplasmic mRNA

78

polyadenylation contributes to the regulation of the stability, transport and translation of

79

mature transcripts, and is therefore an essential post-transcriptional mechanism for regulating

80

spatio-temporal gene expression14.

81

The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs) are sequence-specific

82

RNA-binding proteins (RNABPs) and key regulators of mRNA translation via the

83

modulation of poly(A) tail length15. The CPEB family is composed of four members in

84

vertebrates (CPEB1-4) with CPEB2-4 sharing more homology than with CPEB16. To

85

function, CPEBs bind to cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) sequences, located at

86

the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the target mRNAs. They nucleate a complex of factors

87

that regulate poly(A) tail length, thereby controlling both translational repression and

88

activation15. In the brain, CPEBs mediate numerous cellular processes including long-term

89

potentiation, synaptic plasticity and expression of neurotransmitter receptors17-19. Functional

90

roles for CPEBs in brain diseases include CPEB4 a critical regulator of risk genes associated

91

with autism21 and as protective against ischemic insults in vivo20. Notably, evoked seizures

92

result in increased CPEB4 expression22 and mice lacking Cpeb1 and the Fmr1 gene display

93

decreased susceptibility to acoustic stimulation-induced seizures23. Here, we explored

94

changes in mRNA polyadenylation in experimental mouse models of epilepsy, revealing

95

large-scale alterations as a major feature of the gene expression landscape in epilepsy.

Genome-wide mRNA polyadenylation profiling reveals deadenylation of epilepsy-

99

related genes

100

To investigate whether seizures and epilepsy impact on mRNA polyadenylation, we used the

101

well characterized intraamygdala kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus mouse model24.

102

In this model of acquired epilepsy, an intraamygdala microinjection of KA leads to status

103

epilepticus and wide-spread neurodegeneration involving the ipsilateral cortex and CA3

104

subfield of the hippocampus. All mice treated with intraamygdala KA develop epilepsy

105

following a short latency period of 3-5 days, experiencing 2-5 seizures per day24.

106

We first used mRNA microarrays to map both, changes in the rate of gene transcription and

107

potential genome-wide alterations in poly(A) tail length in the ipsilateral hippocampus at two

108

time-points; 8 hours (h) post-status epilepticus (acute injury) and at 14 days post-status

109

epilepticus (epilepsy) (Fig. 1a). Changes in poly(A) tail length were analyzed via poly(U)

110

chromatography. Here, by using a differential elution with either 25% or 90% formamide,

111

total hippocampal mRNA extracts were separated into two fractions, one enriched in mRNAs

112

with a short and one enriched in mRNAs with a long poly(A) tail, respectively21 (Fig. 1b).

113

This approach revealed that large-scale increases in mRNA levels accompany the early phase

114

after status epilepticus (4991 genes) when compared to established epilepsy (968 genes) (Fig.

115

1b). Therefore, regulation of mRNA levels seems to dominate the altered gene expression

116

landscape immediately following status epilepticus which is later reduced in epilepsy. In

117

sharp contrast to alterations in transcript levels, changes in poly(A) tail length were much

118

more pronounced in samples from mice with established epilepsy, affecting 28.6% of the

119

total mRNA pool (6177 genes) when compared to status epilepticus affecting 9.6% of the

120

genome (2088 genes) (Fig. 1b).

121

In order to identify functional groups of genes and pathways affected by changes in

122

polyadenylation, transcripts with poly(A) tail alterations were analysed by Gene Ontology

123

(GO) terms using the bioinformatic tool DAVID25. Notably, pathways related to epilepsy

124

were particularly abundant among genes undergoing a shortening in their poly(A) tail

125

following status epilepticus and during epilepsy (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Shortening of

126

selected deadenylated transcripts was validated by high-resolution poly(A) tail (Hire-PAT)

127

assay (Extended Data Fig. 1b). To explore whether changes in mRNA polyadenylation

128

disproportionately affect genes implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, we compiled a set

129

of epilepsy-related genes from three recent independent studies. These studies included: a)

130

genes where mutations cause epilepsy26, b) genes with ultra-rare deleterious variations in

131

familial genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE) and non-acquired focal epilepsies (NAFE)27

132

and c) genes localized in loci associated with epilepsy28 (Supplementary Table 2).

133

Remarkably, transcripts displaying poly(A) tail shortening showed an enrichment in genes

134

implicated in epilepsy at both time-points, post status epilepticus and during epilepsy (Fig.

135

1b). This enrichment persisted after comparing our dataset with genes specifically expressed

136

in the brain, thus proving this enrichment to be specific for epilepsy-related genes (Extended

137

Data Fig. 1c). Genes identified in our array to undergo mRNA deadenylation following status

138

epilepticus, also showed a reduction in their protein levels, demonstrating that mRNA

139

deadenylation leads to reduced protein expression. This included the Glutamate ionotropic

140

receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (GRIN2B), previously shown to play a role during

141

epilepsy26, Syntaxin 6 (STX6) and N6-adenosine-methyltransferase (METTL3), genes not

142

associated with epilepsy before (Fig. 1c). No significant changes in transcript levels of our

143

selected genes was observed when analysed post-status epilepticus, further suggesting this

144

decrease in expression is due to mRNA deadenylation (Fig. 1d). Previous in vivo studies

145

showed that deadenylation, by resulting in decreased protein output, is more disruptive than

146

poly(A) tail elongation in the brain21. Our results therefore indicate that deadenylation may

147

play a role during the development of epilepsy through diminishing the translation of specific

148

target genes.

149

Taken together, our results demonstrate changes in mRNA polyadenylation following

150

seizures and epilepsy affecting over 25% of the total transcriptome with deadenylation

151

disproportionately affecting transcripts encoding proteins related to epilepsy. Our results,

152

therefore, reveal mRNA polyadenylation as a previously unrecognized layer of gene

153

expression control in epilepsy.

Increased expression of CPEBs in the hippocampus of TLE patients

156

To identify possible candidate RNA Binding Proteins (RNABPs) responsible for driving

157

seizure-induced alterations in poly(A) tail length, we first compiled a list of genes whose

158

transcripts are known to bind to the main RNABPs involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation29

159

including human antigen R (HUR), which prevent deadenylation30; PUMILIO, which

160

promotes deadenylation31 and CPEBs21 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). This analysis

161

revealed that CPEB binders were highly enriched among genes that showed poly(A) tail

162

alterations following status epilepticus and during epilepsy (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, binders of

163

CPEB1 and of CPEB4 (the latter representing the CPEB2-4 subfamily) have been identified

164

in the brain21; while targets of both CPEBs were increased among genes with poly(A) tail

165

changes, the percentage of CPEB4 binders was significantly higher when compared to

166

CPEB1 binders, particularly during epilepsy (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

167

Next, to investigate the expression profile of the CPEB protein family during epilepsy, we

168

analyzed resected hippocampal tissue obtained from drug-refractory TLE patients. Here, we

169

found an increased expression of all CPEB family members, in particular of CPEB2 and

170

CPEB4 (Fig. 2c).

171

Together, the enrichment of CPEB-binders among altered genes and the increased levels of

172

CPEBs in TLE, indicate that members of the CPEB protein family, particularly the CPEB2-4

173

subfamily, are likely to be the main drivers of poly(A) tail changes during epilepsy.

174
175

Increased expression of CPEB4 in experimental models of status epilepticus

176

Next, to provide further evidence of CPEB driving poly(A) tail changes during epilepsy

177

development, we also analyzed the expression profile of the CPEB protein family in our

178

mouse models of status epilepticus. Whereas hippocampal Cpeb3 and Cpeb4 transcript levels

179

were increased at the early time points following status epilepticus in the intraamygdala KA

180

mouse model, no changes were found in Cpeb1 and Cpeb2 transcription levels (Fig. 3a). At

181

the protein level, only CPEB4 was significantly increased at short time-points, starting at 4 h

182

post-status epilepticus and returning to baseline control levels at 24 h (Fig. 3b), the time-point

183

at which a slight increase in CPEB1 and slight decrease in CPEB2 protein levels was also

184

observed. Interestingly, increased transcription of Cpeb4 was most evident in the dentate

185

gyrus (Extended Data Fig. 3a), a subfield of the hippocampus largely resistant to seizure-

186

induced neuronal death in the model24. CPEB4 protein was also upregulated in the

187

hippocampus following status epilepticus induced by the cholinergic mimetic pilocarpine

188

(Extended Data Fig. 3b), another widely used epilepsy model32. To provide additional proof

189

of a role for CPEBs during epilepsy, we analyzed epilepsy-related genes within targets of

190

CPEB1 and CPEB4 (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, only CPEB4 binders were enriched

191

within epilepsy-related genes, further suggesting that CPEB4 is an important regulatory

192

protein during epilepsy (Fig. 3c).

193

In summary, our data show altered expression of CPEBs in the hippocampus following status

194

epilepticus, in particular CPEB4, with CPEB4 binders being enriched among epilepsy-related

195

genes.

196
197

Altered CPEB4 function may explain changes in poly(A) tail length in epilepsy

198

Next, to obtain functional evidence that CPEB4 is responsible for changes in mRNA

199

polyadenylation occurring during epilepsy, we compared our identified global poly(A) profile

200

following status epilepticus and during epilepsy to the poly(A) profile present in CPEB4

201

knock-out (KO) mice21. Notably, analysis of the global transcript polyadenylation status in

202

CPEB4KO/KO mice revealed an opposing poly(A) tail length pattern to that observed in our

203

epilepsy mouse model (Fig. 4a). Moreover, in contrast to the observed polyadenylation

204

signature during epilepsy, in CPEB4KOKO mice the enrichment in epilepsy-related genes was

205

found in the set of genes showing poly(A) tail lengthening (Fig. 4b). Together, these results

206

further corroborate poly(A)-tail alterations observed in our intraamygdala KA mouse model

207

to be attributable to altered CPEB4 function.

CPEB4 deficiency increases seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced brain damage

210

To determine whether mRNA polyadenylation and CPEB4 contribute to brain excitability or

211

the

212

neuropathological sequelae in CPEB4 heterozygous (CPEB4KO/+) and homozygous

213

(CPEB4KO/KO) knockout mice33. Immunoblot and transcript analysis confirmed a partial and

214

full reduction of CPEB4 protein in the hippocampus of heterozygous and homozygous mice,

215

respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). CPEB4-deficient mice also showed normal levels of

216

different cell-type markers and kainate receptor levels in the hippocampus (Extended Data

217

Fig. 4b). Furthermore, hippocampal mRNA levels of the neuronal activity-regulated gene c-

218

Fos and baseline EEG recordings were similar between wildtype (WT), CPEB4KO/+ and

219

CPEB4KO/KO mice suggesting loss of CPEB4 does not noticeably alter normal brain function

220

(Extended Data Fig. 4c, d).

221

We then investigated the impact of CPEB4-deficiency on status epilepticus triggered by an

222

intraamygdala microinjection of KA. Both CPEB4KO/+ and CPEB4KO/KO mice showed a

223

shorter latency to the first seizure burst compared to WT mice (Fig. 5a). CPEB4KO/+ and

224

CPEB4KO/KO mice also experienced more severe seizures, as evidenced by higher total power

225

(Fig. 5b, c) and amplitude (Extended data Fig. 4e) during the time of KA injection until the

226

administration of the anticonvulsant lorazepam 40 min later. This increase in seizure severity

227

persisted for an additional 60 min recording period in CPEB4KO/KO mice (Fig. 5b, c).

228

Analysis of high frequency high amplitude (HFHA) paroxysmal discharges which correlate

229

with seizure-induced brain pathology34, revealed that both CPEB4KO/+ and CPEB4KO/KO mice

230

showed longer durations of HFHA spiking (Fig. 5d). Behavioral seizures were also more

231

severe in CPEB4KO/+ and CPEB4KO/KO mice during status epilepticus (Fig. 5e). Next, we

232

analysed brain sections to determine whether loss of CPEB4 affects neuropathological

outcomes. Status epilepticus in the intraamygdala model produces a characteristic lesion

234

within the ipsilateral CA3 subfield comprising select neuron loss and gliosis. Both

235

CPEB4KO/+ and CPEB4KO/KO mice displayed increased neuronal death following status

236

epilepticus as evidenced by more Fluorojade (FjB)-positive cells in all subfields of the

237

hippocampus and in the cortex (Fig. 5f, g).

238

We also investigated neuropathological outcomes in a second model. CPEB4KO/+ mice

239

subjected to status epilepticus induced by intraperitoneal pilocarpine showed increased

240

mortality (Extended data Fig. 5a) and underwent more severe seizures (Extended data Fig.

241

5b, c), including longer durations of HFHA spiking (Extended data Fig. 5d). Analysis of

242

brain sections from these mice also identified more neurodegeneration in the hippocampus

243

and cortex of CPEB4KO/+ mice compared to WT controls (Extended data Fig. 5e).

244

Together, our results demonstrate that loss of CPEB4 increases vulnerability to seizures and

245

hippocampal damage indicating that CPEB4 is an important regulator of brain excitability

246

and seizure-induced neurodegeneration.

247
248

Discussion

249

In the present study, we are the first to describe changes in the global mRNA polyadenylation

250

profile following status epilepticus and during epilepsy. This represents an important post-

251

transcriptional level of regulation of gene expression in which CPEBs play a key role. This is

252

evidenced by bioinformatics analysis of various RNABPs and of epilepsy-related genes,

253

together with the alteration of CPEBs in samples from human TLE and KA mouse models.

254

We further identify CPEB4 as a key neuroprotective regulator of mRNA polyadenylation

255

during epilepsy, and this is corroborated in CPEB4-deficient mice.

256

Despite the availability of over 25 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), pharmacological

257

interventions remain ineffective in 30% of patients and, even when seizure-suppressive,

258

current AEDs are merely symptomatic and have no beneficial effect on the development of

259

epilepsy35. While both acute status epilepticus and chronic epilepsy are characterized by

260

altered gene transcription, other post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms have

261

been shown to be crucial during the development of epilepsy36. We are, however, still far

262

from a complete picture of the pathological molecular changes occurring during

263

epileptogenesis and epilepsy, a critical requirement for the development of much needed new

264

therapeutic strategies. Adding to the complexity of gene regulation during epileptogenesis,

265

we have now identified a novel regulatory gene expression mechanism, cytoplasmic mRNA

266

polyadenylation, potentially contributing to how protein expression is controlled during

267

epilepsy and thereby contributing to the generation of hyperexcitable networks.

268

Besides the long-known role of CPEB-dependent cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation during

269

early development, a role has more recently been recognized in the adult brain18, where it is

270

associated with synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, learning and memory37. Long

271

forms of synaptic plasticity involving prion-like tag-mechanisms are particularly reliant on

272

CPEB-dependent polyadenylation38. Epilepsy is a long lasting persistence of the

273

hyperexcitability observed in status epilepticus and, thus, amenable to be regulated by CPEB-

274

and poly(A)-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. In fact, while transcriptional changes

275

are profuse during status epilepticus, they decline in epilepsy, while the percentage of genes

276

showing altered poly(A) tail length increases from status epilepticus to epilepsy, with almost

277

30% of the genome affected in chronic epilepsy. These results suggest that transcriptional

278

changes may predominate in the early phases of hyperexcitability while poly(A)-dependent

279

regulation plays a larger role in the maintenance of epilepsy.

280

Despite multiple lines of evidence pointing to a key role of CPEBs in poly(A) changes in

281

epilepsy reported here, we cannot however exclude a contribution of other RNABPs such as

282

HUR or PUMILIO, which have previously been associated with epilepsy39,40. Similarly,

283

among the various CPEBs, we show here that CPEB4 is a key player in epilepsy related

284

poly(A)-dependent gene regulation, but we cannot discard that other CPEBs also play a role.

285

The strongest evidence suggesting a role for CPEB4 include its early increase in expression

286

following acute seizures in two mouse models of status epilepticus and that a polyadenylation

287

profile opposite to the one observed during epilepsy is observed in CPEB4 knock-out mice.

288

Our data indicate that CPEB4 induction during epileptogenesis is neuroprotective and that the

289

high levels of expression found in human TLE patient tissue most likely represent an

290

endogenous antiepileptogenic adaptive mechanism to protect the brain once pathological

291

processes are initiated. Accordingly, CPEB4 deficiency in mice, despite having no apparent

292

impact on normal brain physiology41, lowers the seizure threshold upon challenge with

293

proconvulsants and leads to an increase in seizure severity and resulting brain damage.

294

Interestingly, further evidence of the neuroprotective role of CPEB4 was also previously

295

obtained in an in vitro model of ischaemia20.

296

In conclusion, our results uncover cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation as an important layer

297

of gene expression regulation in epilepsy, which must be considered when analyzing

298

molecular patho-mechanisms during epileptogenesis and open the door for the development

299

of novel therapies targeting mRNA polyadenylation for the treatment of drug-refractory

300

epilepsy.

Methods

303
304

Human brain tissue

305

This study was approved by the Ethics (Medical Research) Committee of Beaumont Hospital,

306

Dublin (05/18), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Briefly, patients

307

(n = 6) were referred for surgical resection of the temporal lobe for the treatment of

308

intractable TLE. After temporal lobe resection, hippocampi were obtained and frozen in

309

liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C until use. A pathologist (Dr. Michael Farrell) assessed

310

hippocampal tissue and confirmed the absence of significant neuronal loss. Control (autopsy)

311

temporal hippocampus (n = 6) was obtained from individuals from the Brain and Tissue Bank

312

for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A. Samples

313

were processed for Western blot analysis. Brain sample and donor metadata are available in

314

Supplementary Table 4.

Animal models of status epilepticus and epilepsy

317

Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the principles of the European

318

Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU). Procedures were reviewed and approved by

319

the Research Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (REC 1322) and

320

the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) (AE19127/P038). All efforts were

321

maximized to reduce the number of animals used in this study. Mice used in our experiments

322

were 8-12 weeks old male and female C57Bl/6, obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Bicester,

323

UK) and from the Biomedical Research Facility (BRF), Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland

324

(Dublin, Ireland). CPEB4-deficient mice (CPEB4KO/+, CPEB4KO/KO) harbour a heterozygous

325

or homozygous deletion of constitutive exon 2, respectively, resulting in a premature stop

326

codon and thereby a partial or full suppression of CPEB4 protein expression33. Animals were

327

housed in a controlled biomedical facility on a 12 h light/dark cycle at 22±1 ºC and humidity

328

of 40-60% with food and water provided ad libitum. Status epilepticus was induced as

329

described previously either via an intraamygdala injection of KA or an intraperitoneal

330

injection of pilocarpine42. Before implantation of cannulas (intraamygdala KA injection) and

331

electrodes (EEG recordings), mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (5% induction, 1-2%

332

maintenance) and maintained normothermic by means of a feedback-controlled heat blanket

333

(Harved Apparatus Ltd, Kent, UK). Next, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame and a

334

midline scalp incision was performed to expose the skull. A guide cannula (coordinates from

335

Bregma; AP = -0.94 mm, L = -2.85 mm) and three electrodes (Bilaney Consultants Ltd,

336

Sevenoaks, UK), two above each hippocampus and one above the frontal cortex as reference,

337

were fixed in place with dental cement. Intraamygdala KA (0.3 µg KA in 0.2 µl phosphate-

338

buffered saline (PBS)) (Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin, Ireland) was administered into the basolateral

339

amygdala nucleus. Vehicle-injected control animals received 0.2 µl of PBS. To reduce

340

morbidity and mortality, mice were treated with an i.p. injection of the anticonvulsant

341

lorazepam (6 mg/kg) 40 min post-KA or PBS injection (Wyetch, Taplow, UK). As described

342

previously, all mice develop epilepsy after a short latency period of 3-5 days24. Status

343

epilepticus was also induced by an i.p. injection of pilocarpine (340 mg/kg body weight)

344

(Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin, Ireland) 20 min following the injection of methyl-scopolamine (1

345

mg/kg) (Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin, Ireland)42. Mice were treated with i.p. lorazepam (6 mg/kg)

346

90 min following i.p. pilocarpine. EEG was recorded using the Xltek recording system

347

(Optima Medical Ltd, Guildford, UK) starting 20 min before administration of pro-

348

convulsant (KA or pilocarpine) to record baseline and during status epilepticus (40 min for

349

intraamygdala KA-treated mice and 90 min for mice treated with i.p. pilocarpine). EEG was

350

continued for 1 h post-administration of lorazepam. Mice were euthanized at different time-

351

points following status epilepticus (1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h) and during chronic epilepsy (14 days)

356

Poly(U) chromatography

357

C57Bl/6 WT mice were sacrificed 8 h following status epilepticus (acute pathology) (KA and

358

PBS, n = 9 per group) or 14 days post-status epilepticus (time-point at which all mice suffer

359

from chronic epilepsy24) (KA and PBS, n = 9 per group). Ipsilateral hippocampi were quickly

360

dissected, pooled into 3 groups (n = 3 per pooled sample) and stored at -80ºC until use. RNA

361

was extracted using the Maxwell® 16 LEV simplyrna Tissue Kit (Promega, AS1280).

362

Poly(A) RNA fraction was purified by poly(U) chromatography as before43. Poly(U)-agarose

363

(Sigma, p8563) was suspended in swelling buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl) 35

364

ml/g, incubated overnight at room temperature and loaded into a chromatography column. An

365

aliquot of total RNA was stored at -80ºC (“Input”) and the remaining sample incubated with

366

sample buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) for 5 min at 65ºC and

367

chilled on ice. Binding buffer was added (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.7 M NaCl, 10 mM

368

EDTA, 25% [v/v] formamide) which was followed by loading of samples into the poly(U)-

369

agarose chromatography column (Mobitec, M1002s). Samples were then incubated for 30

370

min at room temperature (25ºC) with agitation. Next, columns containing samples were

371

washed three times at 25ºC and six times at 55ºC with washing buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH

372

7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 25% [v/v] formamide). The 55ºC washes were collected and

373

stored at -80ºC (“Short poly(A)-tail fraction”). The remaining poly(A) RNA (“Long poly(A)-

374

tail fraction”) was eluted with elution buffer (0.05 M HEPES, pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 90%

375

[v/v] formamide) at 55ºC and stored at -80ºC. RNA of the two poly(A) fractions was

376

precipitated by adding 1 volume of isopropanol, 1/10th volume of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.2

and 20 µg of glycogen (Sigma, G1767). Samples were incubated at -20ºC for 20 min and

378

centrifuged for 15 min at 14000 g at 4ºC. Supernatant was removed and pellet was washed

379

with 750 µl of ethanol and centrifuged at 14000 g at 4ºC for 5 min. Then supernatant was

380

removed again and pellet was air-dried for 5 min. Next, RNAs were resuspended in 300 µl of

381

nuclease-free water and 300 µl of acid Phenol:Chloroform (5:1) were added. Then, samples

382

were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 14000 g at 4ºC. The aqueous phase was

383

recovered, mixed with 1 volume of chloroform, vortexed and centrifuged again. The aqueous

384

phase was recovered and precipitated again using the isopropanol precipitation. To confirm

385

the average length in each fragment, when setting up the method, we performed digestion of

386

the non-poly(A) mRNA regions followed by end-labelling of the poly(A) tail for each eluted

387

fraction and Urea-PAGE. Ensuring proper functioning of our technique, poly(A)-tail changes

388

were assessed by HIRE-PAT assays of control genes in Input, Washed and Eluted fractions.

389

RNA quantification was performed by Qubit Fluorimeter using Qubit RNA Hs Assay kit

390

(Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Q32852). RNA integrity QC was performed with Agilent

391

Bioanalyzer 2100, using RNA Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies 5067-1511) and RNA Pico

392

Assay (Agilent Technologies 5067-1513).

GeneAtlas MG-430 PM microarray analysis

395

cDNA library preparation and amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s

396

instructions (Sigma-Aldrich) using the WTA2 kit with 25 ng starting material. cDNA was

397

amplified for 17 cycles and purified using PureLink Quick PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen,

398

K310001). Quantification of amplified cDNA was carried out on a Nanodrop ND-1000

399

spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 8.5 µg of the cDNA

400

from each sample were fragmented and labelled with GeneChip Mapping 250K Nsp assay kit

402

performed using the GeneAtlas Hyb, Wash and Stain Kit for 3' IVT arrays. Samples ready to

403

hybridize were denatured at 96ºC for 10 min prior to incubation with mouse MG-430 PM

404

Array Strip (Affymetrix, 901570). Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 45ºC in the

405

GeneAtlas Hybridization Oven (Affymetrix, 00-0331). Washing and staining steps after

406

hybridization were performed in the GeneAtlas Fluidics Station (Affymetrix, 00-0079),

407

following the specific script for Mouse MG-430 PM Arrays. Finally, arrays were scanned

408

with GeneAtlas Scanner (Affymetrix) using default parameters, and the generation of CEL

409

files for bioinformatics analysis was performed using GeneAtlas software (Affymetrix).

410

Processing of microarray samples was performed using R44 and Bioconductor45. Raw CEL

411

files were normalized using RMA background correction and summarization46. Standard

412

quality controls were performed in order to identify abnormal samples47 regarding: a) spatial

413

artefacts in the hybridization process (scan images and pseudo-images from probe level

414

models); b) intensity dependences of differences between chips (MvA plots); c) RNA quality

415

(RNA digest plot); and d) global intensity levels (boxplot of perfect match log-intensity

416

distributions before and after normalization and RLE plots). Probeset annotation was

417

performed

418

(https://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx) using version na35. Expression values

419

were adjusted for technical biases as described48 using a linear model and implemented with

420

the R package "limma"49. For each biological replicate the log2 fold change was computed

421

between "WASHED (Short)" and "ELUTED (Long)" samples and used to find significant

422

differences between intraamygdala KA or vehicle-treated control mice sacrificed at two

423

different time-points (8 h (acute) and 14 days (chronic epilepsy) following status epilepticus).

424

Differential expression was performed using a linear model with fluidics and amplification

425

batch as covariates. P-values were adjusted with the Benjamini and Hochberg correction. We

426

considered one transcript as shortened when P-value was < 0.05 and FC was negative and

Gene Ontology analysis

432

Genes with changes in poly(A) tail length between intraamygdala KA or vehicle control mice

433

sacrificed at two different time-points (8 h and 14 days following status epilepticus) were

434

analysed by GO terms with the bioinformatic tool DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.725.

435
436

High-Resolution poly(A) tail (HIRE-PAT) assay

437

To measure poly(A) tail length of mRNAs, USB® Poly(A) Tail-Length Assay Kit

438

(Affymetrix, 76455) based on the HIRE-PAT method was performed. We used total RNA

439

obtained of Washed and Eluted fractions (enriched in mRNA short and long poly(A) tail

440

respectively), from the ipsilateral hippocampi of mice sacrificed 8 h following status

441

epilepticus. G/I tailing (1 μg of total RNA) and reverse transcription were performed

442

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Poly(A) tail size was determined by subtracting

443

the PCR amplicon size obtained with the Universal primer and forward specific primers. To

444

verify that the measured poly(A) tail corresponds to a specific gene, at least two different

445

forward specific primers were tested (Supplementary Table 5). PCR products were resolved

446

on a 2.5% sybr green agarose gel (Biotium, 41004) run at 120 V for 1.5 h.

454

by Quick Start Bradford kit assay (Bio-Rad, 500-0203) or BCA (Thermo Scientific, Ref

455

23235) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Between 15 - 40 μg of total protein were

electrophoresed on 8 - 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to

457

a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Amersham Protran 0.45 μm, GE Healthcare Life

460

4ºC with the primary antibody in TBS-T supplemented with 5% non-fat dry milk. On the next

461

day, following washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with secondary HRP-

464

visualized using chemiluminescence Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A (Pierce

466

(Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), analysed using Alpha-EaseFC4.0 software and quantified using

467

ImageJ software50. Protein quantity was normalized to the loading control (ACTB or

477

RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)

478

RNA extraction was performed using the Trizol method, as described before42. Quantity and

479

quality of RNA was measured using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,

480

Rockford, IL, U.S.A). Samples with a 260/280 ratio between 1.8 – 2.2 were considered

481

acceptable. 500 ng of total mRNA was used to produce complementary DNA (cDNA) by

482

reverse transcription using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen, CA,

483

U.S.A) primed with 50 pmol of random hexamers (Sigma, Dublin, Ireland). qPCR was

484

performed using the QuantiTech SYBR Green kit (Qiagen Ltd, Hilden, Germany) and the

485

LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Each reaction tube

486

contained 2 μl cDNA sample, 10 μl SyBR green Quantitect Reagent (Quiagen Ltd, Hilden,

487

Germany), 1.25 μM primer pair (Sigma, Dublin, Ireland) and RNAse free water (Invitrogen,

488

CA, U.S.A) to a final volume of 20 μl. Using LightCycler 1.5 software, data were analysed

489

and normalized to the expression of Actb. Primers used are detailed in Supplementary Table 5.

490
491

Enrichment analysis

492

To evaluate whether a gene set is enriched over the background, enrichment analysis studies

493

were carried out using one-sided Fisher’s exact test. For our analysis, we used curated gene

494

lists of epilepsy-related genes generated from three independent studies. This included genes

495

with mutation that cause epilepsy (n = 84); mutations in these genes cause pure or relatively

496

pure epilepsies, or syndromes with epilepsy as the core symptom26. Genes with ultra-rare

497

deleterious variation in familial genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) and non-acquired focal

498

epilepsy (NAFE) (n = 18); we chose the most significant genes per group (top 15)27. Genes

499

localized in loci associated with epilepsy (n = 21); the 21 most likely epilepsy genes at these

500

loci, with the majority in genetic generalized epilepsies, were selected28. The complete set of

501

epilepsy-related genes used in our study is shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Identification of mRNA targets of RNA binding proteins

503

CPEB1 and CPEB4 binders were determined previously by RNA immunoprecipitation21;

504

PUM1 and PUM2 targets were identified by individual nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP)31;

505

genes that interact with HUR were identified by photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced

506

crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP)30. The complete list of RNABP targets is

507

shown in Supplementary Table 3. The list of brain-specific genes was obtained from the

508

human protein atlas (http://proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/brain).

509
510

Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis

511

To analyse EEG frequency, amplitude signal (power spectral density and EEG spectrogram

512

of the data) and seizures onset, EEG data was uploaded into Labchart7 software (AD

513

instruments Ltd, Oxford, UK). EEG total power (μV2) is a function of EEG amplitude over

514

time and was analysed by integrating frequency bands from 0 to 100 Hz. Power spectral

515

density heat maps were generated using LabChart (spectral view), with the frequency domain

516

filtered from 0 to 40 Hz and the amplitude domain filtered from 0 to 50 mV. The duration of

517

high‐frequency (>5 Hz) and high‐amplitude (>2 times baseline) (HFHA) polyspike

518

discharges of ≥5 s duration, synonymous with injury‐causing electrographic activity34, were

519

counted manually by a reviewer who was blinded to treatment. Seizure onset was calculated

520

as first seizure burst from time of intraamygdala KA injection.

521
522

Behaviour assessment of seizure severity

523

Changes in seizure-induced behaviour were scored according to a modified Racine Scale as

524

reported previously51. Score 1, immobility and freezing; Score 2, forelimb and or tail

525

extension, rigid posture; Score 3, repetitive movements, head bobbing; Score 4, rearing and

526

falling; Score 5, continuous rearing and falling; Score 6, severe tonic–clonic seizures. Mice

were scored by an observer blinded to treatment every 5 min for 40 min after KA injection.

528

The highest score attained during each 5 min period was recorded.

530

Fluoro-Jade B staining

531

To assess status epilepticus-induced neurodegeneration, FjB staining was carried out as

532

before52. Briefly, 12 μm coronal sections at the medial level of the hippocampus (Bregma AP

533

= -1.94 mm) were cut on a cryostat. Tissue was fixed in formalin, rehydrated in ethanol, and

534

then transferred to a 0.006% potassium permanganate solution followed by incubation with

535

0.001% FjB (Chemicon Europe Ltd, Chandlers Ford, UK). Sections were mounted in DPX

536

mounting solution. Then, using an epifluorescence microscope, cells including all

537

hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and CA3 regions) and cortex were counted

538

by a person unaware of treatment under a 40x lens in two adjacent sections and the average

539

determined for each animal.

540
541

Data analysis

542

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS® Statistic IBM®). Data are

543

represented as mean ± S.E.M. (Standard Error of the Mean) with 95% confidence interval.

544

The normality of the data was analysed by Shapiro-Wilk test (n < 50) or Kolmogorov-

545

Smirnov (n > 50). Homogeneity of variance was analysed by Levente test. For comparison of
