Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

19

Abstract

20

Unlike other bacterial ClpP systems, mycobacterial ClpP1P2 complex is essential

21

for mycobacterial survival. The functional details of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)

22

ClpP1P2 remains largely elusive and selectively targeting ClpP of different species is a

23

big challenge. In this work, cediranib was demonstrated to significantly decrease the

24

activity of MtbClpP1P2. By solving the crystal structure of cediranib-bound

25

MtbClpP1P2, we found that cediranib dysregulates MtbClpP1P2 by interfering with

26

handle domain of the equatorial region of MtbClpP1, indicating that the inter-ring

27

dynamics are crucial for its function. This finding provides direct evidence for the

28

notion that a conformational switch in the equatorial handle domain is essential for ClpP

29

activity. We also present biochemical data to interpret the distinct interaction pattern

30

and inhibitory properties of cediranib toward MtbClpP1P2. These results suggest that

31

the variable handle domain region is responsible for the species-selectivity of cediranib,

32

which suggests the equatorial handle domain as a potential region for screening

33

pathogen-specific ClpP inhibitors.

Introduction

35

Caseinolytic protease ClpP, a widely conserved self-compartmentalizing serine

36

protease in bacteria, plays essential roles in protein metabolism and regulates diverse

37

physiological functions including cell motility, genetic competence, cell differentiation,

38

sporulation, and virulence, and is thus an attractive target for antibiotic development[1-

39

8]. Notably, ClpP is an novel drug target for which both inhibition and activation result

40

in an attenuated or lethal phenotype in many pathogens; thus agonists and antagonists

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

41

aimed at the ClpP system represent promising drug candidates for further evaluation[9,

42

10]. The ClpP enzyme of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), MtbClpP1P2, exerts its

43

proteolytic function by a heterotetramer of two protein subunits, ClpP1 and ClpP2[11,

44

12]. Moreover, encoding genes of subunits ClpP1 and ClpP2, have been shown to be

45

essential genes for MTB survival and the deletion of either gene causes bacterial

46

death[13]. A panel of MtbClpP1P2 inhibitors have been reported and they can be

47

classified into two categories depending on their action modes. The first kind of small

48

molecules act on the catalytically active center, covalently modifying the serine

49

residues of the active sites of two subunits of MtbClpP1P2, including bortezomib,

50

boron-containing analogues and beta lactones[14-17]. The second kind of inhibitors act

51

on the chaperone protein (ClpX/ClpC1) binding site that competitively binds to the

52

surface of the ClpP2 subunit. Representative molecules of this category are ADEP and

53

its analogs[12]. Since the chaperones binding L/IGF region of ClpP2 subunit is highly

54

conserved, as with the inhibitor of the MtbClpP1P2 catalytic center[18], the ADEP

55

compounds are nonselective as well. As we know, the off-target effects may bring

56

severe side effects during drug development. Thus it is desirable to find novel binding

57

pocket or selective inhibitors targeting MtbClpP1P2 to avoid the potential adverse

58

effects of nonselective ones. In this work, we demonstrate that cediranib, an orally

59

available vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitor, is able to

60

inhibit MtbClpP1P2 peptidase activity. We solved the crystal structure of MtbClpP1P2

61

in complex with an agonist peptide and cediranib, and present details of the inhibitory

62

mechanism. Unlike other ClpP inhibitors, cediranib dysregulates MtbClpP1P2 by

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

63

interfering with the equatorial region of MtbClpP1, supporting the idea that the inter-

64

ring dynamics are crucial for ClpP function. We also present biochemical data

65

suggesting that this mechanism is distinct from those of previously reported ClpP

66

inhibitors. These results reveal a novel druggable pocket in MtbClpP1P2, with potential

67

implications for further research on ClpP catalytic mechanism and drug development.

Identification of cediranib as a novel inhibitor of MtbClpP1P2

70

We screened about 2600 bioactive compounds (MedChemExpress, HY-L001)

71

based on a peptidase activity assay. Eight compounds (hit rate 0.31%) that generated

72

≥80% inhibition of MtbClpP1P2 were selected for IC50 value evaluation (Fig 1A).

73

Among these hits, cediranib and brivanib, which possesses an indolyl group, showed

74

promising inhibitory effects toward MtbClpP1P2 peptidase activity; cediranib had a

75

lower IC50 value (3.4 μM) than brivanib (12.5 μM) (Fig 1A and 1B). In addition,

76

cediranib (100μM) led to a peak shift of 10°C in the thermal stability of MtbClpP1P2

77

in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) assay, which confirms their direct interaction

78

in solution (S1 Fig).

79

To dissect whether cediranib is a species-selective inhibitor, we profiled its

80

peptidase inhibitory effects against a panel of ClpPs from Escherichia coli (EcClpP),

81

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaClpP1), and Staphylococcus aureus (SaClpP) (Table 1

82

and S2 Fig). The results show that cediranib has no obvious inhibitory effect on those

83

ClpP variants. In contrast, cediranib demonstrated non-competitive inhibition of

84

MtbClpP1P2 (Fig1C), indicating that it may not form covalent bonds with the protease.

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

85

To validate the antibacterial activity of cediranib, we carried out growth inhibition

86

assays on several pathogenic bacteria. As Table 1 and Table 2 show, cediranib had no

87

inhibitory activity toward S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus

88

faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] >128 μg/mL), while it was toxic to

89

E. faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium

90

smegmatis MC2155 (MIC 64 μg/mL). Cediranib inhibited the growth of Mtb H37Rv

91

with an MIC value of 16 μg/mL. Therefore, cediranib exhibits species-selectivity in

92

suppressing pathogen growth. Next, we performed peptidase assay on human ClpP

93

(hClpP) to estimate the toxicity of cediranib to human mitochondria. As shown in Table

94

1 and S2 Fig, cediranib displayed weak inhibition of hClpP activity compared to

95

MtbClpP1P2, with a selectivity index >10.

96

To gain insights into the inhibitory mechanism of cediranib, we purified and

97

crystallized MtbClpP1P2 in complex with cediranib and benzoyl-Leu-Leu (Bz-LL).

98

The crystals belonged to space group C121 and diffracted to 2.7 Å resolution. The

99

structure was determined by molecular replacement using the previously solved

100

MtbClpP1P2 structure (PDB code 5DZK) as a search model, and the final model was

101

refined to an Rfactor of 20.02% (Rfree =24.33%) (Table 3)[19]. The asymmetric unit

102

has one hetero-tetradecameric complex structure composed of heptameric ClpP1 and

103

ClpP2 rings (Fig 2A). The organization and overall structure remain identical to those

104

in

105

structures[12, 19], presenting an open-pore conformation with 30 and 25 Å diameters

106

in the ClpP1 and P2 rings, respectively (Fig 2B).

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

107

MtbClpP1 and MtbClpP2 share high sequence identity (48%) and have a common

108

core structure, which adopts an α/β-fold consisting of two central twisted β-sheets

109

flanked by seven α-helices and an extended handle domain (Fig 2C). The N-terminal

110

regions of MtbClpP2 are in an extended β-hairpin conformation, and are further

111

stabilized by the MtbClpP2 ring from the crystallographic symmetry unit. The typical

112

catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp) locates in the cleft between the core domain and the handle

113

domain; all 14 active sites distribute on the inner surface of the assembled MtbClpP1P2

114

complex and eventually form the hydrolytic chamber. Bz-LL peptides occupied all

115

cleavage centers in the MtbClpP1ClpP2 tetradecamer, whereas seven cediranib

116

molecules bound within the cleft between MtbClpP1 monomers.

117

Self-association is a common and well-conserved property of Clp protease. The

118

inter-ring interactions are mediated by the handle domain, a strand-turn-helix motif that

119

forms the equatorial regions of the ClpP barrel[20-24]. Compared with the Bz-LL-

120

bound MtbClp1Clp2 structure[19], the additional binding of cediranib slightly reduced

121

the interface area between MtbClpP1 monomers (from 1356 Å2 to 1116 Å2), but does

122

not change the assembly state of the whole complex, suggesting that the inhibitory

123

mechanism of cediranib is different from that of compounds that disrupt the

124

oligomerization of the ClpP complex[25].

125

Cediranib-bound MtbClpP1P2 structure reveals a novel inhibitor binding-site

126

As previously reported[12, 19], the binding sites of Bz-LL and Z-IL are aligned

127

parallel to β-strands 6 and 8 in each subunit and the agonist peptides form several

128

hydrogen bonds with protein main-chain atoms. However, because MtbClpP2 has a

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

129

longer loop after the βG strand (residues 127–129) and thus generates a shallower S1

130

pocket, Bz-LL is bound in opposite orientations in MtbClpP1 and MtbClpP2 (Fig 3A),

131

supporting the notion that MtbClpP1 and MtbClpP2 have different substrate

132

specificities[26]. In MtbClpP1, around the Bz-LL binding site, the averaged 2Fo−Fc

133

electron-density map allowed us to unambiguously build the cediranib molecules

134

between α5 and α3 (Fig 3B and 3C). Cediranib binds this site predominantly via

135

hydrophobic interactions, while its indolyl group forms a cation–π interaction with

136

Arg119 (Fig 2D). Additionally, the quinazoline ring of cediranib interacts with the

137

aromatic rings from Trp174 and the benzoyl group of Bz-LL, resembling a π–π stacking

138

interaction. In contrast to MtbClpP1, the corresponding sites in MtbClpP2 generate a

139

more compact pore, where α5 moves closer to α3 and the large side chains of Met160

140

and Phe83 restrict accessibility to this pocket, making cediranib unable to bind to

141

MtbClpP2 (Fig 3D).

142

Unlike the peptidyl inhibitors that occupy the S1–S3 subsites of ClpP[27],

143

cediranib does not directly interact with the active site, but interferes with the dynamic

144

handle region, which was proposed to be responsible for product release[21, 28](Fig

145

3C and 3E). Though a small channel in the variable handle region of MtbClpP1 was

146

observed in ADEP-MtbClpP1P2 complex in previous study[12], we firstly

147

demonstrated this small channel could be occupied by a small molecule, herein

148

cediranib, and be employed to realize MtbClpP selectivity. As Fig 3F illustrates, the

149

cediranib-binding pocket is formed by α5 (residues Gln142–Glu149), α3 (residues

150

Ile71–Ala76) and three short β-sheets (βD, βF, βH) from the neighboring ClpP1 subunit.

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

151

It is worth noting that α5 is the major part of the handle domain.

152

Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed cediranib interferes the

153

conformational changes of MtbClpP1

154

Previous molecular dynamics simulation studies on SaClpP revealed that α5

155

adopts a kinked conformation by breaking the helix at residue Lys145 (corresponding

156

to Val145 in MtbClpP1)[24]. During the reaction cycle, the handle domain undergoes

157

an unfolding/refolding process, allowing the whole cylindrical ClpP barrel to adopt

158

extended, compact and compressed states[23, 24, 29-31]. In order to analysis the effect

159

of cediranib on the dynamic transition of handle domain, we performed a 500-ns MD

160

simulation on MtbClpP1 dimer (chain B and M) with/without cediranib (S3 Fig). The

161

r.m.s. deviation (RMSD) values of Cα from the head domain and handle domain were

162

monitored, the results indicated that handle domain underwent dramatic conformational

163

changes during the simulation, whereas both the head domain and handle domian of B

164

chain was more stable than that of M chain( S3A Fig and S3C Fig). Next, the secondary

165

structure transformation of handle domain were calculated along the trajectory of

166

simulation by DSSP[24] (S3B Fig and S3D Fig). The profile revealed that the N-

167

terminal part of helix E (residues 133–158) underwent a helical unfolding/refolding

168

process. In the absence of cediranib, the N-terminal part (residues 133–137) in chain B

169

primarily adopted turn structure in 0-350 ns. Then, residues 133–154 adopted coil , turn

170

and 3-10Helix structures. In chain M, residues 143–147 mainly adopted turn structure.

171

With binding of cediranib, the N-terminal part(residues 133–137) of chain B adoped

172

coil and turn strcture in the initial stage (0–300 ns). Subsequently(300-500ns), these

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

173

residues gradually readopted some 3-10Helix and α-helix. By contrast to chain B, chain

174

M was much more unstable, particularly at 250ns, most α-helix structure adopted turn

175

and coil (S3B Fig and S3D Fig). To identify the most significant motions of handle

176

domain of MtbClpP1 dimer induced by cediranib, we performed PCA using the MD

177

trajectory[24]. As shown in S3E Fig and S3F Fig, during the conformational transition,

178

four intermediate conformations (see the 50-ns, 100-ns,300-ns, and 500-ns snapshots

179

in Fig 3E and 3F) was observed. Based on the results of MD simulation and PCA, we

180

constructed a rough energy landscape for the conformational transition of MtbClpP1

181

dimer projected onto the first two principal components, PC1 and PC2. Obviously, the

182

binding of cediranib to MtbClpP1 interferes the conformational changes, likely

183

preventing the protease from accomplishing the enzymatic process.

184

Mutagenesis and functional analysis of the cediranib-binding site

185

As we known, the ClpPs from different species share high sequence similarity

186

(55.0–90.9%) and conserved overall structure (Fig 4A). Consistently, the general and

187

critical gating mechanism of ClpP requires the handle domain to preserve its structural

188

integrity[29]. In the dynamic region of the handle domain (Ser132–Val145 in

189

MtbClpP1), several sites involved in structural stabilization have been identified to be

190

important for ClpP function: Gln132/Glu135 in SaClpP (corresponding to

191

Ser132/Asp135 in MtbClpP1, interacting with Arg171)[23]; Ile149/Ile151 in EcClpP

192

(corresponding to Ile136/Ile138 in MtbClpP1)[21]; and Ala153 in Streptococcus

193

pneumoniae ClpP (corresponding to Ala140 in MtbClpP1) (Fig 3F)[22]. Thus, the

194

cediranib-bound MtbClpP1P2 structure provides additional evidence to highlight the

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

195

critical role of the handle region.

196

To investigate the residues in the cediranib-binding pocket, we introduced

197

different mutations in relevant sites based on sequence alignment (Fig 4B and Table 4).

198

Consistent with the importance of the equatorial pore and handle domain, most site-

199

directed mutations in the selected sites decreased or abolished MtbClpP1P2 activity.

200

Considering Ile71, Met75, Ile146 and Trp174, even when residues with similar side

201

chains were substituted in those sites, the enzyme activity was not retained, suggesting

202

there are constraints on both residue size and chemical properties to maintain the local

203

structural integrity and flexibility (Table 4 and Fig 4C).

204

An electrostatic interaction between two MtbClpP1 subunits (Arg119–Gln142)

205

(Fig 3F) seems to be an important factor mediating the side pore gating, because any

206

substitution that changed the charge properties of either site resulted in reduced or

207

abolished activity. In contrast, sites Met95 and Glu149 of MtbClpP1 exhibit various

208

levels of tolerance to mutation. In particular, Met95Gln and Glu149Leu variants retain

209

activity and have altered sensitivity of MtbClpP1P2 to cediranib, providing a structural

210

basis for the specific recognition between cediranib and MtbClpP1 (Table 4).

211

Discussion

212

ClpP represents a unique type of serine protease complex responsible for the

213

proteolysis of damaged or misfolded proteins. Because it plays critical roles in the

214

regulation of infectivity and virulence of many bacterial pathogens and is involved in

215

various human diseases, interfering with ClpP activity has been evaluated as a potential

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

216

therapeutic strategy in the treatment of different ailments[32]. In-depth understanding

217

of the mechanism of ClpP reaction and regulation is crucial for development of

218

chemotherapeutic agents that target this protein. The importance of the dynamic

219

equatorial region in ClpP has long been recognized[21-24, 29-31].

220

As the first identified inhibitor targeting flexible handle region of ClpP, cediranib

221

shows a distinct inhibitory mechanism. The cediranib-bound MtbClpP1P2 complex

222

structure provides valuable evidence to support the important roles of equatorial handle

223

domain for ClpP function[21][26]. Compared with the highly conserved critical residues

224

in the N-terminal region of α5 (Ile136, Ile138, and Ala140 in MtbClpP1) (Fig 4C),

225

residues participating in cediranib binding are relatively diverse among different ClpP

226

homologs, leading to a substantial variation in the size of the binding pockets near to

227

the side pores, which suggests this mechanism could be employed for pathogen-

228

selective ClpP inhibitor development.

Protein expression and purification. M. tuberculosis ClpP1 (residues 7–200) and

242

ClpP2 (residues 13–214) with N-terminal His6-SUMO tags were expressed and purified

as described, with minor modifications[11, 12, 14]. In short, ClpP1 and ClpP2 were

244

individually overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) in LB broth at 16°C, following

245

induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for about 16 h with

246

shaking at 220 rpm in medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Cells were

resuspended and lysed in buffer containing 50 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 500 mM

KCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. His-tagged MtbClpP1/MtbClpP2

proteins were purified using a nickel affinity column and eluted with the same buffer

250

supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The His6-SUMO tag of eluted proteins was

removed using ubiquitin-like-protease 1 (ULP1) at 4°C. The tag-free proteins were

further purified by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ; GE Healthcare). Peak

concentrated in Amicon centrifugal concentration devices (Millipore) to >80 μM

257

tetradecamer. EcClpP, SaClpP, PaClpP1 and hClpP proteins were expressed as

258

described above. These proteins were purified using a nickel affinity column and then

259

incubated with ULP1 at 4°C to cleave the His6-SUMO tag[36].

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

260

Compound screening. The peptidase activity of MtbClpP1P2 was monitored at 30°C

261

in black 96-well plates, as described[11, 14]. After peptide bond cleavage, the

262

fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin of the fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-

263

AMC is liberated and can be quantified. Briefly, each well contained 100 μM

264

fluorogenic peptide, 0.5 μM tetradecamer ClpP1P2, and 2 mM Bz-LL in 80 μL of buffer

265

containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 5%

266

glycerol. Substrate cleavage was monitored using an all-in-one microplate reader (Gen5;

267

BioTek) by exciting at 380 nm and following the increase in fluorescence emission at

268

460 nm. The deviation of fluorescence value in at least two independent measurements

269

was ≤5%. The screening assay was carried out in 96-well format as described above,

270

and about 2600 compounds were screened at 100 µM. Positive (bortezomib) and

271

negative controls (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) were included on every plate and were

272

used to assess the performance of the primary screen. Bz-LL was purchased from GL

273

Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. Cediranib was purchased from MedChemExpress.

274

IC50 determination. To determine the potency of the 8 “hit” compounds against

275

MtbClpP1P2, these compounds were tested at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 M

276

in a 96-well plate format. The reaction mix contained 0.5 M MtbClpP1P2

277

tetradecamer and 2 mM Bz-LL, with 0.8 L of each dilution of the compound or DMSO

278

in a total volume of 80L. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.8 L of 10 mM

279

fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC (100 M final concentration) to the

280

reaction mix. Initial velocity data was obtained by the monitoring increase in the

281

fluorescence due to hydrolysis of the substrate using the microplate reader at 10-min

intervals over 60 min. The IC50 value for each compound was obtained by nonlinear

283

regression curve fitting of a four-parameter variable slope equation to the dose–

284

response data using Prism software.

285

The peptidase activity of EcClpP, SaClpP, PaClpP1 and hClpP was determined using a

286

fluorescence-based assay with Suc-LY-AMC as the substrate, according to literature

287

protocols[33-35]. The reaction mix contained 0.5 M EcClpP/2.5 M SaClpP/0.5 M

288

PaClpP/3 M hClpP tetradecamer, with 0.8 L of each dilution of the test compound

289

or DMSO in a total volume of 80L. The IC50 values for cediranib against EcClpP,

290

SaClpP, PaClpP1 and hClpP were obtained as described above.

291

Non-competitive inhibition was investigated by using 0.5 M MtbClpP1P2

292

tetradecamer and 2 mM Bz-LL with different concentrations of cediranib. An

293

equivalent volume of DMSO was added to the control group. The serially diluted

294

substrate (500, 400, 300, 200, 100 and 50 μM) was added into wells of a 96-well plate

295

and incubated for 30min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured at 30°C

296

using the microplate reader (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 460 nm) for 1 h[9].

297

Crystallization. Cediranib-MtbClpP1P2 complex crystals were prepared by the

298

hanging drop method referring to previously published works[12, 19]. The precipitant

299

solution consisted of 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5. A drop contained a

300

mixture of 2 μL protein (about 2.5 mg/mL ClpP1 and ClpP2, 0.2 mM cediranib maleate,

301

5 mM Bz-LL, 10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) and 2 μL of

302

precipitant solution and was incubated at 18°C for about 3 months. Crystals were

303

soaked briefly in 2 M Li2SO4 solution and were stored in liquid nitrogen.

Data collection and structure determination. The X-ray data were collected with a

305

CCD camera at station BL-19U of the Shanghai synchrotron radiation facility (SSRF),

306

Shanghai, China. The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the

307

HKL2000 program suite[37]. The process of structure building and refinement was

308

monitored using the COOT and PHENIX suites[38, 39]. The PDB code for the co-

309

crystal structure of cediranib with MtbClpP1P2 (resolution 2.7 Å) is 6IW7.

310

DSC. DSC-based analysis of the thermal denaturation of proteins provides an approach

311

for measuring protein–ligand interactions[40]. Samples for DSC were prepared

312

following the operating manual of the instrument. MtbClpP1P2 was dissolved to a final

313

concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The molar ratio between MtbClpP1P2 and compounds

314

was 10:1 in reaction cells. DSC measurements were performed using a VP-DSC Micro

315

Calorimeter (Microcal, USA) at a scan rate of 0.5–2°C/min in the temperature range

316

10–110°C. Six-pair blank cells with buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 300 mM

317

KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 5% glycerol, with the same volume of DMSO) were prepared

318

to obtain instrumental baselines, which were systematically subtracted from the sample

319

experimental thermograms. A thermal transition curve was obtained from a plot of heat

320

capacity against temperature.

321

Mutagenesis. Thirty-one mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis,

322

primers are listed in Appendix Table S3. The PCR products were extracted with PCR

323

purification kits (Takara 9761) and ligated using a Blunting Kination Ligation Kit

324

(Takara 6217). The mutated sequences of the ClpP1 gene were confirmed by DNA

325

sequencing (Tsingke). Variant ClpP1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21

Inhibiting ClpP1P2 by addressing the equatorial handle domain of ClpP1

326

(DE3) for enzymatic cleavage assays. The IC50 values of cediranib toward MtbClpP1P2

327

mutants were determined in the same way as that for wild-type MtbClpP1P2.

328

Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The molecular dynamics simulations were

329

performed in AMBER 14 software package[41]. The initial coordinates for molecular

330

dynamics simulation were firstly prepared through structural inspection and

331

optimization in Schrödinger software suite[42]. In the tleap module of AMBER,

332

MtbClpP1P2 dimer was solvated in a rectangular water box of TIP3P and neutralized

333

with Na+ ions. The periodic boundary conditions were setup with all the solvents 10 Å

334

away from the solutes. The protein were parameterized using the AMBER FF99SB

335

force field[43] and the ligands were parameterized using the GAFF force filed[44].

336

Energy minimization was performed firstly to remove the local atomic collision in the

337

systems and the combination of the descent steepest with conjugated gradient method

338

was adopted in the process. In the NVT ensemble, the systems were heated from 0 to

339

310 K gradually and the solutes were restrained with harmonic force constant 5

340

kcal/mol/Å2 simultaneously. Five equilibration stages were performed to adjust the

341

solvents density. Finally, 500ns conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations

342

were performed in the NPT ensemble, with coordinates saved every 5 ps throughout the

343

entire process.

344

Data analysis for MD simulation. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the

345

proteins and ligands during the simulations were calculated using the CPPTRAJ

346

module[45] of AmberTools 13 package[41] to characterize the conformational change

347

of the proteins and ligands. Standardized secondary structures assignment analysis were

calculated with the DSSP algorithm using the AmberTools 13 package, which can

349

characterize the propensities of secondary structures for each residue during the

350

simulations. Then the heatmap for DSSP analysis was plotted using the MATLAB

351

package (MathWorks, USA).Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis on the

352

basis of covariance matrix was carried out using the program Carma[46] to address the

353

collective motions of MtbClpP1P2. A two-dimensional representation of Free Energy

354

Landscape (FEL) was built based on the PCA analysis, and two dominant components

355

of PC1 and PC2 were selected as the reaction coordinates. The FEL along the reaction

356

coordinates could be calculated using the following equation[47]:

357

∆G(PC1, PC2) = −κ𝐵 𝑇ln g(PC1, PC2)

358

where T and ĸB represent the temperature of MD simulations and the Boltzmann

359

constant, respectively. The g(PC1,PC2) is the normalized joint probability. Then the

360

structures for the lowest energy in FEL were extracted as the representative

361

conformation of each energy basin. These representative structures were superimposed

362

to the initial crystal structure for comparison.
