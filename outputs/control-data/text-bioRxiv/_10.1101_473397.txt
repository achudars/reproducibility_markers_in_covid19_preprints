SUMMARY

Adherens junctoin (AJ) as the key part of intestinal epithelial barrier plays important role in
the pathogenesis of IBDs. Intestinal specific Ndrg2 loss attenuates E-cadherin expression and
disrupts the integrity of AJ structure which is feasible for colitis and tumor development.

ABSTRACT

Paracellular barriers play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBDs and maintain gut
homeostasis. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been reported to be a
tumor suppressor gene and inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis. However, whether NDRG2
affects colitis initiation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer is unclear. Here, We found
that intestine-specific Ndrg2 deficiency caused mild spontaneous colitis with ageing,
aggravated DSS and TNBS induced colitis, increased AOM-DSS induced colitis-associated
tumor. Ndrg2 loss led to adherens junction (AJ) structure destruction via E-cadherin
expression attenuation, resulting in diminished epithelial barrier function and increased
intestinal epithelial permeability. Mechanistically, NDRG2 enhancing the interaction of E3
ligase FBXO11 with Snail, the repressor of E-cadherin, to promote Snail degradation by
ubiquitination, and maintained E-cadherin expression. In human ulcerative colitis patients,
reduced NDRG2 expression is positively correlated with severe inflammation. These findings
demonstrate that NDRG2 is an essential colonic epithelial barrier regulator and plays
important role in gut homeostasis maintenance and colitis-associated tumor development.

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease mainly

comprising Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) that causes intestinal epithelial cell

injury and relapsing chronic pathogenic rectal and colonic inflammation(Arrieta et al., 2006; de

Souza et al., 2017). Intestinal epithelial homeostasis plays an important role in the intestinal tract.

RESULTS
Intestinal

Ndrg2 knockout mice develops mild spontaneous colitis

To determine the role of NDRG2 in colitis initiation, we generated intestine-specific conditional

Ndrg2

knockout mice featuring intestinal epithelial cells lacking

Ndrg2

(Supplementary figure 1A).

NDRG2 expression was specifically and completely abolished in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)

of

Ndrg2-/-

mice (Supplementary figure 1B, C). The mice were kept in specific-pathogen-free (SPF)

condition and monitored the body weight each week. Intriguingly, we found the obvious growth

retardation of

Ndrg2-/-

mice compared with the wild type (WT) group, especially after 16 weeks

age (figure 1A). However, there was no significant difference of the activity and diet between two

one week to clean up the gut microbiota, and then monitored the body weight in each group

body weight of WT mice after 12 weeks, there was no significant alteration of

To further determine the role of NDRG2 in colitis initiation and progression, we treated the mice

with DSS (Dextran Sodium Sulphate) and TNBS (2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) respectively

to mimic the colitis in vivo. We found that intestinal

Ndrg2-/-

mice exhibited increased body

The aforementioned results prompted us to uncover how

NDRG2 truncations (figure 5B, right panel)(Shen et al., 2018), we found Snail expression was

significantly decreased with full length NDRG2 (NDRG2/FL), but obviously abolished by NDRG2

N-terminal deletion (NDRG2/ΔN) (figure 5B, left panel), suggesting the key role of N-terminal of

NDRG2 for Snail regulation. With chase assay of protein stability, we noticed NDRG2/FL could

obviously shorten the half-life of Snail protein (figure 5C, D). On the contrary, protein stability of

Snail was significantly increased in

Ndrg

DISCUSSION
The gastrointestinal tract (GI) is chronically exposed to large numbers of foreign antigens, toxic

molecules and microorganisms, and the epithelial barrier makes important contributions to GI

health(Peterson and Artis, 2014; Taddei et al., 2008). Epithelial barrier dysfunction is believed to

contribute to IBD initiation and pathogenesis, mainly by damaging the structure of tight junctions
