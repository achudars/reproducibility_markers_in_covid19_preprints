Abstract

2

The gene products that drive early development are critical for setting up developmental trajectories in

3

all animals. The earliest stages of development are fueled by maternally provided mRNAs until the

4

zygote can take over transcription of its own genome. In early development, both maternally deposited

5

and zygotically transcribed gene products have been well characterized in model systems. Previously,

6

we demonstrated that across the genus Drosophila, maternal and zygotic mRNAs are largely conserved

7

but also showed a surprising amount of change across species, with more differences evolving at the

8

zygotic stage than the maternal stage. In this study, we use comparative methods to elucidate the

9

regulatory mechanisms underlying maternal deposition and zygotic transcription across species.

10

Through motif analysis, we discovered considerable conservation of regulatory mechanisms associated

11

with maternal transcription, as compared to zygotic transcription. We also found that the regulatory

12

mechanisms active in the two genomes, maternal versus zygotic, are quite different. For maternally

13

deposited genes, we uncovered many signals that are consistent with transcriptional regulation through

14

control at the level of chromatin through factors enriched in the ovary, rather than precisely controlled

15

gene-specific factors. For genes expressed only by the zygotic genome, we found evidence for previously

16

identified regulators such as Zelda and GAGA-factor, with multiple analyses pointing toward gene-

17

specific regulation. The observed mechanisms of regulation are consistent with what is known about

18

regulation in these two genomes: during oogenesis, the maternal genome is optimized to quickly

19

produce a large volume of transcripts to provide to the oocyte; after zygotic genome activation,

20

mechanisms are employed to activate transcription of specific genes in a spatiotemporally precise

21

manner. Thus the genetic architecture of the maternal and zygotic genomes and the specific

22

requirements for the transcripts present at each stage of embryogenesis determine the regulatory

23

mechanisms responsible for transcripts present at these stages.

Introduction

25

Development is a sequential process, where each step builds on the one before it. The earliest stages of

26

embryonic development are therefore critical, as processes such as cleavage cycles and the beginnings

27

of axial patterning become the basis for all subsequent developmental processes. Regulation of these

28

important tasks is controlled by mRNAs and proteins, and perhaps unsurprisingly then, mRNA levels in

29

Drosophila are found to be precisely controlled during early embryogenesis [1,2]. This precise control of

30

transcript levels is especially remarkable, given that the transcripts at early stages of development come

31

from two different genomes. The first set of transcripts are those deposited into the egg by the mother,

32

while the second set are transcribed from the zygotic genome [3–5]. However, the regulatory

33

mechanisms responsible for this precise control are not yet fully understood.

34

During oogenesis, the oocyte itself is mostly transcriptionally silent [6]. Instead, support cells called

35

nurse cells synthesize RNA, proteins, and organelles which are transported into the oocyte [7]. These

36

maternally produced mRNAs are responsible for many of the critical events of early embryogenesis, such

37

as the rapid cleavage cycles, the establishment of body axis, and the coordination of the handoff of

38

control to the zygotic genome. This handoff of developmental control from mother to zygote, known as

39

the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT), is complex from a regulatory standpoint. Critical housekeeping

40

genes retain a steady transcript level, despite changing the genome of origin. New transcripts must be

41

synthesized from the newly activated zygotic genome, and maternal transcripts must be degraded, in a

42

highly regulated and time-specific manner [8]. This transition is well studied in model systems such as

43

Drosophila melanogaster, where maternal mRNA degradation regulators such as smaug (smg) [8] and

44

regulators critical to the activation of the zygotic genome such as zelda (zld) [9,10] have been identified.

45

When the transition of developmental control between the two genomes is complete, the zygotic

46

genome must be poised to carry out the rest of development in a precise manner. One process that

47

exemplifies the precision required at the handoff to the zygotic genome is segmentation in Drosophila.

48

This process begins with broad maternal gradients which control transcription of early zygotic gap

49

genes, and later pair-rule genes, at precise locations within the embryo at specific developmental times

50

[11,12].

51

Regulation of transcripts in development has been the subject of considerable study in D.melanogaster.

52

Much of this study has been focused around the process of the MZT or other important events in early

53

development, such as patterning along the anterior-posterior or dorsal-ventral axes. For example, a

54

number of regulators of maternal transcript degradation at or prior to the MZT have been identified

55

[13–16]. Zygotic transcription activation has also been the subject of considerable study, and has

56

implicated critical transcription factors such as zelda and grainy head [4]. How transcripts are

57

transported into eggs has been the subject of some study [7,17,18], as has how those maternal

58

transcripts are regulated post-transcriptionally [3,19–23]. Post-transcriptional mRNA regulation is

59

especially crucial at the maternal stage as new transcripts cannot be produced after the completion of

60

oogenesis. However, how transcript production is regulated in the nurse cells is largely unknown. As

61

transcript pools at both the maternal and zygotic stages are highly conserved over evolutionary time

62

[24], we employed a comparative approach to investigate gene regulation at these stages.

63

In this study, we uncover regulatory elements that are associated with transcription in the early

64

Drosophila embryo, from both maternally deposited and zygotically transcribed genes. We use motif

65

analysis to compare regulation of maternal versus zygotic transcription, and also investigate how

66

regulation at these two stages is different across Drosophila species. To this end, we used a previously

67

generated RNAseq dataset from Atallah and Lott, 2018, which sampled embryos from a developmental

68

stage where all transcripts are maternal (stage 2[25,26]) and a stage after zygotic genome activation

69

(end of stage 5 [23,24), across 14 species, representing ~50 million years of divergence time. Here, we

70

used the transcript abundance data from 11 of these species (due to limitations in genome annotation

71

quality, see Methods), representing the same span in divergence time, to examine putative regulatory

72

regions of maternally deposited or zygotically transcribed genes. Through comparisons of these

73

sequences and associated gene transcription levels, we identified a number of sequence motifs as being

74

enriched in either maternally deposited or early zygotically expressed genes. We found a high similarity

75

between motifs across all species, suggesting a high level of conservation for regulation of transcription

76

within each genome (maternal and zygotic). At the stage controlled by maternal transcripts, we found a

77

high number of motifs that bind to proteins annotated with insulator function or that have previously

78

been associated with boundaries between topologically associating domains (TADs). Our findings

79

suggest that maternal transcription is largely controlled through regulation of chromatin state, and not

80

through gene-specific mechanisms. Many transcription factors predicted to bind the identified motifs

81

were found to be enriched in ovaries [27]. After zygotic genome activation (stage 5), we find many of

82

the motifs known to be associated with early zygotic transcription, such as the binding site for the

83

pioneer transcription factor, Zelda, reinforcing many previously identified aspects of transcriptional

84

regulation at this stage. We also find a larger number of motifs with less significant enrichment at this

85

stage, with evidence that points to these motifs regulating a smaller subset of genes. This study provides

86

evidence for global control of maternal transcription at the level of chromatin, while zygotic

87

transcription is regulated in a more gene-specific manner. This is especially striking considering that the

88

maternal transcript pool is more highly conserved than that of the early zygote [24].

Discovered maternal-associated motifs are bind architectural proteins; discovered

To examine the regulatory basis of maternal and zygotic transcription, we surveyed the genomes of 11

Drosophila species for regulatory elements. These species represent the evolutionary divergence of the

94

Drosophila genus, encompassing divergence times from 250,000 to 50 million years [28]. The RNAseq

95

datasets produced from Atallah and Lott (2018)[24] were used. These data sampled two developmental

96

stages, one where all transcripts present are maternally derived (stage 2, Bownes’ stages [25,26]) and

97

the other after zygotic genome activation (the end of stage 5, or the end of blastoderm stage). The

98

transcript abundance data was used to classify each gene as being on or off at both stage 2 and stage 5

99

for each species (see Methods). For each gene, we extracted sequences at likely locations for proximal

100

regulatory elements (see Methods). To accommodate the varying annotation quality of the various

101

species, this search encompassed introns, exons, and a 2kb region upstream of the gene.

102

To identify motifs associated with maternally deposited genes, we employed HOMER [29]. For most

103

species, a characteristic pattern emerged where the most enriched motifs were present in the upstream

104

region of the maternally deposited genes, with less enriched motifs appearing in exons (Fig S1). Some

105

motifs, possibly representing repressor binding sites, were enriched in the upstream and intron region

106

of genes that were not maternally deposited as compared to the genes that were maternally deposited

107

(Fig S1).

108

Analyzing regulatory elements at the post-zygotic genome activation stage (stage 5) presents a

109

challenge, as it is difficult to distinguish newly transcribed zygotic mRNAs from residual maternally

110

deposited mRNAs. At this stage, roughly half of the transcripts present are maternal transcripts that

111

have not yet been degraded [8,30–32]. Therefore, to interrogate regulatory elements associated with

112

zygotic transcription, we restricted our search to genes that do not have transcripts present at stage 2

113

but do have transcripts present by stage 5. Because of these stricter requirements for zygotically

114

transcribed genes, there were far fewer genes in the dataset, resulting in less statistical power.

115

However, without these assumptions, we risk failing to identify signals associated specifically with

116

zygotic transcription amongst the signal of maternal transcription.

117

To determine which proteins are likely to bind to maternal or zygotic motifs, we used Tomtom [33] to

118

evaluate the similarity of the discovered motifs to several motif databases (Table 1) for D. melanogaster.

119

For motifs associated with maternally deposited transcripts, we found a striking similarity between the

120

motifs generated by Ramírez et al. in 2018[34], who discovered a number of motifs associated with

121

topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries in Drosophila S2 cells. TAD boundaries are genomic

122

regions where the chromatin on one side of the boundary interacts substantially less than expected with

123

the chromatin on the other side. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms responsible for

124

generating TAD boundaries in the Ramírez et al. (2018) paper are also responsible for maternal

125

deposition, and that maternal deposition is regulated by the establishment of TAD boundaries. This set

126

of motifs that are found to be associated with TAD boundaries in our study are also similar to the set

127

that were found to be associated with housekeeping core promoters by Zabidi et al. in 2015[35]. This is

128

consistent with existing data showing that functions of maternally deposited genes are enriched for

129

genes with housekeeping activities [36].

130

The motifs associated with maternally deposited genes are predicted to bind several insulators or

131

architectural proteins. An insulator is a regulatory element that suppresses the interactions of other

132

regulatory elements with genes, or prevents the spread of chromatin state. An architectural protein is a

133

protein that organizes and regulates chromatin structure. The most prominent motif by q-value binds to

134

DNA replication-related element factor (DREF), a known architectural protein and the “master key-like

135

factor for cell proliferation” [37]. It is required for normal progression through the cell cycle. It is known

136

to occur in the promoters of many cell proliferation genes and to interact with chromatin remodeling

137

proteins. Interestingly, DREF binding site overlaps with the binding site for BEAF-32, another well-

138

researched protein that acts as an insulator [38,39] that often appears between head-to-head genes

139

(genes with adjacent promoters that get transcribed in opposite directions). Another identified motif is

140

predicted to bind ZIPIC, which is known to bind and recruit CP190, an insulator. A previous study

141

provides evidence for the co-localization of ZIPC and BEAF-32[40], which likely work together with

142

CP190 to perform insulator functions. Thus of the most enriched motifs in maternal genes (DREF, BEAF-

143

32, ZIPC), many have previously identified roles as insulators or in other ways regulating chromatin

144

state.

145

Another maternal motif identified is predicted to bind M1BP (motif-1 binding protein), which causes

146

RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to pause on the gene [41]. Pol II pausing is critical to early zygotic

147

expression[42,43] but its function in producing the maternal transcriptome is unknown. Several

148

functions have been suggested for this Pol II pausing behavior, including maximizing transcription speed

149

once certain conditions are met, synchronizing with RNA processing machinery, reacting to other

150

developmental or environmental signals, keeping chromatin accessible, and acting as an insulator. Given

151

that M1BP is both maternally deposited at high levels and has increased expression in the early embryo,

152

it is possible that M1BP has multiple functions at different time points. During oogenesis, pausing to

153

wait for external signals or RNA processing machinery seems counterproductive to maximizing

154

transcription in the ovary, but the other function of maintaining a state of open chromatin and

155

solidifying TAD boundaries may be very important. In contrast, at stage 5 it may be much more

156

important to maximize expression in response to certain signals.

157

In searching for motifs associated with zygotic expression, we recovered motifs for well-known

158

regulators of the zygotic genome (Table 1). We only identified a small number of highly enriched motifs

159

at this stage, and thus were able to predict a much smaller number of predicted factors binding to these

160

motifs, including Trl (or GAGA factor) and Zelda. Trl is a known early zygotic activator and chromatin

161

remodeler [44–46] and Zelda is known as a “master key regulator” to early developmental genes [9,47]

162

and appears to be a pioneer transcription factor that establishes the initial chromatin landscape of the

163

zygotic genome [5] . In addition to these high-quality motifs, we found a large number of motifs with

164

lower quality scores (Table S1). These motifs may regulate spatio-temporal specific genes that we

165

observe in the early embryo, and thus have a lower enrichment score due to our whole-embryo

166

approach being ill-equipped to finding such specific patterns.

167

Similar motifs appear in different species

168

To quantify the conservation of the discovered motifs across the 11 species in our study, we used

169

Tomtom [33] to measure the similarity between the sets of motifs discovered in different species. For a

170

motif to be considered conserved between two species, we required that it be discovered by HOMER in

171

both species and for Tomtom to report a statistically significant alignment score (see Methods). At the

172

maternal stage, we found that high quality (q-value < 1e-100 by HOMER, see Methods) motifs tended to

173

be well-conserved (Fig 1A) with a large percentage of the total discovered motif content shared across

174

species. We observed that sister species D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis are unique in that they have

175

the highest number of motifs that are either species-specific or are only shared with each other, and

176

have the fewest number of motifs shared with the rest of the species. This is especially noteworthy

177

considering that this lineage is roughly in the middle of the distribution of divergence times from most

178

of the other species, and thus many more distantly related species comparisons have a higher degree of

179

motif conservation than do any comparisons with these two species. This is consistent with previous

180

results [24] that this lineage has a disproportionately high number of changes in transcript abundance

181

for its phylogenetic position, and suggests that these large number of changes in transcript abundance

182

may be due to the large scale changes in regulation in these species observed here . When comparing

183

the rest of the species, we found a relatively higher number of conserved motifs shared between pairs

184

of species within the Drosophila melanogaster species group (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia,

185

D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae), and a slightly reduced number of conserved motifs between the D.

186

melanogaster group species and the more distantly related species (D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis)

187

(Fig 1B). At stage 5, we do not observe a high percentage of conserved motifs between species, rather

188

we observe many motifs that are significantly enriched in just one or two species. We also observe little

189

phylogenetic signal in the data, with the only detectable pattern being that the species with the longest

190

divergence time from the rest of the species, D. virilis and D.mojavensis, have slightly fewer shared

191

motifs (Fig 1 C,D). If the unique motifs at either stage indeed represent newly evolved regulatory

192

mechanisms, we expect that these motifs to be rare or to have a smaller frequency difference between

193

transcribed and non-transcribed genes. Either of these effects would raise the false discovery rate as

194

reported by HOMER, which makes the number of species-specific zygotic motifs identified all the more

195

remarkable.

196

Motif conservation by gene

197

While these results show that some motifs are important to regulation in the genomes of multiple

198

species, do not speak to whether orthologous genes in different species tend to contain similar motifs.

199

To investigate whether regulation was conserved at the level of individual genes, we compared the

200

motif content of each D. melanogaster gene (see Methods) to the motif content of each of its orthologs

201

from other species. We counted motifs as conserved between two species if the motif appeared in both

202

orthologs. For both stage 2 and stage 5, we categorized motifs based on the percent of orthologs for

203

which the motif was conserved (Fig 1E). Motifs have different levels of gene-specific conservation

204

between stages, with maternal stage motifs appearing to have lower conservation across orthologues

205

than zygotic stage motifs, where a larger proportion of orthologues possess the same motif. It is possible

206

that the genes that are missing motifs compared to their orthologues are regulated by different motifs,

207

or that the same motifs that are in radically different positions in different species. As many different

208

maternal motifs appear to be regulating transcription at the level of chromatin state, these motifs may

209

be able to function interchangeably, thus leading to more motif turnover at this stage but with higher

210

conservation of transcription overall [24], as compared to the zygotic stage.

211

Motif position

212

While similar binding motifs identified in multiple species implies that regulatory proteins with similar

213

binding domains are acting in these species, we can also verify the similarity in the regulatory machinery

214

by the relative positions of the binding sites relative to the genes they are regulating. To investigate

215

whether the discovered motifs had the same positional relationship with the transcription start site

216

(TSS) across all species, we generated position frequency data for each motif. For each gene, we

217

examined each position starting from 2kb upstream of the TSS to the 3’ end of the gene body, and

218

whether there was a motif at that position. Many of the most prominent motifs shared a similar

219

distribution pattern, characterized by a strong peak at -100bp, and sometimes a secondary peak at -

220

340bp (Fig S2). To quantify this similarity, we performed an Anderson-Darling test on each motif for

221

each pair of species, which indicated that 65% (stage 2) and 91% (stage 5) of motif distributions are

222

identical between species (percent of motifs for which p < .05). This suggests conservation of the

223

relationship between binding to these motifs and initiation of transcription. The higher conservation of

224

motif position in stage 5, which has fewer conserved motifs between species than stage 2, may be

225

consistent with this stage having more gene-specific regulation, as discussed further below.

226

Motif Strandedness

227

While some studies focus on finding motifs with a particular orientation relative to their proximal genes

228

[48], there is some evidence that motifs do not behave in a strand-specific manner[49]. To evaluate the

229

importance of the strandness of the discovered motifs, we generated a regression to predict expression

230

level that differentiated between forward and reverse versions of each motif (see Methods). This

231

regression indicated a significant difference between the forward and reverse versions of many motifs.

232

For example, we found the E-box motif affects the log-odds of maternal deposition by .192 in the

233

forward orientation but only .115 in the reverse orientation (t-test, p < .001). Almost all motifs had the

234

same sign coefficients, but with different magnitudes, indicating that while motifs had the same effect

235

regardless of orientation, their efficiency could be increased if the orientation was optimal.

236

While the strandedness of motifs may play a small role in their overall effect, we want to know if

237

strandedness makes a qualitative difference to our motifs effects on transcript level, and if we can use

238

motif strand to improve our model. To determine this, we ran HOMER exclusively on the same strand

239

that the gene appeared on, rather than the default mode of scanning both strands. This resulted in the

240

same set of motifs being discovered. This is consistent with the regression results that show that the

241

two strands of the motifs generally have the same sign, indicating an effect in the same direction on

242

transcript level. To evaluate the overall effectiveness of this strategy, we constructed another regression

243

using only the data from the same-strand motifs. This regression performed less well than the

244

regression using motifs from both strands (AIC = 7915.8 for the unstranded regression, AIC = 8612.5 for

245

the stranded regression for a representative species D. ananassae). Overall, this suggests that motif

246

binding elements need not bind in a strand specific manner to induce their effects, though the optimal

247

orientation provides measurable increase in their effect on transcription. This result is the same at both

248

stage 2 and stage 5.

249

GO analysis

250

While we have identified a set of motifs that together seem to be responsible for early embryonic RNA

251

content, we next asked if these motifs are likely to be regulating genes with specific types of functions.

252

To this end, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on groups of genes, based on their motif

253

content. To simplify this analysis, we chose to focus on the top 8 motifs as reported by HOMER, and for

254

each of the 8 motifs, we compared their enrichment relative the enrichGO function in the clusterProfiler

255

R package [50,51]. 8 motifs were chosen to include representatives from both known and unknown

256

motifs. When comparing stages, we observe no overlap between GO terms. (Fig 3A), which is consistent

with our expectations that the genes that are activated in the zygote have different functionality to

those transcripts that are maternally deposited. Many of the stage 2 motifs show a similar pattern in the

259

GO categories they are associated with, with the strongest associations belonging to the DREF motif,

260

which is strongly associated with most identified categories (Fig 3B). This could be an indication that

261

there is a high degree of homogeneity in terms of the types of genes these motifs may regulate. In

262

contrast, the stage 5 motifs show more variety in the GO terms of genes they are associated with (Fig

263

3C), which could be indicative of more specific regulation at this stage.

264

Predicted maternal motif binding proteins are enriched in the ovary

265

Next, we investigated whether the potential motif binding proteins we identified were plausible

266

regulators of maternal deposition. It is unclear whether the motifs we identified as enriched in

267

maternally deposited genes are associated specifically with maternal deposition, given that chromatin

268

regulators are important at all stages in all tissues. To investigate, we used modENCODE [52] transcript

269

abundance data to compare the mRNA transcript levels for proteins predicted to bind our discovered

270

motifs, and found increased expression in ovaries (Fig 4A) as compared to other tissues sampled. This

271

pattern exists, though to a lesser extent, in the FlyAtlas 2 dataset [53] , which is a tissue-specific

272

database of transcript levels that utilizes RNA-seq data rather than microarray analysis. The discrepancy

273

between the two datasets could be due to the differences in gene expression measurement method or

274

in experimental methods. While it has been demonstrated that mRNA levels do not necessarily mirror

275

protein levels [54], the enrichment of mRNA in ovaries compared to other tissues is reasonable evidence

276

that these proteins are important in ovaries.

277

To investigate whether these proteins are acting to affect transcription in the ovaries specifically, we

278

examined the expression profiles of RNA in various tissue types (referenced in Fig 3B) from existing RNA

279

quantification datasets [52,55]. For each instance of a motif of interest, we extracted the transcript level

280

from within a 20kb window surrounding the motif and measured the normalized relative transcript level

281

for each position (an example of this is shown in Fig 3B). While the relative normalized transcript level

282

changes in each of the measured tissues, the effect is strongest in ovaries, indicating that the presence

283

of one of these binding sites is associated with a higher increase in transcript levels in the ovary

284

compared to other tissues.

285

As the motifs associated with maternal transcription also act to some degree in other tissues, we next

286

wanted to ask whether the motifs were more enriched in maternally deposited genes than in genes

287

expressed in other tissues. To determine whether regulation in different tissue types were associated

288

with different motifs, we ran HOMER in the same manner as with the maternal stage data to discover

289

enriched motifs (see Methods) in transcripts present in other tissues, as identified from ModENCODE

290

data [56]. We found that most other tissue types were also enriched in the same motifs discovered in

291

transcripts present in stage 2 embryos. However, examining the frequency of motifs in specific genes

292

revealed that the majority of those motifs were from genes that were shared between those tissue

293

types and stage 2 embryos. When we exclude genes that are expressed in stage 2 embryos, HOMER fails

294

to identify the original set of motifs as enriched in male larval gonads, male reproductive tract, adult

295

heads and adult midgut. Furthermore, HOMER detects the motifs at a lesser rate in larval ovaries, larval

296

CNS, and intestinal tract. Despite being identified in fewer tissue types and at a lesser rate in other

297

tissue types as compared to the stage 2 expression levels, the observation that these motifs may also

298

have important functions in other tissue types is consistent with the literature. For example, DREF is

299

known to be important for cell proliferation and chromatin regulation, and is active in many other

300

tissues [57,58]. These motifs are likely associated with many housekeeping genes that are vital to a

301

variety of tissue types.

302

Maternally deposited genes are physically clustered on the genome

303

In addition to motifs, we observed several other effects that were related to early embryonic RNA

304

content. Given that many of our discovered motifs bind architectural proteins, we hypothesize many

305

effects may be linked to the physical location of genes on the chromosome. We examined the positional

306

distribution of transcribed genes in various tissue types. As previous papers utilizing the Hi-C method

307

have shown correlation with active topologically associated domains (TADs) and gene expression

308

[59,60], we predicted that any tissue type where regulation is dominated by architectural proteins to

309

transcribe a set of genes physically clustered on the chromosome. To compare the physical gene

310

clustering of transcription at the maternal stage with that of other tissue types, we acquired several

311

RNAseq datasets from NCBI/GEO [61] and performed a Wald–Wolfowitz runs test [62] on each tissue of

312

the previously described tissue types. While all tissues examined showed a strong preference for

313

groupings of transcribed genes, ovaries were the most grouped (Fig 4B). This result was robust to

314

changes in the threshold of what is considered to be expressed (see Methods). This pattern of physical

315

co-expressed gene clustering on the chromosome is consistent with our model of regulation via

316

architectural proteins.

317

While these results speak to the pattern of clustering of expression for maternal genes in terms of

318

adjacent genes being on or off, they do not account for the distance between genes. To answer the

319

question of whether this clustering phenomenon is dependent on distance, we examined the distance to

320

adjacent genes. We observed a trend whereby proximity to an active promoter increases the odds of

321

maternal deposition (Fig 4C). This effect was slightly affected by the strandedness of the two genes

322

whereby genes that have an opposite orientation are more likely to have different expression. This is

323

consistent with observations from previous studies [34] that consecutive genes on the same strand were

324

more likely to show co-expression, while consecutive genes on opposite strands were more likely to

325

have different expression.

326

Many previous studies have observed that zygotic genes tend to be short in length [24,30,63,64]. In

327

addition to affecting transcription speed, shorter gene lengths result in a smaller distance between

328

transcriptional units along the chromosome, especially when considering which strand the gene is on. To

329

explore gene length in maternal genes and the relationship between gene length and the position on

330

the chromosome, we measured the maternal deposition rates with respect to gene length. We observed

331

a trend that in most species, shorter genes are less likely to be maternally deposited. There are

332

differences in the length of maternal genes across species, and this trend could be partly due to the bias

333

for more highly annotated genomes to be enriched in shorter genes (Fig 4D). Additionally, chromatin

334

context seems to heavily influence this effect: when the adjacent genes are off, gene length is much

335

more important (Fig 4C) and very short genes are very likely to be off. This could be because shorter

336

genes are more likely to be influenced by the regulatory machinery of a nearby gene. Alternatively,

337

longer genes might be long enough to physically isolate themselves more effectively and establish their

338

own unique regulatory environment.

339

Given that a number of motifs found in this study are bound by proteins annotated as insulators, and

340

the motifs are similar to those that are associated with TAD boundaries, we asked whether the dataset

341

shows properties consistent with these motifs acting as insulators. To determine whether these motif

342

binding sites were associated with proteins acting as insulators, in the sense that they were blocking the

343

action of a nearby enhancer or the spread of chromatin state, we assessed the transcription of nearby

344

genes relative to the transcription of a gene with these identified motifs. For each regulatory region, the

345

gene nearest to that regulatory region was examined, as well as two genes downstream and two

346

upstream. The frequency of motifs was measured based on the transcript abundance pattern of these

347

five genes. Many of the top motifs including Dref, M1BP, Zipic, and E-box, occur more frequently in the

348

center of maternally deposited gene clusters, rather than on the edge of clusters. (t-test p-values 7e-3,

349

2e-6,3e-10, and 1e-4 respectively). This is consistent with previous results that suggest architectural

350

proteins are prevalent in the centers of TADs as well as the edges[34].

351

Stage-specific genes are isolated on the genome

352

Given that maternally deposited genes are physically clustered together in the genome, we wanted to

353

examine if this pattern held with the set of genes that were stage-specific. To determine if consecutively

354

expressed cluster size is related to stage-specificity of transcript representation, we examined maternal-

355

only (transcripts present at stage 2 and entirely degraded by stage 5) and zygotic-only genes (transcripts

356

present at stage 5, not present at stage 2; for both stage-specific categories, see Methods for further

357

definitions) and their frequencies in clusters of different sizes. We determined that for most species,

358

both maternal-only and zygotic-only genes are more likely to be in smaller (1-3 consecutive maternally

359

deposited) groups than in larger groups (more than 3 consecutive genes) (Fig 5, A and B). For zygotic-

360

only genes, this could be an indication that control at the zygotic level is more specific, affecting single

361

genes rather than larger clusters. Meanwhile, maternal-only genes being in small groups could more

362

likely to have more specific regulation than that of all maternal genes as a whole

363

GC-content of upstream regions

364

In Drosophila, transcription start sites are frequently associated with a spike in GC content [65]. To

365

explore this phenomenon with respect to the two developmental stages we examined, we evaluated the

366

average GC content of upstream regions for genes in stage 2 and stage 5. When comparing the GC-

367

content of putative cis-regulatory sequences in maternally versus non-maternally deposited genes, we

368

observed an increase in GC-content upstream of the TSS (Fig S3), as well as a dip in GC content ~200bp

369

upstream of these genes. This modulation in GC-content has been previously observed in Drosophila as

370

well as humans [65]. To determine whether this modulation of GC-content was predictive of maternal

371

deposition, we constructed four generalized linear models using the GC-content, the motif data, and

16

372

both the motif data and GC-content as data sources (see Methods). Adding the GC-content to the model

373

that already included motif data improved the model (AIC: 185589 without GC content AIC:183079 with

374

GC content), hence increased GC content upstream of TSS is somewhat predictive of maternal

375

deposition, even when accounting for motif presence in this region.

376

377

Discussion

378

Maternally deposited gene products are responsible for the first stages of embryonic development in all

379

animals [66]. It is therefore critical that the required kind and amount of mRNAs and proteins are

380

deposited into the unfertilized egg. Later in development, the zygotic genome becomes transcriptionally

381

active and takes over control of development from maternal mRNAs. Failure in maternal mRNA

382

deposition, zygotic genome activation, or the transfer of developmental control between the two

383

genomes can lead to lethality [1,9,13], thus the gene products regulating early development are critical

384

to organismal survival.

385

Previous research has shown that the maternal and zygotic mRNA expression profiles of different

386

species of Drosophila are generally conserved, but with some noticeable differences [24]. To identify the

387

regulatory basis of trascription at these stages, we leveraged a large comparative dataset to identify the

388

transcription factor binding motifs found in the cis-regulatory sequences of these genes. We identified

389

transcription factor binding motifs that are associated with mRNA expression across species for

390

maternally deposited transcripts and zygotically expressed transcripts. We also investigated the effects

391

of other regulatory mechanisms such as chromatin state on maternal and zygotic expression of mRNAs,

392

as well as the association of transcript levels at these two stages of embryogenesis with gene length,

393

strandedness, and GC content.

394

Maternal Regulation

395

We found that motifs associated with putative cis-regulatory regions of maternally deposited genes

396

are predominantly annotated as insulator binding sites. An insulator is a type of regulatory element

397

that can block the interactions of cis-regulatory elements with promoters or prevent the spread of

398

chromatin state. Insulators are known to be important in creating and maintaining the gene

399

expression patterns, ubiquitous in Drosophila, and potentially a key factor for Drosophila to maintain

400

such a high gene density [40]. Here, we find that the process of maternal deposition may rely heavily

401

on insulators to express a large percentage of the genome. Because the roles and mechanisms of

402

factors annotated as insulators are not well understood, using the term “Architectural Protein”

403

instead of insulator binding protein may be more appropriate [67]. Recently, these proteins have

404

been studied using genome-wide chromatin organization methods, such as Hi-C, which detects

405

regions of interacting chromatin known as Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) and identifies

406

boundaries between them. Histone marks appear to be enriched in certain TADs but stop abruptly at

407

TAD boundaries, supporting the idea that certain TADs are entirely transcriptionally silenced while

408

others are expressed [34]. Furthermore, ChIP-seq has demonstrated that TAD boundaries in other

409

tissues are enriched in architectural protein binding sites [34] , including several those that we

410

identified in this study.

411

To understand the connection between architectural proteins and maternal deposition, we need to

412

examine where these transcripts are produced to understand the cellular context. In the ovary, nurse

413

cells are responsible for the transcription of maternally deposited genes, and there is a considerable

414

body of literature devoted to nurse cell biology. Much study has been directed towards elucidating

415

how nurse cells transport their products into the oocyte and how post translational control

416

mechanisms fine-tune protein levels of maternal transcripts [3,7,18–23,68]. However, despite this

417

wealth of knowledge, the regulatory mechanisms by which the nurse cells specify which genes to
18

418

transcribe are largely unknown. One unusual feature of nurse cells is that they are highly polyploid

419

[69,70]. One of the major benefits of this could be an across-the-board increase in transcription rates

420

necessary to provision the embryo with all necessary transcripts. These transcripts represent a large

421

proportion of the genome, with estimates ranging from 50-75%, depending on experimental

422

conditions [3], and necessitate large amount of transcription overall in a short period of time. We

423

extract >100ng total RNA from an embryo; this is an astonishingly large amount of RNA to be present

424

in what is essentially at the time of fertilization a single, albeit a highly specialized, cell. One point of

425

comparison is Abruzzi et al. 2015, [71] who extracted 2-5pg RNA per Drosophila neuron. A

426

transcriptional environment that is optimized to quickly transcribe huge numbers of genes might be

427

more amenable to control via chromatin state.

428

Given the amount of overlap between the motifs enriched in the cis-regulatory regions of maternally

429

deposited genes and the motifs associated with TAD boundaries, it is possible that these same

430

architectural proteins are functioning to define which genes are maternally transcribed and then

431

deposited into the embryo. We found that the maternally deposited genes are highly clustered on

432

the genome, which is indicative of control via architectural proteins. Additionally, we uncovered that

433

proximity to nearby expressed genes is highly correlated with expression. We also identified a

434

pattern whereby the relative strandedness of adjacent genes is indicative of whether they will be

435

maternally deposited, which is a pattern that has been previously observed with insulators [34]. Each

436

of these results is consistent with known behavior of architectural proteins, suggesting that

437

expression at stage 2 is controlled locally on the chromosome by activating TADs rather than specific

438

genes.

439

As architectural proteins are important in determining genome organization and regulating transcription

440

to some degree in all tissues and stages, we investigated whether the regulatory patterns we observed

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/769638; this version posted September 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

441

for maternal genes were ovary-specific or shared across all stages and tissues. Many of the motif binding

442

elements discovered in this analysis appear to be enriched in ovaries, although these proteins have

443

important functions in other tissues as well. Some of the proteins predicted to bind our motifs have

444

been noted for being enriched in the regulation of housekeeping genes, and as maternally deposited

445

genes themselves are enriched in housekeeping genes, this result is perhaps unsurprising. A number of

446

studies have suggested that in addition to the common architectural proteins shared across conditions

447

and developmental stages, there may exist tissue-specific architectural proteins that integrate into the

448

canonical protein complex to produce tissue-specific TAD patterns [72–74]. Perhaps this is the case with

449

the ovary, and further study will reveal whether there are ovary-specific factors that may interact with

450

the common architectural proteins whose binding sites we find enriched here. For example, the authors

451

of Mataz et al. 2012 [75] suggest that Shep may be a tissue-specific factor interacting with architectural

452

proteins in the central nervous system. The enrichment Shep in the central nervous system is even less

453

extreme than the enrichment we observe of CP190 (a known interaction partner of ZIPC, one of our

454

maternal expression associated motifs) in ovaries, suggesting that CP190 could also qualify as tissue-

455

specific. Alternatively, the polyploid nature of nurse cells and the extensive and rapid transcription that

456

occurs in these cells may instead provide an extreme enrichment of the common architectural proteins,

457

without the need for stage or tissue specific architectural proteins.

458

Our results show that regulation in ovaries is accomplished primarily through architectural proteins that

459

establish general regions of open chromatin. This process can turn on a large percentage of the genome,

460

without the need to maintain specific motifs within specific genes. However, this leaves us with the

461

question of how the stage 2 mRNA content is so highly conserved across species overall [24], as

462

regulation at the chromatin level would appear less precise than gene-specific regulation. Perhaps

463

regulatory control primarily at the level of chromatin provides redundancy to maintain transcription

464

despite the gain or loss of individual binding sites. Alternatively, there could be other levels of regulatory
20

465

control that we are unable to detect, with the signal from chromatin-level control being so strong during

466

this time. The high level of conservation of maternal transcripts is also remarkable given the importance

467

of post-transcriptional regulators at this stage [3,19,23,76], as it is not clear if conservation at the

468

transcript level is necessary for conservation at the protein level.

469

Zygotic Regulation

470

Our examination of motifs that are associated with zygotic mRNA expression revealed several previously

471

discovered motifs, including those that bind Zelda and GAGA factor (Trl). Additionally, several motifs are

472

likely binding sites for other well-characterized developmental proteins (Table S1) which are sometimes

473

highly localized in the embryo. If transcripts are produced in a spatially localized manner, they are

474

necessarily not expressed in the entire embryo, and thus their signal may be more difficult to detect in

475

our data from whole embryos. Overall, we observe few motifs at stage 5 that are conserved across

476

species, in comparison to motifs for maternally deposited genes. However, the motifs that we do find at

477

stage 5 tend to higher conservation within specific genes than the motifs we discover at stage 2. This

478

highlights that it may be more important for specific genes to have precise signals after ZGA.

479

Additionally, in our zygotic analysis, we focused only transcripts that are present at stage 5 and do not

480

have a maternal component, as many maternally deposited transcripts are still present at stage 5

481

(roughly half of maternal transcripts are still present at this stage [8,30–32]). Because many maternal

482

transcripts are still present, analysis of the total stage 5 transcriptome would largely recapitulate the

483

stage 2 results, especially as stage 5 transcripts are much more likely to be expressed in specific spatio-

484

temporal patterns, which to our whole-embryo analysis would appear as low or noisy signal. Our

485

decision to remove transcripts with maternal deposition highlights the signals that are unique to stage 5,

486

but comes at the cost of an overall reduction in the number of genes available for analysis, resulting in

487

higher false discovery rates for all motifs.

488

Conclusions

489

In this study, we examined regulatory elements associated with maternal transcripts present at stage 2

490

of embryogenesis and zygotic transcripts present at stage 5 across species of Drosophila. At both stages,

491

we found regulatory motifs that are conserved throughout the ~50 million years of divergence

492

represented by these species, which speaks to a conservation of regulatory mechanisms across the

493

genus. In general, the high degree of conservation in regulatory elements at the maternal stage and the

494

zygotic stage, while different from one another, speaks to the critical nature of the complement of

495

transcripts present to direct early embryogenesis. The differing patterns observed in the obscura group

496

species (D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis), and the regulatory basis of changes in transcript

497

representation between species are the subject of ongoing study. At the maternal stage, we found many

498

regulators that appear to be defining general regions of the genome to be transcribed via chromatin

499

regulation through architectural proteins and likely at the level of TADs. Given the exceptionally high

500

level of conservation of maternal transcript deposition, the relatively non-specific mechanism of

501

maternal gene regulation appears contradictory. In contrast, we found zygotic regulatory elements to be

502

considerably more gene-specific. The different patterns of regulation for transcripts present at these

503

two stages of embryogenesis is consistent with the specific transcriptional contexts of these two

504

genomes, with the non-specific mechanism active in highly transcriptionally active polyploid nurse cells

505

in oogenesis in the mother, and the gene-specific mechanism acting in the zygote where transcription is

506

often localized in time and space.

Methods

509

Data Acquisition

510

RNA-seq data utilized for this study was generated previously [24], and is available at NCBI/GEO at

511

accession number GSE112858. This dataset contains RNA-Seq data from single embryos. Embryos were

512

collected either at stage 2, representing a time point before zygotic genome activation, and at the end

513

of stage 5, representing a time point after widespread zygotic genome activation. Embryos were

514

collected from 14 species, however we only used the data from 11 (D. simulans, D. sechellia, D.

515

melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis)

516

due to annotation deficiencies in the remaining 3. GTF files and references genomes from previously

517

sequenced species [28] were downloaded from Flybase [77].

518

To determine whether a gene would be labeled as ‘off’ or as ‘on’, the overall distribution of FPKMs was

519

analyzed. For all species, for both stage 2 and stage 5, a bimodal distribution appeared, with one peak at

520

0 and another at approximately e3.5. The commonly used cutoff of FPKM=1 [78,79] was chosen as it falls

521

between these two distributions.

522

To determine which genes were orthologues, we used the FlyBase orthology table

523

“gene_orthologs_fb_2014_06_fixed.tsv”.

524

Sequence Selection

525

Preliminary tests were performed to determine which regions were most likely to have regulatory

526

elements. For each gene, several regions were extracted: 10kb upstream,5kb upstream, 2kb upstream,

527

1kb upstream, 500bp upstream, 5’ UTR, total introns, total exons, and 3’ UTR. For each region,

528

530

and thus were used for matching motifs in external databases, measuring motif overlap between

531

species, analysing motif position distributions, and GO analysis. For these analysis (featured in figures 1

532

through 3 double check), UTRs were ignored as not every species had annotated UTRs.

533

Motif Discovery

534

We used HOMER [29] to discover motifs in test sets using the background sets as control FASTA files,

535

test and background sets are defined below. Deviations from the default settings include the use of the -

536

fasta flag to specify a custom background file. For stage 2 queries, the test FASTA files included genes

537

that had a FPKM >= 1 at stage 2 while the control FASTA files included genes that had an FPKM < 1. For

538

the stage 5 queries, the test FASTA files contained genes where the stage 5 FPKM >= 1 and the stage 2

539

FPKM < 1, while the control FASTA files included genes whose stage 5 FPKM < 1 and stage 2 FPKM < 1.

540

Additionally, we used the -p flag to utilize our computational resources more efficiently. We used -

541

norevopp flag in the case of strand-specific searches. Motif quality was evaluated based on the HOMER-

542

outputted q-values.

543

To validate the HOMER output files we used MEME[33] v4.12.0 and RSAT [80]. MEME was run using-

544

mod zoops -nmotifs 2 -minw 8 -maxw 12 -revcomp. The RSAT analysis uses the purge-sequences tool,

545

followed by oligo-analysis using the following parameters: -lth occ_sig 0 -uth rank 5000 -return

546

occ,proba,rank -2str -noov -quick_if_possible -seqtype dna -l 8, followed by pattern-assembly using the

547

following parameters: -v 1 -subst 1 -toppat 5000 -2str, followed by matrix-from-patterns using the

548

following parameters: -v 1 -logo -min_weight 5 -flanks 2 -max_asmb_nb 10 -uth Pval 0.00025 -bginput -

549

markov 0 -o purged_result.

550

Zygotic-Only Motifs

551

To examine the regulatory elements associated with zygotic transcripts, we defined genes as being

552

zygotic only if they were off at stage 2 (FPKM <1) and on at stage 5 (FPKM >1). It is necessary to impose

553

such a restriction, as a large percentage (approximately 95%) of genes that are maternally deposited are

554

still expressed at stage 5, and analysis of their regulatory mechanisms would confound the signal of

555

stage 5 only genes.

556

Motif Sharing

557

To determine weather motifs were shared between species, the HOMER-formatted motifs were

558

converted to meme-formatted motifs using chem2meme from the MEME Suit [33]. Tomtom, also from

559

the MEME Suit, was then used to find matching motifs, using default parameters. For a motif to be

560

considered shared with another species, the Tomtom output threshold of α = .05 was used. this

561

technique was used to calculate the similarity of motifs found in different species, as well as to evaluate

562

the similarity of different motif discovery strategies using MEME, RSAT, or HOMER with alternative

563

parameters.

564

To refine the results of shared motifs, we applied an additional quality cutoff. For stage 2, motifs were

565

first filtered for a q-value of less than 1e-100, and for stage 5, motifs were first filtered for a q-value of

566

1e-10. The difference in the cutoffs used at the two different stages was due to the differences in the

567

overall distribution of q-values for these stages due to a reduced number of zygotic-only genes (see

568

zygotic-only motifs above).

569

Because sharing was calculated on a by-species basis, it is possible that one species has a motif that

570

meets the criteria for being shared among all other species while other species’ version of that same

571

motif failing to meet the criteria. This can occur, for example, when a motif is an intermediary version of

572

two motifs that fall just outside the cutoff.

573

To find proteins that bind to the discovered motifs, we used Tomtom to query JASPAR and Combined

574

Drosophila Databases using the default parameters[81].

575

Motif Position and Count

576

Motif position was determined by using the scanMotifGenomeWide tool to in the HOMER package.

577

Queries were performed by scanning the discovered motifs against the fasta files for each gene. The 5’

578

boundary of the motif was used as the motif position. For the motif counts per gene used in many

579

downstream analyses analysing motif position distributions, GO analysis, GC content analysis, and motif

580

strand analysis. We used this output and counted the occurrence of a given motif in the target region.

581

To quantify positional distribution similarity, we used the stats.anderson_ksamp function from the scipy

582

library V1.2.1[82]. Distributions were considered to be different at α = .05 after Bonferroni correction.

583

Transcript Enrichment by Tissue

584

Expression data for various adult tissues was downloaded from modENCODE[56]. To compare

585

enrichment for transcripts with different magnitudes of abundance, we applied an additional

586

normalization. For each transcript, transcript levels in FPKMs were divided by a scaling factor equal to

587

the average of the expression levels in ovaries. This normalization preserves the relative abundances

588

within each transcript, but allows for visualization of transcript levels with dramatically different overall

589

expression levels.

590

Expression by Position

591

D. melanogaster expression data by position was downloaded from modENCODE [56] for several tissue

592

types. Positions for each motif was determined as previously described in the Motif Position and Count

593

section above. For each instance of the motif of interest, we determined expression values in area from

594

-10kb to +10kb. Transcript abundance in FPKMs were then normalized by the average FPKM reported on

595

the track.

596

GO Analysis

597

We used the R package clusterProfiler 3.10.1 [50] and the org.Dm.eg.db 3.7.0 [83] dictionary to perform

598

gene ontology (GO) analysis. For the stage 2 comparison, we generated a test set of the melanogaster

599

gene names for every gene in our dataset that was maternally deposited in at least any 7 of our species,

600

and performed an enrichment analysis using enrichGO’s default parameters using a background set of

601

all D. melanogaster genes. For the stage 5 comparison, we generated a test set of the D. melanogaster

602

gene names for which at least two orthologues in our dataset showed zygotic-only expression (see

603

Zygotic-only motifs section above for definition). This threshold approximates the percent of the

604

genome that we observed to be zygotic only. We then performed an enrichment analysis using

605

enrichGO’s default parameters using a background set of D. melanogaster genes that are not maternally

606

deposited in at least two species. This analysis therefore specifically examines the zygotically activated

607

genes in the context of genes that are “off” at stage 2 ( FPKM<1 at this stage). For our analysis of stage 2

608

motifs, we generated a test set for each motif consisting of genes that contained that motif in at least

609

two species and were maternally deposited (FPKM > 1) in at least two species. We then performed an

610

enrichment analysis using enrichGO’s default parameters using a background set of all D. melanogaster

611

genes. For our analysis of stage 5 motifs, we generated a test set for each motif using genes that were

612

represented by transcripts >1 FPKM at stage 5 in at least two species and had the motif of interest in at

613

least two species. We then performed an enrichment analysis using enrichGO’s default parameters

614

using a background set of D. melanogaster genes that were represented by transcripts >1 FPKM at stage

615

5. To visualize our results, we employed the dotplot method for enrichGO objects, also from the

616

clusterProfiler package. For each motif, the top 3 GO terms were identified and added to the y-axis

617

labels. Whenever any GO category from another motif was identified as statistically significant (α = .05),

618

that GO category was shaded appropriately.

619

Model Fitting

620

Logistic regression was performed using the “glm” function in R, using the logit link function. As inputs,

621

we used the list of motifs generated from HOMER and their counts as described in the “Motif Position

622

and Count” section above. To avoid redundant motifs in our model, only motifs of size 10 were

623

considered. To evaluate the strand-specificity of motifs, we compared two generalized linear models

624

using the formulas indicated in S1_Model_Generation.pdf. To identify the most important motifs, the R

625

function stepAIC from the MASS library 7.3-51.4[84] was used to find generate an ordered list of motifs.

626

The base model used contained no additional features (chromatin state, etc). StepAIC was run 8 steps to

627

generate a short list of motifs for evaluation.

628

Analysis of physical clustering of co-expressed genes

629

To evaluate the effect of gene cluster size on expression, we iterated through each species for both

630

stage 2 and stage 5 and assigned sizes of co-expressed gene clusters on the chromosome, based on how

631

many adjacent genes were coexpressed, resulting in cluster size frequencies for each genome. Errors

632

were calculated using 95% confidence interval for a two-tailed binomial distribution.

633

To compare the clustering of different datasets with varying percents of “on” genes, we employed the

634

Wald–Wolfowitz runs test.

635

Tissue-specific RNA Levels

636

modENCODE tissue profiles [52] were downloaded from flybase.org . Flyatlas2 tissue profiles were

637

downloaded from http://flyatlas.gla.ac.uk/FlyAtlas2/ [53].

638

Gene length

639

To determine gene length, we examined the relevant line of the appropriate .GFF file and took the

640

difference between the end and the start positions.

28

641

Distance between genes

642

To determine the distance between genes, we look at the appropriate .GFF file and took the difference

643

of positions between adjacent genes from transcription start site (TSS) to TSS.

644

Maternal deposition rates as compared to gene length, distance, and orientation

645

Genes were binned by category and by either distance or length. For the top plot, 150 bins of 70bp

646

width were used. For the bottom plot, 60 bins of 70bp width were used and bins with fewer than 6

647

genes were disregarded. confidence intervals were calculated using the binomial distribution with α =

648

.05 after Bonferroni.

649

GC content

650

GC content levels associated with each gene were evaluated by calculating the number of GC

651

nucleotides within a sliding window of size 50bp for each of 1950 window positions to cover the

652

upstream 2kb of each gene. To evaluate the first bin of each gene, the region from -1bp to -50bp was

653

extracted, and the number of G and C nucleotides was counted. The result was divided by 50 to get the

654

%GC for this window. To calculate the GC content for the next bin, this process was repeated on the

655

region from -2bp to -51bp. Each bin had its GC content evaluated this way until the final bin of -451bp to

656

-500bp. To evaluate how closely a particular upstream region resembled a maternally deposited-like

657

distribution or a non maternally deposited-like distribution for the purposes of modeling, we calculated

658

the average GC content for each position of maternally deposited, and not maternally deposited genes.

659

Then for each gene, we measured the correlation between the GC content and that of both category

660

averages. We used the difference in these correlations as a metric to evaluate similarity in GC content

661

for each gene.

Table 1: A summary of the top ranked motifs. HOMER was used to find motifs enriched in the 2kb

862

windows upstream of maternally deposited genes (stage 2) and zygotically transcribed genes (stage 5).

863

Sequence logo shows the consensus motif where the probability of each base is proportional to its

864

representative character. P-value is given by HOMER. %target represents the percent of either

865

maternally deposited or zygotically expressed genes that contain at least one instance of the motif.

866

%background indicates the percent of all genes that contain this motif. Best match indicates protein

867

with a previously identified binding site that mostly closely matches the discovered motif (see Methods).

868

Fig 1: Motifs associated with maternal deposition are largely shared across species, zygotic motifs are

869

likely to be species-specific. For each analysis represented in A-D, motif enrichment was determined for

870

each group of genes at each stage (all maternally deposited genes at stage 2; or zygotic genes at stage 5)

871

separately in each species, then lists of enriched motifs at each stage were compared across species. For

872

stage 2 motifs, we required motifs to have a -log qvalue > 100, while for stage 5 motifs we required

873

motifs to have a -log qvalue > 10 (see Methods). (A, C) Percent of motif content in the upstream region

874

that is found to be shared between species at stage 2 and stage 5, respectively. The number of species

875

that share each motif is indicated by the color of the bar. Note that in stage 2, a large majority of motifs

876

are shared in all (11 species) or almost all (9 or 10 species), with the exception of D. pseudoobscura and

877

D. persimilis, sister species that share common motifs between themselves but are different from the

878

rest of the species. Zygotic motifs identified at stage 5 are much more likely to be species specific or

879

shared by only a couple of species. (B, D) Number of motifs shared between each pair of species at stage

880

2 and stage 5, respectively. Comparisons of one species to itself indicate the total number of motifs that

881

fit quality criteria discovered in that species. Comparing the number of shared motifs between pairs of

882

species, there is some signal of the phylogeny in stage 2 (B), with D. melanogaster subgroup species

sharing more motifs in common with one another than they do with the more distantly related species,

884

and D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis with the highest number of motifs in common but the most

885

differences from the remaining species. For stage 5 (D), apparent patterns include both the number of

886

species-specific motifs (diagonal) and less apparent phylogenetic structure. (E) Conservation of top

887

motifs in orthologous genes across species. Y-axis indicates all of the instances of the motif of interest

888

within the upstream region. Coloration represents how many species’ orthologues also contain that

889

motif. In general, top motifs at the zygotic stage (stage 5) are more likely to be conserved in orthologous

890

genes at this stage. This sets up a contrast with parts A-D, where maternal deposition is broadly

891

associated with a shared set of motifs across species, but part E shows that orthologous maternal genes

892

are less likely to share a specific motif.

associated with top motifs in stage 2, where a majority of motifs are associated with similar broad GO

897

categories (C) GO terms associated with top motifs in stage 5, some motifs are associated with the same

Fig 4: Chromatin stage and maternal deposition. For the analyses in A and B, genes were categorized as

909

either expressed or not expressed (see Methods) and adjacent expressed genes were considered to be

910

clustered, with a cluster size equal to the number of constituent genes. (A) Physical clustering of

911

maternally deposited genes along the chromosome, in a representative species (D. simulans). The

912

shaded blue region represents the observed frequency of co-expressed maternal gene clusters of

913

various sizes. The red region represents the 95% CI constructed with 10,000 bootstrap iterations.

914

Maternal genes are co-expressed in clusters along the chromosome more often than expected, given

915

the percent of the genome that is transcribed at this stage. (B) Physical clustering of co-expressed genes

916

on chromosomes in various tissue types. In order to compensate for differing proportions of the

917

genome that are expressed in each tissue type, physical clustering was measured by performing a Wald-

918

Wolfowitz runs test and taking the z-score (see Methods). Maternally expressed genes, represented by

919

stage 2 embryos, show the highest proportion of physical clustering of co-expressed genes, though

920

other tissues such as intestinal stem cells and larval CNS also have highly physically clustered co-

921

expressed genes. (C) Gene length by number of adjacent maternally expressed genes, "open" indicating

922

both adjacent genes are expressed, "border" indicating that one is expressed, and "closed" indicating

923

that neither are expressed. Genes that with more expressed neighbors are more likely to be maternally

924

deposited, regardless of length. Genes without expressed neighbors are less likely to be maternally

925

deposited, with the odds increasing as length increases. (D) Odds of maternal deposition versus distance

926

to the nearest upstream gene by upstream expression and strand. Distance is measured by from

927

transcription start site (TSS) to TSS. When the upstream gene is maternally deposited, odds of maternal

928

deposition are high, but decrease with distance regardless of strand. When the upstream gene is not

952

found in the 2kb upstream of a gene. Motifs for stage 5 are generally less high quality by this metric, and

the DREF motif, which follows the same pattern as M1BP, Zipic, Ohler-6, and E-box, and many motifs

958

without identified factors that bind them. These motifs are found upstream of maternally deposited

959

genes (red), with a higher frequency closer to the transcription start site. They are not found with any

960

frequency in non-maternally deposited genes (blue). (B,C) Positional distribution patterns of some rare,

961

undocumented motifs. In both, we see that the motif is more enriched in maternally deposited genes

962

than in non-maternally deposited genes, but that the enrichment difference is less than those motifs

963

represented by (A) above. In (B), this motif is most highly enriched upstream, less enriched around the

964

transcription start site (TSS), and more highly enriched again downstream of the TSS (though less so

965

than upstream). In (C), we see the highest enrichment downstream of the TSS, with a dip in enrichment

966

around the TSS, and less enrichment upstream of the TSS than downstream
