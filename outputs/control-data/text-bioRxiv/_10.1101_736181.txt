Gene copy number variation is known to be important in nearly every species where it has been
examined. Alterations in gene copy number may provide a fast way of acquiring diversity, allowing
rapid adaptation under strong selective pressures, and may also be a key component of standing
genetic variation within species. Cannabis sativa plants produce a distinguishing set of secondary
metabolites, the cannabinoids, many having medicinal utility. Two major cannabinoids --THCA and
CBDA -- are products of a three-step biochemical pathway. Using genomic data for 69 Cannabis
cultivars from diverse lineages within the species, we found that genes encoding the synthases in this
pathway vary in copy number, and that the cannabinoid paralogs may be differentially expressed. We
also found that copy number partially explains variation in cannabinoid content levels among
Cannabis plants.

Introduction

33

Gene copy number (CN) varies among individuals of the same species, which may have

34

considerable phenotypic impacts (Stranger et al., 2007). CN variation occurs most commonly via

35

gene duplication (Stranger et al., 2007; Zhang, 2013). Both genome size and complexity can be

36

increased by gene duplication (Zhang, 2013), and new genes can be adaptive (Long, 2013). CN

37

variation seems to be related to gene function, with those encoding biochemical pathway hubs

38

tending to have lower duplicability and evolution rates (Yamada and Bork, 2009). The genes

39

encoding for proteins that interact with the environment reportedly have a higher duplicability

40

(Prachumwat and Li, 2006; Yamada and Bork, 2009), particularly, stress-response genes in multiple

41

plant systems have a high mutation rate (Gaines et al., 2010; Hardigan et al., 2016). Therefore, CN

42

variation can provide a path to rapid evolution in strong selective regimes (Gaines et al., 2010), such

43

as changing environments (Żmieńko et al., 2014; Hardigan et al., 2016) or domestication (Swanson-

44

Wagner et al., 2010; Ollivier et al., 2016).

45

Three general modes of persistence of duplicated genes that may lead to CN variation have been

46

proposed. The first mode of persistence is concerted evolution, in which the gene copies maintain

47

similar sequence and function but the concentration of the gene product is augmented (Lynch, 2007;

48

Zhang, 2013). The second mode of persistence is neofunctionalization in which a gene copy acquires

49

a novel function (Lynch, 2007; Zhang, 2013). Finally, in subfunctionalization, the original function

50

of the gene becomes split among the copies (Lynch, 2007; Zhang, 2013).

51

CN variants are often selected during domestication (Swanson-Wagner et al., 2010; Ollivier

52

et al., 2016). Recently, humans have intensively bred for high levels of THCA (delta-9-

53

tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) and CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) (ElSohly et al., 2000; ElSohly and

54

Slade, 2005; Volkow et al., 2014; ElSohly et al., 2016), the two most abundant and well-studied

55

secondary metabolites (also referred to as specialized metabolites) produced by Cannabis sativa.

56

This angiosperm from the family Cannabaceae (Bell et al., 2010), produces numerous secondary

57

metabolites called cannabinoids, which are a primary distinguishing characteristic of this plant. These

58

two compounds -- THCA and CBDA -- when heated are converted to the neutral forms Δ-9

59

tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), respectively (Russo, 2011), which are the forms

60

that interact with the human body (Hart et al., 2001). These compounds have a plethora of both long-

61

known and recently-discovered medicinal (Russo, 2011; Swift et al., 2013; Volkow et al., 2014) and

62

psychoactive properties (ElSohly and Slade, 2005) and are most abundant in the trichomes of female

flowers (Sirikantaramas et al., 2005; Gagne et al., 2012). The enzymes responsible for their

64

production, THCA and CBDA synthases (hence THCAS and CBDAS), are alternative end catalysts

65

of a biochemical synthesis pathway (Figure 1; (Sirikantaramas et al., 2005; Gagne et al., 2012; Page

66

and Boubakir, 2014). As Cannabis, has had a long history of domestication (Li, 1973; 1974; Russo,

67

2007), with recent intense selection for THCAS and CBDAS (ElSohly et al., 2000; ElSohly and

68

Slade, 2005; Volkow et al., 2014; ElSohly et al., 2016), CN variation is likely to be found in these

69

synthases (McKernan et al., 2015; Weiblen et al., 2015; Grassa et al., 2018; Laverty et al., 2019).

70

Cannabinoids are thought to abate stresses such as UV light or herbivores (Langenheim, 1994;

71

McPartland et al., 2000; Sirikantaramas et al., 2005), and certain Cannabis chemovars contain higher

72

THCA concentrations (e.g. “marijuana-type” cultivars), while other Cannabis chemovars contain

73

higher CBDA concentrations (e.g. hemp and high-CBDA “marijuana” varieties) (de Meijer et al.,

74

1992; Rustichelli et al., 1998; Mechtler et al., 2004; Datwyler and Weiblen, 2006).

75

It was thought that allelic variation in the final enzymes in the pathway, THCA and CBDA

76

synthases, determined the predominant cannabinoid composition (de Meijer et al., 1992; de Meijer et

77

al., 2003; Hillig and Mahlberg, 2004; Pacifico et al., 2006; Onofri et al., 2015). However, it has

78

recently been established that there are multiple genes in close proximity that are responsible for the

79

production of cannabinoids (McKernan et al., 2015; Weiblen et al., 2015; Grassa et al., 2018;

80

McKernan et al., 2018; Laverty et al., 2019). Therefore, an alternative explanation for observed

81

phytochemical diversity is that CN variation may contribute to different cannabinoid phenotypes in

82

the C. sativa cultivars (McKernan et al., 2015)

83

Given the medical importance of this pathway and the possibility of CN variation in the genes

84

that encode their enzymes, we explored the inter- and intra-cultivar differences in these genes. Using

85

two de novo C. sativa genome assemblies and additional 67 WGS datasets from a diversity of

86

cultivars, we addressed three questions:

87

1) Do lineages differ in number of cannabinoid synthase paralogs? 2) Does cannabinoid content

88

correlate to the number of respective synthase paralogs by cultivar? 3) Do cannabinoid synthase

89

paralogs vary in expression level by tissue and cultivar?

duplications in Cannabis sativa

92

Genome assemblies and gene annotation within the assemblies

93

We used two different genome assemblies: The first was from a high-THCA marijuana-type

94

male, Pineapple Banana Bubba Kush (PBBK), sequenced using PacBio Single-Molecule Real-Time

95

(SMRT) Long-Read (LR) technology (Eid et al., 2009; Rhoads and Au, 2015), provided by Steep

96

Hill, Inc. (NCBI GenBank WGS accession number MXBD01000000). The second assembly was

97

constructed in 2011 from a high THCA dioecious female marijuana-type Purple Kush (PK) plant,

98

sequenced on the Illumina platform (van Bakel et al., 2011). This was until recently the best

99

Cannabis assembly publicly available (Vergara et al., 2016). Most results from this assembly will be

100

given in the Supporting Information. Both assemblies vary in their completeness, as each have some

101

missing BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990; Gish and States, 1993) hits as described below and in the

102

Supporting Information. Each assembly has some duplicated regions, with patterns of coverage

103

suggesting that allelic variation at heterozygous loci lead to two different sequences assembled at a

104

single genomic location. Because both are flawed due to these and other likely misassemblies

105

(Vergara et al., 2016), it was necessary to use both assemblies, which allowed us to find at least one

106

hit for every gene of the pathway in order to understand the whole cannabinoid pathway.

107

We found two high identity hits containing two exons each to the olivetolic acid synthase

108

gene in the PK assembly (see Supporting Information), and one hit with ten exons to the olivetolate

109

geranyltransferase in the PBBK assembly (see Supporting Information). The two olivetolic acid

110

112

synthase hits in the PK assembly were found using C. sativa OLS olivetol synthase (NCBI
accession AB164375.1), and each had a percent identity of more than 80% and an alignment
length of at least 1000bp. We found the single hit to the olivetolate geranyltransferase with the

113

mRNA sequence patented by Page and Boubakir (2014) (Page and Boubakir, 2014) -- exclusive to

114

the PBBK assembly -- had a percent identity score of more than 97% (see Supporting Information

115

Tables S1 and S2).

111

116

We found 11 and five BLAST hits for putative CBDA/THCA synthase genes in the PBBK

117

and PK assembly, respectively, for a total of 16 potential paralogs in the CBDAS/THCAS gene

118

family (see Supporting Information Table S1). Based on percent-identity scores, we found a hit in

119

each assembly that appears to code for THCAS. We identified two hits in the PBBK and one in the

120

PK assemblies that likely code for CBDAS. We used the CBDAS and THCAS cDNA sequences as

121

reference with NCBI accession numbers AB292682.1 and JQ437488.1, respectively. We also found

122

one hit in the PBBK assembly to the gene producing the third product variant of this pathway,

123

cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) using a cDNA sequence as a reference (Page and Stout, 2017).

124

We constructed a maximum likelihood (ML) tree using the default parameters in MEGA

125

version 7 (Kumar et al., 2016) with the 16 CBDA/THCA synthase gene family from both assemblies

126

to understand the relationships between them (Figure 2). In order to discern the relationship between

127

the CBDA/THCA synthase gene family, we identified putative homologs of CBDAS/THCAS in

128

closely related species using a tblastx search against NCBI’s non-redundant database. We chose

129

tblastx in lieu of blastx because it allows comparison of nucleotide sequences without the knowledge

130

of any protein translation (Wheeler and Bhagwat, 2007). We included 14 sequences from three

131

species from the order Rosales, two of them also from the family Cannabaceae -- Trema orientale

132

and Parasponia andersonii with four and three sequences respectively – and a more distantly related

133

species from the family Moraceae as an outgroup, Morus notabilis, with seven sequences. Therefore,

134

our ML tree included a total of 30 putative CBDAS/THCAS homolog sequences, 16 from Cannabis,

135

seven from two other species in the Cannabaceae, and seven from the outgroup Morus. All sequences

136

are deposited on Dryad digital repository (link).

137

Finally, for the 16 sequences we found in the PBBK and PK assemblies, we calculated

138

genetic distance and nucleotide composition using MEGA, and compared the non-synonymous to

139

synonymous sites ratio between sequences with SNAP (Korber, 2000).

140
141
142

Genomic sequences, alignment, and depth of coverage calculation
We used 67 Illumina platform whole genome shotgun sequence libraries available from

143

various Cannabis cultivars (see Supporting Information Table S2) from three major lineages within

144

C. sativa (FLOCK; (Duchesne and Turgeon, 2012) groups: Broad Leaf Marijuana-type (broad-leaf),

145

Narrow Leaf Marijuana-type (narrow-leaf), and hemp (Lynch et al., 2016). These genomes have raw

146

read lengths from 100 to 151bp. For detailed information on sequencing and the library prep for these

147

67 genomes refer to Lynch et al., 2016.

148

We aligned the 67 libraries to both assemblies using Burrows-Wheeler alignment (BWA)

149

version 0.7.10-r789 (Li and Durbin, 2009), then calculated the depth of coverage using samtools

150

version 1.3.1-36-g613501f (Li et al., 2009). The expected coverage at single copy sites was

calculated with the aligned data divided by the genome size (see Supporting Information Table S2),

152

estimated to be 843 Mb for male and 818 Mb for female Cannabis plants (van Bakel et al., 2011).

153

Subsequently, the estimated copy number for each cannabinoid sequence was calculated as the

154

average depth across that sequence divided by the expected coverage.

155

Intrinsic similarity among paralogous genes -- and thus probability that reads from different

156

loci align to the same paralog -- precluded establishing specific SNPs. However, we calculated the

157

number of possible gene paralogs encoding each enzyme in the three terminal steps of CBDA/THCA

158

synthesis (Figure 1) for each cultivar using coverage from both assemblies. The scaled depth was

159

therefore used as a measure of gene CN for each cultivar.

160

To determine the highest total number of genes per cultivar for CBDAS/THCAS, the depth of

161

coverage was calculated for each library when aligned to the PBBK assembly that had been modified

162

to include only one paralog (PBBK scaffold 001774).

163
164
165

Gene CN statistics
Differences in the estimated gene CN between the cultivars for each of the 16

166

CBDAS/THCAS gene family were determined using one-way ANOVAs on the CN of each gene as a

167

function of the lineages (narrow-leaf, broad-leaf, hemp), with a later post hoc analysis to establish

168

one-to-one group differences. Three ANOVAs were also performed for each of the lineages to

169

determine within-group variation. The cultivars were then compared with either an ANOVA for

170

cultivars with more than two samples (Carmagnola and Afghan Kush) or a paired t-test for those with

171

two individuals (Chocolope, Kompolti, Feral Nebraska, Durban Poison, and OG Kush; see

172

Supporting Information). Additionally, we performed a Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares

173

(PGLS) model with the package NLME (Pinheiro et al., 2014) on the R statistical platform (Team,

174

2013) to determine possible correlations between the depths of each paralog correcting for

175

relatedness between cultivars.

Cannabinoid concentration profiles (chemotypes) were generated by Steep Hill, Inc.

180

following their published protocol (Lynch et al., 2016). Briefly, data collection was performed using

181

high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Agilent (1260 Infinity, Santa Clara, CA) and

182

Shimadzu (Prominence HPLC, Columbia, MD) equipment with 400-6000 mg of sample. We report

183

the estimated total cannabinoid content calculated from the acidic and neutral form of each

184

cannabinoid as in Vergara et al. 2017 and used these values to obtain chemotypic averages for each

185

cultivar. We had the specific chemotypes for eight cultivars which also were sequenced. In these

186

cases, we used individual values instead of the averages (see Supporting Information Table S3).

187
188
189

CN vs chemotype correlation
To evaluate the relationship between the estimated gene CN for each of the genes and

190

chemotype, we performed PGLS correlations between the chemotype (phenotype) and the average

191

estimated gene CN per gene (see Supporting Information) while correcting for phylogenetic

192

relatedness. Only cultivars with matching data in the genomic analysis were analyzed, for a total of

193

35 individuals from 22 different cultivars. The broad-leaf group had 10 individuals from six cultivars,

194

the narrow-leaf had 15 individuals from 13 cultivars, the hemp group had six individuals from one

195

cultivar, and there were four individuals from three cultivars that were not assigned to any group

196

(Lynch et al., 2016). The chemotype data represents 822 individuals from 22 unique cultivars. One

197

caveat of this analysis is that we averaged the chemotypes for most of the shared cultivars except for

198

the eight cultivars for which we had the specific chemotype for that particular genotype (see

199

Supporting Information Table S3). However, an important strength of this average is that effects of

200

environmental variation and statistical noise are minimized, improving our ability to assess

201

genetically-based variation. We also performed PGLS correlations to the sum of all cannabinoids to

202

examine whether CN variation had an effect on overall cannabinoid content.

Expression Analysis
As a proxy measure of differential expression of the genes on the cannabinoid pathway, we

(PK) and the flower of the hemp cultivar Finola (van Bakel et al., 2011) to the whole PBBK

Results
CBDA/THCA synthase family

215

The quantification of relatedness between the combined 16 CBDA/THCA synthase paralogs

216

drawn from both genome assemblies revealed distinct clusters (Figure 2). Two paralogs, located on

217

contig 001774 and PK scaffold 19603, from the PBBK and PK assemblies respectively, cluster

218

together with 100%-bootstrap support and are related to genes known to be involved in THCA

219

production. Similarly, the paralogs we infer to be CBDA synthases -- two from the PBBK assembly

220

(000395 and 008242) and one from the PK assembly (74778) -- also cluster together. We found a

221

cluster of four genes, three from the PBBK assembly and one from the PK assembly, that we infer to

222

be CBCA synthases. All genes used from the two other Cannabacea species T. orientale and P.

223

andersonii cluster together. Similarly, the genes from the outgroup M. notabilis also form a cluster,

224

to the exclusion of any of the 16 Cannabis sequences.

225
226

Gene CN statistics

227

The one-way ANOVAs for each gene and post hoc analysis show that the CN of some of the

228

paralogs differ among the three major cultivar groups (see Supporting Information Table S4 –

229

between-group comparison). However, the post hoc analysis with the median from the broad-leaf,

230

narrow-leaf, and hemp groups show that hemps differ from the other two groups in paralog CN,

231

independent of which assembly was used as a reference.

232

Hemp appears to differ the most from the other two lineages in the copy number of the three

233

CBDAS-like and the two THCAS-like paralogs both between and within lineages (Figure 3), given

234

that for the three paralogs, the hemps have the lowest mean (see Supporting Information Tables S4)

235

and median (Figure 3) CN.

236

The sum of the means of the estimated gene CN per lineage (hemp: μ=15.51; broad-leaf:

237
238

μ=15.27; narrow-leaf: μ=13.63) is higher than the gene CN on the modified assembly (hemp:
μ=11.02; broad-leaf: μ=10.29; narrow-leaf: μ=8.96) with 001774 as the sole representative of its

239

clade (see Supporting Information Table S4). However, the differences between groups in the

240

modified assembly are only marginally significant (F=2.92, p=0.06; Supporting Information Table

241

S4). Despite the only marginally significant differences between groups in the modified assembly,

242

this trend suggests that some of the paralogs have diverged enough that their reads failed to align to

243

the one left in the modified assembly. Still, since some of those genes are truncated, their inclusion in

244

the total CN inflates the sum. Regardless, both estimates show significant variation in CN.

245
246

Phenotypic Analysis

247

CN vs chemotype correlation

248

After correcting for relatedness, most correlations between the cannabinoid levels and the

249

synthase gene CN lack significance both in the modified and original assemblies (see Supporting

250

Information Table S5). However, the original assemblies had important significant correlations

251

before correcting for relatedness (see Supporting Information Table S5). For CBD chemotypic

252

abundance (after correcting for relatedness) CNs of one (008242) of the two CBDAS-like paralogs

253

significantly but negatively correlate (Figure 4 a,b). Interestingly, the THCAS-like paralog 001774 is

254

also negatively but significantly correlated to CBD accumulation (Figure 4c). For THC chemotypic

255

abundance after correcting for relatedness, all CBDAS/THCAS paralog CNs show significant

256

positive correlations (Figure 5). All other correlations between chemotypic abundance and the

257

multiple gene CNs are given in Supporting Information Table S5. The PGLS correlations to the sum

258

of all cannabinoids behave in a very similar manner as the correlations to single cannabinoids (see

259

Supporting Information Table S5). The patterns shown in figures 4 and 5 are similar to the ones

260

observed when using the PK genome as a reference (see Supporting Information Figure S2 a,b for

261

correlations with percent CBD and Figure S2 c,d for correlations with percent THC).

262

We found that paralog 006705 had the highest BLAST percent-identity score (99.93%) to the

263

cDNA from the CBCA synthase. Additionally, the two other paralogs that cluster in the same group

264

(007396 and 004650; Figure 1) also show a high-percent identity (99.87% and 99.81% respectively)

265

267

Additionally, the PGLS model with paralogs 007396, 004650, and 006705 did not show any

268

significance. However, three different paralogs (50320, 002936, and 007887) with lower BLAST

269

scores showed a significant correlation with CBC accumulation before correcting for relatedness.

Expression Analysis
Our proxy expression analysis suggests differences in the gene products between cultivars and

273

tissues (Table 1). Even though the differences are not significant, the marijuana-type cultivar PK

274

seems to express the olivetolate geranyltransferase gene in greater quantities in midflower than

275

Finola the hemp cultivar. This result suggests that the enzymes found upstream of the pathway (such

276

as olivetolate geranyltransferase), may play an important role in the production of cannabinoids,

277

which would be regulated by enzymes found in multiple steps of the pathway. The CBDAS -like

278

paralogs are less abundant in Finola (see Supporting Information Table S3), despite them being

279

significantly more expressed when compared to PK’s mid-flower (Table 1). The THCAS -like

280

paralog is expressed in higher levels in the marijuana-type plant PK, and this comparison is

281

significantly different in the three tissues. The roots of PK seem devoid of transcripts of either the

282

CBDAS or THCAS paralog, likely due to the lack of trichomes in this tissue. These results suggest

283

considerable divergence in expression level, especially given the two order-of-magnitude difference

284

between the expression level of the CBDAS-like paralogs (000395 and 008242) and the THCAS-like

285

paralog (001774).

Discussion
In this study, we estimated the CN for the genes encoding enzymes catalyzing three of the main

289

reactions of the biochemical pathway that produces cannabinoids (Figure 1) in the plant C. sativa.

290

Although CN variation in some genes involved in cannabinoid production has been previously

291

reported (van Bakel et al., 2011; McKernan et al., 2015), in our study we estimate CN variation in

292

multiple steps of the biochemical pathway in 67 Cannabis genomes from multiple varieties within

293

the broad-leaf, narrow-leaf, and hemp groupings using two genome assemblies constructed via

294

complementary technologies.

duplications in Cannabis sativa

295

Our results suggest that synthases for the cannabinoid pathway are highly duplicated and that

296

plants probably use and express the paralogs of these genes differently in specific tissues. Gene CN

297

variation has also been found to be associated with SNP variation and both factors can influence gene

298

expression (Stranger et al., 2007). Our results suggest that this is the case for quantitative and

299

qualitative (amount and type) cannabinoid diversity, which seems to be a product of sequence in

300

agreement to previous research (Onofri et al., 2015), CN variation (McKernan et al., 2015), and

301

expression. The effect of CN variation in relation to these other factors that may affect cannabinoid

302

phenotype is an important topic for further study.

303
304

CBDA/THCA synthase family

305

The lack of dN/dS value differences and the short genetic distance (see Supporting

306

Information Table S6) suggest that the THCAS/CBDAS gene paralogs arose from a recent

307

duplication event and so have lacked time to accumulate changes. Clusters unique to each of the two

308

assemblies (Figure 2) suggest that either these clades were selectively lost from the opposing

309

assembly or that there exist lineage-specific paralog combinations. The latter would imply that the

310

acquisition and loss of paralogs is rapid enough to show polymorphism at the cultivar level.

311

Interestingly, all three putative CBDAS paralogs from these two high THCA-marijuana-type

312

assemblies bear premature stop codons (Figure 2). This finding supports previous research that

313

suggests that marijuana-type cultivars with high THCA production lack fully functional CBDAS

314

genes (van Bakel et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2015; Weiblen et al., 2015) .

315
316
317

Gene CN statistics
The difference in CN between hemp and the other two lineages for the three CBDAS-like and

318

the two THCAS-like paralogs (Figure 3) imply that a whole gene cluster was either lost in most of

319

the hemp cultivars or was duplicated in the marijuana-type (broad-leaf and narrow-leaf) individuals.

320

However, even though the hemp group has the lowest mean and median, for many of these genes it

321

has the widest range in gene CN (see Supporting Information Table S4), indicating the widest gene

322

CN variation between the three lineages. CN for these genes differ little between the broad-leaf and

323

narrow-leaf marijuana-types, suggesting similar between-group diversity and higher within-group

324

variation (Figure 3). Our estimates indicate that some of the analyzed individuals from the three

325

different groups could have up to ten copies of CBDAS/THCAS paralogs (see Supporting

326

Information Table S3).

327
328

Phenotypic Analysis

329

CN vs chemotype correlation

330

There is a positive correlation between accumulation of THC and CN for four of the five

331

paralogs related to CBDA/THCA production, but negative correlation between these paralogs and the

332

accumulation of CBD (Figures 4 and 5, Supporting Information Table S5). This suggests that

333

increasing THCAS gene CN decreases CBDA production possibly due to competition for the mutual

334

precursor, CBGA. Additionally, the THCAS allele from marijuana-type plants appears to be

335

dominant over the THCAS allele from hemp after expression analyses of crossed individuals bearing

336

these alleles, and the CBDAS gene seems to be a better competitor for CBGA even when functional

337

copies of THCAS genes are present (Weiblen et al., 2015). This difference in affinity towards

338

CBGA, and in performance from the various genes and alleles, implies significant contributions from

339

both sequence variation and differences in expression of synthase paralogs to differential

340

accumulation of cannabinoids.

341

The positive correlation between the CN of the paralogs related to CBDA production (000395

342

and 008242; Supporting Information Table S7) suggest that these paralogs are physically proximal

343

and were possibly copied in tandem (Weiblen et al., 2015; Grassa et al., 2018). This finding agrees

344

with recent research that found that cannabinoid genes are found in close proximity, in tandem

345

repeats, and surrounded by transposable elements (Grassa et al., 2018; McKernan et al., 2018), which

346

makes sense given that between 43-65% of the Cannabis genome consists repetitive sequences

347

(Pisupati et al., 2018). Both paralogs’ CN correlated with the PK paralog 74778 CN (see Supporting

348

Information Table S7), and the three paralogs cluster together (Figure 2), implying that the 74778

349

paralog in the PK assembly is related to CBDA production. However, the CN of the THCAS-like

350

paralog (001774) is not correlated to the CN from the THCAS-like paralog from the PK assembly

351

(Paralog 19603, Supporting Information Table S7) even though they are closely related (Figure 2).

352

Finally, our BLAST analysis to the two newly published assemblies also show that these cannabinoid

353

genes are in close proximity (Table S9), as reported in their respective publications (Grassa et al.,

354

2018; McKernan et al., 2018).

355

Another factor that can affect the correlation between synthase gene CN and THCA and

356

CBDA levels is the presence of truncated genes. It has been determined that high-THCA marijuana

357

cultivars possess a truncated version of the CBDA synthase (van Bakel et al., 2011; Onofri et al.,

358

2015; Weiblen et al., 2015). The presence of the truncated CBDAS paralogs can explain some of the

359

points in Figure 4 in the bottom right corner where, even though the estimated CN is high (high value

360

on the X axis), the amount of CBD produced is low (low value on the Y axis) due to the premature

361

termination and inability to produce the protein. Truncated genes have also been reported for THCA

362

synthases (van Bakel et al., 2011; Onofri et al., 2015; Weiblen et al., 2015), however we do not see

363

many samples in the bottom right corner with high CN and low THC production (Figure 5).

364

It is interesting that the individual hemp-type plants have the lowest mean and median CN for

365

the three CBDAS/THCAS paralogs (Figure 3 and Supporting Information Table S4). We expected

366

hemp types to have a higher mean CN of the two paralogs related to CBDA production, given their

367

higher production of CBDA compared to marijuana types (de Meijer et al., 1992; Rustichelli et al.,

368

1998; Mechtler et al., 2004; Datwyler and Weiblen, 2006). However, hemp individuals have a higher

369

mean for other paralogs from the CBDA/THCA synthase family (see Supporting Information Table

370

S4) such as paralog 005134 which has a negative correlation with the production of THCA but

371

positive for CBDA (see Supporting Information Table S5). Finally, recent research suggest that

372

CBDA-dominant lineages seem to produce minor cannabinoids absent in certain THCA lineages,

373

implying the loss of cannabinoid genes in these highly hybridized THCA-dominant cultivars (Mudge

374

et al., 2018). Perhaps these paralogs found in the hemp lineages may be related to these minor

375

cannabinoids.

376
377

Expression Analysis

378

Variation in expression profiles of the THCAS and CBDAS gene paralogs (Table 1) could be

379

another major contributor to measured phenotypic differences among Cannabis cultivars, as seen for

380

genes related to stress response in maize (Waters et al., 2017). This effect may be augmented by the

381

fact that chemotype assays are generally performed on mature flower masses. Variation in

382

transcription is seen for many of the CBDAS/THCAS paralogs by both tissue and cultivar,

383

suggesting differential use of pathway genes. On the other hand, transcripts from most cannabinoid

384

synthase paralog clades are transcribed in greater quantities by the marijuana cultivar PK in marked

385

contrast to the hemp cultivar Finola (Table 1), implying that marijuana cultivars express more

386

diversity in cannabinoid synthase genes. Finally, CN variation can correlate positively or negatively

387

with gene expression (Stranger et al., 2007), which could be the case for THCAS and CBDAS, as

388

may be the particular case for paralog 008242 that has a significant negative correlation with CBDA

389

production.

390
391

CN variation and the cannabinoid pathway

392

In other plant species such as potatoes and maize, species-specific secondary metabolites

393

accumulating in glandular trichomes confer resistance to pests and the corresponding synthase genes

394

are found in high copy numbers (Hardigan et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2017). This appears to be the

395

case in Cannabis. Cannabinoid synthesis appears to be genus-specific and accumulation of

396

cannabinoids in glandular trichomes could be stress-related (Langenheim, 1994; Sirikantaramas et

397

al., 2005). Our results suggest that the CBDA/THCA synthase family has recently undergone an

398

expansion. Previous studies have assumed that CBDAS was the ancestral gene and that THCAS

399

arose after duplication and divergence (Onofri et al., 2015), but since no other species is known to

400

share this biosynthetic pathway it’s not possible to conclusively identify the ancestral state. Our

401

phylogenetic analysis suggests that these cannabinoid genes are specific to Cannabis, but in order to

402

conclusively determine which is the ancestral state other closely related extinct and extant species (ie.

403

Humulus) remain to be analyzed for the presence of genes related to the CBDA/THCA synthase

404

family.

405

Regardless, duplication and neofunctionalization of ancestral synthase genes is a likely

406

contributor to chemotype variability. CN variants can serve as a mechanism for species-specific

407

expansion in gene families involved in plant stress pathways (Hardigan et al., 2016; Waters et al.,

408

2017). Additionally, CN variation has been reported in gene families involved in stress response and

409

local adaptation in plants (Hardigan et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2017), and other organisms (Van de

410

Peer et al., 2017), perhaps explaining why all genes in the cannabinoid pathway have been highly

411

duplicated.

duplications in Cannabis sativa

412

The high numbers of paralogs in the CBDAS/THCAS family supports the notion that

413

biosynthesis proteins that have fewer internal metabolic pathway connections have a higher potential

414

for gene duplicability (Prachumwat and Li, 2006; Yamada and Bork, 2009). However, despite both

415

olivetolic acid synthase and olivetolate geranyltransferase operating near the pathway hub, the

416

respective estimated CNs of their paralogs are similar to the CN of CBDA/THCA synthase paralogs

417

(Figure 1, Supporting Information Table S4). Sequence similarity and physical proximity of extant

418

paralogs in the genome (Weiblen et al., 2015; Grassa et al., 2018) promotes tandem duplication,

419

again facilitating rapid expansion of the CBDA/THCA synthase family. Human selection since the

420

ancient domestication of this plant has likely played a role, as it did with CN in resistance genes in

421

the plant Amaranthus palmeri (Gaines et al., 2010) and in the starch digestion gene Amy2B during

422

dog domestication (Ollivier et al., 2016). Finally, gene CN variation has been associated with SNP

423

variation and both factors can influence phenotype expression (Stranger et al., 2007).

424

Our study provides another example of the high association between the CBDA/THCA

425

synthase gene family, which has a very particular relationship, compete for the same precursor

426

molecule (Page and Boubakir, 2014; Page and Stout, 2017), are similar to each other in their

427

chemical structure (Brenneisen, 2007; Flores-Sanchez and Verpoorte, 2008) in their genetic sequence

428

(Onofri et al., 2015), and may exemplify “sloppy” enzymes (Auldridge et al., 2006; Franco, 2011;

429

Chakraborty et al., 2013). These “sloppy” enzymes could convert similar substrates (such as CBGA)

430

into a range of slightly different products, such as CBDA, THCA, or CBCA (Jones et al., 1991) .

431

Caveats

432

In addition to the factors previously examined as contributing to the high intrinsic genomic

433

complexity of cannabinoid synthesis pathway regulation, the possible misassembly of both genomes

434

may further confound attempts at precise correlations. The PK contigs have been misassembled

435

probably due to very short reads combined with high heterozygosity. This misassembly in the PK

436

genome may be the reason why, even in further assembly attempts, the cannabinoid synthases are

437

found in different locations in the genome (Laverty et al., 2019) despite other assemblies finding

438

these genes in close proximity (Grassa et al., 2018; McKernan et al., 2018). The scaffolds in the

439

PBBK assembly where the CBDAS/THCAS family genes are located lack sequence similarity

440

beyond the gene borders indicating that these scaffolds likely have not been affected. However, the

441

very similar paralogs that cluster together in the ML tree (Figure 2) could be different alleles of the

442

same gene that were assembled in different scaffolds. Additionally, the finding of some synthases

443

exclusively in one or the other assembly suggests data gaps in both genomes, although the

444

differences may represent true biological variation given the high amount of CN variation among the

445

different Cannabis varieties. This second hypothesis, suggesting that these differences are true

446

biological variation is supported by other research (McKernan et al., 2015), and by our BLAST

447

analysis (Table S9) to two newer assemblies.

448

Conclusions

449

In conclusion, returning to our three initial questions: 1) Do lineages differ in number of

450

cannabinoid synthase paralogs? We found that the measured copy-number of these genes did vary,

451

within and between lineages and possibly within named cultivars given by the differences in CN (see

452

Supporting Information Table S4). 2) Does cannabinoid content correlate with the number of

453

respective synthase paralogs by cultivar? We found a positive correlation between the accumulation

454

of specific cannabinoids and the CN of certain synthase paralogs. THCA levels are significantly and

455

positively correlated with the CN of several of these paralogs (Figures 4 and 5, and Supporting

456

Information Table S5). Furthermore, the broad-leaf and the narrow-leaf marijuana types each have a

457

higher mean and median for the CN’s of genes related to the production of both THCA and CBDA

458

relative to hemp cultivars. However, CBDA levels are negatively correlated with most of the

459

paralogs related to its production, and the hemp cultivars paradoxically exhibit higher CNs for the PK

460

contig 19603 THCAS-like paralog than for CBDAS paralogs (See Supporting Information Figure S1,

461

Table S5). We found both positive and negative correlations between the production of the other

462

cannabinoids and the CN of some of the paralogs, making it difficult to associate particular

463

cannabinoids with specific paralogs (Figures 3, 4, and Supporting Information Figure S2). 3) Do

464

cannabinoid synthase paralogs vary in expression level by tissue and cultivar? We observed

465

differential transcription levels of these genes by tissue in conjunction with cultivar (Table 1) which

466

likely adds to the high complexity of correlating paralog CNs with cannabinoid accumulation.

467

Finally, our findings motivate a pair of general breeding strategies. To boost production of

468

THCA, select parents with higher CNs of THCAS paralogs, whereas for cultivars with more CBDA,

469

select parents with fewer such paralogs. Given that cultivars express synthases from multiple points

470

in the pathway differently (Table 1), all of these genes should be considered for breeding purposes.

471

For exclusive production of either THCA or CBDA, cross cultivars bearing only truncated paralogs

472

of the opposing synthase genes.

the beginning and end positions of each gene within its scaffold (columns 4 and 5), the number of
exons (column 6), and the BLAST percent identity (column 7). For the start and end positions
(columns 4 and 5), if the gene is found in the reverse strand, it will have a higher value for the start
than for the end. For the last column (7) we calculated the identity using the mRNA with accession
number AB164375.1 for olivetolic acid synthase, the mRNA sequence patented by Page and
Boubakir (2014) for olivetolate geranyltransferase, and the mRNA sequence from THCA with the
NCBI accession number JQ437488.1 for both THCA and CBDA. We calculated the average percent
identity for the exons from olivetolic acid synthase and olivetolate geranyltransferase but not for
THCA and CBDA since they only contain one exon.

Supporting Information Table S2. WGS information. Information on each of the 67 WGS
sequenced on the Illumina platform used for the depth analysis. Each cultivar has a unique sample ID
(column 1), name (column 2), colloquial classification (column 3), lineage (flock group; column 4)
determined by (Lynch et al. 2017), ID with the NCBI submission (column 5), the size of the
alignment determined with the sam file (column 6), and the scaled depth (column 7) which was
determined by dividing the size of the alignment by the genome size.

Supporting Information Table S3. Average depth and chemotypes. Columns 1 – 24 show the
average depth by cultivar for each of the 19 paralogs analyzed (two for olivetolic acid synthase, one
for olivetolate geranyltransferase, and 16 from CBDAS/THCAS), and the paralogs from the modified
assemblies (paralog 16618 from the PK assembly, and paralog 001774 from the PBBK assembly for
CBDAS/THCAS). Columns 25-29 show five chemotypes for 22 cultivars. The final column indicates
whether the chemotype information is an average (Y), a specific value (N), or is absent (0).

Supporting Information Table S4. Statistics for differences in CN between and within groups,
and within repeated strains including modified assemblies. Statistical results from the ANOVAs
(between and within groups, and for the two cultivars that had more than two independent samples
each -- Carmagnola and Afghan Kush -- and t-tests (for the cultivars that had only two individuals –
Chocolope, Kompolti, Feral Nebraska, Durban Poison and OG Kush). The p-values that are not
shown are significant at the p<0.001 level. Calculations in the bottom of the table show the sum of
the means for the olivetolic acid synthase paralogs (15717 and 16618) and for the 11 CBDA/THCA
synthase paralogs from the PBBK assembly by lineage.

Supporting Information Table S5. Correlations between the estimated CN of the 19 different
paralogs (including the paralogs from the modified assemblies) and the chemotype for five
cannabinoids corrected for relatedness. Column 1 is the gene for each of the enzymes in the
pathway, the assembly used for each gene is found in column 2, and the scaffold in which each
paralog was found in column 3. None of the estimated CN of any paralog is significant after
Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Entries with an asterisk (*) are values that were
significant before correcting for relatedness. The final two columns are the statistics of the
correlations between the estimated CN and the sum of all cannabinoids.

Supporting Information Table S9. BLAST results to two newly published assemblies in nonpeer reviewed archives from Grassa et al., 2018 and McKernan et al., 2018 (Column 1) with 12 and
27 hits (Column 2) respectively, each with a percent identity of more than 80% and a length of more
than 1000bp. The 12 hits for Grassa et al.’s assembly are all found in chromosome nine (Column 3),
while the 27 hits in McKernan et. al.’s assembly are found in seven different unplaced scaffolds
(Column 3). We used the THCAS and CBDAS with NCBI accession numbers JQ437488.1 and
AB292682.1 respectively. For CBCAS we used the sequence from Page and Stout, 2017. All hits for
these three synthases have the same starting position (Column 4) but different ending positions,
percent identity, and alignment length, for THCAS (Columns 5-7), CBDAS (Columns 8-10), and
CBCAS (Columns 12-14), respectively. The paralogs are ordered according to their percent identity
to THCAS, though the order for their resemblance to CBDAS and CBCAS are reported as well, in
columns 11 and 15, respectively. The hit with the highest percent identity to each of the synthases in
both assemblies is bolded.

Supporting Information Figure S2. Correlations between the percent CBDA and the percent
THCA and the estimated CN for two CBDA/THCA synthase paralogs from the PK assembly.
The percent CBDA (Panels A and B) is negatively correlated -- while the percent THCA (Panels C
and D) is positively correlated -- with CNs of both CBDAS-like paralog 74778 and THCAS-like
paralog 19603 from the PK assembly. Correlation coefficients and p-values in the inset after
correction for relatedness. Only the CBDAS-like paralog 74778 is significantly correlated with both
CBDA (Panel A) and THCA (Panel C), while the THCAS-like paralog 19603 lacks significance
(Panels B and D). All correlation values between all genes and all cannabinoids are given in
Supporting Information Table S6.
