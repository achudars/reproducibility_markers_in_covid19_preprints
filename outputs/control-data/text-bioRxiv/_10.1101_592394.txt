Running Title: Tea Leaf Interologous PPI Network (TeaLIPIN)

Abstract

Worldwide, tea (Camellia sinensis) is the most consumed beverage primarily due to the taste, flavour
and aroma of its newly formed leaves; and has been used as an important ingredient in several
traditional medicinal systems because of its antioxidant properties. For this medicinally and
commercially important plant, design principles of gene-regulatory and protein-protein interaction
networks at sub-cellular level are largely un-characterized mainly because neither its reference
assembly nor annotated genome is available though plenty of its transcriptomes have been studied. In
this work, we report a tea leaf interologous PPI network (TeaLIPIN) consisting of 11,208 nodes and
1,97,820 interactions. A reference transcriptome assembly was first developed from all the 44
samples of 6 publicly available leaf transcriptomes (1,567,288,290 raw reads). By inferring the
high-confidence interactions among potential proteins coded by these transcripts using known
experimental information about PPIs in 14 plants, an interologous PPI network was constructed and
its modular architecture was explored. Comparing this PPI network with 10,000 realisations of
corresponding random networks (Erdős-Rényi models) and examining over three network centrality
metrics, we predict 2,931 bottleneck proteins (having p-values <0.01). 270 of these are deduced to
have transcription factor domains by developing the HMM models of known plant TFs. Final
transcripts were also mapped to the draft tea genome in order to search the probable loci of their
origin. We believe that the proposed novel methodology can easily be adopted to develop and explore
the PPI interactomes in other plant species by making use of the available transcriptomic data.

Tea Leaf Interologous PPI Network (TeaLIPIN)

Introduction

Camellia sinensis is an important commercial crop that is consumed worldwide as the most popular
non-alcoholic beverage and has also been used as a traditional medicine in various parts of the world
since c. 3000 BC (Xia et al. 2017). Its leaves are known to have several anti-oxidants, anti-cancerous
and anti-inflammatory properties as it contains wide range of bioactive ingredients having important
roles in treatment of several diseases (Namita et al. 2012). Due to several microbial attacks and
environmental stresses, various processes related to the growth and developments of tea leaves are
continuously affected that severely hamper the quality and production of this crop (Zhou et al. 2017).
To understand the molecular insights of these processes in detail and to explore the novel strategies
for the potential control of these processes, it is crucial to identify key proteins and their interactions
with others that directly or indirectly regulate the expression of various genes that in-turn regulate
primary and secondary metabolic pathways etc. (Xia et al. 2017). Although, for understanding the
architecture of genetic circuitry of tea, a deluge of information has been generated by means of
genome or transcriptome sequencing and several thousands of genes, their potential proteins with
functions have been predicted; to the best of our knowledge till date no attempt has been made
towards studying regulatory mechanisms of action at molecular level by developing and examining
the global interactomes.

Regulation of various biological processes is governed by a web of protein-protein interactions at
molecular level (Jeong et al. 2001). PPI networks form the basis of various regulatory and signalling
processes such as signal transduction, stress response, homeostasis, plant defense, and organ
formation at cellular level etc. (Zhang et al, 2007; Geisler-Lee et al, 2007). Interologous PPI networks
have been widely studied for the model crops such as Arabidopsis thaliana (Geisler-Lee et al, 2007),
Oryza sativa (Zhu et al. 2011), Zea mayz (Zhu et al. 2016) and Manihot esculenta (Thanasomboon et
al. 2017) to address various biological questions. Interolog based method to construct a PPI network
has been reported to be useful in the cases where reference assembly or annotated genome was
unavailable (Yu et al, 2004). In cases, where reference assembly or annotated genome is not available
for a species, it is difficult to identify or predict PPI interactions and to study the interactions at the
systems level. To address that research gap, we propose a methodology to develop an interolog based
PPI network by using the publicly available transcriptomes in order to highlight the regulatory
behaviours of various proteins among each other.

In this work, we have selected the leaf transcriptomic data of Camellia sinensis available in the public

domain from 6 different studies related to biotic and abiotic stresses to identify the potential
candidates involved in various processes related to several regulatory pathways. A reference
transcriptome assembly was first developed from all the experiments followed by identification of
interactions among translated proteins across various plant species to construct an interologous PPI
network. We also have mapped the predicted nodes on the draft tea genome. This purposed PPI
network provides a bunch of several possible interactions that will be helpful in addressing various
research queries towards finding novel proteins that regulate important mechanisms related to growth
and development of tea. The overall flow-chart of our work is shown in Fig. 1.

Materials and Methods

Data mining and assembly

Paired-end raw reads from 6 leaf transcriptomes of Camellia sinensis were downloaded from NCBI
sequence read archive database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with average read lengths of 33, 72,

100, 100, 101 and 151 from six experiments having SRA accessions SRP047312 (Paul et al. 2014),
SRP067826 (Jayaswall et al. 2016), SRP060335 (Shi et al. 2013), ERP012919 (Zhang et al. 2017),
SRP063593 (Li et al. 2018) and SRP055910 (Li et al. 2016), respectively. All the raw reads were
filtered separately (experiment-wise) based on the average read length using NGS QC toolkit by
setting 70% cut-off read length and cut-off quality score of 20 for obtaining the high quality reads
(Patel and Jain 2012). Next, all the six datasets were assembled separately using Trinity (version
r20140717) with default parameters (Grabherr et al. 2011). Finally, to remove redundancy, all the
six assembled datasets were subjected to clustering with CD-Hit with a cut-off of 90% similarity (Li
and Godzik 2006). Final dataset consisting of 2,61,695 transcripts was used in the further analysis.

Functional annotation of assembled transcripts

Functional annotations to the final assembled transcripts were assigned by subjecting them to the
BLASTX against non-redundant (NR) database at NCBI (Altschul et al. 1990), UniProt (Apweiler
et al. 2004) and TAIR database (Berardini et al. 2015). Gene Ontology annotation for the
functionally identified genes was performed by AgriGo (Du et al. 2010) and WEGO (Ye et al. 2006)
tools. Pathways mapping was performed through KEGG database (Kanehisa et al. 2016). We
attempted to computationally characterize the tea leaf transcripts that may have the transcription
factor like activities, as a case study in this work. From each of the 58 categories of transcription
factors (TFs) in plant transcription factor database (Jin et al. 2016), sequences of all the TFs were
retrieved and their alignment was obtained using standalone version of Clustal Omega (Siever et al.
2011). Hidden Markov models of TFs from each category were built using HMMER
(http://hmmer.janelia.org/). Largest open reading frames (ORFs) were searched in the final
assembled transcripts and these ORFs were then subjected to the HMMs for predicting if a
transcript may belong to any of the 58 categories of the plant transcription factors.

Interolog based tea leaf protein-protein interaction network (TeaLIPIN) construction

Experimentally validated pre-determined protein-protein interactions in all the 14 plant species
(Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodiumdistachyon, Brassica rapa, Glycine max, Hordeum vulgare,
Musa acuminata, Oryza sativa, Populustrichocarpa, Sorghum bicolor, Setariaitalica, Solanum
lycopersicum, Selaginellamoellendorffii, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays)

were obtained from

STRING database, as available in May, 2018 (Szklarczyk et al. 2014) and the proteomes of all these
14 plants were downloaded from UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/). To find the high

confidence orthologs of the assembled tea leaf transcripts, their BLASTX search was carried out
against these plant proteomes using highly stringent parameters (sequence identity > 60%,
sequence coverage > 80% and e-value ≤ 10-10) (Altschul et al. 1990). An interologous PPI network
of tea leaf was created by mapping the obtained orthologs of tea transcripts to the experimental PPIs
obtained via STRING. An interaction between a pair of tea transcripts was considered to be true, if
there existed at least one interaction between their corresponding orthologs (Thanasomboon et al.
2017). Final constructed network (TeaLIPIN) was visualized and analyzed by Cytoscape v3.3.0
(Smoot et al. 2010). Final assembled transcripts appearing as a node in the TeaLIPIN that were
potentially encoding the transcription factors were further mapped on the available draft genome of
tea (Xia et al. 2017).

Network modularity and metrics analysis

In order to search the presence of functional modules in the final network (TeaLIPIN), it was
subjected to clustering using MCODE (Bader and Houge 2003). All the proteins present in the top
10 clusters (sorted on the basis of node degree) were analysed for pathway enrichment using
DAVID Bioinformatics Resourses v6.8 (Huang et al. 2008). The largest component of TeaLIPIN
was considered for the further analysis since several proteins were lying as outgroups, which may
be due to an artefact of non-availability of full proteomic information in tea. Three network
centralities (degree, betweenness and eigenvector) were computed for the TeaLIPIN and its random
realizations. For a graph G (V, E) with V nodes and E links,
matrix of
(

) of a node

if there exists an edge between

0 otherwise. Degree centrality

is given by the number of directly connected nodes and is defined as
. Greater the degree of a node, higher the importance it has since it can regulate

more number of proteins and hence represent key a node. PPI networks follow power-law in their
degree distribution and the higher degree nodes (hubs) tend to be more central in the network (Jeong
et al. 2001).
Betweenness centrality (

) of a node represents its importance to act as a connecting link between

other nodes (Joy et al. 2005). For any two nodes

ER network construction and significance evaluation to identify key proteins

type ER model based random networks that preserve size and average degree of a given
network were constructed corresponding to the largest component of TeaLIPIN (Erdős and Rényi
1960). We constructed 10,000 such random realizations and computed above mentioned three
centrality measures for the TeaLIPIN and each random network that were further used to calculate
the significance score of each node. Statistically significant bottlenecks (high scoring nodes) were
identified using z-score which is defined as

involvements in various pathways and their potential to code for a transcription factor.

Results and Discussions

Data mining and analysis

Total 1,567,288,290 (~1.5 Billion) paired-end reads were downloaded from publicly available
NCBI-SRA database of six tea leaf transcriptomes. These transcriptomic experiments have been
reported for the studies of three abiotic stresses, namely, cold stress (SRP047312), salinity and
drought stress (ERP012919) and environmental stresses on leaves (SRP055910); and three biotic
stresses, namely, fungal infection (SRP067826), mechanical wounding (SRP063593) and methyl
jasmonate treatment (SRP060335).In each experimental data, quality checking and filtering of the
raw reads was performed, and a total of 1,439,994,212 high quality cleaned reads were obtained.
Since the read lengths were not uniform, these cleaned reads were first assembled separately for each
experimental data. A total of 26,711; 64,034; 108,656; 64,458; 72,581 and 164,159 assembled
sequences were obtained for SRP047312, SRP067826, SRP060335, ERP012919, SRP063593 and
SRP055910 datasets respectively. Now to remove the redundancy in the entire data, all the assembled
reads were subjected to stringent clustering that resulted in 2,61,695 final transcripts (S1
Supplementary File) with N50 value of 1,219 and average transcript length of 915. Details about the
entire data are given in Table 1.

Functional annotation of assembled transcripts

In order to elucidate the function of final transcripts, three-fold comparative homology was
performed against NRDB (at NCBI), TAIR and UniProt. We obtained 1,17,242 hits with
non-redundant database at NCBI, 93,077 hits from TAIR and 84,123 hits from UniProt database,
that resulted in a total of 1,19,178 mappings to the annotated proteins [S2 Supplementary File]. By
gene ontology annotation, 51,947 GO terms were successfully predicted for 69,281 of mapped
transcripts. Among these GO terms, about ~31% were biological processes classified into 37
categories, ~30% were cellular components divided into 21 functional categories and ~39% were
molecular functions further classified into 36 categories. In biological processes, „cellular process
and metabolic process‟ were found to be most enriched followed by „response to stimulus‟ and
„biological regulation‟. In cellular components, „cell‟ and „cell part‟ were highly enriched followed
by „organelle and membrane‟ and „organelle part protein-containing complex‟. „catalytic activities
and binding‟ was the most enriched category in molecular functions followed by „transcriptional
regulator activity‟, „transporter activity‟ and „structural molecular activity‟ (Fig. 2). Assignment of

metabolism (647 transcripts). In genetic information processing, 4 categories were found with
1,630 transcripts in translation category, 922 transcripts in folding, sorting and degradation category,
followed by 417 transcripts in transcription category and 250 transcripts in and replication and

number of transcripts in signal transduction category (1,339 transcripts) followed by membrane
transport and signaling molecules and interaction category with 54 and 30 transcripts respectively.
In cellular processes, 4 categories were found that are transport and catabolism, cell growth and
death, cellular community and cell motility involving 858, 630, 352 and 116 transcripts respectively.
Finally, in the organismal systems, 10 categories were predicted with highest number of transcripts
in environmental adaption (610 transcripts) followed by endocrine systems (549 transcripts) and
immune system (459 transcripts).

the tea TFs. For that, all the 2,61,695 transcripts were screened to search for longest ORFs and
2,55,650 ORFs were found. The transcripts having ORFs were then subjected to the in-house
developed 58 HMMs corresponding to these many transcription factor families of plants. 26,307
transcripts were resulted by the HMMs as the transcription factors and were spanning across all the
58 transcription factor families. The largest category of transcription factor is WRKY with 2,467
transcripts followed by 2,319 transcripts in S1Fa-like transcription family. Other, transcription
factors like bHLH, STAT, MYB_related, E2F/DP, NAC have 1,790; 1,716; 1,355; 1,267; 1063
transcripts respectively as shown in Fig. 4.

Construction of tea leaf interologous protein-protein interaction network (TeaLIPIN)
Since very little information about the protein-protein interactions in the tea proteome is known,
experimentally validated interactions in pre-determined networks of 14 plant species from STRING
database were selected as templates. Proteomic information about all these selected templates was
first extracted from UniProt database and all the final assembled 2,61,695 transcripts were mapped to
these templates via BLASTX with e-value 10-10. The 14 plants that were used in this step with the

All the obtained orthologs from first species were selected and the novel unique interactions from
subsequent species were added to this pool to generate the TeaLIPIN. Details about the relative
contributions of various plant species in the construction of this network are given in Table 2. A
total of 11,208 nodes with 1,97,820 interactions are successfully predicted [S3 Supplementary File]
using this interolog based approach [Fig. 5 (a)]. We would like to remark here that a particular
ordering of various species while generating the network will not have any impact on the final
outcome, since these are the unique interactions in a species that are contributing in the build-up of
the TeaLIPIN. Also, as this network has been constructed using a very large repository of
experimentally validated interactions, it is highly unlikely that by adding or subtracting one or two
species will have any substantial impact on the overall global structure of the TeaLIPIN.

Tea Leaf Interologous PPI Network (TeaLIPIN)

Exploring the modular architecture of TeaLIPIN

Various complex biological processes are carried-out within the cell by multiple interactions among
selected group of proteins, identification of functional modules in PPI network is an important aspect
for knowledge discovery in biological systems. MCODE assisted clustering analysis of entire
TeaLIPIN resulted in 207 modules consisting of total 4031 transcripts [S4 Supplementary File].
Based on total number of nodes in a cluster, we selected top 10 modules for pathways enrichment and
found that 644 transcripts are encoding to 284 unique KO ids. Pathway enrichment analysis of these
top-10 modules resulted in the identification of four enriched pathways related to genetic information
processing that are ribosome, proteasome, spliceosome and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and one
enriched pathway related to plant pathogen interaction under organismal system category.

Ribosome pathway is found to be highly enriched (86 proteins from module_1, 104 proteins from
module_2, 108 proteins from module_4 and 64 proteins from module_10) followed by Spliceosome
pathway (27 proteins in module_5, 29 proteins in module_8 and 22 proteins in module_13),
Proteasome pathway (43 proteins in module_3) and Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (16 proteins in
module_20). Plant pathogen interaction pathway is found to be enriched in module_30 with 6
proteins in environmental adaption under organismal systems category. Plant pathogen interaction
pathway is important for recognition of pathogen attacks by pattern recognition receptors or
effectors triggered immunity (Bellincampi et al. 2014). While exploring the details of proteins in
this category, it is observed that TeaL_175716 and TeaL_159132 act as heat shock proteins that help
in enhancing the synthesis of required proteins in stress condition (Kim and Yenari 2017),
TeaL_176108 and TeaL_161500 are known to have role in MAP kinase signalling to encounter the
abiotic stress (Zhu 2016) and the other two proteins TeaL_153931 and TeaL_189530 are leucine
rich repeats that along with different receptor kinases possibly play regulatory roles in signal
transduction and propagation during biotic stresses (Jayaswall et al. 2016).

Identification of key proteins in TeaLIPIN and their TF characterization

During network analysis it was found that some nodes are in solitary clusters, thus largest
component was selected for further analysis that consisted of 10,922 nodes and 1,97,309
interactions. To identify the key proteins in the TeaLIPIN, this largest component was subjected for
10,000 Erdős-Rényi (Gn,m type) model based realizations of random networks. Thereafter, by

Tea Leaf Interologous PPI Network (TeaLIPIN)

calculating the z-scores of all the protein nodes on the basis of three crucial centrality measures
(degree, betweenness and eigenvector), a total of 2,931 proteins were found to have p-value less
than 0.01 and are termed as key proteins in the rest of this manuscript (Fig. 5). Further analysis of
key proteins revealed that 1,523 proteins have important role in the regulation of 276 pathways and
270 proteins are in 34 transcription factor families, among these 150 are uniquely associated with
30 TF families [Supplementary Table S2]. Out of 270 transcription factors, highest numbers are
present in S1Fa-like TF (112 proteins) family followed by WRKY (89 proteins) and NAC (79
proteins) TF families (Fig. 5 (b)). In the following, we discuss about our findings in some of the TF
families.

S1Fa-like transcription factors are activated by proteolytic processing in plants to regulate gene
expression in response to various stimuli (Yao et al. 2017). It is found that among 112 key proteins
that are related to S1Fa-like TF family, 8 proteins are unique to S1Fa-like TF family. Of these 8
proteins, TeaL_113200 has the highest degree (105) followed by TeaL_219351 (62 degree).
TeaL_113200 is a MDIS1-interacting receptor like kinase and has important role in breaking
reproductive isolation barrier (Wang et al. 2016). TeaL_219351 is CDK7 (cyclin-dependent kinase 7)
having KO id K02202 under genetic information processing and is known to trigger the translational
regulations by intricate feedback regulations of particular stress conditions (Merchante et al. 2015).
Out of 89 proteins in WRKY TF family, 15 proteins (TeaL_208517; 109 interactions, TeaL_29412;
65 interactions, TeaL_10183; 61 interactions, TeaL_251204; 60 interactions etc.) are specific to this
category. WRKY TFs have crucial role in molecular regulation during stress caused by pathogen
attack (Mao et al. 2011), and are known to play important regulatory roles in various stress
tolerance processes in plants by regulating the expression of other defense related genes that is also
reported in tea (Wu et al. 2016). In NAC TF family, out of 79 proteins 6 are unique to this category
that include TeaL_160350 with highest degree 55 followed TeaL_8246 with degree 34. NAC TFs
are known to manage ROS load during both biotic and abiotic stress in rice (Fang et al. 2015) and
may also be helpful in tea stress conditions.

Among other TF categories, we have found 21 bHLH (TeaL_191930; 422 interactions,
TeaL_255207; 324 interactions, TeaL_188079; 275 interactions etc.) and 9 MYB/MYB_related
(TeaL_3029; 168 interactions, TeaL_8162; 66 interactions etc.) transcription factors. Different
complexes of MYB/bHLH transcription factors regulate several distinct processes in a cell which
include hormonal signaling, circadian clock, cell wall synthesis, cell death, biotic and abiotic stress
responses, and biosynthesis of metabolites for specific processes. In several other cases, physical

interactions of bHLHs take place with MYBs in order to regulate the function based on cell demand at
particular condition (Stracke et al. 2001; Seo and Mas 2014; Pireyre and Burow 2015). Also, Whirly
transcription factors are known to have crucial roles in regulating the expression of genes during
stress conditions (biotic and abiotic) by reducing ROS accumulation (Zhao et al. 2018). In this work,
we have found 17 Whirly transcription factors (TeaL_121652; 297 interactions, TeaL_209827; 163
interactions, TeaL_1629; 145 interactions, TeaL_15392; 123 interactions) that might have regulatory
role for stress tolerance in tea also.

In-silico validation of transcripts involved in TeaLIPIN

In order to validate the existence of network proteins in the genome, all the 11,206 transcripts were
aligned with draft tea genome. A total of 8,859 transcripts successfully mapped to 3,578 unique
fragments of draft genome. Additionally, among all identified key proteins (270 in number)
encoding transcription factors, 136 proteins were successfully mapped to available protein data of
Camellia sinensis at NCBI and 234 transcripts were mapped to genome with 192 unique fragments
[S5 Supplementary File]. Hence, these proteins might be thought of as the novel key candidates and
may be studied in detail for understanding the regulatory processes related to biotic and abiotic
stresses.

Summary

To the best of our knowledge this is the first work in tea where an interolog based PPI network is
reported. The methodology developed to construct this network utilizes the publicly available
transcriptomes without relying on reference assembly or the annotated genome. Investigations based
on protein-protein network interactions by means of wet-lab experiments require immense efforts,
financial aid and time consumption; therefore identification of high-confidence PPI interactions
through computational methods is gaining much recognition in recent times. Although complex
transcriptional mechanism can be illustrated using comparative analysis by in-silico tools but the
identification of key proteins in a particular pathway and determining their interactors with certain
confidence require in-depth computational analysis that can enhance the success propensity as well as
reduce the financial burden (of hit-and-trial) in-vivo or in-vitro experiments.

Tea is one of the most popular and most ancient therapeutic beverages and is obtained from newly
born young leaves that continuously experience attack of various biotic and abiotic stresses.To

Tea Leaf Interologous PPI Network (TeaLIPIN)

capture the holistic response mechanisms by the tea leaf, our input dataset was prepared by
developing a global assembly of tea leaf transcripts from six publically available RNA-Seq datasets
comprising three biotic stress conditions and three abiotic stress conditions. This assembly consisting
of 2,61,695 final assembled transcripts was firstly annotated using various bioinformatics protocols
for functional characterization, specifically pathway assignment and transcription factor
identification. To gain insights of response mechanisms that are generally activated via a web of
interactions among proteins instead of a single one, we then used the annotated transcripts to develop
a draft protein-protein interactions network in a tea leaf (TeaLIPIN) consisting of 11,208 nodes and
1,97,820 edges. To enhance the tenacity of interactions among proteins, we relied only on the
experimentally known protein interactions in 14 plant species. This is probably the largest number of
species used for inferring an interologous PPI network of any plant so far.

By comparing the three important network metrics of TeaLIPIN with its 10,000 random realizations
(Gn,m type), we have identified 2,931 key candidates related to growth, development and stress
tolerance. A total of 1,523 proteins are successfully assigned to various important regulatory
pathways and 270 proteins are predicted to be potential transcription factors using in-house
developed hidden Markov models, out of these 150 are found to be uniquely present in any one of the
30 transcription factor families and 60 are present as TFs of tea in the NCBI‟s Protein database.
Additionally, MCODE clustering of the final network resulted in 207 clustering modules. Based on
cluster size, top 10 modules were studied for their functional enrichment. This division of TeaLIPIN
into biological meaningful modules may aid to the automated detection of protein interactors and
prediction of biological processes to help us uncover the complex circuitry design in the cell of tea
leaf.

Moreover, in order to further enhance the confidence in the annotated transcripts from developed
assembly these were mapped with the draft genome of tea (Xia et al. 2017) that has been recently
reported and could successfully map 243,885 out of 261,695 final assembled transcripts.
Interestingly, all the key proteins reported here are successfully mapped to the tea draft genome.
In the future, TeaLIPIN proposed in this work may be used to identify the potential therapeutic targets
and the key candidates may be utilized for crop improvement by plant breeding methods. We believe
that the computational framework developed in this study can be easily adopted to build useful
knowledgebase of networks at high scale of complexity for other plant species too.
