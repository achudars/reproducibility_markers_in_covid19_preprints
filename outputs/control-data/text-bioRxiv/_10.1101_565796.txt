ABSTRACT:
Statistical mechanics is employed to tackle the problem of polymer brush bilayers under stationary shear motion. The article addresses, solely, the linear
response regime in which the polymer brush bilayers behave very much similar to the Newtonian fluids. My approach to this long-standing problem split
drastically from the work already published Kreer, T, Soft Matter, 12, 3479
(2016). It has been thought for many decades that the interpenetration between the brushes is source of the friction between the brush covered surfaces
sliding over each other. Whiles, the present article strongly rejects the idea
of interpenetration length in that issue. Instead, here, I show that structure
of the whole system is significant in friction between brush covered surfaces
and the interpenetration is absolutely insignificant. The results of this research
would blow one’s mind about how the polymer brush bilayers respond at small
shear rates.

INTRODUCTION
Polymers are linear macromolecular structures that are composed of repeating building
blocks of atomic or molecular size i.e. monomers. Typically, polymers bear 104 to 105
monomers per chain (degree of polymerization) in biological systems 1 . In principle, the
word polymer is devoted to long linear macromolecules with many monomers. The connectivity between monomers in chain is established through the Covalent bond in which
monomers share their valence electron together. In 1827, R. Brown discovered that particles at molecular and atomic scale undergo thermal fluctuations. Since, monomers undergo
thermal agitation as well, therefore the whole polymer chain undergoes all possible conformations in the course of time. However, at thermal equilibrium the chain stays at a certain
average length. This length is determined by entropic elasticity (which shrinks the chain)
from one hand and the steric repulsion among monomers (which stretches the chain) on the
other hand.
One of the most interesting polymeric structures that exists in many biological systems
is the polymer brushes 2 . Polymer brushes are composed of linear chains that are chemically
grafted into a surface. The steric repulsion among monomers of nearby chains stretches the
chains strongly in the perpendicular direction. The brush like structures could be found as
Glycol on the outside of cell membranes as well as aggregan in synovial fluids of mammalian
joints. Since the thickness of the brush layer is easily controllable by varying molecular
parameters, therefore one could tune the surface properties by brushes. Polymer brush
bilayers (PBB) are observed in synivial joints of mammals and they are responsible for
reduction of friction between the bones sliding over each other. Moreover, it has been
also known that the PBBs are responsible for suppression of the mechanical instabilities in
synovial joints. To investigate such a situation, one would normally take two parallel surfaces
with a certain distance and each surface covered by a brush that are similar in molecular
parameters. The brushes got to be at intermediately compressed state to make balance
between compression and interpenetration. The most simplified motion that resembles the
synovial joints motion in walking, could be the shear motion where surfaces move in opposite
directions with the same velocity. Depending on the shear rates, the PBBs response to the

shear forces are divided into two regimes. The regime of small shear rates or the linear
response regime and the regime of large shear rates. In this article, I focus on the linear
response regime where the PBBs behave like the Newtonian fluids. Note that, here I do
not address the regime of large shear rates where shear thinning effects appear. It has
been taught, for few decades, that the interpenetration between the brushes is significant in
producing friction between sliding surfaces 4 . Here, I provide theoretical considerations that
strongly rejects the significance of interpenetration length in the friction. Instead, my theory
suggests that the structure of whole system is significant in friction.
In the next section, I describe my theory in detail and make comparisons with the existing
theoretical approaches to the same problem.

THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION
Newtonian fluids
Let us consider a Newtonian fluid which is restricted between two flat plates of surface area
A and distance D. Under the shear motion the flat plates move in opposite directions with
velocity v. In such situations, the governing equations would be the Stokes equations as
follows,

η ∇2 u(x, t) = ∇p

(1)

where η is the fluid viscosity, u(x, t) the fluid velocity and p the fluid pressure. Assume
that the flat plates are in xy plane such that the bottom plate is located at z = 0 and the
top plate at z = D. If the shear direction is supposed to be in the x direction, then the
following differential equation holds,
∂ 2 ux
∂p

In the absence of external flow, one would set ∂x
= 0. By considering the no-slip boundary

conditions i.e. ux (z = 0) = −v and ux (z = D) = v, the solution of Eq. (2) would be,

ux (z) = γ̇ z − v

Where γ̇ = 2v/D is the shear rate. Therefore, the velocity profile is linear in z and
vanishes at the center of channel. The stress tensor is given as follows,

Π = η ∇u − pI

(4)

Which implies the following results for normal and shear stresses,

Πn = p

Πs = η γ̇

(5)

It turns out that the viscosity and the equation of state of the fluid give a full description of
the response under stationary shear motion. That is an important property of the Newtonian
fluids. Having reviewed the Newtonian fluids under stationary shear, I will consider PBBs
under stationary shear in the following.

Now let us consider brushes that are grafted onto the flat plates and are suspended in a
solvent. The equation of state of a PBB has been already calculated 6 and it is given as

However, at b  3, the plot shows the power law p ∼ b0.58 . The shear forces do not
change the equation of state as long as the linear response regime holds. The linear response
regime is valid if the Weissenberg number W is smaller than unity. The Weissenberg number
is a dimensionless number that is defined as follows,

W = γ̇ τc
where τc =

(12)

is the critical time scale below which the chains can relax and ξ the

monomer friction constant. In principle, τc is the largest mode of the Rouse time scale which
is taken into account as the largest relaxation time of polymer chains at melt concentration
without hydrodynamic interactions between monomers 5 . Therefore, all of my calculations
are valid for (W  1) that the shear forces are not able to overcome the entropic forces that
make monomers diffuse.
So far, I have given a full description of the PBB equation of state as well as the validity
range of the linear response regime. According to Eq. (5), we know the normal stress
as Πn = p. To calculate the shear stress for the PBBs, one has to get to know about
the viscosity of the PBBs. Actually, viscosity is an intrinsic property of any substance.
According to the statistical mechanics, the viscosity of any system is equal to its equation of
state multiplied by the average time between two successive collisions between its particles
i.e collision time 3 . For PBBs, the collision time of monomers can be calculated as follows.
The Rouse time scale tells us how much time it takes for a monomer to travel a certain
distance by diffusion. Therefore, one could assume that for the PBBs, the mean free path
or the average distance between monomers is (2N σ/D)−1/3 and the diffusion constant of
monomers is (kB T /N ξ). By dividing the mean free path squared by the diffusion constant,
one would get the following time scale as the collision time for monomers in a PBB,

This is the shortest time scale during which monomers are kicked by other monomers.
Note here that, this is from the kicks that monomers get from the solvent molecules because
here I assume that monomers are much larger than solvent molecules. Having calculated
the collision time, one would calculate the PBB viscosity as η = p τ . The result of this
calculation has been shown in Fig. (2).
Fig. (2) shows that the PBBs viscosity follows the universal power laws as given bellow,

η ∼ a−0.88 b0.8 N σ 0.88 ξ

(14)

Note that, the viscosity scales as ∼ b0.58 for b  3. However, in terms of the distance
between the plates D, the PBBs viscosity indicates sort of complex behavior. As depicted
in Fig. (2), one would recognize that the viscosity decreases by distance, nevertheless,
it possesses two exteremums in certain distances. In principle, the viscosity decreases by
distance up to a certain distance in which the viscosity begins increasing. After increasing
by distance to a certain value, the viscosity begins decreasing again.
Now that the viscosity as well as the equation of state are calculated, one would calculate
the viscosity and the kinetic friction coefficient as following,

Note here that, in the friction coefficient equation, the shear rate itself is a function of
the D. It means that the actual dependence upon the plates distance is D−1/3 . In the next
section, I proceed to make conclusions and discuss the final arguments. Also, I would like
to discuss some advantages of my approach to the problem of the PBBs under stationary
shear.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this article, I addressed the polymer brush bilayers under stationary shear motion at linear
response regime. At linear response regime the shear forces are weaker than the entropic
forces and are not able to change the equation of states. However, the normal and shear
stresses split by presence of the weak shear forces. This is the linear response regime in which
the PBBs behave some what similar to Newtonian fluids. The only thing the PBBs have
common with the Newtonian fluids is the linear dependence of transport quantities upon the
shear rate. Clearly, the dependence upon molecular parameters are totally different from
those of the Newtonian fluids.
The idea here is that the whole structure of the PBB system is significant to produce
friction under shear. The complex processes at molecular scale such as collision time and the
equation of state are apparently responsible for the friction and definitely interpenetration 4
is not responsible for that. o Trationally reject the significance of the interpenetration
between the brushes in friction one possible answer could be given as following. This is
accepted that every shear induced force will be relaxed in the system as long as the linear
response regime holds. Now, in this condition, how to admit that the stress produced in
the narrow interpenetration region will be transferred to the plates without being relaxed.
Another argument for rejecting the significance of the interpenetration would be laying in the
nonlinear response regime of the PBBs. It has been observed that at Weissenberg numbers
larger than unity, the shear stress follows sublinear regime while the interpenetration length
vanishes. However, the shear stress still is non-zero. So it would seem irrational to relate
those two effects to each other.s Remarkably, the present approach indicates that the PBB
viscosity decreases by the Kuhn length and the plates distance. These are rational predictions
as one could admit that when monomers get bigger, the entropic effects weaken and at
ultimate case there will be few large spheres between the plates. Certainly, the viscosity of.
On the other hand, the viscosity decreases by the plates distance which is again well admitted.
When the plates get more distant, then at a certain distance the entropic effects disappear.
This can happen by decrease of the monomer concentration as well as increase of the collision
time. It is shown that the viscosity increases by molecular parameters such as the degree of

polymerization, the second Virial coefficient, the grafting density and the monomer friction
constant. The linear dependence of the viscosity upon the degree of polymerization and the
monomer friction constant tells us that the connectivity of monomers in the backbone of
chains is very significant rather than the number of chains i.e. the grafting density.
The kinetic friction coefficient decreases by the plates distance as well as grafting density
and it increases by the other molecular parameters. These are rational results based on the
fact that more distant plates make smaller concentration and larger grafting densities give
rise to more stretched chains, and therefore, more ordered system. The order is a source of
the lower viscosity.
The problem of PBBs under stationary shear at nonlinear response regime would be the
next step of my research. Moreover, the
