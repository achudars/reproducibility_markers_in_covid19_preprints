Abstract
Salmonella enterica serotype Kentucky (S. Kentucky) can be a common causative
agent of salmonellosis, usually associated with consumption of contaminated poultry.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple drugs, including ciprofloxacin, is an emerging
problem within this serotype. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the
phylogenetic structure and AMR content of 121 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates from five
continents. Population structure was inferred using phylogenomic analysis and whole
genomes were compared to investigate changes in gene content, with a focus on acquired
AMR genes. Our analysis showed that multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Kentucky isolates
belonged to a single lineage, which we estimate emerged circa 1989 following the acquisition
of the AMR-associated Salmonella genomic island 1 (variant SGI1-K) conferring resistance
to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Phylogeographic
analysis indicates this clone emerged in Egypt before disseminating into Northern, Southern

and Western Africa, then to the Middle East, Asia and the European Union. The MDR clone
has since accumulated various substitution mutations in the quinolone resistance determining
regions (QRDR) of DNA gyrase (gyrA) and DNA topoisomerase IV (parC), such that most
strains carry three QRDR mutations which together confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. The
majority of AMR genes in the S. Kentucky genomes were carried either on plasmids or SGI
structures. Remarkably, each genome of the MDR clone carried a different SGI1-K
derivative structure; this variation could be attributed to IS26-mediated insertions and
deletions, which appear to have hampered previous attempts to trace the clone’s evolution
using sub-WGS resolution approaches. Several different AMR plasmids were also identified,
encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems,
and/or azithromycin. These results indicate that most MDR S. Kentucky circulating globally
result from the clonal expansion of a single lineage that acquired chromosomal AMR genes
30 years ago, and has continued to diversify and accumulate additional resistances to last-line
oral antimicrobials.

Impact Statement
Fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella enterica and carbapenem resistant, extended
spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae are amongst the highest
priority pathogens posing a risk to human health as determined by the World Health
Organisation (WHO). All of these high level resistances have been detected in a single
serotype of S. enterica, S. Kentucky, against a background of multidrug resistance to first-line
antimicrobials, leaving very limited treatment options. Here, we analysed the genomes of S.
Kentucky from geographically diverse sources, to investigate the emergence and spread of
antibiotic resistance in this problem pathogen. We discovered that the multidrug resistant
(MDR) genomes in our collection comprised a clonal MDR lineage that we estimate arose in
Egypt in ~1989, before spreading across Africa, then into Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Resistance to first-line antibiotics mostly arose from the chromosomal integration of a large
genomic island, the Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1), in the common ancestor of the
MDR lineage. Most strains were also fluoroquinolone resistant, due to acquisition of point
mutations in chromosomal genes gyrA and parC early in the clone’s evolution. Additional
resistances, including to third-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone), carbapenems
(such as imipenem), and the last-line oral antibiotic azithromycin, emerged through
acquisition of diverse locally circulating MDR plasmids. Aside from antibiotic resistance, we
found no other genetic determinants that could explain the global success of this S. Kentucky
lineage. These data show the MDR clone of S. Kentucky is already widespread and is capable
of acquiring last-line resistances, suggesting it should be considered a high-risk global MDR
clone.

Introduction
Carbapenem-resistant,
extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing
Enterobacteriaceae and fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella have been recently listed as
priority pathogens that pose the greatest threats to human health (critical and high threat
levels, respectively) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (1). All these resistances have
been observed in a single serotype of Salmonella enterica, Kentucky (S. Kentucky), since the
2000s (2-5). Ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Kentucky (CIPR S. Kentucky) was first observed in a
French traveller returning from Egypt in 2002, before being increasingly isolated globally
(2). Between 2007 and 2012, the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(ECDC) reported 1301 isolations of S. Kentucky from 12 countries, including 955 (73.4%)
CIPR S. Kentucky (6). These isolates were found in patients across the world, but
predominantly in Northern Africa, Europe, and Southern Asia. Several previous studies have
described the rapid spread of CIPR S. Kentucky from Northern Africa to the rest of the
African continent, as well as the Middle East, Europe and Asia (3-5). CIPR S. Kentucky is a
foodborne pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in humans, and domestic poultry has played an
important role in its global spread (most recently in South Asia and Europe). Multi-locus
sequencing typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) have revealed that
CIPR S. Kentucky is a single population belonging to sequence type (ST) 198 and not ST152,
which is a prevalent S. Kentucky ST found in poultry in the United States of America (USA)
but rarely reported in humans (7).
Before the 1990s, S. Kentucky ST198 was susceptible to all antibiotics. Since then,
multidrug resistance has emerged (2). In the early 1990s, S. Kentucky ST198 acquired a
variant of the Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) into the chromosome, likely in Egypt (8).
Initially characterised in S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strain DT104 (9), the SGI1 is a
site-specific Integrative Mobilizable Element (IME) that integrates in the 3’-end of the
conserved chromosomal gene trmE (10). SGI1 is the prototype element of a multidrug
resistance IME family named SGI/PGI/AGI which includes both Proteus genomic islands
(PGI) (11) and Acinetobacter genomic islands (AGI) (12). They consist of a 27 kbp related
backbone with conserved gene synteny and variable regions containing complex class 1
integron structures, IS, and Tn elements that are responsible for multidrug resistance. As an
IME, SGI1 is specifically mobilized in trans by conjugative IncC plasmids (13-15). The most
recent findings revealed complex interactions between SGI1 and IncC plasmids for transfer
and maintenance. Since the first description of SGI1 in S. Typhimurium DT104, several
variants of SGI/PGI/AGI have been discovered, which differ in their antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) gene content and AMR gene cluster structure (16,17) in species of families
Enterobacteriaceae, Morganellaceae, and Acinetobacter baumanii (12,18). These variants
usually differ in the composition of the integron, and each variant carries different AMR
genes. One variant of the SGI, known as SGI2 or SGI1-J, differs not only in the composition
of the integron, but also in the site at which the integron is inserted into the SGI backbone
(8,19).
Four main types of SGI have so far been described in S. Kentucky: SGI1-K, SGI1-P,
SGI1-Q (see Figure 2) and SGI2 (4). These SGI1 variants share a common genetic feature
consisting of an insertion/deletion between S005 and S009 due to the insertion of IS1359,
which was also found in a few other SGI1 variants in strains of different S. enterica serotypes
isolated in 2000 in Egypt, and more recently in P. mirabilis (20). Additionally, these three
SGI1 variants show a truncation the 5’-end of S044, the final ORF of the SGI backbone,
through the insertion of IS26 (21). SGI1-K contains a complex mosaic resistance region
made of different segments of transposons Tn21, Tn1721, Tn5393, Tn3-like, and a In4-type

integron structure, as well as IS26 elements (22). SGI1-P and SGI1-Q contain only the IS26flanked Tn3-like structure carrying blaTEM-1 and only the rightmost IS26 in S044,
respectively (21).
After the acquisition of SGI1 by the multidrug resistant (MDR) lineage, high levelresistance to fluoroquinolones emerged, conferred by a combination of three amino-acid
substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC.
Previous epidemiological studies determined that these mutations likely arose in Egypt in the
early 2000s (3).
Finally, additional resistance was gained through the acquisition of locally circulating
plasmid-borne ESBL, AmpC and/or carbapenemase genes (5). Additionally, the geographic
distribution of ciprofloxacin-resistant (CIPR) S. Kentucky ST198 overlaps with other highly
drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae carrying plasmid-borne ESBL, AmpC and/or
carbapenemase genes, leading to predictions that highly-drug resistant S. Kentucky ST198
strains are likely to become more frequent in the near future due to novel plasmid
acquisitions (4,5).
To date, all previous studies have used conventional typing methods (MLST, PCR,
PFGE, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST)) and together they suggest that the
recent global spread of CIPR S. Kentucky may reflect the expansion of a single clone, driven
by the emergence of AMR. However, the precise nature, order, and timing of the
evolutionary events underlying this overall picture, remain unclear. Here we investigate the
global population structure of MDR S. Kentucky ST198 using whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) and phylogenomic analysis to interrogate a collection of 121 human and non-human
isolates collected from 33 countries on five continents, between 1937 and 2016. We use
comparative genomics to reconstruct the various steps in the acquisition of AMR
determinants within the emerging MDR S. Kentucky ST198 clone, and to investigate the
presence of genetic elements not related to AMR that might have conferred other selective
advantages to this emerging bacterial pathogen.

Methods
Bacterial isolates used in this study
A total of 97 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates were directly analysed in this study (Table
S1), including 68 isolates collected between 1937 and 2013 that were previously studied by
conventional molecular methods (3-5,23), and 29 new isolates collected between 2008 and
2016. These isolates originated from the French National Reference Center for E. coli,
Shigella, Salmonella (Institut Pasteur) and several other international laboratories and were
selected on the basis of their diversity (human or non-human source, geographic area and
year of isolation, PFGE types, and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes). WGS
data for a further 24 S. Kentucky isolates was included in genomic analyses as detailed
below.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
AST was performed on all 97 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates using the disk diffusion
method with a panel of 32 antimicrobial agents (Bio-Rad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) as
described previously (24). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone,
ceftazidime, imipenem, ertapenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and tigecycline
were also determined by Etests (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Results were interpreted with

breakpoints. In particular, we used ciprofloxacin clinical breakpoints defined for intestinal
Salmonella isolates: susceptible when MIC ≤ 0.25 mg/L and resistant when MIC > 0.5 mg/L.
Whole-genome sequencing
The 97 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates were subjected to WGS at GATC Biotech
(Konstanz, Germany) (n=45), the Institut Pasteur (PF1 and P2M sequencing platforms)
(n=43), the Technical University of Denmark (n=7), or at the Institute for Genome Sciences,
University of Maryland School of Medicine (IGS-UoM) (n=2), on Illumina platforms
generating 100 to 146 bp paired-end reads, yielding a mean of 196-fold coverage (minimum
30-fold, maximum 687-fold) (Table S1). Short-read sequences have been deposited at the
European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), under study accession
number PRJNA445436 and the genome accession numbers are provided in Table S1.
Other studied genomes
Additional S. Kentucky ST198 WGS data were obtained from the GenomeTrakr
project. All 3,014 S. Kentucky isolates in the Salmonella project were downloaded from
NCBI on 2016-01-06, and ST was determined using SRST2 (25). From the ST198
GenomeTrakr sequences, we selected 24 genomes from geographic regions underrepresented
in our dataset (accessions in Table S1), bringing the total number of genomes analysed in
this study to 121.
Sequencing and construction of reference genome 201001922
Genomic DNA from S. Kentucky ST198 isolate 201001922 was also sequenced using
a hybrid sequencing approach at IGS-UoM, as previously described (26). Paired-end, 3-kb
insert libraries sequenced on the 454 GS FLX Titanium platform (Roche, Branford, CT) were
combined with paired-end, 300 to 400-bp insert libraries sequenced with 100-bp read length
on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Hybrid assemblies were generated
with the Celera assembler (http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/wiki/) based on different
ratios of 454 and Illumina sequence data and the outputs were compared with respect to the
number of resulting scaffolds and total scaffold length. For the final assembly, a 27-fold
genome coverage of 454 and a 30-fold coverage of Illumina sequence data were combined to
create a draft genome sequence consisting of eleven scaffolds and a total length of 4.86 Mbp.
Contigs and scaffolds from the draft assembly were concatenated using a linker sequence
(NNNNNCACACACTTAATTAATTAAGTGTGTGNNNNN), in order to generate continuous
"pseudochromosomes". The linker sequence contains START and STOP codons in each
frame and orientation, to allow the gene finder to call truncated genes at all contig ends.
Contig orders and orientations within the pseudochromosome were determined based on
NUCmer (27) nucleotide sequence comparison to ST152 S. Kentucky strain CVM29188
(SL475) as a reference genome. Protein-coding and RNA gene predictions and functional
annotations were carried out with CloVR-Microbe (28).
The genome sequence of S. Kentucky ST198 isolate 201001922 has been deposited in
GenBank under the accession number CP028357.
Mapping and phylogenomic analysis
Short reads for all 121 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates were mapped to the reference
genome 201001922 using the mapping pipeline RedDog v1b4

(https://github.com/katholt/RedDog) to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs). RedDog
uses Bowtie2 v2.2.3 (29) with the sensitive local method and a maximum insert size of 2000
to map all genomes to the reference genome. SNVs were then identified using SAMtools
v0.0.19 (30) and alleles at each locus were determined by comparing to the consensus base in
that genome, using SAMtools pileup to remove low quality alleles (base quality <= 20, read
depth <=5 or a heterozygous base call). SNVs were filtered to exclude those present in repeat
regions, phage regions, or the SGI. Gubbins v1 (31) was run using default settings to identify
and remove SNVs in recombinant regions. The final SNV set used for phylogenetic analysis
consisted of 2,066 SNVs.
To estimate a Bayesian phylogeny with divergence dates, an alignment of SNV alleles
was passed to BEAST v2.4.6 (32), in addition to isolation dates for each genome. The model
parameters were as follows: GTR+G substitution model, lognormal relaxed clock, constant
population size. As the coefficient of rate variation parameter was calculated to be 0.57 (95%
HPD 0.44-0.70), and the distribution was not abutting zero, a relaxed clock model was
favoured over a strict clock. The model with a constant population size produced higher
overall likelihoods compared to a Bayesian skyline model, and calculations of changes in
population size in the skyline model indicated that the population had been constant over
time, so the simpler model was favoured.
Five independent BEAST runs of 100 million iterations were combined, representing
450 million Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generations after burn-in removed.
Parameter estimates were calculated using Tracer v1.6 (33). A maximum clade credibility
tree was generated using TreeAnnotator v1.7.5 (34). To test the robustness of the molecular
clock signal, ten further BEAST runs with randomised tip dates were generated using the
same model.
Additional testing of the molecular clock was undertaken by constructing a
maximum-likelihood phylogeny using RAxML v8.1.23 (35) with the final set of SNVs. To
check for a molecular clock signal, a linear regression was performed using the root-to-tip
distances from the phylogeny with year of isolation.
Phylogeographic analysis was performed by modelling geographic region (defined by
the United Nations subregion geoschemes (36)) as a discrete trait on the final BEAST tree,
using an empirical Bayes method (37) implemented in the make.simmap function in phytools
v0.6.44 (38).
Assembly, annotation and pangenome analysis
All reads were filtered using FastXToolKit v0.0.14 (39) to remove all reads
containing bases called as ‘N’, and Trimmomatic v0.30 (40) was used to remove any reads
with an average phred quality score below 30. Each isolate genome was assembled using
SPAdes v3.5 (41) using a kmer range of 21, 33, 55, 65 and 75. Scaffolding was performed
using SSPACE v3.0 (42) and GapFiller v1.10 (43) with default settings. All assemblies were
ordered against the S. Kentucky ST198 strain 201001922 reference genome using Abacas
v1.3.1 (44). Prokka v1.10 (45) was used to annotate each assembly using a preferential
protein database made up of coding sequences from the 201001922 reference genome, the
ARG-Annot resistance database (46), the SGI1, SGI1-K and SGI2 references (accessions
AF261825, AY463797 and AY963803). Roary v3.6.0 (47) was used to determine core and
accessory genes for all annotated genomes. Core genes were defined as present in at least
95% of genomes.

Identification of resistance, virulence and phage genes
AMR gene alleles were determined by mapping short reads to the ARG-Annot
resistance database (46) using SRST2 (25). AMR gene locations were determined by
interrogating genome assemblies with BLAST v2.3.0 (48).
Associations between AMR genes and SGI type or geographic regions were
determined using two-way contingency tables for each gene. Each region was tested with
Fisher’s Exact Test to determine if the frequency of the gene was positively associated with
that specific region compared to all other regions. A p-value cut-off of 0.05 was used to
determine significance.
Presence or absence of Salmonella virulence genes defined in the VFDB database
(49) was determined using SRST2 to screen the short read data.
All genomes were screened using PHASTER (50) to detect phage regions.
Reconstruction of SGI sequences
ISMapper v1 (51) and the assembly graph viewer Bandage (52) were used to piece
together segments of the SGI in each genome. To do this, each assembly was queried with
BLAST to identify which contigs contained SGI backbone and AMR genes. Each assembly
was also queried for IS26 using ISMapper's assembly improvement mode (51), identifying
contigs that contained IS26 flanking sequence. Contigs containing flanking IS26 sequence
with SGI genes or AMR genes were hypothesised to be part of the SGI. Both pieces of
information (BLAST and ISMapper results) were used in conjunction with the reference
SGI1-K reference sequence (accession AY463797) to determine which contigs could be
joined together. In some cases, it was unclear whether IS26-flanked AMR genes were located
within the SGI or a plasmid. In these cases, Bandage was used to examine the assembly
graphs and determine the paths linking the SGI, IS26 and AMR genes, providing additional
evidence for contig connection.
IS26 copy number was estimated by mapping all genomes to the IS26 sequence using
Bowtie v2.2.9 (29), and dividing the read depth across IS26 by the average chromosomal
read depth. To assess whether IS26 copy number was increasing over time within the MDR
lineage, a linear regression analysis was performed using estimated IS26 copy number and
year of isolation for each isolate.
Analysis of IncI1 and IncC plasmids
All S. Kentucky ST198 genomes were screened for plasmid replicons using SRST2
with the PlasmidFinder database (53).
Reads from S. Kentucky ST198 isolates containing IncI1 plasmids as well as a set of
publicly available IncI1 plasmid sequences (Table S2) were mapped to the IncI1 plasmid
pNF1358 (accession DQ017661). SNVs were called using the same method as described
above for chromosomal SNVs. The resulting SNVs were filtered to include only those that
were present in core genes (defined as genes present in 100% of the IncI1 plasmid
sequences). The final alignment consisted of 1,380 SNVs, which was used to create a
maximum likelihood tree with RAxML v8.1.16 (35) using a GTR+G model with 100
bootstraps.

Reads from S. Kentucky ST198 isolates containing IncC plasmids were typed with
SRST2 against the cgMLST IncA/C plasmid database (54) to determine the 28-locus plasmid
sequence type (pST) for each plasmid.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of S. Kentucky ST198
All 121 S. Kentucky ST198 genomes were mapped to the draft reference genome for
S. Kentucky ST198 strain 201001922 (see Methods), and 2,066 SNVs were identified in the
core genome. Linear regression of root-to-tip distances against year of isolation indicated
strong temporal structure for all isolates, as did date randomisation tests in BEAST (Figure
S1, S2). The alignment of these SNVs and the years of isolation were then used to construct a
dated phylogenetic tree using BEAST, which was further overlaid with region of origin to
infer routes of geographical spread (see Methods). The results (Figure 1) indicate that nearly
all MDR isolates belong to a single monophyletic clade of S. Kentucky ST198, which we
estimate emerged around 1989 (95% HPD 1983 - 1993) in Egypt (Figure 1). The BEAST
analysis estimated the evolutionary rate to be 4.8x10-7 substitutions site-1 year-1 (95% HPD
5.28x10-7 - 3.78x10-7 substitutions site-1 year-1; see Figure S2). This is equivalent to a mean
rate of 1.6 SNVs per year, which is similar to rates estimated for other nontyphoidal
Salmonella serotypes including Typhimurium and Agona (55-57), and faster than those
estimated for typhoidal serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A (58-60).
The MDR clade includes all isolates carrying SGI1-K and derived variants, which
include all of the CIPR S. Kentucky ST198 (Figure 1; more details below). In addition to the
SGI, the MDR lineage has accumulated amino acid mutations in the QRDR. The first
mutation occurred circa 1992 in gyrA codon 83 (TCC to TTC, Ser83Phe) (light purple,
Figure 1), and was then followed circa 1996 by a mutation in codon 80 of parC (AGC to
ATC, Ser80Ile) (pink, Figure 1). These mutations increased MIC to ciprofloxacin, but CIPR
did not arise until additional mutations in codon 87 of gyrA; at least three such mutations
were observed in the MDR clade (GAC to GGC, AAC or TAC; Asp87Gly, Asp87Asn,
Asp87Tyr) (dark purple shades, Figure 1).
The parC-80 and gyrA-87 mutations accompanied a dramatic clonal expansion, with
the clone spreading from Egypt to other geographical locations (Figure 1). Multiple
independent transfers of S. Kentucky ST198 out of Egypt and Northern Africa are evident,
with two clades, carrying either Asp87Tyr (TAC) or Asp87Asn (AAC) mutations in GyrA
codon 87 emerging circa 2000. The former spread into East Africa, Middle Africa, South
Asia, Europe and Western Asia (dark red line, Figure 1); the latter spread to South-East Asia,
Europe and West Africa (black line, Figure 1).
Interestingly, the ST198 genomes isolated from agricultural sources in the USA
(including 98K, isolated from poultry in 1937, see Table S1) lack the SGI and gyrA/parC
mutations (Figure 1). Notably, while these strains were isolated contemporaneously with the
MDR clade (2003 to 2016) they are only distantly related to it, sharing a most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) circa 1925 (95% HPD 1898-1938; Figure 1). This finding is consistent
with previous work indicating that ST198 isolates from livestock or poultry in the USA
belong to a different genomic cluster (198.1) than MDR ST198 isolates from clinical cases
(198.2) (7).

Three S. Kentucky ST198 isolates were recovered, in consecutive years (2009, 2010
and 2011) from the same patient who had been infected in Egypt (dark orange box, Figure
1). These isolates belonged to the MDR lineage and shared an MRCA circa 2005, suggesting
persistent colonization of ~6 years duration (Figure 1). The 2011 isolate, 201100664,
differed the most from the inferred MRCA (30 SNVs; 21 non-synonymous SNVs, 6
synonymous SNVs, 3 intergenic SNVs), yielding an estimated in vivo substitution rate of 5
SNVs per year, faster than that estimated by BEAST analysis of the whole data set. Many of
the non-synonymous mutations were in genes responsible for flagella (n=7) and iron
transport (n=2) (Table S3), although no motility changes were detected in this isolate. Eleven
SNVs separated 201000305 and 09-9322 (8 non-synonymous SNVs, 2 synonymous SNVs, 1
intergenic SNV). One of these eleven SNVs was found in another iron transport gene
(asmbl_3909, Table S3).
SGI in S. Kentucky
The presence of any SGI backbone genes was taken as evidence of SGI integration
(Figure S3). The data indicate that the SGI has been acquired by S. Kentucky ST198 on three
distinct occasions, integrating each time site-specifically in the 3’-end of the trmE gene. SGI2
(previously SGI1-J), which carries the multidrug resistance region in a different position of
the SGI1 backbone (Figure 2a) was present in a single isolate from Indonesia, and SGI1-B
was present in a single isolate from India; both these isolates were distantly related to the
main MDR lineage (Figure 1). The vast majority (95%) of genomes belonging to the main
MDR lineage carried the SGI1-K subtype or one of its derivatives (SGI1-P or SGI1-Q),
consistent with acquisition of SGI1-K in the MRCA circa 1989 in Egypt, shortly before the
expansion of the clone (Figure 1). Within this MDR lineage, some isolates had large
deletions of the SGI backbone (eg: deletions spanning from S011 to S026, or from int to
S026), but still retained the multidrug resistance region between trmE and yidY (Figure S3,
Figure S4).
Almost every SGI1-positive S. Kentucky ST198 isolate in this study had a distinct
SGI structure (Figure 2b, Figure S4). In addition to large deletions of the SGI backbone,
some isolates had inversions of whole or part of the resistance gene segment of the island,
with various deletions and rearrangements of the transposons (Figure 2b). There were
multiple different IS26 insertion sites within the resistance elements of the island, providing
evidence that IS26 has mediated the majority of differences found in the resistance region of
the island (Figure 2b). We found that IS26 was rarely present in S. Kentucky ST198 isolates
outside of the MDR lineage (Figure S3). Within the MDR lineage, linear regression analysis
of IS26 copy number against year of isolation showed some evidence of IS26 accumulation
over time (0.12 IS26 copies per year, p=0.01, R2=0.05) (Figure S5).
There was no relationship between degraded SGI1s and geographic region or country,
or between the loss of core SGI resistance genes (defined as aacA5, blaTEM-1, sul1 and tetA)
and region (see Methods). We found that strAB, aphA2, aph3-Ia, catA1, dfrA12 and
mph(A)were present significantly more frequently in Egypt compared to all other regions
(Table S4).
Multidrug resistance genes and plasmids in S. Kentucky ST198
Overall, we found that 35 isolates in the full strain set carried at least one plasmid,
covering 13 different known plasmid incompatibility types (Table S1). Within the MDR
lineage, there was extensive phenotypic and genotypic variation in antimicrobial
susceptibility observed (Figure 3). A part of this variability could be attributed to the

acquisition of plasmids carrying additional AMR genes, as 32 isolates in the MDR lineage
carried genes outside the SGI that are likely plasmid-borne (Figure 3e). Known plasmid
replicons were identified in 23 isolates, and in total we identified eight different plasmid
incompatibility types across the MDR strain set (C, I1, L/M, Q1, W, X1, X4, Y). From these
23 isolates carrying known plasmid incompatibility types, we were able to determine precise
plasmid-AMR gene links for 20 isolates.
There appeared to be no link between geography and plasmid type, with plasmids
present in isolates from multiple different regions (Figure S6). The majority of genes
encoding carbapenemases (blaOXA-48 and blaNDM-1), ESBLs (blaCTX-M-1) and cephamycinases
(blaCMY-2, blaCMY-4 and blaCMY-16) were carried by either IncI1 or IncC (previously IncA/C2)
plasmids (Figure 3d, 3e). Two IncL/M plasmids were found to carry blaOXA-48 or blaCTX-M-15,
and an IncW plasmid was found to carry blaVIM-2 (Figure 3d, 3e). The eight isolates resistant
to azithromycin contained the mph(A) gene. These isolates clustered into two groups. A
plasmid location of mph(A) was found for four isolates. Three different Inc types were
identified (IncI1, IncC, and IncL/M).
There was little evidence that any plasmids were being maintained as the MDR
lineage evolved (Figure 3), although the group of three isolates recovered from the same
patient in Egypt (09-9322, 201000305, 201100664; discussed above) all carried IncI1
plasmids. These three plasmids were identical in their core gene content, although IncI1
plasmids in 201100664 differed from those in the earlier two isolates by two intergenic SNVs
(Figure S7). Interestingly these three isolates all lacked the SGI and any other chromosomal
resistance genes, and their IncI1 plasmids differed substantially from one another in
resistance gene content (Figure 3e). The two early isolates mostly carried resistance genes
for aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, phenicols and macrolides. The plasmid in
the final isolate, 201100664, had lost almost all of the resistance genes found in the previous
two isolates, except for mph(A), and had gained the carbapenemase-encoding blaOXA-48 gene.
IncI1 plasmids were detected in a further six S. Kentucky ST198 genomes, but these did not
cluster in either the IncI1 plasmid tree or the chromosome tree, consistent with seven distinct
introductions of IncI1 plasmids into the S. Kentucky ST198 MDR lineage, each associated
with distinct AMR gene contents (Figure 3, Figure S7).
Two isolates of the MDR lineage carried IncC plasmids (99-2998 and 201410673).
Both IncC plasmids were genotyped as pST3, which is commonly associated with blaCMY
(54), and this cephamycinase-encoding gene was found in the plasmid from isolate 99-2998.
Interestingly, the IncC plasmid in isolate 201401673 was carrying a carbapenemase-encoding
blaNDM-1 gene, which is more commonly found in pST1 IncC plasmids (54). This blaNDM-1
gene was found in a different structural context to the blaNDM genes in the pST1 IncC
plasmids; as usual it was downstream of ISAba125, however instead of being upstream of
ble, instead it was upstream of qacEΔ1 and sul1, with a remnant of the ble gene left behind
from the insertion of qacEΔ1 (Figure S8). We found that this blaNDM-1 region was entirely
covered by WGS reads, with no breaks or gaps in coverage, supporting that it is the true
structure in this plasmid (Figure S8). This configuration also appears in another pST3 IncC
plasmid, pRH-1238, from S. enterica serotype Corvallis (GenBank accession KR091911),
isolated from a wild bird in Germany (61).
Another source for the phenotypic diversity of S. Kentucky ST198 susceptibility
profiles was variations in the SGI1 (Figure 3d). Notably, plasmid carriage was significantly
associated in the cases where SGI1-P, SGI1-Q (containing few or no AMR genes), or no SGI

were detected (Fisher’s Exact Test, p=0.024, OR=2.65 95% CI = 1.09 - 6.64) (Figures 3b,
3d, 3e).
Chromosomal gene content diversity amongst S. Kentucky ST198 isolates
There was very little gene content diversity evident amongst the S. Kentucky ST198
chromosome sequences (Figure S9). Three phages were detected within the reference
genome 201001922 and these three phage regions, in addition to the SGI1, were the only
regions to show large differences between genomes from the MDR lineage and those from
other lineages (Figure S9). Supporting this, within the accessory gene content identified
using Roary (see Methods), only four genes were found to be present exclusively in all but
one of the MDR lineage genomes. All four of these genes were located within a single phage,
ST160 (43 kbp, 46 genes, positions 541864 - 584944 in the 201001922 reference genome).
This phage was found to be inserted between ompP and mlaA in the MDR lineage. A
variation of this phage was also present in the oldest genome, 98K, which is outside the MDR
lineage, however in this genome the phage was inserted between napB and hutI.
Examination of the virulence gene content in all isolates revealed that there was no
difference between S. Kentucky ST198 isolates belonging to the MDR lineage and those
belonging to other lineages (Figure S10). Only five virulence genes were present in less than
95% of genomes – gogB (0.8%), sipB (7%), sipC (35%), ompD (57%) and sciQ (80%)
(Table S5) – however these were randomly distributed in the tree and not associated with
lineage (Figure S10).

Discussion
Our data show that nearly all MDR S. Kentucky ST198 belong to a single lineage that
has accumulated AMR determinants since the early 1990s (Figure 1). It first acquired a
variant of the SGI1, SGI1-K which conferred resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin,
gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (Figure 2). The SGI1 structure appears to be
highly susceptible to genetic rearrangements, with distinct forms found in each isolate likely
due to the transpositional activity of IS26, which resulted in deletion of some or all genes
inside SGI1. The loss of resistance genes was often made up for by acquisition of additional
MDR plasmids (Figure 3).
IS26 is 820 bp long and encodes a single transposase with 14 bp terminal repeats on
each end (62). Each of the three SGI1 subtypes found in the MDR lineage carried one or
more copies of IS26, and all genomes in the MDR lineage carried IS26, with no genomes
outside of this clade carrying IS26. The recently described mechanism used by IS26 to
transpose may provide an explanation as to why the SGI variants in these isolates are so
dynamic. During the transposition, IS26 extracts itself from the donor DNA molecule, as well
as DNA lying upstream of it between itself and another IS26 element, and uses this to form a
translocatable unit (63). It then finds another IS26 element in the receiving DNA molecule,
and inserts itself as well as the excised donor DNA next to it, forming a tandem array of
IS26s in direct orientation (63). This model illustrates that IS26 is likely the causative agent
for many of the deletions, inversions and transpositions within the SGI, eventually resulting
in the genesis of the different SGI1 variants (SGI1-K, SGI1-P and SGI1-Q) seen in this
dataset (Figure 2).
Whilst the origin of the MDR clade appears to be intimately linked with the acquisition of the
SGI1 in Egypt, it is the QRDR triple-mutant CIPR subclade that disseminated globally
(Figure 1). Ciprofloxacin resistance is infrequent in Salmonella (64), and we hypothesise that

this high-level resistance is linked to strong selective pressure exerted by fluoroquinolone use
in poultry, S. Kentucky’s main reservoir (65). This resistance might also have come at no cost
to the fitness of the bacterial cell, as has been shown in close relatives S. Typhi and
Escherichia coli (66,67).
During its spread around the world, the S. Kentucky ST198 MDR lineage became
more resistant by the additional acquisition of various AMR plasmids, carrying genes
encoding resistance to newer drugs including third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems
and azithromycin. These genes were acquired locally around the Mediterranean basin with no
subsequent clonal expansion. Interestingly, the two isolates containing IncC plasmids did not
carry the SGI. This observation is supported by many studies in the literature which have
described the incompatibility of the SGI and IncC plasmids, as they share the same regulatory
system (14,68,69).
In this study we were unable to detect any other non-AMR related genes that could
explain the clonal success of the MDR lineage. Examination of phage, pseudogenes and
known virulence genes did not reveal any significant differences between the MDR lineage
and other S. Kentucky ST198 genomes, although this does not rule out the possibility of more
subtle variants contributing to virulence such as the regulatory SNV recently described for
invasive S. Typhimurium ST313 (70).
In conclusion, WGS analysis of S. Kentucky ST198 has significantly expanded our
knowledge of the evolution and dissemination of MDR variants of this important pathogen.
Previously, as this lineage was emerging, MLST and PFGE were used in combination (2,3)
for this purpose; however the diversity of PFGE types of CIPR S. Kentucky ST198 isolates
precluded any fine-scale or long-term analysis of S. Kentucky ST198 dissemination, which
our data shows was likely due to noise introduced by IS26 activity. The population structure
uncovered here should serve as a useful framework with which to understand and track the
ongoing evolution of the MDR lineage of S. Kentucky ST198, which our data clarifies is a
globally disseminated clone capable of rapid spread and further accumulation of last-line
AMR determinants.

Figure 1: Phylogeographic analysis of S. Kentucky ST198 based on whole genome SNV
data. Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree inferred using BEAST, with MDR lineage
shaded orange. Dark orange box indicates three isolates from the same patient. Major internal
nodes are labeled with circles indicating branch support (black, ≥95% posterior support; red,
>70% posterior support; hollow, >30% posterior support); divergence date estimates (95%
higher posterior density values) are provided for key points in the evolution of the MDR
lineage. Leaf nodes are coloured by region of origin (see inset map). Coloured branches
indicate inferred geographical distribution of internal branches, inferred using maximum
likelihood ancestral trait reconstruction. Data columns indicate country of origin; source of
isolate (H for human, N for non-human, ? for unknown); SGI type (see inset legend);
quinolone resistance-related codons, with resistance-associated alleles highlighted. Reference
genome 201001922 is marked with red arrow. Red and black vertical lines indicate clades
that are mentioned in-text.

Figure 2: SGI variation in S. Kentucky ST198. a, Backbone of SGI, with arrows pointing
to the different insertion sites of the resistance region in SGI1 and SGI2. b, Different
examples of SGI1 types in S. Kentucky ST198. Arrows show open reading frames (ORF) of
the SGI backbone and MDR region with arrowheads indicating direction of transcription;
colour indicates gene class. Coloured blocks indicate regions of homology between
sequences in the same orientation; green, same orientation; orange, inverse orientation.

Figure 3: Horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in the S. Kentucky
ST198 MDR lineage. a, Dated Bayesian (BEAST) phylogeny for the MDR lineage,
extracted from the tree shown in Figure 1. Leaf nodes are coloured by region of origin (see
legend); orange box highlights three isolates recovered from the same patient over three
years. b-e shows AMR features of each isolate in the tree. b, SGI type (see legend, dash
indicates no SGI detected). c, AMR phenotypes, indicated as boxes coloured by antimicrobial
class (see legend, I in box denotes intermediate resistance). d, AMR genes located within the
SGI1 are indicated with boxes coloured by antimicrobial class (* in box indicates gene is
interrupted). e, plasmid incompatibility group(s) identified in each genome; antimicrobial
resistance genes located within these plasmids are printed, coloured by antimicrobial class;
genes in brackets are genes whose location was unable to be determined.

Supplementary Figure 1: Temporal signal in the maximum likelihood phylogeny. Grey
dots, isolates not within the MDR lineage; red dots, isolates within the MDR lineage. Grey
line, linear regression of all isolates in tree; red line, linear regression of only isolates within
the MDR lineage. Values reported are the correlation coefficients for these regressions.

Supplementary Figure 2: Mutation rate estimates for real and randomised tip dates in
S. Kentucky ST198. First column, real mutation rate, in substitutions per site per year.
Subsequent columns show mutation rate when tip dates are randomised. Black circles are the
mean rate estimated by BEAST, with error bars showing 95% highest posterior density
(HPD).

Supplementary Figure 3: Presence of SGI backbone genes in each S. Kentucky ST198
isolate, with an estimate of overall IS26 copy number. Left, dated Bayesian phylogeny,
with tips and branches coloured by region (as per map inset and Figure 1). Red blocks
indicate the presence at least one resistance gene in the SGI resistance region. Light blue
blocks indicate presence of chromosomal genes flanking the SGI (trmE and yidY). Dark blue
blocks indicate presence of SGI backbone genes. Yellow bars show estimated IS26 copy
number in each isolate.

Supplementary Figure 4: Additional SGI1 examples. Coding regions are represented as
arrows and are coloured as per legend. SGI sequences are grouped by type - SGI1-K, SGI1-P
and SGI1-Q. Contig breaks are shown by thick black vertical lines, with IS26 flanking
regions detected with ISMapper marked with purple vertical lines.

Supplementary Figure 5: Relationship between year of isolation of S. Kentucky ST198
and estimated IS26 copy number. Points are coloured by the SGI type found in that strain,
as per legend.

Supplementary Figure 6: Heatmap showing proportion of each plasmid replicon within
each region found in the S. Kentucky ST198 MDR lineage.

Supplementary Figure 7: Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of IncI1 plasmids. Phylogeny
is midpoint rooted, with tips coloured by genus (as per legend) and S. Kentucky ST198
isolates from this study coloured pink. Orange box indicates three S. Kentucky isolates from
a single patient, all carrying IncI1 plasmids. Country of isolation is listed next to the S.
Kentucky isolates used in this study.

Supplementary Figure 8: Coverage across NDM-1 region in isolate #201410673.
Positions of genes depicted as arrows, with arrows pointing in the direction of transcription.
Light blue, other plasmid genes; red, resistance genes; purple, transposable elements. Genes
without names are hypothetical proteins. Dark orange box shows boundaries of exact match
to the same blaNDM-1 configuration in S. enterica serotype Corvallis (GenBank accession no.
KR091911). Depth is number of reads at each base position on the x-axis.

Supplementary Figure 9: Comparison of a subset of S. Kentucky ST198 genomes to
reference genome 201001922. Inner black ring indicates 201001922 genome position,
followed by GC content. Blue rings indicate S. Kentucky ST198 isolates belonging to the
MDR lineage, grey rings other S. Kentucky ST198 isolates. The location of each isolate is
shown on the phylogeny - numbers indicate which ring is shown by the isolate.

Supplementary Figure 10: Heatmap of virulence gene content in all S. Kentucky ST198
isolates. Tips of the phylogeny are coloured by region, as per legend. Each column of the
heatmap is a virulence gene, black indicates presence, white indicates absence. Virulence
genes are clustered to reveal patterns.
Supplementary Table 1: Metadata associated with each S. Kentucky ST198 isolate used
in this study.
Supplementary Table 2: Plasmid accessions for IncI1 plasmids used in this study.
Supplementary Table 3: Mutations found amongst the three isolates taken from the
same patient.
Supplementary Table 4: P-values (calculated using Fisher’s Exact Test) between
resistance genes and geographic regions for each resistance gene found across all
isolates. P-values < 0.05 indicate a positive association with that resistance gene and that
specific geographic region.
