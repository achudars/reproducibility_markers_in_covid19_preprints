Abstract
Background: Neuromodulation by transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) offers the potential to non-invasively treat specific brain regions, with treatment location verified by
magnetic resonance acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI).
Objective: To investigate the safety of these methods prior to widespread clinical use, we
report histologic findings in two large animal models following FUS neuromodulation and
MR-ARFI.
Methods: Two rhesus macaques and thirteen Dorset sheep were studied. FUS neuromodulation was targeted to the primary visual cortex in rhesus macaques and to subcortical
locations, verified by MR-ARFI, in eleven sheep. Both rhesus macaques and five sheep
received a single FUS session, whereas six sheep received repeated sessions three to six
days apart. The remaining two control sheep did not receive ultrasound but otherwise
underwent the same anesthetic and MRI procedures as the eleven experimental sheep.

lowing FUS) were evaluated for tissue damage at FUS and control locations as well as
tissue within the path of the FUS beam. TUNEL staining was used to evaluate for the
presence of apoptosis in sheep receiving high dose FUS.
Results: No FUS-related pre-mortem histologic findings were observed in the rhesus
macaques or in any of the examined sheep. Extravascular red blood cells (RBCs) were
present within the meninges of all sheep, regardless of treatment group. Similarly, small
aggregates of perivascular RBCs were rarely noted in non-target regions of neural parenchyma
of FUS-treated (8/11) and untreated (2/2) sheep. However, no concurrent histologic abnormalities were observed, consistent with RBC extravasation occurring as post-mortem
artifact following brain extraction. Sheep within the high dose FUS group were TUNELnegative at the targeted site of FUS.
Conclusions: The absence of FUS-related histologic findings suggests that the neuromodulation and MR-ARFI protocols evaluated do not cause tissue damage.

Introduction

2

Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) delivers targeted ultrasound energy to specific

3

brain regions without damaging intervening tissue or requiring skull removal (Martin and

4

Werner, 2013; Lipsman et al., 2014). Importantly, transcranial FUS avoids the risks asso-

5

ciated with invasive procedures (e.g., bleeding, infection) while maintaining high spatial

6

resolution and the ability to reach subcortical targets, which limit other neurosurgical and

7

neurostimulatory methods.

8

A potentially transformative application of transcranial FUS is neuromodulation, which

9

is thought to be a noninvasive method to explore brain function and circuitry (Tyler et al.,

10

2018). Neuromodulation uses short bursts of low intensity ultrasound to excite or inhibit

11

neural activity and can be targeted to subcortical structures at the scale of a few millime-

12

ters, which cannot be achieved by other noninvasive neuromodulation modalities such

13

as transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation (Monti et al., 2016; Naor et al., 2016;

14

Fomenko et al., 2018). This could enable functional mapping of small nuclei for treatment

15

targeting and for advancing neuroscience, and offer a possible treatment for neurological

16

conditions (Kubanek, 2018).

17

Human studies of FUS neuromodulation of cortical and subcortical regions have not

18

led to detectable tissue changes on post-session MRI or behavioral deficits (Hameroff

19

et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015, 2016b; Legon et al., 2014, 2018a,b). As summarized in a

20

recent review of FUS neuromodulation, fourteen out of fifteen animal publications showed

21

no abnormal histologic findings (Blackmore et al., 2019). Included in the fourteen studies

22

were two large animal studies, one in pigs (Dallapiazza et al., 2017) and one in macaques (Ver-

23

hagen et al., 2019), which found no tissue damage resulting from FUS neuromodulation.

24

However, one study in sheep raised concerns of microhemorrhage after exposure to pro-

25

longed, repetitive FUS neuromodulation (Lee et al., 2016c). Thus, the first purpose of this

3

26

work was to ascertain whether neuromodulation poses a risk of tissue microhemorrhage in

27

sheep as suggested by Lee et al., with the addition of controls not treated with FUS, and

28

in rhesus macaques.

29

In addition, FUS neuromodulation is aided by confirmation of FUS targeting in the

30

brain. MR acoustic radiation force imaging (MR-ARFI) uses a series of very short FUS

31

bursts at higher intensity to visualize the ultrasound focal spot in situ. The ultrasound

32

pulses slightly displace tissue which, in synchrony with MRI, can be detected as a shift in

33

image phase (McDannold and Maier, 2008). This phase shift is proportional to the ultra-

34

sound intensity applied, and therefore can provide a non-invasive metric of the intensity

35

delivered at the focal spot. MR-ARFI can also be used to assess and compensate for dis-

36

tortion of the ultrasound through the skull. Proposed clinical applications of MR-ARFI

37

include validation of treatment targeting (Holbrook et al., 2011; Auboiroux et al., 2012),

38

optimization of transducer focusing through the skull (Larrat et al., 2009; Marsac et al.,

39

2012; Vyas et al., 2014), and assessment of tissue changes during treatment (McDannold

40

and Maier, 2008; Holbrook et al., 2010; Bitton et al., 2012).

41

Almost no assessments of MR-ARFI safety have been reported. Two reports of in vivo

42

MR-ARFI in the body, one in rabbits (Huang et al., 2009) and one in pigs (Holbrook et al.,

43

2011), have been published but did not discuss safety. One study involving transcranial

44

MR-ARFI in two macaques has been published, but did not include histology (Chaplin

45

et al., 2019). To our knowledge, the only report of MR-ARFI safety is from a study

46

that investigated histology after transcranial MR-ARFI in one rodent, in which no tissue

47

damage was observed (Larrat et al., 2009). The second purpose of this work was to assess

48

tissue safety in a controlled study of transcranial MR-ARFI in sheep.

49

We evaluate histology in brain tissue following FUS neuromodulation in the visual

50

cortex of rhesus macaques, and following neuromodulation and MR-ARFI in subcortical

51

brain regions in sheep. The sheep histology includes a treatment control group in which

52

no FUS was applied, and internal controls from hemispheres not treated with FUS. Our

53

neuromodulation protocols included a component similar to those used in human stud-

54

ies, and to those evaluated by Lee and colleagues. We also investigated a broader range

55

of intensity values and repeated number of FUS bursts, exceeding those values typically

56

used in human protocols as well as those used in the study by Lee et al. Our findings

57

provide important information for subsequent studies involving FUS neuromodulation or

58

MR-ARFI.

Materials and Methods

60

All animal experiments were performed with institutional approval from the Stanford

61

University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.

62

Rhesus macaque study

63

Two 4-year-old adult male rhesus macaques (4.6 kg and 4.8 kg) were acquired from

64

the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center in November 2016. Both non-human

65

primates (NHP-1 and NHP-2) were clinically healthy on physical examination and were

66

seronegative for the following pathogens: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, simian immunod-

67

eficiency virus, and simian T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 and 2. One animal was seropos-

68

itive for simian retrovirus. Animals were housed in indoor caging and maintained on a

69

12:12 hr light:dark cycle in an AAALAC-accredited facility. Animals were fed a com-

70

mercial primate diet (Teklad Global 20% Protein Primate Diet 2050, Envigo, Madison,

71

WI) supplemented with fresh produce, and had unrestricted access to water. Figure 1(a)

72

summarizes study characteristics.

73

Anesthesia and preparation

74

Both animals were sedated with ketamine (4 mg/kg, intramuscularly) and dexmedeto-

75

midine (0.02 mg/kg, intramuscularly) and anesthetized with 2-3% isoflurane throughout

76

the FUS procedure. The hair was shaved from the back of the head prior to transducer

77

placement.

78

Focused ultrasound

79

A single-element, 270 kHz focused ultrasound transducer fitted with an agar-filled

80

cone was positioned at the back of the head and coupled with degassed ultrasound gel as

81

illustrated in Fig. 1(b) (H-115, Sonic Concepts, Bothell, WA).

82

FUS was targeted to four regions in the visual cortex as shown in Fig. 1(c). A coupling

83

cone was used such that the ultrasound focus was positioned at the surface of the brain (5

84

cm length from transducer). The focal pressure half-width was approximately 17 mm in

85

the axial direction and 6 mm in the lateral direction. The lower two focal spot locations

86

were placed 2 mm above the center of the inion and spaced bilaterally by 15 mm (NHP-1)

87

and 20 mm (NHP-2). The upper two focal spot locations were located directly above at 10

88

mm (NHP-1) or 15 mm (NHP-2).

89

FUS was applied in 300 ms pulsed (50% duty cycle) bursts occurring every 1 s for

90

a total of 500 stimuli, as illustrated in Fig. 1(d). One 8.3 min FUS trial (comprising

91

500 FUS bursts) was applied to each of the four neuromodulation locations. Free-field

92

stimulus pressure levels corresponded to 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 MPa as measured in a water tank

93

by fiberoptic hydrophone (Precision Acoustics, Dorset, UK), in order to sample a range

94

of values. In situ intensity was estimated after assuming approximately 40% pressure loss

95

through the macaque skull, based on reports from a previous study (Deffieux et al., 2013).

96

One spatial peak-temporal average intensity (ISP T A ) level was applied per location, with

97

estimated in situ values of 0.4 (top) and 1.6 (bottom) W/cm2 on the right hemisphere and

98

6.4 (top) and 25.8 (bottom) W/cm2 on the left hemisphere, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c).

99

Fixation and histopathology

100

Thirty minutes following FUS, the animals were anesthetized to a surgical plane with

101

5% isoflurane and initially perfused with 0.25-0.5 liters of saline. Next, the macaques

102

were perfused with 4 liters of 3.5% to 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at

103

high pressure for 2-3 minutes (2 liters) and at low pressure (2 liters) for one hour. Lastly,

104

they were perfused with 1-1.25 liters each of 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solutions at

105

high pressure for cryoprotection. The skull was removed using an autopsy saw (Shandon,

106

ThermoFisher Scientific, No. 10000) and the brain was extracted. The primary visual

107

cortex was segmented from the remaining cortex by making a coronal cut 2 mm posterior

108

to the lunate sulcus. Brains were then immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin

109

for 7-10 days. Formalin-fixed tissues were then processed routinely, embedded in paraffin,

110

sectioned at 7 µm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Three coronal tissue

111

sections were obtained from each hemisphere of the visual cortex, resulting in six total

112

sections per macaque (Fig. 1(c)). Each pair of left and right sections captured a cross-

113

section of all four focal spot beams and covered the full extent of each hemisphere. The

114

first two section pairs were obtained near the surface of the brain, in the region of the focal

115

peak, spaced about 4 mm apart. The third section pair was located about 3 mm beyond

116

the half-max intensity of the focus, at an approximate depth of 2 cm from the cortical

117

surface. Slides were blindly reviewed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (DB)

118

for the presence of necrosis, apoptosis, edema, hemorrhage, inflammation, and neuropil

119

rarefaction.

120

Sheep study

121

Thirteen male Dorset sheep weighing 22 to 36 kg were included in the study. Eleven

122

underwent transcranial FUS. Two animals did not receive ultrasound but otherwise under-

123

went the same experimental procedures.

124

Sheep were divided into FUS (n=11) and control (n=2) study groups. Animals that

125

received FUS were subdivided into four groups as follows: acute (n=2; euthanized zero

126

days after FUS study), delayed (n=3; euthanized four to seven days after FUS study),

127

repeated (n=3; underwent FUS again three to six days after the first FUS session, and

128

euthanized four days after the last FUS study), and high dose (n=3; received multiple

129

FUS sessions with prolonged application of FUS on the last day of study, and euthanized

130

four days later). Both sheep in the control group underwent multiple days of MRI study.

131

The two sheep in the acute FUS group and one sheep in the delayed FUS group also

132

underwent MRI study on one or more days prior to the FUS session. Study characteristics

133

are summarized in Fig. 2(a).

134

Anesthesia and preparation

135

Sheep were fasted for 24 hours prior to the study and then sedated with tiletamine and

136

zolazepam (Telazol, Lederele Parenterals, Carolina, Puerto Rico) at 4 mg/kg, intramuscu-

137

larly. Anesthesia was induced with a combination of 3% isoflurane in oxygen delivered

138

by facemask and telazol in a continuous rate of infusion. All animals were orotracheally

139

intubated and anesthesia was maintained with 1% to 3% isoflurane in oxygen with MRI

140

conditional mechanical ventilation (Omni-Vent Series D, Allied Healthcare Products, St.

141

Louis, MO) to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 mm Hg and 45 mm Hg.

142

Stomach tubes were placed after intubation to resolve gaseous distension and prevent re-

143

gurgitation. Venous and arterial catheters were placed percutaneously for drug and fluid

144

administration and blood pressure monitoring. Lactated Ringer’s solution (Abbott Labo-

145

ratories, Abbott Park, IL) was administered intravenously at approximately 10 mL/kg/hr

146

throughout anesthesia. The top of the head was shaved and treated with a depilatory cream

147

for hair removal.

148

Physiological monitoring

149

Serial samples of hematocrit and arterial blood gases were taken from the auricular

150

arterial catheter. Blood gas samples were analyzed immediately on a calibrated blood gas

151

analyzer (i-STAT, Abbott Point of Care, East Windsor, NJ). Pulse oximetry measurements

152

and capnography were performed continuously during anesthesia (Expression MR400,

153

Philips Healthcare, Vantaa, Finland).

154

MR-guided focused ultrasound

155

MR-guided focused ultrasound studies were conducted using a 1024 element, 550 kHz

156

focused ultrasound transducer fitted with a membrane containing chilled, degassed water

157

(ExAblate 2100, Insightec Ltd., Haifa, Israel). The transducer was positioned above the

158

head with degassed ultrasound gel for acoustic coupling (Fig. 2(b)).

159

Acoustic coupling and focal spot location were verified by MR-ARFI in the eleven

160

sheep that underwent transcranial FUS. Figure 2(d) illustrates the MR-ARFI protocol in

161

which FUS was on for 16 ms bursts within a 500 ms window (corresponding to the MR

162

repetition time) over a period of 1.2 min. Each application of MR-ARFI comprised 128

163

FUS bursts. Figure 2(e-g) illustrates neuromodulation protocols, in which FUS was on for

164

200-300 ms bursts every 1 s with continuous wave (Fig. 2(f)) or pulsed (50% duty cycle)

165

ultrasound (Fig. 2(e,g)). Each neuromodulation application comprised 120 (Fig. 2(e)) or

166

600 FUS bursts (Fig. 2(f,g)) over a period of 6 (Fig. 2(e)) or 20 minutes (Fig. 2(f,g)).

167

The protocols applied for each sheep are reported in Fig. 2(a). FUS pulse timing was

168

controlled by Eprime scripts (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA).

169

Multiple MR-ARFI and neuromodulation trials were administered consecutively to

170

investigate the safety of repeated FUS sonications. The within-session timing of FUS

171

application is illustrated in Fig. 3 for each sheep. Applied acoustic powers ranged from

172

127.5-195.5 W for MR-ARFI and 2-34 W for neuromodulation, and are summarized in

173

Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(d), respectively, for each sheep. Neuromodulation acoustic powers

174

were selected to result in at least 5.7 W/cm2 ISP T A in situ, to replicate acoustic intensities

175

applied in a study which reported tissue damage in sheep (Lee et al., 2016c), but to also

176

include a broader intensity range to evaluate potential effects at higher levels.

177

MR-ARFI and neuromodulation were targeted to 1-6 and 1-4 subcortical locations,

178

respectively. The neuromodulation study measured visual evoked potentials using scalp

179

electrodes in response to external stimulation (flashing lights) as well as during focused

180

ultrasound sonication targeted to the visual pathway (lateral geniculate nucleus), the results

181

of which are presented elsewhere (Mohammadjavadi et al., 2019). The lateral geniculate

182

nucleus was a common neuromodulation location for all sheep, with additional focal spots

183

typically located in planes approximately 10, 15, and 20 mm rostral and 10 mm caudal to

184

the lateral geniculate nucleus. The focal pressure half-width was approximately 20 mm in

185

the axial direction and 3.5 mm in the lateral direction. Figure 2(c) shows an example of

186

targeted focal spot locations (sheep 9). The total number of FUS bursts applied to each

187

targeted location are illustrated for MR-ARFI in Fig. 4(g) and for neuromodulation in

188

Fig. 4(h), for each sheep. For the sheep in the repeated and high dose FUS groups, FUS

189

locations were revisited for MR-ARFI and neuromodulation on multiple days. Two sheep

190

had locations that were targeted both for MR-ARFI and neuromodulation on alternate days

191

(two locations for sheep 8 and one location for sheep 9). Additionally, the three sheep in

192

the high dose group each had one location that received MR-ARFI and neuromodulation

193

during the same session. At the conclusion of the study, a high number of consecutive

194

MR-ARFI repetitions were targeted to a single location in the high dose group, bringing

195

the total number of MR-ARFI repetitions to 25, 44, and 70 at a single location (sheep

196

11, 12, and 13, respectively). Target locations were in the left hemisphere for acute and

197

delayed groups, and bilateral for the repeated and high dose FUS groups.

198

MR imaging

199

MR-guided focused ultrasound studies were performed at 3T (Signa Excite, GE Health-

200

care, Milwaukee, WI) using a quadrature head coil. A high resolution T2-weighted se-

201

quence was acquired for treatment planning with 2.5 s repetition time, 72 ms echo time,

202

22 cm isotropic field of view, and 256×192 acquisition matrix. MR-ARFI was performed

203

using a spin echo sequence with repeated bipolar motion encoding gradients, 2DFT read-

204

out, 500 ms repetition time, 39 ms echo time, 20×20×0.7 cm3 field of view, and 256×128

205

acquisition matrix (Bitton et al., 2012). Focused ultrasound application spanned from the

206

second lobe of the first bipolar through the first lobe of the second bipolar motion encod-

207

ing gradient. Images of the focal spot encoded by MR-ARFI were calculated by complex

208

phase difference of two acquisitions with alternating motion encoding gradient polarities.

209

Histopathology and TUNEL

210

Animals were euthanized with a barbiturate overdose of 1 ml per 10 pounds of body

211

weight of euthanasia solution (390 mg/mL pentobarbital and 50 mg/kg phenytoin, Virbac,

212

St Louis, MO). Cardiac arrest was confirmed by auscultation. Skulls were removed via

213

an autopsy saw (Shandon, ThermoFisher Scientific, No. 10000) and brains were extracted

214

and immersion-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 10 days. Following fixa-

215

tion, the entirety of the brain was sectioned at approximately 3 mm intervals in the coronal

216

plane. Brain regions were selected for histologic evaluation based on gross tissue compar-

217

ison to MRI locations of FUS targets. Coronal tissue sections included the FUS target and

218

all tissue dorsal to this region (to evaluate for potential cortical effects from skull heating

219

and any effects within the FUS beam path). Additional tissue sections at distances of +/-

220

3 mm from FUS targets were evaluated histologically (Fig. 2(c)). Tissue sections were

221

also evaluated from contralateral, untreated hemispheres of acute and delayed FUS groups

222

(internal controls). In control sheep, tissue sections were taken from the left and right

223

hemispheres in locations anatomically similar to the FUS group. Formalin-fixed tissues

224

were processed routinely, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with H&E.

225

Slides were blindly reviewed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (KMC). Particular

226

attention was paid to the presence or absence of hemorrhage, as well as pre-mortem tissue

227

responses to damage (i.e., necrosis, red blood cell engulfment (erythrophagocytosis), and

228

intracellular red blood cell breakdown (hemosiderin-laden macrophages)). Additionally,

229

terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)

230

staining (ApopTag kit; Millipore, Temecula, CA) was performed according to manufac-

231

turer’s instruction on tissue sections corresponding to locations receiving the highest num-

232

ber of MR-ARFI repetitions from sheep in the high dose group.

233

Hydrophone measurements

234

Ex vivo skull caps from each sheep were degassed and placed in front of the focused

235

ultrasound transducer array in a tank with degassed water. A fiberoptic hydrophone was

236

positioned at the ultrasound focus to measure peak negative pressure transmitted through

237

each skull cap to obtain an in situ intensity estimate for each acoustic power level applied

238

in vivo (Precision Acoustics, Dorset, UK).

of damage in either macaque (Fig. S1). Specifically evaluated parameters included necro-

247

sis, apoptosis, edema, hemorrhage, inflammation, and neuropil rarefaction. Red blood cell

248

extravasation could not be evaluated as these animals were perfused (i.e., exsanguinated)

249

prior to histologic examination.

250

Sheep study

251

Estimates of in situ ultrasound intensity were obtained based on hydrophone measure-

252

ments of pressure transmitted through each ex vivo skull cap. The acoustic power levels

253

applied during the study corresponded to in situ peak pressure estimates of 1.7-3.6 MPa for

254

MR-ARFI (Fig. 4(b)) and 0.25-0.9 MPa for neuromodulation (Fig. 4(e)), and in situ ISP T A

255

estimates ranging from 5.6-26.5 W/cm2 for MR-ARFI (Fig. 4(c)) and 0.6-13.8 W/cm2 for

256

neuromodulation (Fig. 4(f)).

257

The number of FUS bursts applied to each location are stratified by the estimated

258

in situ peak pressure and intensity of the sonication as shown in Fig. 5 for MR-ARFI

259

and neuromodulation. Observations at multiple locations of the same number of bursts

260

and estimated pressure or intensity are indicated by the color scale. High peak pressure

261

values for MR-ARFI sonications were applied for short durations of 16 ms within the pulse

262

repetition period, resulting in temporal average intensities that were similar to or slightly

263

higher than the neuromodulation ISP T A estimates, despite much lower neuromodulation

264

peak pressures. In all sheep, transcranial FUS was confirmed by visualization of the focal

265

spot by MR-ARFI with targeting to at least one subcortical location (Fig 6).

266

Histopathology

267

Overall, a total of 183 H&E slides of brain tissue from 13 sheep were evaluated for

268

histologic damage. Of these, 128/183 received direct FUS exposure (sampled at the focal

269

spot location and/or 3 mm rostral/caudal), 19/183 were internal controls (i.e., contralateral

270

hemisphere to that which received FUS), and 36/183 were experimental controls (i.e., no

271

FUS to either hemisphere). Overall, no FUS-related pre-mortem histologic findings were

272

noted in any of the examined slides. Figure 7 summarizes the frequency of post-mortem

273

histologic findings across study groups. The presence of each finding is reported for each

274

hemisphere, where green boxes outline hemispheres that received FUS. The color scale

275

represents the percentage of H&E slides that were positive for each histologic feature.

276

Histologic findings were limited to post-mortem red blood cell extravasation (meningeal

277

or parenchymal) following brain extraction. Red blood cell extravasation was never ob-

278

served at the precise sites of FUS targets. When present, parenchymal post-mortem red

279

blood cell extravasations were randomly distributed within tissues distant to the FUS

280

target. The number of incidences (foci) of scattered red blood cell extravasation in the

281

parenchyma was quantified for each tissue section (Fig. 8). Our results suggest the rate

282

of parenchymal red blood cell extravasation did not increase with FUS, but equivalence

283

tests between FUS and control sections were not statistically significant. We performed a

284

cluster-adjusted logistic regression and found the risk of red blood cell extravasation in the

285

meninges is equivalent within +/- 10% with p<0.05 between FUS treated and untreated

286

tissue sections.

287

Acute FUS group

288

Histologically, sheep euthanized less than 24 hours (n=2) following MRI and FUS ex-

289

hibited red blood cell extravasation within the meninges (2/2) as well as rare perivascular

290

red blood cells within neural parenchyma (2/2), regardless of hemispheric location (left vs

291

right) and FUS application (Fig. 9(a,b,h,i)). No concurrent pre-mortem histologic find-

292

ings (i.e., necrosis, red blood cell engulfment (erythrophagocytosis), and intracellular red

293

blood cell breakdown (hemosiderin-laden macrophages)) were noted in areas of red blood

294

cell extravasation. However, acute hemorrhage can be histologically indistinguishable

295

from post-mortem red blood cell extravasation (Finnie, 2016). Thus, a delayed euthana14

296

sia timepoint was established to confirm that red blood cell extravasation was indeed a

297

post-mortem tissue extraction artifact rather than true pre-mortem hemorrhage.

298

Delayed FUS group

299

In order to confirm that extravascular red blood cells seen in the acute FUS group re-

300

flected artifact following post-mortem tissue extraction, a delayed euthanasia timepoint

301

was established (4- to 7-days post-FUS). In general, approximately 2- to 4-days follow-

302

ing meningeal (or subarachnoid) hemorrhage, a normal response to hemorrhage should

303

include erythrophagocytosis, while hemosiderin-laden macrophages are typically seen

304

around 6- to 7-days post-hemorrhage (Finnie, 2016; Rao et al., 2016). In our study, sheep

305

euthanized 96-168 following MRI and FUS exhibited extravascular red blood cells within

306

the meninges (3/3) and rare extravascular red blood cells within neural parenchyma (2/3),

307

regardless of hemispheric location (left vs right) and FUS application (Fig. 9(c,d,j,k)).

308

Furthermore, at 96-168 hours following FUS, there was still no evidence of concurrent

309

histologic abnormalities (such as those listed above) in regions of red blood cell extrava-

310

sation.

311

Repeated FUS group

312

Tissue from sheep treated with FUS over multiple days exhibited extravascular red

313

blood cells within the meninges (3/3) similar to the other groups. Occasional perivascu-

314

lar red blood cells were observed bilaterally within the neural parenchyma for one sheep

315

(sheep 10; Fig. 9(e,l)). No other concurrent pre-mortem histologic findings (i.e., necrosis,

316

macrophage infiltration, red blood cell engulfment (erythrophagocytosis), and intracellular

317

red blood cell breakdown (hemosiderin-laden macrophages)) were observed.

318

High dose FUS group

319

Sheep in the high dose group received prolonged consecutive MR-ARFI sonication to

320

a single location on the last day of study, with the total number of MR-ARFI applications

321

at the high dose location (25, 44, and 70 repetitions for sheep 11, 12, and 13, respectively)

322

greatly exceeding the highest number of repetitions applied within the other FUS groups

323

(8 repetitions for sheep 10). Neuromodulation sonications were similar to those applied

324

in the other FUS groups. As with sheep in other groups, extravascular red blood cells

325

were noted in the meninges (3/3) and rarely in parenchyma (3/3) (Fig. 9(f,m)). No other

326

histologic findings accompanied extravascular red blood cells. Additionally, no histologic

327

findings were observed at the high dose location or other locations targeted with FUS in

328

any sheep. TUNEL results confirm no evidence of apoptosis at the high dose location for

329

all three sheep (Fig. S2).

330

Control group

331

Control animals that only underwent the MRI procedure (i.e., no FUS) also exhibited

332

red blood cell extravasation within the meninges (2/2) and rarely within neural parenchyma

333

(2/2) (Fig. 9(g,n)). As with sheep that underwent FUS, no evidence of concurrent pre-

334

mortem histologic findings (i.e., necrosis, macrophage infiltration, red blood cell engulf-

335

ment (erythrophagocytosis), and intracellular red blood cell breakdown (hemosiderin-

336

laden macrophages)) was observed in areas of red blood cell extravasation.

337

Discussion

338

The results of this study suggest that the transcranial MR-ARFI and neuromodulation

339

FUS protocols evaluated did not result in histologic tissue damage. No histologic ab-

340

normalities were observed at the site of FUS targets in either rhesus macaques or sheep,

16

341

although post-mortem parenchymal red blood cell extravasation was observed in other

342

brain regions of sheep tissue sections (i.e., away from the focal spot).

343

Histologic findings were similar in both FUS treated and untreated hemispheres, as

344

well as in control groups. Tissue sections from all sheep exhibited red blood cell ex-

345

travasation in the meninges regardless of FUS application, treated hemisphere, or survival

346

time (Fig 7). Through the process of post-mortem skull removal, meningeal blood ves-

347

sels (e.g., dural) are frequently ruptured resulting in the observed meningeal red blood

348

cell extravasation. Furthermore, vibrations during extraction are strong enough to result

349

in rare extravasations of red blood cells from parenchymal vessels. Multiple sections from

350

both FUS (treated and untreated hemispheres) and control groups exhibited perivascular

351

red blood cell extravasation in cortical tissue regions separate from those identified as

352

FUS targets (Fig 8). No macrophage infiltration, erythrophagocytosis, hemosiderin-laden

353

macrophages, tissue necrosis, or other indicators of tissue reactivity to damage were ob-

354

served (Fig. 7), confirming post-mortem artifact.

355

Selecting appropriate euthanasia time points is crucial to interpreting histologic find-

356

ings. At time points less than 24 hours, true small volume hemorrhage can be indis-

357

tinguishable from tissue damage incurred during post-mortem brain extraction (Maxie,

358

2007). Following 72 hours, true pre-mortem hemorrhage should exhibit concurrent macrophage

359

infiltration, erythrophagocytosis, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Rao et al., 2016).

360

The absence of this expected tissue reactivity within our sheep cohort confirm that meningeal

361

and extravascular red blood cells seen across both hemispheres and experimental groups

362

were artifact due to post-mortem tissue extraction.

363

We evaluated in situ intensities similar to and slightly higher than previously reported

364

ISP T A values of up to 4.4 W/cm2 in humans, 9.5 W/cm2 in macaques, and 6.7 W/cm2 in

365

sheep (Lee et al., 2016a; Verhagen et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2016c). The study in sheep

366

reported microhemorrhage on H&E-stained tissue following 500 or more bursts of neu17

367

romodulation (300 ms long burst duration repeated in 1 second intervals at 50% duty

368

cycle) at 3.3-5.7 W/cm2 , but not at 6.7 W/cm2 ISP T A . Of fifteen publications assessing

369

histology after neuromodulation, this was the only one to report abnormal findings, as

370

summarized in a recent review of the ultrasound neuromodulation literature (Blackmore

371

et al., 2019). However, because these foci of microhemorrhage were identified 4-64 days

372

following treatment, with an absence of concurrent parenchymal reaction, we speculate

373

that this finding may in fact be a post-mortem artifact.

374

In our study, repeated FUS neuromodulation and MR-ARFI sonications to the same fo-

375

cal spot location, either within one session or on multiple days, at various intensity levels,

376

were not accompanied by histologic damage. We evaluated histology following a similar

377

neuromodulation FUS protocol as Lee et al. In macaques, there was no tissue damage fol-

378

lowing 500 bursts at tissue locations receiving intensities of 0.4, 1.6, 6.4, and 25.8 W/cm2

379

ISP T A . Sonications of between 240 and 4800 bursts per location at intensity levels ranging

380

from 0.6 and 13.8 W/cm2 ISP T A did not result in pre-mortem damage in sheep. Further-

381

more, we evaluated histology from locations receiving between 128 and 8192 MR-ARFI

382

bursts at a given intensity level, ranging from 5.6 and 26.5 W/cm2 ISP T A , and found no

383

pre-mortem damage from either H&E- or TUNEL-stained tissue. One limitation of this

384

study is that we did not detect tissue damage with either MR-ARFI or neuromodulation

385

FUS.

386

Skull bone absorbs and dephases ultrasound which introduces a risk of cortical heat-

387

ing, and has been demonstrated to contribute to variations in FUS treatment across pa-

388

tients (Vyas et al., 2016). In our study, hydrophone measurements through ex vivo sheep

389

skull caps resulted in a range of estimated in situ intensities, even when similar acoustic

390

power levels were applied (Fig 4). Particular attention has been paid to thermal rise during

391

neuromodulation, and a recent retrospective study has reported a simulated cortical tem-

392

perature rise of 7◦ C caused by skull heating during preclinical neuromodulation (Constans

393

et al., 2018). Several contemporary neuromodulation studies in humans have included

394

assessments that no significant temperature rise in the brain is expected from skull heat-

395

ing with their protocols (Legon et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2016; Ai et al., 2018; Legon

396

et al., 2018a; Verhagen et al., 2019; Attali et al., 2019). We did not observe signs of cor-

397

tical tissue damage due to skull heating in the rhesus macaque or sheep studies. Prior to

398

treatment, simulations could be used to optimize FUS parameters to achieve a desired in

399

situ intensity, and reduce the risk of tissue heating near bone (Mueller et al., 2016, 2017;

400

Constans et al., 2018).

401

Conclusions

402

The transcranial focused ultrasound protocols and equipment tested here did not result

403

in pre-mortem tissue damage in rhesus macaques or sheep. Our study examined a range of

404

experimental parameters including number of focal spot locations, number of FUS bursts

405

applied to each spot, timing between FUS sessions, and applied acoustic intensity, ex-

406

ceeding the levels previously evaluated in other studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that

407

extravascular red blood cells may occur in extracted tissue whether or not focused ultra-

408

sound is applied. Results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate euthanasia

409

timepoints and including experimental controls when interpreting histologic findings.

Figure 1: Summary of rhesus macaque study parameters. (a) Inclusion characteristics, survival time, and
number of histologic samples evaluated for left (L) and right (R) hemispheres. (b) Illustration of rhesus
macaque transducer positioning and (c) grid of focused ultrasound sonication in the visual cortex, where
each location corresponds to estimated in situ spatial peak-temporal average intensity (ISP T A ) values of 0.4,
1.6, 6.4, and 25.8 W/cm2 , applied in short bursts. Vertical spacing between FUS targets was 10 mm (NHP-1)
and 15 mm (NHP-2), and horizontal spacing was 15 mm (NHP-1) and 20 mm (NHP-2). The lower two target
locations (1.6 and 25.8 W/cm2 ISP T A ) were placed 2 mm above the inion. Three coronal histologic sections
were obtained from each hemisphere of the visual cortex (approximate locations shown by red planes). The
first histology plane was located near the cortical surface, the second at a depth of approximately 4 mm, and
the third at a depth of approximately 20 mm. (d) Illustration of neuromodulation protocol comprising 500
FUS bursts.

Figure 2: Summary of sheep study parameters. (a) Sheep inclusion characteristics. The two sheep in the
control group underwent MRI and anesthesia but no FUS. The eleven sheep that underwent FUS were
subdivided into acute (euthanized zero days after FUS study), delayed (euthanized four to seven days after
FUS study), repeated (underwent multiple FUS sessions, and euthanized four days after the last FUS study),
and high dose groups (underwent prolonged MR-ARFI applications at one location on the last day of study).
Days of survival following the first (left-most) and subsequent days of study are reported in split columns
where applicable, for MRI without FUS (unshaded cells) and MRI with FUS sessions (shaded cells). The
number of evaluated histologic sections is directly related to the number of FUS targets per sheep. (b) Sheep
transducer positioning and (c) exemplary focused ultrasound sonication locations (6 locations shown; red
circles) shown on axial T2-weighted MRI (cropped to show detail). Histologic sections were obtained from
each location targeted with focused ultrasound and additionally from planes approximately 3 mm rostral
and caudal to targeted locations (18 sections shown; dashed lines). Illustration of (d) MR-ARFI focal spot
localization and (e-g) neuromodulation FUS protocols. Protocols comprised (d) 128, (e) 120 and (f-g) 600
FUS bursts.

Figure 3: In vivo sheep study parameters. FUS applied acoustic power over time for each animal. Timing
spans the total MRI and FUS session. Each cell represents a one minute interval, with color coding to
indicate non-zero FUS acoustic powers. Empty cells indicate no FUS.

Figure 4: In vivo sheep study parameters. (a,d) Range of applied acoustic powers and estimated in situ (b,e)
peak pressure and (c,f) spatial peak temporal average intensity for MR-ARFI and neuromodulation, respectively. Total number of FUS bursts applied to each (g) MR-ARFI and (h) neuromodulation location, where
animal number is reported below each bar cluster. Individual bars represent unique sonication locations, and
bar height indicates number of FUS bursts delivered to that location.

Figure 5: Distribution of the number of FUS bursts applied to each location with respect to the estimated in
situ (a) peak pressure and (b) intensity of each sonication. MR-ARFI sonications (circles) were estimated
to have in situ peak pressure between 1.7 and 3.6 MPa, which, due to the short 16 ms sonication times, corresponded to between 5.6 and 26.5 W/cm2 ISP T A . Neuromodulation sonications (triangles) were estimated
to have peak in situ pressure between 0.25 and 0.9 MPa, corresponding to 0.6 and 13.8 W/cm2 ISP T A . The
color scale indicates the number of locations at which each combination of in situ pressure or intensity and
number of FUS bursts was observed. Blue rectangles indicate the range of parameters reported in human
neuromodulation studies.

Figure 6: Focal spot targeting and visualization. (a) Prescribed focal spot is indicated by red cross hairs
drawn on T2-weighted MRI. (b) Tissue displacement at the focal spot is shown as an overlay on the MRARFI magnitude image. Stray pixels in the displacement map outside the brain are artifact due to slight
changes between two MR-ARFI acquisitions.

Figure 7: Prevalence of histologic findings within in vivo sheep study. The percentage of sections in which
histologic findings were observed are reported for each animal by hemisphere (L and R; animal number
listed at the top of each column). The number of histologic sections evaluated are reproduced from Fig. 2(a)
for convenience. Green boxes indicate hemispheres where focused ultrasound was applied (all other boxes
are internal controls or experimental controls). Meningeal and rare perivascular red blood cell extravasation
were common histologic findings across all study groups, independent of whether any FUS was applied or
which hemisphere was sonicated (in the case of FUS application). Necrosis, macrophage infiltration, red
blood cell engulfment (erythrophagocytosis), and intracellular red blood cell breakdown (hemosiderin-laden
macrophages), which would be expected to accompany true pre-mortem tissue damage, were not observed.

Figure 8: Summary of parenchymal red blood cell extravasation foci in H&E-stained sheep brain tissue
slides. The number of foci per slide are shown for tissue taken from hemispheres without FUS (blue dots)
and hemispheres with FUS (yellow dots) for each study group where applicable. Bars indicate mean and
standard error.

Figure 9: Post-mortem perivascular and meningeal red blood cell extravasation does not differ across sheep
treatment groups. Randomly scattered small volumes of extravasated red blood cells (black arrows) were
identified adjacent to blood vessels within the neural parenchyma (a-g) and throughout the meninges (h-n)
regardless of ultrasound exposure. Black outlines indicate blood vessel walls and delineate intravascular
from extravascular red blood cells. No red blood cell extravasation was observed at parenchymal locations targeted with FUS. No associated pre-mortem tissue reactions (i.e., red blood cell engulfment (erythrophagocytosis), red blood cell breakdown (hemosiderosis), necrosis, or edema) were identified in any of
the examined sections. Hematoxylin and eosin, scale bar = 50 µm.

Figure S1: Histologic findings within in vivo NHP study. No histologic lesions were identified in NHP-1 (ad) or NHP-2 (e-h). Representative normal cortical tissue is shown from FUS targeted regions corresponding
to those shown in Figure 1. Hematoxylin and eosin, scale bar = 50 µm.

Figure S2: TUNEL staining in sheep in the high dose FUS group. Sheep 11 (a), 12 (b), and 13 (c) were
TUNEL-negative at the targeted site of prolonged MR-ARFI repetitions. Figure d demonstrates apoptotic
dark-brown, nuclear TUNEL-positivity (arrows) within the small intestinal epithelium of mice having undergone irradiation. TUNEL, scale bar = 50 µm.
