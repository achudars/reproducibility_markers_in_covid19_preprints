Abstract:

32

Graded Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling emanating from notochord and floorplate patterns

33

the early neural tube. Soon thereafter, Shh signaling strength within the ventricular zone

34

becomes dis-contiguous and discontinuous along the ventral to dorsal axis suggesting a

35

distribution of Shh that cannot be achieved by diffusion alone. Here we discover that

36

sequential activation of Shh expression by ventricular zone derivatives is critical for

37

counteracting a precocious exhaustion of the Olig2 precursor cell population of the pMN

38

domain at the end of motor neuron genesis and during the subsequent phase of ventral

39

oligodendrocyte precursor production. Selective expression of Shh by motor neurons of the

40

lateral motor column at the beginning of oligodendrogenesis ensures a more yielding pMN

41

domain at limb levels compared to thoracic levels. Thus, patterned expression of Shh by

42

ventricular zone derivatives including earlier born neurons contributes to the scaling of the

43

spinal cord along the anterior - posterior axis by regulating the activity of a select

44

ventricular zone precursor domain at later stages of development.

Introduction:

55

The “Bauplan”, or body plan, of vertebrates can be recognized among members of the same

56

species and across phyla despite significant differences in the absolute size of individuals of the

57

same species or the form of different species. Chiefly responsible for our ability to recognize the

58

common features of a body plan is the proportionate differentiation and growth of the constituent

59

parts of an organism irrespective of absolute size. How developmental processes maintain a

60

constant ratio of physical pattern features with changing size, a property known as scale

61

invariance, is not completely understood (Huang and Umulis 2018).

62
63

Successful development is dependent on highly stereotyped series of inductive events that result

64

in the determination of progressively increasing numbers of cell fates within rapidly growing

65

tissues. Ensuring scale invariance could be achieved by mechanisms that are distinct from cell

66

fate determination processes and could act at different developmental stages (Barkai and Ben-Zvi

67

2009, Umulis and Othmer 2013). Alternatively, patterning mechanisms themselves could be

68

modified to generate a size-invariant output (Kicheva and Briscoe 2015). Cell fate determination

69

is governed by a handful of cell signaling factors termed morphogens that are secreted from

70

spatial fix-points in the developing embryo and form gradients of activity across a developmental

71

field (Lander 2007). Morphogen signaling induces distinct transcriptional programs in naïve

72

precursor cells dependent on signaling thresholds that are determined by signal strength and

73

duration (Kicheva, Bollenbach et al. 2014). Experimental and theoretical studies revealed several

74

mechanisms by which morphogen signaling can be scaled to embryo size (Gregor, Bialek et al.

75

2005, Houchmandzadeh, Wieschaus et al. 2005, Howard and ten Wolde 2005, McHale, Rappel

76

et al. 2006, Ben-Zvi and Barkai 2010, Cheung, Miles et al. 2014, Uygur, Young et al. 2016). The

77

commonality of these studies is that they define mechanisms of scale invariance across embryos

78

during early stages of development. However, scaling occurs within the same embryo and

79

throughout development as different body parts reveal proportionate changes in size regardless

80

of when they are specified during development. How is proportionality ensured across

81

developmental stages within the same embryo?

82
83

We have explored this question in the context of the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in

84

the developing neural tube. The spinal cord is a tube-like structure with enlargements at

85

segmental levels that provide control of, and receive proprioceptive information from, limbs. The

86

larger spinal cord at brachial (forelimb) and lumbar (hindlimb) levels compared to thoracic levels

87

is chiefly the result of the presence of a greater number of motor neurons (MNs) that sub serve

88

limb musculature, and correspondingly larger numbers of interneurons and glial cells (Bjugn and

89

Gundersen 1993, Dasen 2017). Since the basic patterning and structure of the spinal cord is

90

highly similar along the neuraxis, the difference in size between limb levels and thoracic

91

segments allows comparative studies that might reveal mechanisms involved in scale invariance.

92

MNs are among the very first neurons in the developing neural tube whose fate becomes

93

specified while most interneurons and all types of glia develop later (Jessell 2000). Whether and

94

how the earlier production of neurons plays a role in the proportionate differentiation of

95

subsequent cell types is not well understood. MNs and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)

96

emerge subsequently from the same domain, the “pMN” domain, within the ventricular zone of

97

the developing spinal tube (Bergles and Richardson 2015, Traiffort, Zakaria et al. 2016)

98

suggesting that cell-autonomous as well as cell non-autonomous mechanisms could be involved

99

in the sequential and proportionate differentiation of MNs and OPCs (Traiffort, Zakaria et al.

100

2016). The elucidation of the molecular control mechanisms that determine the precise “switch”

101

from neurogenesis to gliogenesis of the pMN domain and the segment-specific yield of the pMN

102

domain have been hampered by a scarcity of cell type selective- and temporally- specific genetic

103

tools to dissect MN and OPC production within the pMN domain. Despite these difficulties,

104

studies have implicated the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in regulating both, MN and OPC

105

production (Briscoe and Ericson 1999, Traiffort, Zakaria et al. 2016).

106
107

Shh plays a critical role in MN and OPC differentiation at several developmental stages. First,

108

graded Shh signaling originating from the notochord induces distinct transcriptional programs in

109

overlying naïve neural ectoderm cells in a concentration-dependent manner that leads to the

110

establishment of molecularly distinct precursor domains along the ventral to dorsal axis of the

111

developing neural tube (Dessaud, McMahon et al. 2008, Alaynick, Jessell et al. 2011, Yu,

112

McGlynn et al. 2013),. The transcription factors activated by Shh are responsible for determining

113

the cell fates in the derivatives of these precursor domains. Thus, Olig2 expression marks MN

114

precursors, (pMN) (Mizuguchi, Sugimori et al. 2001, Novitch, Chen et al. 2001), Nkx2.2

115

expression marks the more ventral V3 interneuron progenitors (p3), and Dbx1 is expressed in the

116

p0 domain located at the equator of the neural tube leading to interneurons situated dorsal to

117

MNs (Briscoe, Pierani et al. 2000). Subsequently, persistent Shh signaling originating from the

118

medial floorplate (MFP) located at the ventral midline of the developing neural tube is critical

119

for maintaining the identities of each of these domains throughout neurogenesis (Dessaud, Ribes

120

et al. 2010). The ventral neural tube expands rapidly during neurogenesis and Shh signaling

121

strength measured by expression levels of Shh target genes declines progressively within the

122

precursor domains (Balaskas, Ribeiro et al. 2012, Kicheva, Bollenbach et al. 2014). Surprisingly,

123

the beginning of oligodendrogenesis is marked by increased Shh signaling strength within the

124

pMN domain (Danesin, Agius et al. 2006). How this dynamic increase in Shh signaling is

125

achieved subsequently to a decline in Shh signaling strength and whether it is of functional

126

importance for OPC specification and production is an area of active research (Traiffort, Zakaria

127

et al. 2016). Since the Shh gradient emanating from the MFP displays a constant decay length

128

and does not scale with congruent and rapid growth during early development (Cohen, Kicheva

129

et al. 2015), its influence on pMN domain activity must likely wane during neurogenesis.

130

Accordingly, multiple adaptation mechanisms have been proposed to underlie temporally

131

dynamic Shh signaling at the time of initiation of OPC production (Traiffort, Zakaria et al.

132

2016). One such mechanism is the accumulative storage of Shh in the extracellular matrix

133

followed by Sulfatase 1 dependent release leading to a greater concentration of Shh than could

134

be achieved by continuous production and diffusion (Danesin, Agius et al. 2006, Touahri,

135

Escalas et al. 2012, Al Oustah, Danesin et al. 2014). While the genetic ablation of Sulfatase 1

136

curtails the production of OPCs, the current experiments cannot exclude the possibility that other

137

signaling factors than Shh are released from the extracellular matrix by Sulfatase 1 and then

138

participate in the regulation of OPC production. Another mechanism might be the sequential

139

production of Shh by previously specified ventricular zone derivatives (VZD). Prominent

140

sources of VZDShh are the lateral floorplate (LFPShh) (Charrier, Lapointe et al. 2002, Park, Shin et

141

al. 2004, Al Oustah, Danesin et al. 2014), which is constituted by cells emigrating from the p3

142

domain, and MNs (MNShh) (Oppenheim, Homma et al. 1999, Akazawa, Tsuzuki et al. 2004). The

143

selective ablation of Shh from LFP or MNs without impacting earlier patterning of the spinal

144

cord has not been achieved and causal evidence for the involvement of LFPShh and MNShh in the

145

regulation of OPC generation is therefore lacking.

146

Here we produced a series of mouse lines with different degrees and tissue selectivity of

147

conditional Shh gene ablation from the MFP, LFP, and MNs during spinal cord development.

148

We find that VZDShh is critical for the maintenance of the Olig2 expressing cell population in the

149

pMN domain during the phase of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production. While early

150

neural tube patterning and MN development can proceed successfully in the absence of these

151

Shh sources, the pMN domain exhausts of Olig2 expressing cells during neurogenesis leading to

152

a subsequent and spinal level specific reduction in OPC production. LFPShh is needed for OPC

153

production throughout the spinal neuraxis. In contrast, MNShh, which occurs earlier at limb levels

154

than thoracic levels, is critical for maintaining a larger pMN domain at limb levels compared to

155

thoracic segments throughout OPC production. Our data provides causal evidence for the critical

156

involvement of sequential and spinal level restricted expression of Shh by VZD for scaling of

157

OPC production along the neuraxis.

Results:

170

Shh expression in the ventral spinal cord

171

To examine the contributions of different sources of Shh in the ventral spinal cord to

172

pMN domain activity at the time of the transition from MN to OPC production we first expanded

173

on previous descriptions of Shh expression during spinal cord development. We used a gene

174

expression tracer and conditional loss of function allele of Shh (Shh-nLZC/C, abbreviated ShhC/C)

175

in which a bicistronic mRNA is transcribed from the un-recombined Shh locus that encodes Shh

176

and nuclear targeted LacZ (Gonzalez-Reyes, Verbitsky et al. 2012). The allele allows the

177

quantification of the numbers of cells that express Shh and the determination of Shh ablation

178

efficiencies in response to Cre activity with single-cell resolution. This approach reveals

179

developmental stage- and spinal level- specific patterns of Shh expression and relative

180

contributions to ventral Shh production from at least 4 distinct cell populations. At brachial

181

levels at E12.5 we find Shh in all cells of the MFP (defined by co-expression with FoxA2 and

182

situated at the ventral midline stacking 4-5 cells high along the ventral to dorsal axis), LFP

183

(defined by reduced levels of FoxA2 and Shh compared to MFP, situated immediately dorsal to

184

the MFP and stacking about 3-4 cells high along the ventral to dorsal axis), LFP* (defined by co-

185

expression of Nkx2.2 and Shh and situated in part at the lateral edges of the LFP and in part as

186

isolated cells flanking the p3 domain), and in 30% of all motor neurons (MNs) of the lateral

187

motor column (LMC, defined by co-expression with Hb9 and lateral position in the ventral

188

horns) (Fig. 1). In contrast, at thoracic and lumbar levels at E12.5, we find Shh expression only

189

in MFP, LFP*, and LFP (Fig. 1). Based on numbers of nLacZ+ cells present at E12.5 we

190

estimate that about 57% of Shh production occurs by MFP, 30% by the collective LFP and 13%

191

by MNs at brachial levels while about 50% of Shh production occurs each by MFP and LFP at

192

thoracic and lumbar levels (Fig. 1B). The onset of Shh expression in these tissues is sequential

193

and overlaps with both MN and OPC production (Fig. 1C), suggesting the possibility to dissect

194

each source’s Shh contribution to pMN activity.

195

At E13.5 lumbar LMC MNs begin to express Shh resulting in a pattern of expression that

196

is qualitatively similar to brachial levels at E12.5 (Fig. S2A). By E14.5 medial motor column

197

(MMC) MNs at all spinal segments begin to express Shh (Fig. S1A). At P20 Shh expression

198

occurs in MNs, V0 cholinergic neurons, and remaining FP cells at all spinal cord segments (Fig.

199

S1B and S2C). We observe a similar temporal and segmental pattern of Shh expression in the

200

developing chick spinal cord (Fig. S1C).

201

To investigate the role of Shh signaling from these Shh sources onto the pMN domain,

202

we generated a series of mouse lines with conditional and in part overlapping ablation of Shh.

203

We used ChAT-Cre (ChATShh-/- ) to target MNs, Nestin-Cre (NestinShh-/- ) to target all Shh

204

expressing VZD (MNs, LFP, and LFP*), and Olig2-Cre (Olig2Shh-/-), to target MNs, LFP, and

205

MFP.

206

At E12.5 we did not observe Shh recombination in MFP cells in ChATShh-/- mutants.

207

NestinShh-/- mutants had a few MFP cells which displayed Cre activity, but this ablation was

208

insignificant (Fig. 1D and 1G). However, in Olig2Shh-/- mutants the Shh recombination

209

efficiency among MFP cells in brachial and thoracic spinal segments revealed a significant

210

~44% and ~39% loss resp. (Fig. 1D and 1G). We found no recombination of Shh in the LFP or

211

LFP* in ChATShh-/- at brachial or thoracic segments (Fig. 1D, E, H). Consistent with the

212

previous reported expression of Nestin-Cre in all VZD between E10.5 to E12.5 (Kramer et al.,

213

2006), and transient expression of Olig2-Cre in all VZD of the pMN domain and ventral to it

214

(Ribes and Briscoe, 2009), we find near complete (~80%, and ~90% resp.) ablation of Shh from

215

the LFP and LFP* in both NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- in brachial segments (Fig. 1D, E, H). At

216

thoracic segments LFP recombination was less efficient at ~60% and ~72% for NestinShh-/- and

217

Olig2Shh-/- resp. LFP* recombination was ~77% and ~94% for NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- resp.

218

(Fig. 1D, E, H). Cre efficiency in MNs was about 80% in ChATShh-/- and NestinShh-/- mutants,

219

and 98% for Olig2Shh-/- (Fig. 1F and 1G). The location of Shh expression and the varied degrees

220

of ablation of Shh at E12.5 are schematically summarized in Fig. 1J.

221

Using a conditional reporter allele (Fig. 2A), we find that Olig2-Cre but not Nestin-Cre is

222

active in the MFP prior to notochord (NC) regression at E10.5 resulting in the ablation of Shh

223

from 46 ± 5.1% and 8.5± 2.8% resp. of FoxA2+ cells (Fig. 2B and 2C). These results reveal that

224

the degree of ablation of Shh from MFP in NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- animals is established at

225

the time of MN production and remains fixed. The drastic loss of Shh expression in the MFP

226

already at E10.5 in Olig2Shh-/- animals prompted us to ascertain a possible patterning defect along

227

the ventral midline. Consistent with previous reports that Shh expression by the notochord (NC)

228

is sufficient for the establishment of precursor domains in the ventral spinal cord (Dessaud,

229

Ribes et al. 2010, Yu, McGlynn et al. 2013) we find that the relative location and size of the p3-

230

(Nkx2.2), pMN- (Olig2) and p0- (Dbx1) domains, and the location of the ventral border of the

231

Pax6 expression domain are indistinguishable between Olig2Shh-/- and control at E10.5 (Fig. 2D

232

and 2E).

233

Together, the varied degrees of quantifiable and source selective ablation of Shh from the

234

ventral spinal cord and the preservation of early ventral tube patterning indicated that this set of

235

recombinant mouse lines might be informative in the investigation of the effect of VZD sources

236

of Shh onto the pMN domain during MN and OPC generation.

239

Shh signaling from MFP, but not VZD sources influences MN generation
We investigated whether ablating Shh from VZD sources would impact the generation of

240

MNs from Olig2 precursors of the pMN domain. We analyzed columnar pattern, relative

241

distribution of MNs among columns, and absolute numbers of MNs of different columnar

242

identity at brachial and thoracic levels. We first visualized MN columnar organization by

243

immunostainings for MMC (Hb9+ Lhx3+), LMCM (Hb9+ Isl1/2+), and LMCL (Hb9+, Isl1/2-,

244

Lhx3-) at brachial (Fig. 3A) and MMC (Hb9+, Isl1-), HMC (Hb9+, Isl1/2+), and PGC (Hb9-,

245

nNos+) at thoracic (Fig. 3E) and found no apparent differences in the staining pattern either

246

among ChATShh-/- , NestinShh-/- , Olig2Shh+/- ,or Olig2Shh-/- compared to ShhC/C controls. Further

247

supporting unaffected MN positioning and patterning, we find inconspicuous ventral root

248

formation in Olig2Shh-/- compared to ShhC/C controls at E10.5 and E12.5. (Fig. S3).

249

Quantification of MN numbers revealed no differences in ChATShh-/- and NestinShh-/-

250

compared to ShhC/C controls at brachial and thoracic levels. In contrast, in Olig2Shh+/- and

251

Olig2Shh-/- we find a 22% and 38%, resp. reduction in the numbers of total MNs at brachial (Fig.

252

3B), and 22% and 32% at thoracic levels compared to ShhC/C controls (Fig. 3F). Since the

253

production of late born MNs could be affected to a greater extent than early born MNs by the

254

ablation of Shh from previously born VZD, we compared the relative size of the MN columns

255

and the numbers of late born MNs just emerging from the ventricular zone at E12.5. We found

256

that MNs attained columnar identities in normal relative proportions in all genotypes (Fig. 3D

257

and 3H). However, quantification of migrating late born Hb9+ MNs showed a dose-dependent

258

reduction of ~10% in Olig2Shh+/- and 47% in Olig2Shh-/- in brachial, and 23% and 47% resp. in

259

thoracic segments, suggesting that the deficit in MN generation that we observe in Olig2Shh+/- and

260

Olig2Shh-/- mice is greatest towards the end of MN production (Fig. 3I). We did not observe a

11

261

decrease in numbers of late born migrating MNs in ChATShh-/- or NestinShh-/-. We next examined

262

if the earlier deficits in MN generation in Olig2Shh-/- mice could be overcome by reduced

263

apoptosis during the phase of programmed cell death. To this end, we found reduced levels of

264

Caspase3+ Hb9+ brachial MNs in Olig2Shh-/- at E12.5 indicating that reduced cell death of MNs

265

at least in part will compensate for a reduced rate of MN production in Olig2Shh-/- animals (Fig.

266

3J).

267

We associated the degree of reduction in the numbers of MNs with the tissue specific

268

efficiency of Shh ablation in ChATShh-/-, NestinShh-/-, and Olig2Shh-/- (Fig. 3K). The 80% efficient

269

ablation of Shh from MNs at brachial levels as well as the near complete ablation of Shh from

270

the LFP in NestinShh-/-, has no effect on MN numbers at E12.5. In contrast, the near complete

271

ablation of Shh from MNs, LFP and about 50% of MFP in Olig2Shh-/- results in a Shh dose-

272

dependent reduction of MN numbers at all levels and in all MN columns (Fig. 3K, orange line).

273

Together these results reveal that MN differentiation can proceed in the absence of Shh signaling

274

from the ventricular zone derivatives MN and LFP, but the efficacy of MN generation becomes

275

progressively impacted by dose-dependent reductions in Shh signaling from the MFP.

276
277

Shh from VZD sources in addition to MFP is critical for pMN domain maintenance during

278

the onset of gliogenesis in a spinal level specific manner.

279

Previous studies did not evaluate the contribution from individual Shh sources for the

280

maintenance of established precursor domains after NC retraction. We therefore next

281

investigated ventricular zone organization and precursor domain maintenance in ChATShh-/-,

282

NestinShh-/-, and Olig2Shh-/-. We find that the relative location and distance to each other of the p3,

283

pMN, and p0 precursor domains are preserved in ChATShh-/-, NestinShh-/-, and Olig2Shh-/- at E12.5

284

(Fig. 4A). However, we observe a Shh source and dose-dependent, spinal level-specific decline

285

in the numbers of Olig2+ cells in the pMN domain of ChATShh-/-, Olig2Shh+/-, NestinShh-/-, and

286

Olig2Shh-/- compared to ShhC/C or Olig2-Cre control (Fig. 4B and 4C).

287

In ChATShh-/- we find a 26% decrease in pMN/Olig2+ cells (pMNOlig2+) at brachial levels

288

(but not at thoracic or lumbar) consistent with expression of Shh in MNs at brachial but not yet

289

in MNs at thoracic and lumbar levels which will begin to express Shh about one day later (Fig.

290

4C). Upon more detailed analysis, we find the effect of MN Shh to become progressively more

291

pronounced during the rapid enlargement of the pMN that occurs at brachial segments between

292

E12.5 to E12.75 (Fig. 4D and 4E). The numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells in NestinShh-/- displays an

293

anterior-posterior progressive decrease of 40% at brachial, 51% at thoracic, and 59% at lumbar

294

segments (Fig. 4B and 4C). The most severely affected genotype is Olig2Shh-/- with a decrease in

295

pMNOlig2+ cells of 66% at brachial, 61% at thoracic, and 72% at lumbar (Fig. 4B and 4C).

296

We next associated the degree of reduction in the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells at brachial

297

and thoracic levels with the time of onset and tissue specific efficiency of Shh ablation in

298

ChATShh-/-, Olig2Shh-/-, and NestinShh-/- (Fig. 4F). In controls, we find about 19% more pMNOlig2+

299

cells at brachial than thoracic segments. The 80% efficient ablation of Shh from MNs in

300

ChATShh-/- reduces the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells at brachial levels to those present in controls

301

at thoracic levels while the ablation of Shh from MNs has no effect on the numbers of pMNOlig2+

302

cells at thoracic levels (Fig. 4F, red line). NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- exhibit near complete

303

ablation of Shh from MNs and LFP, but significantly different ablation efficiencies in the MFP,

304

resulting in a reduction of pMNOlig2+ cells at brachial levels that scales with the degree of Shh

305

ablation from the MFP. At thoracic levels, however, we find the same magnitude in the reduction

306

of the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells in NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- despite of a much greater total

307

reduction in numbers of Shh producing cells by Olig2-Cre compared to Nestin-Cre. This

308

observation suggests that Shh produced by LFP cells, though few in number, has a

309

disproportionate significance compared to MFP derived Shh for pMNOlig2+ cells at thoracic

310

segments.

311

Next, we determined if the decreased numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells is the result of

312

diminished initial specification or a failure of maintenance. We lineage traced Olig2 cells in

313

Olig2Shh-/- mutants, Olig2Shh+/- controls, and Olig2-Cre controls using the R26mT/mG reporter

314

allele from which myristylated GFP is expressed in all derivatives of Olig2 expressing cells and

315

immunostained for Olig2 at E12.5 (Fig. 5A). We observe GFP expression in the ventral spinal

316

cord forming a dorsal boundary at a similar relative distance to the MFP in mutants and controls

317

but a decline in pMNOlig2+ GFP+ double positive cells in mutants compared to controls. Notably,

318

the absence of Olig2 expressing cells within the GFP labeled area in mutants is most pronounced

319

in the dorsal half of the pMN domain. Together, these results demonstrate that ongoing Shh

320

signaling originating from VZD in addition to MFP are critical for the selective maintenance of

321

pMNOlig2+ cells once the influence of notochord Shh has waned and the pMN switches to

322

gliogenesis of OPCs.

323

Providing further evidence for decreased pMN domain activity at the beginning of OPC

324

production at E12.5 we find a ~3-fold reduction in the size of p* precursor domain in Olig2Shh-/-

325

compared to controls (Fig. 5B and 5C). The p* domain forms at the ventral border of the pMN

326

domain and is marked by Olig2+/Nkx2.2+ cells (Agius et al., 2004). Interestingly, we found

327

LFP* cells (which we define as Nkx2.2+ nLacZ+ cells) in direct contact with Nkx2.2+ Olig2+

328

double positive cells of the p* domain in ShhC/C controls, highlighting a cyto-architectural

329

arrangement that could underpin the disproportionate importance of LFP compared to MFPShh

330

for the maintenance of the pMNOlig2+ cell population (Fig. 5B).

331
332

Diminishment of pMNOlig2+ cells during the phase of ventral oligodendrogenesis results in

333

reduced OPC production.

334

Reduced Shh signaling originating from MNs, LFP, or MFP leaves the pMN domain

335

impoverished of pMNOlig2+ cells at the beginning of oligodendrogenesis (Fig. 4). Nevertheless,

336

the pMNOlig2+ cell population could recover during OPC production by increased precursor

337

recruitment from dorsal ventricular precursor domains (Ravanelli and Appel 2015), proliferation

338

of remaining pMNOlig2+ precursor cells, or increased differentiation and amplification of OPC

339

fated cells that have left the pMN domain. We therefore first visualized the size of pMNOlig2+

340

population at the end of ventral oligodendrogenesis at E14.5. We find a moderate reduction in

341

the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells in ChATShh-/- and an almost complete absence of pMNOlig2+ cells

342

in NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- compared to ShhC/C controls suggesting that increased recruitment of

343

precursors to the pMN domain does not occur in mutants (Fig. S4 and Fig. 6A). We then

344

determined whether pMNOlig2+ cells and/or migrating OPCs in Olig2Shh-/- increase their rate of

345

proliferation during the phase of OPC production. We injected EdU into pregnant dams at E11.5,

346

E12.5, and E13.5 and quantified the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells 24h later. We found comparable

347

broad EdU+ labeling throughout the ventricular zone of Olig2Shh-/- mutants and controls,

348

suggesting overall progenitor proliferation is not affected in mutants (Fig. 6A). Within the pMN

349

domain we observe a ~25% decrease in the numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells in ShhC/C controls over

350

the course of OPC production from E12.5 to E14.5 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, numbers of pMNOlig2+

351

cells in Olig2Shh-/- mutants decline to near undetectable levels during the same period indicating a

352

precocious exhaustion of the pMNOlig2+ cell population during OPC generation (Fig. 6B). We

353

next determined the rate of proliferation of pMNOlig2+ cells in controls and mutants. In controls,

354

we find a similar proliferative rate of about 47% of pMNOlig2+ cells at E12.5, E13.5 and E14.5. In

355

contrast, in Olig2Shh-/- we find the rate of proliferation to be reduced to 37% at E12.5 and E13.5,

356

followed by a further decrease to 16% by E14.5 (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that the

357

precocious exhaustion of the pMNOlig2+ cell population is associated with a reduced proliferation

358

rate of precursor cells during OPC production which is compounded by reduced numbers of

359

pMNOlig2+ cells that are present at the beginning of OPC production.

360

We next tested whether OPC production in Olig2Shh-/- recovers through increased

361

amplification of precursors once they have emerged from the pMN. We analyzed numbers of

362

EdU+ Olig2+ cells in the mantle zone (Fig. 6D). While there are very few Olig2+ cells in the

363

mantle zone of mutants and controls at E12.5, with ongoing expansion of these cells, we find a 3-

364

fold and 15-fold reduction of Olig2+ cells at E13.5 and E14.5, resp.in mutants compared to

365

controls (Fig. 6E). The rate of proliferation among Olig2+ cells in the mantle zone in Olig2Shh-/-

366

is similar at E13.5 and E14.5 compared to controls suggesting that OPCs in mutants do not

367

amplify at an increased rate compared to controls (Fig. 6F). The cells that do emerge from the

368

pMN in Olig2Shh-/- disperse as rapidly as their control counterparts, resulting in a ventral spinal

369

cord that is populated with nascent OPCs with a 15-fold lower density compared to controls (Fig.

370

S5). Additionally, we examined OPC proliferation at E14.5 in posterior thoracic and lumbar

371

segments and found no detectable increase in proliferation rate in any of the pMN, mantle, or

372

white matter (WM) areas (Fig. S6). These results reveal that the yield of the pMN domain during

373

OPC production largely determines the numbers of OPCs that settle in white and grey matter.

374

391

Discussion:

392

Our study provides causal evidence that the sequential and patterned expression of Shh by

393

previously specified cell types in the ventral spinal cord is critical for scaled oligodendrocyte

394

precursor specification along the anterior posterior axis of the developing spinal cord. We took

395

advantage of neural tube development as an established model system to reveal that Shh-

396

expressing signaling centers become established among post mitotic derivatives of ventricular

397

zone differentiation (VZDShh) in a temporally- and spatially-patterned manner as development

398

proceeds. We find that VZDShh signaling is critical for the production of OPCs in proportionate

399

numbers to previously specified neurons. Our data provides genetic evidence in support of the

400

hypothesis that extra-midline sources of Shh are critical for switching neurogenesis to

401

gliogenesis and add a novel mechanism that contributes to pattern scaling along the anterior to

402

posterior axis. Our observations do not rule out contributions of other well-established cell-

403

autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms that adapt morphogen function and allow

404

pattern scaling (Houchmandzadeh, Wieschaus et al. 2005, Ben-Zvi and Barkai 2010,

405

Hamaratoglu, de Lachapelle et al. 2011, Ben-Zvi, Fainsod et al. 2014, Uygur, Young et al. 2016),

406

but provide a mechanism by which Shh mediated signaling from the midline in the ventral neural

407

tube becomes progressively augmented such that Shh signaling remains a relevant instructive

408

signal despite rapid growth.

409

Sequential expression and function of VZDShh.

410

Despite its complexity, development is orchestrated by the actions of just a handful of

411

morphogens. The temporal and spatial segregation of developmental fields that are patterned by

412

morphogens can allow the same morphogen to play an instructive role repeatedly and at multiple

413

anatomic regions specifying vastly different cell types and tissues. However, in the developing

414

spinal cord all cell types are descendants of the same developmental field, the ventricular zone,

415

yet the same morphogen, Shh, is involved in the sequential specification of multiple cell types

416

(Dessaud, McMahon et al. 2008). The number of source tissues of Shh in the ventral spinal cord

417

expands concomitantly with development, suggesting that “moving the Shh source” might play

418

an important role (Danesin and Soula, 2017). We reassessed Shh expression in mice using a

419

nuclear targeted LacZ based gene expression tracer allele and verified the principle findings in

420

chick by RNA in situ. The advantage of the gene expression tracer allele is that the identity,

421

location and numbers of Shh expression can be determined with single-cell resolution. Ablating

422

Shh and nLacZ by Nestin-Cre, which is expressed in the ventricular zone, reveals that one half to

423

one third of all Shh expressing cells in the ventral spinal cord are ventricular zone descendants at

424

the time that Shh signaling strength within the pMN domain rises coincident with the switch

425

from neurogenesis to gliogenesis (Dessaud, Yang et al. 2007, Balaskas, Ribeiro et al. 2012,

426

Touahri, Escalas et al. 2012, Kicheva, Bollenbach et al. 2014, Kicheva and Briscoe 2015). While

427

the gene expression tracer allele cannot be used to draw conclusions about the relative Shh

428

signaling strength in the ventricular zone that is contributed by VZDShh, the anatomic

429

arrangement of these sources and the genetic ablation of Shh from these sources suggests a

430

disproportionate effect on the activity of the pMN domain. The LFP proper extends the midline

431

source of Shh by several cell diameters more dorsally as previously observed (Charrier et al.,

432

2002). A subset of LFP cells, which we designate here as LFP* cells, co-express Nkx2.2 and Shh

433

(Al Oustah, Danesin et al. 2014) and are in direct contact with cells that co-express the Shh high-

434

threshold genes Nkx2.2+ Olig2+ and form the p* domain at the beginning of oligodendrogenesis

435

(Fu, Qi et al. 2002, Traiffort, Zakaria et al. 2016). At the same developmental stage, we detect

436

expression of Shh in the nascent lateral, but not medial, MN column in mice and chick. Shh can

437

be released from the axonal as well as the dendritic compartment of neurons ((Beug, Parks et al.

438

2011). Hence nascent MNs could secrete Shh via dendrites or possibly trailing cellular processes

439

close to the pMN domain. Together, the spatial and temporal pattern of VZDShh expression that

440

we observe is consistent with the results from our selective gene ablation studies which

441

demonstrate that these sources of Shh influence pMN domain activity, a speculation put forward

442

previously in regard of the function of LFPShh (Danesin and Soula 2017).

443

A striking feature of the phenotype of Shh ablation from VZD is the temporal and qualitative

444

segregation of the effects on MN and OPC production. VZDShh has no detectable effect on MN

445

production or the extent of programmed cell death of MNs in our paradigms. In contrast, ablation

446

of VZDShh results in severely reduced OPC production: (1) During the period of OPC production

447

the initial 2-fold diminishment of pMNOlig2+ cells increases to a more than 10-fold reduction in

448

pMNOlig2+ cells compared to controls. (2) During the same period, the numbers of Olig2+ cells

449

that emerge from the pMN domain drop 10-fold. (3) The proliferation rate of these nascent OPCs

450

is equal to or lower compared to their control counterparts. Together these observations reveal

451

that the numbers of OPCs that emigrate from the pMN domain and settle in the white and grey

452

matter are determined mainly by the size of the pMNOlig2+ precursor cell population.

453

The relative contribution of VZDShh to regulating the size of the pMNOlig2+ precursor cell

454

population is spinal level specific. For example, the ablation of VZDShh results in a pMNOlig2+

455

loss of about 40% at brachial levels. Half of that effect at brachial levels can be attributed to the

456

expression of MNShh since the ablation of Shh from cholinergic neurons by ChAT-Cre alone

457

results in an almost 26% reduction in the size of the pMNOlig2+ population (Fig. 3.2B). The

458

remaining size of the pMNOlig2+ population at brachial levels in the ChATShh-/- spinal cord is

459

similar to the average size of the pMNOlig2+ domain at thoracic levels in control spinal cords.

460

Since thoracic MNs do not express Shh until the end of OPC production at E14.5, our

461

observations reveal that the increased size of the pMN domain at brachial levels is dependent on

462

MNShh. Thus, the selective expression of MNShh at brachial and lumbar levels provides a

463

mechanism for ensuring a proportionate increase in the production of OPCs at brachial and

464

lumbar - compared to thoracic- levels that is matched to the increased numbers of MNs at limb

465

levels.

466

Potential mechanisms of actions of VZDShh.

467

Does Shh from different sources have distinct functions in the ventricular zone of the

468

ventral spinal cord? Three observations support origin specific functions of Shh in the ventral

469

spinal cord in the pMN domain: (1) MFPShh but not VZDShh influences MN production (Fig. 3).

470

Consistent, ablation of Shh in the MFP by Olig2-Cre is complete at the beginning of MN

471

production while ablation of Shh in VZD by Nestin-Cre only begins towards the end of MN

472

generation (Fig. 1). In further support of a critical role of MFPShh in MN generation and

473

consistent with previous findings (Yu, McGlynn et al. 2013), we find a Shh gene dose-dependent

474

reduction of the numbers of MNs of similar magnitude among early and late forming MN

475

columns as well as late born MNs still in transit at E12.5. Hence, based on the timing of Shh

476

expression and the consistent deficit in MN production throughout the period of MN generation,

477

the reduced rate of MN production must be associated with the reduction of midline-derived Shh

478

rather than VZD-derived Shh. Strikingly, however, whether Shh expression is ablated from all

479

VZDs (NestinShh-/-) or partially from the MFP in addition to LFP and MNs (Olig2Shh-/-), the pMN

480

domain is left with similar strongly reduced numbers of pMNOlig2+ cells at the end of MN

481

production (Fig. 2). Since ventral precursor domains form normally and a full complement of

482

pMNOlig2+ cells is induced in Olig2Shh-/- (Fig. 1), these results point to distinct functions of Shh

483

derived from the MFP and VZDs in pMN domain activity: Our data indicates that MFPShh

484

determines the rate of MN production while VZDShh is critical to counteract the exhaustion of the

485

pMNOlig2+ population during MN production. (2) We find that the high threshold, Shh dependent

486

and p* domain defining co-expression of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 (Fu, Qi et al. 2002) occurs in cells

487

that are in close proximity to LFP* cells. Ablation of VZDShh results in a 3-fold reduction in the

488

numbers of Nkx2.2/Olig2 expressing cells at E12.5 (Fig. 4). Additional ablation of Shh from

489

50% of the MFP in Olig2Shh-/- did not increase the severity of this phenotype (Fig. 4). Thus,

490

consistent with the anatomic juxtaposition of LFP cells to p* domain cells our gene ablation

491

studies demonstrate that VZDShh is critical for the production of the Nkx2.2 expressing

492

subpopulation of ventral oligodendrocyte lineage cells. (3) The dorsal most aspects of the pMN

493

domain is almost completely devoid of Olig2+ expressing cells at the end of MN production at

494

E12.5 in NestinShh-/- and Olig2Shh-/- (Fig. 2). Given that early pioneer OPCs elaborate cellular

495

contacts selectively with MNs (Osterstock, Le Bras et al. 2018) it seems plausible that the LFP

496

and MFP most distant pMN areas are served selectively by Shh from MNShh. In this scenario Shh

497

signaling from different sources might subdivide the pMN domain into sub-regions from which

498

distinct oligodendrocyte subtypes might emerge (Dimou and Simons 2017, Ravanelli, Kearns et

499

al. 2018) Dependent on the mode of delivery, VZDShh could also exhibit distinct modes of

500

action: for example, LFPShh could result in maintenance of Olig2 expression in pMN precursor

501

cells while MNShh could attract precursor cells to migrate into the pMN domain from the dorsal

502

ventricular zone as is observed in zebrafish (Ravanelli and Appel, 2015).

503

Together, our data provides genetic evidence in support of the idea that morphogen signaling centers

504

are established sequentially in the developing ventral spinal cord. These new “organizer tissues” express

505

Shh which acts together with Shh produced by the medial floor plate to influence SVZ activity as the

506

spinal cord grows. These Shh sources are critically involved in the switch of neurogenesis to

507

oligodendrogenesis in the pMN domain. Endowing VZDs with morphogenic activity makes subsequent

508

differentiation conditional to the completion of previous developmental milestones in the ventral spinal

509

cord. Further, expression of the morphogen linked to the numbers and types of VZDs produced,

510

provides a mechanism that could ensure scale invariance in regard of neuron and glia production along

511

the anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord.

All mice were sacrificed using an overdose of anesthetic, subjected to transcardial perfusion with

560

4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4. Spinal cords and embryos were

561

dissected, postfixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr at 4°C, cryoprotected with 30% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1M

562

PBS for 24–48 hr, embedded and frozen in OCT medium, and stored at −80°C. Tissues were

563

sectioned at 20 μm and collected onto glass slides.

20um thick spinal cord cryosections were air dried for 30 min. Then sections were washed with

568

PBS for 10 mins and with 0.3% [v/v] Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Sections were then pre-

569

treated with blocking solution (10% [v/v] horse serum and 0.3% [v/v] Triton X-100 in PBS) for

570

90 mins and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4C. The next day, following 3 PBS

571

washes the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature. A

572

list of all antibodies and compounds used is provided in a table. For cell counts, at least three

573

sections per animal from at least three mice were examined, unless otherwise noted. Images were

574

acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 (Graphpad Software Inc.) Analysis of multiple

577

groups was made using one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey or Dunnett’s post hoc analysis

578

tests. For 2-groups analyses, unpaired Student’s t test was used. The data are presented

579

graphically as: ∗(p < 0.05), ∗∗(p < 0.01), and ∗∗∗(p < 0.001).

levels of nLacZ.
(E) Immunostaining for nLacZ and Nkx2.2 on brachial and thoracic segments.
Identification of LFP (Nkx2.2- nLacZ+) and LFP* (Nkx2.2+ nLacZ+). Arrows point to
migrating LFP* Nkx2.2+ nLacZ+ cells.
(F) X-gal staining and immunostaining for nLacZ and Hb9 on brachial segments.
(G) Quantification of MFP nLacZ recombination at brachial and thoracic segments for
each Shh source per genotype. Brachial and thoracic segments ShhC/C n=5, ChATShh-/n=3, NestinShh-/- n=3, Olig2Shh-/- n=5. Means ± SEM are shown. One-way ANOVA,
Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test. ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001.
(H) Quantification of LFP and LFP* nLacZ recombination at brachial and thoracic
segments for each Shh source per genotype. Brachial and thoracic segments ShhC/C
n=5, ChATShh-/- n=4-5, NestinShh-/- n=4, Olig2Shh-/- n=3. Means ± SEM are shown. Oneway ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test. ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01,
∗∗∗p<0.001.
(I) Quantification of nLacZ recombination in brachial MNs. ShhC/C n=14, ChATShh-/- n=8,
NestinShh-/- n=5, Olig2Shh-/- n=5. Means ± SEM are shown. One-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s
multiple comparison post hoc test. ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001.
(J) Schematic of Shh expressing cells at E12.5 brachial and thoracic segments and
strategy of Cre ablation for each genotype. Scale bars, 50 μm.
