Abstract
Alternative splicing (AS) programs are primarily controlled by regulatory RNA binding
proteins (RBPs). It has been proposed that a small number of master splicing
regulators might control cell-specific splicing networks and that these RBPs could be
identified by proximity of their genes to transcriptional super-enhancers. Using this
approach we identified RBPMS as a critical splicing regulator in differentiated vascular
smooth muscle cells (SMCs). RBPMS is highly down-regulated during phenotypic
switching of SMCs from a contractile to a motile and proliferative phenotype and is
responsible for 20% of the AS changes during this transition. RBPMS directly regulates
AS of numerous components of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion machineries
whose activity is critical for SMC function in both phenotypes. RBPMS also regulates
splicing of other splicing, post-transcriptional and transcription regulators including the
key SMC transcription factor Myocardin, thereby matching many of the criteria of a
master regulator of AS in SMCs.

Introduction
Alternative splicing (AS) is an important component of regulated gene
expression programmes during cell development and differentiation, usually focusing
on different sets of genes than transcriptional control (Blencowe, 2006). AS programs
5

re-wire protein-protein interaction networks (Buljan et al., 2012; J. D. Ellis et al., 2012;
Yang et al., 2016), as well as allowing quantitative regulation by generating mRNA
isoforms that are differentially regulated by translation or mRNA decay (McGlincy &
Smith, 2008; Mockenhaupt & Makeyev, 2015). Coordinated cell-specific splicing
programs are determined by a combination of cis-acting transcript features and trans-

10

acting factors that compose “splicing codes” (Barash et al., 2010; Chen & Manley,
2009; X. D. Fu & Ares, 2014). The interactions between the trans component RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) and the cis component regulatory elements in target RNAs
coordinate the activation and repression of specific splicing events. Many regulatory
proteins, including members of the SR and hnRNP protein families, are quite widely

15

expressed, while others are expressed in a narrower range of cell types (David &
Manley, 2008; X. D. Fu & Ares, 2014). A further conceptual development of
combinatorial models for splicing regulation has been the suggestion that a subset of
RBPs act as master regulators of cell-type specific AS networks (Jangi & Sharp, 2014).
The criteria expected of such master regulators include that: i) they are essential for

20

cell-type specification or maintenance, ii) their direct and indirect targets are important
for cell-type function, iii) they are likely to regulate the activity of other splicing
regulators, iv) they exhibit a wide dynamic range of activity, which is not limited by
autoregulation, and v) they are regulated externally from the splicing network, for
example by transcriptional control or post-translational modifications. It was further

25

suggested that expression of such splicing master regulators would be driven by
transcriptional super-enhancers, providing a possible route to their identification (Jangi
& Sharp, 2014). Super-enhancers are extended clusters of enhancers that are more
cell-type specific than classical enhancers and that drive expression of genes that are
essential for cell-type identity, including key transcription factors (Hnisz et al., 2013).

30

By extension, RBPs whose expression is driven by super-enhancers are expected to
be critical for cell-type identity and might include master regulators of tissue-specific
AS networks (Jangi & Sharp, 2014).

Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in cardiovascular
physiology and pathology (Bennett, Sinha, & Owens, 2016; Fisher, 2010; Owens,
35

Kumar, & Wamhoff, 2004). Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle SMCs exhibit
phenotypic plasticity and are not terminally differentiated (Owens et al., 2004) (Fig.
1A). In healthy arteries, vascular SMCs exist in a differentiated contractile state. In
response to injury or disease, the SMC phenotype switches towards a more
synthetically active, motile and proliferative state (Fisher, 2010; Owens et al., 2004).

40

The transcriptional control of SMC phenotypic switching has been intensely studied,
but the role of post-transcriptional regulation has been relatively neglected (Fisher,
2010). For example, some markers of the contractile state, such as h-Caldesmon and
meta-Vinculin, arise via AS (Owens et al., 2004), but nothing is known about the
regulation of these events. A number of known splicing regulators, including PTBP1,

45

CELF, MBNL, QKI, TRA2B, and SRSF1, have been implicated in the regulation of
individual SMC-specific ASEs, but these proteins are not restricted to differentiated
SMCs and most act primarily in the de-differentiated state (Gooding et al., 2013;
Gooding, Roberts, & Smith, 1998; Gromak, Matlin, Cooper, & Smith, 2003; Shukla &
Fisher, 2008; van der Veer et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2017). Indeed, global profiling

50

confirmed a widespread role of PTBP1 in repressing exons that are used in
differentiated mouse aorta SMCs (Llorian et al., 2016), but did not identify RBPs that
act as direct regulators of the differentiated state. Biochemical identification of such
RBPs is hampered by the fact that SMCs rapidly dedifferentiate in cell culture
conditions.

55

Here, we used the approach suggested by Jangi and Sharp, to identify
candidate AS master regulators as RBP-encoding genes whose cell-specific
expression is driven by super-enhancers (Jangi & Sharp, 2014). We identified RNA
Binding Protein with Multiple Splicing (RBPMS), a protein not previously known to
regulate splicing, as a critical regulator of numerous AS events in SMCs. RBPMS is

60

highly expressed in differentiated SMCs, where it promotes AS of genes that are
important for SMC function. These include many components of the actin cytoskeleton
and focal adhesion machineries, modulation of whose function is key to the transition
from contractile to motile phenotypes. RBPMS also targets other splicing regulators,
post-transcriptional regulators and the key SMC transcription factor Myocardin where

65

RBPMS promotes inclusion of an exon that is essential for maximal SMC-specific
activity. RBPMS therefore meets many of the criteria expected of an AS master

regulator in SMCs, and its identification validates the approach of identifying key cellspecific regulators via the super-enhancer-proximity of their genes.

Results
RBPMS is a SMC splicing regulator
To identify potential SMC master splicing factors we used a catalog of 1542 human
RBPs (Gerstberger, Hafner, & Tuschl, 2014) and data-sets of super-enhancers from
75

three human SMC-rich tissues (aorta, bladder, stomach smooth muscle) and skeletal
muscle (Hnisz et al., 2013)(Supplementary File 1). Nine RBP genes were associated
with super-enhancers in all SMC tissues but not skeletal muscle (Fig 1B). Using a set
of super-enhancer-associated genes in the dbSUPER database (Khan & Zhang,
2016), we identified two candidates, of which only RBPMS was shared with our original

80

9 candidates. Examination of RBPMS expression in human tissues from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project (Consortium, 2013) showed the top 8
expressing tissues to be SMC rich, including three arteries (Fig. S1A). RNA-Seq data
from rat aorta SMCs showed that Rbpms levels decreased 3.8 fold during dedifferentiation from tissue to passage 9 cell culture (Fig. S1B-D), in parallel with known

85

SMC transcriptional markers (Acta2, Cnn1, Smtn, (Fig. S1C,D) and AS events (Tpm1
and Actn1, Fig. S1E,F). Moreover, of the starting candidate RBPs (Fig 1B) Rbpms was
the most highly expressed of those that were down-regulated from tissue to culture
(Fig. S1C green labels). Expression of the Rbpms2 paralog also decreased upon dedifferentiation, but its absolute level of expression was >10-fold lower than Rbpms

90

(Fig. S1C,D). Other RBPs implicated in AS regulation in SMCs (PTBP1, MBNL1, QKI)
either showed more modest changes or higher expression in de-differentiated cells
(Fig. S1C,D). In the PAC1 rat SMC line Rbpms mRNA levels decreased by ~10-fold
between differentiated and proliferative states in parallel with SMC marker AS events
(Fig. 1D) and genes (Fig. 1E). Rbpms2 was expressed at much lower levels than

95

Rbpms, and did not alter expression between PAC1 cell states (Fig 1E). RBPMS
protein decreased to undetectable levels in proliferative PAC1 cells in parallel with
smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) (Fig 1F). Immunofluorescence microscopy also showed

higher levels of RBPMS in differentiated PAC1 cells where it was predominantly
nuclear (Fig 1G), consistent with the hypothesis that it regulates splicing.
100

To further investigate RBPMS expression we cloned cDNAs from PAC1 cells,
representing seven distinct mRNA isoforms. These encoded two major protein
isoforms (RBPMSA and RBPMSB) sharing a common N-terminus and RNA
Recognition Motif (RRM) domain. RBPMSA and B differed by short C-terminal tails
encoded by alternative 3' end exon 7 and exon 8 (Fig. 1C), and corresponded in size

105

to the two protein bands seen in western blots (Fig. 1F). Other mRNA isoforms differed
by inclusion or skipping of exon 6 and by alternative 3' UTR exon inclusion. RBPMS
and RBPMS2, which are 70% identical, have a single RRM domain that is responsible
for both RNA binding and dimerization (Sagnol et al., 2014; Teplova, Farazi, Tuschl,
& Patel, 2016). Optimal RBPMS binding sites consist of tandem CACs separated by

110

a spacer of ~1-12 nt (Farazi et al., 2014; Soufari & Mackereth, 2017). We found
significant enrichment of CACN1-12CAC motifs within and upstream of exons that are
less included in differentiated compared to cultured rat aorta SMCs (Fig. S1H). These
are locations at which many splicing regulators mediate exon skipping (X. D. Fu &
Ares, 2014; Witten & Ule, 2011). Consistent with this, the SMC-specific mutually

115

exclusive exon pairs in Actn1 and Tpm1 (Gooding & Smith, 2008; Southby, Gooding,
& Smith, 1999) both have conserved clusters of CAC motifs upstream of the exon that
is skipped in differentiated SMCs (see below).
In summary, the presence of super-enhancers at the RBPMS gene in SMC-rich
tissues, its wide dynamic range of expression between differentiated SMCs and other

120

tissues and proliferative SMCs (Fig. 1, S1), the nuclear localization of RBPMS, and the
presence of potential RBPMS binding sites adjacent to known SMC-regulated exons
are all consistent with the hypothesis that RBPMS might act as a master regulator of
AS in differentiated SMCs.
RBPMS promotes a differentiated SMC splicing program

125

To investigate the roles of RBPMS in shaping SMC transcriptomes we
manipulated levels of RBPMS expression in differentiated and proliferative PAC1 cells
(Fig. 2A,B). We used siRNAs to knockdown all Rbpms isoforms in differentiated PAC1
cells, achieving ~75% depletion with no effect on the SMC marker ACTA2 (Fig. 2B). In
parallel, proliferative PAC1 cells were transduced with pINDUCER lentiviral vectors

130

(Meerbrey et al., 2011) to allow Doxycycline inducible over-expression of RBPMSA.

No basal RBPMS expression was observed in proliferative cells, but upon induction
substantial expression was observed from the FLAG-RBPMSA vector but not from the
empty lentiviral vector (LV) (Fig. 2B). The effects of manipulating RBP levels can
sometimes be compensated by related family members (Mockenhaupt & Makeyev,
135

2015). However, Rbpms2 levels were not affected by any of the treatments and
Rbpms2 knockdown, either alone or in combination with Rbpms, had no effects upon
tested AS events (data not shown).
RNA samples from Rbpms knockdown and overexpression experiments were
prepared for Illumina poly(A) RNAseq. Data was analysed for changes in mRNA

140

abundance using DESEq2 (Love, Huber, & Anders, 2014) (Fig. 2C, Supplementary
File 2), and for changes in AS using rMATS (Shen et al., 2014) (Fig. 2D,
Supplementary File 3). In addition to analysis of effects of RBPMS depletion and
overexpression, comparison of the differentiated and proliferative PAC1 control
samples revealed changes associated with differentiation state. Principal Component

145

Analysis based on mRNA abundance showed clear separation of differentiated and
proliferative samples (PC1, 82% variance, Fig. S2A). This suggests that at the level of
mRNA abundance the differences between differentiated and proliferative PAC1 cells
far outweigh any effects of manipulating RBPMS levels. Consistent with this, RBPMS
knockdown was associated with ~10-fold fewer changes at the transcript abundance

150

level (110 increased, 82 decreased, padj < 0.05, fold change > 2-fold) compared to the
differentiated vs proliferative control comparison (830 increased, 1444 decreased, Fig.
2C). RBPMS overexpression led to an intermediate number of changes in mRNA
abundance levels, but only 29 genes were affected by both overexpression and
knockdown, and of these only 4 genes other than Rbpms were regulated reciprocally.

155

RBPMS knockdown and overexpression had substantial effects at the level of
AS affecting all types of AS event (Figs. 2D, S2B). RBPMS knockdown led to changes
in 318 AS events (FDR < 0.05, |DPSI| > 0.1, where PSI is Percent Spliced In), which
was only 2-fold less than the number of events regulated between control differentiated
and proliferative cells. Cassette exons were the largest group of events, with roughly

160

equal numbers of up- and down-regulated exons (Fig. 2D). RBPMS overexpression
led to a larger number of AS changes (4934 regulated events), probably resulting from
the combination of RBPMS expression in excess of levels usually present in
differentiated PAC1 cells (Fig. 2C) and also because we expressed the more active

RBPMSA isoform (see below). Cassette exons affected by RBPMS overexpression
165

were strongly skewed (80%) towards greater exon skipping. A subset of ASEs
observed in the RNA-Seq experiments, encompassing RBPMS activated and
repressed cassette exons and mutually exclusive exons were validated by RT-PCR
(Fig. 2E,F, Fig. S2E,F). DPSI values determined by RT-PCR and RNA-Seq were in
good agreement (Fig. S2G). As an additional negative control, doxycycline induction

170

of empty lentiviral transduced cells had no effect on RBPMS regulated AS events (Fig.
S2D).
In each of the three comparisons, there was little overlap between genes
regulated at the levels of splicing and mRNA abundance (Fig. S2C). However, there
were substantial overlaps of ASEs regulated by RBPMS knockdown, overexpression

175

and PAC1 phenotype (Fig 3A). Twenty percent of ASEs regulated in PAC1 cell
differentiation were congruently regulated by RBPMS knockdown, representing 40%
of ASEs affected by RBPMS knockdown (Fig 3A, 3B left panel). The high correlation
(R2 = 0.95) suggests that for these 127 events changes in RBPMS expression are
sufficient to explain their differentiation-specific splicing changes. Similarly RBPMS

180

overexpression shared 180 events in common with PAC1 differentiation status (28%
of differentiation specific events). The correlation between DPSI for AS events coregulated in PAC1 differentiation and RBPMS overexpression (R2 = 0.86) was lower
than for RBPMS knockdown and represented only 3.7% of events regulated by
RBPMS overexpression (Fig 3A, 3B right panel). Hierarchical clustering of cassette

185

exons regulated between PAC1 phenotypes across all 12 samples also revealed two
clusters of RBPMS-responsive events where knockdown and overexpression were
sufficient to reciprocally convert the splicing pattern to that of the other cellular
phenotype (Fig. 3E, clusters 1 and 4, containing RBPMS activated and repressed
exons respectively).

190

Many AS events in differentiated PAC1 cells do not reach the fully differentiated
splicing pattern characteristic of tissue SMCs. However, for some events
overexpression of RBPMS led to splicing patterns similar to tissue SMCs. For example
the Actn1 SM exon is included to 69% in differentiated PAC1 cells, but to 93-94% in
RBPMS overexpressing cells (Fig 2E) and aorta tissue (Fig. S1F). We therefore

195

hypothesized that some ASEs regulated by RBPMS overexpression but not knockdown, might reflect tissue SMC AS patterns that are not usually observed in cultured

SMCs. To address this possibility we used RNA-Seq data monitoring de-differentiation
of rat aorta SMCs (Fig. S1B,C). Of 1714 ASES regulated between tissue and passage
9 SMCs, 265 (15%) were also regulated by RBPMS overexpression in PAC1 cells (Fig.
200

3C,D, R2 = 0.68). Strikingly, hierarchical clustering of cassette exons regulated
between aorta tissue and passage 9 cultured SMCs showed that the RBPMS
overexpression sample clustered together with tissue, away from all other samples
(Fig. 3F). Two clusters of AS events shared very similar splicing patterns in tissue and
RBPMSA overexpression, and differed in all remaining samples (Fig. 3F). Cluster 1

205

comprised 28 RBPMS-activated exons, of which 20 were not regulated between PAC1
phenotypes. For example, inclusion of a cassette exon in Fermt2 was observed only
in tissue and RBPMS overexpression samples (Fig. 3G). Similarly, inclusion of Cald1
exon 4 in conjunction with a downstream 5’ splice site on exon 3a, producing the
hCald1 marker in tissue SMCs (Fig 3G, S3C), and inclusion of the meta-vinculin exon

210

(Fig. S3A) were also only seen upon RBPMS overexpression. Cluster 4 contained
exons that are skipped in tissue and upon RBPMS overexpression (e.g. Tsc2, Fig. 3G),
the majority of which are not regulated in PAC1 differentiated cells. Likewise Tpm1
mutually exclusive exon 3 is skipped nearly completely upon RBPMS overexpression
in a similar pattern to tissue (Fig. S3B). Upregulation of RBPMS expression therefore

215

appears to be sufficient to promote a subset of splicing patterns usually only observed
in differentiated SMCs in vivo.

RBPMS directly regulates exons with associated CAC motifs
To address whether RBPMS directly regulates target exons we looked for enrichment
220

of its binding motif (Farazi et al., 2014) adjacent to cassette exons regulated by RBPMS
knockdown or overexpression. CACN1-12CAC motifs were significantly enriched
around exons that were activated or repressed by RBPMS, with a similar positiondependent activity as other splicing regulators (Fig 4A). Exons repressed by RBPMS
showed strong enrichment of motifs within the exon and the immediate ~80 nt

225

upstream intron flank, while exons activated by RBPMS showed motif enrichment
within the downstream intron flank. Consistent with the contribution of RBPMS to the
AS changes between PAC1 differentiation states, CACN1-12CAC motifs were also
enriched upstream of and within exons that are more skipped in differentiated cells,
and downstream of exons that are more included in differentiated cells (Fig 4A).

230

Moreover, in the set of exons activated by RBPMS overexpression, CACN1-12CAC
motifs were not only enriched downstream, but also significantly depleted in the
repressive locations within and upstream of the exon (Fig. 4A,B). This suggests that
binding in repressive locations might be dominant over activation.
To test whether RBPMS regulates AS events by directly binding to CAC motifs we co-

235

transfected HEK293 cells with RBPMS expression vectors and minigenes of
representative activated (Flnb) and repressed (Tpm1, Actn1) exons, with potential
RBPMS binding sites in expected locations for activation or repression (Fig. S4C-E).
We initially established that transient expression of RBPMSA in HEK293 cells was
sufficient to switch AS of endogenous FLNB, TPM1, MPRIP and ACTN1 towards the

240

SMC splicing pattern (Fig 4C,G, Fig. S4A). For comparison, we also transfected
expression constructs for the RBPMSB isoform and the paralog RBPMS2. We found
that RBPMSB had lower activity for some events (ACTN1, Fig. S4A), but that
transfected RBPMS2 had similar activity to RBPMSA in all cases. RBPMSA and
RBPMS2 also strongly activated inclusion of the Flnb H1 exon in a minigene context

245

while RBPMSB activated to a lower extent (Fig 4D). Tpm1 exon 3 is the regulated
member of a pair of mutually exclusive exons and is repressed in SMCs (P. D. Ellis,
Smith, & Kemp, 2004; Gooding, Roberts, Moreau, Nadal-Ginard, & Smith, 1994).
MBNL and PTBP proteins promote this repression but are not sufficient to switch
splicing (Gooding et al., 2013; Gooding et al., 1998). In contrast, RBPMSA expression

250

was sufficient to cause a near complete switch from exon inclusion to skipping (Fig
4H). RBPMS2 had lower activity, but RBPMSB was by far the least active protein.
Likewise, RBPMSA and RBPMS2 completely switched splicing of Actn1 constructs
(Gromak et al., 2003; Southby et al., 1999) from the NM to the SM mutually exclusive
exon, while RBPMSB was nearly inactive (Fig. S4B). A construct containing only the

255

Actn1 SM exon was unresponsive to cotransfection, while a construct containing only
the NM exon, which has 3 upstream CAC clusters (Fig. S4C) showed a complete
switch from inclusion to skipping upon cotransfection of RBPMSA or RBPMS2, but not
RBPMSB. Thus, for two mutually exclusive events RBPMSA is able to switch splicing
to the SMC pattern by repressing the exon that is usually used in non-SMCs, while

260

RBPMSB is less active.
We mutated CAC motifs in suspected binding sites to CCC, which disrupts RBPMS
binding (Farazi et al., 2014). Mutation of 12 CACs downstream of the FlnB H1 exon

had no effect on basal splicing, but the H1 exon was completely resistant to activation
265

by RBPMSA (Fig 4E). Likewise, mutation of 9 CAC motifs upstream of Tpm1 exon 3
had no effect on exon inclusion in the absence of RBPMSA, but completely prevented
exon skipping in response to RBPMSA (Fig 4I, Fig. S4E), while mutations of individual
clusters had intermediate effects (Fig. S4E). The response of both Flnb H1 exon and
Tpm1 exon 3 therefore depends on nearby CAC motifs. To test whether these are

270

binding sites for RBPMS, we used in vitro transcribed RNAs and recombinant
RBPMSA and B (Fig. 4F, J, Fig. S4F,G). Using both electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) and UV crosslinking, both RBPMSA and B were found to bind to the FlnB wild
type RNA, but not to the mutant RNA (Fig. 4F). With Tpm1, RBPMSA and B bound to
the WT RNA as indicated by EMSA assays (Fig. 4J). Binding was reduced by the

275

mutations that abrogated RBPMSA repression of Tpm1 exon 3. These data therefore
show that RBPMS can inhibit splicing by binding to sites upstream of exons (Tpm1)
and activate splicing by downstream binding (Flnb).

RBPMS regulated splicing targets the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion
280

To investigate the functional importance of RBPMS regulated AS we carried out Gene
Ontology (GO) analysis of the genes whose splicing or expression levels were
regulated by RBPMS (Fig5A, Fig. S5A, Tables S4, S5), or between SMC differentiation
states (Fig. S5B,C). Splicing events affected by RBPMS-knockdown affected genes
involved in processes, components and functions important for SMC biology, such as

285

cytoskeleton, cell projection, cell junction organization and GTPase regulation (Fig
5A). These categories were very similar to those affected by AS during PAC1 cell
dedifferentiation (Fig. S5B). Events regulated by RBPMS knockdown were also
enriched within genes that are associated with super-enhancers in SMC tissues (Fig.
5B) and therefore inferred to be important for SMC identity. In contrast, the relevance

290

of GO terms associated with RBPMSA overexpression to SMC biology was less clear
(Fig. S5A), and overexpression AS targets were not enriched for aorta super-enhancer
associated genes (p = 0.37). Likewise, at the RNA abundance level enriched GO
terms associated with RBPMS knockdown or overexpression did not align with those
associated with differentiation, mainly being associated with stress responses

12
To further explore the consequences of RBPMS regulation we carried out network
analysis using STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2017) (Fig. 5C). We used only target AS
events that are coregulated by RBPMS knockdown and PAC1 differentiation state
(Fig. 3A,E) or by RBPMS overexpression and in aorta tissue (Fig. 3C,F), and restricted

the output network to high confidence interactions. RBPMS targets comprised a
network (Fig. 5C) focused on functions associated with cell-substrate adhesion (yellow
nodes) and the actin cytoskeleton (blue). Six of the network proteins (SORBS1,
CALD1, PDLIM5, PDLIM7, ACTN1 and ARHGEF7) are also components of the
consensus integrin adhesome (Horton et al., 2015), which mechanically connects, and

305

mediates signalling between, the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
Underlining the importance of this network to SMC function, many of the genes are
themselves super-enhancer-associated in one or more smooth muscle tissues (bold
text, Fig. 5C). Actomyosin activity, and its mechanical connection to the extracellular
matrix are important for both the contractile and motile states of SMCs (Min et al.,

310

2012). It appears that RBPMS plays an important role in modulating the activity of this
protein network to suit the needs of the two cell states. This control of a functionally
coherent set of targets that are important for SMC function is consistent with the
hypothesis that RBPMS is a master regulator of AS in SMCs.

315

RBPMS controls post-transcriptional regulators
Among the direct targets of master splicing regulators are expected to be events
controlling the activity of other AS regulators leading to further indirect AS changes.
Consistent with this, we noted that RBPMS affected splicing of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2.
RBPMS promoted skipping of the 36 nt and 95 nt alternative exons of Mbnl1 (here

320

referred to as exons 7 and 8), as indicated by both knockdown and overexpression
(Fig. 6A,B). In Mbnl2 the 36 nt exon was fully skipped in all conditions but the 95 nt
exon was repressed by RBPMS (Fig. 6C). Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, we
obtained Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 cDNAs from PAC1 cells that varied by inclusion of the 36
and 95 nt exons. Corresponding shifts in MBNL1, but not MBNL2, protein isoforms

325

could be observed by western blot (Fig 6D). These events affect the unstructured Ctermini of MBNL proteins and have been shown to affect their splicing activity (Sznajder
et al., 2016; Tabaglio et al., 2018; Tran et al., 2011), suggesting that RBPMS might
indirectly affect some AS events by modulating MBNL activity. To test this, we made

expression constructs of rat MBNL1 isoforms with and without exons 7 and 8 (FL, D7,
330

D8, D7D8) and MBNL2 with and without exon 8 (FL and D8), obtained as cDNAs from
PAC1 cells. When transfected into HEK293 cells, full length MBNL1 and 2 caused a
shift from use of the downstream to an upstream 5' splice site (5'SS) on NCOR2 exon
47 (Fig 6E), an event that is differentially regulated by MBNL isoforms (Sznajder et al.,
2016; Tran et al., 2011). The shorter MBNL isoforms showed lower activity in shifting

335

towards the upstream 5'SS, although the difference was not statistically significant for
the MBNL1 shorter isoforms (Fig. 6E). In proliferative PAC1 cells, NCOR2 exon 47
mainly uses the upstream 5'SS, and knockdown of MBNL1 and 2 caused a significant
shift to the downstream 5'SS (Fig. 6F). Overexpression of RBPMSA, also caused a
small shift to the downstream 5'SS (Fig. 6F, also detected by rMATs, DPSI = 13%,

340

FDR = 2 x 10-6), but had no effect when MBNL1 and MBNL2 were knocked down.
These results are consistent with MBNL1 and 2 being direct regulators of Ncor2
splicing, with RBPMS acting indirectly by promoting production of less active MBNL
isoforms.
Another post-transcriptional regulator affected by RBPMS is LSM14B, which is

345

involved in cytoplasmic regulation of mRNA stability and translation (Brandmann et al.,
2018) but also shuttles to the nucleus (Kirli et al., 2015). RBPMSA overexpression
promoted skipping of Lsm14b exon 6, a pattern which is also seen in tissue SMCs (Fig.
6G,H), and knockdown was also seen to affect this event (Fig 6G,H), with
corresponding changes in LSM14B protein (Fig. 6I). Exon 6 contains the only predicted

350

nuclear localization signal (RPPRRR) in LSM14B (Fig. 6H) lying between the LSM and
FDF domains. This suggests that RBPMS mediated AS might prevent nuclear shuttling
and function of LSM14B in mRNA turnover.

RBPMS controls the SMC transcription factor Myocardin
355

Myocardin (MYOCD) is a key transcription factor in SMCs and cardiac muscle (S. Li,
Wang, Wang, Richardson, & Olson, 2003). Skipping of Myocd exon 2a in cardiac
muscle and proliferative SMCs produces a canonical mRNA encoding full length
MYOCD (Fig. 7A) (Creemers, Sutherland, Oh, Barbosa, & Olson, 2006; van der Veer
et al., 2013). Inclusion of exon 2a in differentiated SMCs introduces an in frame stop

360

codon, and the N-terminally truncated Myocd isoform produced using a downstream

AUG codon lacks the MEF2 interacting domain and is more potent in activating SMCspecific promoters and SMC differentiation (Creemers et al., 2006; Imamura, Long,
Nanda, & Miano, 2010; van der Veer et al., 2013). Significant changes in Myocd exon
2a splicing were not detected by rMATS, but manual inspection of RNA-Seq data and
365

RT-PCR confirmed that Myocd exon 2a is more included in differentiated than
proliferative PAC1 SMCs (Fig. 7B) and its inclusion decreases upon RBPMS
knockdown (Fig. 7B, Fig. S2E). A conserved 200 nt region downstream of exon 2a
contains two clusters of CAC motifs (Fig. 7C), suggesting that RBPMS directly
activates exon 2a splicing. To better understand the regulation of the Myocd exon 2a,

370

we created a minigene of exon 2a and its flanking intronic regions. In transfected PAC1
cells exon 2a in the minigene was included to a basal level of ~30% and RBPMS-A or
RBPMS-B significantly increased exon 2a inclusion (Fig. 7D). The Myocd minigene
was also tested in HEK293 cells. As expected, exon 2a was fully skipped in the nonsmooth muscle cell line, but was highly responsive to RBPMSA and B with inclusion

375

increasing to ~75% and 37% respectively (Fig. 7E). To test the role of the downstream
CAC clusters we mutated each cluster (CAC to CCC mutations). Mutation of cluster 1
(mCAC) had a modest effect on activation by RBPMSA, although RBPMSB activity
was severely impaired. Mutation of cluster 2 impaired activity of both RBPMS isoforms,
while the combined mutations abolished all activation by RBPMS (Fig. 7E). Insertion

380

of a previously defined RBPMS site (Ube2v1 from (Farazi et al., 2014)) into the double
mutant minigene restored activation by RBPMS-A, although RBPMS-B had minimal
activity in this context (Fig 7G). To confirm binding of RBPMS to the CAC motifs,
EMSAs and UV crosslinking were carried out with in vitro transcribed RNAs containing
the wild-type and mutant CAC clusters (Fig. 7F). RBPMS A and B were both able to

385

bind to the wild-type RNA at similar affinities as indicated by EMSA (Fig 7F upper
panels). Binding was modestly reduced by mutation of the first cluster, more severely
affected by mutation of the second cluster, and eliminated by combined mutation of
both clusters. UV crosslinking of RBPMS was inefficient with only a very faint signal
evident with wild type, but not mutant, probes (Fig. 7F lower panels). These data

390

therefore indicate that RBPMS directly activates Myocd exon 2a inclusion via
downstream CAC clusters.
Myocd exon 2a is repressed by binding of the RBP QKI to the 5’ end of the exon
(van der Veer et al., 2013). QKI is expressed more highly in proliferative SMCs (Llorian
et al., 2016; van der Veer et al., 2013) suggesting that RBPMS and QKI could act

395

antagonistically on AS events during phenotypic switching. To test for functional
antagonism we co-transfected the Myocd minigene with the two RBPs in HEK293 cells
(Fig. 7H). QKI strongly antagonized RBPMS activitation of exon 2a inclusion, even at
low concentrations, showing it to be the dominant regulator (Fig 7H). Thus, splicing of
Myocd exon 2a, and thereby the transcriptional activity of Myocd, is under the

400

antagonistic control of RBPs that are preferentially expressed in differentiated
(RBPMS) or proliferative (QKI) SMCs.

Discussion
Using super-enhancers to identify master splicing regulators
405

By focusing on RBPs whose expression is driven by super-enhancers (Jangi & Sharp,
2014) we identified RBPMS as a key regulator of the differentiated SMC AS program,
with many of the criteria expected of a master regulator: i) it is highly up-regulated in
differentiated SMCs (Fig. 1, Fig. S1). Indeed, single cell RNA-Seq identified Rbpms
as part of a transcriptome signature of contractile mouse aorta SMCs cells (Dobnikar

410

et al., 2018); ii) changes in RBPMS activity appear to be solely responsible for 20% of
the AS changes between differentiated and proliferative PAC1 cells (Fig. 3); iii)
RBPMS target splicing events are enriched in functionally coherent groups of genes
affecting cell-substrate adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton, which are important for
SMC cell phenotype-specific function (Fig. 5); iv) it regulates splicing and activity of

415

other post-transcriptional regulators in SMCs (Fig. 6), and v) it regulates splicing of the
key SMC transcription factor MYOCD (Fig. 7) to an isoform that promotes the
contractile phenotype (van der Veer et al., 2013).
RBPMS is reported to be a transcriptional co-activator (J. Fu et al., 2015; Sun
et al., 2006). However, we did not observe changes in expression levels of SMC

420

marker genes upon RBPMS knockdown or overexpression and changes in RNA
abundance were outnumbered by regulated AS events (Fig. 2). As a splicing regulator
RBPMS can only affect actively transcribed genes, so it is unlikely to be sufficient to
initially drive SMC differentiation. Notably, we identified RBPMS using superenhancers mapped in adult human tissues (Hnisz et al., 2013). Combined with the

425

ability of RBPMS to promote AS patterns characteristic of fully differentiated tissue
SMCs, such as in Cald1, Fermt2 and Tns1 (Fig. 3F,G), this suggests that RBPMS

plays a key role in maintaining a mature adult SMC phenotype. Consistent with a role
in promoting a fully differentiated state, in other cell types RBPMS has anti-proliferative
tumor-suppressive activity (J. Fu et al., 2015; Hou et al., 2018; Rastgoo, Pourabdollah,
430

Abdi, Reece, & Chang, 2018).
RBPMS is an alternative splicing regulator
RBPMS and RBPMS2 (referred to as Hermes in Xenopus) are present across
vertebrates, while the related proteins Drosophila Couch Potato and C. elegans MEC8 bind to similar RNA sequences (Soufari & Mackereth, 2017). RBPMS and RBPMS2

435

can localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus, but apart from transcriptional co-regulation
(J. Fu et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2006) most attention has been paid to cytoplasmic roles
in mRNA stability (Rambout et al., 2016), transport (Hornberg et al., 2013) and
localization in cytoplasmic granules (Farazi et al., 2014; Furukawa, Sakamoto, &
Inoue, 2015; Hornberg et al., 2013). RBPMS2 interacts with eukaryote elongation

440

factor-2 (eEF2) in gastrointestinal SMCs, suggesting translational control (Sagnol et
al., 2014). MEC-8 was reported to regulate splicing of Unc-52 in C. elegans (Lundquist
et al., 1996), but otherwise RBPMS family members have not been reported to
regulate splicing. PAR-CLIP with over-expressed RBPMS in HEK293 cells revealed
its preferred binding site, but accompanying mRNA-Seq did not identify regulated AS

445

events associated with PAR-CLIP peaks (Farazi et al., 2014). Using rMATS to reanalyse the RNA-Seq data of Farazi et al, we found a small number of regulated AS
events, including the Flnb H1 exon (Fig. 4C-F). We readily detected specific binding
of RBPMS to target RNAs by EMSA, but UV crosslinking was inefficient, even with
purified protein and in vitro transcribed RNA (Figs. 4F,J, 7F). This suggests that CLIP

450

might significantly under-sample authentic RBPMS binding sites. Nevertheless, the
functional binding of RBPMS to Flnb, Tpm1 and Myocd RNAs (Figs 4, 7), the strong
enrichment of dual CAC motifs with RBPMS-regulated exons (Fig 4A), and distinct
positional signatures for activation and repression of splicing (Fig. 4A,B), indicate that
RBPMS acts widely to directly regulate splicing in differentiated SMCs. While earlier

455

reports have shown that RBPMS can act in other steps in gene expression, our data
provide the strongest evidence to date for a widespread molecular function of RBPMS
as a splicing regulator.
Cell-specific splicing programs are usually driven by more than one regulatory
RBPs. A number of splicing regulatory RBPs are known to promote the proliferative

SMC phenotype, including QKI, PTBP1, and SRSF1 (Llorian et al., 2016; van der Veer
et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2017). The extent to which these proteins coordinately regulate
the same target ASEs remains to be established. RBPMS and QKI antagonistically
regulate at least two targets in addition to Myocd (Fig. 7). The Flnb H1 exon is activated
by RBPMS (Fig. S2, Fig. 4) and repressed by QKI (J. Li et al., 2018), while the

465

penultimate exon of Smtn is repressed by RBPMS (Fig. S2E) but activated by QKI
(Llorian et al., 2016). Moreover, QKI binding motifs are significantly associated with
exons regulated during SMC dedifferentiation, and with exons directly regulated by
RBPMS overexpression or knockdown (data not shown). It is therefore an interesting
possibility that RBPMS and QKI might target a common set of ASEs perhaps acting

470

as antagonistic master regulators of differentiated and proliferative SMC phenotypes.
The two RBPs show reciprocal regulation of expression levels during SMC
dedifferentiation (Fig. S1D), which combined with antagonistic activities could lead to
switch like changes in many ASEs. For Myocd splicing, QKI appears to have dominant
activity, driving skipping of exon 2a even when RBPMS is present at higher levels (Fig.

475

7G), so full inclusion of exon 2a requires the presence of RBPMS and absence of QKI.
The logic of this regulatory input can explain inclusion of Myocd exon 2a in SMC and
skipping in cardiac muscle and is consistent with the observation that RBPMS is superenhancer associated both in vascular SMCs and heart left ventricle, while QKI is
super-enhancer associated in left ventricle but not differentiated SMCs. Notably, QKI

480

also controls a significant fraction of ASEs regulated during myogenic differentiation
of skeletal muscle cells, but it promotes differentiated myotube AS patterns (Hall et al.,
2013), in contrast to its promotion of dedifferentiated splicing patterns in SMCs.
Activity of RBPMS isoforms
RBPMS was originally characterized as a human gene that encoded multiple isoforms

485

of an RBP (Shimamoto et al., 1996), but differential activity of common RBPMS
isoforms has not previously been reported. Human RBPMSA and B have similar
activity for co-regulation of AP1 transcriptional activity (J. Fu et al., 2015) although a
third human-specific isoform had lower activity. We found differential activity of
RBPMSA and B upon some ASEs (Figs. 4,7). In general, RBPMSA has higher activity

490

particularly for repressed targets (Fig. 4F, Fig. S4A, B). The differential activity was
seen with similar levels of overall expression, although we could not rule out the
possibility of variation in nuclear levels as GFP-tagged RBPMS was predominantly

18
cytoplasmic. Nevertheless, some ASEs were differentially responsive to RBPMSA or
B while others responded equally (e.g. compare MPRIP with ACTN1, Fig. S4A). The
495

differential activity upon Tpm1 splicing could not be accounted for by differences in
RNA binding by RBPMSA or B (Fig. 4F,H). Therefore, it is possible that RBPMS
repressive function depends on other interactions mediated by the 20 amino acid
RBPMSA C-terminal (Fig 1C). While the RRM domain is sufficient for RNA binding
and dimerization in vitro (Sagnol et al., 2014; Teplova et al., 2016), previous studies

500

have shown the extended C terminal region downstream of the RRM domain to be
involved in several aspects of RBPMS/RBPMS2 function including granular
localization in retinal ganglion cells (Hornberg et al., 2013) and interaction with cFos
in HEK293 cells (J. Fu et al., 2015). In vitro assays suggested that the C-terminal
region increases RNA binding affinity and possibly the oligomeric state of RBPMSA

505

(Farazi et al., 2014) and the C-terminal 34 amino acids of Xenopus RBPMS2 is
required for binding to Nanos1 RNA in vivo (Aguero et al., 2016). In preliminary studies
we have also found the C-terminal region to be essential for splicing regulation (data
not shown). Future work will aim to address the mechanisms of RBPMS splicing
activation and repression as well as isoform-specific differential activity.

510
RBPMS targets numerous mRNAs important for SMC function
SMC phenotypic switching involves interconversion between a contractile phenotype
and a motile, secretory, proliferative state (Owens et al., 2004). The actin cytoskeleton
and its connections to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via focal adhesions are central to
515

the function of both cell states, but with contrasting outcomes: tissue-wide contraction
or independent movement of individual cells. RBPMS-mediated AS plays a major role
in remodelling the actin cytoskeleton, the integrin adhesome (Horton et al., 2015) and
ECM components in the two cell states. This is reflected in the similar GO terms shared
by RBPMS regulated AS events and the entire PAC1 cell AS program (Fig. 5, Fig. S5).

520

The importance of many of the RBPMS target genes to SMC function is further
indicated by their proximity to super-enhancers in SMC tissues (Fig. 5B,C). Indeed,
three targets - ACTN1, FLNB and TNS1 - are all super-enhancer associated, interact
directly with both actin and integrins and are components of distinct axes of the
consensus integin adhesome (Horton et al., 2015). ACTN1 is a major hub in the

525

network of proteins affected by RBPMS (Fig. 5C). The AS event in ACTN1 produces a
functional Ca2+-binding domain in the motile isoform, but lack of Ca2+ binding in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/563304; this version posted March 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

19
differentiated isoform stabilizes ACTN1 containing structures in contractile cells
(Waites et al., 1992). Many other RBPMS regulated AS events have not previously
been characterized. Focal adhesion complexes and the integrin adhesome are
530

mechanosensitive complexes that connect the cytoskeleton and ECM, and are hubs
of regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation signalling. We found a small network of RBPMS
regulated AS events in the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRF (Fig 2E) and two
interacting proteins PPFIA1 and PPFIBP1 (Fig. S2E). Another focal adhesion
associated target is PIEZO1 (Fig. 2E), a mechanosensitive ion channel that is

535

important in SMCs during arterial remodelling in hypertension (Retailleau et al., 2015).
An RBPMS repressed exon lies within the conserved Piezo domain immediately
adjacent to the mechanosensing “beam” (Liang & Howard, 2018). ECM components
affected by RBPMS include fibronectin (FN1), which interacts directly with integrins,
and HSPG2 (Fig. S2E). Notably, HSPG2 ( also known as Perlecan) is the basement

540

membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is the identified splicing target of MEC-8
in C. elegans (Lundquist et al., 1996).
In addition to direct regulation of numerous functionally related targets, by
directly targeting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators RBPMS has the
potential for more widespread action (Figs. 6,7). RBPMS regulated events in MBNL1

545

and 2 modulate their splicing regulatory activity (Sznajder et al., 2016; Tabaglio et al.,
2018; Tran et al., 2011). Changes in secondary AS targets are challenging to observe
in a short duration overexpression experiment. Nevertheless, the modest change in
NCOR2 splicing appears to be attributable to an RBPMS-induced switch to less active
MBNL isoforms (Fig 6F). The regulated event in LSM14B (Fig 6G-I) also has the

550

potential to regulate mRNA stability, or an as yet uncharacterized nuclear role of
LSM14B (Kirli et al., 2015).
We also identified the SMC transcription factor as a direct target of RBPMS (Fig. 7). A
similar role has been shown for the proposed myogenic AS master regulator RBM24
(Jangi & Sharp, 2014), which stabilizes mRNA of the transcription factor Myogenin by

555

binding to its 3'UTR (Jin, Hidaka, Shirai, & Morisaki, 2010). Similarly, by activating
inclusion of Myocd exon 2a (Fig. 7), RBPMS directs production of a Myocardin isoform
that more potently promotes the differentiated SMC phenotype (van der Veer et al.,
2013). Additional effects upon transcription could also be conferred by RBPMS
activation of the FLNB H1 exon (Fig. S2E, Fig. 4). FLNB is primarily an actin binding

560

and adhesion protein, but inclusion of the H1 hinge domain allows nuclear localization

and antagonism of the transcription factor FOXC1 in epithelial cells (J. Li et al., 2018).
FOXC1 and FOXC2 are expressed at higher levels in adult arteries than any other
human tissue (Consortium, 2013). The modulation by RBPMS of FLNB isoforms
therefore provides another route for indirect transcriptome regulation. The importance
565

of Filamin RNA processing in SMCs by adenosine to inosine editing of FLNA was also
recently highlighted by the cardiovascular phenotypes arising from disruption of this
editing (Jain et al., 2018). A number of splicing regulators also influence miRNA
processing (Michlewski & Caceres, 2019), so it is an interesting possibility that RBPMS
might affect processing of SMC miRNAs such as miR143-145 (Boettger et al., 2009;

570

Cordes et al., 2009).
RBPMS2 plays an important role in SMCs of the digestive tract. The RBPMS2
gene is associated with super-enhancers in stomach smooth muscle (Supplementary
File 1) and is expressed early in visceral SMC development and at lower levels in
mature cells (Notarnicola et al., 2012). Ectopic RBPMS2 overexpression led to loss of

575

differentiated contractile function via translational upregulation of Noggin (Notarnicola
et al., 2012; Sagnol et al., 2014). This contrasts with our observations that RBPMS
exclusively promotes differentiated SMC AS patterns. RBPMS2 is expressed at low
levels in PAC1 and primary aorta SMCs (Fig 1) and its knockdown was without effect.
Nevertheless, ectopic expression of RBPMS2 in PAC1 or HEK293 cells promoted

580

differentiated SMC AS patterns in a similar manner to RBPMSA (Fig. 4, Fig. S4),
suggesting that RBPMSA and RBPMS2 have intrinsically similar molecular activities.
The reasons for the apparent discrepancy between the promotion by RBPMS2 of
differentiated SMC splicing patterns, but de-differentiated visceral SMC phenotypes,
remain to be resolved. Possible explanations include variations in cell-specific

585

signalling pathways, pre-mRNA and mRNA targets, interacting protein partners, posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization, all of which could differentially
modulate RBPMS and RBPMS2 activity in different SMC types.
In conclusion, our data vindicate the proposal that tissue-specific AS master
regulators might be identified by the association of their genes with superenhancers

590

(Jangi & Sharp, 2014), paving the way for the identification of further such regulators
in other tissues. While our data suggest that RBPMS has a critical role in SMCs, it is
likely to play important roles in other cell types where its expression is also superenhancer driven, including cardiac muscle and embryonic stem cells. Our approach
aimed to identify AS master regulators common to diverse smooth muscle types

(vascular, bladder, stomach). However, SMCs show a great deal of diversity (Fisher,
2010), even within single blood vessels (Cheung, Bernardo, Trotter, Pedersen, &
Sinha, 2012). The splicing regulator Tra2 b is responsible for some splicing differences
between tonic and phasic SMCs (Shukla & Fisher, 2008), and it is possible that other
RBPs might act as master regulators of some of these specialized SMC types. Our

600

future studies aim to understand the mechanisms of splicing regulation by RBPMS,
the role of the RBPMS regulated splicing program in controlling different aspects of
SMC phenotype and the potential role of subversion of this program in cardiovascular
diseases.

and into EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pCI-neo-3x-FLAG vector (Rideau et al., 2006) to
generate N-terminal Venus and 3xFLAG tagged in vivo overexpression constructs.
The two major Rbpms isoforms identified were RBPMS A (XM_006253240.2/
XP_006253302.1) and RBPMS B (NM_001271244.1/ NP_001258173.1). QKI
construct has been described in a previous study (Llorian et al., 2016).
Splicing reporters of Tpm1 exon 3 and Actn1 exon NM and SM were described in
(Gooding et al., 2013; Gromak et al., 2003). Myocd exon 2a and Flnb exon H1 splicing
reporters were obtained by PCR amplification of the target exons and respective
flanking intron regions from genomic PAC1 DNA, approximately 250 bp upstream and
downstream for Myocd and 500 bp for Flnb. PCR products were subsequently cloned
into XhoI/EcoRV and NotI/SphI sites of pCAGGs-EGFP vector, which contains a GFP
expression cassette with an intron inserted into its second codon (Wollerton, Gooding,
Wagner, Garcia-Blanco, & Smith, 2004). Point mutations of the CAC motifs in the
splicing reporters were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides that contained A to
C mutations. Intronic regions containing CACs from Tpm1, Flnb and Myocd were PCR
amplified and cloned into HindIII/EcoRI sites of pGEM4Z (Promega) for in vitro
transcription. DNA constructs were confirmed by sequencing. All the oligonucleotides
used for cloning and mutagenesis are found in Supplementary File 6.

Cell culture, transfection and inducible lentiviral cell line
Rat PAC1 pulmonary artery SMCs (Rothman et al., 1992) were grown to a more
differentiated or proliferative state as described in (Llorian et al., 2016). HEK293T cells
were cultured following standard procedures. Rbpms siRNA mediated knockdown in
PAC1 cells was performed as in (Llorian et al., 2016). Briefly, 105 differentiated PAC1
cells were seeded in a 6 well plate. After 24 hours, cells were transfected using
oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) and 90 pmols of Stealth siRNAs from Thermo
Fisher Scientific (siRNA1: RSS363828, GGCGGCAAAGCCGAGAAGGAGAACA). A
second treatment was performed after 24 hours using lipofectamine2000 (Thermo
Fisher) and siRNA at the same concentration of the first treatment. Total RNA and
protein were harvested 48 hours after the second knockdown. C2 scrambled siRNA
was used as a control in the knockdown experiments (Dharmacon, C2 custom siRNA,
AAGGUCCGGCUCCCCCAAAUG). For Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 siRNA knockdown, the
Mbnl1 THH2 siRNA (CACGGAAUGUAAAUUUGCAUU) and Mbnl2 specific siRNA
(Dharmacon, GAAGAGUAAUUGCCUGCUUUU) were used (Gooding et al., 2013).
3xFLAG N-terminally tagged rat RBPMSA cDNA was cloned into pInducer22
(Meerbrey et al., 2011) using the Gateway system. Generation of stable PAC1 cell
lines with pInducer22 vector only (LV) or pInducer22-RBPMSA was done as follows.
Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells by transient transfection using 30
µl of Mirus TransIT-lenti (MIR6604), 7 µg 3xFLAG tagged RBPMSA cDNA and 0.75
µg of the packaging plasmids gag, pol, tat & VSV-G transfecting 2 x 106 cells per 10
cm dish. After 24 hours the medium was transferred to 4oC and replaced with fresh
medium. After a further 24 hours the medium was removed, pooled with the first batch,
spun at 1000 g for 5 minutes and filtered through 0.45 micron PVDF filter. Lentiviral
particles were diluted 1:2 with fresh DMEM medium containing Glutamax, 10% FBS
and 16 µg/ml polybrene and used to replace the medium on PAC1 cells plated 24
hours earlier at 104/35mm well, setting up 2 wells for pInducer22 vector only and 6
wells for RBPMSA. Fresh medium was added 24 hours later and the populations
amplified as necessary. To induce expression of 3xFLAG RBPMSA the cells were
plated at 4 x 105 cells per 35 mm well ± 1µg/ml doxycycline harvesting RNA and protein
24 hours later.
For transient transfections of HEK293 cells with splicing reporters and effectors,
lipofectamine 2000 reagent was used and cells harvested 48 hours after transfection.
To verify knockdown and transfection efficiency, total cell lysates were obtained by

directly adding protein loading buffer to the cells. Lysates were run on a SDS-PAGE,
followed by western blot against RBPMS and loading controls. See Supplementary
File 6 for information on the antibodies used in this study. To monitor changes in
splicing and mRNA abundance, RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma)
according to manufacturer’s instructions, DNase treated with Turbo DNA-free kit
(Thermo Fisher) and cDNA synthesized, as described below, followed by PCR and
QIAxcel or qRT-PCR analysis.
qRT-PCR and RT-PCR
cDNA was prepared using 1 μg total RNA, oligo(dT) or gene-specific oligonucleotides
and SuperScript II (Life technologies) or AMV RT (Promega) as described in
manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR reactions were prepared with 50 ng of cDNA,
oligonucleotides for detection of mRNA abundance and SYBER Green JumpStart Taq
Ready Mix (Sigma). Three-step protocol runs were carried out in a Rotor-Gene Q
instrument (QIAGEN). Analysis was performed in the Rotor-Gene Q Series Software
1.7 using the Comparative Quantitative analysis. To normalize the relative expression
values, two housekeeper genes were included in each experiment (Gapdh and Rpl32)
and their geometric mean used for normalization. Expression values were acquired
from biological triplicates.
PCRs with 50 ng of the prepared cDNAs were carried out to detect the different mRNA
splicing isoforms of the reporters using the oligonucleotides detailed in Supplementary
File 6. For visualization and quantification of the PSI values, PCR products were
resolved in a Qiaxcel Advanced System (QIAGEN) and PSI calculated within the
QIAxcel ScreenGel software. A minus RT cDNA, representative of each triplicate, and
a no template PCR reactions were also included in all the experiments (data not
shown). Statistical significance was tested as previously described for gene
expression (paired Student t-test for lentiviral experiments). PSI values are shown as
mean (%) ± standard deviation (sd). For lentiviral RBPMSA overexpression, DPSI
values determined by RT-PCR were derived from at least three independent
transductions, and no events responded to doxycycline treatment in cells transduced
with the empty pINDUCER22 vector (Figure S2D). Statistical significance was tested
by a two-tailed Student’s t test, paired for lentiviral experiments and unpaired for all
the others (* P< 0.05, ** P<0.01, *** P<0.001).

Immunostaining
For immunodetection of RBPMS in PAC1 cells, differentiated and proliferative cells
were grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 minutes, rinsed
with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and permeabilised with 0.5% NP-40 for 2 minutes
followed by PBS washes. Coverslips were incubated with blocking buffer (1% BSA in
PBS) for 1 hour and incubated with RBPMS primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer
for another hour. Coverslips were rinsed and secondary antibody in blocking buffer
applied to the coverslips which were incubated for 1 hour. Coverslips were washed
and mounted on ProLong Diamond Antifade with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All
the steps were carried out at room temperature. Images were acquired from a
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Ax10, 40X) attached to CCD AxioCam and analysed
on AxioVision (v4.8.2).
RNAseq analyses
Total RNA from three biological replicates of RBPMS knockdown in differentiated
PAC1 and three populations of RBPMS inducible overexpression in proliferative PAC1
cells were extracted for RNAseq. Cells were lysed with TRI-reagent and total RNA
purified by Direct-zol purification column (Zymo Research) followed by DNase
treatment. RNAseq libraries of polyA selected RNAs were prepared with NEBNext ultra
II RNA library prep kit for Illumina. Both RNA and RNAseq libraries were checked for
their qualities. Barcoded RNAseq libraries were then multiplexed across two lanes of
an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform for sequencing on a 150-bp paired-end mode,
providing around 60 million reads per sample.
To investigate AS changes in vascular smooth muscle dedifferentiation, rat aortas
were isolated from 8-12 weeks old Wistar rats. Aortas were briefly treated for 30
minutes at 37oC with 3 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma C-0130) to help in cleaning away
the adventitia. The tissue was finely chopped and either used directly to make tissue
RNA or enzymatically dispersed to single cells. This was achieved by treating the
tissue pieces with 5 ml 1 mg/ml elastase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation
LS002292) for 30 minutes at 37oC and then 5 ml collagenase added for a further 1-2
hours. Cells were washed & counted and plated at 4 x 105 cells/ml in M199 media
containing 10%FBS, 2 mM Glutamine and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin in a
suitable dish according to the cell number. To promote the proliferative state, SMCs
were 1:2 passaged switching to DMEM media containing Glutamax and 10% FBS and

harvested at passage 9. For RNAseq, total RNA was harvested from three replicas,
each a pool of 5 rats, from rat aorta tissue (T), enzymatically dispersed single cultured
SMCs (SC), passage 0 (P0) and passage 9 (P9). Total RNA extraction was carried
out with Tri-reagent (Sigma). Libraries for mRNAseq were prepared using Ribozero
and TrueSeq kits and sequencing performed on a HiSeq2000 platform in a paired-end
mode.
mRNA abundance analysis
Read trimming and adapter removal were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.36
(Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014). Reads were aligned using STAR version 2.5.2a
(Dobin et al., 2013) to the Rat genome Rnor_6.0 release-89 obtained from Ensembl
and RSEM package version 1.2.31 (B. Li & Dewey, 2011) was used to obtain gene
level counts. mRNA abundance analysis, was carried out with DESeq2 package
(version 1.18.1) (Love et al., 2014) within R version 3.4.1 (https://www.r-project.org/).
Genes were considered to be differential expressed with p-adj less than 0.05 in the
paired analysis (Supplementary File 2).
AS changes analysis
rMATS v3.2.5 (Shen et al., 2014) was used for detection of differential alternative
splicing. rMATS analysis was carried out allowing for new splicing event discovery
using the flag novelSS 1. rMATS calculates the inclusion levels of the alternative
spliced exons and classifies them into five categories of AS events (Fig. S2B): skipped
exons (SE), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 5¢ and 3¢ splice sites (A5SS
and A3SS) and retained intron (RI). Before further analysis, the results from reads on
target and junction counts were filtered to include only events with a total of read counts
above 50 across the triplicates in at least one of the conditions compared. Removal of
events with low counts discarded false positive events. Only ASE with an FDR less
than 0.05 were considered significant and a minimal inclusion level difference of 10%
imposed to significant AS events. Finally, to identify specific AS events, unique IDs
were created using the AS type, gene name and the chromosomal coordinates of the
regulated and flanking exons (Supplementary File 3).
For visualization of differentially spliced exons, sashimi plots were generated using
rmats2sashimiplot (Gohr & Irimia, 2018). The sashimi plots show the RNAseq

coverage reads mapping to the exon-exon junctions and Psi values from rMATS.
Twenty eight ASE identified by rMATS in the RBPMS knockdown or overexpression
were also validated by RT-PCR in the same manner as described in the qRT-PCR and
RT-PCR section. DPsi predicted from the RNAseq analysis and the DPSI observed in
the

For comparison and visualization of the overlap between the genes with different
mRNA abundance and the genes differentially spliced in the RBPMS knockdown,
RBPMS overexpression and the PAC1 dedifferentiation, proportional Venn diagrams
were made using BioVenn (Hulsen, de Vlieg, & Alkema, 2008). Venn diagrams were
also generated for the visualization of the common AS events across RBPMS
knockdown, overexpression and the PAC1 or aorta tissue dedifferentiation datasets.
RBPMS motif enrichment analysis
RBPMS motif enrichment analyses in the regulated cassette exons (SE) of RBPMS
knockdown and overexpression, PAC1 and Aorta tissue dedifferentiation were
performed using the toolkit MATT (Gohr and Irimia, 2018). Cassette exons in
transcripts identified by rMATS with significant changes (FDR < 0.05 and |DPSI| >
10%) were used to test enrichment or depletion of CACN1-12CAC RBPMS recognition
element (Farazi et al., 2014), against a background set of unregulated exons defined
as events with FDR > 0.1 and |DPSI| < 5%. 250 bp of the flanking intronic regions were
examined for RBPMS motif signals. The motif enrichment scores were first obtained
using the test_regexp_enrich command of the Matt suite in the quant mode with
statistical significance determined using a permutation test with 50,000 iterations. This
module inherently divides the examined regions (exons or 250bp of the introns) into
thirds and provides positional information for the occurrence of the RBPMS motif.
RNA maps for distribution of the RBPMS motif were generated using the rna_maps
command in the Matt suite. Here the unregulated set of exons was randomly
downsampled to include a final background of 2000 events only. Additionally, the
program was instructed to scan only 135 bp of the cassette exon and 250 bp at either
end of the flanking introns. A sliding window of 31 was used for scanning the motif and
the statistically significant regions (p < 0.05) for enrichment or depletion were identified
by the permutation tests specifying 1000 iterations.

Gene ontology and PPI analysis
Enrichment for gene ontology terms in the differentially abundant and spliced genes
were obtained from Gorilla (Eden, Navon, Steinfeld, Lipson, & Yakhini, 2009). Two
unranked lists of genes, target and background lists, were used for the GO analysis.
The target list contained either the significant differential abundant genes (p-adj < 0.05
and log2 Fold Change greater than 1 or less than -1) or the significant differentially
spliced genes (FDR < 0.05 and DPsi threshold of 10%). Background gene lists were
created for the PAC1 experiments and aorta tissue by selecting the genes whose
expression were higher than 1 TPM in either of the conditions analyzed. For
visualization, only the top 5 enriched GO terms of each category (biological process,
cell component and molecular function) were shown in Figure 5A and Figure S5. The
complete list of enriched terms in differentially spliced and abundant genes can be
found in Tables S4 and S5.
A Protein-protein interaction network for the genes differentially spliced by RBPMS
was constructed using the STRING v10.5 database (Szklarczyk et al., 2017). RBPMS
regulated genes were obtained by merging two lists: i) overlap of genes concordantly
differentially spliced in the RBPMS knockdown and PAC1 experiments and, ii) overlap
of genes concordantly differentially spliced in the RBPMSA overexpression and the
aorta tissue datasets that were shown to be regulated in the same range in both
conditions. A cut off of DPsi greater than 10% was also applied to the RBPMS
regulated gene list, similar to the GO analysis. The human database was chosen for
the analysis and the following parameters applied to the PPI network: confidence as
the meaning of the network edges, experiments and database as the interaction
sources and high confidence (0.700) as the minimum required interaction score.
STRING functional enrichments, using the whole genome as statistical background,
were also included for visualization. Human super-enhancer associated genes from
Supplementary File 1 were highlighted.
Recombinant protein
Rat RBPMS A and B with a 3xFLAG N terminal tag were cloned into the BamHI/XhoI
sites of the expression vector pET21d, for expression of recombinant RBPMS
containing a T7 N-terminal tag and a His6 C-terminal tag in E. coli. Recombinant

RBPMS A protein was purified using Blue Sepharose 6 and HisTrap HP columns
whereas RBPMS B was purified only through the latter, since low binding was
observed to Blue Sepharose 6. The identity of purified recombinant proteins was
confirmed by western blot (Fig. S4G) and mass mapping by mass spectrometry.
In vitro transcription and binding
a32P-UTP labelled RNA probes were in vitro transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase.
For EMSAs, a titration of the recombinant RBPMS A and B (0, 0.125, 0.5 and 2 µM)
was incubated with 10 fmol of in vitro transcribed RNA in binding buffer (10 mM Hepes
pH 7.2, 3 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM KCl) for 25 minutes at 30°C.
After incubation, samples were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. For UV-crosslinking
experiments, the same binding incubation was performed followed by UV-crosslink on
ice in a Stratalinker with 1920 mJ. Binding reactions were then incubated with RNase
A1 and T1 at 0.28 mg/ml and 0.8 U/ml respectively, for 10 minutes at 37°C. Prior to
loading the samples into a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, SDS buffer was added
to the samples which were then heated for 5 minutes at 90°C.
Statistical analysis
Analysis and quantification of RNAseq and RT-PCR experiments were described in
their respective sections with further information of the tests used in the different
experiments present in the figure legends. Graphics were generated in RStudio
