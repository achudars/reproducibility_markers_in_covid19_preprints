Abstract:
Disease-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles are thought to confer risk of developing autoimmunity by
favoring the presentation of select autoantigenic epitopes. However, identification of these
epitopes and the principles governing their presentation has been hindered by the imprecision of
currently available methods, which cannot fully recapitulate the complexity of human
pathophysiology. We present a natural antigen processing assay (NAPA), which overcomes these
limitations by studying the presentation of autoantigenic CD4+ T cell epitopes by monocytederived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) from patients. We applied this strategy to study the processing
and presentation of topoisomerase-1 (TOP1), a prevalent autoantigen in scleroderma that is
associated with lung fibrosis and high mortality. We found that a common set of 10 epitopes was
presented by mo-DCs from patients with diverse HLA-DR variants, including those not previously
associated with the disease. Sequence analysis revealed a shared peptide-binding motif within the
HLA-DR peptide binding grooves of patients who developed anti-TOP1 autoantibodies. In
addition, a subset of naturally presented TOP1 peptides were characterized by immunological
promiscuity, as they could bind to diverse HLA-DR peptide binding grooves. NAPA epitopes were
immunorelevant: they could stimulate autoreactive CD4+ T cells in patients, and the number of
epitopes recognized correlated with lung disease severity. These findings mechanistically
implicate presentation of a convergent set of TOP1 epitopes in the development of scleroderma
lung disease. Precise identification of autoantigenic epitopes is key to understanding the primordial
mechanisms for the loss of tolerance, studying disease-propagating autoreactive T cells, and
developing antigen-specific immunotherapy.

Introduction
Targeting of protein autoantigens by the adaptive immune system is a hallmark feature of
autoimmune diseases. As fundamental regulators of cellular and humoral immunity, CD4+ T cells
specific for self-proteins are implicated as central pathogenic drivers of these diseases(1). This is
highlighted by high-titer autoantibodies of the IgG subclass, indicative of CD4+ T helper cell
involvement, and strong genetic association with specific HLA-DRβ1 alleles observed in many
autoimmune disorders. Despite the recognized importance of autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells
in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, our current knowledge of autoreactive T cell epitope
specificity is limited, and even less is known about the mechanisms that govern the presentation
of autoantigenic epitopes by disease-associated HLA-DR molecules. This lack of understanding is
largely due to: 1) the complexity of studying disease in highly heterogeneous human populations;
2) limited access to patient biospecimens; and 3) the low sensitivity and high cost of currently
available methods for studying autoreactive T cells in humans. This has led to the reliance on
instructive animal models and the widespread use of in silico prediction algorithms or overlapping
peptide libraries for defining candidate autoreactive CD4+ T cell epitopes(2, 3). While
informative, these methods cannot recapitulate the nuances of human pathophysiology,
highlighting the need to approach autoantigenic CD4+ T cell epitope discovery by studying antigen
processing directly in patients.
Scleroderma, also called systemic sclerosis, is a complex autoimmune rheumatic disease
of unknown etiology, characterized by widespread vasculopathy, fibrosis of the skin and internal
organs(4), and immunological derangements, including the production of autoantibodies to
specific nuclear antigens(5). No existing animal model fully recapitulates the intricate
immunopathology of this condition. Anti-topoisomerase-I (TOP1) autoantibodies (ATA; also

known as anti-Scl-70) are present in 20-45% of patients with scleroderma and are associated with
diffuse skin involvement, pulmonary fibrosis and high mortality(6). ATA production in patients
with scleroderma is associated with specific HLA-DRB1 alleles, implicating CD4+ T helper cells
in driving immune responses to TOP1. TOP1-specific CD4+ T cells have been detected in the
peripheral blood of patients with scleroderma(7–10), are HLA-DR restricted, and their frequency
is associated with the presence, severity, and progression of lung fibrosis(11). Previous attempts
to define TOP1 epitopes in patients with scleroderma using overlapping peptide/protein fragment
libraries or peptides derived from in silico prediction have resulted in the identification of scattered
epitopes with unspecified biological and clinical significance(7–10). Therefore, although ATAassociated HLA-DRB1 alleles have been defined and TOP-I-specific CD4+ T cells have been
detected in ATA-positive patients, the identification of the TOP1 epitopes driving the autoimmune
process has remained elusive.
To overcome current limitations related to the identification and study of autoreactive T
cell epitopes, we developed a method for identifying the repertoire of naturally processed TOP1
peptides presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) obtained from patients with scleroderma.
This approach has innovative features compared to traditional epitope-discovery methods, as it
harnesses the cellular MHC class II antigen processing machinery to identify naturally presented
peptides, without requiring pre-defined knowledge about the target peptide length or HLA status.
Our analysis of naturally presented TOP1 peptides has revealed unexpected insights into the
pathogenesis of scleroderma and identified a discrete set of clinically relevant TOP1-specific
CD4+ T cell epitopes that may inform future development of antigen-specific diagnostic and
therapeutic tools.

Results
Identification of naturally processed TOP1 peptides
We developed a natural antigen processing assay (NAPA) to identify TOP1 peptides
presented by MHC class II molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) from patients
with scleroderma. As a source of patient-specific APCs, monocytes were isolated from the
peripheral blood of 6 ATA-positive patients with scleroderma and cultured in the presence of GMCSF and IL-4 to generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs). Mo-DCs were then pulsed
with the whole TOP1 protein to allow for internalization and processing. HLA-DR-peptide
complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation (experimental workflow outlined in Fig. 1). The
HLA-DR bound peptides were then eluted, separated by size exclusion, and sequenced by mass
spectrometry.
NAPA identified hundreds of naturally processed peptides, deriving from TOP1 as well as
from other self-proteins (Fig. 2 and Table S1). The median length of these peptides was 15 amino
acids. Clustering into nested sets of variable length peptides around a common core sequence was
common (Table S1). These are features typical of naturally processed MHC class II peptides,
which tend to be 13-25 amino acids long and exist in nested sets (12, 13). As expected, pathway
analysis of the naturally processed peptides showed that the majority of these peptides were
derived from proteins involved in antigen processing (Fig. 2B). Further analysis of the peptides
presented between individuals revealed an enrichment of peptides from proteins expected to traffic
through the secretory pathway, where MHC class II antigen processing occurs (Fig. 2C). These
including membrane-associated (e.g. ITGAM and MRC1) and secreted proteins (e.g. TGFBI and
TIMP3), as well as other MHC molecules. Importantly, the only antigen commonly presented by
all 6 patients was the pulsed antigen TOP1, demonstrating the ability of NAPA to detect peptides
from exogenous proteins. The specificity of NAPA for detecting HLA-DR-bound peptides,

including those derived from TOP1, was confirmed using unpulsed mo-DCs and isotype control
antibodies for immunoprecipitation (Tables S2 and S3). In these experimental conditions, no TOP1
peptides were detected.
Remarkably, we observed a substantial overlap in TOP1 peptides presented by ATApositive scleroderma patients, with all subjects presenting peptides originating from only 10
discrete 13-23 amino acid long regions of the TOP1 molecule (Fig. 3A). The median number of
putative regions presented by each individual patient was 4 (range 1-7), and 70% were presented
by at least two subjects. The 10 regions from which TOP1 peptides were presented are from
diverse domains in the TOP1 protein and largely reside within structural elements, most
dominantly alpha helices flanked by unstructured loops on the surface of the TOP1 protein (Fig.3A
and B). The localization of putative TOP1 epitopes within structural elements adjacent to flexible
loops is similar to what has been observed for CD4+ T cell epitopes derived from other infectious
and self-antigens(14, 15). Using NAPA, we successfully identified a common set of TOP1
peptides derived from the whole TOP1 protein, which were naturally processed and presented by
HLA-DR molecules in mo-DCs generated ex vivo from patients with ATA-positive scleroderma.

Shared motifs present in HLA-DRβ chains of patients with ATA-positive scleroderma
We next performed HLA immunogenetic analysis to determine if the presentation of
common TOP1 peptides identified in our patients was due to the presence of shared HLA-DRB1
alleles. Despite the known association of ATA with specific HLA-DRB1 alleles (i.e. HLADRB1*11:01, *11:04, *08:02, *08:04, or *15:02)(16), only 3 subjects (50%) harbored a previously
defined risk allele. While these 3 patients concurrently presented peptides from more regions of
the TOP1 molecule compared to those who did not exhibit a known ATA-associated HLA-DRB1
allele (median 6 vs. 1), common peptides were presented regardless of the allele status.

Given this unexpected ability of diverse HLA-DR variants to present common TOP1
peptides, we sought to determine if similar features were present in the HLA-DRβ chains of ATApositive scleroderma patients. To explore this, we performed amino acid sequence alignment of
the HLA-DRβ variants linked to the development of ATA-positive scleroderma(16) and compared
them to the HLA-DRβ chains in these patients. This analysis revealed two conserved motifs within
the DRβ-chain encoded for by the HLA-DRB1 alleles most strongly linked to ATA(17–20) (HLADRB1*08:02, *08:04, *11:01, *11:04): 9E-Y-S-T-S/G-E14 and 67F-L-E-D-R-R-A-A/L74 (Fig. 4A).
HLA-DRβ1*15:02, associated with ATA in Asian populations(16), had a similar 67I-L-E-Q-A-RA-A74 motif but a distinct sequence at position 9-14 (9W-Q-P-K-R-E14) (Fig. 4A). Importantly,
these two motifs contain key peptide contact residues at positions 9, 11, 13, 14 and 67, 70, 71, 74
respectively (Fig. 4B).
Analysis of the HLA-DRβ chains present in patients who did not have previously defined
ATA-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles, but were able to present common TOP1 peptides, revealed
several conserved features. HLA-DRβ1*15:01 and *16:01 contained motifs at positions 9-14 and
67-74 that were identical to known ATA-associated alleles (Fig. 4A). HLA-DRβ1*04:01 and
*04:02 were less similar, but had conserved amino acids at known peptide contact positions (i.e.
9, 14, and 67, 70, 74). A more detailed analysis of β-chain residues that comprise the five major
peptide binding pockets in the HLA-DR groove (denoted as P1, P4, P6, P7, and P9) confirmed that
ATA-associated and homologous alleles have highly similar peptide binding pockets (Fig. 4C).
Interestingly, HLA- DRβ1*09:01 and *07:01 were divergent from ATA-associated alleles at
several critical peptide contact residues (Fig. 4, A and C). HLA- DRβ1*07:01 has been reported
to be protective against scleroderma development(21). While all the ATA-positive patients in our
study possessed at least one allele that contained ATA-associated motifs, those who harbored

HLA- DRβ1*09:01 and *07:01 presented the fewest number of TOP1 peptides (Fig. 3A). These
data reveal shared features in the peptide binding grooves of seemingly unrelated HLA- DRβ1
variants present in ATA-positive patients affected by scleroderma, highlighting their ability to
present a common set of TOP1 peptides.

Promiscuous binding of TOP1 peptides to multiple HLA-DR variants
To examine the intermolecular interactions between the commonly presented TOP1
peptides identified using NAPA and the HLA-DR variants detected in these patients, we used the
NetMHCII 2.3 algorithm to predict the peptide binding affinity and register(22). Since all of the
patients were heterozygous at the HLA-DRB1 locus, we examined the predicted binding of
peptides to both HLA-DR variants present in a given individual. This analysis revealed peptides
that could be categorized into two distinct groups, termed group A and B, based on their predicted
binding register (Fig. 5). Group A peptides (peptides 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10) were predicted to bind in
the same register to all associated HLA-DR variants. This is in contrast to group B peptides, which
were predicted to bind in different registers to multiple different HLA-DR variants. Group A
peptides were also predicted to bind with significantly lower affinity to their respective HLA-DR
molecules than Group B peptides (peptides 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) (4421 ± 1184 vs. 535 ± 276 nM;
p=0.013), and were presented by fewer individuals than group B peptides (median 1 vs. 3). This
suggests that group A peptides are relatively weak-binding peptides that contain a single core
epitope (e.g. LMKLEVQAT in peptide 10), whose anchor residues interact with shared features
present in the HLA-DR binding grooves of patients with ATA. In contrast, group B peptides appear
to contain multiple distinct epitopes, each possessing a unique set of anchor residues that enable
high-affinity interaction with a more diverse set of HLA-DR binding pockets (e.g. LSYNRANRA,

ILSYNRANR, and YNRANRAVA in peptide 7). Taken together, these data support a model of
convergent TOP1 peptide presentation in patients with scleroderma driven by shared peptidebinding motifs in the HLA-DR groove and a promiscuous group of TOP1 peptides.

Robust recognition of commonly presented TOP1 epitopes by CD4+ T cells in scleroderma
The discovery of a shared mechanism for the presentation of a core set of TOP1 peptides
suggests that these epitopes may be central to the disease process in patients with scleroderma. To
determine if these epitopes are immunologically relevant and recognized in ATA-positive patients,
we synthesized 10 peptides corresponding to the putative TOP1 epitopes identified using NAPA
(Fig. 3A; Table 1) and examined their ability to stimulate CD4+ T cells from 11 ATA-positive and
11 ATA-negative scleroderma patients (clinical variables are shown in Table S4). CD4+ T cell
activation, as measured by upregulation of the early activation marker CD154(11, 23), was
observed in response to at least one TOP1 peptide in 73% (8/11) of ATA-positive patients
compared to 27% (3/11) of ATA-negative individuals (Figure 6A, Table S5). ATA-positive
patients also responded concurrently to significantly more TOP1 peptides (median 2 vs. 0; p=0.02)
(Fig. 6B), particularly ATA-positive subjects with known disease-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles
(median 7 vs. 1.5). Recognition of group A and B peptides was observed regardless of ATAassociated allele status. For 6 out of the 11 ATA-positive patients (54%), the combined frequency
of CD154+ cells observed in response to the individual TOP1 peptides (Fig. S1) was comparable
to that measured in response to the whole TOP1 protein, suggesting the immunodominance of
these 10 naturally processed TOP1 peptides in these individuals. Robust recognition of this core
set of TOP1 peptides in immunogenetically diverse ATA-positive patients, supports our
observation that features on both sides of the peptide-MHC interaction contribute to the

development of a meaningful anti-TOP1 immune responses in patients with scleroderma.

Diversity of TOP1-specific T cell responses associated with ILD severity
Given the breadth of the TOP1-specific CD4+T cell response across multiple commonly
presented epitopes and known association of TOP1-specific CD4+ T cell frequency with ILD(11),
we examined whether the number of TOP1-epitopes recognized was associated with the severity
of ILD in ATA-positive patients with scleroderma. We evaluated the lowest forced vital capacity
(FVC) recorded during the course of clinical follow-up for each patient as a measure of the severity
of lung fibrosis. We focused this analysis on the 9 ATA-positive patients with radiographically
defined scleroderma-associated ILD. A significant negative association was observed between the
minimum FVC and the number of TOP1 epitopes that elicited a T cell response (p=0.025; Fig.
7A). While this relationship was also observed in response to whole TOP1 protein (p=0.002; Fig.
7B), it is remarkable that these 10 commonly presented epitopes were sufficient to identify T cell
responses associated with more severe lung disease. This implicates CD4+ T cells targeting
commonly presented TOP1 epitopes in the pathogenesis of scleroderma-ILD.

Discussion
Our study supports a mechanism for how immunogenetically diverse patients affected by
the autoimmune disease scleroderma can develop convergent immunologic and phenotypic
characteristics. We have successfully developed and employed a robust method for the
identification of biologically relevant naturally processed TOP1-specific CD4+ T cell
autoantigenic epitopes leveraging antigen-presenting cells obtained directly from patients. Our
data show that the presentation of a common set of TOP1 epitopes is shared by individuals with

distinct HLA-DR variants and define how unique features present on both sides of the “peptideHLA-DR interaction” synergize to drive this process. These findings, together with the observation
that the breadth of the CD4+ T cell responses to these TOP1 epitopes is associated with presence
and severity of lung fibrosis, offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of scleroderma.
Our study has shed light on one of the most proximal events in the stimulation of
autoreactive TOP1-specific T cells, the presentation of autoantigenic epitopes by ATA-associated
HLA-DR variants. We identified shared motifs in the peptide binding grooves of seemingly
unrelated HLA-DR variants found in patients with ATA-positive scleroderma (9E-Y-S-T-S/G-E14
and

67

F-L-E-D-R-A-A/L74) that enabled the presentation of a common set of TOP1 epitopes.

Importantly, the

67

F-L-E-D-R71 motif was previously identified by Kuwana et al. in 1993 and

hypothesized to be a common feature of alleles associated with ATA in different ethnicities(18,
19, 24), but the mechanism for this was unknown. Our data provide direct evidence that the
presence of HLA-DR alleles containing this or homologous sequences is associated with the
amplified presentation of a higher number of TOP1 peptides as well as with autoreactive CD4+ T
cell responses directed towards multiple TOP1 epitopes. The finding in scleroderma patients of
shared motifs in seemingly diverse alleles is analogous to the “shared epitope hypothesis”
proposed in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (25, 26). The “shared epitope” is a conserved amino
acid sequence (70R/Q-R/K-R-A-A74) present in the HLA-DRβ chain of a group of several HLADR variants that, collectively, exhibit a strong association with the development of rheumatoid
arthritis (25). The shared epitope is hypothesized to lead to the presentation of common
“arthritogenic” autoreactive peptides(27), though this has not yet been directly demonstrated. The
analysis in RA patients of naturally processed antigenic peptides following our experimental
approach (NAPA) may provide the evidence to confirm common arthritogenic peptide

presentation in patients with shared epitope alleles. Although the collective analysis of alleles
carrying a common motif has not yet been widely adopted for genetic studies in scleroderma, our
data provides strong evidence for a shared epitope-like motif in scleroderma and bolsters the
rationale for the use of such analyses in future studies.
The identification of the shared presentation of multiple TOP1 epitopes has also enabled
the definition of two distinct groups of TOP1 peptides that differ in their interaction with HLADR. Group A TOP1 peptides contain a single core epitope that is bound in the same register to
multiple HLA variants, likely interacting with elements in the peptide binding grove sharing
similar features. Group B TOP1 peptides contain multiple distinct epitopes that utilize different
anchor residues to bind to diverse HLA variants. While promiscuous peptides have been described
in the setting of cancer, infection, and mouse models of autoimmunity (28–32), to our knowledge
such peptides have not been described to be naturally presented in patients with autoimmunity.
Further biophysical studies are required to define the precise anchor residues responsible for
presentation of promiscuous TOP1 peptides in scleroderma, and to determine if this mechanism is
operative in other autoimmune diseases.
Although the study of natural antigen processing by mo-DCs revealed a set of
immunodominant TOP1 epitopes, this likely does not represent all of the TOP1 epitopes capable
of driving pathogenic anti-TOP1 immune responses in scleroderma. There are several technical
and biological explanations for this, including that NAPA may not have been able to capture TOP1
peptides that were presented at a low frequency or affinity, reflecting a finite sensitivity of the
assay. Moreover, while dendritic cells are the most effective antigen presenting cells in activating
T cell responses, other cells like macrophages and B lymphocytes express MHC class II processing
machinery and have the ability to present CD4+ T cell epitopes(33). Therefore, additional TOP1

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/798249; this version posted October 8, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

epitopes could be revealed by studying the processing of TOP1 by other antigen presenting cells.
In addition, presentation of unique autoantigenic epitopes has been observed in resident antigen
presenting cells present in disease target tissue in mouse models of diabetes, suggesting that
presentation of tissue-specific CD4+ T cell epitopes may also occur(34, 35). Despite the above
limitations, the discovery of immunorelevant TOP1 epitopes presented by mo-DCs and recognized
by autoreactive T cells in the majority of patients with ATA-positive scleroderma, likely mirrors
the critical role of dendritic cells in initiating a primary autoimmune response to TOP1.
The pathogenic relevance of the convergent presentation of TOP1 epitopes in patients with
scleroderma is illustrated by the detection of TOP1-specific CD4+ T cell responses to this core set
of epitopes in >70% of patients with ATA-positive scleroderma. We showed enrichment of TOP1epitope-specific T cells in ATA-positive compared to ATA-negative patients, and a significant
relationship between the number of TOP1 epitopes recognized and the severity of lung fibrosis.
Unique HLA-DR variants have been significantly linked to scleroderma, and in particular, to
specific disease manifestations such as ILD(36). Importantly, HLA-DRB1*11:01 has shown
association with ILD only in the presence of ATA. In a British cohort(37), the relative risk of
developing ILD in patients carrying HLA-DRB1*11:01 was 2.7 (statistically not significant), but
this increased to 15.8 in subjects with both HLA-DRB1*11:01 and positive ATA. Together with
the evidence provided by our study, this suggests a model where specific HLA variants are
mechanistically linked to the development of scleroderma ILD by favoring the selection of TOP1specific autoreactive T cells.
In our previous work, we have shown that the frequency of TOP1-specific CD4+ T cells is
associated with the severity of lung fibrosis(11). This new study extends that observation by
successfully defining the epitope-specificity of these autoreactive T cells. We demonstrate that a

core set of 10 TOP1 epitopes elicits robust specific T cell responses in the majority of studied ATA
positive scleroderma-ILD patients, with the breadth of epitopes recognized inversely associating
with lung function. This has significant clinical implications and may inform the development of
antigen-specific monitoring and therapeutic tools.
Tetramers made from MHC molecules bound to antigenic peptides can be used to identify,
track, and study antigen-specific immune responses over time in peripheral blood, as well as target
tissues (38). In scleroderma patients, TOP1 tetramers could therefore be a precise tool to study the
frequency and phenotype of TOP1 specific T cells ex vivo. Longitudinal studies in early
scleroderma cohorts will define whether the repertoire of TOP1 epitope-specific CD4+ T cells
changes over time and predicts onset or progression of fibrotic lung disease. This is an important
unmet need as ILD is among the leading causes of scleroderma-related mortality and no reliable
biomarkers is clinically available to predict early on the development and the clinical trajectory of
lung involvement(39). The core set of TOP1 epitopes identified in our investigation can also
represent viable candidates for the development of novel antigen-specific therapies. By
understanding the polyclonal nature of the autoimmune responses and the advances of medical
bioengineering, we can ensure the delivery of biologically relevant epitopes using tools like
nanoparticles or other carriers. Such therapies can induce the formation of antigen-specific
regulatory networks and have shown promise in pre-clinical models of autoimmune disease and
an increasing number of early phase clinical trials(40, 41).
In this work we successfully leveraged the natural antigen processing machinery of a
patient’s own antigen presenting cells to define immunorelevant CD4+ T cell epitopes of the
autoantigen TOP1. Our findings have implications for our understanding and conceptualization of
the development of autoreactive immune responses in scleroderma and other autoimmune

diseases. Rather than each individual presenting and recognizing a unique set of autoantigenic
peptides, our data supports an alternative model in which a convergent set of self-epitopes is
presented by diverse HLA-DR variants, leading to the development of similar autoimmune
responses and clinical features.

Materials and Methods

Patient Characterization
Patients in this study were drawn from an observational cohort of patients with scleroderma
followed at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center. All patients participating in this study met the
2013 Classification Criteria for Systemic Sclerosis or met at least 3 out of 5 criteria for CREST
(i.e. calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia)(42,
43). The Johns Hopkins institutional review board approved the study and all patients signed
written informed consent.
Six ATA-positive patients were recruited for NAPA. For T cell stimulation assays, 11
patients with ATA and 11 patients with either anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) or anti-RNA
polymerase 3 (ARA) antibodies, who were negative for ATA, were recruited for this study.
Demographic data, scleroderma subtype (limited versus diffuse skin disease)(43), autoantibody
specificities, disease duration from the time of first symptoms (Raynaud or non-Raynaud),
smoking status (current), and medication history at the time of the blood draw, were obtained from
the Scleroderma Center’s database. In order to capture the most developed disease phenotype, the
lowest FVC from the pulmonary function test results were utilized. FVC was standardized to age
and sex(44, 45). Any missing clinical information was obtained from a comprehensive review of
the electronic medical records. Patients were classified as having limited cutaneous scleroderma,

if scleroderma skin sclerosis was restricted to skin distal to the knees and elbows and/or the face,
and diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, if skin sclerosis involved the chest, abdomen, and/or proximal
extremities (i.e. thighs or upper arms)(43). The disease duration was calculated both from the first
non-Raynaud’s disease related symptom as well as from the first occurrence of Raynaud’s
phenomenon to the time of the serum sample processing. Gastrointestinal involvement was
considered present if Medsger score was equal or greater than 1(46). ILD was defined based on
evidence of pulmonary fibrosis on chest CT. Renal crisis was confirmed by renal biopsy in case
of an acute increase in blood pressure. Current immunosuppression was recorded at the time of the
blood sampling (prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide,
azathioprine, rituximab, tocilizumab). Clinical data are summarized in Table S4.

Natural antigen processing assay (NAPA)
Monocyte-derived dendritic cell differentiation and antigen-loading. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Plus,
GE Healthcare) from 40ml of whole blood obtained from 6 ATA-positive patients. CD14
MicroBeads were used to positively select CD14+ monocytes and cells were differentiated for 7
days into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs), using Mo-DC Differentiation Medium
(Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). Mo-DCs (2-5 x 106) were reconstituted at 2x106 cells/mL in Mo-DC
Medium and incubated overnight at 37oC in 5% CO2 with 400 ug of custom-made human
recombinant TOP1 protein purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (GenScript Biotech
Corp, Piscataway, NJ, USA). For control unpulsed experiments, mo-DCs were incubated
overnight in media alone.

Isolation of HLA-DR- peptide complexes. Antigen-pulsed mo-DCs were collected and washed
with cold buffer A (PBS, 2 mM EDTA; pH 7.4-7.6). The cells were then lysed in cold buffer B
(1% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated at 4o C on a rocking table
for 15 minutes. This lysis step was repeated, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation
at 14,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4o C. The supernatant containing the HLA-DR-peptide complexes
was incubated with Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with 20 ug of antiHLA-DR antibody (clone L243, BioLegend) at 4o C for one hour with inversion, per
manufacturer’s instructions. For the isotype control experiment, we used IgG2α, κ isotype control
antibody (LEAF Purified Mouse IgG2α, κ isotype control, Clone MOPC-173, BioLegend) in
parallel samples for immunoprecipitation. The beads were then washed 4-times with lysis buffer
B, and 3-times with buffer C (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). After this extensive washing,
the beads were incubated with 0.1% TFA for 1 minute at room temperature to elute the HLA-DRbound peptides. The eluate was collected and incubation with 0.1% TFA was repeated. The pooled
eluate was loaded onto a 10kD centrifugal filter (Microcon Centrifugal Filter Device, Merck
Millipore) and centrifuged at 14,000 x g until all of the fluid passed through. The filter was washed
with 0.1 % TFA and pooled flow-through was lyophilized by vacuum centrifugation.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis. Samples were reconstituted in 20 ul of 25% acetonitrile, 0.05%
formic acid, and interfering reagents were removed by strong cation exchange (SCX) on a “stage
tip”(47). Peptides were eluted from the SCX tip with 20 ul of 400mM ammonium bicarbonate in
25% acetonitrile and 0.05% formic acid and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were
resuspended by adding 4ul of 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, vortexing and diluting with 14
ul of 0.1% formic acid. The entire 18 ul sample was injected onto a 2 cm reverse phase trap (YMC

ODS-A 10um particles, 120 Angstroms Kyoto, Japan) and separated on a 75 nm x 20 cm reverse
phase column (Reprosil 3um particles, 100A pore size Ammerbuch-Entringen) using 2% to 90%
acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 90 mins at 300 nl/min on an EasyLC nanoLC
(Thermo Scientific) interfaced with Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
Eluting peptides were electrosprayed at 2kV, analyzed at 70K resolution (MS) and sequenced by
collisional dissociation (HCD) with peptide fragments analyzed at 35K resolution (MS2). Ion
target values for MS and MS2 were set at 3e6 and 1e5 with 100 and 150 milliseconds, respectively,
and a normalized collision energy of 28. Data files were searched against the 2017 RefSeq83
human database (which contains the TOP1 protein sequence, NP_003277) using PEAKS 7
(Bioinformatic Solutions, Inc.) with the following criteria: 5 ppm mass tolerance for peptide
masses; 0.02 daltons for peptide fragments; oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine
and glutamine as variable modifications. The database search was performed with no enzyme
designation since no exogenous enzyme was added to produce the peptides. The search results
were filtered at the 1% (false discovery rate) FDR level using the PEAKS decoy-fusion algorithm.
Histograms were created to determine the length distribution of HLA-DR bound peptides, and
peptides derived from keratin or dermcidin were excluded as likely artifactual contaminants.

HLA-DRB1 genotyping and sequence alignment
Whole blood was collected using PAXgene Blood DNA tubes and DNA was extracted
according to manufacturer’s instructions (PreAnalytiX). High-resolution HLA-DRB1 typing was
performed by next generation sequencing at the Johns Hopkins University Immunogenetics
Laboratory, as previously described(48). Amino acid sequences encoded for by the HLA-DRB1
alleles of interest were obtained using the online IMGT/HLA submission tools provided by the

Immune Polymorphism Database (IPD)(49, 50). Peptide contact and pocket residues in each HLADRβ1 chain were identified using the online MHC motif viewer(51). Sequence alignment and
consensus sequence visualization was performed using Jalview version 2.10.5 software(52).
Affinity and register of peptides for HLA-DR variants was predicted using the online NetMHCII
2.3 algorithm(22).

Protein Structure Images
Linear mapping of patient-specific TOP1 epitopes was plotted using R (R Core Team
(2018). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/.). The three-dimensional location
of TOP1 peptides identified using NAPA within the TOP1 protein crystal structure (1K4T) and
location of consensus peptide binding motifs within HLA-DR11 (6CPN) was visualized using the
PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 2.3 (Schrödinger, LLC).

T cell stimulation
Fresh PBMCs from randomly selected ATA-positive (n=11) and ATA-negative patients
(n=11) were isolated by Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Plus, GE Healthcare).
The cells were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% autologous serum,
transferred onto a 96-well plate (1.5 × 106 cells/well) and cultured at 37 °C, as previously
described(11, 23). Anti-human CD40 blocking antibody (1 ug/ml; G28.5, BioLegend) was added
to the cells in order to prevent CD154 internalization. PBMCs were then stimulated for 18 hours
using 2.5 uM of each candidate TOP1 peptide (Table 1), synthesized as free peptides with a purity
>95%, or 1.45 ug/mL human recombinanct TOP1 protein, purified from baculovirus-infected

insect cells (Genscript Biotech Corp). Following stimulation, cells were harvested, washed with
PBS and stained with BV510-conjugated anti-CD3 (OKT3, BioLegend), Pacific Blue-conjugated
anti-CD4 (RPA-T4, BD Pharmingen), APC-H7-conjugated anti-CD8 (SK1, BD Biosciencies), PE
–conjugated anti-CD154 (TRAP1, BD Pharmingen), and Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit
(Molecular Probes). The percentage of live CD4+ T cells that upregulated CD154 were quantified
by flow cytometry using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) instrument at Bayview Immunomics Core
Facility and analysis was conducted using FCS Express software, version 5 (De Novo Software).
Pie charts were calculated by subtracting the sum of %CD154+CD4+ T cell responses to TOP1
peptides defined as Group A peptides (TOP1 peptides 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10), and the sum of the
responses to Group B peptides (TOP1 peptides 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) from the %CD154+CD4+ T cell
responses to whole TOP1 protein. If the subtraction was >0, the remaining sum was defined as
other peptides.

Statistical analyses
The naturally presented peptides were analyzed using the PANTHER 14.1 gene list
analysis tool statistical overrepresentation test for “biological processes”. This was performed to
determine if the naturally processed peptides were derived from proteins involved in specific
processes and too identify those biological processes that were over-represented relative to the
human genome(53, 54). The “GO biological processes complete” annotation set was queried and
the FDR and Fisher’s exact p-value for each pathway was calculated. The median number of
peptides eliciting positive responses in ATA-positive versus ATA-negative patients was compared
using a Mann-Whitney test. A cutoff of greater than the 95th percentile of the responses observed
amongst the ATA-negative patients (%CD154+CD4+Tcells > 0.015%) was used to define a

positive CD4+ T cell response to antigen stimulation. The association between minimum FVC and
the number of stimulatory TOP1 epitopes was analyzed using the Spearman’s rho test. The
association between minimum FCV and the percentage of TOP1-specific CD154+CD4+ T cells
was analyzed using the Pearson’s r. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 7.03
(Graphpad) and Stata version 14.2 (Stata Corp) software. Statistical significance was defined as a
two-sided p-value ≤0.05 throughout.

Fig. 3. A common set of naturally processed TOP1 peptides was presented by scleroderma
patients with diverse HLA-DR variants (A) The HLA-DRB1 haplotype for each patient is
given and each colored line represents a unique TOP1 peptide sequence identified by mass
spectrometry. The location of the TOP1 peptides within the linear TOP1 protein sequence is
indicated. TOP1 protein domains and secondary structure elements are shown (β-strands and αhelices are represented by arrow heads and ovals, respectively). (B) The location of the naturally
processed TOP1 peptides within the three-dimensional crystal structure of the TOP1 molecule
bound to DNA (1K4T) is indicated. The peptides are colored-coded and correspond to the colors
used in panel A.

Fig. 4. Presentation of common TOP1 peptides linked to shared ATA-associated motifs in
the HLA-DRβ chain. (A) Amino acid sequence alignment of ATA-associated (top panel) and
non-associated alleles (bottom panel) is shown. The two consensus sequences identified in the
peptide-binding groove of ATA-associated alleles are shown (middle panel). Peptide contact
residues in the DRβ chain are shown (hydrophobic=blue, negative=purple, positive=red,
polar=green, glycine=orange, prolines=yellow, and aromatic=cyan) and their position within the
sequence is numbered, while intervening residues are shown in gray. The white text indicates
non-conserved residues. (B) A depiction of HLA-DR11 bound to peptide (6CPN) is shown with
the peptide binding groove: DR α-chain residues (light gray), DR β-chain (dark gray) and peptide
(magenta). The 9E-Y-S-T-S/G13 and 67F-L-E-D-R-R-A-A/L74 motifs are shown in cyan and
yellow, respectively. (C) Peptide contact residues for each MHC binding pocket and the relevant
consensus sequence for ATA-associated (light blue), homologous (orange) and heterologous
(black) alleles are represented. Different shades of gray indicate the importance of each peptide
residue to peptide binding, with dark gray being the most critical.

Figure 5. Allele-specific TOP1 peptide binding registers may contribute to promiscuous
presentation by diverse HLA-DR variants. (A) Group A TOP1 peptides (peptides 1, 2, 8, 9
and 10) and (B) group B TOP1 peptides (peptides 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) are aligned according to their
predicted binding registers as per NetMHCII algorithm with relevant anchor residues highlighted
in gray. The HLA-DRB1 alleles are color-coded as ATA-associated (light blue), homologous
(orange) and heterologous (black) alleles, and ordered from highest to lowest predicted affinity
for each peptide. TOP1 peptides with a predicted binding affinity of <500 nM are indicated with
red text, and are expected to represent moderate to high affinity peptides(22).

Fig. 6. Distribution of CD4+ T cell responses to naturally presented TOP1 epitopes in
scleroderma. (A) %CD154+CD4+ T cell responses over background observed with media alone
for 11 ATA-positive and 11 ATA-negative scleroderma patients for each of the 10 naturally
processed TOP1 peptides identified using NAPA are shown. The dotted line represents the cutoff
for positivity that was defined as >95th percentile of the T cell responses observed in ATAnegative patients (95th percentile=0.015%). Each unique colored symbol represents a different
patient. (B) The number of peptides eliciting a response in ATA-positive (n=11) and ATAnegative (n=11) scleroderma patients is shown (Mann-Whitney, p=0.02). A p-value <0.05 was
considered significant throughout. Open symbols represent patients that possess at least one
previously defined ATA-associated HLA-DRB1 allele.

Fig. 7. Clinical significance of CD4+ T cell responses to naturally presented TOP1 epitopes
in scleroderma. The minimum FVC (% of expected) was plotted against (A) the number of
TOP1 epitopes eliciting a T cell response and (B) the percentage of CD154+CD4+ T cells
responses elicited against the whole TOP1 protein in ATA-positive scleroderma patients with
clinically documented ILD (n=9). The correlation between minimum FVC and the number of
stimulatory TOP1 epitopes was analyzed using a Spearman’s rho test, and the correlation with
the magnitude of the T cell responses to the TOP1 protein was analyzed using a Pearson’s r test.
A p-value <0.05 was considered significant throughout.
