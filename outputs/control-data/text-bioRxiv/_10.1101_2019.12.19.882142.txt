Abstract:

32

Elsinoë fawcettii, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, causes citrus scab on numerous citrus

33

varieties around the world. Known pathotypes of E. fawcettii are based on host range;

34

additionally, cryptic pathotypes have been reported and more novel pathotypes are thought

35

to exist. E. fawcettii produces elsinochrome, a non-host selective toxin which contributes to

36

virulence. However, the mechanisms involved in potential pathogen-host interactions

37

occurring prior to the production of elsinochrome are unknown, yet the host-specificity

38

observed among pathotypes suggests a reliance upon such mechanisms. In this study we

39

have generated a whole genome sequencing project for E. fawcettii, producing an

40

annotated draft assembly 26.01 Mb in size, with 10,080 predicted gene models and low

41

(0.37%) coverage of transposable elements. The assembly showed evidence of AT-rich

42

regions, potentially indicating genomic regions with increased plasticity. Using a variety of

43

computational tools, we mined the E. fawcettii genome for potential virulence genes as

44

candidates for future investigation. A total of 1,280 secreted proteins and 203 candidate

effectors were predicted and compared to those of other necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea,

46

Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and

47

Zymoseptoria tritici), hemibiotrophic (Leptosphaeria maculans, Magnaporthe oryzae,

48

Rhynchosporium commune and Verticillium dahliae) and biotrophic (Ustilago maydis) plant

49

pathogens. Genomic and proteomic features of known fungal effectors were analysed and

50

used to guide the prioritisation of 77 candidate effectors of E. fawcettii. Additionally, 378

51

carbohydrate-active enzymes were predicted and analysed for likely secretion and sequence

52

similarity with known virulence genes. Furthermore, secondary metabolite prediction

53

indicated nine additional genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome biosynthesis gene

54

cluster than previously described. A further 21 secondary metabolite clusters were

55

predicted, some with similarity to known toxin producing gene clusters. The candidate

56

virulence genes predicted in this study provide a comprehensive resource for future

57

experimental investigation into the pathogenesis of E. fawcettii.

Introduction:

60

Elsinoë fawcettii Bitancourt & Jenkins, a necrotrophic fungal species within the Ascomycota

61

phylum (class Dothideomycetes, subclass Dothideomycetidae, order Myriangiales), is a

62

filamentous phytopathogen which causes a necrotic disease, known as citrus scab, to the

63

leaves and fruit of a variety of citrus crops around the world. Susceptible citrus varieties

64

include lemon (Citrus limon), rough lemon (C. jambhiri), sour orange (C. aurantium),

65

Rangpur lime (C. limonia), Temple and Murcott tangors (C. sinensis x C. reticulata), Satsuma

66

mandarin (C. unshiu), grapefruit (C. paradisi), Cleopatra mandarin (C. reshni), clementine

67

(C. clementina), yuzu (C. junos), kinkoji (C. obovoidea), pomelo (C. grandis) and

Jiangjinsuanju (C. sunki) [1-9]. Numerous pathotypes of E. fawcettii are defined by host

69

range, including the Florida Broad Host Range (FBHR), Florida Narrow Host Range (FNHR),

70

Tyron’s, Lemon, Jinguel, SRGC and SM, while cryptic and novel pathotypes are also reported

71

[1, 3, 10]. Only the Tyron’s pathotype (which infects Eureka lemon, Rough lemon,

72

clementine, Rangpur lime and Cleopatra mandarin) and the Lemon pathotype (which only

73

infects Eureka lemon, Rough lemon, Rangpur lime) have been described in Australia [2, 3,

74

7], however E. fawcettii has reportedly been isolated from kumquat (Fortunella sp.), tea

75

plant (Camellia sinensis) and mango (Mangifera indica) [11], indicating a wider range of

76

pathotypes to be present in Australia. Additional species of Elsinoë found causing disease in

77

Australia include E. ampelina, which causes anthracnose to grapes [12] and two E. australis

78

pathotypes; one which causes scab disease to jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) [13] and a

79

second found on rare occasions on finger lime (C. australasica) in Queensland forest areas

80

[14]. Species of Elsinoë causing crop disease in countries neighbouring Australia include

81

E. batatas, which causes large yield losses in sweet potato crops in Papua New Guinea [15,

82

16] and E. pyri, which infects apples in organic orchards in New Zealand [17]. Around the

83

world there are reportedly 75 Elsinoë species, the majority of which appear to be host

84

specific [18]. While citrus scab is not thought to affect yield, it reduces the value of affected

85

fruit on the fresh market. Australia is known for producing high quality citrus fruits for local

86

consumption and export, and so understandably, there is great interest in protecting this

87

valuable commodity from disease.

88
89

E. fawcettii is commonly described as an anamorph, reproducing asexually. Hyaline and

90

spindle shaped conidia are produced from the centre of necrotic citrus scab lesions [19, 20].

91

Conidia are dispersed by water splash, requiring temperatures between 23.5-27 °C with four

92

hours of water contact for effective host infection. Therefore, disease is favoured by warm

93

weather with overhead watering systems or rain [21]. Only young plant tissues are

94

vulnerable to infection; leaves are susceptible from first shoots through to half expanded

95

and similarly fruit for 6 to 8 weeks after petal fall, while mature plants are resistant to

96

disease [19]. Cuticle, epidermal cells and mesophyll tissue are degraded within 1 to 2 days

97

of inoculation, hyphal colonisation proceeds and within 3 to 4 days symptoms are visible

98

[20, 22]. After formation of necrotic scab lesions on fruit, twigs and leaves, conidia are

99

produced from the scab pustules providing inoculum for further spread. Within 5 days, host

100

cell walls become lignified separating infected regions from healthy cells, which is thought

101

to limit internal spread of the pathogen [20]. The necrosis that occurs during infection is

102

produced in response to elsinochrome, a well-known secondary metabolite (SM) of species

103

of Elsinoë. Elsinochromes are red or orange pigments which can be produced in culture [23,

104

24]. In aerobic and light-activated conditions, reactive oxygen species are produced in

105

response to elsinochromes in a non-host selective manner, generating an environment of

106

cellular toxicity [25]. Elsinochrome production is required for full virulence of E. fawcettii,

107

specifically the EfPKS1 and TSF1 genes are vital within the elsinochrome gene cluster [26,

108

27]. However, two points indicate that E. fawcettii pathogenesis is more complex than

109

simply the result of necrotic toxin production: (I) the production of elsinochrome appears to

110

be variable and does not correlate with virulence [28]; and (II) elsinochrome is a non-host

111

selective toxin, yet Elsinoë species and E. fawcettii pathotypes cause disease in a host

112

specific manner. Host-specific virulence factors targeted for interaction with distinct host

113

proteins to overcome immune defences, prior to elsinochrome production, could explain

114

the observed host specificity. Candidate virulence genes may include effectors and cell wall

115

degrading enzymes. Effectors are secreted pathogen proteins, targeted to either the host

116

cytoplasm or apoplast, which enable the pathogen to evade recognition receptor activities

117

of the host’s defence system and, if successful, infection proceeds. Resistant hosts,

118

however, recognise pathogen effectors using resistant (R) genes which elicit plant effector-

119

triggered immunity and pathogenesis is unsuccessful [29, 30]. While it was previously

120

thought that necrotrophic fungal pathogens would use only a repertoire of carbohydrate-

121

active enzymes (CAZymes) or SM’s to infect host plants [31], there is increased awareness of

122

their utilisation of secreted protein effectors [32-37], highlighting the importance of protein

123

effector identification in all fungal pathogens. Frequently shared features of effectors

124

include; a signal peptide at the N-terminal and no transmembrane helices or

125

glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Other features less frequently shared include;

126

small size, cysteine rich, amino acid polymorphism, repetitive regions, gene duplication, no

127

conserved protein domains, coding sequence found nearby to transposable elements, and

128

absence in non-pathogenic strains [38-45]. Furthermore, some appear to be unique to a

129

species for example the necrosis-inducing protein effectors NIP1, NIP2 and NIP3 of

130

Rhynchosporium commune [46] and three avirulence effectors AvrLm1, AvrLm6 and

131

AvrLm4-7 of Leptosphaeria maculans [47]. Others have orthologous genes or similar

132

domains in numerous species for example the chorismate mutase effector, Cmu1, of

133

Ustilago maydis [48] and the cell death-inducing effector, MoCDIP4, of Magnaporthe oryzae

134

[49]. Understandably, with such a large variety of potential features, effector identification

135

remains challenging. Effectors are found in biotrophs, for example U. maydis [50-53],

136

hemibiotrophs, such as L. maculans [54-56], M. oryzae [57, 58], R. commune [46] and

137

Verticillium dahliae [59-61], necrotrophs, for example Botrytis cinerea [62, 63],

138

Parastagonospora nodorum [34, 42, 64], Pyrenophora tritici-repentis [65], Sclerotinia

139

sclerotiorum [32] and also the hemibiotroph/latent necrotroph Zymoseptoria tritici [66].

140

Genomic location has potential to be an identifying feature of virulence genes in some

141

species, for example pathogenicity-related genes of L. maculans, including those coding for

142

secreted proteins and genes potentially involved in SM biosynthesis, are found at higher

143

rates in AT-rich genomic regions in comparison to GC-equilibrated blocks [47]. It is thought

144

that effectors and their target host proteins co-evolve, in a constant arms race [67],

145

presenting genomic regions with higher levels of plasticity as potential niches which harbour

146

effector genes.

147
148

Another group of virulence factors likely to play a role in E. fawcettii pathogenesis are cell

149

wall degrading enzymes (CWDE), these are CAZymes, including glycoside hydrolases,

150

polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases, which can be secreted from fungal

151

pathogens and promote cleavage of plant cell wall components [68-70]. Cell wall

152

components, such as cellulose, hemicelluloses (xyloglucan and arabinoxylan) and pectin

153

(rhamnogalacturonan I, homogalacturonan, xylogalacturonan, arabinan and

154

rhamnogalacturonan II) [71], are targets for pathogens to degrade for nutrients and/or to

155

overcome the physical barrier to their host. CWDE’s can include polygalacturonases, pectate

156

lyases, and pectinesterases which promote pectin degradation [72-78], glucanases (also

157

known as cellulase) which breaks links between glucose residues [79] and xylanases which

158

cleave links in the xylosyl backbone of xyloglucan [80-82].

159
160

E. fawcettii effectors and/or CWDE’s which interact with certain host plant cell wall

161

components could explain the observed host specificity of pathotypes. Computational

162

prediction of genes coding for such virulence factors can lead to many candidate effectors

163

(CE) and potential CWDE’s, leading to an overabundance of candidates which require

prioritisation. This study aimed to generate an assembly of the E. fawcettii isolate, BRIP

165

53147a, through whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, to identify candidate virulence

166

genes and appropriately shortlist these predictions to improve the focus of future

167

experimental validation procedures. Computational methods involving genomic, proteomic

168

and comparative analyses enabled the prediction and prioritisation of CE’s and CWDE’s

169

which may be interacting with the host plant and overcoming immune defences prior to the

170

biosynthesis of elsinochrome. Additional genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome

171

gene cluster were also predicted, as were additional SM clusters which may be impacting

172

virulence of E. fawcettii.

173

174

Materials and Methods:

175

Sequencing, assembly, gene prediction, annotation and genomic analyses:

176

E. fawcettii (BRIP 53147a), collected from C. limon (L.) Burm.f. in Montville, Queensland,

177

Australia, was obtained from DAF Biological Collections [11]. The isolate was cultured on

178

potato dextrose agar (Difco) and incubated at 23 to 25 °C for two months. Whole genomic

179

DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the

180

manufacturer’s protocol. Paired-end libraries were prepared according to Illumina

181

NexteraTM DNA Flex Library Prep Reference Guide using a NexteraTM DNA Flex Library Prep

182

Kit and NexteraTM DNA CD Indexes. WGS sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq

183

platform (600-cycles) at the molecular laboratories of the Centre for Crop Health, USQ.

184

Assembly was performed on the Galaxy-Melbourne/GVL 4.0.0 webserver [83]. Raw reads

185

were quality checked using FastQC (v0.11.5) [84] and trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.36)

186

[85] with the following parameters: TruSeq3 adapter sequences were removed using default

187

settings, reads were cropped to remove 20 bases from the leading end and 65 bases from

188

the trailing end of each read, minimum quality of leading and trailing bases was set to 30, a

189

sliding window of four bases was used to retain those with an average quality of 30 and the

190

minimum length read retained was 31 bases. De novo assembly was performed in two

191

steps, first using Velvet (v1.2.10) [86] and VelvetOptimiser (v2.2.5) [87] with input k-mer size

192

range of 81-101 (step size of 2). Secondly, SPAdes (v3.11.1) [88] was run on trimmed reads

193

with the following parameters: read error correction, careful correction, automatic k-mer

194

values, automatic coverage cutoff and Velvet contigs (>500 bp in length), from the previous

195

step, included as trusted contigs. Contigs >500 bp in length were retained. Reads were

196

mapped back to the assembly using Bowtie2 (v2.2.4) [89] and Picard toolkit (v2.7.1) [90] and

197

visualised using IGV (v2.3.92) [91]. The genome assembly was checked for completeness

198

with BUSCO (v2.0) [92] using the Ascomycota orthoDB (v9) dataset [93]. The extent and

199

location of AT-rich regions was determined using OcculterCut (v1.1) [94] with default

200

parameters and mitochondrial contigs.

201
202

The prediction of genes and transposable elements (TE) was performed on the GenSAS

203

(v6.0) web platform [95], using GeneMarkES (v4.33) [96] for gene prediction and

204

RepeatMasker (v4.0.7) [97], using the NCBI search engine and slow speed sensitivity, for the

205

prediction of TE’s. Predicted gene models containing short exons, missing a start or stop

206

codon or which overlapped a TE region were removed from the predicted proteome. The

207

genome was searched for Short Simple Repeats (SSR) using the Microsatellite Identification

208

tool (MISA) [98], with the SSR motif minimum length parameters being 10 for mono, 6 for

209

di, and 5 for tri, tetra, penta and hexa motifs.

211

Annotation was performed using BLASTP (v2.7.1+) [99] to query the E. fawcettii predicted

212

proteome against the Swiss-Prot Ascomycota database (release 2018_08) [100] with an e-

213

value of 1e-06 and word size of 3. BLAST results were loaded into Blast2GO Basic (v5.2.1)

214

[101], with InterProScan, mapping and annotation steps being performed with default

215

parameters, except HSP-hit coverage cutoff was set to 50% to increase stringency during

216

annotation. Further annotation was achieved using HmmScan in HMMER (v3.2.1) [102] to

217

query the predicted proteome against the Protein Family Database (Pfam) (release 32)

218

[103]. GC% content of the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of each gene was determined using

219

nucBed from Bedtools (v2.27.1) [104]. Predicted proteins were searched for polyamino acid

220

(polyAA) repeats of at least five consecutive amino acid residues using the FIMO motif

221

search tool [105] within the Meme suite (v5.0.2) [106]. The Whole Genome Shotgun project

222

was deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession SDJM00000000. The version

223

described in this paper is version SDJM01000000. Raw reads were deposited under the SRA

224

accession PRJNA496356.

Phylogenetic Analysis:

227

ITS and partial TEF1α sequences of 12 E. fawcettii pathotypes, 11 closely related Elsinoë

228

species and Myriangium hispanicum were obtained from GenBank (accessions provided in

229

S1) for phylogenetic analysis with E. fawcettii (BRIP 53147a). Sequences for each locus were

230

aligned using MUSCLE [107] with a gap open penalty of -400, concatenated and used to

231

perform maximum likelihood analysis in MEGA7 [108] based on the General Time Reversible

232

233

the maximum likelihood analysis was automatically selected using Neighbor-Join and BioNJ

Prediction of secretome and effectors:

260

Secretome and effector prediction was performed on the predicted proteomes of

261

E. fawcettii and 10 fungal species known to contain effector proteins. Secretome prediction

262

for each species began with a set of proteins predicted as secreted by either SignalP (v4.1)

263

[122], Phobius [123] or ProtComp-AN (v6) [124]. This set was run through both the TMHMM

264

Server (v2.0) [125] and PredGPI [126] to predict proteins with transmembrane helices and

265

GPI-anchors, respectively. Those proteins with >1 helix or with 1 helix beyond the first 60

266

amino acids were removed, as were those with “highly probable” or “probable” GPI

267

anchors. Remaining proteins formed the predicted secretome and were subjected to

268

candidate effector prediction using EffectorP (v2.0) [121].

269
270

Genomic, proteomic and known effector analyses:

271

Sequences of 42 experimentally verified effector proteins, which showed >98% similarity to

272

proteins from the 10 species included in this study, and which appeared in both the

273

predicted secretome and candidate effector list for the respective species, were utilised in

274

the known effector analysis. The following analyses were performed on the

275

proteome/genome of each species. Results relating to the 42 known effectors were

276

compared to results of all proteins from each species. Length of the intergenic flanking

277

region (IFR) was determined as the number of bases between the CDS of two adjacent

278

genes. Median IFR values were determined in R (v3.5.1) [127]. Genes were labelled as gene-

279

dense if the IFR on each side was less than the median IFR length for that particular species,

280

genes on a contig edge were not included among gene-dense labelled genes. Genes with IFR

281

greater than the median on both sides were labelled as gene-sparse. SM clusters were

282

predicted by passing genome assemblies and annotation files through antiSMASH fungal

283

(v4.2.0) [128] using the Known Cluster Blast setting. Core, accessory and unique genes for

284

each species were determined by mapping proteins into ortholog groups using the

285

orthoMCL algorithm [129] followed by ProteinOrtho (v5.16b) [130] on remaining

286

unclassified genes. Core genes were those shared by all comparative species, accessory

287

genes were shared by at least two species, but not all, and unique genes were found in only

288

one species. GC% content of the CDS of each gene was determined as described above, Q1

289

and Q3 values were determined for each species using R [127]. HmmScan [102] of all protein

290

sequences against the Pfam database [103] was performed as described above. Genomic

291

AT-rich region identification was performed using OcculterCut (v1.1) [94] as described

292

above. For genomes with identified AT-rich regions, the distance between genes and their

293

closest AT-rich region edge was determined using Bedtools closestBed [104], as was the

294

distance between genes and the closest TE.

295
296

Prioritisation of candidate effectors:

297

CE’s of each species were prioritised using an optimised scoring system based on the

298

analysis of known effectors in 10 fungal species. All were scored out of at least five points,

299

corresponding to one point allocated for each of the following conditions: (I) not labelled as

300

gene-dense; (II) no involvement in predicted SM clusters; (III) labelled as either unique to

301

the species or allocated to the same orthoMCL group as a known effector; (IV) GC% of CDS

302

was either below the Q1 value or above the Q3 value of the respective species; and (V)

303

within 10 genes upstream or downstream was at least one gene coding for a protein with a

304

top Pfam ID hit from the following list: p450, Mito carr, FAD binding 3, FAD binding 4, Ras,

305

DUF3328, BTB, Peptidase M28, AA permease or AA permease 2. For species with genomes

306

which had >2% TE coverage or >25% AT-rich region coverage, CE’s were scored out of six

307

points. Those genomes which had both >2% TE and >25% AT-rich region coverage, CE’s were

308

scored out of seven points. Hence, all candidate effectors were scored out of n (five, six or

309

seven) points, those CE’s which obtained a score of n or n-1 points were labelled as

310

prioritised CE’s.

311
312

Prediction of other virulence genes:

313

SM clusters were predicted using antiSMASH fungal (v4.2.0) [128] as described above.

314

CAZymes were predicted by passing the predicted proteomes through the dbCAN2 meta

315

server [131] and selecting three tools including HMMER scan against the dbCAN HMM

316

database [132], Diamond [133] search against the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy)

317

database [134] and Hotpep query against the Peptide Pattern Recognition library [135].

318

Predicted CAZymes were taken as those with positive results for at least two out of the

319

three tools. Potential pathogenesis-related proteins were identified by querying the

320

predicted proteomes against the Pathogen Host Interactions Database (PHI-base) (v4.6,

321

release Oct 2018) [136] using BlastP (v2.7.1) [99] analyses with an e-value of 1e-06 and a

322

query coverage hsp of 70%, those results with >40% similarity were retained. Prioritised

323

candidate CWDE’s were shortlisted from the predicted CAZymes to those which were

324

predicted as secreted and obtained hits to plant associated fungal pathogenicity-related

325

genes in PHI-base which showed evidence of reduced virulence in knockout or mutant

326

experiments.

Results and Discussion

329

Genome assembly and features:

330

The genome assembly of E. fawcettii (BRIP 53147a), deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank

331

(accession SDJM00000000), was sequenced using paired-end Illumina WGS sequencing

332

technology. Assembly of reads produced a draft genome 26.01 Mb in size with a coverage of

333

193x (Table 1) and consisted of 286 contigs greater than 500 bp in length, with an N50 of

334

662,293 bp, a mean contig length of 90,948 bp and an overall GC content of 52.3%. Running

335

the assembly against the Ascomycota orthoDB (v9) [93] showed 97.6% of complete single

336

copy genes were found in the E. fawcettii assembly, indicating a high degree of coding DNA

337

sequence completeness. The genome of E. fawcettii is comparable in size to other fungal

338

genomes including Eurotium rubrum (26.21 Mb) [137], Xylona heveae (24.34 Mb) [138] and

339

Acidomyces richmondensis (29.3 Mb) [139], however it is smaller than the average

340

Ascomycota genome size of 36.91 Mb [140]. When analysed against the 10 fungal species

341

included in this comparative analysis (B. cinerea, L. maculans, M. oryzae,

342

Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, R. commune, V. dahliae,

343

S. sclerotiorum, U. maydis and Z. tritici), the E. fawcettii assembly is the second smallest,

344

after U. maydis at 19.6 Kb. TE identification, by analysis against Repbase (release 18.02)

345

[141], showed a coverage of only 0.37%, indicating a low proportion of the E. fawcettii

346

genome is represented by currently known TE’s, this is a likely contributor to its

347

comparatively small genome size. This low TE coverage may also be the result of a

348

fragmented genome [142]. It is possible, should long read sequencing of this isolate be

349

completed in the future, TE coverage may appear higher.

The E. fawcettii genome has less predicted gene models than the average Ascomycota

355

genome of 11129.45 [140]. Gene prediction produced 10,080 gene models, 5,636 (55.91%)

356

of which were annotated, while 4,444 (44.09%) were labelled as coding for hypothetical

357

proteins. The average gene length was 1,573 bp with an average of 2.35 exons per gene,

358

there were 3,280 single exon genes. The mean GC content of CDS was 54.7%, which was

359

2.4% higher than the overall GC content and showed a wide variation in range, with the

360

lowest scoring gene at 44.29% GC and the highest being 71.53%, thus exposing a spectrum

361

on which genes may be differentiated. Hmmscan [102] analysis of the predicted proteome

362

against the Pfam database [103] revealed a high proportion (70.1% = 7,069) of genes with at

363

least one hit to a Pfam model. The same analysis performed on the proteomes of the 10

364

fungal species included in the comparative analysis gave results ranging from 48.6% for

365

S. sclerotiorum, with the lowest proportion of Pfam hits, to 74.9% for U. maydis with the

366

highest, and a mean of 62.1% over the 11 species (S2).

367
368

Analysis of orthologous genes among E. fawcettii and the 10 comparative species indicated

369

3,077 (30.5%) of the predicted genes of E. fawcettii were core genes, finding hits through

370

OrthoMCL or ProteinOrtho in all 11 species (S2). There were 4,874 (48.4%) E. fawcettii genes

371

found in at least one other species but not all and were therefore considered accessory

372

genes. Lastly, the remaining 2,129 (21.1%) were found in only the E. fawcettii proteome,

373

140 of these, however, obtained a hit to an orthoMCL group and were therefore set aside

374

and not considered as unique proteins in subsequent analyses, leaving 1,989 (19.7%) genes

375

presumed to be Elsinoë-specific and therefore potentially involved in either Elsinoë- or

376

E. fawcettii-specific pathogenesis pathways. A comparative analysis among the core,

377

accessory and unique genes of the 11 species (S2) (Figure 1) indicated that U. maydis was

378

set apart from the other species by showing the lowest proportion of accessory genes, this

379

was expected as U. maydis was the only biotroph and Basidiomycete among the group.

380

E. fawcettii showed a below average percentage of unique genes which may be expected

381

due its smaller than average sized genome and proteome. A lower number of unique genes

382

may place a limitation on the ability of E. fawcettii to infect a larger range of host plants.

390
391

While the overall GC content of E. fawcettii was 52.3%, when taking AT-rich regions into

392

consideration, the average GC content of 98.97% of the genome was 52.8%, while the AT-

393

rich regions had an average GC content of 33.8%. AT-rich regions are sections of DNA that

394

are scattered throughout the genome and have a significantly higher AT content compared

395

to adjacent GC equilibrated blocks [94]. The presence of AT-rich regions in genomes varies

396

widely, for example S. sclerotiorum does not show evidence of AT-rich regions [143], while

397

36% of the L. maculans genome is covered by AT-rich regions which have an average GC

398

content of 33.9% [47]. AT-rich regions are thought to develop in, and nearby to, regions

399

containing TE repeats, through Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP), a mechanism used to

400

inhibit the destructive actions of TE’s against an organism’s genome. Through a fungal

401

genome defence mechanism causing cytosine to thymine polymorphisms, a TE repeat

402

sequence is inhibited from further movement and potential destruction of necessary genes.

403

This same type of polymorphism can also occur in genes nearby to TE regions [144-147],

404

potentially providing numerous genomic locations with increased plasticity scattered

405

throughout the genome. While RIP occurs during the sexual phase it has also been observed

406

in asexual fungi and is thought to indicate a species reproductive history or potential [148].

407

AT-rich regions are present within the E. fawcettii genome, however the extent of their

408

coverage in the present assembly is low, 59 regions with an average GC content of 33.8%

409

cover only 1.03% of the genome. Sixteen regions are found overlapping TE’s, while four are

410

found within 2 Kb of a TE region, meaning 33.9% of the AT-rich regions potentially represent

411

RIP-affected regions. The remaining 66.1%, found either >2Kb away or on a contig that does

412

not contain a predicted TE region, are potentially RIP-affected regions where the TE is no

413

longer recognisable. The AT-rich regions of E. fawcettii are not scattered evenly throughout

414

the genome, instead 29/59 (49.2%) are situated at the edge of a contig and 15/59 (25.4%)

415

cover the entire length of a contig, specifically contigs not containing genes. Two further AT-

416

rich regions were located between the edge of a contig and the beginning of the first gene

417

and so were grouped with those located at the edge of a contig. The remaining 13 regions

418

(22.0%) were situated within a contig with genes residing on both sides. Hence, the majority

419

either made up the edge of a contig which contained genes or filled entire contigs which did

420

not contain genes, meaning it is likely that the sequence of many E. fawcettii AT-rich regions

421

contain sections of such low complexity that contig breaks result, a hypothesis which could

422

be tested in the future using long read sequencing technology. Eight predicted genes at

423

least partially overlap these regions and 57 are located within 2 Kb, a finding which has

424

potential significance as AT-rich regions have been known to harbour effector genes in

425

fungal pathogens [149, 150]. There was a large range of diversity of AT-rich region coverage

426

among the fungal pathogens analysed in the current study; S. sclerotiorum,

427

Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, M. oryzae and U. maydis showed no AT-rich regions; V. dahliae

428

(1.5%), B. cinerea (4.9%), Parastagonospora nodorum (6.6%) and Z. tritici (17.3%) showed

429

lower degrees of AT-rich coverage; while R. commune (29.5%) and L. maculans (37%)

430

showed the greatest extent. These levels of AT-rich coverage did not appear to corelate

431

with pathogen classification as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic or biotrophic, nor as host-

432

specific or broad-host range pathogens. The genomic location of AT-rich regions was,

433

however, further included in the known effectors and candidate effectors analyses.

435

Identification and analysis of SSR’s in the E. fawcettii genome located 400 regions covering

436

6,868 bp (0.026%), 164 (41%) of which were contained within a predicted gene.

437

Furthermore, polyAA repeats, of at least five identical and adjacent residues, were identified

438

within 1,073 predicted protein sequences. The presence of repetitive sequences has been

439

noted in fungal effectors [33, 45, 151] and implicated in the function and evolution of

440

pathogenicity-related genes of other plant-associated microorganisms [152]. Analysis of the

441

1,105 proteins which obtained either an SSR or polyAA hit indicated 237 (21.45%) were

442

categorised as E. fawcettii-specific and did not obtain a Pfam hit, highlighting potentially

443

novel genus- or species-specific genes involved in host pathogenesis.

445

Phylogenetic analysis of partial ITS and TEF1-α regions of E. fawcettii (BRIP 53147a) in

446

comparison with other E. fawcettii isolates and closely related Elsinoë species (Figure 2)

447

indicates E. fawcettii (BRIP 53147a) closely aligns with the E. fawcettii clade. Substitutions

448

appearing in the Jingeul pathotype isolates are not seen in isolate BRIP 53147a. One G to A

449

substitution in the TEF1-α region sets isolate BRIP 53147a apart from the other E. fawcettii

450

isolates (S3), a base which is at the 3rd position of a Glu codon and hence does not result in a

451

translational difference. This substitution in the BRIP 52147a isolate appeared with a high

452

degree of confidence, 100% of sequence reads aligned back to the assembly and a coverage

453

of 241x, at this point, agreed with the substitution. While it is thought that isolate BRIP

454

53147a belongs to either the Lemon or Tyron’s pathotype, it is yet to be determined which

455

or if it constitutes a new pathotype of its own. Aside from the one base substitution in the

456

TEF1-α region, there would be some expected differences throughout the genomes of the

457

E. fawcettii BRIP 53147a isolate and the other E. fawcettii isolates due to differences in

458

collection details, such as geographical location, year and host specificity. Specifically,

459

isolate BRIP 53147a was collected in Montville, Queensland in 2009, while the other

460

Australian isolates, DAR 70187 and DAR 70024, belonging to the Lemon and Tyron’s

461

pathotypes, were collected 15 years earlier in Somersby and Narara in NSW, respectively

462

[7], both a distance of almost 1000 km away. Several isolates from Figure 2 have been

463

tested for host pathogenicity leading to the designation of specific pathotypes [3], as

464

opposed to relying on only sequence data and thus illustrating the importance of

465

experimental validation prior to pathotype or species classification. For example, Jin-1 and

466

Jin-6 are classified as the Jingeul pathotype, SM3-1 as FBHR, S38162 as FNHR, CC-132 as

467

SRGC, DAR 70187 and CC-3 as the Lemon pathotype, and DAR 70024 as Tyron’s pathotype

468

[3]. Host specificity experimentation for the E. fawcettii BRIP 53147a isolate is a suggested

469

future step, as is the whole genome sequencing and analysis of further E. fawcettii isolates

470

for comparison. The comprehensive host pathogenicity testing of 61 E. fawcettii isolates and

471

their subsequent classification into six pathotypes [3] coupled with genomic sequencing

472

data analysis would provide a wealth of knowledge of potential host-specific pathogenicity-

473

related genes and mutations.

482

Prediction of secretome and effectors:

483

A total of 1,280 genes (12.7% of the proteome) were predicted to code for secreted

484

proteins (SP) in the E. fawcettii genome (Table 2). Using the discovery pipeline outlined in

485

Figure 3, classically secreted proteins with a detectable signal peptide were predicted by

486

either SignalP and/or Phobius providing 1,449 proteins, while ProtComp identified a further

487

120 as potential non-classically secreted proteins. Of these 1,569 proteins 186 were

488

removed as they were predicted to contain transmembrane helices, an indication that while

489

targeted for secretion the protein likely functions while situated in the cell membrane. A

490

further 103 were removed as they contained a predictable GPI anchor, also suggesting they

491

associate with the cell membrane to perform their function, leaving a total of 1,280 proteins

492

identified as likely SP’s. To enable comparison of the species’ predicted secretomes and

493

CE’s, the same prediction pipeline (Figure 3) was used on the proteomes of 10 further fungal

494

species included in the analysis (Table 2), essentially utilising genomes which contain known

495

protein effectors for comparison. The proportion of predicted SP’s in the E. fawcettii

496

proteome was similar to that of other necrotrophic fungal pathogens, which ranged from

497

B. cinerea at 11.3% to Parastagonospora nodorum at 13.9%. It was, however, lower in

498

comparison to the hemibiotrophs; R. commune showed a low of 12.5% SP’s while M. oryzae

499

was the highest scoring at 18.5%, demonstrating a small increase in proportion of SP’s for

500

the hemibiotrophs compared to the necrotrophs. This potentially provides them with a

501

larger array of secreted proteins compared to biotrophs and necrotrophs, to first support a

502

biotrophic, and secondly a necrotrophic, host interaction.

Figure 3. Pipeline for the discovery of the predicted secretome and candidate effectors.

511

The secretome search started with the predicted proteins of a species, proteins were

512

predicted as secreted using at least one of three tools, proteins with predicted

513

transmembrane helices or GPI-anchors were removed. Candidate effectors were predicted

514

using EffectorP. The number of proteins shown for the predicted proteome, secretome and

515

effectome refers to the Elsinoë fawcettii BRIP 53147a genome.

516
517
518

Known effectors were frequently identified by the CE pipeline (Figure 3), with 43/45 (95.6%)

519

correctly predicted as being secreted and 42/45 (93.3%) also predicted as effectors (Table

520

2), highlighting the effectiveness of the pipeline among these fungal species. Those known

521

effectors which were tested but not identified as SP’s included Vdlsc1 (V. dahliae) and

522

MoCDIP2 (M. oryzae). Vdlsc1 lacks an N-terminal signal peptide and is unconventionally

523

secreted [153], however it was not identified as a non-classically secreted protein. MoCDIP2

524

was removed as it obtained a GPI-anchor hit. Additionally, Eff1-1 (U. maydis) was predicted

525

as secreted but not as a candidate effector, Eff1-1, along with MoCDIP2, are both known

526

false negatives of EffectorP 2.0 [121].

527
528

The total number of CE’s identified for E. fawcettii was 203, meaning only 15.9% of SP’s

529

gained CE classification, this was the lowest proportion out of all 11 species analysed (Table

530

2). This may be explained by the potential favouring of EffectorP towards SP’s of species on

531

which it was trained. To further investigate this potential, results of EffectorP for the 11

532

species were compared to the results of an alternate candidate effector search; SP’s with a

533

protein length less than the species’ median and with no Pfam hit other than to that of a

534

known effector (S4). While this second method resulted in the identification of a higher

535

number of CE’s for each species, E. fawcettii still obtained the lowest proportion of CE’s out

536

of predicted SP’s, indicating E. fawcettii may have a lighter dependence, compared to other

537

fungal pathogens, on protein effectors. It also highlighted the advantage of using EffectorP

538

to narrow down an extensive catalogue of SP’s, as opposed to identifying CE’s based on

539

arbitrary features. However, the CE’s predicted by EffectorP still range in the hundreds

540

(Table 2), it was therefore beneficial to further shortlist candidates for prioritisation. To

541

achieve this, known effectors which were correctly predicted as both SP’s and as CE’s (Table

542

2) were retained for further analysis to generate an optimised prioritisation scoring system.

543
544

Known effector analysis:

545

A total of 42 known effectors from 10 fungal species were analysed for; (I) gene density; (II)

546

GC content; (III) involvement in SM clusters; (IV) uniqueness; (V) Pfam hits of surrounding

547

genes; (VI) distance to the closest TE; and (VII) distance to the closest AT-rich regions (Table

548

3). Results were compared to those of all predicted genes from each of the same 10 species

549

(S5). Features observed at a higher rate among the known effector group compared with

550

each species’ proteome were used to generate a prioritisation pathway using a point

551

allocation system. (I) Genes were labelled as gene-dense if the IFR’s on both sides were less

552

than the IFR median value for that specific species, allowing an analysis relative to each

553

organism. The proportions of gene-dense genes ranged from 21.6% (Pyrenophora tritici-

554

repentis) to 28.0% (B. cinerea) (S5), in contrast to 3/42 (7.1%) known effectors (Table 3).

555

This provided grounds to allocate one point to each known effector which was not labelled

556

as gene-dense. (II) GC content of the CDS of each gene was determined and median values

557

calculated for each species, revealing the GC percentage of 32/42 (76.2%) known effectors

558

fell either below the Q1 value or above the Q3 value for the respective species. When

559

compared to an expected 50% in the upper and lower quartiles, this provided reason for the

560

allocation of one point to known effectors should they fall in these two quartiles. (III) No

561

overlap was observed between known effectors and the predicted SM clusters within each

562

species, giving strong reason for the allocation of one point to known effector’s that were

563

not included in SM clusters. (IV) Analysis of gene classification (core, accessory or unique)

564

for each known effector highlighted that 41/42 (97.6%) were either unique to the species

565

(31/42) or were assigned an orthoMCL group ID of a known effector (10/42). In contrast, the

566

proportion of unique genes for each species was much lower, ranging from 11.9%

567

(B. cinerea) to 33.7% (S. sclerotiorum), with an average of 25.4%. The proportion of genes

568

allocated an orthoMCL of a known effector was similarly low at less than 0.3% for all

569

species. Thus, a point was allocated to known effectors that were either unique to the

570

species or obtained the same orthoMCL ID of a known effector. (V) Pfam hits of genes

571

surrounding known effectors were also compared to the rates of Pfam hits from all 10

572

proteomes together. Analysis of the 10 genes upstream and downstream of a known

573

effector revealed 10 Pfam hits which appeared at a rate at least double to that seen among

574

the concatenated proteomes. For example, Pfam hits to cytochrome P450 accounted for

575

2.82% of all hits among the 10 genes up and downstream of a known effector, compared to

576

only 1.26% of Pfam hits from the predicted proteins of all 10 species. Aside from

577

cytochrome P450, further Pfam hits overrepresented among the genes surrounding known

578

effectors included mitochondrial carrier protein, FAD binding domains 3 and 4, Ras family,

579

domain of unknown function (DUF3328), BTB/POZ domain, peptidase family M28, and

580

amino acid permease 1 and 2. At least one of these Pfam hits was found within 10 genes of

581

66.7% of the known effectors, which was higher when compared to all genes of each of the

582

10 species. Proportions ranged from only 28.7% (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) up to 43.9%

583

(B. cinerea), with an average of 34.1%, over the 10 species, of genes being within 10 genes

584

of an overrepresented Pfam hit. A point was therefore allocated to known effectors which

585

lay within 10 genes of a gene with one of the above mentioned Pfam hits. (VI) Those

586

genomes with >2% TE coverage also showed a high proportion of known effectors in the

587

close vicinity of TE’s. Specifically, 29/32 (90.6%) known effectors from Z. tritici,

588

S. sclerotiorum, B. cinerea, R. commune, L. maculans and M. oryzae were within seven genes

589

of a TE region, compared to an average of 47.8% of genes within seven genes of a TE for the

590

same six species. This led to the allocation of one point for known effectors within seven

591

genes of a TE for species with >2% TE coverage. (VII) Lastly, of the genomes analysed, only

592

those consisting of >25% AT-rich regions, being R. commune and L. maculans, were found to

593

have a noticeable association between the location of known effectors and AT-rich regions.

594

The distance of all known effectors to the closest AT-rich region, of these two species, were

595

found to be less than the Q1 value for each species. Hence, known effectors with these

596

specifications, in species with >25% AT-rich region coverage, were allocated one point. It

597

can be seen that depending on the degree of TE and AT-rich region coverage, each species

598

known effectors may be scored out of five, six or seven points, henceforth referred to as “n

599

points”. Over the 10 species with known effectors which were analysed, Table 3 illustrates a

600

total of 36/42 (85.7%) known effectors obtained n or n-1 points, revealing a process which

601

could be used to prioritise the many CE’s predicted for the E. fawcettii genome.

608

Prioritisation of candidate effectors:

609

While EffectorP correctly determined most known effectors, it also identified a large

610

number of additional CE’s. While it is likely some of these candidates are unknown effectors

611

being utilised by the pathogen to infect its host, it would be worthwhile to shortlist this

612

group, to a list of the more likely candidates, prior to expensive and time-consuming

613

experimental validation procedures. A points-based process was developed, based on the

614

analysis of known effectors, to prioritise CE’s based on several features including: their

615

distance to neighbouring genes, lack of involvement in predictable SM clusters, GC% of CDS,

616

proximity to genes obtaining certain Pfam hits and potential uniqueness (Figure 4). For

617

species with genome assemblies containing >2% TE coverage the number of genes a CE was

618

from a TE was taken into consideration. Similarly, the distance between genes and AT-rich

619

regions was acknowledged if AT-rich regions covered >25% of the species’ assembly. For

620

each CE gene, one point was available for each of the above features, hence, as described

621

for the known effector analysis, CE’s of each species were allocated a possible five, six or

622

seven points (n points). E. fawcettii, Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-

623

repentis, V. dahlia and U. maydis each had <2% TE coverage and <25% coverage of AT-rich

624

regions, their CE’s were therefore scored out of five points. Z. tritici, S. sclerotiorum,

625

B. cinerea and M. oryzae had >2% TE coverage but <25% coverage of AT-rich regions and so

626

were scored out of six points. Only the assemblies of R. commune and L. maculans showed

627

>2% TE’s and >25% AT-rich regions, and as such their CE’s were scored out of seven points.

628

By using n or n-1 points as an acceptable score for CE prioritisation, revealed that CE’s of the

629

11 species could be reduced, by 51.1% - 83.6% (average 66.2%) (S6), with species that were

630

scored out of more points achieving higher reductions.

Figure 4. Candidate effector prioritisation features and points. The candidate effectors

634

(CE’s) of all genomes analysed were scored using features shown in the blue box. Additional

635

features were considered for CE’s from genomes with >2% TE coverage (red box) and >25%

636

AT-rich region coverage (green box).

637
638

Applying the method outlined in Figure 4 to the CE’s of E. fawcettii led to the prioritisation

639

of 77 CE’s, a reduction of 62%, for future experimental validation. This is a comparable

640

reduction to that of the other necrotrophic pathogens (Figure 5, S6), for which six out of

641

seven known effectors were retained within the shortlisted CE’s. Features of the 77 CE’s of

642

E. fawcettii (S7) indicated many were small in size, had a high GC content, had a high

643

proportion of cysteine residues and were more likely to be classified as gene-sparse. The

644

median protein length was 181 aa, compared to 409 aa for all E. fawcettii predicted genes.

645

The mean GC content was 55.82% and the mean cysteine content was 3.4%, compared to

646

54.69% and 1.2%, respectively for all predicted genes of E. fawcettii. The high proportion

647

(44.2%) of gene-sparse genes among prioritised CE’s was expected, as CE’s which were not

648

classified as gene-dense were favoured during the prioritisation process, however high

649

proportions of gene-sparse genes were also observed among the SP’s and CE’s (Table 4).

650

Specifically, 26.8% of all E. fawcettii predicted genes were classed as gene-sparse, 26.3% as

651

gene-dense and the remaining 46.9% classed as neither. In comparison, 31.9% of SP’s and

652

35.7% of CE’s were classed as gene-sparse and only 15.9% and 16.25%, respectively, were

653

classed as gene-dense, indicating a preference for gene-sparse locations by proteins likely

654

secreted by the pathogen. PolyAA repeat-containing proteins were not overrepresented

655

among the prioritised CE’s, two were found to contain five consecutive Ala residues and one

656

other contained five consecutive Arg residues. Additionally, no CE’s were found to contain

657

SSR’s suggesting that diversity of E. fawcettii effector sequences is not being generated

658

through an increased mutational rate related to short repetitive sequences. Furthermore,

659

the prioritised CE’s were found scattered throughout the genome over 34 of the 141 gene-

660

containing contigs and did not appear to cluster together. While AT-rich regions were not

661

taken into consideration during the prioritisation of E. fawcettii CE’s, due to a low AT-rich

662

coverage of 1.03%, it should be noted that higher proportions of SP’s and CE’s were found

among genes on the edge of a contig and those within 2 Kb of an AT-rich region than

664

expected. Out of the 252 genes found at the edge of a contig, 36 (14.2%) were SP’s and 11

665

(4.3%) were CE’s, compared to 12.7% and 2.0%, respectively, out of all E. fawcettii proteins.

666

Similarly, of the 57 genes found within 2 Kb of an AT-rich region, 12 (21.1%) were SP’s and

667

four (7.0%) were CE’s (S7). This suggests that genomic regions near contig breaks, such as

668

sequences of low complexity or regions under-represented by short read sequencing

669

technology, and AT-rich regions may be indicators within the E. fawcettii genome of nearby

670

SP’s and effector genes. Interestingly, SP’s and CE’s were not overrepresented among genes

671

found within 2 Kb of a predicted TE region, of the 120 genes found in these regions 12 (10%)

672

were SP’s and 2 (1.7%) were CE’s, both slightly less than their proportions across the whole

673

genome. This suggested while potential effector genes are more likely to be found near AT-

674

rich regions, a nearby predictable TE region was not necessary. Thus, E. fawcettii, a

675

necrotrophic pathogen not considered at first thought to utilise protein effectors to increase

676

virulence, shows a subtle, yet intriguing, pattern of SP’s and CE’s near AT-rich regions, at

677

contig edges and in more gene-sparse locations. This potentially points towards a set of

678

virulence-related genes being maintained in specific genomic locations and therefore

679

suggesting their potential significance.

While analysing proteins using the features mentioned above can shortlist CE’s, awareness

692

of limitations should be considered. For example, only prioritising CE’s which are unique to a

693

species, or obtain the same orthoMCL hit as a known effector, limits the identification of

694

novel effectors which may be utilised by multiple species. Hence, a blast search of

695

E. fawcettii CE’s against CE’s of the 10 other fungal pathogens was conducted and indicated

696

12 (5.9%) E. fawcettii CE’s had >70% similarity to at least one candidate effector of another

697

species (S7). Four of these 12 proteins were prioritised CE’s, one of which had 72.9%

698

similarity to MoCDIP1 (M. oryzae), a known effector which is expressed in planta and

699

induces host cell death [49], thus highlighting this CE for further investigation.

Prediction and prioritisation of cell wall degrading enzymes:

702

Further potential pathogenicity-related genes of E. fawcettii which deserve attention

703

include CWDE’s. The E. fawcettii proteome showed 378 (3.75%) predicted CAZymes (S8),

704

comparable to the proportion of CAZymes seen in the other 10 pathogen genomes, which

705

ranged from 2.8% (S. sclerotiorum) to 4.3% (V. dahliae) (S2). Of the total E. fawcettii

706

CAZymes, 203 (53.7%) were also predicted as secreted, highlighting numerous potential

707

CWDE’s secreted by the pathogen and targeted for interaction with host carbohydrates. It

708

would be beneficial to compare these potential CWDE’s with transcriptomic data once

709

available, however, currently they can be cross-referenced against the Pfam database.

710

Analysis of the 203 potential CWDE’s revealed frequently appearing Pfam hits to pectate

711

lyase and pectinesterase (19 hits), the glycosyl hydrolases family 28 of pectin-degrading

712

polygalacturonases (11 hits) and the glycosyl hydrolases family 43 of hemicellulose-

713

degrading beta-xylosidases (10 hits). Hemicellulose- and pectin-degrading enzymes target

714

plant cell wall components including xyloglucans and pectin’s, respectively [68], both found

715

in high proportions in the primary cell wall, potentially revealing an arsenal of CWDE’s of

716

E. fawcettii which are targeted towards young plant tissues. Polygalacturonases break bonds

717

between polygalacturonic acid residues, thereby degrading pectin, while beta-xylosidases

718

hydrolyse xylan, a hemicellulose component of the cell wall. It is possible that the CWDE’s of

719

E. fawcettii have the ability to degrade components of a growing cell wall, however as the

720

host cell wall matures, the E. fawcettii CWDE repertoire becomes less effective, perhaps

721

explaining why only young plant tissues are susceptible to citrus scab. The 203 potential

722

CWDE’s were also cross-referenced against PHI-base, resulting in the prioritisation of 21

723

proteins which had similarity to known virulence factors of plant pathogens (Table 5, S8),

724

thus highlighting candidate virulence genes of E. fawcettii for future experimental

725

investigation. Among these 21 proteins were 14 predicted pectin-degrading enzymes,

726

including two with similarity to polygalacturonase genes, specifically pg1 (53.7%) and pgx6

727

(66.4%) of Fusarium oxysporum which have been shown to reduce pathogen virulence when

728

both are mutated simultaneously [74]; two showed similarity (61.6% and 41.8%) to the PecA

729

polygalacturonase gene of Aspergillus flavus, a CWDE which primarily degrades pectin, and

730

has been shown to improve pathogen invasion and increase spread during infection [73];

731

one with similarity to the pectin methylesterase Bcpme1 gene of B. cinerea [78]; four with

732

similarity (45.7% - 63.5%) to PelA and PelD, two pectate lyase virulence factors of Nectria

733

haematococca [75]; and a further five obtained a pectate lyase Pfam hit, of which four

734

showed similarity (40.3% - 53.5%) to the Pnl1 pectin lyase gene of citrus pathogen

735

Penicillium digitatum [76] and one with 58.4% similarity to PelB pectate lyase B gene of

736

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, seen to affect virulence on avocado [77]. A further five

737

prioritised candidate CWDE’s, classed as hemicellulose-degrading enzymes, showed

738

similarity (46.7% - 61.6%) to the endo-1,4-beta-xylanases (glycosyl hydrolase families 10 and

739

11) of M. oryzae, the knockdown of which is seen to reduce pathogenicity [80]. The

740

remaining two prioritised CWDE’s, classed as cellulose-degrading enzymes, showed 51.9%

741

and 52.9% similarity to the Glu1 glucanase gene, a known virulence factor of wheat

742

pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis [79]. The similarities seen between these predicted

743

secreted CAZymes and known virulence factors provides a collection of likely CWDE’s of

744

E. fawcettii for future investigation. Unlike SP’s or CE’s, predicted CWDE’s of E. fawcettii

745

were not overrepresented among genes found at the contig edge or within 2 Kb of an AT-

746

rich region (S8). There was some crossover between CE’s and CWDE’s, with five E. fawcettii

755

Prediction of secondary metabolite clusters

756

Much research surrounding E. fawcettii has focused on the SM elsinochrome, which

757

contributes to the formation of necrotic lesions [25-28]. Analysis of the E. fawcettii genome

758

assembly enabled the prediction of further genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome

759

gene cluster than previously described, as well as the prediction of additional SM clusters

760

throughout the assembly. In total, there were 22 predicted SM clusters, involving 404 (4.0%)

761

genes (Table 6, S9). Comparing this to the results of the 10 comparative species showed that

762

the number of predicted SM clusters varies widely among the pathogens, from 13 clusters

763

(U. maydis) to 53 clusters (M. oryzae) (Figure 6). This wide variety among fungal species, in

764

particular an overrepresentation of SM clusters among hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs has

765

been seen before [154]. From the comparative analysis, it appears E. fawcettii has a lighter

766

dependence upon the variety of secondary metabolite clusters compared to the other

767

necrotrophs and hemibiotrophs, particularly for T1PKS clusters. Blast analysis of the

768

previously determined E. fawcettii elsinochrome cluster [27] against the E. fawcetti

769

proteome indicated high similarities in amino acid sequence for six genes of the predicted

770

Type I Polyketide synthase (T1PKS) SM cluster 1 (S9). Specifically, the predicted core

771

biosynthetic gene of cluster 1 (accession D9617_1g081920) showed 98.6% similarity to the

772

E. fawcettii polyketide synthase (EfPKS1) gene (accession ABU63483.1). An additional

773

predicted biosynthetic gene (accession D9617_1g081900) had 99.6% similarity to the

774

E. fawcettii ESC reductase (RDT1) gene (accession ABZ01830) and the predicted transport-

775

related gene (accession D9617_1g081940) showed 70.3% similarity to the E. fawcettii ECT1

776

transporter (ECT1) gene (accession ABZ82008). Additional genes within the E. fawcettii SM

777

cluster 1 obtained hits to the E. fawcettii elsinochrome cluster [27], specifically

778

D9617_1g081930, D9617_1g081910 and D9617_1g081890 had high (97.4% - 100%)

779

similarity to PRF1 prefoldin protein subunit 3 (accession ABZ01833.1), TSF1 transcription

780

factor (accession ABZ01831.1) and EfHP1 coding a hypothetical protein (accession

781

ABZ82009.1). Hence, SM cluster 1 contains the two genes, EfPKS1 and TSF1, which have

782

been shown to be essential in elsinochrome production, as well as four genes (RDT1, PRF1,

783

ECT1 and EfHP1) also thought to be involved in elsinochrome biosynthesis [26, 27]. SM

784

cluster 1 appears to lack four genes, being OXR1, EfHP2, EfHP3 and EfHP4, which have all

785

been reported to code for hypothetical proteins and not thought to be involved in

786

biosynthesis [27]. However, to further investigate these omissions, BLAST analysis querying

787

the nucleotide sequences of the elsinochrome cluster [27] against the contigs of the

788

E. fawcettii genome assembly indicated regions with high similarities (99.3% - 99.7%)

789

consistent with the location of predicted SM cluster 1 on contig 1. This suggests that these

790

unnecessary nearby genes may have become slightly degraded in the E. fawcettii BRIP

791

53147a isolate and were therefore not recognised during gene prediction. The use of

792

alternate gene model prediction programs between the studies may also be a contributing

793

factor. These differences may be further investigated through future transcriptomics

794

analyses of E. fawcettii. Interestingly, SM cluster 1 consisted of an additional nine genes to

795

the elsinochrome cluster previously described [27], all of which lay in a cluster adjacent to

796

ECT1. Several of these additional genes obtained Pfam hits such as the THUMP domain,

797

peptidase M3, Apolipoprotein O, Gar1/Naf1 RNA binding region and

798

Endonuclease/Exonuclease/phosphatase family, suggesting these additional neighbouring

799

proteins may perform functions such as RNA binding and modification, peptide cleavage,

800

lipid binding and intracellular signalling, thus providing further genes for future investigation

801

into the elsinochrome biosynthesis pathway.

D9617_1g083910, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (accession CDM31317.1) with 54%

819

similarity D9617_1g083830 and the type 2 FAD-binding protein (accession CDM31316.1)

820

with 42% similarity to D9617_1g083960. The PR toxin is produced by the saprobe

821

Penicillium roqueforti, a known contaminant of silages [155], while the mechanisms of its

822

likely role in plant degeneration are unknown [156], PR toxin is seen to induce necrosis in

823

human intestinal epithelial cells and monocytic immune cells [157] and exhibits mutagenic

824

activity towards rats [158]. Thus, indicating the potential production of a toxin by

825

E. fawcettii with DNA-binding capabilities. Another predicted SM gene cluster of interest

826

was the T1PKS SM cluster 12. Three genes of cluster 12 (D9617_7g030040,

827

D9617_7g030060 and D9617_7g030070) showed similarity to multiple known biosynthetic

828

genes clusters; including the pestheic acid biosynthetic gene cluster of Pestalotiopsis fici

829

[159] thought to function as a plant growth regulator [160] and the Trypacidin biosynthetic

830

gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus, which produces a SM toxic to human lung cells [161].

831

Lastly, SM cluster 18 is predicted to code for five proteins with sequence similarity to those

832

of the cercosporin biosynthetic gene cluster of Cercospora nicotianae [162]. Specifically,

833

D9617_28g065380 (53% similarity to polyketide synthase, accession AAT69682.1),

834

D9617_28g065390 (52% similarity to cercosporin toxin biosynthesis protein, accession

835

ABC79591.2), D9617_28g065400 (41% similarity to oxidoreductase, accession ABK64184.1),

836

D9617_28g065420 (61% similarity to O-methyltransferase, accession ABK64180.1) and

837

D9617_28g065450 (60% similarity to oxidoreductase, accession ABK64182.1). Cercosporin,

838

similar to elsinochrome, is a fungal toxin which promotes the generation of reactive oxygen

839

species in the presence of light, killing plant cells [163]. Cercosporin produced by

840

C. nicotianae has been shown to cause necrotic lesions on tobacco leaves [164] and is also

841

produced by the apple pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae [165]. While it has been shown

842

that elsinochrome production is important for full virulence by E. fawcettii [26, 27],

843

biosynthesis of further SM’s, such as cluster 2, 12 or 18, may be beneficial to pathogenesis

844

by potentially disrupting host plant signalling, causing additional necrosis or inhibiting

845

competing microbes.

846
847

Analysis of the distances between predicted SM genes and TE’s indicated no TE’s were in

848

the close vicinity of SM cluster 1 (elsinochrome), the closest TE to the edge of the cluster

849

was 199,748 bp or 77 genes away. This lack of association was seen among all E. fawcettii

850

predicted SM clusters, with seven clusters predicted on contigs without identified TE’s (S9).

851

Of those clusters which did lie on contigs with TE’s, genes were an average distance of

852

236,556 bp away, suggesting recent activity of known TE’s was unlikely to be involved in the

853

formation of E. fawcettii SM clusters. The closest AT-rich region to SM cluster 1 was a

854

distance of 90,363 bp, while this was less than the mean distance (257,863 bp), this

855

indication of potential TE degradation by RIP is still quite distant. In contrast to multiple SP’s

856

and CE’s seen in the close vicinity of AT-rich regions, there were no genes from predicted

857

SM clusters within 2 Kb of an AT-rich region, suggesting genes involved in SM production

858

may benefit from residing in more stable genomic regions.

859

860

Conclusion:

861

The WGS sequencing, genome mining and comparative analyses conducted in this study

862

illustrates the potential that exists within the genome of E. fawcettii for virulence factors

863

such as protein effectors and CWDE’s. The identification of these potential pathogenicity-

864

related genes is a first step in determining further mechanisms utilised by E. fawcettii in

865

addition to elsinochrome production, thus enabling this pathogen to defeat plant immune

866

strategies in a host-specific manner. This study provides predicted virulence genes for future

867

experimental investigation of E. fawcettii pathogenesis pathways, as well as establishing a

868

comprehensive genomic resource for use in future studies to determine improved methods

869

of control and screening of this pathogen.
