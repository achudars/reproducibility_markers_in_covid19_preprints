Abstract

22

The Gravettian technocomplex was present in Europe from more than 30,000 years ago until

23

the Last Glacial Maximum, but the source of this industry and the people who manufactured

24

it remain unsettled. We use genome-wide analysis of a ~36,000-year-old Eastern European

25

individual (BuranKaya3A) from Buran-Kaya III in Crimea, the earliest documented

26

occurrence of the Gravettian, to investigate relationships between population structures of

27

Upper Palaeolithic Europe and the origin and spread of the culture. We show BuranKaya3A

28

to be genetically close to both contemporary occupants of the Eastern European plain and

29

the producers of the classical Gravettian of Central Europe 6,000 years later. These results

30

support an Eastern European origin of an Early Gravettian industry practiced by members

31

of a distinct population, who contributed ancestry to individuals from much later Gravettian

32

sites to the west.

Introduction

43

Since the 19th century, archaeologists have defined similarities identified across material remains

44

as an archaeological culture, complex, or in some cases, a “people”, and used these definitions to

45

trace the mobility, interactions, and technical development of past populations. The burgeoning

46

field of ancient DNA analysis allows past populations to be studied directly, and the genetic

47

relationships of the manufacturers of materially defined cultures can now be characterized. While

48

palaeogenomics and archaeological culture describe two separate past phenomena, they are not

49

always unrelated, and Upper Palaeolithic (UP) Europe has shown surprising correlations between

50

closely-related genetic clusters and archeologically defined material industries1. The Gravettian

51

technocomplex defines European Mid-Upper Palaeolithic (MUP) industries characterized by a

52

suite of shared innovations, along with specific modalities of their production, such as stone

53

Gravette points, backed blades and bladelets, personal ivory and shell ornaments, ochre, and antler

54

or bone tools. The Gravettian became widespread throughout Europe beginning after ca. 36,0002

55

until ca. 23,0003 cal BP years ago (ca. 32-21 ka 14C BP). The technocomplex defined by this term,

56

however, is by no means homogeneous, describing rather shared practices across many regional

57

facies and evolving stages3 (See Supplementary Text). While the Gravettian is considered to be a

58

local European industry, its origins continue to be the subject of ongoing research and debate4. The

59

density of Gravettian sites found in the Danubian valley radiocarbon dated as early as ca. 36,000

60

years cal BP have been used to argue for a local evolution of the Gravettian from the technical

61

legacy of the Aurignacian in the upper valley5, or through acculturation with post-Mousterian leaf-

62

point transition industries, such as the Szeletian, in the Middle Danubian basin6. However, long-

63

recognized similarities between features of Gravettian lithic traditions and Near Eastern industries,

64

such as the Ahmarian, which is found 10,000 years earlier in the Levant, as well as similar Early3

65

Upper Palaeolithic (EUP) micro-laminar industries found in both northern and southern slopes of

66

the Caucasus suggest an earlier influence from the southeast7–9.

67

Although the integration of Eastern European EUP and MUP traditions into an archaeological

68

framework defined in Central and Western Europe has historically been problematic, recent

69

reassessments of EUP assemblages from the Caucasus10–12 emphasize similar lithic traditions

70

among roughly contemporaneous (40-30,000 cal BP) layers at sites such as Dzudzuana Cave (layer

71

D), Ortvale Klde (layer 4c), Mezmaiskaya Cave (layer 1C), and the six layers of Buran Kaya III

72

(layer 6-5 to 5-2) in Crimea13,14 (see Supplementary Text for the stratigraphy of Buran-Kaya III).

73

Some authors suppose that the appearance of these Caucasian and Eastern European EUP

74

assemblages, which include backed blades and bladelets, are primarily based on the distribution

75

and transformation of Ahmarian traditions from Near East to Europe, probably through the

76

Caucasus, independent of that which brought the proto-Aurignacian to Central and Southern

77

Europe and the Mediterranean area10,14–16. The parallels between these Eastern European industries

78

and the Gravettian appearing later in Central Europe and the Danubian Valley have led some to

79

propose the term “Early Gravettian” to describe these industries to distinguish them from the

80

classical Gravettian8,16,17. However, the relationship of this Early Gravettian identified in Eastern

81

Europe to the development of the Gravettian in the west, as well as the extent to which it may have

82

involved transfers and adaptations of technology and movements of people, are unclear. The direct

83

study of the populations associated with these industries through genomic analysis of skeletal

84

remains from key archaeological sites will likely clarify this process and answer important

85

questions concerning how technologies disperse and change in UP societies.

86

Several human remains associated with the classical Gravettian from Central Europe, Belgium and

87

Italy were previously analysed genetically and found to share more genetic drift with each other

than individuals associated with other material cultures1. This group was termed the Vestonice

89

cluster, after Vestonice16, the best-covered genome from the ca. 30,000-year-old (cal BP)

90

Gravettian site Dolní Věstonice II in the Czech Republic. Interestingly, Vestonice16 and other

91

high-coverage genomes from the Gravettian sites Krems-Wachtberg (Austria) and Ostuni (Italy)

92

have been found to be admixed, deriving between 40 to 90% of their ancestry from a lineage

93

related to Kostenki141,18, an individual living ca. 7,000 years earlier at the Kostenki-14 site found

94

in the Borshchyovo archaeological complex of Western Russia, linking Gravettians of Central

95

Europe and the Apennine peninsula with an earlier population farther east.

96

While the Kostenki14 burial has no associated cultural material, contemporaneous Gravettian

97

artefacts have been recovered in Eastern Europe from three cultural layers at Buran-Kaya III in

98

Crimea and dated between ca. 38-34,000 cal BP2,19. Discovered in 1990, the Buran-Kaya III rock

99

shelter contains stratigraphic layers spanning from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages.

100

The Gravettian layers have yielded backed microliths, microgravette points, ochre, body

101

ornaments of ivory, shell, and teeth, as well as multiple human skull fragments showing signs of

102

post-mortem processing2. Buran-Kaya III is the earliest site bearing Gravettian material20 (see

103

Supplementary Text), yet it remains a distant outlier, both geographically and temporally, to the

104

more densely clustered appearances of the Gravettian occurring several thousand years later and

105

2,000 km to the west in the Danubian valley and the Swabian Jura, such as Krems-Hundssteig and

106

Geiβenklösterle, respectively.

107

To genetically characterize one of the earliest manufacturers of the Gravettian complex and how

108

they relate to other known MUP populations, as well as to further explore the relationships between

109

UP populations and the material culture they made, we present genome-wide data from a human

110

parietal bone fragment, BuranKaya3A, aseptically excavated in 2009 from layer 6-1 of Buran5

Kaya III (see Supplementary Text). Radiocarbon (AMS) dates from a different human cranial

112

fragment from this layer range from 36,260 to 35,280 cal BP (31,900+210-220 14C BP)2 (Figure 1

113

and Table S1), which is located between two other Gravettian layers, while all dated material (n=4)

114

from the same layer ranges from 37,560-33,850 cal BP19.

Results

117
118

Initial genetic characterization of BuranKaya3A revealed extremely poor preservation of

119

endogenous DNA, both in fragment length and in low quantity relative to environmental DNA,

120

but little contamination with modern human DNA as assessed by quantitative PCR. In order to

121

identify the most efficient material for mitochondrial enrichment and shotgun genome sequencing,

122

our strategy was to 1) screen single-stranded DNA libraries by both shallow shotgun sequencing

123

and mitochondrial enrichment from eight extractions taken from four different areas of the sample

124

and subjected to two different extraction treatments, 2) identify the extract that performed best in

125

terms of highest sequence complexity, endogenous content, and lowest modern human

126

contamination, and 3) construct a second series of single-stranded libraries with and without UNG

127

for deeper mitochondrial enrichment and shotgun sequencing. The best candidate identified from

128

the screening results contained 0.34% endogenous DNA (see Methods section and Extended Data

129

Figure 1). The second series of libraries from this extract was used to generate 82-fold coverage

130

of the mitochondrial genome and shotgun nuclear data (Table S2).

133

Mitochondrial and Y-chromosome haplogroups

134

The mitochondrial haplogroup of BuranKaya3A was determined to belong to an early branch of

135

the N lineage, N1. Surprisingly, this assignment falls outside of the lineages previously reported

136

for UP Europe, nearly all of which derive from later N branches (U and R haplogroups, Figure 2).

137

The N1 of BuranKaya3A is notably distinct from the mitochondrial haplogroup N identified from

138

the roughly 40,000-year-old mandible from Peștera cu Oase in Romania, which belongs to a more

139

basal branch that has no modern descendants21. In addition, the N1 of BuranKaya3A carries three

140

of the eight mutations occurring prior to N1b, a rare haplogroup most highly concentrated in the

141

Near East, yet appearing broadly from western Eurasia to Africa. The descendants of the N1b node

142

include N1b2, currently found only in Somalia22, and N1b1b, found in nearly 10% of Ashkenazi

143

Jewish haplogroups23. These three mutations allow us to place BuranKaya3A on a lineage apart

144

from that which has been proposed to later enter Europe from Anatolia during the Neolithic

145

(N1a1a)24. Among ancient samples, the mitochondrial sequence of an 11,000-year-old

146

Epipalaeolithic Natufian from the Levant (“Natufian9”)25 is also a later derivative of this N1b

147

branch. Thus, mitochondrial sequences branching both upstream and downstream of the

148

BuranKaya3A sequence can be traced to the Near East, and the modern presence in Europe of

149

haplogroups descended from the N1 (N1b1b and N1a1a) branch to which BuranKaya3A belongs

150

appear to be due to later migrations from the Near East (Extended Data Figure 2). We determined

151

the genetic sex of BuranKaya3A to be male using both the ratio of chromosome X and Y mapped

152

reads, giving an Ry value of 0.0893-0.097 (95% CI, SE 0.002)26, as well as a ratio of chromosome

153

X mapped reads to the average of autosomal reads of 0.55 (a ratio near 1.0 would indicate diploid

154

for X). From the reads mapping to the Y chromosome, six out of six Single Nucleotide

155

Polymorphisms (SNPs) that overlap with diagnostic sites for Y-haplogroup BT all carry the

derived allele, allowing a minimum assignment to BT, which has origins in Africa, with additional

157

derived alleles suggesting an eventual placement of CT or C, found in Asia and the Epipalaeolithic

158

Near East25. Additional ancestral alleles make an assignment of C1a2 or C1b, which appear in UP

159

Europe1, unlikely (see Table S3 for a summary and comparative placement of Palaeolithic Y-

160

haplogroups, and Supplementary Data 1 for a complete list of Y diagnostic SNPs).

161
162

Neanderthal ancestry

163

Neanderthal settlements, attributed to the Micoquian, Kiik-Koba type, at Buran-Kaya III (layer B)

164

has been dated by faunal bone fragments to 43.5 to 39.6 ka cal BP19, demonstrating an earlier

165

Neanderthal presence at the site just prior to the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption (39,280±110 years

166

cal BP (40Ar/39Ar))27. Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) remains dating to this period in

167

Romania have documented local admixture with late Neanderthals in Eastern Europe21, leading us

168

to investigate whether admixture with local Neanderthals in Crimea could be detected in early

169

AMHs living ca. 4,000 years after the presumed disappearance of Neanderthals from the

170

region19,28. Neanderthal ancestry calculated using ancestry informative SNPs1 on libraries from

171

four independent preparations determined that BuranKaya3A possesses 3.4% (SD 0.008)

172

Neanderthal ancestry (Table S4). This level of Neanderthal ancestry is typical for

173

contemporaneous West Eurasians and shows no evidence of late, local Neanderthal admixture in

174

Crimea with AMHs ancestral to the population to which BuranKaya3A belonged.

Genomic relationships of UP Europe and their archaeological cultures

177

The genetic relationship between BuranKaya3A and other UP individuals for which sufficient

178

genomic data exist can be measured using outgroup f3-statistics and various D-statistical tests29.

179

These were performed using SNPs from 52 previously published individuals dating from the Initial

180

Upper Palaeolithic (IUP) to the Mesolithic that had been reprocessed in the same pipeline used for

181

BuranKaya3A to reduce possible artefacts that may arise from data coming from disparate sources.

182

27,774 SNPs having base quality 30 or above were identified in BuranKaya3A that overlapped

183

with the nearly 3M SNPs from the combined panels in Fu et al. 20161. To minimize standard

184

errors, we restricted the results of this analysis to include only individuals having more than

185

300,000 SNPs overlapping with the panel.

186

Outgroup f3-statistics quantify the amount of shared genetic drift between two populations relative

187

to an outgroup population and have been used to reveal genetic affinities among UP individuals1.

188

Of the 21 ancient individuals (x) including at least 1000 SNPs in the calculation: f3(BuranKaya3A,

189

x; Mbuti) or f3( BuranKaya3A, x; Han), the highest f3 values for both outgroups were found when

190

x was either Sunghir3 (SIII), a 34,000-year-old (cal BP) group burial characterized as either

191

Streletskian30 or Eastern Gravettian31,32 (see Supplementary Text) found ca. 1,300 km to the

192

northeast of Buran-Kaya III, Vestonice16, from the context of a Gravettian facies known as the

193

Pavlovian, who lived ca. 6,000 years later and ca. 1,400 km to the northwest, and Kostenki14, a

194

burial predating BuranKaya3A by ca. 1,000 years and lying ca. 1,100 km to the northeast (Figure

195

3). Notably, BuranKaya3A shows less affinity for the 35,000-year-old (cal BP) GoyetQ116-1 from

196

Goyet cave in Belgium, with no direct cultural association, but dated to the Aurignacian period in

197

this area1,33, as well as the El Miron cluster, which corresponds to European late glacial

198

(Magdalenian) hunter-gatherers1. BuranKaya3A was also found to be particularly distant from the

199

Villabruna cluster, representing European post-glacial hunter-gatherers (Figure 3 and Extended

200

Data Figure 3A-B). The individual from Buran-Kaya III can thus be defined as a member of a

201

population making an Early Gravettian in Eastern Europe whose closest known genetic

202

relationships are with populations living within a 3,000-year window (ca. 37,000-34,000 cal BP)

203

farther northeast on the Eastern European plains (Sunghir3 and Kostenki14), as well as with

204

Gravettian populations who appeared ca. 6,000 years later in Central Europe (Vestonice16).

205

We then applied D-statistics to measure shared drift between BuranKaya3A and the individuals

206

tested above (x) as compared to the 45,000-year-old (cal BP) Central Asian Ust-Ishim (D(x, Ust-

207

Ishim; BuranKaya3A, Mbuti)), shown to be basal to all western MUP Eurasians studied to date34

208

(Figure 4a). Substituting the modern Han for Ust-Ishim gives additional support for the above

209

relationships with greater significance (Z-scores > 2.5) (Figure 4b). Full results for all tested

210

samples using both all SNPs and transversions only are given in Extended Data Figures 4 and 5.

211

The D-statistics support the results of the outgroup f3-statistical tests, except that here Sunghir3 is

212

replaced by Vestonice16 as sharing the most alleles with BuranKaya3A, although we note results

213

from both Vestonice16 and Sunghir3 overlap within one standard error. The additional D-statistic

214

D(w, x; BuranKaya3A, Mbuti), where w and x are various well-covered ancient individuals

215

representing previously defined Eurasian populations, was unable to significantly resolve which

216

of these two individuals is most closely related genetically to BuranKaya3A: the ca. 34,000-year-

217

old (cal BP) East European Sunghir3 or the ca. 30,000-year-old (cal BP) Central European

218

Vestonice16 (Extended Data Figure 6).

219

Genomic data from less well covered MUP Europeans allows us to better define the relative

220

position of BuranKaya3A with more individuals from Gravettian contexts, including

221

representatives of two of the three previously identified Vestonice genetic sub-clusters

222

corresponding to Gravettian sites1. Comparing two low-coverage individuals requires more

223

caution in interpreting the results due to the low number of SNPs used for the calculations.

224

However, we were able to establish additional support for the relationships by applying a strict

225

filtering process whereby 1) we performed the analysis using two datasets, one including all SNPs

226

and the other considering only the transversions. The transversion-only dataset reduces the number

227

of SNPs used, but eliminates statistical noise from deaminated cytosines, a common form of

228

damage in ancient DNA. 2) We excluded samples using less than 50 SNPs for f3 analysis in the

229

smaller transversion-only dataset. 3) We required the resulting values from both datasets to be

230

within 30% of each other. This approach allowed us to define genetic affinities between

231

BuranKaya3A and the following individuals: Kostenki12, a 32,500-year-old (cal BP) neonate

232

whose remains were found at the Kostenki-Borshchyovo archaeological complex in Russia and

233

associated with a cultural layer attributed to a local industry defined as the Gorodtsovian35;

234

Vestonice43 and Pavlov1, two Central European Gravettian (Pavlovian) burials similar in age and

235

location to Vestonice16 and belonging to the “Vestonice Central European” genetic subcluster;

236

Paglicci133, a ca. 33,000-year-old (cal BP) tooth from the Apulia region of Southern Italy found

237

in association with Early Gravettian cultural material; and Ostuni1, a ca. 27,500 year-old (cal BP)

238

Gravettian burial, also from the Apulia region and both belonging to the “Vestonice Italian”

239

genetic subcluster. No members of the “Vestonice Goyet” subcluster from Goyet cave in Belgium

240

passed our filters to be included in the analysis (full descriptions of these samples and clusters are

241

given in the Supplementary Information of Fu et al. 20151). Visual representation of the outgroup

242

f3-statistics, f3(BuranKaya3A, MUP; Mbuti), for all samples passing filters is shown in Extended

243

Data Figure 7 and full results for all tested samples are given in Extended Data Figure 8.

244

Of the less well-covered samples, Kostenki12 is shown to have a high affinity with BuranKaya3A.

245

This is in agreement with the previously reported affinity between Kostenki12 and Sunghir336 and

246

closely links BuranKaya3A to all EUP and MUP individuals currently known from the Eastern

247

European plains. To the west, BuranKaya3A shows close genetic affinity with Pavlov1, followed

248

more distantly by Vestonice43 and Ostuni1, and at a greater distance, the older Paglicci133. In

249

summary, these results allow us to firmly establish a close genetic relationship between

250

BuranKaya3A with contemporary EUP and MUP populations of the Eastern European plains, as

251

well as the broader population manufacturing the Pavlovian facies of the Gravettian in Central

252

Europe ca. 6,000 years later, but less so with those associated with the Gravettian of southern Italy.

253

This implies a network of gene flow across the Eastern European plains and the Danubian Valley

254

between 37,000-30,000 years ago (cal BP) which, apart from the local Gorodtsovian culture found

255

at Kostenki 12, can be associated with various facies of the Gravettian technocomplex. The results

256

from Ostuni1 and Paglicci133 indicate a more indirect relationship between these populations and

257

BuranKaya3A. Higher coverage genetic information from early Gravettian sites in Italy will be

258

required to better understand to what extent the movements of people and ideas lead to the

259

appearance of the Gravettian in the southern Apennine Peninsula.

Ancestry from a population which split from all non-Africans prior to their separation from each

263

other, termed Basal Eurasian, had not been known in Europe until after the Last Glacial Maximum

264

(LGM)1. However, two 24,000-27,000-year-old (cal BP) individuals from layer C at Dzudzuana

265

Cave in the southern Caucasus have recently been reported to share ~70% common ancestry with

266

Villabruna and ~30% ancestry deriving from this Basal-Eurasian source18. Additionally, varying

267

layers of Villabruna ancestry, which did not enter Europe in an unmixed form prior to ca. 14,000

268

years ago (cal BP)1, have been found in members of the Gravettian Vestonice cluster as well as

269

the Magdalenian El Miron cluster, indicating a degree of shared ancestry in these groups with a

270

“Common West Eurasian” population18. We calculated the relative level of Basal Eurasian

271

ancestry using D-statistic D(EUP East Asian, UP, Ust-Ishim, Mbuti), where a positive value

272

indicates Basal Eurasian ancestry as allele sharing between the UP individual and Africans. This

273

analysis showed BuranKaya3A, like other pre-LGM UP Europeans, to be lacking Basal Eurasian

274

ancestry (Extended Data Figure 9). Similar tests examine the relative affinities of Palaeolithic and

275

Mesolithic populations to Villabruna as opposed to either modern East Asians, D(x, Han;

276

Villabruna, Mbuti), or BuranKaya3A, D(x, BuranKaya3A; Villabruna, Mbuti) (Extended Data

277

Figures 10 and 11, respectively). These results show levels of Villabruna ancestry in Eastern

278

European EUP individuals (Sunghir3, Kostenki12, Kostenki14, and BuranKaya3A) below that of

279

later UP Central and Western Europeans from Gravettian contexts (the Vestonice cluster).

280

Intriguingly, this includes a proportion of shared ancestry with Villabruna in BuranKaya3A similar

281

to that found in Ust-Ishim and both ancient and modern East Asians (Extended Data Figures 10

282

and 11), which should be insignificant based on previous admixturegraph analysis18.

284

Discussion

285
286

The results of the genome-wide analysis of BuranKaya3A offer important evidence linking the

287

previously established genetic signature of the manufacturers of the Gravettian in Central Europe

288

to a much earlier appearance of the Gravettian in Eastern Europe. The absence of the “Common

289

West Eurasian” ancestry, as represented by Villabruna, in BuranKaya3A marks a key genetic

290

distinction between the Gravettian inhabitants of Buran-Kaya III, possibly including the broader

291

populations of EUP Eastern Europe as well, and the UP populations of Western and Central

292

Europe, which is characterized by a West-to-East reduction in “Common West Eurasian” ancestry

293

(seen in Extended Data Figure 10). The association we show here of this eastern genetic character

294

with the cultural material of the Gravettian of Buran-Kaya III, which has been compared to nearby

295

contemporaneous Early Upper Palaeolithic assemblages from the Caucasus11,15 indicated in Figure

296

3, collectively support an eastern advance of AMHs during the EUP into Europe through the

297

Caucasus as has been previously proposed based on archaeological evidence alone7,8,16. Such a

298

population would have had to have split from the settlers of Central Europe and the Mediterranean

299

prior to their acquisition of the Common West Eurasian component as represented by Villabruna.

300

In this scenario, the technical adaptations required for the challenging environment of the open

301

Eastern European plains, a dryer landscape with little natural shelter, as well as possible cultural

302

exchanges with local populations, may have played a role in the development of the Early

303

Gravettian industry8. The individuals recently characterized genetically from layer C of

304

Dzudzuana cave in the Caucasus (data not yet available), who were found to contain ancestry (both

305

Basal Eurasian and Common West Eurasian) that was absent ca. 9,000 years earlier in Crimea,

306

may represent more recent immigration into Eastern Europe. A higher resolution of these

307

movements awaits genetic analysis of more EUP and MUP sites from this region.

308

Numerous parallels in lithic industries, such as microblade-knapping methods, backed blades, and

309

analogous stone blade, point and tool morphology (such as the partly backed Ahmarian el Wad-

310

points and Gravette points of Europe) have suggested earlier Near Eastern cultures as possible

311

precursors to Gravettian techniques7,8. Despite both uni-parental markers being shared between

312

BuranKaya3A and Epipalaeolithic Natufians in the Near East, we were unable to detect extensive

313

genome-wide allele-sharing between BuranKaya3A and the Natufians in our analysis. We note,

314

however, that the high level of Basal Eurasian ancestry in Natufian genomic sequences (38-54%25)

315

limits our sensitivity when comparing populations lacking this component. For example, negative

316

D-statistics seen in Figure 4 involving the Mesolithic Caucasus Hunter-Gatherer (CHG)

317

individuals Kotias and Satsurblia37, as well as the Natufians and the Iranian Hotu25, are due to the

318

Basal Eurasian content reported for these individuals, which appears in the statistic as an affinity

319

toward the outgroup Mbuti. Also, given the more than 20,000-year age difference between

320

BuranKaya3A and the Natufians, it is unlikely that the Epipalaeolithic Natufians are the best

321

surrogates for EUP Near Eastern populations. While influences from the Ahmarian can be seen in

322

the Gravettian17, it is the Early Ahmarian that has separately been proposed as a source for the

323

wave of AMHs bringing the Proto-Aurignacian west, possibly by way of the Balkans, into Central

324

and Southern Europe beginning prior to the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption13. Populations

325

associated with the Early Ahmarian and the Ahmarian may thus suggest better candidate source

326

populations to investigate further the hypothesis of a population split behind separate routes in the

327

settling of Europe, the Balkans/Mediterranean to the west and the Caucasus to the east, each

328

associated with accompanying industries (Proto-Aurignacian and Early Gravettian, respectively).

329

The shared ancestry, as well as cultural similarities, demonstrated between the settlements at

330

Buran-Kaya III, later Gravettians in Central Europe, and to some extent, Sunghir, suggest a broad

331

and long-lasting network of social exchange in the EUP across Eastern and Central Europe, from

332

the Eastern European plains to the Danubian corridor. Given this background, the appearance of

333

the Gravettian in Central Europe in the MUP, where it later would blossom, is likely to have

334

resulted from this input from the east. While we show that the Gravettian, sensu lato, was not

335

practiced by a single genetically uniform cluster across all facies, the close genetic relationship

336

between BuranKaya3A and the Kostenki individuals raise further questions as to the origin of the

337

local culture termed Gorodtsovian, which is found at Kostenki 12 and unknown outside the

338

Kostenki-Borshchevo region. Given the genetic affinities we report, the previous assignment by

339

some authors of the Late Streletskian industry of Sunghir being a local facies of an “Eastern”

340

Gravettian31,32 should lead to a closer examination of the possible influences underlying the

341

appearance of the Gorodtsovian, with appreciation for the impact that climate, the specific

342

landscape of the site, and site-specific activities may have had on the individual tool requirements

343

of the assemblages8. Alternatively, the Gorodtsovian and other local UP industries of Eastern

344

Europe may represent distinct cultures practiced on the Eastern European plains, and the genomic

345

affinities between the individuals from Kostenki, Sunghir and BuranKaya3A may show only a

346

relationship to a common source population among the occupants of Eastern Europe branching

347

more recently than those present in Western Europe.

348

This study, the genomic analysis of the oldest AMH from an archeologically defined context,

349

demonstrates an underlying genetic continuity between manufacturers of various facies of the

350

Gravettian spanning ca. 9,000 years. A geographical divergence among groups entering Europe

351

more than 37,000 years ago is supported by the finding that the earliest appearance at Buran-Kaya

352

III is associated with a population unadmixed with the Common West Eurasian component already

353

present in Europe to some degree, and is thus distinct. Regional features such as micro-laminar

354

industries and Gravette points found in EUP assemblages in the Caucasus, both archeologically

355

comparable and contemporary with Buran-Kaya III, suggest the Caucasus as a possible route for

356

this diffusion, and a role of these industries in the development of the Early Gravettian. A more

357

comprehensive understanding of both genomic information and archaeological assemblages of UP

358

sites in the Caucasus and Near East will allow more precise identification of the origins of both

359

this population and, potentially, the Gravettian.

All radiocarbon dates were recalibrated using the software OxCal v4.3.2 based on the IntCal13

364

calibration data set38. The calibrated dates are rounded to 5.

365

Sample handling, DNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing

366

A human parietal fragment was excavated aseptically from layer 6-1 during the 2009 excavation

367

season at Buran Kaya III (see Supplementary Text). All pre-amplification sample preparation was

368

performed in the dedicated ancient DNA facility using decontamination and clean-room protocols

369

as described in Bennett, et al39. All buffers and solutions were prepared using water

370

decontaminated by gamma-irradiation (8 kGy). After first removing the surface of the areas to be

371

sampled with a sterile scalpel, between 47 and 114 mg of bone powder was recovered from four

372

different places of the bone using a variable-speed drill at low speed to reduce overheating

373

(Dremel, Mount Prospect, IL, USA). Two of these samplings were each divided into two equal

374

portions, one of which was subject to phosphate buffer pre-treatment as described in Korlevic, et

375

al40. Phosphate buffer washes for each sample were collected and combined for DNA purification.

376

Both phosphate and non-phosphate buffer treated samples, including reagent-only mocks, were

377

then incubated in 1.5 mL LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with 1

378

mL 0.5 M EDTA , pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), with 0.25mg/mL proteinase K (Sigma-

379

Aldrich) and 0.05% UV-irradiated Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich), at 37°C for 24 H. Following

380

incubation, all tubes were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min, and supernatant was mixed

381

with 10 times its volume of “2M70” binding buffer (2 M guanidine hydrochloride and 70%

383

Germany) using 25 mL tube extenders (Qiagen) and a vacuum manifold (Qiagen) as described39,41.

384

2M70 binding buffer has been shown to retain the smaller DNA fragments lost during purification

385

with traditional binding buffers42. Columns were washed twice with 1 mL PE Buffer (Qiagen) then

386

transferred to a micro-centrifuge and dried by spinning 1 minute at 16,100 × g, turning tubes 180°

387

and repeating. DNA was eluted in a total of 60 μl of 10 mM EBT (Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing

388

0.05% Tween-20) performed in two elutions of 30 μl each, by spinning 16,100 × g for 1 minute

389

after a 5-minute incubation.

390

For the screening step, single-stranded libraries were constructed using either 2 μl (for screening)

391

or 6 μl (for mitochondrial capture) of the eluted DNA, including mocks of all treatments, water

392

only samples, and a positive control oligo following the protocol of Gansauge, et al.43 using the

393

splinter oligonucleotide TL110, and eluting in 50 μl EBT. Either 40 μl (for mitochondrial capture)

394

or 4 μl (for screening) of each library was used for bar-coding amplification using dual-barcoded

395

single-stranded library adapters44 as primers in the following 100 μl volume reaction: 10 μl 10x

396

PCR Buffer + MgCl2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 0.4 μM of each primer, 80 μM dNTPs (Roche),

397

15 units of FastStart Taq (Roche). Reactions were heated 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles

398

of 95°C 20 s, 53°C for 45 s, 68°C for 45 s, and then 68°C for 5 min. Heteroduplexes that could

399

confound size selection were resolved by diluting the PCR product 1:5 in a 100 μl reaction

400

containing 20 μl of the initial reaction, 8 μl PCR Buffer + MgCl2, 0.4 μM of standard Illumina

401

primers P5 and P7, and 80 μM dNTPs, and amplified a single cycle of 95°C for 1 minute, 60°C

402

for 2 min and 68°C for 5 min. Products were then purified and size-selected using NucleoMag

403

beads (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) for two rounds of purification/size selection according

404

to the supplied protocol at a ratio of bead solution 1.3 times the reaction volume and eluted in 30

ng of biotinylated RNA baits reverse transcribed from human mitochondrial PCR products

410

(courtesy of L. Cardin and S. Brunel.) following the protocol described in Massilani et al.45, but

411

with four changes: (1) for hybridization and wash steps, 60°C was used instead of 62°C. (2)

412

DNA/RNA-bait solution was incubated 96 H instead of 48 H. (3) Elution of the bead-bound

413

enriched DNA was performed with a 5 minute incubation in 30 µl EBT at 95°C followed by a

414

magnetic bead separation and the transfer of the eluate to a new tube rather than a 0.1 N NaOH

415

elution followed by silica column purification. (4) All post-capture amplifications were performed

416

for 35 cycles followed by a heteroduplex resolution step as described above. Enriched DNA was

417

then quantified as above, and products from all libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts and

418

sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using a v3 reagent kit for 2x76 cycles, substituting primer CL72

419

for the Read1 sequencing primer as described44.

420

Eight additional libraries along with positive and negative controls were made from 3-8 µl each of

421

the remaining extract BK_A4B, which had the highest relative endogenous DNA content. It should

422

be noted that this extract was derived from the portion of the cranial fragment which included the

423

suture. Libraries were prepared as described above except one library was first treated with USER

424

enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) for 30 min to remove deaminated

425

cytosine damage. Prior to the barcoding amplification, a 6-cycle amplification of pre-barcoded

426

libraries was performed using 45 μl of each library with 45 μl OneTaq 2X Master Mix with

427

Standard Buffer (New England Biolabs), and 0.1 μM internal primers CL7244 and CL13040 with

428

the above PCR conditions. Three pairs of different dual-barcoded adapters were then used to

429

amplify 20 μl of each amplified library, followed by purification and size selection as described

430

above, which allowed the later pooling of two enrichment protocols and non-enriched DNA from

431

the same library. An average of 1.2 μg of DNA to 1 μg RNA-baits was used for each mitochondrial

432

enrichment, as above, however, an additional alternative “touch-down” hybridization protocol

433

consisting of 60°C for 12 H, 59°C for 12 H, 58°C for 12 H, 57°C for 12 H, and 56°C for 48 H was

434

tested for each library. For select libraries, an alternative wash protocol described in Fu et al.46 was

435

also tested. Neither of these alternative protocols had a substantial impact on the results obtained.

436

Enriched and shotgun libraries were then pooled separately and size selected on an E-Gel

437

SizeSelect 2% agarose gel (Thermo Fisher). Enriched libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina

438

MiSeq, as above, and shotgun libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq using a NextSeq

439

500/550 High Output Kit v2 (2x75 cycles).

440

Data analysis

441

Paired-end sequencing results were merged and adapters trimmed using leeHom47, and reads were

442

then aligned to the human genome (hg37d5) with BWA (v0.7.12) aln, parameters -n 0.01 -l 0,

443

followed by samse48. Reads shorter than 28 bp long were then removed directly from sam files

444

with an awk command39. PCR duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicates (v2.9.0)49 and reads

445

mapping with quality less than 25 were removed with SAMtools (v1.7)50. Reads mapping to the

446

nuclear genome with a mapping quality score of 25 or greater were locally realigned around known

447

indels using GATK (v3.7-0) IndelRealigner51. Following this step, mapped reads less than 35 bp

448

containing indels were removed52. This step reduced aberrant SNP calls due to spurious alignments

449

of short fragments in our dataset, where the base did not match either of two expected alleles, from

450

1.1% to 0.6%. In comparison, raising the minimum length of all reads to 30 bp reduced aberrant

451

SNP calls to 0.4%, but reduced informative SNPs by 18.4%, demonstrating the utility of retaining

452

a short minimum read length while excluding short indel-containing reads for this sample. All

453

libraries showed extremely poor preservation of genetic material. The average fragment length of

454

mapped reads after the above treatment was 38 bp, and the first position C>T transition rate from

455

damage was 55% at the 5’ end of the molecule as calculated by mapDamage (v2.0.6)53 (Extended

456

Data Figure 12).

457

Reads mapping to the mitochondrion were used to determine the posterior probability for

458

contaminating modern human sequences with Schmutzi54 and found to have a distribution

459

maximum at 1%. A mitochondrial consensus sequence was called from the majority of bases at

460

each position using Geneious (v8.1.9)55, which exactly matched that generated from Schmutzi.

461

The 5’-most 100 bp of this consensus sequence was duplicated at the 3’ end and used as a reference

462

for a new alignment using the enriched reads. The haplogroup was called using Phy-Mer with

463

Build 16 rCRS-based haplogroup motifs56 and verified by manual analysis of sequence changes.

464

A Bayesian tree of 25 ancient and 3 modern mitochondrial sequences, excluding the hypervariable

465

regions, was constructed using MrBayes57 using a GTR+i+G nucleotide substitution model, which

466

gave the lowest log-likelihood for the tree out of all models tested (GTR and HKY with all

467

combinations of 4 invariant sites and gamma distributions), agreeing with the results of

Neanderthal content

479

Neanderthal ancestry was calculated using the ancestry informative SNP method1 calculated

480

separately for Neanderthal- or AMH-derived SNPs on four libraries prepared from two

481

independent extractions, treated either with or without UDG. The combined libraries overlapped

482

a total of 6,252 SNPs reported to have derived in either the Neanderthal (2,538 SNPs) or AMH

483

(3,714 SNPs) lineages60. The combined libraries averaged 3.5% (SD 0.0074) Neanderthal

484

ancestry. To test the sensitivity of these SNPs to determine Neanderthal ancestry, this SNP subset

485

was then used to recalculate Neanderthal ancestry from several previously reported UP genomes1.

486

The results agreed with previously reported values (Table S4).

SNP calling and f-statistics

488

BuranKaya3A bam files for all barcoded libraries were merged with SAMtools merge50 and PCR

489

duplicates removed with MarkDuplicates49. SNPs were called for positions overlapping with the

490

combined SNP panels from Fu et al.1 using SAMtools mpileup50, requiring a SNP base quality

491

score of 30 or greater, and choosing one allele at random when necessary with pileupcaller61. This

492

resulted in 27,740 SNPs out of 2,990,848 being called for BuranKaya3A. To monitor the impact

493

cytosine deamination may have on the SNP calls and resulting analyses of ancient samples,

494

alternative datasets removing all C to T or G to A transitions were generated and all statistical

analyses were performed on both data sets. Results with >30% disagreement between the two

To calculate f-statistics, data from 52 previously reported genomes (in either fastq or bam format)

498

were downloaded and realigned to the human genome (hg37d5), and SNPs were called following

the identical pipeline used for BuranKaya3A, with the exception that diploid SNP calls were

503

computed using ADMIXTOOLS29 qp3Pop (v412) qpDstat (v712), respectively. Standard error

504

was estimated using a block jackknife with 0.050 centiMorgan blocks. Full analyses performed
