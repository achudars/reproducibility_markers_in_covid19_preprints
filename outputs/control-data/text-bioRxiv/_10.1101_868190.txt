Abstract
PPARactivation is a critical event in luminal muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)
tumorigenesis, favoring both tumor cell growth and microenvironment modulation toward
tumor immune escape. Conversely, the down-regulation of PPARactivity in basal MIBC
suggests tumor suppressive effects in this subgroup. Here, we report genetic, epigenetic
and functional evidence to support the tumor suppressor role for PPAR in basal bladder
tumors. We identified hemizygous deletions, DNA hyper-methylation and loss-of-function
mutations of PPARin basal MIBC, associated with PPAR under-expression and its
decreased activity. Re-expression of PPARin basal tumor cells resulted in the activation
of PPAR-dependent transcription program that modulated fatty acid metabolism and cell
differentiation and decreased cell growth, which could partly rely on EGFR down-regulation.
Structure-function studies of two PPAR mutant revealed a destabilization of a region
important for coactivator recruitment and should help develop potent molecules to activate
PPAR as a therapeutic strategy for basal MIBC. The identification of this subtypedependent dual role of PPAR in MIBC strengthens the critical role of PPAR in bladder
tumorigenesis and reinforces the interest in stratified medicine based on tumor molecular
subtyping.

Introduction
The nuclear receptor PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma)
functions as a permissive heterodimer with RXR (retinoid X receptor and recognizes
specific sequence motifs, defined as PPRE (peroxisome proliferative response elements),
in the regulatory regions of its target genes. In the absence of ligand, PPAR is complexed
with corepressor proteins, such as NCoR1 (Nuclear receptor corepressor 1) or SMRT
(silencing mediator of retinoic acid receptor), which induces HDAC (histone deacetylase)
recruitment, leading to PPARmediated transcriptional repression. Conversely, upon ligand
binding, a conformational change allows the release of corepressors and the recruitment of
coactivators, such as MED1 (Mediator complex subunit 1) or PGC1 (PPARGC1A, PPARG
coactivator 1 alpha), enabling PPAR transcriptional activity. A variety of natural ligands,
such as polyunsaturated fatty acid or prostaglandin J2 derivatives, and synthetic ligands,
such as thiazolinediones, can activate PPAR. PPAR is involved in the regulation of
glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis1,2 but also in the differentiation of several tissue
types, including the urothelium3,4. Its role in cancer is less clear and seems to be dual, tumor
suppressor (in colon, lung cancers and neuroblastoma) or pro-tumorigenic (in pancreatic or
bladder cancers), depending on the cell type5–9.
In bladder cancer, the 4th most frequent cancer in men in industrialized countries, the
luminal subtype of muscle-invasive bladder carcinomas (MIBCs), which accounts for 60%
of MIBCs10,11, has been shown to display a PPAR activation signature8,12. This activation
is associated with genetic alterations which are associated with the luminal subtype, namely
PPAR DNA gains and amplifications (30%) or recurrent activating mutations of RXR (5%)
or PPAR (4%)10,13–16. PPAR activation renders bladder tumor cell growth PPARdependent14,16 and promotes immune evasion in MIBCs17 providing evidence for protumorigenic roles of the PPAR/RXR pathway in luminal bladder tumors.

Interestingly, PPAR activation signature or regulon activity is dramatically decreased in
basal bladder tumors, a subtype accounting for 35% of MIBCs and presenting a poor
prognosis, suggesting that PPAR could display an opposite role in this subtype10–12,18. In
this work, we hypothesized that the loss of PPAR activity could be essential for the
tumorigenesis of the basal subtype of MIBCs. We searched for genetic and epigenetic
alterations that could drive PPAR inactivation in basal bladder tumors and could support a
tumor suppressor role for PPAR. In basal tumors, we identified an enrichment in
hemizygous deletions, DNA hyper-methylation and repressive histone mark (H3K9me3) of
PPAR, associated with PPAR loss of expression. Among the non-recurrent mutations of
PPAR that we previously identified by sequencing PPAR in 359 tumors and studying
publicly available data for 455 MIBCs16, four mutations were associated with basal tumors.
Functional analysis revealed that these four mutations reduce the transcriptional activity of
PPAR. Further biochemical and structure-function analysis of two of these mutations,
affecting the ligand-binding domain of PPAR, showed that they alter PPAR activity through
the destabilization of helix H12, thereby impairing the release of corepressors and the
recruitment of coactivators. Furthermore, induced PPAR expression in basal bladder
cancer cell lines activated PPAR-dependent transcription and decreased cell viability,
whereas it displayed no effect on cell viability of luminal cells. Finally, we show that the tumor
suppressive activity of PPAR in basal tumors could at least partially rely on EGFR downregulation. Our study provides genetic, epigenetic and functional evidence of a tumor
suppressive role for PPAR in basal bladder cancer and therefore supports the use of
PPAR synthetic agonists as a therapeutic strategy for this subgroup. It reinforces the central
role of PPAR in bladder tumorigenesis that appears to be subgroup dependent: protumorigenic in differentiated luminal tumors and tumor suppressor in basal tumors.

Results
Hemizygous deletions, DNA hypermethylation and loss of expression of PPAR
associated with basal MIBC
We studied PPAR expression in 197 bladder tumors -101 of which were Non MuscleInvasive Bladder Cancers (NMIBCs)- in our CIT series of tumors (Carte d’Identité des
Tumeurs) using U133 plus 2.0 Affymetrix transcriptomic data 8,18 and in 405 MIBC samples
using

publicly available RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas 10,13 genomic

database (http://cancergenome.nih.gov) (Fig. 1a). Tumors were grouped in six molecular
classes according to a molecular consensus classification derived from six independent
classification systems previously described for MIBC11 (Supplementary Table 1). In good
agreement with the loss of transcriptional activity of PPAR observed in basal tumors10–12,
we observed a significantly lower expression of PPAR in Basal/Squamous tumors but
overall in non-luminal tumors including in Neuroendocrine-like and Stroma-rich tumors
compared to luminal tumors, encompassing Luminal Papillary, Luminal Non-Specified and
Luminal Unstable subtypes (Fig.1a). Using available copy number data for 385 MIBCs from
the TCGA, we observed that hemizygous deletions of PPAR were significantly associated
with a low expression (Fig.1b left panel) and activity (Fig.1b right panel) of PPAR
Conversely, gains and amplifications were associated with overexpression and hyperactivity of PPAR as previously described8,9,14,16. We further noticed that these hemizygous
deletions were significantly enriched in basal/squamous tumors and could therefore account
for part of the loss of expression of PPAR in this subgroup (Fig. 1c). The genomic deletions
of PPAR in basal tumors were a first genomic evidence suggesting a tumor suppressor role
for PPAR in these tumors. Since aberrant patterns of DNA methylation can also affect tumor
suppressor gene expression during tumorigenesis, we analyzed PPAR DNA methylation in
368 MIBCs using DNA methylation array data available from TCGA. We identified a
significant hyper-methylation of PPAR CpGs in basal tumors compared to luminal ones,

mostly in shore regions of CpG islands within the PPAR promoter (Fig.1d, upper panel and
supplementary Fig.1a). The hyper-methylation, which correlated with the downregulation of
PPARexpression in basal tumors (Fig.1d, middle and lower panels), could also account
for part of its loss of expression in basal tumors. These results were further validated in our
CIT series of tumors (Supplementary Fig.1b). We also observed an enrichment of histone
repressive mark (H3K9me3) in PPAR regulatory regions in two basal (L1207 and 5367) as
compared to two luminal bladder cancer cell lines (RT112 and SD48) (Supplementary
Fig.1c). These data provided epigenetic evidences supporting the tumor suppressor role of
PPAR in basal tumors.

Loss-of-function mutations of PPARG in basal tumors
Loss-of-function mutations are also a hallmark of tumor suppressor genes. We therefore
searched for such alterations of PPAR in basal bladder tumors. We previously sequenced
PPAR in 359 bladder tumors and studied publicly available data for 455 MIBCs, which
allowed us to identify recurrent activating mutations of PPAR in 4% of bladder tumors16.
These mutations were enriched in tumors presenting a high PPAR activation score, which
were mostly luminal tumors, supporting the protumorigenic role of PPAR in this subgroup.
We had also identified eleven non-recurrent PPAR mutations that we did not further study16
(Fig. 2a). Here, we numbered all mutations relative to the PPARγ2 isoform (NM_015869),
which is 28 amino acids longer than the PPARγ1 isoform (NM_138712) at the N-terminal
end (Fig. 2a). Four of these non-recurrent mutations, S74C, F310S, E455Q and H494Y,
were associated with basal tumors which presented a low PPAR activation score (Fig. 2b).
We therefore hypothesized that these four mutations could be loss-of-function mutations
and investigated their functional impact on the transcriptional activity of PPAR (Fig. 2c and
2d). We used, in HEK293FT cells, a luciferase reporter gene containing three copies of the
DR1 sequence of the PPRE arranged in tandem and linked to the thymidine kinase promoter

(PPRE-3X-TK)19. The four PPARγ mutant proteins had significantly lower levels of
transcriptional activity than the wild type even in the presence of rosiglitazone, a synthetic
PPARγ agonist (activity reduced by 25% to 90%) (Fig. 2c). We further focused on the two
most inactive mutants that affect the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPAR, F310S and
H494Y. We showed that their overexpression in the basal bladder cell line 5637 induced a
significantly lower expression of several known PPARγ target genes (FABP4 and ACSL5)
compared to the wild-type protein as shown by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2d). The effects of the
mutants were comparable to that of the empty plasmid, suggesting an absence of
transcriptional activity of the proteins in this system. The results of these two different
approaches to measure PPAR transcriptional activity clearly showed that PPAR mutations
F310S and H494Y are loss-of-function mutations affecting basal tumors.

Loss-of-function mutations impair the release of corepressors and recruitment of
coactivators by PPAR in the presence of ligand.
We then performed biochemical and biophysical analyses to understand how these two
mutations impair PPARγ activity. F310S is located in the N-ter of helix 3 facing the loop
between helices 11 and 12 whereas the H494Y mutation involves a residue at the N-terminal
boundary of helix 12 (Fig. 3a). Native electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that the
purified recombinant LBD wild-type and mutants (Supplementary Figs. 2-3) were not bound
to any ligand (Supplementary Fig. 4). We used nano differential scanning fluorimetry to
compare the thermal stability of the purified PPARγ WT and mutants, alone and upon
binding to the agonist ligand, GW1929 (Supplementary Fig. 2c). The two mutants in their
apo form exhibited a lower melting temperature (Tm) than the WT with a Tm of 1°C and
2°C for F310S and H494Y, respectively. Of note, GW1929 induced a strong stabilization of
the WT, as well as of the 2 mutants, suggesting that the 2 mutations do not significantly
affect the binding of GW1929. Both mutants efficiently formed heterodimers with RXR

similarly to PPAR wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We therefore focused on the ability of
mutations to modulate PPAR binding to corepressors and coactivators, which involves
recognition of motifs on coregulators by the LBD, and ultimately regulates the transcriptional
output of target genes. To study the binding of PPARto corepressor and coactivator
proteins, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assay in HEK293FT cells, using VP16-fused
PPAR (wild-type, F310S and H494Y), GAL4-DNA-binding-domain-fused co-repressor
(NCoR1 or SMRT) or co-activator MED1 and pG5-LUC reporter. We showed that in the
context of full protein and in presence of exogenous ligand (rosiglitazone), the two mutations
significantly favored the binding of the two co-repressor peptides and inhibited the
recruitment of MED1 coactivator domain compared to PPARγ wild-type (Fig. 3b). The lower
recruitment of the coactivator and increased recruitment of the corepressors by the two
mutants was confirmed by monitoring coregulator peptide recruitment by the different LBDs
(Fig.3c). We measured the interaction between wild-type or mutant forms of PPARγ and a
fluorescently labeled coactivator peptide of PGC1α (PPARGC1A) or a fluorescent labeled
NCoR1 corepressor peptide, by MicroScale Thermophoresis. In the absence of ligand, the
WT recruited the coactivator peptide with higher affinity than the two mutants (Fig. 3c). The
addition of a full agonist, rosiglitazone (Supplementary Fig. 5), enhanced the interaction
between PPAR and PGC1α coactivator peptide, with the WT exhibiting again the highest
affinity. On the other hand, the 2 mutants exhibited increased affinity for the corepressor
peptide of NCoR1 compared to WT (Fig. 3c). The increased interaction with corepressor
and decreased interaction with coactivator of the mutants was also observed by native mass
spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. 6-8). Together, these data suggest that the two
considered mutations, F310S and H494Y, impair the adoption of an agonist conformation
by PPARγ in the presence of ligand, thereby enhancing corepressor interactions and
inhibiting coactivator interaction.

PPAR LBD mutations F310S and H494Y favor an inactive conformation
To elucidate the structural basis for the deleterious functional effects of the mutations,
we analyzed the crystal structures of PPARγ LBD F310S and H494Y (Supplementary Table
2). PPARγ F310 LBD mutant was crystallized in complex with GW1929 and PPAR H494Y
LBD in complex with GW1929 and the PGC1coactivator peptide. Although the two
mutants were less active than the wild-type protein, the ligand and/or coactivator peptide
concentration used for crystallization allowed the proteins complexes to be crystallized in an
active conformation. The GW1929 agonist ligand in the two mutant complexes maintained
the same position as the WT complex forming similar interactions 16 with the exception, in
the F310S mutant, of the presence of two water molecules as a consequence of a larger
binding pocket (Supplementary Fig. 9).
In the WT complex, H494 in helix 12 packs on top of V318 (H3) and forms intra-helical
interactions with P495 and L496 that both contribute to a hydrophobic surface on which the
coactivator packs (Fig. 4a). In the H494Y mutant, the side chain pointed toward loop 2-3
and the side interactions with P495 and L496 were lost suggesting a destabilization of helix
12. Due to the Y494 side chain re-orientation, Y494 forms new interactions with residues
F315 (H3) and F292 and H294 (loop 2-3) of the mutant.
In the other mutant of interest, the bulky F310 side chain faces the loop 11-12 and is
involved in van der Waals interactions with F388 (H7), I484 (H11) and M491 (loop 11-12).
Because of the smaller size of the S310 side chain, these interactions are lost (Fig. 4b) and
induce a more flexible conformation of the loop 11-12. In contrast S310 hydroxyl group
interacts with the carbonyl moiety of Q311 and a water molecule. These variations in helix
11 and loop11-12 interactions will result in H12 destabilization and less efficient recruitment
of coactivator. Overall, these data suggest that the two studied mutations, F310S and
H494Y, are important residues for proper stabilization of helix 12 of PPARγ, preventing
proper corepressor release and coactivator interaction.

PPAR displays an inhibitory effect on basal bladder cancer cells growth
The down-regulation of PPAR in basal tumors suggested a potential tumor suppressive
activity of PPAR in these tumors. The association of PPAR downregulation with PPAR
genomic deletions, DNA hypermethylation and of loss-of-function mutations, although rare
events in basal tumors (observed in 4 out of 188 basal tumors, Fig. 2b), strongly reinforced
this hypothesis. Activation of PPAR by synthetic agonists has been a matter of debate
regarding the PPAR independent-effects of such molecules20. Therefore, to study the ability
of PPAR activation to inhibit basal bladder cancer cell proliferation, we transiently
expressed PPARin three cell lines presenting a low PPAR activation score and a low
PPAR expression level (UMUC-3, unclassified; UMUC-6 and VMCUB-1, Basal/Squamous
cell lines), as well as in one luminal papillary cell line, SD48, which diplays a high expression
level of PPAR, a high PPAR activation score and relies on PPAR expression for its growth
8

(Fig. 5a and 5b). PPAR overexpression, observed by western-blot or RT-qPCR analysis

(Supplementary Fig. 10a and 10c ), activated a PPAR-dependent transcription program
(Supplementary Fig. 10a) in the four cell lines. PPAR overexpression induced a significant
decrease in cell viability in the three cell lines expressing low levels of endogenous PPAR,
but did not affect the growth of SD48 cells (Figure 5b). Using UMUC-6 basal cells, we
confirmed that the observed effects with the wild-type receptor or the activating mutation
T475M were dependent on PPAR activity since the overexpression of the inactive mutant
of PPAR, H494Y, had no effect neither on cell viability nor on PPAR target gene
expression (Fig. 5c and supplementary Fig. 10a-c). The tumor supressive role of PPAR in
basal tumors was further supported by our attempt to establish stable clones of basal
UMUC-6 cells. We were only able to obtain a few clones with the wild-type or T475M PPAR
constructs, which turned out not to express PPAR, whereas we obtained PPAR-

expressing clones using H494Y PPAR construct (Supplementary Fig. 10d). To better
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this tumor suppressive property of
PPAR, we compared UMUC-6 transcriptomic data after transient transfection using either
a control backbone or a PPAR encoding plasmid. We identified 459 differentially expressed
genes using LIMMA algorithm and considering a p-value<0.05 (Supplementary table 3).
Analysis of the biological processes enriched in these genes using DAVID software
highlighted that, as previously observed in luminal bladder cell lines, PPAR expression
induced an increased lipid metabolism8,9,14 and impaired immunity and inflammation15.
However, PPAR expression also induced a down-regulation of two sets of genes favoring
cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Fig.5d). The regulation of these two process by
PPAR could account for the inhibition of cell viability induced upon PPAR expression in
basal cell lines. Focussing on the list of urothelial differentiation markers recently provided
by Liu et al.4, we also confirmed the role of PPARG in inducing differentiation (Fig. 5e).
However, as described by Warrick et al.21, PPAR expression alone is not sufficient to
transduce basal cells into luminal ones according to our consensus classifier for cell lines.
We also performed a GSEA analysis of regulated genes using Reactome database which
highlighted the up-regulation of “fatty acid metabolism” and ”fatty acid beta oxydation” as
well as an increase of ”FOXO-mediated transcription of cell death genes”. A potential
involvement of the EGFR pathway in the regulation of cell growth was suggested by the
down-regulation of “GRB2 events in EGFR signaling”, which included a downregulation in
gene expression of EGFR and its ligands EREG and EPGN (Supplementary Figure 11). We
further validated this finding at the protein level by western-blot in UMUC-6, VMCUB1 and
UMUC-3: PPAR expression induced a down regulation of Aurora B, AXL and EGFR levels,
which could regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (Fig.5f). The down-regulations likely
relied on PPAR activity since they were stronger after the expression of the active mutant

of PPAR T475M but not observed after the expression of the inactive mutant PPAR H494Y
(Fig.5f, UMUC-6 cells).

Discussion
Previous studies have suggested a tumor suppressor role for PPAR in bladder cancer,
based on its observed down-regulation in a subset of tumors and on the inhibitory effects of
PPAR agonist on bladder cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo

22–25.

Simvastatin-induced

inhibition of bladder cancer cell growth was also attributed to the activation of the PPAR
pathway, further supporting its tumor suppressor role in bladder tumors26. In this study, we
provided epigenetic, genetic and functionnal evidence to demonstrate the tumor suppressor
role for PPAR and we associated this role to a particular subgroup of tumors, the basal
subtype. In order to demonstrate its tumor suppressive properties, we overexpressed
PPARin basal or unclassified cell lines expressing low levels of PPAR, including UMUC3 cells in which PPAR expression induced comparable results to those observed recently
using agonists23. These finding suggest that the observed effects using agonist molecules
were more likely PPAR-dependent. In addition, the other cell lines for which PPAR
agonists have been shown to induce cell growth inhibition 22–25 happened to be unclassified
or basal using our consensus molecular classifier and thus supports the use of PPAR
synthetic agonists as a therapeutic option for basal tumors. The possible reactivation of
PPAR in basal tumors by agonists despite low expression levels in tumors presenting
hemizygous deletions and/or promoter hypermethylation, and the fact that inactivating
mutations did not seem to display dominant negative effects are in favor of an haploinsufficiency of PPAR. This mechanism of action of PPAR has already been suggested in
lipodystrophy27. A better understanding of the molecular basis of the tumor suppressive
activity of PPAR in basal bladder tumors may lay the groundwork to propose alternative
therapeutic strategies to indirectly target the PPARpathway, in order to avoid various side

effects induced by the available PPARsynthetic agonists 28,29. We previsouly showed that
basal tumors present an activation of the EGFR pathway and rely on EGFR activity for their
growth in vitro and in vivo18. Here, we showed that PPAR overexpression in basal cell lines
induces a down-regulation of EGFR and its ligands, which was, at least for EGFR,
dependent on PPAR activity, since not observed upon the overexpression of the inactive
mutant of PPARG, H494Y. These results suggest that the decreased cell viability induced
by PPARoverexpression may be partly EGFR-mediated. A tumor suppressor role for
PPAR has already been reported for several cancer types including colon, lung, breast and
ovarian cancers, but the relationship with the EGFR pathway has not been reported in these
cancers. So far, the tumor suppressive properties of PPAR have been more linked to antiangiogenic effects30 or to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) level due to a
metabolic switch induced by PPAR31. The modulation of fatty acid metabolism and
mitochondrial beta-oxydation by PPAR in basal bladder cancer cell could also contribute to
its tumor suppressive activities. In vivo studies should allow studying the impact of PPAR
expression on angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment and their contribution on tumor
growth. Inactivating mutations, altough not frequent, seem to be bladder cancer-specific, but
deletions or methylation appear to be the main causes of PPAR loss of activity. Inactivating
mutations were initially reported in colon cancer but remain controversial since they have
never been observed in independent cohorts32. A better knowledge of the structure/function
effects of the loss-of-function mutation of PPAR could also guide the design of new potent
and more specific agonists.
Together with our previous studies that put forth the pro-tumorigenic role of
PPARassociated with DNA amplification and gain-of-function mutations8,16 in luminal
tumors, this study highlights a dual role of PPAR in bladder cancers. The therapeutic
strategies targeting PPAR should therefore be tumor subtype-dependent, strengthening

the interest for the application of the molecular classification in the clinic. The dual role of
PPAR also suggest that the risk of bladder cancer associated with the use of
pioglitazone33,34 should be associated with the development of luminal tumors. The cell
context dependent effect of PPAR has already been shown in breast and colon cancer35–
37.

A better understanding of the signaling pathways activated by the receptor to mediate

both its pro-tumorigenic and tumor suppressive effects should help further our
understanding of the relation between cell context, in particular cell differentiation, and
PPAR activity in bladder cancer but also in other tumor types.

Methods
Materials and chemicals. Rosiglitazone and GW1929 were purchased from Tocris
Bioscience. The fluorescent PGC1α peptide (137-EAEEPSLLKKLLLAPA-152) and
fluorescent NCoR1 peptide (2260-NLGLEDIIRKALMG-2273) were purchased from ThermoFisher.

The

PGC1

peptide

(139-EEPSLLKKLLLAPA-152)

and

NCoR

(2258-

ASNLGLEDIIRKALMGS-2274) were synthesized by Pascal Eberling (IGBMC peptide
synthesis common facility).

Transcriptomic, genomic, methylation and ChIPseq data. We used transcriptomic
data available for our CIT series of tumors8,18 and for 405 MIBC from TCGA
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov). We used our affymetrix exon st.0 and U133 plus2.0
transcriptomic data18 available for RT112, L1207, VMCUB-1, UMUC-3, UMUC-6 cell lines.
Tumors and cell lines were classified using a molecular consensus classification system 11
and PPARG activation score were calculated as previously described taking into
consideration the expression levels of 77 PPARG target genes16. We used publicly available
copy number data for 402 MIBC from TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov). We used

methylation data (450k methylation array) available for 368 MIBC from TCGA and for 59
samples from our CIT series. We used histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K9me3) ChIPseq data
for RT112, SD48 and L12017 and 5637 cell lines available in the GEO database:
GSE104804 and GSE140891.
Plasmid constructs. The pcDNA3-PPAR2 and PPRE X3-TK-luc were generously
provided by Pr. Chatterjee (Institute of Metabolic Science, IMS, Cambridge) and Bruce
Spiegelman (Addgene plasmid #1015), respectively. We used pcDNA3.1-PPAR2 and the
QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, to generate all the mutations. Mutations were confirmed by DNA
sequencing. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain cloning vector pM and the activation-domain
cloning vector pVP16 are part of the Mammalian Matchmaker Two-Hybrid Assay kit (BD
Biosciences Clontech). The construct pM-MED1 (510-787) expressing the Gal4 DBD-MED1
nuclear receptor interacting domain was provided by Lieve Verlinden (KU Leuven, Belgium).
The pCMX-GAL4N-SMRT was a gift of Makoto Makishima (Nihon University School of
Medicine). The Gal4 DBD-NCoR1 NRID was kindly provided by William Bourget (Centre de
Biochimie Structurale, Montpellier, France).

Cell culture and transfection. The HEK293FT human cell line and the UMUC-6,
UMUC-3, VMCUB-1, RT112 and 5637 human bladder tumor-derived cell lines were
obtained from DSMZ (Heidelberg, Germany). HEK293FT, UMUC-6, UMUC-3, VMCUB-1,
L1207 cells were cultured in DMEM, whereas 5637 and RT112 cells were cultured in RPMI.
Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were incubated at 37°C,
under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The identity of the cell lines used was checked
by analyzing genomic alterations with comparative genomic hybridization arrays (CGH
array), and FGFR3 and TP53 mutations were checked with the SNaPshot technique (for

FGFR3) or by classical sequencing (for TP53). The results obtained were compared with
the initial description of the cells. We routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination.
For reporter gene assays, HEK293FT cells were plated in 96-well plates (30,000
cells/well) and transfected with 30 ng pcDNA3-PPAR2 (wild-type or mutated), 50 ng PPRE
X3-TK-luc and 6 ng pRL-SV40 (Promega), in the presence of the Fugene HD transfection
reagent (Promega), in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were stimulated
with 1µM rosiglitazone 24 hours later. Luciferase activity was determined 24 hours later, with
the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and the results obtained were normalized with the Renilla luciferase signal
obtained with the pRL-SV40 plasmid.
For PPARγ2 transient overexpression in the 5637 cell line, we used six-well plates,
250,000 cells seeded per well. These cells were transfected 24 h later with 2.5 µg of
pcDNA3-PPARγ2 (wild-type or mutated) in the presence of the Fugene HD transfection
reagent (Promega). PPARγ2 transient overexpression in the UMUC3, UMUC6, VMCUB1
and SD48 cell lines were performed in six-well plates, 500,000 cells were seeded per well
for the UMUC3 cell line, and 250,000 cells for the three other cell lines. Cells were
transfected 24 h later with 2.5 µg of pRP-PPARG2 wild-type or mutated vector (Vector
Builder) in the presence of Fugene HD transection reagent according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega). The cells were selected 24h after transfection with 4µg/mL of
puromycin for 24h, and then seeded at respectively 7,000, 3,000, 3,000 and 2,500 cells per
wells in ninety-six-well plates. Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay (Promega) 72h later and normalized by the signal obtained just after
plating.
RNA was extracted with the RNA easy mini kit (Qiagen) and proteins were extracted by
cell lysis in Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) supplemented
with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) 48 h after transfection.

For mammalian two-hybrid assay, HEK293FT cells were plated in 96-well plates (30 000
cells/ well) and transfected with 20 ng pV16-PPAR2 (wild-type or mutated), 20 ng pMMED1, 50 ng pG5-luc (Promega) reporter plasmid and 6 ng pRL-SV40 (Promega), in the
presence of the Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was determined 48 hours later, with the DualGlo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and the results obtained were normalized with the Renilla luciferase signal obtained with the
pRL-SV40 plasmid.

Immunoblotting. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The protein concentration
of the supernatants was determined with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Ten µg
of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 4-15% polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred
onto Biorad nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with primary antibodies against PPAR
(Abcam #ab41928, used at 1/1000) and β-actin (Sigma Aldrich #A2228, used at 1/25,000).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology # 7074,
used at 1/3,000) was used as the secondary antibody. Protein loading was checked by
staining the membrane with Amido Black after electroblotting.

Real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription was
performed with 1 µg of total RNA, and a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems). cDNAs were amplified by PCR in a Roche real-time thermal cycler,
with the Roche Taqman master mix (Roche) and Taqman probe/primer pairs that we
previously used and described16. Relative gene expression was analyzed by the delta delta
Ct method, with TBP as the reference.

Biochemistry. The sequences encoding the ligand-binding domain of the His-hPPARγ
(231-505) receptors was inserted into pET15b. Point mutations were introduced into PPARγ
with the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.
The corresponding proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 by overnight
incubation at 22°C after induction with 1 mM IPTG at an OD600 of ~0.8. Soluble proteins
were purified by Ni-NTA chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography on a
Superdex 200 (GE) column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5%
glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. The proteins were concentrated to 3-6 mg/mL with an Amicon
Ultra 10 kDa MWCO. Purity and homogeneity of all proteins were assessed by SDS and
Native Page (Supplementary Fig.2).

Crystallization, X-ray data collection and crystal structure refinement. The
crystallization experiments were performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 290 K, mixing
equal volumes (200 nL) of protein at 5 mg/mL and reservoir solution. For all crystal
structures, the data were indexed and integrated with XDS38 and scaled with AIMLESS39,40.
The structure was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER41 and refined with
PHENIX42 and BUSTER43 with TLS refinement, followed by iterative model building in
COOT44.
Crystals of PPAR F310S-GW1929 were grown in 25% PEG3350, 0.2 M LiSO4, BisTris
0.1M pH 6.5, transferred to artificial mother liquor containing 35% PEG3350 and flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at PX1 beamline of the
SOLEIL synchrotron with a wavelength of 0.979 Å. The final structure was refined to Rwork
and Rfree values of 16.8 and 20.6%, respectively, with excellent geometry (97.27% of
residues in favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 2.73% in the allowed region).
Crystals of PPAR H494Y-GW1929-PGC1α were grown in 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M

Hepes pH 7.5, trisodium citrate 1.2M, transferred to artificial mother liquor containing 15%
glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the
ID30A3 beamline of ESRF with a wavelength of 0.968 Å. The final structure was refined to
Rwork and Rfree values of 17.22 and 20.30%, respectively, with excellent geometry (97.81
% of residues in favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 2.19% in the allowed region).
Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Supplementary Table 1. GW1929
and side chains of the mutated residues of H494Y and F310S complexes could be modelled
with confidence as shown into the Polder omit maps45 displaying reduced model bias and
exclusion of solvent molecules (Supplementary Fig. 3b and 3c). All structural figures were
prepared with PyMOL (www.pymol.org/).

Microscale thermophoresis measurements were performed with a Monolith NT.115
instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Munchen, Germany). The PPARγ
complexes were prepared in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 0.05% Tween
20. Each measurement consists of 16 reaction mixtures where the fluorescent-labeled
peptide concentration was constant (70 nM) and serial dilutions of PPARγ LBD from a
concentration of 100 μM down to 2 nM. Measurements were made with standard glass
capillaries (Nanotemper) at 25°C, at 20-40% LED excitation and 80% MST power, with a
laser-on time of 30 s and a laser-off time of 5s. NanoTemper Analysis 2.3 software was used
to fit the data and to determine the Kd.

Thermal unfolding, nanoDSF. Fluorescence based thermal experiments were
performed using Prometheus NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies, Germany) with capillaries
containing 10 μL PPAR WT or mutants at 4mg/ml. The temperature was increased by a
rate of 1 °C/min from 20 to 95 °C and the fluorescence at emission wavelengths of 330 nm

and 350 nm was measured. NanoTemper PR.Stability Analysis v1.0.2 was used to fit the
data and to determine the melting temperatures Tm.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, PPAR and all the
different mutant proteins were buffer exchanged against 200 mM of ammonium acetate at
pH 6.8, using five cycles of concentration/dilution with a microconcentrator (Vivaspin, 10-KD
cutoff, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). All the samples were diluted either in
H2O/ACN/HCOOH (denaturing MS conditions) or in 200 mM AcONH4 (native MS
conditions) to a final concentration of 5 µM and infused with an automated chip based
nanoelectrospray device (Triversa Nanomate, Advion Bioscience, Ithaca, USA) operating in
the positive ion mode, coupled to a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters,
Manchester, UK).
Affymetrix DNA array
In order to identify genes displaying changes in expression after PPAR transient expression
in UM-UC-6 cells, we transfected the cells for 96 hours with pRP-PPARG2 wild-type or
backbone vector (Vector Builder). Three independent transfections were performed. mRNA
was extracted and purified with RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). Total RNA (200 ng) from control
and PPAR expressing UM-UC6 cells was analyzed with the Affymetrix Human Clariom R
DNA array. Raw gene expression data were normalized and summarized by the RMA
(robust multi-array averaging) method (R package affy) with a customized chip definition
developed by Microarray Lab, BrainArray (ClariomDHuman_Hs_ENTREZG_v22)46,47
The LIMMA algorithm was used to identify genes differentially expressed after PPARG
expression. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by Benjamini–Hochberg FDR
methods. Genes with a FDR below 5% were considered to be differentially expressed.

Figure 1: Hemizygous deletions and DNA hypermethylation are associated with loss
of expression of PPAR in basal bladder tumors. a) Expression level of PPAR in 336
bladder tumors from our CIT series of tumors (Affymetrix U133 plus2.0 signal) and in 405
MIBCs from TCGA (RNA-seq). Tumors were classified according to a consensus molecular
classification that defines six subgroups of MIBC (Kamoun et al., 2018). PPAR expression
levels in stroma-rich, basal/squamous (Ba/Sq) and in Neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) tumors
were compared to those in luminal tumors, comprising luminal papillary (LumP), Luminal
non specified (LumNS) and Luminal unstable (LumU) tumors using Dunnett's multiple
comparison test, **** p<0.0001. b) Expression level and activity of PPAR were compared
in relation to PPAR copy number alterations in 385 MIBCs from TCGA using Dunnett's
multiple comparison test, **** p<0.0001.c) Frequency of genomic heterozygous deletion of
PPAR in the different consensus subgroups of MIBC. Enrichment or depletion in genomic
PPAR deletion in the different subgroups were evaluated using Fisher exact t-test, *

dataset for basal (green) and luminal (red) tumors (upper panel), correlation of CpG
methylation and PPAR expression (middle panel) and heatmap representing centered
methylation score for each tumor (lower panel). Enrichment in CpG methylation in the
different subgroups were evaluated using 2way ANOVA test, * 0.01<p<0.05; *** 0.0001<p<

from TCGA and CIT series respectively, for which both PPAR mutation data and
transcriptomic data were available. c) A reporter plasmid containing the firefly luciferase
gene under the control of a PPRE-X3-TK promoter was co-expressed in HEK293FT cells
with a pcDNA3 vector encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant PPARγ2 associated with basal
tumors (S74C, F310S, E455Q, H494Y). Cells were stimulated with 1µM rosiglitazone.
Renilla luciferase, expressed under the control of the CMV promoter, was used to normalize
the signal. The data shown are the means ± SD of one representative experiment conducted
in triplicate. The results for each mutant were compared with those for the wild-type using
Dunnett's multiple comparison test, *** 0.0001<p<0.001; **** p<0.0001 d) 5637 basal cells
were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3 vector encoding wild-type (WT) or mutant of the
LBD domain (F310S, H494Y) PPAR. The expression of all PPARγ forms was checked by
western blotting, -actin was used as loading control (lower panel). The expression of two
PPARγ target genes was normalized against TBP expression and is shown as percentage
relative to the expression induced by wild-type PPARγ (upper panel). The data are presented
as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The results for each mutant were
compared with those for the wild type using Dunnett's multiple comparison test:

PGC1 peptide (right) interactions as determined by microscale thermophoresis. Unlabeled
PPAR LBD protein was titrated into a fixed concentration of fluorescently labeled peptide
in the absence of ligand. Isotherms were averaged over three consecutive measurements
and fitted according to the law of mass action to yield the apparent Kd. Each plot is
representative of at least two independent experiments performed with different batches of
protein preparation.
