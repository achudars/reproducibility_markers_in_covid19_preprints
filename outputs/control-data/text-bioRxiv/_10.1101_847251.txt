ABSTRACT

18

As glyphosate-based herbicides, sold under the commercial name Roundup®, represent the most

19

used herbicides in the world, contamination of the freshwater environment by glyphosate has

20

become a widespread issue. In Italy, glyphosate was detected in half of the surface waters

21

monitoring sites and its concentrations were higher than environmental quality standards in 24.5%

22

of them. It can last from days to months in water, leading to exposure for aquatic organisms and

23

specifically to amphibians’ larvae that develop in shallow water bodies with proven effects to

24

development and behaviour. In this study, we tested the effects of a 96h exposure during embryonic

25

development of marsh frog’s tadpoles to three ecologically relevant Roundup® Power 2.0

26

concentrations. As expected, given the low concentrations tested, no mortality was observed.

27

Morphological measurements highlighted a reduction in the total length in tadpoles exposed to 7.6

28

mg a.e./L, while an increase was observed at lower concentrations of 0.7 and 3.1 mg a.e./L

29

compared to control group. Tadpoles raised in 7.6 mg a.e./L also showed a smaller tail membrane

30

than those raised in the control solution. Regarding behaviour, we tested tadpoles in two different

31

sessions (Gosner stages 25 and 28/29) for lateralization, antipredator response and basal activity.

32

Lower intensity of lateralization was detected in tadpoles raised at the highest Roundup®

33

concentration in the first session of observation, while no significant difference among treatments

34

was observed in the second one. In both sessions, effects of glyphosate embryonic exposure on

35

antipredator response, measured as the proportional change in activity after the injection of tadpole-

36

fed predator (Anax imperator) cue, were not detected. Tadpoles exposed during embryonic

37

development to Roundup® exhibited lower basal activity than the control group, with the strongest

38

reduction for the 7.6 mg a.e./L treatment. Our results reinforce the concern of glyphosate

39

contamination impact on amphibians.

INTRODUCTION

44

Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are between the most sold broad-spectrum herbicides in the

45

world (Duke and Powles, 2008), whose use reaches nearly 100 million kilograms on an annual basis

46

(Grube et al., 2011). The active ingredient, glyphosate, appears in several alternative formulations,

47

altogether known under the commercial name Roundup® (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).

48

Glyphosate use spans different applications, from no-tillage farming and conventional agriculture to

49

non-cultivated areas, forest management and private gardening (Dill, 2005; Dill et al., 2010). Its use

50

is approved until 2022 by the European Union (European Commission, 2017), however in Italy its

51

application is restricted during harvest and threshing, and banned in public gardens and parks,

52

schools, private gardening and health facilities (Italian Ministry of Health, 2016). Although the

53

aforementioned restrictions, a recent report concerning surface waters pesticide contamination

54

highlighted the presence of this molecule in 47.4% of the Surface Waters Monitoring Sites in Italy

55

(SWMS), with its concentration exceeding the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) in 24.5% of

56

them (ISPRA, 2018).

57

As this molecule has been engineered to kill plants, specifically post-emergent leaves and

58

grasses, glyphosate is considered to have low mammalian toxicity, being “practically non-toxic” for

59

bees, birds and most aquatic organisms, according to the World Health Organization/Food and

60

Agriculture Organization (Lajmanovich et al., 2011). Microorganism degrade the active ingredient

61

into its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), which is eventually oxidized into carbon

62

dioxide, in both soil and water. Since the rate of degradation is strictly dependent on physical (e.g.

63

temperature) and chemical (e.g. pH) environmental conditions, glyphosate’s half-life can last from

64

days to months (e.g. 7–70 days in the water; Giesy et al., 2000), leading to possible chronic

65

exposures for organisms living in certain environments (Feng et al., 1990; Borggaard and Gimsing,

66

2008; Bailey et al., 2018). GBH formulations are generally more toxic than glyphosate by itself,

67

mainly due to the presence of surfactants (e.g. polyoxyethylene - POE, polyethoxylated tallow

68

amine - POEA). Previous studies showed that the toxicity of GBHs to aquatic organisms is largely

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

69

caused by the surfactant in the mixture (Edginton et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2012). These substances

70

may not only cause toxicity by themselves, but also facilitate the penetration of the active ingredient

71

in animal cells causing teratogenic effects, as shown in amphibian embryos and tadpoles of several

72

species (Borggaard and Gimsing, 2008; Paganelli et al., 2010; Bonfanti et al., 2018; Gill et al.,

73

2018).

74

To date, GBHs have been proved to affect amphibians’ development through growth

75

retardation and weight reduction during larval stages, especially in anurans (Smith, 2001; Cauble

76

and Wagner, 2005; Lanctôt et al., 2014; Navarro-Martín et al., 2014). Furthermore, GBHs have

77

been shown to alter behaviour in aquatic organisms, like fishes and amphibians, involving

78

locomotion, memory, visual and olfactory senses and antipredator responses (Tierney et al., 2006;

79

Moore et al., 2015; Besson et al., 2017; Bridi et al., 2017; Mikò et al., 2017). In the poecilid

80

Cnesterodon decemmaculatus, exposure to GBHs during development has been proven to cause a

81

significant inhibitory effect on AChE (acetylcholinesterase) activity in the tail (Menéndez-Helman

82

et al., 2012). The inhibition of this enzyme, involved in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter

83

acetylcholine in muscle and nerve synapses and thus in the end of a transmission of a neural

84

impulse (Zimmerman and Soreq, 2006; Tripathi and Srivastava, 2010), leads to a possible reduction

85

of basal activity. Nonetheless, another study demonstrated that AChE activity increases in tadpoles

86

of the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus, the green toad Bufotes viridis, and the African clawed

87

toad Xenopus laevis exposed to GBH formulations (Güngördü, 2013). This finding however is still

88

unmatched by other studies, at least for anurans since glyphosate instead decreased AChE activity

89

in tadpoles of the toad Rhinella arenarum in a study by Lajmanovich and colleagues (2011).

90

An additional negative effect of herbicide water contamination could be lateralization

91

impairment (Besson et al., 2017). Brain lateralization is the difference between the activity of the

92

right and left hemisphere in the execution of several tasks, implying the preferential use of one body

93

portion over the other (Davidson and Hugdahl, 1996; Bisazza et al., 1998). Laterality is thought to

94

augment cognitive abilities, by optimizing the processing of information in the two-separate brain

95

hemispheres, thus enhancing the ability to make decisions when facing novel multi-sensory stimuli

96

(Vallortigara and Rogers, 2005; Salva et al., 2012). Defence against predators is a well-known

97

lateralized behaviour in vertebrates, as the recognition and escape performances seem to depend on

98

the side of appearance of a predatory threat (Siniscalchi et al., 2010; Shibasaki et al., 2014). Fishes,

99

birds, and reptiles have shown eye preference when keeping track of predators or choosing for a

100

prevalent escape direction in predatory risk conditions (Sovrano et al., 2005; Koboroff et al., 2008;

101

Martín et al., 2010; Pellitteri-Rosa and Gazzola, 2018).

102

In larval amphibians, defensive behaviour is generally activated by chemical (olfactory)

103

cues, released in the water both by injured conspecifics (alarm cue) as well as by predators

104

(kairomones). It has been shown that glyphosate negatively affects the functionality of the olfactory

105

system by inactivating the chemical cues conveying information on predation risk, thus inhibiting

106

predator recognition, or by lowering the learning ability of tadpoles (Mandrillon and Saglio, 2007a,

107

b; Moore et al., 2015). An altered olfactory system could in turn weaken defensive responses and

108

negatively affect tadpoles’ survival in their natural environment.

109

Behavioural alterations may appear when tadpoles develop in the contaminated medium (i.e.

110

chronic exposure), or alternatively when adults are exposed, even briefly, to the substance (i.e.

111

acute-transitory exposure). Therefore, contaminants may affect amphibians at every life stage, with

112

negative effect on growth and reproduction, and finally survival of the single individual likewise the

113

entire population (Relyea, 2005; Gill et al., 2018). The complex life cycle of anurans, which shifts

114

their biological cycle from water to terrestrial habitats and the assumption that several

115

environmental cues experienced during embryonic development can affect the range of

116

physiological and behavioural responses available as adults (Dufty et al., 2002), makes them an

117

ideal candidate to explore the effects of pollutants during development.

118

In this study, we explored the effects of glyphosate on the morphology and some fitness-

119

related behavioural traits in tadpoles of a widely distributed European anuran, the marsh frog P.

120

ridibundus, by exposing embryos to different ecologically relevant concentrations of the

121

commercial GBH Roundup® Power 2.0 (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). P. ridibundus eggs

122

are frequently found in areas with vegetation, wetlands, agricultural areas, and urban regions where

123

the presence of pesticides could be significant. Our aims were to investigate the possible effects of

124

early (embryonic) exposure to RU-PW on: (1) total length and tail depth, to detect growth

125

retardation; (2) lateralization, as a proxy of the correct development of the nervous system of the

126

tadpole; (3) level of activity (both basal and in the presence of a predatory stimulus), to infer the

127

ability of the individual to correctly cope with important environmental pressures (i.e. predation).

128

Previous studies showed that P. ridibundus tadpoles are more resistant to glyphosate-based

129

herbicide than other species of anurans (Güngördü, 2013). Nonetheless, adults of this species

130

demonstrated a slight increase in the hepatosomatic index (HSI) when exposed via intraperitoneal to

131

0.138 × 10−3 mL Roundup®/g per body mass (Păunescu and Ponepal, 2011). According to previous

132

findings, we expect to find a relationship between glyphosate exposure and both tadpoles

133

morphological and behavioural traits. At the same time, we also expect these effects to only appear

134

at particular developmental stages and have little or no effect on the long-term survival of

135

individuals, as a result of general high resistance of the species to environmental stressors, like

136

xenobiotics.

Animals collection and breeding

141
142

The marsh frog is an anuran endemic to Central and Eastern Europe. In Italy, native populations of

143

this taxon only occur at the edge of the Northern-Eastern region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Lanza et

144

al., 2006). Nonetheless, several populations of this frog had been introduced in Italy for edible

145

purposes. According to the Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa (EICAT) of the

146

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the species is considered one of the

147

invasive species with the highest potential to impact native species diversity worldwide, because of

148

its ability to occupy a wide variety of habitats on one hand, and to hybridize with native taxa, thus

149

producing viable and fertile hybrids, on the other (Kumschick et al., 2017).

150

Adult marsh frogs were collected at night on June 15th, 2018, from an artificial pond situated

151

in the municipality of Mezzolombardo (46.19°N, 11.09°E, TN, Italy). Here, previous surveys had

152

highlighted the presence of water frogs that were ascribed to P. ridibundus following molecular

153

analysis. Frogs were captured using fishing nets and transported to the laboratory of the Department

154

of Earth and Environmental Sciences of the University of Pavia. Until the beginning of the 96h

155

exposure, frogs were kept in plastic tanks filled with dechlorinated tap water and fed with crickets

156

(Acheta domesticus) ad libitum.

157

Embryos of P. ridibundus used in the 96h exposure were obtained through in vitro

158

fertilization following the procedure for anuran breeding provided by Pruvost (2013), and Berger et

159

al. (1994) with modifications (Bonfanti et al., 2004). Specifically, 24 h before egg collection, we

160

triggered ovulation stimulation by injecting both females and males (n = 6) with LHRH hormone

161

(BachemH-7525, Bubendorf, Switzerland) at a concentration of 2 mg in 100 mL Holtfreter’s

162

solution (Holtfreter, 1944). Individuals were injected into the dorsal lymph sac 10 µl/g of body

163

mass of hormone.

164

The male selected for the crossing was euthanized in a MS-222 solution (Sigma A-5040, St.

165

Gallen, Switzerland) at 2 mg/L. Testes were removed, put in 2 mL of cold DBT solution (Tris-HCL

166

10 m, pH 7.5) and minced to obtain a sperm suspension. Egg groups, obtained by gently massaging

167

the abdominal region of the females, were collected in 90-mm plastic Petri dishes and immediately

168

inseminated with sperm suspension; after 2 min, 30 ml of Holtfreter’s solution were added to each

169

Petri dish. Successful insemination was detected when after 30 min of incubation at 25 °C all the

170

eggs were oriented with the dark side (animal pole) up. Embryos (Gosner stages 4-5) were selected

171

under a stereomicroscope and the jelly coat was removed by swirling the embryos for 1-2 min in a

172

2.25% L cysteine solution (pH 8.1). All the fertilizations were performed on June 18th, 2018.

173

We collected five dragonfly larvae (Anax imperator) from a small pond situated in the

174

botanical garden in Pavia (45.18°N, 9.15°E, Italy) on July 2nd, 2018. They were individually kept in

175

800 mL cups filled with 500 mL of aged tap water and wooden sticks as perching sites. These

176

animals were later used for behavioural trials.

177
178

Roundup® Power 2.0 solutions

179
180

Roundup® Power 2.0 (Monsanto Italia S.P.A.), referred to as RU-PW, was formulated with a

181

guarantee of 360 g glyphosate acid equivalent (a.e.) per litre present as the potassium salt (CAS RN

182

70901-12-1), six percent by volume of ethoxylated ether alkyl ammine (CAS RN 68478-96-6) and

183

58.5% water and other ingredients not specified by the producer.

184

A stock solution of RU-PW at nominal concentration of 100 mg a.e./L using FETAX

185

solution was prepared. In according to previous experiments, we opted to use FETAX solution as

186

control, since it is the optimal solution for the development of water frogs. The composition in

187

mg/L was: NaCl 625, NaHCO3 96, KCl 30, CaCl2 15, CaSO4-2H2O 60, and MgSO4 70, pH 7.5–8.5

188

(Dawson and Bantle, 1987).

189
190

96h exposure test

191
192

Normally-cleaved embryos at the midblastula stage (Gosner stage 8; Gosner, 1960) five hours post

193

fertilization (hpf), were selected from each female (n = 2), assigned to the experimental groups (n =

194

15 per group) and placed in covered Petri dishes containing 40 mL of control (FETAX) or RU-PW

195

solution. For each treatment (three RU-PW concentrations and control) and for each female, five

196

replicas were performed for a total of 300 embryos per female.

197
198

RU-PW concentrations used for the 96h exposure were 0.7 mg a.e./L, 3.1 mg a.e./L and 7.6
mg a.e./L.; control treatment was represented by FETAX solution. Each experimental concentration

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

199

corresponded to one of the following three different scenarios: environmental concentration of the

200

herbicide without intervention (0.7 mg a.e./L), concentration occurring shortly after the application

201

of the herbicide (3.1 mg a.e./L), and concentration estimated in worst-case scenarios (e.g. direct

202

spraying in a flooded field, 7.6 mg a.e./L) (Wagner, 2013). Embryos were incubated in a

203

thermostatic chamber at 25 ± 0.5 °C and exposure solutions were renewed every 24 h (semi-static

204

conditions). The selected concentrations should not cause different mortality rates with respect to

205

the control group, since the estimated LC50 for RU-PW is 24.75 mg a.e./L for Xenopus laevis

206

(Bonfanti et al., 2018), a species considered more sensitive to Roundup than marsh frogs

207

(Güngordü, 2013).

208
209

Morphological measurements

210
211

At the end of the exposure period (96 hpf) we randomly selected a total of 220 tadpoles equally

212

balanced both for treatment and female. They were euthanized and formalin fixed and photographed

213

through a stereomicroscope equipped with a camera (AxioCam ERc5s) to estimate growth

214

retardation by measuring the total length and maximum tail height (Altig, 2017), using the

215

digitizing software AxioVision. Remaining individuals were reared in 16 plastic tanks (2 tanks per

216

treatment and female) filled with dechlorinated tap water (8 L), under natural light conditions. After

217

hatching, tadpoles were fed with rabbit food, and reunited in four plastic tanks according to

218

treatment (control, 0.7 mg a.e./L, 3.1 mg a.e./L, 7.60 mg a.e./L solutions) on July 2nd.

219
220

Behavioural trials: rotational preference, antipredator response and basal activity

221
222

We began the behavioural trials when tadpoles reached Gosner developmental stage 25 on July 3rd.

223

We recorded the activity of 200 tadpoles (n = 50 from each treatment) in the span of three days,

224

from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm. The tests consisted in recording the activity of individuals for 15 min,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

225

while measuring three distinct behavioural variables: rotational preference (i.e. lateralization),

226

antipredator response and basal activity.

227

Before starting the trials, each individual was placed in 100 × 20 mm Petri dishes filled with

228

60 ml of well-aged tap water for a period of acclimation (15 min). To measure rotational preference,

229

we recorded the time spent swimming in both clockwise and counterclockwise direction during the

230

first 10 min of the test. This is a well-established method for assessing lateralization in tadpoles

231

(Vandenberg and Levin, 2013; Lucon-Xiccato et al., 2016). Only clockwise and counterclockwise

232

movements made in the outer portion of the Petri dishes were measured. We recorded lateralization

233

only when tadpoles’ distance from the centre of the Petri dishes was at least 3 cm. Tadpoles that did

234

not move for the whole test were excluded from the analysis (12 tadpoles in the first session and no

235

tadpoles in the second one).

236

Tadpoles of many frog species are known to reduce level of activity after being exposed to

237

predatory cues, in particular when chemicals are produced by a familiar predator preying upon

238

conspecific prey (Ferrari and Chivers, 2009). Accordingly, for each trial we collected 1 mL of water

239

from four different plastic tanks (500 ml) containing Anax imperator larvae, which were fed on

240

conspecific tadpoles (one per dragonfly larvae) at least one hour before the beginning of the

241

recording sessions. This procedure allowed us to have freshly produced odours, and to use them as a

242

reliable olfactory signal consisting in predatory kairomones released by predators, and tadpoles’

243

alarm cue (Hettyey et al., 2015).

244

The antipredator response was estimated by recording the amount of time (in seconds) the

245

tadpoles were active in a five minutes time span both before and after the injection of the stimulus,

246

which consisted in 1 mL of either water (blank) or alarm cue. In order to detect possible differences

247

within tadpoles from different developmental treatment in antipredator responses, the movement

248

after and before the injection were compared. We considered the activity recorded before the

249

injection of water or alarm cue, measured in a 5 min period, as the basal activity level.

250

Three weeks later, when tadpoles reached Gosner stage 28/29, we repeated the experiment

251

using the same experimental protocol as explained above and recorded the activity of 80 tadpoles (n

252

= 20, from each developmental treatment).

253
254

Statistical analysis

255
256

We applied the non-parametric test Kruskall-Wallis to investigate differences in the total length,

257

and Dunn’s test of multiple comparisons with p-values adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg

258

method to compare control with other treatments. We then compared maximum tail height in

259

tadpoles exposed to RU-PW to those raised in the control solution with a robust bootstrap version

260

of ANCOVA for trimmed means with the total length as covariate (bootstrap = 10,000, 20%

261

trimmed means) using the R package WRS2, function: ancboot (Wilcox and Mair, 2016). This test

262

compares trimmed means at different points along the covariate and finds five points where the

263

slopes are roughly the same, then it compares the trimmed means at these points and explore the

264

possible differences. Since this analysis can be performed only when comparing two groups, the

265

control group was compared to the three RU-PW treatments in three different analysis.

266

Rotational preference was analysed through two parameters often used to study

267

lateralization (Cantalupo et al., 1995). Lateralization directionality (LR index) was calculated with

268

the following formula: (clockwise swimming time – counterclockwise swimming time) / (clockwise

269

swimming time + counterclockwise swimming time) × 100. Moreover, the intensity of lateralization

270

(LA index) equals to the absolute value of LR (LA = |LR|). We compared both indexes between

271

tadpoles from different developmental treatments using a bootstrap version of one-way ANOVA for

272

trimmed means (R package: WRS, function: t1waybt), both for the first and second session

273

(bootstrap = 10,000, 20% trimmed means; Wilcox, 2011). We then compared indexes between the

274

two experimental sessions with a two-way ANOVA for trimmed means (R package: WRS2,

275

function: t2way). Post-hoc tests were executed with lincomb function (R package: WRS).

276

Regarding the antipredator response, we calculated change in activity using the following

277

formula: (movement after – movement before) / (movement before) the injection of the stimulus. In

278

order to explore the disturbance effect of the injection procedure we used a non-parametric

279

Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the tadpoles mean level of activity before and after the water

280

injection for each treatment in both experimental sessions. A two-way ANOVA for trimmed means

281

was used to compare change in activity between groups and experimental session (R package:

282

WRS2, function: t2way). For each session, we used one-way ANOVA for trimmed means to

283

explore differences among embryonic treatments for the level of activity.

284

Finally, we used a linear model (lm) to explore differences in the basal activity level and

285

included embryonic treatment, experimental session and their interaction as main predictors.

286

Planned comparisons with control group in each session were extracted from the model with

287

“emmeans” R-package and no p-value correction (Lenth, 2018).

RESULTS

290
291

Morphology

292
293

We detected significant differences between treatments regarding the measured morphological

294

parameters (Fig. 1). The total length was different between embryonic treatments (X2 = 50.0, P <

295

0.001). Tadpoles exposed to low concentrations RU-PW (0.7 and 3.1 mg a.e./L) showed a higher

296

total length than those raised in the control solution (Z = -3.01, P = 0.003; Z = -3.27, P = 0.002

297

respectively). On the contrary, tadpoles which developed in the highest concentration (7.6 mg

298

a.e./L) showed a lower total length compared to the control group (Z = 2.26, P = 0.008). Results

299

from robust bootstrap version of ANCOVA for trimmed means showed that significative

300

differences in the maximum tail height emerged only for the highest glyphosate treatment (7.6 mg

301

a.e./L) in comparison to the control group (Table 1).

303

Lateralization

304
305

In the first behavioural session, carried out at Gosner stage 25, LA index was not equal among

306

developmental treatments (F = 3.34, P = 0.024, d = 0.28; Fig. 3). The LA index was significantly

307

higher in the control group compared to tadpoles raised in the highest treatment concentration tested

308

(7.6 mg a.e./L; Ψ= 22.22, P = 0.003), however no significant difference was detected between

309

control and both 0.7 and 3.1 mg a.e/L (lower p-value: Ψ = 13.25, P = 0.07). In the second session

310

(Gosner stage 28/29), statistically significant differences among treatments were no longer observed

311

(F = 1.66, P = 0.20, d = 0.33). The global analysis for trimmed means showed a significant effect

312

for the embryonic treatment (F = 10.48, P = 0.02) and for the experimental session (F = 62.32, P =

313

0.001), but not for the interaction of the two (F = 4.76, P = 0.20; Fig. 2). In all four groups LA index

314

values decreased from the first to the second session (Fig. 2).

315

Tadpoles did not exhibit directional preference for LR index, and we did not observe

316

differences between the treatment groups in both sessions (Session 1: F = 0.46, P = 0.69, d = 0.11;

317

Session 2: F = 0.27, P = 0.83, d = 0.15).

318
319

Antipredator response

320
321

In both sessions (Gosner stages 25 and 28/29), the level of activity before and after the injection of

322

water stimulus was not significantly different for all treatments (highest difference: W = 210, P =

323

0.11; Fig. 3a and 3c), thus showing a negligible disturbance effect of the injection procedure. The

324

sole exception was represented by 3.1 mg a.e./L treatment in the second session, which significantly

325

reduced activity level after the water stimulus injection (W = 21, P = 0.02; Fig. 3c). Concerning the

326

antipredator response, we did not detect any significant difference in tadpoles’ activity change

327

among embryonic treatments after the injection of the stimulus (either water or predatory cue; P =

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

328

0.75; Fig. 3b and 3d). Nevertheless, chemical stimulus and experimental session seemed to have a

329

significant effect for the proportional change in the level of activity (value= 1087.24, P < 0.001 and

330

value=5.36, P = 0.02, respectively). All groups showed a strong significant decrease in the level of

331

activity after the injection of predatory cue in comparison to water injection (Session 1: F = 979.22,

332

P < 0.001; Session 2: F = 1721.90, P < 0.001). No significant interaction was detected between

333

embryonic treatment and the type of stimulus injected (Session 1: F = 1.45, P = 0.70; Session 2: F =

334

2.43, P = 0.53).

335
336

Basal activity

337
338

The global linear model highlighted a significant interaction between embryonic treatment and

339

experimental session (F = 3.23, P = 0.02; Fig. 4). In the first session (Gosner stage 25) we observed

340

that basal activity, measured in a 5 min time span, was significantly higher in tadpoles raised in the

341

control solution than in those exposed to the herbicide (F = 5.62, P = 0.001). In the first session, the

342

intermediate RU-PW concentration groups (0.7 and 3.1 mg a.e./L) showed a significant reduction in

343

the basal activity compared to the control (t.ratio = -2.54, P = 0.01 and t.ratio = -2.04, P = 0.04,

344

respectively). Tadpoles exposed to the highest concentration of the herbicide (7.6 mg a.e./L)

345

exhibited the strongest reduction in the basal level of activity (t.ratio = - 4.23, P < 0.001) when

346

matched to the control group. In the second session (Gosner stage 28/29), tadpoles raised with RU-

347

PW were overall more active than the control group but no significant difference was detected

348

(highest difference: t.ratio = -1.79, P= 0.07).

DISCUSSION

351
352

Our study clearly supports the hypothesis that GBHs in freshwater habitat could affect the life cycle

353

of marsh frog’s tadpoles in terms of development, lateralization and activity level, all factors closely

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

354

related to the ability of the larvae to cope with environmental pressures. As a general consideration,

355

the absence of mortality rate in the different groups tested (both control and exposed) indicates a

356

good quality of the experimental conditions and confirms the sub-lethal concentrations of GBHs.

357

Similarly, no mortality has been observed in experiments using tadpoles exposed to ecologically

358

relevant concentrations of several herbicides (Dornelles and Oliveira, 2014; Wilkens et al., 2019).

359
360

Effects of RU-PW on morphological traits

361
362

Analysis of the morphological parameters revealed that growth of marsh frog tadpoles was affected

363

by ecologically relevant glyphosate concentrations after the 96h laboratory exposure. Tadpoles

364

exposed to low and intermediate concentrations seemed longer than control, pointing to a growth

365

hastening in a low pollution levels scenario, while those exposed to the highest concentration

366

appeared significantly shorter. This result could be interpreted as a growth retardation in highly

367

polluted environments. This hormetic trend in tadpoles’ development has already been observed for

368

different pesticides and heavy metals (James and Little, 2003; Smith et al., 2004; Nations et al.,

369

2011, 2015).

370

In the first scenario, we can assume that the environmental stressor represented by the

371

pollutant bursts tadpole’s development in terms of adaptive stress response, increasing length,

372

which would eventually favour movement away from the unsuitable – polluted – medium. On the

373

other hand, an indirect effect of low GBHs water contamination could consist in a faster

374

development and an early metamorphosis at smaller size, with obvious negative outcomes in terms

375

of higher predation risk and possible lower reproductive success in later-life stages (Altwegg and

376

Reyer, 2003; Cauble and Wagner, 2005).

377

RU-PW caused a general growth retardation for tadpoles raised in 7.6 mg a.e./L, for both

378

total length and maximum tail height, thus producing shorter individuals with thinner tails (Fig. 5).

379

This could be due to the energetic cost of detoxification, reducing the amount of available energy

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

380

for growing and metamorphosis. Wilkens and colleagues (2019) recently demonstrated an effect of

381

two xenobiotics (sulfentrazone and glyphosate) and their blend on metabolic rates, oxidative stress

382

and plasma corticosterone circulating level in tadpoles of the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeiana. The

383

authors conclude that tolerance to herbicide is associated with an increase in the energy demand to

384

keep the homeostasis and ensure the animal’s survival. A significant reduction in the embryo total

385

length, a sensitive parameter of the teratogenesis assay in Xenopus (FETAX), was also observed in

386

Xenopus embryos starting from the RU-PW concentration of 5mg a.e./L (Bonfanti et al., 2018).

387

Growth retardation may impair tadpoles’ ability to swim efficiently at hatching and

388

therefore negatively influence their chances to cope with potential predation threats. Although in

389

our study growth retardation was only detected at 7.6 mg a.e./L, which is the worst-case scenario

390

concentration predicted in shallow water bodies, similar effects were found in mesocosm

391

experiments at lower concentrations (Relyea, 2005). Nonetheless, in previous studies there seems to

392

be differences in the effects on development and survivability of tadpoles exposed to GBHs, with

393

lower impacts generally observed in mesocosms experiments even when testing POEA containing

394

herbicides, the most toxic surfactant for amphibians (Mikó et al., 2015).

395
396

Lateralization impairment at early developmental stages

397
398

Among the behavioural traits investigated in this study, the intensity of lateralization seemed to be

399

affected by exposure to glyphosate, as significant higher values were observed for the control group

400

when compared to the experimental group raised in 7.6 mg a.e./L RU-PW. At Gosner stage 25, we

401

discovered that lateralization index (LA) was lower in exposed tadpoles compared to those raised in

402

the control solution. Laterality is linked to anti-predatory behaviour and, therefore, an alteration

403

caused by environmental factors could lead to a decreased efficacy of defensive responses and

404

higher larvae mortality rates.

405

To date, no study has investigated how glyphosate exposure during development might

406

affect lateralization in early vs later life stages of amphibians’ tadpoles. As Roundup® seems to

407

activate the physiological pathway of developmental plasticity linked to anti-predator responses in

408

tadpoles of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica), the leopard frog (L. pipiens) and the agile frog

409

(Rana dalmatina) (Relyea, 2012; Mikó et al., 2017), and given that a higher predation risk

410

environment during early ontogeny has been proven to lead to a higher LA index in tadpoles in later

411

life stages (Lucon-Xiccato et al., 2017), a higher LA index in tadpoles treated with RU-PW during

412

early ontogeny could have been a plausible developmental plastic response. Nonetheless, this was

413

not the case in our experiment. RU-PW did not seem to induce behavioural and morphological

414

adaptations linked to antipredator responses. Indeed, tadpoles raised in 7.6 mg a.e./L had a smaller

415

tail membrane than those raised in the control solution, rather than a deeper tail membrane which is

416

a typical morphological anti-predator change (Van Buskirk, 2001).

417

In the second session, when tadpoles reached Gosner stage 28/29, no significant differences

418

between groups were detected although laterality was lower in all four groups with respect to the

419

first session (Gosner 25; Fig. 2). So, it seems that the effects of RU-PW were only detectable

420

shortly after hatching, and our results support the hypothesis that behavioural changes may be

421

influenced by the developmental stages in which it falls (Mikò et al., 2017). To our knowledge, no

422

study has yet explored how lateralization varies during tadpoles’ development and how it can be

423

affected by environmental factors during ontogeny. If we consider the modification of the LA index

424

in the control group through development, as the natural occurring variation of the intensity of

425

lateralization, we could hypothesize that lateralization index is higher just after hatching and then

426

decreases at later life stages. A higher LA index at earlier life stages could help tadpoles to cope

427

with the higher early predation threats (Dadda et al., 2010), however it seems that experience is

428

required in order to develop a certain level of behavioural lateralization (Lucon-Xiccato et al.,

429

2017).

431

RU-PW and antipredator response

432
433

The capacity of larval anurans to detect water borne cues produced by predators and properly alter

434

their behaviour (e.g. hiding or reducing activity) is crucial for survival: tadpoles of many frog

435

species are known to reduce level of activity after being exposed to predatory cues, in particular

436

when chemicals are produced by a familiar predator preying upon conspecific prey (Moore et al.,

437

2015). In our study, we did not detect any effect of the exposure during development regarding

438

antipredator response both in the first and second trial sessions. This means that tadpoles raised in

439

RU-PW solution had the ability to detect predatory and conspecific cues in a way that apparently

440

resembles the ability of individuals raised in the control solution. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out

441

that given the high concentration of predator and conspecific cue, any possible alternative responses

442

of the distinct treatments could have been concealed by the triggering of a general strong decrease

443

in the tadpole activity level. Another possibility is that the larvae of P. ridibundus are able to cope

444

with the negative effect of the herbicide toxicity in ecological relevant concentrations, and

445

particularly do not suffer shortcomings of the exposure at the sensory and nervous level. However,

446

the observed differences in lateralization and basal activity (see section Lateralization impairment

447

at early developmental stages) seem to support the first scenario (i.e. excess of stimulus).

448
449

Lower basal activity in exposed tadpoles

450
451

The dramatic decrease in basal activity observed in tadpoles exposed to RU-PW, compared to those

452

raised in the control solution in the first experimental session, may have consequences in the

453

survivability and ability to forage of tadpoles. Indeed, foraging is crucial for survival and tadpoles

454

need to efficiently balance the risk of starving and the risk of predation by adjusting their activity

455

levels (Werner and Anholt, 1996). In case of general lower basal activity, tadpoles may be impaired

456

in the foraging activity, which translates in less energy acquisition and growth and prolonged

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

457

exposure to predators and water pollutants. This may result in a positive feedback cycle: higher

458

Roundup® levels during development decreases basal activity, which may decrease foraging

459

activity and result in lower growth rates that ultimately lead to prolonged time of exposure to water

460

pollutants.

461

Bridges (1999) noted that tadpoles of Hyla versicolor exposed to carbaryl had significantly

462

lower activity levels, even when no predator were present, than tadpoles not exposed to the

463

herbicide. The consequence is a longer time spent in environments with less food availability since

464

spending too much time resting may lower predation risk, but at the same time decreases energy

465

acquisition.

466

In shallow ephemeral ponds, glyphosate concentrations are generally higher due to being located

467

near Roundup® application and due to lack of use restrictions since they are not considered water

468

bodies (Battaglin et al., 2009). In these environments, the reduced growth rate caused by the

469

herbicide may increase the risk of not achieving metamorphosis before the water dries out (Bridges,

470

1999). Furthermore, as water stratification does not occur in shallow water bodies, a phenomenon

471

which causes glyphosate and surfactants to concentrate near the surface, the risk of exposure

472

increases even more for the offspring of amphibians that breed in ephemeral ponds (Jones et al.,

473

2010).

474

At Gosner stage 28/29, we observed a reduction in the basal activity of tadpoles from the

475

control group, but no significant variation was observed among all the treatments. Despite this

476

significant drop in activity for the control group, tadpoles raised in 7.6 mg a.e./L still showed

477

similar activity levels to the control group in the second session. One possible explanation for the

478

observed shift in the basal activity of tadpoles exposed to RU-PW is that the exposed tadpoles may

479

have increased their activity to compensate the initial negative effect of the herbicide.

480

Alternatively, the control group may have decreased its basal activity to optimize their growth and

481

to storage the required amount of energy for further metamorphosis.

CONCLUSIONS

484
485

Amphibians are experiencing a decline on a global scale, mainly due to human activity (Carey and

486

Bryant, 1995; Stuart et al., 2008). One of the main factors considered to negatively impact

487

amphibians’ conservation is the environmental pollution through pesticides employment, which are

488

often directly applied to the soil and may contaminate the aquatic environment through leaching,

489

wind or transported by runoff waters (Collins and Storfer, 2003; Saunders and Pezeshki, 2015).

490

Our study demonstrates that tadpoles of P. ridibundus are sensitive to a glyphosate-based

491

herbicide in terms of both morphological and behavioural modifications. Tadpoles exposed

492

developed faster at low concentrations (0.7 and 3.1 mg a.e./L), while were affected by overall

493

growth retardation at the highest concentration tested (7.6 mg a.e./L). Lateralization and basal

494

activity were affected by embryonic exposure to glyphosate, however we could not detect any effect

495

on antipredator behavioural responses. Some of the observed modifications may be attributed to

496

altered or reduced brain development, or to the inflammation and consequent infiltration of

497

eosinophilic granule cells/mast cells in neuronal bodies, as demonstrated by previous laboratory

498

tests involving both non-model or model organisms (Ramírez-Duarte et al., 2008; Bonfanti et al.,

499

2018). Although our study reports the results of acute exposure to glyphosate, it can be assumed

500

that, after prolonged exposure, the observed behavioural alterations would only worsen, making

501

tadpoles less responsive to stressful synergetic situations such as habitat fragmentation, UV

502

radiation, pollutants, pathogenic agents, invasive species, and predators. All these factors, among

503

others, would contribute to the decrease of populations of this and other similar species.

504

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing variation in lateralization in

505

tadpoles of the genus Pelophylax, which comprise nearly 20 taxa spread throughout Europe and

506

Asia. Noteworthy, P. ridibundus has been widely translocated among European countries, and it is

507

known to hybridize with local taxa with unknown ecological consequences. In Northern Italy,

508

where this species has undergone multiple release, hybridization with P. lessonae (the pool frog)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/847251; this version posted November 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

509

and particularly P. esculentus (the edible frog, which carries the genome of the latter two species as

510

a result of hybridogenetic mechanisms; Berger, 1973), may eventually impact the species-specific

511

response of native species to environmental pressures like predation in polluted environments. P.

512

ridibundus is overall less sensitive to disturbance than the native taxa, particularly P. lessonae,

513

therefore it can be assumed that observed effects of herbicide would be more evident in less tolerant

514

tadpoles.

515

Nonetheless, the latter statement needs to be supported by further studies, in order to clarify if

516

marsh frogs may be further advantaged on native taxa via pollutant resistance.

517

Finally, since aquatic environments are essential to both the life cycle of amphibians and

518

their reproductive success, in this study we supported the hypothesis that water contamination may

519

greatly impair the survivability of amphibian populations.

Table 1: Results from Robust ANCOVA analysis (20% trimmed means, bootstrap = 10.000). The design points are total length (covariate) values

766

(µm) for which the relationship between total length and maximum tail height are comparable in the compared groups. N1 and N2 are the number of

767

individuals that have a covariate value close to the design points. The difference column shows the difference in the trimmed means for the

768

maximum tail height between the two groups and the test statistic values are stored in the F column (difference/S.E.) with the corresponding p-

769

values in the P column. 95% confidence intervals are in the LCI95% (lower) and UCI95% (upper).
