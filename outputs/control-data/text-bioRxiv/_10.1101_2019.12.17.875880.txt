Abstract

22

Structural covariance networks are able to identify functionally organized brain regions by gray matter

23

volume covariance. In Parkinson’s disease, the posterior cingulate network and anterior cingulate

24

network showed decreased gray matter and therefore we examined the underlying molecular processes

25

of these anatomical networks in the healthy brain. Whole brain transcriptomics from post-mortem

26

samples from healthy adults, revealed upregulation of genes associated with serotonin, GPCR, GABA,

27

glutamate, and RAS signaling pathways in these PD-related regions. Our results also suggest involvement

28

of the cholinergic circuit, in which genes

29

Furthermore, both networks were associated with memory and neuropsychiatric disorders that overlap

30

with Parkinson’s disease symptoms. The identified genes and pathways contribute to healthy functions

31

of the posterior and anterior cingulate networks and disruptions to these functions may in turn

32

contribute to the pathological and clinical events observed in Parkinson’s disease.

NPPA, SOSTDC1,

and

TYRP1

may play a protective role.

Introduction

37

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder pathologically defined by the loss of

38

dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies in selective brain regions

39

(Goedert et al. 2012). Clinical symptoms involve impairment of diverse motor and non-motor symptoms

40

that get progressively worse over time. The decline in clinical performance has been associated with

41

changes in morphological properties of structural and functional neuroimaging networks (Lucas-Jiménez

42

et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016; de Schipper et al. 2017). In turn, studies have investigated the relationship

43

between these imaging networks and genetic variants in PD-related genes to provide new insights into

44

the pathogenesis of PD (van der Vegt et al. 2009). However, less is known about the functional pathways

45

that underlie the spatial organization of brain regions contributing to PD. To identify the molecular

46

mechanisms underlying changes in structural and functional networks in PD, imaging data has been

47

integrated with brain wide expression atlases of the healthy brain (Hawrylycz et al. 2015; Arnatkevic̆iūtė

48

et al. 2019). Regional brain atrophy in PD patients was found to be correlated with the expression of

49

genes implicated in trans-synaptic alpha-synuclein transfer (Freeze et al. 2018) and a loss of regional

50

connectivity in PD patients was correlated with the regional expression of

51

(Rittman et al. 2016). These studies show that combining imaging data in PD and gene expression from

52

the healthy brain can shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed differences

53

between PD and controls.

54

Structural covariance networks (SCNs) can reveal functional network organizations by identifying brain

55

regions that co-vary in gray matter volume across a population (Alexander-Bloch, Giedd, et al. 2013).

56

SCNs have been shown to be dysregulated in different neurological disorders (Alexander-Bloch,

57

Raznahan, et al. 2013; Spreng and Turner 2013; Coppen et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019),

58

and variations in SCNs can be explained by transcriptomic similarity and structural connectivity (Romero-

59

Garcia et al. 2018; Yee et al. 2018). Hafkemeijer

MAPT in the healthy brain

et al. (Hafkemeijer et al. 2014) identified nine SCNs

60

based on gray matter variation among healthy middle-aged to older adults. Gray matter volume in four

61

of these nine networks was negatively associated with age: a subcortical network, sensorimotor

62

network, posterior cingulate networks, and anterior cingulate network. Two of these networks were

63

found to show loss of gray matter volume in PD patients beyond the effects of aging: the posterior

64

cingulate network and anterior cingulate network (de Schipper et al. 2017). These two networks were

65

negatively associated with cognitive impairment and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Yet, it is unclear

66

which molecular mechanisms contribute to these differences in SCNs in individuals with PD.

67

In this study, we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms within the healthy brain underlying the loss

68

of integrity and atrophy in the anterior and posterior cingulate networks in PD patients. By integrating

69

the nine SCNs with spatial gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we investigate

70

whether expression patterns in the normal healthy brain are associated with patterns of gray matter

71

loss in PD. We show that genes highly expressed in the posterior and anterior cingulate networks were

72

associated with multiple neurotransmitter signaling pathways and involved in memory-related, pain-

73

related, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, both anatomical networks showed high expression

74

of cholinergic gene markers known to act as regulators of extracellular signaling. Our results provide

75

new insights into the molecular processes underlying anatomical network function and aids in

76

understanding the selective progression of PD.

Transcriptomic data preprocessing

79

To understand transcriptomic signatures of nine anatomical networks of the healthy brain, we used

80

normalized gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a post-mortem microarray

81

data set of 3,702 anatomical brain regions from six healthy individuals (5 males and 1 female, mean age

82

42, range 24–57 years) (Hawrylycz et al. 2015). We downloaded the data from http://human.brain-

83

map.org/. To filter and map probes to genes, the data was concatenated across the six donors. We

84

removed 10,521 probes with missing Entrez IDs, and 6,068 probes with low presence as they were

85

expressed above background in <1% of samples (PA-call containing presence/absence flag) (Hawrylycz et

86

al. 2015). The remaining 44,072 probes were mapped to 20,017 genes with unique Entrez IDs using the

87

collapseRows-function in R-package WGCNA v1.64.1 (Langfelder and Horvath 2008) as follows: i) if there

88

is one probe, that one probe is chosen, ii) if there are two probes, the one with maximum variance

89

across all samples is chosen (method=”maxRowVariance”), iii) if there are more than two probes, the

90

probe with the highest connectivity (summed adjacency) is chosen (connectivityBasedCollapsing=TRUE).

91

For visualization of gene expression in heatmaps, data was Z-score normalized across all samples for

92

each brain donor separately. Heatmaps were plotted using R-package ComplexHeatmap v2.0.0 (Gu et al.

93

2016). Genes were clustered using complete linkage with Euclidean distances. The same color scale was

94

used for all heatmaps.

95

Mapping AHBA samples to SCNs of the healthy brain

96

We focused on anatomical networks that were previously defined based on whole brain gray matter

97

volume covariation in 370 middle-aged to older adults between 45 and 85 years; for more detailed

98

information on the networks see Hafkemeijer et al. 2014. Nine networks were defined and named

99

according to the presence of the main structures: thalamus (network A), lateral occipital cortex (network

100

B), posterior cingulate cortex (network C), anterior cingulate cortex (network D), temporal pole (network

101

E), putamen (network F), and cerebellum (networks G, H, and I). The same networks were previously

102

investigated for loss of integrity in 159 PD patients from the same age range, where the posterior

103

cingulate network (C) and anterior cingulate network (D) showed decreased gray matter; for

104

demographic and clinical information see de Schipper et al. 2017. All samples from each one of the six

105

donors in AHBA were mapped to regions defined by the nine SCNs in MNI coordinate space. The

106

mapping divided all the samples into two sets depending on their position inside (1) or outside (0) the

107

SCN mask.

108

Differential expression analysis

109

Differential expression analysis was performed between each of the two PD-related networks (posterior

110

and anterior cingulate cortex) and the other 7 non-PD-related networks together. A two-tailed t-test

111

was used for each gene and the analysis was done separately for each donor from AHBA. Since the

112

microarray data was log2-transformed, the mean expression difference is interpreted as the log2-

113

transformed fold-change (FC). The effect sizes for each one of the six donors were combined by meta-

114

analysis (metafor R-package 2.0). For the meta-analysis, a random effects model was applied which

115

assumes that each brain is considered to be from a larger population of brains and therefore takes the

116

within-brain and between-brain variance into account. The between-brain variance (tau2) was estimated

117

with the Dersimonian-Delaird model. Variances and confidence intervals were obtained using the escalc-

118

function. The significance of summary effect sizes was assessed through a two-sided t-test (H0: FC=0;

119

unequal variances). P-values of the effect sizes were Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrected for all 20,017

120

genes.

(http://neuroexpresso.org/) using markers from all brain regions. These have been identified in a cross-

129

laboratory dataset of cell-type specific transcriptomes from the mouse brain (Mancarci et al. 2017). To

130

assess their expression, Entrez IDs of the mouse cell-type specific markers were converted to human

131

homologs (homologene R-package version 1.4) and filtered for genes present in the AHBA dataset

132

(Supplementary Table 1). Two markers with different mouse gene IDs (14972,

133

15006, H2-Q1 serotonergic), were converted to the same human gene ID (3105, HLA-A), and therefore

134

removed before analysis. For cell-type enrichment, we assessed which cell-type markers were

135

overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. For 17 cell-types that had at least six

136

markers (astrocyte, Bergmann, cerebellar granule, dentate granule, ependymal, GabaReln,

137

hypocretinergic, microglia, activated microglia, deactivated microglia, noradrenergic, oligo, purkinje,

138

serotonergic, spinal cord cholinergic, spiny, and thalamus cholinergic), we assessed the significance with

139

the hypergeometric test and P-values were corrected for all 17 cell-types (BH-corrected P < 0.05).

140

Enrichment of disease-associated genes

141

Differentially expressed genes were also assessed for overrepresentation of disease-associated genes

142

from DisGeNET (Piñero et al. 2017). A table of 628,685 gene-disease associations were obtained from

143

DisGeNET version 6.0 (July, 2019) from http://www.disgenet.org/. A hypergeometric test was used to

144

assess the significance of overlapping genes (P < 0.05), and P-values were BH-corrected for 24,166

Results

148

Transcriptomics of the posterior and anterior cingulate networks

149

We analyzed the transcriptomes of healthy subjects across nine anatomical networks defined by

150

structural covariance of gray matter volume among healthy middle-aged to older adults (Hafkemeijer et

151

al. 2014). We focused on the posterior cingulate network and the anterior cingulate network that

152

showed loss of gray matter in PD patients which seemed to be associated with cognition and excessive

153

daytime sleepiness (Figure 1) (de Schipper et al. 2017). For this we used the AHBA microarray dataset of

154

spatial gene expression in post-mortem brains. AHBA samples were mapped to each one of the nine

155

networks A-I (Table 1). We characterized the transcriptional signature of the two PD-related networks

156

(Network C and Network D) in these AHBA samples by comparing their gene expression pattern to the

157

remaining seven networks together (non-PD-related).

158

Genes were differentially expressed within the posterior cingulate network or the anterior cingulate

159

network compared to the other networks combined when absolute fold-change (FC) > 1 and Benjamini-

160

Hochberg (BH) corrected P-value < 0.05. Differential expression analysis showed a large overlap of genes

161

that were differentially expressed in the same direction in the two networks. We found that 73 genes in

162

the posterior cingulate network and 39 genes in anterior cingulate network were downregulated, of

163

which 25 genes overlapped between both networks (Figure 2A and B, Supplementary Table 2 and 3).

164

Furthermore, 200 genes in the posterior cingulate network and 269 genes in anterior cingulate network

165

were upregulated, for which 144 genes overlapped (Supplementary Table 4 and 5). Among the

166

differentially expressed genes in the posterior and anterior cingulate networks, we further assessed the

167

presence of PD-implicated genes identified in familial and genome-wide association studies (Bonifati

168

2014; Nalls et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2017). Although mutations in these genes may impact disease

169

outcome, none of these genes were differentially expressed in the posterior cingulate network and

170

anterior cingulate network.

171

For functional interpretation, differentially upregulated genes were further assessed for enrichment of

172

genes involved in pathways (Supplementary Table 6). As both networks shared many differentially

173

expressed genes, they also shared similar pathways involved in transcriptional regulation by

174

GPCR signaling, voltage gated potassium channels, and neurotransmitter receptor and postsynaptic

175

signal transmission (Figure 2C). The associated pathways were hierarchically related to each other based

176

on the ontology of the Reactome Pathway Database. The posterior cingulate network was additionally

177

related to more specific pathways such as lysosphingolipid and LPA receptors, GABA receptor activation,

178

RAS-signaling mediated by NMDA receptors, glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and

179

synaptic plasticity, and long-term potentiation. The anterior cingulate cortex was additionally associated

180

with serotonin receptors.

181

Cell-type enrichment in anatomical networks

182

The composition of specific cell-types can shape the transcriptomic features of anatomical networks.

183

Therefore, we analyzed whether genes differentially expressed in the posterior and anterior cingulate

184

networks were enriched for cell-type specific marker genes. Based on the average expression of marker

185

genes of a cell-type, the posterior and anterior cingulate networks showed high expression of gene

186

markers for brainstem cholinergic cells, GabaSSTReln, GabaVIPReln, glutamatergic, and pyramidal cells

187

(Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1).

188

Among the differentially upregulated genes in the posterior and anterior cingulate networks, we found

189

10 marker genes representing six cell-types: astrocyte, Bergmann, GabaVIPReln, hypocretinergic,

190

pyramidal, and thalamus cholinergic (

191

Table 2). Those that were significantly upregulated in the posterior cingulate network were also

192

significantly upregulated in the anterior cingulate network. In both networks, the 10 markers were

193

highly expressed in cortical regions, including the cingulate gyrus, and lowly expressed in limbic regions

194

(Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 2).

195

Only genes upregulated in the anterior cingulate gyrus were significantly enriched for a cell-type, namely

196

thalamus cholinergic cells (OR = 17.12 and P = 2.01e-02). The responsible markers NPPA, SOSTDC1, and

197

TYRP1 showed high expression within the anterior cingulate gyrus network, as well as in most parts of

198

the posterior cingulate gyrus network (Figure 4). Additionally, we showed that their expression was low

199

in limbic samples, including the thalamus, and high in cortical samples within both networks.

200

Interestingly, other thalamus cholinergic marker genes showed opposite expression patterns with high

201

expression in limbic samples and low expression in cortical samples (Supplementary Figure 3).

202

PD-related networks are transcriptionally associated to other brain diseases

203

Dysregulation of functional networks may result in a broader spectrum of disorders than PD. In addition,

204

PD comprises a spectrum of disorders that may result from network dysfunction. Therefore, we

205

assessed which disease-associated genes from DisGeNET were overrepresented among the differentially

206

upregulated genes in the posterior cingulate network as well as the anterior cingulate network. Since

207

both networks shared many upregulated genes, similar disease-associations were also found. We find

208

that genes upregulated in both networks were significantly associated with epileptic and non-epileptic

209

seizures, many mental disorders (bipolar, panic, autistic, cocaine-related, (age-related) memory, mood,

210

major depressive, and anxiety disorder), pain and schizophrenia (Figure 5). The posterior cingulate

211

network was more related to memory and pain-related disorders, while the anterior cingulate network

212

was more related to mental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

213

Discussion

214

The posterior and anterior cingulate networks have been associated earlier with decreased gray matter

215

in PD patients. We examined transcriptomic signatures of both networks in the healthy brain to identify

216

molecular mechanisms underlying gray matter loss in PD. Pathway analysis revealed genes related to

217

gPCR signaling, transcriptional regulation by

218

signal transmission. We only found significant enrichment of cell-types for genes upregulated in the

219

anterior cingulate gyrus, which were the thalamus cholinergic marker genes. Upon further examination

220

the specific genes were also highly expressed in the posterior cingulate cortex, although not

221

significantly. Moreover, our results showed that SCNs involved in the pathology of PD are associated

222

with multiple neurotransmitter signaling pathways, e.g. serotonin, GPCR, GABA, glutamate, and RAS.

223

Cholinergic function in PD

224

Genes that were highly expressed in the anterior cingulate network were significantly enriched for

225

thalamus cholinergic markers, specifically:

226

with other markers of this cell-type, were defined based on their expression in cholinergic cells from the

227

thalamus, more specifically the hubenula (Mancarci et al. 2017). Although these genes are considered

228

thalamus-specific, according to the AHBA ontology the hubenula is not part of the thalamus. In this

229

study, most thalamus cholinergic marker genes indeed showed high expression in thalamic regions.

230

However,

231

expression in cortical regions and low expression in limbic regions, including the thalamus. Cholinergic

232

circuits are key in cognitive functions which are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases, such as

233

Alzheimer’s disease and PD (Ballinger et al. 2016). In addition, cholinergic denervation of the cortex and

234

thalamus In PD patients may contribute to the transition from PD to PD with dementia (Ballinger et al.

2016). We also found that glutamatergic and GABAergic marker genes were highly expressed in the

236

AHBA samples within the posterior and anterior cingulate networks, although statistical significance

237

could not be assessed due to the small number of marker genes. Interestingly, acetylcholine release by

238

cholinergic neurons affects glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling by altering the synaptic excitability

239

(Granger et al. 2015; Buendia et al. 2019). Moreover, it is thought that dysfunction of cholinergic circuits

240

contributes to cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Ballinger et al. 2016).

241

NPPA, SOSTDC1, and TYRP1

242

The cholinergic marker genes

243

in the posterior cingulate network and anterior cingulate network compared to the other seven SCNs.

244

While the functions of these genes likely involve cholinergic signaling, several studies suggest they also

245

function as extracellular regulators of multiple other signaling pathways, including cAMP, Wnt, and β-

246

catenin signaling (Brenner et al. 1990; Hirobe 2011; Kutchko and Siltberg-Liberles 2013; De Vito 2014;

247

Bansho et al. 2017; Millan et al. 2019).

248

NPPA (natriuretic peptide precursor A) and other natriuretic peptides are thought to be involved in a

249

wide range of functions, including neurovascular functions, blood-brain barrier, brain homeostasis,

250

neuroprotection, and synaptic transmission by regulating the release and re-uptake of

251

neurotransmitters such as noradrenalin, dopamine and glycine (Mahinrad et al. 2016). Impaired function

252

of natriuretic peptides in brains of AD patients could accelerate neurodegeneration and may impair

253

structural integrity of the brain leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline (Mahinrad et al. 2018). Our

results suggest that NPPA might similarly be involved in PD pathogenesis given its high expression within

the anterior and posterior cingulate networks.

258

maturation and cytotoxicity (Millan et al. 2019). An increased number of natural killer cells have been

259

found in PD, but the actual relevance with PD risk is still unclear (Jiang et al. 2017). The BMP signaling

260

pathway promotes the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Jovanovic et al. 2018), in which

261

SOSTDC1 may play a role. Furthermore, SOSTDC1 was upregulated in the striatum of Parkinsonian rats

262

that were treated by subthalamic nucleus high frequency stimulation, and is therefore suggested to

263

have neuroprotective effects (Lortet et al. 2013).

264

TYRP1 (tyrosinase-related protein 1) produces melanocytes-specific proteins involved in the biosynthesis

265

of melanin in brain, skin and eyes (Wang and Hebert 2006; Lu et al. 2011). Melanoma and PD share

266

genes involved in the synthesis of melanin and dopamine, including

267

synuclein protein found in Lewy bodies (Pan et al. 2012). Furthermore, neuromelanin is produced

268

almost exclusively in human catecholaminergic neurons and is responsible for the pigmentation of

269

dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and noradrenergic neurons of the locus cereleus (Pavan

270

and Dalpiaz 2017). It is considered to be protective due to its ability to chelate metals, especially iron

271

which increases with age (Pavan and Dalpiaz 2017).

272

Disease-associations

273

The posterior and anterior cingulate networks shared similar highly expressed genes and were likewise

274

associated with similar diseases. Both SCNs represent anatomical networks that function normally in

275

healthy brains, but their activity is reduced in aging and PD (Hafkemeijer et al. 2014; de Schipper et al.

276

2017). As part of the default mode network, both the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex have been

277

shown to be dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders (Broyd et al. 2009; Öngür et al. 2010). Based on

278

our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in the healthy brain, we found that the posterior cingulate

279

network showed stronger associations with memory and pain-related disorders compared to the

280

anterior cingulate networks which showed stronger associations with mental and neuropsychiatric

SNCA

which encodes the α-

disorders. Our findings suggest that genes involved in multiple signaling pathways, such as serotonin,

282

GPCR, GABA, glutamate, and RAS, contribute to healthy functions of the posterior and anterior cingulate

283

networks.

matter loss in PD (PD-related), while the seven remaining networks were not related to PD (non-PD-related). We compared

436

gene expression in each of the two PD-related networks to gene expression in all seven non-PD-related networks. Genes that

437

were upregulated in the two PD-related networks were assessed for the overrepresentation of pathway-specific genes, cell-

was more specifically associated with serotonin receptors (purple). See Supplementary Table 6 for gene counts and BH-
