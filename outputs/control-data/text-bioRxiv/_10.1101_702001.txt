Abstract
This study dissected the complexity of the immune architecture of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) at high resolution and assessed its influence on therapeutic response. Using 387
primary bone marrow samples from three discovery cohorts of children and adults with AML,
we defined immune-infiltrated and immune-depleted disease subtypes and unraveled critical
differences in immune gene expression across age groups and disease stages. Importantly,
interferon (IFN)-γ-related mRNA profiles were predictive for both chemotherapy resistance
and response of primary refractory/relapsed AML to flotetuzumab immunotherapy. Our
compendium of microenvironmental gene and protein profiles sheds novel insights into the
immuno-biology of AML and will inform the delivery of personalized immunotherapies to IFNγ-dominant AML subtypes.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous hematological
malignancy1. The discovery of the genomic landscape of AML, including the identification of
targetable mutations2, has propelled the development of novel anti-leukemic agents and is
enabling disease classification and patient stratification into favorable, intermediate or
adverse risk groups3. Despite success in many areas, AML is cured in only 35-40% of
patients <60 years of age and in 5-15% of patients >60 years of age. While chemotherapy
resistance is common, the majority of patients die of disease relapse. Investigation of new
molecularly-targeted and immuno-modulatory agents therefore remains a high priority for
both children and adults4.
Tumor phenotypes are dictated not only by the neoplastic cell component, but also by the
immunologic milieu within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is equipped to subvert
host immune responses and hamper effector T-cell function5. In silico approaches have
been instrumental for the identification of immunogenomic features with therapeutic and
prognostic implications. In solid tumors, six immune subtypes have been described (wound
healing, interferon (IFN)-γ-dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte-depleted, immunologically
quiet, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-dominant). These are characterized by
differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, T helper type (Th)-1 to Th2 cell ratio,
extent of intratumoral heterogeneity and neoantigen load, aneuploidy, cell proliferation,
expression of immunomodulatory genes, and patient survival6.
Although immunotherapy may be an attractive modality to exploit in patients with AML7, the
ability to predict the groups of patients and the forms of leukemia that will respond to
immune targeting remains limited8-11. Clinical studies in patients with solid tumors have
shown that responses to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1
(PD-L1)-targeted immunotherapy occur most often in individuals with immune-inflamed
lesions that are characterized by pre-existing CD8+ T-cell responses, release of proinflammatory and effector cytokines12-14, and an augmented T-cell receptor (TCR) clonal
diversity pre-treatment15,16. The above T-cell inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) is a

Herein, we used targeted immune gene expression profiling (IGEP) and spatially-resolved
multiplexed digital spatial profiling (DSP) for the high-dimensional analysis of the
immunological contexture of a broad collection of bone marrow (BM) samples from patients
with AML and for the identification of molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic benefit.
We reveal unifying immune features and critical differences that define classes and
subclasses of TMEs and deliver predictions of chemotherapy resistance, survival and
immunotherapy response that are beyond the current capabilities of single molecular
markers.

Results
Targeted immune gene expression profiling (IGEP) identifies immune subtypes of
AML.
We first analyzed unfractionated, archival BM samples from treatment-naïve patients with
non-promyelocytic AML (PMCC discovery series; n=290 cases; Table 1)21. We derived
immune scores from mRNA expression levels, similar to those of previous publications, and
devised an RNA-based, quantitative metric of immune infiltration22,23. As shown in Extended
Data Fig. 1A-B, patients with adverse cytogenetic features exhibited a shorter relapse-free
survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with patients with intermediate and
favorable cytogenetic risk, thus confirming the overall trends of well-established European
Leukemia-Net (ELN) categories24. A Pearson correlation matrix of immune gene sets
allowed us to identify co-expression patterns of pre-defined immune cell types and immune
biological activities. Immune signature modules in pre-treatment BM samples reflected the
co-expression of genes associated with 1) IFN-γ biology, 2) adaptive immune responses,
and 3) myeloid cell abundance (macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs); Fig.
1A). We then computed the sum of the individual scores in each signature module in Fig. 1A
and generated three immune scores (IFN-dominant, adaptive and myeloid) which
individually separated AML cases according to high and low expression values (Extended
Data Fig. 1C). When considered in aggregate, IFN-dominant, adaptive and myeloid scores
dichotomized BM samples into two immune subtypes, which will be herein termed immuneinfiltrated and immune-depleted (Fig. 1B)25. These immune subtypes of AML expressed
comparable levels of leukemia-associated antigens CD34, CD123 (IL3RA) and CD117 (KIT),
suggesting that targeted IGEP of bulk BM specimens largely captured elements of the
immunological TME rather than features of the tumor cell compartment (Extended Data Fig.
1D).
As shown in Fig. 1C, AML cases with immune-infiltrated profiles expressed significantly
higher levels of IFN-stimulated genes and T-cell recruiting factors (STAT1, CXCL10, IRF1),

T-cell markers and cytolytic effectors (CD8A, CD8B, GZMB, PRF1), counter-regulatory
immune checkpoints and immunotherapy drug targets (IDO1, CTLA4, PD-L1 and BTLA),
and molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation (TAP1, TAP2, HLA-A, HLAB and HLA-C). Conceivably, high T-cell infiltration, MHC expression and PD-L1 levels in the
immune-infiltrated AML subtype reflected a pre-existing IFN-γ-driven adaptive immune
response which has previously been associated with suppressed anti-tumor immune
reactivity13,26, but also with immunotherapy responses in patients with solid tumors9,18,27 and
AML11. The expression of STAT1, a central component of the IFN-γ signaling pathway and
predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade28, was more strongly correlated with
the presence of T-cell inhibitory receptors TNFRSF14 (a ligand for the immunoglobulin
superfamily members BTLA and CD160), PD-L1, HAVCR2 (Tim-3) and LAG-3, and with
IFN-stimulated genes MX1, IFIT1 and IRF1 in the immune-infiltrated relative to the immunedepleted subtype, consistent with their coordinated regulation in an inflamed TME (Fig. 1D).
Finally, PD-L1, IFN-γ signaling, IFN downstream signaling and immunoproteasome mRNA
scores in the IFN-dominant gene module, but not adaptive and myeloid gene modules (data
not shown), individually separated patients into subgroups with different survival probabilities
(Extended Data Fig. 1E).

Highly multiplexed digital spatial profiling (DSP) unravels distinct T-cell neighbors in
immune-infiltrated and immune-depleted AML. Transcriptomic data do not provide
information on spatial relationships of tumor-infiltrating immune cells within the TME.
Therefore, we used GeoMx® DSP to characterize the expression of 31 immuno-oncology
(IO) proteins in 10 fresh frozen paraffin embedded (FFPE) BM biopsies from treatment-naïve
patients with AML (SAL patient series) with varying degrees of T-cell infiltration (Extended
Data Fig. 2A). We selected 24 geometric regions of interest (ROIs) per BM sample using
fluorescent anti-CD3 (visualization marker for T cell-rich ROIs) and anti-CD123 antibodies
(visualization marker for myeloid blast-rich ROIs)29 (Extended Data Fig. 3-4). T-cell gene

expression scores (calculated as detailed in Extended Data Fig. 2B) correlated with DSP
CD3 protein status (Fig. 2A and Extended Data Fig. 2C). Furthermore, mRNA and protein
levels for B cells, monocytes and Bcl-2 significantly and positively correlated, serving as a
validation for the mRNA-based immune scores (Extended Data Fig. 2D).
We then asked whether CD3-rich and CD3-poor BM samples (defined by a median split of
barcode counts) differed in terms of co-localization patterns of relevant IO proteins. As
shown in Extended Data Fig. 2A, CD3+ T cells in immune-infiltrated biopsies co-localized
with B cells, antigen processing and presentation-related proteins (β2-microglobulin),
negative immune checkpoint B7-H3 and β-catenin. In contrast, CD3+ T cells in immunedepleted biopsies co-localized with markers of immunological memory (CD45RO) and T-cell
exhaustion (PD-1). When analyzing overall protein expression patterns (10 samples × 24
ROIs per sample × 31 proteins = 7,440 data points), we identified four protein signatures
(SIG), which were then further assessed in silico for correlations with clinical-biological
disease characteristics and potential prognostic value in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)AML cases (162 sequenced AML samples with putative copy-number alterations, mutations
and mRNA expression z-scores [threshold±2.0]). Abnormalities in SIG1, SIG2 and SIG4
genes (blue boxes in Fig. 2B) did not correlate with specific disease characteristics or
clinical outcomes (data not shown). In contrast, mRNA up-regulation, gene amplification,
deep deletion and mis-sense mutations in SIG3 genes, which were detected in 26% of
TCGA-AML cases (Fig. 2C), significantly correlated with TP53 mutation status, an
established adverse prognosticator in AML (p value from mutation enrichment analysis =
0.0285). Alterations in SIG3 genes, which included PD-L1, FoxP3, molecules associated
with cell cytotoxicity, PTEN and BCL2, were predominantly observed in patients with
immune-infiltrated mRNA profiles (Fig. 2D) and also correlated with higher number of
mutations (median=12 and 9 in AML cases with [n=41] or without [n=115] abnormalities in
SIG3 genes, respectively; p=0.021) and with adverse ELN cytogenetic features (χ2=25.03;
p<0.001), but not with other disease characteristics at presentation, including white blood

cell (WBC) count, and percentage of AML blasts in pre-treatment blood and BM samples
(data not shown). Finally, patients with abnormalities in SIG3 genes experienced poor
clinical outcomes, as shown by the significantly lower RFS and OS rates (Fig. 2E).
Collectively, highly multiplexed in situ detection of IO proteins highlights critical differences in
T-cell infiltrated versus T-cell depleted AML subtypes and identifies protein signatures with
prognostic potential in T-cell infiltrated pre-treatment samples.

Interactions between immune subgroups, common cytogenetic alterations and
clinical factors. We next correlated immune signature scores with clinical and demographic
factors, including WBC count and blast cell count at diagnosis, ELN cytogenetic category
(available in 249 cases from the PMCC discovery series) and patient age. Leukemia burden
was significantly lower in the immune-infiltrated AML subtype (median WBC count at
diagnosis=10.0×103/μL, range 1.0-188.0, versus 25.8×103/μL, range 0.7-398.3, p<0.0001;
median percentage of BM blasts=50% versus 80%, p<0.0001, and median number of AML
blasts per μL of blood=3.7 versus 10.71, p<0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 5A-C). Although
immune signature scores were not correlated with the ELN cytogenetic risk category when
considered individually (data not shown), we observed a trend towards more AML cases
with ELN adverse cytogenetics in the immune-infiltrated subtype (32% versus 20%, p=0.021;
χ2 test for trend; Extended Data Fig. 5D). Finally, patients with high immune infiltration
tended to be of a more advanced age at diagnosis (median=58 years, range 23-79)
compared with patients with low immune infiltration (median=50 years, range 18-63,
p<0.0001; Extended Data Fig. 5E).

Immune subtypes improve survival prediction. The activation of immune pathways has
context-dependent prognostic impact that differs between tumor types6. We first assessed
the ability of the immune subtype to refine the accuracy of outcome prediction separately for
each ELN cytogenetic risk category. Among patients with favorable risk, RFS and OS times

were significantly longer in individuals with an immune-infiltrated TME (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
clinical outcomes in ELN adverse risk cases were worse in individuals with an immuneinfiltrated TME. We also observed that the ELN classifier assisted outcome prediction only in
the immune-infiltrated subtype (Fig. 3B), allowing the identification of patient subgroups with
excellent survival estimates (87.5% RFS and 77.8% OS) or with very unsatisfactory
outcomes [10.4% RFS (log-rank χ2=15.07; p<0.0001) and 7.2% OS (log-rank χ2=25.75;
p<0.0001); Fig. 3B]. This finding is congruent with previous studies showing that specific
gene expression profiles correlate with longer OS in patients with favorable-risk AML, but not
in those with intermediate-risk or high-risk AML30. Similarly, leukemia stem cell-associated
gene signatures have been shown to provide prognostic separation within specific ELN risk
categories31.
Unexpectedly, our immunological classifier was unable to stratify survival in patients with
intermediate ELN risk (Fig. 3A). We therefore employed an immune gene signature-agnostic
approach to identify gene sets with prognostic impact in this specific patient category. By
performing Cox proportional hazards regression, we discovered a set of 21 differentially
expressed (DE) immune genes [false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05] between favorable and
adverse-risk AML (Supplemental Table 1), which were significantly associated with OS and
exhibited enrichment of gene ontologies (GO) and pathways related to T-cell activation, TCR
downstream signaling and regulation of cytokine production (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, patients
with intermediate-risk AML could be separated into subgroups with low and high gene
expression values, with the former being closely similar to ELN favorable-risk patients while
the latter resembled ELN adverse-risk patients (Fig. 3D). Importantly, RFS and OS
estimates were significantly poorer for intermediate-risk patients with high versus low
expression levels of the 21 DE genes (Fig. 3E).

Immune landscapes stratify AML patients in independent validation sets and differ
across age groups and disease stages. AML is a disease with age-dependent biological
specificities32,33. Furthermore, pediatric AML are inherently of low immunogenicity and are

therefore less likely to respond to single-agent checkpoint inhibition34. To characterize the
immunological landscape of AML across age groups and longitudinally in patients who
initially achieve complete remission (CR) and then experience disease recurrence, we
profiled BM samples from a pediatric (CHOP series, n=39 cases) and an adult AML cohort
(SAL series, n=38 cases, 58 BM specimens in total). In line with findings in the PMCC
discovery series, we identified IFN-dominant, adaptive and myeloid mRNA profiles
(Extended Data Fig. 6A-D) which individually separated AML cases according to high and
low expression values and, when considered in aggregate, dichotomized AML cases into an
immune-infiltrated and immune-depleted subtype (Extended Data Fig. 6E). As summarized
in Extended Data Fig. 7A, comparison between children and adults with AML revealed a
set of DE immune genes (FDR<4.53×10-9) involved with cytokine and chemokine signaling,
as indicated by GO (Extended Data Fig. 8A and Supplemental Table 2) and protein
interaction network analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8B). Specifically, genes encoding proinflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokines, including IL8, CCL3L1, CCL3 and CXCL3,
were expressed at significantly higher levels in adult AML relative to childhood AML
(Extended Data Fig. 7B). When comparing matched BM samples from adult patients (SAL
series) at the time of diagnosis and achievement of CR after induction chemotherapy
(Extended Data Fig. 7C), we identified a set of DE genes (FDR<5.72×10-4) that were
enriched for GO biological processes related to the innate immune response, cytokine
signaling and toll-like receptor (TLR) cascade (Supplemental Table 3). As shown in
Extended Data Fig. 7C, FLT3, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), IFN regulatory factor 3
(IRF3) and BMI1, which have been implicated in leukemia stem cell self-renewal and
inhibition of apoptosis, were expressed at significantly lower levels in AML cases in CR,
serving as a data reliability check. Finally, immune genes significantly associated with
relapsed AML (SAL series) largely captured CD8+ T-cell infiltration, elements of T-cell
biology, including T-cell receptor (TCR) downstream signaling (CD3z [CD247], CD3E),
leukocyte differentiation and immune regulation (Extended Data Fig. 7D and Supplemental
Table 4). The increased expression of surrogate markers of terminal T-cell differentiation,

senescence and exhaustion [TBX21 (T-bet)35,36, TIGIT and CTLA4] in relapsed AML
suggests that BM-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells may fail to restrain leukemia growth (Extended
Data Fig. 8C). The DE genes between patient subgroups with newly diagnosed, CR and
relapsed AML in the SAL cohort, and between childhood and adult cases, were largely nonoverlapping, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7E.
IFN-related gene sets improve the prediction of therapy resistance. We then asked
whether the IFN-dominant gene module herein computed as the sum of IFN-γ signaling, IFN
downstream, immunoproteasome, myeloid inflammation, inflammatory chemokine, IL-10,
MAGE, PD-L1 and PD-L2 scores (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1C) may assist the
prediction of therapeutic resistance, which we empirically defined as failure to achieve CR in
patients who survived at least 28 days (primary refractory AML) or as early relapse (<3
months) after achieving CR, as previously published by others37. When AML patients in the
PMCC cohort were dichotomized based on higher or lower than median IFN scores, a higher
percentage of patients with primary refractory disease was observed in the IFN-scorehigh
AML cases (65.4% versus 34.6%; p=0.0022, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that
transcriptional programs orchestrated by microenvironmental IFN-γ might render AML blasts
resistant to chemotherapeutic agents20,38. In contrast, the frequency of primary refractory
cases was not different when comparing AML patients with higher or lower than median
adaptive module scores (29.6% versus 25.4%; p=NS) and myeloid module scores (26.7%
versus 28.1%; p=NS). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the IFN-related module
scores significantly improved the ability of the ELN category to predict therapeutic resistance
(Fig. 4A-B; AUROC = 0.815 versus 0.702 with ELN risk only; model χ2=65.87 versus 33.43;
increased sensitivity compared to ENL risk only=15.6%; increased specificity=3%;
decreased false positive rate=11.5%; decreased false negative rate=4.9%), but not patient
survival (data not shown). Specifically, the myeloid inflammation score (p=0.003), IFN-γ
signaling score (p=0.014) and IFN downstream score (p=0.034) significantly contributed to
the model (Supplemental Table 5). Gene sets defining gene modules 2 and 3 in Fig. 1,

reflective of adaptive immune responses and BM infiltration with cells of the myeloid lineage,
respectively, were not associated with either therapeutic resistance or patient survival (data
not shown).

In silico validation of therapy prediction by immune subtypes in the Beat AML and
HOVON cohorts. We next tested the predictive and prognostic power of immune scores in
silico using a broad collection of public transcriptomic data. We initially devised binary
logistic regression models utilizing RNA-sequencing data from 196 patients on the Beat AML
Master Trial® with clinical response information39. When considering disease type (primary
versus secondary), WBC count and patient age at diagnosis, the inclusion of genes
capturing IFN-γ-related biology significantly improved the predictive ability of the ELN risk
category (AUROC=0.921 versus 0.709 with ELN cytogenetic risk alone; model χ2=106.4
versus 29.6; increased specificity=4%; increased sensitivity=17%; decreased false positive
rate=39%; decreased false negative rate=18%; Fig. 4C).
Confirming our findings in the PMCC and Beat AML® cohorts, IFN-dominant, adaptive and
myeloid mRNA profiles, when used in aggregate, stratified patients in the HOVON database
(618 non-promyelocytic AML cases40) into subgroups with high and low immune infiltration
(Fig. 4D-E). Individuals with immune-infiltrated AML had lower leukemia burden (median
percentage of BM blasts=56% versus 71% in patients with immune-depleted AML;
p<0.0001) and tended to have more advanced age at diagnosis (median=51 years, range
15-74, versus 46 years, range 15-77; p=0.0067). A higher percentage of patients with IFNdominant AML failed to achieve CR in response to induction chemotherapy when compared
to non-IFN-dominant AML cases (27.2% versus 15.2%; p=0.0004, Fisher’s exact test). In
contrast, the occurrence of induction failure (IF) was not different when patients were
dichotomized based on higher or lower than median adaptive module scores (21.4% versus
21.0% IF rate; p=NS) or myeloid module scores (21.7% versus 20.7% IF rate; p=NS). Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with all transcripts in the HOVON dataset provided as input

and ranked by the log2 fold-change between non-responders and responders confirmed the
over-expression of curated hallmark gene sets linked to IFN-γ responses and inflammatory
responses in chemotherapy-refractory patients (Fig. 4F; Supplemental Table 6). When
tested in a multinomial logistic regression model incorporating patient age, leukemia burden
and ELN cytogenetic risk (available in 615 HOVON cases)41, immune gene sets defining the
IFN-dominant module significantly and independently predicted whether patients responded
to induction chemotherapy and whether they experienced disease relapse (Supplemental
Table 7). In contrast, immune gene signatures were unable to assist the prediction of nonleukemic deaths (Supplemental Table 7).

Mutations in tumor suppressor genes and transcription factors are enriched in
immune-infiltrated AML cases. It has recently been shown that genetic drivers of solid
malignancies dictate neutrophil and T-cell recruitment, thus affecting the immune milieu of
the tumor and assisting patient stratification42. We asked whether clonal driver mutations
may correlate with the immune subtypes that we identified herein. We therefore retrieved
TCGA AML RNA-sequencing data from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) and
computed immune cell type-specific and biological activity scores22. The mutational
spectrum of TCGA- AML cases, including co-occurrence and exclusivity of the most frequent
molecular lesions, is shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. Mis-sense mutations, mRNA upregulation, deep deletion and amplification in IFN downstream genes are summarized in
Extended Data Fig. 10. Patients with adverse-risk molecular lesions, including somatic
TP53 mutations and RUNX1 mutations, clustered in the immune-infiltrated subgroup
(Extended Data Fig. 10A). In particular, IFN-related gene sets, including the tumor
inflammation signature (TIS) score, were expressed at significantly higher levels in TCGAAML cases with TP53 and RUNX1 mutations relative to molecular lesions that confer
favorable or intermediate risk (Extended Data Fig. 11A-B). In contrast, the majority of
TCGA-AML cases with NPM1 mutations with or without FLT3-ITD (intermediate-risk and
favorable-risk cases, respectively) were classified as immune-depleted. When extending our

in-silico analysis to the Beat AML® cohort (281 cases in total), 16 out of 17 (94%) TP53mutated AMLs expressed higher levels of genes implicated in downstream IFN signaling and
higher levels of CD8 transcripts and markers of cytotoxicity compared with TP53 wild-type
cases (Extended Data Fig. 11C-D).

IFN-γ-related gene expression profiles correlate with anti-leukemia responses after
flotetuzumab immunotherapy. Finally, we hypothesized that higher expression of IFN-γrelated genes in immune-infiltrated AML cases, while underpinning chemotherapy
resistance, might identify patients with AML who derive benefit from immunotherapy with
flotetuzumab (FLZ; formerly MGD006)43, a CD3×CD123 DART®. Preliminary anti-leukemic
activity of FLZ at a target dose of ≥500ng/kg/day has been recently reported44,45. BM
samples collected prior to FLZ treatment from 30 adult patients with chemotherapyrefractory or relapsed AML enrolled in the CP-MGD006-01 clinical trial (NCT#02152956)
were profiled using the PanCancer IO360™ gene expression assay. Patients’ characteristics
are summarized in Supplemental Table 8. BM samples from 92% of patients with evidence
of FLZ anti-leukemic activity (11 out of 12), which was defined as either CR, CR with partial
hematologic recovery (CRh), CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), partial
response or overall benefit (>30% reduction in BM and/or blood blasts), had an immuneinfiltrated TME relative to non-responders (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the IFN-dominant module
score was significantly higher in patients with chemotherapy-refractory AML compared with
relapsed AML at time of FLZ treatment, and in individuals with evidence of anti-leukemic
activity compared to non-responders (Fig. 5B). Notably, the TIS score was a stronger
predictor of anti-leukemic responses to FLZ, with an AUROC value of 0.847 (Fig. 5B). Ontreatment BM samples (available in 19 patients at the end of cycle 1) displayed increased
antigen presentation and immune activation relative to baseline samples, as reflected by
higher TIS scores (6.47±0.22 versus 5.93±0.15, p=0.0006), antigen processing machinery
scores (5.67±0.16 versus 5.31±0.12, p=0.002), IFN-γ signaling scores (3.58±0.27 versus

Discussion
Using large cohorts of subjects, the current study is the first to reveal underlying
transcriptomic features that stratify the TME of AML into immune subtypes and may assist
therapeutic predictions by defining patients who will potentially derive the greatest benefit
from immunotherapies11,46. We identified two subtypes of differentially-infiltrated tumors, an
observation that was validated in independent childhood and adult AML series, reinforcing
the notion that unique molecular features can distinguish AML across age groups33. In
agreement with commonly accepted criteria that AUROCs of 0.8-0.9 indicate good predictive
ability, the IFN-related gene sets identified in our study improved the prediction of
therapeutic

resistance

following

conventional

and

anthracycline

chemotherapy beyond that provided by the ELN cytogenetic risk category (AUC=0.815 in
PMCC cases [discovery series] and 0.870 in Beat AML® cases [in silico validation series])47.
In recent Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) and MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical
trials, pretreatment covariates such as cytogenetic risk and age only yielded AUROCs of
0.65 and 0.59 for therapeutic resistance, respectively37. Our models incorporating IFNrelated mRNA profiles also outperform a recently developed 29-gene and cytogenetic risk
predictor of chemotherapy resistance (AUROC=0.76)48. Intriguingly, an IFN-related DNA
damage resistance signature (IRDS) correlates with resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy
and with recurrence after radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer38, suggesting that
tumor cells over-expressing IRDS genes, including STAT1, ISG15 and IFIT1, as a result of
chronic activation of the IFN signaling pathway might receive pro-survival rather than
cytotoxic signals in response to DNA damage49.
The immune-infiltrated AML cases in the PMCC cohort were highly immune-suppressed, as
indicated by elevated expression of IFN-inducible negative immune checkpoints and
immunotherapy targets IDO1 and PD-L1. Furthermore, adults with relapsed AML in the SAL
series expressed higher levels of T-cell exhaustion molecules relative to matched pretreatment samples, suggesting the occurrence of escape from immune surveillance at the

time of disease relapse50. In general, solid tumors with a substantial T-cell component and
displaying a type I immune response are associated with better OS and progression-free
survival estimates6. However, the highly proliferative IFN-γ-dominant solid tumors may
correlate with a less favorable survival, despite being infiltrated with CD8+ T cells and
harboring the highest type 1 macrophage signature scores6. By utilizing targeted IGEP, our
study highlights that the activation of IFN-related pathways and the relative abundance of
immune cell types, including the over-expression of T-cell markers and TCR signaling
intermediates in relapsed AML relative to disease onset, have negative prognostic
implications in AML; this is conceivably the result of a non-productive anti-leukemia immune
response and/or IFN-driven resistance to DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic
agents20.
The heterogeneity of immune infiltration can also be determined by tumor cell-intrinsic
factors, including chemokine secretion51 and expression of cancer driver genes, all of which
affect response to immunotherapies42,52,53. Interestingly, we detected associations between
mutations in tumor suppressor and cancer driver genes and immune subtypes of AML and,
for the first time, we identified TP53 mutations as being strongly correlated with an IFN-γ
dominant TME and with prognostic protein signatures, including the expression of PD-L1,
FOXP3, cytotoxicity markers and PTEN, that were revealed by spatially-resolved, highly
multiplexed protein profiling. This observation is backed by a recent study showing higher
proportions of PD-L1-expressing CD8+ T cells, activation of IFN-γ-associated genes and
favorable responses to pembrolizumab immunotherapy in TP53-mutated lung cancers54. It is
tempting to speculate that immune-infiltrated, TP53-mutated AML cases, which have very
low response rates when treated with standard anthracycline-based and cytarabine-based

relapsed/refractory AML on clinical trial CP-MGD006-01. FLZ treatment was associated with
increased expression of antigen processing machinery genes, enhanced IFN-γ signaling and
heightened PD-L1 expression. The latter finding provides a biological rationale for designing
clinical studies with sequential FLZ and checkpoint inhibitor blockade in AML patients in
remission with minimal residual disease. In conclusion, our work unveils the heterogeneity of
the immune landscape of AML and provides a novel precision medicine-based conceptual
framework for delivering T cell-targeting immunotherapy to subgroups of patients with IFN-γdominant AML, who may be refractory to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy but
responsive to T-cell engagers. The immunological stratification of pre-treatment BM samples
may therefore enable rapid risk prediction and selection of frontline therapeutic modalities11,
in conjunction with cytogenetic and mutational information.

clinical data.

Online Methods
Patients’ demographics (discovery cohorts). Patient and disease characteristics are
detailed in Table 1. Primary patient specimens (non-promyelocytic AML) and associated
clinical data were obtained on research protocols approved by the Investigational Review
Boards of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), USA and Princess Margaret
Cancer Centre (PMCC), Canada and by the Ethics Committee of TU Dresden and
Studienallianz Leukämie (SAL), Germany.

Patients’ demographics (immunotherapy cohort). Thirty patients with primary refractory
(n=23) and relapsed AML (n=7) treated with flotetuzumab (FLZ) at the recommended phase
2 dose (500 ng/kg/day) on the CP-MGD006-01 clinical trial (NCT#02152956) were included
in this study. Patient and disease characteristics are detailed in Supplemental Table 8. BM
aspirates were collected at baseline (n=30) and after cycle 1 of FLZ (n=19) to evaluate the
temporal immunological effects associated with therapeutic response. Patients received a
lead-in dose of FLZ during week (W) 1, followed by 500 ng/kg/day during weeks 2-4 of cycle
1, and a 4-day on/3-day off schedule for cycle 2 and beyond. Disease status was assessed
by modified IWG criteria.

RNA isolation and processing.
Messenger RNA was isolated and processed as previously described41. For the PMCC, SAL
and CHOP patient cohorts, approximately 100 ng per sample of RNA extracted from 387
bulk BM aspirates from AML patients treated with curative intent were analyzed on the
nCounter™ FLEX analysis system using the PanCancer Immune [PCI] profiling panel (for
research use only and not for use in diagnostic procedures), which measures mRNA levels
of 740 genes representing 24 immune cell types, common checkpoint inhibitors, cancer
testis antigens and genes covering both the innate and adaptive immune response
(Extended Data Fig. 2B)25,56,57. BM samples from patients receiving FLZ immunotherapy
were analyzed using the PanCancer IO360™ mRNA panel (for research use only and not
for use in diagnostic procedures).

The reporter probe counts, i.e., the number of times the color-coded barcode for that gene is
detected, were tabulated in a comma separated value (CSV) format for data analysis with
the nSolver™ software package (version 4.0.62) and nSolver Advanced Analysis module
(version 2.0.115; NanoString Technologies). The captured transcript counts were normalized
to the geometric mean of the housekeeping reference genes included in the assay and the
code set’s internal positive controls.
The relative abundance of immune cell types and immuno-oncology biological signatures
were computed as previously published22,23. For samples run on the PCI profiling panel, we
also calculated an approximation of the Tumor Inflammation Signature (TIS) using 16 of the
18 functional genes and 5 of the 10 housekeeper genes that are present in the PCI profiling
panel18.

Gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Metascape.org was
used to enrich genes for GO biological processes and pathways. GSEA was performed
using the GSEA software v.3.0 (Broad Institute, Cambridge, USA)58. Hallmark IFN-γ
response and inflammatory response gene sets (M5913) were downloaded from the
Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)22,23.

GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). Ten FFPE BM biopsies from patients with newly
diagnosed AML (SAL series) were profiled using the GeoMx DSP platform. Samples were
stained using 3 fluorescent visualization markers, CD3 (T cell), CD123 (myeloid blast),
SYTO™ 83 (nuclei), and 31 UV-cleavable oligo-labeled antibodies (Supplemental Table 9).
Stained slides were loaded on the DSP instrument and digitally scanned. Fluorescent scans
were used to select 24 geometric regions of interest (ROIs)27,59. The DSP instrument then
UV-illuminated selected ROIs to release conjugated oligos and the micro-capillary fluidics
system collected released oligos, which were counted on the nCounter system.

Data sources for in silico analyses. The first data series (E-MTAB-3444), hereafter
referred to as the HOVON series40, was retrieved from Array Express and encompassed
three independent cohorts of adults (≤60 years) with de novo AML. BM and blood samples
were collected at diagnosis and were analyzed on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 Microarray40,60. Patients were treated with curative intent according to the Dutch-Belgian
Hematology-Oncology Cooperative Group and the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer
Research (HOVON/SAKK) AML-04, -04A, -29, -32, -42, -42A, -43 or -92 protocols (available
at http://www.hovon.nl). Clinical annotations were provided by the authors. The second data
series, hereafter referred to as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) series, consisted of RNAsequencing data (Illumina HiSeq2000) from 162 adult AML patients with complete

1980861. RNA and clinical data were retrieved from the TCGA data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDownload.jsp). The third data series (Beat AML) was retrieved
using the VIZOME user interface (http://www.vizome.org/aml/) and consisted of RNAsequencing data from primary specimens from 242 AML patients with detailed clinical
annotations, including diagnostic information, treatments, responses and outcomes treated
on the Beat AML Master Trial39. Patient and disease characteristics for in silico data sources
are summarized in Supplemental Table 10.

Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics included calculation of mean, median, SD, and
proportions to summarize study outcomes. Comparisons were performed with the MannWhitney U test for paired or unpaired data (two-sided), as appropriate, or with the ANOVA
with correction for multiple comparisons. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24) and GraphPad
Prism (version 8) were used for statistical analyses. A two-tailed p value <0.05 was
considered to reflect statistically significant differences. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was
used to compare survival distributions.
Therapeutic resistance was defined as failure to achieve complete remission (CR) despite
not experiencing early treatment-related mortality (within 28 days of chemotherapy initiation;
primary refractory cases) or as early relapse (<3 months) after achieving CR37. Overall
survival (OS) was computed from the date of diagnosis to the date of death. Relapse-FreeSurvival (RFS) was measured from the date of first CR to the date of relapse or death.
Subjects lost to follow-up were censored at their date of last known contact.
Binary logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to ascertain the
relative contribution of immune subtypes and other pretreatment covariates selected a priori
based on known clinical relevance (ELN risk group, FLT3-ITD status, NPM1 mutational
status, patient age at diagnosis and primary versus secondary AML) toward the predicted
likelihood of response to induction chemotherapy, AML relapse and patient death41.
Variables measured after the initiation of induction chemotherapy were excluded, since the
goal of the current study was to identify AML patients at higher risk of treatment failure prior
to starting therapy.

relapsed/refractory AML (n=30) receiving flotetuzumab (FLZ) immunotherapy in the CPMGD006-01 clinical trial (NCT#02152956). Anti-leukemic response was defined as either
complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), CR with partial
hematologic recovery (CRh), partial remission (PR) or “other benefit” (OB; >30% decrease in
BM blasts). Non-responders were individuals with either treatment failure (TF), stable
disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Chemotherapy refractoriness was defined as ≥2
induction attempts or 1st CR with initial CR duration <6 months. B) IFN module score and
TIS score in baseline BM samples from patients with primary refractory and relapsed AML.
