Abstract

Background
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has shown to have promising

results in a pilot study with patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A recent study in aged

monkeys shows a novel intermittent stimulation pattern to have superior cognitive benefits over

continuous paradigms.

human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1ΔE9) genes, each independent causes

of early-onset familial AD.

Introduction

Continuous deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been shown to

be safe and exert pro-cognitive effects in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (1–5). The

stimulation is likely to drive the dense population of cholinergic neurons of the NBM, functionally

associated with control of attention and maintenance of arousal, both key functions for learning and

memory formation (6–11). Studies in aged rhesus monkeys show intermittent NBM stimulation to

induce supranormal working memory and sustained attention (12,13), suggesting that the current

pattern of stimulation used in the clinic may not be optimal (14). Accordingly, in the present study,

we

comparing

the

benefits

and

NBM

stimulation in an animal model for AD (TgF344-AD rat line; TG), i.e. rats expressing mutant human

amyloid

precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin

1

(PS1ΔE9) genes,

both causal to

early-onset

familial AD in humans (15,16). This exploratory study aims at testing the potential of intermittent

stimulation for patients suffering from AD in a diseased stage. Therefore, transgenic rats matching

the age of clinical diagnosis will be stimulated with various stimulation parameters and performances

compared to pre-surgery baseline (17).

Materials and Methods

Animals
Twelve 18-month old TG male rats were housed in a normal day-night cycle with ad libitum access to

water and food.

Experimental schedule lasted for three months, with each animal undergoing the

same stimulation paradigm at the same time. Based on the data available on this rat line, the age

that model the most time during which a patient is most like to be diagnosed with AD is between 16-

20 months (17–19). This study was performed in accordance with German regulations and legal

requirements and was approved by the local government authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt

und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen (LANUV NRW), North Rhine–Westphalia, Germany).

Surgery and postoperative care
Rats were injected with Carprofen (5,0mg/kg) and Buprenophrin (0,05mg/kg) 60 minutes presurgery.

Rats

were

anaesthetised

by

gaseous

isoflurane

before

bilateral

implantation

of

the

stimulating

electrodes into the NBM (coordinates in mm from bregma: AP= -1,44; ML= +/-2,88; DV= 7,4(16).

Electrodes were implanted at a 6° angle and 4 micro screws were used to stabilize the implant.

Carprofen (5,0mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 days post-surgery. Rats recovered for at least a

week before the first stimulation.

Stimulation Paradigms
Animals were stimulated intermittently (uni- or bilaterally) or continuously (bilaterally only) using

bipolar platinum-iridium stimulating electrodes (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA). Positive monopolar

pulses

were

generated

by

a

Master-8

stimulator

paired

to

-Flex

stimulus

isolators

(A.M.P.I.,

Jerusalem, Israel). The pulse width was set at 100µs, the intensity at 200µA and the frequency at

60Hz

for

intermittent

stimulation,

and

20Hz

for

continuous

stimulation.

The

duty

cycle

of

intermittent stimulation pattern was 20 seconds ON and 40 seconds OFF.

Behavioral Testing
Twelve animals were tested in an open field test (OF), a novel object recognition task (NOR), and a

modified Barnes maze task (MBM) (5 days; 3 training/ 2 probe trials), pre- and post-implantation.

Behavioral testing was performed between 8 AM and 2 PM. Animals were brought into the testing

room 30 minutes beforehand. Lighting was set at 80 lumen. Mazes were cleaned before and after

each trial with 10% white vinegar solution. The order in which animals were tested was randomized

daily. Post-implantation, rats were stimulated during testing. One animal fell off the maze during

MBM training. The implant was damaged, and the animal was removed from the study.

Modified Barnes Maze Task
In this spatial memory test, rats were to escape a stressful environment (bright light) into an escape

box. The maze consisted of a circular dark-grey platform (120 cm diameter) with 20 holes evenly

consistent throughout the trial (15). Rats were trained twice per day for three days, then tested one

and five days later (probe trials). The

time to reach the escape box and the number of errors,

explorations of holes other than the escape hole, was recorded.

Open Field Test
The arena used consisted of a 60 cm high - 100 cm square box. Rats were placed into the centre of

the maze and were allowed to explore the arena for 10 minutes. Total distance moved, and total

amount of time spent in centre vs border zones was measured.

Novel Object Recognition Task/Test
In the same arena, 2 identical objects were placed 25cm off the walls. Animals were placed in the

maze facing away from objects and allowed to explore for 3 minutes. Afterwards, rats were returned

to their home cage for 20 minutes. Object sets were permuted with a novel object and a clean

familiar object. Rats were returned to the maze to explore for 3 minutes. Total amount of time spent

exploring each object was measured for both trials, as well as discrimination scores (d1, d2)(18).

Statistical Analysis
Data were compared with a Wilcoxon signed-ranked test. Individual performances of animals were

ranked

and

in

between the final day of training and the probe trials after 1 and 5 days respectively were compared.

SEM = 15; T1D: µ = 149.9, SEM = 12.14; T5D: µ = 126.9, SEM = 18.9). When stimulated intermittently

Discussion

In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that bilateral intermittent stimulation of the NBM leads

to

superior

cognitive

benefits in

aged

TG rats when

compared

to continuous

stimulation.

Data

indicate that locomotion was increased during unilateral, as well as bilateral intermittent stimulation,

suggested

by

distance

covered

in

an

open

field,

when

compared

to

presurgery.

Continuous

stimulation did not lead to an increased distance covered when compared to presurgery. Moreover,

anxiety levels in the OF were unaffected by stimulation patterns when compared to presurgery. NOR

data indicate a low overall exploration of the objects indicated by e1 and e2 scores. Novel object

recognition memory was not achieved at any condition.

Data suggest that spatial memory can be improved with bilateral intermittent NBM-DBS. Partial

stabilization was also achieved with unilateral intermittent stimulation. Continuous stimulation did

not

lead

to

statistical

improvement

of

performance,

possibly

due

to

the

prevalent

immobility

observed during continuous stimulation.

These data are promising; additionally, limitations need to be considered. Of special note is the age

of the animals. The overall experimental schedule lasted 3 months: the sample size decreased over

time.

While

11

animals

were

available

for

bilateral

intermittent

stimulation,

4

remained

for

continuous stimulation. Two animals had to be excluded due to health issues. Five animals developed

a kindling effect upon continuous stimulation. Further research including more animals is needed to

evaluate if this is e.g. a direct effect of the stimulation pattern or a carry-over effect resulting from

prolonged stimulation.

This side effect has never been reported in patients though.

Conclusion

Bilateral

intermittent

NBM

DBS

allows

aged

TG

rats

to

perform

better

and

maintain

their

performance longer in a spatial memory task when compared to presurgery. These data support that

the NBM DBS technique can be further refined in the clinic, thereby improving patient care.
