Abstract
Lumbrokinase, extracted from the cultured earthworm of Eisenia fetida, has been widely
used as biochemical medicine in China to prevent or treat thrombosis. In the present study, the
mechanism of lumbrokinase was investigated using the fibrin plate method. The results
revealed that lumbrokinase contained both fibrinolytic and kinase components. The method of
fibrin-zymography was used to show the existence and activity of lumbrokinase, and we proved
that the fibrin-zymogram gel could be adopted as the identification method of earthworm.
Subsequently, the components were identified by mass spectrometry. According to the results,
fibrinolytic related components existed in the drug. These proteins were further compared with
other serine proteins. The result showed that the identified proteins were similar to human
trypsin and bovine trypsin. Besides, some also exhibited similar characteristics with human
plasminogen activators. The mentioned results demonstrated that lumbrokinase products
contained two major groups of protein components, suggesting two different functions.

Lumbrokinase(LK), which is ubiquitous in earthworms, has been used as traditional
medicines for thousands of years in China. It has been manufactured into enteric capsules or
enteric-coated tablets since 1990s for its inconvenience for dosing and unpleasant smell. The
most common side effect is the hypersensitivity caused by heterogonous proteins. [1-9]
In China, there are five manufacturers producing lumbrokinase drug substances and enteric
capsules. The substances are extracted from the cultured earthworm (Eisenia fetida). In general,
the extraction process of lumbrokinase consists of three major steps. First, the bodies of
earthworm are milled and centrifuged to produce the supernatant. Then, the supernatant was
purified with DEAE(diethylaminoethyl) column and then powdered though the process of
filtration, ultrafiltration and lyophilization. However, the products, due to the rough
manufacturing process, contain many different earthworm fibrinolytic enzymes and other
contaminants, which may cause side effects. Besides, though it has been used for a long time
and considered effective, there is little knowledge about which types of proteins are vital for the
drug. Thus, protein components in lumbrokinase need identification.
This study aimed to illustrate the mechanism of lumbrokinase in the production to identify
the proteins in lumbrokinase drug substances by ESI-MS(electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry) and to provide data support for the enhancement of its quality specification. In
this study, we proved that lumbrokinase had two action mechanisms and identified the proteins
existed in the lumbrokinase drug substances. Also, the fibrin-zymography technique was
recommended as the identification method of earthworms.

Sample preparation: For fibrin plate tests, the drugs from five manufacturers dissolved in
the 0.9% sodium chloride, and then they were diluted into a range of concentration
(2000U/mL,4000U/mL,6000U/mL,8000U/mL and 10000U/mL). The standard of lumbrokinase
was diluted to achieve the same concentration.
Preparation of fibrin plate: Fibrin plates were prepared using the standard method. [10]
39mL of the fibrinogen solution(1.5mg/mL, diluted with PBS buffer) was added into the
agarose solution(55℃) and mixed toughly. Subsequently, thrombin solution 3.0mL was added,
and the solution was transferred to the plastic culture plates. After evenly mixing the solution,
the solution stood still for 1 h at ambient temperature until it was solidified. The preparation of
fibrin and kinase plates was the same except that 1mLplasminogen solution (3U/mL) was added
into the plates.
For activity analysis, 10 µL test solution of different concentrations into the pole was
precisely measured, and then the plates were incubated at 37℃ for 18h. The diameter of the
hydrolyzed clear zone was measured, and the final values were an average of three replicates.

Lumbrokinase drug substances dissolved into 3mg/mL with the solution of 0.9% sodium
chloride. SDS-fibrin gel was prepared as described by Kim and Choi.[11, 12] The composition
of the gel(10%) is listed in Table 1. 10µL of the supernatant from the drug substances which
was diluted in the sample loading buffer were loaded into the fibrin gel. After running the
gel(80V 30min;120V 60min), it was soaked in the 2.5% Triton-100 solution for 30min and then
incubated in the reaction buffer solution (0.05M KH2PO4,0.04MNaOH;pH7.4) at 37℃ for 40
min. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue for 2h and then distained. The digested
bands reflecting the enzymatic activities were visualized as clear bands of fibrinolysis against a
dark-blue background of undigested fibrin substrate.

Fibrin-zymography

The fibrin plate was used to ascertain the direct fibrinolytic activity of lumbrokinase, as
shown in Fig 1a. Besides, the fibrin-plasminogen plate was used to measure the fibrinolytic and
kinase activity of lumbrokinase, as shown in Fig 1b. The results revealed that the diameter of
the fibrin-plasminogen plate was significantly larger than that of the fibrin plate (Table 2),
indicating that lumbrokinase not only exhibited the direct degradation activity of fibrin, but also
the ability of activating plasminogen to produce indirect fibrinolysis, showing a kinase activity.
The current quality specification only measured its direct fibrinolytic activity by calibration
curve and ignored the kinase activity. In our study, we observed that in the fibrin-plasminogen
plate, the tendency of diameters of hydrolyzed clear zone between the sample and the standard
was parallel, as shown in Fig 2. Furthermore, the parallel line method was employed to measure
the total activity of lumbrokinase. As shown in table 3, the total potency calculation of all the
five manufacturers ‘products were consistent with the method requirements, and three
independent tests exhibited relatively good precision, suggesting that the parallel line method
could be used to effectively measure total potency of lumbrokinase.
The zymography was used to show the existence of lumbrokinase. Gel based
zymography, combined with separation principle of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
enzyme-substrate reaction mechanism, could display the molecular weight of the active
protein on the gel, and also could show the fibrinolytic band of lumbrokinase. According to
the results of fibrin-zymography, there were six common active proteins in the products of the
five manufacturers, as shown in Fig 3a. Besides, the products of one manufacturer had one
more active protein band than others, and another one had two more bands. All the active bands
were distributed in the range of 15~40KD.This suggested that lumbrokinase in the drugs was a
group of fibrinolytic proteins. Subsequently, the consistency between different manufacturers
was further evaluated, as shown in Fig 3b. Except for the little difference between two
companies, the active ingredients and manufacturing process of all products of the five
manufacturers were highly similar.
According to the results, lumbrokinase was a mixture of fibrinolytic components and
exhibited different molecular masses in the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Then, the
species of earthworm were identified based on these results, and the method of fibrinzymography was further verified.
In the specificity test, as shown in Fig 4a, inactive lumbrokinase and urokinase could not
produce fibrinolytic lines. Defibrase from snake showed two fibrinolytic lines, whereas they
were obviously different from the lumbrokinase. The fibrinolytic lines between the Eisenia
foetida and Pheretima aspergillum were overall different, revealing that fibrin-zymography
could identify the active components containing the fibrinolytic protein and distinguishing
Eisenia foetida from other earthworm species.
In the robustness test, as shown in Fig 4b and 4c, the effects of fibrinogen concentration
and incubation time on the clarity of fibrin-zymography were explored. The results showed that
when the fibrinogen concentration ranged from 0.25to1.0mg/ml, and the incubation time ranged
from 10 to 60 min. Accordingly, the fibrinolytic bands could be easy to identify.
In the test of range of quantitation, as shown in Fig 4d, a clear figure of fibrin-zymography
could be generate when lumbrokinase concentration ranged from 0.5 to 37.5ug.
Based on the validation results, the method of fibrin-zymography satisfied the validation
requirements, and it could be used as the identification method of Eisenia foetida.

Proteins identification in lumbrokinase drug substances by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry(ESI-MS)
According to the results of fibrin plate experiments, lumbrokinase had two mechanisms of
lysing fibrin, and we confirmed the presence of fibrinolytic protein in lumbrokinase using
fibrin-zymography. Next, we identified the protein in lumbrokinase drug substances by LC-MS.
The drug substances were treated with chymotrypsin. As shown in Table 4, fifteen fibrinolytic
activity-related components were identified, and no other proteases were identified. 8-9
fibrinolytic proteins in each manufacturer were detected. Fibrinolytic protease 1, fibrinolytic
protease P-III-1and protein ARSP1 existed in all products. The results of mass spectrometry
suggested that lumbrokinase drug substances contained fibrinolytic and kinase components,
which was consistent with the results of lumbrokinase activity measurement.
Subsequently, using the sequence alignment tool, the amino acid sequence of these proteins
was compared with the known serine proteases. As shown in Fig 5,lumbrokinase shared the
common features with the human trypsin, bovine trypsin, tPA(tissue-type plasminogen like
activator) and uPA(urokinase-type plasminogen like activator)as their conserved catalytic triad,
histidine(H), aspartate(D) and serine(S) were identical. The results implied that these active
sites were highly conserved in these serine proteins, playing an important role in the activity of
proteolysis.[13] Some lumbrokinases exhibited a highly similar loop and specific pocket (AsnAsp-iLe-Ala-Leu-Leu), similar to tPA and uPA.[14-16] Besides, the amino acids, asp507, ser532
and gly534 in tPA, i.e. important substrate recognition sites for tPA and uPA, [17-19]also existed
in several lumbrokinases. These proteins probably had the same activity with tPA or uPA.[2023] The results suggested that some lumbrokinases might play a fibrinolytic activity, and the
others might be able to lyse fibrin indirectly by activating the plasminogen to plasmin in the
lumbrokinase related products.

Discussion
The fibrin-zymography confirmed the presence of active proteins in the lumbrokinase. The
results of fibrin plate revealed that lumbrokinase had dual action mechanisms, which was
further verified using the mass spectrometry. These results were consistent with the report that
the protein property of these proteases, by activating the plasminogen into plasmin, both had the
activity of degrading the fibrin directly and the activity of degrading the fibrin indirectly.[14]
However, the current fibrin plate method used in the potency determination of lumbrokinase
only measured its direct fibrinolytic activity with its kinase activity excluding. Accordingly, the
current method should be optimized to measure its total activity. Our study showed that it was
theoretically feasible to achieve the potency improvement of lumbrokinase using the parallel
method.
It was reported that lumbrokinase(LK) was a group of fibrinolytic isozymes with molecular
weights ranging from 25 to 32KD. [2, 24-26] These hydrolytic enzymes existed in different
earthworm species, including Lumbricus rubellus,[27, 28]Lumbricus bimastus[9] and Eisenia
fetida[29-31]. However, in the drug specification, identification of lumbrokinase based on the
hemolysis test could not differentiate the proteases from different species. Fibrin-zymography
based on the mechanisms of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis could provide dimensional
separations, helping to resolve the complex isozymes of lumbrokinase with relatively high
sensitivity. In this study, fibrin-zymography was first introduced to identify the species of
earthworm based on the hydrolytic bands on the gel and used to show the existence of active
protein in the drugs and to distinguish the earthworm according to the distribution of bright
bands on the gel.
Lumbrokinase was a group of serine proteins that exhibited highly similar physical and
chemical properties. The amino acid sequence of each protein was highly homologous.[32] The
contents of lysine (K) and spermine (R) were low in the protein sequence, thereby resulting in

poor digestion of trypsin. Moreover, the isoelectric point of lumbrokinase was about 3-5, close
to optimal pH of pepsin. Given this, we found the phenomena of protein precipitation in the
process of treating lumbrokinase drug substances with pepsin. Thus, chymotrypsin was selected
as the treating enzyme since the restriction sites, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan were
widely distributed in lumbrokinase.
It is noteworthy that the database of Eisenia foetida contained very few types of proteins
due to the lack of related research. Most of the proteins were fibrinolytic related. Thus, the
results of mass spectrometry revealed that the drugs contained fibrinolytic proteins, and no
other proteins were identified. Accordingly, a further study is required with the gradual update
of the database.
Since the lumbrokinase was not isolated and purified from the earthworm in our study,
which proteins showed the fibrinolytic activity, which one showed the kinase activity and which
one showed both could not be concluded. However, our study laid a foundation for the
pharmacological study of lumbrokinase. To identify each component in the enteric-coated
capsules is our future work.
