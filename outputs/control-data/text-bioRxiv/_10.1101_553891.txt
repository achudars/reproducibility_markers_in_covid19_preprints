Abstract

28
29Unenlagiinae is mostly recognized as a subclade of dromaeosaurids. They have the modified
30pedal digit II that characterize all dromeosaurids, which is typically related to predation.
31However, derived Laurasian dromaeosaurids (eudromaeosaurs) differ from unenlagiines in
32having a shorter metatarsus and pedal phalanx II-1, and more ginglymoid articular surfaces in
33metatarsals and pedal phalanges. Further, unenlagiines have a subarctometatarsal condition,
34which could have increased the mechanical efficiency during locomotion. All these
35discrepancies possibly reflect different locomotor and predatory habits. To evaluate this we
36conducted morphometric analyses and comparisons of qualitative morphological aspects. The
37former consisted in two phylogenetic principal component analyses, one of them based on
38lengths of femur, tibia and metatarsus, and width of metatarsus, and the other based on
39lengths of pedal phalanges. The data sampling covered several coelurosaurian and non40coelurosaurian taxa. The first analysis showed the unenlagiines close to taxa with long tibiae
41and long and slender metatarsi, which are features considered to provide high cursorial
42capacities. Instead, eudromaeosaurs are close to taxa with shorter tibiae and shorter and wider
43metatarsi, which can be considered with low cursorial capacities. The second analysis showed
44that eudromaeosaurs and unenlagiines have similar phalangeal proportions. Moreover, they
45share the elongation of distal phalanges, which is a feature related to the capacity of grasping.
46The shorter and wider metatarsus, more ginglymoid articular surfaces and a shorter pedal
47phalanx II-2 of eudromaeosaurs possibly allowed them to exert a greater gripping strength.
48Thus, they had the potential of hunting large prey. Instead, the longer and slender
49subarctometatarsus, lesser ginglymoid articular surfaces and a longer pedal phalanx II-2 of
50unenlagiines possibly gave to them greater cursorial capacities and the ability to hunt smaller

52dromaeosaurids lineages seem to indicate different locomotor and predatory specializations.

Introduction

55
56Unenlagiinae is a clade of Gondwanan paravians first recognized by Bonaparte [1] and which
57have been generally considered as a subfamily of dromaeosaurids from the phylogenetic
58analysis made by Makovicky et al. [2]. However, more recently other studies have challenged
59the dromaeosaurian affinities of unenlagiines and instead have proposed an alternative
60phylogenetic hypothesis in which these theropods are located within the stem of Avialae [3–
614]. Despite this and beyond the discussion about the relationships of unenlagiines, there are
62many shared morphologic features between unenlagiines and dromaeosaurids. One of these
63shared traits is the presence of a modified pedal digit II, with a hyperextensible phalanx II-2
64and a hypertrophied sickle-shaped claw. The peculiar form of this digit has led many
65researchers to make multiple interpretations about its possible function (e.g., [5–9]), although
66they all agree that it was involved in food obtaining, mainly through the submission and/or
67causing the death of the prey. Nevertheless, these functional interpretations are based mainly
68on the anatomy of derived Laurasian taxa (i.e., Dromaeosaurinae + Velociraptorinae or
69Eudromaeosauria following some authors, e.g., [10–11]), such as Deinonychus, Velociraptor,
70Saurornitholestes, Achillobator and Dromaeosaurus, in which the phalanges are markedly
71modified with respect to the plesiomorphic theropod morphology. Regarding the digit II of
72unenlagiines, it is similarly modified, although there are some anatomic differences with the
73digit II of eudromaeosaurs.
74

Moreover, the anatomical differences between unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs are

75not limited to those in this pedal digit, but also in other parts of the hindlimb. Mainly, the

76metatarsus differs between the two groups, since in unenlagiines is generally observed a
77subarctometatarsal condition, as in microraptorine dromaeosaurids and some basal
78troodontids, whereas in eudromaeosaurs the metatarsus is more robust and it has a structure
79more similar to the plesiomorphic condition in theropods. In the subarctometatarsal condition
80the metapodium has a similar morphology to the arctometatarsus, a type of metatarsal
81morphology observed in some theropod groups, such as tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, and
82alvarezsaurids. White [12] pointed out the way in which both morphologies differ, indicating
83that in the subarctometatarsus the proximal end of the metatarsal III, although constrained, is
84equally visible in anterior and plantar views (completely constrained proximally in the
85arctometatarsus and not visible); and in plantar view the third metatarsal is visible through the
86entire length of the metatarsus excluding metatarsals II and IV from buttressing. Several
87functional hypotheses have been raised regarding the arctometatarsus, most of them linked
88with an increasing of the mechanical efficiency during locomotion [12–17]. The
89subarctometatarsal condition could have related also to enhance the locomotor efficiency, and
90some authors consider it as transitional between the plesiomorphic morphology and the
91arctometatarsal condition [12].
92

In unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs the hindlimb, especially the autopodium, is

93implied both in locomotor and feeding functions, so beyond the phylogenetic relationships
94between both groups, the morphological differences possibly reflect different locomotor and
95predatory habits. Based on the previous ideas about the functional implications of the
96subarctometatarsal and the arctometatarsal condition, likely unenlagiines had locomotor
97capacities not present in eudromaeosaurs. These hypotheses have already been mentioned by
98previous authors (e.g., [9]), although not evaluated in a quantitative form, at least not for
99unenlagiines. The goal of the present contribution is to perform an analysis including taxa of
100unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs and to assess, in a quantitative mode, the morphological

102performed in order to arrive to a conclusion about the possibly dissimilar functions.

Materials and methods

105
106In order to evaluate quantitatively how the unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs differ
107morphologically was performed a morphometric analysis, employing a set of lineal
108measurements of the hindlimb bones of several theropod taxa. A diverse sample of theropod
109clades was considered, including extant birds, with the aim of covering a wide spectrum of
110morphologies, proportions and sizes of the elements of the hindlimb. So, the sample includes
111measurements of Herrerasaurus, non Tetanurae neotheropods, basal tetanurans, and
112representatives of most coelurosaur clades including Mesozoic avialans. It was considered
113also data from more recent although extinct groups of birds, i.e., Dinornithiformes, and from
114extant taxa, of which the locomotor habit, mode of feeding and capacities of the foot like
115‘grasping’ are known. Extant taxa of birds considered include mainly those ground-dwellers
116with cursorial locomotor habits, raptorial birds with different hunting modes and ‘grasping’
117capacities, and perching birds with more arboreal habits, such as passeriforms, also with
118‘grasping’ capacities (S1 Appendix). The measurements considered included proximodistal
119lengths of the femur (FL), tibiotarsus (TL), metatarsus (MtL), and non-ungual pedal
120phalanges, and the lateromedial width of the metatarsus at midshaft (ML). Regarding to MtL,
121the measures were taken for the longest element, typically the metatarsal III. For modern birds
122was considered the length of the tarsometatarsus, due to the complete fusion of the distal
123tarsals and metatarsals. The dimension ML refers to the lateromedial diameter of the
124articulated MT II, III and IV at midshaft of these bones.

125

Most of values of these measurements were obtained from previously published

126datasets, especially from [15] and also from other authors (see supplementary information),
127whereas others were obtained directly from materials deposited in different collections. For
128many taxa with published measurements the dimension ML was not considered by the
129authors, so in these cases ML was calculated from the published photographs of the
130specimens. For each taxon is specified the specimen from which the measurements were
131taken, except some not indicated by the author who published the data. In the case of taxa for
132which there are published measurements of several specimens, it has been decided to consider
133the data of only one of them, specifically the larger one, in order to avoid data of juvenile
134forms. Jointly, those specimens that were as complete as possible were taken into account,
135i.e., those with all the bones of the hindlimb preserved completely, in order to obtain the data
136of all the measurements. In some cases, estimated measurements have been taken of bones
137that have a small part not preserved, so even if it is estimated it is quite approximate to the
138real one. Additionally, measurements were obtained directly from materials housed in
139repositories of Argentina, including one specimen of the alvarezsauroid Alnashetri
140cerropoliciensis (MPCA), 17 specimens of many taxa of extant birds (MACN), and one
141specimen of Struthio camelus (CFA-OR). These are specified in the S1 Appendix.
142

Regarding lengths of pedal phalanges they were not taking into account the lengths of

143unguals, because there is no a consensus on how to measure this length, since some authors
144measure it in a straight line from the proximal end to the distal end of the phalanx, while
145others measure only the external curvature. So, published lengths of pedal unguals of
146theropods are not taken with the same criteria. Neither was considered the lengths of the
147phalanges of digit I, because in taxa of some clades included in the analysis, i.e.,
148ornithomimids, this digit is reduced and completely absent.

149

From this measurements phylogenetic principal component analyses (Phylogenetic

150PCA; see [18–19]) instead traditional PCA were performed. The phylogenetic principal
151component analyses allow the reduction of original variables to principal components
152correcting the non-independence among the former due the phylogenetic relationships
153between species. In this way, in a phylogenetic PCA the samples are not considered as
154independent datapoints, an assumption of the traditional PCA and frequently violated due the
155phylogenetic relationships between samples [18].
156

Given that the purpose of these analyses was the study of shape changes between

157species that cover a wide diversity of sizes, the phylogenetic PCA were constructed from,
158size-standardized, Mosimann variables [20], instead original ones. Each Mosimann variables
159were obtained as the ratio between the original variable and the geometric mean of all
160variables considered for the corresponding phylogenetic PCA.
161

From the complete dataset two phylogenetic principal component analyses were

162performed. One of them includes the long bones of the hindlimb measurements, i.e., FL, TL,
163MtL and ML, and the other one includes the lengths of the non-ungual pedal phalanges. In
164relation to the available data (S1 Appendix), the first PCA included 74 taxa, whereas the
165second one 32 taxa. This analysis design implying different taxonomic representatives in
166each principal component analysis (in relation to the available data and inability to perform
167these analyses with missing data), but allowed the maximization of the number of
168morphologies and taxa considered in each analysis.
169

After computed to Phylogenetic PCA, the phylogenetic relationships between species

170were projected into bivariate plots of morphospaces, constructing phylomorphospaces [19].
171To evaluate the phylogenetic signal on each phylogenetic principal component, the K statistic
172proposed by Blomberg et al. [21] where calculated for each axis. The K statistic provides a
173measure of the strength of phylogenetic signal data. The values smaller than one indicate a

174lack of phylogenetic signal or strong adaptative processes, values near 1 are expected if the
175character evolved following the phylogenetic relationships, under a Brownian motion model,
176and values greater than one show that phylogenetically closer taxa are more similar than
177expected, and eventually stasis processes [21–22].
178

Additionally, the size-effect on each axis of the morphospaces were calculated using

179phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regressions [23], considered the geometric
180mean as the independent variables. A PGLS regression allows the incorporation of the
181phylogenetic structure of samples as the error term of the regression equations, and then
182considering the biases caused by phylogeny in the calculation of the relationship between the
183analyzed variables.
184

All these analyses were carried out using the software R 3.5.0 [24] and using the

185PHYTOOLS [19], APE [25], and PICANTE [26] libraries.
186

For the Phylogenetic PCA and the PGLS, both for the analysis based on long bones

187measurements and that based on lengths of the phalanges, were used composited phylogenies
188which synthetized the relationships between taxa included in the study. These were based on
189previously published phylogenies of different theropod clades [27–42].
190

The morphological differences between unenlagiines and other dromaeosaurids also

191were evaluated through qualitative comparisons of the hindlimb bones, especially of the
192matatarsals and pedal phalanges. The morphology of dromaeosaurid taxa was observed
193directly from the holotypes of Deinonychus (YPM 5205), Bambiraptor (AMNH FR 30556),
194and Dromaeosaurus (AMNH FR 5356), and from the literature (e.g., [5–6, 10, 35, 40, 43–
19552]). The observations of the unenlagiines were made on the holotypes and referred materials
196of Buitreraptor (MPCA 245, MPCA 238, MPCA 478, and MPCN-PV-598), Neuquenraptor
197(MCF PVPH 77), Austroraptor (MML 195 and MML 220), and a cast of the holotype of

198Rahonavis (FMNH PR 2830). Additional comparisons with other theropod taxa were made
199using the literature and in the case of extant birds also using the materials above mentioned.
200

Curvature angles of unguals of unenlagiines and Laurasian dromaeosaurids were

201measured using the methodology applied by Fowler et al. [53], which in turn is based on that
202of Pike and Maitland [54]. Both the external and inner curvature angles of the unguals are
203measured with this methodology, i.e., from the dorsal and ventral borders respectively,
204obtaining the angle between the base and the tip of the claw. However, as this methodology
205was used to measure ungual curvatures of extant taxa of birds with soft tissue on digits some
206modifications were made. For extant birds the base of the claw is considered the point where
207the keratinous sheath emerges from the skin of the digit, although in fossil unguals lacking the
208sheath and soft tissue cannot be considered the same base of the claw to the measurement of
209the curvature angles. So, we take the proximodorsal tip of the ungual bone as the dorsal base
210to measure the external curvature angle, and the tip of the flexor tubercle as the ventral base
211(S2 Fig). However, the flexor tubercle shows two ventral tips in unguals of the analyzed
212theropods, both separated by an extension of the side groove of the claw, so the anterior end
213was taken as the base to measure the angle of the inner curvature. The angles were taken from
214photographs of the ungual phalanges using the measure tool in Adobe Photoshop. For
215incomplete materials which have not preserved the distal or the proximoventral ends these
216were reconstructed, although in these cases was indicated that the angle values are estimated.

233
234In the PPC analysis based on hindlimb long bones (femur, tibia, and metatarsals)
235measurements, including Mesozoic theropods (MzTer), extant birds, and Dinornithiformes the
236contributions of the osteological variables to the first principal component (PPC1) represent
23757.2% and to the second principal component (PPC2) represent 30.1% of the total variation
238(Fig 1). The PPC1 summarizes a major contribution of tibia and metatarsus lengths
239(negatively correlated with the PPC1) and the mediolateral width of metatarsus at midshaft
240(ML; positively correlated). High negative PPC1 scores depicted taxa with elongated and
241slender metatarsi and elongated tibiae, whereas less negative and positive PPC1 scores
242depicted taxa with shorter and wider metatarsi and shorter tibiae. The PPC2 summarizes a
243major contribution of femur length (positively correlated) and minor contributions of
244metatarsus length and ML (both variables negatively correlated). High positive PPC2 scores
245depicted taxa mainly with elongated femora and slightly short and slightly slender metatarsi,

247slightly wider metatarsi.

Extant birds and Dinornithiformes are partially segregated from the MzTer, toward

253negative scores of PPC1 and PPC2 (Fig 1). This is mainly because these groups of birds have
254comparatively longer and more slender metatarsi, longer tibiae, and shorter femora in
255comparison with the MzTer. More specifically, those taxa showing the longest and more
256slender metatarsi include terrestrial flightless or sparingly flying birds, i.e., the Cariamiformes
257(Cariama and Chunga) and the Struthioniformes, as well as some Passeriformes such as
258Furnarius. In fact, the Cariamiformes stand out by having extremely elongated metatarsi and
259tibiae, with a metatarsus longer than 1.5 times the femur length or even more than twice
260longer than the femur (as in Cariama) and a tibia longer than twice the femur length. The
261remaining terrestrial birds, i.e., the Tinamiformes and Dinornithiformes, show comparatively
262shorter metatarsi and tibiae. The Tinamiformes are located on negative PPC1 and positive
263PPC2 scores, closely to the arcto and subarctometatarsalian MzTer with elongated metatarsi
264and tibiae. With respect to the Dinornithiformes, they have comparatively wider metatarsi
265than the Tinamiformes.
266

Some extant raptor birds, such as the accipitrids (Elanus and Geranoaetus), some

267Strigiformes (Asio and Bubo), and some Dinornithiformes (Megalapteryx) are on low
268negative and positive PPC2 scores, closer to the MzTer with the longest and more slender
269metatarsi and the longest tibiae. These taxa show short and wide metatarsi, when are
270compared with the remaining extant birds (except the Tinamiformes).

271

Regarding to the MzTer, on high negative PPC1 scores are located the

272alvarezsauroids, derived ornithomimids, some oviraptorosaurs, basal avialans, troodontids,
273microraptorines, and unenlagiines, all of them with markedly elongated hindlimbs (more
274elongated and slender metatarsi and longer tibiae in comparison with the remaining MzTer).
275Moreover, many of these taxa are characterized by an arctometatarsal or subarctometatarsal
276condition.
277

The MzTer with the longest and the more slender metatarsi and longest tibiae are

278located on the highest negative PPC1 scores and among the lowest positive and some negative
279PPC2 scores. These taxa include the derived alvarezsaurids Parvicursor and Linhenykus, both
280with a very slender and markedly elongated arctometatarsalian metatarsus, which significantly
281surpass the femur length. Also is included in this part of the morphospace the basal avialan
282Hongshanornis, which although does not have an arctometatarsalian condition present a
283notably elongated and slender metatarsus which equals the femur length, locating on negative
284PPC2 scores (differing from other basal avialans).
285

Regarding unenlagiines, Buitreraptor is closer to Mahakala, Zhongjianornis,

286Zhenyuanlong, Struthiomimus, Mei, Alnashetri, and Sinovenator (Fig 1). These taxa show a
287long metatarsus, although slightly shorter and wider than in the MzTer above mentioned, so
288they are located on less negative PPC1 scores and more positive PPC2 scores. Rahonavis is
289closer to the oviraptorosaur Wulatelong than to Buitreraptor and presents less negative PPC1
290scores and slightly lower positive PPC2 scores than Buitreraptor. This separation is because
291Rahonavis has a slightly shorter and wider metatarsus than Buitreraptor and the other taxa
292closer to it.
293

Deinonychus and Velociraptor segregate and locate on less negative PPC1 scores than

294other dromaeosaurids, including Buitreraptor, since they have markedly shorter and wider
295metatarsi and shorter tibiae. In fact, Deinonychus is closer to tyrannosaurids than to other

296dromaeosaurids. Velociraptor is located on much more positive PPC2 scores, because it has
297an even shorter metatarsus and tibia comparatively with the femur. Khaan is an oviraptorid

The large-sized tyrannosaurids have short and wide metatarsi and short tibiae,

300although an arctometatarsalian condition. Many non-arctometatarsalian taxa characterized by
301relatively elongated although moderately wide metatarsi and moderately elongated tibiae, are
302located on low negative PPC1 scores and on low positive and negative PPC2 scores. Among
303these taxa are included basal ornithomimosaurs, the oviraptorosaur Chirostenotes, the
304ceratosaur Elaphrosaurus, and the dromaeosaurid Bambiraptor. It is noteworthy that
305Bambiraptor is separated from the other derived Laurasian dromaeosaurids, mainly due it
306shows a comparatively longer metatarsus.
307

The basal tetanurans, ceratosaurs, coelophysoids, and Herrerasaurus are located on

308the lowest negative and positive PPC1 scores. These taxa have a foot with plesiomorphic
309morphology showing the shortest and widest metatarsi and shortest tibiae among the
310theropods included in the analysis. The tyrannosauroid Dilong has a longer metatarsus with a
311more derived morphology, although it remains closer and is grouped with the mentioned taxa
312due its relatively wide metatarsus.

314Influence

of phylogeny in the distribution of taxa along the morphospace

315
316The K of Blomberg values indicate that the taxa distribution along the PPC1 is strongly
317influenced by the phylogenetic relationships of major clades (K=2.714) whereas PPC2 is less
318influenced by deep phylogenetic relationship, and related to the influence of the phylogenetic
319structure of terminals and more inclusive clade (K= 0.262) (S3 Table). Thus, the segregation
320and relatively scarcely overlapped distribution of these major clades along the PPC1 can be

321related to the high K value of this axis, while the low K value of PPC2 indicates that there
322exist many convergences to extreme values in different terminal and less inclusive clades.
323Observing the phylogenetic relationships plotted on the morphospace (i.e.,
324phylomorphospace; Fig 2) there exist a main separation trend of birds (including extant taxa
325and Dinornithiformes) toward negative values of the PPC1 and MzTer in less negative and
326positive values of PPC1. This separation is because birds have generally a longer and slender
327metatarsus and a longer tibia than MzTer. In addition, more derived taxa of some MzTer
328clades generally trend to locate on more negative values of PPC1 (as can be observed in
329tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, and alvarezsaurs), while most primitive taxa considered
330locate on the extreme positive values of PPC1, in relation with their plesiomorphic metatarsal
331morphology (Fig 2).

336

As was stated above, PPC2 summarizes morphological similarities between minor

337clades or terminals. Although PPC2 is less influenced by the structure of phylogenetic
338relationships of major clades, the positive correlation of this component with the femoral
339length can partially explain the division between MzTer and extant birds and
340Dinornithiformes, because in the latter there is a general trend to a significant shortening of
341the femur in comparison with MzTer, reason why they are mostly on negative values of the
342PPC2. The exception is the Tinamiformes, which are on positive values of PPC2, significantly
343separated from the remaining modern birds.
344

Regarding the distribution of MzTer along the PPC2 some trends are observed. Thus,

345in tyrannosauroids and ornithomimosaurs there is a marked separation between basal and

346derived taxa, because basal taxa are located on negative values (with short femora) and
347derived taxa tend to more positive values (with longer femora). Derived ornithomimosaurs
348and alvarezsauroids are characterized by an elongated tibia and metatarsus, although in the
349former the trend was a comparatively more marked elongation of the femur whereas in
350alvarezsauroids the trend was to shorten the femur in derived forms. In oviraptorosaurs the
351direction of the morphological changes was not as clear as in the coelurosaur groups
352mentioned, possibly because the small taxon sample is not adequate to show a clearer trend.
353Troodontids show a distribution of taxa along PPC2 similar to tyrannosauroids and
354ornithomimosaurs, since basal taxa are on low positive values of the axis whereas more
355derived taxa are on more positive values and hence they present a longer femur.
356

About the distribution of dromaeosaurids along the phylomorphospace (Fig 2) is

357observed an opposite tendency in comparison with other groups mentioned, since more basal
358taxa, such as Mahakala and the unenlagiines Buitreraptor and Rahonavis, are located on more
359negative values of PPC1, whereas more derived taxa, i.e., Deinonychus, Velociraptor, and
360Bambiraptor, are on less negative values of PPC1. In this way, the basal taxa present a longer
361metatarsus and tibia than derived forms. Regarding the location of taxa along PPC2,
362dromaeosaurids not show a clear trend, in contrast to the clades already explained. Basal taxa
363are located on similar values of PPC2, whereas microraptorines (at least those considered in
364this analysis) are more widely distributed. Thus, some microraptorines (i.e. Microraptor and
365Zhongjianosaurus) are on high positive values of PPC2, whereas others (i.e. Zhenyuanlong)
366are on similar PPC2 values than basal dromaeosaurids, with a shorter femur. Moreover,
367Microraptor and Zhongjianosaurus converge in the morphospace with derived ornithomimids
368with long femora. The derived dromaeosaurids are also widely distributed, being Velociraptor
369on high positive values of PPC2, close to some basal avialans, Bambiraptor on negative
370values, close to taxa with a shorter femur and longer metatarsus, and Deinonychus on an

372explained possibly by its comparatively longer femur with respect to the other derived
373dromaeosaurids here analyzed.

375Influence

of size in the distribution of taxa along the morphospace

376
377The PGLS regressions indicates that the PPC1 in the analysis based on long bones dimensions
378is significantly influenced by size (F = 7.318; p-value = 0.009). The MzTer taxa with the
379largest body sizes are located to the right side of the morphospace, on less negative and some
380positive values of the PPC1. Furthermore, Dinornithiformes, the larger modern birds
381considered in the analysis, are located to the right of the morphospace occupied by birds.
382These large-sized taxa are characterized by a comparatively short and wide metatarsus, as was
383explained above. By other side, smaller taxa with slender and longer hindlimbs are situated at
384the left of the morphospace, whether in the case of MzTer or modern birds. Conversely, PPC2
385(F = 2.162; p-value = 0.146) and PPC3 (F = 3.260; p-value = 0.075) in not significantly
386influenced by size, and it result agrees with the distribution of taxa along the axis.

of the PPCA based on phalanges lengths

389
390In the PPC analysis made from phalanges lengths, the contributions of the variables to the
391first principal component (PPC1) represent 39.0% and to the second principal component
392(PPC2) represent 29.1% of the total variation (Fig 3). Because these two axes explain a small
393percentage of the variation, we also analyzed the third component (10.8% of the total
394variation).

397pedal phalanges (PPC1 vs PPC2).

399

In the graphic of PPC1 vs PPC2 (Fig 3), the PPC1 summarizes a major contribution of

400the lengths of the proximal phalanges, i.e., Ph. II-1, III-1, IV-1, and III-2 (positively
401correlated with this component), and the lengths of the distal pre-ungual phalanges, i.e., II-2,
402III-3, and IV-4 (negatively correlated with this component). In this way high positive PPC1
403scores depict taxa with elongated proximal phalanges and high negative PPC1 scores depict
404taxa with elongated distal phalanges. The PPC2 summarizes major contributions of the
405lengths of the proximal and middle phalanges of digit IV, i.e., IV-2 and IV-3 (positively
406correlated with this component), and the lengths of the proximal and distal pre-ungual
407phalanges of digits II and III (negatively correlated). Thus, high positive PPC2 scores depict
408taxa with long phalanges IV-2 and IV-3 whereas high negative PPC2 scores depict taxa with
409long proximal or distal pre-ungual phalanges. Considering both principal components and
410summarizing the distribution along the morphospace, taxa on high positive PPC1 and high
411negative PPC2 scores are between those showing more elongated proximal phalanges,
412whereas those taxa located on negative PPC1 scores have relatively more elongated distal
413phalanges.
414

For the graphic of PPC2 vs PPC3 (Fig 4), in addition to those already commented for

415PPC2, the PPC3 (10.8% of the total variation) summarizes major contributions of the lengths
416of all the phalanges of digit II (positively correlated with this component), and to a lesser
417extent it summarizes contributions of the lengths of phalanges of digit III, mainly Ph. III-2
418and III-3 (negatively correlated). Thus, high positive PPC3 scores depict taxa with a long digit
419II whereas high negative PPC2 scores depict taxa with long phalanges III-2 and III-3.

In the morphospace, dromaeosaurids occupy central values of PPC1, high positive of

424values of PPC2, and high negative PPC3 scores (Figs 3 and 4). All representatives are mainly
425on negative PPC1 scores, except Bambiraptor which is on low positive PPC1 values.
426Deinonychus, Buitreraptor, and Bambiraptor are located on higher positive PPC2 scores and
427Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus on less positive scores of this component. The high
428positive values of PPC2 of dromaeosaurids are linked to a remarkably elongated digit IV, a
429feature mainly product of elongation of phalanges IV-2 and IV-3, while the high negative
430values on PPC3 are also mainly related to the length of phalanges of digit IV, but also
431influenced by the length of Ph. III-2 and III-3. Deinonychus and Buitreraptor show a
432relatively long digit IV in comparison with other dromaeosaurids, although Deinonychus is
433slightly located on more negative PPC1 scores so the position of this taxon is also specifically
434influenced by the length of phalanx IV-4. Sinornithosaurus is the taxon with higher PPC3
435values, a position influenced by the elongated phalanges III-3 and II-2. The location of
436Microraptor is due a relatively shorter digit IV in comparison with Deinonychus,
437Buitreraptor, and Bambiraptor, whereas the length of phalanx IV-4 influenced in its position
438on more negative PPC1 scores.
439

Troodontids show a distribution on the morphospace mainly similar to that of

440dromaeosaurids (Figs 3 and 4), except by Troodon which is located on negative PPC2 scores,
441with relatively shorter digit IV than the others troodontids in the analysis. Anchiornis is much
442close to Deinonychus and Buitreraptor, a position mainly influenced by a long digit IV. The
443location of Sinornithoides and Talos, in less negative values of PPC2, is related to their less

444elongated digit IV in comparison with Anchiornis. In turn, Talos is close to Microraptor and
445thus its position is also influenced by the length of phalanx IV-4.
446

Non-coelurosaurian theropods are dispersed in the morphospace (Figs 3 and 4).

447Dilophosaurus locates on very low negative PPC1, PPC2, and PPC3 scores, showing subtle
448elongated distal phalanges and a slightly longer digit III. The two basal tetanurans included in
449the analysis, i.e. Allosaurus and Gualicho, have similar PPC1 and PPC3 values, although they
450segregate along PPC2, thus indicating that the difference in length between digit IV and digits
451II and III is the main factor influencing the separation of these tetanurans. The position of
452Gorgosaurus, which is the only tyrannosaurid included in the analysis, is mainly influenced
453by relatively long proximal phalanges and especially by those of digit IV.
454

Oviraptorosaurs show a wide distribution on the morphospace (Figs 3 and 4), since

455Corythoraptor and Khaan have a more elongated digit IV whereas Avimimus has more
456elongated proximal phalanges of digits II and III and a comparatively longer digit III.
457

Ornithomimosaurs are on positive PPC1 and PPC3 scores and on negative PPC2

458scores, a location mainly influenced by longer proximal phalanges and a relatively longer
459digit II. The position of Struthiomimus is related to a longer digit II and Ph. III-1 than those of
460Gallimimus and Aepyornithomimus.
461

Mesozoic avialans are on negative PPC1 and PPC3 scores and on positive and

462negative PPC2 scores (Figs 3 and 4). Basal taxa, i.e., Archaeopteryx and Zhongjianornis, are
463on positive PPC2 values, although Zhongjianornis highlights due it is located on high
464negative PPC3 values. The position of Archaeopteryx indicates that it has a long digit IV,
465mainly due elongation of Ph. IV-3 and IV-4. The location of Zhongjianornis, Confuciusornis,
466Yanornis, and Yixianornis is mainly influenced by a greater elongation of distal phalanges of
467digits II, III, and IV and by a digit III comparatively longer. Specifically, the position of
468Zhongjianornis is biased by the length of digits III-2 and III-3, and secondarily influenced by

470longer Ph. III-1 and the position of Confuciusornis is secondarily influenced by a longer digit
471IV.
472

Extant birds are mainly distributed along negative PPC2 and PPC3 scores, although

473there is observed a dichotomy along the PPC1, because some taxa are on positive scores and
474others on negative ones (Figs 3 and 4). The position of taxa on positive PPC1, such as Rhea,
475Nothoprocta, Cariama, and Chunga is mainly influenced by long proximal phalanges of
476digits II, III, and IV. The most notorious bias is observed on Rhea, whilst the position of
477Cariama and Chunga is also influenced by the length of Ph. III-3. Those taxa on negative
478PPC1 scores, i.e., Turdus and Bubo are markedly influenced by the length of distal phalanges
479of digits II, III, and IV, being the position of Bubo the more affected by this trait.
480Additionally, the position of these two taxa is biased by a comparatively longer digit III.
481Moreover, this digit is longer in Bubo and Turdus in comparison with digit III of the other
482extant birds analyzed.

484Influence

of phylogeny in the distribution of taxa along the morphospace

485
486The K of Blomberg values indicate that the taxa distribution along the PPC1, PPC2, and
487PPC3 is strongly influenced by relationships between terminals and less inclusive clades in
488the case of PPC1 (K=0.303) and PPC2 (K=0.376), and linked to the many morphological
489convergences between distant taxa described above (S4 Table). The PPC3 also show a K
490value lesser than 1 but more closer to 1 (K=0.811), fitting more closely with a stochastic
491model (i.e., the distribution of taxa follows the phylogenetic relationships but is not
492particularly strong influenced by deep nodes neither terminal relationships).

493

For instance, basal taxa included in the analysis, such as basal tetanurans and the basal

494coelurosaur Gorgosaurus are almost indifferently located on similar values of PPC1, although
495they are separated along PPC2 and PPC3 (Figs 5 and 6). The ornithomimids also are
496significantly separated mainly along PPC2, although the scarce sample of this group of
497theropods and recent phylogenetic analyses [55], which show them in a polytomy on the
498cladogram, difficult to shed light to how phylogeny and the distribution along the
499mosphospace are related.

507

Among oviraptorosaurs it can be observed a wide distribution of taxa along PPC3 (Fig

5086), whereas in the remaining clades the distribution of taxa is more limited along this
509component according phylogenetic relationships. Thus, the basal taxon Avimimus is
510remarkably separated from the more derived Corythoraptor and Khaan mostly throughout the
511PPC3 and also the PPC2. So, the basal and derived taxa are mainly divided by length
512differences between the digit IV (larger in derived taxa) and the digits II and III (larger in
513basal taxa), as can be observed in the PPC2 vs PPC3 axes.
514

Regarding dromaeosaurids, they show a convergence between basal and derived taxa,

515since Buitreraptor is located near the derived eudromaeosaurids Deinonychus and
516Bambiraptor (Figs 5 and 6). These three taxa have a comparatively elongated digit IV than

517Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus, which are more derived than Buitreraptor although more
518basal with respect to the eudromaeosaurids.
519

Among troodontids there is observed an evolutionary trend to shorten the digit IV and

520to increase the length of digit III and to a slight elongation of proximal phalanges, as shows
521the PPC1vsPPC2 graphic (Fig 5). Thus the basal taxon Anchiornis is convergently located
522near to Deinonychus and Buitreraptor, with a proportionally more elongated digit IV, whereas
523Troodon has the shortest digit IV and a comparatively longer digit III as can be observed in
524the PPC2 vs PPC3 graphic (Fig 6).
525

Mesozoic avialans show a similar evolutionary trend than troodontids, since the basal

526taxon Archaeopteryx has an elongated digit IV whereas in more derived taxa this digit
527decreases in length whereas the other digits lengthen, specifically the digit III (Figs 5 and 6).
528In turn there is a trend to an elongation of the distal non-ungual phalanges of digits II, III, and
529IV in more derived forms, as can be observed in the PPC1vs PPC2 axes.
530

The sample of extant birds included in this analysis is small, although a certain

531evolutionary trend can be observed. In general lines, there is an increase in length of the distal
532non-ungual phalanges and of the digit III as a whole. Thus, the more basal Rhea has long
533proximal phalanges and a digit III comparatively shorter, whereas the more derived Turdus
534and Bubo have markedly longer distal non-ungual phalanges and a particularly elongated digit
535III.

540analyzed for the phalange measures (i.e., PPC1, PPC2, and PPC3) are not significantly

Discussion

546
547Previous authors enumerated the morphological features of animals traditionally considered
548as ‘cursorials’: relatively long limbs; hinge-like joints; distal limb segments proportionally
549elongated; the reduction, compression or loss of the ulna and fibula and of the lateral
550metapodials and phalanges; reduction or loss of distal muscular groups or proximal location
551of their scars; a limb motion restricted to the sagittal plane;acquisition of digitigrade or
552unguligrade stance; and metapodials interlocked, fused or reduced to a single element [13,
55356–61]. From the perspective of the locomotor performance, animals known as cursorials
554have the capacity to move at greater velocities or for extensive distances with a low energetic
555cost [60–63]. However, Carrano [61] considered that a discrete categorization of the
556locomotor habits could not be appropriate and instead these habits would be evaluated along a
557multivariate continuum between two locomotor extremes, i.e., strictly graviportal and
558cursorial. Theropods can be generally considered as cursorial animals (or ‘subcursorial’,
559according to Coombs [13]), due they were bipeds, digitigrades and with long and
560parasagittally oriented hindlimbs [64], although different taxa would be dispersed along a
561continuum that includes different grades of cursoriality. The distribution in the morphospace
562obtained in the multivariate analyses performed, could reflect such ecomorphological
563diversity. Thus, those taxa with more elongated distal segments of the hindlimbs (i.e., tibia
564and metatarsus), a more slender and compressed metapodium, and reduced lateral pedal digits
565likely had a greater cursorial capacity [59, 61]. These taxa would locate closer to the

566‘cursorial extreme’ of the multivariate continuum than taxa with shorter segments of the
567hindlimb, with a more robust metapodium, and lateral digits less reduced.
568

The elongation of the distal elements of the hindlimb (i.e., tibia and metatarsus) allows

569increasing of the stride length and speed of movements, which are related to a greater
570cursorial capacity [9, 61]. Garland and Janis [60] explained than the ratio between the lengths
571of metatarsus and femur (MT/F) was repeatedly considered by some authors as a predictor of
572locomotor performance in fossil forms. However, Garland and Janis [60] and other authors
573[65–67] warned that ratios between hindlimb bones are not good predictors of the type of
574locomotion, so limb proportions must be considered with caution. Thus, it is important take to
575account also qualitative aspects, such as the morphology of the metapodium, to make
576inferences about locomotor capacities.
577

The arctometatarsal and subarctometatarsal conditions could confer significant

578cursorial capabilities. Some authors [12, 15] have verified that theropod taxa with these
579conditions have distal elements of the hindlimb significantly more elongated than taxa with a
580plesiomorphic metapodium. Moreover, many authors have postulated biomechanic
581hypotheses about the performance of the arctometatarsal and subarctometatarsal foot, and
582how the interaction motions between metatarsals and transfer of forces along the metatarsus
583provide advantages during locomotion, which could represent benefits for the cursorial habit
584[12–17, 68].
585

Regarding morphology of pedal phalanges, in extant terrestrial birds with a cursorial

586locomotor mode and walking capacity (e.g., ratites such as ostriches, emus, Pterocnemia, and
587Rhea) the pre-ungual phalanges tend to shorten distally [9, 69–71]. Further, in these birds the

591articular facets, indicating that they were under higher torsional efforts [9, 72–73]. Similar
592features are observed especially in Mesozoic theropod taxa considered with greater cursorial
593capabilities, much of them possessing long tibiae and metatarsi and an arctometatarsalian
594condition, such as ornithomimids, alvarezsaurids, caenagnathids, and Avimimus (e.g., [9, 13,
59533, 38, 55, 74–83].
596

By contrast, extant birds with a foot with grasping capacities are characterized by an

597elongation of the distal pre-ungual phalanges of the digits, especially the penultimate phalanx
598[69–71, 84–85]. This can be observed either in perching and raptorial extant birds. Even, the
599elongation of distal phalanges is convergently observed in arboreal mammals which have
600grasping autopodia, such as the sloths ([85], and references herein).

of the PPCA analyses related with the locomotor

of theropods

604
605Taking into account the diverse factors and how they affect differentially the hindlimb
606elements, it is important to consider both analyses together (i.e., long bones and phalanges
607proportions) to make adequate inferences about the locomotor habits of theropods. For
608instance, Avimimus and Sinornithoides are very close to each other in the PPCA morphospace
609constructed from the long bones measures, and there no evident differences (Fig 1), while the
610PPCA based on phalanges lengths reveals clear dissimilarities between these taxa (Figs 3 and
6114). The later analysis indicates that the cursorial capacities of Avimimus are greater than those
612of Sinornithoides, whose phalanges proportions are possibly more related to a grasping
613function.
614

Based on the results of the PPCA made from phalanges length, taxa such as Avimimus,

615Cariama, and Rhea are considered with greater cursorial capacities [86–88], which are

616associated with more elongated proximal phalanges and a long digit III (Figs 3, 4 and 7).
617Other taxa, such as ornithomimids (especially Struthiomimus) also have traits related to more
618cursorial capabilities, i.e., more elongated proximal phalanges, although their digit III is not as
619long as in the taxa above mentioned. Instead, Bubo, Turdus, and some Mesozoic avialans
620close to them had a foot with elongated distal phalanges which possibly had more grasping
621capacities. Concerning taxa such as Gualicho, Allosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Corythoraptor, and
622Khaan they have slightly more elongated proximal phalanges, so could have had certain
623cursorial capacities, also taking into account they have a digit IV almost as long as digit III.

641markedly short and thus digits III and IV are the main structures of the foot support [6, 8, 89–
64294].
643

In the analysis based on long bones measurements (Fig 1) the PPC2 is less influenced

644by phylogeny and the distribution of taxa along this axis could show a clearer separation
645related with habits. TheMzTer on more positive values of PPC2 (Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus,
646Beishanlong, Garudimimus), which show short and robust metatarsi, can be considered with a
647minor cursorial capacity than those taxa tending to locate at less positive and negative values
648of PPC2 (Dilong, Archaeornithomimus, Elaphrosaurus, and Herrerasaurus), which show
649longer and slender metatarsi. In the case of modern birds also is observed the same general
650trend. Coincidentally, the taxa on negative values generally have comparatively smaller body
651sizes, except for Megalosaurus.
652

Along the PPC1 those taxa tending to positive or low negative scores can be

653considered with less cursorial capacities than those located at more negative scores. Thus,
654taxa such as Linhenykus and Parvicursorare interpreted with high cursorial abilities, in
655addition to having a markedly elongated and slender highly derived arctometatarsus [33, 78,
65695] (Fig 8). Unfortunately, these two taxa have not preserved all the pedal phalanges and so
657they cannot be included in the analysis based on phalanges lengths. However, other
658alvarezsaurid considered in the analysis, i.e., Kol ghuva [96], shows pedal phalanges
659proportions that indicate cursorial capacities.

Our quantitative analyses, in addition to other features already described

674(subarctometatarsal configuration; [42, 97]) indicate that Buitreraptor can be considered with
675probable high cursorial capabilities. Other MzTer with probable similar locomotor capacities
676are the dromaeosaurids Zhenyuanlong and the troodontids Sinovenator and Mei, which were
677already described as possessing an arctometatarsal or subarctometatarsal condition [2, 42, 52,
67897–100]. Further, these taxa present hindlimb and pes proportions similar to non679dromeosaurid theropods such as Struthiomimus, an ornithomimid probably markedly
680cursorial, as also indicate the PPCA based on phalanges lengths. Notwithstanding,
681Buitreraptor has phalanges proportions indicating grasping adaptations and related with a
682lesser cursorial performance. Unfortunately, phalanges lengths of Sinovenator, Mei, and
683Zhenyuanlong were difficult to obtain, because fragmentary preservation and incomplete

693
694The main differences between the hindlimbs of unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs are related
695with the relative length and form of the metatarsus, and the morphology of the phalanges of
696the digit II [4, 42, 101–102]. In unenlagiines the metatarsus is significantly elongated when is
697compared with the femur and tibia (except in Rahonavis), and it is slender because its
698lateromedial width (ML) is significantly lower than its total length (MtL) (except in
699Rahonavis) (Figs 7 and 8), whereas in eudromaeosaurs the metatarsus is remarkably shorter
700and the ratio ML/MtL is larger. Moreover, unenlagiines show a subarctometatarsal condition,
701whereas eudromaeosaurs have a metatarsus more similar to the plesiomorphic condition [6,
70235, 44, 103–104]. These characters indicate that the metatarsus of eudromaeosaurs is overall
703more robust than that of unenlagiines.
704

The metatarsi of Neuquenraptor (MCF PVPH 77) and Austroraptor (MML 195) are

705incomplete, although their approximate length can be estimated, indicatingthey were very
706elongated with respect to the tibia and femur. Thus, these taxa possibly had length proportions
707of the hindlimb bones much similar to those of Buitreraptor. Moreover, Neuquenraptor and
708possibly Austroraptor (based on the specimen MML 220), also have a subarctometatarsal
709condition.
710

The long bone proportions of Buitreraptor are remarkably different with respect to

711those of eudromaeosaurs here analyzed, i.e., Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and Bambiraptor
712(Fig 8). Instead, Buitreraptor is more similar to other taxa with a relatively elongated
713metatarsus, either with an arctometatarsal, a subarctometatarsal, or non-subarctometatarsal
714condition, such as Mahakala, Alnashetri, Zhongjianornis, Zhenyuanlong, Sinovenator, and

715Mei. These taxa are similar in size or smaller than Buitreraptor [50, 52, 98–100, 105–108].
716According to previous authors a similar size and hindlimb proportions would presumably
717indicate a similar locomotor mode [12, 15, 65]. Moreover, this resemblance in the locomotor
718mode can be also supported by the similar metatarsus morphology between some of these
719taxa.
720

Rahonavis departs from the general morphology of other unenlagiines, by its shorter

721tibia and a shorter and wider non-subarctometatarsal metatarsus (Figs 7 and 8) [109]. On the
722other hand, Rahonavis has hindlimb proportions more similar to those of unenlagiines than
723those of eudromaeosaurs, especially because it has a comparatively short femur and long tibia.
724Thus, Rahonavis can be considered as the less cursorial unenlagiine analyzed, although
725clearly more cursorial than eudromaeosaurs.
726

Additionally, differences in the distal articular surfaces of metatarsals between

727unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs were also denoted by previous authors (e.g., [3, 9, 42]). In
728eudromaeosaurs the MT I, II and III have a well-developed ginglymoid distal articular surface
729[5, 6, 9, 44–45]. This could indicate that the first phalanges flexed and extended
730predominantly in a single plane [9]. Instead, in unenlagiines the ginglymoid distal facet of the
731MT II and III is less developed, so Ph. II-1 and III-1moved in a predominant vertical plane
732although probably with some degree of sideways movement. The distal surface of MT I of
733unenlagiines is ball-shaped, as in Buitreraptor (MPCA 238, [42, 97]) and Rahonavis (FMNH
734PR 2830) or it is slightly ginglymoid, as in Neuquenraptor [110–111].Thus, in
735Neuquenraptor the range of movement was probably more similar to that of digit I of
736eudromaeosaurs, whereas in Buitreraptor and Rahonavis digit I could have had a greater
737motion range. The more restricted motion of digits in eudromaeosaurs (which is emphasized
738by the more ginglymoid interphalangeal articulations in comparison with unenlagiines) could
739be more resistant to torsional stress and thus preventing disarticulation of the joints during

740manipulation of the prey with a greater grasping force [9]. In the case of the distal facet of MT
741IV it is generally more rounded in dromaeosaurids, which matches with the concave proximal
742articular facet of Ph.IV-1. This trait possibly indicates more freedom of movement for digit
743IV [9]. Thus, unenlagiines had the capacity to oppose pedal digits between them in a similar
744way to Deinonychus [9]. Digits I and IV probably had a wide range of motion, which would
745have allowed these digits converge during flexion, thus achieving a grip position.
746
747Morphology

of pedal phalanges

748
749The only unenlagiine with all the pedal phalanges preserved to date is Buitreraptor. Our
750results indicated that it is similar in phalanges proportions with respect to eudromaeosaurs
751analyzed, i.e., Deinonychus and Bambiraptor. The three taxa highlight by their markedly
752elongated digit IV, with a total length greater than that of digit III (Fig 7). In Neuquenraptor
753and Rahonavis it can be estimated that digit IV is shorter than digit III, as in Sinornithosaurus
754and Microraptor, because the sum of lengths of the other pre-ungual phalanges of digit IV is
755significantly lower than the total length of digit III and although Ph. IV-4 has been equal in
756length or slightly longer than Ph. IV-3 the complete digit IV would have been slightly shorter
757than digit III. By contrast in other MzTer included in the analysis such as derived troodontids,
758non-paravian coelurosaurs and basal tetanurans the digit III is the longest and the digit IV is
759significantly shorter, which are proportions related with probable more cursorial capacities [9,
76072–73]. So, the length proportions of dromaeosaurids digits, including unenlagiines and
761especially Buitreraptor, seem to indicate a restriction to their cursorial habit.
762

Also, dromaeosaurids show a significant elongation of the distal pre-ungual phalanges,

763a feature related with grasping capacities (see cited literature above). Generally, in
764unenlagiines the length proportions of the distal phalanges of digit III are similar to those of

765eudromaeosaurs, although in the digit II the second phalanx is shorter than the first one (S1
766Appendix), indicating slightly lower grasping capacities in unenlagiines. In others
767dromaeosaurids, such as Microraptor, Ph. III-3 is significantly shorter than III-2, a feature
768that also could indicate a decreasing of grasping capacities. Unfortunately, the lack of
769preserved elements prevents a more accurate analysis of the phalangeal proportions of
770Neuquenraptor and Rahonavis, although the available data and the apparently long distal
771phalanges of digit IV in Neuquenraptor indicate for this taxon more accentuated grasping
772capacities than other unenlagiines and resembling those of eudromaeosaurs (S1 Appendix).
773

In other groups of MzTer distal phalanges of digit IV generally maintain a similar

774length (S1 Appendix and S5 Text). By contrast, the length proportion of distal phalanges of
775digits II and III is more variable, due in some taxa these phalanges are shorter than the
776proximal ones (taxa considered as more cursorials) whereas in others taxa the distal phalanges
777are longer although they not surpass the length of the proximal ones (taxa with possible
778grasping abilities of the feet). In extant birds with a grasping foot, such as Turdus and Bubo,
779the distal phalanges are significantly long (S1 Appendix and Fig 7).
780

Many current birds with grasping capacities of the feet are ‘perchers’ and have

781arboreal habits, i.e., they are predominantly arboreal foragers [112]. An arboreal habit for
782some unenlagiines is difficult to envisage or impossible in taxa such as Neuquenraptor,
783Unenlagia, and Austroraptor because of their large sizes. Further, this habit is correlated in
784paravians with aerial locomotor capacities, although previous authors considered that
785aerodynamical features in large-sized dromaeosaurids were lost, as suggested by the scarce
786development or lack of papillae for feather attachment on the ulna [105]. In smaller taxa such
787as Buitreraptor and Rahonavis this lifestyle would have been more probable not only because
788of their smaller size but also because they have evidence of feathered forelimbs by preserved
789quill knobs (in Rahonavis [109]) and many osteological traits which suggest the capacity of

790flapping flight [4]. Also, it is possible that Buitreraptor and Rahonavis have been able to
791climb trees, especially considering the claw of pedal digit II as a potential tool for this
792purpose [7]. However, it is important to take into account the paleoenvironment in which they
793lived, since for example Buitreraptor was found in sedimentites that indicate a mainly aeolian
794environment and the existence of a large desert [113–116], where the trees were probably
795very scarce or nonexistent. So, the hindlimb morphology of Buitreraptor, mainly that of the
796metatarsus, is probably more related to a terrestrial habit than to an arboreal one.
797

Concerning qualitative aspects of the digit II of unenlagiines, it is modified as in

798eudromaeosaurs, although important differences are observed. First, in unenlagiines such as
799Buitreraptor, Neuquenraptor, and Unenlagia paynemili (MUCPv 1066), the distal articular
800surface of phalanx II-2 is less proximally extended. This feature restricts the extension of the
801ungual phalanx, as can be observed in an isolated articulated digit II of Buitreraptor (MPCA
802478 [42]), in which the ungual seems to be totally extended (Fig 9). In Deinonychus and
803Bambiraptor this articular surface is more proximally extended (FAG personal observation of
804YPM 5205 and AMNH FR 30556), and thus the claw had the possibility of a greater
805extension (see [8]). Additionally, the phalanges of digit II of eudromaeosaurs are
806comparatively more robust than those of unenlagiines. This digit is the main implied in the
807predatory function, so a robust digit II in eudromaeosaurs could be advantageous to capture
808and subdue large prey. Moreover, eudromaeosaurs have a short Ph. II-1. Taking into account
809that the Ph. II-1 represent part of the out-lever of the flexor muscle of the digit (possibly the
810M. flexor perforatus digiti II, which probably was inserted onto the proximoventral zone of
811the phalanx as in extant birds [117–118]), the shortness of this phalanx could maximize
812mechanical advantage of the flexor and the grasping strength of digit II. Another difference is
813the more proximally extended proximoventral heel of phalanx II-2 of eudromaeosaurs, which
814possibly was an insertion point of flexor muscles [6].

827
828

So, although in general traits the unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs have phalanges of

829digit II with similar morphological characteristics, it is observed that these characters are
830more accentuated in the eudromaeosaurs, including a shorter phalanx II-1, a phalanx II-2 with
831a more proximally extended proximoventral heel, a shorter and more dorsoventrally
832constrained shaft, and a distal articular surface more extended proximally. This seems to
833indicate the presence of a digit II with the capacity of exert stronger predatory efforts in
834eudromaeosaurs, which could be an advantageous feature for subdue large preys. Conversely,
835the mentioned differences in the phalangeal morphology of unenlagiines could indicate weak
836predatory efforts, but the longer Ph. II-1 also suggests faster movements of digit II, what
837could be eventually useful for hunting small preys.
838

Regarding the degree of development and curvature of the claw of digit II it is difficult

839to evaluate differences between eudromaeosaurs and unenlagiines, mainly because most

840unenlagiines have not preserved a complete ungual. With the available data (S6 Table) we do
841not observe clear evidences indicating than eudromaeosaurs have a more developed and more
842curved ungual than unenlagiines.
843

Another possible difference between unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs is respect to

844the location of digit I, which might have some implications in the grasping function. For
845instance, in Deinonychus the digit I is articulated to the middle zone of the diaphysis of the
846MT II [6, 9], suggesting it would have closed over the posterior face of the metatarsus during
847flexion. Moreover, previous authors proposed that in this taxon the metatarsus would have
848been positioned semi-horizontally while the animal was subject to its prey and thus helping to
849restrain it [9]. Among unenlagiines only one specimen of Buitreraptor (MPCN-PV-598)
850preserved a complete and articulated foot, in which the digit I seems to be located in the
851original position, articulated to the medial and distal surface of MT II [97]. This location
852could indicate that the metatarsus have been in a more vertical position during the submission
853of the prey, which would have been more effective for the digit I to participate in the gripping
854function.

An interesting convergence is observed between extant raptorial birds and some

860eudromaeosaurs, in the morphospace of the long bone measurements. Both groups tend to
861positive PPC2 values (Fig 1), due they have longer femora and consequently shorter
862metatarsi. Moreover, raptorial birds converge specifically with Deinonychus and Velociraptor
863in the presence of wider metatarsi, as is reflected by their less negative values for PPC1 in
864both groups. Generally, in current raptorial birds a shorter and robust metatarsus is related

865with the ability of the foot to exert a greater grip force, whereas a longer metatarsus is related
866with a minor grip force although it has the capacity for rapid movement [9, 53, 66–67, 119–
867120]. In a general way, owls (Strigiformes) have the shortest and more robust metatarsus
868whereas falconids and especially accipitrids have a longer and slender metatarsus [53, 119–
869120]. Thus, owls have a greater grip capacity and strength, although these features also are
870related to other characters of the foot such as the presence of sesamoids, a specialized tendon
871locking mechanism and a facultative zygodactyl condition [53, 119–120]. Between the
872raptorial birds included in our analyses, Milvago and Polyborus (falconids of the subfamily
873Polyborinae) are characterized by relatively longer and slender tarsometatarsus when are
874compared with accipitrids (i.e., Geranoaetus and Elanus). This could indicate greater
875cursorial capacities, in agreement to what was expressed by previous authors [121].
876

Analogously, the short and robust metatarsus of eudromaeosaurs, such as Velociraptor

877and Deinonychus, could have allowed a great generation of grip force [6, 9]. By contrast, the
878elongated subarctometatarsus of unenlagiines could have had a greater capacity of rapid
879movement, like falconids and accipitrids, although it could have reduced grip strength [9].
880

Despite morphological and even functional features can be compared between these

881theropods and extant raptorial birds, it must be considered that these birds are predominantly
882aerial with a generally limited terrestrial locomotion (but see [121]). Many common features
883in the autopodium of raptorial birds can be interpreted as the result of a predominant influence
884of hunting and grasping specializations (e.g., elongation of distal non-ungual phalanges
885independently of the specific type of prey and the hunting method employed by them; [69–71,
88685, 122], instead terrestrial locomotion. Conversely, dromaeosaurids, like most Cretaceous
887theropods, had a terrestrial locomotion, and it is expectable that both factor of selective
888pressures, i.e., predation and terrestrial locomotion, have a great influence in the hindlimb and
889autopodium. This is a main reason to explain the segregation in the morphospace between

890extant birds and dromaeosaurids, and also it might explain the presence of elongated distal
891phalanges in dromaeosaurids although not as strikingly long as those of extant raptorial birds
892(see also the study about the modular fashion of evolution of pedal phalanges proportions
893[85]). Thus, differences in hindlimb between eudromaeosaurs and unenlagiines can be
894considered mainly focusing in these, partially antagonist, specializations. The morphological
895design of the eudromaeosaurs autopodia indicates a more marked specialization to the
896predatory habit, whereas in unenlagiines a more marked cursorial specialization would have
897been occurred.

901
902Unenlagiines possibly had a better cursorial locomotor performance and the capacity to reach
903greater running velocities than eudromaeosaurs with shorter and more robust metatarsi. Of
904course, this does not mean that eudromaeosaurs did not have an effective locomotion and the
905ability to run fast, but that the morphological characters of the hindlimb of the unenlagiines
906would have given these animals greater and more efficient cursorial capacities. Possibly,
907eudromaeosaurs may have made sudden runs at high speeds, but for shorter periods of time or
908for short distances, while unenlagiines could maintain an accelerated pace for more time and/
909or distance. Regarding the metatarsus of eudromaeosaurs it has a structure with functional
910capacities possibly more useful to predation than to cursorial locomotion. About the
911morphology of pedal phalanges the discrepancies observed between both groups, especially
912those of digit II, could be more directly related with different predatory habits.
913

Despite the mentioned dissimilarities between unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs, it is

914remarkable that is the general structure of the metatarsus which shows a more drastic

915difference. The metapodium had a greater morphological plasticity along evolution of
916dromaeosaurids, since its structure differs significantly in unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs
917(and in microraptorines, which also have a subarctometatarsal condition), in relation to the
918relative and different importance of the mechanical benefits associated both with predatory
919and locomotor functions in both clades. On the other hand, as was explained above, the length
920proportions of phalanges are not meaningfully dissimilar between these groups. This factor
921could be related to the phalanges are the main elements implied in predator functions, which
922exerted a greater selective pressure on their morphology, independently of the feeding
923strategy and locomotor habit. Nevertheless, some specific differences, such as the longer and
924slender phalanx II-1 and the greater freedom of movement of the remaining digits of
925unenlagiines, could allow them a fast and secure grip of small and agile/elusive prey that do
926not demand great efforts to be subdue.
927

Unenlagiines have similar modifications of the metapodium than microraptorines and

928probably they had a similar mode of moving on the ground, beyond the capacity of gliding
929postulated for some microraptorines [123–125]. It can be that these two groups of
930dromaeosaurids used digit II for predation, although the predatory habits, i.e., the hunting way
931and the type of prey, were not necessarily the same, also taking into account that
932microraptorines (at least Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus) have a phalanx II-1 shorter than
933II-2 (S1 Appendix), as in eudromaeosaurs. Moreover, some specimens of Microraptor gui
934indicate it fed mammals, enantiornithine birds, and fishes, which is evidence of diverse
935feeding habits and possibility of exploit different substrates such as ground, trees, and water,
936in that taxon [126–128].
937

Likely, unenlagiines preyed on rapid and elusive animals, although it is difficult to

938know more specifically the type of prey that they hunted, even without having direct
939evidences such as the gut content of Microraptor specimens. Nevertheless, it is possible to

940achieve an approximation of the feeding habits of unenlagiines, especially for the better
941represented taxa such as Buitreraptor. Regarding other unenlagiines the information is
942scarcer, so it is more difficult to infer if among them there were noticeable differences in the
943feeding modes and on the types of animals that preyed.
944

Considering the small size, slender proportions (especially those of metapodium), and

945the inferred cursorial capacities, Buitreraptor probably foraged on the ground searching small
946preys, such as invertebrates, reptiles or mammals, throughout large distances and probably
947employing high-speed pursuits in some cases. The fauna recorded from the fossiliferous area
948of La Buitrera, where Buitreraptor was discovered, also includes remains of small tetrapods
949such as snakes, sphenodonts, crocodyliforms, and mammals [129–133], which could have
950been potential dams. Buitreraptor would have employed its pes to subjugate and keep the
951prey immobile once it was reached. The fast movements and curved enlarged claw of digit II
952would have helped this function, and eventually causing serious injuries or even death of the
953prey.
954

Another reliable indicator of the type of diet and feeding strategy is the dental

955morphology. The teeth of Buitreraptor are numerous, tiny, lateromedially compressed, and
956devoid of denticles [134]. Instead, eudromaeosaurs are generally characterized by larger
957serrated teeth, such as Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus, Velociraptor, Saurornitholestes, and
958Tsaagan [5–6, 35, 135–137], although many taxa have denticles only on the distal carina.
959These features would have allowed ingesting larger preys or tearing and cutting the flesh from
960them into smaller pieces. Feeding models were proposed for some taxa, such as Deinonychus
961[9], although they are difficult to apply to Buitreraptorbecause the size of their teeth and the
962lack of denticles. Due the latter feature and the absence of other flesh-tearing structures (e.g.,
963the tomial tooth of extant raptorial birds) it is very likely that Buitreraptor has consumed
964whole small animals and that the teeth were mainly employed as a tool to hold the dams. Also

965is possible these teeth have been used to fragment small preys, to consume them in more than
966one swallow. In previous works it has been postulated that the dentition of Buitreraptor
967would indicate a piscivorous feeding mode [134]. Certainly, Microraptor also has small non968serrated teeth and there is evidence that it fed on fishes. However, this unique feature is not a
969reliable indicator of piscivory, since other morphological evidences must be taken into
970account. Moreover, Microraptor included in its diet other animals in addition to fish, as
971mentioned above. Buitreraptor also is characterized by having long forelimbs and hands [4,
97297], so it could also have used them to handle the prey once it was captured and subjugated
973with its feet.
974

Among extant long-legged predominantly terrestrial birds that forage on the ground

975and hunt small preys are included the seriemas (Cariamiformes) and the secretary bird
976(Falconiformes). The secretary bird kicks and stamp on the prey until it is wounded or
977incapacitated and then takes it with its beak [138–140]. On the other hand, the red-legged
978seriema (Cariama cristata) takes the prey with the beak and hits it on the ground with sudden
979movements of the head until it is injured [141]. An interesting trait of this seriema is it has a
980markedly curved ungual phalanx in the second digit ([142–143]; FAG personal observation of
981MACN 23873). Some authors proposed this bird use this claw to hold the prey against the
982ground, although others do not agree ([86], and references therein). The extinct phorusrhacids
983were terrestrial generally flightless carnivorous birds which also are characterized by having a
984markedly developed and curved ungual of the second digit [143–145]. Some authors have
985proposed that this claw could be used as a means of apprehension of the prey on the substrate,
986then using the beak to tear it apart [143]. Buitreraptor could be used its pedal claw in a
987similar way than that proposed for seriemas and phorusrhacids, although there are no direct
988evidences.

989

Regarding other unenlagiines such as Austroraptor it could be proposed a similar

990strategy of hunting and subjection of the dam than that of Buitreraptor. Although
991Austroraptor is significantly larger (estimated total length: 5 m) it has numerous and small
992teeth in comparison with the size of the skull, and also they lack denticles [134, 146–148].
993However, the teeth of Austroraptor are conical, so they probably were more resistant and
994could have employed to retain and dismember large prey. Due to Austroraptor probably had
995similar length proportions of the hindlimb bones than Buitreraptor and a subarctometatarsal
996condition it could have had good cursorial capacities. By other side, Austroraptor has
997strikingly shorter arms than other unenlagiines, so it would not have used them to manipulate
998the prey, or at least not in the same way that Buitreraptor.
999

Rahonavis probably had less cursorial capacities due its hindlimb morphology,

1000although it has a relatively long tibia, so fast chases of preys cannot be ruled out as a hunting
1001strategy used by this taxon. Moreover, Rahonavis has a digit II similar to that of other
1002unenlagiines, so it probably had similar functional capacities. However, the distal phalanges
1003are shorter than in other unenlagiines, so it probably had slightly lesser gripping abilities.
1004Unfortunately cranial remains and teeth of Rahonavis are unknown, so it is more difficult to
1005speculate about the type and size of animals that it could have been preyed upon. Surely it fed
1006on small preys, although is not possible to know if it was able to tear flesh from larger preys.
1007Cranial remains neither were preserved in Neuquenraptor, although the features of its
1008hindlimb indicate that velocity probably was important to obtain its preys. Regarding others
1009unenlagiines, such as Unenlagia comahuensis and Unenlagia paynemili, they have not
1010preserved cranial bones although have preserved scarce hindlimb remains, especially
1011phalanges of digit II, which are much similar to those of the other unenlagiines [101–102,
1012149–150]. So, mainly due to the lack of skull and metatarsus remains and most of pedal
1013phalanges it is more difficult to infer locomotor and predatory habits of these two species.

Conclusions

1016
1017Morphological differences in the hindlimb between unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs reflect
1018differences both in locomotor and predatory habits. In unenlagiines the presence of a long
1019tibia and a long, slender and subarctometatarsal metatarsus suggest greater cursorial capacities
1020with respect to eudromaeosaurs, which have a shorter, wider and non-subarctometatarsal
1021metatarsus. Regarding pedal digits the two groups of dromaeosaurids have similar length
1022proportions and based on the elongation of the distal phalanges they probably have the
1023capacity of grasping. However, morphological features of eudromaeosaurs, i.e., a more robust
1024metatarsus; distal articular surfaces of metatarsal I, II, and III, and interphalangeal articular
1025surfaces markedly ginglymoid; and a shorter phalanx II-1, indicate that these dromaeosaurids
1026possibly exerted more grip strength than unenlagiines. By contrast, proportions and
1027slenderness of unenlagiines would not have allowed them to perform high grasping forces but
1028instead they may have been able to make faster movements with both the metatarsal and the
1029digit II. Moreover, this morphofunctional difference is analogously observed in extant
1030raptorial birds, since in the latter those taxa with the shortest metatarsus, such as owls, have
1031the ability to produce the greatest grip force, whereas those taxa with longer metatarsi, such as
1032polyborine falconiforms, generate a lesser grip force although can effect faster movements
1033with the pes.
1034

Despite the presence of morphological differences of pedal phalanges between

1035unenlagiines and eudromaeosaurs, these discrepancies are not as drastic as those observed
1036between the metatarsus of both dromaeosaurids groups. This, together with the similar length
1037proportions of pedal phalanges seem to indicate that the morphology of these pedal elements

1038varied scarcely along dromaeosaurid evolution, a factor probably related with a greater
1039selective pressure exerted by the predatory function.

Among unenlagiines, Buitreraptor gonzalezorum, with its small size, high cursorial

1040

1041capacities, a long metatarsus and phalanx II-1, more mobile phalanges, and tiny teeth,
1042probably was a terrestrial predator that preyed on small elusive animals, such as arthropods,
1043lizards, mammals, etc., trough rapid movements of its pes. Rahonavis ostromi also was a
1044small-sized unenlagiine, although its morphology seems to indicate it had lesser cursorial
1045abilities. Probably, its small body size and potential capacity of climbing could capacitate it to
1046an arboreal habit. Other unenlagiines, such as the large-sized Austroraptor cabazai and the
1047medium-sized Neuquenraptor argentinus probably preyed on larger animals, also making use
1048of its high cursorial faculties. Regarding other taxa, such as Unenlagia comahuensis and
1049Unenlagia paynemili, are more fragmentary and so is much difficult to infer a locomotor and
1050predatory habit.

Along dromaeosaurid evolution the different lineages seem to have diverged in varied

1051

1052lifestyles, as is documented by unenlagiines, microraptorines, eudromaeosaurs, and recently
1053by halszkaraptorines [11]. Future studies, such as reconstructions of the muscular system, will
1054be necessary to analyze the hindlimb as an osteo-muscular integrated complex and how it
1055would have been involved both in locomotion and depredation in dromaeosaurids. These
1056paleobiological aspects will help us to have a better comprehension of the dromaeosaurid
1057evolutionary story and about the role of these theropods within the ecosystems in which they
1058lived.
