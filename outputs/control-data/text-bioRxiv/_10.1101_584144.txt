Abstract

2

Fed-batch cell culture is the most commonly used process for antibody production in

3

biopharmaceutical industries. Basal media, feed, feeding strategy and glycan structures are always

4

among the most important concerns during process development and optimization. In this study,

5

first, a traditional screening study was performed to identify the top media/feed combinations by

6

evaluating the cell culture performance including cell growth and protein titre. Optimization of the

7

process was also performed using response surface methodology in order to find the most optimum

8

feeding strategy and glucose set point regarding final titre of the recombinant monoclonal antibody

9

being produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The focus of this study is not only on titre, but

10

also on product quality and comparability especially protein glycosylation. The prediction model

11

of product titre as a function of feeding percentage and glucose set point was successfully applied

12

for the second set of experiments that was performed for glycan improvement. Statistical design

13

of experiments was applied to determine the most important factors and their effects on

14

galactosylated and afucosylated glycans. Uridine, manganese, galactose and fucosyltransferase

15

inhibitor were chosen to evaluate if their presence can affect glycans and to obtain their best

16

combination for fed-batch culture supplementation. We determined that 2.5 % daily feeding

17

combined with maintaining the glucose set point on 2.5±0.2 g/L could achieve final titre of 2.5±

18

0.1 g/L. Galactosylation of antibody was increased about 25% using MnCl2 and galactose while

19

afucosylation was increased about 8% in presence of fucosyltransferase inhibitor. Galactose and

20

Mn2+ led to a shift from G0F to G1F and presence of Fucosyltransferase inhibitor caused to an

21

increase in G0 compared to its absence. These results demonstrated that supplementation of culture

22

with all these components can provide exact control of antibody galactosylation and fucosylation

23

with minimal impact on culture characteristics and product quality attributes. Subsequently,

24

validation experiments were also carried out in 5L STR bioreactors which showed that similar

25

results could be achieved in bioreactors compared to shake flasks regarding both titre and quality.

Introduction

37

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become famous therapeutic agents in treatment of

38

cancer, inflammatory, respiratory and infectious diseases. For mAb based therapies, typically, high

39

doses in the range of hundreds of milligrams to a gram are needed per dose for achieving the

40

favored therapeutic effect. In addition, high doses of antibodies are required over a long period of

41

time, which requires large amounts of purified protein. Manufacturing capacity and cell line

42

productivity are among most important factors that can affect the cost and efficacy of drug

43

substance production (1). Therefore, increasing the productivity of antibody-producing cells in

44

biopharmaceutical industries to meet the market demand is a real challenge (2).

45

Most monoclonal antibodies production platforms are based on firmly established fed-

46

batch culture mode due to its ease of scale up and compatibility with large scale manufacturing of

47

up to thousands of litres. The volumetric productivity of such cultures was typically improved

48

from 50 mg/L/d in 1990s to about more than 200 mg/L/d at present (3). Basal and feed media are

49

two components of fed-batch process that caused to cell growth and production, respectively by

50

providing essential nutrients during the batch. For fed-batch mode, a sequential approach is

51

conventionally used in which an optimal basal media is first chosen according to the growth

52

characteristics of the cell line and quality attributes of the protein being produced. In next step a

53

feed medium is also optimized regarding the type of feed and the feeding strategy in a way to

54

provide the highest titre while maintaining the critical quality attributes in their acceptable range

55

(4).

56

Traditional and statistical methods can be used for efficient selection of cell culture

57

media/feeds combination and feeding strategy optimization. Traditional methods are costly and

58

time consuming and do not seem favorable for biopharmaceutical companies which are looking

59

forward to reduce time to market. Nowadays, approaches that combine high-throughput screening

60

platforms with statistical design of experiment (DOE) such as factorial design and response surface

61

methodology (RSM) are commonly used in biopharmaceutical companies to reduce the bioprocess

62

development time and cost in Research and Development units (5). Factorial designs are used in

63

order to find impact of several factors on a single response. However, RSM allows to achieve the

64

most optimum response with selected factors.

65

Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications and critical

66

quality attributes of therapeutic glycoproteins including monoclonal antibodies. These glycan

67

chains on Fc region of mAbs are essential for their efficacy, stability and immune effector

68

functions i.e. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent

69

cytotoxicity (CDC) (6). In particular, afucosylation and galactosylation play critical roles in ADCC

70

and CDC, respectively (7). Additionally, during the development of a biosimilar drug product, it

71

is essential to completely demonstrate similarity in both therapeutics regarding their critical quality

72

attributes (CQAs). Similarity of the quality attributes between both innovator and biosimilar

73

products should be proven before the new drugs entered to the market (8). Monoclonal antibody

74

glycosylation can be modulated using various commercial products that were designed to enhance

75

glycosylation. Among these additives, EX-CELL Glycosylation Adjust supplement (Gal+)

76

(MilliporeSigma) has been shown effectivee3 results regarding enhanced glycosylation (9).

77

In this study, according to the interrelated behavior of feed and media on cell culture

78

process parameters, combined optimization of basal and feed media was performed in order to

79

develop a process that results in highest productivity of a CHO cell line producing an anti-HER2

80

IgG1 monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab biosimilar). After finding the best basal/feed combination

81

through conventional media/feed selection strategies, RSM methodology was used for finding the

82

optimum level of feed and glucose set point for achieving the highest titre of the monoclonal

83

antibody. Another important aim of this study was fine tuning of the culture composition through

84

supplementation of nucleotide sugar precursors and glycosyltransferase enzymes cofactors or

85

inhibitors to optimize galactosylated and afucosylated content of the antibody being produced. For

86

increasing antibodies with decreased amount of fucosylation i.e. afucosylation, a

87

fucosyltransferase inhibitor 2F-peracetyl-fucose was used (10). In order to increase the level of

88

galactosylated forms, three factors that were expected to potentially enhance intracellular

89

galactosylation, namely galactose, uridine and Mn2+ were supplemented to the culture. Galactose

90

and uridine are the main components for production of UDP-gal (a nucleotide sugar precursor that

91

is added to the oligosaccharide moieties being present on Fc region of antibodies) while Mn2+ is

92

the cofactor of galactosyltransferase enzyme that adds galactose residue to the glycan chains (11).

93

The optimum concentration of all these supplements added to culture for improving glycosylation

94

were fine-tuned by performing experiments that were designed through Full Factorial design of

95

experiments. Finally, the models were further verified by performing a series of experiments in

96

pre-determined optimum conditions predicted by the models.

The CHO cell line producing trastuzumab biosimilar was kindly provided by AryoGen

100

Pharmed Inc. (Alborz, Iran). This cell line was derived from CHO-S cells (Gibco, Catalog No.

101

A11364). In order to find the best combination of basal media and feed that could result in optimum

102

cell growth, and protein productivity, fed-batch cultures were performed by using commercially

103

available basal/feed media combinations. Cell growth characteristics and protein titre were

104

compared in six fed-batch culture conditions with different basal/feed combinations. Three

105

chemically defined basal media were compared being: 1. CD1, 2. CD2 and 3. CD3 media, with

106

media 1, 2 purchased from (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) and medium 3 purchased from UGA

107

Biopharma GmbH (UGA, Hennigsdorf, Germany). Two chemically defined feed systems were

108

used in combination with three basal media mentioned above and compared. The feed systems

109

used include: 1. FC from Life Technologies; and 2. FA and FB from GE Healthcare. Glucose

110

concentrations of FC and FA was about 30 and 80 g/L, respectively. Media and feed solutions and

111

supplements were all prepared according to manufacturer’s protocols. All cultures contain 0.1%

116

of 100 ml in 500 ml shake flasks with the same initial cell density. Cells were incubated in an

117

incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C on orbital shaker with 100 rpm shaking speed and 30 mm orbital

118

shaking diameter. In all culture conditions feeding was started on 2nd day of culture with a daily

dropped below 70%, which one occurred earlier.

Integrated medium and feeding strategy optimization

125

In a typical fed-batch culture, the basal medium usually supports cell growth, while the

126

feed medium contributes in increasing the productivity. After determining the top basal media/feed

127

combination, the next development phase was started to improve the feeding strategy in order to

128

fine tune the batch duration combined with final expression. To optimize the feeding strategy, two

129

independent variables of feed percent (factor A) and glucose set point (factor B) were chosen to

130

see their effect on protein titre (response). The effect of these two parameters on titre response was

131

analyzed by standard response surface methodology (RSM) design called central composite design

132

(CCD). RSM statistical method is suitable for optimization of the process parameters with a

133

minimum number of experiments, as well as finding the quadratic and interaction effects between

134

factors. Minitab version 17 (Minitab, Inc.) was used to design the experiments. Each factor was

135

coded as -1 (low level), 0 (center point) and +1 (high level) and their uncoded values are

136

represented in Table 2. These two factors were chosen since their influence on culture

137

characteristics were known according to our previous knowledge. Central composite design with

138

a total of 13 experiments was used to obtain a quadratic model. The experimental run was

139

randomized in order to omit the error and effect of the uncontrolled factors. The experiments being

140

performed with center point values were repeated five times in order to have a good estimation of

141

the experimental error. The model terms with p-value > 0.05 (if present) were removed in order to

142

obtain a model with more adequacy.

146

Experimental data was generated according to a 24 factorial design. Full factorial design

147

was chosen in order to include all possible combinations of factors at selected levels. The factors

148

and their high and low limit ranges were MnCl2 (Sigma, life science) (0-40 µM), galactose

149

(Applichem, USA) (0-50 mM), Uridine (Sigma, life science) (0-4 mM), fucosyltransferase

150

inhibitor 2F-peracetyl-Fucose (merck, calbiochem) (0-30 µM). Uridine was supplemented on days

151

6 and 8 of the culture while, MnCl2, galactose and fucosyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) were added

152

to basal media prior to inoculation of cells. CHO cells were cultured in 500 ml shake flasks with

153

an effective volume of 100 ml, incubated at 37 °C with a 5% CO2, and agitated at 80 rpm. Each

154

shake flask was inoculated with an approximate cell density of 0.6 ± 0.05×106 cells/ml. All

155

experiments were performed with CD3 media and FA, FB feeds. Feeding strategy was set on 2.5%

156

FA and 0.25% FB starting from day 2 till day 14 of the batch. Furthermore, glucose (Merck,

157

Germany) was supplemented to keep on 2.5 ±0.2 g/L using 400 g/L glucose stock solution. Cell

158

density, viability, pH and lactate were measured daily. Protein titre was also measured on days 3,

159

5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 of the batches using Protein A HPLC method. All the conditions were

160

harvested on 15th day of the batch and were purified using MabSelect SuRe LX resin. Glycan

161

analysis was performed and the data set was used for analyzing the factorial design in Minitab

162

software. Three responses considered for this experimental design included: final titre (mg/L),

163

Sum of oligosaccharides with galactose and without fucose. Total of 17 runs were designed using

164

general full factorial design considering one center point for each factor being tested. Factor

165

coefficients and p-values were determined after analyzing the design using ANOVA.

166

Cell density and viability determinations:

167

Sampling of cultures were performed daily by taking 1 ml sample from each shake flask.

168

Cell density and cell viability were determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay using a Neubauer

169

cytometer. Glucose and lactate concentrations were measured daily with a BioProfile Analyzer

170

400 (Nova Biomedical, Barcelona, Spain).

171

Monoclonal antibody quantification

172

The concentration of the monoclonal antibody in cell culture supernatant samples was

173

determined by the Mab Pac protein A affinity column (Thermo scientific, CA, USA). Two buffer

174

solutions were used for HPLC test. The equilibration buffer or mobile phase A (50 mM PBS, 150

175

mM sodium chloride, (Merck, Germany) and 5% acetonitrile (Merck, Germany) pH 7.5. The

176

mobile phase B was the same as mobile phase A buffer, with the only difference that pH of this

177

solution was adjusted on 2.5 by Orthophosphoric acid. The elution gradient was programmed from

178

0% to 100% of elution buffer B in approximately 5 min. The standard curve generated with the

179

purified monoclonal IgG with predefined concentrations and the mAb quantification was

180

performed based on this curve.

181

Antibody purification

182

Product quality assays were performed on samples purified by Protein A chromatography

183

using MabSelect SuRe LX resin (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK). The column was equilibrated

184

in a citrate/sodium chloride buffer at pH 7. Cold, clarified bioreactor supernatant samples were

185

loaded directly onto the column, washed with citrate/sodium chloride buffer at pH 7, eluted in

186

citrate buffer at pH 3.5, and neutralized using a Tris buffer.

187

Glycan analysis

188

N-linked glycans were released from purified antibody samples by overnight incubation

189

with N-Glyccosidase F (Prozyme, GKE-5006B). The proteins were removed using LudgerClean

190

glycan EB-10 cartridges (Ludger, Oxfordshire, UK). The oligosaccharides were labeled with the

191

fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) using Ludger 2-AB (2-Aminobenzamide) glycan labeling

192

kit (Cat No. LT-KAB-A2). The excess 2AB fluorophore was removed using LudgerClean S glycan

193

cleanup cartridges. 2-AB Labeled glycans were eluted from the cartridges using ultra purified

194

water (UPW) and were incubated in 5 °C for 24 h. The samples were then resuspended using 80%

195

Acetonitrile solution and a sample was injected in to ACQUITY UPLC Glycan BEH Amide 1.7

µm (2.1×150 mm) Column equilibrated in Acetonitrile and eluted with a gradient of 100 mM

197

Ammonium formate pH 4.5 ± 0.1. The two mobile phases used were solvent A (0.1 M Ammonium

198

formate pH 4.5 ± 0.1) and solvent B (Acetonitrile). Elution of the sample was performed while

199

Fluorescence was set at Ex = 330 nm and Em = 420 nm. The peaks that are present in the UPLC

200

chromatogram of Herceptin biosimilar as well as innovator drug are as follows: G0FGN, G0, G0F,

201

Man5, G1, G1F, G1F' and G2F. The amount of each structure is expressed as the percentage of

202

total peak area. The amount of galactosylated structures is the sum of G1, G1F, G1F' and G2F

203

peaks, while the afucosylated population is the sum of G0 and G1 peaks area. Man5 structure is

204

the only structure that represents the amount of oligosaccharides with mannose.

205

Validation and verification of the models

206

Both experimental designs were verified by performing 5 runs in 5-L STR bioreactors in

207

order to demonstrate the validity and predictive ability of both models obtained in this study. The

208

culture process in bioreactors started by inoculation of 0.6 ±0.05 ×106 cells/ml using the same

209

media/feed used in small scale experiments. Because uridine addition resulted in low viability

210

followed by low titre even in its lowest concentration of 2 mM, it was excluded from these set of

211

experiments. Manganese, galactose and FTI were added to concentrations of 25 µM, 40 mM and

212

15 µM of total culture volume, respectively. Agitation speed and DO set point were set on 190

213

rpm and 50%, respectively. 2.6% FA and 0.26% FB were added daily from day 2 till day 14 of the

214

batch. Glucose was also supplemented to the culture, daily in order to maintain its concentration

215

about 2.5± 0.2 g/L. All the cultures were stopped on 15th day of the batch.

Media and feed selection

218

Fed batch culture is currently the most common industrial process for CHO cell culture.

219

The aim of fed-batch experiments was to determine the best combination of media/feed that results

220

in the highly optimized viable cell density (VCD), titre and culture longevity (12). Therefore, cell

221

density, viability, final titre and glucose concentration of all studied conditions were compared as

222

represented in Figure 1. The different media and feed combinations that were used in the fed-batch

223

cultures are depicted in Table 1.

224

CD3 media/FA and FB combination resulted in highest cell density and cell specific

225

productivity of ~16×106 cells/ml and 8.9 pg/cell/day, respectively. In all three basal media used in

226

this experiment, higher cell and antibody concentrations were obtained when FA and FB feeds

227

were used compared to FC. It has been previously shown that FA and FB are richer than FC both

228

in amino acids and glucose concentration (12). Among basal media used in this experiment, CD2

229

media resulted in the lowest cell density and final titre irrespective of the feeds that have been

230

used. Otherwise, CD3 media resulted in final titre of 1400 mg/L that was about 2.3 fold higher

231

than CD1, while there was not a significant difference between the cell densities of these two

232

media. Altogether, CD3 media combined with FA and FB feeds were chosen for subsequent

233

experiments on feeding strategy improvement.

240

As can be seen in Figure 1.B in both CD1 and CD3 media fed with FA and FB feeds, the

241

viability started to drop from day 10 of the batch. Considering daily glucose concentration of these

242

conditions (Figure 1.D), it can be excluded that viability drop may started when glucose level

243

became lower than 1 g/L. This phenomenon also happened when both media were fed with FC

244

feed with the only difference that glucose depletion started earlier (about day 5).

245

According to the observed results, early viability drop, which coincided with glucose

246

depletion, implies that 1 g/L glucose is a critical limitation concentration for this certain cell line.

247

This result is in agreement with the report suggested using glucose feed in fed-batch process

248

because cells at high density affected by glucose availability (13). In addition, since in these

249

experiments a fixed 2% daily feed was added to the culture, this decreased glucose concentration

250

may reflect the depletion of other nutrients especially amino acids in cultures. Moreover, at time

251

of viability drop the concentrations of both lactate and ammonia were below their inhibition level

252

reported in literature (14).

253

One of the most efficient feeding strategies is glucose-based feeding. This strategy

254

although can help to maintain glucose levels during the batch but can be problematic due to

255

accumulation or depletion of certain amino acids (12, 15, 16). Meanwhile once-daily feeding

256

strategy cannot ensure that glucose level is being held near the set points pre-defined (13). Based

257

on these results, the decision was made to use fixed feeding strategy while increasing the total

258

amount of daily feed added to the culture. Simultaneously, glucose stock solution of 400 g/L was

259

also used to bring glucose concentration to a level that prevents depletion before the next bolus

260

feed. For this purpose, different glucose set points were also included in the experiments in order

261

to investigate whether this cell line is sensitive to glucose levels or not.

262

Integrated medium and feeding strategy optimization

263

Improvement of cell growth and titre, requires media/feed combinations screening

264

followed by feeding strategy optimization. After choosing CD3 as basal and FA & FB as feeds,

265

RSM design was used to investigate the influence of different feed percentages and glucose set

266

points on productivity of cells. For this purpose, different fixed amount of daily feeds were

267

considered (Table 2). In addition, glucose was fed daily according to the glucose concentration at

268

the moment of feeding and the anticipated glucose uptake rate for the next 24 h. By this method

269

the glucose was held within a pre-determined set point irrespective of the amount of feed added

270

daily. Table 4 shows the final titre of the 13 generated experimental runs after execution.

271

The results showed that the max VCC (viable cell count) of 16.5 ± 0.5 ×106 cells/ml was

272

achieved in all experiments. In conditions that Glucose concentration was maintained on 4 g/L,

273

the highest lactate level (50-55 mM), lowest titre (950 ± 250 mg/L) and batch duration (12 days)

274

were observed. It has been previously shown that by increasing the glucose concentration in fed

275

batch mode cultures, higher lactate was produced which indirectly can cause inhibitory effects on

276

growth and productivity (13, 15, 17).

277

When the glucose concentration of culture was decreased to both 2 and 3 g/L, the lactate

278

consumption was observed after day 4 of the batch and lactate concentration was remained below

279

10 mM for the rest of the batch. This lower lactate level lead to extended batch duration of 3-days

280

and increased final titre of 2 to 2.5 fold compared to high glucose set point limit of 4 g/L.

281

In glucose set point of 2 g/L, the final titre increased about 1.4 fold when feed percentage

282

increased from 2% to 2.5 and 3%. It highlights the effect of other nutrients increment in

283

productivity of the culture. In addition, the results also revealed that when cultures are fed using

284

lower amounts of feed (2% daily), increasing the glucose set point level could not significantly

285

affect the final titre. The lower titre seems to be dependent more on other nutrients especially

286

amino acids rather than glucose. When considering the effect of both feeding percentage and

287

glucose set point, the results confirmed that they are in close relationship. The highest final titre

288

of 2.5 ± 0.1 g/L was observed in conditions that were supplemented with 2.5 % daily feed while

289

their glucose set point was adjusted on 3 g/L.

290

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results and the proposed model for the final mAb titre

291

response is expressed as an empirical two order polynomial equation in terms of two variables (A:

292

feed percent and B: glucose set point) in Table 5. The larger F-value and the smaller p-value,

293

show more significant of the corresponding coefficient. The F-value of 51.38 indicates that the

294

model is significant. Additionally, in this model feed percent and glucose set point (A and B) linear

295

effects and quadratic effects (A2 and B2) are significant model terms due to their P-value which is

296

lower than 0.05. Besides, interaction between feed percent and glucose set point has also

297

significant effect on protein titre. In addition, the lack of fit p-value (0.065), also suggests that the

298

model can be used as a prediction tool.

The analysis of adjusted and predicted coefficients of determination (R2-values) which

300

should be more than 60 indicates that titre response can be easily described with the model being

301

created. (18) Adjusted R2 is an indicator of how well the experimental results fit the model while

302

the predicted R2 indicates the prediction potential of the model regarding future experiments.

Regression analysis shows that the model being built for titre response have adequately high

308

As can be seen in Table 4, increasing the feed percentage from 2.5% to 3% when glucose

309

set point is on 2 g/L had no significant effect on titre. However in the same scenario when glucose

310

set point was adjusted on 3 g/L, final titre was decreased. Lower titre may be due to the

311

accumulation of specific amino acids which showed inhibitory effect on final productivity.

312

The results from this experiment shed light in the feeding strategy based on glucose set

point for the fed-batch culture of the cell line used in this study. According to the variables

coefficients of the model acquired from RSM, main (B) and quadratic (B2) effects of glucose set

point are the most important parameters affecting the final titre. The other factors can be

A*B (interaction effect of feed and glucose set point). This is mainly due to the decreased

318

productivity that has been occurred when increasing the glucose set point to 4 g/L in all conditions

319

irrespective of the amount of feed added. It can be concluded from contour plot (Fig. 2) that regions

320

of increased titre occurred in regions of sufficient amino acids feed (more than 2.5%) with glucose

321

set point of 2.5 ± 0.5 g/L. Senger et al. were also reported that by increasing the glucose set point

322

to values more than 3 g/L especially when the cells were in lack of amino acids, the productivity

323

of r-tPA was decreased (19).

Experimental designs regarding glycan variation

329

In order to improve the glycan structure of trastuzumab biosimilar monoclonal antibody

330

regarding its glycosimilarity with Herceptin originator drug, a set of experiments were designed

331

for increasing the galactosylated and afucosylated glycan structures. Sum of galactosylated and

332

afucosylated oligosacharides in originator drug is usually between 32-35% and 5-9% of total

333

glycan structures.

334

Galactosylation of Fc region in monoclonal antibodies can affect their complement

335

dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) machanism of action (20, 21). Galactosylation can drop over the

336

course of culture due to reduced intracellular biosynthesis. Inside the cells Uridine triphosphate

337

(UTP) and galactose-1-phosphate react to each other to produce UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) that is

338

the building block of the galactose in oligosacharide chains. The enzyme galactosyltransferase add

339

UDP-gal to the sugar chain and Manganese (Mn2+) is the cofactor of this enzyme which helps it to

340

improve its performance. Supplementation of Uridine, manganese and galactose can lead to

341

increased level of UDP-gal that can cause to an increase in galactosylated glycan structures of

342

monoclonal antibodies (11, 22).

343

Another important Fc-mediated immune effector function that plays the most important

344

role in depleting tumor cells is called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). It has

345

been proved previously that the absence of core fucose on Fc N-glycan structures can lead to

346

enhanced ADCC activity (23, 24). It has also been confirmed that apart from afucosylation,

347

galactosylation levels could also influence ADCC activity; however, the role of afucosylation is

348

more prominent. (25)

349

Different glycan engineering strategies were used for the purpose of improving the

350

performance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies through their effector functions (both ADCC

351

and CDC) (26). Supplementation of the media with one of the components involved in

352

galactosylation of monoclonal antibodies namely, uridine (U), mangannese (M) and galactose (G)

353

have provided remarkable results ragarding increased protein oligosacharide galactose content

354

(27-29). Other researchers also demonstrated that adding a mixture of galactose, manganese

355

chloride (MnCl2), and uridine to cell culture medium can alter the glycosylation of monoclonal

356

antibodies (11, 22, 30-32).

357

Different technologies were also applied for reduction of core fucosylation in therapeutic

358

monoclonal antibodies. These include: use of cell lines with inherent reduced capacity for

359

incorporation of fucose (33) and generation of completely non-fucosylated antibodies in cells that

360

were genetically enginered in their FUT8 gene encoding the α1,6-fucosyltransferase (34). The

361

most straight forward approach that can easily be applied in biopharmaceutical companies is

362

supplementation of media with Fucosyltransferase inhibitors such as 2F-peracetyl-fucose (10).

363

Given the possibilities discussed above, for improving glycosylation of antibody,

364

combined effect of four factors that can be expected to potentially enhance simultaneously both

365

galactosylation and afucosylation, namely U, M, G and FTI were considered. High and low limits

366

were set for all these factors according to literature and our preliminary studies regarding this

367

antibody. Full factorial design of experiments was used in order to find the most effective factors

368

and also their optimum concentration. This method of DOE was used since it was important to

369

study the impact of several factors on a response simultaneously (35).

370

The low and high limit of uridine concentration was set on 0 and 4 mM. These

371

concentrations were chosen based on literature reports and subsequently preliminary experiments

372

which showed that cell viability and final titre were remarkably droped when 8 mM uridine was

373

added to culture (data was not shown). Although 4 mM uridine was resulted in lower titre

374

compared to the conditions without this supplement, but in order to check the interaction effect

375

(mainly synergystic effect) of this supplement with manganese and galactose this concentration

376

was considered as the high level in our experiments. Gramer et al. reported that galactose was

377

started to accumulate in culture when it was more than 40 mM (in condition with 8X concentration

378

of UMG). They also confirmed cultures supplemented with 8 mM uridine, 16 µM Mn2+ and 40

379

mM galactose reached to a plateau in their galactosylation level (11). Based on their report and

380

according to our prior knowledge, galactose higher limit was set to 50 mM in our experimental

381

design. The high limit of Mn2+ concentration was chosen according to the patent No.

382

US20170107551A1 in which they reported that 40 µM manganese concentration resulted in the

383

most optimum galactosylated level in shake flasks (36). David T.Ho et al. results represented that

384

using 100 µM FTI resulted in 67% decrease in afucosylation level (10). Besides, in preliminary

385

experiments with FTI supplement, it was observed that adding 50 µM FTI in culture resulted in a

386

decreased fucosylation level from 97 ±1% (in absence of FTI) to 85 ±1 %. According to this

387

experiment, the decision was made to consider 0 and 30 µM FTI concentrations as the lowest and

388

highest level for FTI factor for finding its omptimum concentration.

389

When galactose was added to culture with concentration of 50 mM it could increase the

390

galactosylated glycans about 8% in absence of both Mn2+ and Uridine supplements (Fig 3). About

391

11% increase in galactosylation level was also reported when 20 mM galactose was added to CHO

392

fed-batch cultures (37).

393

Addition of 4 mM uridine to the culture containing 50 mM galactose couldn’t further

394

increase the level of galactosylation. Furtheremore in presence of 4 mM uridine lower cell density

395

was observed followed by lower final titre of 1.5 ±0.2 g/L compared to the titre of about 2.5 g/L

396

in absence of uridine. It was in contrast to Gramer et al. reports in which they showed that addition

397

of uridine up to 16 mM had no effect on productivity reduction (11). Our results indicated that

398

addition of Mn2+ led to increased protein oligosacharide galactose content from 22±0.5% (in

399

absence of Mn2+ and presence of galactose) to 30±2% (in absence of galactose) and to 40±2% (in

400

presence of either 25 or 50 mM galactose).

401

The overall increase in galactosylation was primarily due to a drop in G0F content with a

402

related increase in G1F and G1F' and secondarily to a slight increase in G2F (Table 7). As can be

403

seen in Table 5 the G0F content of the monoclonal antibody was about 70% in absence of Mn2+

404

and decreased to 48% and 58% in presence of 20 and 40 µM Mn2+, respectively. G1F glycan

405

structures was increased from 9% ( in absence of Mn2+ and galactose) to 14.5 ± 0.5% ( in absence

406

of Mn2+ and presence of galactose) and to 25 ± 1% ( in presence of both Mn2+ and galactose). The

407

trend of increase in G1F' structures was exactly similar to the G1F glycans with the only difference

408

that the increase in these oligosacharides were happened with lower slope. This is in total

409

agreement with the results expained by Roger Anderson et al., in which they claimed that

410

galactosylation of glycan structures preferentially occures more on the glycans α1,6 than α1,3 arm

411

(38). G2F glycans were only increased about 3 ±0.5% when both Mn2+ and galactose were

412

supplemented in cultures while there was no change in these glycans when either Mn2+ or galactose

413

were present.

414

The equations of the models and the main effect plots (derived in Minitab) for all three

415

responses are shown in Table 6 and Figure 4, respectively. These models were fitted by omitting

416

unsignificant terms based on their p-values (>0.05). All three responses have linear relationships

417

with their effective factors. As represented in Table 6, the models gained from factorial design

418

analysis also revealed that the percentage of galactosylated glycans was mostly dependent on

419

MnCl2 followed by galactose concentrations with coefficients of 0.37 and 0.14, respectively. The

420

results obtained were completely in agreement with Crowell et al. study in which they represented

421

that addition of Mn2+ alone can lead to increased protein oligosacharide content (29). The negative

422

coefficient of uridine concentration in titre response also revealed that its presence in culture

423

negatively affect the productivity of the cell line used in this study.

424
425

Fig 3. Titre and galactosylation level of different experimental runs with different
concentrations of UMG. The data are represented as mean ± SD.

426

In the context of afucosylation, our results confirmed that using FTI as a fucosyltransferase

427

inhibitor we could increase the afucosylated glycan structures of trastuzumab biosimilar about 8%.

428

This increase in afucosylated structures was similar in both FTI concentrations (15 and 30 µM)

429

that were used in our experiments. Interestingly, it can also be concluded from the results that the

430

increase in afucosylated structures happened irrespective of the presence of other three

431

supplements used for galactosylation improvement. Furtheremore, supplementation of the

432

inhibitor to the culture had not influenced culture parameters in terms of viable cell density and

433

productivity, exactly the same as David T.Ho results (10). Figure 4 also confirmed that FTI

434

supplement is the only factor that is responsible for increasing the afucosylated glycans level. The

435

main increase in afucosylated glycan content was due to the increase in G0 content of

436

oligosacharides being present in trastuzumab biosimilar drug which was increased from about 2 ±

437

1% in conditions without FTI to 8 ± 1% and 9.5 ± 1% in presence of 15 and 30 µM FTI,

438

respectively.

439

It also should be noted that afucosylation was slightly increased from 1.8 ±0.2% (in absence

440

of uridine) to 3.5 ± 1% ( in presence of 4 mM uridine). Nevertheless, in presence of uridine even

441

in its lowest amount (2 mM), lower titre was observed compared to absence of this supplement.

442

Gramer et al. also reported that the fucosylation of their antibody encountered with a slight drop

443

from 97% to 94% in 0 and 20 mM uridine (11). The main effect plot (Fig. 4A) also shows that the

444

most significant of the investigated parameters which affects titre was uridine concentration. In

445

addition negative coefficient of uridine concentration in titre response equation indicates that it

446

negatively affects titre. Due to this negative impact on culture behaviour and according to its

447

negligible effect on afucosylation glycan level, the decision was made not to supplement this factor

448

in future cultures. The supplementation of U, M and G supplements neither affected Man 5 nor

449

fucosylated glycan content. Besides, other quality attributes of the protein have not been affected

450

by supplementing the fed-batch cultures with all these four supplements.

Our results pointed out that control on the amount of both galactosylation and afucosylation

460

content of monoclonal antibodies being produced in CHO cell lines can be achieved by

461

supplementing the culture simultaneously with UMG and FTI. Taken together, these experiments

462

suggests that the highly optimized concentration of Mn2+, galactose and FTI for simultaneously

463

controlling both the galactosylation and afucosylation level of glycan structures were 20 µM and

464

25 mM, and 15 µM, respectively. Furthermore, supplementing the cultures with all these

466

attributes of the protein regarding its comparability with originator drug.

467

Verification and validation of models

468

For demonstrating the predictive ability of both RSM and factorial designs obtained

469

respectively for feeding strategy and glycan improvement, a set of experiments were performed

470

with the optimum level of the factors acquired from response optimizer of Minitab software. The

471

feeding strategy and supplementation patterns used in verification experiments are represented in

472

Table 8. The verification process generated experimental results close to the predicted response

473

(p-value < 0.05) as represented in Table 9. Our optimized feeding strategy combined with glucose,

474

galactose, MnCl2 and FTI supplementation resulted in mean expression of 2510 ± 65 mg/L.

475

Simultaneously the level of galactosylation and afucosylation were also increased to 32.5 ± 0.6 %

476

and 7.3 ± 0.5 %, respectively which were completely comparable to Herceptin originator drug.

477

The good agreement between the experimental and predicted results verifies the validity of the

478

models.

Conclusion

485

The focus of this study is not only on improving the process titre but also on product quality

486

and comparability. The aim of this study regarding process yield was to investigate the effects of

487

different basal media and feeds on cell culture performance and mAb production. The highest mAb

488

titre (1.4 g/L) was obtained with CD3 basal medium and FA and FB feeds. In next phase of

489

development, the feeding strategy was optimized through high throughput response surface

490

methodology which resulted in a fixed feeding strategy on a daily basis while controlling the

491

glucose level of culture (more than 2 g/L on the next day of culture). By operating with a feed and

492

glucose control, higher titre of about 2.5 ± 0.1 g/L were achieved. The feeding strategy that was

493

developed was beneficial to our company since it was easy to implement this strategy both in lab-

494

scale and in manufacturing. Another goal of this study regarding product quality was achieved

495

through supplementation of culture with glycan structures precursors or glycosyltransferase

496

enzymes regulators. Although the glycan structures regulation can be achieved using commercial

497

available supplements such as EX-CELL Glycosylation Adjust which enables the desired N-linked

498

glycosylation, combination of supplements have been chosen to be investigated that can not only

499

modulate glycan structures but also can be cost beneficial when used as a cocktail in large scale

500

production. To achieve this, full factorial design of experiments were included to find the effect of

501

UMG and FTI supplements on titre, galactosylation, and afucosylation content of trastuzumab

502

biosimilar drug. Among supplements used, the best combination achieved was 25 µM Mn2+, 40

503

mM galactose and 15 µM FTI. These supplements resulted in galactosylation level of more than

504

30% and afucosylation of 5-9% which is completely similar to its originator. To our knowledge,

505

this study is the first report regarding the application of both afucosylation and galactosylation

506

improving supplements for glycan engineering of pharmaceutical proteins. This work provided a

507

methodology that can be used for media and process development studies. Future studies might

508

involve adding these supplements at different time points during culture to determine and specify

509

the best time for their supplementation.
