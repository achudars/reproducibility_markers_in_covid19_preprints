Abstract

The dopaminergic midbrain is associated with elementary brain functions, such as reward processing,
reinforcement learning, motivation and decision-making that are often disturbed in neuropsychiatric
disease. Previous research has shown that activity in the dopaminergic midbrain can be endogenously
modulated via neurofeedback, suggesting potential for non-pharmacological interventions. However,
the robustness of endogenous modulation, a requirement for clinical translation, is unclear. Here, we
used non-invasive modulation of the dopaminergic midbrain activity by real-time neurofeedback to
examine how self-modulation capability affects transfer and correlated activation across the brain. In
addition, to further elucidate potential mechanisms underlying successful self-regulation, we studied
individual prediction error coding during neurofeedback training, and, during a completely
independent monetary incentive delay (MID) task, individual reward sensitivity. Fifty-nine participants
underwent neurofeedback training either in a veridical or inverted feedback group. Post-training
activity within the cognitive control network was increased only in those individuals with successful
self-regulation of the dopaminergic midbrain during neurofeedback training. Successful learning to
regulate was accompanied by decreasing prefrontal prediction error signals and increased prefrontal
reward sensitivity in the MID task. Our findings suggest that the cognitive control network contributes
to successful transfer of the capability to upregulate the dopaminergic midbrain. The link of
dopaminergic self-regulation with individual differences in prefrontal prediction error and reward
sensitivity indicates that reinforcement learning contributes to successful top-down control of the
midbrain. Our findings therefore provide new insights in the cognitive control of dopaminergic
midbrain activity and pave the way to improving neurofeedback training in neuropsychiatric patients.

1 Introduction

2

The dopaminergic midbrain, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), plays

3

a crucial role in reward processing, reinforcement learning (Schultz, 2016, 1998; Tobler et al., 2007),

4

motivation (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010; Wise, 2004), and decision-making (Friston et al., 2014).

5

Dysfunctions of the reward system have far-reaching consequences and are associated with the

6

development of several severe psychiatric disease such as addiction (Huys et al., 2014) and

7

schizophrenia (Deserno et al., 2016; Maia and Frank, 2017). Despite decades of extensive neuroscience

8

and imaging studies which have contributed to an impressive body of knowledge of normal and

9

abnormal reward system function, the neural mechanisms controlling midbrain activity are still not

10

fully understood (Meder et al., 2019). One key issue that has received increasing attention over the

11

last years is whether humans are able to cognitively control brain activity within the reward system.

12

Although the mechanisms remained unclear, it has already been shown that both healthy controls

13

(MacInnes et al., 2016; Sulzer et al., 2013b), and patients with cocaine addiction (Kirschner et al.,

14

2018c) can learn to regulate SN/VTA activity during real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging

15

(rt-fMRI) neurofeedback training. Yet, only little or no behavioral changes or increases in neural activity

16

have been found so far to transfer beyond neurofeedback training, even though transfer, i.e., the

17

ability to regulate activity also after training and without feedback is critical for clinical applications in

18

disorders with reward system dysfunctions (Klein et al., 2019). The question therefore arises how

19

individuals with successful transfer effects differ from individuals without transfer effects and what

20

mechanisms underpin transfer effects. We narrowed this gap by combining data from two previous rt-

21

fMRI studies (Kirschner et al., 2018c; Sulzer et al., 2013b) and pursuing three aims.

22

(1) Our first goal was to characterize individual differences in transfer effects between

23

‘regulators’ and ‘non-regulators’ in the context of SN/VTA self-regulation. Individual differences in

24

regulation success and high variability of transfer effects arises also in other neurofeedback modalities

25

such as electroencephalography (EEG) and are often neglected (Alkoby et al., 2018). For rt-fMRI

26

neurofeedback control, neural activity in the cognitive (or executive) control network may play an

27

important role especially when performing a demanding task such as imagery (Sitaram et al., 2016).

28

Therefore, and based on the known direct and indirect connections between prefrontal cortex and

29

SN/VTA (Frankle et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2007; Sesack et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2013) we hypothesize that

30

successful transfer of SN/VTA regulation is associated with activation in brain regions that are part of

31

the cognitive (executive) control network, especially prefrontal areas.

32

(2) Our second goal was to determine whether mechanisms of (operant) associative learning

33

can be used to explain neurofeedback training. In the associative learning framework of neurofeedback

34

(Birbaumer et al., 2013; Sitaram et al., 2016), the chosen mental strategy is reinforced in proportion

35

to the sign and magnitude of the feedback. If the feedback signal increases, reflecting a desired

36

increase in brain activity within the target region, participants receive more reward than predicted

37

corresponding to a positive prediction error. As a consequence, they would be more likely to repeat

38

the strategy, expect higher feedback next time and gradually learn how to keep the feedback signal

39

high. Accordingly, in regulators the size of the prediction error should gradually decrease as the

40

expected feedback increasingly converges with the actual feedback. In contrast, for non-regulators and

41

participants in a control group receiving unrelated or unstable feedback, the prediction errors would

42

remain large and variable because these participants cannot learn any association between mental

43

strategies and feedback. These straightforward implications of current theorizing about the

44

mechanisms underlying neurofeedback remained largely untested (for a simulation study on the

45

temporal dynamics of feedback: Oblak and colleagues (2017); for the correlation of BOLD with signal

46

increase (‘success’) and decrease (‘failure’) during regulation: Radua and colleagues (2018)). Here, we

47

directly investigate the prediction error mechanism in regions that control the SN/VTA, which itself has

48

been traditionally associated with the coding of reward prediction errors (Schultz, 2016). Specifically,

49

we hypothesize that decreasing prediction error signals during neurofeedback learning are associated

50

with successful self-regulation and transfer effects.

51

(3) Our third aim was to identify individual differences in the ability to regulate the midbrain

52

to general characteristics of the reward system, hoping to further distinguish regulators from non-

53

regulators. Thus, we asked whether successful neurofeedback training (as measured by transfer

54

effects) taps into general properties of the reward system. Given that adaptive reward processing

55

characterizes the SN/VTA (Schultz, 1998; Tobler et al., 2005) we used a variant of the monetary

56

incentive delay (MID) task that captures differences in adaptive reward sensitivity between clinical and

57

non-clinical populations (Kirschner et al., 2018a). Using this task, we tested the hypothesis that reward

58

processing in regions that may control the dopaminergic midbrain is related to successful SN/VTA self-

59

regulation.

60

In sum, to study individual differences in capability to gain control of the SN/VTA we used rt-

61

fMRI neurofeedback training in healthy participants receiving either real feedback (veridical group) or

62

inverted feedback (control group). We quantified the individual degree of successful transfer by

63

comparing the individual post-training versus pre-training self-regulation capabilities. Moreover, we

64

related individual differences in reward sensitivity in separately measured SN/VTA self-regulation

65

success.

2 Methods

67

2.1

68

Fifty-nine right-handed participants (45 males, average age 28.25±5.25 years) underwent

69

neurofeedback training. We analysed data from two independent projects, which used highly similar

70

rt-fMRI paradigms, rt-fMRI software and scanner hardware. The first dataset (Sulzer et al., 2013b)

71

comprised male participants, randomly assigned to one of two groups. The experimental group

72

received veridical neurofeedback (N = 15), the control group received inverted neurofeedback (N = 16)

73

as training signal. The second dataset (Kirschner et al., 2018c) comprised the healthy control

74

participants (N=28, 14 males) of a project investigating also cocaine users (these data are not

75

presented here). This group received veridical neurofeedback. A subset of the participants in the

76

second dataset (N=25) also performed a variant of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task (Kirschner

77

et al., 2018a). All participants provided written informed-consent and have been compensated for

78

their participation. The Zurich cantonal ethics committee approved these studies in accordance with

79

the Human Subjects Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

80

2.2

81

All participants underwent neuroimaging in a Philips Achieva 3 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) scanner

82

using an eight channel SENSE head coil (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) either at the Laboratory for

83

Social and Neural Systems Research Zurich (SNS Lab, Study 1) or the MR Center of the Psychiatric

84

Hospital of the University of Zurich (Study 2). First, we acquired anatomical images (Study1: gradient

85

echo T1-weighted sequence in 301 sagittal plane slices of 250 × 250 mm2 resulting in 1.1 mm3 voxels;

86

Study2: spin-echo T2-weighted sequence with 70 sagittal plane slices of 230 × 184 mm2 resulting in

87

0.57 × 0.72 × 2 mm3 voxel size) prior to neurofeedback training and loaded them into BrainVoyager QX

88

v2.3 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) to identify SN/VTA as target region (see 2.4 for

89

details). To acquire functional data, we used 27 ascending transversal slices in a gradient echo T2*-

90

weighted whole brain echo-planar image sequence in both studies. The in-plane resolution was 2 × 2

91

mm2, 3 mm slice thickness and 1.1 mm gap width over a field of view of 220 × 220 mm2, a TR/TE of

92

2000/35 ms and a flip angle of 82°. Slices were aligned with the anterior–posterior commissure and

93

then tilted by 15°. Functional images were converted from Philips par/rec data format to ANALYZE and

94

exported in real-time to the external analysis computer via the DRIN software library provided by

95

Philips. This external computer ran Turbo BrainVoyager v3.0 (TBV – Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The

96

Netherlands) to extract the BOLD signal from the images and calculate the neural activation for the

97

feedback signal. The visual feedback signal was presented using custom-made software with Visual

98

Studio 2008 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) through either a mirror mounted at the rear end of the

99

scanner bore (Study 1) or through MR compatible goggles (Study 2).

2.3

Neurofeedback paradigm

101

The participants were instructed that their goal was to control a reward-related region-of-interest in

102

their brains by imagining rewarding stimuli, actions, or events (note that we have previously shown

103

that reward imagination activates SN/VTA with standard fMRI (Miyapuram et al., 2012)). Prior to

104

scanning, we provided examples of such rewards, including palatable food items, motivating

105

achievements, positive experiences with friends and family, favourite leisure activity or romantic

106

imagery. We encouraged participants to use these different rewards as potential strategies for

107

upregulating reward-related activity (during the cue ‘Happy Time!’, here referred to as

108

IMAGINE_REWARD condition), which was fed back visually with a smiley vertically translating

109

proportional to the SN/VTA BOLD signal (see below). In contrast, during the cue ‘Rest’ (here referred

110

to as REST condition), participants were asked to perform neutral imagery, such as mental calculation

111

to reduce reward-related activity. Prior to training, participants were familiarized with the 5s delay of

112

the hemodynamic response affecting the display of the feedback and were asked not to move or

113

change their breathing during the neurofeedback training.

114

Each neurofeedback session comprised: a pre-training imagery baseline run without any

115

feedback, three (Study 1) or two (Study 2) training runs during which neurofeedback was presented

116

(as Study 2 also investigated patients, training was limited to two runs), and a transfer run (i.e., without

117

feedback). Each of these runs comprised nine blocks of IMAGINE_REWARD and REST conditions, each

118

lasting 20 s. To determine the current level of the feedback signal we used the average of the last five

119

volumes of the previous REST condition as reference value and employed a moving average of the

120

previous three volumes to reduce noise. In the veridical feedback group, the smiley moved up with

121

increasing percent signal change of SN/VTA BOLD signal and changed colour from red to yellow (Fig. 1

122

A). In the inverted feedback group, the smiley moved up and turned yellow with a decreasing SN/VTA

123

BOLD signal.

Figure 1 Neurofeedback paradigm: (A) All runs consisted of alternating blocks of REST and IMAGINE_REWARD conditions,
with each block lasting 20 s. The regulation conditions (REST, IMAGINE_REWARD) were indicated by words (‘Rest’ or ‘Happy
Time!’) and the feedback presented as moving smiley face during neurofeedback training runs. The preceding baseline and
subsequent transfer runs comprised no feedback. The SN/VTA signal difference from these runs served to quantify the degree
of regulation transfer (DORT) as (SN/VTA_BOLD{IMAGINE_REWARD, Transfer} - SN/VTA_BOLD{REST, Transfer}) (SN/VTA_BOLD{IMAGINE_REWARD, Baseline} - SN/VTA_BOLD{REST, Baseline}). (B) Post-processed SN/VTA signal was extracted from the
probabilistic atlas mask defined by Murty et al. (2014).

125

2.4 Region-of-interest SN/VTA

126

In both studies, the target region for neurofeedback, i.e. the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral

127

tegmental area (VTA), was structurally identified using individual anatomical scans. Since the individual

128

mask definition slightly differed between Study 1 and 2 (T1-weighted scans in Study 1 and T2-weighted

129

scans in Study 2), we used an independent mask for our post-hoc analysis. By this, we can control for

130

individual differences between experimenter ROI selection strategies, to avoid interpolation

131

confounds due to warping by normalization and use a reliable seed region for functional connectivity

132

analysis. The mask we are using here is a probabilistic mask of the SN and VTA as defined by (Murty et

133

al., 2014), which is based on a large sample set (148 datasets) and available on

134

https://www.adcocklab.org/neuroimaging-tools (download August 2018). Figure 1B illustrates this

135

mask within the brain.

136

2.5

137

We assessed the effects of individual differences in performance to characterise participants in

138

‘regulators’ and ‘non-regulators’. The measure of successful self-regulation was defined as individual

139

degree of regulation transfer (DORT), i.e. as the condition-specific SN/VTA signal difference between

140

post-training (Transfer) and pre-training (Baseline) runs:

𝐷𝑂𝑅𝑇 = (𝑆𝑁/𝑉𝑇𝐴_𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷{0123045_657268,:;<=>?@;} − 𝑆𝑁/𝑉𝑇𝐴_𝐵𝑂𝐿𝐷{65C:,:;<=>?@;} ) − (𝑆𝑁/

143

Thus, a positive DORT corresponds to a relative increase in post-training SN/VTA activity compared to

144

pre-training SN/VTA activity for the contrast IMAGINE_REWARD minus REST. Please note that in these

145

two runs (pre-training baseline, post-training transfer) no neurofeedback was presented. Thus to

146

achieve positive transfer effects participants had to apply what they had learned during training runs.

147

DORT distributions: To investigate potential group differences in DORT, we transferred the extracted

148

data to R (R-project R3.4.1). Using an anova, we tested for differences of the mean between the three

149

groups (i.e. the two groups receiving veridical feedback in Studies 1 and 2 and the control group

150

receiving inverted feedback in Study 1).

151

DORT in fMRI analysis: The DORT measure served to investigate the individual differences in successful

152

transfer at the whole brain level. In particular, we were interested to identify regions that were

153

positively associated with DORT and thus potentially contribute to regulation of the SN/VTA. For this

154

analysis, we entered mean centered individual DORT levels in all fMRI second level statistical models

155

(see 2.8). We excluded SN/VTA from all analyses to avoid any circularity.

156

Spatial specificity control analysis: To bolster the spatial specificity of our analysis about dopaminergic

157

midbrain regulation, we additionally performed an analysis using the directly neighbored brain region

158

of the parahippocampus as control target ROI. This target area is also active during the self-regulation

159

task since the participants perform memory-based strategies. We extracted this mask from the wfu

160

atlas and performed the identical main effects analysis as described above. To compare the results

161

between our target ROI SN/VTA and control ROI in parahippocampus, we performed a conjunction

162

analysis between the resulting contrast images. This comparison revealed only two common areas

163

within the cerebellum and the Temporal Gyrus. The limited commonalities between these two target

164

ROI’s, especially in striatal and prefrontal areas, indicate the spatial specificity of our findings using the

165

SN/VTA as target region (see Supplemental Material Figure S4 and Table S8).

166

2.6

MID Task

167

In every trial of the MID task (Kirschner et al., 2018b, 2016; Simon et al., 2015) first one of three cues

168

appeared (Fig. S1). One cue was associated with large reward (ranging from 0 to 2.00 CHF), one cue

169

with small reward (0 to 0.40 CHF) and one cue with no reward. After a delay of 2.5 to 3 s, participants

170

had to identify an outlier from three circles by pressing one of three buttons as quickly as possible.

171

Depending on the cue, their response time and the correctness of the answer, participants gained an

172

amount of money. Importantly, the use of large and small reward ranges enables investigation of

173

individual differences not only in general reward sensitivity but also in how well the reward system

174

adapts to different reward distributions, so-called adaptive reward coding (Kirschner et al., 2018a).

175

2.7

176

We despiked the functional data using AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni). To account for differences

177

in EPI slice acquisition times we employed temporal interpolation of the MR signal, shifting the signal

178

of the misaligned slices to the first slice (Sladky et al., 2011) using FSL 5 (FMRIB Software Library,

179

Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Furthermore, data were bias-field corrected

180

using ANTs (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs), realigned using FSL 5, normalized to standard MNI space

181

using ANTs in combination with a custom scanner-specific EPI-template resulting in a 1.5

182

mm3 isotropic resolution and finally smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel using FSL 5.

MR Data pre-processing

183

The spatial specificity control analyses (see Supplemental Material Figure S4 and Table S8)

184

suggest that the data are not due to common physiological noise. To more directly account for noise,

185

we additionally acquired physiological data in a subsample of participants. In the available subsample,

186

neither changes in heart rate variability nor respiration were significantly correlated with VTA/SN

187

activation during reward imagination (see details in Kirschner et al., 2018, Supplemental Material Table

188

S1, Figure S1). Here, we also used an image-based correction to account for physiological artefacts in

189

all participants. Since physiological artefacts are most prominently present in CSF and white matter

190

due to the absence of BOLD effects, pulsations of the ventricles, and proximity to the large brain

191

arteries (e.g., circle of Willis), we decided to use an established preprocessing procedure based on a

192

PCA approach (Sladky et al., 2013; Weissenbacher et al., 2009). Specifically, we calculated the global

193

mean and the first 6 components of a temporal principal component analysis on the cerebrospinal

194

fluid and white matter signal. These 6 components were used as noise regressors in the first level

195

statistics (see 2.8) in addition to the 6 motion parameters. Along with the pre-processing of the fMRI

196

data, the SN/VTA mask used as ROI for the analysis was resliced into the dimensions of the functional

197

data using SPM 12 (v6906, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) within Matlab R2016b

198

(www.mathworks.com).

199

2.8

200

For all of the following analyses, we used the toolbox SPM 12 (v6906) within Matlab R2016b. All figures

201

were created using bspmview v.20161108 (Spunt, 2016) and ggplot2 within R 3.4.1. All group-level

202

analysis included an additional covariate for the dataset to account for potential global signal

203

differences between studies.

204

2.8.1

205

The first question of this study asked whether the individual degree of successful neurofeedback

206

transfer is associated with individual differences in the cognitive control network. To answer this

207

question, we conducted a general linear model (GLM) on the single subject level including one block-

208

wise regressor for the IMAGINE_REWARD condition and one for the REST condition with 190 timesteps

209

(each condition comprised 9 onsets and lasted 20 s) for each of the four runs separately. Additionally,

210

we modelled the first 5 TRs of every run as nuisance regressor and added also motion and physiological

211

artefact regressors (see 2.7) in the design matrix. In total the GLM consisted of fifteen regressors. We

212

formed the contrast IMAGINE_REWARD-REST and compared it between Transfer and Baseline runs,

213

i.e. (IMAGINE_REWARD-REST)Transfer – (IMAGINE_REWARD-REST)Baseline. At the group level, we tested

214

for correlation of DORT with this contrast in a one-sample t-test. We ran these analyses separately for

215

both the veridical and inverted feedback groups. To test for common and separate activity between

216

the groups, we performed conjunction and disjunction analyses over the two group maps. Additionally,

217

we performed a two-sample t-test group comparison analysis to identify significant group differences.

To identify activity within the cognitive control network, we used a cognitive control template based

219

on the coordinates from a meta-analysis (Niendam et al., 2012). We created this template with

220

fslmaths and spheres of 15 mm around all coordinates from the meta-analysis. In table S1 we identify

221

regions of the cognitive control network where transfer success correlates with DORT both within the

222

template. For statistical maps, we used FWE-corrected cluster level threshold with p < .05 (cluster

223

extent of 230 voxel) based on whole brain statistics p < .001. In addition, to test the functional

224

specificity of our results, we performed a meta-analytic functional decoding analysis using the

225

Neurosynth database (www.neurosynth.org). This relates the neural signatures of the cognitive control

226

decoding network to other task-related neural patterns (Fig. S2).

228

The second question of the study was to investigate whether successful neurofeedback performance

229

was associated with a reduction in prediction error as assumed by a classic reinforcement learning

230

mechanism. To address this issue specifically for the neurofeedback training runs we constructed a

231

GLM that replaced the block (IMAGINE_REWARD and REST) regressors with corresponding event

232

regressors that modelled every TR and that we parametrically modulated with a time-resolved

233

continuous prediction error (PE) term. This PE term was defined as difference between the current and

234

the previous TR within the SN/VTA mask, i.e. (BOLD_SN/VTAt- BOLD_SN/VTAt-1; accordingly, in the

235

upregulation condition the parametric modulator corresponded to IMAGINE_REWARDt –

236

IMAGINE_REWARDt-1). To investigate if the prediction error decreases over time, we used the

237

difference (parametric modulator PE (run 2) – parametric modulator PE (run 1), i.e. PE coding in

238

neurofeedback training run 2 minus neurofeedback training run 1 (Figure 1A). This difference should

239

become negative as prediction errors decrease with learning. On the group level, we correlated this

240

contrast (difference in PE coding run2 – PE coding run1) with the DORT measure in a one-sample t-test

241

to test for associations between a decrease in prediction error coding and successful self-regulation.

Prediction error coding analysis during NF training

242

The results of this analysis, showing prediction error coding in the dorsolateral prefrontal

243

cortex (dlPFC), inspired a functional connectivity analysis. Specifically, we investigated the functional

244

impact of the dlPFC prediction error signal on the SN/VTA using a psychophysiological interaction

245

analysis using the gPPI v13 Toolbox (McLaren et al., 2012) based on the MNI coordinate of dlPFC (x=40,

246

y=10, z=38) with a 5 mm sphere as seed region. We added activity from this seed region as

247

physiological regressor to the original GLM (2.7.2) and interacted it with both the IMAGINE_REWARD

248

and REST regressors to form interaction regressors. Functional connectivity was calculated by

249

contrasting the interaction terms IMAGINE_REWARD-REST between second and first neurofeedback

250

training run. We then correlated this contrast with DORT. The results were masked with the SN/VTA

251

mask for illustration purposes. For statistical maps, we used a whole-brain threshold of p < .001 (50

252

voxel extent).

253

2.8.3

254

To address the third aim of the study, we investigated the relationship between reward processing in

255

the MID task and the capacity to successfully regulate the SN/VTA in the neurofeedback experiment.

256

In particular, we considered two contrasts in the MID task (1) general reward sensitivity, defined as

257

the sum of parametric modulators: small plus large reward (2) adaptive reward coding, defined as the

258

difference between parametric modulators: small minus large reward. Again, we used correlation

259

analysis at the group level to determine whether these two contrasts are related with individual

260

transfer success (DORT) in the neurofeedback task. Moreover, to assess the commonalities of the

261

neural activities in these different tasks, we performed a conjunction analysis of contrasts (1), (2) and

262

the correlation of transfer-activity with DORT (see 2.8.1). For illustration purposes of this conjunction

263

analysis, we used a threshold of p < .005, for reporting we used p < .001 (cluster extent = 50).

2.9 Additional behavioral measurements

266

Strategies: All participants were introduced to five example strategies (see 2.3) that might be used to

267

up-regulate brain activity but also free to use their own strategies. At the end of the experiment,

268

participants filled in a custom-made questionnaire on the strategies they used. To compare strategies

269

between the groups, we used a χ2-test to assess differences in the distribution of strategy usage. We

270

did not observe any significant group differences in strategy use (p = .9), and therefore did not consider

271

this measurement in any further analysis.

272

Personality measures: To investigate whether individual differences in behavior and personality were

273

associated with individual differences in DORT, Study 2 measured: (1) Smoking status in number of

274

cigarettes per day; (2) verbal IQ as determined by the Multiple Word Test (MWT, Lehrl, 2005); (3)

275

Positive and Negative Affect Score (PANAS) in the German version (Krohne et al., 1996); (4) attentional

276

and nonplanning subscores of the Barratt Impulsivity Scale in the German version (Preuss et al., 2008).

277

We tested for correlations with the DORT parameter using Pearson correlations. As none of these

278

variables correlated significantly with the DORT parameter (all p > .5), we did not consider them

279

further.

282

We first evaluated the DORT measure and compared it between the three datasets. There were no

283

significant differences across all three groups (mean veridical group Study 1 = .01, mean veridical group

284

Study 2 = -.02, mean inverted group Study 1= -.05; F(2, 56) = .13; Fig. 1). Moreover, also the direct

285

comparison between the two veridical groups was not significant (T(39) = -.26, p = .8). Accordingly, we

286

combined the two veridical groups for subsequent analyses. Importantly, our participants showed

287

considerable variation in DORT, which allowed us to investigate the individual differences in brain

288

activity accompanying more or less successful regulation of the SN/VTA through neurofeedback. Thus,

No difference in degree of regulation transfer (DORT) across groups

Figure 2 Distribution of DORT across groups. The DORT measure was distributed similarly in both groups
receiving veridical feedback in Studies 1 and 2 and the control group receiving inverted feedback in Study
1. Accordingly, we found no evidence supporting a main effect of feedback on transfer. However, DORT
varied substantially across individuals, which motivated the analyses using the individual self-regulation
success.

veridical and amygdala activity in inverted feedback group

293

3.2.1

Veridical feedback group

294

We investigated whether individual levels of successful SN/VTA self-regulation (DORT) were associated

295

with increased post-training activity compared to pre-training activity (IMAGINE_REWARD-REST)Transfer

296

– (IMAGINE_REWARD-REST)Baseline). This analysis revealed several areas consistently reported by

297

neurofeedback studies (see Fig. 2 in the meta-analysis of Sitaram et al., 2016), including dorsolateral

298

prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and thalamus

299

(Figure 3A and Table 1). To formally test for a more general association with the cognitive control

300

network, we applied a cognitive control network template from a meta-analysis (Niendam et al., 2012),

301

which in addition revealed neural activity in precuneus and striatum (Fig. 3B for exemplary illustrations

of dlPFC, ACC, temporal gyrus, and thalamus activity; Table S1 for full overview). Thus, regions of the

303

cognitive control network showed transfer to the extent that neurofeedback training of the

304

dopaminergic midbrain was successful.

Figure 3: Correlation of DORT with transfer success after training in veridical feedback group: To investigate whole-brain neural
activity correlating with successful SN/VTA self-regulation, we used DORT as measure of regulation success and correlated it with
the contrast (IMAGINE_REWARDtransfer - RESTtransfer) - (IMAGINE_REWARDbaseline - RESTbaseline) as measure of learning related change
in neural activity. A) The analysis revealed task-specific correlations primarily within the cognitive control network (whole brain
overview FWE-corrected with p<.05 on cluster level, projected to lateral and medial sagittal sections). B) Exemplary correlations
within the cognitive control network have been depicted, here in MFG/dlPFC, ACC, Thalamus, and bilateral Temporal Gyrus, to
illustrate the association between neural activity with DORT. The correlations are for illustration purposes only without further
significance testing to avoid double dipping. The grey shaded area identifies 95 % confidence interval.

Table 1 Correlation of transfer activity (IMAGINE_REWARDtransfer - RESTtransfer) - (IMAGINE_REWARDbaseline - RESTbaseline) with
DORT in veridical feedback group (see Figure 3a). Table shows all local maxima separated by more than 20 mm; for all
clusters, p< 0.05 FWE-corrected on cluster level, t > 3.30; p < 0.001; df = 40. Regions were labelled using the Harvard-Oxford
atlas and/or the Anatomy Toolbox in parentheses; the activity in SN/VTA has been excluded from the table to avoid circularity;

305

3.2.2

Inverted feedback group

306

For the inverted feedback group, the same analysis resulted in partly distinct activations. In contrast

307

to the veridical feedback group, left amygdala activity correlated significantly with DORT (Fig. 4 and

308

Table S2). Importantly, activity in cognitive control areas reported above, such as dlPFC and ACC, was

309

significantly weaker in inverted than veridical feedback groups (Table S3 for disjunction and direct

310

statistical comparison). These regions therefore appear to play a preferential role for successful

311

transfer of SN/VTA self-regulation.

312

We also tested for common activity in the two feedback groups using conjunction analysis.

313

Similar to the veridical group, the inverted feedback group showed correlations between DORT and

314

activity in the precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, insula, IFG, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus

315

(Table S4). These common areas appear to reflect non-specific regulation activity and may be

316

associated with memory and introspection processes.

Figure 4 Correlation of DORT with transfer success after training in inverted feedback group: (A) Receiving inverted feedback
resulted in a correlation between DORT as measure of regulation success and the contrast (IMAGINE_REWARDtransfer RESTtransfer) - (IMAGINE_REWARDbaseline - RESTbaseline) as measure of learning related change in the amygdala (p<.001). This
region was not observed in the veridical group. (B) The correlation depicts the positive association of neural activity in the
amygdala with DORT. The plot is for illustration purposes only without further significance testing to avoid double dipping.
The grey shaded area identifies the 95 % confidence interval.

318

Reinforcement learning: DLPFC prediction error coding during neurofeedback training
correlates with DORT

319

To investigate whether reinforcement learning mechanisms contribute to successful neurofeedback

320

transfer, we tested for time-resolved parametric prediction error related activity during the training

321

runs. We reasoned that prediction error activity should decrease from early to late phases of

322

neurofeedback training for successful regulators. At any time during neurofeedback training,

323

participants needed to come up with their own predictions of the upcoming feedback signal and

324

compare the predictions with actual feedback at the next time point. Similarly, in temporal difference

325

learning models, prediction errors are calculated at each moment in time (Sutton and Barto, 2018).

326

Therefore, we operationalized prediction error by subtracting the immediately preceding SN/VTA

327

activity (prediction) from the present SN/VTA activity (outcome). This analysis revealed that prediction

328

error signals in dlPFC decreased with ongoing neurofeedback training only for participants with high

329

DORT (Fig. 5). To assess this finding in more detail, we also analysed the two neurofeedback training

330

runs separately. This analysis confirmed that more successful participants showed more pronounced

331

dlPFC coding of prediction error in early compared to later training (see Fig. S3 for run-wise PE coding

332

in dlPFC).

Figure 5: Prediction error coding in dlPFC decreases during NF training in participants with successful SN/VTA selfregulation: (A) The time-resolved neural prediction error signal, corresponding to the parametric difference between the
current and immediately preceding feedback activity from the SN/VTA decreased with ongoing feedback training within dlPFC
as a function of degree of regulation transfer (p<.001). This finding is consistent with reinforcement learning theories,
according to which prediction errors decrease as learning progresses. By extension, reinforcement learning mechanisms can
explain successful neurofeedback training. (B) The plot depicts correlation of neural activity in the dlPFC with DORT. The plot
is for illustration purposes only without further significance testing to avoid double dipping. The grey shaded area identifies
the 95 % confidence interval.

333

3.4

Learning-related functional coupling of DLPFC with SN/VTA

334

Our finding of time-resolved prediction error coding in dlPFC inspired a complementary functional

335

connectivity analysis. We used the prediction error coding area within the dlPFC as a seed region to

336

investigate coupling to the SN/VTA region our participants aimed to regulate. Functional connectivity

337

between the two regions increased with transfer success (Fig. 6; (t(40) = 3.79, cluster extent = 16, MNI

338

x = -2, y = -16, z = -15). In other words, DORT and dlPFC to SN/VTA connectivity correlated positively.

339

Note that this correlation of DORT with dlPFC-SN/VTA connectivity was task-related as it was enhanced

340

during IMAGINE_REWARD relative to REST (which served as psychological regressor) and independent

341

of SN/VTA activity.

Figure 6 Functional connectivity between dlPFC and SN/VTA correlates with transfer success: (A) A functional connectivity
analysis based on the prediction error coding seed region in the dlPFC (MNI coordinate 40, 10, 38, 5 cm sphere) revealed that
increasing connectivity to the SN/VTA correlated with increasing success of neurofeedback training (p<.001). (B) DORT
increased with increasing connectivity between dlPFC and SN/VTA during IMAGINE_REWARD vs. REST in neurofeedback
training runs. Thus, dlPFC appears to regulate SN/VTA in proportion to the degree to which neurofeedback training is
successful. (C) The correlation plot depicts connectivity between dlPFC and SN/VTA with DORT. The plot is for illustration
purposes only without further significance testing to avoid double dipping. The grey shaded area identifies the 95 %

344

Individual differences in dlPFC reward sensitivity during MID task correlate with
regulation success

345

In Study 2 we used the MID task to independently measure reward sensitivity and the capability to

346

adapt to different reward contexts (Kirschner et al., 2018a). We asked whether individual measures of

347

reward processing (measured with parametric and adaptive coding of reward related BOLD activity)

348

are predictive for individual regulation. Specifically, we tested for correlations between DORT and MID

349

reward sensitivity (sum of small and large reward parametric modulators) and MID adaptive reward

350

coding (difference of small minus large reward parametric modulators). A conjunction of three

351

correlations with DORT – reward sensitivity in the MID task, adaptive reward coding in the MID task

352

and the contrast (IMAGINE_REWARDtransfer - RESTtransfer) - (IMAGINE_REWARDbaseline - RESTbaseline) outside

353

SN/VTA revealed common neural activity in the dlPFC (center at MNI x = 40, y = 10, z = 38; Fig. 7 and

354

Table S6). Thus, the more successful individuals were at self-regulating SN/VTA as a result of

neurofeedback training, the more sensitive they were to reward and the more strongly they adapted

356

to different reward contexts in the MID task.

Figure 7 Reward-sensitivity in dlPFC correlates with successful SN/VTA self-regulation: (A) SN/VTA DORT in the
neurofeedback task correlated with prefrontal reward sensitivity and adaptive coding in the MID task. A conjunction analysis
around the peak coordinate in dlPFC showing prediction error coding during neurofeedback training (MNI x = 40, y = 10, z =
38, left) revealed common neural activity reflecting transfer (IMAGINE_REWARDtransfer - RESTtransfer) (IMAGINE_REWARDbaseline - RESTbaseline) and reward sensitivity (small + large reward magnitude parametric modulators in MID,
all contrasts with p<.001). Moreover, individuals with more successful self-regulation of the SN/VTA showed stronger
adaptive coding (which reflects higher sensitivity to small relative to large rewards) in the same region that also showed
learning-related decreases in prediction error coding during neurofeedback training (right). (B) The correlation plot depicts
the adaptive coding activity in dlPFC with DORT. The plot is for illustration purposes only without further significance testing
to avoid double dipping. The grey shaded area identifies the 95 % confidence interval.

4 Discussion

358

In the present work, we used data acquired from two previous rt-fMRI neurofeedback studies to

359

characterize individual differences and mechanisms in successfully transferred self-regulation of the

360

dopaminergic midbrain after neurofeedback training. We found a strong relation between self-

361

regulation success and increases in post-training activity in the cognitive control network. Moreover,

362

we found four correlations with increasing transfer effects: (i) decreasing dlPFC prediction error signals

363

during neurofeedback training, (ii) increasing connectivity of dlPFC to the SN/VTA for reward

364

imagination compared to rest during transfer, (iii) increasing reward sensitivity in dlPFC and (iv)

365

increasing adaptive reward coding in dlPFC in the independent MID task. Together, our study

366

elucidates the mechanistic control of the dopaminergic midbrain via the cognitive control network and

367

suggests that reinforcement learning contributes to successful neurofeedback training.

368

Sustained self-regulation skills and the generalization of learning after neurofeedback training are key

369

elements for practical applications and remain one of the major challenges in rt-FMRI neurofeedback

370

research (Sulzer et al., 2013a). Results from previous neurofeedback studies of the reward system have

371

been inconclusive (Greer et al., 2014; Kirschner et al., 2017; Sulzer et al., 2013b) and only one study

372

(MacInnes et al., 2016) reported significant post-training activity in the VTA, and increased mesolimbic

373

network connectivity. Methodological limitations might have hampered the ability to detect transfer

374

effects. First, previous studies focused exclusively on self-regulation of one a priori target region, such

375

as SN/VTA, instead of investigating large-scale post-training effects within the whole brain. Second,

376

transfer effects were examined at the group-level, which did not reflect the individual learning success.

377

In the present study we overcome both limitations by taking advantage of an individual measure of

378

transfer success (DORT) and focusing on the whole brain.

379

One insight of the present study is that transfer success associates with neural activity in cognitive

380

control network areas (Niendam et al., 2012; Parro et al., 2018), such as dlPFC and ACC. This network

381

overlaps with regions that have been associated with feedback-related information processing during

382

training (Marco-Pallarés et al., 2007, Emmert et al., 2016). Together, these findings suggest that the

383

same regions contribute to acquisition and transfer of neurofeedback and that sustained post-training

384

self-regulation generalizes across a functional network of different brain regions. Intriguingly, similar

385

networks have been reported in skill learning. Future studies might investigate commonalities

386

between neurofeedback and particularly cognitive skill learning, taking into account the specific

387

temporal dynamics of both functions (Birbaumer et al., 2013; Tenison et al., 2016).

388

The finding that individuals with more successful regulation of the dopaminergic midbrain show

389

stronger activation of cognitive control areas during transfer speaks to our understanding of how

390

individual differences in cognitive control affect emotion regulation (Braver et al., 2010; Buhle et al.,

392

of cognitive control has been shown to predict negative affect reduction through reappraisal and

393

suppression (Hendricks and Buchanan, 2016) Interestingly, dopamine action (particularly at D1

394

receptors) in dlPFC sustains working memory performance (Arnsten et al., 2015). Thus, it is conceivable

395

that frontolimbic loops contribute to successful transfer.

396

Although speculative at this point, the positive post-training effects on the cognitive-control network

397

activity might also have implications for transdiagnostic clinical applications. First, combining rt-fMRI

398

neurofeedback training with different forms of psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy

399

(Beck, 2005), dialectical behavioral therapy (Lynch et al., 2007), or psychodynamic therapy (Bateman

400

and Fonagy, 2010; Have-de Labije and Neborsky, 2012; Maroda, 2010) could improve emotion

401

regulation deficits prevalent in several psychiatric disorders including substance use disorders,

402

depression, anxiety and personality disorders. With particular attention to substance use disorders,

403

maladaptive changes in neuroplasticity within the cognitive control network are closely associated

404

with loss of control and compulsive drug-seeking (George and Koob, 2010; Holmes et al., 2016; Koob

405

and Volkow, 2010). In these patients, neurofeedback training might be able to directly target the

406

biological correlates and reinstate function of the cognitive-control network.

407

We found stronger reductions in prediction error coding in the DLPFC for regulators than non-

408

regulators. This finding suggests that prediction error-driven reinforcement learning was more

409

pronounced in regulators than non-regulators and provides empirical evidence for previous theoretical

410

proposals on the mechanisms of neurofeedback learning independent of feedback modality

411

(Birbaumer et al., 2013). Thus, reinforcement learning mechanisms provide a framework for

412

understanding how neurofeedback works. Future research may want to investigate whether the rich

413

theoretical and empirical tradition of reinforcement learning, (e.g. Pearce, 2008), can be harnessed to

414

facilitate neurofeedback training.

415

We found that successful SN/VTA self-regulation is associated with an increased functional coupling

416

between dlPFC regions coding prediction error and the dopaminergic midbrain. This coupling fits well

417

with anatomical connections between dlPFC and the dopaminergic midbrain (Frankle et al., 2006;

418

Sesack et al., 2003) as well as functional connectivity studies on motivation (Ballard et al., 2011) and

419

animal studies on prefrontal regulation of midbrain activity (Gao et al., 2007; Jo and Mizumori, 2016).

420

The animal work suggests that prefrontal cortex controls dopaminergic neurons primarily indirectly,

421

through inhibitory relay neurons. By showing top-down control of the midbrain, our data go beyond

422

previous connectivity studies of the dopamine system, which primarily focused on coupling between

423

the prefrontal cortex and the striatum (Chatham et al., 2014; Schenk et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2018).

424

At the functional level, a recent study on creative problem solving in humans highlights that dlPFC is

425

involved in experiencing a moment of insight, the so called Aha!-moment (Tik et al., 2018). According

426

to this effective connectivity study, dlPFC could upregulate the VTA/SN via striatal connections during

427

such a moment. On the other hand, in trials where no solution was found for a given problem, also no

428

significant connectivity was observed. This study supports our finding that dlPFC-SN/VTA connectivity

429

plays an important role in self-guided motivation and in internal reward processing. Our finding

430

highlights that cognitive and affective mechanisms associated with different experiences also involve

431

different neural pathways. Future studies should investigate to what degree individual differences in

432

the functional architecture of brain networks (Hahn et al., 2014) influence these internal reward

433

mechanisms and to which degree different strategies can influence neurofeedback training success.

434

Our independent reward task revealed that individual differences in prefrontal reward sensitivity and

435

efficient adaptive reward coding were associated with successful SN/VTA self-regulation. Adaptive

436

coding of rewards captures the notion that neural activity (output) should match the most likely inputs

437

to maximize efficiency and representational precision (Wark et al., 2007). Accordingly, we previously

438

showed that reward regions encode a small range of rewards more strongly than the large range of

439

rewards (Kirschner et al., 2018a, 2016). Interestingly, participants who were more sensitive to small

440

rewards were also more successful in self-regulation of the dopaminergic midbrain in the present
24

441

study. When participants in a typical neurofeedback training paradigm succeed at increasing the

442

activity of the self-regulated area, the ensuing change in visual stimulation (positive neurofeedback)

443

may constitute a small reward. By extension, adaptive reward coding may therefore provide a useful

444

handle on identifying regulators. Moreover, future neurofeedback experiments should consider

445

scaling the feedback signal to avoid sensitivity limitations, particularly in individuals with reduced

446

adaptive coding.

447

A potential limitation of our study is that we used a combined mask for SN and VTA even though

448

differences in functionality and anatomy have been reported for the two regions (reviewed e.g. in

449

Trutti et al., 2019), with the SN more related to motor functions and the VTA to reward functions.

450

However, it should be kept in mind that when viewed through the lens of recording and imaging rather

451

than lesion techniques the differences are more gradual than categorical (Düzel et al., 2009). Still,

452

future studies may want to use more specific feedback from one or the other region to more

453

specifically target potential differences in functions.

454

5 Conclusions

455

We showed that successful transfer in SN/VTA self-regulation after neurofeedback training is

456

associated with activity in the cognitive control network and dlPFC. Future studies could employ

457

cognitive control activity during neurofeedback training to boost success rates and clinical outcomes.

458

Furthermore, our findings of decreasing prediction error signals in dlPFC suggest that associative

459

learning contributes to real-time fMRI neurofeedback effects. Finally, we show that higher individual

460

reward sensitivity increases the chance of neurofeedback training success. Patients with reduced

461

reward sensitivity may therefore benefit from careful scaling of the neurofeedback information.
