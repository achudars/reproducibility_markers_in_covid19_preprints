Abstract
Background: With the advance of globalization and the decline of wild habitats,
mosquito-borne viruses are no longer confined to their original sylvatic environments
and are emerging or remerging worldwide. However, little is known about the
mosquito species implicated in the spillovers of these viruses from their enzootic
cycles. Method: We conducted an entomological field survey to catalogue the
relative abundance of the Culicidae fauna in rural, peri-urban and urban areas in the
Dschang locality in West Cameroon. Mosquitoes were collected from March-April and
July-August 2019 at both aquatic and adult stages, and identified using
stereomicroscopes and morphological identification keys. Results: A total of 1,401
mosquitoes belonging to 4 genera and 26 species were collected (n=427, 470 and
504 in rural, peri-urban and urban areas respectively). The most abundant species
Aedes africanus (45.47%) as well as Culex moucheti (8.92 %) were encountered in
peri-urban and rural environments. Species like Culex duttoni (14.49%), Culex

quinquefasciatus (2.35%) and Aedes aegypti (1.36%) were solely found in urban
area. Aedes albopictus (14.42%), Culex (Culiciomyia) (6.57%), Culex tigripes
(1.43%) and Eretmapodites chrysogaster (0.64%) on the other hand were collected in
the three study sites. Importantly, all these species have been suspected or
incriminated as vectors of many arboviruses. Conclusion: This study identified
potential sylvatic, urban and bridge-vectors that can play a role in current or future
virus emergence in Cameroon. Further investigations are needed to assess if
arboviruses are circulating in these areas and to study the vector role of each
mosquito species in arbovirus transmission.

Background
Mosquito-borne viruses are becoming a serious public health problem worldwide as
they spill over from their wild sylvatic habitat to emerge in many urban areas in all
continents wherever competent vectors are present. Most of the major mosquitoborne viruses of medical importance that cause disease outbreaks in human
populations without the requirement of amplification by a secondary non-human
vertebrate host originated from the African continent (like Yellow fever virus,
Chikungunya virus and Zika virus).
In a recent review, Braack and colleagues [1] listed 36 major arthropod-borne viruses
(arboviruses) indigenous to Africa with their respective geographic distribution and
known mosquito vector species. In Cameroon, the authors recorded many
arboviruses, which include Dengue virus (DENV), Ntaya virus (NTAV), Spondweni
virus (SPOV), Yaounde virus (YAOV) and Yellow fever virus (YFV) from the
Flavivirus genus, Flaviviridae family; Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Semliki Forest virus
(SFV) and Sindbis virus (SINV) from the Alphavirus genus, Togaviridae family; Rift
Valley Fever virus (RVFV) from the Phlebovirus genus, Bunyaviridae family; and
Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), Bwamba virus (BWAV) and Ilesha virus (ILEV) from the
Orthobunyavirus genus, Bunyaviridae family. These findings originate from many
studies that have investigated the prevalence of arboviruses in Cameroon mainly
based on the serodiagnostic of blood samples collected from humans [2-12].
However, few studies have investigated potential urban vectors or bridge vectors

responsible for spillovers of these viruses from the forest into anthropized
environments through entomological surveys [2, 13, 14], and very few have searched
for viruses in mosquitoes in Cameroon [15, 16].
To address this gap in knowledge, we made an up-to date catalogue of the diversity
and abundance of mosquito species collected in three habitats along a transect of
urbanization in Dschang, West Region of Cameroon. This survey would help to
identify potential sylvatic, urban and bridge-vectors that can play a role in current or
future virus spillover from wild to more urbanized areas. It is also an important initial
step to assess the health risk of humans and animals living in these habitats to such
diseases.
Methods
Description of the study sites
This study was carried out in rural (sylvatic), peri-urban and urban areas of Dschang
Sub Division, within the Menoua Division. The rural and peri-urban habitats were
located in Fonakeukeu (N: 05 24.48.1, E: 010 04.44.7) and Toutsang (N: 05 25.34.5,
E :01004.10.7) villages respectively while the urban habitat was located in the town
of Dschang (N: 05 26.805, E: 010 03.8404). They all lie in the highland area of
western Cameroon that exhibits a sub-tropical climate characterized by two seasons;
a dry season of 4 months (from mid-November to mid-March) and a rainy season of 8
months (mid-March to mid-November). Annual average rainfall and temperature are
of 321 mm and 21.6°C respectively [10]. The urban area (Dschang) is characterized
by a shrub-like vegetation, an important hydrographic network and many artificial
breeding sites, ideal to maintain the urban cycle of mosquitoes and their arboviruses.
The peri-urban (Toutsang) and rural (Fonakeukeu) are found at about 2km and 5 km
respectively from the urban area (Dschang). Raffia palm bushes are common in
these areas and are found along the valleys and streams which offer natural
breeding sites that can easily maintain the sylvatic cycle of mosquitoes and their
arboviruses.

Mosquito sampling and identification
Field surveys were made in rural, peri-urban and urban areas during the rainy season
from March-April and July-August 2019. Mosquitoes were collected in these areas
three times per month at immature stages in available breeding sites (abandoned
tires, riverbeds and floor pools) and at adult stages using sweep nets (to catch males,
females and bloodfed females resting on the vegetation). Immature stages were
reared to adults before identification. Morphological identification of species was
done using stereomicroscopes and morphological identification keys [17-19].
Results
A total of 1,401 mosquitoes belonging to 4 genera and 26 species were collected in
the three areas (n=427 in the rural area, n= 470 in the peri-urban area and n=504 in
the urban area) (Table 1). Out of the 26 species, Aedes africanus (n=637, 45.47%)
were the most abundant, followed by Culex duttoni (n=203, 14.49%), Aedes
albopictus (n=202, 14.42%), Culex moucheti (n=125, 8.92%) and Culex (Culiciomyia)
(n=92, 6.57%) (Table 1). Interestingly, Aedes africanus and Culex moucheti were
only found in rural (Fonakeukeu) and peri urban (Toutsang) areas while Culex
duttoni, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti were only found in urban area
(Dschang). Species from the Culex Culiciomyia group, Eretmapodites chrysogaster
group, Culex tigripes and Aedes albopictus on the other hand were caught in the
three sites (rural, peri urban and urban). More importantly, all these species have
been suspected or incriminated as vectors of many arboviruses (Table 1).

Discussion
This work aimed to catalogue the Culicidae fauna in urban, peri-urban and rural
areas of Dschang, West Cameroon, that can be implicated as sylvatic, urban or
bridge vectors in virus transmission. A high diversity of mosquito species was found
in the locality with about 65.38% of the total mosquitoes collected identified as
potential vectors of arboviruses (Table 1).
Aedes africanus was the most abundant mosquito species in rural and peri-urban
areas. This species can transmit several arboviruses and has been incriminated as
vector of YFV and CHIKV [20]. Culex duttoni, the second most abundant mosquito
species found in the urban area, has been found to carry arboviruses like Arb11266
[20]. Culex quinquefasciatus, another species found exclusively in the urban area,
has been reported to transmit West Nile Fever (WNV) [21] and RVFV [22]. Aedes
albopictus is known vector of CHIKV [23] and has been suspected in Zika virus
transmission in Gabon [24]. Culex Culiciomyia species and Culex moucheti were
implicated in the transmission of NTAV [15].
Other mosquito species although collected in small numbers in our study area, have
also been identified as vectors of many arboviruses. These are; Aedes aegypti,
vectors of DENV, YFV, CHIKV [23, 25, 26]; Aedes circumluteolus, vectors of SPOV,
RVFV, BUNV [27, 28]; Aedes metallicus, vectors of YFV [26]; Aedes simpsoni,

Interestingly, a high aggressiveness of mosquitoes was noted during sampling and
few of the collected bloodfed mosquitoes (like Eretmapodites chrysogaster group, Cx.
moucheti and Ae. africanus) were found with human blood (Unpublished data).
Arboviruses that have been found circulating in Cameroon include DENV, YFV,
CHIKV, Zika virus (ZIKV), ONNV (Onyong Onyong virus), NTAV, SPOV,
Wesselsbron virus (WESV), SFV, SINV, Middelburg virus (MIDV), WNV, Tahyna
virus (TAH), BUNV, Uganda S virus (UGSV), YAOV, RVFV, BWAV and ILEV [1, 2, 4,
6, 8, 9, 12]. However, few mosquitoes have been incriminated as potential vectors of
these arboviruses in Cameroon. These few include; Aedes tarsalis group (viruses
isolated: MIDV, WESV), Aedes argenteopunctatus (virus isolated: Nkolbisson (YM
31.65)), Aedes africanus (virus isolated: WESV), Aedes simpsoni (virus isolated:
WESV), Culex albiventris (virus isolated: NTAV), Culex Culiciomyia (virus isolated:
NTAV), Culex moucheti (virus isolated: NTAV), Culex tigripes (virus isolated: NTAV)
and Eretmapodites chrysogaster group (viruses isolated: MIDV, Simbu virus) [15, 16].
Many mosquito species sampled in this study, such as Aedes africanus, Aedes
aegypti, Aedes tarsalis, Aedes albopictus and Aedes metallicus, have been reported
to be potential vectors of ZIKV and DENV in previous studies. Yet, ZIKV has been
detected in Cameroon in Yaoundé [5, 9] and in the Fako Division [4]. Furthermore, a
recent study found 11.7% and 10.4% of DENV circulating in Dschang and Bagangté
respectively [10], all situated in the western highland. Another study revealed acute
dengue in children living in urban and semi-urban areas of Dschang [32]. A mosquitobased arbovirus surveillance system might therefore help as a supplement to assess
the presence of such arboviruses in the locality and in the whole country.
Conclusion
This study provides an up-to date catalogue of the Culicidae fauna along a transect
of urbanization and identify the potential mosquito vectors that may be involved in
arbovirus transmission in West Cameroon. Based on these preliminary findings, in
addition to the recent detection of DENV in the locality, further researches are
required to assess the prevalence of arboviruses in these areas and to study the
vector role of these mosquito species in arbovirus transmission as well as to assess
their anthropophily by blood meal source identification. A surveillance system based
on the detection of pathogen genomic material in mosquito excreta has been recently

method that relies on processing thousands of individual mosquitoes and would offer
the opportunity to screen virus transmission in wider and wilder areas.
