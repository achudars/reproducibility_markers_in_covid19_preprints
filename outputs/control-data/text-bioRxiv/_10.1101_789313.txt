Summary
Most mutations in human cancer are low-frequency missense mutations, whose
functional status remains hard to predict. Here we show that depending on the type of
nucleotide change and the surrounding sequences, the tendency to generate each type of
nucleotide mutations varies greatly, even by several hundred folds. Therefore, a cancerpromoting mutation may appear only in a small number of cancer cases, if the underlying
nucleotide change is too difficult to generate. We propose a method that integrates both the
original mutation counts and their relative mutational difficulty. Using this method, we can
accurately predict the functionality of hundreds of low-frequency missense mutations in
p53, PTEN and INK4A. Many loss-of-function p53 mutations with dominant negative
effects were identified, and the functional importance of several regions in p53 structure
were highlighted by this analysis. Furthermore, mutational difficulty analysis also points
to potential means of cancer prevention. Our study not only established relative mutational
difficulties for different types of mutations in human cancer, but also showed that by
incorporating such parameter, we can bring new angles to understanding cancer formation
and prevention.

Introduction
Gene mutation is a major cause of tumorigenesis. Certain mutations on important
cancer genes such as KRAS and p53 drive cancer formation(Cheok et al., 2011;
Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017). As a result, such mutations are enriched in cancer, and are
found in numerous cancer samples. It is generally perceived that if a mutation occurs in
higher number of cancer cases, it is more likely to be a driver mutation(Baugh et al., 2018;
Brosh and Rotter, 2009). However, the vast majority of mutations in cancer only occurs in
very small number of cancer cases, and the functional impacts of these mutations are hard
to predict.
To address this problem, it is necessary to consider that, the chance of observing a
mutation in cancer cases is influenced by at least two major factors: 1) how difficult it is to
generate the mutation; and 2) whether the mutation promotes cancer, therefore it will be
selectively enriched in cancer cases. If different mutations are initially generated at
significantly different rates, it will greatly impact the mutational distribution in cancer
genome database such as COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer). Certain
cancer-driving, but too-hard-to generate mutations may appear exceedingly rare in cancer
database, yet certain passenger-type mutations may pile up in greater numbers, if the
underlying mutations are too easy to occur.
At nucleotide level, there are 12 routes of interchanges between A/G/T/C for single
nucleotide substitutions, which constitute the vast majority of cancer mutations. The
chances of generating each kind of mutations are certainly not equal. Many factors
contribute to such phenomenon. First, different endogenous and exogenous mutagenic

events lead to different types of nucleotide substitutions(Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J,
2002; Alexandrov et al., 2013, 2016; Farazi and DePinho, 2006; Kucab et al., 2019).
Second, the abilities to recognize, repair and tolerate different types of mutations are also
different(Frigola et al., 2017; Helleday et al., 2014). Third, although difficult to predict,
different nucleotide sequences surrounding the mutation site may cause local variances that
physically or chemically affect the ability for mutagens to attack. In addition, certain
sequences are also more prone to be edited by enzymes such as APOBEC(Buisson et al.,
2019; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012).Therefore, different flanking nucleotide sequences can also
affect mutation rate(Alexandrov et al., 2013; Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 2011; Ma et
al., 2010).
Taken together, the probability to generate different types of nucleotide change may
vary greatly. If two mutations both change the functional status of an important gene and
promote cancer, they should be selected for during cancer formation. However, if one of
such mutation is too difficult to generate at nucleotide level, the number of cancer cases
carrying this mutation will significantly decrease. Considering this, if we can define the
relative difficulty to generate each type of nucleotide mutations in cancer, we will be able
to better estimate the functional importance of cancer mutations.
Although mutational signatures for ageing, UV, APOBEC, smoking and other cancer
causes have been established, it is impossible to predict what percentage of cancers are
influenced by each signature, and to what extent. Therefore, the relative difficulty to
generate different types of mutation in cancer has not been established. In this report,
through analysis of mutational data from 26,000 cancer genomes, we established the

relative mutational difficulty for different types of cancer mutations, and showed that it can
help accurately interpret functional importance of cancer mutations.

Results
Defining relative mutational difficulties in human cancer
Although it is very difficult to construct a mathematical model that could weight in all
relevant factors to forwardly predict how much more difficult it is to generate one type of
mutation versus the other, such differences do factually exist, and they collectively
determined the mutation distributions in human cancer. Therefore, we argue that by
analyzing large human cancer genome dataset, we can reversely derive the relative
difficulties for each type of mutations (Fig. S1).
We retrieved mutation information for all human coding genes from the COSMIC
database. From the approximately 26,000 cancer samples (Fig. S2) that were subjected to
exome or whole-genome sequencing, more than 3 million single nucleotide mutations were
identified on protein coding sequences (Fig. 1A). Considering that some mutations such as
KRAS G12D and BRAF V600E are selectively enriched during cancer development,
which could skew our estimation of mutation tendency, we excluded mutational events that
occur in more than 5 cancer samples (see methods for discussion). This eliminated about
2% of mutations (Fig. 1A) and the remaining mutations were collated into different groups.
Overall, the number of C→T mutations and its complementary G→A mutations
constitute more than half of mutations in cancer (Fig. 1B). The rate of C→T mutation is 14
folds more than T-G mutation, demonstrating that the chances to generate each type of
mutations do vary significantly (Fig. 1B).

Importantly, to reach a systematic view of how neighboring sequences might affect
mutational tendency, we performed an extensive analysis, in which nucleotides at -2, -1,
+1 and +2 position were all taken into consideration. Consequently, mutations were divided
into 3072 groups (Table S1).
For example, the most likely to occur cancer mutation is C→T mutation on TTCGT
sequences, which appeared 10,563 times. There are approximately 575 million TTCGT
sequences in 26,000 coding genomes. Therefore, the chance of a C→T cancer mutation on
TTCGT sequences can be calculated as 1.85*10-5 (=10,563/575,000,000), which is about
200 folds more than the probability of A→C mutation in an ACATC sequence (Fig. 1C).
In other words, it is 200 times more “difficult” to generate the latter mutation in human
cancer. Similarly, such “difficulty” indexes were generated for all 3072 types of nucleotide
substitutions, which showed a wide distribution (Fig. 1C, S3 and Table S1). Analysis of
these difficulty indexes showed that in addition to nucleotides on -1 and +1 positions (Fig.
1D), the nucleotides on +2 and -2 positions can also exert significant impacts on mutational
tendency (Fig. 1E and Fig. S4). This indicates that it is important to incorporate the flanking
nucleotide sequences into analysis when assessing individual mutations.
Our analysis shows that different types of mutations are generated at remarkably
different rates (Fig. 1C). Given that the chance to generate different types of mutations can
vary by several hundred folds, it strongly suggests the need to reassess human cancer
mutations and our dataset will provide a useful tool.
To more precisely evaluate individual cancer mutations, we also took into
consideration that certain types of human malignancies, such as melanoma, endometrial

and colorectal cancers exhibit significantly higher mutation rates than other types of human
cancer(Schneider et al., 2017). Therefore, the same type of mutation may be generated at
significantly different rates in different types of cancer. Considering this, we generated
cancer type-specific mutational difficulty indexes with similar method (Fig. 1F, Fig. S5
and Table S2), which will enable precise assessment of cancer mutations.
Incorporating mutational difficulty to predict loss of function p53 mutations
We hypothesize that these “difficulty” indexes can serve as a valuable tool to predict
the functional importance of cancer mutations. For example, if an A→C mutation in an
ACATC sequence, despite the high difficulty, is still strongly selected for and appears in
noticeable number of cancer samples, it could indicate that such a mutation is significantly
enriched during cancer development. Therefore, such mutations may be crucial for cancer
development. On the other hand, certain easy-to-occur passenger mutations may appear
more common in cancer database, but their mutation counts may be more of a reflection of
the high mutational tendency, rather than their importance.
We applied this method to assess the functional impact of p53 missense mutations.
Several well-established p53 hotspot mutations account for about 27% of all p53 missense
mutations and are known to abolish gene function. Most of the less frequent p53 missense
mutations, although constituting the majority, are hard to predict in terms of their functional
impact. We factored in the aforementioned “mutational difficulty” to forwardly estimate
the functional importance of each mutation. For example, the M133R mutation is caused
by T→G substitution on a GATGT sequence, whose difficulty index is 233. This mutation
appeared in only 11 cancer samples in the COSMIC database. Given our argument, the

frequency of this M133R mutation may have been severely penalized by the high
mutational difficulty. Considering this, we designated M133R’s original count as 11 and
revised count as 2563 (=11233). Notably, the revised count for this mutation is
comparable to that of the hotspot R282W mutation (original count 609, difficulty index
3.31, revised count 2017). Since such a revised mutation count integrates both the original
count and mutational difficulty, it reflects the selective pressure for each mutation more
closely. Consequently, it will provide a better reading of their functional impacts.
To more precisely assess these p53 mutations, we also took into consideration that the
same type of mutations is generated at different rates in different cancer types (Fig. 1F).
Therefore, in our analysis we used cancer type-specific mutational difficulty indexes to
calculate the revised mutation count for each p53 mutation (see methods) (Table S3).
The global view of p53 missense mutations is provided in figure 2A. The map of p53
mutation original count is characterized by seven high peaks at R248 and R273, which are
crucial for interaction with DNA, as well as R175, Y220, G245, R249 and R282, which
are crucial for maintaining p53 structure. In the revised mutational count map, many more
such high peaks appeared, suggesting that other portions of p53 also contain numerous
amino acid residues that are essential for p53 function (Fig. 2A). Importantly, judging from
original counts, only a few p53 missense mutations occur more frequently than the hotspot
R282W mutation (Fig. 2B). After considering the mutational difficulty, more than 130 of
p53 missense mutations exhibit a higher revised count than R282W (Fig. 2B), suggesting
that many more p53 missense mutations potentially abolish gene function.

To establish a cut-off value that could help identify p53 mutants that still retain wild
type function, we compiled revised count values for all p53 synonymous mutations and
found them to be mostly below 700 (Fig. S6). Therefore, a revised count below 700 may
suggest wild type function for p53 mutants. We also estimated that a revised count over
900 might suggest loss of function. We constructed more than 80 low-frequency p53
mutants with various revised count values to test such hypothesis. The human
osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 carries homozygous deletion of p53. It could tolerate hotspot
p53 mutants but not wild type p53 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with our hypothesis, all p53
mutants with revised count values of less than 700 behaved like wild type p53 in this assay
(Fig. 2C), suggesting they do retain gene function as predicted by our method. For example,
the R282Q mutation (original count 36) is located on the functionally essential amino acid
residue R282. However, the underlying nucleotide substitution for this mutation is
relatively easy to occur, and with a revised count of 186, this mutant retained wild type p53
function. We also noticed that the R158H mutation, although observed in 95 cancer
samples, is an easy-to-occur mutation, and with a revised count lower than 700, this
mutation also retained wild type function. The high number of cancer samples carrying this
R158H mutation may be more of a result of the easiness of generating the underlying
mutation.
In contrast, certain high difficulty p53 mutations, although many of which only
occurring in less than 10 cancer samples, are predicted to be loss of function mutations
with revised counts over 900. We examined around 50 of such p53 mutations, and they
were all well tolerated by Saos-2 cells, confirming their loss-of-function status (Fig. 2C
and Fig. S7). This is consistent with our hypothesis that for certain functionally important,

but hard-to-occur mutations, their frequencies in cancer are greatly suppressed. Such
mutations tend to be overlooked in previous studies. After factoring in mutational difficulty,
we can predict the functional importance of such mutations.
We also noticed that, on P177, the P177L mutation (original count 24, revised count
262) retains wild type function (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, on the same residue is another
mutation P177R, which exhibit lower original count but much higher revised count
(original count=18, revised count=2887). Despite it being less frequent than P177L, it is
actually a loss-of-function mutation (Fig. 2D). Importantly, in our analysis we observed
multiple such cases that even on the same residue, less frequent mutations could be lossof-function, yet mutants with higher original counts retain wild type function. Examples
include R282Q/P, M160I/L, L130F/R, R158H/L and others (Fig. 2D). Such a reverse
phenomenon can be explained by their revised mutation counts, again demonstrating the
validity of our method.
To examine the biochemical function of these p53 mutants, we introduced them into
HCT116 p53-/- cell line, and tested whether DNA damage drugs can still induce the
expression of p21, a well-established p53 transcriptional target(el-Deiry et al., 1994).
Again, p53 mutants with revised counts lower than 700 behaved similarly to wild p53,
whereas p53 mutants with revised mutation counts higher than 900 behaved similarly to
hotspot mutants, failing to upregulate p21 upon DNA damage (Fig. S8)
Summarized in figure 2E, despite the common perception that high-impact mutations
appear more frequently in cancer database, the original mutation count is not a reliable
predictor of functional status. p53 mutants with original counts less than 100 can either be

loss of function mutants or retain wild type function. In contrast, the functional status of
p53 mutants are accurately predicted by their revised mutation counts, with a value lower
than 700 indicating wild type function, and a value higher than 900 indicating loss-offunction (Fig. 2F). This shows that by defining relative mutational difficulty, we can
provide novel tools to accurately assess cancer mutations.
Dominant negative effects of p53 mutants
It is known that human p53 hotspot mutations also exert dominant negative effect over
wild type p53(Willis et al., 2004). To explore whether such dominant negative effect also
exists for other p53 mutations, and whether our method could predict such dominant
negative effect, we established an experimental system using the E-Myc;p19Arf-/- mouse
lymphoma cell line. This cell line retains wild type p53, which can be activated by DNA
damage to induce cell death(Stott et al., 1998). Expression of hotspot p53 mutant together
with GFP was achieved in this cell line via retroviral vectors. Hotspot p53 exerts dominant
negative effects over endogenous wild type p53, and cells could not efficiently elicit cell
death when treated with DNA damaging drugs. As a result, the percentage of GFP-positive,
hotspot p53 mutant-expressing cells increased after drug treatment (Fig. 3A and 3B). In
contrast, expression of wild type p53 in this system moderately sensitized cells to DNA
damage drugs (Fig. 3B).
We cloned the murine versions of various human p53 mutants and tested whether they
exhibit dominant negative function. Importantly, all p53 mutants with revised counts lower
than 700 behaved like wild type p53 (Fig. 3C), whereas all p53 mutants with revised count
higher than 900 exhibited dominant negative effect (Fig. 3C). Again, as a predictor of

dominant negative effect, revised count performed significantly better than original
mutation count (Fig. 3, D and E).
We further tested whether our method can predict cancer-promoting abilities of p53
mutants in vivo. Using a tail-vein hydrodynamic injection method, together with a
transposon system(Chen et al., 2007) and CRISPR gene editing (Yang et al., 2014), Myc
overexpression and PTEN knockout was achieved in the liver of wild type FVB mice.
Under such condition, no mice developed liver tumor at 3 weeks. Addition of R246S
murine p53 mutant, which mimics the human R249S hotspot mutation, overrode
endogenous wild type p53 in mice liver and caused massive tumors (Fig. 3F). Using this
setting, we tested eight p53 mutants. Consistent with our prediction, four mutants with
revised counts lower than 700, including the rather frequent R158H mutation (original
count 95), all behaved like wild type p53 and caused no tumors. In contrast, four p53
mutants with high revised mutation counts all caused massive liver tumors in mice (Fig.
3F), indicating they were able to override endogenous wild type p53 to promote cancer.
Functional importance of several regions on p53 structure highlighted by our method
Our results suggest there are many low frequency p53 mutations with significant
functional impacts. To better understand their general distribution, using the revised counts
of p53 hotspot mutation sites as controls, we mapped these high-impact mutations on the
three-dimensional structure of p53. Known p53 hotspot mutations are located on the
interfaces that are crucial for p53 structure and interaction with DNA. We first noticed that
many residues adjacent to hotspot sites, such as V173, H178, M246, V274 and A276,
although with rather low original mutation counts, showed very high revised counts (Fig.
13

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/789313; this version posted October 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

4A and Fig. S9A). This observation suggests that many residues surrounding hotspot sites
are in fact also essential for p53 function. These crucial sites are rarely mutated in cancer,
because their mutation frequencies are severely penalized by high mutational difficulty.
In addition to these residues, several other regions of p53 stood out with high revised
mutation counts. One of such rarely-mutated, high impact region is residues 130 to 138,
which form a β strand and loop structure that lays closely to a β strand-loop-helix domain
(amino acids 270-282), which host several hotspot mutations and are responsible for DNAinteraction(Eldar et al., 2013; Follis et al., 2014) (Fig. 4B). Other high impact amino acids
identified by this method are five β strands that formed the central β-barrel of p53. On the
three-dimensional structure of p53, such amino acids are also very close to AA173-179
and AA244-249, both hosting hotspot mutations(Walker et al., 1999) (Fig. 4C and Fig S9B).
Colony formation assays in Saos-2 cells confirmed that many rare, but difficult-to-generate
mutations on these sites disrupt p53 function (Fig 4D). Such mutations were also tested in
the E-Myc;p19Arf-/- system and exhibited dominant negative effects over wild type p53
(Fig 3C). Taken together, our method is able to regroup p53 mutations by integrating
mutational difficulty, and points to additional regions that are crucial for the function of
p53.
Predicting the functional status of PTEN and INK4A mutations
Next, we asked whether this method could be applied to other established cancer genes
such as PTEN and INK4a. We cloned about 20 low-frequency PTEN and INK4A
mutations and expressed them in PTEN or INK4A deficient cancer cell lines to see whether
such mutations abolish gene function. As predicted by our method, those mutations with
14

low revised counts retained wild type function, whereas those mutations with high revised
counts caused gene loss of function (Fig. 5A-C).
For example, high difficulty mutations including PTEN Y27N, C124S and I135K,
although each only occurring in 5 cancer samples in COSMIC, could not suppress AKT
signaling, proving that they all abolish PTEN function (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the PTEN
R173C and R173H mutations, despite being the fifth and sixth most common PTEN
mutations and occurring in 47 and 36 cancer samples, both retained wild-type function (Fig.
5A). According to our method, both are low-difficulty mutations, which explains why they
did not disrupt PTEN function despite being detected in significantly more cancer samples.
This observation, together with finding that p53 R158H mutation (original count 95,
revised count 673) also retains wild type function, demonstrate that our method not only
help identify rare mutations that promotes cancer, it can also point out high frequency,
passenger type mutations in cancer database.
Potential implications for cancer prevention
In addition to establishing a method that could help evaluate individual cancer
mutations in a sequence- and cancer type-specific manner, we also asked whether our
method can help understand cancer etiology in general. In our analysis of human cancer
mutations, we noticed that the vast majority of common mutations on tumor suppressors,
such as p53, PTEN, FBXW7 and SMAD4 are low-difficulty mutations (Fig. 6A). 77% of
these common, low difficulty mutations are C to T or its complementary G to A mutations
on CpG sequence, which could be the results of spontaneous deamination(Rideout et al.,

15

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/789313; this version posted October 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

1990). From a cancer prevention point of view, it will be rather hard to prevent such type
of deleterious events on tumor suppressors.
In contrast, except for IDH1/2 and AKT1, common mutations on oncogenes such as
KRAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, PI3KCA and JAK2 are typically high-difficulty mutations (Fig.
6A’). Only 14% of common cancer-promoting mutations on oncogenes are C to T or G to
A mutations on CpG sequences. About half of common cancer-promoting mutations on
oncogenes require purine to pyrimidine changes or vice versa. Such type of changes cannot
be caused by simple chemical reactions such as deamination of the nucleobase. Rather,
Strong exogenous carcinogenic events are probably needed to damage DNA to eventually
create such types of mutation. Limiting the exposure to environmental carcinogens, as well
as managing long-term inflammation, among many potential measures, may significantly
reduce the chance of obtaining activating mutations on oncogenes in general. This will
significant deplete the driving force of cancer and impede cancer development. Therefore,
even though two third of mutations in human cancer are caused by spontaneous events
(Tomasetti et al., 2017), avoiding environmental carcinogenic factors holds great promises
to significantly reduce the incidence of many types of cancer.
On the other hand, certain types of cancers will still be hard to prevent. For example,
the driver mutations on the oncogenes IDH1 and IDH2 are both low-difficulty, C to T or
G to A mutations (Fig. 6A’). Therefore, cancer cases associated with such mutations, for
example subtypes of glioblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia
(Borger et al., 2011; Dang et al., 2010) may be hard to prevent. Similar to the argument by
Tomasetti et al (Tomasetti et al., 2017), for these types of cancer early detection holds more
promise than cancer prevention methods.

Lastly, it is apparent that low difficulty, spontaneous mutations on tumor suppressors
contribute to human cancer, most significantly through several easy-to-mutate sites on p53
(Fig. 6A). From a pure theoretical point of view, it is possible to introduce synonymous
mutations to these sites to render them more resistant to deleterious mutations. We
analyzed the potential benefits of changing the nucleotide coding sequence on p53 hotspot
sites. For example, changing the p53 R273 sequence from R(CGT) to R(AGA) will reduce
the chance of generating loss of function mutations on this site by seven folds (Fig. 6B).
For four other mutational hotspots on p53, similar codon changes can also significantly
reduce the chance of generating loss of function mutations (Fig. S11) and are projected to
greatly reduce cancer cases involving these hotspot sites (Fig. 6C-D). If theoretically,
spontaneous low-difficulty mutations on p53 can be limited by such measures, and highdifficulty mutations on oncogenes and other sites of p53 can be thwarted by avoiding
environmental carcinogens, it may dramatically reduce cancer incidence.

Discussion
Significant differences of mutational difficulties in human cancer
The functional importance of a mutation to cancer can be reflected by its selective
enrichment in cancer samples. However due to the lack of understanding of relative
mutational difficulty in cancer, most studies use mutation frequency in cancer database to
directly calculate selective pressure. Our analysis shows that, depending on the type of
nucleotide substitution and the surrounding sequences, the chances of generating different
types of mutations can vary by as much as 400 folds (Fig 1C). Such a drastic difference

highlights the need to re-approach how we calculate the selective pressure for each cancer
mutation, and consequently how to interpret the functional importance of such mutations.
Many factors contributed to the fact that different types of nucleotide substitutions are
created at rather different rates(Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, 2002). Given the complex
nature of these processes, relative mutational difficulties for different types of mutations,
as well as their impact on how to interpret human cancer genome have not been established.
In this report, through analysis of large number of human cancer genomes, we reversely
derived the relative difficulties for each type of mutation. We also established such
numbers in a cancer type-specific manner. Such dataset will be a useful tool to understand
cancer genome.
For most genes, close to 30,000 cancer samples have been analyzed and deposited in
the COSMIC database. Certain easy-to-occur mutations may simply accumulate in a
number of cancer samples without provide advantages for cancer development. In the
future, when increased number of cancer genomes are deposited to COSMIC database, it
is expected that more and more easy-to-occur passenger mutations will pile up on the
mutation histogram. Without considering relative mutational difficulty, these seemingly
“mutational peaks” may lead to erroneous assumptions that they are cancer-driving
mutations.
To functionally estimate the importance of novel cancer mutations, the cancer types
that host such mutations should also be taken into consideration. As illustrated in figure S2,
for many types of mutations, it is much easier to generate them in skin, colorectal and
endometrial cancers. On the other hand, some types of mutations are more difficult to

generate in these cancer types (Fig. S3A). Therefore, if the original count of a cancer
mutation is primarily contributed by skin, colorectal and endometrial cancer samples, such
mutations should be viewed with caution. However, they should not be automatically
devalued either.
Functional landscape of p53 mutations in human cancer
Our results suggest that, in addition to hotspot mutation sites, there are numerous
other amino acid residues also crucial for p53 function. Mutations on these residues are
rare because it is too difficult to generate inactivating mutations on them. By
incorporating relative mutational difficulty, we can re-establish the functional importance
of such sites and discover many rare, but cancer-promoting p53 mutations. We also
observed dominant negative effects for many p53 missense mutations (Fig. 3C), which is
consistent with recent findings by Boettcher et al(Boettcher et al., 2019). This led to
recognitions of amino acid residues and structural regions crucial for p53 function (Fig.
4), which will help further understand this important tumor suppressor.
Based on our analysis, we estimate that out of the 1219 types of missense p53
mutations in COMIC database, 27% are loss of function mutations and 70% retain wild
type function. In addition, out of the 19598 p53-mutated cancer samples in COSMIC
database, 83% contain loss of function p53 mutation and 15% retain wild type p53
function.
The FATHMM(Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models)
method(Shihab et al., 2013), which estimate functional impact based on sequence
conservation and the overall tolerance of the protein/domain to mutations, has been

commonly used to predict cancer-driving mutations. Such a method is used by COSMIC
to annotate cancer mutations. With regards to p53 mutations, comparison of our
prediction results with FATHMM method showed only 50% overlap (Fig. S10 and Table
S4).
Interestingly, in a recent publication, thousands of different types of p53 mutants
were introduced to cancer cells, and the functional status of these p53 mutations were
assessed by whether these mutations were tolerated by cells under different
conditions(Giacomelli et al., 2018). Such dataset provides direct experimental readout of
p53 mutations. Our predictions of the functionality of p53 mutations are highly similar to
these experimental results, with a 88% overlap (Fig. S10). The 12% p53 mutations that
are differently predicted (Table S5) may have come from wrong predictions by our
method, or from small inaccuracies of such pool-based large-scale studies.
In the Giacomelli et al report, integrating mutational signatures of aging,
APOBEC, smoking, UV, mismatch repair deficiencies and alatoxin, a model was trained
to fit the mutational landscape of p53 in human cancer. In that model, for each p53
mutation, different sets of weights were assigned for each signature. Our analysis, by
defining relative mutational difficulties, provides an straightforward method to predict
the funtional importance of p53 mutations. This method can also be readily applied to
PTEN, INK4A (Fig.5) as well.
In summary, our study provided estimates of relative mutational difficulties in human
cancer. Such information may help further understand cancer formation, bringing new tools

for discovering cancer-promoting mutations. Moreover, such kind of analysis may also
yield additional perspectives on cancer prevention.

Methods and Material
Data acquisition. Mutation data from 26,154 cancer genomes were retrieved from
COSMIC website in January 2018. If a gene has multiple isoforms, only the major form
was included in our analysis such that mutations on the same sites are not counted multiple
times. For 19,940 genes, 3,101,161 single nucleotide substitutions were identified. In order
to calculate the natural mutational tendency, we first eliminated mutational events that
occur more than 5 times in the dataset. These mutations may have been selectively enriched
during cancer development and may interfere with our calculation. A total of 65,594
mutational events involving 6,019 sites were removed, which represent 2% of mutations.
Detailed analysis of this point is provided in figure S2.
To assess the influence of neighboring sequences on mutational tendency, sequences of the
coding genome corresponding to the 19,940 genes were downloaded from Ensemble
(GRCh38.p10). For each nucleotide mutation, -2, -1, +1, +2 nucleotides were extracted
from the corresponding coding sequence.
Types of mutations. At the central position, there are 12 routes of interchange between
A/G/T/C. The permutations at -2, -1, +1, +2 nucleotides amount to 44. Therefore, we
collated all mutations into 1244=3072 groups.
Calculation of Mutational tendency. For the aforementioned 3072 groups, we first
counted how many mutations from the 26,154 cancer genomes belong to each group. Next,
we counted how many times each penta-nucleotide sequence appears in coding sequences
of the 19,940 genes. For example, there are 10,389 C→T mutations on TTCGT sequences
in 26,154 coding genomes. There are 21446TTCGT sequences per coding genome.

Therefore, the mutational tendency of C→T on TTCGT is approximately 10389/
(2144626154) =1.85 10-5, which is the highest amongst all 3072 combinations. We set
the “difficulty” score for such a mutation as 1. The mutational tendency of A→C mutation
in a CGATG sequence is 0.9310-7, and its relative difficulty score is calculated as
1.8510-5/0.9310-7 = 200. Difficulty scores for all other combinations were generated
accordingly.
In the above analysis, we aim to estimate the natural mutational tendency for each type of
mutation in human cancer. Certain cancer-promoting mutations on genes such as KRAS
and BRAF are strongly selected for during cancer formation. The number of such
mutations are significantly increased in the dataset, not because they are easy to generate,
but because they are strongly enriched by the tumorigenesis process. Therefore, their
presence in the dataset may skew our estimation of the natural mutational tendency for
each type of mutation. Considering this, in the above calculation, we excluded mutations
that occur in more than 5 cancer sample, in order to achieve a closer estimate of mutational
tendency. Of note, about 2% all of mutations in the 26,000 cancer genomes (Fig. 1A) occur
in more than 5 cancer samples and were excluded in our analysis.
Fig.S3 shows the comparison of mutational difficulties calculated with and without
excluding such recurrent mutations. In Fig.S3A, if no mutations are excluded, the
mutational difficulty scores for KRAS G12R, BRAF V600E and HIF1A K213Q, among
many others, will be significantly lower. In Fig. S3B, if only excluding mutations that occur
in more than 20 samples, the mutational difficulty scores for TP53 V157G, NOTCH1
D573A, CDKN2A A36G, among others, will still be significantly lower. In Fig. S3C, if

only excluding mutations that occur in more than 10 samples, the mutational difficulty
scores for TP53 Y126D, KDM6A T794P, PIK3CA V344G, among others, will still be
noticeably lower. Based on this, we calculated mutational difficulty after excluding
mutations that occur in more than 5 samples.
Lastly, the numbers of different penta-nucleotides in the coding genome vary greatly. For
example, in the coding genome there are 3,001 TAGCG sequences and more than 100,000
TGGAG sequences. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the number of mutations by the
number of available sites to accurately understand the relative mutational difficulty.
Cancer type-specific mutational difficulty. To generate cancer type-specific mutational
difficulty scores, mutations were first grouped by cancer types, from which mutation rates
were calculated using similar methods. For example, we observed 1,195 C→T mutations
on TTCGT sequences in 296 endometrial cancer samples, and the mutational tendency of
C→T on TTCGT is approximately 1.8810-4 in endometrial cancer. Since in previous
calculation we set the mutational difficulty score as 1 for a mutation rate of 1.85 10-5, we
can calculate the relative mutational difficulty for C→T on TTCGT as 0.1 (=1.85 105

/1.8810-4) in endometrial cancer. This method was also used to calculate mutational

difficulty for other cancer types.
Analysis of p53, PTEN, INK4A mutations. Mutational data for p53, PTEN and INK4A
was last acquired from COSMIC on January 2018. At the time, p53 was sequenced in
130,448 cancer samples, PTEN in 72,199 samples and INK4A in 72,566 samples. Current
numbers in COSMIC database have slightly increased due to website updates.

Of note, the CDKN2A locus contains two genes, INK4A and ARF. Previous studies
showed that recurrent mutations on the CDKN2A locus do not change the function of the
ARF gene(Quelle et al., 1997). In addition, U251 cells, which deleted the CDKN2A locus,
could tolerate ARF expression, but not INK4A expression. Therefore, for later
experimental validation, we cloned and analyzed INK4A mutants in this study.
For each mutation, we first extracted the penta-nucleotide sequence surrounding the
mutation site, and matched it with relative mutational difficulty scores. For mutational sites
that are adjacent to intro-exon junctions, the genomic sequence was used to extract the
nucleotide sequences surrounding the mutational site.
Next, we calculated the revised mutational count based on original mutation count and
cancer type-specific relative mutational difficulty. For example, if a p53 mutation occurs
in 10 colorectal cancers and 5 lung cancers, and the relative mutational difficulties for the
mutation is 1 and 3 in colorectal and lung cancer respectively, the revised count for such a
mutation can be calculated as 101 + 53 = 25.
Figure S6 shows the distribution of revised mutation counts for all p53 synonymous
mutation based on COSMIC data. For most of these synonymous mutations, the revised
counts are below 700. Therefore, we estimate that those missense p53 mutations with
revised count below 700 retain wild type p53 function, which were validated with further
experiments. In Figure S6, we also observed that the revised counts of several p53
synonymous mutations exceeded 700. This is due to the fact that certain p53 synonymous
mutations abolish p53 function. For example, the p53 T125T mutation (c.375 G to A/C/T)
disrupts the adjacent intron-exon splice site, and abolishes gene function(Supek et al.,
25

2014). The revised count for T125T is 1353, and is predicted to be a loss of function
mutation by our method.
Table S3 listed the original and revised counts of p53 mutations based on COSMIC
database. If a mutation’s revised count is lower than 700, it is predicted to retain wild type
function. If a mutation’s revised count is higher than 900, it is predicted to be loss of
function mutation. A few exceptions exist and are explained below.
In the COSMIC database, the S149F mutation on p53 is caused by single nucleotide
substitution in 5 samples, and the revised count is lower than 700. However, in one
additional cancer sample, a CC to TT nucleotide change also caused the S149F mutation.
Because of the rarity of such double mutations, we did not assign relative mutational
difficulty score to such double mutations. Therefore, we cannot make functional prediction
for this mutant, and a "*" is marked in the “revised count” column for S127F. Such
phenomenon also occurred for S166L, V218M and R158C, and these mutations are labeled
similarly with a “*” in Table S3. Several other mutations (for example R282W) also
exhibited such double nucleotide substitution, however their revised counts calculated
from single nucleotide substitutions already exceeded 900. Therefore, such mutations are
predicted to be loss of function mutations in Table S3.
GFP-based cell survival competition assay to determine sensitivity change caused by
p53 mutants. The experiment was carried out with a protocol modified from(Bruno et al.,
2017). Briefly, Eμ-Myc p19Arf−/− cells are infected with retrovirus that express GFP and
mutant p53, such that 20-50% of cells are GFP positive. Cells are treated with DNA
damage drug at doses that would kill 80-90% of uninfected Eμ-Myc p19Arf−/− cells. In

this assay, if p53 mutant exerts dominant negative effects on endogenous wild type p53 in
Eμ-Myc p19Arf−/− cells, after DNA damage drug treatment the GFP positive, p53 mutantexpressing cells will be relatively more resistant than GFP negative cells that only express
wild type p53. At 72 h, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by flow cytometry. GFP
percentages of live (PI-negative) cells are recorded and used to calculate relative resistance
index.
Calculation of relative resistance/sensitivity from GFP-based cell survival
competition assay.
The value of relative resistance index (RI) can be calculated as RI=(G2-G1*G2)/(G1G1*G2). G1 means how many percentages of cells are GFP positive before drug treatment.
G2 means how many percentages of cells are GFP positive after drug treatment. The
explanation for such calculation was provided in (Jiang et al., 2011).
Relative resistance index larger than 1 means the corresponding p53 mutant displayed
dominant negative effect, protected cells from DNA damage, and the rate of GFP+ cells in
surviving cells increased after drug treatment. Relative resistance index smaller than 1
means the corresponding p53 mutant displayed wild type function, sensitized cells to DNA
damage, and the rate of GFP+ cells in surviving cells decreased.
Cell lines and drugs. Eμ-Myc p19Arf −/− cell was cultured in B-cell medium (45%
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 45% Iscove's modified Dulbecco's media,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamate, and 5 μM β-mercaptoenthanol).
Phoenix, HCT116 p53-/-, Saos-2, U251, A549, 293T and 293A were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamate and 10% (v/v) FBS.

786-O cell was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with glutamate and 10% (v/v)
FBS.
Saos-2, HCT116 p53-/-, U251, 786-O cells were obtained from the Cell Bank, China
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Doxorubicin was purchased from Selleck.
Antibodies. Antibodies against Phospho-Akt (Thr308) (D25E6) (Cell signaling, #13038),
Akt (pan) (C67E7) (Cell signaling, #4691), Phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) (D84E12) (Cell
signaling, #5558), Phospho-PDK1 (Ser241) (C49H2) (Cell signaling, #3438) , PTEN (pan)
(Y184) (Abcam, #32199) were used for Western blot analysis.
Cloning of p53, PTEN and INK4A mutants. Wild-type p53, INK4a and PTEN
expression vectors were constructed as follows. The full-length open reading frame of p53,
INK4a and PTEN cDNAs were amplified by PCR using KOD plus neo DNA polymerase
(Code No.KOD-401 Lot No.646300) and a pair of primers with EcoRI and XhoI sites. The
PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pMSCV-IRES-GFP
vector. cDNAs with missense mutations were constructed by overlap extension PCR. All
of the plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutations had been
incorporated and that no additional mutations were generated.
All p53, INK4a and PTEN mutants tested in this study are listed in Table S6.
Colony formation assay. To test the functional status of p53 mutants, retrovirus that
expresses p53 mutants, puromycin resistance gene and GFP was used to infect Saos-2 cells.
Cells are infected with similar virus MOI such that 30-50% of cells are GFP positive for
all experimental groups. 5000 GFP-positive Saos-2 cells were resuspended in medium

containing 10% FBS and plated in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, they were treated with
2ug/ml puromycin. 24 hours later, puromycin-containing medium was replaced with fresh
complete culture medium. 5 days later, 2ug/ml puromycin was again used to treat cells for
24h before removal. Cells are cultured for an additional 10 days. Colonies were then fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Stained cell
colonies were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for three times and dried.
Images were obtained by a digital camera. Similar protocols were used to test INK4a
mutants in U251 cells.
Mouse liver cancer model. Myc cDNA and p53 mutants were cloned into a transposon
system using the PT3 vector(Chen et al., 2007). Such plasmids were mixed with sgPTENCas9 plasmid(Yang et al., 2014), together with Sleeping Beauty transposase-expressing
plasmid in PBS. Gene mixture was delivered to mouse by tail vain hydrodynamic injection.
A rapid tail vein injection protocol, which delivers 2ml of PBS-plasmid solution in 7
seconds, introduced these plasmids into mouse liver cells. Under such conditions, PTEN is
disrupted by sgPTEN and Cas9, and cDNAs of Myc and p53 mutants are integrated into
host cell’s chromosomes by the transposon system. Concentrations of Sleeping Beauty
transposase and Myc-expressing plasmids were at 0.5μg/ml and 1.25μg/ml, respectively.
Other plasmids or corresponding empty vectors were used at 5μg/ml. Wild type FVB mice
were used in this experiment.
Cell cycle analysis. U251 cells expressing wild type or mutant forms of INK4a were
analyzed. When grew to proper density (about 70-80%), cells were collected and fixed
overnight in 70% ethanol. Cells were then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml
propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A for 40 minutes, and analyzed by FACS.

(A) An experimental system to analyze dominant negative effects of p53 mutations. A
murine lymphoma cell line that retain wild type p53 is partially infected by retrovirus that
express p53 mutants and GFP.
(B) If the p53 mutants exert dominant negative effect over endogenous wild type p53, it
will render cells more resistant to DNA damage induced by doxorubicin, and the rate of
GFP-positive cells increases in surviving cell population. Expression of wild type p53
moderately sensitizes cells to doxorubicin treatment.
(C-E) Revised counts, but not original counts of p53 mutants correctly predicts whether
such mutants exhibit dominant negative effects. Murine p53 mutants corresponding to
human p53 mutants were used in these experiments.
(F) Revised counts correctly predict whether p53 mutants can promote liver cancer
formation in vivo. The original and revised counts are listed below each mutant, separated
by a “/” mark. Murine p53 mutants corresponding to human p53 mutants were used in this

are highly selectively enriched in cancer. The number of such mutations are significantly
increased in the dataset, not because they are easy to generate, but because they are
strongly enriched during the tumorigenesis process. Therefore, their presence in the
dataset may skew our estimation of the natural mutational tendency for each type of
mutation. In our analysis, we excluded cancer mutations that occur in more than 5 cancer
samples. The above panels show if no mutations are excluded (A), excluding mutations
that occur in more than 20 (B) or 10 (C) samples, what is the impact on calculation of
relative mutational difficulty. For example, if no mutations are excluded, the mutational
difficulty for T to A substitution on a AGTGA sequence, which underlies the BRAF
V600E mutation, will appear significantly lower. Several other similar examples are
marked out in the above panels.

Figure S10. Comparison of functional predictions based on different methods.
FATHMM annotation of p53 mutants are available at individual p53 mutation page on
COSMIC site. 48% of what our method predicted to be wild type function or loss of
function mutations are predicted in the same manner by the FATHMM method. PHANTM,
Phenotypic Annotation of TP53 Mutations (http://mutantp53.broadinstitute.org/) provides
functional assessment of individual p53 mutant, based on Giacomelli et al 2019. In that
study, an extensive library of p53 mutants was introduced into cells, which were then
treated under different conditions. The funtional status of p53 mutants was estimated based
on whether they are tolerated by cells, as determined by massively parralle
sequencing.Prediction by our method, which takes relative mutational difficulty into
consideration, are highly consistent with the PHANTM results, with an 88% overlap. P53
mutations whose functional status are differently annotated between our method and
FATHMM or PHANTM are listed in Table S4 and S5 respectively.

wild type p53 function are shown in white. Shown here are analysis results for R175, G245,
R248 and R282, and results for R273 is shown in Fig. 6B. Of note, the high mutation rate
on G245 is enabled by the preceding codon G244, resulting in a nucleotide sequence
(GCGGC) that is highly prone to G to A mutation, which causes the G245 (GGC) codon
to be a hotspot mutation site. Change the G244 codon from GGC to GGT will decrease the
mutation tendency of G245, without increasing mutation tendency of G244.
