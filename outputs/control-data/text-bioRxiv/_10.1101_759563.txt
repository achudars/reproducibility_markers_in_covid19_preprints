Abstract

20

The Athlete’s Biological Passport (ABP) is a tool for the indirect detection of blood doping. Current

21

guidelines from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) require a delay of 2 hours after any physical

22

exercise and to be seated for 10 minutes prior to any blood sampling to obtain a valid measurement.

23

Since body position prior to and during phlebotomy may influence the outcome, this study compared

24

blood biomarker variations with changes in body position during blood sample collection. Ten

25

successive venous blood samples from 38 subjects of 3 groups (elite cyclists, apnea divers and controls)

26

in three situations (seated, after a 50 m walk, and supine) were collected and analyzed via flow

27

cytometry. While reticulocytes percentage was unchanged in all conditions, haemoglobin

28

concentration and hematocrit were stable after at least 10 min in a seated position. Due to shifts in

29

plasma volume, the measures were significantly higher after changing posture for a short walk, but

30

readjusted to previous levels after only 5 min. Supine position caused generally lower values after 10-

31

30 min. The results support the current guidelines and additionally provide evidence to adjust the

32

waiting time for blood sampling after short changes in posture.

Introduction

34

Nearly 30000 blood samples are collected yearly for the athlete biological passport (ABP). The ABP

35

tracks blood markers longitudinally and based on changes in these variables, helps identifying

36

patterns of doping (Sottas, Robinson et al. 2011, Vernec 2014). However, despite remarkable results

37

since its implementation, athletes are getting used to fine-tuning doping methods to circumvent the

38

ABP testing strategies. Actually, it is now certain that athletes adapted their protocols using rather first

39

generation of rhEPO and frequent micro-dosing in the evening to maintain a supraphysiological level

40

of haemoglobin while reducing the chances of being tested positive (Hamilton and Coyle 2012).

41

Therefore, accurate and precise measurement of blood variables with low bias are paramount to

42

ensure the indirect detection and targeting potential of the ABP. The blood matrix as a suspension of

43

living cells in plasma transports oxygen to the working muscles. Variations in the fluid balance and thus

44

plasma volume may inevitably alter variables for which concentration values are reported (e.g.,

45

haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) or haematocrit (Hct)) while absolute measures (e.g., reticulocytes

46

percentage (Ret%)) remain stable (Fahraeus 1929, Ahlgrim, Pottgiesser et al. 2010). Significant shifts

47

in plasma volume were hence reported in connection with many situations of an athletes’ daily life

48

such as acute physical exercise, heat exposure, psychological stress and/or postural changes (Harrison

49

1975, Harrison and Edwards 1976, Collins, Hill et al. 1986, Imelik and Mustimets 1992, Lundvall and

50

Bjerkhoel 1995, Bloomer and Farney 2013). Acute or chronic plasmatic volume variations may also

51

occur with endurance training periods (Sawka, Convertino et al. 2000), repeated sauna bathing

52

(Stanley, Halliday et al. 2015), during altitude acclimatization (Sawka, Young et al. 1996) or hypoxic

53

exposure with a high individual variability (Young, Karl et al. 2019). Overall, this underlines the

54

numerous confounding factors affecting concentration based blood markers and the need for robust

55

procedures to limit pre-analytical variations when analysed for the ABP. For instance, the World Anti-

56

Doping Agency (WADA) enacted specific blood collection guidelines (WADA 2016) in addition to

57

precise Blood Analytical Requirements for the Athlete Biological Passport (WADA 2009). Currently, the

58

guidelines specify that 2 h waiting is necessary after any physical exercise and require the athletes to

59

be seated for 10 min before sample collection to allow the vascular volumes to equilibrate. Effects of

60

posture upon blood volume and composition have been extensively investigated (Thompson,

61

Thompson et al. 1928). Recent updates highlight the need for standardization because position

62

changes may rapidly alter plasma volume (Lippi, Salvagno et al. 2015, Lima-Oliveira, Guidi et al. 2017).

63

In an antidoping context, a prior study investigated if 10 min of seating was enough to guarantee stable

64

[Hb] and Hct readings for the ABP (Ahlgrim, Pottgiesser et al. 2010).

65

In a more general context, the world health organizations’ current best practice for blood drawing

66

recommends to “make the patient comfortable in a supine position (if possible)” (World Health

67

Organisation 2010). The latter is however, not the standard for blood collection in an antidoping

68

context but might be more comfortable for certain athletes.

69

The aim of this study was thus to investigate the influence of body position prior to and during

70

phlebotomy in this context (i.e. seated vs. supine). To improve practical application, this study assessed

71

if a short position change (e.g., walking a short distance from a waiting room to the sample collection

72

site) influences the readings and may thus be acceptable in the context of the normal antidoping blood

73

sample collection sequence.

Material and methods

76

Study subjects

77

Thirty-eight non-smoking healthy Caucasian subjects were included in this study in three groups: 10

78

elite cyclists (Cyc, 10 males), 12 trained apnea divers (Apn, 7 males, 5 females) and 16 moderately

79

trained control subjects (Con, sport sciences students, 9 males, 7 females). The Cyc group included

80

International Elite licensed cyclists successful at an international level (e.g., UCI World Tour races or

81

UCI World Cup participations) in road, track, and mountain-bike events . The Apn group included apnea

82

divers with a regular practice of apnea training (i.e. at least two weekly training sessions with or

83

without immersion), competing at a national or international level (breath holding experience 8 ± 2.3

84

yrs). Inclusion criteria for the control group was a total weekly volume of aerobic sport activities (e.g.,

85

running, triathlon, ski-cross country) not exceeding 4 hours. Participants living permanently at an

86

altitude above 800 m were also excluded. The procedure and risks were fully explained to the subjects,

87

and all of them gave their written consents to participate in this study. This study was approved by the

88

local ethics committee (CCER-VD, Lausanne, Switzerland, Agreement 2018-01019) and conducted in

89

respect of the Declaration of Helsinki.

90

Study design, pre-analytical conditions and hematological analyses

91

To mimic as closely as possible an ABP blood sample collection, the current WADA guidelines on

92

analytical procedures were strictly followed (WADA 2016). A total of 10 successive blood samples were

93

collected from each subject over a single visit of 70 minutes in the same sequence. The study design

94

is illustrated in Figure 1. At least 2 hours after any physical activity or exercise training, subjects

95

reported to the laboratory as part of their daily activity. Room temperature was kept constant in the

96

laboratory at approx. 21° C.

97

A 10-min period of normalized activity was imposed upon arrival to the laboratory: walking 1 min,

98

sitting down to read a newspaper (4 min), walking down the stairs one floor and up again (1 min),

99

waiting in a standing position (2 min) before walking to the phlebotomy lab (2 min). Subjects were

100

then asked to sit down and a first blood sample was taken within 1 min (B1). Subsequently, subjects

101

remained seated for 10 min and were requested to fill in a food and exercise training diary for the last

102

24 hours prior to the laboratory visit to control for their activity and hydration status. A second blood

103

sample was taken after 10 min seated (B2). In an antidoping context, this sample typically corresponds

104

to a reference sample that could have been collected for an ABP analysis. Subjects were then asked to

105

stand up and walk exactly 50 m before a third sample was drawn in order to mimic a situation where

106

an athlete in a waiting room would have to change seat for the blood collection (B3). After 5 and 10

107

minutes in the seated position, two other samples were drawn (B4 & B5). Immediately after, subjects

108

were requested to replicate the initial 10-min period of standardized activity before lying down on an

109

examination table and remaining in a supine position with the head slightly above the rest of the body

110

(back of the examination table angle of 30°). Blood samples were then taken exactly after 5, 10, 15, 20

111

and 30 minutes in the supine position (B6-B10).

“Butterfly” 21G needles with a short manifold were inserted in one of the antecubital veins (Sarstedt

116

Safety-Multifly®, Sarstedt AG, Nuembrecht, Germany) after proper disinfection of the site. Intravenous

117

access using a butterfly was preferred to reduce hemolysis (Barnaby, Wollowitz et al. 2016). A

118

tourniquet was used as standard to facilitate puncture and removed once the butterfly was inserted

119

in the antecubital vein and fixed with medical tape. Tourniquet time was approx. 25 s and never

120

exceeded 60 s as required by the WADA guidelines (WADA 2016). Blood was collected in two EDTA-

121

coated tubes (Sarstedt S-Monovette 2.7 ml, Sarstedt AG, Nuernbrecht, Germany). The first tube served

122

to purge the butterfly manifold and was thrown. Tubes were inverted 10 times directly after blood

123

collection in order to ensure proper mixing with the anti-coagulant. All blood samples were collected

124

by the same experienced phlebotomist throughout the study. In the case of a blood clot in the butterfly

125

manifold, another puncture on another site was made. Four samples were collected in the seated

126

position from one arm and the subsequent 6 blood samples in the supine position from the other arm.

127

The first arm was chosen randomly.

128

Blood variables were determined via flow cytometry using a fully automated cell counter (Sysmex

129

XN1000, Sysmex Europe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). Internal quality controls provided by the

130

manufacturer) were run before each analytical batch as described thoroughly elsewhere (Robinson,

131

Saugy et al. 2018). Once collected, blood samples were stored in a fridge at 4° C for a time lasting

132

between 30 minutes and 12 hours. All samples from one single subject were subsequently analyzed at

133

the same time as part of the same batch after being rolled during 15 minutes at room temperature for

134

homogenization and temperature stabilization purposes. All samples were analyzed at least twice in

135

order to ensure valid recording of [Hb] and Ret% according to the WADA guideline in force (WADA

136

2019).

137

At the end of the blood sampling procedure, circulating volumes (e.g. blood volume, plasma volume,

138

and total hemoglobin mass (Hbmass)) was measured with a carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing

139

technique with a fully automated system (OpCo: Detalo Instruments, Birkerod, Denmark) as described

140

elsewhere (Siebenmann, Keiser et al. 2017)

141

Plasma volume changes (DPV) were calculated using the formula introduced by Dill and Costill (Costill

142

and Fink 1974): DPV % = 100.

143

[Hb] and Hct measured at B2 (i.e. after 10 min seated) were used as reference baseline values; t

144

indicates the different collection timepoints (from B1 to B10).

145

Blood pressure was additionally monitored with an automated wrist manometer (Beurer BC85, Beurer

146

Gmbh, Ulm, Germany) at B1 and B6 to verify that the normalized activity imposed for the protocol only

147

produced a low sympathetic stimulus.

148

Statistical analyses

149

Descriptive values are reported as means ± SD. Variability of [Hb] and Hct over time was calculated as

150

a coefficient of variation (CV, %) from the mean of each individuals’ CV over the 10 measurements.

151

Normality of the distributions was successfully tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Sphericity was not

152

assumed and the Geisser-Greenhouse correction was used. Baseline variables were compared

153

between groups with Students’ t test. Differences in [Hb], Hct and Ret% at the different time points

154

were thus assessed with a linear mixed-model procedure with fixed and random effects to explain

155

target variables where subjects represented random effects; time, sex and group were the fixed

156

effects. The F statistic was used to test for significant fixed effects. The repeated measures were

157

analyzed by comparing each time point with the reference value (at B2) with correction for multiple

158

comparisons using statistical hypothesis testing (Dunnett’s test). The null hypothesis was rejected for

159

P<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the Jamovi open-source dedicated statistical

160

software (Jamovi 2019).

Results

162

Anthropometrical data, variables measured at baseline (or after all blood samples for total

163

haemoglobin mass and circulating volumes), for the study subjects are reported in Table 1. Hbmass

164

(absolute and relative to body mass) and circulating volumes were significantly higher in the Cyc group

165

when compared to Apn and Con (Table 1). In females, Hbmass (636 ± 84 g) and blood volume (4864 ±

166

646 ml) were significantly lower than in males (957 ± 121 g and 6748 ± 1054 ml, respectively, P<0.001).

167

Similarly, in females, [Hb] (12.7 ± 0.7 g/dL) and Hct (37 ± 2.1%) were significantly lower (P<0.01) than

168

in males (14.3 ± 0.9 g/dL) for [Hb], and (40.8 ± 2.2%) for Hct.

169

Box-and-whisker plots for [Hb], Hct, and Ret% over the 10 timepoints are presented in Figure 2.

170

Average coefficients of variation for all subjects over all time points for [Hb] and Hct were of 1.4 ± 0.2%

171

for [Hb] and 1.6 ± 0.4% for Hct.

172

When compared to the B2 reference value, significant differences were observed after the initial

173

normalized activity (B1), after 50 m of walking (B3) and in the supine position (B7-B10) for [Hb] and

174

Hct but not for Ret% (Figure 3). No significant difference was observed in the reticulocytes percentage

175

(Ret %) over the 10 timepoints (F (9, 324) =1.13, P = 0.339).

176

Plasma volume changes compared to B2 ranged from – 5.3% to 5.1% % with a significant decrease of

177

- 1.4% in average (P<0.05) at B3, and with a mean increase of 2.3%, 3.3% , 3.7%, 3.0% at B7, B8, B9 and

178

B10, respectively (P< 0.001).

179

There was a Group effect on [Hb] (P<0.05) indicating that the cyclists had higher values when

180

compared to the apnea divers and controls; and similarly, an interaction of Sex on [Hb] and Hct

181

(P<0.001) indicating the lower values measured in female subjects. However, no interaction (Group x

182

measure or Sex x measure) was identified for the posture related changes of [Hb], Hct or ∆Pv over the

183

10 timepoints in our study (NS) (Table 2).

Discussion

201

The major finding of the present study is that standing up and walking 50 m after being seated for 10

202

minutes increased [Hb] and Hct, while values were not different from baseline after 5 minutes in a

203

seated position again. The present study also underlined that blood samples collected after 10-30 min

204

in supine position resulted in lower [Hb] and Hct values compared to a sample taken after 10 min

205

seated.

206

In an antidoping context, our results indicate that digressing from current guidelines imposing 10 min

207

seated before sampling may result in altered results for variables measured as concentrations, due to

208

plasma volume shifts. Practically, however, if an athlete has to change seats (e.g., walking a few

209

meters), only 5 min may be required seated again before collecting a sample acceptable for the ABP.

210

Our results are in line with the initial study by Ahlgrim et al. showing that posture significantly

211

influences blood volume responses in its volumes distributions (Ahlgrim, Pottgiesser et al. 2010). It

212

may be hypothesized that a rapid pooling of blood to the lower extremities is due to the law of gravity

213

(Jacob, Raj et al. 2005). This phenomenon has been largely documented with an increase in vascular

214

transmural hydrostatic force (Lundvall and Bjerkhoel 1994). Our results are also in accordance with an

215

older study where a drop in blood volume up to 8% from the seated to the standing position, and an

216

increase up to 12% in supine position were reported (Hinghofer-Szalkay and Greenleaf 1987). An

217

increased capillary pressure in the feet (that can exceed 12kPa) causing an outward filtration was

218

mentioned as a possible explanation. The smaller change observed at B3 in the present study could be

219

explained by the very short standing (and walking) time of 50 s. Our result however indicate that values

220

rapidly stabilize again (i.e. after 5 min) when returning to the seated position after the brief walk.

221

In comparison with a seated position, a supine position induces a decrease in vascular resistance and

222

a shift of approximately 500-1000ml of blood, representing approximately 12% of blood volume

223

(Robertson 2008). This important shift may explain the hemodilution observed in our results in the

224

supine position. Moreover, our study results also highlight the time course of hemodilution from the

225

standing to the supine position, in line with research realized on patients undergoing hemodialysis

226

(Inagaki, Kuroda et al. 2001): A hemodilution was apparent after 10 minutes in supine position as

227

highlighted mainly by the lowered [Hb] and an increase in plasma volume. In a medical context, a study

228

showed that a 4% increase in Hct values from supine to standing position with a PV decrease between

229

6 and 25 % (Jacob, Raj et al. 2005). The magnitude of changes in PV observed in our study compared

230

to the seated phase is in line with previous research with variations ranging from -5% to +5%, showing

231

interindividual variability (Ahlgrim, Pottgiesser et al. 2010). In other research , taller subjects had a

232

higher PV volume decrease when standing up that the authors explained by a greater orthostatic load

233

(Lundvall and Bjerkhoel 1994). However, our results with the significant hemoconcentration observed

234

at B3 in our (significantly taller) Cyc group at B3 did not confirm the latter. The similar variations in

235

[Hb] and Hct indicate that the initial circulating volume and total haemoglobin content does not

236

influence variations due to posture changes (i.e. no group x measure variation).

237

Our study included almost one third of female subjects and our results indicate that sex had an effect

238

on [Hb] and Hct (p < 0.001) with lower values at baseline that are well documented (Murphy 2014).

239

However, the effect of sex on the changes in blood variables are not significant indicating that our

240

conclusions may apply to both male and female subjects or independently of the initial [Hb] or Hct.

241

As pre-analytical conditions are crucial for the quality of blood analyses, beyond postural changes,

242

other factors have to be considered to ensure the quality of the measurements. For instance,

243

tourniquet time was less than 20 seconds on average and the collection of the blood sample was

244

completed in 45 to 60 s. Prolonged tourniquet use (> 180 s) was thus avoided since it may lead to

245

alterations in [Hb] and Hct values due to the increase in venous pressure causing a fluid shift into the

246

extravascular space (Kuipers, Brouwer et al. 2005). The stable Ret% values obtained over the 10

247

successive measurements can be interpreted as a positive quality indicator for both sample collection

248

and analytical measurements with the automated analyzer (Sysmex XN1000) (Lombardi, Lanteri et al.

249

2011). The Ret% values in our study are in line with references values in the general population varying

250

between 0.5% and 2.5% (Banfi 2008). Ret% are not modified by plasma volume change as they are

251

measured as an absolute value.

252

In conclusion, our study indicates that standing up shortly during an antidoping blood collection

253

process (and walking up to 50 m to change seats for example) significantly alters the [Hb] and Hct

254

values in athletes and healthy subjects. Values however stabilized after 5 min upon returning in a

255

seated position. Blood sampled in a supine position may result in lower [Hb] and Hct values that can

256

affect an ABP profile. Blood samples for anti-doping purposes in the context of the ABP should

257

therefore not be collected in a supine position. If a subject has to stand up shortly after having waited

258

for 10min (e.g., to change seat from a waiting room to the phlebotomy location), acceptable samples

259

could be obtained after 5 min in a seated position. These findings can complement the current WADA

260

guidelines for blood sampling in the context of the ABP.
