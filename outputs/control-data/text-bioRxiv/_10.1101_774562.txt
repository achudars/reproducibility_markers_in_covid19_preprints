Summary

23

The formation and maintenance of spatial representations within hippocampal cell assemblies

24

is strongly dictated by patterns of inhibition from diverse interneuron populations. Although it

25

is known that inhibitory synaptic strength is malleable, induction of long-term plasticity at

26

distinct inhibitory synapses and its regulation of hippocampal network activity is not well

27

understood. Here, we show that inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin and somatostatin

28

expressing interneurons undergo long-term depression and potentiation respectively (PV-iLTD

29

and SST-iLTP) during physiological activity patterns. Both forms of plasticity rely on T-type

30

calcium channel activation to confer synapse specificity but otherwise employ distinct

31

mechanisms. Since parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons preferentially target

32

perisomatic and distal dendritic regions respectively of CA1 pyramidal cells, PV-iLTD and

33

SST-iLTP coordinate a reprioritisation of excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and CA3.

34

Furthermore, circuit-level modelling reveals that PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP cooperate to

35

stabilise place cells while facilitating representation of multiple unique environments within

36

the hippocampal network.

Introduction

44

GABAergic inhibitory interneurons form a diverse array of specialised cell types critical for

45

the regulation of complex network functions within the brain. A defining feature of inhibitory

46

interneurons is their precise axonal aborisations whereby inhibitory synapses target specific

47

subdomains of pyramidal neurons and other inhibitory interneurons (Klausberger and

48

Somogyi, 2008; Pelkey et al., 2017). Within the hippocampus and neocortex, parvalbumin (PV)

49

and somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons form two broad and occasionally overlapping

50

subtypes of interneurons that preferentially target perisomatic and distal dendritic regions of

51

pyramidal neurons respectively and are active on different phases of the theta cycle (Harris et

52

al., 2018; Katona et al., 2014; Klausberger et al., 2003; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; Varga

53

et al., 2012). This endows them with unique roles in sculpting pyramidal neuron responses to

54

excitatory inputs (Milstein et al., 2015; Royer et al., 2012). Perisomatic inhibition by PV

55

interneurons regulates pyramidal neuron spiking and network oscillations through feedforward

56

and feedback inhibition (Geiger et al., 1997; Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Sohal et al., 2009;

57

Sun et al., 2014). In contrast, dendritic inhibition by SST interneurons regulates local synaptic

58

and dendritic conductances, Ca2+ signal generation and excitatory synaptic plasticity

59

principally through feedback inhibition (Chiu et al., 2013; Maccaferri, 2005; Schulz et al.,

60

2018; Sun et al., 2014).

61

A defining feature of the hippocampus is the encoding of spatially relevant information via the

62

formation of place cells (O'Keefe, 1976). Synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the

63

hippocampus accounts for the formation of location specific firing of individual place cells but

64

it also plays a major role in the formation of place cell assemblies during exploration and offline

65

replay of place cell activity (Bittner et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2017; Isaac et al., 2009; Mishra

66

et al., 2016; Sadowski et al., 2016). Interestingly, individual CA1 pyramidal neurons can

67

encode distinct place fields in different environments (Colgin et al., 2008) presumably driven

68

by ongoing excitatory synaptic plasticity. This feature of place cells and the persistent plasticity

69

of their synaptic connections presents fundamental problems for hippocampal networks

70

balancing flexibility versus stability of representations (Chaudhuri and Fiete, 2016). It is not

71

clear how place cell assemblies in the hippocampus can encode multiple different locations in

72

separate environments without interference.

73

Inhibitory interneurons play an integral role within the hippocampus controlling place cell

74

activity (Del Pino et al., 2017; Royer et al., 2012; Sheffield et al., 2017; Trouche et al., 2016),

75

where short-term changes in SST and PV interneuron activity differentially regulate the

76

emergence and firing patterns of place cells (Royer et al., 2012; Sheffield et al., 2017) by

77

controlling glutamatergic synaptic plasticity (Chiu et al., 2013; Schulz et al., 2018). But the

78

consequences of long-term plasticity at inhibitory synapses on place cell activity has not been

79

investigated.

80

Long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity is a potentially important mechanism for learning

81

within cortical networks (Chiu et al., 2019; Donato et al., 2013; Hellyer et al., 2016; Kullmann

82

et al., 2012; Vogels et al., 2011) and GABAergic synapses in the hippocampus exhibit

83

structural and functional plasticity (Muir et al., 2010; Nusser et al., 1998; Schuemann et al.,

84

2013). Reductions in inhibitory strength via retrograde endocannabinoid signalling is well

85

established (Alger and Pitler, 1995; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Lee et al., 2010) but

86

multiple other mechanisms to regulate long-term inhibitory synaptic strength have also been

87

proposed including GABAB receptors and BDNF (Vickers et al., 2018), spike timing-

88

dependent plasticity of chloride transporters (Woodin et al., 2003), retrograde nitric oxide

89

signalling (Nugent et al., 2007) and NMDA receptors (Chiu et al., 2018). In the neocortex,

90

synapses from PV and SST interneurons can undergo unique forms of plasticity (Chiu et al.,

91

2018; Vickers et al., 2018), whilst in the hippocampus, recent evidence suggests interneuron

92

subtype specific inhibitory synapses are regulated in distinct ways (Horn and Nicoll, 2018;

93

Schulz et al., 2018). However, it is not clear whether long-term plasticity of inhibitory synapses

94

is differentially engaged between interneuron subtypes during physiologically relevant activity

95

and, furthermore, what the consequences of such plasticity would be for hippocampal network

96

activity and place cell representations.

97

To address these questions, we utilised an optogenetic approach in hippocampal slices to

98

selectively activate perisomatic and dendritically targeting inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal

99

neurons by expression of channelrhodopsin in PV or SST interneurons. We found that synapses

100

from PV and SST interneurons undergo interneuron-specific forms of inhibitory synaptic

101

plasticity driven by the relative timing of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal spiking and

102

employing distinct signalling mechanisms. We go on to show these forms of cell-specific long-

103

term inhibitory plasticity have profound effects on the output of CA1 pyramidal neurons and

104

use computational modelling to demonstrate that these plasticity rules can provide a

105

mechanism by which hippocampal place fields can remain stable over time whilst flexibly

106

encoding location in multiple environments.

Results

108

Divergent inhibitory plasticity at PV and SST synapses

109

To achieve subtype specific control of inhibitory interneurons, we selectively activated either

110

PV or SST interneurons by expressing the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2

111

(ChR2) in a cre-dependent manner using mice that expressed cre recombinase under control of

112

the promoter for either the parvalbumin gene (PV-cre) or somatostatin gene (SST-cre) crossed

113

with mice expressing cre-dependent ChR2 (PV-ChR2 and SST-ChR2 mice; methods).

114

Immunohistochemisty confirmed that ChR2 expression was highest in the Stratum Pyramidal

115

(SP) and Stratum Oriens (SO) layers for PV-ChR2 mice with cell bodies principally located in

116

SP (Figure 1A). Conversely, ChR2 expression was highest in the SO and Stratum Lacunosum

117

Moleculare (SLM) layers for SST-ChR2 mice with cell bodies principally located in SO

118

(Figure 1B). These expression profiles are consistent with the established roles of PV and SST

119

interneurons providing perisomatic and dendritic inhibition respectively (Booker and Vida,

120

2018; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; Pelkey et al., 2017). To further confirm the spatially

121

distinct inhibitory targets, we recorded interneuron subtype-specific inhibitory currents onto

122

CA1 pyramidal neurons by activating ChR2 with 470nm blue light (Figure 1C). The rise and

123

decay kinetics of the resulting light evoked PV IPSCs were significantly faster compared to

124

SST derived IPSCs (Figure 1D,E) (Rise time: 3.8 ± 0.3 ms PV verses 6.1 ± 0.8 ms SST, n = 8,

125

p < 0.05; Decay time: 16 ± 1.3 ms PV verses 28 ± 2.6 SST, n = 8, p < 0.01) supporting a more

126

proximal location for PV synapses compared to SST synapses. Light evoked PV IPSC kinetics

127

were almost identical to IPSC kinetics recorded from paired whole-cell recordings made from

128

PV expressing fast-spiking basket cells to CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure S1A) and similarly,

129

selective activation of Oriens Lacunosum Moleculare (OLM) cells using Chrna2-cre mice

130

(Leao et al., 2012; Mikulovic et al., 2015) revealed IPSC kinetics indistinguishable from SST-

131

ChR mice (Figure S1E). Furthermore, measurement of synaptic response amplitudes as light

132

was targeted to different regions of the slice confirmed the immunohistochemical

133

characterisation of ChR2 expression supporting the selective stimulation of perisomatic vs

134

dendritic targeted inhibition (Figure S1B,C,F,G). Therefore, whilst we cannot exclude the

135

activation of other interneuron subtypes expressing PV or SST, these data suggest the majority

136

of our synaptic inputs most likely arise from activation of PV basket cells and SST OLM cells

137

that selectively target synapses to perisomatic and distal dendritic regions of CA1 pyramidal

138

cells respectively.

139

Having established two populations of inhibitory synapses we investigated whether PV or SST

140

synapses undergo long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity and if so, whether induction and

141

expression is similar at each synapse. IPSCs were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons held

142

at 0 mv with glutamatergic transmission pharmacologically blocked. Interneuron subtype-

143

specific IPSCs mediated by GABAA receptors were evoked by 5 ms light pulses and,

144

importantly, an independent IPSC control pathway was evoked by electrical stimulation in the

145

pyramidal layer (PV IPSCs) or Stratum Radiatum (SST IPSCs) (Figure 1F and Figure S1D,H).

146

Both PV and SST interneurons are entrained to theta frequency rhythms in the hippocampus

147

(Klausberger et al., 2003) so we first tested whether bursts of IPSCs delivered at theta

148

frequency could induce long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity. Theta burst stimulation (TBS)

149

of the light evoked pathway led to a prolonged pathway-specific reduction of PV-IPSC

150

amplitude indicating a synapse specific long-term depression of PV synapses (PV-iLTD, 115%

151

± 14% control verses 61% ± 8% test pathway, n = 6, p < 0.05) (Figure 1G). In contrast an

152

identical light induced TBS led to a pronounced pathway-specific long-term potentiation of

153

SST-IPSC amplitude (SST-iLTP, 87% ± 6% control verses 139% ± 8% test pathway, n = 6, p

154

< 0.01) (Figure 1H). These findings indicate that high frequency inhibitory synaptic stimulation

155

can induce inhibitory synaptic plasticity at PV and SST synapses, but the direction of plasticity

156

is diametrically opposite for the two different synapses.

157

A common feature of plasticity at inhibitory synapses is the requirement for postsynaptic

158

depolarisation in conjunction with synaptic stimulation, despite the synaptic stimulation itself

159

causing hyperpolarisation (Alger and Pitler, 1995; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Chiu et al.,

160

2018; Horn and Nicoll, 2018; Lee et al., 2010; Muir et al., 2010; Nusser et al., 1998; Schuemann

161

et al., 2013; Schulz et al., 2018; Vickers et al., 2018; Woodin et al., 2003). To test the

162

requirement for depolarisation in PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP we delivered TBS whilst voltage

163

clamping neurons at -60mV during the TBS protocol. Under these conditions neither PV-iLTD

164

nor SST-iLTP were induced (Figure S2A,B; PV: 84% ± 8% control verses 91% ± 4% test

165

pathway, n = 5, p > 0.05; SST: 96% ± 6% control verses 106% ± 4% test pathway, n = 5, p >

166

0.05), indicating that both forms of inhibitory plasticity require coincident pyramidal neuron

167

depolarisation and inhibitory input.

PV and SST synapses undergo spike timing-dependent inhibitory plasticity

170

During exploratory behaviour, neurons in the hippocampus are entrained to the theta rhythm

171

(Buzsaki, 2002) with defined populations of neurons, including different subpopulations of

172

interneurons, firing action potentials at specific phases of the theta cycle (Klausberger et al.,

173

2003; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; Varga et al., 2012). Having established a requirement

174

for coincident synaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarisation for the induction of PV-iLTD

175

and SST-iLTP we next sought to determine whether this was a Hebbian form of plasticity that

176

could be induced by coincident pre- and post-synaptic action potentials and if so, what the

177

precise spike timing requirements might be with respect to the preferred interneuron and

178

pyramidal spiking phases of the theta cycle. The major subclasses of PV interneurons, basket

179

cells and axo-axonic cells, fire on the descending phase of theta cycle roughly 60ms before

180

pyramidal neurons, whilst both bistratified and OLM SST interneurons fire near coincident

181

with pyramidal neurons at the trough of the cycle (Figure 2A) (Katona et al., 2014; Klausberger

182

et al., 2003; Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008; Varga et al., 2012). We therefore tested the

183

induction of inhibitory spike timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP) using spike timings of -60

184

ms, 0 ms and +60 ms to replicate spike patterns during exploratory behaviour and span the full

185

width of a theta cycle (Figure 2A).

186

To test iSTDP, CA1 pyramidal neurons were voltage clamped at -50mV in the presence of

187

AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers and light and electrically evoked IPSCs recorded as test

188

and control synaptic pathways respectively. During the iSTDP protocol, recordings were

189

switched to current clamp with the membrane potential maintained at -50 mV and single light

190

evoked IPSCs were paired with a burst of 4 action potentials repeated 100 times at theta

191

frequency (5 Hz). Stimulation of PV synapses with the theta-relevant -60 ms spike timing

192

protocol resulted in pathway specific PV-iLTD (Figure 2B, 95% ± 7% control verses 73% ±

193

7% test pathway, n = 7, p < 0.05). PV-iLTD was also observed when PV synapses were paired

194

at 0 ms (Figure 2C, 106% ± 3% control verses 72% ± 6% test pathway, n = 13, p < 0.001) but

195

not at +60 ms (Figure 2D, 105% ± 6% control verses 95% ± 8% test pathway, n = 8, p > 0.05)

196

resulting in a pan-theta cycle iSTDP relationship incorporating iLTD but no iLTP (Figure 2E).

197

Surprisingly, SST synapses also displayed iLTD at -60 ms spike timings (Figure 2F, 101% ±

198

7% control verses 70% ± 5% test pathway, n = 6, p < 0.01) but contrastingly underwent iLTP

199

when paired at 0 ms (Figure 2G, 104% ± 4% control verses 130% ± 13% test pathway, n = 11,

200

p < 0.05). At pairings of +60 ms SST synapses also exhibited no plasticity similar to PV

201

synapses (Figure 2H, 92% ± 8% control verses 90% ± 8% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05).

202

Therefore, SST synapses can undergo both iLTD and iLTP depending on the precise spike

203

timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials in contrast to PV synapses that only undergo

204

iLTD. These results demonstrate that spike timings observed during theta rhythm entrainment

205

lead to distinct rules for iSTDP at PV and SST synapses. Interestingly, we observed at both PV

206

and SST synapses that pairing inhibitory inputs 60 ms after a burst of action potentials was

207

insufficient to induce inhibitory plasticity, highlighting the importance of spike timing and the

208

need for inhibitory synaptic input prior to pyramidal neuron activity.

209
210

PV-iLTD requires postsynaptic activation of T-type Ca2+ channels and calcineurin.

211

We next investigated the molecular mechanisms of spike timing-dependent PV-iLTD. First,

212

we found that presynaptic input or postsynaptic spikes alone were insufficient to induce iLTD

213

at PV synapses. (Presynaptic input only: 100% ± 12% control verses 94% ± 6% test pathway,

214

n = 6, p > 0.05; Postsynaptic spikes only: 103% ± 10% control verses 94% ± 5% test pathway,

215

n = 6, p > 0.05) (Figure 3A,B). Consistent with PV-iSTDP and TBS induced PV-iLTD, these

216

results show that coincident activity between PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons is

217

required for PV-iLTD. Many forms of synaptic plasticity also depend on elevations in

218

postsynaptic Ca2+ and we tested if this was the case for PV-iLTD by including the Ca2+ chelator

219

BAPTA in the intracellular recording solution. BAPTA prevented PV-iLTD demonstrating a

220

dependence on postsynaptic Ca2+ (100% ± 10% control verses 95% ± 8% test pathway, n = 6,

221

p > 0.05) (Figure 3C).

222

Important sources of postsynaptic Ca2+ for the induction of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic

223

plasticity are NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) (Chiu et al., 2018;

224

Griffith et al., 2016; Magee and Johnston, 1997; Tigaret et al., 2016). Since NMDA receptors

225

are blocked in our experiments, we investigated the role of VGCCs in PV-iLTD. L-type

226

VGCCs are the most prominent postsynaptic VGCCs, however, the L-type VGCC inhibitor

227

nimodipine (20 µM) failed to block PV-iLTD (97% ± 4% control verses 82% ± 3% test

228

pathway, n = 10, p < 0.01 (Figure 3D). We next tested the role of T-type VGCCs using the

229

inhibitor mibefradil (5 µM) which blocked PV-iLTD (92% ± 5% control verses 92% ± 3% test

230

pathway, n = 6, p > 0.05 (Figure 3E) and this was confirmed with the use of another T-type

231

VGCC inhibitor ML218 (3 µM) (Xiang et al., 2011) (99.4% ±5.3% control verses 93.8 ± 7.2%

232

test pathway, n = 8, p > 0.05) (Figure S3E). Interestingly, T-type VGCCs have a low voltage

233

threshold for activation and predominantly reside in an inactivated state at resting membrane

234

potentials (Randall and Tsien, 1997). They therefore require hyperpolarisation to relieve

235

voltage inactivation (de-inactivation), which corresponds precisely with the requirement for

236

inhibitory synaptic input prior to postsynaptic depolarisation resulting in synapse specificity of

237

PV-iLTD. These findings highlight a mechanism by which inhibitory synapses can provide a

238

synapse-specific source of Ca2+ to induce inhibitory plasticity.

239

The downstream effects of Ca2+ can lead to release of retrograde signalling molecules which

240

regulate presynaptic release of GABA (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Nugent et al., 2007) or

241

it can signal postsynaptically to reduce GABAA receptor function (Muir et al., 2010). We

242

therefore tested whether previously described retrograde signalling molecules nitrous oxide

243

(Nugent et al., 2007) and endocannabinoids (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003) are involved in

244

PV-iLTD. The nitrous oxide pathway antagonist ODQ (5 µM) and the CB1 receptor antagonist

245

AM251 (1 µM) both failed to prevent PV-iLTD (Figure S3C,D and Figure 3G, ODQ: 100% ±

246

8% control verses 78% ± 7% test pathway, n = 6, p < 0.05; AM251: 98% ± 8% control verses

247

73% ± 10% test pathway, n = 5, p < 0.05). An additional candidate mechanism could be the

248

activation of the G-protein coupled GABAB receptor since this has been shown to mediate a

249

form of iLTD (Vickers et al., 2018), however the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845 (1

250

µM) also failed to prevent PV-iLTD (Figure S3B and Figure 3G, 101% ± 10% control verses

251

71% ± 7% test pathway, n = 7, p < 0.05). One postsynaptic signalling pathway that has been

252

implicated in iLTD is activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (Luscher et al., 2011; Muir et

253

al., 2010; Wang et al., 2003). Application of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (10 µM) prevented

254

PV-iLTD (110% ± 7% control verses 105% ± 3% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05) (Figure 3F)

255

indicating a postsynaptic target for Ca2+ signalling. In summary, PV-iLTD requires coincident

256

pre- and post-synaptic activity, opening T-type VGCC to provide a postsynaptic Ca2+ signal

257

that leads to activation of calcineurin to induce LTD at PV inhibitory synapses (Figure 3G,

258

5A).

259
260

SST-iLTP requires postsynaptic activation of L- and T-type Ca2+ channels and CAMKII.

261

The molecular mechanisms of spike timing-dependent SST-iLTP were next investigated.

262

Similar to PV-iLTD, and consistent with SST-iSTDP and TBS induced SST-iLTP, we found

263

that SST-iLTP requires coincident pre- and post-synaptic activation as neither SST inputs nor

264

postsynaptic action potentials alone were able to induce SST-iLTP (Presynaptic input only:

265

107% ± 6% control verses 91% ± 11% test pathway, n = 6, p > 0.05; Postsynaptic spikes only:

266

94% ± 5% control verses 100% ± 10% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05) (Figure 4A,B). The

267

inclusion of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA also prevented the induction of iLTP at SST synapses

268

(97.44% ± 10% control verses 92% ± 6% test pathway, n = 6, p > 0.05) (Figure 4C), indicating

269

SST-iLTP requires postsynaptic Ca2+. Again, we assessed if L- and/or T-type VGCCs could

270

provide the source of postsynaptic Ca2+ required for SST-iLTP. Interestingly, L-Type VGCC

271

antagonist nimodipine and T-type VGCC antagonists mibefradil and ML218 both blocked

272

SST-iLTP (nimodipine: 93% ± 7% control verses 101% ± 7% test pathway, n = 5, p > 0.05;

273

mibefradil: 99% ± 9% control verses 101% ± 10% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05; ML218: 113%

274

± 8% control verses 100% ± 6% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05) (Figure 4D,E,H, Figure S4B)

275

showing SST-iLTP requires activation of L-type and T-type VGCCs with the latter providing

276

a synapse specific source of Ca2+ similar to PV-iLTD.

277

Since calcineurin is required for PV-iLTD, we next tested the possible involvement of

278

calcineurin in SST-iLTP. However, inhibition of calcineurin failed to block SST-iLTP (108%

279

± 5% control verses 123% ± 8% test pathway, n = 7, p < 0.05) (Figure 4F,H). As SST-iLTP

280

requires both L-type and T-type VGCCs we hypothesised that SST-iLTP might be mediated

281

by a molecular pathway engaged by high levels of postsynaptic Ca2+. CAMKII is one such

282

candidate and has been shown to mediate potentiation of inhibitory synapses including SST

283

synapses within the cortex (Chiu et al., 2018) and other inhibitory synapses within the

284

hippocampus (Marsden et al., 2007; Petrini et al., 2014) resulting in postsynaptic changes in

285

GABAA receptors. We therefore tested the involvement of CAMKII activation on hippocampal

286

SST-iLTP and found that the CAMKII inhibitor KN-62 (3 µM) prevented SST-iLTP (115% ±

287

3% control verses 102% ± 6% test pathway, n = 7, p > 0.05) (Figure 4G,H), consistent with its

288

role in mediating iLTP. In summary, SST-iLTP requires the coincident activation of SST

289

synapses and pyramidal neurons, which activates L-type and T-type VGCCs providing a Ca2+

290

source able to activate CAMKII to induce SST-iLTP (Figure 5B).

291
292

SST and PV plasticity shape pyramidal neuron responses to excitatory input pathways.

293

To understand the potential implications of PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP on network integration of

294

inputs to a pyramidal neuron, we implemented a multi-compartment model of a CA1 pyramidal

295

neuron in the presence of proximal (PV) and distal (SST) inhibition (Figure 6A). The simulated

296

CA1 pyramidal neuron receives distal excitatory input from entorhinal inputs via the

297

temporoammonic (TA) pathway and proximal excitatory input from CA3 inputs via the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/774562; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

298

Schaffer collateral (SC) pathway. We also implemented rate-based inhibitory plasticity rules

299

derived from our experiments under the most physiologically-relevant conditions (SST-iLTP

300

and PV-iLTD).Inhibitory synaptic weights onto pyramidal cells were therefore updated

301

following a Hebbian plasticity rule in which coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity leads to

302

iLTD for PV synapses and iLTP for SST synapses. We then simulated activity within the

303

network before and after the induction of inhibitory plasticity and compared the correlation

304

between Schaffer collateral or temporoammonic inputs and pyramidal cell activity at these two

305

stages. As expected, the correlation between Schaffer collateral inputs and CA1 pyramidal cell

306

activity increased and the correlation between temporoammonic inputs and CA1 pyramidal cell

307

activity decreased following the induction of interneuron plasticity (Figure 6B). Therefore, if

308

we assume that SST-iLTP occurs primarily at distal dendritic locations, interneuron-specific

309

plasticity is a potential mechanism to change CA1 network state from being driven by both

310

temporoammonic and Schaffer collateral inputs to being primarily driven by Schaffer collateral

311

inputs.

312

We next incorporated functionally-relevant feedforward and feedback connectivity for PV and

313

SST interneurons within the CA1 network. PV interneurons receive strong feedforward

314

innervation from the Schaffer collateral pathway but relatively limited input from the

315

temporoammonic pathway and some feedback input from CA1 pyramidal neurons (Booker and

316

Vida, 2018; Ganter et al., 2004; Milstein et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014). In contrast, distally

317

targeting SST interneurons receive almost no feedforward input and are driven by feedback

318

input from CA1 pyramidal neurons (Blasco-Ibanez and Freund, 1995; Booker and Vida, 2018;

319

Lacaille et al., 1987; Sun et al., 2014). There is also evidence that bistratified interneurons that

320

target inhibition to proximal dendrites in Stratum Radiatum and express both PV and SST can

321

be feedforward in the Schaffer collateral pathway and also feedback within CA1 (Booker and

322

Vida, 2018; Sun et al., 2014).

323

Using these various functional connectivity arrangements, we first investigated the

324

consequences of PV-iLTD on CA1 pyramidal cell output. For Schaffer collateral inputs with

325

feedforward PV interneurons, PV-iLTD led to an increase in CA1 pyramidal cell activity due

326

to a reduction in feedforward inhibition (Figure 6C). The same result was achieved if we

327

included feedback inhibition from PV interneurons (Figure S5A). When we considered the

328

temporoammonic pathway without feedforward PV interneurons, PV-iLTD did not change

329

pyramidal cell output (Figure 6D). However, if we incorporated PV interneurons as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/774562; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

330

feedforward and feedback inhibition, PV-iLTD led to an increase in pyramidal cell activity in

331

response to temporoammonic stimulation (Figure S5B). Therefore, our model predicts that

332

CA1 pyramidal cell activity in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation should increase

333

following PV-iLTD whereas it is likely to remain unchanged in response to stimulation of the

334

temporoammonic pathway unless PV interneurons participating in feedforward inhibition of

335

the temporoammonic pathway or feedback inhibition are significantly activated and undergo

336

PV-iLTD.

337

We next investigated the implications of SST-iLTP on CA1 pyramidal cell output. Pyramidal

338

cell activity in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation was not affected by SST-iLTP if SST

339

synapses are located at the pyramidal cell’s distal dendritic compartment (Figure 6E) and this

340

was true regardless of whether SST interneurons were activated in feedforward or feedback

341

fashion (Figure S5C). Contrary to Schaffer collateral stimulation, temporoammonic-induced

342

CA1 pyramidal cell activity was reduced after SST-iLTP (Figure 6F) and this effect was

343

stronger if SST interneurons were considered to be feedforward as well as feedback (Figure

344

S5D). In summary, our model predicts that SST-iLTP does not affect Schaffer collateral-

345

induced CA1 pyramidal cell activity whereas SST-iLTP decreases activity induced by

346

temporoammonic stimulation.

347

If we assume the functional connectivity shown in Figures 6C-F, our model simulations

348

therefore predict that PV-iLTD will increase CA1 pyramidal neuron responses to Schaffer

349

collateral but not temporoammonic inputs and that SST-iLTP will decrease CA1 pyramidal

350

neuron responses to temporoammonic but not Schaffer collateral inputs.

351

To test these predictions, we experimentally investigated the impact of PV-iLTD and SST-

352

iLTP on the probability of spike generation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. By stimulating either

353

the Schaffer collateral or temporoammonic pathways, action potential probability was recorded

354

in response to 10 consecutive EPSPs where the stimulation intensity was set such that the

355

baseline action potential probability for each EPSP was ~50%. Upon Schaffer collateral

356

stimulation, PV-iLTD (0 ms timing) led to an increase in the spike probability (0.4 ± 0.07

357

baseline verses 0.78 ± 0.05 post plas, n = 6, p < 0.05) (Figure 7A) that mirrored the timecourse

358

of PV-iLTD, but for temporoammonic pathway stimulation spike probability was unaltered

359

(0.44 ± 0.04 baseline verses 0.47 ± 0.03 post plas, n = 6, p > 0.05) (Figure 7B). Taken together

360

these results confirm the predictions from the model and suggest that in our experiments the

361

majority of PV interneurons recruited by Schaffer collateral stimulation are feedforward and

362

undergo PV-iLTD whereas few PV interneurons are recruited by temporoammonic stimulation

363

or via feedback excitation from CA1 pyramidal neurons. We next conducted experiments to

364

examine the impact of SST-iLTP on spike generation. We found that the increase in SST

365

inhibition with SST-iLTP had little effect on action potential generation from Schaffer

366

collateral stimulation (0.53 ± 0.04 baseline verses 0.5 ± 0.08 post plas, n = 8, p > 0.05) (Figure

367

7C) but led to a robust reduction in spike generation from the temporoammonic pathway (0.52

368

± 0.03 baseline verses 0.27 ± 0.09 post plas, n = 6, p < 0.05 (Figure 7D). Again, these results

369

confirm the predictions from the model and suggest that in our experiments SST interneurons

370

are primarily feedback and target distal dendritic regions of pyramidal neurons.

371

Taken together, these results demonstrate that long-term inhibitory plasticity changes the

372

responses of CA1 pyramidal neurons prioritising inputs from the Schaffer collateral pathway

373

over those from the temporoammonic pathway. Increased distal dendritic inhibition driven by

374

SST-iLTP will also inhibit the induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity (Leao et al., 2012;

375

Williams and Holtmaat, 2019) with important functional implications for the formation and

376

stability of place cells.

377
378

Inhibitory plasticity at PV and SST synapses provides a mechanism for place cell stability

379

across multiple environments.

380

We next explored the implications of long-term inhibitory plasticity on place cell physiology

381

within hippocampal networks. The long-term nature of inhibitory plasticity suggests that its

382

impact on place cell physiology will be evident as an animal traverses different environments.

383

Key features of place cells are: (i) that in multiple different environments each place cell may

384

represent distinct locations or switch to be silent, and (ii) that within any single environment

385

place cell representations are broadly stable upon repeated exposures to that environment

386

(Colgin et al., 2008; Ziv et al., 2013). However, these two features are somewhat contradictory

387

since they require place cells to respond to different inputs without interference (Chaudhuri

388

and Fiete, 2016).

389

To investigate the functional implications of interneuron subtype-dependent long-term

390

plasticity for place cell physiology in multiple different environments, we simulated a CA1

391

network receiving place-tuned input while an animal explored first an annular track

392

(environment A) and then a different track (environment B) before finally returning to the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/774562; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

393

original familiar environment A’ (Figure 8A). In our simulations, CA1 pyramidal neurons

394

receive inputs from Schaffer collaterals, temporoammonic pathway, SST interneurons and PV

395

interneurons (Figure 8B). Schaffer collateral inputs are spatially tuned while the other inputs

396

are considered spatially uniform for simplicity. Schaffer collateral inputs are plastic and follow

397

a Hebbian-type plasticity rule which depends on coincident pre- and post-synaptic activation.

398

Following recent evidence that place fields are formed by synaptic plasticity at Schaffer

399

collateral synapses following closely-timed temporoammonic and Schaffer collateral inputs

400

(Bittner et al., 2015; Bittner et al., 2017), we implemented the postsynaptic term of the Hebbian

401

plasticity rule to be the product of the activities of the distal and proximal compartments of our

402

two-compartment neuron model (see Methods). SST and PV inhibitory synapses onto

403

pyramidal cells also follow a rate-based Hebbian-type plasticity rule inspired by the

404

physiologically-relevant scenarios from our experimental data (as for Figure 6). Coincident

405

pre- and post-synaptic activity leads to iLTP in the case of SST synapses, whereas pre- and

406

post-synaptic coactivation leads to iLTD in the case of PV synapses.

407

For any trial simulation of the network, the simulated CA1 pyramidal neuron rapidly developed

408

a place field at a random location within environment A that remained stable for subsequent

409

laps of the track (Figure 8B). These place fields were driven by rapidly evolving synaptic

410

weight changes (Figure S6). When the track was switched to environment B, the indexes of

411

Shaffer collateral inputs were shuffled. In this environment, the CA1 pyramidal neuron

412

occasionally formed a new place field but was more often silent due to an inability to align and

413

adapt synaptic weight increases after the inputs were shuffled (Figure 8B and Figure S6A). On

414

returning to the familiar environment A’, the initial place field location was reinstated

415

immediately (Figure 8B,D,E). These results are qualitatively in line with the experimentally

416

observed physiology of place cell activity in different environments (Colgin et al., 2008).

417

To determine the role of inhibitory plasticity, we first removed PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP from

418

the model. Simulations of this model lacking inhibitory plasticity showed similar place cell

419

activity in environment A. In contrast, when the track was switched to environment B without

420

inhibitory plasticity engaged, synaptic weight changes drove the generation of new place fields

421

in every trial and the overall spiking rates were not reduced (Figure 8C and Figure S6B).

422

Furthermore, on returning to environment A, the place fields were no longer reinstated but

423

instead new representations evolved (Figure 8C,D,F). Thus, without inhibitory plasticity novel

424

environments generate interference and the network is no longer capable of creating stable

425

place field representations.

426

We next sought to distinguish the roles of PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP within this network.

427

Simulations of a model with only PV-iLTD (SST-iLTP OFF) showed similar lack of place cell

428

stability across environments A-B-A’ to simulations with no inhibitory plasticity and overall

429

spiking rates were unchanged in environments B and A’ due to prior spiking rate saturation

430

(Figure 8G,I,J). With implementation of only SST-iLTP (PV-iLTD OFF), place cell stability

431

across environments A-B-A’ was reinstated but overall spiking rates were reduced compared

432

to simulations with full inhibitory plasticity (Figure 8H,I,K).

433

These circuit-level modelling data show how long-term inhibitory plasticity can provide a

434

mechanism for the experimentally observed phenomenon that newly formed place cells are

435

stable with repeated exposure to an environment and don’t undergo interference from

436

experiencing other environments. This stability is principally due to SST-iLTP which also

437

reduces the efficiency of forming new place fields in different environments. The overall spike

438

output of place cells is maintained by PV-iLTD which counteracts the reduction in spike output

439

caused by SST-iLTP.

Discussion

443

Inhibitory GABAergic synapses are known to undergo long-term plasticity but very few studies

444

have defined which subpopulations of inhibitory interneurons are engaged and whether

445

plasticity is induced by physiological firing patterns. This is important since distinct

446

interneuron subtypes play highly specific roles within neuronal networks (Pelkey et al., 2017)

447

and therefore plasticity at one inhibitory synapse may have very different effects to another. In

448

this study we address this complexity and show that proximal and distal dendritically targeting

449

interneuron synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons have distinct plasticity rules within the

450

hippocampus. These inhibitory synapses undergo homosynaptic plasticity in a Hebbian manner

451

relying on the coincident activation of interneurons and pyramidal neurons (Figure 1,2). This

452

coincident activity enables recruitment of VGCCs to provide local sources of Ca2+ able to alter

453

inhibitory synapse strength (Figure 3,4,5).

454

By computationally modelling the effects of inhibitory plasticity at a single neuron level, we

455

predicted that altered inhibition at distinct dendritic compartments dramatically alters

456

pyramidal neuron output (Figure 6). We confirmed this experimentally showing action

457

potential generation from proximally and dendritically targeting excitatory inputs is modulated

458

by inhibitory plasticity in corresponding dendritic compartments (Figure 7).

459

By expanding our computational model, we show how plasticity at these distinct inhibitory

460

synapses can play roles in the stabilisation of place cell activity within the hippocampus (Figure

461

8). This inhibitory plasticity stabilisation ensures place cell fidelity and resilience to

462

interference from activity in multiple different environments.

463
464

Inhibitory plasticity at distinct inhibitory synapses

465

The mechanisms and network implications of long-term plasticity at glutamatergic synapses

466

have been extensively characterised. However, less attention has been paid to long-term

467

plasticity at inhibitory synapses which are known to undergo dynamic changes in efficacy

468

(Chiu et al., 2019; Kullmann et al., 2012; Pelkey et al., 2017). An array of unique mechanisms

469

discovered for inhibitory plasticity suggests a lack of uniformity across the multiple subtype-

470

specific inhibitory synapses.

471

Within the hippocampus, synapses from CCK expressing proximally targeting basket cells onto

472

CA1 pyramidal neurons undergo an endocannabinoid mediated iLTD (Chevaleyre and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/774562; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

473

Castillo, 2003). Here, mobilisation of retrograde endocannabinoid signalling results in long

474

term suppression of GABA release (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Younts et al., 2016). We

475

demonstrate that a similar morphological subtype of interneuron, the proximally targeting PV

476

interneurons can also undergo iLTD but in an endocannabinoid independent mechanism

477

(Figure 3), highlighting the diversity of plasticity mechanisms even among interneurons with

478

similar morphology (Freund and Katona, 2007).

479

Other long-term inhibitory plasticity mechanisms include a persistent shift in the chloride

480

reversal potential caused by coincident activity-dependent modulation of the KCC2 chloride

481

transporter (Ormond and Woodin, 2011; Wang et al., 2006; Woodin et al., 2003). Interestingly,

482

in the hippocampus this iLTD is reported in the feedforward inhibitory pathway for Schaffer

483

collateral innervation of CA1, commensurate with PV basket cell innervation, and is dependent

484

on L-type VGCC and NMDA receptor activation. An alternative set of mechanisms for PV

485

synapse plasticity is reported in the auditory cortex where PV synapses undergo bidirectional

486

iSTDP via BDNF and GABAB dependent mechanisms (Vickers et al., 2018). However, these

487

mechanisms do not appear to apply to PV-iLTD in the hippocampus and moreover, we found

488

no evidence for PV-iLTP. The lack of PV-iLTP is also reported in the prefrontal cortex where

489

SST but not PV synapses undergo iLTP (Chiu et al., 2018). This suggests that inhibitory

490

plasticity rules may not be conserved across brain regions or that PV synapses undergo multiple

491

forms of inhibitory plasticity. In contrast, the mechanism for iLTP at SST synapses may be

492

broadly conserved, at least between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where activation of

493

CAMKII via Ca2+ influx to dendrites is found to induce iLTP (Chiu et al., 2018). The

494

mechanistic differences here relate to the source of Ca2+ influx, arising from NMDA receptors

495

in prefrontal cortex and L- and T-type VGCCs in hippocampus. We further show that

496

hippocampal SST synapses can be depressed by non-coincident pre- and post-synaptic spike

497

timing and it will be interesting to find out if this is also the case for synapses in prefrontal

498

cortex.

499
500

Inhibitory plasticity relies on recruitment of T-type VGCC.

501

We show that plasticity at both PV and SST synapses exhibits several key properties: (i) it

502

depends on the coincident activity of inhibitory synapses and postsynaptic action potentials,

503

(ii) it is synapse specific, and (iii) it relies on postsynaptic Ca2+ signalling. These properties are

504

apparently contradictory since synapse-specific inhibition is hyperpolarising which usually

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/774562; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

505

inhibits Ca2+ influx and signalling. We show that this apparent contradiction is resolved by

506

recruitment of T-type VGCCs. At resting membrane potentials, T-type VGCCs are in an

507

inactivated state, which can be de-inactivated by a hyperpolarising membrane potential (Perez-

508

Reyes, 2003; Randall and Tsien, 1997), this activation profile lends itself perfectly to

509

recruitment by GABAergic synapse activity. Importantly, we show that pairing action

510

potentials before inhibitory input or inhibitory input alone is insufficient to induce inhibitory

511

plasticity. These observations suggest GABA synapse dependent de-inactivation of T-type

512

VGCC is required prior to action potential activation of T-type VGCC, leading to a local

513

synapse specific source of Ca2+ to drive inhibitory plasticity.

514

Indeed, there is considerable evidence linking GABA signalling and T-type VGCC activation.

515

In the cerebellum and thalamus where T-type VGCCs are widely expressed, T-type VGCCs

516

regulate inhibitory synapse strength (Aizenman et al., 1998; Pigeat et al., 2015; Sieber et al.,

517

2013; Wang et al., 2006). In the thalamus GABAergic synapses onto thalamocortical neurons

518

de-inactivate T-type VGCCs and reduce inhibitory synaptic strength (Pigeat et al., 2015). This

519

thalamocortical inhibitory plasticity is also dependent on the interaction of calcineurin with

520

GABAA receptors, similar to findings in the hippocampus (Muir et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2003)

521

and those we present here.

522

A striking finding in our results shows that identical induction protocols PV and SST synapses

523

induce opposing forms of plasticity via the differential recruitment of calcineurin and CaMKII.

524

Since CaMKII requires higher [Ca2+] to activate, the differential recruitment of calcineurin and

525

CaMKII could be explained if postsynaptic [Ca2+] is higher at SST vs PV inhibitory synapses.

526

In support of this hypothesis, we show that SST-iLTP relies on L-type as well as T-type VGCCs

527

suggesting a higher level of Ca2+ entry. Alternatively, expression levels of VGCCs may

528

increase at more distal dendritic locations and there is evidence that T-type VGCC expression

529

is higher in dendritic regions of pyramidal neurons causing differential regulation of

530

glutamatergic plasticity along the proximal-distal axis of pyramidal neurons (Isomura et al.,

531

2002).

532
533

The consequences of inhibitory synaptic plasticity on hippocampal network function.

534

Our data support two separate functions of interneuron subtype-specific inhibitory plasticity

535

537

response to inputs from CA3 pyramidal neurons via the Schaffer collateral pathway over those

538

from entorhinal neurons via the temporoammonic pathway. Secondly, in our computational

539

model, increasing inhibition at distal dendritic locations inhibits the induction of synaptic

540

plasticity at excitatory synapses (Leao et al., 2012; Williams and Holtmaat, 2019) thereby

541

reducing adaptability of hippocampal representations.

542

Interneuron-specific inhibitory plasticity at proximal and distal dendritic locations coupled

543

with the anatomical arrangement of Schaffer collateral inputs to proximal dendrites and

544

temporoammonic inputs to distal dendrites intuitively predicts that inhibitory plasticity will

545

rebalance the weighting of excitatory inputs in favour of Schaffer collaterals. We formalised

546

these predictions using computational modelling of the CA1 network and then tested them

547

experimentally. We confirmed that PV-iLTD increases CA1 pyramidal neuron responses to

548

Schaffer collateral stimulation whereas SST-iLTP decreases responses to temporoammonic

549

stimulation. Our combination of computational modelling and experimental approaches also

550

showed that the majority of PV interneurons activated by our optogenetic approach are

551

feedforward in the Schaffer collateral pathway but not the temporoammonic. Furthermore, our

552

data indicate a limited feedback role for the PV interneurons we activate since PV-iLTD did

553

not impact CA1 pyramidal neuron spike output in response to temporoammonic input. This

554

broadly corresponds to anatomical and functional data for PV interneurons in the hippocampus

555

(Booker and Vida, 2018; Ganter et al., 2004; Milstein et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014). In contrast,

556

the SST interneurons we stimulate are distally targeting, receive almost no feedforward input

557

and are driven by feedback input from CA1 pyramidal neurons and therefore have all the

558

hallmarks of OLM cells (Blasco-Ibanez and Freund, 1995; Booker and Vida, 2018; Lacaille et

559

al., 1987; Sun et al., 2014).

560

The implications of reprioritising CA3 input over entorhinal input to CA1 are not

561

straightforward but parallels can be drawn with the short-term reprioritisation caused by

562

neuromodulator or thalamocortical inputs in cortical circuits (Fu et al., 2014; Hasselmo, 2006;

563

Hasselmo and Schnell, 1994; Williams and Holtmaat, 2019). Often these mechanisms also

564

involve reconfiguration of inhibitory interneuron circuits which are proposed to prioritise input

565

of new sensory information over internal representation on short timescales including theta

566

cycle timescales (Dupret et al., 2013; Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018). The long-term inhibitory

567

plasticity described here is predicted to achieve the reverse outcome prioritising previously

568

learnt associations and making the network less receptive to new information.

569

Such a scenario would fit with the second role of inhibitory plasticity inhibiting excitatory

570

plasticity and therefore the formation of new representations. SST inhibitory input regulates

571

dendritic excitability and therefore NMDA receptor activation and excitatory synaptic

572

plasticity (Schulz et al., 2018). Long-term plasticity of SST synapses will change the ability

573

for CA1 pyramidal neurons to undergo induction of excitatory LTP (Leao et al., 2012; Williams

574

and Holtmaat, 2019). We show that this has major implications for the stability and flexibility

575

of place cells since their formation and remapping depends on excitatory synaptic plasticity

576

driven by dendritic spikes generated by coincident Schaffer collateral and temporoammonic

577

inputs (Bittner et al., 2015; Bittner et al., 2017; Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015). SST-iLTP

578

prevents place cell representations in environment A being disrupted by different

579

representations in environment B and indeed reduces the ability for place cells to be active in

580

multiple environments. Interestingly, short-term changes in PV and SST interneuron firing

581

rates in response to novel environments may provide a countermechanism to enable new place

582

fields to be formed in novel environments (Sheffield et al., 2017). Our data and modelling

583

therefore provide a mechanism to reconcile the observed stability of place cells across time and

584

their ability to remap in distinct environments (Colgin et al., 2008).

585

In summary, our data reveal a novel form of inhibitory plasticity in the hippocampus induced

586

by physiological patterns of firing. It has major implications for hippocampal function

587

controlling input-output relationships in CA1 and providing a mechanism to explain a long-

588

standing conundrum regarding place cell stability versus flexibility.

Methods

606

Animal strains and breeding

607

All procedures and techniques were conducted in accordance to the UK animals scientific

608

procedures act, 1986 with approval of the University of Bristol ethics committee. To express

609

615
616

Brain slice preparation

617

Brain slices were prepared from 4-9 week old mice following cervical dislocation and

618

decapitation and brains removed and dissected in ice cold cutting solution containing in mM:

619

205 Sucrose, 10 Glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, constantly

620

bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Horizontal brain slices, 400 µM thick containing the

621

hippocampus were prepared via a vibratome (Leica LS1200). Brain slices were transferred to

622

ACSF containing in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 24 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4 10 Glucose, 2.5 CaCl2,

623

1.3 MgCl2, constantly bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. and incubated at 35 °C for 30 min

624

before being stored at room temperature for at least 30 min before experimentation.

625
626

Whole cell patch clamp recordings.

627

Brain slices were transferred to a submerged slice recording chamber with a constant 2.5

628

ml/min flow of ACSF (see above), held at 32 °C. Inhibitory plasticity experiments were

629

recorded in the presence of DAP5 (50 µM) and NBQX (20 µM) to isolate GABAergic events.

630

Slices were visualised using infrared DIC optics using a Scientifica SliceScope microscope.

631

Patch electrodes with a resistance of 3-6 MΩ were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries

632

using a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter-instruments) and filled with internal solution. For whole

633

cell voltage clamp recordings where neurons were held at 0 mV internal solution consisted of

641

all experiments a junction potential of ~ -15 mV was not compensated.

642

Recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons were conducted via a Multiclamp 700A amplifier

643

(Molecular devices) filtered at 6 kHz and digitised at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz using a

644

Synaptic stimulation and plasticity protocols.

648

For inhibitory plasticity experiments subtype specific IPSCs were evoked via optical

649

stimulation of ChR2 via a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs) through a 40x objective lens using 2-5 ms

650

square pulses of light. Control pathway IPSCs were evoked via 100 µs square pulse electrical

651

stimulation delivered via a monopolar stimulating electrode placed in the pyramidal layer or

652

Stratum Radiatum. For plasticity experiments each pathway was stimulated every 15 sec in an

653

interleaved fashion and synapses from each pathway were checked for independence by a

654

paired pulse protocol (Figure S1).

655

For light evoked TBS plasticity, neurons were voltage clamped at 0 mV for the duration of the

656

experiment, light evoked TBS was applied in voltage clamp and consisted of 5 bursts delivered

657

at 5 hz, each burst containing 4 light pulses at 100 hz with the protocol repeated 5 times at

658

0.033 hz. For inhibitory spike time dependent plasticity experiments, neurons were voltage

659

clamped at -50 mV. Pairing protocol consisted of 100 pairings at 5 hz in current clamp (neurons

660

maintained at -50 mV), each consisting of presynaptic light stimulation with a burst of action

661

potentials initiated via somatic current injections (2 ms duration, 1 nA amplitude). For all

662

plasticity experiments the series resistance was monitored and cells that showed a >20% change

663

were excluded from analysis.

Immunohistochemistry

670

Brains were fixed via cardiac perfusion of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4%

671

Formaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and stored in PFA for 24hrs and then transferred

672

to 30% sucrose PBS solution for 2 days. 50 µm thick slices were then obtained via cryostat

673

sectioning. Slices were incubated in a blocking solution containing 5% donkey serum and 0.2%

674

Triton X-100 for 90 min at room temperature. Slices were then incubated in room temperature

675

overnight in PBS containing 1% donkey serum and either anti-PV (1:10000, Sigma P3088)

676

anti-SST (1:10000 Santa Cruz SC-7819) or anti-GFP (1:1000 LifeTech A11122) antibodies for

677

PV, SST and ChR2 visualisation respectively. Slices were then washed with PBS and incubated

678

with secondary antibodies, Alexa-594 (1:1000, LifeTech) or Alexa-488 (1:1000, LifeTech) for

679

2hrs at room temperature, before washing with PBS and mounting on microscope slides with

680

1:1000 DAPI staining. Slices were then visualised, and images acquired using a widefield

681

fluorescence microscope. Hippocampal layer regions within the CA1 were defined based on

682

DAPI staining and ChR2 mean fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software.

683
684

In vitro data analysis

685

Experimental unit was defined as cell with only one cell recorded per slice. Up to 3 cells were

686

recorded from each animal with an average of 1.6 cells per animal. Measurements were taken

687

as an average of 4 responses to obtain a data point per min, averages represent mean ± S.E.M.

688

Time series data was normalised to the last 5 min of baseline and plasticity was assessed by

689

comparing the average IPSC amplitude 20-30 min after plasticity induction between the control

690

and test pathway. Owing to the within cell control, data were analysed using a paired two-tailed

691

Student’s t-test between the two pathways. For histograms comparing the average test pathway

692

plasticity, statistical significance was assigned as a one-sample t-test compared to 100. In all

693

cases significance assigned if p < 0.05.

Neuron Model and network structure

697

We investigate a feedforward network consisted of a single postsynaptic neuron receiving

698

inputs from the temporoammonic pathway, Schaffer collaterals, and SST and PV interneurons.

699

The postsynaptic neuron is modelled using a two-compartment, rate-based neuron model. The

700

first compartment represents the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, receiving excitatory

701

inputs from the temporoammonic pathway and inhibitory inputs from SST interneurons. The

702

second compartment represents the perisomatic region of CA1 pyramidal cells, receiving

703

excitatory inputs from Schaffer Collaterals and inhibitory inputs from PV interneurons.

Excitatory plasticity model

734

In figure 8, synaptic weights from SC input neurons to CA1 pyramidal neurons are plastic.

735

These connections follow a Hebbian-type plasticity rule in which changes in synaptic weights

736

depend on coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity. The postsynaptic term is given by the

737

product of dendritic and somatic activity. This is motivated by recent findings suggesting that

738

place fields are modified and formed following coincident TA and SC inputs (Bittner et al.,

739

2015; Bittner et al., 2017). The excitatory synaptic weight 𝑤

Negative weights are then rectified to zero.

Environment switch

762

In figure 8, we simulate a feedforward network while an animal runs through an annular track.

763

When the animal starts exploring environment A for the first time, the initial synaptic weights

764

for the SC inputs are drawn from a lognormal distribution with underlying normal distribution

765

with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. The synaptic weights are then multiplied by 0.1

766

and two neighbouring inputs are randomly chosen and their synaptic weights are set to 0.6.

767

This imposes a small structure in the synaptic weights and ensures that input neurons are able

768

to induce postsynaptic activity. The animal then explores environment A for 10 laps. Next, the

769

animal is moved to a novel environment (environment B). We simulate the switch to a novel

770

environment by randomly shuffling the identity of the SC inputs to the CA1 pyramidal neuron.

771

The animal then explores environment B for 15 laps. Subsequently, the animal is moved back

772

to environment A (environment A’), which is implemented by returning the SC inputs to the

773

original identity. Finally, the animal explores environment A’ for another 10 laps.

Figure 5. PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP mechanisms.
(A) Illustration of PV-iLTD mechanism. Hyperpolarisation by GABAA receptor currents relieves
T-type VGCCs from voltage dependent inactivation (de-inactivation). Back-propagating action
potentials then activate T-type VGCCs providing an inhibitory synapse specific source of Ca2+ to
activate calcineurin resulting in LTD at PV synapses.
(B) Illustration of SST-iLTP mechanism. Similar to PV-iLTD but requiring activation of T-type
and L-type VGCCs that activates CAMKII resulting in LTP at SST synapses.

Figure 6. PV and SST plasticity differentially regulate Schaffer collateral and temporoammonic
excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons.
(A) Diagram of a simulated, rate-based CA1 pyramidal cell before and after the induction of inhibitory
plasticity (iPlas). A single two-compartment neuron receives inputs from four sources: distallytargeting temporoammonic, proximally-targeting Schaffer collaterals, distally-targeting inhibition from
SST interneurons, and proximally-targeting inhibition from PV interneurons. iPlas leads to PV-iLTD
and SST-iLTP.
(B) Correlation between Schaffer collateral activity and CA1 somatic activity (left) and
temporoammonic activity and CA1 somatic activity (right) before and after iPlas at PV and SST
synapses (PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP).
(C-F) CA1 somatic activity before and after iPlas (either PV-iLTD or SST-iLTP) under the individual
stimulation of either Schaffer collaterals or temporoammonic inputs.
(C) Schaffer collateral-driven CA1 somatic activity is enhanced upon PV-iLTD.
(D) CA1 somatic activity driven by temporoammonic input after PV-iLTD, is unchanged.
(E) CA1 somatic activity driven via Schaffer collateral input after SST-iLTD is unchanged.
(F) SST-iLTP leads to a reduction in CA1 somatic activity in response to temporoammonic input. See
also Figure S5.
Data represent mean ± S.E.M statistical comparison via unpaired t-tests. Significant difference is
indicated ( *p < 0.05).

Figure 8. PV and SST plasticity ensure place cell stability and fidelity across multiple
environments.
(A) Simulation protocol. An animal explores environment A for 10 laps. It is then moved to environment
B and explores it for 15 laps. Finally, the animal is moved back to the first environment (A’) and is
allowed to run for another 10 laps. Throughout this protocol, two-compartment CA1 pyramidal cells are
simulated receiving spatially-tuned Schaffer collateral inputs, temporoammonic input, and PV and SST
inhibitory inputs. Schaffer collateral synapses follow a Hebbian-type excitatory plasticity dependent on
the co-activation of dendritic and somatic compartments (see methods). PV and SST synapses undergo
rate-based iPlas (PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP). We simulate the switch from environment A to environment
B by randomly shuffling the identity of the SC inputs to the CA1 pyramidal neuron. Schematic
depictions of environments A and B indicate their cyclical nature.
(B) Diagram of simulated CA1 pyramidal cell and examples of somatic activity during exploration for
iPlas ON. With iPlas (PV-iLTD and SST-iLTP) ON, place field location formed in environment A (top
& bottom panel) remains stable after exposure to novel environment B (middle panel).
(C) Diagram of simulated CA1 pyramidal cell and examples of somatic activity during exploration for
iPlas OFF. Location of place fields formed in environment A are not maintained after exposure to a novel
environment.
(D) Spatial correlation between environment A before and after exposure to novel environment is
maintained when iPlas is present but is reduced without iPlas.
(E) When iPlas is ON, average somatic activity of recently formed place cell is significantly reduced in
new environment B but returns to higher levels when the animal returns to environment A’.
(F) When iPlas is OFF, average somatic activity remains high in both environments.
(G) When SST-iLTP is turned off, leaving just PV-iLTD, place cell locations are not retained after
exposure to a new environment.
(H) When PV-iLTD is turned off, leaving just SST-iLTP, place cell locations are maintained across
multiple environments.
(I) Spatial correlation between environment A before and after exposure to novel environment is
maintained when only PV-iLTD is turned off but is reduced when only SST-iLTP is turned off.
(J) SST-iLTP is turned off, leaving just PV-iLTD, average somatic activity remains high in both
environments.
(K) When PV-iLTD is turned off, leaving just SST-iLTP, average somatic activity is lower and thus less
robust.
Data represent mean ± S.E.M statistical comparison via unpaired t-tests. Significant difference is
indicated ( *p < 0.05). See also Figure S6.

Figure S1 (related to Figure 1). Characterisation of PV and SST optogenetic responses.
(A) Comparison of optogenetically evoked PV IPSCs and IPSCs recorded via PV fast-spiking basket cell
and CA1 pyramidal neuron paired recordings. Both rise and decay times were indistinguishable.
(B) PV IPSCs evoked via light stimulation through the objective lens positioned over different layers of
the hippocampus. PV IPSC amplitude was highest in the pyramidal layer consistent with PV basket cell
activation.
(C) PV IPSCs were completely blocked by 1µM tetrodotoxin and 50µM picrotoxin showing optogenetic
IPSCs are action potential and GABAA receptor dependent.
(D) Check of pathway independence between PV-optogenetic light-evoked pathway and electricallyevoked IPSC control pathway in SP. Electrical stimulation failed to depress light responses whilst light
responses failed to depress electrical responses indicating separate discrete inhibitory synapse activation.
(E) Comparison of optogenetically evoked IPSCs SST and Chrna2 expressing OLM interneurons. Both
rise and decay times were indistinguishable.
(F) SST and Chrna2 IPSCs evoked via light stimulation of different layers of the hippocampus. Both
SST and Chrna2 IPSC amplitudes were maintained across all layers and highest in stratum lacunosum
moleculare layer consistent with SST OLM interneuron activation.
(G) SST IPSCs were completely blocked by 1µM tetrodotoxin and 50µM picrotoxin showing
optogenetic IPSCs are action potential and GABAA receptor dependent.
(H) Check of pathway independence between SST-optogenetic light-evoked pathway and electricallyevoked IPSC control pathway in the SR. Electrical stimulation failed to depress light responses whilst
light responses failed to depress electrical responses indicating separate discrete inhibitory synapse
activation.
Data represent mean ± S.E.M statistical comparison via unpaired t-tests (D,H) ( *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001 ).

Figure S5 (related to Figure 6). PV and SST plasticity regulate CA1 pyramidal neuron
excitability via feedback and feedforward inhibition.
(A) PV-iLTD increased CA1 pyramidal neuron activity in responses to Schaffer collateral input if PV
interneurons are engaged via feedforward inhibition or feedforward and feedback inhibition.
(B) PV-iLTD had no effect on temporoammonic excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons due to lack of
feedforward or feedback inhibition. If the temporoammonic pathway recruits PV interneurons via
feedforward or partake in feedback inhibition PV-iLTD increased temporoammonic pathway driven
CA1 activity.
(C) SST-iLTP had no effect on the Schaffer collateral induced CA1 pyramidal neuron excitability if
it is engaged via feedback or feedback and feedforward inhibition.
(D) SST-iLTP reduced the temporoammonic pathway driven excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons
when engaged via feedback or feedforward and feedback inhibition.
Data represent mean ± S.E.M statistical comparison via unpaired t-tests. Significant difference is
indicated ( *p < 0.05).
