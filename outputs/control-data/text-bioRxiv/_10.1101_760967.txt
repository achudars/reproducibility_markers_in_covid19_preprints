ABSTRACT
Mammalian Pumilio (PUM) proteins are sequence-specific, RNA-binding proteins with wideranging roles, including germ cell development that has functional implications in fertility.
Although human PUM1 and PUM2 are closely related to each other and recognize the same
RNA binding motif, there is some evidence for functional diversity, particularly related to
their roles in fertility. Here, by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches, we identified
separate mRNA pools regulated by PUM1 and PUM2 proteins in human male germ cells.
Using global mass spectrometry-based profiling, we identified distinct PUM1- and PUM2bound putative protein cofactors, most of them involved in RNA processing. Combinatorial
analysis of RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry findings revealed that PUM1 and PUM2 may
form distinct RNA-regulatory networks, with different roles in human reproduction and
testicular tumorigenesis. Our findings highlight the functional divergence and versatility of
PUM paralogue-based post-transcriptional regulation, offering insight into the mechanisms
underlying their diverse biological roles and diseases resulting from their dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION
Posttranscriptional gene regulation (PTGR) is crucial to maintaining cellular proteome
homeostasis (Gerstberger, Hafner et al., 2014, Mukherjee, Wessels et al., 2019), disruption of
which can cause severe diseases such as cancer and infertility (Fredericks, Cygan et al.,
2015). PTGR requires the activity of RNA-binding proteins, such as the widely-studied
pumilio (PUM) proteins which are founding members of the PUF (pumilio and fem-3 binding
factor) family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. PUM proteins are highly conserved and
present in many organisms, from yeast to humans (for review see (Goldstrohm, Hall et al.,
2018)). Simultaneous knockout of mouse PUM1 and PUM2 is lethal (Zhang, Chen et al.,
2017), indicating their crucial role in development. Posttranscriptional regulation by PUMs is
mediated by the conserved C-terminal RNA-binding PUF domain, which is composed of
eight tandem repeats (Wang, McLachlan et al., 2002), and binds a specific eight nucleotide
sequence 5’-UGUAHAUA-3’, called the PUM-binding element (PBE) that is typically
located in the 3’untranslated regions (3’UTR) of target mRNAs. By binding PBEs, PUMs
trigger the recruitment of protein cofactors, that together direct selected mRNAs towards posttranscriptional repression or activation (for review see (Goldstrohm et al., 2018)).
Each of the five PUMs in yeast contains a PUF domain that is different in structure
from the others, contains between 6-8 tandem repeats and binds to a distinct PBE motif. In
this way, each PUM co-ordinately controls the fate of multiple mRNAs sharing a specific
PBE motif and which have been found to be functionally related (Gerber, Herschlag et al.,
2004). These findings became the basis for the so-called PUM RNA regulon model (Keene,
2007). Considering high structural similarity of PUM1 and PUM2, it is still unresolved
whether they form separate regulons in mammals. Although mammalian PUM1 and PUM2
contain nearly identical PUF domains (Spassov & Jurecic, 2003) that recognize the same PBE

motif (UGUANAUA) (Galgano, Forrer et al., 2008), there is some evidence for divergent
modes of regulation. Examination of interactions between another RNA-binding protein,
ARGONAUTE2 (AGO2), and PUM proteins revealed a substantial fraction of nonoverlapping PUM1 and PUM2 mRNA targets (Sternburg, Estep et al., 2018). Therefore, it is
possible that PUM1 and PUM2 paralogues are functionally non-redundant and function as
distinct RNA regulatory networks (regulons), as previously suggested (Gerber et al., 2004).
We recently demonstrated a specific example of functional non-redundancy between PUM1
and PUM2 by showing that while PUM2 induces PBE-dependent repression of the mRNA
target SIAH1, PUM1 does so in a PBE-independent manner (Sajek, Janecki et al., 2018).
Additionally, the regions N-terminal to the PUF domain, which are divergent between PUM1
and PUM2, were reported to contain three unique sub-regions with autonomous repressive
activity that may represent an interface for binding protein cofactors since they were not
demonstrated to bind RNA (Weidmann & Goldstrohm, 2012).
A number of PUM protein cofactors such as NANOS1, NANOS3 and DAZ family
members are associated with male or female infertility in humans (Jaruzelska, Kotecki et al.,
2003, Kusz-Zamelczyk, Sajek et al., 2013, Moore, Jaruzelska et al., 2003, Reijo, Lee et al.,
1995, Santos, Machado et al., 2014). Also PUM1 itself was found to be important for male
and female fertility (Chen, Zheng et al., 2012, Mak, Fang et al., 2016, Xu, Chang et al., 2007).
Establishing the mechanisms underlying functional divergence of PUM1 and PUM2 including
identification of their protein cofactors may help in understanding their particular roles in
human germ cells as well as human infertility, a problem affecting 15% of couples worldwide who are unable to conceive (O'Flynn O'Brien, Varghese et al., 2010). Male infertility in
particular impacts 7% of the male population (for review see (Ibtisham, Wu et al., 2017)).
Notably, male infertility is a risk factor for developing testis germ cell tumour (TGCT).

Testicular cancers are the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumours in young Caucasian
males, and their incidence has increased (van de Geijn, Hersmus et al., 2009), highlighting the
importance of the human male germ cell context in studying PUM1- and PUM2-controlled
regulation. However, the only available germ cell line is TCam-2, which originates from
human seminoma, a type of TGCT, and represents male germ cells at an early stage of
prenatal development (de Jong, Stoop et al., 2008). The identification of PUM mRNA targets
and PUM-interacting proteins had not been previously studied in human germ cells (which
would help establishing the mechanisms underlying functional divergence of PUM1 and
PUM2 in these cells) and therefore may help in understanding the reasons behind infertility in
humans. To the best of our knowledge, the identification of PUM mRNA targets in germ cells
has only been studied in the C. elegans model (Prasad, Porter et al., 2016). Here, by RNA
sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS), distinct mRNA pools and interacting proteins were
identified for PUM1 and PUM2 in human germ cells, thereby enabling understanding of PUM
functional relevance to fertility.

RESULTS
Identification of PUM1 and PUM2 mRNA targets by RIP-Seq
As the first step, to identify human PUM1- and PUM2-bound mRNAs in the TCam-2 cell
line, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), by combining RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and CLIP-Seq protocols. Namely, UV crosslinking step at 254 nm was added to the
original RIP-Seq protocol. After verifying the specificity (by performing IP with and without
RNase A treatment) of antibodies to PUM1 or PUM2 N-terminal regions and excluding crossreactions (Fig. S1A, B and Table S1), IP of these proteins was performed in RNA protecting

buffer. Prior to RNA-Seq analysis of PUM-bound mRNAs, we performed RNA-Seq analysis
of the TCam-2 transcriptome to use as the reference in RIP-Seq experiments. The RNA-Seq
data obtained was in close agreement with the published TCam-2 transcriptome, with a
Pearson correlation R2 value of 0.957 (Fig. S2) (Irie, Weinberger et al., 2015).
The RIP-Seq approach allowed us to identify 1484 and 1133 poly-adenylated RNAs
that were significantly enriched (at least two fold) in the anti-PUM1 and anti-PUM2 IPs,
respectively, compared to the levels found in IgG IPs and the TCam-2 transcriptome (Table
S2). Of these, 870 mRNAs were found to specifically bind to PUM1 alone, 519 to PUM2
alone, and 614 (30%) were bound to both PUM1 and PUM2 (Fig. 1A) (Table S2).
Although it was previously established that each human PUM paralogue specifically
recognizes the PBE motif UGUANAUA (Galgano et al., 2008), the PBE motif UGUAHAUW
(H stands for A, C or U while W for A or U) was found in a recent study to be more accurate
for PUM1 and PUM2 (Bohn, Van Etten et al., 2018). Therefore, in this study, mRNAs
identified by RIP-Seq were screened for the presence of the UGUAHAUW motif. We found
that on average, PUM1-bound mRNAs contain 2.29 UGUAHAUW motifs/sequences, while
PUM2-bound mRNAs contain 1.72 (Fig. 1B left panel). The same analysis when performed
for the 100 most enriched PUM1 and PUM2 targets, revealed that the motif frequency was
higher, with PBE content of 3.04 and 2.00 for PUM1 and PUM2, respectively (Fig. 1B right
panel). In contrast, in non-specifically bound mRNAs (those present in immunoprecipitates
but that were not significantly enriched (<2x) in comparison to non-immune serum and the
TCam-2 transcriptome), PBE motif occurrence was significantly lower (0.34/sequence for all
RIP-Seq identified and 0.04/sequence for top 100 targets with a higher occurrence in anti-IgG
than in anti-PUM immunoprecipitates) (Fig. 1B). We observed that altogether ~6.6% of the
TCam-2 transcriptome presented PUM1-bound mRNAs, and ~4.1% presented PUM2-bound

mRNAs and almost all of them contained PBEs (Fig. 1C). We next checked for PBE motif
localization within each PUM1 and PUM2 target mRNA to determine the percentage of target
mRNAs that harboured PBEs in the 3’UTR or in other locations. We found that PBEs were
mostly located in the 3’UTR (88% and 83% for PUM1 and PUM2, respectively), less
frequently in CDS (10% and 15% for PUM1 and PUM2, respectively) and rarely in the
5’UTR (1.8% and 2.0% for PUM1 and PUM2, respectively) (Fig. 1D). These numbers are in
agreement with those obtained from HeLa cells (Galgano et al., 2008) as well as recent data
from HEK293T cells (Bohn et al., 2018).
To address whether PUM1- and PUM2-bound mRNAs selected by the RIP-Seq
approach represented similar or different cellular functions, we performed Gene Ontology
analysis (Fig. S3, Table S3). Since we obtained similar numbers of mRNA bound to PUM1
and PUM2 (1484 and 1133, respectively), we were able to use GO BiNGO plug-in in
Cytoscape platform (Maere, Heymans et al., 2005) to compare the biological processes and
molecular functions of these two groups in an unbiased manner using our TCam-2
transcriptome as a background. We found that while the majority of targets represented
overlapping biological processes (BP) and molecular functions (MF), some were related only
to PUM1 targets, e.g., chromosome organization, positive regulation of transcription,
chromatin modification (BP from Fig. S3A), transcription regulator activity, GTPase activator
activity and protein binding (MF from Fig. S3B). Some other functions were related only to
PUM2 targets, e.g., cell cycle, organelle organization, M phase (BP from Fig. S3A), motor
activity, helicase activity and cytoskeletal protein binding (MF from Fig. S3B).

Since mRNA binding alone does not imply regulation by RBPs, and PUM1-repressed
mRNAs have been reported to undergo degradation (Morris, Mukherjee et al., 2008) or
activation (Bohn et al., 2018), we next sought to identify those mRNAs whose expression was
modified upon PUM1 or PUM2 gene knockdown. At 72 h after TCam-2 cell transfection with
PUM1 or PUM2 siRNA, when silencing efficiency was the highest for both paralogues (Fig.
S1C, D), RNA was isolated and RNA-Seq analysis was conducted, we refer to this approach
as siRNA-Seq from hereon. This analysis revealed 1088 genes with higher expression and
768 genes with lower expression upon PUM1 knockdown, 1024 genes with higher expression
and 752 genes with lower expression upon PUM2 gene knockdown (with the adjusted Pvalue<0.05) (Fig. 1E, F, Table S4). RNA-Seq analysis revealed that among these, 470 genes
were specifically repressed and 412 genes were specifically activated by PUM1 alone, 406
genes were specifically repressed and 396 genes were specifically activated by PUM2 alone,
618 genes were repressed by both PUM1 and PUM2, and 356 genes were activated by both
PUM1 and PUM2 (Fig. 1E, F, Table S4). Gene Ontology analysis of mRNAs up- and
downregulated upon PUM1 and/or PUM2 siRNA knockdown (PUM1 or PUM2 siRNA-Seq)
is presented in Fig. S4, and shows that most of biological processes and molecular functions
of siRNA-Seq PUM1 and PUM2 targets overlap.

Selection of PUM1- and PUM2-regulated mRNA targets based on RIP-Seq and siRNA-Seq
analysis
For the identification of PUM1- and PUM2-regulated mRNA targets, we used the following
two selection criteria: #1 binding to PUM1 or PUM2 as detected by RIP-Seq (genes listed in
Table S2) and #2 down- or upregulation of mRNA levels upon PUM1 or PUM2 siRNA
knockdown and RNA-Seq (siRNA-Seq, genes listed in Table S4). The simultaneous use of

both criteria provided us with 346 (322 repressed and 24 activated) PUM1-regulated (Fig. 1G
upper panel, Table S5), 141 (88 repressed and 53 activated) PUM2-regulated (Fig. 1G lower
panel, Table S5) mRNAs. Additionally, by using these two criteria, we found that the number
of mRNAs shared by PUM1 and PUM2 was reduced to 10% (47 common mRNAs) (Fig. 1H)
compared to the 30% seen by RIP-based selection (Fig. 1A).
The mRNAs regulated by both PUM1 and PUM2 represented only 1.35% and 0.62%
of the TCam-2 transcriptome, respectively (Fig. 2A), compared to 6.56% and 4.14% PUM1or PUM2-bound mRNAs (Fig. 1C). To further validate the mRNA pools that we considered
to be regulated by PUM1 and PUM2 (Fig. 1G), we analysed their PBE-motif content. We
found that the number of mRNAs containing at least one PBE reached nearly 100% (96.82%
for PUM1 and 99.76% for PUM2) (Fig. 2B). This is significantly higher than the PBE content
in RIP-Seq- or siRNA-Seq-identified mRNAs (RIP-Seq PUM1 90.77%; RIP-Seq PUM2
85.94%; siRNA-Seq PUM1 59.68%; siRNA-Seq PUM2 57.50%). This result additionally
validated our approach. PBE motif distribution in regions of siRNA-Seq PUM mRNA targets
is shown in Fig. 2C. We also found that in the case of mRNAs under positive regulation by
PUM1 and/or PUM2, PBE motif frequency in the 5’UTR was almost 4 times higher than in
mRNAs pools under PUM1 and/or PUM2 repression (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the 5’UTR
sequence is more frequently used in the case of mRNAs activated/stabilized by PUMs than in
repressed mRNAs.
Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the biological processes and molecular
functions of mRNAs regulated by PUM1 and PUM2 are different. While PUM1 regulated
targets are involved e.g., in mitotic cell cycle checkpoint, regulation of transcription,
developmental process, chromosome localization (BP from Fig. S5A), small GTPase
regulator activity and protein binding (MF from Fig. S5B), PUM2 regulated targets are

involved e.g., in negative regulation of cell division (BP from Fig. S5A), signal transducer
activity, MAP kinase activity, kinase activity and transferase activity (MF from Fig. S5B).
GO analysis revealed also a minority of molecular functions involving both, PUM1 and
PUM2 regulated mRNAs, e.g., nucleoside-triphosphatase regulator activity, enzyme regulator
activity and nucleoside binding (MF from Fig. S5B).

Global profiling reveals many putative protein cofactors bound by PUM1 and PUM2 to be
RNA-binding proteins
Our result showing that PUM1 and PUM2 share only ~10% of their mRNA targets (Fig. 1H)
was surprising given that PUM1 and PUM2 recognize the same UGUAHAUW motif (Bohn
et al., 2018) and show remarkably high similarity in binding potential across 12,285
sequences, as shown by quantitative analysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNAMaP) (Jarmoskaite, Denny et al., 2019). Since N-terminal regions are known to be structurally
divergent (Spassov & Jurecic, 2003), they might function differently in PUM1 and PUM2, for
example, by binding different sets of protein cofactors. We hypothesized that PUM1 and
PUM2 discriminate between specific mRNA targets in vivo by interacting with unique protein
cofactors. To test this hypothesis, we performed anti-PUM1 and anti-PUM2 co-IP
experiments followed by mass spectrometry (MS) to identify PUM1- and PUM2-binding
proteins in TCam-2 cells. We identified 27 PUM1-, 13 PUM2- and 7 PUM1/PUM2interacting proteins, all of which required the presence of RNA for binding (Fig. 3A). They
all represent known RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which supports our results. However, we
also identified 15 PUM1-, 34 PUM2-, and 15 PUM1/PUM2-interacting proteins that
interacted in an RNA-independent manner (Fig. 3B). Twenty-eight of these PUM-interacting
proteins were identified both in the presence and absence of RNA (Table S6 and S1). Taken

together, we identified 27 PUM1-, 30 PUM2- and 25 PUM1/PUM2-bound protein interactors
(Table S6 and S1). Interestingly, 54 among 82 PUM1- and PUM2-bound proteins identified
in this study are known RBPs, and for 26 of them, a specific RNA-binding motif has already
been established using Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and
Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) or RNA competing methods (Hafner, Landthaler et al.,
2010, Ray, Kazan et al., 2013) (Table S6 and S1). Proteins bound to PUM1 were mostly
different from those bound to PUM2, with the majority of them being functionally involved in
RNA binding, regulation and processing.

Binding motifs of PUM1- and PUM2-bound RBPs are enriched in PUM-regulated mRNAs
To check whether PUM1- and PUM2-bound RBPs could potentially cooperate with PUM in
the selection of specific mRNA targets for regulation, we first checked whether the binding
motifs corresponding to these RBPs co-occur with PBEs in PUM1- and PUM2-regulated
mRNA targets. To this end, we performed an analysis of binding motif enrichment for 10
PUM1-specific (Fig. 4A) and 8 PUM2-specific RBPs (Fig. 4B) in PUM1 or PUM2-regulated
mRNA targets, respectively. We found that RNA binding motifs (Fig. 4D) for 6 out of 10
PUM1 bound RBPs – IGF2BP3, YBX1, NUDT21, IGF2BP1, PABPC4 and CPSF7, but not
FUS, LIN28A, HNRNPK and CPSF6, were highly enriched in PUM1 regulated mRNAs (Fig.
4A). In the case of PUM2, we found that RNA binding motifs (Fig. 4D) for 7 out of 8 PUM2
bound RBPs – PTBP1, G3BP2, G3BP1, HNRNPF, FMR1, SRSF7 and SRSF1 but not
HNRNPA2B1, were highly enriched in PUM2 regulated mRNAs (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we
also performed analysis of motif enrichment for 7 common PUM1- and PUM2-interacting
RBPs in mRNAs regulated by both PUM1 and PUM2 (Fig. 4C) and found that RNA binding
motifs (Fig. 4D) for all common PUM1 and PUM2 bound RBPs – SFPQ, FXR1, FXR2,

NCL, HNRNPA1, MATR3 and PABPC1, were highly enriched in both, PUM1 and PUM2
regulated mRNAs. Motif enrichment was evaluated relative to motif enrichment in nonregulated mRNAs set as 1 (Fig. 4A-C dashed lines). The high enrichment of RBP motifs that
we found is an additional indication for these RBPs to be putative PUM1 or PUM2 protein
cofactors in the regulation of their mRNA targets.

PUM1 and PUM2 Form separate regulons in TCam-2 cells
To further explore potential functional specificities between PUM1 and PUM2, we combined
the above RIP-Seq (Fig. 1), siRNA-Seq (Fig. 1), co-IP/MS (Fig. 3), RNA binding motif
enrichment (Fig. 4) and GO analysis data. This combined analysis was based on the
assumption that an mRNA containing a binding motif for a specific PUM protein cofactor, the
frequency of which is significantly higher (above average) than in the control mRNA dataset,
is co-regulated by that protein cofactor (Fig. 3 and 4) (Table S7). The main findings are as
follows: First, there are separate PUM1 and PUM2 regulatory networks (regulons). Second,
PUM1 and PUM2 may cooperate with varied components to regulate different pathways. As
examples, PUM1 and IGF2BP1 may co-regulate mRNA sub-pools involved in intracellular
lipid transport; PUM1 together with PABPC4 and MATR3 may co-regulate mRNAs involved
in epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathway; and PUM1 together with PABPC1
and PABPC4 may co-regulated mRNAs involved in negative regulation of binding. On the
other hand, PUM2 and SRSF1 may co-regulate endothelial cell development; PUM2 together
with SFPQ and SRSF7 – establishment of cell polarity and cell morphogenesis involved in
neuron differentiation; PUM2 together with G3BP2, HNRNPA1, FXR2 and NCL may coregulate mRNAs involved in regulation of Rho protein signal transduction. PUM2 and
MATR3 may co-regulate mRNAs involved negative regulation of cell development; PUM1

together with IGF2BP3 may co-regulate mRNAs involved in regulation of cell division;
PUM1 together with PABPC4, IGF2BP3, YBX1, NUDT21 and MATR3 may co-regulate
mRNAs involved in histone lysine methylation. Third, although PUM1 and PUM2 form
separate regulons, they may cooperate in the regulation of some common mRNA targets,
which are involved in the same biological processes (Fig. 5).

Several mRNAs highly expressed in TCam-2 cells compared to somatic gonadal tissue are
regulated by PUM proteins
Of the many cellular processes regulated by PUM proteins, those involved in germ cell
development are of particular interest due to implications to understand infertility in humans
(for review see (Goldstrohm et al., 2018)). Therefore, we determined which genes highly and
selectively expressed in germ cells are under PUM1 and/or PUM2 regulation. To this end, we
first identified genes whose expression in germ cells was at least six times higher than in
human testis somatic gonadal tissue by comparing TCam-2 transcriptomic data with the
previously published transcriptome of human testis somatic gonadal tissue (Irie et al., 2015).
This comparison identified 565 genes highly expressed in TCam-2 (Fig. 6A), including 22
regulated by PUM proteins. Specifically, we identified 13 genes regulated by PUM1 alone, 5
genes regulated by PUM2 alone and 4 by both.
To confirm that these 22 selected genes are under PUM1 and/or PUM2 regulation, we
measured their expression by RT-qPCR in TCam-2 cells untreated or treated with PUM1
siRNA, PUM2 siRNA or both PUM1 and PUM2 siRNA. By this approach, we validated 19
of the 22 genes to be regulated by PUM proteins (Fig. 6B, C, D and Table S8) of which 11
(of 13) genes were regulated by PUM1 alone, 4 (of 5) mRNAs were regulated by PUM2

alone, and 4 (of 4) genes were regulated by both PUM1 and PUM2. The 11 genes regulated
by PUM1 alone encode SHISA3, RAP1GAP2, NFKB2, IRX2, FGFR3, GRHL1, WWC1,
FRMD6, CAMKV, PVRL4 and ADD2 (Table S8). Six of the eleven PUM1-regulated genes
are associated with failure or cancer of the male as well as the female reproductive system.
The 4 genes regulated by PUM2 alone encode RASSF2, SNX10, RGS9 and PPP1R16B
(Table S8), which function in prostate tumour suppression, osteoporosis malignancy, nervous
system development and endothelial cell proliferation, respectively. The 4 genes regulated by
both PUM1 and PUM2 encode DOCK9, ADAMTS9, GABRQ and ANKRD1, which are
involved in filopodia formation in cervical cancer, cell cycle regulation and ovary cancer
progression, promotion of cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, downregulation of
apoptosis, respectively. Three of these genes are associated with cancer of the reproductive
system (Table S8).
We found that the majority of those PUM1- and PUM2-regulated targets are involved
in cancer (16 among 19), including 10 in cancer of male or female reproductive system.
PUM2-regulated PPP1R16B is functionally unique because it is the only PUM target that
regulates phosphorylation. RT-qPCR validation of such a high proportion of genes indicates
that our approach for PUM target identification was accurate.
Surprisingly, only 11 of the 19 validated genes contained at least one classic
UGUAHAUW motif (Fig. 6 B, C, D dark grey bars), but all of them contain motifs with
single nucleotide substitution in last 5 positions in comparison to classic PBE.

We next sought to determine whether PUM-regulated genes in the male germ cell line, TCam2, are associated with male infertility. To this end, from a list of 501 genes, which have been
validated to cause infertility when mutated or disrupted in humans and/or mice (Matzuk &
Lamb, 2008), we selected 11 genes that were also found in this study to be regulated by
PUMs (Fig. 7A and Table S8). Upon PUM1 and PUM2 gene siRNA knockdown followed by
RT-qPCR for these 11 genes, we validated 9 of them as PUM1/PUM2 targets. Of these 9
genes, 3 were regulated by PUM1 alone (Fig. 7B), 4 were regulated by PUM2 alone (Fig.
7C), and 2 were regulated by both PUM1 and PUM2 (Fig. 7D). We found, however, that only
2 of the PUM1-regulated (FGFR2 and NCOA6) and 1 of the PUM1/PUM2-regulated
(LMTK2) genes contained at least 1 classic UGUAHAUW motif (Fig. 7B, C, D), and all of
them also contain motifs with single nucleotide substitution in last 5 positions in comparison
to PBE. Dysfunction of all of the above 9 genes have been reported to be associated with male
infertility or testis cancer (Table S8).

DISCUSSION
Considering high structural similarity of PUM1 and PUM2, it is still unresolved whether they
form separate regulons in mammals. Here, for the first time, by combining RIP-Seq and
siRNA-Seq data together with co-IP LC/MS identification of putative protein cofactors, RNA
binding motif enrichment and GO analysis (for the first time each group of data originating
from the same cells – TCam-2 cells) we obtained a model of regulatory networks distinct for
PUM1 and PUM2. These networks are reminiscent of previously proposed regulons (Keene,
2007). Importantly, a global PUM-dependant gene expression regulation was not studied in
germ cells, except C. elegans (Kershner & Kimble, 2010, Prasad et al., 2016).

It is important to note that several of our RIP-Seq identified targets overlapped with
mRNAs previously identified in HeLa (Galgano et al., 2008) and HEK293 (Bohn et al., 2018,
Hafner et al., 2010) cells, validating our results. However, it is also important to bear in mind
that PUM-mediated activation or repression, or lack of PUM regulation may be cell-typespecific (Cottrell, Chaudhari et al., 2018). Therefore, we can expect only a partial target
overlap when PUM targets from different types of cells are compared.
Furthermore, we found a much higher average representation of PBE-containing
mRNAs that were selected as regulated by PUM1 and PUM2 based on combined analysis of
RIP-Seq and PUM siRNA-Seq (96.80 and 99.80%, respectively), than in targets selected
based on RIP-Seq alone (90.80 and 85.90%, respectively) or siRNA-Seq alone (59.68,
57.50%, respectively) which additionally validates our approach (Fig. 2B). We also analysed
PBE motif distribution in the 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR of individual mRNA targets. We
found that in mRNAs repressed by PUM1 or PUM2, PBEs were mostly localized in the
3’UTR, less frequently in CDS and rarely in the 5’UTR, as already reported (Bohn et al.,
2018). Instead, in mRNAs positively regulated (activated/stabilized) by PUM1 or PUM2,
PBE motifs were significantly more frequent in the 5’UTR (14.67% for PUM1 and 16.47%
for PUM2) than in mRNAs negatively (repressed) by PUM1 and PUM2 (3.75 and 4.42%,
respectively). However, this was not reported in studies on HEK293 cells (Bohn et al., 2018).
Although this observation requires further studies, it may suggest that activation of these
mRNAs by PUM proteins requires PBE localization in the vicinity of some 5’UTR
translational signals. It is important to note that among PUM-regulated mRNAs, there are also
a small number of targets with no PBE (approximately 3% PUM1- and below 1% PUM2regulated). As mentioned above, PUM proteins may recognize motifs slightly different to the
canonical UGUAHAUW (Jarmoskaite et al., 2019, Sajek et al., 2018). Such variant motifs
were not evaluated in this study, and therefore, putative mRNA targets carrying such motifs

were overlooked. It is also important to emphasize, that in our approach, PUM-regulated
mRNAs whose level remained unchanged (do not undergo degradation or stabilization) were
overlooked. PUM-regulated mRNA repression with no degradation but rather storage in Pbodies was recently suggested to be quite common in human HEK293 cells (Hubstenberger,
Courel et al., 2017).
Interestingly, by using RIP-Seq approach we identified 30% of PUM1/PUM2-bound
common targets. However, combination of RIP-Seq with siRNA knockdown to identify
regulated targets, resulted in a decrease of common targets to 10%. We propose that this
difference is due to the involvement of distinct regulatory factors for each PUM paralogue. It
is worth emphasizing that we identified such regulatory factors – putative PUM-interacting
protein cofactors which control different aspects of RNA metabolism (stability, localization,
transport, splicing and expression regulation), whose interaction was RNA-mediated as well
as protein cofactors whose interaction was RNA-independent. Substantial number of protein
cofactors were PUM1- or PUM2-specific in both groups. The first group of RNA-dependent
protein cofactors contains only RBPs, which was expected and validates our experiments as
well as the analysis performed. However, RBPs were also significantly enriched in the second
group representing RNA-independent protein-protein interactions. Such RBPs are likely to
contain protein-protein interacting domains that bind PUM, as well as RNA-interacting
domains that bind RNA. Finally, interactors with no RNA-binding domains might be
important for the stabilization of ribonucleoprotein complexes, which are formed upon PUM
protein binding specific mRNA targets.
Among the identified PUM putative protein interactors, we found five previously
reported human PUM binding proteins, which validates our results. MATR3 and SEC16A,
were previously identified in a high-throughput proteomic study in HeLa cells (Hein, Hubner

et al., 2015). Another one is G3BP1, which is a stress granule assembly factor (Jain, Wheeler
et al., 2016). The next one is the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMR1) and its
autosomal homologous proteins, FXR1 and FXR2. FMR1 was previously shown to colocalize with PUM2 in rat neurons stress granules (Vessey, Vaccani et al., 2006). More
recently, Zhang and co-workers reported that FMR1 interacts with PUM in the murine brain
in an RNA-dependent manner (Zhang et al., 2017). In our study, FMR1 proteins were
identified as both PUM RNA-dependent and independent interactors. Interactions with
G3BP1 and FMR1 may suggest that PUM paralogues are components of stress granules not
only in mammalian neurons (Vessey et al., 2006), but also in human germ cells. The presence
of both PUM paralogues in stress granules suggests their involvement in RNA storage.
Interestingly, PUM proteins were also found in P-bodies of HEK293 cells, which, according
to a recent report (Hubstenberger et al., 2017), store high numbers of mRNAs.
Based on our results we propose that cooperation of such protein cofactors (mainly
RBPs) with PUM1 or PUM2 enables regulation of selected groups of RNA targets which is
responsible for a given metabolic pathway in TCam-2 cells. Notably, we found that a number
of mRNAs which are enriched in TCam-2 cells compared to somatic gonadal tissue or cause
infertility when mutated, are under the control of separate PUM1 or PUM2 regulons which is
in line with their divergent functions. Additionally, each of them consists of sub-regulons.
NFKB2, FGFR3, FGFR2 and NCOA6 are PUM1 targets (mRNAs are shown in Table S7
functions and citations are in Table S8). NFKB2 which is involved in aberrant activation of
androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells, might be co-regulated by FXR2, NCL and
HNRNPA1 proteins. FGFR3 which has a role in testis tumour development might be coregulated by a different set, SFPQ, FXR2 and HNRNPA1. FGFR2, which mutations were
associated with hypospadias, might be co-regulated by SFPQ, NCL and HNRNPA1. Finally,
NCOA6 which is involved in embryo implantation might be co-regulated by a large group of

the following proteins: SFPQ, FXR1, FXR2, NCL, HNRNPA1, MATR3, PABPC1, IGFBP3,
YBX1, NUDT21, IGF2BP1, PABPC4 and CPSF7. The same rule is observed in case of
PUM2 targets involved in reproduction, RASSF2, EGFR, CFTR and SPAG9 (Table S7 and
S8). RASSF2 which is a tumour-suppressor in prostate cancer mouse model might be coregulated by FXR1, FXR2, HNRNPA1, PTBP1, G3BP1, HNRNPF and SRSF7. EGFR, the
signalling dysfunction of which was associated with human male infertility might be coregulated by FXR1, FXR2, NCL, HNRNPA1, G3BP2, G3BP1, FMR1, SRSF7 and SRSF1.
CFTR, mutations of which are associated with male infertility, might be co-regulated by
FXR1, NCL, HNRNPA1, MATR3, PABPC1, G3BP2, FMR1, SRSF7 and SRSF1. Finally,
SPAG9, which stimulates prostate cancer cell proliferation might be co-regulated by FXR1,
FXR2, NCL, HNRNPA1, MATR3, PABPC1, PTBP1, G3BP2, G3BP1, HNRNPF, FMR1 and
SRSF7.
Therefore, we propose that identification of germ cell-associated groups of targets that
are PUM1- or PUM2-specific indicates non-redundant roles of PUM paralogues in controlling
processes of human reproduction. Notably, majority the PUM-regulated genes enriched in
TCam-2 cells are genes involved in the development of several types of cancer, mostly of
reproductive system (Table S8). This observation is in concordance with the fact that TCam2 cells originate from seminoma testis germ cell tumour (de Jong et al., 2008).
Interestingly, although these PUM regulatory networks are distinct for each paralogue,
they overlap at some points where PUM1 and PUM2 regulate some common targets and
interact with some common protein cofactors (Table S5 and S6). On the other hand, a PUM
cofactor may regulate a specific pathway dependent on binding PUM1 or PUM2. For
example, FXR2 may regulate endosome transport by binding PUM1 or Rho protein signal

transduction by binding PUM2. Likewise, SFPQ may regulate cytosolic or endosome
transport by binding PUM1 or endothelium development by binding PUM2.
The majority of selected PUM targets enriched in TCam-2 cells compared to gonadal
tissue, have been reported to be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation and
apoptosis (Table S8), processes that are important for the maintenance of germ-line status and
that are under precise regulation to ensure fertility. This functional profile is also in line with
the recent suggestion that the evolutionarily original role of PUM proteins is regulation of
stem cell self-renewal, including germline stem cells renewal (Bohn et al., 2018), which the
above-mentioned three processes strongly influence.
Further studies of posttranscriptional mechanisms of gene expression regulation
controlled by PUM proteins in the context of human germ cells are particularly important in
light of the increasing problem of male and female infertility occurring worldwide in
contemporary populations, as well as the increasing incidence of testis germ cell tumours in
young men. In addition, it would be important to study the impact of PUM proteins on stem
cell fate, growth and development, in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. This
may provide insight into their diverse roles and enable future therapeutic strategies to target
diseases arising from PUM and PUM-target dysfunctions.

Seq experiments with UV cross-linking were performed using the Magna RIPTM RNABinding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (17-700 Merck). Briefly, 100 μl of Magnetic A/G
beads were coated with 12 μg anti-PUM1 (S-19, sc-65188 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antiPUM2 (K-14, sc-31535 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or IgG fraction from nonimmunized goat serum (G9759, Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min at room temperature (RT) in
Magna RIP Wash Buffer. TCam-2 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subjected
to UV cross-linking at 254 nm on a HEROLAB CL-1 Cross-linker for 30 s (0.015 J). For one
RIP-Seq reaction, 2-3x106 cells were lysed in 500 μl of Magna RIP Lysis Buffer for 30 min
with rotation at 4°C. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was mixed with precoated beads suspended in washing buffer supplemented with protease and RNase inhibitors.
The RIP reaction was held for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotator in a final volume of 1 ml. Then,
magnetic beads were washed five times with Magna RIP Washing Buffer followed by
treatment with proteinase K at 55 °C for 30 minutes. Total RNA was isolated from magnetic
beads using a QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
RNA quality was checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer using an RNA 6000 Nano Kit. RNA
with a RIN value >7 was used for further steps. cDNA libraries for RNA-Seq analysis were
prepared using Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep V2, and subsequent next-generation
sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform by Macrogen INC.
Sequencing was performed under the following conditions: Paired-End reads were 100 nt
long, and >70 million reads/sample were obtained. RIP-Seq with anti-PUM1, PUM2, and IgG
(negative control) were performed in triplicate. For TCam-2 transcriptome analysis, total
RNA was isolated from 80% confluent 10 cm2 dishes using a QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro
Kit. RNA quality control and RNA-Seq were performed as described above. An mRNA level
that was at least 2-fold enriched (with adjusted P-value<0.05) in anti-PUM1/PUM2 co-IP, in

Western blot analysis
To check for PUM1 and PUM2 binding efficiency, SDS lysates from beads after co-IP were
resolved on 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(BioRad). Membranes were blocked with 5% low-fat milk in TBS buffer supplemented with
0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) at RT for 1 hour. Membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight in blocking buffer. On the next day, membranes were washed 4
times in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies at RT for 1 h in the same buffer. The following antibodies
were used: goat anti-PUM1 (1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology #S-19, sc-65188), goat antiPUM2 (1:250 Santa Cruz Biotechnology #K-14, sc-31535), rabbit anti-actin beta (ACTB)
(1:10000 Sigma Aldrich, A2066) and HRP-linked anti-goat (1:50000 Santa Cruz
Biotechnology #sc-2020), as well as HRP-linked anti-rabbit (1:25000 Sigma Aldrich A0545).
Next, membranes were washed twice in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, and then twice in
TBS buffer. ClarityTM ECL Western Blotting Substrate (BioRad) and the ChemiDoc Touch
Imaging System (BioRad) were used for signal development and analysis. To check the
silencing efficiency of PUM1 and PUM2, SDS lysates were prepared from cells 72 h posttransfection and analysed in the same way as lysates from beads.

(2.2.1.0) followed by merging replicates with CUFFMERGE and calculating differential gene
expression with CUFFDIFF (2.2.1.5).
For selection of mRNAs potentially bound to PUM1, PUM2 or both, the following
criteria were used: 1) only mRNAs enriched in all 3 replicates; 2) at least 2-fold enrichment in
PUM1 or PUM2 IPs, compared to IgG; and 3) at least 2-fold mRNA enrichment in
comparison to TCam-2 transcriptome. To annotate mRNAs bound by PUM to their cellspecific functions and pathways, we performed GO analysis using BiNGO plug-in (version
3.0.3) (Maere et al., 2005) on Cytoscape platform (version 3.6.1) with functional annotation
of biological process and molecular function, searched against TCam-2 cell line gene

mRNAs, we used the DREME motif discovery tool (ver.4.12.0), which enables the
identification of short uninterrupted motifs that were enriched in our sequences compared

and CDS sequences were downloaded from the RefSeq Genes Genomic Sequence database
(Table browser: assembly: Feb. 2009(GRCh37/hg19); track: NCBI RefSeq).

siRNA silencing of PUM proteins
TCam-2 cells were transfected with siRNA using PUM1 siRNA (sc-62912 Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), PUM2 siRNA (sc-44773) containing 3 different siRNAs for each PUM gene
(their sequences are in Table S9) or control siRNA-A (sc-37007) at the final 40 nM
concentration using the NEON transfection/electroporation system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Transfections were performed in Buffer R using 10 µl NEON tips. Subsequently,
after transfection, cells were cultured in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% FBS (HyClone) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 72 h. Transfection was performed in 3
biological replicates. RNA isolation was performed using a QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit.
RNA quality analysis was performed as described above, RNA with RIN>9 was used for
cDNA library preparation, and subsequent sequencing was performed as described above. The
knockdown efficiency of each replicate was analysed by western blot.

Bioinformatic identification of mRNAs under regulation by PUM proteins
More than 80 million reads per sample obtained from the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform were
analysed as described above. If the mRNA level increased by at least 20% (adjusted Pvalue<0.05) under 70-90% PUM knockdown compared to negative siRNA control, the
mRNA was considered to be under PUM repression. If the mRNA level decreased by at least
20%, it was considered to be significantly activated by PUM. We set the threshold at 20% as
sufficient given that these changes were found in 3 biological replicates (adjusted P24

and 90%, respectively) (Fig. S1C).

RT-qPCR analysis of mRNA regulation after PUM1 and PUM2 knockdown
To validate the targets regulated by PUM1 and PUM2, TCam-2 cells were transfected in 3
biological replicates with siRNA as described above. RNA from cells was isolated using
TRIzol reagent (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. ~1 µg of total RNA was
treated with DNase I (D5307, Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at RT and reverse transcribed using
the Maxima First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1671, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was performed on generated cDNA using Jump-Start Taq
DNA Polymerase (D4184, Sigma-Aldrich), CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System
(BioRad) and SYBR Green dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 3 biological replicates with at
least 5 technical replicates of each reaction. The list of primers used for RT-qPCR is shown in
Table S10. All changes in mRNA levels upon PUM1 or PUM2 knockdown were normalized
to ACTB and GAPDH.

Mass spectrometry analysis after anti-PUM1 and anti-PUM2 immunoprecipitation
Six biological replicates of co-IPs (three performed without RNase A treatment, and another
three with 100 mg/ml RNase A) with anti-PUM1, anti-PUM2 antibodies (including anti-IgG
negative control to validate specificity of PUM1 and PUM2 antibodies and lack of cross
reactivity) were performed as described above (Table S1). We used these antibodies in our

databases (Fig. 4D). Motif enrichment analysis was performed on the identified mRNA
targets of PUMs (Fig. 1H) by FIMO (http://meme-suite.org/doc/fimo.html) using a greaterthan-average threshold (FIMO analysis with P-value <0.01; mRNAs for GO analysis bigger
than average motif enrichment per sequence). mRNA groups regulated by PUM1 or PUM2
with the enrichment of the binding motif putative of RBP cofactors of the respective PUM
(Fig. 4) were determined for each PUM-RBP co factor pair, in comparison to negative control
mRNAs (not bound and not changed under PUM1 and PUM2 silencing). To avoid influence
of sequence length, we selected negative sequences, which average length were similar
(4177nt, in range 3000-16321) to PUM1 (4817nt, in range 449-16862) and PUM2 (5442nt, in
range 412-16862) regulated mRNAs. As the next step, GO analysis of biological processes on
identified groups was performed using ClueGO version 2.5.2 (Bindea, Mlecnik et al., 2009).
Pathways with P-values≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Visualization of the regulon was
performed using Cytoscape platform version 3.6.1.
