Abstract

32

Nisin A is a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis and is widely used as a food

33

preservative. Staphylococcus aureus has the BraRS-VraDE system providing resistance

34

against low concentrations of nisin A. The BraRS is one of a two-component system

35

that senses nisin A by BraS and finally induces the expression of ABC transporter

36

VraDE by phosphorylated BraR. Previously, we isolated a highly nisin A resistant strain

37

with increased VraDE expression due to a mutation of braRS. In this study, we isolated

38

a BraRS-VraDE-independent, nisin A resistant mutant from S. aureus MW2. These

39

mutants, designated SAN2 (S. aureus nisin resistant) and SAN469, had a mutation in

40

pmtR (MW1875) which encodes a transcriptional regulator responsible for the

41

expression of the pmtA-D operon. As a result, this mutant exhibited a high level of

42

constitutive production of PmtA-D, a transporter responsible for the export of phenol

43

soluble modulin (PSM). We also obtained two pmtA-D overexpressing, nisin A resistant

44

mutants which contained a point mutation in pmtR from other S. aureus strains.

45

Characterization of the mutants revealed that they have a decreased susceptibility to

46

human beta defensin-3 and LL37, which are innate immune factors. Additionally, these

47

mutants showed higher hemolytic activity than the MW2 original strain. Furthermore, in

48

a mouse bacteremia model, the SAN2 strain exhibited a lower survival rate than the

the pmtR mutation is an alternative nisin A resistance, which also affects virulence in S.

Author Summary

54

Recently, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA, MDRP and

55

CRE have brought serious problems for chemotherapy in the world. In addition, many

56

antibacterial agents such as disinfectants and food additives are widely used. Therefore,

57

it raises the possibility that bacteria are becoming resistant to all antibacterial agents. In

58

this study, we investigated whether S. aureus become resistant against nisin A, one of

59

the food additives. Finally, we isolated nisin A highly resistant S. aureus strains. Among

60

these strains, we identified that one strain designated as SAN2 showed nisin A

61

resistance by the overproduction of Pmts which were involved in the secretion of

62

virulence factors called PSMs. We identified a mutation of pmtR gene encoding a

63

regulator for pmt genes. SAN2 strain showed the decreased susceptibility to human

64

antimicrobial peptides and the increased hemolytic activity. Finally, SAN2 showed

65

higher lethal activity in mouse bacteremia model. Our study provides new insights into

Introduction
Bacteriocins are defined as antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria. Many

72

bacteriocins have been reported in a wide range of bacterial species including

73

Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (1-4). Bacteriocins are mainly divided into

74

two groups, lantibiotics and nonlantibiotics. Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides that

75

contain unusual amino acids, the lanthionines (5, 6). Nisin A is one of the lantibiotics

76

produced by Lactococcus lactis (7). The target of nisin A is lipid II, which is involved

77

in cell wall biosynthesis (8, 9). The binding of nisin A to lipid II inhibits cell wall

78

biosynthesis and eventually causes the formation of pores or disturbances in bacterial

79

membranes. Generally, bacteriocin has a strong antibacterial activity against closely

80

related species. However, nisin A has a broad range of antibacterial activities mainly

81

against gram-positive bacteria, including species of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and

82

Clostridium (10-15). Due to its broad range activity, nisin A is widely used as a food

83

additive throughout the world for the prevention of food-borne poisoning (10, 16, 17).

84

Additionally, the use of bacteriocins, including nisin A, as clinical antibacterial agents

85

has been investigated (10, 13, 18).

86
87

S. aureus is a commensal bacterium in human; generally localizes in the nasal cavity,
skin and intestine; and sometimes causes opportunistic infections such as suppurative

88

diseases, pneumonia and sepsis (19-21). Additionally, S. aureus causes food-borne

89

poisoning because this organism produces several heat-stable enterotoxins (20). Since

90

some foods contain nisin A as a preservative, S. aureus is sometimes exposed to nisin A

91

(10, 22). Previously, we and other groups have demonstrated that a two-component

92

system (TCS) named BraRS is responsible for resistance to nisin A (23, 24). When S.

93

aureus cells are exposed to nisin A, BraS senses nisin A, and phosphorylation of BraR

94

then occurs. Phosphorylated BraR binds upstream of vraDE which encodes an ABC

95

transporter responsible for nisin A resistance. However, a high concentration of nisin A

96

is still effective against S. aureus cells (14). Previously, to determine whether nisin A

97

treatment induces higher nisin A resistance, we tried to isolate nisin A mutants that

98

showed increased levels of nisin A resistance by the incubation with sub-minimum

99

inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nisin A and finally obtained three mutants that

100

constitutively expressed high level of VraDE (25). We found point mutations in the

101

promoter region of braRS, the braR or braS coding region in each mutant. In this study,

102

to explore potential nisin A resistance mechanisms independent of the BraRS-VraDE

103

system, we tried to isolate S. aureus strains highly resistant to nisin A by exposing S.

104

aureus to nisin A, and eventually obtained BraRS-VraDE independent nisin A resistant

A resistance mechanism and the mutations also affect the virulence of S. aureus.

Isolation of S. aureus strains highly resistant to nisin A

111

Previously, we obtained three types of S. aureus strains highly resistant to nisin A,

112

which showed increased levels of vraDE expression (25). We further tried to isolate

113

strains highly resistant to nisin A. From two independent experiments, we obtained two

114

mutants that showed no increased expression of vraDE. We designated these mutants

115

SAN2 and SAN469. The MICs of SAN2 and SAN469 against nisin A were 2,048 µg/ml,

116

while the MIC of the MW2 original strain was 512 µg/ml.

117

We also evaluated the MICs of these mutants against bacitracin, gallidermin and

118

nukacin ISK-1, which also inhibit the lipid cycle for cell wall biosynthesis (Table 3).

119

There was no difference in MICs for these three agents between the mutants and the

120

MW2 original strain.

123

To identify the factors responsible for high resistance to nisin A, we investigated the

124

expression of all genes located on the chromosome of MW2. As shown in Table 4, the

125

expression of MW1875 to MW1871 was significantly increased in the SAN2 strain,

126

with more than 30-fold higher expression levels than that of the MW2 original strain in

127

the absence of nisin A. MW1875-MW1871 were previously associated with

128

phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) transport and designated PmtR (MW1875) and PmtA -

129

PmtD (MW1874-71) (30). It was reported that pmtR encodes the transcriptional

130

regulator (PmtR), and PmtA-D constitute a PSM transporter. In strain SAN2, the

131

expression levels of several other genes were also increased, but too much lower extents

132

(3- to 5-fold greater than the MW2 levels). We also confirmed the increased expression

133

of MW1875 to MW1871 in SAN469 by quantitative PCR with the method described in

134

Materials and Methods.

135
136

Effects of the inactivation of MW1875 or MW1874 on the nisin A susceptibility

137

From microarray analysis, we thought MW1875-MW1871 were associated with high

138

resistance to nisin A. Therefore, we constructed corresponding inactivation mutants to

139

examine whether these genes truly contributed to high nisin A resistance. Since pmtR

140

and pmtA-D (MW1875-1871) formed an operon, we constructed two insertional

141

mutants (MM2278 and MM2153), in which pYT1 was integrated in MW1875 or

142

MW1874 of strain SAN2, and one insertional mutant (MM2202) with an insertion in

143

MW1875 of strain MW2. The two SAN2 mutants showed the same MIC against nisin A

144

as that of MW2. Similarly, the MW2 mutant (MM2202) retained the same MIC as that

145

of MW2 (Table 5). A complement strain MM2279, in which the pmtRABCD operon

146

(MW1875-1871) was expressed by pCL15 in MM2278, also showed a similar MIC as

147

that of SAN2.

148
149

DNA sequences of the MW1875 to 1871 (pmtR and pmtA to D) regions

150

The DNA sequences of the MW1875-1871 regions in MW2, SAN2 and SAN469 were

151

determined. In SAN2, only one mutation was detected in MW1875 (Fig. 1). This

152

mutation induced an alanine (Ala) at 43rd amino acid of MW1875 to aspartic acid (Asp)

153

in SAN2 strains. In SAN469, the fifth amino acid position in MW1875 was mutated

154

into a stop codon (Fig. 1).

155
156

Isolation of strains highly resistant to nisin A from other S. aureus strains

To determine whether similar pmtR mutants were able to be obtained from other strains

158

by the exposure to nisin A, we isolated nisin A resistant mutants from S. aureus COL

159

and TY34. From two independent experiments in each strain, we obtained two mutants

160

with increased expression of pmtRABCD, one from each strain. We designated the

161

mutants SAN233 (from COL) and SAN455 (from TY34). DNA sequencing analysis

162

identified point mutations at the 16th and 93rd amino acids of MW1875 (PmtR) in

163

SAN233 and SAN455, respectively, while there was no mutation in the pmtA-D genes.

164

These two mutations introduced stop codons within the pmtR gene. Therefore, SAN233

165

and SAN455 did not express full-length PmtR.

166
167

Expression of PmtR (MW1875), PmtA (MW1874) and vraD in the MW2 and its

168

mutants

169

We investigated the expression of pmtR, pmtA and vraD by quantitative PCR. In SAN2,

170

the expression of pmtR and pmtA was significantly increased compared to that of the

171

MW2 in the absence of nisin A (Fig. 2A). We observed the same result by

172

immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 2B). In addition, the expression patterns of PmtR and

173

PmtA in the absence of nisin A were quite similar to those in the presence of nisin A

174

because the expression of pmtR and pmtA was not induced by nisin A (supplemental Fig.

175

2). Additionally, we investigated the expression of vraD and found that SAN2 showed

176

no increase in vraD expression at a low concentration of nisin A (32 µg/ml), while

177

MW2 showed increased expression of vraD (Fig. 2C). However, the inactivation of

178

pmtRABCD in SAN2 resulted in an increaseed vraD expression in the presence of nisin

179

A.

180

Then, we investigate the vraD expression in the presence of various concentrations of

181

nisin A (Fig. 3A) In MW2, the expression of vraD was induced at concentrations above

182

1/32 MIC nisin A (16 µg/ml), while in SAN2, it was induced above 1/2 MIC nisin A

183

(1024 µg/ml). We further investigated the induction of vraD expression by bacitracin (1

184

MIC=64 µg/ml). Since the MIC of bacitracin was the same in the MW2 and SAN2

185

strains, we analyzed the effect of bacitracin at a range from 1/64 MIC to 1 MIC. The

186

vraD expression in both strains was similarly induced by bacitracin at each

187

concentration (Fig. 3B).

197

Hemolytic activity in the MW2, SAN2 and MM2278

198

Since PSM transported by PmtA-D has been demonstrated to be involved in hemolytic

199

activity (32), we thought that overexpression of PmtA-D affected the hemolytic activity,

200

we next analyzed hemolytic activities of strains MW2 and SAN2 on sheep blood agar.

201

Compared to MW2 wild type, SAN2 produced a larger hemolytic zone (Fig. 5A). When

202

pmtR and pmtA-D (pmtR-D: MW1875 to MW1871) were inactivated in SAN2

203

(MM2278), the hemolytic zone became smaller than that of SAN2. The hemolytic zone

204

produced by the complement stain MM2279 was similar in size as that of SAN2 (Fig.

205

5A).

206

It was reported that PSM or delta-hemolysin enhanced the activity of beta-hemolysin

207

(33). Since MW2 (and SAN2) do not produce beta-hemolysin, we investigated a

208

synergy hemolytic activity of strains SAN2 and RN4220 (which produces

209

beta-hemolysin). An enhanced hemolytic zone was produced (black arrows) by SAN2

210

and RN4220, while MW2 and MM2278 did not have an enhanced hemolytic effect with

211

RN4220 (Fig. 5B).

Susceptibility to LL37 and hBD3 in theMW2, SAN2, MM2278 and MM2279
Since it was reported that pmtR-D inactivation increased the susceptibility to LL37 and

215

hBD3 in a previous study (34), we investigated the effect of overexpression of PmtA-D

216

in SAN2 on the susceptibility to hBD3 (Fig. 6) and LL37 (supplemental Fig. 3). As

217

shown in Fig. 6, compared to the MW2 original strain, SAN2 showed a decrease in

218

susceptibility to hBD3, while the inactivation of pmtR-D increased susceptibility to the

219

peptides, resulting in the same susceptibility as the MW2. The complement strain

220

showed similar susceptibility with that of SAN2.

Mice survival rate with injection of the MW2, SAN2 and MM2278
Finally, we performed the mouse survival experiment using the bacteremia model.

224

Injection of the MW2 strain killed only one mouse out of the 8 mice 3 days after

225

injection, while 5 of 8 mice were killed between 1 to 5 days after the injection of SAN2

226

(Fig. 7A, P=0.010, log-rank test). No mouse was killed by the injection of the SAN2

227

pmtR-D inactivation strains (MM2278) (Fig. 7B, P=0.002, log-rank test).

231

independent from BraRS-VraDE system. We obtained 4 PmtA-D-overexpressing

232

mutant strains from MW2, COL and TY34 that acquired high nisin A resistance. All

233

these mutants had a point mutation in the pmtR gene, yielding a mutant PmtR with an

234

Ala43D substitution (SAN2 from MW2) or truncated PmtR (SAN469 from MW2,

235

SAN233 from COL and SAN455 from TY34). EMSAs showed that the SAN2-derived

236

PmtR protein (SAN2-rPmtR) did not bind the DNA region upstream of pmtR-D. Since

237

PmtR is a negative transcriptional regulator of the pmtRABCD operon (31),

238

SAN2-PmtR and the other three truncated PmtRs could not suppress the expression of

239

the pmtR-D operon, resulting in the overexpression of pmtR-D. The mutation site of

240

PmtR in SAN2 is within helix-turn-helix DNA binding region. Based on our EMSA

241

assay, a mutated-PmtR in SAN2 lost the binding ability to the target DNA region,

242

suggesting that the mutation site is the critical for DNA binding or mutated-PmtR in

243

SAN2 occuers a structural change. PmtA-D form an ABC transporter from two

244

membrane proteins (PmtA and C) and two ATPases (PmtB and D) (30). PmtA-D is

245

involved in the transportation of PSMs and delta-hemolysin (Hld) from the cytoplasm to

246

the extracellular space (30,32). PSMs have versatile virulence activity such as surface

247

spreading activity responsible for epithelial colonization, biofilm formation,

248

proinflammatory activity, cytolytic activity and antimicrobial activity (35, 36). In

249

addition, Cheung GYC et al. have recently reported that the Pmt transporter is also

250

associated with human-derived antimicrobial peptides such as hBD3 and LL37 (34). We

251

also found that high expression of Pmt transporters in SAN2 resulted in high resistance

252

against LL37 and hBD3. Although there are no clear structural similarities among PSMs,

253

delta-hemolysin, hBD3 and LL37, all these peptides have membrane insertional activity.

254

Based on these findings, we consider nisin A, which also has membrane insertional

255

activity, to be exported by the Pmt system. Therefore, the high nisin A resistance in

256

SAN2, SAN469, SAN233 and SAN455 is mediated by overexpression of PmtA-D.

257

However, we also evaluated the susceptibility to gallidermin, bacitracin and nukacin

258

ISK-1 and found no difference between MW2 and SAN2 strains. Nukacin ISK-1 is

259

functionally close to nisin A because these are lantibiotics with the same target, lipid II

260

(4, 8). These results indicate that the Pmt system recognizes the limited antimicrobial

261

peptides with membrane insertional activity.

262

Joo HS et al. demonstrated that PSMα1-3 binds PmtR to release it from its target DNA

263

region, which is followed by induction of the expression of the pmt operon (31). PSM

264

expression is upregulated by the agr system (32, 35). Since agr expression increases

265

from the late exponential phase (37, 38), the expression levels of PSM and PmtA-D are

266

267

expression was independent of the growth phase due to the lack of functional PmtR

268

(data not shown). Therefore, PmtA-D are constitutively overproduced, thus PSMs are

269

constantly exported to outside the cell during SAN2 growth. As mentioned above,

270

PSMs have versatile virulent activities, so the increased PSM transport may modulate

271

the virulence of S. aureus. To support this, SAN2 showed highly pathogenic. We found

272

that the hemolytic activity of SAN2 was greater than that of the MW2 wild type because

273

PSMα has an enhanced effect on hemolytic activity (33). Additionally, the susceptibility

274

to human antimicrobial peptides was decreased in the mutants. Finally, we found in a

275

mouse experiment that compared to the MW2 wild type, SAN2 showed an increase in

276

fatality rate. The Pmt-dependent nisin A resistance identified in this study is different

277

from the previously identified BraRS-VraDE system in terms of the modulation for

278

virulence in S. aureus.

279

Previously, we isolated strains highly resistant to nisin A that showed highly

280

constitutive expression of VraDE (25). VraDE, which is regulated by BraRS, is an

281

intrinsic resistance factor against nisin A, gallidermin, nukacin ISK-1 and bacitracin. In

282

MW2, sub-MIC (1/16 MIC) nisin A induced the expression of VraDE, while sub-MIC

283

nisin A did not induce its expression in SAN2. However, pmtA-D inactivation in SAN2

284

caused inducible expression of VraDE by sub-MIC nisin A. The induction of vraD

285

expression occurred at high concentrations of nisin A in SAN2, suggesting that the Pmt

286

system is an dominant system contribute to nisin A resistance in SAN2.

287

In conclusion, we found a new mechanism for high nisin A resistance that is

288

mediated by the overexpression of Pmts in S. aureus. It is important to note that Pmt

289

overexpression-dependent high nisin A resistance also enhances the virulence. Since

290

nisin A is widely used as a food additive, it is important to be careful in its use.

305

Isolation of mutants highly resistant to nisin A

306

S. aureus mutants highly resistant to nisin A were obtained by a method described

307

elsewhere (25). Briefly, a microdilution method that is generally used to evaluate the

308

minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibacterial agents was used for isolation

309

of the mutants. Overnight culture of S. aureus MW2 was diluted to 107 cells/ml, and 10

310

µl of the dilute culture was applied to each well (100 µl), which contained a 2-fold

311

dilution series of nisin A (16 to 16384 µg/ml). After incubation at 37°C overnight,

312

bacterial cells that grew at 1/2 MIC nisin A were taken and diluted 100 fold. Ten

313

microliters of this diluted sample was then applied to each well (100 µl), which

314

contained serial 2-fold dilutions of nisin A (16 to 16384 µg/ml). This procedure was

315

repeated three times. At the end, bacterial cells grown in the presence of 1/2 MIC nisin

316

A were appropriately diluted and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA). After overnight

317

incubation, 14 colonies were picked up and incubated in 5 ml of TSB. Overnight culture

318

was used for the determination of the MIC of nisin A. This experiment was

319

independently performed 3 times. Furthermore, we tried to isolate highly nisin

320

A-resistant mutants from other S. aureus strains.

Microarray analysis.

325

Overnight cultures of S. aureus (108 cells) were inoculated into 30 ml of fresh TSB and

326

cultured at 37°C with shaking. When the OD660 reached 0.4, the bacterial cells were

327

collected by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Total RNA was extracted by

328

using the FastRNA Pro Blue Kit (MP Biomedicals, Cleveland, OH, USA) according to

329

the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, cDNA of each sample was synthesized from 10 μg

330

of total RNA using the FairPlay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies,

331

Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Agilent

332

eArray platform (Agilent Technologies) was used to design the microarray: 13,939

333

probes (60-mers) were designed to target the 2,628 protein-coding genes of S. aureus

334

MW2 (up to five probes per gene). Microarray analysis was performed by a method

335

described elsewhere. The experiments were performed using two biological replicates

336

(two technical replicates for each set of conditions), and the expression data were

337

deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under

338

accession GSE131352.

DNA sequences of MW1875-1871 regions

341

Since we found the increased expression of genes corresponding to MW1875-1871 in

342

the SAN2 strain, we determined the DNA sequence of the MW1875-1871 regions.

343

Primers were constructed to amplify MW1875-1871 with their corresponding flanking

344

regions, including the promoter regions of MW1875 (Table 1). To prepare

345

chromosomal DNA from the MW2 original strain and the mutant strains, the cells from

346

1 ml of overnight cultures were collected. The cells were suspended in 100 µl of 10 mM

347

Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10 µg of lysostaphin (Sigma Aldrich), incubated at 37°C

348

for 20 min, and then incubated at 95°C for 15 min. After centrifugation, cell lysates

349

were used as template DNA for PCR. PCR was performed using the Takara Ex Taq

350

system, and the amplicons were purified using a QIAquick kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,

351

Germany). The nucleotide sequences of each DNA fragment were determined using

352

specific primers. The primers used to amplify DNA sequences are listed in Table 1.

357

elsewhere (26). An internal DNA fragment of MW1875 or MW1874 was amplified by

358

PCR using specific primers, and then cloned into a pYT1 vector. The plasmid was

359

electroporated into S. aureus RN4220, and then the plasmid in RN4220 was transferred

360

into respective strains by transduction using phage 80α. The obtained strains were

361

grown overnight at 30°C. The appropriate dilutions of the culture were poured on TSA

362

plates containing TC (10 µg/ml) and then incubated at 42°C overnight. Colonies were

363

picked up and replated on TSA containing TC. The disruption of the target gene was

364

checked by PCR. For gene complementation, the vector pCL15, which has an

365

isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter upstream of the

366

cloning site, was used. A DNA fragment for complementation was PCR-amplified using

367

chromosomal DNA from the MW2 or mutant strains. The DNA fragment was cloned

368

into pCL15 using E. coli XL-II competent cells. The obtained plasmid was

369

electroporated into S. aureus RN4220 and was subsequently transduced into the

370

appropriate strain using the phage 80α.

371

To obtain a mutant that constitutively expresses MW1874-1871 by their own promoter

372

upstream of MW1875 without MW1875 expression, we constructed a plasmid by PCR

373

cloning a DNA fragment containing the internal region of MW1875 (295 bp) and the

374

promoter region of MW1875-1871 (149 bp). Two PCR fragments were obtained and

375

then cloned into the pYT1 vector by using restriction enzymes. The plasmid was finally

376

transduced into the MW2 strain. The plasmid integration was performed with the

377

method described above. Two types of the mutants were obtained (Suppl. Fig. 1).

378

Finally, the strain that contained inactivated MW1875 and expressed MW1874-1871

379

was verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.

381

Quantitative PCR and immunoblotting analysis

382

Quantitative PCR was performed to investigate the expression of MW1875 (pmtR),

383

MW1874 (pmtA) and vraD. A small portion of overnight culture (108 cells) was

384

inoculated into 5 ml of fresh TSB and then grown at 37°C with shaking. When the

385

optical density at 660 nm reached 0.5, nisin A (32 µg/ml) or bacitracin (32 µg/ml) was

386

added to the bacterial culture. After incubating for 15 min (for quantitative PCR) and 2

387

h (for immunoblotting), the bacterial cells were collected. For quantitative PCR, RNA

388

extraction, cDNA synthesis and PCR were performed as described previously (25).

389

For immunoblotting, antiserum against MW1875 and MW1874 was obtained by

390

immunizing rabbit with the recombinant protein as described previously (27). Briefly,

391

the coding region of MW1875 or MW1874 amplified by PCR using specific primers

392

was cloned into pQE30 (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) which is used for the construction of

393

histidine-tagged recombinant proteins. The obtained plasmid was transformed into E.

394

coli M15 (pREP4). The resulting recombinant protein was purified according to the

395

manufacturer’s instructions. Antiserum was obtained using recombinant protein. We

396

also immunoblotted VraD using anti-rVraD obtained previously.

397

The collected bacterial cells were resuspended in 200 µl of Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)

398

containing 10 µg of lysostaphin and incubated for 20 min at 37C. The cells were then

399

heated at 95C for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was obtained as a

400

whole-cell lysate. Lysate proteins mixed with an equal volume of sample loading buffer

401

were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Then, the

402

proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 2% skim

403

milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) containing

404

0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated with specific antiserum

405

(diluted 1:1,000 in 1% skim milk in TBS-T) for 1 h at 37C. The membrane was then

406

washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse

407

IgG (diluted 1:1,000 in TBS-T) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 1 h at 37C. The

408

membrane was then washed 5 times with TBS-T, and the protein band reacting with the

409

antiserum was detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer,

410

Waltham, MA, USA).

Hemolytic assays were performed by using TSB-containing 5% sheep blood agar plates

414

(Becton, Dickinson and Company, Japan). Three microliters of overnight culture was

Susceptibility test of LL37 and human defensin 3

419

An antibacterial assay was performed as described elsewhere (28). Briefly, an overnight

420

culture of S. aureus strains was collected and washed with 10 mM sodium phosphate

421

buffer (PB). The bacterial suspension was diluted to 107 cells/ml with PB, and 10 µl of

422

the bacterial suspension (105 cells) was inoculated into 500 µl of PB with or without

423

human antimicrobial peptides (beta-defensin-3; Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan, or

424

LL37; 0.6 μM) and incubated aerobically for 2 h at 37°C. Dilutions of the reaction

425

mixture (100 µl) were plated on agar media and incubated at 37°C overnight. The

426

colony-forming units (CFUs) were determined as the total number of colonies on each

427

plate. The antibacterial effect was calculated as the ratio of the number of surviving

428

cells (survival rate %) to the total number of bacteria incubated in control PB solution

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)

432

For the EMSA, two 6× histidine-tagged recombinant PmtR (rPmtR) proteins from the

433

MW2 original strain and SAN2 were used.For construction rPmtRs were performed as

434

described above. Briefly, a DNA fragment encoding pmtR (MW1875) was amplified

435

with specific primers by using chromosomal DNA of the MW2 and SAN2. Then, DNA

436

fragments were subsequently cloned into pQE30 (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan). The

437

plasmid was then transformed into E. coli M15 (pREP4). The recombinant protein was

438

purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To assess the binding of rPmtR to

439

a region upstream of pmtR, an EMSA was performed as described previously (25). A

440

DNA fragment encompassing the region upstream of pmtR, A-D was amplified with the

441

specific primers listed in Table 1. The DNA fragments were labeled at the 3′ end with

442

digoxigenin (DIG) using a DIG Gel Shift Kit, 2nd Generation (Roche, Mannheim,

443

Germany). The DIG-labeled fragment (5 ng) was reacted with rPmtR protein (50 mM)

444

in the labeling buffer provided with the kit. When necessary, a nonlabeled DNA

445

fragment (10 ng) was added to the reaction mixture. After native PAGE on a 6%

446

polyacrylamide gel, the DNA fragments were transferred to a positively charged nylon

A mouse bacteremia experiment was performed as described previously (29).

452

Six-week-old female Slc:ddY mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Small

453

portions of overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 original strain, SAN2 and SAN2 with

454

MW1875-1871 inactivation (MM2278) were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh TSB and

455

incubated at 37°C with shaking. When the OD660 reached 0.8, bacterial cells were

456

collected and washed with PBS. Then, the cells were resuspended in PBS at a

457

concentration of 1.0 × 109 CFU/ml. An aliquot of 100 μl (1.0 × 108 CFU) was injected

458

into the tail vein of the mice. Mouse survival was monitored for 6 days. This

645

To obtain a mutant that constitutively expresses MW1874-1871 by their own promoter

646

upstream of MW1875 without MW1875 expression, we constructed a plasmid

647

containing the internal region of MW1875 (295 bp) and the promoter region of

648

MW1875-1871 (149 bp). The plasmid was finally transduced into the MW2 strain. The

649

plasmid integration was performed with the method described Materials and Methods

650

section. Two types of the mutants (Case 1and 2) were obtained and the mutant with

651

Case1 was selected for further experiments.
