SUMMARY
Interhemispheric connections enable interaction
and integration of sensory information in bilaterian
nervous systems and are thought to optimize
sensory computations. However, the cellular and
spatial organization of interhemispheric networks
as well as the computational properties they mediate
in vertebrates are still poorly understood. Thus, it
remains unclear to which extent the connectivity
between left and right brain hemispheres
participates in sensory processing. Here, we show
that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive
direct interhemispheric projections from their
contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down
inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog
of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric
projections between the OBs reach peripheral
layers of the contralateral OB and retain a finegrained topographic organization, which directly
connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli
across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric
top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections
that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell
layer. Jointly, these interhemispheric connections
elicit a balance of topographically organized
excitation and non-topographic inhibition on the
contralateral OB and modulate odor responses.
We show that the interhemispheric connections
in the olfactory system enable the modulation
of odor response and improve the detection of a
reproductive pheromone, when presented together
with competing complex olfactory cues, by boosting
the response of the pheromone selective neurons.
Taken together, our data shows a previously
unknown function for an interhemispheric
connection between chemosensory maps of the
olfactory system.
INTRODUCTION
In bilaterians, information detected by parallel
sensory channels is topographically represented
onto sensory regions located in mirrored positions
of the brain hemispheres. Communication between
bilateral sensory regions with similar functions is
mediated by a dense network of fibers projecting
contralaterally between brain hemispheres, which

are organized into commissural tracts [1–4]. These
interhemispheric connections are present in
invertebrates [5,6] and vertebrates [7,8]. Different
theories exist, pertaining to how they contribute
to neural computations, in particular with regards
to their inhibitory or excitatory effect [9,10].
Interhemispheric inhibition has been suggested
to facilitate visual [11,12] and somatosensory
processing [13,14] by increasing the perceptual
threshold in the hemisphere contralateral to the
stimulated hemisphere, and thereby shifting
attention to the relevant input. A functional
diversity of interhemispheric connections is present
in the auditory system, where both inhibitory and
excitatory interhemispheric interactions have been
observed [15,16]. The synchronization between
auditory hemispheres might support figure/ground
segregation, whereas interhemispheric inhibition
amplifies binaural activation delay and could
underlie stereo-hearing [17]. On the other hand,
information sharing between hemispheres through
excitation in the primary visual cortex enables
binocular vision supporting depth perception
[18,19]. It also avoids the dissociation between
lateralized associative centers, by transferring
unilaterally learned information to the opposing
hemisphere. For example, the restricted lesion of
fibers linking the somatosensory cortices blocks
the transfer of texture learning from one paw to
the other in monkeys [20]; and disconnecting the
fibers responsible for the visual interhemispheric
crosstalk prevents the transfer of a learned visual
discrimination task from one hemifield to the other
[21]. Despite extensive studies, the precise cellularlevel mapping of interhemispheric projections
linking bilateral sensory regions, as well as the
functional properties they mediate remains largely
elusive.
In the olfactory system, the activation of receptors
located in spatially segregated bilateral nostrils is
transformed through ipsilateral projections into
topographically
organized,
mirror-symmetric
sensory maps in the OBs [22–24]. However, these
segregated olfactory processing channels were
also shown to exhibit prominent interhemispheric
interactions in several taxa. For example in fruitflies,
sensory neurons project bilaterally to the antennal

lobes [25], and were suggested to improve the signal
quality by pooling multiple input channels from
both antennae [26]. Rodents are able to locate an
odor source using bilateral sampling [27,28], which
depends on intact interhemispheric communication
[27]. A multisynaptic system links the left and
right OBs via the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON)
[29], a circuit which was proposed to support
interhemispheric transfer of olfactory memory [30].
Beyond such connections through higher olfactory
areas of vertebrates, direct projections were shown
to link both OBs in teleost fish [31]. It is however less
clear, how all these interhemispheric connections
between olfactory processing channels across the
vertebrate brain work in parallel, and contribute
to olfactory computations. The function of
interhemispheric olfactory connections is perhaps
best conceptualized when asking what could be the
advantage for vertebrates to maintain redundant
olfactory maps in each hemisphere. Indeed,
unilateral olfactory input is sufficient to detect,
identify and spatially locate odors [32,33]. Yet,
bilateral sensory maps linked by interhemispheric
connections could confer additional properties
akin to visual depth perception [34] and fine
sound source localization [35]. In line with this,
prior evidence suggest that bilateral olfactory
inputs improve the speed and the accuracy of odor
tracking in a variety of animal species [28,32,33,36].
The neural circuits serving the improved chemotaxis
are currently unknown, however mechanisms
have been proposed, including increased signalto-noise ratio [32] or interhemispheric inhibition
[37]. Alternatively, redundant information could
prove essential when a sensory organ is (partially)
obstructed, as can be the case in both rodents
and humans [38,39]. Interhemispheric transfer
of unilaterally experienced odorant information
through AON would then help maintain both
olfactory maps in the cortex up to date, even when
one of the sensory organs is offline [30,39,40].
Despite these studies, the precise neural circuit that
links the two olfactory hemispheres and how this
circuit contributes to olfactory computations is yet
to be further elucidated.

photon calcium imaging in the OB. We found that
interhemispheric connections elicit a balance of
topographically organized odor-specific excitation
and non-topographically organized inhibition
on the contralateral OB. Our results revealed that
strong contralaterally evoked-activity can modulate
odor responses in an intensity dependent manner.
Finally, we demonstrated that the excitatory and
inhibitory interhemispheric interactions jointly
improve the detection of a reproductive pheromone
within a background of olfactory noise elicited by
food odors, by specifically boosting the response
of the pheromone responding OB neurons.
Taken together, our findings show a previously
undescribed function for the interhemispheric
olfactory connections for improving the detection
of sensory stimuli within a noisy background.
RESULTS

The olfactory bulbs are connected through direct
and indirect interhemispheric projections
In vertebrates, olfactory information from one
nostril is sent to the ipsilateral OB. It is subsequently
passed on to higher olfactory areas primarily on the
ipsilateral side [41]. In the current study, we used an ex
vivo explant preparation of the adult zebrafish brain
[22,42,43] to investigate how bilateral olfactory bulbs
are interconnected across the brain hemispheres.
We first investigated whether mitral cells directly
project to the contralateral OB (interbulbar
projections). To do so, OB neurons were labeled by
electroporation of tetramethylrhodamine-dextran.
Two-photon microscopy was then used to image
the labeling sites as well as the axonal projections
to the contralateral OB (Figure 1A-B). Mitral cells
axons exited the ipsilateral OB through the medial
and lateral olfactory tracts and mostly terminated
in the ipsilateral Dp (dorsal part of the dorso-lateral
pallium), which is a zebrafish telencephalic area
homologous to the rodent primary olfactory cortex
[44] (Figure 1A). Interestingly, we also observed
that axons coursing through the medial olfactory
tract crossed to the contralateral hemisphere at the
level of the anterior commissure (Figure 1A). These
axons terminated at the peripheral layers of the

extending from the Dp crossed the anterior
commissure and diffusely innervated the core
layer of the contralateral OB (depth> 50µm, Figure
1E), where the granule inhibitory interneurons are
located. Altogether, our results revealed that the
zebrafish OBs are connected through at least two
major types of interhemispheric connections. A
direct and topographically organized mitral cell
projection terminates on the peripheral layer of the
contralateral OB. An indirect connection through
the zebrafish homolog of the olfactory cortex, Dp,
diffusely terminates on the granule cell layer of the
contralateral OB.
The direct interbulbar projections retain a fine scale
chemotopic organization
In the zebrafish OB, odors with similar chemical
properties are encoded by the activation of spatially
nearby domains forming a chemotopic map [22]
that is conserved across individual animals [49,50].
For example the neurons responding to amino acids,
which are feeding cues, are located in the lateral OB
[51], while neurons responding to bile acids, which
are putative social cues, are located in the medial OB
[22,51]. We thus asked whether projections of mitral
cells at the contralateral OB are topographically
organized. Labeling mitral cells located in the
medial OB revealed projections terminating at the
medial domain of the contralateral OB (Figure 2AB), thus mirroring their cell body location. Similarly,
labeling mitral cells at the lateral OB revealed

Next, we tested whether the direct interbulbar
projections can specifically link mirror-symmetric
glomeruli with similar odor tuning (iso-functional
glomeruli) across hemispheres. To do this, we
labeled mitral cells innervating a genetically
identified glomerulus lVPG (lateral ventro-posterior
glomerulus, Figure 2E), which can be visualized in
similar locations in both OBs (Koide et al., 2009).
Examination of the electroporation site confirmed
that the labeled neurons indeed extended dendrites
connecting to the lVPG glomerulus (Figure 2FG, bottom panels), but spared the adjacent and
medially positioned mVPG (medial ventro-posterior
glomerulus) thus emphasizing the spatial specificity
of the electroporation [52]. We observed that lVPG
mitral cells sent interhemispheric projections that
terminated next to the contralateral lVPG, as well
as in nearby glomeruli (Figure 2F-G, top panels).
We repeated this experiment by labeling the mitral
cells of the mVPG (Figure 2H). We observed that the
axons of mVPG mitral cells projected to the mVPG
at the contralateral olfactory bulb (Figure 2I-J). Our
results showed that direct interbulbar projections
across the brain hemispheres are topographically
organized and glomeruli specific.

Interhemispheric connections between olfactory
bulbs modulate odor responses
The presence of these extensive interhemispheric
connections raised the possibility that olfactory
information in one hemisphere can influence odor
processing in the contralateral OB. To test this
hypothesis, we measured odor-evoked responses
using two-photon calcium imaging in zebrafish
expressing GCaMP6s under the elavl3 promoter,
primarily in mitral cells [42,53], while electrically
stimulating the contralateral olfactory nerve at
different intensities using a glass microelectrode
(Figure 3A). As expected, food odor activated a large
number of ipsilateral mitral cells (Figure 3C-E, left
panels). Low intensity microelectrode stimulation of
the contralateral olfactory nerve led to modulation
of odor response in very few ipsilateral mitral
cells (Figure 3C & F, right panels). However, as we
increased the contralateral stimulation to medium
and strong intensities, more ipsilateral mitral cells
showed increased odor responses (Figure 3D,G,E,H).
Importantly, to verify that contralateral stimulation
did not directly activate ipsilateral neurons through
volume transmission, we repeated the same
experiment after sectioning contralateral mitral
cells’ axons at the level of the olfactory tract (Figure
3B). In that case we did not observe modulation of
mitral cell responses, even when using the strongest
microstimulation intensity (Figure 30-R), indicating
the necessity of intact contralateral olfactory inputs.
We next calculated the contribution of contralateral
inputs to odor responses by measuring the
difference of amplitude between the ipsilateral
odor responses with and without the contralateral
microelectrode stimulation (Figure 3I-K). We found
significant and mainly excitatory modulation of
odor responses by medium and strong contralateral
inputs (Figure 3M-N). Our results showed that
interhemispheric connections across the OBs can
dynamically modulate the odor response in the
contralateral olfactory bulb.
Natural odors elicit odor-specific and chemotopically
organized excitation in the contralateral olfactory
bulb
Having shown that contralateral olfactory nerve
electric stimulation can modulate odor responses,
we further investigated whether odor stimulation
would also elicit activity in the contralateral OB. To
assess this, we sectioned the olfactory nerve of the
contralateral OB and delivered odors to the ipsilateral
side with an intact olfactory nerve. By performing
two-photon calcium imaging, we compared the
odor-evoked mitral cell activity in the ipsilateral
OB (Figure 4A) with the activity in the contralateral
deafferented OB (Figure 4B) in response to amino
acids, bile acids and a reproductive fish pheromone,
prostaglandin 2α (pgf2α). We observed neural
6

responses to all odors, both in the afferented (Figure
4C-D) and in the deafferented OB neurons (Figure
4E-F), which showed that natural odors indeed
elicit excitatory responses in the contralateral
OB. As expected, there were more ipsilateral than
contralateral odor-responsive mitral cells (Figure
4G). Importantly, no odor-induced activity was seen
in bilaterally deafferented OBs (control condition,
Supplementary Figure 1). The results showed that
natural odors can elicit activity not only in the
ipsilateral but also in the contralateral OB.
Our anatomical results showed that direct
interhemispheric projections between the
OBs follow a strict topographical organization
and connect similarly tuned glomeruli across
hemispheres (Figure 2). Moreover, different odor
categories (such as amino-acids, bile acids and
pgf2α) were previously shown to specifically
activate spatially distinct OB domains [22].
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that
interhemispheric connections would communicate
odor category specific information across spatially
distinct domains between two hemispheres. To test
this, we first compared the odor category specificity
of the ipsilaterally and contralaterally-evoked mitral
cell odor responses. Consistently, we observed odor
category selective neurons present both in the
ipsilateral as well as in the contralateral OB (Figure
4D,F & H). To quantify the response selectivity of OB
neurons, we calculated the lifetime sparseness [54] of
individual mitral cell odor responses. A neuron with
high sparseness value responds primarily to one or
a few odors, whereas a neuron with low sparseness
value respond with similar amplitude to several
odors. We found no difference in lifetime sparseness
of mitral cell odor responses in the ipsilateral OB
and deafferented contralateral OB (Figure 4I),
indicating a similar level of odor category selectivity
between ipsi- and contralateral mitral cells. Next, we
compared the spatial distribution of odor responses
in the ipsilateral and deafferented contralateral
OB. Based on visual inspection, odor responses
appeared to be mirror-symmetric and thus located
in functionally homologous spatial domains (Figure
4J-K). To quantify this mirror-symmetry, we mapped
the location of mitral cells selectively responding
to distinct odor categories. Since pgf2α activates
a restricted set of neurons in the caudo-ventral OB
[55], we calculated a caudality index (see methods)
measuring the location of pgf2α-selective neurons
along the antero-posterior axis. We found that
both OBs exhibit similarly high caudality index for
pgf2α (Figure 4L). Amino acids activate specifically
the lateral zebrafish OB. Hence, we calculated a
laterality index to quantify the mirror-symmetry of
amino acids selective neurons, and found that both
OBs exhibit similarly high laterality index (Figure

The topographic odor map within the OB is not
prominent in the rodent piriform cortex [52,59–61]
and in the zebrafish Dp [31,43]: axons from similarly
tuned mitral cells project diffusely to these areas
without strong spatial preference. Our results add
to this by showing that Dp neurons in turn diffusely
innervate the contralateral OB granular cell layer
(Figure 1). Based on these findings, we hypothesized
that the OB interneurons activity pattern recruited

topographically organized. To test this, we first
compared the odor category specificity of the

responses using the lifetime sparseness measure.

bulb interneurons, which partially reflect the
topography of mitral cell odor responses [58]. In
line with these earlier results, we observed stronger
correlations between odor response profiles of
nearby interneurons of the ipsilateral OB (Figure
5H). In contrast, odor responses of interneurons
in the deafferented contralateral OB exhibited
significantly less spatial organization than the
ipsilateral interneurons (Figure 5H, contra). Similarly,
we observed that symmetric and spatially organized

activation of ipsilateral interneurons elicited by
bile acids was not present in the contralateral
deafferented OB (Figure 5I). These results confirmed
our hypothesis and highlight a global and nontopographic recruitment of interneurons through
interhemispheric connections, which is mediated
through diffuse projections received from the
zebrafish homolog of the olfactory cortex, Dp
(Figure 1E).

Interhemispheric connections improve the
detection of a reproductive pheromone within a
background of olfactory noise
Our results showed that interhemispheric excitation,
which originates from the contralateral OB, is
spatially organized and recruits mirror-symmetric
mitral cells in both OBs. Whereas interhemispheric
inhibition, which originates from the innervation
of deeper OB layers by the contralateral Dp, is not
spatially organized and recruit broadly distributed
inhibitory interneurons. Such global inhibition
could facilitate interhemispheric suppression and
mediate odor source localization or serve as a gain
control mechanism. However, strong and glomeruli
specific interhemispheric excitation could enhance
the sensitivity of the OB circuit, especially for
detecting odors that activate few specific glomeruli,
without activating the entire network that would
otherwise recruit strong global interhemispheric
inhibition. Thus, we hypothesized that this balance
between strong contralateral focal excitation and
global inhibition could improve the detection of
odors activating few glomeruli in noisy conditions,
where odor detection is challenging, for example in
the presence of a background odor simultaneously
activating multiple OB glomeruli.
To test this, we compared how mitral cells with
or without active interhemispheric connections
detect pgf2α, an olfactory cue activating two
ventral glomeruli. Pgf2α was either presented
alone or together with varying concentrations of
food odor, forming odor mixtures (Figure 6A-B).
Our functional recordings confirmed that pgf2α
activates a restricted set of selectively tuned mitral
cells, whereas the competing stimulus food odor
activates a large portion of the OB circuits (Figure
6C-F).
We observed that increasing concentrations of
food odor within the binary mixtures gradually
suppressed the responses of mitral cells tuned to
pgf2α (Figure 6C-D, G). Confirming our hypothesis,
we found that this suppression of pgf2α responses
was less prominent in the presence of active
interhemispheric connections. Indeed, pgf2αselective mitral cells that received contralateral
inputs retained 75% of their initial pgf2α response
when pgf2α was presented with low concentration
of food odor, versus only 40% without contralateral
inputs (Figure 6G). This was likely due to the available
interhemispheric excitation that compensated for
the global suppression elicited by the food odor.
Next, we asked whether this improved responses of
the pgf2α-selective mitral cells to the odor mixture
would be sufficient to maintain pgf2α neural
response pattern. Increasing the concentration of
background food odor presented together with
10

pgf2α gradually reduced the correlations between
the pgf2α and mixture neural representations,
shifting the mixture activity pattern away from
pgf2α (Figure 6H) and towards food odor (Figure
6I). Confirming our hypothesis, we found that the
presence of active interhemispheric connections
counteracted the degradation of pgf2α signals
in the presence of background food odors at low
concentrations. Indeed, activity patterns evoked
by the odor mixture were more correlated with the
pgf2α alone (Figure 6H), and less similar to food odor
(Figure 6I) in the presence of active interhemispheric
connections. Altogether, our results showed that
interhemispheric communication across the OBs
can improve the detection of a reproductive
pheromone in the presence of background food
odor by providing robust odor specific excitation
across isofunctional olfactory glomeruli in different
brain hemispheres.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found an extensive
network of interhemispheric connections between
the adult zebrafish OBs with fine topography. We
showed that interbulbar projections are present in
adult zebrafish OB and directly connect similarly
tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. A
link between similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli
has previously been described in fruitfly [26], where
olfactory receptor neurons send projections to
olfactory glomeruli located in both hemispheres.
Interestingly, these bilateral projections support
rapid orientation towards odor source, through
asymmetric neurotransmitter release [26]. In mice,
axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing
the same receptor converge onto two glomeruli
within the same OB, one located medially and the
other laterally [23,62]. Consequently, each bulb in
the mouse contains a mirror-symmetric glomerular
odor map [23,63] that is absent in zebrafish, in
which OSNs expressing the same receptor project
onto a single glomerulus [55,64,65]. Interestingly,
the murine isofunctional glomeruli within a bulb are
specifically connected via an inhibitory intrabulbar
circuit [66]. This circuit potentially amplifies the
interglomerular activation delay in a concentrationdependent manner, leading the authors to propose
that this mammalian circuit linking similarly
tuned glomeruli within one bulb enables odorant
concentration decoding [67]. These previous
findings highlight the interspecies variability of
connections linking similarly tuned glomeruli,
across and within brain hemispheres. Thus it would
be interesting to systematically investigate whether
direct connections link the primary olfactory centers
(antennal lobes or olfactory bulbs) in different
species. Olfactory bulbs neurons are not known

to project onto the contralateral OB in the mouse
[52,68]. Yet, bilaterally projecting local interneurons
(LNs) link both antennal lobes in fruitfly [69], and
mitral cells project to the contralateral OB in teleost
fish [31,46,70]. A comparative overview of the
connectivity between the primary olfactory centers
in species adapted to different environmental
constraints will certainly provide useful insights
into how these interhemispheric olfactory circuits
support species-speciﬁc behaviors.
The exact role played by interhemispheric OB
connections in sensory computation and animal
behavior remains unclear. Section of the anterior
commissure in mice, which prevents a broad
range of interhemispheric interactions including
those between olfactory bulbs, resulted in lack of
interhemispheric transfer of unilaterally formed
olfactory memories [30] or loss of rapid nostril
orientation towards odor source [27]. In the present
study, we found that interhemispheric olfactory
connections elicited a balance of focal excitation
and widespread inhibition on the contralateral OB,
and thus hypothesized that such a mechanism could
improve the detection of focal odors in a background
of competing olfactory cues. Indeed, we found
that interhemispheric connections rescued the
detection of a reproductive pheromone presented
together with low concentrations of food odor.
This indicates that interhemispheric connections
improve the sensitivity of the OB circuit for the
reproductive pheromone in challenging detection
conditions, such a presence of background olfactory
noise, which are likely to be encountered in the
fish’s natural habitat. This new finding is particularly
relevant since social-related olfactory cues tend
to activate a restricted number of glomeruli in the
primary olfactory centers of flies and fish [22,55,71],
and therefore might be more sensitive to lateral
inhibition in presence of competing olfactory cues.
Thus, our findings describe a circuit mechanism
that serves to enhance the detection of such focal
social-related odors when competing background
odors are present. It would be interesting to explore
in further studies whether this effect also exists for
other attractive social-related odors such as bile
acids [51,72,73], which also activate a restricted set
of ventrally located glomeruli.

projects to the contralateral OB granule cells. As
could be expected from the loss of chemotopic
organization in Dp [31,43] combined with the
diffuse nature of their feedback projection to the
contralateral OB, we found no obvious topographic
organization of contralaterally-evoked inhibition.
This is also in line with rodents studies showing
that piriform cortex feedback mediates global
and non-topographically organized inhibition in
the ipsilateral OB [45,75]. It is interesting to note
that rodent’s OBs are also linked via a precisely
topographically organized multisynaptic circuit:
the pars externa of the anterior olfactory nucleus
(AONpe) receives input from ipsilateral mitral cells,
and in turn projects to the contralateral inhibitory
granule cell layer within the isofunctional column
[29,30,40]. The contribution of these connections
to the contralateral mouse OB activity was recently
explored in two studies, one finding evidence
of contralateral mitral cell inhibition [30], while
another described odor-specific mitral cel excitation
and found only weak and randomly distributed
inhibition [40]. Thus, our study combined with
previous work reveal that a similar interbulbar
functional interaction, - i.e. topographically
organized focal excitation, potentially combined
with broadly distributed inhibition -, could be
conserved from fish to rodents and yet mediated by
a different circuit architecture.

The direct shared excitation between olfactory
hemispheres that we described in this study poses
the question of how fish can use inter-nostril
delay to rapidly orient towards odor source, as
described in sharks [36]. Actually, inter-nostril
comparison would work best with segregated and
unconnected neuronal pathways that eventually
converge to a brain region performing the bilateral
comparison. However, the two mechanisms, -i.e.
interhemispheric enhancement of odor detection
and bilateral comparison of segregated odor inputs
-, are not mutually exclusive and could coexist
in the same animal. Indeed, others and we have
shown that only a subset of mitral cells are linked
across hemispheres. In mice, 33% of mitral cells
are functionally connected to the contralateral
OB [40]. In larval zebrafish, 7 to 56% of the mitral
cells project to the contralateral bulb, depending
on the glomerulus considered [31]. Our functional
In addition to the direct interbulbar projections, we results confirm this picture, with around 40% of

we observed top-down feedback from Dp to the integrating inputs from both nostrils, similar to the
ipsilateral OB, but we also found that Dp diffusely role played by the AON in rodents [27,39].

Beyond the olfactory system, the present findings
add to the existing literature describing the
anatomical organization and functional role
of interhemispheric connections in sensory
processing [9,10]. Evidence of interhemispheric
connectivity between early topographic maps in
other sensory modalities than olfaction is scarce:
a direct interhemispheric connection between
retinae, mediated by contralaterally projecting
ganglion cells, was recently identified in vertebrates
[76]. This connection is only present at perinatal
stages and might underlie the synchronization
of bilateral retinal waves during development. As
interbulbar connections are already present at
fish larval stages [31], during which the olfactory
maps is established and refined [77], the zebrafish
interbulbar pathway might serve a similar role in
maintaining the symmetry of bilateral odor maps
during development. Yet, the maintenance of this
extensive and highly spatially organized circuit
throughout adulthood, combined with its role in
increased detection of an (adult) sex-pheromone,
suggest that this circuit is not just a remnant
of embryonic structure, but instead confers a
substantial advantage for adult fish in detecting
sensory cues important for survival.

topographically organized excitation and nontopographic inhibition facilitates the detection of
a focal stimulus presented in a noisy background.
This is reminiscent of interhemispheric sensory
computations arising in a specialized region of
the auditory cortex of echolocating bats, where
focal electrical stimulation of the contralateral
cortex selectively enhance the response of similarly
tuned neurons specialized in echo delay detection
[16]. Thus, we propose that interhemispheric
connections might not only play a role in higher
cognitive functions such as lateralization, attention
and stimulus source localization, but could also
modulate sensory gain at early stages of stimulus
detection, through a balance of focal excitation
and widespread inhibition, and optimize sensory
perception.

Higher cortical sensory areas in vertebrates are
linked through interhemispheric fibers, mostly
mediating contralateral hemisphere inhibition
[78,79]. In this study, we found a dual component
inhibitory and excitatory interhemispheric
circuit linking homologous sensory maps. More
specifically, we found that focal excitatory
projections directly activate similarly tuned neurons
in the contralateral hemisphere, and indirectly
recruit widespread lateral inhibition, eliciting a
balance of topographically organized excitation
and non-topographic inhibition on the contralateral
hemisphere. Taken together with previous studies,
our findings indicate that the balance between
contralateral excitation and inhibition might vary
according to the brain regions connected. A similar
variability in contralateral excitation-inhibition
balance was also observed between different layers
in the mouse somatosensory cortex [80].

Supplementary Figure 1. Odor-induced activity on the contralateral OB.
(A). Ipsilateral recordings: the olfactory nerve was sectioned on the side contralateral to the imaged OB. (B). Contralateral
recordings: same than in A, but responses from mitral cells in the deafferented OB contralateral to odor simulation were recorded.
(C). Control recordings: same as in A and B, but with olfactory nerve sectioned bilaterally (control condition). (D, E & F). Cumulative
probability distribution of mitral cells response to amino acids, bile acids and pgf2α, respectively (760 ipsilateral cells in 6 animals
; 715 contralateral cells in 6 animals ; 349 control mitral cells in 4 animals; ***p<0.001, *p<0.05, n.s., non-significant; two-sample
two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). OB: olfactory bulb; pgf2a: prostaglandin 2α.

METHODS
Experimental animal model.
Experiments were conducted in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) of both sexes, aged 8-14 months. The
following transgenic lines were used: Tg(SAGFF179A:Gal4:UAS:GFP) [51]; Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) [53] and
nacre/mitfa. Animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions (28.5°C; 14/10 hour light/dark cycle).
All procedures involving animals were approved and followed the animal care guidelines issued by the
government of Belgium and the Norwegian Food Safety Authorities (FOTS 19910).
Preparations of brain explants.
Nose-attached brain explant. The experiments were conducted in an ex vivo nose-attached brain explant
preparation [22,42,43]. Adult zebrafish were euthanized by immersion in ice-cold water, then decapitated to
ensure death. The head was transferred in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) bubbled with carbogen
(95% O2/5% CO2). The ACSF was composed of the following chemicals diluted in reverse-osmosis purified
water: 131 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 10 mM glucose, 2.5 mM CaCl2
and 20 mM NaHCO3. The eyes, jaws and ventral part of the skull were carefully removed using forceps,
exposing the ventral OBs and telencephalon, and leaving the nose attached. The brain explant was then
affixed using tungsten pins to a small petri dish coated with Sylgard (World Precision Instruments) and
left to equilibrate at room temperature for >30 min, under constant ACSF perfusion. Depending on the
experiment, the olfactory nerve was unilaterally, or bilaterally, sectioned between the olfactory epithelium
and the rostral end of the OB, using a sharpened insect pin. Complete deafferentation was verified under
a binocular microscope.
Bolus injection of calcium indicator. To record activity in interneurons, a synthetic calcium indicator was
injected in the OB [42]. Rhod-2-AM (50 µg, Invitrogen, CAT # R1245MP) was suspended in 16 µL of dimethyl
sulfoxide-pluronic (Invitrogen, CAT: P3000MP) and kept at 4°C. Aliquots of the stock solution were diluted
(1/10) in ACSF the day of the experiment and gently pressure-injected using a pulled glass micropipette.
Experiments started >30 min after the last injection to allow for dye uptake in neurons and clearance from
intercellular space.
Olfactory stimuli.
We used electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve, and bath application of odorants to the intact nose,
to elicit reproducible olfactory responses. For experiments with unilateral stimulation with odorants and
microstimulation on the contralateral side, a small custom-made polystyrene separator was inserted in
front and below the nose to prevent the odorant to reach the contralateral nostril (Figure 3).
Olfactory nerve microstimulation. Microstimulation was performed using pulled glass micropipettes
(~10µm tip diameter) filled with ACSF and containing a silver wire connected to a computer-controlled

stimulus isolator (Isoflex amplifier, AMPI). The tip of the micropipette was inserted in the olfactory nerve
and a train of short current pulses were applied during 3 seconds (pulse duration: 50 ms; 5-10-20 μA for
low, medium and high intensity simulation, respectively).
Odorants. All odorants were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Odor stocks were prepared in reverse
osmosis purified water and kept as aliquots at -20°C. Aliquots of stock solutions were diluted to their final
concentration in ACSF on the day of the experiment. Amino acids mix contained arginine, asparagine,
aspartic acid, alanine, phenylalanine, histidine and methionine, each diluted at 10-4 mol/L. Bile acid mix
contained taurodeoxycholic and taurocholic acids, each diluted at 10-4 mol/L. Prostaglandin 2 was
used at the final concentration of 5 10-7 mol/L, alone or within binary mixture with food odor. Food odor
stock was prepared using commercially available fish food (SDS100, Scientific Fish Food): 1 g of food was
incubated in 100 mL of ACSF and filtered. Food odor stock was diluted 1/50 in ACSF for all experiments,
except for the one displayed in Figure 6, where low (dilution 1/400), medium (dilution 1/100) and high
(dilution 4/100) concentrations were used. A computer-controlled low pressure injection valve (Valco
Instruments, C22Z-3186EUH) introduced the odorants in the perfusion stream (3 mL/min) delivered
through a tubing positioned 1 mm in front of the nostrils. The tubing was made of non-adherent teflon
(Teknolab, 0.8mm internal diameter) and was rinsed with reverse osmosis purified water after each
trial to avoid contamination between successive stimuli. Multiple odorants were delivered in a pseudorandomized order and separated by at least 2 min in order to avoid neural habituation.
Axonal projection tracing using dextran-coupled dyes.
For axonal projection tracing, neurons were loaded with an fluorescent tracer using local electroporation
as described in [52]. The dura covering the brain explant was carefully removed at the labeling sites using
flattened-tip forceps to facilitate the dye electroporation. A solution of tetramethylrhodamine-dextran
(TMR-dextran, 3000 kDa, Invitrogen, CAT: D3306) diluted at 12 mg/mL in phosphate buffer saline (VWR,
CAT: 97062-730) was aliquoted and stored at -20°C to be thawed just before the experiment. Pulled-glass
micropipettes were backfilled with 2 µL of dye and the remaining space was filled with ACSF. A silver wire
was inserted in the micropipette and connected to a stimulus isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P.I.). The micropipette
tip was directed to the center of the area of interest under a two-photon microscope and trains of current
pulses (500 pulses of 30-40 µA, 25 ms duration, 2Hz) were delivered. The brain explant was bathed at
room temperature in a flow of ACSF bubbled with carbogen for at least 6h to allow the dye migration
along the neurites. We used a two-photon imaging system (LSM 7 MP upright with 20× water immersion
objective, Zeiss) to take anatomical scans of the brain, since it enabled access to deep structures and
reduced fluorophore bleaching. A mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai Spectra-Physics) tuned to 840 nm
was used for combined excitation of GFP and TMR. Labeled contralateral neurites were then reconstructed
by an experimenter blind to the location of the ipsilateral electroporation sites based on the TMR labeling
(red channel) in Neuron Studio [82] or using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin [83] in ImageJ. Neurites
reconstructed were then superimposed on the stack acquired in the GFP channel that provided the OB
outline.
Two-photon calcium imaging.
Neural activity measurements were collected with two-photon laser scanning systems. For the experiment
described in Figure3, data were collected for 1-3 planes per fish, using successive recordings of a single
plane at 3.4Hz (LSM7MP upright with 20× water immersion objective, Zeiss). For the remaining experiments,
volumetric images were recorded at 3.3Hz (upright with 16× water immersion objective, Scientifica) for 6
planes simultaneously, which were evenly spanning the ventral side of the OB within a range of 10 to 110
µm deep. In both cases, a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 920 nm (for GCaMP6s recordings) or 840
nm (for Rhod2AM recordings) was used to excite the fluorophores.
Calcium imaging analysis.
Recordings were corrected for movement in Matlab using a modified version of the algorithm used in
[84,85]. Recordings were then visually inspected and discarded whenever tissue drift was observed.
Individual neurons were manually segmented and the corresponding raw fluorescent traces were
calculated by averaging the value of all pixels belonging to a given neuron for each time point. The change
in fluorescence (% df/f ) relative to pre-stimulus baseline was calculated as follow:

, where F0 is the averaged 6 seconds of pre-stimulus fluorescence for each neuron and Ft the fluorescence
of a neuron at time t. The stimulus response of each neuron was calculated by averaging the %df/f during
the 10 seconds post-stimulus onset (for odor responses) or 3 seconds post-microstimulation onset (for
contralateral olfactory nerve microstimulations). Images of stimulus responses within an entire recording
plane were obtained by applying the same procedure to every pixel (instead of neuron) and smoothening
the resulting image using a Gaussian filter. To calculate the selectivity of odor response of the entire
neuronal population, lifetime sparseness was calculated as follow [86,87]:

, where ri is the response of an individual neuron to the ith odor and n is the total number of odors. Cells with
negative responses to all odors were not included in the calculation (remaining mitral cells: 628 ipsilateral
cells in 6 fish; 606 contralateral cells in 6 fish; remaining interneurons: 1196 ipsilateral interneurons in 5
fish; 1466 contralateral interneurons in 4 fish). Low values indicate low selectivity whereas values close to 1
indicate that the neuron respond to only a small fraction of the odor set tested. The thresholds for detecting
a response were set to 70% df/f for mitral cells and 10% df/f for interneurons. To quantify chemotopy,
the spatial location of neurons responding to a single stimulus (odor-selective neurons) was allocated
to anterior versus posterior OB halves or to medial versus lateral OB halves. Lateral, caudal or mediality
indices were then calculated in each animal as the ratio of neurons located in the lateral, posterior or
medial OB halves, respectively.
Statistical analysis.
Data was examined for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. The significance threshold was set to p value
< 0.05. Data were then analyzed using parametric (Student’s t-test) or non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon
signed-rank). Two-sample two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used for population distribution.
Data is represented as mean +/- standard error of the mean unless stated otherwise.
