Abstract

27

During cold acclimation fruit flies switch their feeding from yeast to plant food, however there

28

are no robust markers to monitor it in the wild. Drosophila melanogaster is a sterol auxotroph

29

and relies on dietary sterols to produce lipid membranes, lipoproteins and molting hormones.

30

We employed shotgun lipidomics to quantify eight major food sterols in total extracts of heads,

31

female and male genital tracts of adult flies. We found that their sterol composition is dynamic

32

and reflective of flies diet in an organ-specific manner. Season-dependent changes observed in

33

the organs of wild-living flies suggested that the molar ratio between yeast (ergosterol,

34

zymosterol) and plant (sitosterol, stigmasterol) sterols is a quantifiable, generic and

35

unequivocal marker of their feeding behavior, including cold acclimation. It provides

36

technically simpler and more contrast readout compared to the full lipidome analysis and is

37

suitable for ecological and environmental population-based studies.

Introduction

42
43

Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) is an established model to study dietary and environmental

44

impact on lipid homeostasis and development [1]. Although in the wild Dm is believed to feed

45

on yeasts grown on rotten fruits and plants, it can also develop on a variety of foods, including

46

an artificially delipidated diet supplemented with sterols [2]. Dm lacks Δ-6 and Δ-5 desaturases

47

[3] and can only produce short- to medium-chain fatty acids comprising not more than one

48

double bond [4]. However, Dm also makes use of dietary lipids with polyunsaturated fatty acid

49

moieties (e.g. unsaturated triacylglycerols from plant oil) and incorporate them into its own

50

lipids [5,6]. Manipulating the composition of laboratory diets helps to produce larvae and adult

51

flies with a varying degree of unsaturation of their glycero- and glycerophospholipids and study

52

their impact on metabolism and physiology. However, changes in lipids unsaturation span

53

many lipid classes in a tissue-dependent manner and therefore a snapshot of the full-lipidome

54

profile could hardly serve as a robust marker of shifting dietary preference.

55

Like other arthropods, Drosophila is a sterol auxotroph: it exclusively relies on dietary

56

sterols to build biological membranes, lipoproteins, and to produce molting hormones [7]. Each

57

common dietary component supplies flies with unique sterols: a commonly used yeast food

58

(YF) is enriched in ergosterol (Erg); plant food (PF) contains phytosterols e.g. sitosterol (Sit),

59

campesterol (Cam) or stigmasterol (Sti), while animal components supply cholesterol (Cho)

60

(Figure 1). We hypothesized that, in comparison to the full lipidome composition, sterol

61

composition could be a more specific dietary marker supporting ecological and nutritional

62

studies also in wild-living animals.

63

Our recent study showed that switching from yeast to plant diet increased flies survival

64

at low temperatures by preserving the fluidity of their biological membranes [6]. Depending

65

on their chemical structure, sterols are differently contributing to membranes organization and

66

fluidity [8–10]. However, these findings mostly rely on either artificial membrane vesicles or

67

molecular dynamics calculations. It is unclear if lipidomic changes observed in the laboratory

68

using compositionally defined foods and genetically homogeneous population of flies also play

69

a role in the wild. It remains uncertain if the sterol composition is dynamic and reflects changes

70

in adult flies diet that occurred within a relatively short time span. How fast are sterols

71

exchanged and if the exchange rates is organ-specific? What sterols are preferentially

72

incorporated by wild-living flies feeding on diverse nutrients? And, last but not least, if sterol

73

composition follows cold acclimation in the wild?

74

To answer these and other important question we developed a simple and robust

75

shotgun lipidomics method for the absolute (molar) quantification of 8 major dietary sterols in

76

individual fly organs and monitored the dynamics of sterol exchange in adult flies reared on

77

laboratory foods and collected in the wild.

Results and Discussion

81

Sterols quantification by shotgun lipidomics

82
83

We previously quantified the full lipidome (including 8 major sterols) of 5 fly organs by

84

shotgun profiling [5]. To this end, total lipid extracts were split into two aliquots. One aliquot

85

was used for quantifying glycero-, glycerophospho- and sphingolipids. Another aliquot was

86

subjected to one-step sulfation by the sulfur trioxide - pyridine complex [5,11] followed by

87

shotgun quantification of derivatized sterols. Sulfation increased the sensitivity and equalized

88

the mass spectrometer response towards structurally different sterols. In this way, the full sterol

89

complement could be quantified using a single internal standard (typically deuterated Cho)

90

after minor adjustment of peaks abundance by individual response factors. However, despite

91

extensive clean-up of reaction mixtures, sterols sulfation severely affected spraying stability

92

and the method suffered from poor batch-to-batch reproducibility [12]. Also, in meantime,

93

isotopically labeled standards of many relevant sterols have become available hence rendering

94

the instrument response harmonization unnecessary. Therefore, instead of sulfation, we treated

95

sterols with acetyl chloride according to Liebisch et al. [13], detected acetylsterols as

96

[M+NH4]+ or [M+H]+ molecular ions, subjected them to HCD FT MS/MS and quantified using

97

fragment ions produced by neutral loss of the acetyl group (Figure 1).

98

Altogether, we aimed at quantifying 8 sterols that are common to flies reared on yeast

99

and plant laboratory foods (Figure 1) [5]. Out of those, isotopically labeled standards were

100

available for 6 sterols, however not for the major fungi sterol Erg and the common phytosterol

101

brassicasterol (Bra).

102

To quantify ergosterol, we cultivated prototrophic yeast strain W303 Y3358 on 13C613

103

glucose and produced fully

104

solution of 99% isotopically labeled 13C-ergosterol and then determined its molar concentration

105

using a calibration plot made with unlabeled Erg standard (see Supplementary figure 1).

C-labeled ergosterol [14]. In this way, we obtained a stock

106

Since Bra and Sti only differ by one methyl group and also share the location of both

107

double bonds we tested if D6-stigmasterol could also be used for quantifying Bra. Calibration

108

plots of Bra and Erg covered a linear dynamic range of three orders of magnitude (0.16 to 100

109

µM) and were not affected by a surrogate lipid matrix (total lipid extract of bovine liver)

110

(Supplementary Figure 1).

111

To quantify fly sterols we used 2/3 of a lipid material extracted from 5 heads or 5 genital

112

tracts. The remaining extract was used for shotgun quantification of glycero- and

113

glycerophospholipids and ceramides using the same mass spectrometry platform and software

114

[15–18].

119

Sterols in adult flies organs are exchangeable with dietary sterols

120
121

Flies incorporate sterols while growing [5], yet are they able to exchange sterols in adulthood

122

in a fully-formed body? We monitored the sterol exchange in adult flies (5-7 days after

123

eclosion) by swapping their diets from YF to PF and, in a separate series of experiments, from

124

PF to YF (Figure 2).

125

Flies reared on normal food (NF) containing both yeast and plant components were

126

allowed to lay eggs on an apple juice agar plate overnight. Eggs were collected, bleached and

127

developed to 1st instar larvae on a fresh plate within one day. Larvae were collected and reared

128

on either YF or PF till adulthood. Five to seven days after eclosion, flies were transferred to

129

another food (PF or YF, respectively) and kept until the indicated time point (days 0, 7 and 14)

130

(Figure 2). Heads (H), male and female genital tracts (mGT and fGT, respectively) were

131

dissected and sterols quantified by shotgun mass spectrometry. We chose to analyze H and m/f

132

GT to contrast the organ-dependent sterol exchange rates within the same adult animal. We

133

reasoned that continuous sperm or eggs production in GT would require higher intake of dietary

134

sterols compared to metabolically and morphologically conserved tissues of the fly head. At

135

the same time, the accurate dissection of specific organs (rather than analyzing whole flies)

136

alleviated massive compositional biases due to food lipids accumulated in the gut or fat body.

137

At the start (day 0) the sterol composition of H, fGT and mGT resembled the

138

composition of nutrient sterols: Erg and Sit were major sterols in both foods and flies (Figure

139

3). However, relatively low abundant Erg biosynthesis precursor Zym (in flies reared on YF;

140

for clarity further termed as YF-flies) and Cam (in PF-flies) were particularly enriched in the

141

GTs, while at the same time PF-flies markedly rejected Sti (Figure 3). Most likely, Sit (in YF-

142

flies) and Erg (in PF-flies) were detectable at the very low levels because of their carry-over

143

from the NF that contained both yeast and plant material.

144

Hence, the composition of fly tissues directly followed the composition of dietary

145

sterols, yet flies showed marked preferences towards several minor sterols. However, the

146

relationship between the sterol abundance in food and in tissues is not direct. H and mGT of

147

both YF- and PF- flies contained similar amount of sterols (in pmol per organ), despite YF

148

contained 3 times more total sterols than PF (data not shown).

149

On the starting day prior the food swap, fGT of YF-flies contained ca 4-fold more

150

sterols compared to PF-flies (Figure 4A) and 7-fold more membrane lipids (GPL and PE-Cer).

151

This corroborated with ca.7-fold higher content of eggs in fGT of YF-flies that were not

152

removed during dissection. In YF-flies both the number of eggs per ovary and the ovary area

153

were higher than in PF-flies (Supplementary figure 2) leading to elevated fertility [6].

154

Within two weeks after swapping the diets (YF to PF and PF to YF), the total sterol

155

content reached the same level as was observed in the flies reared on the substituting food.

156

However, the sterol composition was very different. After two weeks on PF (after swapping

157

YF to PF) only ca 35 mol% of Erg was replaced by phytosterol(s). At the same time, in the

158

reversed direction (swapping PF to YF) Erg content increased from zero up to 60 mol% along

159

with markedly strong depletion of both Sit and Cam.

160

A similar trend was observed in mGT: ca 30 mol% of Erg was replaced by phytosterols

161

when changing YF to PF. However, in contrast to fGT, Erg did not replace Sit and Cam in the

162

reversed (PF to YF) experiment.

163

This prompted a few interim conclusions regarding the completeness and rate of sterol

164

exchange. Firstly, sterols are exchanged in adult flies in a tissue and sex-dependent manner at

165

the days to weeks pace. Secondly, head sterols weakly responded to altered diets and likely

166

reflected the composition of foods during animal growth. Thirdly, fGT sterols strongly

167

responded to the yeast food and rapidly inreased the content of Erg. In fGT and mGT sterols

168

profiles responded to the plant componet with approximately the same magnitude, but mGT

169

was non-responsive to YF.

170
171

Seasonal temperature affects the sterol composition of wild-living flies

172
173

In Dm cold acclimation is improved by consuming plant foods enriched with TG comprising

174

unsaturated fatty acids [6]. Since sterol composition of tissues of adult flies is food-specific

175

(Figure 3) and also dynamic (Figure 4), we reasoned that it could also reflect temperature-

176

dependent dietary preferences of wild-living flies.

177

Wild-living adult Dm animals were collected in Meißen and Pirna areas (Saxony,

178

Germany) at three different times of the year (beginning and end of August 2017 and February

179

2019) and their lipidomes, including sterols, were quantified by shotgun lipidomics. The sterol

180

compositon of H, fGT and mGT was correlated with the mean temperature within the time

181

period of two weeks prior collection (Figure 5A). Two mean temperatures (21.6°C and 18.3°C)

182

were relatively close and we thought that corresponding fly lipidomes should reflect local

183

variations of the wild diets, while the third (winter) collection was made at significantly lower

184

temperature of 7.9°C.

185

Sterol compositions of the three fly organs indicated that, independent of temperatures,

186

flies were feeding on mixed diets containing comparable fractions of plant and yeast

187

components. Interestingly, they also contained a sizable fraction of cholesterol suggesting that

188

flies made occasional use of foods of mammalian origin [19]. Expectantly, the sterol

189

compositon of beginning and end of August collections was similar. However, the winter flies

190

contained approximately 50% less Erg and 50% more of Sit, compared to the summer flies,

191

suggesting the seasonal dietary shift from yeast to plant related foods occurs in the wild (Figure

192

5B-D).

193

Interstingly, that profiles of major glycerophospholipids (PE, PC) in H and mGT of

194

wild living animals only slightly changed with temperature. At the same time, fGT showed a

195

clear trend toward increasing the unsaturation at lower temperature. The fly lipidome contained

196

a substantial fraction of PC/PE species with unsaturated fatty acid moities already at the normal

197

(21.6°C and 18.3°C) temperature. This is not suprising since other common wild living fungi

198

e.g. Yarrowia lipolytica or Pichia pastoris could supply both ergosterol and polyunsaturated

199

fatty acids [20–23].

200

Therefore, adjusting the sterol composition via dietary shift is another critical factor

201

required for cold acclimation. It is clearly detectable also in organs whose

202

glycerophospholipids are not strongly responding to temperature.

203
204

Conclusions and perspectives

205

Among common model organisms, Dm is uniquely capable of building fully functional

206

biological membranes using many dietary sterols of diverse origin and chemical structure,

207

including mammalian sterol cholesterol, yeast ergosterol or plant sitosterol and stigmasterol,

208

among several others. However, the biological significance and molecular basis of this

209

structural versatility is poorly understood. We demonstrated that in mature organs of adult flies

210

sterols were still exchangeable with food sterols. Furthermore, adjusting the sterols

211

composition by altering the diet is an important part of the cold acclimation machinery that, at

212

least in a few organs, functions independently of regulating membranes fluidity by changing

213

the unsaturation of glycerophospholipids. Chol and Cam are having similar membrane ordering

214

capacity, whereas Sit is less ordering and Sti is the least ordering from common fly sterols [8].

215

Hence the increase of sitosterol with concomitant depletion of (mostly) ergosterol could inrease

216

the membrane fluidity and also contribute to cold acclimation even if unsaturated plant lipids

217

(practically, oil-rich seeds) are not available.

218

In the future, it would be interesting to elucidate the consequences of sterols exchange

219

in a broader omics context. In particular, an important question is if sterols could differently

220

regulate membrane proteins/protein complexes. Together with maintaining membrane fluidity,

221

this could be another molecular reason for remarkable tolerance of flies to the structural

222

diversity of dietary sterols.

281

5 Dm heads (fixed ratio of 2 male heads and 3 female heads) or 5 genital tracts of corresponding

282

sex were homogenized with 1 mm zirconia beads in a cooled tissuelyzer for 2 x 5 min at 30 Hz

283

in 200 µl IPA. The homogenate was evaporated in a vacuum desiccator to complete dryness.

284

For YF and PF, 200 – 300 mg wet weight were homogenized in 600 µl IPA with 1 mm zirconia

285

beads in a cooled tissuelyzer for 20 min at 30 Hz. An aliquot corresponding to 4 mg food wet

286

weight was used for lipid extraction. All samples were extracted according to [24]. In brief,

287

700 µl internal standard mix in 10:3 MTBE/MeOH was added to each sample and vortexed for

288

1 h at 4°C. After the addition of 140 µl H2O, samples were vortexed for another 15 min. Phase

289

separation was induced by centrifugation at 13200 rpm for 15 min. The organic phase was

290

transferred to a glass vial and evaporated. Samples were reconstituted in 300 µl 1:2

291

MeOH/CHCl3. 100 µl were transferred to a new vial and used for lipidome analysis. To

292

quantify sterols 200 µl of lipid extract were evaporated and acetylated with 300 µl 2:1

293

CHCl3/acetyl chloride for 1 h at room temperature (modified from Liebisch et al., 2006). After

294

evaporation sterol samples were reconstituted in 200 µl 4:2:1 IPA/MeOH/CHCl3 + 7.5 mM

295

ammonium formate (spray solution). For sterol measurements, samples were 1:5 diluted with

296

spray solution. For lipidome measurements, samples were 1:10 diluted with spray solution.

of 4.1 µm. The ion source was controlled by the Chipsoſt 8.3.1 soſtware (Advion BioSciences).

301

Ionization voltage was + 0.96 kV in positive and − 0.96 kV in negative mode; backpressure

302

was set at 1.25 psi in both modes. Samples were analyzed by polarity switching [25]. The

303

temperature of the ion transfer capillary was 200 °C; S-lens RF level was set to 50%. All

304

samples were analyzed for 10 min. FT MS spectra were acquired within the range of m/z 400–

305

1000 from 0 min to 0.2 min in positive and within the range of m/z 350–1000 from 5.2 min to

306

5.4 min in negative mode at the mass resolution of R m/z 200 = 140000; automated gain control

307

(AGC) of 3×106 and with the maximal injection time of 3000 ms. t-SIM in positive (0.2 to 5

308

min) and negative (5.4 to 10 min) mode was acquired with R m/z 200 = 140000; automated

309

gain control of 5 × 104; maximum injection time of 650 ms; isolation window of 20 Th and

310

scan range of m/z 400 to 1000 in positive and m/z 350 to 1000 in negative mode, respectively.

311

The inclusion list of masses targeted in t-SIM analyses started at m/z 355 in negative and m/z

312

405 in positive ion mode and other masses were computed by adding 10 Th increment (i.e. m/z

313

355, 365, 375, …) up to m/z 1005. Acetylated sterols were quantified by parallel reaction

314

monitoring (PRM) FT MS/MS in an additional measurement. FT MS spectra within the range

315

of m/z 350-1000 were acquired from 0 min to 0.2 min and t-SIM ranging from m/z 350 to 500

316

were acquired from 0.2 min to 4 min with the same settings as described above. PRM spectra

317

were acquired from 4 min to 10 min. For PRM micro scans were set to 1, isolation window to

318

0.8 Da, normalized collision energy to 12.5%, AGC to 5 × 104 and maximum injection time to

319

3000 ms. All spectra were pre-processed using repetition rate filtering software PeakStrainer

320

[26] and stitched together by an in-house developed script [17]. Lipids were identified by

321

LipidXplorer soſtware [27]. Molecular Fragmentation Query Language (MFQL) queries were

322

compiled for acetylated sterols, PA, LPA PC, PC O-, LPC, LPC O-, PE, PE O-, LPE, PI, LPI,

323

PS, LPS, PG, LPG, CL, CerPE, Cer, TG, DG lipid classes. The identification relied on

324

accurately determined intact lipid masses (mass accuracy better than 5 ppm). Lipids were

326

abundances of internal standards of the same lipid class. For acetylated sterols, the specific

327

334

loss of life she has never got a chance to see the results she envisioned.

335

We also acknowledge the Simon Alberti laboratory for supplying the prototrophic yeast strain

336

W303 Y3358 and Aliona Bogdanova from the Protein Expression Facility at MPI Dresden for

337

her help with yeast cultivation. We thank the members of Shevchenko lab for their help and

338
