Running title: C1C2 kinetics and interactions near gate

ABSTRACT
Channelrhodopsins (ChR) are cation channels that can be expressed heterologously in
various living tissues, including cardiac and neuronal cells. To tune spatial and temporal
control of potentials across ChR-enriched cell membranes, it is essential to understand
how pore hydration impacts the ChR photocycle kinetics. Here, we measure channel
opening and closing rates of channelrhodopsin chimera and selected variants (C1C2 wild
type, C1C2-N297D, C1C2-N297V, and C1C2-V125L) and correlate them with changes
in chemical interactions among functionally important residues in both closed and open
states. Kinetic results substantiate that replacement of helices I and II in ChR2 with
corresponding residues from ChR1, to make the chimera C1C2, affects the kinetics of
channelrhodopsin pore gating significantly, making C1C2 a unique channel. As a
prerequisite for studies of ion transport, detailed understanding of the water pathway
within a ChR channel is important. Our atomistic simulations confirm that opening of the
channel and initial hydration of the previously dry gating regions between helices I, II,
III, and VII of the channel occurs with 1) the presence of 13-cis retinal; 2) deprotonation
of a glutamic acid gating residue, E129; and 3) subsequent weakening of the central gate
hydrogen bond between the same glutamic acid E129 and asparagine N282 in the central
region of the pore. Also, an aspartate (D292) is the unambiguous primary proton acceptor
for the retinal Schiff base in the hydrated channel.

SIGNIFICANCE
Channelrhodopsins (ChR) are light-sensitive ion channels used in optogenetics, a
technique that applies light to selectively and non-invasively control cells (e.g., neurons)
that have been modified genetically to express those channels. Using electrophysiology,
we measured the opening and closing rates of a ChR chimera, and several variants, and
correlated those rates with changes in chemical interactions determined from atomistic
simulations. Significant new insights include correlation of single-point-mutations with
four factors associated with pore hydration and cation conductance. Additionally, our
work unambiguously identifies the primary proton acceptor for the retinal chromophore
in the channel open state. These new insights add to mechanistic understanding of lightgated membrane transport and should facilitate future efforts to control membrane
potentials spatially and temporally in optogenetics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) mediate the first committed step in phototactic behavior, the
mechanism by which unicellular algae migrate toward optimal growth conditions to
transform light energy into complex substances such as amino acids and carbohydrates.
ChRs aggregate in an eyespot region of the plasma membrane of algae, such as C.
reinhardtii, and conduct monovalent and divalent cations down their electrochemical
gradients upon light activation. While phototaxis has been investigated for over one
hundred years, molecular identification of channelrhodopsins has occurred only recently.
That molecular data strengthened the proteins' prominence in the field of optogenetics, a
biological technique that uses light to control cells in living tissues.1,2
Experiments have shown that channelrhodopsins can be expressed heterologously in
various cell types, including cardiac and neuronal cells, thus enabling spatial control of
cardiac muscle contraction and action potentials. 3,4 Temporal regulation of the ChRenriched excitable cell membranes depends on opening and closing rates of ChRs.
Channelrhodopsin photocycle kinetics have been described previously by a four-state
kinetic model with two closed and two open states (Fig. 1).5 Upon extended time in the
dark state, channelrhodopsin accumulates in the closed state, C1. Application of light to
ChRs causes all-trans to 13-cis retinal isomerization and yields a high-conducting open
state, O1. Upon extended light activation, equilibrium is reached between O1 and a lower
conducting state, O2. Once light is turned off, the ion channel closes and transitions to the
C2 state, and eventually converts back to the initial C1 ground state.

helices of channelrhodopsin-1 and the last two transmembrane helices of
channelrhodopsin-2. Sharing a similar overall topology, both C1C2 and ChR2 comprise
a putative pore among helices I-III and VII. In addition, mutagenesis and functional
studies have demonstrated that both proteins accommodate numerous glutamic acid
residues on helix II, which contribute to the ion selectivity, but have little influence on
ChR2 photocycle kinetics.6 Prior to resolving a crystal structure of ChR2, 7 C1C2
chimera was used to model ChR2. The similarities between ChR2 and C1C2 secondary
structures made the choice of the structural template plausible. However, the presence of
helices I and II of channelrhodopsin-1 in the chimera resulted in non-negligible
differentiation between C1C2 and ChR2.
Subtle structural differences introduced by single point mutations in helices I, II, III, and
VII alter the kinetics of the ChR photocycle. For instance, ChR2-E123T (ChETA)
exhibits faster channel closing (4 ms vs. 10 ms in wild type, ChR2-WT) concurrent with
a moderate decrease in photocurrent magnitude, and strong desensitization. 8 The C128X
(X=T, A, or S) mutation in ChR2 transforms the protein into step-function opsin at a cost
of significant extension of the open-state lifetime (τoff up to 30 minutes). 9,10 ChR2T159C 11 and ChR2-L132C 12 display slower channel off-kinetics, with associated
increase in photocurrent magnitudes. While ChR2-H134R exhibits enhanced currents
during prolonged stimulation, it also displays a 2-fold slower channel closing rate,
resulting in decreased temporal precision of the variant when compared with ChR2-WT.
3,13

Despite the experimentally observed effect of mutations on pore kinetics, little is known
about the mutation-induced changes in chemical interactions among key gating residues.
To understand better the correlations between intramolecular interactions and functional
differences among ChR variants, we conducted computational and electrophysiology
studies of wild type C1C2 (C1C2-WT), and mutants C1C2-N297D, C1C2-N297V, and
C1C2-V125L (Fig. 2) in their closed and open states. Single point amino acid
replacement sites have been chosen at, and in the vicinity of, the C1C2 central gate. The
central gate is defined by the hydrogen bond between E129(90)...N297(258).14,15
(Numbers in parentheses correspond to the ChR2 amino acid numbering scheme, a shift
by 39 units.) In closed-state C1C2, this gating interaction holds helices II and VII
together in the central region of the pore, thus preventing continuous channel hydration
and subsequent ion permeation. The choice of mutations was driven by the following
questions. What is the influence of side chain acidity on gating interactions in C1C2N297D compared with C1C2-WT? How is gating achieved in the absence of the
E129(90)...N297(258) hydrogen bond (C1C2-N297V)? Knowing that V86 contributes to
ChR2 recovery to the ground state,16 how does a conservative replacement of the
analogous residue, which is spatially proximal to the central gate, affect chemical
interactions in C1C2-V125L?

A plasmid containing the gene for C1C2 was obtained from Addgene 17(Addgene
plasmid # 35519). The cDNA of the C1C2 chimera (residues 1-356) and C-terminal
eYFP was subcloned into the vector pTLN. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng
mRNA of wild type and mutant C1C2 for two-electrode voltage clamp experiments.18–20
B. Data analysis and numerical fitting
Apparent kinetic parameters for channel activation and decay were determined by
monoexponential fitting of photocurrent data from the time the light is turned on to peak
current (τon), and from peak to stationary current (τdecay) using Eq. 1(a). Fast (τfast) and
slow (τslow) components of channel closing after the light is turned off were estimated by
bi-exponential fitting from the steady-state to off current (τoff) using Eq. 1(b),

where t is the time in ms, I is the photocurrent in A, τ is the time constant (in ms) of the
associated transition, A, B, and C are constants.
The current-voltage relationship for each construct was determined from photocurrent
traces recorded using the voltage step protocol (from membrane potential, Vm, of -100
mV to +40 mV in +20 mV steps) in Na+ bath solution at pH 7.0 or pH 9.0 (115 mM
NaCl, 2 mM BaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) or 10 mM Tris (pH 9.0).
The reversal potential, Erev, is the membrane potential at which there is no net current
flow through the channel. Erev was found from the plot of photocurrent vs. membrane
potential by linear interpolation, as previously described. 19,16 Data analysis was
performed using Mathworks MATLAB R2017a.

C. Four-state model fitting
Kinetic modeling of photocurrents was based on the four-state photocycle model (Fig.
1B). 16,21 Here, the model simulates channel photocurrents characterized by two closed
states (C1 and C2) and two open states (O1 and O2) using the following set of rate
equations,
[2]

[6]
The variables C1, C2, O1, and O2 represent the fractional population of each state. The
rates of light-dependent channel activation given by k1 and k2 represent the transitions C1
 O1 and C2  O2, respectively. Rates for the reverse of these transitions are given by
Gd1 and Gd2, respectively. The forward and reverse transitions between the two open
states during prolonged light stimulation are represented by e12 and e21. Lastly, Gr
represents the thermal conversion of C2 back to C1 in the dark. Gr was calculated by first
quantifying the percent recovery of peak current (p) relative to stationary current (s):
∆I2/∆I1 where ∆ I 2 = I p2 – I s2 and ∆ I1 = Ip1 – Is1. The subscripts correspond to the initial
photocurrent (1) and current upon a second light pulse (2) following wait periods in the
dark of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 seconds recorded at a holding potential of -100 mV. The
percent recovery was plotted against the dark time interval to generate the recovery
curve, and a monoexponential curve fit was performed to obtain the recovery time
constant Gr.8

D. Simulations
Atomistic simulations were based on the crystal structure of the closed-state
channelrhodopsin chimera, C1C2, with all-trans retinal (Protein Data Bank (PDB):
3UG9)17) protonated, E162(123) and D292(253) deprotonated. A molecular dynamics
simulation box contained C1C2, lipid bilayer with 200 molecules (100 per layer) of 1,2di-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), TIP3P water, and ions (Na+ and Cl-)
to neutralize the protein net charge and provide 0.15 M salt concentration. The total
number of atoms in the system was ~96,000. Electrostatic interactions were calculated
using the particle mesh Ewald algorithm with a real-space cut-off distance of 12 Å and
grid width of 1 Å. Single-point mutations V125L, N297V, or N297D were introduced to
a previously equilibrated non-conducting C1C2-WT structure with all-trans retinal. All
systems were equilibrated for 100 ns at 300 K. Protein structures and properties were
calculated from statistical averages of molecular coordinates obtained from an additional
20 ns of the molecular dynamics (MD) production runs. We followed the previously
reported molecular dynamics simulation set-up. 22 The pKa values of the ionizable C1C2
chimera side chains were calculated with the PROPKA code and averaged over the last
20 ns of molecular dynamics simulations.
To generate the open state structure, a total of 13 C1C2-WT starting structures (Table S1)
with 13-cis retinal, and varied protonation of E129(90), E162(123), D195(156), and
D292(253) were tested to predict a configuration for an open pore. Varied protonation of
the Schiff base (SB), a covalent link between retinal and lysine K296(257), and its
orientation toward opposing sides of the pore were also tested. Deprotonation of
D195(156) or the Schiff base (SB) yielded backbone root-mean-squared deviations
(RMSD) of ~ 2 Å (Table S1) with respect to the pre-equilibrated structure. Continuous
hydration of the channel was achieved by equilibration of C1C2-WT with 13-cis retinal,
protonated Schiff base oriented toward the extracellular side of the channel (SBH) and
E129(90), E162(123), and D292(253) deprotonated. The latter system's backbone RMSD
of 1.1 Å (Table S1, structure 13) was the lowest of all tested open-state C1C2-WT
protonation state variants, and helix VII displacement upon pore hydration was confirmed
with normal mode analysis (see Supporting Material, Fig. S1, for details). This result is in
agreement with the E90-helix II- tilt mechanism in ChR2 reported by Kuhne.14 That
structure was used for the open-state C1C2 studies carried out here. Differences in
structure between the closed and open states were in the conformation of retinal and
protonation of the gating residue E129(90) (Table S1).

III. RESULTS
A. Electrophysiological recordings
Functional expression of wild type and mutant C1C2 constructs in Xenopus laevis
oocytes was assessed using a classic two-electrode voltage clamp. Each construct
yielded measurable photocurrents (Fig. 3) upon activation with blue light (λmax = 470
nm). Apparent kinetic rates were extracted from photocurrent traces (Fig. 3A) measured
at a membrane potential of -100 mV by fitting either mono- or bi-exponential equations
(Eq. 1) to the experimental data (Table 1). The recovery time constant (Gr) of the
transient peak current upon subsequent light pulses is important since a rapid recovery

time is required to achieve fast repetitive stimulation of neurons. Recovery of the
transient peak current is significantly slower for C1C2 (Gr = 0.53 ± 0.03 ms-1) than for
ChR2 (Gr = 6.7 ± 0.1 s-1). ChR2 peak current recovers fully to its initial intensity within
30 s in the dark, whereas C1C2 plateaus at a maximum of 80% recovery. This result is
consistent with partial initial maximum responses reported by Lin et al.23
Application of the four-state kinetic algorithm to C1C2 experimental photocurrent traces
(Table S2) reveal that the N297D mutant has no significant change in any kinetic
parameter outside of a decrease in the maximal photocurrent. In contrast, the V125L
mutant decreases the rate of transition between O1 and the adjacent conformation states
C1 and O2, including a slower τon, Gd1, e21 and e12. This result demonstrates that, upon
making the V125L mutation, entry and exit to/from O1 is slower. This slowing likely
contributes to the exaggerated loss of IP upon repeated light stimuli (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
inspection of the kinetic algorithm for the N297V mutant demonstrates faster Gd1, e21 and
e12. Each of these faster components transitions C1C2 out of the O1 states and thus peak
currents can be observed even upon consecutive voltage pulses, as seen in Fig. 3B.
Substitution of valine 125 with leucine in C1C2 resulted in significantly slower overall
kinetics compared to the wild type variant. C1C2-V125L channel recovery was affected
most severely among all tested constructs, resulting in complete abolishment of peak
currents upon a second light pulse (Fig. 3B). No evidence of peak recovery was observed
after the wait period of up to 30 minutes in the dark. Similar trends were reported for the
analogous ChR2-V86L mutant. 20

The C1C2-N297D mutant showed slightly faster on and off rates compared to C1C2-WT,
but a similar current decay rate. The analogous mutation in ChR2-N258D resulted in
significantly slower decay (τdecay = 25.83 ± 3.07 ms) and off kinetics (τoff = 27.42 ± 0.96
ms) compared to ChR2-WT. 24
No significant differences in apparent kinetic rates were observed in the C1C2-N297V
mutant compared to wild type. A slightly larger recovery time constant (0.86 ± 0.04 s-1)
was observed in N297V compared with the wild type. This result contrasted with the
analogous mutation in ChR2-N258V, which led to a complete cessation of measurable
photocurrents despite a robust expression of protein. 16

† Values for Gr were calculated in Na+ measuring solution (pH 9.0) as values were too slow to measure at
pH 7.0.

The reversal potential, Erev, is the membrane potential at which the current flow through
the channel reverses direction. Thus, Erev indicates the ease of ion passage through the
pore. Reversal potentials (Table 1) were calculated from both peak and steady state
photocurrents (Fig. 3C). Compared to C1C2-WT, reversal potentials were observed to be
slightly less negative for N297D and slightly more negative for the N297V mutant in Na+
at pH 7.0. Reversal potentials for V125L were calculated only for the steady state current
due to the lack of recovery of peak current after the first light pulse. Compared to wild
type, V125L exhibited slightly more negative Erev.
The ratio of steady state to peak current, Iss / Ip, provides a measure of the degree of
channel inactivation (corresponding to decay) upon continuous illumination and gives
insight into the relative conductance of the two open states (O1 and O2). Steady-state to
peak current ratios were calculated for each construct (Table 1) from photocurrents
recorded at -100 mV in Na+ solution at pH 7.0. The Iss / Ip ratio for C1C2 wild type (0.77
± 0.02) is higher than for ChR2 (0.36 ± 0.01), indicating that C1C2 undergoes less
inactivation during prolonged light exposure. Comparison of C1C2 mutants against the
wild type channel revealed that V125L had an even higher Iss / Ip ratio, while significantly
lower values were seen for both the N297D and N297V constructs.
Overall, the experimental results show that C1C2 and its mutants do not behave like
ChR2 or its analogous variants except in the case of V125L. To gain insight about
differences observed here between C1C2 mutants and the wild type channel, we carry out
molecular dynamics simulations and analyze structure, hydration, and chemical
interactions in closed and open channels.

B. Molecular dynamics results
1. Structure and hydration of closed-state C1C2-WT and mutants
Introduction of V125L, N297V, and N297D single-point mutations to closed-state, darkadapted C1C2 yielded minimal structural changes in molecular dynamics simulations.
For example, little distortion occurred to protein backbone atoms (RMSD ~ 1 Å, Table
S3) when compared with the closed-state C1C2-WT structure. Furthermore, the
separations among helices involved in gating, II and VII (Table S3), remained about the
same in the closed states. In the extracellular, central, and intracellular parts of the
protein pore, those separations measured ~15, ~10, and ~10 Å, respectively. Finally, the
central gate appeared mostly the same in two mutants (V125L and N297D) as in the wild
type channel (Table S4). Recall that the central gate consists of a hydrogen bond
between the side chains of protonated E129(90) on helix II and asparagine or aspartic
acid N/D297(258) on helix VII. The N297V mutant was designed to eliminate that
central gate hydrogen bond.
Similar patterns of partial hydration were observed among the closed-state C1C2 variants
studied here. Notably, a water discontinuity existed consistently in the central region of
the channel, near the gating residues E129 and 297. Also, partial pore hydration in all
closed-state C1C2 variants was observed, with an average of 30-37 waters (Table S3) in
the transmembrane region of the channels. Residue 125 is spatially proximal to the gating
region of C1C2. In the closed-state channels, separations between helices II and VII in
the V125L mutant and WT differed by only 0.3 Å or less in either extracellular, central,
or intracellular sides of the pore. Nevertheless, C1C2-V125L accommodated on average
5 more waters compared with the WT channel in the closed states.
Given the similarity in structure and hydration, we attribute the experimentally observed
differences in the photocycle kinetics among the studied C1C2 variants to the mutationinduced rearrangement in the network of interactions among functionally important
residues.
2. Interaction networks in closed-state C1C2-WT and mutants
Although the separations between the gating helices (II and VII) remained nearly the
same among all the closed state channel structures, the mode of interaction changed
significantly. As noted above, placement of valine in position 297(258) on helix VII
prevented formation of the central gate hydrogen bond between residues 297 (helix VII)
and 129 (helix II) (Table 2). Instead, E129(90) formed a hydrogen bond directly with
E162(123) at a separation of r(O…O) = 2.6 ± 0.1 Å (Table S4). As a result of strong
competition in hydrogen bonding between E162(123) and residues E129(90), K296(257),
D292(253), T166(127), and K132(93), the distribution of acid dissociation constant
values (pKa) for residue E162 showed a multimodal pattern, with peaks at 1, 4.5, and 10
pKa units (Fig. S2). Further, the E162 pKa values spanned the widest range observed in
systems studied here.

Table 2. Schematic representation of hydrogen bonds (intact in gray lines, broken in red crosses,
weakened in light red crosses) in closed- and open-state C1C2-WT, N297D, N297V, and V125L
determined from pKa analysis. *

* Hydrogen bonds were defined based on average side chain heavy atom separation < 3 Å.
Hydrogen bond strength (weakening) was determined from pKa analysis. All results were
averaged over a 20-ns MD production run.

The mean pKa value for the gating residue E129 in the closed wildtype C1C2 was mildly
basic, pKa(E129) = 8.8 ± 0.4 (Table S5 and Fig. S2). That value resulted from a single
side chain hydrogen bond at the central gate, E129(90)-O...O-N297(258), and weak
Coulombic interactions between E129(90) and residues E162(123), D292(253), and
K132(93). In contrast, residue E129(90) in the C1C2-N297D mutant was strongly basic,
pKa(E129) = 12.1 ± 0.5, a value more than 3 units higher compared with the wild type
channel. That increased pKa value resulted from a nearly 4-fold stronger contribution
from a double hydrogen bond between side chains of E129(90) and D297(258) in C1C2N297D compared with a single one in E129-O...O-N297 from the wildtype protein.
Replacement of V125 with leucine resulted in r(SB-NH...D292) = 4.0 ± 0.4 Å, an ~1 Å
increase in separation between the Schiff base and its proton acceptor when compared
with the corresponding distance in N297V closed-state C1C2 variants (Table S4). That
structural change led to a 1 pKa unit increase in D292 from 2.8 ± 1.2 on average in the
wild type to pKa(D292) = 3.8 ± 1.4 on average in V125L (Table S5). Noting that L125
resides ~10 Å away from D292, it is clear these changes are a consequence of

reorganization among intramolecular interactions in C1C2-V125L. In contrast,
replacement of polar (asparagine) with electrically charged (aspartic acid) side chain in
position 297 (N297D) does not affect the pKa of D292 in either closed (pKa~3) or open
(pKa ~0.7) states when compared with C1C2-WT (Fig. S2).
3. Structure and hydration of open-state C1C2-WT and mutants
In contrast to the closed-state C1C2 variants with trans-retinal, the open-state channels
contain retinal in the 13-cis conformation. Retinal isomerization caused only small
distortions to protein backbone structure (measured as RMSD) and mostly small
variations in the separation of gating helices II and VII as reported earlier25. Consistent
with earlier results, the side chain of E129 (90) had a downward movement when
transitioning from the closed to open state. 14 Despite the modest structural changes,
equilibration of the open-state structures resulted in significant changes to water
occupancy (Table S3). For example, waters entered and formed a continuous pathway
through each open-state C1C2 (Fig. 1C). While not a complete explanation, specific
structural changes occurred upon pore opening that help account for continuous hydration
throughout the pore. In general, the number of waters in the transmembrane region
increased by an average of 16-27 molecules in each C1C2 variant upon pore opening,
bringing the totals up to 53-58 waters. Simultaneously, the maximum distortion to protein
backbone structure measured only 0.3 Å (in variant N297D) and the separation between
helices II and VII varied by less than ~ 1 Å in most cases.
In the open C1C2-V125L channel, at the intracellular side of the pore, the HII-HVII
distance decreased by 0.7 Å. That change marked the only contraction observed. In
contrast, the extracellular side expanded by ~ 1 Å. In this variant, the fewest number of
waters on average (16) entered the transmembrane region of the pore.
In the open C1C2-N297D mutant, the separation between helices HII-HVII at the
extracellular side increased by ~ 1 Å, without contraction elsewhere. That helix
expansion was concurrent with a tilt of the R175(136) side chain, and corresponded to
water inflow from the extracellular side toward the Schiff base. This mutant attained the
highest increase in average water occupancy (+27 H2O).
In mutant C1C2-N297V, a 2-Ångstrom-increase occurred in the separation of the gating
helices (HII-HVII) at the extracellular side of the pore. Simultaneously, the hydrophobic
side chain of residue V297(258) tilted toward the lipid bilayer, allowing space for the
influx of an additional 21 waters and formation of a continuous pore.
In the wild-type C1C2, the gating helices expanded by ~ 4 Å at the intracellular side of
the pore, representing the largest variation measured. Still, roughly the same number of
additional waters entered C1C2-WT (26) as for variant N297D (27). Normal mode
analysis identified helix VII as containing the backbone carbon atoms involved in the
largest displacements from the equilibrated C1C2-WT structure (Fig. S1). However, our
molecular dynamics studies suggest that the change in the separation between helices II
and VII does not play a primary role in allowing water access into the previously dry
region of the pore. Additional considerations, such as the altered electrostatic charge

distribution due to the presence of an acidic residue (D in the N297D mutant), may
account for water occupancy even in more restricted areas of the channel, where helices
II and VII remain close together.
Based on the C1C2 crystal structure and MD simulations, HVII is the longest of the
helices, extending furthest past the lipid bilayer into the intracellular side of the protein.
Additionally, retinal is bound to HVII and the putative ion channel is found between
helices VII and II. All these factors suggest that HVII would be the most susceptible to
conformational changes or displacement during the photocycle, as confirmed by the
normal mode analysis (Fig. S1). These changes may occur during transitions between the
equilibrated closed and open states studied here. Helix VII is connected to the cytosolic
C-terminal of channelrhodopsins (not included in this study), thus it can be expected that
even minor conformational changes affecting HVII are likely transduced to the
intracellular domain as the first step in a yet to be discovered C. reinhardtii signaling
pathway. Future simulations of those transitions would help in further defining structural
changes that occur during the photocycle.
Results from the MD simulations show that a substantial addition of water molecules
accompanies equilibration of the open-state C1C2 structures. While specific structural
changes involving expansion/contraction of the separation between gating residues HII
and HVII help account for water addition, the comparison is imperfect. For example, the
largest expansion between the gating residues of C1C2-WT does not correlate with a
similarly larger addition of waters into the transmembrane pore region (Table S3).
Noting that rearrangements in protein side chains also accompanied water entry into the
open-state channels, we further analyze side chain positions, particularly in the central
gating region near residues 129 and 297.
4. Interaction networks in open-state C1C2-WT and mutants
In all open-state C1C2 channels, except N297V, complete pore hydration was achieved
by weakening of the closed-state central gate defined by the hydrogen bond between
deprotonated E129 and residue 297. The weakened gate, characterized by downward
shifts in pKa of E129 (Table S5), led to a concurrent increase of hydrophilicity in the
gating region. Additional rearrangements in hydrated C1C2 included formation of
shorter E129(90)...K132(93)...E162(132) salt bridges in each of the mutants (Table 2).
Furthermore, residue D292(253) formed a hydrogen bond with the retinal Schiff base at a
close distance of 2.7 ± 0.1 Å (Table S4), while interactions between the Schiff base NH
group (SB-NH) and residue E162(123) expanded significantly compared to the closedstate structures. That change identifies D292 as the unambiguous primary acceptor of the
Schiff base proton in C1C2.
In contrast to the other C1C2 variants, neither of the gating residues in C1C2-V125L
interacted with S102(63) on helix I, following lengthening of the E129...N297 hydrogen
bond and pore hydration. Instead, S102(63) formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone
oxygen of T98(59) at 2.8 ± 0.3 Å. Concurrently, only in C1C2-V125L did the pKa(E129)
values of both closed (~9) and open (~7) states remain similar to the corresponding
values in C1C2-WT.

Mutant C1C2-N297V lacks the central gate in the closed-state and showed a different
structure and hydration pattern upon opening, as described above. An alternative formed
between E129(90) and E162(123) in the closed state. While a significant Coulombic
interaction between E129(90) and E162(123) persisted in the open state (Table S4), the
side chain of E129(90) shifted toward S102(63).
In fully hydrated C1C2-N297D, the interaction between E129...D297 weakened as
E129(90) formed a salt bridge with K132(93) (Table S4 and double peak in pKa (E129,
N297D) distribution, red line in Fig. S2)). K132(93) participated in an extended network
of salt bridges with E129(90), E162(123), and D292(253), which resulted in pKa(K132) =
15.4 ± 0.7; an increase of 3 pKa units from the corresponding values in closed (11.6 ±
0.3) and open (11.5 ± 0.5) C1C2-WT (Table S5).
Aspartic acid D156 and cysteine C128 were suggested to play an important role in ChR2
kinetics.26,27 Interestingly, pKa modeling of C1C2 (Figure S2 and Table S5) indicated
that the DC gate residues D195(156) and C167(128) were among the amino acids least
affected by both single point mutations and pore opening.

IV. DISCUSSION
Light-activated ion channels, channelrhodopsins (ChRs), are commonly used in
optogenetics for selective control of ChR-augmented excitable cells like neurons and
muscle cells. While C1C2 has been used as a model of ChR2, recovery of the transient
peak current is incomplete and significantly slower for C1C2 when compared with ChR2.
To understand better the molecular determinants of channel gating and resulting
photocycle kinetics, we conducted computational and electrophysiology experiments on
wild type ChR chimera, C1C2-WT, and the following mutants: C1C2-N297D, C1C2N297V, and C1C2-V125L.
Along with isomerization, retinal deprotonation and reprotonation are key steps in the
ChR photocycle. Two residues, E162(123) and D292(253), have been proposed as Schiff
base proton acceptors. 2,8,28 Subsequently, E123, homologous to D85, the Schiff base
proton acceptor in bacteriorhodopsin (bR), was shown to be dispensable for ChR2
function. 29 Based on the crystal structure of wild type C1C2, Kato et al. suggested
D292(253), analogous to D212 in the bR homologue, as a Schiff base proton acceptor.17
In closed-state C1C2-WT equilibrated in our studies, oxygen atoms of either E162(123)
or D292(253) resided within ~3 Å of the Schiff base nitrogen. However, in all open-state
C1C2 variants, only D292(253) formed a hydrogen bond with the protonated Schiff base,
thus confirming D292(253) as a primary Schiff base proton acceptor in C1C2.
The dark-adapted channelrhodopsin central gate, defined by the hydrogen bond between
protonated E129(90) and N297(258)14 (Table S4), prevents formation of a continuously
water-filled channel. In the absence of that interaction, as in the closed state C1C2N297V mutant, protonated E129 (helix II) forms a hydrogen bond with E162 (helix III)
(Table S4), a possible Schiff base proton acceptor in the closed-state structure. That bond

creates a barrier to continuous water pore formation in the central region of the pore and
acts as an alternative central gate.
Our simulations also show that hydration of the channel requires a minimum of four
factors: 1) the presence of 13-cis retinal, 2) deprotonation of E129(90), 3) subsequent
weakening of the E129(90) and N/D297(258) interaction when present, and 4) water
access to previously dry regions among helices I, II, III and VII. When the central gate is
absent, as in the N297V variant, then the additional requirement for channel hydration
may be associated with an ~2 Å increase in helix II - VII separation at the extracellular
side of the pore. This data is consistent with inspection of electrophysiological data that
showed that E129 should be deprotonated in the photocycle. 25
Opening of the channel occurs via rearrangement of the C1C2 side chains without
significant displacement of the protein backbone. Protonation of E129(90) throughout the
channelrhodopsin photocycle remains a subject of debate. Recently Hayashi30 described
an alternative mechanism for C1C2 pore hydration in the presence of protonated E129.
Kuhne et al. 14 presented an E90-helix II-tilt model that indicates deprotonation of E90 as
critical to pore hydration. Here, we observed that the changes in protonation of E129(90)
and retinal conformation induce reordering of side chains and an increase in local
hydrophilicity, which permit water influx into the transmembrane region among helices I,
II, III and VII. These observations agree with the work of Fonfria et al. ChR channel
hydration is a prerequisite for transport of monovalent and divalent cations down their
electrochemical gradients. Electrophysiology experiments performed here indicate that
the N297D mutation in C1C2 slightly increases Na+ permeability, while N297V slightly
decreases Na+ permeability, as expected from changes in the electrostatic interactions
between ions and their ligating chemical groups. 31
Single point mutations in the gating region of channelrhodopsins strongly influence
photocycle kinetics. For instance, replacement of asparagine with aspartic acid in C1C2N297D yielded overall faster kinetics compared with C1C2-WT. We speculate that
aspartic acid in position 297, also in the spatial vicinity of the Schiff base proton acceptor
D292(253), contributes to proton transfer. Replacement of asparagine with valine in the
analogous position of the ChR2-N258V variant in previous work led to protein
expression in oocytes, but negligible photocurrents prevented functional studies of the
variant.16 In the present work, the introduction of a hydrophobic residue in the gating
region of C1C2-N297V resulted in pore gating via E129(90)...E162(123) hydrogen
bonding, an alternative central gate. The N297V mutation affected C1C2 photocycle
kinetics minimally when compared with wild type C1C2. We attribute the slightly faster
off kinetics and recovery of peak current in the dark to weakening of the
D292(253)...K132(93) hydrogen bond in the open state compared with other variants
studied here. In all studied closed and open mutants, K132(93) forms a network of salt
bridges with either E129(90) or E162(123). In ChR2, the analogous lysine K93, along
with corresponding residues D253, E90, E213, R123, and H249, have been indicated
previously as a component of a proton transfer route to the cytosol.32 Further
investigations are required to understand that process better in C1C2.

Interestingly, the slowest overall photocycle kinetics occurred in the conservative C1C2V125L mutant. Moreover, peak currents were completely eradicated upon a second light
pulse. Comparable behavior was observed in mutation of the analogous residue, ChR2V86L. 16 In that earlier work, the authors hypothesized that leucine 86 may interfere with
helix II displacement and thus affect channel gating. In our simulations, we did not
observe significant differences in backbone displacement among C1C2-WT and C1C2V125L in either closed or open states. In the open state C1C2-V125L channel, however,
neither S102...E129 nor S102...N297 hydrogen bonds formed, in contrast to the other
variants. These differences suggest that in C1C2, where helices I and II differ from the
ones in ChR2, residue S102(63) on helix I plays a role in gating kinetics differences
among C1C2-WT and the mutants studied here.

V. CONCLUSIONS
Our comprehensive electrophysiology studies of C1C2 wild type, C1C2-N297D, C1C2N297V, and C1C2-V125L show that replacement of a single amino acid has significant
influence on photocycle kinetics. Complementary computational studies correlate
variations in intramolecular interactions near the C1C2 central gating region to results
observed experimentally.
The closed-state C1C2 structure includes all-trans retinal, protonated E129(90), and
protonated Schiff base (SBH) facing toward the extracellular side of the membrane. The
central gate, which holds together helices II and VII (E129(90)...N297(258)), prevents
formation of a water-filled channel. Mutations near the gate had minimal effect on
structure – in particular, separation between the gating helices remained the same.
Similar patterns of partial pore hydration and a water discontinuity near the gating
residues were observed for all closed channels.
The opening of the channel and initial hydration of the previously dry gating regions
between helices I, II, III, and VII of the channel occurs with 1) the presence of 13-cis
retinal; 2) deprotonation of a glutamic acid gating residue, E129; and 3) subsequent
weakening of the central gate hydrogen bond between the same glutamic acid E129 and
asparagine N282 in the central region of the pore. In the studies pursued here, the Schiff
base remains protonated and oriented as in the closed state.
Introduction of an acidic side chain in the central gate of C1C2-N297D resulted in
slightly faster overall kinetics compared to C1C2-WT, but a similar current decay rate.
Also, Na+ permeability increased slightly, as expected for addition of stronger
electrostatic interactions between the ion and ligating chemical groups. In the open
C1C2-N297D, an additional ~27 waters entered the transmembrane region, yielding the
second largest backbone RMSD relative to fully hydrated C1C2-WT. At the extracellular
side of open C1C2-N297D, the separation between helices II and VII increased by only ~
1 Å and induced a tilt of the R175(136) side chain and water inflow from the extracellular
side toward the Schiff base and its proton acceptor. In contrast to studies of the closed
state structure, the Schiff base proton acceptor in the open state is identified
unambiguously here as D292(253).

In the absence of the central gate connecting helices II and VII in the C1C2-N297V
mutant, an alternative gate in the central region of the pore formed through a hydrogen
bond between E129(90) on helix II and E162(123) on helix III. That alternative gate may
help explain why the N297V mutation affected C1C2 photocycle kinetics minimally
when compared with wild type C1C2.
In C1C2-V125L, the conservative mutation (valine to leucine) was introduced, which is
spatially proximal to the central gate and resulted in the slowest overall photocycle
kinetics. Moreover, the peak currents were completely eradicated upon a second light
pulse. Based on computational results, S102(63) on helix I may play a role in gating
kinetics differences among C1C2-WT and the mutants studied here. Specifically, neither
S102...E129 nor S102...N297 hydrogen bonds formed in the C1C2-V125L open-state
channel, in contrast to the other variants. Those variants had faster photocycle kinetics
and peak currents upon a second light pulse. Instead, V125L disrupts the S102 interaction
with gating residues in the open state and thus disrupts ion channel gating.
In summary, replacement of helices I and II in ChR2 with corresponding residues from
ChR1, resulted in significantly slower and incomplete recovery of C1C2 transient peak
current compared with ChR2. Differences also appeared in the N297 mutants. Thus,
kinetic results substantiate that replacement of helices I and II in ChR2 with
corresponding residues from ChR1, to make the chimera C1C2, affects the kinetics of
channelrhodopsin pore gating significantly, making C1C2 a unique channel. This study
correlated fine differentiation of the interaction network in the central region of the pore
to changes in photocycle kinetics. Our computational studies confirmed D292(253) as a
primary Schiff base proton acceptor in C1C2. Moreover, by using both atomistic
computational and electrophysiology studies, we showed how small variations via a
single-point mutation near the gating region affect C1C2 photocycle kinetics.
