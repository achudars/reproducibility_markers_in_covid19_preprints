Summary
Proliferative control in cancer cells is frequently disrupted by mutations in the RB-pathway.
Intriguingly, RB1 mutations can arise late in tumorigenesis in cancer cells whose RB-pathway is
already compromised by another mutation. In this study, we present evidence for increased
DNA damage and instability in CDKN2A silenced cancer cells when RB1 mutations are induced.
We generated isogenic RB1 mutant genotypes with CRISPR in a number of cell lines. Cells with
even one mutant copy of RB1 have increased basal levels of DNA damage and increased mitotic
errors. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species as well as impaired homologous
recombination repair underlie this DNA damage. When xenografted into immune compromised
mice RB1 mutant cells exhibit an elevated propensity to seed new tumors in recipient lungs. This
study offers evidence that late arising RB1 mutations can facilitate genome instability and cancer
progression that are beyond the pre-existing proliferative control deficit.

Introduction
Loss of proliferative control is a defining feature of human cancer. Most cancer cells
develop cell intrinsic mechanisms of supplying growth stimulatory signals as well as disrupting
the response to cell cycle arrest cues (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). To this end, mutations in
the RB-pathway are central to disrupting proliferative control in tumorigenesis (Burkhart and
Sage, 2008; Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; Sherr and McCormick, 2002). Deletion of the RB1
gene prevents cell cycle arrest in response to a broad range of signals (Knudsen and Knudsen,
2008). Similarly, overexpression or hyperactivation of D-type Cyclins and their associated
Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) can lead to constitutive RB protein (RB) phosphorylation and
cell cycle entry. Lastly, deletion or promoter methylation of CDKN2A that encodes the CDK
inhibitor p16 serves to deregulate kinase activity causing constitutive phosphorylation of RB.
Cancer cell genomes that sustain a single mutation in this pathway are considered to have
disrupted RB-pathway function and are deficient for cell cycle control (Dyson, 2016; Knudsen
and Knudsen, 2008; Sherr, 1996). Historically, this concept of RB-pathway inactivation
suggested that mutations in different components of the pathway are relatively equivalent and
additional mutations provide no subsequent advantage to cancer progression (Dick et al., 2018;
Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008; Sherr, 1996; Sherr and McCormick, 2002).
A number of recent clinical observations challenge the logic of single RB-pathway
mutations in cancer. First, multiple studies have shown that RB1 loss is specifically predictive of
a favourable response to chemotherapy (Cecchini et al., 2015; Garsed et al., 2017; Ludovini et
al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2012), whereas p16 expression or overall proliferative rates are not
(Cecchini et al., 2015; Garsed et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2012). This suggests that RB-pathway
mutations are not necessarily equivalent. Second, a number of studies have suggested that RB1

gene loss is more prevalent in advanced cancers, or mechanistically contribute to progression or
dissemination (Beltran et al., 2016; McNair et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2017; Thangavel et al.,
2017), a stage where cell autonomous proliferative control is presumably already deregulated.
Collectively, these examples suggest RB1 mutation facilitates more than alterations to
proliferative control and that RB1 loss may confer other cancer relevant characteristics.
Remarkably, some studies even highlight that single copy loss of RB1 may be functionally
significant (Coschi et al., 2014; Gonzalez-Vasconcellos et al., 2013; McNair et al., 2017; Zheng
et al., 2002).
Beyond the RB protein’s role in cell cycle control through E2F transcriptional regulation,
it has been reported to participate in a host of functions that contribute to genome stability
(Velez-Cruz and Johnson, 2017). These include chromosome condensation through RBdependent recruitment of Condensin II and Cohesin (Longworth et al., 2008; Manning et al.,
2014). The RB protein also influences repair of DNA breaks through both non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ) (Cook et al., 2015), and homologous recombination (HR) (Velez-Cruz et al.,
2016), and induction of mitochondrial biogenesis that impacts cell metabolism (Benevolenskaya
and Frolov, 2015; Jones et al., 2016; Nicolay et al., 2015). Some of these functions, such as
repair of DNA breaks by HR, are obligatorily outside of RB’s role in G1 to S-phase regulation.
In addition, other roles, such as effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism take place in
proliferating populations of cells further suggesting that this is independent of G1-S regulation
and the RB-pathway. It is noteworthy that some atypical RB functions in genome stability, or
late stage cancer progression, may be sensitive to single copy loss (Coschi et al., 2014;
Gonzalez-Vasconcellos et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2002). Thus, the existence
of shallow RB1 deletions may indicate that RB’s less well appreciated functions in genome

stability could underlie cancer relevant characteristics that are independent of classical RBpathway function in cancer (Dick et al., 2018).
In order to test if RB1 loss is relevant to cancer cells that already possess RB-pathway
disruption, we induced mutations in RB1 using CRISPR/Cas9. These cells displayed
spontaneous DNA damage as evidenced by gH2AX foci and elevated levels of reactive oxygen
species. We also determined that RB1 mutations decreased the ability to repair DNA breaks by
homologous recombination, and this is supported by elevated levels of anaphase bridges in
mitosis. RB1 mutant cells were xenografted into immune compromised mice and this revealed
similar growth kinetics in subcutaneous implantation, with RB1 null showing greater propensity
to colonize lungs. These experiments underscore the discovery that RB1 mutation in cells that
already possess RB-pathway disruption creates DNA damage and fuels cancer progression.

Results
Spontaneous DNA damage in RB1 deficient cancer cells.
To investigate RB1 deficiency in RB-pathway disrupted cells, we utilized U2OS cells that
do not express p16, the product of CDKN2A (Forbes et al., 2017). We used CRISPR technology
and gRNA pairs that target exon 22 of RB1 because loss of this exon creates null alleles in cancer
(Horowitz et al., 1990)(SFig. 1A). Cells were transfected with plasmids to deliver pairs of
gRNAs and Cas9 (or the D10A mutant). Following transient drug selection, colonies were
isolated, expanded, and genotyped by PCR to search for RB1 deletions (SFig. 1B). Candidates
were rigorously selected by checking RB protein expression (SFig. 1C), ensuring heterozygous
clones were not cell mixtures (SFig. 1D), and confirming that the most likely off targets were not
mutated (SFig. 1E). Using this approach, we selected four clones each for wild type and
knockout RB1 genotypes, and three clones for the RB1+/- genotype that were used in subsequent
experiments.
To determine if RB1 mutation status affects genome stability in these engineered cell
lines, DNA damage was assessed in untreated, proliferating cells by staining for γH2AX. Foci
were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy and images were captured using confocal
microscopy (Fig. 1A). The quantity of foci per nucleus was determined and this revealed a
significant increase in gH2AX in the knockout and heterozygous lines compared to those that are
wild type for RB1 (Fig. 1B). To extend this observation, we analyzed gH2AX foci in control and
RB1 null U2OS clones produced by targeting a different exon 2, as well as clones of control and
RB1 mutant NCI-H460 (CDKN2A deleted) and NCI-H1792 (CDK4 amplified) lung cancer cells
(SFig. 2). This analysis also demonstrated an elevation in the number of gH2AX foci in each of
the RB1 deleted lines.

reactive oxygen species, and sensitivity to cisplatin. (A) Representative confocal microscopy
images of gH2AX foci (red) in control, heterozygous, and homozygous RB1 mutant cells. Cells
were counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei (blue). (B) gH2AX foci counts for each of the
RB1 genotypes. The average proportion of cells with discrete numbers of foci are shown as
histograms, while the cumulative frequency of foci for each genotype is shown as an inset. The
distribution in foci for RB1 wild type (4 different clones), heterozygous (3 different clones) and
knockouts (4 different clones) are significantly different as determined by the KolmogorovSmirnov test. (C) Hydrogen peroxide and (D) cisplatin were added to cultures of the indicated
genotypes of cells. Viability was assessed after 72 h using alamarBlue and dose response curves
were used to calculate IC50 values for each genotype. Both RB1 mutant genotypes are
significantly lower than U2OS cells (as determined by one-way ANOVA). (E) To detect reactive
oxygen species (ROS), CA-DCF-DA was added to culture media at the end of 72 h of mock
treatment or hydrogen peroxide. Normalized fluorescence was averaged for four clones of RB1
wild type and knockout genotypes, and three clones for the heterozygous genotype. Mean values
were compared by two-way ANOVA. (F) Cells were fixed and stained for 8-oxoG and DAPI
and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The average 8-oxoG signal per nucleus was
determined using ImageJ with DAPI staining defining nuclear area. Three clones per genotype
were used and data was normalized to the mean signal from RB1 wild type. Statistical
significance in staining intensity was determined by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of
variance and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. All error bars are ±1 SEM. *P < 0.05.

To further investigate the source of DNA damage in RB1 mutant cells, we assessed their
sensitivity to a number of chemical agents to determine if specific stresses could amplify defects
that cause increased DNA damage. We tested aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor, that
causes replication stress and etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor, that creates DNA double
stranded breaks. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to induce oxidative damage, and cisplatin
was used to create interstrand cross links, among other damaging effects. Representative clones
of each genotype were treated for 72 h, after which alamarBlue was used to quantitate the
cytotoxicity of each agent. These assays revealed that both heterozygous and homozygous RB1
mutations sensitize cells to hydrogen peroxide and cisplatin (Fig. 1C&D), but not aphidicolin or
etoposide (SFig. 3A&B). This suggests oxidative damage may underlie some aspects of the
DNA damage phenotype in U2OS cells. We compared ROS levels in wild type and RB1 mutant
cells with and without H2O2 using a ROS indicator, 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CA-DCF-DA). For both untreated and H2O2 treated cells,
there was more fluorescence of the ROS indicator in RB1 mutant cells, as RB1-/- and RB1+/- were
equivalent (Fig. 1E). We also fixed and stained cells for 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), one of the
most abundant lesions resulting from oxidative modification of DNA (Furtado et al., 2012), and
quantified the staining in DAPI-defined nuclear area using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012).
Control U2OS values were used to normalize the 8-oxoG signal from RB1 mutants. Again, both
RB1+/- and RB1-/- U2OS cells had more 8-oxoG staining than the RB1+/+ cells (Fig. 1F).
These experiments indicate that loss of RB1 in cells with pre-existing RB-pathway
defects increases basal levels of DNA damage. Reactive oxygen species appear to be one source
of this damage. Chemical agents that directly induce breaks did not selectively affect RB1
mutant cells, which was consistent with a lack of elevation in 53BP1 foci in RB1-mutant U2OS

cells compared to controls (SFig. 3C). This suggests the nature of DNA damage marked by
gH2AX in these RB1-mutant cells is not necessarily double stranded DNA breaks, or double
stranded DNA breaks are not repaired by NHEJ. Overall, these experiments indicate that RB1
loss contributes to an unstable genome, regardless of the proliferative control status of the cell.

RB1 mutant cells have randomly distributed DNA damage.
To further understand spontaneous DNA damage in RB1 mutant U2OS cells, we sought
to determine if damage occurred at specific locations within the genome. We performed ChIPsequencing to identify DNA sequences associated with gH2AX, as well as histone H4 as a
control. Because spontaneous damage in untreated cell cultures is relatively inabundant, we
pooled chromatin from 20 separate gH2AX ChIP experiments per genotype to create each
sequencing library (Fig. 2A-E). We determined peak locations and number using MACS (Zhang
et al., 2008), and the quantity of gH2AX and H4 peaks were similar between genotypes (Fig.
2A). Looking at a large region of chromosome 4 as a representative view of the genome, we did
not observe consequential differences between genotypes for gH2AX or H4 peaks (Fig. 2B).
Since peak-finding at a genome scale failed to indicate obvious locations of DNA damage
enrichment, we investigated individual genome sequence categories in search of elevated
gH2AX deposition. The proportion of aligned gH2AX ChIP-Seq reads per million mapped reads
versus input reads for each of the genotypes were compared within each repetitive element
category and log2 transformed for display as a heat map (Fig 2C). Some categories, such as
SINEs and multicopy genes appear to have slight enrichment of gH2AX localization in RB1+/and RB1-/- compared to RB1+/+ based on color, but a two-tailed one-sample t-test with FDR
multi-test correction did not score these as significant. Therefore, even within repetitive

proportions of the RB1 mutants at the various CFS is equal to the normalized read count
proportion of the corresponding CFS in the wild type. CFS where FDR were less than 0.1 were
grouped according to whether there were significantly more alignments in the RB1 mutants, or
significantly more alignments in the RB1+/+ sample. There is no significant difference between
these two categories (determined by unpaired t-test). Error bars are ±1 SEM. (E) ChIP-Seq tracks
for gH2AX and H4 at representative CFS are displayed. FRA2E had more reads in RB1+/- and

sequences in the genome, there does not seem to be an enrichment of gH2AX within RB1 mutant
cells compared to control.
Previous studies suggest that gH2AX levels can be elevated at common fragile sites
(CFS) under standard cell culture conditions (Harrigan et al., 2011). To investigate these
locations we quantified the number of gH2AX ChIP-Seq reads and scaled them to the
proportions of total aligned reads and normalized them to input levels. RB1+/- and RB1-/- were
compared to wild type using a two-tailed one-sample t-test. This analysis revealed 23 CFS that
had more gH2AX alignments than the wild type and 24 CFS that had significantly less in RB1mutant cells compared to controls (SFig. 4 and Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E shows examples of CFS
locations with increased gH2AX (FRA2E) in mutants, reduced gH2AX (FRA6G) in mutants, and
unchanged gH2AX levels (FRA6D). These examples appear highly similar between genotypes.
Overall, it is possible that the distribution of gH2AX within each CFS may be shifting slightly
between the mutants and the wild type. However, there does not appear to be more of a bias in
general for gH2AX elevation at CFS in the RB1 mutant cells.
Collectively, our analysis of gH2AX distribution across the genome suggests there is no
particular chromosome location or sequence category that is preferentially enriched for this mark
of DNA damage. These data suggest that the increase in gH2AX foci observed in RB1+/- and
RB1-/- cells is likely due to an overall increase in DNA damage, and not newly arising locations,
or “hotspots” of damage. This is in contrast to primary cells with a normal RB-pathway that
experience RB loss and preferentially damage centromeric repeats (Coschi et al., 2014). The
elevated sensitivity to peroxide and cisplatin, and increased ROS and 8-oxoG are consistent with
DNA damage being randomly located in RB1 mutant U2OS cells.

Homologous recombination repair defects in RB1 deficient cancer cells.
Another potential source of intrinsic DNA damage could arise from defective repair. For
this reason we investigated the efficiency of HR and NHEJ repair using fluorescent reporters
(Bennardo et al., 2008; Pierce et al., 1999). In this assay a promoterless, but functional, GFP is
used to repair an adjacent break induced in a mutant, expressed, form of the GFP gene (Fig. 3A).
We generated stable U2OS lines bearing this reporter and deleted RB1 with lentiviral delivery of
Cas9 and an RB1 specific gRNA (Fig. 3B). Introduction of the restriction enzyme I-SceI into
these cells induced breaks and RB1 deficient cells were defective for their repair (Fig. 3C).
Similarly, we generated U2OS cells that stably maintain an NHEJ reporter for repair of an
induced break that links a constitutive promoter with a GFP gene. Loss of RB expression was
again confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 3E), and induction of breaks was used to test repair in
an RB1 deficient background (Fig. 3F). This failed to reveal a defect in repair suggesting that
RB1 loss in U2OS cells specifically reduces HR repair.
To assess how RB1 mutant U2OS cells respond to DNA breaks, each genotype was
exposed to 2 Gy of gamma radiation (gIR). Cells were fixed and stained for gH2AX and DAPI
at various time points to measure the amount of DNA damage. One hour after gIR, there was a
pronounced increase in gH2AX foci in all genotypes compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3G).
However, the amount of DNA damage was significantly greater in RB1-/- clones compared to
heterozygous or wild type cells. After 24 hr, most of the DNA damage was repaired, and the
RB1-/- still had more gH2AX foci than the other two genotypes. Overall, this indicates that cells
completely lacking RB are more sensitive to gIR, likely because they are not able to repair DNA
breaks as efficiently by HR repair.
Next, we investigated the fidelity of mitosis to determine if the elevated levels of DNA

of the DR homology directed repair construct used. Cleavage of an I-SceI site integrated into an
expressed, but mutant GFP gene, can be repaired from a downstream internal GFP fragment
(iGFP). (B) U2OS cells with clonal integration of the HR reporter construct, were ablated for
RB1 expression with lentiviral delivery of Cas9 and an RB1 specific sgRNA. Relative expression
of RB was determined by western blotting and SP1 serves as a loading control. (C) HR repair
efficiency of RB1 mutant U2OS cells was determined by transfecting an expression vector for ISceI endonuclease (I-SceI +), or relevant negative control expression vector, and quantitating PIand GFP+ cells by flow cytometry (n=5). (D) Schematic of the EJ5 NHEJ reporter system. DNA
breaks at tandem I-SceI sites release the puromycin resistance gene, allowing NHEJ repair to
join a promoter to GFP expressing sequence. (E) After generation of a stable U2OS clone
containing the NHEJ reporter construct, RB1 was deleted as above and confirmed by western
blotting. (F) NHEJ repair efficiency was determined by transfecting an I-SceI endonuclease
expression vector (I-SceI +), or negative control, and PI- and GFP+ cells were quantitated by
flow cytometry (n=3). (G) Cells were treated with 2 Gy IR and fixed 1 hr or 24 hr after treatment
and stained for gH2AX. Untreated cells were stained in parallel. Three clones per genotype were
used and gH2AX foci were quantified. The proportion of cells with discrete numbers of foci are
shown as histograms, while the cumulative frequency of foci are shown as inset. Differences in
foci distribution were determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A green asterisk indicates
RB1-/- is statistically different than the other genotypes, while a black asterisk indicates all
genotypes are statistically significantly different from each other. All error bars are 1 SEM. *P <

damage and impaired HR repair impacted chromosome segregation and aneuploidy (Gelot et al.,
2015). Flow cytometry was performed on RB1 deficient cells that were labeled and stained with
BrdU and propidium iodide (Cecchini et al., 2012). This analysis failed to show statistically
different changes in cell cycle phases between the different genotypes (Fig. 4A). However,
when DNA content greater than 4N was analyzed, there was a significant difference between
wild type and RB1 knockout cells, with RB1+/- cells showing an intermediate value (Fig. 4B).
This suggests mitotic errors in these cells may lead to aneuploidy.
To further investigate mitotic defects, cells were stained with DAPI and antibodies to
BLM to visualize chromosome bridges, and mitotic figures were imaged using confocal
microscopy (Fig 4C). We observed abundant chromosome bridges in RB1-/- and RB1+/- mutant
cells (Fig. 4D). In the RB1 mutants there were some ultra-fine bridges (UFBs), which are
“thread-like” DNA structures that stain only with BLM (Chan and Hickson, 2011). However,
the majority of BLM bridges stained with DAPI, indicating that anaphase bridges were most
common (SFig. 5). Anaphase bridges are known to occur in homologous recombination (HR)defective cells, while UFBs can be induced by replication stress (Gelot et al., 2015). Our
analysis of mitotic errors is consistent with a defect in HR repair being the source of
chromosome bridges in anaphase of these RB1 mutant cells.

Increased lung metastases in RB1 mutant xenografts.
To further characterize the effects of induced RB1 mutations in cells that already possess
RB-pathway defects, we performed xenograft experiments to determine if new cancer relevant
properties arise upon loss of RB. We injected cells subcutaneously into immune compromised
mice and allowed tumors to form for an eight-week period before analyzing growth by mass and

histology (Fig. 5A). This analysis revealed a highly cellular structure with abundant mitotic
figures. Cells appeared epithelioid with no definite features of osteoid differentiation and they
had small areas of glandular organization, this phenotype was consistent among all genotypes
(Fig. 5B). Tumor masses were determined at end point and were not statistically different
between genotypes, with RB1-/- even trending towards a smaller size (Fig. 5C). Mice were also
tail-vein injected and cell dissemination and proliferation were allowed to proceed for eight
weeks at which time lungs were harvested, fixed, and sectioned. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections were digitally analyzed to quantitate cellular infiltration of U2OS cells (Fig. 5D). This
revealed a striking increase in RB1-/- U2OS cells in the lungs of these mice compared to control
and RB1+/- cells (Fig. 5E). There were significantly more individual clusters of RB1-/- cells per
lung than the other genotypes (Fig. 5F), further suggesting that RB1 loss increased the efficiency
of dissemination or establishment in the lung. Lastly, the percentage of tumor cell area per
cluster of cells is lower in both RB1 mutant genotypes indicating that control cells form rarer,
larger clusters of cells, whereas RB1 mutants tend to seed more efficiently and perhaps
proliferate more slowly (Fig. 5G). We note that one mouse injected with RB1+/- cells showed
extensive dissemination that was highly reminiscent of RB1-/- (SFig. 6A&B). PCR analysis of
tumor material from this mouse confirmed that these cells maintained their RB1+/- genotype, as
the remaining wild type RB1 allele was not lost (SFig. 6C).
These xenograft experiments indicate that RB1 mutations in U2OS cells have little effect
on growth rate of primary tumors. Interestingly, RB1-/- cells are much more efficient in
colonizing recipient mouse lungs, suggesting that in addition to the DNA damage and genome
instability phenotypes described earlier, RB1 loss in RB-pathway deficient cells imparts
characteristics that enable cancer progression.

Discussion
To test if RB1 loss is important in cancer cells that already possess mutations disrupting
the RB-pathway, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create non-functional RB1 alleles. Using gH2AX
staining of cells, we found that even within cells deficient for one copy of RB1, there is an
increase in spontaneous DNA damage. Experiments that probe drug sensitivity of RB1 mutant
cells, along with ChIP-Seq analysis of gH2AX foci and analysis of DNA damage repair
pathways, suggest a complex picture of cellular defects. We did not detect specific hotspots of
DNA damage, but sensitivity to peroxide and cisplatin suggest oxidative damage may cause
sporadic DNA damage as reactive oxygen species are elevated in RB1 deficient cells. Mutant
RB1 cells also have more abnormal mitoses characterized by anaphase bridges, and reporter
assays detect defects in HR repair suggesting another endogenous source of damage. Overall,
this study reveals that RB1 mutations lead to increased DNA damage that may enhance cancer
progression.
The DNA damage phenotype caused by either single copy or homozygous mutation to
RB1 is unlikely to be attributable to a single root cause and we expect that RB1 deficiency may
affect DNA damage in different cancer cells in varied ways. We report that RB1 deletion
compromises HR-repair but not NHEJ and this is consistent with one previous report (VelezCruz et al., 2016), but contradicts another (Cook et al., 2015). Given that we observe more than
80% of U2OS cells incorporating BrdU in a brief pulse, they are likely biased towards HR repair
pathways. This is consistent with gH2AX foci not being accompanied by 53BP1, and the
activity levels of NHEJ reporters being almost an order of magnitude less than HR values,
suggesting that U2OS cells are primed to use the HR repair pathway and thus phenotypes in
these cells reflect this reality. We expect that DNA damage and defective repair described in this

report are relevant to cancer progression phenotypes because graded differences between RB1
wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous genotypes are reflected in 8-oxoguanine abundance,
aneuploidy, and anaphase bridges. This stepwise trend in severity of phenotype is similarly
evident in the behaviour of RB1+/+, RB1+/-, and RB1-/- mutant tail vein xenograft experiments.
Single copy loss of RB1 may contribute to cancer in a number of ways. Primary RB1+/cells from a number of sources are prone to mitotic errors (Coschi et al., 2014; GonzalezVasconcellos et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2002), and precursor lesions to Retinoblastoma are
characterized by aneuploidy (Dimaras et al., 2008), suggesting this is an early step in this
disease. Therefore, partially defective RB1 can contribute to the early stages of cancer through a
distinct set of effects. However, a number of studies have highlighted that RB1 loss is
statistically enriched in advanced stages of cancer progression (Beltran et al., 2016; McNair et
al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2017). In addition, analysis of the landscape of cancer alterations in
TCGA consortia reveals so called ‘shallow deletions’ of RB1 as relatively commonplace (Fig. 6),
and these events are unlikely to be explained by random, unselected events (Beroukhim et al.,
2010). From this perspective, our study offers critical proof of concept that late stage loss of one
copy of RB1 can create cancer enabling phenotypes in the host cell, even if it already possesses
RB-pathway mutations. Complete elimination of RB1 has a stronger effect on DNA damage
phenotypes and dissemination to the lungs, as demonstrated in this study, however, highly
abundant single copy RB1 loss may represent a mutational compromise in which advantageous
phenotypes are acquired with an economy of mutational changes (Davoli et al., 2013).
A number of studies correlate absence of RB expression with improved patient survival
following treatment that includes platinum based chemotherapy (Cecchini et al., 2015; Garsed et
al., 2017). Loss of RB correlated with improved survival of lung adenocarcinomas treated by

Figure 6. The most common RB1 alteration in cancer are shallow deletions. The 10 most
prevalent cancers were analyzed for RB1 gene alterations using TCGA and Pan-Cancer Atlas
data using cBioPortal. A deep deletion is consistent with biallelic loss of RB1, whereas a
shallow deletion is suggestive of heterozygous RB1 deletion, but could be due to stroma
contributions or cancer heterogeneity.

resection and adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin, and a vinca alkaloid (Cecchini et al., 2015). More
recently patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) that experienced exceptionally
good clinical outcomes were studied (Garsed et al., 2017). These patients were treated with
platinum-based agents and loss of RB was associated with long-term survival. From this
perspective, U2OS cells engineered to be deficient for RB1 demonstrate that RB loss increases
sensitivity to cisplatin. Given that RB1 mutant cells were not more sensitive to another agent that
induces DNA breaks, etoposide, we interpret RB1 deficiency to create a unique sensitivity to
cisplatin that may relate to defective HR and higher endogenous ROS levels that create a highly
specific sensitivity to this class of chemotherapy.
In conclusion, although there are many cancers that have mutations in the RB-pathway
that spare the RB1 gene itself, further mutations to RB1 surprisingly create cancer relevant
characteristics that may influence disease progression. The frequency of shallow deletions of
RB1 across many cancers suggests that disease progression may select for these characteristics.

Methods
Cell Culture
U2OS cells and the resulting clones were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL
penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. H460 and H1792 cells and the resulting clones were
grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2
mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37°C in
humidified air containing 5% CO2.
Generation of RB1 deletions using CRISPR
For creation of RB1 deletions, single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting exon 22 of RB1 were
selected by using the CRISPR Design tool at http://crispr.mit.edu/ (Cong et al., 2013). The
sgRNA sequences were as follows: 5’-CACCGTATTATAGTATTCTATAACT-3’ (X22B-top),
5’-AAACAGTTATAGAATACTATAATAC-3’ (X22B-bottom), 5’CACCGAGGATACTTTTGACCTACCC-3’ (X22C-top), 5’AAACGGGTAGGTCAAAAGTATCCTC (X22C-bottom). The X22B and X22C guides were
each cloned into the pX459 plasmid (with wild type Cas9; Addgene #48139) and the pX462
plasmid (with the D10A mutant version of Cas9; Addgene #48141) Both plasmids contain a
puromycin resistance cassette. Cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in a 6-well
dish, and the next day a total of 1 µg per well of a 1:1 mix of X22B and X22C CRISPR plasmids
(either pX459 or pX462) was transfected by use of X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent
(Roche). The next day, each well was replated onto a 15 cm dish, and the day after that cells
were cultured in selection medium with 2 µg/mL of puromycin for 2 days. Following that, cells
were grown in normal cell culture media for approximately 12 days, following which single

colonies were picked from the 15 cm plates using mechanical detachment with a pipette tip and
placed into wells of a 48-well dish and allowed to grow. Cells were further passaged onto larger
plates, and were genotyped using the following primers: X22F primer,
5’-TTACTGTTCTTCCTCAGACATTCAA-3’; and X22R primer, 5’GGATCAAAATAATCCCCCTCTCAT-3’. PCR products (445 bp for the wild type band) were
run in an agarose gel, individual bands were gel purified using a Sigma GenElute Gel Extraction
kit and sent for Sanger sequencing using the X22F and X22R primers shown above. For clones
with multiple PCR products, bands were purified and sent for sequencing separately to determine
individual RB1 alleles in each clone. For alleles that could not easily be resolved by gel
electrophoresis, PCR products were cloned into vectors using either the TOPO TA Cloning Kit
for Sequencing (Invitrogen) or the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Scientific).
The top scoring off-target intragenic locations determined for each gRNA using the
CRISPR Design tool were also sequenced to probe for mutations. gRNA X22B had a potential
off-target site in ZNF699 (X22B_OT_ZNF699_F, 5’-GTGCCCTAAAACACTGAGGGA-3’;
and X22B_OT_ZNF699_R, 5’-TTTATGATCAACAAGGACCAGAGC-3’) while X22C has a
potential off-target site ALDH1L1 (X22C_OT_ALDH1L1_F, 5’GCCACGCTATGCTTGTGATG-3’; and X22C_OT_ALDH1L1_R, 5’CACCCCAGAGAAGGGAACAC -3’). PCR products were gel purified as above and sent for
Sanger sequencing using their respective primers.
Nuclear extracts were prepared from U2OS CRISPR clones of interest and western
blotting was carried out using previously described protocols (Cecchini and Dick, 2011).
Antibodies raised against RB (clone G3-245, BD Pharmingen; C-15, Santa Cruz) and Sp1 (H225, Santa Cruz) were used for western blotting. Samples were western blotted using standard

techniques.
To generate additional RB1 knockout and control cell lines, sgRNAs targeting either exon
2 of RB1 (5’-GGAGAAAGTTTCATCTG-3’) or a gene desert region of the genome (5’TGAGCCTATATTAATTGG-3’) were utilized. The sgRNAs were cloned into the lentiCRISPR
v2 vector (Addgene #52961), which also encodes Cas9. To generate lentivirus, 293T cells were
transfected with the sgRNA vector and a 1:1:1 mixture of lentiviral packaging constructs
(Addgene #12251, #12253, #8454) using polyethylenimine transfection reagent. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, the 293T media was replaced, and recipient cells (U2OS, NCI-H1792,
NCI-H460) were seeded for infection. The following day, media on the recipient cells was
replaced with lentiviral media, and polybrene was added at a final concentration of 8 µg/mL. A
second infection was performed the next day. Infected cells were then selected with 2 µg/mL
puromycin for 3 days. To generate isogenic clones, populations of knockout (or control) cells
were FACS sorted as single cells in 96-well plates (BD FACSAria II) and allowed to grow for
approximately 2 weeks. Colonies were then expanded and screened for loss of RB by
immunoassay using the Simple WesternTM system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Successful knockout clones were also genotyped to confirm clonogenic origin. Genomic DNA
was extracted using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen), and the region
surrounding the cut site was amplified by PCR using the following primers: X2F, 5'TCACAGAAGTGTTTTGCTGCTT-3'; X2R, 5’-TTTGGTGGGAGGCATTTATGGA-3’. PCR
products were purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research) and sent for
sequencing.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Cells grown either on glass coverslips or in glass bottom plates were fixed in phosphate-buffered

saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with PBS0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were blocked in blocking
buffer (PBS-0.3% Triton X-100 with either 5% donkey or goat serum depending on the species
in which the secondary antibodies were raised) for at least 1 h at room temperature. Cells were
then incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h or at 4°C
overnight. Antibodies raised against RB (clone G3-245, BD Pharmingen), gH2AX (clone
JBW301, EMD Millipore), 53BP1 (H-300, Santa Cruz) and BLM (C-18, Santa Cruz) were used
for IF. After 3 washes with PBS-0.3% Triton X-100, cells were incubated with secondary
antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with
PBS-0.3% Triton X-100, incubated with 100 ng/mL 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in
PBS-0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed twice more with PBS-0.3% Triton X-100 and then
washed once with PBS before mounting with Slowfade Gold Antifade mountant (S36936,
ThermoFisher Scientific).
For 8-oxoG staining, cells were fixed and blocked as above, then washed with PBS-0.3%
Triton X-100 and incubated in RNase solution (0.2 mg/mL RNase A, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
15 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed
with PBS-0.3% Triton X-100 and then incubated in 2 M HCl for 10 min at room temperature,
followed by a rinse with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cells were washed with PBS-0.3% Triton X100, and then primary antibody incubation, using α-DNA/RNA Damage antibody raised against
8-oxoG (clone 15A3, ab62623, Abcam) and all subsequent steps were completed as above.
For confocal microscopy of RB, gH2AX and BLM, cells were examined on an Olympus
Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope system. For confocal microscopy of 53BP1, a Nikon
A1R confocal microscope was used. For non-confocal microscopy, images were acquired using a

Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope and Spot flex camera. Foci were quantified using the Focinator
(Oeck et al., 2015), while overall staining intensity in cells was quantified by ImageJ (Schneider
et al., 2012).
Gamma irradiation of cells
Cells subjected to gIR were plated at 100,000 cells per well in 6 well dishes with glass coverslips
on the bottom. The next day, cells were exposed to a cobalt 60 source until a dose of 2 Gy was
received. Cells were placed back in the cell culture incubator until the appropriate time point
after treatment to fix cells for IF.
NHEJ and HR repair assays
For the HR repair assay, pDRGFP was used which was a gift from Maria Jasin (Addgene
plasmid #26475; http://n2t.net/addgene:26475; RRID:Addgene_26475) and for the NHEJ assay,
pimEJ5GFP was used which was a gift from Jeremy Stark (Addgene plasmid #44026;
http://n2t.net/addgene:44026 ; RRID:Addgene_44026). pDRGFP was linearized using EcoRV
and pimEJ5GFP was linearized using XhoI. These linearized fragments were then individually
used for transfection using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) into U2OS
cells. The next day, each well was replated onto a 10 cm dish, and a day later, cells were cultured
in selection medium with 2 µg/mL of puromycin for 3 days. To isolate single cell colonies,
limiting dilutions were then used to seed cells into 96 well plates. After approximately 3 weeks,
wells with growth from single cell isolates were transferred to single wells of 12 well plates and
after a few days were treated with puromycin again to ensure the selected clones did still contain
either the NHEJ or HR constructs.
To determine the reporter efficiency in the isolated clones, 2 sets of transfections were
performed per clone, again using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). For the

first set of transfections, each clone was transfected with a plasmid expressing the I-SceI
endonuclease, pCBASceI, which was a gift from Maria Jasin (Addgene plasmid #26477;
http://n2t.net/addgene:26477; RRID:Addgene 26477), and a blasticidin marker, pMSCVBlasticidin, which was a gift from David Mu (Addgene plasmid #75085 ;
http://n2t.net/addgene:75085; RRID:Addgene_75085). The second set of transfections was with
an empty backbone plasmid, pCAG-FALSE, which was a gift from Wilson Wong (Addgene
plasmid #89689; http://n2t.net/addgene:89689; RRID:Addgene_89689) and pMSCV-Blasticidin.
For both of these transfections, the blasticidin resistance plasmid was used in a 1:3 ratio with the
complementary plasmid. The next day, each well was replated onto a 10 cm dish, and the day
after that cells were cultured in selection medium with 10 µg/mL of blasticidin for 1 week. GFP
positive cells were then quantified by flow cytometric analysis (FACS). To prepare cells for
FACS, they were washed with PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in culture media, and washed twice
with PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 mL of flow cytometry staining buffer with
propidium iodide (0.05% sodium azide and 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS with 0.01 mg/mL propidium
iodide). For each reporter construct, the clone with the highest ratio of GFP signal when
transfected with pCBASceI to GFP signal when transfected with pCAG-FALSE was selected for
future studies.
To introduce CRISPR constructs into selected clones for each repair reporter, lentivirus
particles were generated in HEK293T cells. Lentivirus was created for both lentiCRISPR v2 with
no guide RNA inserted, and for lentiCRISPR v2 with the X22B sgRNA sequences for RB1 (from
above) inserted. lentiCRISPR v2 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #52961;
http://n2t.net/addgene:52961; RRID:Addgene_52961). The X22B RB1 guide sequences were
inserted into the lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid as previously described (Sanjana et al., 2014; Shalem

et al., 2014). Culture media containing lentiviral particles were transferred to appropriate U2OS
HR and NHEJ reporter clones for 48 hours, followed by selection with 4 µg/mL puromycin for at
least 5 days.
U2OS HR and NHEJ reporter clones that were infected with lentiCRISPR v2 plasmids,
either with or without the RB1 guide, were then transfected with both pCBASceI and pMSCVBlasticidin or pCAG-FALSE and pMSCV-Blasticidin and selected, as above, and analyzed by
FACS to determine repair efficiency. Cells grown in parallel to the transfected cells were used to
prepare nuclear extracts for western blotting.
Determination of IC50 concentrations
For IC50 assays, cells were seeded at a density of 12,000 cells per well in 96 well dishes.
Twenty-four hours after plating cells, media was replaced with media containing the drugs of
interest at the appropriate concentrations. Technical triplicates were analyzed for each biological
replicate. Serial dilutions of stock solutions of aphidicolin (APH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
etoposide, hydroxyurea (HU) and cisplatin were created so that a constant amount of drug was
added to the media for each drug concentration used. After 72 h, alamarBlue was added to an
amount equal to 10% of the volume in the well (i.e. 10 µL per well with 100 µL of media and
drug). After 4 h of incubation, cytotoxicity was measured using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Reader
(BioTek, USA) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 560 nm/590 nm. Values were corrected
using a blank of media and alamarBlue only. The amount of fluorescence of alamarBlue for each
well of drug treated cells was then normalized to the fluorescence value obtained for the
untreated cells of the same technical replicate. These normalized fluorescence values relative to
untreated cells were then analyzed using Prism. The drug concentrations were log transformed

response (three parameters)). IC50 values were obtained from the best fit values, and IC50
values from three biological replicates were compared using Ordinary one-way ANOVA and
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
ChIP-sequence
ChIP was conducted according to protocols adapted from Cecchini et al. (Cecchini et al., 2014).
Briefly, cross-linked chromatin was sonicated so most chromatin was ≤400 bp. Sheared
chromatin was then normalized between experimental groups and pre-cleared with protein G
Dynabeads and IgG. Pre-cleared chromatin was then incubated with protein G Dynabeads and
ChIP antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins. Antibodies raised against gH2AX (clone
JBW301, EMD Millipore) and H4 (clone 62-141-13, EMD Millipore) were used for ChIP.
Cross-links were reversed at 65°C, and samples were treated with RNase and proteinase K. DNA
was isolated for library preparation, and 20 replicates per genotype for gH2AX ChIP-Seq were
pooled to achieve DNA yield required for library preparation (NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library
Prep Kit). ChIP libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq (High output 75 cycle kit),
and processed reads are deposited in GEO (GSE125379).
Resulting FASTQ reads were aligned to the human genome build hg19 using Bowtie2
version 2.3.0 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). The following command was used: bowtie2 -t -p 4
-D 15 -R 2 -L 32 -i S,1,0.75 -x hg19 -U <reads>.fastq -S <output>.sam. Peaks were identified
using MACS2 version macs2 2.1.1.20160309 according to parameters stated below and the
options to detect broad peak distributions for histone marks (Zhang et al., 2008). For H4 ChIPSeq, the corresponding inputs were used as the control and for gH2AX ChIP-Seq, the first input
replicate was used as the control. The following command was used: macs2 callpeak -t
<ChIP>.bam -c <input>.bam -n <output> --outdir ./macs2/ -g hs --broad --broad-cutoff 0.1.

To find abundance of ChIP-Seq reads in common fragile sites (CFS), the cytogenetically
determined locations of CFS, as determined previously by Lukusa and Fryns (2008), were
converted to human genomic coordinates (hg19) using the UCSC Genome Browser (Lukusa and
Fryns, 2008; Tyner et al., 2017). Bedtools coverage was then used to find the number of
alignments for each ChIP-Seq sample within the individual CFS (Quinlan, 2014). The abundance
of reads that mapped to CFS were then converted to proportions by dividing by the total number
of mapped reads. The proportion data were further normalized against input control and then
ratios were made comparing the mutant proportions to the wild type proportions. A two-tailed
one-sample t-test was performed to test if the normalized mean read count proportions of the
RB1+/- and the RB1-/- ChIP-Seq assays at each of the CFS is equal to the normalized read count
proportion of the corresponding CFS from the wild type control. A multi-test correction was
applied to the calculated P-values (using "fdr" method from "p.adjust" function in R). Statistical
analysis of sequence data was performed using R (version 3.4.2) and the plotting function used
was lattice (v0.20-35).
For repeat analysis, another set of alignments were performed. For this analysis, reads
were mapped using Bowtie version 1.2.1.1 with high stringency to the hg19 genome (Langmead
et al., 2009). The following command was used: bowtie -S --best -m 1 --chunkmbs 500 -p 4 -t -un <not_aligned_unique> --max <multiple_reads_unique> hg19 <reads>.fastq <output>.sam.
All remaining reads were mapped to repeat containing indexes using previously reported
methods (Day et al., 2010), with indices also being derived from Repbase and Tandem Repeats
Databases (Bao et al., 2015; Gelfand et al., 2007). For these remaining repeat alignments, the –m
1 parameter of the Bowtie mapping was changed to –k 1. Finally, all remaining reads were remapped to hg19 at low stringency to exhaustively match sequence tags to the mouse genome.

The abundance of sequence tags that mapped to non-unique regions of the genome were
compared by using log2 ratios of γH2AX precipitable tags per million mapped reads in mutant
versus wild type and converted into heat maps using matrix2png (Pavlidis and Noble, 2003). To
test for significance of enrichment of reads mapped to various repeat categories, the same
analysis to test for significance within CFS was used (see above).
Flow Cytometry
Cells were plated on 6 cm plates at a density of 100,000 cells per plate. Approximately 24 h
after, cells were pulsed with BrdU for a duration of 30 min. Cell cycle analysis was then carried
out as previously described (Cecchini et al., 2012).
Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species
Cells were plated in 96 well plates at a density of 12,000 cells per well in DMEM without phenol
red (31053-028, ThermoFisher Scientific). H2O2 or cisplatin were added 24 h after seeding cells.
Seventy-two hours later, 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxyH2DCFDA; CA-DCF-DA; (C400, ThermoFisher Scientific)) at a stock concentration of 20 mM
in DMSO was diluted in DMEM without phenol red to a concentration of 40 µM. This master
mix of media and CA-DCF-DA was added directly to the wells already containing media and the
drug of interest, to obtain a final concentration of 20 µM CA-DCF-DA. The cells were then put
in the incubator for 45 min and readings were obtained using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Reader
(BioTek, USA) using excitation/emission wavelengths of 492 nm/525 nm. Technical triplicates
were analyzed for each biological replicate and the average background readings (cells treated
with the highest concentration of the drug of interest for 72 h and DMSO in place of CA-DCFDA) from each cell line were subtracted from the average of each treatment reading for analysis
of fluorescence.

Mouse xenografts
U2OS clones were grown in cell culture to approximately 80% confluence. Cells were
washed with PBS, trypsinized, centrifuged and washed 3 times with Hanks’ Balanced Salt
Solution (HBSS, 1X). Cells were then resuspended in HBSS at a concentration of 5x106 cells/mL
so that 200 µL contained the 1x106 cells required for each injection.
For subcutaneous injections, mice were approximately 8 weeks old and for the tail vein
injections mice were approximately 13 weeks old when injected. All mice were given at least 3
days to acclimatize. All mice were female NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (stock number
005557, The Jackson Laboratory) and were housed and handled as approved by the Canadian
Council on Animal Care, under an approved protocol (2016-068).
For subcutaneous injections, 1x106 RB1+/+ cells were injected into the left flank of all
mice, and 1x106 RB1+/- or RB1-/- cells were injected into the right flank. The mice used for the
subcutaneous injections were euthanized approximately 8 weeks after injection. Necropsies were
performed and tumor mass was determined. Tumors were then fixed in formalin for 48 hr and
processed for histological assessment.
For tail vein injections, 1 x 106 cells were injected into the lateral tail vein. Mice were
euthanized 8 weeks after tail vein injection. All animals were subjected to a thorough necropsy
and all lungs as well as any abnormal tissues or organs were fixed in formalin for 48 hr and
processed for histological assessment.
All tissues of interest from both studies were embedded, sectioned and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin according to standard methods. Slides were imaged using an Aperio
ScanScope slide scanner (Leica Biosystems).

For quantitative pathology of lungs from tail vein injected mice, images were analyzed
using QuPath (Bankhead et al., 2017). Briefly, annotations were drawn around each individual
lung. Within these annotated lungs, cells were detected using the cell detection command. The
features within these cells were then smoothed by using the add smoothed features command
(using 25 µm as the radius). Within the lungs, regions containing different cell types were
annotated and these annotations were used to train a cell classifier. All possible 67 cell features
were used to the build the random trees classifier, using default parameters. A script was then
made to determine the total cell area of all cell types called by the classifier within each lung,
and the percentages of tumor cell area was calculated from these values. Tumor cell clusters
were manually counted using the cell types determined by the classifier; anything thought to
have derived from a single cell seeding event was considered a tumor cell cluster.
To determine the RB1 genotype of seeded U2OS cells of interest, embedded mouse lung
tissue was deparaffinized, lysed, formalin crosslinks were reversed, and DNA was isolated
according to manufacturer’s instructions (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, Qiagen). DNA was
genotyped as above using PCR using genotyping primers (X22F and X22R).
Data extraction from cBioPortal
Only TCGA studies used for the Pan-Cancer Atlas with 150 samples or more on cBioPortal were
selected to query (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013). Data from cBioPortal was obtained in
January 2019. Mutation and CNA data was analyzed, with the gene set user-defined list being
entered as “RB1: AMP HOMDEL HETLOSS mut”.

Supplemental Figure 1. Strategy to generate RB1 mutant U2OS cells. (A) Schematic
depicting the relative locations of gRNA pairs (denoted as B and C) used in this study in relation
to exon 22 coding sequence. The locations of flanking primers used to detect deletions are
represented as arrows. Hypothetical heterozygous and homozygous RB1 mutant gene structures
containing deletions of exon 22 that are expected following transfection of gRNA and Cas9
encoding plasmids are shown. (B) An ethidium bromide stained, agarose gel shows examples of
wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant RB1 genotypes that are detected by PCR
amplification of exon 22 sequences. (C) A representative western blot showing pRB expression
in control, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant cells is shown on top. SP1 loading control is
shown on the bottom. (D) Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect RB expression in
cultures of control, heterozygous, or homozygous mutants (shown in green). Cells were
counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei (blue). (E) Table summarizing the characterization
of the U2OS RB1 mutant clones used in this study. Genotypes were determined by PCR and
sequencing, and amino acid coding changes were predicted based on nucleotide sequences. The
top scoring off-target intragenic locations determined for each gRNA, ZNF699 for X22B and
ALDH1L1 for X22C, were also sequenced to probe for unwanted mutations. ND=not
determined.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. (B) Same experiment as in A, but using H460 cancer cells. (C) As in
A, except with H1792 non-small cell lung cancer cells. All error bars are +1 SEM. *P < 0.05.

Supplemental Figure 3. RB1 mutant cells are not more sensitive to the direct induction of
DNA breaks. (A) Aphidicolin and (B) etoposide were added to cultures of the indicated
genotypes of cells. Viability was assessed after 72 h using alamarBlue and dose response curves
were used to calculate IC50 values for each genotype. There are no differences between
genotypes (as determined by one-way ANOVA). (C) 53BP1 foci were quantitated for each RB1
genotype using the Focinator as with γH2AX. No significant differences were observed as
determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. At least 120 cells from one U2OS clone were
analyzed for each RB1 genotype. All error bars are ±1 SEM.

Supplemental Figure 4. gH2AX ChIP-Seq read proportions in RB1 mutants at CFS
compared to wild type. Aligned gH2AX ChIP-Seq read proportions within common fragile sites
(CFS) were first normalized to their respective inputs, and then RB1+/- and RB1-/- proportions
were normalized to wild type and log2 transformed. A two-tailed one-sample t-test was
performed to determine if the normalized mean read count proportions of the RB1 mutants at the
various CFS is equal to the normalized read count proportion of the corresponding CFS in the
wild type. The dots in the middle of each segment are the mean values of the normalized, log2
transformed RB1 mutant proportions and data are color-coded according to their FDR multi-test
