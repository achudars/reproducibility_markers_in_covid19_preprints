Abstract

23

This article analyses historical data from observations made to birds in breeding,

24

throughout two routes with urban characteristics and during a consecutive period of 10 years

25

(2009-2018), following a precise methodology designed by the North American Breeding Bird

26

Survey. The analyzed routes are officially registered in the Mexican Commission for

27

Biodiversity’s Knowledge and Use, the United States Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife

28

Research Center, and the Canadian Wildlife Service Research Centre. The observations were made

29

by citizens without formal professional education; hence the results may be considered within the

30

framework of citizen science. Their contributions provided important data for decision-making

31

regarding environmental issues, since the presence of birds is considered one of the main indicators

32

on health conditions of an ecosystem. Data analysis identified two basic conditions: (i) a reduction

33

of the 23% in the number of species found, as many of them disappeared during counting; and (ii)

34

the significant increase in population of other species, three of pigeons among them. Apart from

35

the study of bird behavior in the routes with urban characteristics, the article acknowledges the

36

lack of connection and use of the information produced from monitoring for decision-making and

37

education regarding environmental issues. Therefore, we consider crucial to create scientific

38

observatories, both available to experts in the field and to the general population, as the ultimate

39

purpose would be the production of citizen science.

1. Introduction

42

Birdwatching is an activity where a person or a group of people on their own get organized

43

to identify wild or feral birds that live in a specific environment. The main characteristics for the

process of birdwatching are: (i) it can be performed by amateurs or experts; (ii) in general, it does

45

not require specialized or scientific training; and (iii) it can be initiated with a relatively small

46

financial investment.

47

In order to correctly conduct this type of process, bird watchers make sure to interact the

48

least possible with the fauna and the sighting places, restricting themselves to exclusively register

49

their observations with photographs, videos, audios and notes, and they may also use simple

50

manuals and guides [1]. While watchers develop greater experience, they might need some tools

51

that allow them to conduct observations in a more systematic way and get more evidence from

52

them. Among the main tools used, there are binoculars, cameras that include lenses of 300

53

millimeters at least, and specialized guides [2].

54

For the case of this investigation, the study was conducted in the city of Chihuahua, capital

55

of the state of Chihuahua to the north of Mexico, neighboring with the United States. In the local

56

environment, the most experienced bird watchers carry out the functions of training and leading

57

amateur observers, and they perform several activities regarding education and training, such as

58

courses for the identification of birds, collective photographical expositions, and training. Also,

59

those who have experience in falconry, rehabilitate birds of prey at the request of the Federal

60

Government of Mexico, through the Federal Government's Environmental Protection Agency [3].

61

In addition to the members of this investigation, there is a well-known group in the city of

62

Chihuahua: ‘Colectivo de Aves’ (Bird Collective), which conducts different cultural and

63

ecological activities [4], and some members of this group have been trained and certified in

64

monitoring and birdwatching by the Mexican Commission for Biodiversity’s Knowledge and Use

65

(CONABIO) [5], the United States Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center [6] and

66

the Canadian Wildlife Service Research [7].

Although there are limited supporting options for developing activities related to

68

environmental issues in Mexico, it is important to point out that many of these activities emerge

69

from voluntary initiatives. In the particular case of those participating in the observation and

70

supervision of birds, they conduct these activities because of the esthetic satisfaction they find in

71

them and because of a personal interest, given the interaction with the birds, the environment and

72

other participants. Beyond this, there are some strategies for the conservation and usage of the

73

species observed, as well as for the knowledge of the environmental impact of the anthropogenic

74

activities in the local, regional and global level [8].

75
76

1.1.

Urban infrastructure and bird observation

77

In the context of the education for the sustainability of life, birdwatching activities require

78

the participation of people who learn and get involved with topics related to the avian life that

79

coexist in their contexts, which leads to promote several elements to improve the environment,

80

such as encouraging the conservation of species and improving cities accordingly, as they should

81

also be suitable habitats for other living beings [9]. These remarks on urban infrastructure and

82

human activities also include other points of view related to humans and their relationship with

83

birds, such as the habit of feeding them and giving them shelter [10]; and providing citizens with

84

tips for their diet and care [11].

85

It is not necessary to be an expert in the natural sciences to observe birds. Many of the

86

people who do it are retired, kids or people whose professional life is not connected with this field,

87

such as doctors, architects, chemists, engineers, entrepreneurs and geographers [12]. However,

88

some people involved in these groups have enough technical training and knowledge to perform

89

such activities, which are based on a scientific methology for monitoring regular routes, annually

and periodically, to report the influence of birds in a specific location [13]. An example of this is

91

the Sitio Ramsar Vado de Meoqui, a town located in the state of Chihuahua, which is considered

92

a protected area under an international environmental agreement that enforces the conservation

93

and rational use of the wetlands through local, regional and national actions for contributing to

94

sustainable development in the world [14]. These are transcendental remarks, since the mentioned

95

town is located within an urban area, which has a record of serious damages in its ecology, due to

96

inappropriate urban planning and human activities that produce waste and contamination [15].

97

In the context of a primarily urban modern society, 74.2% of the Mexican population lives

98

in cities of more than 15 thousand inhabitants [16]. Under such conditions, it is compulsory to

99

raise awareness and to re-educate people regarding sustainable development, by carrying out

100

activities such as the systematic and participative observation of the ecological dynamics in

101

populations such as birds.

102

Within the actions based on systematic methodologies for birdwatching, it is expected that

103

observers who start these activities as a pastime, to eventually perform them in a more constant

104

and formal way. An example of this is quoted in the report that documents the observation of birds

105

as a serious proposal for the environmental education to teachers and students in the protected

106

natural areas of the Parque Natural Municipal de Saltos Küpper and the Reserva Privada de Vida

107

Silvestre Virgen de Paticuá of the town Eldorado, Colombia, where bird data collection were

108

carried out with the support of common citizens [17]. This example is important because Colombia

109

has the largest diversity of birds in the world, and it has a great ornithological tradition, although

110

birdwatching as a pastime is a recent activity [18].

111

Guayaquil city (Ecuador) has another experience with a different approach, but related to

112

birdwatching, education, ethics and cultural coexistence in urban areas. In this city, 130 species of

birds were identified in a study conducted during 20 months, which also contributed to the building

114

of pathways, tourist facilities, rest areas, viewpoints, piers, as well as accessible infrastructure,

115

lightning and parking lots [19].

116

In the literature review, we identified several birdwatching projects in urban and semi

117

urban areas under different modalities and dimensions; such as those associating ethics with birds,

118

peoples and cultures, as well as the observation and reflection upon birds’ ecological and cultural

119

aspects [20]. Other studies were conducted on a single species, by analyzing distribution models

120

that employ satellite tracking software and observation through computing platforms [21].

121

The study and tracking of birds in urban and semi urban environments have become more

122

popular activities for different reasons, such as the closeness of the observation sites to the

123

watchers’ homes [22], the opportunity to become familiar with the species of the area and

124

identifying their main characteristics [23]; and learning about the urban features and their influence

125

in birds’ behavior, for instance in desert environments [24].

126

Sometimes, birdwatching is conducted in semi urban areas, which are under some sort of

127

special surveillance, such as government installations or inside educational institutions. The

128

experiences identified in Latin America are: (i) inside the college campus ‘El Cerillo’ in

129

Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, which reported 141 species [25]; (ii) at Universidad

130

del Amazonas in Colombia, which reported 62 species [26]; (iii) at Universidad de Asunción

131

(Paraguay), with 77 species [27]; (iv) at Universidad de El Salvador, with 64 species [28]; and (v)

132

36 species reported in Centro Regional Universitario de Colón (Panama) [29]. Some of these cases

133

have studied the collisions of birds into windows, which is considered an important aspect, because

134

a great number of birds die for this reason [30].

135

Another important feature of birdwatching is their bond with the tourist activity, for

136

instance, this type of activity in Cuba has gone from an initial extractive approach to a relatively

137

innocuous activity for birds, and it has turned into an important economic activity; however, this

138

country does not have a record of the impact caused by tourism to birdwatching [31]. In the state

139

of Oaxaca (Mexico), birdwatching is an ecotouristim activity offered by people or companies to

140

tourists mainly from the United States and Canada [32]. As a result, the development of formal

141

training programs for touristic guides has been proposed, for making such activities

142

environmentally sustainable [33].

143

In Mexico, there are governmental institutions that work in a methodic way in the

144

observation of birds, such as the Commission for Biodiversity’s Knowledge and Use (CONABIO)

145

[5], which fosters birdwatching and the funding for the people involved in it. The data gathered in

146

the monitoring activities supported by CONABIO allow identifying the density of birds’

147

population and health indicators of the ecosystems, such as the rise or fall on the number of

148

individuals for a specific species, and also detecting environmental alteration elements, such as

149

droughts or groundwater depletion, harmful fertilizers, and the commerce or illegal trade of species

150

[34]. In Mexico, birdwatching was recently included in a legal environmental study related to the

151

constructions of the new airport in Mexico City, as the presence of 131 species was reported in the

152

construction area, which might have an influence in plane crashes [35].

153

In the particular case of the state of Chihuahua, the scenario of the present study, we

154

identified the following studies: (i) in the Ramsar zone known as ‘Vado de Meoqui’ in the riverbed

155

of Río San Pedro [36]; (ii) the identification of 30 species of birds through a study of variability

156

about the frequency of sighting of seabirds, in relation to the months of year [13]; (iii) the

157

observation of species of little frequency through 36 points of observation [37]; and (iv) the

observation of birds through the presence of nests and hatchings of the American avocet

159

(Recurvirostra americana), which was considered a species present in the area as a result of

160

migration and not permanent, e.g. not born in Chihuahua [38].

161
162

2. Materials and Methods

163

This research was based on birdwatching data gathered during 10 continuous years (2009-

164

2018) in two semi urban routes of observation located in the state of Chihuahua: La Regina (code

165

058) and Santa Mónica (code 059). These routes are registered by CONABIO, the United States

166

Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, and the Canadian Wildlife Service

167

Research.

168

Each route is 40 kilometers long and they consist of 50 monitoring stops every 800 meters.

169

Both routes pass through one urban area and another semi urban area, thus they are habitats that

170

are directly influenced by human activities, such as dwellings, agricultural and familiar vehicles,

171

parks, gardens, croplands, and irrigation ditches. La Regina is the most affected by land use

172

change. Figure 1 shows the routes in the map with their 50 monitoring stops, which were mapped

173

by using their coordinates.

174
175

176
177

The beginning of each record in the routes was established between 5:00 and 5:30 am, and

178

the monitoring points were marked with a physical description and their GPS coordinates. Also, it

179

is common to place signals and visible marks for an easy identification of the stops every year.

180

Before, during, and at the end of each tracking, the climatological conditions (temperature, wind

speed, and cloudiness) are recorded. The monitoring was made every year within the period of

182

May-July, when the breeding season starts and migratory species have already travelled to their

183

nesting places.

184

The protocol for marking the routes consisted of establishing 50 points of observation

185

separated from each other every 800 meters and geographically located by their physical

186

description and GPS coordinates. At each point, a chronometer was used to measure a period of

187

three minutes and an approximate radius of 400 meters was monitored to record all the bird species

188

observed and heard. This protocol was repeated annually, starting in the same point and at the

189

same hour, to maintain uniformity in sampling conditions.

190
191

3. Analysis of the results

192

The descriptive analysis of the species found was made from global data of both routes

193

observed, with its corresponding correlations; using tables and graphics by route, which show the

194

increase and decrease of species, as well as an analysis by number of species. During the 10-year

195

period, a total of 139 species were identified and observed in both routes, Table 1 compiles species

196

common names in English, their scientific names, and the longitudinal behavior from 2009 to

197

2018, with the corresponding total of sightings per species.

From the data shown in Table 1, it was possible to graphically represent species’ behavior

202

in both routes. Hence, Figure 2 shows a continuous increase in the total observations, except for

203

the years 2010 and 2016; a period in which the results were more representative in terms of growth.

Figure 3 shows the corresponding dispersion. The data exhibit a rising behavior as the years
pass by.

The Pearson correlation, taking into account both routes and between the variables ‘year’

213

and ‘total sightings’, was of r=.569. This indicates a low correlation level. However, the

214

significance was of .009, which corresponds to a high significance (see Table 2).

At the moment of analyzing the data by route, we observed a similar behavior regarding
the increase of the total number of sightings per year (see Figure 4).

When correlating the variables of total sightings against year, La Regina route shows a Sig.

223

of .001, with a correlation coefficient r=.869 (very high) and for Santa Mónica, Sig. is .013 and its

224

correlation coefficient is of r=.748 (high). These data are shown in Table 3.

3.1.

Increase and decrease of species during the evaluated period

230

The significance and the correlation analysis conducted among each year and with all the

231

species, presented significant relations with 30 species. Table 4 shows the behavior of the species

232

divided by route. In the cases where the correlation value is negative, it means that species

233

decreased in their numbers and vice versa.

234

Although there are species that underwent relevant changes in only one of the routes, in

235

the majority of the cases such changes happened in both routes. The species whose common names

236

in English show a ‘*’ at the beginning indicate that they were identified in the monitoring, but they

237

were not included in the initial observation lists. Such treatment is maintained throughout this

238

paper.

Species that decreased in numbers

249

In this section, we present the analysis of the changes in the sightings of species, starting

250

with the ones that shown a dramatic decrease in their numbers, according to the Pearson correlation

251

coefficient and significance.

252
253

Species: Common ground dove (Columbina passerina)

254

Link: https://www.naturalista.mx/taxa/3545-Columbina-passerina

255

Condition: This species might have moved some years from the zone of Parque Nacional Big

256

Bend. From 2015, it was not observed anymore (see Figure 5).

Link: https://ebird.org/species/rugdov

263

Condition: This species of pigeon is not common in this zone, and it only showed up from 2009

264

to 2013. Normally, this bird has a permanent presence in coast areas (see Figure 6).

265

Species: Cassin's sparrow (Peucaea cassinii)

269

Link: https://ebird.org/species/casspa?siteLanguage=ht_HT

270

Condition: This bird was not seen anymore since 2017, perhaps because of climate change;

271

emigrating before time to their locations for their summer stays.

Species: Rufous crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps)

276

Link: https://ebird.org/species/rucspa

277

Condition: This species of sparrow prevails in the mountains. There is an adjacent mountain range

278

called ‘Sierra de Orinda’, which may provide shelter for this bird. After 2013, it did not show up

279

anymore.

285

Condition: It shown a similar behavior to the previous species, and not many individuals were

286

observed from 2014 to 2017 (except for two). The monitoring routes studied correspond to their

287

breeding areas. The presence of cattle in the monitoring routes may be an element of their behavior

288

in the observations.

Species: Common pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis)

300

Link: https://ebird.org/species/compau

301

Condition: This bird is from coast areas. Hence, it is not common in this zone, but some

302

individuals were observed, perhaps because they were moving between coasts. Similar to the

303

species described above, they were not seen after 2013.

Species: Northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis)

314

Link: https://ebird.org/species/norcar

315

Condition: The count of this species have significantly dropped, though at least some of them

316

have been observed during the period. Nevertheless, their numbers have been decreasing, possibly

317

because they have changed their nesting areas. It is a very desired bird by illegal traffickers.

Species that increased in numbers

336

This section includes the analysis of three groups of species: pigeons, sparrows, hawfinch,

337

and three isolated species, which had an increase in their numbers. In the case of the pigeons, four

338

types of species were identified and their increase are summarized in Figure 16.

According to the above results, it is not possible to clearly appreciate the increase of the

355

*Eurasian Collared Dove species, as it is an invasive species. Therefore, it requires special

356

attention, because the increase in their numbers produces a displacement of native species (see

357

Figure 17).

According to the data gathered of the four pigeon species, a correlation analysis was carried

362

out to identify significance and correlation values in all the cases, as Table 6 shows, where the

363

correlations of these species indicate mutual protection, which means that their numbers increase

364

together.

Regarding the sparrow species, they are coming closer and are identified more frequently

369

in urban and semi urban areas, as they might be escaping from their natural predators, and they are

370

feeding from the amount of waste produced in the cities, parks and gardens. The three species of

371

sparrows that increased are (see Figure 18):

The observations of the two species of hawfinch that increased were characterized by

385

similar foraging habits and distributions. These are associated to areas with urban trees, such as

386

the mulberry tree. Figure 19 shows the two hawfinch species that increased their numbers.

Condition: This species has currently increased, probably due to the presence of insects coming

408

from the agricultural activities within the monitoring areas (see Figure 21).

Analysis by number of species

420

In this study, the total number of species observed, during the evaluated period of 2009-

421

2018 and in both routes, showed a global decrease from 99 to 76 species (23.33%). Figure 23

422

shows the yearly decrease of species for both routes.

425
426

During 2009, the first year of monitoring, 76 different species were observed in Santa

427

Monica route, and there was a progressive reduction until 58 species were observed during 2018

428

(23.6% decrease). In La Regina route, the observations during the same period of time resulted in

a reduction from 91 to 70 species, which represented an almost identical reduction in percentage:

Other findings from observations

435

The results included in this section are relevant for monitoring, because they may be useful

436

for birdwatchers, in the sense that they communicate the ideal conditions in which the studied

437

species can be found in the region. Such conditions were drawn from correlations between species

438

and climatological conditions (see Table 7).

4. Discussion and conclusions

443

According to the results, new species in the area were identified in the monitoring (Rufous-

444

crowned sparrow, Ruddy-ground dove and Common-ground dove), which are out of their

445

migratory routes; a condition that are attributed to changes in their usual routes and of the

446

climatological conditions, which force them to seek alternative routes. Different species observed

447

were only present during some years and their presence was not registered again. Changes in their

448

migration routes puts some species in several risks, both at rural as in urban environments, mainly

449

due to the presence of different predators.

450

The Aztec rail species, of which some sightings were reported since 2009, drew the

451

attention of national and international ornithologists, because they were previously observed at the

452

center of Mexico (very far from Chihuahua). This Mexican species is in danger of extinction,

453

according to the Mexican Official Standard 059 from the Secretariat of the Environment and

454

Natural Resources [39].

455

The frequency of sightings has increased for some species thanks to the insects linked with

456

agricultural activities within the area. Invasive species like the Eurasian collared-dove and the

457

European starling have notoriously increased their populations, which cause the displacement of

458

native species.

459

Some positive activities have been accomplished in the monitoring routes, such as the

460

reintegration of native species. This has turned out to be beneficial to some species, such as the

461

Verdin, which is regaining its population. In fact, a change in the counting of different species

462

between the years 2013-2014 was observed. The species whose numbers dropped or that

463

disappeared during the monitoring period have similar habits related with meadows or lower lands.

464

Conversely, the species that have increased their numbers seem to have the tendency to fly or

465

remain in higher areas.

466

We can pose the following hypotheses regarding the decrease in numbers: the

467

indiscriminate use of agrochemicals without performing environmental evaluations may

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/704676; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

468

negatively affect bird numbers; this has been documented in news outlets [40]; and the area is

469

notably studied because of reports about contamination with high levels of arsenic and fluorine

470

[41]. This information has been constantly checked by the local media for being connected to high

471

rates of cancer in the inhabitants of the region [42].

472

The data and information provided by birdwatching which supported this research is

473

important for decision-making regarding environmental issues, although there is no evidence of

474

such use at a local, regional or even national level. There is a need for spreading and

475

communicating results of the kind discussed in this article. We argue that such a need is imperative,

476

due to the variations in the sightings of species, which evidence the decrease and increase of certain

477

species and may lead to environmental concerns; these are issues that should be part of an

478

educational program for everyone within the region [43].

479

Formal education about environmental issues provides the opportunity to connect the

480

traditional knowledge of communities (holders of a profound knowledge about environmental

481

surroundings) and scientific knowledge, for which universities may act as intermediaries.

482

Activities related to the environment and the results provided by this research may help to expand

483

the global-local roles in the ecosystem processes of nature and species’ migratory movements, as

484

well as alleviating the human and socio-environmental issues that currently affect us.

485

The existence of dissemination processes for such kinds of results and the creation of

486

formal and informal educational programs are important to raise awareness about the environment

487

and work toward improving it and making it more sustainable. Moreover, we propose that we need

488

to go beyond, as two fundamental necessities have to be addressed: a) the creation of scientific

489

observatories, as publicly accessible systems to retrieve environmental and ecological data and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/704676; this version posted July 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

29
490

information; and, as a result b) defining mechanisms for promoting the generation of citizen

491

science, with the participation of both scientists and the civil society.

492

The extensive data used in this research, which is already recorded, can be considered as a

493

starting point to implement a scientific observatory about birdwatching through the appropriate

494

and clear presentation of the data and deriving useful information from it, which will allow people

495

and institutions to take decisions based on the search and discrimination of the relevance of such

496

data [44] in an ecological information system. The proposal of such system has the aim to continue

497

with its compilation, treatment and diffusion through the use information technologies, whose

498

effects can be demonstrated in the reflection and knowledge about the topic and for aiding

499

environmentally friendly decision-making, which avoids putting in danger the ecosystems. Such

500

kinds of initiatives require the participation of formal institutions like governments, universities or

501

scientific centers for their organization.

502

Birdwatching activities in Mexico, as in the state of Chihuahua, offer enough conditions

503

to those people involved for, almost in an empiric way, constituting an important example in the

504

development of citizen science, for gathering data, and disseminating knowledge related to these

505

issues. In this context, citizen science has been increasingly used to collect biodiversity data and

506

to inform the management and preservation of the environment [45].

507

In other contexts, the concept of citizen science has been used as a way to democratize

508

scientific knowledge [46]. Moreover, it represents important actions that can be undertaken,

509

especially when financing turns out to be limited, irregular or inexistent; therefore, it becomes a

510

reliable and feasible alternative for monitoring species [47].

511

Citizen science as an alternative: (i) encourages a scientific culture and brings science to

512

the society; (ii) expects to make citizen scientists, through the participation of volunteers who

30
513

gather or process data for research and decision-making; and (iii) provides more value to the citizen

514

observation capacity than that of any sophisticated equipment by itself [48]. The citizen, without

515

being a trained scientist, becomes a prosumer (producer-consumer of information).
