Summary

A major challenge in modern biology is to understand how naturally occurring variation in DNA

4

sequences affects complex organismal traits through networks of intermediate molecular

5

phenotypes. Here, we performed deep RNA sequencing of 200 Drosophila Genetic Reference

6

Panel inbred lines with complete genome sequences, and mapped expression quantitative trait

7

loci for annotated genes, novel transcribed regions (most of which are long noncoding RNAs),

8

transposable elements and microbial species. We identified host variants that affect expression

9

of transposable elements, independent of their copy number, as well as microbiome

10

composition. We constructed sex-specific expression quantitative trait locus regulatory

11

networks. These networks are enriched for novel transcribed regions and target genes in

12

heterochromatin and euchromatic regions of reduced recombination, and genes regulating

13

transposable element expression. This study provides new insights regarding the role of natural

14

genetic variation in regulating gene expression and generates testable hypotheses for future

15

functional analyses.

Introduction

2
3

Understanding how naturally occurring genetic variation affects variation in organismal

4

quantitative traits by modifying underlying molecular networks is a key challenge in modern

5

biology. Most traits are highly polygenic1-3 and associated molecular variants have small

6

additive effects on trait variation4. Most of these variants are in intergenic regions, up- or down-

7

stream of coding regions, or in introns, and presumably play a regulatory role in modulating

8

gene expression.

9

Systems genetics analysis seeks to determine how naturally occurring molecular

10

variation gives rise to genetic variation in organismal phenotypes by examining genetic variation

11

in gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs) and other intermediate

12

molecular phenotypes2, 5-13. Polymorphic variants associated with variation in gene expression

13

are classified as cis- or trans-eQTLs depending on whether they are proximal or distal to the

14

gene encoding the transcript, respectively. Genetic variation in gene expression is pervasive;

15

cis-eQTLs can have large effects on gene expression that are detectable in small samples; and

16

variants associated with human diseases and quantitative traits tend to be enriched for cis-

17

eQTLs2, 5-15. eQTLs with both cis- and trans- effects can be assembled into directed

18

transcriptional networks of regulator and target genes16-18. Elucidating such regulatory

19

transcriptional networks will facilitate understanding how the effects of individual variants

20

propagate through the network, and how multiple variants together regulate gene expression

21

and affect complex traits15-18.

22

Here, we performed deep RNA sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic

23

Reference Panel (DGRP) of inbred lines with complete DNA sequences19,20. We mapped eQTLs

24

for annotated genes, novel transcribed region (NTRs, which are largely long noncoding RNAs),

25

transposable elements (TEs) and microbiome composition; constructed de novo cis-trans eQTL

Results

5
6

We collected and sequenced ribo(-) RNA from replicate pools of young flies from each of 200

7

DGRP lines, separately for males and females. In total we sequenced 1.94 Terabases of RNA,

8

of which on average 13.4 million reads per sample uniquely aligned to the D. melanogaster

9

genome (Table S1). The sequences were processed through a pipeline (Figure S1) that (i)

10

removes adapter and rRNA sequences; (ii) aligns and quantifies expressed TE sequences and

11

microbial transcripts; (iii) verifies the origin of each sample; and (iv) quantifies known and novel

12

D. melanogaster transcripts and corrects for potential alignment bias due to line-specific

13

sequence variation. We then analyzed normalized expression values for endogenous genes,

14

TEs and microbial species.

15
16

Genetic Variation in Gene Expression

17

We quantified expression levels of all RNA sequences that aligned to the reference genome in

18

each DGRP line. After elimination of sequences with low expression, we found that 12,806 of

19

17,097 known D. melanogaster genes (75%) were expressed consistently in young adult males

20

and/or females (Table S2A). In addition, we identified 4,282 novel transcribed regions (NTRs)

21

(Table S2B) that showed no overlap with exons on the same strand. A total of 3,846 of the

22

NTRs were located in introns; 290 were anti-sense to known genes, and 146 were intergenic.

23

Most (95.6%) of the NTRs are ≥ 200 bp; the majority (4,149 or 96.9%) lack protein coding

24

potential21 (Table S2C) and thus qualify as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)22-24. These NTRs in

25

total represent 5.61 Mb new transcribed mature RNA sequences that eluded prior annotation

26

efforts. This increase is likely due to the multiple genetic backgrounds profiled in this study.

1

Variation in gene expression among the DGRP lines may be confounded by variation in

2

alignment rate to the reference strain due to variation in DNA sequences between the DGRP

3

lines and the reference. Indeed, 2,735 genes (2,117 known genes and 618 NTRs) were affected

4

by alignment bias (Table S2D). We corrected for alignment bias, and partitioned variation in

5

gene expression between males and females, DGRP lines, the sex by line interaction, and

6

residual (environmental) terms (Table S2D), using a false discovery rate of FDR  0.05. Similar

7

to previous studies25-27, we found that gene expression is sexually dimorphic: 98% (96%) of

8

expressed known genes (NTRs) have a significant sex effect (Figure 1A, Table S2D). There is

9

genetic variation in the magnitude of sex dimorphism: 69% (10%) of expressed known genes

10

(NTRs) have a significant sex by line interaction (Table S2D). Therefore, we assessed genetic

11

variation in gene expression separately for males and females (Tables S2D, S2E), and found

12

that 12,151 genes (10,354 known genes and 1,797 NTRs) were genetically variable in females

13

(Figure 1B) and 13,819 genes (11,393 known genes and 2,426 NTRs) were genetically variable

14

in males (Figure 1C). These numbers of genes with significant genetic variation are much higher

15

than previously reported studies, which used microarrays (4,308 in females and 5,814 in males)

16

rather than RNA-Seq27. Relative to tiling arrays, RNA-seq has a higher dynamic range and

17

greater precision in quantifying gene expression, although the results from both analyses are

18

positively correlated (Figure S2).

19

Broad sense heritabilities (proportion of phenotypic variance due to genotype

20

differences) ranged from H2 = 0.148 – 0.986 in females and H2 = 0.145 – 0.986 in males

21

(Figures 1B, 1C). Notably, 472 (514) of the genetically variable genes in females (number of for

22

males in parenthesis) were located in molecularly defined heterochromatin (2LHet, 2RHet,

23

3LHet, 3RHet, XHet, and YHet) and chromosome 4. While there are 6.92× (5.52×) as many

24

annotated genes relative to NTRs in euchromatic regions in females (males); there are 2.21 ×

25

(3.18×) as many NTRs in heterochromatin and chromosome 4 in females (males) (Table S2G).

26

Thus, NTRs are highly enriched in heterochromatic regions.

We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)28 to assess the

2

extent to which gene expression levels are genetically correlated in each sex (Figures 1D, 1E,

3

Table S3). We found 13 (15) co-expression modules in females (males). We assessed the

4

extent to which each module was significantly enriched29 (FDR  0.05) for gene ontology (GO)

5

terms and pathway and protein domain annotations (Table S3). For example, female Module 2

6

(149 genes) is enriched for GO terms involved in ovary function and male Module 6 (365 genes)

7

is enriched for biological process GO terms involved in male reproduction. Female Module 12

8

(88 genes) and male Modules 13 (35 genes) and 14 (165 genes) are enriched for GO terms

9

affecting small molecule metabolism. Female Modules 3 (26 genes), 6 (27 genes), and 7 (21

10

genes) and male Modules 9 (42 genes) and 12 (44 genes) are enriched for GO terms affecting

11

innate immunity, and female Module 13 (560 genes) is enriched for GO terms affecting

12

chemosensation.

13
14

Gene Expression QTLs (eQTLs)

15

We performed genome wide association eQTL analyses for each of the genetically variable

16

genes in each sex. We used ~1,932,427 million common (minor allele frequency > 0.05)

17

polymorphisms and accounted for effects of Wolbachia infection, polymorphic inversions and

18

polygenic relatedness on gene expression20,27. We mapped 90,634 eQTLs in females and

19

147,412 eQTLs in males (FDR  0.05). A total of 2,053 genes in females (1,818 known genes

20

and 235 NTRs) and 3,178 genes in males (2,790 known genes and 388 NTRs) were associated

21

with at least one significant eQTL. We defined potentially cis- and trans-regulatory eQTLs as ≤ 1

22

kb and > 1 kb of their respective gene bodies. We mapped cis-eQTLs to 1,435 (2,071) genes in

23

females (males) (Tables S4A, S4B) and trans-eQTLs to 1,527 (2,281) genes in females (males).

24
25

We visualized the significant eQTLs by plotting the polymorphism positions on the Xaxis and the gene positions on the Y-axis such that the diagonal corresponds to cis-eQTLs and

1

the off-diagonal to trans-eQTLs (Figure 2A). The eQTLs tend to cluster in LD blocks in

2

pericentromeric regions, where recombination is suppressed (Table S4C). Many cis-eQTLs are

3

also trans-eQTLs as indicated by vertical off-diagonal trans-bands. We also observed genes

4

associated with many eQTLs throughout the genome, visualized as horizontal off-diagonal

5

trans-bands (Figure 2A). In females (males), 217 (377) genes have 200 or more eQTLs, and 22

6

(43) genes each have greater than 1,000 eQTLs (Tables S4D, S4E). Genes with 200 or more

7

eQTLs are more likely to be found in heterochromatin than those with fewer than 200 eQTLs,

8

and are more likely to be NTRs than annotated genes (Figure 2B, Table S4F). Genes with 200

9

or more eQTLs that are located in euchromatin are more likely to be located in pericentromeric

10

regions at the border of heterochromatin where recombination is reduced30 than those with

11

fewer eQTLs; they are also more likely to be NTRs (Figure 2A, Table S4F).

12
13

eQTL Regulatory Networks

14

The existence of eQTLs that are cis-eQTL for gene X and also trans-eQTL for gene Y (Tables

15

S5A, S5B) enables us to construct gene regulatory networks based on multifactorial variation in

16

a natural population. We identified 408 (794) such regulatory interactions supported by at least

17

one cis-trans eQTL connecting 257 (471) regulatory genes (cis end) to 251 (447) target genes

18

(trans end) in females (males) (Tables S5C, S5D). There are two or three large regulatory

19

networks in each sex, and many smaller networks (Figures S4, S5). The regulatory genes are

20

largely distinct between the two sexes, although many target genes are in common between

21

males and females (Figures 3, S3, Table S5E). Genes from the sex-specific regulatory networks

22

or from the common networks are not enriched for any GO terms. It is not clear from their

23

anatomical gene expression patterns how the sex-specificity could arise, since the majority of

24

these genes are expressed in multiple tissues, including the reproductive tissues of both

25

sexes31.

There are more NTRs than expected among genes with cis-trans eQTLs based on the
total number of NTRs with eQTLs among the target genes (

29.74, P =4.95E-08 in females;

60.54, P = 7.20E-15 in males) but not the regulatory genes (

1.54, P = 0.21 in

4

females;

5

pericentromeric regions of reduced recombination (

6

120.28, P = 0 in males) and target gene locations are enriched for heterochromatin and

7

pericentromeric regions of reduced recombination (

8

147.78, P = 0 in males). Regulatory genes with many target genes thus tend to have multiple

9

cis-eQTLs in LD near the centromere, and regulate other NTRs both in heterochromatic regions

1.49, P = 0.22 in males). The regulatory genes tend to be located in
17.28, P = 3.23E-5 in females;

28.53, P = 9.21E-8 in females;

10

across the genome and euchromatic regions on other chromosomes (Figures 3, S3, S4, S5).

11

The smaller networks with fewer regulators and targets tend to consist of genes in euchromatin

12

in regions of normal recombination (Figures 3, S3, S4, S5; Tables S5C, S5D). Regulatory genes

13

often have many cis-eQTLs; a single cis-eQTL can regulate multiple target genes; and multiple

14

cis-eQTLs within a gene can regulate different target genes. Each gene with at least one cis-

15

eQTL may itself be regulated in trans by cis-eQTLs in one or more upstream genes, and the

16

genes regulated by a focal cis-eQTL may themselves have cis-eQTLs regulating other genes.

Genetic Variation in TE Expression

19

A total of 9% of the D. melanogaster genome contains TEs spanning multiple families32. Active

20

retrotransposon sequences are present in our RNA-seq libraries. We aligned reads to the

21

RepBase database of known repetitive elements33, and quantified TE RNA levels based on

22

normalized read counts. Overall, 1.3% of the RNA-seq reads align to RepBase. The most

23

abundant families of TE sequences were gypsy, copia, BEL, jockey and Mariner/Tc1 elements,

24

but all TE families represented in RepBase were detected (Figure 4A, Table S6A).

1

Line-specific differences in TE RNA levels can be driven by both differences in

2

underlying copy number34 and differences in the rate of transcription per genomic copy. We

3

quantified DNA copy variation for each TE sequence (Table S6B) and used linear models to

4

estimate the percentage of variation in TE expression that arises from differences in copy

5

number (Table S6C). We then partitioned the remaining copy number-independent variation in

6

TE expression between sexes, DGRP lines, the line by sex interaction and residual terms

7

(Table S6C), using FDR  0.05 as the significance threshold for each term in the analysis. Since

8

the majority (153, 79%) of TEs had a significant sex by line interaction effect, we assessed

9

genetic variation in TE expression for each transposon sequence separately for each sex

10

(Tables S6D, S6E). We observed significant genetic variation in expression for 187 (97%) TE

11

sequences in females (Figure 4B) and 186 (96%) TE sequences in males (Figure 4C). Broad

12

sense heritabilities of TE expression ranged from H2 = 0.15 – 0.99 in females and H2 = 0.15 –

13

0.98 in males (Figures 4B, 4C). Thus, there is host genetic control of expression for most D.

14

melanogaster TEs.

15

We assessed whether different TE sequences had similar patterns of expression across

16

the DGRP lines28, separately for males and females (Figures 4D, 4E, Tables S6F, S6G). We

17

found minimal correlation structure in the activity scores of different TEs (Table S6H), with the

18

strongest correlations between pairs of TE sequences from the same family. This suggests that

19

host genetic factors independently affect variation in expression of each TE family.

20
21

TE eQTLs

22

We mapped eQTLs for each of the TEs with genetically variable expression in females and

23

males (Table S7). We found 54 TEs with significant eQTLs (FDR  0.05), 36 in females and 39

24

in males. A total of 20 TE sequences were expressed in both males and females; surprisingly,

25

16 (18) TE sequences were expressed only in females (males). The number of eQTLs per TE

1

sequence ranged from 1-1,020, with on average more eQTL associations for TEs in males than

2

females (Tables S7A-C). Interestingly, the large numbers of eQTLs associated with some TEs

3

were located in LD blocks in pericentromeric regions and on the 4th chromosome (Figure S6,

4

Tables S7D, S7E). Many eQTLs for TEs expressed in both males and females overlapped

5

between the sexes, but typically additional eQTLs were present in males. Although there was

6

little clustering of expression patterns of different TE sequences, 202 (1,032) eQTLs were

7

associated with two or more sequences in females (males) (Tables S7F, S7G).

8
9

Many eQTLs associated with TE expression were within 1 kb of annotated genes and
NTRs. Indeed, 19.8% (17.7%) of TE eQTLs were within 1 kb of NTRs in females (males).

10

Known genes near TE eQTLs were enriched (FDR < 0.05) for GO categories related to

11

regulation of gene expression and protein binding (Table S7H). We next asked to what extent

12

eQTLs associated with gene expression were also associated with expression of TE

13

sequences. We found 1,206 eQTLs associated with 85 genes (37 known genes and 48 NTRs)

14

and 23 TEs in females; and 3,656 eQTLs associated with 166 genes (79 known genes and 87

15

NTRs) and 30 TEs in males (Figure S7, Table S8). We could thus incorporate variation in TE

16

expression into the cis-trans gene regulatory network via shared eQTLs (Figure 5). These

17

eQTLs are predominantly located in pericentromeric regions, and the genes they regulate are in

18

pericentromeric regions as well as heterochromatin.

Genetic Variation in Microbiome Composition

21

RNA samples extracted from pools of whole flies contain RNA from gut microbial communities,

22

and from microbes on their exoskeleton. We assessed the contribution of microbial sequences

23

to the RNA-seq libraries by aligning reads to a database of candidate microbial genomes (Table

24

S9). Wolbachia pipientis, a bacterial endosymbiont that infects ~50% of the DGRP lines20, is the

25

most abundant source of expressed sequence, followed by multiple Acetobacter species and

26

genome assemblies (Figure 6A, Table S9). We estimated the total gene expression from each

microbial species in all samples (Table S10A) and partitioned variation in microbial gene

2

expression between sexes, DGRP lines, the sex by line interaction and residual terms, using

3

FDR  0.05 as the significance threshold (Table S10B). The H2 of Wolbachia pipientis

4

abundance is extremely high (H2 = 0.972), as expected. We next assessed whether the sum of

5

all non-Wolbachia microbial species is genetically variable after accounting for any Wolbachia

6

effects, and estimated H2 = 0.595 (Figure 6B, Table S10B). The sex by line interaction for total

7

microbial gene expression was not significant, indicating that total microbial RNA is highly

8

correlated between males and females. We estimated the heritability of gene expression for the

9

122 non-Wolbachia microbial species, and found that 84 microbial species had significant

10

genetic variation in RNA abundance, with broad sense heritabilities ranging from H2 = 0.07 –

11

0.90 (Figure 6C, Table S10B). Microbial species that are likely to colonize the Drosophila gut

12

(Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species) were among those with the highest H2.

13

We used WGCNA28 to group species with similar abundance patterns based on the

14

average of male and female line means (Figure 6D, Tables S10C, S10D). We found three

15

groups of strongly correlated species, consisting primarily of the gut-related microbes

16

(Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species), and two additional clusters of microbes primarily

17

consisting of viral and fungal species that are strongly anti-correlated with the abundances of

18

species in the first three clusters. Thus, there is line-specific variation in the microbial

19

communities living in and on DGRP flies. Species which most plausibly colonize the Drosophila

20

gut are largely correlated across lines, with some fluctuation in the relative abundance of

21

Acetobacter versus Lactobacillus species.

22
23

eQTLs for Microbiome Composition

24

There was little genetic variation in sexual dimorphism for microbial gene expression; therefore,

25

associated with significant eQTLs (FDR  0.05) (Table S11A). The sum of all microbial species

2

is associated with one eQTL that maps to an NTR; the expression of Borrelia coriaceae,

3

Acidovorax temperans and Podospora anserine map, respectively, to single eQTLs in CG2616,

4

CG46301, and to cic and an NTR; and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides expression maps to

5

39 variants in or near GC and nSyb (Table S11A).

6

We lowered the significance threshold to P < 10-5 to explore the extent to which common

7

eQTLs may control the expression of multiple microbial species that cluster together based on

8

the WGCNA analysis (Figure 6D). At this threshold, 1,455 eQTLs are associated with 88

9

microbial species and the sum of all species (Table S11B); 268 variants were associated with

10

expression of more than one microbial species, and five eQTLs were associated with

11

expression of 10 or more microbial species (Table S11C). These data suggest that there is

12

genetic variation in host control of microbial gene expression and that some variants have

13

pleiotropic effects on multiple microbial species.

14

We assessed whether the genes to which the eQTLs associated with variation in

15

microbial gene expression were enriched for GO categories (FDR  0.05). The most highly

16

enriched Biological Process GO terms were related to development and morphogenesis,

17

including development and function of the nervous system (Table S11D).

Gene Expression and Complex Traits

20

To examine the relationship between variation in gene expression and variation in organismal

21

quantitative trait phenotypes, we chose 11 quantitative traits with published phenotypic data

22

(chill coma recovery time and startle response19; starvation resistance20; day and night sleep

23

bout number, day and night total sleep duration, and total waking activity35; food consumption36;

24

male aggression37; phototaxis38); and additionally measured five metabolic traits (levels of free

25

glucose, glycogen, free glycerol, triglyceride and protein) and three metrics of body size (body

weight, thorax length, thorax width). All traits were quantified in the same laboratory under the

2

same culture conditions used in this study. The line means for all traits are given in Table S12;

3

quantitative genetic analyses of the metabolic and body size traits are given in Table S13; and

4

the most significant associations (P < 10-5) from GWA analyses (separately for males and

5

females) for these quantitative traits based on the 200 lines for which we have gene expression

6

data are in Table S14.

7

We first assessed whether variants associated with all organismal traits were enriched

8

for eQTLs, as found in human studies6,7,9,14,15. We found no enrichment of cis-eQTLs (P = 0.13

9

in females and P = 0.71 in males), trans-eQTLs (P = 0.98 in females and P = 0.28 in males) or

10

all eQTLs (P = 0.94 in females and P = 0.23 in males) among top GWA hits in either sex. Many

11

top GWA hits as well as eQTLs map to regions greater than 1kb from any gene, and may

12

indicate novel regulatory regions.

13

We next performed transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) for individual

14

genetically variable transcripts for gene expression, TE sequences and microbial species, for

15

each of the 18 (19) genetically variable organismal phenotypes in females (males). We found

16

several significant (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.05) associations of transcripts with organismal

17

phenotypes (Table S15). These associations include a known noncoding RNA (CR46032) with

18

male aggression, two NTRs with male waking activity, Gbs-70E with free glucose in both sexes,

19

AkhR with starvation resistance in males and females, and Acidovorax temperans with male

20

aggression (Table S15).

Discussion

23
24

Deep RNA sequencing gives accurate estimates of gene expression of annotated genes and

25

can implicate novel non-coding RNAs and their regulatory interactions with annotated genes.

26

lncRNAs are operationally defined as encoding transcripts > 200 bp with no significant protein13

coding potential21-24,39,40. We have identified 4,282 novel transcribed regions, most of which are

2

likely lncRNAs, increasing the total number of D. melanogaster lncRNAs nearly threefold: from

3

2,36640 to 6,648. These lncRNAs are unlikely to be artifacts since the majority are genetically

4

variable, and they are not randomly distributed in the genome but are preferentially located in

5

heterochromatic regions and in pericentromeric euchromatin bordering heterochromatin. Thus,

6

there is genetic variation in heterochromatic gene expression, thought to be largely

7

transcriptionally silent41. These heterochromatic and pericentromeric lncRNAs are regulated by

8

pericentromeric cis-eQTLs as well as a large number of trans-eQTLs dispersed throughout the

9

euchromatic genome. Genes associated with eQTLs with both cis- and trans- effects form sex-

10

specific networks of regulator and target genes, the largest of which is enriched for lncRNA

11

target genes in heterochromatin and regulator and target genes in pericentromeric euchromatin.

12

The considerable overlap between eQTLs associated with lncRNAs in the large networks and

13

TE expression recruits TEs to the network. We do not know where the TE sequences with

14

genetically variable expression are integrated in the genome; however, heterochromatin is

15

composed of largely silenced TE repeats41, raising the possibility that TEs in heterochromatin

16

are subject to the same regulation as other heterochromatic genes. Further work is needed to

17

confirm the regulatory networks derived from naturally occurring genetic variation and determine

18

the regulatory mechanism(s) through which the lncRNAs act22,24,39,40,42,43.

19

The first step in systems genetic analysis is to identify eQTLs associated with both gene

20

expression and organismal quantitative traits, for which variation in gene expression is

21

correlated with variation in the organismal phenotypes2,5,8. We did not find any such trios,

22

although we did find interesting transcript-trait associations. This may be because our sample

23

size is adequate to detect eQTLs but not QTLs affecting organismal traits, which have smaller

24

effects; because eQTLs need to be mapped in tissues relevant to the organismal trait; and

25

because there are non-linear (epistatic) relationships between QTLs for both transcripts and

26

organismal phenotypes. The complex and highly connected cis-trans regulatory networks

at least at the level of gene expression.

Methods

5
6

Drosophila lines: We used 200 inbred, sequenced DGRP lines19,20, established by 20

7

generations of full sib inbreeding from gravid females collected at the Raleigh, NC USA

8

Farmer‟s Market. Genome sequences of the lines were obtained previously using the Illumina

9

platform with an average of coverage of 27×. A total of 4,565,215 molecular variants (3,976,011

10

single/multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs/MNPs), 169,053 polymorphic insertions

11

(relative to the reference genome), 293,363 polymorphic deletions and 125,788 polymorphic

12

microsatellites) segregate in the DGRP.

13
14

Sample collection: All lines were reared on cornmeal-molasses-agar medium at 25°C, 60–75%

15

relative humidity and a 12-hr light-dark cycle at equal larval densities. We collected two

16

replicates of 25 females and 30 males per line, for a total of 800 samples. We used a strict

17

randomized experimental design for sample collection. We collected mated 3-5 day old flies

18

between 1-3 pm. We transferred the flies into empty culture vials and froze them over ice

19

supplemented with liquid nitrogen, and sexed the frozen flies. The samples were transferred to

20

2.0 ml nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes (Ambion) and stored at -80°C until ready to process.

21
22

RNA sequencing: Total RNA was extracted with QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen) and the Quick-

23

RNA MiniPrep Zymo Research Kit (Zymo Research). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was depleted

24

from 5 ug of total RNA using the Ribo-ZeroTM Gold Kit (Illumina, Inc). Depleted mRNA was

25

fragmented and converted to first-strand cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase

26

(Invitrogen). During the synthesis of second strand cDNA, dUTP instead of dTTP was

incorporated to label the second strand cDNA. cDNA from each RNA sample was used to

2

produce barcoded cDNA libraries using NEXTflex™ DNA Barcodes (Bioo Scientific, Inc.) with

3

an Illumina TruSeq compatible protocol. Libraries were size-selected for 250 bp (insert size

4

~130 bp) using Agencourt Ampure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Second strand DNA was

5

digested with Uracil-DNA Glycosylase before amplification to produce directional cDNA libraries.

6

Libraries were quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kits (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Bioanalyzer

7

(Agilent Technologies, Inc.) to calculate molarity. Libraries were then diluted to equal molarity

8

and re-quantified. A total of 50 pools of 16 libraries were made, again randomly assigning

9

samples to each pool. Pooled library samples were quantified again to calculate final molarity

10

and then denatured and diluted to 14pM. Pooled library samples were clustered on an Illumina

11

cBot; each pool was sequenced on one lane of Illumina Hiseq2500 using 125 bp single-read v4

12

chemistry.

13
14

RNA sequence analysis: Barcoded sequence reads were demultiplexed using the Illumina

15

pipeline v1.9. Adapter sequences were trimmed using cutadapt v1.644 and trimmed sequences

16

shorter than 50bp were discarded from further analysis. Trimmed sequences were then aligned

17

to multiple target sequence databases in the following order, using BWA v0.7.10 (MEM

18

algorithm with parameters „-v 2 –t 4‟)45: (1) all trimmed sequences were aligned against a

19

database containing the complete 5S, 18S-5p8S-2S-28S, mt:lrRNA, and mt:srRNA sequences

20

to filter out residual rRNA that escaped depletion during library preparation; (2) remaining

21

sequences were then aligned against a custom database of potential micriobiome component

22

species (see below) using BWA; (3) sequences that did not align to either the rRNA or

23

microbiome databases were aligned to all D. melanogaster sequences in RepBase33. The

24

remaining sequences that did not align to any of the databases above were then aligned to the

25

D. melanogaster genome (BDGP5) and known transcriptome (FlyBase v5.57) using STAR

v2.4.0e46. Libraries with fewer than 5 million reads uniquely aligned to the D. melanogaster

2

reference genome were re-sequenced to achieve sufficient read depth.

3
4

Generation of microbiome database: We first performed a preliminary alignment of RNA-seq

5

reads by filtering only rRNA sequences, and then aligning directly to the D. melanogaster

6

genome using the tools and parameters described above. Sequences that did not align to the

7

rRNA database or D. melanogaster reference genome were then analyzed with Trinity v2.1.1 to

8

perform de novo assembly of longer sequences from the short reads. Assembled sequences >

9

1kb in length were then searched against the refseq_genomic database (downloaded from

10

NCBI on 1/27/16) using BLAST. We then compiled a list of all refseq genomes that were found

11

as a top BLAST hit for at least two assembled sequences. We compiled all fasta files for each of

12

these refseq genomes into a single database for alignment with BWA.

13
14

Genotype validation: To validate the DGRP line assigned to each RNA-seq sample, we

15

identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the RNA-seq reads that aligned to the

16

D. melanogaster reference genome using STAR as described above. We retained only those

17

SNP calls covered by at least 3 reads and at least 75% of all reads supporting the major

18

genotype (note that DGRP lines are inbred and therefore the majority of SNPs are

19

homozygous). This filtering process produced >400k usable SNPs per sample, primarily located

20

in transcribed regions of the genome. We then performed two validation tests of the DGRP line

21

assigned to each sample X by comparing to the previously published genotype calls for each

22

DGRP line (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/data/website/dgrp2.tgeno20). First, we computed the

23

“line mean error” (LME) for each line as follows: given the set of homozygous SNPs from line Y

24

that have sufficient coverage (described above) in sample X, LME(X,Y) = # of mismatching

25

SNPs / total # of comparable SNPs. We confirmed that for each sample X, the DGRP line Ylab

26

labeled for that samples produced the minimum value of LME(X,Y) as compared to all other

possible line assignments Yalt, and further confirmed that LME(X,Ylab) was below 1%. Second,

2

we performed competitive tests between the labeled line Ylab and each possible alternate line

3

Yalt. Under this test, we considered only the SNPs that are homozygous for different genotypes

4

in Ylab and Yalt (i.e., only the segregating SNPs for the two lines) and which have sufficient

5

coverage in sample X. We then computed the “line error ratio” (LER) = # of SNPs matching Ylab /

6

# of SNPs matching Yalt. We confirmed that for each sample X, the lowest LER for any Yalt was

7

> 1 (i.e., the majority of SNP calls always supported the labeled line compared to any alternative

8

line).

9
10

Inference of novel transcripts: We constructed a de novo transcriptome for each individual

11

sample by inputting the RNA-seq reads aligned to the D. melanogaster reference genome into

12

Cufflinks v2.2.147. We also considered the novel transcribed regions (NTRs) identified in a

13

previous study based on unstranded pooled RNA sequencing of the DGRP lines27. However,

14

the previously published data do not provide strand-specific signal, while our current RNA-seq

15

data uses a strand-specific library preparation. Therefore, we reassigned the strand for each of

16

the previously published NTRs that was supported by the greater number of total aligned reads

17

across all samples. We then merged all de novo sample transcriptomes and the previously

18

published NTRs using the cuffmerge tool included with Cufflinks v2.2.1, then removed all

19

merged transcript models with any exon overlapping on the same strand any exon in the known

20

D. melanogaster transcriptome. We defined the known transcriptome here as all gene models in

21

FlyBase v5.57 plus all subsequently added gene models in FlyBase v6.11 to account for

22

recently discovered lncRNA sequences. Thus, the final output of this analysis was a set of

23

NTRs constructed from both our current RNA-seq data and previously published pooled RNA-

24

seq data that do not overlap any known gene exons on the same strand.

1

Gene expression estimation: Read counts for individual microbial species were computed as

2

all reads aligning to any sequence in any genome for any strain of that species. Reads aligning

3

to multiple species were ignored for individual species read counts. We also aligned

4

microbiome-aligning reads to the D. melanogaster genome, and removed all reads that aligned

5

to both microbial and D. melanogaster sequences before computing read counts, to account for

6

several domains which are highly conserved between microbial and metazoan species. Read

7

counts were computed for transposon sequences by computing the number of reads uniquely

8

aligned to each transposon sequence in RepBase. Highly homologous sequences were

9

grouped together for computing transposon read counts. Read counts were computed for

10

known and novel gene models using HTSeq-count48 with the „intersection-nonempty‟

11

assignment method. Tabulated read counts for each expression feature type (microbiome,

12

transposon, endogenous genes) were then normalized across all samples using EdgeR49 as

13

follows. First, genes with low expression overall (<10 aligned reads in >75% of the libraries)

14

were excluded from the analysis. Library sizes were re-computed as the sum of reads assigned

15

to the remaining genes, and further normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM)

16

method50. At this point, we retained only genes (known or novel) whose expression in both

17

biological replicates was above an empirical threshold in more than 200 line-sex combinations

18

(400 samples total). This criterion retains genes expressed in only one sex. The threshold was

19

determined by fitting all log2 transformed FPKM expression data points using a 2-component

20

Gaussian mixture model and finding the expression value (FPKM = 0.280263) where the

21

posterior probability of being in the lower expression component is 0.95. Genes on chrU and

22

chrUextra were also removed. We further adjusted transposon expression estimates to account

23

for differences in transposon copy number across lines by fitting a linear model: RNA ~ DNA +

24

ε, where RNA = the normalized log2(RNA-seq read count); and DNA = normalized log2(DNA

25

read count) derived from the previously published DNA-seq data for each DGRP line20. After

26

fitting the linear model for each transposon sequence, ε estimates the relative transcription rate

1

in each line independent of copy number, and was used as the adjusted transposon expression

2

for all subsequent analysis. We further adjusted endogenous gene expression values by

3

estimating and removing the effect of alignment bias resulting from higher rates of non-

4

reference variants clustering in some lines. We computed the alignment bias score A(g,L)

5

defined as the number of non-reference nucleotides per kb in all exons of gene g in DGRP line

6

L, based on the previous map of genomic variation in the DGRP20. We then fit a linear model for

7

each endogenous gene: Y = A + ε, where Y is the normalized expression profile for gene g after

8

the read counting and EdgeR normalization described above. After fitting these linear models, ε

9

represents the alignment bias-corrected expression, and was used as the normalized gene

10

expression in all subsequent analysis.

11
12

Genetics of gene expression: For each class of expression features (endogenous genes,

13

transposons, microbiome), we fit mixed-effect models to the gene expression data

14

corresponding to: Y = S + W + W×S + L + L×S + ε, where Y is the observed log2(normalized

15

read count), S is sex, W is Wobachia infection status, W×S is Wolbachia by sex interaction, L is

16

DGRP line, L×S is the line by sex interaction and ε is the residual error. We also performed

17

reduced analyses (Y = W + L + ε) independently for males and females. We identified

18

genetically variable transcripts as those that passed a 5% FDR threshold (based on Benjamini-

19

Hochberg51 corrected P-values) for the L and/or L×S terms. We computed the broad sense

20

heritabilities (H2) for each gene expression trait separately for males and females as

21

, where

and

are, respectively, the among line and within line variance

components.

23
24

Clustering by genetic correlation: For each feature type (microbiome, transposons,

25

endogenous genes), we clustered line means using the WGCNA R package v1.5128 as follows.

26

Only genes with sufficient average expression (Log2 FPKM > 0) and genetic variance (line

mean variance > 0.05) were considered in these analyses. First, the Pearson correlation

2

coefficient for every pair of line means, the soft-power threshold was computed using the

3

pickSoftThreshold function, and used to convert the correlation matrix to an adjacency matrix

4

with approximately scale-free connectivity. The adjacency matrix was then converted to a

5

dissimilarity matrix based on the topological overlap map28. Expression features were then

6

clustered using hierarchical clustering (hclust function) based on the dissimilarity matrix, and

7

split into distinct modules using the cutreeDynamic with deepSplit=4 and minClusterSize=20 (for

8

endogenous gene expression, minClusterSize=4 was used for microbiome and transposon

9

clustering). Module eigengenes were computed for each cluster, and highly similar clusters

10

were combined using the mergeCloseModules function with cutHeight = 0.25. Expression

11

features assigned to module 0 (insufficient similarity) were discarded. Modules consisting of

12

>1,000 features were also discarded as insufficiently split into distinct modules. For each

13

expression feature, the degree was computed as the overage topological overlap with all other

14

features assigned to the same module. The average degree of each module was computed as

15

the mean degree across all features in the module. Modules were sorted by average degree,

16

such that module 1 has the highest average degree in each analysis.

17
18

Gene set enrichment analyses: Lists of known gene IDs (FlyBase FBgn accessions) were

19

uploaded to FlyMine29 or Panther52 for functional enrichment. For analysis of gene lists from

20

WGCNA clusters, the list of known genes input to WGCNA was used as the background set, to

21

correct for any biases inherent to highly heritable expression patterns in general.

22
23

Expression QTL (eQTL) mapping: For each gene expression feature, we performed eQTL

24

analysis as previously described26. Briefly, we adjusted mean expression values in each sex for

25

fixed effects of Wolbachia infection status, five major polymorphic inversions (In2L(t), In2R(NS),

26

In3R(P), In3R(K), In3R(Mo)), and the first 10 principal components of the genetic relatedness

matrix of all DGRP lines using a linear model. We mapped QTLs for the adjusted line means

2

using PLINK53 against 1,932,427 SNPs with major allele frequency > 0.05 and missing

3

genotypes in fewer than 25% of the 200 DGRP lines profiled by RNA-seq. We computed FDR of

4

eQTL calls by comparing observed eQTL P-value distributions to those obtained from running

5

PLINK on 100 permutations of the observed line means for each expression feature. At any

6

given P-value cut-off X, the estimated false positive rate of eQTLs for a specific gene

7

expression feature is the average number of eQTLs with P-value < X across all permutations.

8

The FDR at the same P-value is then computed as the estimated false positive rate divided by

9

the number of eQTLs with P-value < X in the observed data. Using this formulation of FDR, we

10

identified the unadjusted P-value cut-off corresponding to 5% FDR for each gene expression

11

feature. No further model selection was performed, however we classified eQTLs as being

12

either cis-eQTLs (within 1kb of the gene body for the associated expression feature) or trans-

13

eQTLs (> 1 kb of the gene body).

14
15

Construction of eQTL networks: We then constructed regulatory eQTL networks based on

16

individual SNPs which were called as both cis- and trans-eQTLs for multiple expression

17

features. Specifically, we assign a directed edge X → Y if there is at least one variant that is

18

both a cis-eQTL for gene X (defined as within 1 kb of gene X) and a trans-eQTL for gene Y at

19

5% FDR. We then broke all loops in the regulatory network for each sex by dropping the edge in

20

each loop with the highest minimum P-value from all associated SNPs to create a directed,

21

acyclic network.

22

To measure body weight and size, we collected 10 replicates of 10 flies per line and sex

2

into pre-weighed 1.7 ml tubes, and weighed and flash froze them for downstream analyses.

3

Virgin flies were used to avoid body weight variation due to variation in egg production. In

4

addition we measured thorax length and thorax width as metrics for body size.
Frozen flies were homogenized in 250 μL Dulbecco‟s phosphate-buffered saline, and

6

after gentle centrifugation supernatants were collected for measurements of free glucose,

7

glycogen, free glycerol, triglyceride and total protein (further diluted 10 fold). For free glucose

8

and glycogen, samples were denatured at 95°C for 25 minutes to prevent glycogenolysis.

9

Measurements were performed following protocols provided by the Glycogen

10

Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision Inc.). For free glycerol and triglyceride, we used

11

the Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Sigma Aldrich Inc.), and incubated samples with the

12

Triglyceride Reagent for 1 hour at 37°C. For total protein measurement, we used the Qubit

13

Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).

Quantitative trait genetic parameters: We used mixed model, factorial ANOVAs (Y = S + L +

16

L×S + Rep(L) + S×Rep(L) + ε, to partition variation of the quantitative traits between sexes (S),

17

DGRP lines (L) and replicate vials within lines (Rep). Broad sense heritabilities were estimated

eQTL-GWA enrichment analysis: We performed GWA analyses for all quantitative traits,

22

separately for females and males. All phenotypes (line means) were first adjusted for the effect

23

of Wolbachia infection and major polymorphic inversions using a linear model. The residuals

24

(plus the intercept) from this analysis were then used as phenotype in a linear mixed model to

25

test for the effect of each common variant individually, while adjusting for sample structure using

26

a genomic relationship matrix (GRM), as implemented in GCTA-MLMA55. The GRM was built as

where W is a matrix of centered and scaled genotypes for the 200 lines and p is the total
number of genetic variants.

3

For each trait and sex, variants with P < 10-5 were retained for downstream analysis. We

4

then combined the lists of variants associated with each trait, separately for females and males,

5

to obtain a single list of unique variants (i.e., no duplicates) associated with any of the traits of

6

interest. The enrichment analysis proceeded as described in Ref. 14, within each sex. Briefly,

7

GWAS hits were divided into minor allele frequency bins of width equal to 0.05. Then, an equal

8

number of common variants (which may or may not have included actual GWAS hits) per bin

9

were sampled at random and the overlap with eQTLs was calculated. This procedure was

10

repeated 10,000 times and an empirical P-value for the enrichment was calculated as the

11

number of replicates where the overlap between randomly sampled variants and eQTLs was

12

greater than or equal to the observed overlap between GWAS hits and eQTLs over the total

13

number of replicates.

Association of expression and quantitative traits: A transcriptome-wide association study

16

(TWAS), i.e., regressing the phenotype on each gene‟s expression level, was performed for

17

each sex separately for each quantitative trait. We developed a method that accounts for

18

structure present in the transcriptome due correlations between transcripts. This was achieved

19

by fitting a linear mixed model of the type:

20

phenotypic values for n lines,  = fixed population mean effect, w = n-vector of the tested gene‟s

21

centered and scaled expression level,  = fixed effect of the gene, t = n-vector of random

22

transcriptomic line effect (t ~N(0, T2t)), and e = n-vector of random error (e ~N(0, I2e)).

23

, where y = n-vector of mean

The key term in the model that accounts for sample structure is T, the transcriptomic
, where W- is a matrix of centered

24

relationship matrix (TRM). The TRM was computed as

25

and scaled gene expression levels for the 200 lines, excluding the gene tested to maximize the

similar role to the GRM in GWAS.

. Raw P-values and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrected P-values51

The phenotypes were adjusted for the effects of Wolbachia and major polymorphic

7

inversions as described in the previous section. Because the phenotypes were adjusted, we did

8

not adjust gene expression in this analysis to avoid spurious associations due to adjustment on

9

both sides of the equation.

10

We also performed similar associations of quantitative traits with TEs and microbial gene

11

expression, using the same models as for TWAS but substituting TE and microbial expression

12

for gene expression levels. Quantitative trait phenotypes were adjusted for the effects of

13

Wolbachia and major polymorphic inversions but the TE and microbial expression data were

14

not. The TE analysis was performed for males and females separately, while sex-pooled

15

microbe expression data was used with female or male quantitative trait phenotypes since

16

microbial gene expression was not sex-specific.
