Abstract

20

Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) constitute a diverse group of endonucleases of which

21

some mediate host defense by utilizing small interfering DNA guides (siDNA) to cleave

22

complementary invading DNA. This activity can be repurposed for programmable DNA cleavage.

23

However, currently characterized DNA-cleaving pAgos require elevated temperatures (≥65°C) for

24

their activity, making them less suitable for applications that require moderate temperatures,

25

such as genome editing. Here we report the functional and structural characterization of the

26

siDNA-guided DNA-targeting pAgo from the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium butyricum

27

(CbAgo). CbAgo displays a preference for siDNAs that have a deoxyadenosine at the 5’-end and

28

thymidines in the sub-seed segment (siDNA nucleotides 2-4). Furthermore, CbAgo mediates

29

DNA-guided DNA cleavage of AT-rich double stranded DNA at moderate temperatures (37°C).

This study demonstrates that certain pAgos are capable of programmable DNA cleavage at

moderate temperatures and thereby expands the scope of the potential pAgo–based

Introduction

35

Eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) play a key role in RNA interference (RNAi) processes1–3. As the

36

core of the multiprotein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), eAgos bind small non-coding RNA

37

molecules as guides to direct the RISC complex towards complementary RNA targets3–5. Reflecting

38

their physiological function, variation among eAgos is observed with respect to the presence or absence

39

of a catalytic site, and to their potential to interact with other proteins6. Depending on the eAgo and on

40

the sequence complementarity between guide and target RNA, eAgo-guide complexes either catalyze

41

endonucleolytic cleavage of the target RNA7 or indirectly silence the target RNA by repressing its

42

translation and promoting its degradation through recruitment of additional silencing factors8.

43

Independent of the mechanism, eAgo-mediated RNA binding generally results in sequence-specific

44

silencing of gene expression. As such, eAgos can coordinate various cellular processes by regulating

45

intracellular RNA levels.

46

Prokaryotes also encode Argonaute proteins (pAgos)9,10. Various pAgos share a high degree of

47

structural homology with eAgos as both pAgos and eAgos adopt the same four domain (N-PAZ-MID-

48

PIWI) architecture9–12. Despite their structural homology, several recently characterized pAgos have

49

distinct functional roles and different guide and/or target preferences compared to eAgos. For example,

50

several pAgos have been implicated in host defense by directly targeting DNA instead of RNA13–16. One

51

of the best characterized mechanisms that pAgos utilize is DNA-guided DNA interference, which is

52

demonstrated for pAgos from Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo), Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo), and

53

Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo)13–15,17–20. These pAgos use 5’-end phosphorylated small

54

interfering DNAs (siDNAs) for recognition and successive cleavage of complementary DNA targets. This

55

mechanism enables both TtAgo and PfAgo to mediate host defense against invading nucleic acids.

56

Prokaryotes lack homologs of eukaryotic enzymes that are involved in guide biogenesis21. Instead, both

57

TtAgo and MjAgo - besides the canonical siDNA-dependent target cleavage termed 'slicing' - exhibit an

58

alternative nuclease activity termed 'chopping'14,17. Chopping facilitates autonomous generation of small

59

DNA fragments from dsDNA substrates. Subsequently, these DNA fragments generated during

60

chopping can serve as siDNAs for canonical slicing14,17.

61

TtAgo and PfAgo can be programmed with short synthetic siDNA which allows them to target

62

and cleave dsDNA sequences of choice in vitro13,15. This activity has enabled the repurposing of PfAgo

63

as an universal restriction endonuclease for in vitro molecular cloning22. In addition, a diagnostic TtAgo-

64

based application termed NAVIGATER (Nucleic Acid enrichment Via DNA Guided Argonaute from

65

Thermus thermophilus) was developed which enables enhanced detection of rare nucleic acids with

66

single nucleotide precision23. In analogy with the now commonly used CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-

67

Cas12a enzymes24–26, it has also been suggested that pAgos could be repurposed as next-generation

68

genome editing tools27. However, due to the thermophilic nature (optimum activity temperature ≥65°C)

69

and low levels of endonuclease activity at the relevant temperatures (20-37°C), it is unlikely that the

70

well-studied TtAgo, PfAgo and MjAgo are suitable for genome editing. The quest for a pAgo that can

71

cleave dsDNA at moderate temperatures has resulted in the characterization of the Argonaute protein

72

from Natronobacterium gregory (NgAgo), which was claimed to be the first pAgo suitable for genome

73

editing purposes28. However, the study reporting this application has been retracted after a series of

74

reproducibility issues28–30. Instead, it has been suggested that NgAgo targets RNA rather than DNA31.

75

Although considerable efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms and biological roles

76

of pAgos, efforts have mainly focused on pAgo variants from (hyper)thermophiles. This has left a large

77

group of mesophilic pAgos unexplored. We here report the characterization of the Argonaute protein

78

from the mesophilic bacterium Clostridium butyricum (CbAgo). We demonstrate that CbAgo can utilize

79

siDNA guides to cleave both ssDNA and dsDNA targets at moderate temperatures (37°C). In addition,

80

we have elucidated the macromolecular structure of CbAgo in complex with a siDNA guide and

81

complementary ssDNA target in a catalytically competent state. CbAgo displays an unusual preference

82

for siDNAs with a deoxyadenosine at the 5’-end and thymidines in the sub-seed segment (siDNA nt 2-

83

4). The programmable DNA endonuclease activity of CbAgo provides a foundation for the development

84

of pAgo-based applications at moderate temperatures..

Materials and methods

94

Plasmid construction

95

The CbAgo gene was codon harmonized for E.coli Bl21 (DE3) and inserted into a pET-His6 MBP TEV

96

cloning vector (obtained from the UC Berkeley MacroLab, Addgene #29656) using ligation

97

independent cloning (LIC) using oligonucleotides oDS067 and oDS068 (Table S1) to generate a

98

protein expression construct that encodes the CbAgo polypeptide sequence fused to an N-terminal tag

99

comprising a hexahistidine sequence, a maltose binding protein (MBP) and a Tobacco Etch Virus

100

(TEV) protease cleavage site.

101
102

Generation of the Double mutant

103

CbAgo double mutant (D541A, D611A) was generated using an adapted Quick Directed Mutagenesis

104

Kit instruction manual (Stratagene). The primers were designed using the web-based program primerX

105

(http://bioinformatics.org/primerx).

107

CbAgo expression and purification

108

The CbAgo WT and DM proteins were expressed in E.coli Bl21(DE3) Rosetta™ 2 (Novagen). Cultures

109

were grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin and 34 µg ml-1 chloramphenicol

110

until an OD600nm of 0.7 was reached. CbAgo expression was induced by addition of isopropyl β-D-1-

111

thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. During the expression cells were

112

incubated at 18°C for 16 hours with continues shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed

113

by sonication (Bandelin, Sonopuls. 30% power, 1s on/2s off for 5min) in lysis buffer containing 20 mM

114

Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, supplemented with a EDTA free protease inhibitor

115

cocktail tablet (Roche). The soluble fraction of the lysate was loaded on a nickel column (HisTrap Hp,

116

GE healthcare). The column was extensively washed with wash buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH

117

7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 30 mM imidazole. Bound protein was eluted by increasing the concentration of

118

imidazole in the wash buffer to 250 mM. The eluted protein was dialysed at 4°C overnight against 20

119

mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, and 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of 1mg TEV protease

120

(expressed and purified according to Tropea et al. 200955) to cleave of the His6-MBP tag. Next the

121

cleaved protein was diluted in 20mM HEPES pH 7.5 to lower the final salt concentration to 125 mM KCl.

122

The diluted protein was applied to a heparin column (HiTrap Heparin HP, GE Healthcare), washed with

123

20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 125 mM KCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.125-2 M KCl. Next, the eluted

124

protein was loaded onto a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 16/600 column, GE Healthcare) and

125

eluted with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500mM KCl and 1 mM DTT. Purified CbAgo protein was diluted in

126

size exclusion buffer to a final concentration of 5 µM. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and

127

stored at -80°C.

128
129

Co-purification nucleic acids:

130

To 500 pmoles of purified CbAgo in SEC buffer CaCl2 and proteinase K (Ambion) were added to final

131

concentrations of 5 mM CaCl2 and 250 µg/mL proteinase K. The sample was incubated for 4 hours at

132

65°C.

133

phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol pH 7.5-8.0 in a 1:1 ratio. The top layer was isolated and nucleic acids

134

were precipitated using ethanol precipitation by adding 99% ethanol in a 1:2 ratio supplied with 0.5%

135

Linear polymerized acrylamide as a carrier. This mixture was incubated overnight at -20°C and

136

centrifuged in a table centrifuge at 16,000 g for 30 min. Next, the nucleic acids pellet was washed with

137

70% ethanol and solved in 50 µL MilliQ water. The purified nucleic acids were treated with either 100

138

µg/mL RNase A (Thermo), 2 units DNase I (NEB) or both for 1 hour at 37°C and resolved on a denaturing

reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 500 µM MnCl2+. The target was

144

added after the CbAgo and siDNA had been incubation for 15 min at 37°C. Then the complete reaction

145

mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by adding 2x RNA loading dye

this the samples were resolved on a 20% denaturing (7 M Urea) polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained

148

with SYBR gold nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) and imaged using a G:BOX Chemi imager (Syngene).

Double stranded Activity assay

151

In two half reactions 12.5 pmoles of CbAgo was loaded with either 12.5pmoles of forward or reverse

152

siDNA in reaction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 µg/ml BSA, 250 µM MnCl2. The half reactions

153

were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Next, both half reactions were mixed together and 120 ng target

154

plasmid was added after which the mixture was incubated for 1 hour of 37°C. After the incubation the

155

target plasmid was purified from the mixture using a DNA clean and concentrate kit (DNA Clean &

156

Concentrator™-5, Zymogen) via the supplied protocol. The purified plasmid was subsequently cut using

157

either EcoRI-HF (NEB) or SapI-HF (NEB) in Cutsmart buffer (NEB) for 30 min at 37°C. A 6x DNA loading

158

dye (NEB) was added to the plasmid sample prior to resolving it on a 0.7% agarose gel stained with

159

SYBR gold (Invitrogen).

160
161

Crystallization

162

To reconstitute the CbAgo DM-siDNA-target DNA complex, siDNA and target DNA were pre-mixed at a

163

1:1 ratio, heated to 95°C, and slowly cooled to room temperature. The formed dsDNA duplex (0.5M)

164

was mixed with CbAgo DM in SEC buffer at a 1:1:4 ratio (CbAgo DM:duplex DNA), and MgCl2 was

165

added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The sample was incubated for 15 minutes at 20°C to allow

166

complex formation. The complex was crystallized at 20°C using the hanging drop vapour diffusion

167

method by mixing equal volumes of complex and reservoir solution. Initial crystals were obtained at a

168

CbAgo DM concentration of 5 mg/ml with a reservoir solution consisting of 4 M Sodium Formate. Data

169

was collected from crystals grown obtained using a complex concentration of 4.3 mg/ml and reservoir

170

solution containing 3.8 M Sodium Formate and 5 mM NiCl2 at 20°C. For cryoprotection, crystals were

171

transferred to a drop of reservoir solution and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.

172

X-ray diffraction data were measured at beamline X06DA (PXIII) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul

173

Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using AutoPROC

174

(Vonrhein et al (2011)). Crystals of the CbAgo-siDNA-target DNA complex diffracted to a resolution of

175

3.55 Å and belonged to space group P63 2 2, with one copy of the complex in the asymmetric unit. The

176

structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser-MR (McCoy et al., 2007). As search

177

model, the structure of TtAgo in complex with guide and target DNA strands (PDB: 5GQ9) was used

178

after removing loops and truncating amino acid side chains. Phases obtained using the initial molecular

179

replacement solution were improved by density modification using phenix.resolve (Terwilliger, 2004)

180

and phenix.morph_model (Terwilliger et al., 2013). The atomic model was built manually in Coot (Emsley

181

et al., 2010) and refined using phenix.refine (Afonine et al., 2012). The final binary complex model

182

contains CbAgo residues 1-463 and 466-748, guide DNA residues 1–16, and target DNA residues (-

183

18)–(-1).

Structure analysis

186

Core Root Means Square Deviations (rmsd) of structure alignments were calculated using Coot SSM

187

superpose (Krissinel et al 2004). Intramolecular interactions were analysed using PDBePISA (Krissinel

188

and Henrick, 2007). Figures were generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger).

190

Single-Molecule Experimental Set-Up

191

Single-molecule fluorescence FRET measurements were performed with a prism-type total internal

192

reflection fluorescence microscope. Cy3 and Cy5 molecules were excited with 532 nm and 637 nm

193

wavelength, respectively. Resulting Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence signal was collected through a 60X water

194

immersion objective (UplanSApo, Olympus) with an inverted microscope (IX73, Olympus) and split by

195

a dichroic mirror (635dcxr, Chroma). Scattered laser light was blocked out by a triple notch filter (NF01-

196

488/532/635, Semrock). The Cy3 and Cy5 signals were recorded using a EM-CCD camera (iXon Ultra,

197

DU-897U-CS0-#BV, Andor Technology) with exposure time 0.1 s. All single-molecule experiments were

198

done at room temperature (22 ± 2C).

199

Fluorescent DNA and RNA preparation

200

The RNAs with amine-modification (amino-modifier C6-U phosphoramidite, 10-3039, Glen Research)

201

were purchased from STPharm (South Korea) and DNAs with amine-modification (internal amino

202

modifier iAmMC6T) Ella biotech (Germany). The guide and target strands were labeled with donor (Cy3)

203

and acceptor (Cy5), respectively, using the NHS-ester form of Cy dyes (GE Healthcare). 2012).1 µL of

204

1 mM of DNA/RNA dissolved in MilliQ H20 is added to 5 µL labeling buffer of (freshly prepared)

205

sodiumtetraborate (380 mg/10mL, pH 8.5). 1 µL of 20 mM dye (1 mg in 56 µL DMSO) is added and

206

incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark, followed by washing and ethanol precipitation. The

207

labeling efficiency was ~100%.

208

Single-molecule sample preparation

209

A microfluidic chamber was incubated with 20 µL Streptavidin (0.1 mg/mL, Sigma) for 30 sec. Unbound

210

Streptavidin was washed with 100 µL of buffer T50 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH8.0], 50 mM NaCl buffer). The

211

fifty microliters of 50 pM acceptor-labelled target construct were introduced into the chamber and

212

incubated for 1 min. Unbound labeled constructs were washed with 100 µL of buffer T50. The CbAgo

213

binary complex was formed by incubating 10 nM purified CbAgo with 1 nM of donor-labeled guide in a

214

buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] (Ambion), 1mM MnCl2, and 100 mM NaCl (Ambion) at 37°C

215

for 20 min. For binding rate (kon) measurements, the binary complex was introduced into the fluidics

216

chamber using syringe during the measurement. The experiments were performed at the room

217

temperature (23 ± 1°C).

218

For fluorescence Guide Loading Experiments before immobilizing CbAgo on the single-molecule

219

surface, 1 µL of 5 µM His-tagged apo-CbAgo was incubated with 1 µL of 1 µg/ml biotinylated anti-6x His

220

antibody (Abcam) for 10 min. Afterward, the mixture was diluted 500x in T50 and 50 µL were loaded in

221

the microfluidic channel for 30 s incubation, followed by washing with 100 µL of T50 buffer. Cy3-labeled

222

ssDNA (0.1 ) was applied to the microfluidic chamber in imaging buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100

223

mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM Trolox ((±)-6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid),

224

supplemented with an oxygen-scavenging system (0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase (Sigma), 85 mg/mL

225

catalase (Merck), and 0.8% (v/v) glucose (Sigma)).

226

Single-molecule data acquisition and analysis

227

CCD images of time resolution 0.1 or 0.3 sec were recorded, and time traces were extracted from the

228

CCD image series using IDL (ITT Visual Information Solution). Co-localization between Cy3 and Cy5

229

signals was carried out with a custom-made mapping algorithm written in IDL. The extracted time traces

230

were processed using Matlab (MathWorks) and Origin (Origin Lab).

231

The binding rate (kon) was determined by first measuring the time between when CbAgo binary complex

232

was introduced to a microfluidic chamber and when the first CbAgo- guide docked to a target; and then

233

fitting the time distribution with a single-exponential growth curve, 𝐴(1 − 𝑒 −𝑘𝑜𝑛 𝑡 ). The dissociation rate

234

was estimated by measuring the dwell time of a binding event. A dwell time distribution was fitted by

235

single-exponential decay curve (𝐴𝑒 −𝑡/Δ𝜏 ).

236

Fluorescence competition experiments

237

MBP-tagged CbAgo was immobilized on the quartz surface using an anti-MBP antibody. An equimolar

238

mixture of let7 DNA guide (Cy3 labeled) and let7 RNA guide (Cy5 labeled) in imaging buffer was

239

introduced to the microfluidic chamber. After 5 minutes, 10 snapshots of independent fields of view

240

with simultaneous illumination were collected to estimate the amount of guide molecules bound to

241

protein. Movies were taken for 200 s (2000 frames) at continuous illumination of Cy3 and Cy5

242

molecules to determine the dwell times of the binding events. Dwell times were binned in a histogram

243

and fitted with a single exponential decay curve.

244

FRET targeting experiments of ATTT and AAAA guide target combinations

245

100 pM of target construct annealed with biotin handle were flushed in the microfluidic chamber. After

246

incubation of 1 min, the microfluidic chamber was rinsed with 100 µL T50 buffer. 10 nM of apo-CbAgo

247

was loaded with 1 nM of ATTT seed DNA guide or with AAAA seed DNA guide at 37°C for 30 minutes

248

in imaging buffer after which the mixture is introduced inside the microfluidic chamber. Movies of 200 s

249

were taken at continuous illumination of the Cy3 signal. Site specific protein target interactions were

250

identified as FRET signals and were further analysed.

Results

266

CbAgo mediates siDNA-guided ssDNA cleavage

267

CbAgo was successfully expressed in E. coli from a codon-optimized gene using a T7-based pET

268

expression system and purified (Supplementary Figure S1A). To determine the guide and target binding

269

characteristics of CbAgo, we performed single-molecule experiments using Förster resonance energy

270

transfer (FRET). We immobilized either Cy5-labeled single stranded RNA or DNA targets (FRET

271

acceptor) on a polymer-coated quartz surface (Figure 1A). Next we introduced CbAgo in complex with

272

either a Cy3-labeled siRNA or siDNA guide (FRET donor) and recorded the interactions. Strikingly,

273

CbAgo could utilize both siRNAs and siDNAs to bind DNA or RNA targets (Figure 1B). To test which

274

guide is preferentially bound by CbAgo we performed a competition assay in which CbAgo was

275

immobilized into the microfluidic chamber, and an equimolar mixture of siDNA and siRNAs was

276

introduced. While only short-lived interactions (average dwell time: 0.48 seconds) were observed for

277

siRNA, siDNA was strongly bound (average dwell time: 44 seconds) by CbAgo (Figure 1C). This results

278

suggests that CbAgo utilizes siDNA rather than siRNA as a guide.

279

CbAgo is phylogenetically closest related to the clade of halobacterial pAgos, among which also

280

pAgo from Natronobacterium gregoryi (NgAgo) can be found (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S2).

281

A multiple sequence alignment of CbAgo with other pAgos (Supplementary Figure S1B) suggests that

282

CbAgo contains the conserved DEDX catalytic residues (where X can be a D, H or N) which are essential

283

for nuclease activity in ‘slicing’ Agos32. In the case of CbAgo, this concerns residues D541, E577, D611

284

and D727.

285

To confirm whether CbAgo indeed is an active nuclease, we performed in vitro activity assays

286

in which CbAgo was loaded with either synthetic siDNAs or siRNAs (21 nucleotides in length). Next the

287

complexes were incubated at 37°C with 45-nucleotide complementary single stranded RNA or DNA

288

target oligonucleotides. While no activity was found in any of the combinations in which siRNAs or target

289

RNAs were used, CbAgo was able to cleave target DNAs in a siDNA-dependent manner (Figure 1E). In

290

agreement with the predicted DEDD catalytic site (Supplementary Figure S1B), alanine substitutions of

291

two of aspartic acids (D541A, D611A) in the expected catalytic tetrad abolished the nuclease activity,

292

demonstrating that the observed siDNA-guided ssDNA endonucleolytic activity was indeed catalyzed

293

by the DEDD catalytic site. To further investigate the full temperature range at which CbAgo is active,

294

we performed additional cleavage assays at temperatures ranging from 10-95°C. While CbAgo

295

displayed the highest activity at its physiologically relevant temperature (37°C), CbAgo also catalyzed

296

siDNA-guided target DNA cleavage at temperatures as low as 10°C and as high as 50°C (Figure 1F).

electrophoresis. (F) CbAgo displays highest activity at 37°C. CbAgo and siDNA were mixed and pre-incubated at

317
318

When CbAgo-siDNA complexes and target ssDNA substrates (45nt) were mixed in equimolar amounts,

319

cleavage of the target DNA was not complete after one hour incubation (Figure 1E). Therefore, we

320

investigated the substrate turnover kinetics of CbAgo by monitoring the cleavage assays in a time course

321

using variable CbAgo:siDNA:target DNA ratios (Figure 1G). A rapid burst of activity was observed during

322

the first minute, likely indicating the first target binding and cleavage event. This stage was followed by

323

a slow steady state, suggesting that under these conditions the CbAgo-siDNA complex slowly

324

dissociates from the cleaved target DNA product before being able to bind and cleave a new target DNA

325

strand. The cleavage kinetics were confirmed using single-molecule assays which demonstrated that

326

the CbAgo-siDNA complex remains bound to the DNA target (N=21) for several minutes (Figure 1H),

327

which prevents CbAgo-siDNA complexes from binding and cleaving new DNA targets. Thus, while

328

CbAgo functions as a multi-turnover nuclease enzyme, its steady-state rate is limited by product release.

Structure of CbAgo in the cleavage-competent conformation

CbAgoDM in complex with both a 21-nt siDNA and a 19-nt DNA target, and solved the structure of the

335

complex at 3.54 Å resolution (Figure 2 and Table S1). Like other Agos, CbAgo adopts a bilobed

336

conformation in which one of the lobes comprises the N-terminal, linker L1, and PAZ domains, which

337

are linked by linker L2 to the other lobe comprising the MID and PIWI domains. Nucleotides 2-16 of the

338

siDNA constitute a 15 base-pairs A-form-like duplex with the target DNA (Figure 2A). The 5’-terminal

339

nucleotide of the siDNA is anchored in the MID domain pocket, where the 5’-phosphate group of the

340

siDNA makes numerous interactions with MID domain residues and the C-terminal carboxyl group of

341

CbAgo (Supplementary Figure S3). To test whether the interactions with the 5’-phosphate group of the

342

siDNA are important for CbAgo activity, we performed target DNA cleavage assays in which we used

343

siDNAs with a 5’ phosphate or a 5’ hydroxyl group (Supplementary Figure S4). As observed for other

344

pAgos33,34, CbAgo is able to utilize both siDNAs for target DNA cleavage, but it cleaves target DNA

345

much more efficiently when the siDNA contains a 5’-phosphate group. This is in agreement with the

346

siDNA-protein interactions observed in the crystal structure. Furthermore, the backbone phosphates of

347

the siDNA seed segment form hydrogen-bonding and ionic interactions with specific residues in the MID,

348

PIWI and L1 domains (Supplementary Figure S3). At the distal end of the siDNA-target DNA duplex, the

349

N-domain residue His35 caps the duplex by stacking onto the last base pair. After this point, the

350

remaining 3’-terminal nucleotides of the siDNA are unordered, while the target DNA bends away from

351

the duplex and enters the cleft between the N-terminal and PAZ domains. In agreement with other

352

ternary pAgo complexes18,35,36, the PAZ domain pocket, which normally binds the 3’ end of the guide in

353

a binary Ago-guide complex, is empty.

354

CbAgo is phylogenetically closely related to TtAgo (Figure 1D). However, CbAgo is 63 amino

355

acids (9.2%) longer than TtAgo (748 amino acids vs. 685 amino acids) and CbAgo and TtAgo share

356

only 23% sequence identity. Superposition of the CbAgo complex structure with the structure of TtAgo

357

bound to a siDNA and DNA target (PDB: 4NCB) (Figure 2C) reveals that the macromolecular

358

architecture and conformation of these TtAgo and CbAgo structures are highly similar (Core root mean

359

square deviation of 3.0 Å over 563 residues), with differences found mostly in the loop regions. This

360

agrees with the fact that loops of thermostable proteins are generally more compact and shorter37,38. In

361

the TtAgo structure, which is thought to represent a catalytically competent state, a ‘glutamate finger’

362

side chain (Glu512TtAgo) is inserted into the catalytic site completing the catalytic DDED tetrad 35.

363

Similarly, the corresponding residue in CbAgo (Glu577) is located within a flexible loop and is positioned

364

near the other catalytic residues (Figure 2D; Asp541, Asp611, and Asp727). All pAgos and eAgos

365

characterized to date cleave the target strand in between nucleotide 10 and 11 of the target strand. In

366

line with the consensus, the catalytic residues of CbAgo perfectly align with the scissile phosphate

367

linking these nucleotides in our structure (Figure 2D). This observation implies that this structure

368

represents the cleavage competent conformation of CbAgo.

369

Only 15 siDNA-target DNA base pairs are formed in the complex, which suggests that

370

additional siDNA-target DNA binding is not essential for target DNA cleavage. To determine the

371

minimum siDNA length that CbAgo requires for target binding, we performed single-molecule

372

fluorescence assays. First, CbAgo was immobilized on a surface and next it was incubated with 5’-

373

phosphorylated Cy3-labelled siDNAs (Figure 2E). These assays demonstrate that CbAgo can bind

374

siDNAs with a minimal length of 12 nucleotides. Next, we determined the minimum siDNA length for

375

CbAgo-siDNA mediated target DNA cleavage (Figure 2F). In line with the observation that the CbAgo

376

adopts a cleavage-competent confirmation when only 14 base pairs are formed, CbAgo can cleave

377

target DNAs when programmed with siDNAs as short as 14 nt (forming 13 siDNA-target DNA base

378

pairs) under the tested conditions. This resembles the activity of PfAgo, MjAgo, and MpAgo, which

379

require siDNAs with a minimal length of 15 nt to catalyze target DNA cleavage14,15,34. Only TtAgo has

380

been reported to mediate target DNA cleavage with siDNAs as short as 9 nt12.

CbAgo associates with plasmid-derived siDNAs in vivo

401

It has previously been demonstrated that certain pAgos co-purify with their guides and/or targets during

402

heterologous expression in Escherichia coli13,16. To determine whether CbAgo also acquires siDNAs

403

during expression, we isolated and analyzed the nucleic acid fraction that co-purified with CbAgo.

404

Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that CbAgo co-purified with small nucleotides

405

with a length of ~12-19 nucleotides (Figure 3A). These nucleic acids were susceptible to DNase I but

406

not to RNase A treatment, indicating that CbAgo acquires 12-19 nucleotide long siDNAs in vivo, which

407

fits with its observed binding and cleavage activities in vitro (Figure 1 and 2).

408

We cloned and sequenced the siDNAs that co-purified with CbAgo to determine their exact

409

length and sequence. The majority of the siDNAs had a length of 16 nucleotides and are complementary

410

to the plasmid used for expression of CbAgo (Figure 3B and 3C). Likewise the siRNAs and siDNAs that

411

co-purify with respectively Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsAgo) and TtAgo are also mostly

412

complementary to their expression plasmids13,16. As both TtAgo and RsAgo have been demonstrated to

413

interfere with plasmid DNA, this suggests that also CbAgo might play a role in protecting its host against

414

invading DNA. However, no significant reduction of plasmid content could be detected during or upon

415

expression of CbAgo in E. coli (Supplementary Figure S6). We also investigated whether CbAgo co-

416

purified with nucleic acids that were enriched for certain motifs. Sequence analysis revealed that most

417

siDNAs co-purified with CbAgo contain a deoxyadenosine at their 5’ ends (Figure 3D). In addition, we

418

observed an enrichment of thymidine nucleotides in the three positions directly downstream of the siDNA

419

5’ end (nt 2-4) (Figure 3D).

431

The sequence of the siDNA affects CbAgo activity

432

To investigate if the 5’-terminal nucleotide of the siDNA affects the activity of CbAgo, we performed

433

cleavage assays. CbAgo was loaded with siDNA guides with varied nucleotides at position 1 (g1N) and

434

incubated with complementary target DNAs (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, the highest cleavage rates were

435

observed when CbAgo was loaded with siDNAs containing a 5’-T, followed by siDNAs containing 5’-A.

436

CbAgo bound 5’-G or 5’-C siDNAs displayed slightly lower initial cleavage rates. Also for other pAgos

437

the g1N preference observed in vivo is not reflected in the in vitro activities; TtAgo (which preferentially

438

co-purifies with g1C siDNAs) as well as PfAgo and MpAgo (of which the in vivo g1N preferences are

439

unknown) demonstrate no clear preference for a specific g1N during in vitro cleavage reactions13,17,34.

440

Instead, the preference of TtAgo for 5’-C siDNAs is determined by specific recognition of a guanosine

441

nucleotide in the corresponding position (t1) in the target DNA17. Indeed, TtAgo structures and models

18

442

have revealed base-specific interactions with target strand guanine, while base-specific interactions with

443

the 5’-terminal cytidine in the siDNA are less obvious17. Similarly, we observe no obvious base-specific

444

interactions with the 5’-terminal cytidine in the structure of the CbAgo complex (Supplementary Figure

445

S7). When we investigated potential base-specific interactions with the base at the opposing target

446

strand t1 position, we observed that the t1 thymine base is not placed in the t1 binding pocket as has

447

been observed in TtAgo, RsAgo and hAGO217,39,40. Instead, the thymine bases is flipped and stacks on

448

Phe557 that also caps the siDNA-target DNA duplex (Supplementary Figure S7). At present, we are

449

unable to rationalize the preferential co-purification of 5’-adenosine siDNAs with CbAgo.

450

In order to characterize the seed segment of CbAgo, and to test whether the seed length

451

changes depending on the nature of the guide and the target (i.e. DNA vs. RNA), we performed

452

additional single-molecule binding assays. The length of seed was determined based on the minimal

453

number of complementary nucleotide pairs between guide and target that were required to achieve a

454

stable binding event. We first tested the sub-seed (nt 2-4), a 3-nt motif involved in initial target recognition

455

in hAgo241,42. When only the sub-seed segment of the siDNA is complementary to the DNA and RNA

456

targets, CbAgo-siDNA complexes bound to the DNA target with an average dwell time 58-fold longer

457

compared to RNA target-binding (Figure 4B). When nt 2-7 of the guide were complementary to the

458

target, the CbAgo-siDNA complex stably bound to both to target DNA and RNA beyond our observation

459

time of 300 s. This suggests CbAgo prefers DNA targets above RNA targets and that the seed segment

460

of the siDNAs bound by CbAgo comprises nucleotides 2-7.

461

Next, we set out to investigate whether CbAgo displays a preference for siDNAs with a TTT

462

sub-seed (nt 2-4) in vitro, similar to the observed sequence preference for siDNAs that co-purified with

463

CbAgo in vivo. CbAgo was incubated with siDNAs in which the sub-seed was varied and complementary

464

target DNAs were added. In contrast to the 5’-base preference, the TTT sub-seed preference that we

465

observed in vivo is also reflected in vitro: CbAgo displays the highest target cleavage rates when

466

programmed with TTT sub-seed siDNAs (Figure 4C). To confirm these findings, we performed single-

467

molecule assays in which we compared the target binding properties of CbAgo-siDNA complexes

468

containing siDNAs with either a TTT or an AAA sub-seed segment. These assays demonstrate that the

469

dwell time of CbAgo loaded with a TTT sub-seed siDNA on a target was 18-fold longer compared to

470

CbAgo loaded with siDNA containing an AAA sub-seed (Figure 4D). Combined, these data indicate that

471

CbAgo displays a preference for siDNAs containing a TTT sub-seed segment.

487

A pair of CbAgo-siDNA complexes can cleave double stranded DNA

488

Thermophilic pAgos have successfully been used to generate double stranded DNA breaks in plasmid

489

DNA13,15. As each pAgo-siDNA complex targets and cleaves a single strand of DNA only, two individual

490

pAgo-siDNA complexes are required for dsDNA cleavage, each targeting another strand of the target

491

dsDNA. Although all pAgos characterized so far appear to lack the ability to actively unwind or displace

492

a dsDNA duplex substrate, it has been proposed that, at least in vitro, thermophilic pAgos rely on

493

elevated temperatures (>65 °C) to facilitate local melting of the dsDNA targets to target each strand of

494

the DNA individually. However, CbAgo is derived from a mesophilic organism and we therefore

495

hypothesize that it is able to mediate protection against invading DNA at moderate temperatures (37°C).

496

To test if CbAgo can indeed cleave dsDNA targets at 37°C, we incubated apo-CbAgo and pre-

497

assembled CbAgo-siDNA complexes with a target plasmid. Previous studies showed that the ‘chopping’

498

activity of siDNA-free apo-TtAgo and apo-MjAgo can result in plasmid linearization or degradation,

499

respectively14,17. We observed that apo-CbAgo converted the plasmid substrate from a supercoiled to

500

open-circular state, possibly by nicking one of the strands, but did not observe significant linearization

501

or degradation of the plasmid DNA (Figure 5A). When the plasmid was targeted by CbAgo loaded with

502

a single siDNA, we also observed loss of supercoiling (Figure 5A). As this activity was not observed with

503

nuclease-deficient CbAgoDM, we conclude that apo-CbAgo and CbAgo-siDNA complexes are generate

504

nicks in dsDNA plasmid targets with their DEDD catalytic site. When using two CbAgo-siDNA

505

complexes, each targeting one strand of the plasmid, we observed that a fraction of the target plasmid

506

DNA becomes linearized (Figure 5A). This implies that CbAgo-siDNA complex-mediated nicking of each

507

of the target plasmid DNA strands resulted in the generation of a double stranded DNA break. Next, we

508

investigated if the spacing between the two siDNAs affects the ability of CbAgo to cleave the plasmid.

509

The most efficient plasmid linearization was achieved when the siDNAs were orientated exactly or

510

almost opposite to each other (Figure 5A).

511

Finally, we investigated whether the GC-content of the target DNA plays a role during DNA

512

targeting by CbAgo. For TtAgo, it has been observed that AT-rich DNA is cleaved more efficiently than

513

GC-rich DNA17. To test if such preference also exists for CbAgo, we designed a target plasmid

514

containing 16 gene fragments of 100 base pairs complementary to sequences from the human genome,

515

with an increasing GC content (Figure 5B). CbAgo-siDNA complexes were only able to generate dsDNA

516

in gene fragments with a GC-content of 31% or lower (Figure 5C). This indicates that, at least in vitro,

517

the GC-content is an important factor that determines target DNA cleavage by CbAgo.

Discussion

534

Several prokaryotic Argonaute proteins have been demonstrated to protect their host against invading

535

nucleic acids, such as plasmid DNA13,15,16. Similar to TtAgo and RsAgo, CbAgo co-purifies with guides

536

which are preferentially acquired from the plasmid used for its heterologous expression in E. coli. In

537

addition, CbAgo mediates programmable DNA-guided DNA cleavage in vitro. This suggests that, similar

538

to the phylogenetically related TtAgo, also CbAgo can interfere with plasmid DNA via DNA-guided DNA

539

interference.

540

Sequencing of the nucleic acids that co-purified with CbAgo revealed that CbAgo preferentially

541

associates with siDNAs with a 5’-ATTT-3’ sequence at their 5’ end. It was previously shown that the

542

guide RNA utilized by eAgos can be divided into functional segments. These segments are (from 5’ to

543

3’) the anchor nucleotide (nt 1), the seed (nt 2-8) and sub-seed segments (nt 2-4), and the central (nt 9-

544

12), 3’ supplementary (nt 13-16) and tail (nt 17-21) segments41,43. Extending this knowledge to the

545

siDNAs that co-purified with CbAgo, CbAgo preferentially associates with siDNAs that have a 5’-terminal

546

adenosine anchor (nt 1) and a T-rich sub-seed. In RNAi pathways, the preference for a specific 5’-

547

terminal nucleotide is important for guide RNA loading into a subset of eAgos44–46 Similarly, several

548

pAgos including RsAgo, TtAgo, and now CbAgo also preferentially associate with specific 5’-terminal

549

nucleotides in vivo13,16. However, for both CbAgo and TtAgo, there is no clear preference for siDNAs

550

with that specific 5’-base during cleavage assays in vitro. Rather than having a functional importance,

551

the preference of pAgos for a specific nucleotide at the siDNA 5’ end might be a consequence of siDNA

552

generation and/or loading, as has been demonstrated for TtAgo17. Several studies on human Ago2 have

553

described the importance of the sub-seed segment (nt 2-4) in its RNA guides41,42,47. For hAgo2, a

554

complete match between the guide RNA sub-seed segment and the target RNA triggers a

555

conformational change that first exposes the remainder of the seed (nt 5-8), and eventually the rest of

556

the guide. This facilitates progressive base paring between the guide RNA and the target48. However, a

557

specific nucleotide preference in the sub-seed segment, as we have observed for CbAgo, has not been

558

described for any other Argonaute protein. The preference for the T-rich sub-seed is not only observed

559

in the in vivo acquired siDNAs, but also plays a clear role during target binding and cleavage assays in

560

vitro. This may reflect a structural preference for these thymidines in the cleft of the PIWI domain. We

561

have not been able to obtain diffracting crystals of CbAgo in complex with siDNAs that have a 5’-ATTT-

562

3’ sequence at the 5’-end. Future research will thus be necessary to determine the structural basis the

563

apparent preference for these nucleotides at these positions. We hypothesize that this bias might reflect

564

the mesophilic nature of CbAgo, which might have better access to AT-rich dsDNA fragments, both for

565

siDNA acquisition and for target cleavage.

566

Several DNA-targeting pAgos have been repurposed for a range of molecular applications

567

among which a cloning, recombineering and nucleic acid-detection method22,23,49,50. Additionally, the

568

potential repurposing of pAgos for genome editing applications has previously been discussed27.

569

However, all characterized DNA-cleaving pAgos to date originate from thermophilic prokaryotes and are

570

solely active at elevated temperatures, which limits the potential repurposing of pAgos for applications

571

that require moderate temperatures, such as genome editing. The biochemical characterization of

572

CbAgo reported herein is the first example of a pAgo that catalyzes siDNA-guided dsDNA cleavage at

573

37°C, indicating that the pool of mesophilic pAgos contains candidates that – in theory - can be utilized

574

for potential applications that require moderate temperatures, such as genome editing. . If CbAgo or

575

other mesophilic pAgos could be harnessed for genome editing, they will have certain advantages over

576

the currently well-established genome editing tools CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a; While

577

CRISPR-based genome editing tools can be programmed with a guide RNA to target DNA sequences

578

of choice, target DNA cleavage additionally requires the presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)

579

next to the targeted sequence (5’-NGG-3’ for Cas9 and 5’-TTTV-3’ for Cas12a)51. This limits the possible

580

target sites of Cas9 and Cas12a. In contrast, pAgos do not require a PAM for DNA targeting, which

581

would make them much more versatile tools compared to CRISPR-associated nucleases. However,

582

PAM binding by Cas9 and Cas12a also promotes unwinding of dsDNA targets52–54 which subsequently

583

facilitates strand displacement by the RNA guide, and eventually R-Loop formation. The absence of

584

such mechanism in pAgos might explain their limited nuclease activity on dsDNA targets.

585

Here, we have demonstrated that CbAgo does not strictly rely on other proteins when targeting

586

AT-rich dsDNA sequences in vitro. As such, this study provides a foundation for future efforts to improve

587

double stranded DNA target accessibility of pAgos and to facilitate the further development of pAgo-

588

based applications at moderate temperatures.
