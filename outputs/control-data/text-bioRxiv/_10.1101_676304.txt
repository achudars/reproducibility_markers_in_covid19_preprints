Chloroplasts are unique organelles within plant cells and are ultimately responsible for
sustaining life forms on the earth due to their ability to conduct photosynthesis. Multiple
functional genes within the chloroplast are responsible for a variety of metabolic processes that
occur in the chloroplast. Considering its fundamental role in sustaining life on earth, it is
important to identify the level of diversity present in the chloroplast genome, what genes and
genomic content have been lost, what genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome,
duplication events, and the overall origin and evolution of the chloroplast genome. Our analysis
of 2511 chloroplast genomes indicated that the genome size and number of CDS in the
chloroplasts of algae are higher relative to other lineages. Approximately 10.31% of the
examined species have lost the inverted repeats (IR) that span across the lineages that comprise
algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperm, angiosperms, magnoliids, and protists. Genomewide analyses revealed that the loss of the RBCL gene in parasitic and heterotrophic plant
species occurred approximately 56 Ma ago. PsaM, Psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, and RPL21 were
found to be characteristic signature genes of algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and
gymnosperms; while none of these genes were found in the angiosperm or magnoliid lineage
which appeared to have lost them approximately 203-156 Ma ago. A variety of chloroplast
encoding genes were lost across different species lineages throughout the evolutionary process.
The Rpl20 gene, however, was found to be the most stable and intact gene in the chloroplast
genome and was not lost in any of the analysed species; suggesting that it is a signature gene of
the plastome. Our evolutionary analysis indicated that chloroplast genomes evolved from
multiple common ancestors and have undergone significant recombination events across
different taxonomic lineages. Additionally, our findings support the hypothesis that these
recombination events are the most probable cause behind the dynamic loss of chloroplast genes
and inverted repeats in different species.

Photosynthesis is a process by which autotrophic plants utilize chlorophyll to transform solar
energy into chemical energy. Almost all life forms depend directly or indirectly on this chemical
energy as a source of energy to sustain growth, development, and reproduction of their species.
This essential process occurs inside a semi-autonomous organelle, commonly known as a plastid
or chloroplast. Current knowledge indicates that the origin and evolution of plastids occurred
through the endosymbiosis of ancestral cyanobacteria with non-photosynthesizing cells that
dates back to 1.5 to 1.6 billion years ago [1,2]. The subsequent divergence of a green plastid
lineage occurred prior to 1.2 billion years ago and led to the development of land plants
approximately 432 to 476 million years ago, and to seed plants around 355 to 370 million years
ago [2]. A subsequent split into gymnosperms and angiosperms occurred approximately 290 to
320 million years ago and the divergence of monocots and eudicots within the angiosperm
lineage occurred approximately 90 to 130 million years ago [2]. Throughout this evolutionary
time scale, the endosymbiont retained its existence inside the cell and its dominant function of
photosynthesis without undergoing any evolutionary changes. In addition to photosynthesis, this
semi-autonomous organelle also plays an important role in the biosynthesis of amino acids,
lipids, carotenoids, and other important biomolecules. Studies indicate that the plastid genome
has retained a complete set of protein synthesizing machinery and encodes approximately 100
proteins. All other proteins required by the chloroplast, however, are encoded by the nuclear
genome. All of the protein synthesis and photosynthetic machinery used by the plastid is
encoded by its own genome, commonly referred to as the plastome, that is arranged in a
quadripartite structure. The size of the plastid genome of land plants is reported to range from
120 to 190 kb [3–5]. The quadripartite structure consists of four main segments, referred to as
the small single copy region (SSC), large single copy region (LSC), and the inverted repeat A
and B (IRA and IRB) regions [6]. The size of the IR region ranges from 10-15 kb in non-seed
plants to 20-30 kb in angiosperms [6–9]. The IR A and B regions are reported to share a
conserved molecular evolutionary pattern [10,11]. Studies also indicate that the genes in the
plastome genome are organized in an operon or operon-like structure that undergoes
transcription, producing polycistronic precursors [12]. The majority of genes in the chloroplast
genome have been either functionally transferred to the nuclear genome or lost during evolution
[13,14]. For example, the functional genes tufA, ftsH, odpB, and Rpl5 have been transferred from
the plastome to the nucleus [15,16]. Structural rearrangements of the plastid genome have
occurred throughout its’ evolution; resulting in expansion, contraction, or loss of genetic content
[5]. These events have occurred multiple times during the evolution of the chloroplast and can be
specific to a single species, or sometimes to a whole plant order [7,17–20]. Changes in the
architecture of the IR regions can affect the entire plastid chromosome and its immediate
neighbourhood. For example, several genes associated with the SC region got duplicated,
including Ycf2, due to the relocation of the IR region [5]. Although several analyses of the
plastid genome have been conducted, a comprehensive comparative study of the plastid genome
at a large-scale has not yet been reported. Comparative studies have thus far only included a few
species of an order or a few species from a few different groups. Therefore, a large-scale
analysis of 2357 chloroplast genomes was conducted to better understand the genomics and
evolution of the plastid genome. Details of the novel genomic features of the chloroplast genome
are reported in the present study.

A study of 2511 chloroplast genomes was conducted to gain insight into the genomic structure and
evolution of the chloroplast genome. The analysis included the complete genome sequences of algae
(335), austrobaileyales (2), bryophytes (24), chloranthales (2), corals (2), eudicots (1314), Flacourtiaceae
(1), gymnosperms (95), magnoliids (67), monocots (570), nymphaeales (14), opisthokonta (1), protists
(31), pteridophytes (52), and an unclassified chloroplast genome (1) (Supplementary File 1). A
comparison of the analysed genomes indicated that Haematococcus lacustris encoded the largest
chloroplast genome, comprising 1.352 Mbs; while Asarum minus encoded the smallest chloroplast
genome, comprising 0.0155 Mbs (Figure 1). The overall average size of the chloroplast genome was
found to be 0.152 Mbs. The order of the average size (Mbs) of the chloroplast genome in different plant
groups was 0.164 (algae), 0.160 (Nymphaeales), 0.154 (eudicot), 0.154 (Magnoliid), 0.149
(pteridophyte), 0.144 (monocot), 0.134 (bryophyte), 0.131 (gymnosperm), and 0.108 (protist). The
average chloroplast genome size in algae (0.164 Mbs) and the Nymphaeales (0.160 Mbs) was larger than
it was in eudicots (0.154 Mbs), monocots (0.144 Mbs), and gymnosperms (0.131 Mbs). The average size
of the protist chloroplast genome (0.108 Mbs) was found to be the smallest. Principal component analysis
(PCA) of the chloroplast genome size of algae, bryophytes, eudicots, gymnosperms, magnoliids,
monocots, Nymphaeales, protists, and pteridophytes reveals a clear distinction between the different plant
groups (Figure 2). The size of the chloroplast genome of gymnosperm and bryophytes grouped together;
and eudicots, magnoliids, and pteridophytes grouped together. In contrast, the algae and protists were
independently grouped (Figure 2).

The number of coding sequences (CDS) in the analyzed chloroplast genomes ranged from 273 (Pinus
koraiensis) to 4 (Monoraphidium neglectum) (Figure 1). The overall average of number of CDS in the
chloroplast genome was found to be 91.67 per genome. Some other species, however, were found to
contain a higher number of CDS in the chloroplast genome; including Grateloupia filicina (233),
Osmundaria fimbriata (224), Porphyridium purpureum (224), Lophocladia kuetzingii (221), Kuetzingia
canaliculata (218), Spyridia filamentosa (218), Bryothamnion seaforthii (216) and others (Supplementary
File 1). Similarly, some of the species were found to encode a lower number of CDS in the chloroplast
genome; including Asarum minus (7), Cytinus hypocistis (15), Sciaphila densiflora (18), Gastrodia elata
(20), Burmannia oblonga (22), Orobanche gracilis (24), and others (Supplementary File 1). PCA analysis
indicated that the number of CDS in bryophytes, eudicots, magnoliids, monocots, and pteridophytes
grouped together (Figure 3). The number of CDS in algae, gymnosperms, and protists grouped very
distantly from the above-mentioned grouping (Figure 3).

The GC content of the analysed chloroplast genomes ranged from a high of 57.66% (Trebouxiophyceae
sp. MX-AZ01) to a low of 23.25% (Bulboplastis apyrenoidosa) (Figure 4, Supplementary File 1). The
average GC content in the chloroplast genome was 36.87%. Some species contained a higher percentage
of GC content, including Paradoxia multiseta (50.58%), Haematococcus lacustris (49.88%), Chromerdia
sp. RM11 (47.74%), Elliptochloris bilobata (45.76%), Choricystis parasitica (45.44%) and others. On
the other hand, some species had a lower percentage of GC content, including Ulva prolifera (24.78%),
Ulva linza (24.78%), Ulva fasciata (24.86%), Ulva flexuosa (24.97%), and others (Supplementary File
1). PCA analysis revealed that the percentage GC content of eudicots, gymnosperms, magnoliids,
monocots, and Nymphaeales grouped together, and the percentage of GC content in algae and protists
also grouped together (Figure 5). The percentage GC content in bryophytes and pteridophytes did not
group with the algae and protists or the eudicots, gymnosperms, magnoliids, monocots, or Nymphaeales
(Figure 5).

The PsaM protein is subunit XII of photosystem I. Among the 2511 studied species, 94 were found to
possess the PsaM gene. All of the species those found to possess the PsaM gene were algae, bryophytes,
pteridophytes, or gymnosperms (Supplementary File 2). Notably, no species in the angiosperm lineage
possessed the PsaM gene; clearly indicating that the PsaM gene was lost in the angiosperm lineage. The
size of the PsaM deduced proteins ranged from 22 to 33 amino acids. The deduced molecular weight
(MW) of PsaM protein ranged from 3.568 kDa in Mesotaenium endlicherianum to 1.59 kDa in P.
bungeana, while the isoelectric point ranged from 3.37 in Taxodium distichum to 9.95 in P. bungeana.
The MW of PsaM proteins in species of Picea were smaller than the Cycas, Ginkgo, and species from
bryophytes, pteridophytes, and algae. The PsaM protein was found to contain the characteristic conserved
amino acid motif Q-x3-A-x3-A-F-x3-I-L-A-x2-L-G-x2-L-Y (Supplementary Figure 1). A few species,
including Cephalotaxus, Podocarpus tortara, Retrophyllum piresii, Dacrycarpus imbricatus,
Glyptostrobus pensilis, T. distichum, Cryptomeria japonica, Pinus contorta, Pinus taeda, and Ptilidium
pulcherrimum, however, did not contain the conserved amino acid motif. Instead, they possessed the
conserved motif, F-x-S-x3-C-F-x4-F-S-x2-I (Supplementary Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that
PsaM genes grouped into five independent clusters, suggesting that they have evolved independently
from multiple common ancestors (Supplementary Figure 2A). Duplication and deletion analysis of PsaM
genes revealed that deletion events were more predominant than the duplication or co-divergence events
(Table 1). Among the 84 analysed PsaM genes, 12 had undergone duplication and 34 had undergone
deletions, while 34 genes had undergone co-divergence (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2B). The upper
and lower boundaries of the time of each duplication and co-divergence revealed that the
Jugermanniopsida, Pinaceae, and Streptophyta were in the upper boundary while the Eukaryota,
Pinaceae, Streptophyta, Cycadales, Podocarpaceae, Apopellia endiviifolia, and Zygnematophyceae were
in the lower boundary (Supplementary Figure 2B). The lower boundary represents the oldest species
where duplications must have occurred and the upper boundary represents the most recent species where
duplication events are not present.

Psb30 encodes the Ycf12 protein, which is essential for the functioning of the photosystem II reaction
centre. The size of the translated protein in the analysed chloroplast genomes ranged from 24 (Pinus
nelsonii) to 34 amino acids (Isoetes flaccida). The MW of Ycf12 ranged from 3.75 kDa in Schizaea
pectinata to 2.46 kDa in P. nelsonii and the predicted isoelectric point ranged from 3.13 in P. nelsonii to
10.613 in Cylindrocystis brebissonii. A multiple sequence alignment revealed the presence of a conserved
consensus amino acid sequence, N-x-E-x3-Q-L-x2-L-x6-G-P-L-V-I (Supplementary Figure 3). A total of
164 species were found to possess psb30 gene and all of the species were belonged to algae, bryophytes,
pteridophytes, or gymnosperms (Supplementary File 2). Psb30 was absent in the chloroplast genome of
angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis of Psb30 genes resulted in the designation of two major clusters and
six minor clusters, suggesting that it evolved from multiple common ancestors (Supplementary Figure
4A). Deletion/duplication analysis indicated that 39 Psb30 genes had undergone a duplication event and
120 had undergone a deletion event, while 49 were found to be co-diverged (Table 1, Supplementary
Figure 4B). The upper boundary species, where duplication events were absent, belonged to the
Streptophyta, Pinaceae, Polypodiopsida, Mesotaeniaceae, Zygnematophyceae, Zamiaceae, and
Eukaryota. Species in the lower boundary group, where duplication events must have occurred, belonged
to the Eukaryota, Streptophyta, Pinaceae, Cathaya argyrophylla, Cycadales, Dioon spinulosum,
Anthoceros formosae, Pteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, Polypodiales, Zygnematales, C. brebissonii, and
Viridiplantae.

ChlB encodes a light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase. A total of 288 of the examined
chloroplast genome sequences were found to possess a ChlB gene (Supplementary File 2) among protists,
algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms. The ChlB gene was absent in species in the
Chloranthales, corals, or angiosperm lineage. The predicted size of the ChlB proteins ranged from 724
(Gonium pectorale) to 177 (Welwitschia mirabilis) amino acids. The MW of ChlB protein ranged from
20.99 (W. mirabilis) to 79.89 (G. pectorale) kDa, while the isoelectric point ranged from 5.10 (Sequoia
sempervirens) to 10.74 (S. pectinata). A multiple sequence alignment revealed the presence of several

highly conserved amino acid motifs (Supplementary Figure 8). At least seven conserved motifs were
identified, including A-Y-W-M-Y-A, L-P-K-A-W-F, E-N-Y-I-D-Q-Q, S-Q-A-A-W-F, H-D-A-D-W-F,
E-P-x2-I-F-G-T, E-K-F/Y-A-R-Q-Q, and E-V-M-Y-A-A (Supplementary Figure 5). A phylogenetic
analysis indicated that ChlB genes grouped into two major clusters and thirteen minor clusters, reflecting
multiple evolutionary ancestor (Supplementary Figure 6A). ChlB genes were comprised of a few groups.
Specifically, deletion and duplication analysis revealed that 35 ChlB genes had undergone duplications
and 126 had undergone deletions, while 116 exhibited co-divergence in their evolutionary history (Table
1, Supplementary Figure 6B). The lower time boundary contained species where duplication events must
have occurred. These taxa included members of the Viridiplantae, Streptophyta, Cycadales, D.
spinulosum, Ampelopteris prolifera, Polypodiales, A. endiviifolia, Zygnematophyceae, Chlorophyta,
Trebouxiophyceae, Hydrodictyaceae, Bryopsidales, and Pseudochloris wilhelmii. The upper time
boundary included taxa where duplication events were not present. These included members of the
Streptophyta, Zamiaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Jungermanniopsida, Zygnematophyceae, Chlorophyta,
Trebouxiophyceae, Sphaeropleales, and Ulvophyceae.

ChlL is a light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase iron-sulphur ATP-binding protein that
functions in the reduction of ferredoxin, reducing the D ring of protochlorophyllide to form
chlorophyllide. It plays a role in the light-independent reaction of photosynthesis and the L component
serves as the electron donor to the NB-component. This protein is also involved in light-independent
biosynthesis of chlorophyll. Analysis of the chloroplast genome sequences identified 303 species that
possess ChlL genes (Supplementary File 2). All of the identified species those possess ChlL gene
belonged to algae, bryophytes, gymnosperms, protists, and pteridophytes. None of the taxa in the
angiosperm or magnoliid lineage were found to possess a ChlL gene. Within the protist lineage, only
species in the genera Nannochloropsis, Vaucheria, Triparma, and Alveolata encode a ChlL gene. The
length of the predicted ChlL proteins ranged from 186 amino acids in Pycnococcus provasolii to 299
amino acids in Macrothelypteris torresiana. The MW of ChlL proteins ranged from 20.19 (Pycnococcus
provasolii) to 33.08 (Retrophyllum piresii) kDa, while the isoelectric point ranged from 11.74
(Hypodematium crenatum) to 4.53 (Leptosira terrestris). A multiple sequence alignment revealed the
presence of several highly conserved amino acid motifs, including K-S-T-T-S-C-N-x-S, W-P-E-D-V-I-YQ, K-Y-V-E-A-C-P-M-P, C-D-F-Y-L-N, Q-P-E-G-V-V/I, and S-D-F-Y-L-N (Supplementary Figure 7).
The phylogenetic analysis indicated that ChlL genes grouped into one major independent cluster and
eleven minor clusters, suggesting that they also evolved independently from different common ancestors
(Supplementary Figure 8A). Deletion and duplication analysis indicated that 49 ChlL genes had
undergone duplication events and 184 had undergone deletions, while 100 ChlL genes exhibited codivergence (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 8B). The lower boundary contains taxa where duplication
events must have occurred. These include members of the Viridiplantae, Streptophyta, Cycadales, D.
spinulosum, Polypodiopsida, Pteridaceae, Diplaziopsidaceae, Zygnematophyceae, Chlorophyta,
Hydrodictyaceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and P. wilhelmii. The upper boundary includes taxa where deletion
events must have occurred. These include members of the Streptophyta, Zamiaceae, Polypodiopsida,
Thelypteridaceae, Chlorophyta, and Trebouxiophyceae.

ChlN protein is a dark-operative, light-independent, protochlorophyllide reductase. It utilizes Mg2+-ATP
mediated reduction of ferredoxin to reduce the D ring of protochlorophyllide that is subsequently
converted to chlorophyllide. At least 289 of the analyzed chloroplast genomes possess ChlN genes. These
genomes were from taxa within the protists, algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms
(Supplementary File 2). The length of the predicted ChlN proteins range from 373 (Toxarium undulatum)
to 523 (Chlorella mirabilis) amino acids and have a predicted MW ranging from 44.93 (P. provasolii) to
58.86 (C. mirabilis) kDa, while the isoelectric point ranges from 4.92 (Ginkgo biloba) to 9.83 (R. piresii).
A multiple sequence alignment revealed the presence of highly conserved amino acid motifs, including
N-Y-H-T-F, A-E-L-Y-Q-K-I-E-D-S, M-A-H-R-C-P, and Q-I-H-G-F (Supplementary Figure 9).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ChlN genes group into two independent clusters (Supplementary
Figure 10A). No lineage specific grouping, however, was identified in the phylogenetic tree. Deletion and
duplication analysis indicated that 8 ChlN genes had undergone duplication events, 46 had undergone
deletion events and 34 genes exhibited co-divergence (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 10B). The lower
boundary, which indicates where duplication events must have occurred, contained members of the

Rpl21 protein is a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. The chloroplast genomes of at least 137 of
the examined species were found to possess a RpL21 gene and included taxa within the algae,
bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms (Supplementary File 2). In the majority of cases, however,
the CDS of the Rpl21 genes were truncated. Therefore, only 22 full length CDS were used to identify
deletion and duplication events. Rpl21 proteins were found to contain the conserved amino acid motifs,
Y-A-I-I-D-x-G-G-x-Q-L-R-E-V-x-G-R-F, R-V-L-M-I, G-x-P-W-L, R-I-L-H, and K-x2-I/V-x5-K-K
(Supplementary Figure 11). Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of three clusters, reflecting their
origin from multiple common ancestors (Supplementary Figure 12A). Deletion/duplication analysis
indicted that 3 RpL21 genes had undergone duplication events, 8 had undergone deletion events, and 9
exhibited co-divergence (Table1, Supplementary Figure 12B).

Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (RBCL), the most abundant enzyme of the earth, functions in the
process of carbon fixation during the dark reaction of photosynthesis to produce carbohydrate. The
presence of the RBCL gene and its role in carbon assimilation contributes to the role of plants as
producers in natural ecosystems. Therefore, a characteristic feature of almost all photosynthetic plants is
that their chloroplast genome encodes an RBCL gene to modulate photosynthesis. However, not all the
plants with chloroplasts/plastids, possess an RBCL gene. Among the plant taxa analysed, we identified at
least 17 species that did not encode an RBCL gene in their chloroplast genome. The species lacking an
RBCL gene were Alveolata sp. CCMP3155, A. minus, Bathycoccus prasinos (picoplankton), Burmannia
oblonga (orchid), Codonopsis lanceolate (eudicot), Cytinus hypocistis (parasite), Gastrodia elata
(saprophyte), Monotropa hypopitys (myco-heterotroph), Orobanche austrohispanica (parasite),
Orobanche densiflora (parasite), Orobanche gracilis (parasite), Orobanche pancicii (parasite),
Phelipanche purpurea (parasite), Phelipanche ramosa (parasite), Prototheca cutis (parasitic algae),
Prototheca stagnorum (parasitic algae), and Sciaphila densiflora (myco-heterotroph). The length of the
RBCL protein in taxa that did possess an RBCL gene ranged from 334 (Asterionellopsis glacialis) to 493
(Gossypium australe) amino acids and the MW of the RBCL protein ranged from 36.809
(Nannochloropsis oceanica) to 54.87 (G. australe) kDa; while the isoelectric point ranged from 4.47
(Primula sinensis) to 7.79 (Oogamochlamys gigantea) (Supplementary Figure 13). An analysis of the
composition of the RBCL protein revealed that Ala and Gly were the most abundant amino acids and that
Trp was the least abundant.

Inverted repeats (IR) are one of the major characteristic features of the chloroplast genomes. The analysis
conducted in the present study revealed the deletion of inverted repeats in the chloroplast genome of 259
(10.31%) species from the 2511 species examined (Supplementary File 3). IR deletion events were
identified in protists (14), protozoans (1), algae (126), bryophytes (1), gymnosperms (64), magnoliids (1)
monocots (9), and eudicots (43). The average size of the deleted IR region in algae was 0.177 Mb, which
is larger than the overall size of the chloroplast genome in the respective taxa. The average size of the
deleted IR region in eudicots, monocots, and gymnosperms was 0.124, 0.131, and 0.127 Mb,
respectively, which is smaller than the overall size of the chloroplast genome in the respective lineages.

Phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast genomes containing deleted IR regions produced three major
clusters (Figure 7). Gymnosperms were in the upper cluster (cyan) while the lower cluster (red)
comprised the algae, bryophytes, eudicots, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes. No chloroplast genomes
from monocot plants were present in the lower cluster (Figure 6). The middle cluster contained at least
four major phylogenetic groups (Figure 6). Monocot plants were present in two groups (pink) in the
middle cluster. Gymnosperm (cyan) and eudicot (green) chloroplast genomes were also present in two of
the groups in the middle cluster. Although there was some sporadic distribution of algae in the different
groups of the phylogenetic tree, the majority of the algal species were present in a single group (yellow)
(Figure 6). A phylogenetic tree of taxa with an IR-deleted chloroplast genome and taxa with chloroplast
genomes that did not lose the IR region (Floydiella terrestris, Carteria cerasiformis, B. apyrenoidosa, E.

grouped with the genomes in which the IR region was deleted. Inverted repeats stabilize the chloroplast
genome and the loss of a region of inverted repeats most likely leads to a genetic rearrangement in the
chloroplast genome. The lower cluster (red) contained the oldest group. Genomic recombination analysis
revealed that the chloroplast genomes across different lineages had undergone vivid recombination
(Supplementary Figure 14A and 14B). In addition, the IR deleted chloroplast genomes were also
undergone vivid recombination (Supplementary Figure 15).

Several genes in the chloroplast genome have been subject to deletion events.

The chloroplast genome encodes genes for photosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, transcription, protein
translation, and other important metabolic processes. The major genes involved in such events are AccD
(acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyl transferase), AtpA, AtpB, AtpE, AtpF, AtpH, AtpI, CcsA
(cytochrome C biogenesis protein), CemA (chloroplast envelope membrane), ChlB (light independent
protochlorophyllide reductase), ChlL, ChlN, ClpP (ATP-dependent Clp protease), MatK (maturase K),
NdhA (NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase), NdhB, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF, NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ,

Rps19, Ycf1, Ycf2, Ycf3, and Ycf4. Our analysis of 2511 chloroplast genomes revealed that a number of
these genes were lost in one or more species (Table 2). The analysis indicated that the ribosomal proteins
Rpl and Rpo were lost less frequently than the other chloroplast genes (Table 2). Ndh genes were lost in a
number of different species. Several other genes had been deleted in a considerable number of species
across different lineages. These included AccD (402), AtpF (217), Clp (194), Ycf2 (226), Ycf4 (111),
PetL (248), PetN (125), PsaI (129), PsbM (166), PsbZ (145), Rpl22 (137), Rpl23 (221), Rpl32 (182),
Rpl33 (163), Rps15 (263), and Rps16 (372), where the number in parentheses indicates the number of
taxa in which the gene has been deleted from the chloroplast genome (Table 2).

Chloroplast genomes possess genes that encode at least six different ATP molecules, namely, AtpA,
AtpB, AtpE, AtpF, AtpH, and AtpI. Among the 2511 analysed chloroplast genomes, AtpA, AtpB, AtpE,
AtpF, AtpH, and AtpI were found to be lost in 8, 8, 12, 14, 13, and 12 species, respectively (Table 2,
Supplementary File 4). The loss of Atp genes occurred in algae, eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots,
while no loss of Atp genes occurred in any species of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms
(Supplementary File 4). The AccD gene in chloroplasts, which encodes the beta-carboxyl transferase
subunit of acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACC) complex, was found to be lost from 387 plant species
(Supplementary File 4). The AccD gene was lost in taxa belonging to algae (92 species), eudicots (32
species), gymnosperms (7 species), magnoliids (1 species), monocots (227 species), and protists (27
species), while the AccD gene was found to be present in all bryophytes and pteridophytes.

belonging to the algae (108 species), eudicots (2 species), gymnosperms (3 species), magnoliids (1
species), and protists (28 species). Loss of the ClpP gene was not found in members of bryophytes,
pteridophytes, and monocots (Supplementary File 4). The chloroplast genome possesses at least six
different Psa genes, PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaI, PsaJ, and PsaM (Table). The PsaA gene was absent in 16

The chloroplast genome encodes 12 Rps genes, Rps2, Rps3, Rps4, Rps7, Rps8, Rps11, Rps12, Rps14,
Rps15, Rps16, Rps18, and Rps19 (Table). Our analysis indicated that different Rps genes were lost from a
variety of species (Supplementary Table). Specifically, Rps2 was lost in three species (1 algae, 1 eudicot,
and 1 magnoliid); Rps3 was lost in three species (2 algae and 1 magnoliid); Rps4 was lost in four species
(3 algae and 1 magnoliid); Rps7 was lost in three species (1 algae, 1 gymnosperm, and 1 magnoliid);
Rps8 was lost in three species (1 eudicot, 1 magnoliid, and 1 protist); Rps11 was lost in two species (1
eudicot and 1 magnoliid) and Rps12 was lost in two species (1 algae and 1 magnoliid). The chloroplast
genome encodes four Rpo genes, RpoA, RpoB, RpoC1 and RpoC2 (Table 2). RpoA and RpoC1 encode for
the alpha-subunit and RpoB and RpoC2 encode the beta-subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The analysis revealed the loss of RpoA, RpoB, RpoC1, and RpoC2 genes from the chloroplast genome of
several taxa (Supplementary File 4). Specifically, RpoA1 was lost in 26 species (5 algae, 6 bryophytes, 7
eudicots, 1 magnoliid, 4 monocots, and 3 protists); RpoB was lost in 19 species (1 algae, 14 eudicots, 1

RpoC2 was lost in 13 species (1 algae, 7 eudicots, 1 magnoliid, and 4 monocots). The loss of RpoA
occurred across diverse lineages including algae, bryophytes, eudicots, magnoliids, monocots, and
protists. Additionally, RpoB was lost in algae, eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots; RpoC1 was lost in
eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots and RpoC2 was lost in eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots

The majority of chloroplast genomes encode four Ycf genes, Ycf1, Ycf2, Ycf3, and Ycf4. Our analysis
indicated a dynamic loss of Ycf genes from the chloroplast genome of a variety of taxa (Supplementary
File 4). Ycf1 was lost in 161 species (125 algae, 4 eudicots, 1 magnoliid, 3 monocots, and 28 protists),
Ycf2 was lost in 219 species (185 algae, 1 eudicot and magnoliid each, 2 monocots, and 30 protists). Ycf3
was lost in 30 species (7 algae, 7 eudicots, 1 magnoliid, 6 monocots, and 9 protists). Ycf4 was lost in 39
species (6 algae, 24 eudicots, 1 magnoliid, 5 monocots, and 3 protists). Although researchers have yet to
elucidate the function of Ycf genes, Ycf3 and Ycf4 have been reported to be a photosystem I assembly
factor. The loss of Ycf1 and Ycf2 genes was more prominent in algae and the loss of Ycf1 and Ycf2 genes
were not found in bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms. The loss of Ycf4 was most prominent in
eudicots and the loss of Ycf3 and Ycf4 was not observed in bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms
(Supplementary File 4).

When the collection of all the lost genes were grouped, it was evident that a large number of genes had
been found to lost in algae, eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots (Supplementary Table 1). Only a small
number of genes were lost in bryophytes, gymnosperms, protists, and pteridophytes (Supplementary
Table 1). When the species of algae, gymnosperms, monocots, eudicots, magnoliids, and bryophytes were
grouped together, NdhA, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF, NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ, and NdhK were found to
be lost in all six lineages; while AtpB, AtpE, AtpH, AtpI, CemA, PetA, PetB, PetD, PetG, PetL, PsaA,

RpoB, and RpoC2 had been lost in algae, eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots (Supplementary Figure 16,
Supplementary Table 1). AccD, NdhB, PsaJ, Rpl23, and Rpl32 genes were only absent in species of
algae, eudicots, gymnosperms, magnoliids, and monocots. When species of algae, bryophytes,
gymnosperms, angiosperms (monocot and dicot), pteridophytes, and protists were grouped together, at
least 11 genes were found to be lost in all of the lineages (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure
17). The most common lost genes were NdhA, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF, NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ,
NdhK, and Rps16. The NdhB gene, however, was lost in algae, angiosperms, gymnosperms, protists, and
pteridophytes; while it was present in all species of bryophytes. When the higher groupings of plant
lineages (gymnosperms, magnoliids, and monocots) were grouped together, it was found that AccD,
NdhA, NdhB, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF, NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ, NdhK, PsaJ, Rpl23, and Rpl32 had
been lost in all four lineages (Supplementary Figure 18, Supplementary Table 1). AtpB, AtpE, AtpH, AtpI,
CcsA, CemA, PetA, PetB, PetD, PetG, PetL, PetN, PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaI, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, PsbD,
PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbJ, PsbL, PsbZ, Psbf1, Rpl22, Rpl33, RpoB, RpoC1, RpoC2, and Rps19 were found
to be lost in eudicots, magnoliids, and monocots. ClpP was found to be lost in eudicots, gymnosperms,
and magnoliids. A comparative analysis of gene loss in eudicot and monocot plants revealed that gene
loss was more frequent in eudicots (69 genes) than in monocots (59 genes). Eudicots and monocots share
the loss of 59 genes in their chloroplast genomes. The loss of ClpP, Rpl2, Rpl14, Rpl36, RpoA, Rps2,
Rps8, Rps11, Rps14, and Rps18 occurred only in eudicots and not in monocots. A comparative analysis
of gene loss in eudicots, gymnosperms, and monocots indicated that the loss of Rps7 was unique to the
gymnosperms. The loss of at least 17 genes (accD, ndhA, ndhB, ndhC, ndhD, ndhE, ndhF, ndhG, ndhH,
ndhI,
ndhJ,
ndhK
psaJ, rpl23, rpl32, rps15, and rps16) were found to be common in between eudicots, gymnosperms, and
monocots.

It has been speculated that genes lost from chloroplast genomes may have moved to the nuclear genome
and are regulated as a nuclear-encoded gene. Therefore, a genome-wide analysis of fully sequenced and

Determining the rate of nucleotide substitution in the chloroplast genome is an important parameter that
needs to be more precisely understood to further elucidate the evolution of the chloroplast genome.
Single base substitutions, and insertion and deletion (indels) events play an important role in shaping the
genome. Therefore, an analysis was conducted to determine the rate of substitution in the chloroplast
genome by grouping them according to their respective lineages. Results indicated that the
transition/transversion substitution ratio was highest in pteridophytes (k1 = 4.798 and k2 = 4.043) and
lowest in Nymphaeales (k1 = 2.799 and k2 = 2.713) (Supplementary Table 2). The ratio of nucleotide
substitution in species with deleted IR regions was 2.951 (k1) and 3.42 (k2) (Supplementary Table 2).
The rate of transition of A > G substitution was highest in pteridophytes (15.08) and lowest in protists
(8.51) and the rate of G > A substitution was highest in protists (22.15) and lowest in species with deleted
IR regions (16.8). The rate of substitution of T > C was highest in pteridophytes (14.01) and lowest in
protists (8.95) (Supplementary Table 2). The rate of substitution of C > T was highest in protists (22.34)
and lowest in Nymphaeales. The rate of transversion is two-times less frequent than the rate of transition.
The rate of transversion of A > T was highest in protists (6.80) and lowest in pteridophytes (4.64), while
the rate of transversion of T > A was highest in algae (6.98) and lowest in pteridophytes (Supplementary
Table 2). The rate of substitution of G > C was highest in Nymphaeales (4.31) and lowest in protists
(2.46), while the rate of substitution of C > G was highest in Nymphaeales (4.14) and lowest in protists
(2.64) (Supplementary Table 2). Based on these results, it is concluded that the highest rates of transition
and transversion were more frequent in lower eukaryotic species, including algae, protists, Nymphaeales,
and pteridophytes; while high rates of transition/transversion were not observed in bryophytes,
gymnosperms, monocots, and dicots (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, G > A transitions were more
prominent in chloroplast genomes with deleted IR regions (Supplementary Table 2).

A phylogenetic tree was constructed to obtain an evolutionary perspective of chloroplast genomes (Figure
7). All of the 2511 studied species were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (Figure 7). The
phylogenetic analysis produced four distinct clusters, indicating that chloroplast genomes evolved
independently from multiple common ancestors. Lineage-specific groupings of chloroplast genomes were
not present in the phylogenetic tree. The genomes of algae, bryophytes, gymnosperms, eudicots,
magnoliids, monocots, and protists grouped dynamically in different clusters. Although the size of the
chloroplast genome in protists was far smaller than in other lineages, they were still distributed
sporadically throughout the phylogenetic tree. Time tree analysis indicated that the origin of the
cyanobacterial species in this study those used as out-group date back to ~2180 Ma and that the
endosymbiosis of the cyanobacterial genome occurred ~ 1768 Ma ago and was incorporated into the algal

Streptophyta ~1150 Ma, Embryophyta ~532 Ma, Tracheophyte ~431 Ma, Euphyllophyte 402 Ma, and
Spermatophyta 313 Ma (Figure 8). The molecular signature genes PsaM, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, Psb30, and
Rpl21 in algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms were lost ~203 (Cycadales) and -156
(Gnetidae) Ma ago, and as a result, are not found in the subsequently evolved angiosperm lineage (Figure

Chloroplasts are an indispensable part of plant cells which function as a semi-autonomous organelle due
to the presence their own genetic material, potential to self-replicate, and capability to modulate cell
metabolism [21–24]. The size of the chloroplast genome is highly variable and does not correlate to the
size of the corresponding nuclear genome of the species. The average size of the chloroplast genome is
0.152 Mb and encodes an average of 91.67 CDS per genome. The deletion of IR regions in the
chloroplast genome is supposed to drastically reduce the genetic content of the chloroplast genome and
also the number of CDS. The current analysis of however, does not support this premise. The average
number of CDS in algae (140.93) was higher than the average number of CDS found in protists (98.97),
pteridophytes (86.54), eudicots (83.55), bryophytes (83.38), gymnosperms (82.54), and monocots
(82.53). The larger genome size (0.177 Mb) of the chloroplast genome in algae taxa with deleted IR
regions, and the higher number of CDS (172.16 per genome) in IR-deleted taxa of algae indicates that the
loss of IR regions in algae led to a genetic rearrangement and an enlargement in chloroplast genome size.
However, the average CDS number of other lineages in IR deleted genomes was quite lower than their
average CDS count (86.28 for protist, 63 for monocot, 81.42 for gymnosperm, and 71.88 for eudicot).
The average size of IR-deleted chloroplast genomes in eudicots, monocots, protists, and gymnosperms
was smaller than the average size of chloroplast genomes of taxa where IR regions have not been deleted.
Thus, the lower number of CDS in these taxa, may be related to the deletion of IR regions. This suggests
that the deletion of IR regions in the chloroplast genome of algae is directly proportional to the increase
in the genome size and concomitant increase in the CDS number; whereas, this was not true in the other
plant lineages where the relationship was inversely proportional. Deletion of IR regions has been
previously reported in a few species of algae, magnoliids, and other genomes [25–29]. The present study,
however, provided clear evidence regarding the loss of IR regions across all plant and protist lineages.
The deletion of IR repeats and increase in the genome size in algae has largely been attributed to a
duplication of chloroplast genome. The evolutionary age of IR-deleted species of algae dates back to
~965-850 Ma. This provides a strong evidence that the deletion of IR repeats and duplications of the
chloroplast genome has been a continuous process since the initial evolution of the chloroplast genome.
Zhu et al. (2015) has also suggested a role for duplication in evolution of IR-deleted chloroplast genomes
[28]. Characterizing the pattern and frequency of neutral mutations (substitution, insertions, and deletion)
is important for deciphering the molecular basis of evolution of genes and genomes. Turmel et al., (2017)
reported that a differential loss of genes from the chloroplast genome resulted in the loss of IR regions in
the chloroplast genome for all the lineages, except algae and protists [25]. The transition/transversion
ratio of purine substitutions in all IR-deleted species (k1=2.951) was much lower than in non-IR-deleted
species, except for species in the Nymphaeales, and the substitution of pyrimidines in all IR-deleted
species was higher (k2=3.42), except pteridophytes (Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest that, in
addition to a duplication event, a lower rate of purine substitution and a higher rate of pyrimidine
substitution are closely associated with the deletion of IR regions.

In addition to the loss of IR regions, the loss of genes from chloroplast genomes was also analysed. The
loss of important genes from the chloroplast genome has been previously reported in some species of
green algae, bryophytes, and magnoliids, [30–33]. The loss of the photosynthetic gene, RBCL, in the
parasitic plant, Conopholis, has also been reported. However, the RBCL gene was reported to be present
in other parasitic plants in the Orobanchacea [34,35]. The results of the present study indicate the loss of
RBCL gene in at least 17 species among parasitic, myco-parasitic, and saprophytic plant species across

different lineages, including algae, eudicots, magnoliids, monocots, and protists. The loss of RBCL,
however, was not observed in any species of bryophytes, pteridophytes, or gymnosperms. The number of
CDS in the RBCL-deleted chloroplast genome was much lower (27 per genome) relative to the average
number of CDS found in the chloroplast genomes; except for Alveolata sp. CCMP3155 which possessed
81 CDs. The loss of the RBCL gene in the chloroplast genome is associated with a drastic reduction in the
number of other protein coding genes. Interestingly, the parasitic genus, Cuscuta, possesses an RBCL
gene which suggests that the parasitic nature of a species is not always associated with the deletion of
RBCL; and vice versa, the loss of RBCL is not a pre-requisite of becoming a parasitic plant as well.

Important genes encoded by the chloroplast genome include AtpA, AtpB, AtpE, AtpF, AtpH, AtpI, CcsA,
ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, ClpP, NdhA, NdhB, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF, NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ, NdhK,

Rpl21, Rpl22, Rpl23, Rpl32, Rpl33, Rpl36, RpoA, RpoB, RpoC1, RpoC2, Rps2, Rps3, Rps4, Rps7, Rps8,
Rps11, Rps12, Rps14, Rps15, Rps16, Rps18, Rps19, Ycf1, Ycf2, Ycf3, and Ycf4. Deletions of one or more
of these genes have been observed in numerous chloroplast genomes. It is difficult to decipher the reason
for the loss of these individual genes in different chloroplast genomes. NdhA, NdhC, NdhD, NdhE, NdhF,
NdhG, NdhH, NdhI, NdhJ, NdhK, and Rps16 were genes that were most commonly lost across the
analysed chloroplast genomes. The NdhB gene, however, was found to be intact in all species of
bryophytes; suggesting that it could serve as a signature gene for the bryophyte chloroplast genome. Ndh
genes encode a component of the thylakoid Ndh-complex involved in photosynthetic electron transport.
The loss of specific Ndh genes in different species suggests that not all Ndh genes are involved in or
needed for functional photosynthetic electron transport. Loss of one Ndh gene may be compensated for
by other Ndh genes or by nuclear encoded genes. The functional role of the Ndh gene was previously
reported to be closely related to the adaptation of land plant and photosynthesis [36]. The loss of Ndh
genes in species across all plant lineages, including algae, suggests that Ndh genes are not associated with
the adaptation of photosynthesis to terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies have reported the loss of Ndh
genes in the Orchidaceae, where the deletion was reported to occur independently after the orchid family
split into different sub-families [37]. These data suggest that the loss of Ndh genes in the parental lineage
of orchids led to the loss of Ndh genes in the sub-families in the downstream lineages of orchids.

A comparison of gene loss in monocots and dicots revealed that species in the eudicots are more prone to
the gene loss than monocot species. Monocots and dicots chloroplast genome share in common loss of 59
genes, while eudicots have lost 10 more genes (ClpP, Rpl14, Rpl2, Rpl36, RpoA, Rps2, Rps8, Rps11,
Rps14, and Rps18) than monocots; suggesting that these genes represent the molecular signature of the
chloroplast genomes of monocot species. Ycf (Ycf1, Ycf2, Ycf3, and Ycf4) genes were found to be intact in
all species of bryophytes, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes; suggesting that they represent a common
molecular signature for these lineages. Various genes, including MatK, RBCL, Ndh, and Ycf, are
commonly used as universal molecular markers in DNA barcoding studies for determining the genus and
species of the plants. The loss of these genes in the chloroplast genome of various lineages make their use
as universal markers questionable in studies for DNA barcoding [38–42].

The loss of RpoA from the chloroplast genome of mosses was previously reported and it was suggested
that RpoA had relocated to the nuclear genome [31,43]. The loss of Psa and Psb was quite prominent in
algae, eudicot, magnoliid, monocot, and protist lineages. Psa and Psb were always found to be present in
species of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms; suggesting that these genes could serve as a
common molecular signature for these lineages. PsaM, Psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, and Rpl21 are
characteristic molecular signature genes for lower eukaryotic plants; including algae, bryophytes,
pteridophytes, and gymnosperms. Additionally, these genes are completely absent in the eudicots,
magnoliids, monocots, and protists. The absence of these genes in angiosperm and magnoliid lineages
reflect their potential role in the origin of flowering plants. Duplication events for PsaM, Psb30, ChlB,
ChlL, ChlN and Rpl21 genes were much lower than deletion and co-divergence events (Table 1). In fact,

co-divergence was the dominant event for all of these genes (Table 1). The recombination events that
occurred in the chloroplast genome directly reflect the potential possibility of co-divergent and divergent
evolution in these genes. The presence of PsaM, Psb30, ChlB, ChlL, and ChlN genes in their respective
lineages support the premise that these genes are orthologous and resulted from a speciation event [44–
47]. Chl genes are involved in photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, pteridophytes, and conifers [48–
53]; indicating that the Chl genes were originated at least ~2180 Ma ago and remained intact up to the
divergence of the angiosperms at ~156 Ma. The loss of Psa and Psb genes in different species also
suggests that they are not essential for a complete and functional photosynthetic process. The loss of a
Psa or Psb gene in a species might be compensated for by other Psa or Psb genes or by a nuclear
encoded gene. The loss of Psa and Psb genes in species across all plant lineages has not been previously
reported. Thus, this study is the first to report the loss of Psa and Psb genes in the chloroplast genome of
species across all plant lineages, as well as protists. The loss of Rpl22, Rpl32, and Rpl33 genes was more
prominent than the loss of Rpl2, Rpl14, Rpl16, Rpl20, Rpl23, and Rpl36; suggesting, the conserved nature
of Rpl2, Rpl14, Rpl16, Rpl20, Rpl23, and Rpl36 genes and the conserved transfer of these genes to
subsequent downstream lineages as intact genes. Rpl20 was found to be intact gene in all 2511 of the
studied species, suggesting that Rpl20 is the most evolutionary conserved gene in the chloroplast genome
of plants and protists. Therefore, Rpl20 can be considered as the molecular signature gene of the
chloroplast genome. Similarly, the loss of Rps15 and Rps16 was more frequent relative to the loss of
Rps2, Rps3, Rps4, Rps7, Rps8, Rps11, Rps12, Rps14, Rps18, and Rps19.

There are several reports regarding the transfer of genes from the chloroplast to the nucleus [13,24,54–
56]. In the present study, almost all of the genes encoded by the chloroplast genomes were also found in
the nuclear genome. The presence of the chloroplast-encoded genes in the nuclear genome, however, was
quite dynamic. If a specific chloroplast-encoded gene was found in the nuclear genome of one species, it
may not have been present in the nuclear genome of other species. One report also indicated that genes
transferred to the nuclear genome may not provide a one to one correspondence in function [56]. The
question also arises as to how almost all of the chloroplast-encoded genes can be found in the nuclear
genome and how were they transferred? If the transfers and correspondence are real, it is plausible that
almost all chloroplast-encoded genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome in one or more species
and that the transfer of chloroplast genes to the nuclear genome is a common process in the plant
kingdom and exchange of chloroplast genes with nuclear genome have already completed.

The underlying exact mechanism regarding the deletion of IR regions from the chloroplast genome is still
unknown and the loss of specific chloroplast-encoded genes and IR regions in diverse lineages makes it
more problematic to decipher the mechanism, or selective advantage behind the loss of the genes and IR
regions. It is likely that nucleotide substitutions and the dynamic recombination of chloroplast genomes
are the factors that are most responsible for the loss of genes and IR regions. Although the evolution of
parasitic plants can, to some extent, be attributed to the loss of important chloroplast genes; still it is not
possible to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the loss of genes and IR regions. The presence of
all chloroplast-encoded genes in the nuclear genome of one or another species is quite intriguing. Has the
chloroplast genome completed the transfer of different chloroplast encoding genes in different species
based on some adaptive requirement? The presence of a completely intact Rpl20 gene without any
deletions in the chloroplast genome of all the species indicates that the Rpl20 gene can be considered as a
molecular signature gene of the chloroplast genome.

All of the sequenced chloroplast genomes available up until December 2018 were downloaded from
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and used in the current study to analyse the
genomic details of the chloroplast genome. In total, 2511 full-length complete chloroplast genome
sequences were downloaded; including those from algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms,
monocots, dicots, magnoliids, and protist/protozoa (Supplementary File 1). All of the individual genomes
were subjected to OGDRAW to check for the presence and absence of inverted repeats in the genome
[57]. Genomes that were found to lack inverted repeats (IR), as determined by OGDRAW, were further
searched in NCBI database to cross verify the absence of IR in their genome. The annotated CDS
sequences in each chloroplast genome were downloaded and the presence or absence of CDS from all
chloroplast genomes were searched in each individual genome using Linux programming. Species that
were identified as lacking a gene in their chloroplast genome were noted and further re-checked manually
in the NCBI database. Each chloroplast genome was newly annotated using the GeSeq-annotation of
organellar genomes pipeline to further extend the study of gene loss in chloroplast genomes [58]. The
combined analysis of NCBI and GeSeq-annotation of organellar genomes were considered in determining
the absence of a particular gene in a chloroplast genome.

The CDS of the nuclear genome of 145 plant species were downloaded from the NCBI database. The
presence of chloroplast-encoded genes in the nuclear genome was determined using Linux-based
commands and collected in a separate file. The chloroplast-encoded genes present in the nuclear genomes
were further processed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

Prior to the multiple sequence alignment, the CDS sequences of PsaM, psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN and
RPL21 were converted to amino acid sequences using sequence manipulation suite
(http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/translate.html). The resulting protein sequences were subjected to a
multiple sequence alignment using the Multalin server to identify conserved amino acid motifs [59]. The
CDS sequences of PsaM, psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN and RPL21 genes were also subjected to a multiple
sequence alignment using Clustal Omega. The resultant aligned file was downloaded in Clustal format
and converted to a MEGA file format using MEGA6 software [60]. The converted MEGA files of PsaM,
psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, and RPL21 were subsequently used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree.
Prior to the construction of the phylogenetic tree, a model selection was carried out using MEGA6
software using following parameters; analysis, model selection; tree to use, automatic (neighbor-joining
tree); statistical method, maximum likelihood; substitution type, nucleotide; gaps/missing data treatment,
partial deletion; site coverage cut-off (%), 95; branch swap filer, very strong; and codons included, 1st,
2nd, and 3rd. Based on the lowest BIC (Bayesian information criterion) score, the following statistical
parameters were used to construct the phylogenetic tree: statistical method, maximum likelihood; test of
phylogeny, bootstrap method; no. of bootstrap replications, 1000; model/method, general time reversible
model; rates among sites, gamma distributed with invariant sites (G+I); no. of discrete gamma categories
5; gaps/missing data treatment, partial deletion; site coverage cut-off (%), 95; ML Heuristic method,
nearest-neighbor-interchange (NNI); branch swap filer, very strong; and codons included, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
The resulting phylogenetic trees were saved as gene trees. Whole genome sequences of chloroplast
genomes were also collectively used to construct a phylogenetic tree to gain insight into the evolution of
chloroplast genomes. ClustalW programme was used in a Linux-based platform to construct the
phylogenetic tree of chloroplast genomes using the neighbor-joining method and 500 bootstrap replicates.
The
resultant
Newick
file
was
uploaded
in
Archaeopteryx
(https://sites.google.com/site/cmzmasek/home/software/archaeopteryx) to view the phylogenetic tree. A
separate phylogenetic tree of species with IR-deleted regions was also constructed using the whole

sequence of the IR-deleted chloroplast genome using similar parameters as described above. The
evolutionary time of plant species used in this study was created using TimeTree [61]. Cyanobacterial
species were used as an outgroup to calibrate the time tree for the other species.

was
constructed
using
the

browser
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi) prior to the study of deletion and
duplication of PsaM, psb30, ChlB, ChlL, ChlN, and RPL21 genes. The gene trees were uploaded in
Notung software v. 2.9 followed by uploading of the species tree and subsequent reconciliation of the
gene tree with the species tree [62–64]. Once reconciled, deletion and duplication events for the genes
were visualized and noted.

754

Recombination events and time tree construction of the chloroplast genome

755
756
757

The constructed phylogenetic tree of chloroplast genomes was uploaded in IcyTree [65] to analyze the
recombination events that occurred in chloroplast genomes. The recombination events in IR-deleted and
non-deleted IR species were studied separately.

Chloroplast genomes were grouped into different groups to determine lineage-specific nucleotide
substitution rates. The groups were algae, bryophytes, gymnosperms, eudicots, monocots, magnoliids,
Nymphaeales, protists, and IR-deleted species. At least 10 chloroplast genomes were included for each
lineage when analysing the rate of nucleotide substitutions. The full-length sequences of chloroplast
genomes were subjected to multiple sequence alignment to generate a Clustal file. MAFT-multiple
alignment pipeline was implemented to align the sequences of the different chloroplast genomes. The
aligned sequences of individual lineages were downloaded and converted to a MEGA file format using
MEGA6 software [60]. The converted files were subsequently uploaded in MEGA6 software to analyse
the rate of nucleotide substitution. The following statistical parameters were used to analyse the rate of
substitution rate in chloroplast genomes: analysis, estimate transition/transversion bias (MCL); scope, all
selected taxa; statistical method, maximum composite likelihood; substitution type, nucleotides;
model/method, Tamura-Nei model; and gaps/missing data treatment, complete deletion.

Principal component analysis and probability distribution of chloroplast genomes were conducted using
Unscrambler software version 7.0 and Venn diagrams were constructed using InteractiVenn

Phylogenetic tree of IR deleted chloroplast genomes. The phylogenetic tree of chloroplast genomes was
constructed with ClustalW using a neighbor-joining approach with 1000 bootstrap replicates and three
major clusters were identified. The phylogenetic tree was constructed in combination of the species
containing the inverted repeats (Floydiella terrestris, Carteria cerasiformis, B. apyrenoidosa, E. grandis,
O. sativa and other) to decipher the differences. Deletion of inverted repeats did not have a significant
impact on the phylogeny.

Maximum composite likelihood substitution of nucleotides. The entry reflects the probability of
substitution (r) from one base (row) to another base (column). The rates of transitions are highlighted in
bold and rates of transversion are highlighted in italics. The nucleotide frequencies (%) of A, T/U, G, and
C for respective study are mentioned in the rows. The transition/transversion ratio are mentioned as K1
(purine) and K2 (pyrimidine). The transition/transversion bias R = [A*G*k1 + T*C*k2]/[(A+G) *
(T+C)]. The codon position included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + non-coding. All the positions with less than
95% site coverage were eliminated. That is fewer than 5% alignment gaps. Missing data and ambiguous
bases were allowed at any position. The C > T substitution is more frequent than T > C substitution and
G > A substitution more frequently than A > G. The major mechanism mutation is deamination of 5’methyl cytosine to uracil (thiamine) producing C > T or on the complementary stand G > A.
