Introduction

Every year, approximately 36,000 units of red blood cell transfusions are

used for patients suffering from diseases, undergoing surgical operations,

transfusions has depended on blood donors, but more stable sources are

10

required for the anticipated growth in demand (Batta, 2016). One alternative

11

is stem cells, which can be proliferated to high numbers that pro duce the

12

needed volume (Chung, 2017; Doulatov, 2013; Kinney, 2019; Orkin, 2008).

However, limited understanding of erythropoiesis has prevented the

2

glucocorticoids uncouple cell division and differentiation, thus maintaining

3

and amplifying undifferentiated erythroid cells (Li, 2019).

5

The amplification of erythroid cells takes place in the vascularized regions

6

of tissues, such as yolk sac, fetal liver, placenta, and adult bone marrow

7

(BM) (Baron, 2012; Van Handel, 2010). The role of vascular endothelial

8

cells (ECs) has been documented in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem

9

cells, the differentiation to both myeloid and lymphoid lineage types, and

10

the production of platelets (Morrison , 2014; Pinho, 2019). However, the role

11

of vascular ECs in erythropoiesis is unclear. Elucidating the contribution of

12

vascular ECs and their effector molecules is expected to achieve the

13

clinically relevant number of red blood cells from stem cells (Butler, 2010;

14

Ziyad, 2018).

15
16

Herein we demonstrate the role of human umbilical vein endothelial cells

17

(HUVECs) in enhanced erythropoiesis . We show that angiocrinie factors

18

secreted from HUVECs maintain and amplify undifferentiated erythroid cells.

Results

HUVECs amplify erythroid cells

4

To address whether embryonic ECs ha ve a role in erythropoiesis, we

5

co-cultured human BM-CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells with either

6

HUVECs or human pluripotent stem cell ( hPSC)-derived ECs seeded on

7

fibronectin. Co-culture with HUVECs resulted in the amplification of

8

Pro-erythroblasts (EB)s (CD71+GLY-A-) and EBs (CD71+GLY-A+), so that

9

overall total of erythroid cells increased (fig. 1A-B). HUVECs on fibronectin

10

stalled the waterfall pattern of erythroid differentiation , particularly before

11

the entry to Late-EB (CD71-GLY-A+) stage (fig. 1A). In contrast to HUVECs,

12

co-culture with human PSC-derived ECs fully differentiated to Late-EBs (fig.

13

1A). We measured the differentiation potential of the amplified erythroid

14

cells with HUVEC co-culture. We isolated and cytospun the EB population to

15

identify basophilic erythroid s (fig. 2A). To examine if the amplified erythroid

16

cells could undergo further differentiation, we cultured them for an

17

additional week. We found that 32% of them exited from EB to become

18

Late-EB and differentiated to orthochromatic erythroid (fig. 2B), indicating

that differentiation capacity could be restored . These data demonstrate that

Angiocrine factors from HUVEC s amplify erythroblasts

5

To assess whether cell-cell interactions are required for the enhanced

6

amplification of erythroid cells, we used a transwell assay, where the media

7

and secreted factors could be exchanged but direct HUVEC contact was

8

prevented. We found an increase in erythroid cells in the transwell setting

9

(fig. 3), suggesting that secreted angiocrine factors are involved in the

10

erythroid amplification. To determine the angiocrine factors produced by

11

HUVECs, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis for the genes that encode

12

secreted factors in HUVECs and hPSC-ECs (fig. 4A). Based on literature

13

search, we classified the secreted factors into three categories (fig. 4B).

Erythropoiesis enhancing factors (EEFs) include classical hematopoietic

15

cytokines and morphogens whose role s are validated in erythropoiesis

16

(Paulson, 2011). Recent studies proved that both OP9 (Trakarnsanga,

17

2018) and macrophages (Lopez-Yrigoyen, 2019) enhance erythropoiesis via

18

secreted factors, which are termed OP9-crines and macrophage -crines

19

respectively in this study. EPO, EGF ligands, and glucocorticoid synthases

were included among EEFs, whose expressions were not detected in

2

HUVECs (fig. 4B). Additionally, OP9-crines were not enriched in HUVEC s

3

(fig. 4B). On the other hand, NRG1 and IGFBP6, which are included among

4

macrophage-crines, were exclusively expressed in HUVEC s (fig. 4B, table

1). These data demonstrate that HUVEC s express and share their profile of

6

angiocrine factors with macrophages.

ERK is involved in amplification of erythroid cells

9

NRG1 and IGFBP6 regulate ERK signaling ( fig. 5A; Kataria, 2019; Zinn,

10

2013). We confirmed that HUVECs activated the ERK signal in erythroid cell

11

line K562 (fig. 5B). Accordingly, we observed that the chemical inhibition of

12

ERK diminished the HUVEC -mediated amplification of erythroid cells (fig.

13

5C-D). Consistent with this reduced amplification, the inhibition of ERK

14

moved the scatter profile of the GLY-A+ population toward differentiation

15

(fig. 5C). Of note, we made consistent observations in both BM - and cord

16

blood (CB)-CD34+ cells, suggesting the mechanisms of erythroid cell

17

amplification is common between the cell source type: CB from fetus and

18

BM from adult (fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that ERK activation

19

amplifies erythroid cells through angiocrine factors from HUVEC s.

Discussion

3

Elucidating a manner to amplify erythroid cells is expected to achieve a

4

clinically relevant number of red blood cells (Koury, 2016). Several studies

5

have shown that HUVECs proliferate hematopoietic stem and progenitor

6

cells (Yildirim, 2005), but the understanding of their role in erythropoiesis

7

remains incomplete. Our

mechanism to produce red blood cells in vitro.

work demonstrated that

angiocrine factors

10
11

ERK signaling mediates erythroid commitment of hematopoietic progenitor

12

cells at the initial phase of erythropoiesis , but its role in the subsequent

13

phases of erythropoiesis is not clear (Guihard, 2010). We demonstrated that

14

ERK signaling amplifies erythroid cells through angiocrine factors from

15

HUVECs. Instead of other erythropoiesis factors , such as EPO (Kuhrt,

16

2015), SCF (Comazzetto, 2019) or glucocorticoids (Narla, 2011), HUVECs

17

produce angiocrine factors in common with those from macrophages to

18

enhance erythropoiesis (Lopez-Yrigoyen, 2019; Seu, 2017). One study

our findings suggest that angiocrine factors could enhance erythropoiesis

Sequenced reads were mapped to the human reference genome sequences

3

(hg19) using TopHat v2.0.13 in combination with Bowtie2 ver. 2.2.3 and

4

SAMtools ver. 0.1.19. The fragments per kilobase of exon per million

5

mapped fragments (FPKMs) was calculated using Cufflinks version 2.2.1.

Statistics and source data

8

Statistical analyses wer e done with t-test. We used Microsoft Excel for

9

calculations and expressed the results as the means ± s.d. The source data

10

for each graph is available in the supplementary tables.
