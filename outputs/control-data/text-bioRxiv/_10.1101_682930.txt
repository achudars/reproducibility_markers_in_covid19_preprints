Abstract
During cardiac disease progression, myocytes undergo molecular, functional and structural
changes, including increases in cell size and shape, decreased myocyte alignment and
contractility. The heart often increases extracellular matrix production and stiffness, which affect
myocytes. The order and hierarchy of these events remain unclear as available in vitro cell
culture systems do not adequately model both physiologic and pathologic environments.
Traditional cell culture substrates are 5-6 orders of magnitude stiffer than even diseased native
cardiac tissue. Studies that do account for substrate stiffness often do not consider intercellular
alignment and vice versa. We developed a cardiac myocyte culture platform that better
recapitulates native tissue stiffness while simultaneously introducing topographical cues that
promote cellular alignment. We show that stiffness and topography impact myocyte molecular
and functional properties. We used a spatiotemporally-tunable, photolabile hydrogel platform to
generate a range of stiffness and micron-scale topographical patterns to guide neonatal rat
ventricular myocyte morphology. Importantly, these substrate patterns were of subcellular
dimensions to test whether cells would spontaneously respond to topographical cues rather than
an imposed geometry. Cellular contractility was highest and the gene expression profile was
most physiologic on gels with healthy cardiac tissue stiffness. Surprisingly, while elongated
patterns in stiff gels yielded the greatest cellular alignment, the cells actually had more
pathologic functional and molecular profiles. These results highlight that morphological
measurements alone are not a surrogate for overall cellular health as many studies assume. In
general, substrate stiffness and micropatterning synergistically affect cardiac myocyte phenotype
to recreate physiologic and pathologic microenvironments.
Significance Statement
Heart disease is accompanied by organ- and cellular-level remodeling, and deconvoluting their
interplay is complex. Cellular-level change is best studied in vitro due to greater control and
uniformity of cell types compared to animals. One common metric is degree of cellular
alignment as misalignment of myocytes is a hallmark of disease. However, most studies utilize
featureless culture surfaces that are orders of magnitude stiffer than, and do not mimic the
scaffolding of, the heart. We developed a hydrogel platform with tunable stiffness and patterns
providing topographical alignment cues. We cultured heart cells on and characterized
multifactorial responses to these dynamic surfaces. Interestingly, conditions that yielded greatest
alignment did not yield the healthiest functional and molecular state. Thus, morphology alone is
not an indicator of overall cellular health.

Introduction
Cardiac myocytes undergo many molecular, biophysical, and biochemical changes during
the progression of heart disease. These changes include myofibrillar and sarcomeric disarray,
cell spreading and aspect ratio changes, interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins,
expression of cell-cell interaction proteins, and alterations in gene expression (1–5). Myocytes
interact with their extracellular microenvironment in a feedback loop that ultimately determines
whether they undergo physiological or pathological remodeling that may culminate in changes in
cell contractility. However, studying these changes in vitro is challenging, as traditional cell
culture studies are conducted on smooth, isotropic surfaces made of tissue culture polystyrene
(TCPS) or glass, whose stiffnesses are 5-6 orders of magnitude greater than that of native tissue.
Moreover, in these systems, there is minimal control of the density, composition, and mechanics
of the extracellular environment. As a result, researchers delving into the cell biology of heart
disease have been unable to reproduce many of the complexities of the in situ environment of
native hearts.
Motivated by this gap, advances in synthetic biomaterial substrates have allowed the
creation of synthetic ECM mimics that enable precise control over the presentation of substrate
stiffness (6, 7), topographical cues (8), presentation of ECM proteins, and the tethering and
removal of growth factors (6). These biomatrices share many properties with tissues and allow
one to perform genetic and biochemical manipulations of the cellular environment, while
simultaneously controlling cell-matrix interactions. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is one
commonly used biomaterial substrate, and PEG is often selected because of its biocompatibility,
hydrophilicity, resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption, and ability to tune its mechanical
properties to match various biological tissues. Furthermore, adhesive ligands and/or cytokines
can be conjugated or released at user-defined points in time and space (6). These collective
properties have rendered PEG hydrogels useful for conducting experiments that are largely
intractable on static plastic or glass surfaces. Examples of such studies have been reviewed
elsewhere (7–9). Here, an advanced PEG hydrogel system with light-tunable properties was used
to investigate how neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) respond to a simultaneous
presentation of substrate stiffness cues and patterns.
The stiffness (as assessed by Young’s modulus) of healthy neonatal rat myocardium is
~4-11kPa, and the stiffness of healthy adult rat myocardium is ~11-46kPa. The stiffness of
infarcted areas in adult rats can reach up to 56kPa (10), while the stiffness of hearts with other
fibrotic diseases ranges from ~35-50kPa (10–13). In the native myocardium, cells are arranged in
a parallel, “brick-wall” pattern, while in fibrotic disease, there are numerous changes in the
alignment of cardiac myocytes and in the composition and orientation of ECM proteins (14).
Other groups culturing cardiac myocytes on hydrogels and flexible surfaces have demonstrated
that cardiac myocytes exhibit greatest striation and maximum work and contractile force on
substrates with stiffnesses between 10-17kPa, which closely matches the stiffness measured in
neonatal and embryonic hearts (15, 16). Culturing cardiac myocytes on soft hydrogel substrates
also attenuates the expression of pathological (fetal) genes such as Nkx2.5 and Anf (Nppa) (17,
18).
Beyond control of the matrix mechanical properties, techniques such as molding and
microcontact printing have been used to recreate the patterned arrangement and aspect ratio of

cells seen in the healthy myocardium (19–25). As expected, cell aspect ratio and alignment are
both greater when NRVMs are cultured on patterned substrates than on smooth surfaces (20, 26).
Specifically, culturing NRVMs on substrates micropatterned with topographical features of
parallel 20 μm-wide fibronectin lines (27), 20 μm-wide eroded channels (22), or printed with
high aspect ratio rectangular adhesion 2000-2500 μm2 islands (28, 29) leads to higher levels of
sarcomeric alignment than on isotropic surfaces. From a functional perspective, NRVMs
cultured on patterned substrates generate greater peak systolic stress than cells cultured on
isotropic substrates (20, 27). In a system where NRVMs were cultured on thin, flexible 80x12
μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) strips arrayed in a brick wall pattern, McCain et al. found
increased α myosin heavy chain (αMHC; Myh6)-to-βMHC (βMHC; Myh7) ratios and on
patterned surfaces vs. isotropic surfaces (20). Because lower αMHC-to-βMHC ratios are
correlated with cardiac disease, the results of this study suggest that patterning matrix cues may
promote a healthier NRVM phenotype. However, aspect ratio alone cannot always predict
whether a cardiomyocyte is in a physiologic or pathologic state (reviewed in (1, 30). For
example, the aspect ratio of a typical adult cardiomyocyte is approximately 7:1. Pressure
overload due to pathologic stimuli such as high blood pressure or aortic valve stenosis, as well as
physiologic stimuli such as resistance weight training can both result in aspect ratios less than 7.
By contrast, volume overload due to pathologic stimuli such as valve regurgitation, ventricular
septal defects, or myocardial infarctions as well as physiologic stimuli such as running or
swimming can both result in aspect ratios greater than 7. Despite this wealth of experimental
observations, there remains a paucity of information as to how extracellular signals influence
intracellular signaling in NRVMs, and very few literature reports integrate an in-depth
biomolecular characterization of NRVMs while simultaneously controlling and presenting
multiple substrate microenvironmental cues.
In recent years, a number of studies have revealed that constraining cardiomyocytes to
different dimensions can result in changes in morphological and functional properties. The
current study described here builds from this foundational work by examining whether
micropatterned hydrogel substrates with feature dimensions smaller than an individual cell
(ensuring cells remain on top of the features) are sufficient to serve as simple topographical cues
to modulate molecular, structural, and functional cell-autonomous and intercellular properties.
Such changes can be interpreted as integration and interpretation of environmental mechanical
signals rather than a response to a forced morphological constraint. We further examine the
intersection of substrate topography and stiffness to evaluate the possibility of modeling
physiologic and pathologic conditions with one tunable culture platform.
Results
NRVMs form gap junctions and contract on micropatterned photoresponsive hydrogels
Patterning was performed on photoresponsive PEG hydrogels for culturing NRVMs and
the process is schematically shown in Figure 1 and previously described in (31). Substrates were
formulated to have a stiffness of that of either a healthy neonatal heart (10kPa) or a diseased
heart (35kPa). Regular, rectangular micropatterns of dimensions 40x5μm, 20x5μm, 10x5μm, and
5x5μm were formed on the surface via photodegradation. The rectangular features were spaced
5μm apart, and typically, the NRVMs spread across many of the topographical features. The
feature sizes resulted in patterns with aspect ratios ranging from 1:1 to ∞:1 (Figure 1). NRVMs
in all culture conditions, including TCPS, spontaneously contracted and formed mature

sarcomeres (Figure 2: representative images of TCPS and 10kPa ∞:1), but sarcomeres in cells on
hydrogels were better organized as revealed by F-actin staining. Collectively, these results
suggest that, similar to culturing on TCPS, NRVMs cultured on both smooth and patterned PEG
substrates maintained a cardiac phenotype measurable at the protein and functional levels with
respect to sarcomere structure and spontaneous contractions.
NRVM and F-actin alignment is proportional to the pattern aspect ratio
Higher aspect ratio patterns (i.e., from squares to channels) resulted in higher levels of
cell alignment in the direction of the pattern and lower variation in the cell orientation. The
major axis of the cell nuclei relative to the patterns was used to calculate the distribution of
orientational angles (Figure 3A,B). The circular standard deviation of the angular differences
measures the degree of cell alignment, where low angular standard deviations represent a high
degree of cell alignment and high angular standard deviations represent more random alignment
of cells (Figure 3C). Infinitely long channels produced the largest number of NRVMs that were
perfectly aligned with the pattern, while smooth gels and 1:1 patterns resulted in cells that were
more randomly oriented (Figure 3B). Of further note, NRVMs cultured on stiffer gels were more
closely aligned to the pattern compared to those on softer matrices with the same pattern. Fold
changes in percent alignment observed here were consistent with changes in myocyte alignment
in studies of wildtype mice (~46% aligned) and mice with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (~25%
aligned) (32).
Cell aspect ratio and F-actin alignment also increased in a manner that correlated with the
pattern aspect ratio (Figure 4A). Cell elongation, as measured by the aspect ratio, increased as
the pattern aspect ratio went from 1:1 to ∞:1 on both 10kPa and 35kPa gels. Regression slopes,
representing the relationship between pattern and cell aspect ratios, were statistically significant
for both soft and stiff gels (Figure 4B, Table 1). NRVMs cultured on smooth substrates adopted a
slightly lower aspect ratio, as did NRVMs cultured on 1:1 soft gels (Figure 4B). On rectangular
patterns with aspect ratios of 2:1 or greater, the aspect ratio for cells on gels was significantly
greater than on TCPS; however, there were no significant differences in cell aspect ratio between
soft and stiff gels. These results suggest that, under the experimental conditions tested, the aspect
ratio of the underlying pattern had a greater impact on cell aspect ratio than substrate elasticity.
F-actin alignment, a measure of internal sarcomeric organization, also increased with
increasing pattern aspect ratio. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to quantify Factin alignment in NRVMs cultured on both soft and stiff patterned substrates. F-actin alignment
on hydrogels was normalized to the F-actin alignment of NRVMs on TCPS. Regression slopes
were significant for both 10kPa and 35kPa gels, indicating a significant correlation between the
underlying pattern aspect ratio and F-actin alignment (Table 1). F-actin alignment on soft gels
was not significantly different than on TCPS for intermediate pattern aspect ratios of 2:1 through
8:1 (Figure 4C). On channeled substrates (∞:1), the percent F-actin alignment was higher than on
TCPS and was nearly identical on soft and stiff substrates. On 1:1 aspect ratio gels, F-actin
alignment was significantly higher on stiff gels.
Fractional shortening increases with pattern aspect ratio on soft, but not stiff, gels
NRVM function was assessed by measuring contractility through fractional shortening.
On soft gels, there was a significant, positive relationship between pattern aspect ratio and
fractional shortening (Table 1). For aspect ratios greater than 2:1, fractional shortening was also
significantly greater on soft gels than on TCPS (Figure 5). On infinitely long channels, the

fractional shortening was significantly greater on 10kPa gels than on 35kPa gels (Figure 5).
Moreover, fractional shortening of cells on channels in the 35kPa condition was statistically
indistinguishable from cells on TCPS. However, measurements of the beating frequency, ~42-64
beats per minute, did not indicate any statistically significant differences between NRVMs
cultured on the hydrogel materials studied. Although lower than clinical values (~60% for
healthy hearts to ~25% for diseased hearts (33)), fractional shortening of NRVMs cultured on
PEG gels reached peak values of 22% fractional shortening on 10kPa hydrogels, significantly
greater than that of 13% on 35kPa gels and 7% on TCPS (34).
Hydrogel stiffness and patterning attenuate fetal gene expression
Re-expression of fetal genes is a hallmark of cardiac myocyte pathology. Culturing
NRVMs on hydrogels significantly reduced the expression of fetal genes, such as Anf and Acta1
(α skeletal actin) compared to TCPS. Relative to TCPS, Anf was significantly downregulated on
all gel conditions (Figure 6A). Anf expression was not different between soft and stiff gels for all
pattern aspect ratios studied, but between the 1:1 patterns and smooth gels, there was a ~2.4-4.4
fold increase in Anf expression. Acta1 expression was also significantly lower on all gel
conditions relative to TCPS. Further, Acta1 expression was significantly lower on soft compared
to stiff gels at pattern aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (Figure 6A). However, positive regression
slopes for Anf and Acta1 were significant for both soft and stiff hydrogels, indicating increasing
expression of these pathologic markers with increasing aspect ratios (Table 1).
For αMHC, which is generally accepted as a beneficial gene in rodent cardiac myocytes,
the regression slope was negative and was significant only for stiff gels. Conversely, the
regression slope for βMHC (increases in which are considered pathologic), was positive and was
significant only for soft gels. Overall, there was a negative trend between αMHC expression and
pattern aspect ratio and a positive trend between βMHC expression and pattern aspect ratio
(Figure 6B). Regression slopes were significant for αMHC on 35kPa gels, βMHC on 10kPa gels,
and αMHC/βMHC ratio on 35kPa gels. In total, these results suggest that the effect of pattern on
myosin heavy chain isoforms is dependent on substrate stiffness.
Pathological miRNA expression is decreased on patterned 10kPa hydrogels
Given that miR-208a and miR-499 expression is induced in several cardiac disease
models and that they may represent potential targets for drug therapies (35–37), we analyzed
their expression as a function of NRVM culture conditions (Figure 6C). Significant observations
included a reduction in NRVM miR-208a expression when cultured on patterned (1:1 through
8:1), 10kPa hydrogels compared to TCPS; these results suggest a protective effect from a
combination of substrate patterning and decreased substrate stiffness. However, the regression
analysis indicated a positive slope for miR-208a expression with increasing aspect ratio on soft
gels (Figure 6C). There was also a nonsignificant, but large magnitude trend for higher miR-499
expression on 35kPa hydrogels. These trends are consistent with the gene expression patterns
observed in Figure 6A and B and together suggest that patterned hydrogel substrates could serve
as platforms to model cardiac disease processes at multiple biological levels.
Hydrogel patterning and stiffness do not significantly affect calcium handling genes
When simultaneously modifying substrate stiffness and patterning, expression of the
calcium handling genes Cav1.2 (Cacna1c) and Serca2a (Atp2a2) was not significantly different
between experimental groups; however, there was a non-significant trend for higher Cav1.2 and

Serca2a expression on 10kPa gels (Figure S1 and Table 1). During aging and disease, ATP2a2 is
downregulated (38), while Cav1.2 expression is reduced in pressure overload conditions (39).
Varying substrate stiffness between 10kPa and 35kPa while presenting a range of pattern aspect
ratios did not replicate the fold changes observed in disease models. The results suggest that a
larger range of substrate stiffness or pattern shapes may be necessary to produce changes in
calcium handling genes that are observed in disease.
Matrix remodeling genes are differentially regulated by culture on hydrogel substrates
Markers of ECM remodeling, such as connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) and collagen
type 1 alpha 1 (Col1a1) expression, were differentially regulated by substrate stiffness and by
pattern aspect ratio (Figure S2). Ctgf expression on all gel samples was significantly reduced by
at least two-fold relative to TCPS. Ctgf expression was also significantly higher on stiff gels for
several pattern geometries, and regression slopes were significant for both soft and stiff gels
samples. These results suggest that both substrate stiffness and pattern aspect ratio affect Ctgf
expression. Neither pattern aspect ratio nor gel stiffness significantly affected matrix
metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2) expression; however, Mmp2 expression on soft gels with 1:1 and
2:1 patterns was significantly greater than on TCPS (Figure S2). Col1a1 expression was
significantly lower on soft gels than on TCPS, but differences between soft and stiff gels were
not significant. Regression slopes for Col1a1 expression were also not significant for soft and
stiff gels.
Discussion
In vivo, cardiac myocytes experience both mechanical and topographical changes to their
microenvironment during development, physiological remodeling, and disease (10, 12).
Although many diverse animal models exist to test hypotheses generated from clinical
observations, some hypotheses require in vitro systems as they offer much higher levels of
control than an animal. However, in vitro models have lagged behind animal models in terms of
providing a flexible system that can model both physiologic and pathologic cardiac states. Thus,
a critical need in the field of cardiac biology is an in vitro system that recapitulates the (1)
physical, (2) morphological, (3) functional, and (4) molecular features of both healthy and
diseased microenvironments.
NRVMs are the most commonly used cardiomyocyte for in vitro studies, and several
studies demonstrate that NRVMs adapt to changes in substrate stiffness or patterns by regulating
their gene expression, morphology and contractility (15, 40). However, the vast majority of these
studies investigate the effect of modifying one particular aspect of the cellular microenvironment
amongst a multitude of factors that can change during normal development and disease
processes. In this work, we developed a photodegradable and photopatternable hydrogel platform
with varying micropatterns and stiffnesses (schematized in Figure 1) to evaluate whether this
system could faithfully model both physiologic and pathologic states by comprehensively
examining all four stated aspects of cardiomyocyte biology. In addition, the feature sizes were
micron size and smaller than a typical NRVM. Thus, rather than physically constraining the
NRVM artificially with topography, the hydrogels promote cell-interactions and allow the
NRVMs to spontaneously align based on their underlying focal adhesions with the substrate. In
this way, the hydrogel recapitulates aspects of an organized ECM-interaction and its influence on
mechanotransduction. We hypothesized that the conditions in which the cardiomyocytes were

best aligned on the softer gels (10kPa) would preserve the most physiologic phenotype because
the healthy neonatal myocardium is characterized by this modulus and by well-aligned cells.
Initial experiments revealed that NRVMs cultured on patterned hydrogel substrates
formed mature sarcomeres. Spontaneous contraction was also observed in all experimental
groups. Importantly, cell density appeared similar across all groups. These observations
suggested to us that NRVMs cultured on PEG hydrogels maintained a cardiac phenotype and that
our hydrogel system was suitable for more in-depth characterization of cells cultured using this
platform. Biochemical and image analysis measurements indicated that both substrate stiffness
and topography are significant factors that ultimately determine alignment, morphology and gene
expression of NRVMs (Table 1). For many of the readouts that we investigated, the largest fold
changes were observed only when varying both substrate stiffness and patterning. For example,
although cellular alignment was highest on 35kPa gels with ∞:1 aspect ratio patterns, fractional
shortening was actually the lowest under those conditions. Anf and Acta1 expression was lowest
on 10kPa gels, but increased with increasing aspect ratio on gels regardless of the underlying
stiffness. These results suggest that optimal levels of gene expression and contractility may occur
at an intermediate pattern/aspect ratio on a soft hydrogel and that incorporating multiple
microenvironment cues may increase the response range of NRVMs and lead to fold changes in
assay results at clinically relevant levels. Importantly, this work emphasizes the fact that all
aspects of cardiomyocyte health must be assessed, as relying on characteristic morphological
changes alone can be misleading.
(1) Physical features: intercellular alignment and substrate modulus
Myocyte disarray is a key feature of cardiac disease and cells plated on traditional, flat
surfaces are disarrayed in a manner similar to that observed in animal and human disease (1, 41,
42). Prior studies have also found that eroding topographical patterns affects the alignment of
NRVMs on smooth surfaces and surfaces with only one or two different pattern dimensions (21,
22, 43). In contrast, examining a gradient of pattern aspect ratios provides the ability to mimic
intermediate conditions, rather than only extremes. In addition to myocyte disarray, the stiffness
of diseased hearts also increases. Using photodegradable PEG hydrogel substrates, we generated
a range of pattern aspect ratios on both soft (10kPa) and stiff (35kPa) surfaces. The ability to
simultaneously deliver multiple microenvironmental cues, namely stiffness and patterning,
greatly expands the possible experimental space and provides the ability to examine how
multiple features of disease interact. Few studies have varied both substrate stiffness and
patterning. Notably, McCain et al. used microcontact printing to generate large, NRVM-sized
fibronectin islands of varying aspect ratios on soft and stiff polyacrylamide hydrogels in order to
generate cells of varying aspect ratios. They observed that shorter aspect ratio cells generated the
most systolic work on 90kPa gels while longer aspect ratio cells generated the most systolic
work on 13kPa gels (40). Extending from this work, Ribeiro et al. cultured human
cardiomyocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) on 10kPa
polyacrylamide hydrogels patterned with 2000 μm2 matrigel adhesion islands to constrain cells
to different aspect ratios. They demonstrated that such a platform resulted in better
differentiation and higher mechanical output (29).
In contrast, our study evaluated whether cardiomyocytes would spontaneously adapt to
micropatterned substrates. We photo-eroded small micropatterns (~1000μm2), less than the size
of single cells, to direct cell alignment without forcing a particular cell shape and aspect ratio
through adhesion islands, as is the common approach in published studies (29, 40). We interpret

the spontaneous molecular, structural, and functional changes we observed to represent a true
signal-response relationship between the environment and the myocyte that may more accurately
reflect in vivo cardiac remodeling. For example, fold changes in percent alignment observed
between patterned and smooth substrates were consistent with changes in myocyte alignment in
studies of wildtype mice (~46% aligned) and mice with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (~25%
aligned) (32). Myocyte disarray was modeled using a range of micropattern aspect ratios, and
NRVMs cultured on soft and stiff hydrogels exhibited similar changes in disarray as observed in
in vivo systems (Figure 3). Our results indicate a greater percentage of cells aligned on the 35kPa
∞:1 substrate than the 10kPa ∞:1 substrate. This finding may seem to contradict our initial
assumption that the 10kPa substrate modeled a healthier condition. However, we also observed
highest function on the 10kPa ∞:1 substrate. Disease progression is a complicated multifactorial
process where all cells start at the same state and cells in the diseased tissue remodel and respond
to their changing conditions. In a comparably simple in vitro system, the “health” range of cell
alignment may be different. Nonetheless, our patterned substrates could induce cell alignment
significantly greater than that of smooth surfaces.
(2) Morphological features: cellular aspect ratio
During heart failure, the morphology of human cardiac myocytes changes as the cells
elongate, and aspect ratios have been known to increase by a factor of 1.8 (34, 44, 45).
Moreover, increased aspect ratios can result from long-term aerobic training while decreased
aspect ratios can result from resistance training. Therefore, aspect ratio should not be viewed as a
singular metric of cardiomyocyte health. We took a multifactorial approach and modified
substrate stiffness and topographic pattern aspect ratios concomitantly. This resulted in cell
aspect ratios that spanned a 2.2 fold range, covering fold changes observed in human samples
and rodent models. It is also interesting to note that the NRVM aspect ratios on 10kPa hydrogels
alone appeared to cover a slightly broader dynamic range than on stiff hydrogels. Simultaneously
varying substrate stiffness and patterning resulted in significantly greater F-actin alignment on
stiff hydrogels than on TCPS (Figure 4). These observations suggested to us that in addition to
the significant effect of the pattern’s aspect ratio on F-actin alignment, the effect of substrate
stiffness may depend on the underlying pattern. While the bending stiffness and available
binding area of patterns may also influence cell morphology and F-actin organization,
systematically modifying these factors, such as using more than two stiffnesses, was beyond the
scope of the current study and is the subject of future experiments. Although neonatal cells were
used, simultaneous modulation of substrate stiffness and pattern aspect ratio produced a range of
cell aspect ratios that span values measured in both healthy adult individuals and patients with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (45).
(3) Functional features: fractional shortening
Fractional shortening values that were measured while varying substrate stiffness and
patterning ranged from ~13% to ~22% for a dynamic range of 1.7 fold. These values are similar
to those reported elsewhere for NRVMs cultured on 8kPa polyacrylamide hydrogels (46).
Clinical fractional shortening values based on in situ measurements of ventricular geometry
range from up to ~60% for healthy hearts to ~25% for diseased hearts (33); however, isolated
cells in culture often exhibit much lower values of ~7% (34). On 10kPa hydrogels, fractional
shortening increased with pattern aspect ratio, while on 35kPa hydrogels there was a trend for
decreasing fractional shortening with increasing pattern aspect ratio. Fractional shortening

dropped precipitously between 8:1 and channel features on 35 kPa gels. It is worth noting that
the cells need to form focal adhesions with the matrix, and these would be expected to be sparser
in the short dimension on channels where they are less likely to encounter the substrate. This,
coupled with the pathologic changes in gene expression (particularly the decreased αMHC and
increased βMHC expression) could account for this decrease in function. These results suggest
that substrate stiffness significantly affects fractional shortening when cells are aligned with high
aspect ratio patterns. Another observation is that fractional shortening was greatest at an
intermediate value of effective stiffness, a function of substrate stiffness and patterning. Other
studies have shown optimal contractility on smooth substrates with an intermediate stiffness,
~10kPa (16, 47). Simultaneous delivery of multiple microenvironmental cues revealed potential
interacting variables such as available cell growth area, effective substrate stiffness, and pattern
geometry. These experimental parameters represent opportunities to better design optimal cell
culture platforms. Investigating how these factors affect NRVM contractility is a subject of
ongoing studies.
(4) Molecular features: gene expression signatures
Fetal genes are expressed during development but are downregulated during normal
postnatal growth and adulthood (48). Anf and Acta1 are upregulated during cardiac disease and
the expression of both was attenuated in NRVMs cultured on all PEG hydrogels relative to
TCPS. In comparing 1:1 patterned to smooth hydrogels, Anf expression increased ~2.4-4.4 fold,
thus mimicking fold changes seen clinically when volumetric overload of the heart causes
stretching of the myocardium and increased matrix stiffness sensed by the myocytes (49).
Expression of Acta1 has been positively correlated with contractile function (50), a phenomenon
we observed with increasing aspect ratio on 10kPa substrates. However, our study also supports
the observation that Acta1 expression increases with increasing disease burden as we measured
the highest levels of Acta1 on 35kPa gels with ∞:1 patterns, where we also measured lowest
fractional shortening (Figure 5). Notably, we measured as great an increase in Anf and Acta1
expression due to increasing the pattern aspect ratio as due to increasing the substrate stiffness.
These data suggest that patterning had a greater effect on Anf and Acta1 when presented in stiff
environments compared to soft.
Matrix remodeling, alterations in normal calcium handling, and a decrease in the
αMHC/βMHC ratio are also seen in cardiac disease (51). Connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) is induced during heart failure (52). It is upstream of many ECM remodeling pathways
and the accumulation of matrix proteins, such as collagens, results in fibrosis further leading to
dysfunction and even sudden cardiac death. Increasing pattern aspect ratio led to increasing Ctgf
expression regardless of substrate stiffness (Figure S2). However, the expression of Col1a1 was
significantly lower than TCPS only on soft hydrogels. These findings suggest that global ECM
remodeling is sensitive to small changes in substrate stiffness. Although we did not observe
differential expression of the calcium handling genes Cav1.2 and Serca2a in any of our
conditions (Figure S1), a larger range of substrate stiffness may be required to observe the same
changes found in other studies. αMHC expression was greater on soft, 10kPa gels than on stiff
gels. While we measured generally higher (and thus more physiologic) αMHC/βMHC ratios on
soft gels (Figure 6), the αMHC/βMHC ratio appears to decline beyond the 4:1 aspect ratio and
ultimately approach that of the 35kPa gels. This suggests increasing pathologic state with
increasing aspect ratio. We also found significantly decreased expression of miR-208a on 10kPa
gels relative to TCPS but a positive regression slope with increasing aspect ratio. Increased

human patient serum levels of miR-208a and miR-499 have been observed after myocardial
infarction (53), and transgenic overexpression of each is sufficient to cause cardiac hypertrophy
and dysfunction in mice (37, 54).Once again, high aspect ratios begin to counteract the beneficial
effects of soft substrates. These results suggest that softer substrates promote greater contractility
as well as reduced pathological gene expression at intermediate aspect ratios, as summarized in
Figure 7.
Study Limitations and Future Directions
This work along with the previous studies referenced herein indicate that substrate
modulus and topography are strong stimuli for cardiomyocyte adaptation to environmental
changes and that the culture platform can be manipulated to mimic both pathologic and
physiologic cardiac states. The ultimate goal in modeling cardiomyocyte biology, however, is to
establish a system conducive to culturing adult human cardiomyocytes. The study presented here
uses NRVMs, which are both a different species and a different developmental stage.
Unfortunately, current iPSC-derived human cardiomyocytes more closely resemble fetal
cardiomyocytes and often these cultures differentiate to mixtures of atrial, ventricular, and nodal
cardiomyocytes (55). Ribeiro and colleagues demonstrated that gel-based culture platforms with
patterned adhesion islands could improve differentiation of iPSC-derived human
cardiomyocytes, although their system imposes cellular morphology through adhesion islands
with no resulting gene expression differences between patterned and unpatterned substrates (29).
Given that our system simply provides topographical cues with significant consequences to
multiple aspects of cellular mechanics and physiology, it would be interesting to evaluate
whether further improvements to iPSC differentiation, particularly with respect to cell fate, could
be achieved with our system. Another key consideration is the three dimensional environment of
the culture platform. In our current system as well as many published systems, cells are cultured
on top of gels. However, the heart is a three-dimensional organ and ventricular myocytes are
typically encased in the extracellular matrix. In a two-dimensional culture platform, only one
face of the cell is in contact with the substrate, creating a differential with respect to mechanical
and chemical cues. Thus a logical extension is to move towards a three-dimensional hydrogelbased culture system, an active area of investigation. Indeed, Ronaldson-Bouchard and
colleagues have achieved vast improvements in maturation (ultrastructure, gene expression,
contractile properties, metabolic profiles, and calcium handling) of in vitro differentiated hiPSCderived cardiomyocytes by combining three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel platforms with dynamic
electrical stimulation regimes beginning early in differentiation (56). Combining this approach
with a tunable hydrogel system whose stiffness could be matured from a more pliant, fetal range
to a stiffer, more adult-like range while the cells differentiate is intriguing. In addition,
translating 2D topographical patterning to 3D cell culture environments is an area of growing
interest, and photopatternable materials, as the one used here, provide specific advantages over
micromolding or microprinting techniques when combined with single and two photon laser
lithography. Such a system would also be amenable to modeling interfaces, such as between the
border zone and the infarct zone of an infarcted heart.
We measured contractility as an indicator of cardiomyocyte function, but another key
functional measurement is the traction forces the cell exerts on the substrate as it contracts.
While this technique has been well-refined for cells on planar surfaces, it is still being developed
for cells on three-dimensional substrates (57). Non-planar substrates lead to large error in the z
direction with variable point spread functions, making reliable analysis with typical equipment

difficult. Advances in hardware and analytical approaches should make this a more tractable
problem in the future.
Conclusions
Cardiac myocytes sense and interact with their microenvironment through a wide range
of biochemical and morphological responses (Figure 7). Here, biochemical and biophysical
approaches were used to investigate how NRVMs respond to multiple, concurrent
microenvironmental cues, namely substrate stiffness and patterning. In contrast to previous
studies that examined the response of NRVMs to only a single factor, this study demonstrated
that both substrate stiffness and topographical patterning synergistically affect cellular
morphology, NRVM gene expression profiles and contractility. In many cases, we observed the
effects due to substrate stiffness only at certain pattern aspect ratios. This study underscores how
cells can integrate multiple microenvironmental cues, and that concurrent signals can
synergistically alter cell function. Because of the complexity of the cellular response to matrix
signals, it is essential to test several experimental factors in in vitro disease models, since results
from modifying only one factor may mask the effects of other critical factors. In addition, many
studies evaluating the cellular response to environment measure few outputs, such as cell
morphology. However, this study reveals that a broad range of cellular metrics (i.e., physical,
morphological, functional, and molecular) must be tested in order to fully evaluate the health of a
cardiomyocyte: gross readouts such as cell morphology can be misleading when considered
alone. Importantly, simultaneous presentation of substrate stiffness and topographical cues
replicates fold changes in cell morphology and gene expression observed in vitro as well as in
animal models of cardiac disease. The collective results suggest that differences in the
microenvironmental stiffness and patterns that influence cell-matrix interactions are both
important in regulating cardiac myocyte gene expression and contractile response. Recreating
multiple aspects of in vivo systems using bioscaffolds with tunable properties for in vitro
experiments provides complementary information that allows investigators to more
comprehensively understand how cells respond to physiological and pathological
microenvironments.
Materials and Methods
Hydrogel formulation
A photodegradable PEG crosslinker (PEGdiPDA) was synthesized as previously
described (58). PEGdiPDA (Mn ~ 4070 g/mol, 8.2 wt%) was copolymerized with poly(ethylene
glycol) monoacrylate (Mn ~ 400 g/mol, 6.8 wt%, Monomer-Polymer and Dajac Laboratories,
Inc) via a radical initiated chain polymerization. Gelatin (100 bloom, 1mg/mL, MP Biomedicals)
was included in the monomer solution to promote cell-matrix interactions and adhesion. Gelation
was initiated through a redox reaction by combining 0.2M ammonium persulfate with 0.1M
tetraethylmethylenediamine. The monomer solution was briefly vortexed and pipetted between a
glass slide and glass coverslip that was functionalized with acrylate groups (59) to covalently
link the final hydrogel to the coverslip. After gelation (~5 minutes), hydrogels were briefly
immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), separated from the glass slide, and stored in PBS
at 4°C until use. Rheological measurements of the initial, stiff (35kPa, Young’s modulus) gels
were similar to previous studies from our group (60).

Generation of micropatterned substrates
A custom photomask was used to control the pattern of light illumination and generate
topographical patterns on polymerized gels. The originally fabricated stiff gels (35kPa) were
placed in contact with the selected photomask and subsequently irradiated with collimated
365nm light (Omnicure) at 15mW/cm2 for 300s. The photomask allowed transfer of
micropatterned rectangles to the gel substrate that were 5μm apart with geometries of 5 μm x
5 μm, 10 μm x 5 μm, 20 μm x 5 μm, 40 μm x 5 μm and 5 μm wide channels corresponding to
aspect ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 and infinity:1 (∞:1) (Figure 1). To generate soft patterned
substrates, a set of patterned gels was then uniformly irradiated, without a photomask, for 300s.
This additional exposure step generated substrates with a reduced crosslinking density,
corresponding to a 10kPa gel stiffness. Smooth, unpatterned, 35kPa and 10kPa gels were also
used. The irradiation time used to generate soft surfaces, via controlled photodegradation of the
hydrogel crosslinks, was similar to the time scale and values reported in previous studies (60). In
previous studies from our group, we validated rheometry measurements of irradiated gels by
atomic force microscopy and validated pattern uniformity by two-photon confocal laser scanning
microscopy (61).
Cell isolation and culture
Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated according to previously published
procedures (62). Unless noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Briefly, hearts were
excised from 1-3 day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. The atria were removed from the hearts and
discarded. The remaining ventricle sections were minced using scissors and digested in trypsin.
After pre-plating for 2 hours, NRVMs in suspension were collected and counted. Primary cell
isolates were seeded at ~50,000 cells/cm2 on gel samples or on gelatin coated standard tissue
culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates. During the first 24 hours of culture, cells were plated in
growth media containing Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with Hank’s salts (Gibco), 5 vol%
calf serum, 50U/mL penicillin, 2μg/mL Vitamin B-12, and 30nM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).
After 24 hours, cells were washed, and the media was changed to one consisting of MEM,
10μg/mL insulin, 10μg/mL transferrin, 0.1 wt/vol% bovine serum albumen (BSA), 50U/mL
penicillin, 2μg/mL Vitamin B-12, 30nM BruU, and 10 vol% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For
subsequent experiments, cells were collected or stained at day 4. All animal procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado.
Fractional shortening
Videos of spontaneously contracting cardiac myocytes were collected through a 40x
objective (1.0 NA) at 50 frames per second using a high-speed camera (HiSpec1 G2, Fastec
Imaging) on an upright widefield fluorescence microscope (Examiner.Z1, Zeiss). While imaging,
cells were maintained in warm Tyrode’s solution, and before imaging, cells were pre-incubated
with 2μM CellTracker Red CMPTX (Life Technologies) for visualization under fluorescence
and for later segmentation and contractility measurements.
Cell staining
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 minutes,
washed in PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 3 minutes. F-actin and
nuclei were stained with phalloidin conjugated to an Alexa Fluor 488 fluorophore (Life
Technologies) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI (Life Technologies), according to

NLO) and processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA).
Image analysis
Organization of F-actin fibers was quantified with Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) to
calculate the percent of fibers aligned with the mean fiber angle (63, 64). Images of F-actin fibers
were thresholded using Otsu’s method, windowed by applying a 2D Tukey window, and a fast
Fourier transform (FFT) was performed. The power spectrum of the FFT was used to generate a
histogram of frequency intensities between -89° and 90°. Aligned F-actin fibers were defined as
those whose orientations were ±20° of the mean fiber angle. Thus, the working range of percent
alignment was at least ~22% for randomly oriented fibers and 100% for samples where all fibers
were within ±20° of the mean angle. The percent alignment of gel samples was further
normalized to the mean percent alignment of cells cultured on TCPS.
Percent fractional shortening (FS) was calculated from videos of contracting cells

Here, LS is the major axis of a maximally contracted cell and LD is the major axis of a fully
relaxed cell. Videos of single contracting cells were analyzed using a custom Matlab script.
Individual frames from each video were thresholded and individual cells were identified. The
area was calculated using a built-in Matlab function, regionprops. Because individual, nonconfluent cells were analyzed, the outline of the cell was easily segmented and outlined. The
boundary of the cell was fit to an ellipse using built-in Matlab functions. The cell aspect ratio
was calculated as the ratio of the major axis length to the minor axis length.
The degree of cell alignment with respect to the pattern orientation was measured using a
custom ImageJ macro. The alignment of the cell was assumed to follow the alignment of the
nucleus (65). The major axis of the pattern was manually measured and followed by an
automated measurement of the nuclear orientation from the DAPI channel image. The alignment
of cells with respect to the pattern orientation was calculated by subtracting the measured angle
of cell nuclei from the manually measured major axis of the pattern. Mean angle differences
were calculated using circular statistics (66).
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
RNA was isolated using a commercial kit (RNAmicro kit, Zymo Research), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality were measured using a
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 1000, Thermo Scientific), and samples were stored at -70°C until
further use. For mRNA analysis, cDNA was synthesized using a commercial kit (SuperScript III
First-strand synthesis kit, Invitrogen) using random hexamers according to kit instructions. For
qPCR, a 10μL reaction volume mastermix was prepared, containing forward and reverse primers
(420nM each) and SYBR green (Applied Biosystems). The mastermix was loaded onto 96 well
plates and reactions took place on a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) programmed according to SYBR
green instructions. Ribosomal protein 30 (RPL30) was used as the reference gene and relative

quantification with the Pfaffl method was used to determine gene expression changes. Target
genes are listed in Table S1.
For miRNA analysis, Taqman®-based assays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 6.67 ng total RNA was reverse
transcribed in 10μL using a TaqMan® MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems catalog #4366596). miRNA expression was assessed with 20μL reactions prepared
from the TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix, no AmpErase® UNG kit (Applied Biosystems
catalog #4324018) and the appropriate TaqMan MicroRNA assay (catalog #4427975) on a BioRad thermal cycler with cycling conditions according to the TaqMan instructions. Relative
quantification based on the ΔΔCT method was performed with U6 RNA as the reference gene.
Data analysis
Each experiment consisted of at least 9 replicates from several independent cell
isolations. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The effects of
substrate stiffness and pattern geometry were analyzed by defining pattern geometry as an
ordered factor and applying general linear models in R (67). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to estimate the effect of pattern geometry and substrate stiffness on the experimental
outputs. Regressions were used to separately estimate the effect of pattern geometry on cells that
were cultured on either soft or stiff substrates. Pattern aspect ratios were entered as ordered
categorical factors in the following order: smooth, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 and infinity:1 (∞:1). Slopes
that were significantly greater than zero indicated a significant effect in the cellular response
with increasing aspect ratio in the topography of the hydrogel surface. Post-hoc, pairwise
comparisons were also performed, and p-values adjusted using Bonferroni’s correction. Cell
alignment data were analyzed using circular statistics, and the equal kappa test was used to
determine whether standard deviations were statistically different from smooth and patterned
surfaces. While biological systems are often nonlinear, general linear models provide
conservative measures of experimental effects and minimize chances of overfitting the data.
Effects, slopes, and comparisons were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Figure Legends:
Figure 1. Fabrication and characterization of smooth or stiff photopatterned PEG hydrogel
cell culture substrates A. A monolithic gel with Young’s stiffness of 35kPa was fabricated with
entrapped gelatin as an adhesive ECM ligand. Microtopographies were generated by directing
collimated 365nm light (15mW/cm2) through a photomask. Feature dimensions were 5μm x
5μm, 10μm x 5μm, 20μm x 5μm, and 40μm x 5μm. Channels were 5μm wide. All features were
spaced 5μm apart. B. Gels were then softened to 10kPa by irradiating with 365nm (10mW/cm2)
light to decrease crosslinking density at the gel surface. C. To generate soft substrates, gels with
an initial stiffness of 35kPa were irradiated for 5 minutes to reach a final soft stiffness of 10kPa.
D. After swelling in PBS for 2-3 days, NRVMs were seeded on the patterned gels at a density of
50,000 cells/cm2. E. Time-sweep of the Young’s modulus when the hydrogel was exposed to
365nm (10mW/cm2) light.
Figure 2. Sarcomeres in cells cultured on hydrogels are more organized than cells cultured
on TCPS. Fluorescent staining of F-actin (green) in NRVMs cultured on TCPS or 10kPa gels
patterned with 5 μm channels (∞:1 aspect ratio). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). NRVMs
were also spontaneously contracting by day 4 of culture.
Figure 3. Cells exhibit greater alignment to the substrate pattern as the aspect ratio of the
pattern increases from 1:1 to ∞:1. A. The angular difference between the pattern and the major
axis of each cell nucleus was calculated. (not to scale) B. The horizontal axis represents the
angular difference between the substrate major axis and the major axis of cell nuclei. C. The
increase in nuclear alignment with the pattern can be visualized by plotting the variance of the
histograms from the above panes. On 8:1 and ∞:1 patterns, the circular standard deviation was
significantly lower than smooth gel and TCPS conditions for both 10kPa and 35kPa gels. n =
200-400 cells per group. * indicate p < 0.05 vs. smooth group based on the equal kappa test.
Figure 4. Topographical cues direct NRVM morphology and F-actin alignment. A.
Fluorescent and brightfield images show greater F-actin alignment within cells for NRVMs
cultured on substrates with increasing pattern aspect ratio. A relatively cell-free area neighboring
the region chosen for the F-actin/DAPI panel in the same field of view was selected to reveal the
gel pattern. B. Cell aspect ratios increase with increasing pattern aspect ratio. C. F-actin
alignment increases with increasing pattern aspect ratio and is greater in 35kPa gels than in
10kPa gels for 1:1 aspect ratio gels. * next to legend indicates p < 0.05 for regression slope
* = p < 0.05 for 10kPa vs. 35kPa, t = p < 0.05 vs. TCPS
Figure 5. Fractional shortening increases with aspect ratio in softer gels but decreases at
highest aspect ratio in stiff gels. Aspect ratios of 2:1 or greater increase fractional shortening
relative to TCPS in soft gels. The stiff, channeled pattern significantly reduces fractional
shortening relative to soft channels. * next to legend indicates p < 0.05 for regression slope
* = p < 0.05 for 10kPa vs. 35kPa, t = p < 0.05 vs. TCPS

significantly greater on stiff gels vs soft at aspect ratios greater than 1:1 and increases with
increasing pattern aspect ratio. B. Alpha-myosin heavy chain (Myh6) expression decreases while
beta-myosin heavy chain increases on stiff vs soft gels and with increasing aspect ratio. C. miR208a expression decreases on patterned 10kPa hydrogels. miR-208a expression also increases
with increasing pattern aspect ratio on 10kPa gels. The fold change magnitude of miR-499
expression on hydrogels vs. TCPS was large but statistically insignificant due to biological

Figure 7. Substrate stiffness and topographical cues significantly affect NRVM physiology.
Culturing NRVMs on 10kPa patterned hydrogels resulted in attenuated pathological gene
expression as well as increased fractional shortening. Using a range of patterns and substrate
stiffnesses, we were able to capture both physiological and pathological states.
