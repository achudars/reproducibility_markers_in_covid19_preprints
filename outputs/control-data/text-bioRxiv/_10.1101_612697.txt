Abstract
Many species, including humans, are sensitive to social signals and the valuation of these social cues
is important in maintaining social interactions. Social value, derived from social cues, thus could act
as a reinforcer and influence reward learning. Here, we introduce a novel task in rats that investigates
if social value can drive reinforcement learning about novel stimuli. Using the blocking/unblocking
paradigm originally developed in the (non-social) reinforcement learning literature, we found that when
actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-reward association producing reward for themselves, adding
a cue that predicted an additional reward delivery to a partner rat unblocked associative learning about
this cue in the actor rats. In contrast, additional cues that did not predict additional reward remained
blocked from acquiring associative value. In a control experiment where putative social cue exchange
between the partnered rats was prevented, the normally unblocked cues now remained blocked as
expected. Taken together, these results suggest that social value can drive reinforcement learning in
rats, and that the transmission of social cues is necessary for this learning, driven by social value, to
occur.

Introduction
The need for frequent and meaningful social interactions is a fundamental human motivation [1]
inherent in social relationships and contributes to mental and physical health [2]. From an evolutionary
perspective, the ability to acquire value from a positive social interaction may have stimulated the
development of mutual cooperative social interactions [3], the preference of prosocial outcomes to
familiar partners [4,5] and the helping of others in need [6]. One of the driving forces behind these
complex social behaviours could be, among others, the positive value that is derived from social
interactions [7]. Social interactions contain social signals that can carry value to oneself, such as
friendly faces in humans [8], appetitive pictures of conspecifics in monkeys [9] and playback of positive
50 kHz calls in rats [10]. The rewarding aspects of social reward have furthermore been shown to
reinforce Pavlovian learning about novel stimuli. Humans for example learn to respond faster to stimuli
that become associated with positive social reinforcement [11] and monkeys choose stimuli that
predicted a reward delivery to a conspecific more than the stimuli that predicted no reward delivery
[12]. It has also been found, using operant instrumental conditioning paradigms, that rats can be
conditioned to press a lever to access various degrees of social contact and interactions with another
rat [13,14], and that rats are also willing to work for social play periods [15]. It however remains unclear
whether in rats, next to humans and monkeys, social value can drive learning about novel stimuli in an
associative stimulus-outcome learning setting. Previous research has indicated that vocalisations of
rats in the 50 kHz range, thought to represent positive affect [16], lead to both an approach response
[10] and dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens NAcc [17]: two important components that can
drive reinforcement learning of new cues [18,19]. There is furthermore evidence suggesting that
observing another rat being rewarded is rewarding by itself as it is accompanied by 50 kHz
vocalisations and dopamine release in the NAcc of the observer rat [20].
In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that social value can act as a reinforcer and thus can also
drive new learning. To investigate our hypothesis, we use a well-established behavioural paradigm in
associative learning called blocking. Kamin [21] found in simple stimulus-outcome association tasks
that if new stimuli are added to a stimulus that already fully predicts a reward, associative learning
about those additional stimuli will be blocked. Reinforcement learning about additional stimuli can
become unblocked, however, by an increase in reward value or a change in reward identity contingent
on the presentation of the new stimuli. This additional or change in value is then thought to be
associated to these new stimuli and thus alters their incentive value [22]. We hypothesise that
rewarding social outcomes, such as sugar pellet deliveries to a partner rat, will also be capable to
unblock learning about newly added stimuli, indicative of an increased value of mutual-rewards relative
to own-rewards. We tested this hypothesis by adopting a task from McDannald et al. [23] where
unblocking is operationalised by adding additional pellet deliveries conditional on a second cue
presented in compound with a learned cue that already fully predicted reward. We modified this task
in such a way that the second cue is now followed by a food reward delivery to a partner rat, rather
than increasing one's own reward. In addition, a third control cue added in compound to the learned

cue (on different trials) was not followed by food reward delivery to a partner rat. Concretely, we thus
hypothesized that the associative learning about the second stimulus would become unblocked by
mutual-reward outcomes, that is, by adding social value. In contrast, the third cue should remain
blocked from acquiring associative value. We indeed found that, when tested in extinction, the
unblocked second cue had acquired more associative value, as indexed by conditioned responding
at the food trough, in comparison to the third blocked cue. We thus conclude that social value can
support reinforcement learning processes involving novel cues. This opens up possibilities to
investigate behavioural aspects of the social-value driven reinforcement learning and its associated
neural basis, processes that might be disturbed in psychiatric disorders marked by impaired
reinforcement learning and/or social behavior such as autism [24] and schizophrenia [25].

Materials and Methods
Subjects 56 male Long Evans rats where housed in pairs of two and kept under an inverted 12:12 h
light dark cycle, in a temperature (20 ± 2 ºC) and humidity-controlled (approx. 60%) colony room. All
rats had ad libitum access to food, except during the testing period. During behavioural testing, the
rats where food restricted (20 grams on weekdays and 22 grams in the weekend) and maintained a
body weight of about 90% of their free-feeding weight. All testing was performed in accordance with
the German Welfare Act and was approved by the local authority LANUV (Landesamt für Natur-,
Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, AZ 84-02.04.2016.A522)
Apparatus. Testing was conducted in 4 customised PhenoTyper (Noldus Information Technology)
behavioural testing boxes (Fig. 1A) of 45 by 45 by 55 cm, supplemented with operant devices (Med
Associates) and placed inside a custom-made sound- and lightproof ventilated box. The boxes where
modified by adding a custom-made Plexiglas separation wall (Fig. 1A, left panel), which divided the
box into two compartments, to allow the training of a pair of rats at the same time. The separation wall
was equipped with a sliding door (dimensions: 20 by 20 cm, located at 7 cm from the left side of the
Skinner box) and 4 rectangular interaction windows (Fig. 1A, left panel; size: 10 by 1.5 cm) that were
positioned exactly in between the door and the wall holding the stimulation devices used for
conditioning.
Both compartments of the box contained a food trough (Med Associates, ENV-254-CB) positioned in
the middle on the right side. The food troughs were adapted in such a way that the detection
photobeams were positioned at the entry point of the food trough. The food trough was connected to
an automated pellet dispenser (PTPD-0010, Noldus Information Technology) that delivered sucrose
pellets (20 mg dustless precision pellets, Bio-Serv, Germany). Operant devices were positioned on the
right side of the box at the level of the separation wall: an LED Stimulus Light (Med Associates, ENV211m) with green cover was positioned 10 cm above the ground and a house light (Med Associates,
ENV-215m) 28 cm above the ground. A speaker (Med Associates, ENV-224am) was positioned at 20
cm above the ground for the playback of auditory stimuli (Fig. 1A, right panel). Auditory stimuli were
played back at a loudness of 75 dB measured with a hand-held analyser (type 2250-S from Brüel and
Kjaer) right in front of the speaker. In the top cover of the Skinner boxes, a camera (Basler, acA130060gc, GigE) was positioned to obtain videos of the behavioural experiment at 25 fps. Analyses of the
recorded videos was performed with EthoVision XT 11.5 (Noldus Information Technology). Finally, a
USV-microphone was positioned next to the camera for recording ultrasonic vocalisations using Ultra
Vox XT (Noldus Information Technology).

compartment while at a different time partner rats learned to discriminate two auditory cues in the lower compartment. In
the compound phase target and partner rat are either both rewarded (Both Reward), target rat is rewarded while the partner
is not rewarded (Own Reward) or both target and partner rat are not rewarded (No Reward). In the probe trials all learned
cues are presented to the target rat without reward. (C) Here, a timeline is shown with the different components that make
up a single trial throughout the discrimination learning, compound phase and probe trials.

Behavioural Training
Pavlovian discrimination task. Before the start of behavioural training, rats were put on food
restriction to reduce their weight to 90% of their free-feeding weight. Within a pair of cage mates, one
rat was assigned at random as the actor animal, and the other as the partner animals. As a first step,
they were habituated to their pre-determined training side of the customised PhenoTyper for 3 days
(15 minutes per day). During this period, they could retrieve 6 pellets that were put along the edges of
their respective side of the box. Subsequently, the discrimination learning phase started. Here, the
pairs of rat cage mates were divided into two groups; one group of rat pairs would learn a visual
discrimination problem, and the other an auditory discrimination problem. The visual stimuli to be
discriminated consisted of a houselights flashing at 1 Hz (0.1sec on, 0.9 sec off) and a steady green
light; the auditory stimuli were made up by a 4.0 kHz clicker (0.1sec on, 0.9 sec off) and a 1.5 kHz (75
dB) steady tone. We counterbalanced the CS+ and CS- condition assignment to each stimulus across
rat pairs. The different groups (Auditory vs Visual) were each trained alone either in the upper or lower
compartment of the Skinner box, and the side assignments between actor and partner rats were
counterbalanced between experiments (Fig. 1A). Each rat received 14 days of discrimination training.
One daily session consisted of 40 trials, of which 20 trials were CS+ and 20 CS-. The order of CS+
and CS- trials was pseudo-randomized, with no more than 3 trials of one kind occurring in a row.
Stimuli were presented for 30s and at every 10s (+ 0.1 to 0.4 sec jitter), a pellet was delivered (Fig. 1C).
For N=24 out of the 40 animals in the experimental group and for all N=16 rats in the control
experiment, a second pellet dispenser was placed outside of the behavioural box, on the opposite
side of where the current rat was trained, delivering pellets outside of the box. This was done in order
to have a uniform sound associated with the pellet delivery throughout the experiment avoiding any
difference in pellet delivery related sounds influencing the conditioning to added cues. With the
remaining 16 rats of the experimental group the second pellet dispenser was not placed outside of the
behavioural box, on the opposite side of were the current rat was trained (see comparison of main
effects below). The ITI in both groups was made up of a fixed 30s window supplemented with a
randomized time window ranging from 5 to 100 seconds with steps of 5 ms, uniformly distributed. The
ITIs were thus fully randomized, resulting in a total variable ITI with a mean of 80 ms. Ultrasonic
vocalisations where recorded from 10s before cue onset to 20s after cue offset, for a total duration of
60s per trial. After completion of the discrimination phase, rats progressed to the compound
conditioning stage.
Compound conditioning. After discrimination training was completed, rats in the visual discrimination
group received 1 day of pre-exposure to the two novel auditory stimuli while the rats in the auditory
discrimination group received 1 day of pre-exposure to the two novel visual stimuli. The pre-exposure
session consisted of one session with 6 trials. The stimuli were presented in a randomized order with
ITIs of 15, 30 45, 60, 75 and 90s. Pre-exposure was done to reduce possible novelty-induced akinesia
[26,27] for each group. Cues were presented for 30s in the same manner as described for the
discrimination period, only without reward. After pre-exposure, all rats received 4 days of compound

training. During compound conditioning, both rats were trained together in the same Skinner box, each
in their own compartment. Three different conditions were implemented; Both Reward (BR), Own
Reward (OR) and No Reward (NR, Fig. 1B, middle panel). Rats from one Target group were rewarded
on BR and OR trials, but not on NR trials, while rats from the Partner group were only reward on BR
trials, but not on OR and NR trials. During BR trials, both the (respective visual or auditory) CS+ of the
Target group and the Partner group were simultaneously displayed and both rats were rewarded with
3 pellets. In the OR trials, the respective CS+ of Target group was simultaneously displayed with the
CS- of the Partner group and only the Target group was rewarded. In the NR, both groups were
presented their respective CS- and none of the rats were rewarded. Assignment of visualdiscrimination-trained and auditory-discrimination-trained rats to either Actor or Partner groups was
counterbalanced across experiments. A compound conditioning session consisted of 20 trials per
condition. The Conditions BR, OR and NR were pseudo-randomized with every condition not being
repeated more than 3 times in a row. ITI randomization, stimulus presentation and reward delivery
were implemented as in the discrimination phase.
Probe trials. During probe trials, all rats were tested in isolation for one extinction session in their
assigned box compartment. All stimuli were now presented in isolation, both the CS+ and CS- learned
in the Pavlovian discrimination task as well as the two novel stimuli added in the compound phase, for
which learning was hypothesised to become unblocked and blocked, respectively. Rats in both groups
went through 14 trials for each of these 4 stimuli, presented in isolation and without reward delivery
(Fig. 1B, right panel). The 4 stimuli were pseudo-randomized with every condition not being repeated
more than 3 times in a row.
Control experiment. In the control experiment, 8 Target rats and 8 Partner rats went through the same
three experimental conditions. The only difference here is that during the compound phase, the wall
that separated the Skinner box compartments was rendered opaque by adding an additional black
wall, to block contact between the Target and Partner rats. We hypothesised that if visual, and/or
auditory and/or olfactory contact between the rats facilitated the social information transmission that
would unblock reinforcement learning of compound cues, then obstructing these transmission cues
should impair unblocking.
Statistical data analyses. Entries into the food trough were recorded as photobeam breaks. Raw
data were processed in EthoVision XT 11.5 (Noldus Information Technology) to extract our dependent
variables: time spent in the food trough and number of entries in the trough (food cup rate). Food cup
directed behavior in the form of time spent in the food trough, food cup rate and latency to entry were
analysed per trial and per condition for all stages of learning; further analysis and graph preparation
was performed using custom-made scripts in MATLAB (version 2014b, MathWorks). Both the
percentage of time spent at the food trough and rate of food trough responding where used (Burke et
al., 2008; McDannald et al., 2011) as measures of conditioned responding. To assess the strength of
learning during discrimination and compound conditioning and probe trials, only the first 10s of the

cue period was analysed to avoid the influence of reward delivery/omission feedback [23].
Discrimination learning performance was quantified by averaging responding to the cues over the last
4 days of training and comparing the mean between CS+ and CS- using a paired sample t-test.
Performance in the compound phase was quantified using a 2 factor repeated measures ANOVA on
the mean response rate per day across conditions (BR, OR and NR) and post hoc tests were performed
to assess the significance of any differences between conditions, corrected for multiple comparisons.
Simple contrasts were calculated to further compare the difference between conditions on the different
days against the last day of compound conditioning. Performance in the probe trials was assessed by
averaging responding over 5 bins (2 trials per bin) and running a two factor repeated measures ANOVA
over these bins and the 4 stimuli types (CS+, unblocked, blocked and CS-). Differences between
conditions and bins were assessed with post-hoc tests, again corrected for multiple comparisons.
Here, simple contrasts were calculated, comparing the difference between conditions on the different
bins against the last bin of extinction. Finally, also a non-parametric Friedman two-way ANOVA test
on the differences among the latency to entries including all trials (excluding all non-entered trials)
between the conditions in the probe trials were performed. Differences between conditions were
assessed with post-hoc tests, again corrected for multiple comparisons.

Results
Experimental group
Discrimination learning. Target rats were trained on a visual or auditory discrimination task. All rats
developed a conditioned response to the CS+, resulting in an increase in time spent in the food trough
on CS+ trials, independent of cue modality or identity. Concurrently, they learned to expect no reward
during CS- presentations, as witnessed by a steady decrease in time spent in the food trough on CStrials (Fig. 2A). A paired samples t-test examining the mean responding over the last 4 days of
conditioning was performed. We found a significant difference in time spent in the food trough between
the CS+ (M = 58.76, SD=12,86) and CS- (M=21.19, SD= 13,21; t(19) = 12.109, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2A). Next
to that, the food cup rate was significantly different between the CS+ (M = 3.07, SD = 1.70) and CS(M = 0.90, SD = 0.55); t (19) = 6.03, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2D). Finally, rats also developed a faster mean
latency to entry for the CS+ and a slower entry for the CS- over the course of behavioural training
(Supplemental Fig. 1A). These results indicate that our rats discriminated between auditory cues that
differed in tone frequency (1.5 kHz vs. 4 kHz) and temporal presentation (steady tone vs 1Hz clicker
(0.1 ms per 1s on). The same held for the visual cues that differed in colour (green vs white) and
temporal presentation pattern (steady vs 1 Hz flicker (0.1 ms per 1s on).

Social learning. We aimed to show the influence of adding cues onto learned discriminated cues
(forming a compound) with the following social outcomes: Both Reward (BR), Own Reward (OR) and
No Reward (NR; Fig. 1B). Rats Pavlovian conditioned responses to these compound cues are shown
and a direct comparison of these responses to the original CS+ and CS- cues is made (Fig. 1B), both
indexed by time spent in the food cup and the food cup rate. In the subsequent analysis, only the
behavior of the Target rats is reported. A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA with condition and day
as factors and the time spent in food trough as dependent variable was performed. We found a
significant main effect of condition type (F (2, 38) = 417,04 p < 0.01). This effect was explained by a
greater responding on BR and OR trials compared to NR trials (both p < 0.01, Bonferroni-corrected;
Fig. 2B) and no difference between responding on the BR compared to the OR condition (p = 1.00).
Furthermore, a paired samples t-test revealed that responding for BR (M = 61.8, SD = 7.08) did not
significantly differ from the average response rate over the last 4 days of discrimination learning for
the CS+ (M = 58.76, SD = 12.85,21); t(19) = 0.907, p = 0.376). A similar patterns was found for OR
trials (M = 63.1, SD = 6.93) in comparison to CS+ trials (M = 58.76, SD = 12.85,21); t(19)=1.334, p =
0.198). We found no main effect of day (F = 2.248, p = 0.092) but did find a significant interaction
(3, 57)

between condition and day (F(6,114) = 2.795, p=0.014). Simple contrasts revealed that the difference
between condition BR and NR (F(1,19) = 7,238, p = 0.014) and the difference between conditions OR
and NR (F(1,19) = 6.898, p = 0.017) was significantly higher for day 4 compared to day 1 (Fig. 2B). The
increase in differences between BR and NR trials and between OR and NR trials, when contrasting
day 1 and day 4, is furthermore driven by a decrease of responding on the NR trials over days, as
witnessed by a significant decrease when directly comparing day 1 (M = 32.63, SD= 8.47) to day 4 (M
= 25.97, SD= 7.68); t(19) = 2.898, p = 0.009 (Fig. 2B, light grey line). A paired samples t-test revealed
that responding on NR trials was significantly higher on day 1 (M = 32.64, SD = 8.47) than responding,
averaged over the last 4 days of discrimination learning, for CS- trials (M = 21.18, SD = 13.21); t(19)=
3.218, p = 0.005. Responding on NR day 4 however (M = 25.97, SD = 7,68; ) did not differ anymore
from responding to CS- averaged over the last 4 days of discrimination learning; t(19)= 1.523, p =
0.114. Additionally, we observed a faster mean latency to entry on BR and OR trials compared to NR
trials throughout the compound phase (Supplemental Fig. 2B). We conclude from these results that
adding a second cue, which predicts either a reward (BR) or no reward (OR) to the partner, to the
target rats CS+ did not change the target rat responding on BR and OR in comparison to its originally
learned CS+ response at the end of discrimination. However, adding a second cue, which predicts no
reward (NR) to the partner, on a learned CS- response did change the target rats responding on the
NR condition. Here, a transient increased responding was found that over 4 days decreased back to
the CS- responding found at the end of discrimination learning. Most importantly, both BR and OR
trials, including the CS+ as part of the compound, still elicited more responses than NR (CScompound) trials.
A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA with condition and day as factors was also performed for the
food cup rate. We found a main effect of condition type on food cup rate (F(2, 38) = 685.349, p < 0.01).

This effect was explained by a higher food cup rate on BR and OR trials compared to NR trials (both
p < 0.01; Fig. 2E). Furthermore, a paired samples t-test revealed that food cup rate did not differ for
BR trials (M = 2.68, SD = 0.28) in comparison to the average of the last 4 days of responding for the
CS+ (M = 3.07, SD = 1.63); t(19) = -0.571, p = 0.575), or for OR trials (M = 2.85, SD = 0.54); t(19) = 0.554, p = 0.586). We did not find an effect of days on food cup rate (F = 0.640, p = 0.592) but did
(3, 57)

find an interaction between day and condition (F(3, 57) = 2.960, p=0.010). Simple contrasts revealed that
the difference between condition BR and NR (F(1,19) = 8.266, p = 0.010) and the difference between
conditions OR and NR (F(1,19) = 5.565, p = 0.014) was, here, also significantly higher for day 4 compared
to day 1. However there was also a significant contrast indicating that the difference between BR and
NR was larger on day 4 then on day 3 (F(1,19) = 1.653, p = 0.031; Fig. 2B). A paired samples t-test
furthermore revealed that responding to NR on day 1 (M = 1.38, SD = 0.34) was significantly higher
than responding on the last 4 days of CS- (M = 0.89, SD = 0.43); t(19) = 4.349, p = 0.000). Again, like
for the time spent in the food trough, responding on NR day 4 however (M = 1.01, SD = 0.32); t(19) =
881, p = 0.389) was not significantly higher than for CS- trials averaged over the last 4 days of
discrimination training. Here as well, the increase in difference between the BR and NR and difference
between OR and NR when contrasting day 1 and day 4 is driven by a further decrease of the value of
the NR over days leading to a significant difference when directly comparing day 1(M = 1.38, SD=
0.34) to 4 (M = 1.01, SD= 0.31); t(19)= 3.279 p = 0.001 (Fig. 2E, light grey line). We conclude from these
results that adding a second cue, which predicts either a reward (BR) or no reward (OR) to the partner,
to the target rats CS+ did also not change the target rat food cup rate on BR and OR in comparison
to its originally learned CS+ response at the end of discrimination. Furthermore, adding a second cue,
which predicts no reward (NR) to the partner, on a learned CS- response changed the target rats
responding on the NR condition. Here, a similar increased food cup rate was found that over 4 days
decreased back to the CS- responding found at the end of discrimination learning. Most importantly,
both BR and OR trials, including the CS+ as part of the compound, still elicited a higher food cup rate
than NR (CS- compound) trials.
Probing associative value. In the probe trials, we aimed to show the effect of social reinforcement
learning of compound cues with different social outcomes by presenting the cues in isolation, omitting
reward, as indexed by the time spent in the food cup, the food cup rate and the latency to entry. We
show the conditioned responding of the target rats to 14 presentations each of the CS+ and CS-, the
unblocked cue associated with an added reward to the partner (BR) and the blocked cue associated
with a no reward to the partner (OR) and no reward to self (NR). A two factor repeated measures
ANOVA with stimulus type and bin as factors and the time spent in the food trough as the dependent
variable was performed. We found a significant main effect of probe trial condition on time spent in
food trough (F (3, 57) = 83.287, p < 0.01).
As expected, time spent in food trough was higher for CS+ than CS- trials (p < 0.01; Fig. 2C). Critically,
pairwise comparisons revealed that time spent in food trough was higher in unblocked cues than
blocked cues across the 5 bins of extinction (p = 0.003; Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we found a significantly

higher responding to the unblocked cue compared to the CS- cue (p < 0.01) while responding to the
blocked cue was not higher than the CS- cue (p = 0.362; Fig. 2C). Additionally, we found a main effect
of bin number on time spent in food trough (F (4, 76) = 18.809, p < 0.01), reflecting the extinction process,
and finally, we found an interaction between condition type and bin number on the time spent in food
trough (F (12,228) = 2.930, p = 0.001). Simple contrasts revealed that the difference between unblocked
and blocked was significantly higher in bin 1 (F(1,19) = 4.94, p = 0.039) and bin 3 (F(1,19) = 7.127, p =
0.015), and trending for bin 2 (F(1,19) = 3.365, p = 0.082) in comparison to that difference observed in
bin 5. Simple contrasts furthermore revealed that the difference in responding for the Unblocked and
CS- cues was significantly higher in bin 1 (F(1,19) = 42.316, p = 0.000), bin 2 (F(1,19) = 10.857, p = 0.004)
and bin 3 (F(1,19) = 15.530, p = 0.001) than the difference observed in bin 5. The difference between the
blocked cue and the CS- on the other hand was significantly higher only in bin 1 compared to bin 5
(F(1,19) = 4.856, p = 0.040). We furthermore found a significant main effect of probe trial condition type
on food cup rate (F(1.676, 31.853) = 24.940, p < 0.01). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the food cup rate
was descriptively higher across the 5 bins of extinction in response to unblocked cues than to blocked
cues (p = 0.084) and significantly higher than to CS- cues (p< 0.01, Fig. 2F). In contrast, responding to
the blocked cue did not differ from responding to the CS- (p = 0.190). We furthermore found a main
effect of bin number on food cup rate (F(4, 76) = 18.629, p < 0.01) as well, in line with extinction processes
and did not find a interaction between condition type and bin number on the food cup rate (F(3.953,75.116)
= 1.630, p = 0.176). A non-parametric Friedman two-way ANOVA test on the differences in the latency
to entry for all trials (excluding all non-entered trials) between the conditions CS+ (median = 3.32),
unblocked (median = 3.56), blocked (median = 6.8) and CS- (median = 9.58) during extinction was
performed. We found a significant effect of probe trial condition on the latency to entry (X2 (3, N = 62) =
23.733, p < 0.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed that latencies to entry were not significantly shorter
for unblocked compared to blocked (p = 0.309) and CS- (p = 0.203) or when comparing blocked and
CS- (p = 1.000). CS+ latencies were, however, significantly shorter than both blocked (p < 0.001) and
CS- (p < 0.001) but not the unblocked cue (p = 0.203). Considering that the blocked cue was
associated with a significantly slower reaction time than the CS+, but not the unblocked cue, the
unblocked cue did show shorter median latencies to entry and a more concentrated peak in its density
function compared to the blocked cue. These results suggest that the latency to entry for the
unblocked cue is more closely related to the CS+ than the blocked cue (Supplemental Fig. 2C).
Taken together, these results show that the rats showed more food cup directed behavior for the
unblocked cue than both the CS- and blocked cue over 10 trials of extinction. This means that when
actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-reward association producing reward for themselves, adding
a cue that predicted an additional reward delivery to a partner rat unblocked associative social value
learning. We observe here that the unblocking of the novel cue last for approximately 6 trials. In
contrast, rats did not spent more time in the food cup for the blocked cue than the CS-, suggesting
that additional cues that did not predict additional reward remained blocked from acquiring associative
social reward value.

Control group
Discrimination learning. During discrimination learning, the experimental conditions were identical to
the Experimental group. We replicated the discrimination learning results from the experimental group
showing that rats again developed a conditioned response to the CS+, resulting in an increase in time
spent in the food trough on CS+ trials but not to the CS- as witnessed by a steady decrease in time
spent in the food trough on CS- trials (Fig. 3A). A paired sampled t-test revealed a significant difference
in time spent in food trough between the CS+ (M = 56.40, SD =12.89) and CS-(M =17.20, SD = 10,18);
t(7) =11.54, p < 0.001 (Fig. 3A). We also found a significant difference for the food cup rate between
the CS+ (M = 2.68, SD=1.39) and CS-(M = 0.66, SD = 0.38); t(7) = 5.02, p < 0.01 (Fig. 3D) looking at
the last 4 days of conditioning. Finally, control rats also developed a shorter latency to entry for the
CS+ and a larger latency to entry for the CS- over training (Supplemental Fig. 2D).
Social learning. In the compound phase, rats were again trained side by side on the compound cues
associated with the social outcomes Both Reward (BR), Own Reward (OR) and No Reward (NR; Fig.
1B). This time, however, we aimed to show the influence of blocking visual and auditory information
exchange on Pavlovian conditioned responses to the compound cues and to a direct comparison of
these responses to the target rats original CS+ and CS- (Fig. 1B). A 2-factor repeated measures
ANOVA with condition and day as factors and the time spent in food trough as dependent variable
was performed. Mauchly’s test of sphericity was significant for both the main effect of the factor
condition and days. Therefore, for these effects the Greenhouse-Geisser corrected values are
reported. As under the experimental conditions, we found a significant effect of condition type on time
spent in food trough (F(1.175, 8.228) = 46.407, p < 0.01). This effect was again explained by a greater
responding on BR and OR trials compared to NR trials (p = 0.01, Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a paired
samples t-test revealed that responding for BR trials did not differ on day 1 (M = 58.45, SD = 9.40) in
comparison to the average of the last 4 days of responding for the CS+ (M=56.40, SD= 12.89);
t(7)=0.398, p = 0.702) and when comparing OR (M = 50.38, SD= 15.84) with the CS+ (M=56.40, SD=
12.89); t(7)=-1.779, p = 0.118). We found no effect of days on time spent in the food trough (F(1.294, 9.059)
= 1.501, p = 0,262) but did find an interaction between day and condition (F(6, 42) = 2.873, p= 0.019).
Contrasts revealed that the difference between condition BR and NR (F(1,7) = 13.043, p = 0.009) and
the difference between conditions OR and NR (F(1,7) = 7.00, p = 0.033) was significantly higher for day
4 compared to day 2 but found no difference between day 1 and 4.

The increase in difference between the BR and NR and difference between OR and NR when
contrasting day 2 and day 4 was not driven by a decrease in responding to the NR from day 1 (M =
17.68, SD = 7.56) to day 4 (M = 22.63, SD = 10.59; t(7)= -1.041, p = 0.333) as was the case in the
experimental group results.
Paired samples t-test revealed furthermore that the time spent in the food cup for NR on day 1 (M =
17.68, SD = 7.56) was not significantly higher than responding on the last 4 days of CS- (M = 17.20,
SD = 10.17); t(7) = 0.137, p = 0.895) and NR day 4 (M = 25.97, SD = 7,68; ); t(7)= 1.523, p = 0.114) was
not significantly higher. Additionally, we again observed a clear shorter mean latency to entry in the
BR and OR trials compared to NR trials throughout the compound phase (Supplemental Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that adding a second cue that predicts either reward or no reward to the partner
when social information exchange is impeded does not influence time spent in the nose poke for a
self-reward. Both BR and OR trials, including the CS+ as part of the compound, still elicited a higher
time spent in the food cup than NR (CS- compound) trials. However when social information exchange
was blocked, we found that observing a partner not being rewarded did not result in an increase in the
time spent in the food cup for the NR on day 1. NR value is comparable to CS- value throughout
compound conditioning as indexed by the time spent in the food cup and thus no further modulation
through learning processes became apparent.
A 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA with condition and day as factors with the food cup rate as
dependent variable was performed. We again found a significant effect of condition type on food cup
rate (F(1.019, 7.134) = 21.781, p = 0.002). This effect was also explained by a greater responding on BR and
OR trials compared to NR trials (p < 0.01, Fig. 3E). Furthermore, a paired samples t-test revealed that
food cup rate was similar for BR (M = 3.1, SD= 1.41) in comparison to the average of the last 4 days
of responding for the CS+ (M = 2.68, SD= 1.39); t(7)= 1.302, p = 0.234) and when comparing OR (M =
2.80, SD = 1.11) with the CS+ (M = 2.68, SD= 1.39); t(7 = 0.452, p = 0.665). Next to this, we found no
effect of days on food cup rate (F (1.31, 9.168) = 1.024, p = 0,402) and no interaction between day and
condition (F (1.577, 11.042) = 1.618, p= 0.166 ). These results indicate that adding a second cue that
predicts either reward or no reward to the partner when social information exchange is impeded does
not influence food cup rate for a self-reward. Both BR and OR trials, including the CS+ as part of the
compound, still elicited a higher food cup rate then NR (CS- compound) trials. NR value as indexed by
food cup rate does not decrease throughout compound conditioning phase and thus no further
learning is apparent.

Probing associative value. In the control experiment probe trials, we aimed to show the effect of
impeding social information exchange on social reinforcement learning of compound cues with
different social outcomes. We again show the conditioned responding of the target rats to 14
presentations each of the CS+ and CS-, the unblocked cue associated with an added reward to the
partner (BR) and the blocked cue associated with a no reward to the partner (OR) and no reward to
self (NR). A two factor repeated measures with condition and bin as factors and the time spent in the
food cup as dependent variable was performed. We found a significant main effect of probe trial
condition type on time spent in food trough (F(3, 21) = 15.327, p < 0.01). We furthermore find a main
effect of bin number on time spent in food trough (F(1.540, 10.781) = 18.809, p < 0.01) Finally, we found no
interaction between condition type and bin number on the time spent in food trough (F(12,84) = 1.225, p
= 0.280). Pairwise comparisons revealed that time spent in food trough was higher in CS+ cues than
CS- cues across the 5 bins of extinction (p = 0.021, Fig. 3C). We furthermore found that the time spent
in the food trough was not different in response to unblocked cues compared to blocked cues across
the 5 bins of extinction (p = 1.000, Fig. 3C). Crucially, in this control experiment, time spent in the food
trough for both the blocked cue and the unblocked cue was not different from the CS- (p= 0.622;
p=1.00). We further performed a two factor repeated measures with condition and bin as factors and
the food cup rate as dependent variable. We found a significant main effect of probe trial condition
type on food cup rate (F(1.292, 9.042) = 10.979, p < 0.01). We furthermore find a main effect of bin number
on time spent in food trough (F(2.186, 15.304) = 10.335, p < 0.001). Finally, we found no interaction between
condition type and bin number on the time spent in food trough (F(4.476 ,31.335) = 1.229, p = 0.235).
Pairwise comparisons revealed that the food cup rate was marginally higher in CS+ cues compared to
CS- cues across the 5 bins of extinction (p = 0.057, Fig. 3C). We furthermore found that the food cup
rate was not different in unblocked cues in comparison to blocked cues across the 5 bins of extinction
(p = 1.000, Fig. 3C). A non-parametric Friedman two-way ANOVA test on the differences in the
latencies to entry over all trials (excluding all non-entered trials) between the conditions CS+ (median
= 3.64), unblocked (median = 5.70), blocked (median = 5.86) and CS- (median = 11.30) during
extinction was performed for the control experiment as well. We did not find a significant effect of
probe trial condition on the latency to entry (X2 (3, N = 26) = 7.24, p = 0.064). Also descriptively the latencies
to entry distributions for unblocked and blocked cue probe trials look similar while at the same time
the median latency to entry is still faster for CS+ compared to the CS- (Supplemental Fig. 2C).
These results show that, contrary to the findings for the experimental group, the rats in the control
experiment did not show more food cup directed behavior for the unblocked cue than both the CSand blocked cue over 10 trials of extinction. This means that when actor rats have fully learned a
stimulus-reward association producing reward for themselves, adding a cue that predicted an
additional reward delivery to a partner rat does not unblock associative social value learning when
social information exchange is blocked. These rats also did not spent more time in the food cup for
the blocked cue than the CS-. This shows that additional cues that did not predict additional reward
remained blocked from acquiring associative social reward value when information exchange is

blocked. Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that the exchange of social information is
necessary for the social unblocking effect observed in the experimental group.
Control for secondary reinforcement. Besides a contribution of social value, i.e. the vicarious
experience of reward, other confounding factors could drive learning/unblocking in our paradigm.
Most notably, sources of secondary reinforcement should be excluded as drivers of learning. During
discrimination learning, the actor rat is conditioned to receive pellets contingent on its CS+.
Afterwards, in the compound phase, the rat is presented with an auditory –visual compound. Instead
of one pellet drop (self-reward), now, on some trials, two pellets drop simultaneously (Both Reward
trials). It is possible that the additional pellet delivery sound acted as a third CS+ in the compound,
delivering occasional pellets to the partner rat. Because the sound of the pellet dispenser is associated
with the CS+ of the target rat, it is possible that the appetitive value associated with this cue enhanced
the value of the added novel cue leading to its unblocking. To control for this possible source of
secondary reinforcement, we added a non-rewarding pellet dispenser aimed outside the box during
the discrimination phase. Here, we compare results between these conditions. In the first experimental
group (N=8), rats were trained on the discrimination paradigm without added pellet dispensers and
therefore secondary reinforcement of the added pellet dispenser during compound phase is likely. A
two factor repeated measures with condition (unblocked and blocked) and trial (trial 1 to 6) as factors
and time spend in the food cup as dependent variable was performed on the experiment where only
one active pellet dispensers was used in the discrimination phase. For the subsequent probe phase,
we found a significant main effect of probe trial condition type on time spent in food trough (F(1, 7) =
26.026, p < 0.01). We furthermore found no main effect of trial number on time spent in food trough
(F(5, 35) = 0.900, p = 0.492). We did not find an interaction between condition type and bin number on
the time spent in food trough (F(5, 35) = 1.877, p = 0.124). Pairwise comparisons revealed that time spent
in food trough was higher for unblocked cues than blocked cues across the 6 trials of extinction (p =
0.001; Supplemental Fig. 2A).
In the second experimental group (N = 12), rats were trained on the discrimination paradigm with
added pellet dispensers to reduce the potential influence of sources of secondary reinforcement during
compound phase. A two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with condition (unblocked and blocked)
and trial (trial 1 to 6) as factors and time spent in the food cup as dependent variable was performed
on the experiment where 2 active dispensers were used in the discrimination phase. For the
subsequent probe phase, we found a significant main effect of probe trial condition type on time spent
in the food trough (F(1, 11) = 5.185, p = 0.044). We furthermore found a main effect of trial number on
time spent in food trough (F(5, 55) = 4.977, p = 0.001). We did not find an interaction between condition
type and bin number on the time spent in food trough (F(5, 55) = 0.803, p = 0.552). Pairwise comparisons
revealed that time spent in the food trough was higher for unblocked cues than blocked cues across
the 6 trials of extinction (p = 0.044; Supplemental Fig. 2B). In the control group (N = 8), rats were trained
on the discrimination paradigm without added pellet dispensers and therefore secondary
reinforcement of the added pellet dispenser during compound phase is also likely. A two factor

repeated measures with condition (unblocked and blocked) and trial (trial 1 to 6) as factors and time
spend in the food cup as dependent variable was performed on the control experiment where only one
active pellet dispensers was used in the discrimination phase. For the subsequent probe phase, we
did not find a significant main effect of probe trial condition type on time spent in food trough (F(1, 7) =
0.002, p = 0.969). We furthermore found no main effect of trial number on time spent in food trough
(F(5, 35) = 2.390, p = 0.058). We also did not find a interaction between condition type and bin number
on the time spent in food trough (F(5, 35) = 43.279, p = 0.976). Pairwise comparisons revealed that time
spent in food trough was not higher for unblocked cues than blocked cues across the 6 trials of
extinction (p = 0.969; Supplemental Fig. 2C). We can conclude that secondary reinforcement of pellet
sounds in the compound phase influenced the strength of the observed unblocking effect, as the effect
size of unblocking vs. blocked cues is higher for the condition without added pellet dispensers than
for the condition pellet when dispensers were added during the discrimination learning. However,
when controlling for this source of potential secondary reinforcement, the social unblocking effect
persisted.
Comparison between Experimental and Control conditions. To examine the influence of
obstructing the exchange of social information during the compound phase, we applied a similar
analysis on the difference scores for the comparison between the experimental group and the control
group based on responding during the probe phase. In the probe phase, we calculated both the
CS+/CS- contrast and the Unblocked/Blocked contrast. We examined the difference scores of the
Unblocked/Blocked contrast with a two way repeated measures ANOVA with group (Experimental,
control) and trial (1-6) as factors. We found no significant within subject main effect of trials F(5, 130) =
0.715, p = 0.613) and no interaction effect (F(5,130) = 0.554, p= 0,735. However a significant main
(between subject) effect of group on the contrast score for unblocked – blocked (F(1, 26) = 6.823, p =
0.013) revealed that the percentage difference in responding between unblocked and blocked cues
was higher for the experimental group then control group (Fig. 4E). We similarly examined the
difference scores for the unblocked/CS- contrast with a two way repeated measures ANOVA. We
found no significant (within subject) main effect of trial on group (F(5,130) = 0.589, p = 0.708) and no
interaction effect (F(5,130) = 1.750, p= 0.128). But here as well, we found a significant main between
subject effect of group when comparing the unblocked / CS- contrast score (F(1, 26) = 8.614, p =0.007,
Fig. 3F).

As expected, when comparing responding for the blocked / CS- contrast, we again found no significant
(within subject) main effect of trial on group (F(5,130) = 1.425, p = 0.219) and no interaction effect (F(5,130)
= 0.597, p= 0.702). Now, in addition, there was no significant main between subject effect of group
(F(1, 26) = 0.221, p =0.643, Fig. 3G).We similarly examined the difference scores for the CS+/CS- contrast
with a two way repeated measures ANOVA with variables of group (Experimental, control) and trial (16). We found no significant (within subject) main effect of trial (F(5,130) = 1.133, p = 0.346) and no
interaction effect (F(5, 130) = 0.604, p= 0.697). We did however find an unexpected significant main
(between subject) effect of group when comparing the CS+/CS- difference score (F(1, 26) = 7.862, p
=0.009, Fig. 4D). These results further strengthen the conclusion that blocking the exchange of social
information during the compound phase selectively affects learning about unblocked vs. blocked cues.
Though we found a magnitude difference in the CS+/CS- contrast between experimental and control
groups, we note that the CS+/CS- contrast was significant by itself in both groups as well, while this
was not the case for the Unblocked/Blocked contrast.

Discussion
Summary Social valuation is crucial in forming and maintaining social relationships and, presumably,
in experiencing the pleasurable and reinforcing aspects of social interaction. However, it remained
unclear whether social value, which we define here as value attached to social signals associated with
reward to another conspecific [cf. 29], could drive learning just as self-experienced value. If this would
be the case, then vicariously experienced reward, e.g. social value should be able to reinforce
behaviour in a formal Pavlovian learning paradigm. Here we addressed this question by introducing a
novel social unblocking task. We find that social value, operationalized in this task as rewards delivered
to social partners, can indeed drive learning about novel stimuli. After having fully learned that a
specific cue predicted a self-reward, learning about a second cue delivered in compound was blocked,
as predicted by learning theory [30,31], when no additional self or other reward was contingent on this
cue. Learning was unblocked, however, by providing social reward, e.g. an additional reward delivered
to the partner simultaneously with the fully predicted self-reward. Finally, preventing the exchange of
social information in the compound learning phase impeded unblocking of the novel stimuli. These
results suggest that social value can indeed drive learning processes, in line with formal behavioural
learning theory.
Learning Theory Our results extend previous work by Peter Holland [22] and Geoffrey Schoenbaum
[23,32] on unblocking in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. These authors found that rats, after learning
that distinct cues have specific food outcomes, can show unblocking of learning for cues added in
compound, when self-rewards were altered by increasing reward value (e.g. an upward shift from 1 to
3 pellets) or a change in reward identity (same reward type but a shift in reward features such as
flavour). In contrast, learning was blocked when no such reward change occurred (e.g. same reward
amount or same identity). According to reinforcement learning theory, the upshift or change in identity
led to a discrepancy between the expected reward (1 pellet) and the received reward (3 pellets), thus

producing a reward prediction error. The theory states that if the added cue reliably predicts the
increase in reward/ identity outcome, it will acquire the value inherent in the reward itself [33]. The main
indicator of learning about the value of a (novel) cue in our social unblocking paradigm is an increase
in the time spent in the food cup in the probe (extinction) phase [cf. 23,32]. Indeed, we observed an
increase in the time spent in the food cup for the unblocked cue, predicting mutual rewards to the
actor rat and its conspecific, relative to the blocked cue, predicting own-rewards only, when presenting
the cue in isolation without reward delivery.
From this result, we conclude that the added novel cue has acquired the positive social value inherent
in the “Both Reward” delivery through reinforcement learning mechanisms. Analogous to the
description above, our result mimics food cup responding that represent the appetitive US-directed
‘wanting’ response [18]. This indicates that the incentive salience of the unblocked cue can, in addition
to being changed by appetitive reward, also be changed by social value. Further research is necessary
to see whether socially reinforced cues can also act as a conditioned reinforcer for instrumental
responses of rats, as has been found humans [34], in a similar way as has been found for appetitive
cues [28,35,36]. Finally, it is important to investigate if social cues can guide rats’ social choices. It has
been found that rats choose a reward arm in a T-maze that leads to play behavior more than an arm
leading to a social encounter where play was absent [37]. Furthermore, social play can induce a social
place preference (CPP) [38] and rats are willing to lever press for social play reinforcement [15]. Our
task indicates that the unblocked cue has attained the rewarding properties of social reward and it is
therefore likely that a presented unblocked cue would be preferred over a blocked cue when tested in
a choice task.
Our findings that unblocking can occur through social value as well as Pavlovian appetitive value adds
to the emerging literature showing that animals attach value to rewards delivered to conspecifics [7,20]
and learn about cues that predict rewards delivered to others. Monkeys, for example, prefer cues that
are associated with reward delivery to another monkey over cues that were associated with juice
delivery to a chair with no monkey in it and this preference was absent, in the non-social condition,
when there was only a juice bottle present [12]. By contrast, not all unequal reward structures lead to
positive social value presumably motivating pro-social behavior. A recent study shows that macaques
increase licking frequency in line with a higher probability of self-reward but decrease their anticipatory
licking with increased probability of reward delivery to another monkey [39]. The authors interpret this
decrease of anticipatory licking as an indicator of the negative affect associated with unequal
disadvantageous reward pay-outs. Both monkeys and rats have been found to have a distaste for
these unequal pay-outs [40,41]. It is thus clear that monkeys can learn to associate cues with both
negative and positive outcomes delivered to others. Our results provide evidence that, next to
monkeys, rats as well can learn about cues that are associated with reward delivered to others. The
social reinforcement learning hypothesis [7] proposes that integration of the social signal expressed
by partners cues can aid in making appropriate decision in a social context. Evidence for this
hypothesis comes from the prosocial choice task (PCT) in which it was found that, rewards delivered

to oneself and to a partner are preferred over a reward delivery only to the actor himself in both
monkeys [4] and rats [5,42]. In rats, it was found that this effect was modulated by the behavior
displayed by the other rat and that this effect was impaired when the partner was replaced by a toy or
when the display of the partner’s preference was impeded. We found that that unblocking occurs when
additional reward was delivered to the partner and that preventing the exchange of social information
by an opaque wall impeded unblocking. These results also fit the cascade model of representation of
cognitive (social) structures that predicts partial contributions that sum up over multiple modalities of
social signals (Kalenscher et al, in press). We thus expect that associative learning of the actor rats in
our task is driven by a similar social reinforcement learning process, dependent on the transmission
of social signals between the actor and partner rat [43]. These signals could manifest in the following
aspects; confounding factors, auditory transfer, visual observation and olfactory/tactile social
interaction. In the following paragraph, these potential modes of social information transfer will be
discussed.
Social Information Transfer
Potential confounding factors It is possible that the additional pellet delivery sound acted as a third
CS+ in the compound and influenced the social unblocking effect we observe. We controlled for this
by exposing a group of target actors already to the sound of a second pellet delivery apparatus
delivering pellets during discrimination learning. Importantly, this dispenser released its pellets outside
of the behavioural box on the (empty) partner’ side. We found that, relative to a group rats trained
without a second pellet dispenser in the discrimination phase, rats that were conditioned in the
presence of an added pellet dispenser during discrimination show slightly lower, but still significant
levels of unblocking (Supplemental Fig. 2). These results provide evidence that the sound of an active
pellet dispenser indeed could entail secondary reinforcement value and can act a CS+ moderator on
the observed unblocking effect and should be controlled for.
1. Auditory transfer of affective state/value. Our data show that the possibility for social information
exchange was necessary to produce the social unblocking effect. One possibility is that social
information was transferred through auditory transfer of affective state/value between rats. It has been
found that rats observing conspecifics being rewarded produce 50 kHz vocalisations and show an
increase in dopamine release [20] and Playback of 50 kHz vocalisation furthermore motivates rats to
approach the location of playback and increase their USV production [10].

Importantly, during

playback of 50 kHz calls, dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens is transiently increased [17].
Prosocial choices in rats, as found by Hernandez-Lallement in the PCT [5], are therefore likely to be
driven by communicative social reinforcement signals [7], such as 50 kHz vocalisations expressed by
the partner rat. Recently, it has been found that supressing VTA dopamine transients by means of
optogenetics during the compound phase of a non-social blocking task impairs unblocking of novel
cue value and features [44]. Furthermore, increasing VTA dopamine activity can drive learning about
novel cue-reward associations in an unblocking paradigm [45]. Taken together, these findings suggest

that unblocking in our task could occur through social reinforcement by way of 50 kHz calls-associated
dopamine release. Some evidence that 50 kHz can enhance the value of novel cues comes from a
study by Saito et al. [46] that found that the playback of 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations, 20 min. prior
to hearing a neutral tone, increased lever presses of rats during subsequent presentation of the neutral
tone more so than in a control condition where there was no playback. The amount of lever presses
became more similar to the number of lever presses observed in response to a previously conditioned
rewarding stimulus (positive bias), indicating that the playback of 50 kHz USVs induced a positive
affective state that transferred onto the neutral stimuli and thereby enhancing its value. In our task,
positive reinforcement of the partner can be perceived as both surprising and rewarding to the actor
rat and this could therefore increase the partner’s and/or target’s 50 kHz vocalisations. Future work
will indicate whether the production of 50 kHz USVs (unpublished observations) during the BR trials in
the compound phase can indeed contribute to dopamine release in the actor rat and thus drive learning
i.e. unblocking of the additional compound cue that is associated with partner reward.
2. Visual observational learning. Another possibility is that social information was transferred through
visual observational learning. Previous experiments in rats have shown that, during learning, animals
can develop both goal tracking towards the location of the US and sign tracking behavior showing
orienting and enhanced responding to the location of the CS [47]. This enhanced responding is
indicative of an enhanced incentive salience of the cue. We observed that some animals in our task
indeed showed coordinated cue-directed behavior during the compound phase. This conforms to the
definition of stimulus enhancement in social learning: when observation of an action leads the observer
to increase the proportion of its behavior directed towards the location or object of the demonstrator’s
[48]). Such coordinated putative sign-tracking could therefore facilitate learning in the target rats about
the cues inducing cue-directed behavior in the partner rat and presumably increase sign tracking
behavior for the actor rat towards the unblocked cue. As an example of such stimulus enhancement,
Heyes et al. [49] showed that rats observing other rats performing a lever pressing discrimination task
have a higher lever-pressing rate for a previously observed CS+ lever. In our task, responding at the
food cup by actor rats might be enhanced through observational conditioning, i.e. by observing the
conditioned approach of the partner on BR trials in contrast to OR/NR trials. Our experimental setup
was not designed to gauge the influence of observational learning on unblocking because both animals
approach the reward site simultaneously during BR conditions. Furthermore, the observed latency to
entry was not different between conditions in the compound phase and probe phase. This implies
though that a pure matching response is unlikely, but leaves room for a role for coordinated sign
tracking during the both reward cue and subsequent observation of the partner’s approach (on BR
trials) or lack thereof (on OR/NR trials). Trial by trial computational modelling of the influence of the
partner rat’s sign tracking behavior and approach behavior on the actor rat’s actions could lead to
further insights regarding the putative role of stimulus enhancement and observational learning in this
task.

3. Olfactory and tactile information exchange. Finally, social information exchange could have
occurred through olfactory and tactile information exchange. It has been found that in rats, food
preferences can be transferred from demonstrators to observers and that for this effect to occur, the
scent of the food together with the presence of carbon disulphide (CS2) on the breath of the
demonstrator are necessary [50]. Preliminary observations of the interaction between our rats in this
task showed that facial touch occurs throughout all conditions in the interaction window (Fig. 1B). The
presence of pellet consumption related olfactory cues and associated CS2 on the partner’s breath
could thus have aided the target rats in identifying BR trials, while an absence or decrease in these
indicator smells might indicate OR/NR trials. In addition, it has been found that facial touch is
associated with an increase in the production of 50 kHz calls [51]. Within a BR condition, where sniffing
of dyadic olfactory cues might be enhanced, social face touch could potentially further enhance the
production of 50 kHz calls and thus contribute to unblocking.
Neural substrates
Overall, these data provide evidence that social value can drive reinforcement learning in rats, and that
the transmission of social cues is necessary for this learning. Further replication experiments should
be conducted to reveal which mode(s) of social information processing are necessary and sufficient
to drive unblocking through social value. Previous work on the neural mechanisms of unblocking has
indicated that the Basolateral amygdala [52], Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
[23] and VTA [44] are involved in unblocking. The amygdala has been found to signal and update the
exact value of the outcome while the OFC is involved in coding the different identities of the cues that
predict reward [53] with a specific role for the lateral OFC in coding upshifts in rewards [32]. Next to
that it was found that OFC is activated by unexpected outcome signalling an increase in reward value
and that the VTA was necessary for this learning to occur [54]. VTA dopamine activity furthermore has
also been found to drive learning about novel cue-reward associations in unblocking [44,55]. We
propose that social reinforcement learning of novel cues takes place within the same circuitry while
using similar reinforcement learning mechanism as in appetitive learning. Humans for example, learn
to respond faster to stimuli that become associated with positive social reinforcement [11] and this
learning was directly correlated to activity in the ventral striatum and OFC. In monkeys it was
furthermore found that OFC neurons show enhanced activity for joint rewards if the partner is preferred
[56] and that the BLA codes the values of rewards delivered to self and [57]. In rats it has been shown
that oxytocin release in the VTA enhances the rewarding aspects of social interaction [58] and that
optogenetic enhancement of VTA activity increased social behavior and this effect was dependent on
projections to the NAcc [59]. Finally, in a recent study it was found that there is a specific population
of OFC neurons that was activated when interacting with a social stimulus [60]. It is thus likely that a
social prediction error originating from the VTA, resulting in DA efflux could selectively enhance the
value of novel cues leading to novel social cue-outcome associations located in the OFC and BLA.
Our novel behavioural paradigm could be used to further explore how rats learn about social value and
is well suited to probe the neural circuits involved in social reinforcement learning.
