Abstract

31

Single-molecule tracking allows the study of transcription factor dynamics in the

32

nucleus, giving important information regarding the search and binding behavior of

33

these proteins with chromatin in vivo. However, these experiments suffer from

34

limitations due to photobleaching of the tracked protein and assumptions about the

35

exponential behavior required for data interpretation, potentially leading to serious

36

artifacts. Here, we developed an improved method to account for photobleaching

37

effects, theory-based models to accurately describe transcription factor dynamics, and

38

an unbiased model selection approach to determine the best predicting model. A new

39

biological interpretation of transcriptional regulation emerges from the proposed models

40

wherein transcription factor searching and binding on the DNA results in a broad

41

distribution of binding affinities and accounts for the power-law behavior of transcription

42

factor residence times.

43

Introduction

44

Transcription factors (TFs) are key regulatory proteins responsible for turning

45

genes “on” and “off” by binding to enhancer or promoter elements across the genome 1.

46

Fluorescence microscopy techniques have revolutionized our understanding of how TFs

47

search and interact with chromatin2. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching

48

(FRAP) in live-cell systems unveiled the dynamic nature of these proteins, in contrast to

49

the long-standing static model of TF-chromatin interactions3. The combined innovative

50

technological improvements in fluorophore brightness and stability4, optical set-ups to

51

increase the signal-to-noise ratio5, and camera speed and sensitivity now allow the

52

study of single-molecules at an unprecedent temporal and spatial resolution. Single-

53

molecule tracking (SMT) is a powerful technique that allows the characterization of

54

protein dynamics in single, live cells. It is based on detecting and following through time

55

the traces produced by the light emitted from a single fluorophore. When applied to the

56

study of TFs, important information regarding the search and binding dynamics of these

57

proteins can be extracted2.

58

The SMT approach (Fig. 1) has now been applied for approximately two-dozen

59

TFs in a variety of cellular systems6. The current consensus, based on empirical

60

residence time distributions, describes TFs as able to transition between three different

61

states: 1) unbound from DNA (diffusing in the nucleus), 2) non-specifically bound and 3)

62

specifically bound to chromatin (i.e. interacting with specific response elements)7. This

63

three-population model is based on the observation that TFs can intermittently stop, and

64

then resume rapid diffusion8, 9. Thus, the empirical residence time distribution of the

65

“stopped molecules” have been phenomenologically fitted to families of exponential

66

distributions10-19, with no underlying normative model for the origins of these

67

distributions8. Nevertheless, the bi-exponential fits to the distribution suggest that the

68

DNA-bound population of molecules includes two distinct subpopulations: a short-lived

69

fraction (‘fast stops’) and a longer-lived fraction (‘slow stops’). The slow fraction has

70

been hypothesized to represent specific binding events associated with enhancers or

71

promoters, while the fast fraction is hypothesized to represent non-specific binding to

72

chromatin11, 12, 15, 17. Experiments wherein the DNA-binding domain of TFs has been

73

mutated are consistent with this hypothesis as the longer events were reported to be

74

dramatically reduced10, 12, 17, 18.

75

Despite the technological advances in studying TF dynamics, a major remaining

76

limitation of the SMT approach is the relatively short fluorescence stability (or tendency

77

to photobleach) of any fluorophore dye. This makes it difficult to distinguish whether a

78

loss of signal is due to an unbinding event, drifting or photobleaching. Hence, careful

79

corrections must be performed to accurately estimate TF dynamics. Unfortunately,

80

photobleaching correction methods vary widely among research groups17, 20, 21 which

81

highlights the lack of a standard approach to overcome the photobleaching bias of SMT

82

strategies9, 12, 18, 22.

83

In this work, we propose a new and improved photobleaching correction method

84

that uses fluorescence dynamics of histones measured at the focal plane under precise

85

SMT acquisition conditions. We then use the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand

86

regulated transcription factor23, as a model TF to validate and test the new

87

methodology. This approach unexpectedly reveals a novel, power-law behavior of GR

88

residence time distributions. We then derive theory-based models for TF dynamics and

89

a principled method to obtain optimal model parameters from empirical residence time

90

distributions, using Bayesian statistics. We show that a model of TF searching and

91

binding or a model of a nucleus with broad distribution of binding affinities accounts for

92

the power law behavior of GR residence times obtained after implementing the modified

93

photobleaching correction method. These models exhibit a broad effective distribution of

94

binding affinities, thus challenging the established model with two discrete, bound

95

populations.

Figure 1. The current SMT pipeline and interpretation of TF dynamics. (a) A HiLO set-up is most
commonly implemented to increase signal-to-noise ratio (shown in panel). A laser beam is tilted and hits
the sample creating a thin illumination layer in the focal plane. Any light sheet microscope may be used.
(b) Several images are taken at specific yet variable acquisition and interval time conditions. (c) A
tracking algorithm is used to follow each individual molecule and classify them as either bound or
unbound. (d) From the bound population, a histogram is usually plotted which shows the frequency of TF
molecules that are bound for a specific time (dwell time). (e) Fitting of the data is performed on the
survival plot, which corresponds to 1-CDF, where CDF is the cumulative distribution function. This plot
represents the probability P that a molecule will last t number of time points, or longer. This distribution
has been phenomenologically fitted to either a single or a bi-exponential distribution. The better fit to a biexponential function gave rise to the notion that two-distinct bound populations (fast and slow) exist. (f)
The current model states that TFs can be found in three different states: unbound from the DNA (diffusing
in the nucleus), specifically bound (slow stops), and non-specifically bound (fast stops). The latter can be
composed of TFs sliding and hopping on the DNA to facilitate searching of specific sites. Due to the
resolution limit, any transition between specific and non-specific bound states cannot be distinguished.

obtain a local dwell time for TFs which is defined as the time interval between a single

130

molecule transitioning from a diffusive state to a bound state and its subsequent

131

unbinding from DNA. The definition of dwell time presented here differs of the one used

132

in the field (residence time) in that we are considering any process occurring in a point

133

spread function as a single observable binding event in the calculation of the dwell time

134

distribution, not just discrete binding states. The dwell time distribution is generated by

135

integrating the ensemble-averaged distribution of bound times (Fig. 1d,

136

Supplementary Note 1.1). Most often, a “survival” distribution, defined as 1-CDF,

137

where CDF is the empirical cumulative distribution function of dwell times, is used for

138

further analysis (Fig. 1e). This survival distribution is usually fit to a bi-exponential

139

distribution, interpreted as the “three population model” (i.e. diffusive, fast bound, slow

140

bound) illustrated in Fig. 1f.

141

The upper temporal limit in SMT experiments is ultimately determined by the

142

intrinsic photostability of the chosen fluorophore. When the affinity of bound TFs leads

143

to dwell times longer than the averaged photostability of their fluorescent dyes,

144

residence times cannot be resolved. Importantly, even when bound molecules have

145

relatively lower affinities, they will appear to have shorter experimental dwell times due

146

to photobleaching (PB) bias. To demonstrate this, we conducted single-molecule

147

imaging of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor23,

148

tagged with HaloTag-Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549)7. If we artificially modulate the PB

149

conditions by changing acquisition parameters (exposure time, interval time, laser

150

power), the resulting kymographs (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Videos 1-4)

151

appear to have originated from different TFs. Therefore, PB must be properly corrected

152

to prevent artifacts in the analysis of SMT data.

153

Currently, there is no consensus on the proper method to estimate PB rates. One

154

common approach is to simply count, frame-by-frame, the number of particles in the

155

focal plane and then fit the time-dependent number to a bi-exponential model8, 10, 11, 16,

156

17.

157

undergo at the focal plane. The dwell time of diffusive (unbound) molecules is much

158

shorter than that of bound molecules (Fig. 2a) in the focal plane. Therefore, stably-

159

bound molecules will photobleach faster than diffusive particles. Moreover, the number

160

of particles in the focal plane will be heavily dominated by the diffusive component,

161

which will also distort PB rates derived from the fits.

However, this method underestimates the real PB that stably-bound proteins

162

Another strategy uses histones as a proxy for obtaining PB rates. Histones are a

163

good representation of stably-bound proteins because, after integration into chromatin,

164

they have a residence time much longer than the photostability of any currently

165

available organic fluorophore24. Therefore, by measuring the residence time of histones,

166

we can obtain a direct representation of PB for particles in the focal plane, as the

167

disappearance of a long-lived particle will most likely represent a PB event. This method

168

is widely used in the SMT field12, 19, 21 13, 14, 25 but, as we will demonstrate below, it has

169

not been properly implemented. In current models, photobleaching kinetics are

170

characterized by an exponential parameter 𝑘ℎ𝑖𝑠 and the slow component of a TF is

171

characterized by another exponential parameter 𝑘𝑇𝐹 (see Supplementary Note 2 for

172

details). This rate 𝑘𝑇𝐹 is corrected for PB to give the “real residence time” (𝑘𝑇𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 ) of the

173

transcription factor by: 𝑘 𝑇𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 = 𝑘𝑇𝐹 − 𝑘ℎ𝑖𝑠 . However, the correction assumes that TF

the parameter 𝑘𝑇𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 may emerge as an artifact of this assumption.

212

Improving photobleaching correction

213

We propose a new PB correction method also based on histone data as a proxy

214

of the fluorophore stability. A detailed derivation is described in Supplementary Note 2.

215

The main step involves SMT of histones under the same conditions that the TF of

216

interest will be imaged. We tracked individual H2B, H3 or H4 molecules using highly

217

inclined and laminated optical sheet (HiLO) illumination5 by sub-optimal transient

218

transfection of HaloTag-fused histones, labeled with JF549 HaloTag ligand26 (see online

219

Methods). The three histone variants we tested presented statistically similar dynamics

220

(Supplementary Fig. 2a). We continued with H2B for all further experiments.

221

Histone genes are primarily transcribed upon entry into S-phase of the cell

222

cycle27. Due to our transient transfection approach, HaloTag-H2B proteins will be

223

translated during interphase and therefore some histones will not be incorporated into

224

chromatin at the time of acquisition (Supplementary Video 5). Hence, survival

225

distribution of H2B will be composed of PB kinetics and a diffusive/transient binding

226

component. To account for this behavior and assuming PB kinetics at the single-

227

molecule level is exponentially distributed, the survival distribution of H2B is fit to an

228

exponential family with three components (Fig. 2b, Supplemental Note 2). The faster

229

components characterize the dynamics of histones that have not been stably

230

incorporated into chromatin, while the third (slower) component describes the PB

231

kinetics of the fluorophore. To confirm that our method quantifies PB kinetics and not

232

intrinsic dynamics of the histone H2B, we calculated PB lifetimes using histones H3 and

233

H4 with the same statistical results (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Consequently, artificially

234

modifying PB kinetics (by changing acquisition conditions) modulates the H2B survival

235

distribution (Supplementary Fig. 2c) and, accordingly, the mean PB lifetimes

236

(Supplementary Fig. 2d, Supplementary Videos 5-8). This method for estimating PB

237

rates has some drawbacks when a non-uniform illumination in the focal plane is used

238

(as in HiLO microscopy), since the calculated rate corresponds to the average

239

fluorophore decay in the focal plane, which may differ slightly in each location 7.

240

To test this new PB correction method, we first analyzed how histone data itself

241

changes after correction. Comparisons between H2B survival distribution with either our

242

previous correction methods (Supplementary Fig. 2e) or with no correction at all,

243

reveals a predictable upward shift of the distribution (Fig. 2c, compare yellow and black

244

datapoints). However, H2B data still artifactually resembles the dynamics of a TF with a

245

relatively short residence time. Conversely, if the newly proposed PB correction is used

246

(Fig. 2c, green datapoints), a plateau in survival probability appears, indicating that H2B

247

dwell times are now longer than those resulting from the photostability of the

248

fluorophore. The high fluctuations at the tail of the distribution are likely due to noise in

249

the data and the appearance of multiple particles within the point spread function

250

(Supplementary Fig. 2f). For reproducibility and reliability purposes, multiple biological

251

replicates are always taken, hence the ensemble average is used as the survival

252

distribution for analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2g, all data). Even though the decay in

253

number of particles at the focal plane (previous method) could potentially be used to

254

correct for differences in laser illumination between replicates, we found that it makes

255

the data more heterogenous (c.f. Supplementary Fig. 2h and 2i), suggesting this is not

256

a suitable measure for PB estimates.

257

Next, we apply our new PB correction to GR as a model TF. As with histones, we

258

transiently transfected 3617 cells with GR fused to HaloTag (HaloTag-GR), incubated

259

the cells with JF549, and activated the receptor with its natural ligand, corticosterone

260

(Cort, 600 nM). We artificially varied the PB kinetics of the experiment by changing the

261

exposure time and laser power (see Methods). When the previous PB correction was

262

applied, GR survival curves show clear dependence on acquisition conditions (Fig. 2d),

263

illustrating the artifact produced by PB. Conversely, with the new PB correction, we can

264

now retrieve the same underlying distribution (Fig. 2e), independently of the acquisition

265

conditions.

266

New photobleaching correction reveals power-law behavior of TF dynamics

267

Surprisingly, after correcting for PB with the new method, GR’s SMT data now

268

deviates clearly from a bi-exponential distribution (Fig. 3a). However, the data looks

269

strikingly linear in a log-log plot (Fig. 3b), which suggests a power-law behavior. A

270

similar distribution is observed upon GR activation with dexamethasone (Dex, 100 nM),

271

a more potent, synthetic hormone (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To rule out any artifacts

272

from acquisition conditions, SMT experiments for GR-Cort complexes were acquired at

273

different time intervals and exposure times (Supplementary Fig. 3b-d). Independent of

274

the sampling times, GR’s survival distribution appears power-law distributed, with a

plateau in the tail due to a few molecules staying immobilized longer than the

276

characteristic photobleaching time of the fluorophore (illustrated in Supplementary Fig.

tail of the power law distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3d, independent replicates are

A random variable t follows a power law28 for 𝑡 > 𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 if 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑡 −𝛽 , where A is

a constant and 𝛽 ∈ ℝ+ corresponds to the critical exponent, also known as the scaling

308

parameter. Power laws are heavy tailed (right-skewed) and 𝛽 is a measure of this

309

skewness. Quantification of the critical exponent of the power-law shows that GR under

310

different acquisition conditions (i.e. under different PB rates) exhibits the same

311

dynamics (Fig. 3c). Surprisingly, GR activated with Cort shows an upward-shifted

312

(lower 𝛽) distribution compared to the more potent hormone dexamethasone (Fig. 3d),

313

suggesting longer residence times for the less potent ligand. These differences were not

314

apparent in previous studies10, 17 likely due to inaccurate PB correction and/or a partial

315

exploration of the dynamic range of the protein of interest in the SMT experiments.

316

Previous research has assumed that the dynamics of non-specific binding is well

317

described by a single exponential component with a much shorter dwell time than

318

specific binding8, 12, 17. To understand the dynamics of non-specific binding, we

319

inactivated GR by washing out the hormone29 for 20 minutes, which greatly reduces

exhibits power law behavior, although with shorter dwell times as indicated by an

322

increase in the power law exponent (Fig. 3e). While longer washouts (four hours) shows

323

further reduction in dwell times, GR still exhibits power-law dynamics (Fig. 3f,

non-specific binding as two distinct populations with discrete (and measurable)

Re-interpretation of SMT data: new models for TFs kinetics
To better understand the link between TF binding and the observed residence

332

time distributions, we explored different theoretical models that may explain the

333

emergence of different behaviors in the survival distribution. Calculation of dwell time

334

distributions is a first-passage time problem in stochastic analysis and has been widely

335

used to characterize the kinetic properties of molecular motors and ion channels31.

336

When simple kinetic schemes are involved, dwell time distributions can be calculated

337

analytically. However, for more complex systems, other methods must be used. One

338

particularly powerful approach is to assign one or more states to “act” as an absorbing

339

boundary, and then solve the associated first-order kinetic equations to obtain dwell

340

time distributions32 (Supplementary Note 1.1). We assume that the diffusive state

341

(unbound) corresponds to an absorbing boundary state since tracked particles end with

342

such transitions. The single-molecule either photobleaches, disappears from the focal

343

plane or begins diffusing. Any rebinding of the TF is considered an independent event.

344

We first examined the widely used bi-exponential model under this framework

345

(Fig. 4a). According to this model, TFs can occupy three different states: diffusive, slow

346

and fast. The diffusive state plays the role of an absorbing boundary state (i.e. exit from

347

a bound state). In the current literature, it has been interpreted that the slow and fast

348

states correspond to specific and nonspecific binding, respectively33.

Numerical simulation of (e) showing the emergence of power-law behavior (red line). See
Supplementary Note 1 for details.

380

With this assumption of a well separated and narrow distribution of affinities, the

381

expected behavior of the survival distribution corresponds to a double exponential with

382

exponential parameters determining the average residence time of each state, as

383

confirmed with stochastic simulations (Fig. 4b) using the Gillespie algorithm34.

384

Importantly, this model does not allow for transitions between fast and slow states. For

385

a complete derivation, see Supplementary Note 1.2.

386

We next extended the bi-exponential model to allow for transitions between the

387

slow and fast components (Fig. 4c). Due to the resolution limit (~30nm), any transitions

388

between specific and non-specific bound states cannot be distinguished. The resulting

389

survival distribution corresponds to a family of exponentials; we call this a kinetic model

390

(Supplementary Note 1.3). Simulations were performed as before, and the expected

391

distribution is displayed in Fig. 4d.

392

Finally, several theoretical studies have posited that TF search and “final” binding

393

to its cognate site on the DNA involves a combination of bulk diffusion in the nucleus,

394

1D sliding along the DNA, hopping and translocation, and theoretical search times for

395

the TF to find specific sites in this framework have been estimated35-37. In this model,

396

TFs will have a multiplicity of fast bound states that must be accounted for in the

397

analysis of dwell time data. To do so, we modeled TF movement on the DNA as

398

hopping on a circular chain composed of specific sites and non-specific sites (Fig. 4e).

399

The main assumption in our “continuum of affinities” model derivation (Supplementary

400

Note 1.4) is that the number of non-specific sites on the DNA is much larger than the

401

number of specific sites. This is a biologically reasonable assumption as only a few to

402

tens of thousands of specific sites are bound by any TF according to genome wide

403

studies38, while the entire genome contains millions of “other” potential chromatin sites.

404

An analytical solution can be found for the simplest case where there is a single specific

405

binding site and the TF unbinds from the specific site (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Note

406

1.4.3). A simulation based on the model gives rise to asymptotic power law behavior at

407

time scales compatible with specific binding (Fig. 4g).

408

To test which model better represents the observed behavior of GR dynamics,

409

we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)39 and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test

410

to choose the best-predicted model (see Methods). Clearly, power-law behavior

411

emerges as the best fit, as illustrated for both GR-Cort (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c) and

412

GR-Dex (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f) data. Interestingly, power law distributions have

413

infinite variance, which implies a finite probability of long-lived binding events. This

414

could imply that productive binding events may be rare with dwell times much longer

415

than previously appreciated, as indicated by the right-skewness of the distribution.

416

Another possibility corresponds to a wide distribution of binding affinities in the nucleus

417

due to heterogeneity in 1) binding affinities of individual response elements, and/or 2)

418

local nuclear microenvironment.

419

In summary, by incorporating an improved PB correction method, we discovered

420

that the survival distribution of GR dwell times does not follow a bi-exponential model. In

421

fact, the data follows a power-law distribution, which we can derive using two theoretical

422

models (Supplementary Note 1.4-1.5). Ultimately, if there is a way to define or

423

distinguish non-specific from specific binding, our results indicate that it cannot be

424

based on their global residence times. However, the slope of the residence time

distribution does provide an estimate of the overall affinity and can be used for

426

comparing TFs and their function under different conditions.

Discussion
In the present study, we describe a new photobleaching correction method to

430

prevent photobleaching-related bias of the dwell time distribution of TFs. This method is

431

based on histone SMT dynamics, used here as a proxy for photobleaching kinetics

432

within the focal plane (Fig. 2). When correcting H2B SMT data by itself with this new

433

approach, we showed that the survival distribution of H2B exhibits a “plateau” (Fig. 2c).

434

This indicates very slow dynamics for the core histone, much longer than our

435

experimental time scale, and is fully compatible with previously published FRAP data40.

436

Additionally, we are now able to reconcile data acquired under different experimental

437

conditions (Fig. 2d-e) whereas previous attempts were not successful10, 20, 41, 42.

438

Given the current phenomenological interpretation of SMT data and the general

439

lack of a model-based approach in the field, we derived theory-based models in an

440

attempt to explain TF dynamics more accurately. We explored three different models:

441

the classic bi-exponential model, a kinetic three-state model and a power-law model

442

(Fig. 4). After correcting for photobleaching and implementation of Bayesian Information

443

Criterion, we could identify the best predictive model that explained the residence time

444

distribution of a paradigmatic TF, the GR. Surprisingly, the dwell time distribution of

445

activated-GR is best described by a power-law. Although a recent study corrected PB of

446

NF-B dynamics by normalization with the H2B dwell time distribution, they still reported

447

exponential behavior of the TF43. However, they did not consider alternative models and

448

the range of detected experimental dwell times is relatively short (maximum ~10 s),

449

which might have prevented observation (and verification) of asymptotic power law

450

behavior.

451

Our observation of power law behavior of GR residence times suggests a model

452

with a continuum of DNA-bound states rather than discrete non-specific/specific binding

453

of TFs. Consistent with this model, wash-out of the hormone (Fig. 3e) revealed that the

454

dwell time distribution also follows a power law, indicating no apparent dynamical

455

differences between the so-called specific and non-specific binding. Nevertheless, the

456

overall residence time decreases when the receptor is less active, suggesting that a

457

majority of the longer events observed with the fully activated receptor are associated

458

with productive transcription as previously reported8, 10, 12, 17, 43. However, non-specific

459

binding can also result in TF binding events with long residence times, the implications

460

of which are still not known. Critical efforts are required to investigate whether the

461

slow(er) stops seen in SMT are matched exclusively to specific interactions with

462

chromatin. Alternatively, a sub-population of these “stops” could correspond to

463

microscopic regions in the nucleus where diffusion is severely impaired, or transient

464

interaction with “clustered” structures such as foci observed for GR44, or another hitherto

465

unknown mechanism.

466

The broad distribution of affinities is puzzling but may be explained by

467

heterogeneity in the nuclear structure and chromatin environment. Targets for a

468

searching TF certainly exist in a wide variety of chromatin states (compacted fibers,

469

different nucleosome modification conditions, etc.). Also, affinities for the thousands of

470

alternative binding sites in response elements must vary significantly. Furthermore,

471

recent work points to the presence of transcriptional hubs and liquid-liquid phase

472

separation domains45 that contribute to the complexity of nuclear organization. If TFs

473

exhibit different dynamical properties in these structures, it is not surprising to find a

474

broad variation in binding affinities. The resulting broad distribution of binding affinities

475

in these scenarios goes against the widely-held assumption that TF dynamics on

476

chromatin results from well-separated and narrow distributions of specific and non-

477

specific binding (Fig. 5).

502

on chromatin can be viewed as a collection of traps with a distribution of trap depths

503

(analogous to binding affinities). In such a finite disordered system, the distribution of

504

trapping times asymptotically approaches a power law46, 47 (Fig. 5b, Supplementary

505

Note 1.5)

506

Given the heterogeneities in local organization and nuclear structure, TF binding sites

Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, heterogeneity in the searching

507

mechanism of TFs may affect the effective affinity constant observed in SMT

508

experiments. In support of the latter, the tetracycline repressor (TetR), a chimera

509

between a bacterial and a viral protein with no known endogenous targets in

510

mammalian cells, when used as a proxy to emulate TF dynamics, also showed power-

511

law behavior for “non-specific binding”48, 49. However, it could still be described as an

512

exponential on an artificially (and single) specific DNA binding array49. Thus, the intrinsic

513

nature of the searching mechanism of any DNA-binding protein may be governed by

514

power-law dynamics. In addition, the heterogeneity of dwell times in the thousands of

515

response elements for an endogenous TF could explain why GR can present power-law

516

tails as opposed to TetR, which can only bind to one artificial array site. Interestingly, a

517

recent study in yeast50 reports that both the TF Ace1p and the chromatin remodeler

518

RSC binding follow a bi-exponential binding distribution in cells containing a natural

519

tandem of ten CUP1 (Ace1p responsive) genes. This dynamic and discrete behavior, in

520

contrast with our GR data, can be explained by the particular and homogeneous

521

chromatin environment of single array of specific sites. Consequently, we speculate that

522

a broad distribution of binding affinities coming from a whole population of different

523

binding sites (thousands in the case of GR) may result in a power-law behavior (Fig. 5).

524

In summary, by the implementation of proper photobleaching kinetics, we reveal a new

525

model of TF dynamics. Our findings suggest that, contrary to the established paradigm,

526

TF dwell times follow a broad distribution with no evidence of binary, discrete

527

populations.
