Abstract

16

Bacterial populations vary in their stress tolerance and population structure depending

17

upon whether growth occurs in well-mixed or structured environments. We hypothesized

18

that evolution in biofilms would generate greater genetic diversity than well-mixed

19

environments and lead to different pathways of antibiotic resistance. We used

20

experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing to test how the biofilm lifestyle

21

influenced the rate, genetic mechanisms, and pleiotropic effects of resistance to

22

ciprofloxacin in Acinetobacter baumannii populations. Both evolutionary dynamics and

23

the identities of mutations differed between lifestyle. Planktonic populations experienced

24

selective sweeps of mutations including the primary topoisomerase drug targets, whereas

25

biofilm-adapted populations acquired mutations in regulators of efflux pumps. An overall

26

trade-off between fitness and resistance level emerged, wherein biofilm-adapted clones

27

were less resistant than planktonic but more fit in the absence of drug. However, biofilm

28

populations developed collateral sensitivity to cephalosporins, demonstrating the clinical

29

relevance of lifestyle on the evolution of resistance.

Introduction

31

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the main challenges facing modern medicine.

32

The emergence and rapid dissemination of resistant bacteria is decreasing the

33

effectiveness of antibiotics and it is estimated that 700,000 people die per year due to

34

AMR-related problems (O´Neill, 2016). AMR, like all phenotypes, is an evolved

35

property, either the ancient product of living amidst other microbial producers of

36

antimicrobials (Martínez, 2008), or the recent product of strong selection by human

37

activities for novel resistance-generating mutations (Ventola, 2015).

38
39

The dominant mode of growth for most microbes is on surfaces, and this biofilm lifestyle

40

is central to AMR (Ahmed, Porse, Sommer, Hoiby, & Ciofu, 2018; Hoiby, Bjarnsholt,

41

Givskov, Molin, & Ciofu, 2010; Olsen, 2015), especially in chronic infections (Wolcott,

42

2017; Wolcott et al., 2010). However, with few exceptions (Ahmed et al., 2018; France,

43

Cornea, Kehlet-Delgado, & Forney, 2019; Ridenhour et al., 2017), most of the research

44

on the evolution of AMR has been conducted in well-mixed populations [reviewed in

45

(Hughes & Andersson, 2017)] or on agar plates (Michael Baym et al., 2016), conditions

46

that cannot simulate the effects of biofilms on the evolution of AMR. Consequently, our

47

understanding of how this lifestyle influences the evolution of AMR, whether by different

48

population-genetic dynamics or molecular mechanisms, is limited. One example is that

49

the close proximity of cells in biofilms may facilitate the horizontal transfer and

50

persistence of resistance genes in bacterial populations (Ridenhour et al., 2017; Stalder &

51

Top, 2016). Less appreciated is the potential for the biofilm lifestyle to influence the

52

evolution of AMR by de novo chromosomal mutations. This emergence of AMR in

53

biofilms is important because: i) the environmental structure of biofilms can increase

54

clonal interference, rendering selection less effective and enhancing genetic diversity

(Cooper, Staples, Traverse, & Ellis, 2014; Ellis, Traverse, Mayo-Smith, Buskirk, &

56

Cooper, 2015; France et al., 2019; Habets, Rozen, Hoekstra, & de Visser, 2006; Traverse,

57

Mayo-Smith, Poltak, & Cooper, 2013), ii) distinct ecological conditions within the

58

biofilm can favor functionally distinct adaptations to different niches (Poltak & Cooper,

59

2011), iii) the biofilm itself can protect its residents from being exposed to external

60

stresses like antibiotics or host immunity (Eze, Chenia, & El Zowalaty, 2018; E. Geisinger

61

& Isberg, 2015), and iv) slower growth within biofilms can reduce the efficacy of

62

antibiotics that preferentially attack fast-growing cells (Kirby, Garner, & Levin, 2012;

63

Walters, Roe, Bugnicourt, Franklin, & Stewart, 2003). The first two hypotheses would

64

predict more complex evolutionary dynamics within biofilms than in well-mixed

65

environments (Steenackers, Parijs, Foster, & Vanderleyden, 2016), while the second two

66

predict different rates of evolution, targets of selection, and likely less potent mechanisms

67

of AMR (Andersson & Hughes, 2014). Together, these potential factors call into question

68

the conventional wisdom of a tradeoff between fitness and antimicrobial resistance, a

69

relationship that remains to be clearly defined.

70
71

Here, we study the evolutionary dynamics and effects of new resistance mutations in the

72

opportunistic nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, which is often intrinsically

73

resistant to antibiotics or has been reported to rapidly evolve resistance to them (Doi,

74

Murray, & Peleg, 2015). This pathogen is categorized as one of the highest threats to

75

patient safety (Asif, Alvi, & Rehman, 2018), partly due to its ability to live on inanimate

76

surfaces in biofilms (Eze et al., 2018). We experimentally propagated populations of A.

77

baumannii exposed either to subinhibitory or increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin

78

(CIP) over 80 generations in biofilm or planktonic conditions to ascertain whether these

79

lifestyles select for different mechanisms of AMR. Rather than focusing on the genotypes

80

of single isolates, which can limit the scope of an analysis, we conducted whole-

81

population genomic sequencing over time to define the dynamics of adaptation and the

82

fitness of certain resistance alleles compared to others in the experiment. We then

83

identified clones with specific genotypes that we linked to fitness and resistance

84

phenotypes. This approach sheds new light on the ways that pathogens adapt to antibiotics

85

while growing in biofilms and has implications for treatment decisions.

87

Results and Discussion

88

1. Experimental evolution

89

Replicate cultures of the susceptible A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978 (Baumann,

90

Doudoroff, & Stanier, 1968; Piechaud & Second, 1951) were established under

91

planktonic or biofilm conditions in one of three treatments: i) no antibiotics, ii) sub-

92

inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) and iii) evolutionary rescue

93

(Bell & Gonzalez, 2009) in which CIP concentrations were increased every 72 hours from

94

subinhibitory concentrations to four times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)

95

(Figure 1A). Before the start of the antibiotic evolution experiment, we propagated the

96

ATCC strain for ten days in planktonic conditions to reduce the influence of adaptation

97

to the laboratory conditions on subsequent comparisons. CIP was chosen because of its

98

clinical importance in treating A. baumannii (Ardebili, Lari, & Talebi, 2014; Doi et al.,

99

2015; Lopes & Amyes, 2013), its ability to penetrate the biofilm matrix (Tseng et al.,

100

2013) allowing similar efficacy in well mixed and structured populations (Kirby et al.,

101

2012), and because it is not known to stimulate biofilm formation in A. baumannii (Aka

102

& Haji, 2015). Planktonic populations were serially passaged by daily 1:100 dilution

103

while biofilm populations were propagated using a bead model simulating the biofilm life

104

cycle (Poltak & Cooper, 2011; Traverse et al., 2013; Turner, Marshall, & Cooper, 2018).

105

This model selects for bacteria that attach to a 7 mm polystyrene bead, form a biofilm,

106

and then disperse to colonize a new bead each day. (A video tutorial for this protocol is

107

available at http://evolvingstem.org). The transfer population size in biofilm and in

108

planktonic cultures was set to be nearly equivalent at the beginning of the experiment

109

(approximately 1x107 CFU/mL), because population size influences mutation availability

110

and the response to selection (Cooper, 2018; Salverda, Koomen, Koopmanschap, Zwart,

111

& de Visser, 2017). The mutational dynamics of three lineages from each treatment were

112

tracked by whole-population genomic sequencing (Figure 1A). We also sequenced 49

113

single clones isolated from 22 populations at the end of the 12-day experiment to

114

determine mutation linkage.

115
116

2. Evolution of CIP resistance

117

The rate and extent of evolved resistance depends on the strength of antibiotic selection

118

(Andersson & Hughes, 2014; Oz et al., 2014), the distribution of fitness effects of

119

mutations that increase resistance to the drug (Maclean, Hall, Perron, & Buckling, 2010),

120

and the population size of replicating bacteria (Cooper, 2018; Salverda et al., 2017). The

121

mode of bacterial growth can in principle alter each of these three variables and generate

122

different dynamics and magnitudes of AMR. In the populations exposed to the increasing

123

concentrations of CIP (the evolutionary rescue), the magnitude of evolved CIP resistance

124

differed between planktonic and biofilm populations. Planktonic populations became

125

approximately 160x more resistant on average than the ancestral clone while the biofilm

126

populations became only 6x more resistant (Figure 1B and Table S1). Planktonic

127

populations also evolved resistance much more rapidly, becoming 10x more resistant

128

after only 24 hours of growth in sub-inhibitory CIP. This level of resistance would have

129

been sufficient for surviving the remainder of the experiment, but MICs continued to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

130

increase at each sampling (Figure 1B). The evolution of resistance far beyond the

131

selective requirement indicates that mutations conferring higher resistance also increased

132

fitness in planktonic populations exposed to CIP.

133
134

In contrast, biofilm-evolved populations evolved under the evolutionary rescue regime

135

acquired much lower levels of resistance (ca. 3– 7x the ancestral MIC) and primarily in

136

a single step between days 3 and 4 (Figure 1B). In one notable exception, the MIC of

137

biofilm population B2 increased ~50x after 3 days of selection in subinhibitory

138

concentrations of CIP (Figure 1B), but then the resistance of this population declined to

139

only 6x higher than the ancestral strain. This dynamic suggested that a mutant conferring

140

high-level resistance rose to intermediate frequency but was replaced by a more fit, yet

141

less resistant, mutant (this possibility is evaluated below).

142
143

Lower levels of resistance were observed in populations selected at constant subinhibitory

144

concentrations of CIP. Biofilm populations were 4x more resistant than the ancestor and

145

planktonic populations were 20x more resistant (Table S1). We can infer that biofilm

146

growth does not select for the high-level resistance seen in planktonic populations, instead

147

favoring mutants with low levels of resistance and better adapted to life in a biofilm. It is

148

important to note that these MIC measurements were made in planktonic conditions

149

according to the clinical standards (CLSI, 2007) and that these values increased when

150

measured in biofilm (Table S2). Our results correspond with studies of clinical isolates in

151

which those producing more biofilm (and likely having adapted in biofilm conditions)

152

were less resistant than non-biofilm-forming isolates (Wang et al., 2018). Nevertheless,

153

measuring growth and MIC is context-dependent (Borriello et al., 2004; Hill et al., 2005;

154

Kirby et al., 2012), and because the biofilm environment at least partially protects cells

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

155

from antibiotic exposure (Table S2), it can be argued that evolved biofilm populations

156

experienced lower CIP concentrations than planktonic populations. However, we selected

157

CIP because it can penetrate the biofilm barrier (Tseng et al., 2013), and furthermore,

158

cells growing in the bead model must disperse from one bead to colonize the next one in

159

a less protected state. Overall, these results demonstrate that exposing bacteria to low

160

levels of antibiotic risks selection for high levels of resistance that can make future

161

treatment more difficult (Wistrand-Yuen et al., 2018).

162
163

3. Evolutionary dynamics under CIP treatment

164

In large bacterial populations (>105 cells) growing under strong selection, adaptive

165

mutations conferring beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance will dominate

166

population dynamics (Jeffrey E Barrick & Lenski, 2013; Cooper, 2018). Therefore, if a

167

single mutation renders the antibiotic ineffective and provides the highest fitness gain, it

168

would be expected to outcompete all other less fit mutations. Further, the stronger the

169

selection for resistance, the greater the probability of genetic parallelism among replicate

170

populations (Bolnick, Barrett, Oke, Rennison, & Stuart, 2018). Under the conditions of

171

these experiments, approximately 106 mutations occur in the first growth cycle and

172

roughly 107 mutations arise over the 12 days of selection, leading to a probability of 0.98

173

that every site in the 4Mbp A. baumannii genome experiences a mutation at least once

174

over the course of the 12-day experiment (see Table S3 for details of these calculations).

175

The dramatic differences in the evolved resistance levels of planktonic and biofilm

176

populations suggested distinct genetic causes of resistance resulting from different

177

selective forces in these treatments. We also predicted greater genetic diversity in the

178

biofilm treatments, owing to spatial structure and/or niche differentiation (Traverse et al.,

179

2013), than in the planktonic cultures, in which we expected selective sweeps (Jeffrey E.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

180

Barrick et al., 2009). A signature of spatial structure alone might be different mutations

181

in the same gene with predicted similar function coexisting over time, which is a form of

182

clonal interference (de Visser & Rozen, 2006). A signature of niche differentiation might

183

be the coexistence of mutations in different genes with unique functions, which is a form

184

of adaptive radiation (Kassen, 2009).

185
186

We conducted whole-population genomic sequencing of three replicates per treatment to

187

identify all contending mutations above a detection threshold of 5% (see Methods). The

188

spectrum of mutations from CIP-treated populations are consistent with expectations

189

from strong positive selection on altered or disrupted coding sequences (see Table 1 for

190

day-12 results and Table S4 for dynamics across the experiment). High nonsynonymous

191

to synonymous mutation ratios were observed in both lifestyles (8.5 in planktonic and 9.7

192

in biofilm). 43% of the total mutations in planktonic and 34% in biofilm were insertions

193

or deletions, which is vastly enriched over typical mutation rates of ~10 SNPs/indel under

194

neutral conditions (Dillon, Sung, Sebra, Lynch, & Cooper, 2017; Lynch et al., 2016).

195

Roughly 30% of the mutations in CIP-treated populations of either lifestyle occurred in

196

intergenic regions (30% in planktonic-propagated populations and 32% in biofilm). Of

197

the intergenic mutations, 72% of the planktonic mutations and 18% of the biofilm

198

mutations occurred in promoters, 5’ untranslated regions, or in putative terminators

199

(Kröger et al., 2018).

200
201

As expected from theory, in CIP-selected planktonic populations where selection is most

202

efficient, one or two mutations rapidly outcompeted others and fixed (Figure 2). Selection

203

in biofilms, however, produced fewer selective sweeps and maintained more contending

204

mutations, especially at lower antibiotic concentrations. In one population, multiple

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

205

mutations in the same locus (adeL) rose to high frequency and persisted, which is

206

consistent with the effect of population structure alone. In the other two populations,

207

mutations in different efflux pumps (adeL, adeS, adeN) contended during the experiment,

208

which could be explained by population structure or ecological diversification, if these

209

mutations produced different phenotypes. Overall, across all treatments and timepoints,

210

biofilm-adapted populations were significantly more diverse than the planktonic-adapted

211

populations (Shannon index; Kruskal Wallis, chi-squared = 7.723, p = 0.005), particularly

212

at subinhibitory concentrations of CIP (Figure S1A). Notably, increasing drug

213

concentrations eliminated the differences in diversity between treatments (Figure S1B),

214

but the greater diversity in biofilms treated with lower doses generated more diversity for

215

selection to act upon in a changing environment. This higher standing diversity is

216

important when considering dosing and when antibiotic exposure may be low (e.g. in the

217

external environment or when bound to tissues) (Baquero, Negri, Morosini, & Blazquez,

218

1998; Khan, Berglund, Khan, Lindgren, & Fick, 2013) because biofilms with more allelic

219

diversity have a greater chance of survival to drug and immune attack (Fux, Costerton,

220

Stewart, & Stoodley, 2005).

221
222

In contrast with the data observed in the populations evolving under CIP pressure, drug-

223

free control populations contained no mutations that achieved high frequency during the

224

experiment (Figures 2C and 2D). These results suggest that the ancestral starting clone

225

was already well-adapted to our experimental conditions, likely because we had

226

previously propagated the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 clone under identical drug-free

227

conditions for 10 days. This preadaptation phase led to the fixation of mutations in three

228

genes (Table S5).

230

4. Lifestyle determines the selected mechanisms of resistance

231

A. baumannii clinical samples acquire resistance to CIP by two principal mechanisms:

232

modification of the direct antibiotic targets — gyrase A or B and topoisomerase IV — or

233

by the overexpression of efflux pumps reducing the intracellular concentrations of the

234

antibiotic (Doi et al., 2015). To directly associate genotypes with resistance phenotypes,

235

we sequenced 49 clones isolated at the end of the experiment, the majority of which were

236

selected to delineate genotypes in the evolutionary rescue populations (Figures 2F and

237

S2).

238
239

Both the genetic targets and mutational dynamics of selection in planktonic and biofilm

240

environments differed. Mutations disrupting three negative regulators of efflux pumps

241

evolved in parallel across populations exposed to CIP, but mutations in two of these (adeL

242

and adeS) were nearly exclusive to biofilm clones (Figure 2F). The most common and

243

highest frequency mutations observed in the biofilm populations were in the repressor

244

gene adeL (Figures 2F, S2, and Table S6), which regulates AdeFGH, one of three

245

resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump systems in A. baumannii (Coyne,

246

Rosenfeld, Lambert, Courvalin, & Perichon, 2010; Fernando, Zhanel, & Kumar, 2013;

247

Pournaras, Koumaki, Gennimata, Kouskouni, & Tsakris, 2016). In the planktonic lines,

248

the predominant mutations were found in adeN, which is a negative regulator of AdeIJK

249

and were mainly insertions of IS701 that disrupted the gene (X.-Z. Li, C. A. Elkins, & H.

250

I. Zgurskaya, 2016).

251
252

In biofilm lines, different contending adeL mutations were detected in each replicate after

253

24 hours then eventually fixed as CIP concentrations increased (green lines in Figure 2B),

254

sometimes along with a secondary adeL mutation. This pattern suggests that altering

255

efflux via adeL generates adaptations to the combination of CIP and biofilm which is

256

supported by the increase in biofilm formation by the adeL mutants (Figure S3). Further,

257

mutants with higher resistance than necessary appear to be maladaptive in the biofilm

258

treatment. For example, adeN (found more often in planktonic culture) and adeS

259

mutations found simultaneously on day 3 in population B2 (Figure 2) led to a spike in

260

resistance at that timepoint (Figure 1), but these alleles were subsequently outcompeted

261

by adeL mutants that were evidently more fit despite lower planktonic resistance.

262
263

In contrast to the biofilm populations, all planktonic populations with increasing

264

concentrations of CIP eventually acquired a single high frequency mutation in gyrA

265

(S81L), the canonical ciprofloxacin-resistant mutation in DNA gyrase. These gyrA

266

mutations evolved in genetic backgrounds containing either an adeN mutant or a pgpB

267

mutant. pgpB is a gene that encodes a putative membrane associated lipid phosphatase

268

and is co-regulated by adeN (Hua, Chen, Li, & Yu, 2014). Other mutations associated

269

with high levels of resistance affected parC, encoding topoisomerase IV, and regulatory

270

regions of two putative transporters, ACX60_RS15145 and ACX60_RS1613, the latter

271

being co-transcribed with the multidrug efflux pump abeM (Su, Chen, Mizushima,

272

Kuroda, & Tsuchiya, 2005). Few other mutations exceeded the 10% of the total

273

population filter in the planktonic lines. The rapid fixation of only adeN and adeN-

274

regulated alleles in the planktonic CIP-exposed populations indicate that adeN conferred

275

higher fitness than other CIP-resistant mutations at low drug concentrations.

276

Subsequently, at increased concentrations of CIP, on-target mutations in gyrA were

277

favored in each line.

279

Together, our results demonstrate that bacterial lifestyle influences the evolutionary

280

dynamics and targets of selection of AMR. Loss-of-function mutations in regulators of

281

the adeFGH and adeABC RND efflux pumps that increased CIP resistance ~4-fold in

282

biofilm populations treated with CIP. Adaptation by planktonic populations exposed to

283

CIP proceeded first by altering the adeN-controlled adeIJK efflux pump and then by

284

directly altering the targets of the fluoroquinolone, gyrA and parC, leading to much higher

285

levels of resistance.

286
287

5. Evolutionary consequences of acquiring resistance

288

The large population sizes (107 – 109 cells) and number of generations (~80) in all evolved

289

lines mean that similar mutations very likely arose in each replicate regardless of

290

treatment, meaning that the success of some mutations over others reflects their greater

291

fitness in that condition (Table S3) (Cooper, 2018). Yet de novo acquired antibiotic

292

resistance is often associated with a fitness cost in the absence of antibiotics [reviewed in

293

(Vogwill & MacLean, 2015)]. The extent of this cost and the ability to compensate for it

294

by secondary mutations (compensatory evolution) is a key attribute determining the

295

spread and maintenance of the resistance mechanism (Maclean et al., 2010; Moore,

296

Rozen, & Lenski, 2000; Vogwill & MacLean, 2015; Zhao & Drlica, 2002). A negative

297

correlation between CIP resistance and fitness of resistant genotypes in the absence of

298

antibiotics has been previously described in Escherichia coli, suggesting a trade-off

299

between these traits (Basra et al., 2018; Huseby et al., 2017; Marcusson, Frimodt-Moller,

300

& Hughes, 2009).

301
302

To determine the relationship between resistance and fitness in the absence of antibiotics

303

in our experiment, we chose 10 clones (5 each from biofilm and planktonic populations,

304

Figures 2F and S2) with different genotypes and putative resistance mechanisms and

305

measured their resistance and fitness phenotypes in both planktonic and biofilm

306

conditions (Figure 3). As expected from the populations (Figure 1B), the biofilm clones

307

much were less resistant in planktonic conditions than those evolved planktonically [MIC

308

= 0.58 mg/L (SEM = 0.13) vs. MIC = 8.53 mg/L (SEM = 1.96), two-tailed t-test: p < 0.05,

309

t = 4.048, df = 80]. However, biofilm-evolved clones were more fit relative to the

310

ancestral strain than the planktonic-evolved clones in the absence of antibiotic (two-tailed

311

t-test: p = 0.008, t = 2.984 df = 18) (Figure 3). Importantly, these fitness measurements

312

were made in both planktonic and biofilm conditions, demonstrating that even in the

313

conditions they evolved in, the planktonic selected clones were less fit as a result of

314

antibiotic resistance trade-offs. However, one planktonic-evolved clone with mutations

315

in both gyrA and parC exhibited no significant fitness cost and high levels of resistance.

316

This suggests that, as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the parC mutation may compensate

317

for the cost imposed by gyrA mutation (Kugelberg, Lofmark, Wretlind, & Andersson,

318

2005), an example of sign epistasis (Sackman & Rokyta, 2018). Overall, mutants selected

319

in biofilm-evolved populations were less resistant than mutants selected in planktonic

320

populations (Figure 1B) but produced more biofilm (Figure S3) and paid little or no

321

fitness cost in the absence of antibiotics (Figures 3). This cost-free resistance implies that

322

these subpopulations could persist in the absence of drug, limiting the treatment options

323

and demanding new approaches to treat high fitness, resistant pathogens (Baym, Stone,

324

& Kishony, 2016).

325
326

6. Evolutionary interactions with other antibiotics

327

When a bacterium acquires resistance to one antibiotic, the mechanism of resistance can

328

also confer resistance to other antibiotics (cross-resistance) or increase the susceptibility

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

329

to other antibiotics (collateral sensitivity) (Pal, Papp, & Lazar, 2015). We tested the MIC

330

of the evolved populations to 23 different antibiotics in planktonic conditions. We

331

observed changes in susceptibilities to 13 of the 23 antibiotics tested, and these changes

332

were growth mode dependent (Figure 4). For example, planktonic populations exhibited

333

cross resistance to cefpodoxime and ceftazidime, but biofilm populations evolved

334

collateral sensitivity to these cephalosporins. Cross-resistance was associated genetically

335

with adeN, adeS, gyrA or pgpB mutations, and collateral sensitivity was associated with

336

adeL mutations. Selection in these environments evidently favors the activation of

337

different efflux pumps or modified targets that have different pleiotropic consequences

338

for multidrug resistance (Podnecky et al., 2018).

339
340

The mechanisms leading to collateral sensitivity are still poorly understood but they

341

depend on the genetic background of the strain, the nature of the resistance mechanisms

342

(Barbosa et al., 2017; Yen & Papin, 2017), and the specific physiological context of the

343

cells (Leus et al., 2018). In A. baumannii, each RND efflux pump is suggested to be

344

specific for certain classes of antibiotics (Coyne, Courvalin, & Perichon, 2011; Leus et

345

al., 2018; X. Z. Li, C. A. Elkins, & H. I. Zgurskaya, 2016). Similar to our results (Figure

346

4), Yoon and collaborators demonstrated that efflux pumps AdeABC and AdeIJK,

347

regulated by adeS and adeN respectively, increased the resistance level to some β-lactams

348

when overexpressed (Yoon et al., 2015). However, production of AdeFGH, the efflux

349

pump regulated by adeL, decreased resistance to some β-lactams and other families of

350

antibiotics or detergents by an unknown mechanism (Leus et al., 2018; Yoon et al., 2015).

351

Increased sensitivity to β-lactams with efflux overexpression has also been reported in P.

352

aeruginosa (Azimi & Rastegar Lari, 2017), which demonstrates the urgency of

353

understanding the physiological basis of collateral sensitivity to control AMR evolution.

354

Exploiting collateral sensitivity has been proposed to counteract the evolution of resistant

355

populations both in bacteria (Imamovic & Sommer, 2013; Kim, Lieberman, & Kishony,

356

2014; Nichol et al., 2019) and in cancer (Dhawan et al., 2017). Remarkably, our results

357

show that biofilm growth, commonly thought to broaden resistance, may actually

358

generate collateral sensitivity during treatment with CIP and potentially other

359

fluoroquinolones.

360
361

7. Clinical relevance

362

Our results demonstrate that the mode of growth determines both the mechanism of

363

evolved resistance and the spectrum of sensitivity to other families of antibiotics. Further,

364

the mutations selected in our experimental conditions also play an important role in

365

clinical isolates, as fluoroquinolone resistance mediated by plasmids in A. baumannii

366

appears to be rare (Yang, Hu, Liu, Ye, & Li, 2016). The mutations S81L in gyrA and

367

S80L in parC acquired by the sensitive ATCC 17978 strain used in this study have been

368

reported worldwide as the primary mechanism conferring high levels of resistance to

369

fluorquinolones in clinical isolates (Adams-Haduch et al., 2008; Dahdouh et al., 2017;

370

W. A. Warner et al., 2016).

371
372

In addition to the on-target mechanisms of resistance through gyrase or topoisomerase

373

mutations, A. baumannii isolates acquire comparatively moderate levels of

374

fluoroquinolone resistance by modifications in various RND efflux pumps. These RND

375

efflux pumps have overlapping yet differing substrate profiles and may act synergistically

376

in increasing the resistance level (Table S7) (Coyne et al., 2010; Damier-Piolle, Magnet,

377

Bremont, Lambert, & Courvalin, 2008; Fernando et al., 2013; Rosenfeld, Bouchier,

378

Courvalin, & Perichon, 2012). In our experiment, all biofilm and planktonic populations

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/581611; this version posted April 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

379

and nearly all isolated clones acquired mutations in at least one of the three regulators of

380

the RND efflux pumps (adeL, adeS, adeN) or in a gene regulated by one of these

381

regulators (pgpB). Mutations in adeL upregulate the expression of the RND efflux pump

382

AdeFGH (Figure 2, Table S7) that is associated with a multidrug resistant phenotype in

383

clinical isolates (Coyne et al., 2010; Fernando et al., 2013; Leus et al., 2018; Pournaras et

384

al., 2016). AdeL-AdeFGH genes are often highly expressed in infection isolates, which

385

could reflect adaptation to the biofilm lifestyle (Coyne et al., 2010; Fernando et al., 2013).

386

Further, overexpression of adeG is predicted to enhance transport of acylated homoserine

387

lactones, including quorum-sensing autoinducers, which can increase both drug

388

resistance and biofilm formation (Alav, Sutton, & Rahman, 2018; He et al., 2015).

389

However, in clinical isolates, overexpression of the AdeFGH pump is less common than

390

the AdeIJK efflux pump that is regulated by adeN (Rosenfeld et al., 2012; Yoon et al.,

391

2015). AdeIJK contributes to resistance to biocides, hospital disinfectants, and to both

392

intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii (Damier-Piolle et al., 2008;

393

Rosenfeld et al., 2012) and may decrease biofilm formation, which could explain its

394

prevalence in planktonic populations here (Yoon et al., 2015). Perhaps more concerning,

395

this study demonstrates that the overexpression of RND efflux pumps as a resistance

396

mechanism may produce little fitness cost in A. baumannii, as has previously been

397

demonstrated in both P. aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Olivares Pacheco,

398

Alvarez-Ortega, Alcalde Rico, & Martínez, 2017; D. M. Warner, Folster, Shafer, & Jerse,

399

2007).

400
401

Conclusions

402

We used experimental evolution of the opportunistic pathogen A. baumannii in both well-

403

mixed and biofilm conditions to examine how lifestyle influences the dynamics, diversity,

404

identity of genetic mechanisms, and direct and pleiotropic effects of resistance to a

405

common antibiotic. Experimental evolution is a powerful method of screening naturally

406

arising genetic variation for mutants that are the best fit in a defined condition (Cooper,

407

2018; Elena & Lenski, 2003; Van den Bergh, Swings, Fauvart, & Michiels, 2018). When

408

population sizes are large and reproductive rates are rapid, as they were here, the

409

probability that all possible single-step mutations that can increase both resistance and

410

fitness occurred in each population is very likely. The few mutations selected here as well

411

as their repeated order with increasing CIP concentrations demonstrates that these are the

412

most fit mutations in this A. baumannii strain and set of environmental conditions. The

413

prevalence of some of these mutations in clinical samples suggests that they too may have

414

been exposed to selection in similar conditions. Likewise, the absence of other mutations

415

reported in shotgun mutant screens of resistance in A. baumannii (Edward Geisinger et

416

al., 2018) means that these mutants produced less resistance, lower fitness, or both.

417

Evolution experiments hold promise for ultimately forecasting mutations selected by

418

different

419

diversification of the pathogen population and the likelihood of collateral sensitivity or

420

cross-resistance (Brockhurst et al., 2019). Furthermore, knowledge of the prevailing

421

lifestyle of the pathogen population may be critically important for treatment design.

422

Most infections are likely caused by surface-attached populations (Wolcott, 2017;

423

Wolcott et al., 2010), and some treatments include cycling antibiotics that promote

424

biofilm as a primary response. For example, tobramycin is used for treating P. aeruginosa

425

in cystic fibrosis patients (Hamed & Debonnett, 2017) and promotes biofilm formation

426

(Hoffman et al., 2005; Linares, Gustafsson, Baquero, & Martinez, 2006), wherein the

427

evolution of antibiotic resistance without a detectable fitness cost may arise during

428

treatment. But the more diverse biofilm-adapted lineages in our experiments revealed a

429

striking vulnerability to cephalosporins, which could provide a new strategy for

430

treatment. Broader still, conventional wisdom has long held that the relationship between

431

resistance and fitness is antagonistic, and that the efficacy of many antimicrobials is aided

432

by a severe fitness cost of resistance (M. Baym et al., 2016; Hughes & Andersson, 2017;

433

Vogwill & MacLean, 2015). This study demonstrates that the form of the relationship

434

between fitness and resistance can be altered by the mode of growth, whereby biofilms

435

can align resistance and fitness traits. Continued efforts to determine how the fitness

436

landscape of various resistance pathways depends on the environment and its structure,

437

including growth mode, could produce a valuable forecasting tool to stem the rising AMR

438

tide.

440

Methods

441

Experimental evolution

442

Before the start of the antibiotic evolution experiment, we propagated well mixed tubes

443

founded by one clone of the susceptible A. baumannii strain ATCC 17978-mff (Baumann

444

et al., 1968; Piechaud & Second, 1951) in a modified M9 medium (referred to as M9+)

445

containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 42.2 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 21.7 mM

446

NaCl, 18.7 mM NH4Cl and 11.1 mM glucose and supplemented with 20 mL/L MEM

447

essential amino acids (Gibco 11130051), 10 mL/L MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco

448

11140050), and 1 mL each of trace mineral solutions A, B, and C (Corning 25021-3Cl).

449

This preadaptation phase was conducted in the absence of antibiotics for 10 days (ca. 66

450

generations) with a dilution factor of 100 per day.

451

After the ten days of preadaptation to M9+ medium, we selected a single clone and

452

propagated for 24 hours in M9+ in the absence of antibiotic. We then subcultured this

453

population into twenty replicate populations. Ten of the populations (5 planktonic and 5

454

biofilm) were propagated every 24 hours in constant subinhibitory concentrations of CIP,

455

0.0625 mg/L, which corresponds to 0.5x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

456

After 72 hours under subinhibitory concentrations of CIP, the populations were exposed

457

to two different antibiotic regimes for 9 more days, either constant subinhibitory

458

concentrations of CIP or increasing concentrations of CIP (called the evolutionary

459

rescue). For the latter, we doubled the CIP concentrations every 72 hours until 4x MIC.

460

As a control, the 20 remaining populations were propagated in the absence of CIP (Figure

461

1).

462
463

We propagated the populations into fresh media every 24 hours as described by Turner et

464

al. 2018 (Turner et al., 2018). For planktonic populations, we transferred a 1:100 (50 µl

465

into 5 mL of M9+) dilution, which corresponded to 6.64 generations per day. For biofilm

466

populations, we transferred a polystyrene bead (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) to

467

fresh media containing three sterile beads. We rinsed each bead in PBS before the

468

transfer, therefore reducing the transfer of planktonic cells. Each day we alternated

469

between black and white marked beads, ensuring that the bacteria were growing on the

470

bead for 24 hours, which corresponds to approximately 6 to 7.5 generations/day (Traverse

471

et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2018). For the experiment with increasing concentrations of

472

antibiotics, we froze a sample of each bacterial population on days 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and

473

12. In the experiment with constant exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of

474

antibiotics, we froze the populations on days 1, 3, 4, 9, and 12. We froze the control

475

populations at days 1, 4, 9, and 12. For planktonic populations, we froze 1 mL of culture

476

with 9% of DMSO. For freezing the biofilm populations, we sonicated the beads in 1 mL

477

of PBS with a probe sonicator and subsequently froze with 9% DMSO.

Phenotypic characterization: antimicrobial susceptibility and biofilm formation

480

We determined the MIC of CIP by broth microdilution in M9+ according to the Clinical

481

and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI, 2007), in which each bacterial

482

sample was tested to 2-fold-increasing concentration of CIP from 0.0625 to 64 mg/L. To

483

obtain a general picture of the resistance profiles we determined the MIC to 23 antibiotics

484

(amikacin,

485

cephalothin,

486

piperacillin/tazobactam,

487

ceftazidime, tobramycin, tigecycline, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone and

488

tetracycline) by broth microdilution in commercial microtiter plates following the

489

instructions provided by the manufacturers (Sensititre GN3F, Trek Diagnostics Inc.,

490

Westlake, OH). We tested the MIC at days 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12 for the populations

491

propagated under increasing concentrations of antibiotic, and at days 1 and 12 for the

492

subinhibitory and non-antibiotic treatments. For the CIP-MICs, we used Pseudomonas

493

aeruginosa PAO1 in Mueller Hinton broth as a control. No differences in the MICs were

494

found between Mueller Hinton and M9+ or if measuring the MIC in 96 well-plate or in 5

495

mL tubes, which are the experimental conditions. Each MIC was performed in triplicate.

496

The CIP was provided by Alfa Aesar (Alfa Aesar, Wardhill, MA). We also determined

497

the MIC of CIP in biofilm conditions adapting the method described by Diez-Aguilar to

498

the bead model (Díez-Aguilar et al., 2018). We resuspended each clone into fresh M9+

499

containing sterile beads (as in the experimental evolution conditions, each tube used

500

contained three sterile beads and 5 mL of M9+). After 24 hours growing at 37º, each bead

501

was propagated into new fresh M9+ containing different CIP concentrations (from 4 to

502

128 mg/L in 2-fold-increasing manner). After 24 growing at 37º, we rinsed each bead in

504

were transferred to 100 µL of M9+. The MIC was calculated after measuring the optical

505

density at 650 nm before and after 24 hours incubation. The inhibition of growth was

506

defined as the lowest antibiotic that resulted in an OD difference at or below 0.05 after 6

507

hours of incubation.

508
509

We estimated the biofilm formation of the selected clones using a modification of the

510

previously described protocol (O'Toole & Kolter, 1998). We resurrected each clone in 5

511

mL of M9+ containing 0.5 mg/L of CIP and grew them for 24 hours. For each strain, we

512

transferred 50 µl into 15 mL of M9+. We tested 200 µl of the previous dilution of each

513

clone to 4 different subinhibitory CIP concentrations (0 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, 0.03 mg/L and

514

0.0625 mg/L). After 24 hours of growing at 37ºC, we measured population sizes by

515

optical density (OD) at 590nm (ODPopulations). Then, we added 250 µl of 0.1% crystal violet

516

and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. After washing the wells and drying

517

for 24 hours, we added 250 µl 95% EtOH solution (95% EtOH, 4.95% dH2O, 0.05%

518

Triton X-100) to each well and incubated for 15 minutes and biofilm formation was

519

measured by the OD at 590nm (ODBiofilm). Biofilm formation was corrected by population

520

sizes (ODBiofilm/ODPopulation). Results are the average of three experiments (Figure S3).

521
522

Fitness measurement

523

We selected 5 biofilm and 5 planktonic clones at the end of the evolutionary rescue

524

experiment (Figure 2) and determined the fitness by directly competing the ancestral

525

strain and the evolved clone variants both in planktonic and in biofilm conditions (Figure

526

3) (Turner et al., 2018). We revived each clone from a freezer stock in M9+ for 24 hours.

527

We maintained the same evolutionary conditions to revive the clones, adding 3 beads

528

and/or CIP to the broth when required. After 24 hours, we added equal volume of the

529

clones and the ancestors in M9+ in the absence of antibiotics. For planktonic populations,

530

we mixed 25 µl of each competitor in 5 mL of M9+. For biofilm competitions, we

531

sonicated one bead per competitor in 1 mL of PBS and mixed in 5 mL of M9+ containing

532

3 beads. The mix was cultured at 37ºC for 24 hours. We plated at time zero and after 24

533

hours. For each competition, we plated aliquots onto nonselective tryptic soy agar and

534

tryptic soy agar containing CIP. Selection rate (r) was calculated as the difference of the

535

Malthusian parameters for the two competitors: r = (ln(CIP resistantd=1/CIP

536

resistantd=0))/(ln(CIP susceptibled=1/CIP susceptibled=0))/day (Lenski, 1991). Susceptible

537

populations were calculated as the difference between the total populations (number of

538

colonies/mL growing on the nonselective plates) and the resistant fraction (number of

539

colonies/mL growing on the plates containing CIP). As a control for calculating the

540

correct ratio of susceptible vs. resistant populations, we replica plated 50 to 100 colonies

541

from the nonselective plates onto plates containing CIP as previously described (Santos-

542

Lopez et al., 2017). Results are the average of three to five independent experiments.

543
544

Genome sequencing

545

We sequenced whole populations of three evolving replicates per treatment. We

the growth conditions under which they were isolated (i.e. the same CIP concentration

555

which they were exposed to during the experiment) and grew for 24 hours. DNA was

556

extracted using the Qiagen DNAeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hiden, Germany).

557

The sequencing library was prepared as described by Turner and colleagues (Turner et

558

al., 2018) according to the protocol of Baym et al. (Baym et al., 2015), using the Illumina

559

Nextera kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq500

560

at the Microbial Genome Sequencing center (http://micropopbio.org/sequencing.html).

Data processing

563

All sequences were first quality filtered and trimmed with the Trimmomatic software

564

v0.36 (Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014) using the criteria: LEADING:20 TRAILING:20

565

SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:70. Variants were called with the breseq software

566

v0.31.0 (Deatherage & Barrick, 2014) using the default parameters and the -p flag when

567

required for identifying polymorphisms in populations. This option calls a mutation if it

568

is observed in 2 reads from each strand and reaches 5% in the population. The average

569

depth of sequencing for populations was 219 + 51x and average genome coverage was

570

98.7 + 0.128%. The reference genome used for variant calling was downloaded from the

571

NCBI RefSeq database using the 17-Mar-2017 version of A. baumannii ATCC 17978-

572

mff complete genome (GCF_001077675.1). In addition to the chromosome

573

NZ_CP012004 and plasmid NZ_CP012005 sequences, we added two additional plasmid

574

sequences to the reference genome that are known to be present in our working strain of

575

A. baumannii ATCC 17978-mff: NC009083, NC_009084. Mutations were then manually

576

curated and filtered to remove false positives. Mutations were filtered if the gene was

577

found to contain a mutation when the ancestor sequence was compared to the reference

578

genome or if a mutation never reached a cumulative frequency of 10% across all replicate

populations. Diversity measurements were made in R using the Shannon index

580

considering the presence, absence, and frequency of alleles. Significant differences

581

between biofilm and planktonic populations were determined by the Kruskal Wallis test.

582

Filtering, mutational dynamics, and plotting were done in R v3.4.4 (www.r-project.org)

583

with the packages ggplot2 v2.2.1 (Wickham, 2016), dplyr v0.7.4 (Wickham, François,

584
