ABSTRACT

19

Dispersal dynamics and local filtering interactively generate regional vegetation patterns, but empirical

20

evidence of their combined influence in nature is scarce, representing a missing link between our

21

theoretical understanding of community assembly and real-world observation. Here, we compare seed

22

and adult plant communities at twelve grassland sites with different climates in southern Norway to

23

explore the degree to which community membership is shaped by dispersal limitation and local niche-

24

based filtering, and how this varies with climate. To do this, we first divide species at each site into two

25

groups: “locally-transient” species, which occur as seeds but are rare or absent as adults (i.e., they arrive

26

but are filtered out), or “locally-persistent” species, which occur consistently as adults in annual

27

vegetation surveys. We then ask questions to reveal where, when, why, and how locally-transient

28

species are systematically disfavored during community assembly. Our results led to four main

29

conclusions: (1) the strength of local filtering on community membership increased with temperature,

30

(2) surprisingly, local filtering was stronger during seedling emergence than during seedling

31

establishment, (3) climate-based niche differences drove differential performance among species,

32

especially for seeds dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into more stressful (colder and

33

drier) climates, and (4) locally-transient species had traits that may made them better dispersers

34

(smaller seeds) but poorer competitors for light (shorter statures, less persistent clonal connections)

35

than locally-persistent species, providing a potential explanation for why they arrived to new sites but

36

failed to establish persistent adult populations. Our study is one of the first to combine seed, seedling,

37

and adult survey data across multiple sites with different climates to provide a rigorous empirical

38

evaluation of the combined influence of dispersal limitation and local filtering on the generation and

39

maintenance of climate-associated vegetation patterns.

INTRODUCTION

45

Community assembly theory in a landscape or metacommunity context assumes an important role for

46

regional dispersal dynamics, either alone (i.e., neutral dynamics) or in conjunction with niche-based

47

performance differences (Leibold et al. 2004, Alexander et al. 2012). While empirical evidence has

48

demonstrated that dispersal and niche-based differences can each influence community membership on

49

their own (Choler et al. 2001, Ehrlén et al. 2006, Armas et al. 2011, Laliberté et al. 2014), there is a lack

50

of data detailing how these processes interact in nature, and how their combined influence changes

51

across environments, representing a missing link between theoretical assumptions and real-world

52

observations. This lack of empirical data raises potential problems when trying to model community

53

responses to disturbances like climate change, because different species may have different dispersal

54

abilities and/or different environmental constraints to expansion, leading to variable responses (Graae

55

et al. 2017).

56

The lack of regional dispersal data in community assembly research is particularly acute, and this

57

is due in large part to logistical challenges. Plant propagules are often tiny, numerous, difficult to

58

identify, capable of traveling great distances, and can remain dormant in the soil for years prior to

59

germination (Baskin and Baskin 1998, Vandvik et al. 2016). Some researchers have sidestepped these

60

difficulties by inferring dispersal patterns using indirect methods (Alexander et al. 2012). The “nearest-

61

neighbor” approach, for example, assumes connectivity in a metacommunity to be proportional to inter-

62

patch distance (Calabrese and Fagan 2004, Jacobson and Peres-Neto 2010). Other approaches infer

63

dispersal limitation from historical population shifts over periods of climate change (Kelly and Goulden

64

2008, Bertrand et al. 2011) or by analyzing population genetic structure. These indirect methods are

65

useful when modeling species distributions from a phenomenological standpoint, but fall far short of

66

evaluating whether particular species arrive or not to a given site (Calabrese and Fagan 2004). The small

67

number of studies that have directly assessed dispersal patterns, either by manually marking seeds (e.g.,

68

Xiao et al. 2006) or connecting seeds to parents using parentage analyses (e.g., Cain et al. 2000), are

69

often conducted for single species and/or over short distances, and are of limited use when considering

70

potential responses of dozens of species at landscape scales (Nathan and Muller-Landau 2000).

71

Here, we compare compositions of seed rain, seed bank, seedling, and adult plant communities

72

at sites along temperature and precipitation gradients to shed light on how seed dispersal and local

73

filtering interact in situ to shape community membership and maintain regional vegetation a patterns.

74

First, to evaluate the strength of local filtering processes, we divide the species at each site into two

75

groups: “locally-transient” species, which occur as seeds but are rare or absent as adults, and “locally-

76

persistent” species, which occur consistently as adults in annual vegetation surveys. Unlike the

77

distinction between “core” and “satellite” species sensu Hanski (1982), our framework allows species

78

status to vary by site, rather than be defined regionally. Next, we ask questions to elucidate where,

79

when, why, and how locally-transient species are selectively disfavored during community assembly,

80

and how this process varies by climate. We also use our adult vegetation surveys to infer which locally-

81

transient species have dispersed outside of their realized climate niches (i.e., are outside of the range of

82

climates where we know they persist as adults), and how their realized climate niches compare to local

83

climate conditions (i.e., if they have dispersed into warmer/wetter/cooler/drier climates). If we observe

84

strong performance differences between locally-transient and locally-persistent species at a site, then

85

we can conclude that local filtering processes (in combination with dispersal processes) play an

86

important role in governing community membership at that site. If we do not observe strong

87

performance differences, then we can conclude that dispersal dynamics (and not local filtering

88

processes) primarily govern community membership.

89

Our study takes place in a network of 12 alpine and subalpine grassland sites in southern

90

Norway, a region with unusually high spatial climate variability. The sites were selected according to

91

their mean summer temperatures and mean annual rainfalls such that they form an orthogonal climate

92

grid, facilitating independent assessment of these two important climate drivers in community

93

assembly. Prior work used subsets of the data used in this study to compare diversity patterns in the

94

seed bank and mature vegetation (Vandvik et al. 2016), to understand how trait-based community

95

composition varies with climate (Guittar et al. 2016), and to evaluate the relative balance of competition

96

and facilitation in seedling recruitment (Klanderud et al. 2017). We combine these previously published

97

data with new data on seed rain and seedling survival to ask how regional dispersal dynamics and local

98

filtering interactively govern community membership and regional vegetation patterns. After dividing

99

species into locally-transient and locally-persistent groups at each site, we ask the following specific

100

questions:

101

1. To what degree is community membership shaped by local filtering (i.e., what fraction of the

102

seeds at a site are of locally-transient species), and how does the strength of local filtering

103

vary with climate?

104
105
106
107
108

2. Are locally-transient species disfavored because they fail to emerge as seedlings, fail to
establish, fail to compete as adults, or a combination of the three?
3. Are locally-transient species disfavored because they dispersed outside of their realized
climate niches, indicating a role for climate-based niche filtering?
4. Are locally-transient species disfavored because they differ systematically from locally-

109

persistent species in their functional traits, offering mechanistic hypotheses for their

110

selective removal?

111

We conclude with a discussion of what our results mean for how these mountain grasslands will likely

112

respond to climate change.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

115

Study area. The study area comprises 12 semi-natural calcareous grassland sites in southern Norway

116

that host at least 144 non-woody vascular plant species at the adult life stage, and at least 126 at the

117

seed stage (Appendix S1: Table S1). Sites have similar bedrock, land use histories, slopes of

118

approximately 20°, and southwest aspects, but differ in mean summer temperature, defined as the

119

mean temperature of the four warmest months per year, and/or mean annual precipitation, such that

120

they form a grid with approximately orthogonal climate axes (Fig. 1). Interannual variation in mean

121

summer temperature and annual precipitation at each site over the sampling period (2008 – 2013) was

122

modest, with standard deviations of 0.79 °C and 238 mm, respectively, on average across sites. Each site

123

has five blocks, placed in representative areas of grassland vegetation within a 75 – 200 m2 area that

124

varies due to local topography and accessibility. Each block has a variable number of 25 x 25 cm plots

125

used for the data sets described below, as well as other experiments and surveys. Blocks were protected

126

from grazers with electric fences and manually mowed once a year to evenly simulate biomass loss due

127

to grazing. Taxonomic identifications follow Lid & Lid (2007). Woody species and bryophytes were

128

excluded from all analyses.

129
130

Seed rain data. We collected seed rain over two periods to target winter (September 2009 to June 2010)

131

and summer (June 2010 to September 2010) seed deposition. We trapped seeds in 25 x 25 cm artificial

132

turfs placed in gaps about 50 cm from seedling monitoring gaps (see below) in four blocks at each site,

133

for a total of 48 traps across all sites. The small synthetic filaments in artificial turfs effectively catch and

134

retain small particles like seeds. Turfs were gathered and flushed with water to free collected seeds. The

135

rinse water was passed through 500 µm and 125 µm diameter sieves to discriminate seeds by size and

136

remove debris. Seeds were counted and identified taxonomically using a stereomicroscope. We included

137

fruits, bulbils, and viviparous seeds in our working definition of “seeds.” Rates of seed predation in

138

artificial turfs are likely similar to natural rates experienced by seeds on the natural soil surface, thus

139

seed predation should not bias our results.

140
141

Seed bank data. To characterize seed bank diversity we haphazardly selected one 64 x 64 cm plot at

142

each site and excavated soil to a depth of 3 cm in October 2008. Because the seed bank survey area at

143

each site (0.41 m2) was larger than the total areas used for seed rain and seedling surveys at each site

144

(four 25 x 25 cm plots, 0.25 m2), we randomly subsampled 61 % (0.25 m2 / 0.41 m2) of the original seed

145

bank community in silico and discarded the remainder to standardize sampling effort across data types

146

at each site. To exclude the seeds from that year’s seed rain from our seed bank surveys, we removed

147

aboveground vegetation, including moss and litter. Soil samples were stored for three months at 2 – 4 °C

148

and ambient moisture. Soil samples were then sowed into a standard mixture of sterile subsoil and

149

placed in 30 x 60 cm trays. The trays were incubated in a greenhouse with a diurnal cycle of 16 hours

150

light (25 °C) and 8 hours darkness (15 °C). The diurnal cycle was continued for four months, followed by

151

six months of cold stratification in darkness (4 °C), followed by another four-month period of diurnal

152

cycling. Emerging seedlings were counted and removed once identifiable to species. This method of

153

characterizing the seed bank community effectively accounts for seed viability because non-viable seeds

154

would not have emerged as seedlings.

155
156

Seedling data. Like most perennial grasslands, seedling recruitment in our system is highly dependent

157

on disturbances and occurs only rarely in intact vegetation due to strong competitive effects from adult

158

plants (Silvertown and Smith 1989, Eriksson 1989, Bullock et al. 1995, Vandvik 2004, Berge 2010,

159

Klanderud et al. 2017). We therefore monitored seedlings in experimental gaps where they were

160

relatively free from competitive effects of adult plants, but still exposed to environmental stress and

161

other biotic interactions, such as herbivory, disease, and potential resource competition among

162

seedlings. One 25 x 25 cm gap was created in each of four blocks at each site in spring 2009, for a total

163

of four gaps per site and 48 gaps overall. The gaps were made by cutting along the inner edges of a

164

metal frame mounted in metal pipes marking the corners of the plot, and peeling away the natural

165

vegetation and its thickly interwoven root mat. Seeds and topsoil were returned to gaps by vigorously

166

shaking excavated vegetation and passing it through a 4 mm sieve to remove plant remains. Emerged

167

seedlings in the plots were ID-tagged in one of three censuses (late summer 2009, early summer 2010,

168

late summer 2010) using numbered plastic toothpicks and plot coordinates. About 70 % of seedlings

169

were identifiable to species; the remaining 30 % were unidentifiable or died before they could be

170

identified and were lumped into two generic groups for graminoids and forbs. Seedlings were

171

differentiated from emergent clonal ramets by looking for cotyledons or signs of above- or below-

172

ground connections. Seedling survival and establishment were recorded twice yearly from spring 2010

173

to spring 2012. We approximated seedling emergence rates by dividing the density of emerged

174

seedlings by the sum of seed rain and seed bank densities. We marked seedlings established when they

175

had grown to a size greater than what could be derived exclusively from their maternal subsidies, which

176

we estimated to be when stems were longer than 2 cm, and if a forb, also when they had grown their

177

first non-cotyledonous leaves. Although we took pains to census each site at times of peak seedling

178

emergence, some seedlings may have emerged, died, and disappeared before ever being recorded;

179

even if this where the case, however, we contend that it is unlikely to influence our overall conclusions

180

because the factors discouraging seedling survival during the earliest stages of establishment are likely

181

the same as those discouraging seedling emergence (i.e., late spring frosts), and are distinct from the

182

factors influencing seedling survival establishment (i.e., drought, competition for light, predation, early

183

fall frosts, and late spring frosts in the year after seedling emergence).

185

Mature vegetation data. We surveyed mature vegetation at peak biomass (July and August) in 2009,

186

2011, 2012, and 2013. At each site, we used two 25 x 25 cm plots in each of five blocks at each site, for a

187

total of 10 plots per site (except for the third-wettest second-warmest site, which only had nine plots),

188

and 119 plots overall. These plots were controls for a transplant experiment and included five

189

undisturbed controls and five transplant controls, i.e., turfs dug up and replaced in the same location.

190

The two types of controls did not differ in species composition or any other aspect of community

191

structure at any of the survey periods (Guittar et al. 2016). We visually estimated the percent cover of

192

individual species in each plot using a 5 x 5 cm grid overlay, and then pooled the data by site. To ensure

193

that site vegetation was not undergoing successional changes that could bias our conclusions, we used

194

an NMDS ordination to confirm that site composition did not change substantively between years

195

(Appendix S1: Fig. S1). Stage-specific species abundance data are provided as a supplementary file.

196
197

Trait data. We used four commonly used plant traits, and four traits related to clonal growth strategy,

198

each with hypothesized associations to dispersal ability and/or resource competition. Seed mass (mg), a

199

reflection of species regeneration strategy (Kraft et al. 2008, Cornwell and Ackerly 2009), was drawn

200

from the Seed Information Database (Royal Botanic Gardens Kew 2014). Maximum canopy height (m)

201

data, which relates to both dispersal ability and light competition (Westoby 1998, Falster and Westoby

202

2003), were mined from Lid and Lid (2007). Leaf area (mm2) and specific leaf area (SLA; m2/kg), two

203

traits indicative of where species fall along a continuum of slow-to-fast resource use strategies (Reich et

204

al. 1997, Ackerly and Reich 1999, Reich 2014), were estimated using a combination of field data (Guittar

205

et al. 2016) and data from the LEDA online trait database (Kleyer et al. 2008). Leaf area, SLA, maximum

206

height, and seed mass values were log-transformed. Clonal traits included the number of offspring per

207

parent per year (“0” = 1 offspring; “1” = ≥ 2 offspring), persistence of plant–offspring connections (“0” =

208

< 2 years; “1” = ≥ 2 years), rate of lateral spread (“0” = ≤ 1 cm/year; “1” = > 1 cm/year), and number of

209

buds per ramet (an integer score ranging from “1” = few buds either belowground or aboveground, to

210

“8” = many buds both below and aboveground). Clonal attributes are thought to help plants integrate

211

over spatially heterogeneous resources (Eilts et al. 2011), recover from disturbances (Klimešová and

212

Klimeš 2007), and provide sustained maternal subsidies to new ramets as they grow horizontally and vie

213

for local establishment (Herben and Wildová 2012). Clonal trait data were drawn from Klimeš and

214

Klimešová (1999) and converted from categorical to quantitative formats to enable calculations of

215

community means. Trait data are provided as a supplementary file.

216
217

Assigning local species status. Each species observed at each site at any life stage was labeled as

218

“locally-persistent” if adults were recorded in more than half (i.e., at least three of four) of the site

219

vegetation surveys conducted from 2009 to 2013, or otherwise labeled “locally-transient.” In using this

220

cutoff, we aim to understand the mechanisms leading a species to be a consistent member of a given

221

community, not whether it can occur there at all. That is, an individual of a locally-transient species need

222

not be a first generation immigrant, but could be a second-or-more generation immigrant, so long as it

223

has evidently unable to establish a locally-persistent adult population. Because locally-transient/locally-

224

persistent species status assignments were potentially sensitive to the depth at which we characterized

225

local site community composition, we used rarefaction to verify that we had sufficiently surveyed the

226

mature vegetation such that the number of locally-persistent species observed at each site had

227

stabilized (Appendix S1: Fig. S2). In addition, we re-ran our analysis with all possible locally-

228

transient/locally-persistent cutoffs to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions to our methodology.

229
230

Assigning putative climate origins. For each locally-transient species at each site, we identified the sites

231

and climates where we knew it had persistent adult populations, and then used these to infer whether it

232

was dispersing outside of its realized climate niche. If a locally-transient species at a given site had

10

233

persistent adult populations at other sites with similar temperatures or precipitations, we assumed it

234

dispersed from a site with the “same temperature” or the “same precipitation,” such as from a

235

neighboring site, e.g.., one with similar climate but with potentially different topographical, edaphic, or

236

biotic characteristics. If a locally-transient species at a given site had persistent adult populations only at

237

sites with warmer/cooler or wetter/drier conditions, we then assumed it dispersed from a

238

warmer/cooler or wetter/drier site (i.e., it dispersed into a cooler/warmer or drier/wetter site). Again,

239

we are not assuming that a given seed of a locally-transient species literally dispersed from a given

240

climate, but that the seed is occurring outside of the climate range at which it is a common and

241

persistent community member, and is presumably on the edge of being locally excluded.

242
243

Statistical approach. We used linear regressions to test for baseline trends in the total abundance and

244

richness of locally-transient and locally-persistent species in the seed rain, the seed bank, and the two

245

combined along temperature and precipitation gradients. Unlike other data in this study, seed bank data

246

were not collected in replicate across blocks within a site, thus our analyses were necessarily performed

247

at a site-level resolution (N = 12). Each linear regression model assumes normally distributed errors and

248

takes the form of yj ~ MAPj or yj ~ + MSTj, where yj is the response variable being examined at site j, and

249

MAPj and MSTj are the mean annual precipitation (centered to zero) and mean summer temperature

250

(centered to zero) at site j. We also used linear regressions to test for baseline trends in species richness

251

in the mature vegetation with temperature and precipitation.

252

We used four sets of generalized linear models (GLMs) to test predictors of differential species

253

performance during seedling emergence and seedling establishment. The dependent variable for the

254

seedling emergence GLMs was the number of emerged seedlings of each species at each site (N = ), and

255

the dependent variable for the seedling establishment GLMs was the number of established seedlings of

256

each species at each site. The GLMs used negative binomial error distributions and log link functions.

257

Because each site has a unique combination of temperature and precipitation values (i.e., there is no

258

nestedness), it was not appropriate to include site membership as a random effect while also testing for

259

the effects of climate. When using seed and seedling numbers as predictors of emergence and

260

establishment, respectively, we normalized their highly skewed abundance distributions with Yeo-

261

Johnson transformations, which are similar to Box-Cox transformations but can be used with zeros. The

262

alpha values used for the Yeo-Johnson transformations were those which yielded the most normal

263

distributions, as quantified by Shapiro-Wilk normality tests; specifically, the alpha used to transform

264

seed abundance data was -0.204 and the alpha used to transform emerged seedling data was -0.35.

265

In the first set of GLMs (“null” models), local species abundances in the combined seed rain and

266

seed bank are used to predict local species abundances of emerged seedlings, and local species

267

abundances of emerged seedlings predict local species abundances of established seedlings. In other

268

words, our null expectation was that all seeds were equally likely to emerge, and all seedlings were

269

equally likely to establish. In the second set of GLMs (“site climate” models), we added model terms for

270

local site mean summer temperature and mean annual precipitation to evaluate how these climate

271

variables affected seedling emergence and seedling establishment rates.

272

In the third set of GLMs (“site climate + species status” models), we evaluated how well locally-

273

transient/locally-persistent species status predicted performance differences during seedling emergence

274

and seedling establishment. Specifically, we added model terms specifying the status of each species at

275

each site, and interactions between species status and local climate. We formally modeled the number

276

of emerged seedlings g for species i at site j as

277

gij ~ log(sij + 1) + MAPj + MSTj + pij + (MAPj ∙ pij) + (MSTj ∙ pij),

278

where sij is the abundance of seeds (seed rain + seed bank) of species i at site j, pij is a factor indicating

279

species status, and MAPj and MSTj are as described above. Likewise, we modeled the number of

280

established seedlings e for species i at site j as

281

eij ~ log(gij + 1) + MAPj + MSTj + pij + (MAPj ∙ pij) + (MSTj ∙ pij).

282

In the fourth and final set of GLMs (“site climate + species status + species climate origin”

283

models), we dropped the model term for locally-transient/locally-persistent species status, pij, and

284

replaced it with a new term, oij, denoting the putative temperature/precipitation origins of each locally-

285

transient species i at site j. Specifically, the oij term was used to tag each species at each site with one of

286

five labels: (1) locally-persistent, (2) locally-transient but likely dispersed from an adjacent site with

287

similar temperature/precipitation, (3) locally-transient and likely dispersed from a cooler/drier site (i.e.,

288

into a warmer/wetter site), (4) locally-transient and likely dispersed from a warmer/wetter site (i.e., into

289

a cooler/drier site), (5) locally-transient with no locally-persistent populations at any of our grassland

290

sites (i.e., an ‘unknown’ climate preference). We dropped the interaction terms from these GLMs to

291

avoid excessive model complexity. Formally, we modelled the number of emerged seedlings g for

292

species i at site j as

293
294
295
296

gij ~ log(sij + 1) + MAPj + MSTj + oij,
and the number of established seedlings e for species i at site j as
eij ~ log(gij + 1) + MAPj + MSTj + oij.
Finally, we asked if systematic differences in the traits of locally-transient and locally-persistent

297

species at each site offered mechanistic explanations for performance differences between groups. To

298

do this, we averaged the trait values of all species (not weighted by their relative abundances) in the

299

combined seed rain and seed bank at each site, grouped by local-transient/locally-persistent species

300

status. We used paired t-tests, paired by site, to identify which traits, if any, differed consistently

301

between locally-transient and locally-persistent species across all sites. For any traits with significant

302

overall differences, we performed linear regressions to see whether the magnitude of trait-based

303

differences between locally-transient and locally-persistent species trended with site temperature or

304

precipitation. We did not test for trait-based differences by species status in seedling communities

305

because the number of locally-transient species was too low to provide any confidence in calculations of

306

within-site trait means (only 4 ± 3 locally-transient species occurred on average as emerged seedlings at

307

each site; Appendix S1: Table S1). All scripts in this study were written in R and are available at

RESULTS

311

Mature vegetation rarefactions. Rarefaction analysis indicated that the numbers of plots of mature

312

vegetation surveyed at each site were more than sufficient to stabilize the local composition of locally-

313

persistent species (Appendix S1: Fig. S2), lending confidence to our locally-transient/locally-persistent

314

species status assignments. Furthermore, no locally-transient species by itself ever represented more

315

than 0.4% of total cover at any site (Appendix S1: Fig. S3), illustrating the minor overall contribution of

316

locally-transient species to local community structure.

317
318

Evidence for local filtering. Seeds of locally-transient species occurred at all 12 of our grassland sites,

319

representing, on average, 4 of 42 species in the combined seed rain and seed bank. In the combined

320

seed rain and seed bank, the number of locally-transient species and their total abundances increased

321

significantly with temperature (Fig. 2; species richness: p = 0.045, R2 = 0.34; total abundance: p = 0.016,

322

R2 = 0.46). These trends were driven primarily by increases of local-transients in the seed bank (species

323

richness: p = 0.031, R2 = 0.39; total abundance p = 0.035, R2 = 0.37), not the seed rain (Appendix S1: Fig.

324

S4), underscoring the fact that the composition of the seed rain likely differs between years, and that

325

the seed bank likely serves as an important reservoir of local plant diversity. There were no significant

326

trends in species richness or total abundance with precipitation in either the seed rain, the seed bank, or

327

the two combined. Species richness in the adult vegetation rose significantly with temperature (p =

328

0.0063, R2 = 0.54) but not with precipitation (p = 0.871).

329

About 10% of all seeds were from locally-transient species, with more transients represented in

330

the seed bank (ca. 13% of total seed bank) than in the seed rain (ca. 4% of total seed rain) (Appendix S1:

331

Table S2). While most locally-transient populations had locally-persistent adult populations at sites with

332

similar climates, some did not (Appendix S1: Table S2). Operating on the assumption that locally-

333

transient species dispersed from the most-climatically similar sites at which they persist as adults, seeds

334

of locally-transient species were about four times more likely to have dispersed outside of their realized

335

climate niches into warmer sites (i.e., from cooler climates) and slightly more likely to have dispersed

336

outside of their realized climate niches into drier sites (i.e., from wetter climates) (Appendix S1: Table

337

S2).

338

To determine how sensitive our conclusions were to changes in our operational definition of

339

locally-transient/locally-persistent species status, we explored how results changed under each of the

340

four possible cutoff scenarios offered by our data. Specifically, we looked at how results changed as the

341

definition of locally-persistent species shifted from those species present in at least one, at least two, at

342

least three, or all four annual surveys of mature vegetation at each given site. As the cutoff for locally-

343

persistent became more stringent, and the cutoff for locally-transient (by definition) relaxed, the total

344

number of locally-transient populations (i.e., unique species*site combinations) in the combined seed

345

rain and seed bank at our sites rose from 119 (1989 seeds), to 149 (2549 seeds), to 167 (3665 seeds), to

346

205 (5007 seeds). However, these differences in the estimated numbers of locally-transient/locally-

347

persistent species by site did not alter our main conclusions that (1) the influence of local filtering

348

increases with temperature, and that (2) grassland sites in southern Norway are connected by dispersal,

349

albeit primarily among nearby sites with similar climates.

The stage-wise removal of locally-transient species. Locally-transient species were outperformed by

352

locally-persistent species during seedling emergence (Fig. 3, Table 1), but not seedling establishment

353

(Fig. 3, Appendix S1: Table S3). The lower emergence rates of locally-transient species appeared to be

354

driven primarily by species which had putatively dispersed outside of their realized climate niches into

355

cooler climates, drier climates, or those that had dispersed from unknown climates (see “Origin-based

356

predictors” in Table 1). In addition, after accounting for local seed abundances, warmer sites tended to

357

have higher rates of seedling emergence than cooler sites (“General predictors” in Table 1), linking

358

climate and overall seedling performance. No GLM of seedling establishment outperformed null

359

expectations (Appendix S1: Table S3), suggesting that neither climate, species status, nor putative seed

360

origins were meaningful predictors of seedling establishment rates.

361

To confirm that these results were not artifacts of how we combined seed rain and seed bank

362

data (e.g., if seeds of locally-transient species emerged at lower rates because most were from the seed

363

bank, and the seed bank had overall lower rates of emergence), we re-ran GLMs with only seed rain

364

data and observed qualitatively similar results (data not shown). To determine how sensitive our

365

conclusions involving seedling performance were to changes in the operational definition of locally-

366

transient/locally-persistent species status, we re-ran the GLMs for emergence and establishment using

367

each of the four possible locally-transient/locally-persistent cutoff scenarios offered by our data.

368

Changes to the locally-transient/locally-persistent cutoff did not alter our overall conclusion that locally-

369

transient species are disfavored during emergence but not establishment (Appendix S1: Fig. S5).

370
371

Trait-based mechanisms of local filtering. Locally-transient and locally-persistent species in the

372

combined seed rain and seed bank differed significantly in three functional traits (Fig. 4). Specifically,

373

when averaged across species at the site level, locally-transient species were significantly shorter, had

374

smaller seeds, and had longer-lasting vegetative connections among ramets than locally-persistent

375

species. Of the three traits that differed consistently between locally-transient and locally-persistent

376

species, the only instance where those differences varied significantly with site climate was an increase

377

in the magnitude by which locally-transient species had longer-lasting connections than locally-

378

persistent species with increasing site temperature.

DISCUSSION

381

In this study, we compared the compositions of seed, seedling, and adult plant communities along

382

temperature and precipitation gradients to shed light on how seed dispersal and local filtering processes

383

interactively generate and maintain patterns of community composition at the landscape scale. Overall,

384

our results point to four main conclusions: (1) the influence of local filtering on community membership

385

increases with temperature, (2) local filtering is stronger during seedling emergence than during

386

seedling establishment, (3) climate-based niche differences drive differential performance among

387

species, especially for seeds dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into colder and drier

388

climates (i.e., dispersing from warmer and wetter climates), and (4) locally-transient species have traits

389

which may make them better dispersers (smaller seeds) but poorer competitors for light (shorter

390

statures, less persistent clonal connections), which helps explain their arrival to new sites but

391

subsequent failure to establish persistent adult populations. We elaborate on these conclusions below,

392

and end with a discussion of what our results mean for how these alpine grasslands will likely respond to

393

climate change.

394
395

Community assembly and the determinants of species ranges

396

Community membership and the potential for compositional change over time are significantly

397

influenced by the set of seeds dispersing, or not dispersing, to a given site. We found relatively few

398

species to be dispersing outside of their realized climate niches, highlighting the potentially important

399

role that dispersal limitation plays in determining community composition, at least on shorter time

400

scales. At the same time, the few species that successfully dispersed outside of their realized climate

401

niches were the ones most strongly disfavored by local filtering processes (Table 1), highlighting the

402

important role that local filtering also plays in determining community composition in our system. In

403

other words, our results explicitly show how dispersal dynamics and local filtering interactively influence

404

community assembly.

405

Within the overall result of local filtering (Table 1), we observed a significant increase in the

406

fraction of the seed community that was locally-transient from the coldest (highest altitude) to warmest

407

(lowest altitude) sites (Fig. 2), suggesting that the influence of local filtering on community membership

408

increases with temperature. Such a trend with temperature could arise for at least three non-exclusive

409

reasons. First, warm-adapted species could have spatially larger seed dispersal shadows than cold-

410

adapted species, resulting in more seeds traveling to unsuitable patches, such as those with undesirable

411

topographic, edaphic, or biotic conditions. Factors affecting seed dispersal distances include wind speed

412

and plant height (Thomson et al. 2011), although neither are likely to be important in our experimental

413

system: the colder, alpine sites are consistently windier than the warmer, lowland sites, due to their

414

more exposed topography and less protective tree-cover, and the variation in mean maximum height

415

among our sites is minor (< 30 cm) (Guittar et al. 2016) compared to the differences in plant height

416

known to affect dispersal distance (Thomson et al. 2011). A second explanation for the putative increase

417

in the strength of filtering with temperature could be that seeds are simply more likely to disperse

418

downhill (i.e., from colder high-altitude sites to warmer low-altitude sites) than the reverse, again

419

leading to more seeds arriving at unsuitably warm patches than unsuitably cold patches. A third

420

explanation could be that competition for resources is fiercer at warmer temperatures, resulting in more

421

local extirpations in the adult plant communities at warmer sites, although, importantly, this explanation

422

presumes that similar numbers of seeds and species are dispersing to all sites, which may not be the

423

case. Nonetheless, there is support such an explanation: competition for light is hypothesized to be

424

stronger at warmer sites due to higher productivity, more developed soils, and overall less stressful

425

growth conditions (Grime 1973, Olsen et al. 2016). In our study, species richness fell steeply with

426

temperature in the adult vegetation (from an average of 42 species at the warmest sites to 64 species at

427

the coldest sites), but only slightly in the seed rain and not in the seed bank (Fig. 2), consistent with a

428

scenario in which similar numbers of species arrived to all sites, but more species were competitively

429

excluded by adulthood at warmer sites.

430

Surprisingly, locally-transient species were significantly disfavored during seedling emergence

431

(Fig. 3, Table 1), but not during seedling establishment (Fig. 3, Appendix S1: Table S3), suggesting that

432

germination and very early survival is a more important determinant of seedling success than successful

433

establishment in our system. This result contradicts conventional expectations of weak filtering during

434

seedling emergence but strong filtering during seedling establishment (Moles and Westoby 2004).

435

Differential germination rates among species could be driven by species preferences for soil (Evans and

436

Etherington 1990, Benvenuti 2003) or climate conditions. It should be noted that while some individuals

437

could have been filtered out after meeting our operational definition of establishment (i.e., had stems at

438

least 2 cm long and, if a forb, also had non-cotyledonous leaves), but before becoming reproductively

439

active (i.e., before establishment sensu stricto), this does not appear to be the case. Across sites, the

440

mean proportion of species that were locally-transient among established seedlings was only slightly

441

higher than that found in the adult vegetation data (~14.6 % vs. ~13.6 %, respectively), indicating that

442

any locally-transient species which successfully emerged were essentially just as likely as locally-

443

persistent species to survive long enough to be captured by our mature vegetation surveys, but not long

444

enough to be considered locally-persistent. In other words, locally-transient species evidently failed to

445

persist as adults not because they failed to establish, but either because they failed to germinate or

446

because they failed to compete as post-establishment juveniles, resulting in local population growth

447

rates below maintenance levels.

448

The low emergence rates among locally-transient species were largely driven by seeds that had

449

putatively dispersed outside their realized climate niches into cooler climates (i.e., from warmer

450

climates), into drier climates (i.e., from wetter climates), and those from unknown climates (Table 1),

451

illustrating how climate-based niche preferences can influence community membership and thus range

452

expansion. Climate is known to play a pivotal role in the release of seed dormancy in plants (Probert

453

2000), and variation in germination timing is known to occur even among populations of the same

454

species at different climates (Shimono and Kudo 2003, Bischoff et al. 2006, Spindelböck et al. 2013). If

455

the seeds of locally-transient species dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into colder

456

and/or drier climates were predisposed to emerging before spring is safely underway, this could explain

457

their particularly low emergence rates. A second, complementary explanation could be that seeds

458

dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into colder and/or drier climates simply find these

459

conditions more stressful and are thus less likely (i.e., not adapted) to successfully emerge as seedlings.

460

Locally-transient species differed consistently from locally-persistent species in their functional

461

traits, offering some mechanistic hypotheses for why they can disperse into new sites but fail to persist

462

as adults (Fig. 4). First, locally-transient species had consistently smaller seeds than locally-persistent

463

species, which is thought to increase dispersal distance (Greene and Johnson 1993, Westoby 1998), and

464

may also decrease performance upon arrival due to their smaller maternal subsidies (Moles and

465

Westoby 2006). Second, locally-transient species were shorter and had less long-lasting ramet-ramet

466

connections, on average, than locally-persistent species, suggesting that the ability to grow both

467

vertically and exchange resources horizontally confer important advantages for long-term survival in

468

mature vegetation. Maximum potential height and the capacity for clonal growth are associated with

469

the ability to compete for light (Falster and Westoby 2003) and soil resources in spatially heterogenous

470

systems (Oborny and Kun 2003, Eilts et al. 2011), respectively, and can work synergistically to confer

471

competitive ability in herbaceous communities (Gough et al. 2012). These two traits were significantly

472

associated with competitive ability in a turf transplant experiment in the same system (Guittar et al.

473

2016), offering additional support for the importance of architectural traits in driving grassland species

474

performance. Equally noteworthy were the generally weak correlations between locally-transient and

475

locally-persistent species in the remaining functional traits. The weak correlations in these traits does

476

not imply that they have no influence on the selective removal of locally-transient species, but that their

477

potential influence is not consistent or predictable across sites in the region.

478

The trait-based differences between locally-transient species and locally-persistent species align

479

with a general tradeoff between colonization and competitive ability (Levins and Culver 1971, Tilman

480

1994, Amarasekare and Nisbet 2001, Yu and Wilson 2001), and thus suggest that such a tradeoff, when

481

combined with sufficient levels of disturbance, is an important driver of succession and community

482

assembly dynamics. That is, the smaller seeds of locally-transient species may promote their probability

483

of arriving to fresh openings in the canopy, while their lower statures and decreased capacity for clonal

484

growth may decrease their chances of establishing locally-persistent populations. While our trait-based

485

analysis offers no obvious mechanistic explanation for why locally-transient species were disfavored

486

during seedling emergence, the trait-based differences may correlate with unmeasured traits that do

487

influence species performance during seedling emergence, and thus may serve as important proxies.

488
489

Implications for community responses to climate and climate change.

490

Community response to climate change will depend both on species’ abilities to track environmental

491

changes via dispersal, and on niche-based performance differences among species in different

492

environments (Graae et al. 2017). Southern Norway is expected to grow warmer and wetter as climate

493

change progresses (Hanssen-Bauer et al. 2009), so species will have to disperse into cooler (upslope) and

494

drier (more inland) sites to maintain their current climate conditions. However, of the 122 species with

495

persistent adult populations at one or more of our sites, only 10 species (representing 0.3 % of total

21

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/567586; this version posted August 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

496

seeds) dispersed outside of their realized climate niches into cooler sites, and 13 species (representing

497

1.9 % of total seeds) into drier sites (Appendix S1: Fig. S4, Appendix S1: Table S2), suggesting that many

498

if not most species will likely be unable to rapidly shift their populations into cooler and drier climates,

499

and are at risk of being extirpated as competitively-superior species arrive to their communities

500

(Alexander et al. 2015). Yet, our finding that immigrant seeds from other climates were strongly

501

disfavored provides a potential silver lining: if a species can disperse into a site with a newly suitable

502

climate, it should be strongly favored over local residents, and thus be able to quickly establish a locally-

503

persistent population. Overall, our results underscore the dynamic way in which communities will likely

504

respond to climate change, and emphasize the need for further work on how species will vary in their

505

ability to disperse and compete in different community contexts.

Figure 1. Climates (a) and locations (b and c) of the twelve field sites in southern Norway. Mean summer

648

temperature is defined as the warmest four months at each site. Grayscale shading in c reflects altitude,

which covaries closely with mean summer temperature.

Figure 2. Seed density (a) and species richness (b) in the combined seed rain and seed bank, grouped by

652

locally-transient/locally-persistent species status and plotted by mean summer temperature. Summer is

653

defined as the four warmest months at each site. Solid lines are present when temperature was a

654

significant predictor (p < 0.05) of log10-transformed seed density or species richness in a linear

655

regression. A parallel set of regressions was performed using mean annual precipitation as the sole

656

predictor, but no trends were even marginally significant (p-values always > 0.1).

Specifically, numbers of emerged seedlings of each species at each site are plotted by their

660

corresponding number of seeds at each site (a), and numbers of established seedlings of each species at

661

each site are plotted by their corresponding number of emerged seedlings at each site (b). As such, each

662

circle represents the presence/absence of one species at one site, and colored lines and shadings show

663

LOESS smoothing functions and 95 % confidence intervals. Seed abundances equal the total number of

664

seeds in the seed rain and seed bank. Seedling abundances equal the total number of individuals in four

665

25 x 25 cm subplots at each site. Count data are increased by one to allow for plotting zeroes on a log

666

scale. Panels only show data falling within the observed window of locally-transient seed abundances (<

667

400 seeds) and locally-transient seedling abundances (< 33 seedlings) in order to focus on the

668

comparison of locally-transient and locally-persistent species.

673

(triangle), 9 °C (circle), and 10.5 °C (inverted triangle) and annual precipitations of 650 mm, 1300 mm,

674

2000 mm, and 2900 mm, from light blue to dark blue. Shapes are filled with color only when values

675

differ significantly between locally-transient and locally-persistent species across all sites (paired t-test;

676

p < 0.05). SLA: specific leaf area. Bud number is an integer score that ranges from 1 (few buds either

677

belowground or aboveground) to 8 (many buds both below and aboveground); percent lateral spread

678

refers to the proportion of species with rates of lateral spread greater than 1 cm/year; percent offspring

679

refers to the proportion of species that commonly produce two or more vegetative offshoots per parent

680

per year; percent connection persistence refers to the proportion of species with inter-ramet

681

connections that persist for two or more years.
