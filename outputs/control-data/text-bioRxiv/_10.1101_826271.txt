Abstract

iLINCS (http://ilincs.org) is an integrative web‐based platform for analysis of omics data and
signatures of cellular perturbations. The portal facilitates analysis of user‐submitted omics
signatures of diseases and cellular perturbations in the context of a large compendium of pre‐
computed signatures (>200,000), as well as mining and re‐analysis of the large collection of omics
datasets (>10,000), pre‐computed signatures and their connections. Analytics workflows driven
by user‐friendly interfaces enable users with only conceptual understanding of the analysis
strategy to execute sophisticated analyses of omics signatures, such as systems biology analysis
and interpretation of signatures, mechanism of action analysis and signature‐driven drug re‐
positioning. iLINCS workflows integrate a range of analytics and interactive visualization tools
into a comprehensive platform for analysis of omics signatures. There are only few platforms that
integrate multiple omics data types, bioinformatics tools, and interfaces for integrative analyses
and visualization that do not require any computer programming skills. Among them, iLINCS is
unique in terms of the scope and versatility of the data it provides and the analytics it facilitates.

Background

Transcriptomics and proteomics (omics) signatures in response to cellular perturbations
consist of changes in gene or protein expression levels after the perturbation. An omics signature
is a high‐dimensional readout of cellular state change that provides information about the
biological processes affected by the perturbation which underlie the post‐perturbation
phenotype of the cell. The signature in itself also provides information, although not always
directly discernable, about the molecular mechanisms by which the perturbation causes
observed changes. If we consider a disease to be a perturbation of the homeostatic biological
system under normal physiology, then the omics signature of a disease are the differences in
gene/protein expression levels between disease and non‐diseased tissue samples.
The low cost and effectiveness of transcriptomics assays1‐4 resulted in abundance of
transcriptomics datasets and signatures. Beside transcriptomics, recent advances in high
throughput proteomics made generation of large numbers of proteomics signatures a reality5,6.
Several recent efforts were directed at systematic generation of omics signatures of cellular
perturbations7 and generating libraries of signatures by re‐analyzing public domain omics
datasets8,9. The recently released library of integrated network‐based cellular signatures (LINCS)7
L1000 dataset generated transcriptomic signatures at unprecedented scale2. The availability of
resulting libraries of signatures open exciting new avenues for learning about the mechanisms of
diseases and the search for effective therapeutics10.
The analysis and interpretation of transcriptomic signatures has been intensely researched.
Numerous methods and tools have been developed for identifying changes in molecular
phenotypes implicated by transcriptional signatures based on gene set enrichment, pathway and
network analyses approaches11‐13. Matching directly transcriptional signatures of a disease with
negatively correlated transcriptional signatures of chemical perturbations (CP) underlies the
Connectivity Map (CMap) approach to identifying potential drug candidates10,14,15. Similarly,

correlating signatures of chemical perturbagens with genetic perturbations of specific genes has
been used to identify putative targets of drugs and other chemical perturbagens 2.
To fully exploit the information contained within omics signature libraries and within countless
omics signatures generated every day by investigators around the world, new user‐friendly
integrative tools are needed that bring this data together, and are accessible to a large segment

of precomputed signatures, formatted datasets, connections between signatures, and integrates
them with a bioinformatics analysis engine into a coherent system for omics signature analysis.
Results

iLINCS (available http://ilincs.org) is an integrative user‐friendly web platform for the analysis
of omics (transcriptomic and proteomic) datasets and signatures of cellular perturbations. The
key components of iLINCS are: Interactive and interconnected analytical workflows for creation
and analysis of omics signatures; The large collection of datasets, pre‐computed signatures and
their connections; and User‐friendly graphical user interfaces for executing analytical tasks and
workflows. The central concept in iLINCS is the omics signature which can be retrieved from the
pre‐computed signature libraries within the iLINCS database, submitted by the user, or
constructed using one of the iLINCS datasets (Fig 1A). The signatures in iLINCS consist of
differential gene or protein expression levels and associated p‐values between perturbed and
baseline samples for all, or any subset of measured genes/proteins. User submitted signatures
can also be in the form of a list of genes/proteins, or a list of up‐ and down‐regulated
genes/proteins. Analytical workflows facilitate systems biology interpretation of the signature
(Fig 1B) and the connectivity analysis of the signature with all iLINCS pre‐computed signatures
(Fig 1C). Connected signatures can further be analyzed in terms of the patterns of gene/protein
expression level changes that underlie the connectivity with the query signature, or through the
analysis of gene/protein targets of connected perturbagens (Fig 1D). Ultimately, the multi‐
layered systems biology analyses, and the connectivity analyses lead to biological insights, and
identification of therapeutic targets and putative therapeutic agents (Fig 1E). Below we provide
an overview of the key data and analytic components of iLINCS, and then we present three use
cases to demonstrate iLINCS’ capacity to generate impactful results.
Interconnected workflows for constructing and analyzing omics signatures
Interactive analytical workflows in iLINCS facilitate signature construction through differential
expression analysis as well as clustering, dimensionality reduction, functional enrichment,
signature connectivity analysis, pathway and network analysis, and integrative interactive
visualization. Visualizations include interactive scatter plots, volcano and GSEA plots, heatmaps,
and pathway and network node and stick diagram (Supplemental Figure 1). Users can download
raw data and signatures, analysis results and publication‐ready graphics. iLINCS internal analysis
and visualization engine uses R 16, Bioconductor packages17, the Shiny framework18, interactive
graphics created with ggplot 19and plotly 20, and integration of open‐source visualization tools
such as FTreeView21 and Morpheous 22. iLINCS also facilitates seamless integration with a wide
range of task‐specific online bioinformatics and systems biology tools and resources including
Enrichr23, DAVID24, ToppGene25, Reactome26, KEGG27, GeneMania28, X2K Web29, L1000FWD30,
STITCH31, Clustergrammer32, piNET33, LINCS Data Portal34, ScrubChem35, PubChem36, GEO37,
ArrayExpress38 and GREIN39. Programmatic access to iLINCS data, workflows and visualizations
are facilitated by embedding the calls to iLINCS API which are documented with the Swagger
community standard. Examples of utilizing the iLINCS API within data analysis scripts are provided
on GitHub (https://github.com/uc‐bd2k/ilincsAPI). The iLINCS software architecture is described
in Supplemental Figure 2.

Use case 1: Identifying chemical perturbagens emulating genetic perturbation of the MTOR
gene
Aberrant activation of mTOR signaling underlies multiple human diseases and numerous
efforts in designing drugs that modulate activity of MTOR signaling are under way44. Here we use
the signature of genetic perturbation (via CRISPR knock‐down) of the MTOR genes to identify
chemical perturbagens mimicking the perturbation of the MTOR genes. First, we search through
iLINCS libraries for Consensus Genes Signatures (CGSes) of MTOR knock‐down and use the CRISPR
CGS in MCF‐7 cell line as the query signature. The connectivity analysis identifies 258 LINCS CGSes
and 831 CP Signatures with statistically significant correlation with the query signature. Top 100
most connected CGSes are dominated by the signatures of genetic perturbations of MTOR and
PIK3CA genes (Fig 2A), whereas all top 5 most frequent inhibition targets of CPs among top 100
most connected CP signatures are MTOR and PIK3 proteins (Fig 2B). Results clearly indicate that
the query MTOR CGS is highly specific and sensitive to perturbation of the mTOR pathway and
effectively identifies chemical perturbagens capable of inhibiting mTOR signaling. The full list of
connected signatures is shown in Supplemental Table ST1. The connected CP signatures also
include several chemical perturbagens with highly connected signatures that have not been
known to target mTOR signaling providing additional candidate inhibitors. Step by step
instructions for performing this analysis in iLINCS are provided in Supplemental Workflow SW1.
Use case 2: Mechanism of action analysis via connection to genetic perturbation signatures
Identifying small molecules (i.e. chemical perturbagens) that can modulate activity disease‐
related proteins or pathways is the cornerstone of intelligent drug design. Transcriptional
signature of the chemical perturbagens often carry only an echo of such effects since the proteins
directly targeted by the chemical and associated signaling proteins are not transcriptionally
changed. iLINCS offers the solution for this problem by connecting the CP signatures to LINCS
CGSes and follow‐up systems biology analysis of genes whose CGSes are highly correlated with
the CP signature. This is demonstrated by the analysis of one of the CP signatures of the 24 hour,
0.04µM treatment of the MCF‐7 cell line with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Fig 2CDE).
Traditional pathway enrichment analysis of the transcriptional signature via iLINCS connection to
Enrichr (Fig 2C) fails to identify the mTOR pathway as being affected. In the next step, we first
connect the CP signature to LINCS CGSes and then perform pathway enrichment analysis of genes
with correlated CGSes. This analysis correctly identifies mTOR signaling pathway as the top most
affected pathway (Fig 2D). Similarly, connectivity analysis with other CP signatures followed by
the enrichment analysis of protein targets of top 100 most connected CPs again identifies the
Pi3k‐Akt signaling pathway as one of the most enriched (Fig 2E). In conclusion, both pathway
analysis of differentially expressed genes in the everolimus signature and pathway analysis of
connected genetic and chemical perturbagens provide us with important information about
effects of everolimus. However, only the analyses of connected perturbagens correctly pinpoints
the direct mechanism of action of the everolimus which is the inhibition of mTOR signaling. Step
by step instructions for performing this analysis in iLINCS are provided in Supplemental Workflow
SW2.
Use case 3: Proteo‐genomics analysis of cancer driver events in breast cancer

We analyzed TCGA breast cancer RNA‐seq and RPPA data using the iLINCS “Datasets”
workflow to construct the differential gene and protein expression signatures contrasting
Luminal A and Her2 enriched (Her2E) breast tumors45. The protein expression signature
immediately implicated known driver events distinguishing the two subtypes, the Luminal A
cancers being driven by abnormal activity of the estrogen receptor and the Her2E tumors driven
by abnormally high activity of the Her2 protein (Fig 3A). In addition to expected proteins, the
increased level of phosphorylated EIF4EBP1 protein may indicate increased level of MTOR
signaling in Her2E tumors.
The corresponding RNA‐seq signature showed similar patterns of expression of key genes (Fig
3B). All genes were differentially expressed (Bonferroni adjusted p‐value<0.01) except for EGFR,
indicating that the difference in levels of post‐translationally activated (phosphorylated) versions
of the proteins came from activation of upstream kinases instead of overall increase in
gene/protein expression. Analysis of 665 most significantly upregulated genes in Her2E tumors

(p‐value<1e‐10) identified cell cycle related KEGG pathways (Cell cycle, p‐value=1.3e‐26; DNA
replication, p‐value=1.4e‐13) to be the most significantly enriched according to the Enrichr
combined scores (See Supplemental Table ST2 for all results), implicating known increased
proliferation of Her2E tumors in comparison to Luminal A tumors46. The connectivity analysis of
the RNA‐seq signature with LINCS CP signatures shows that treating several different cancer cell
lines with inhibitors of PI3K, mTOR, CDK (Fig 3C) and inhibitors of some other more generic
proliferation targets (eg. TOP21, AURKA) (see Supplemental Table ST3 for complete results)
produces signatures that are positively correlated with RNA‐seq Luminal A vs Her2E signature,
indicating that such treatments are pushing cancer cell lines toward greater phenotypic similarity
with Luminal A tumors.
Group analysis of connected CP signatures (Fig 3C) indicates that results of connectivity
analysis may be largely driven by the inhibition of proliferation as evidenced by enrichment of
down‐regulated genes by cell cycle genes and up‐regulated genes by apoptosis related genes in
connected signatures. However, the dominance of PI3K and mTOR inhibitor signatures (Fig 3D)
indicates that the connections may to some extent also be driven by more specific targeting of
PI3K‐mTOR signaling which may be more active in Her2E cancers as indicated by increased levels
of the phosphorylated EIF4EBP1 protein.
High positive connectivity to Cancer Therapeutic Response Signatures47 of two PI3K inhibitors
in breast cancer cell lines also indicates that Her2E cancers may be more sensitive to mTOR
inhibition (Supplemental Table ST3). Connectivity analysis with ENCODE transcription factor
targets signatures recapitulated known biology (negative association with E2F4 binding
signatures implicating higher proliferation of Her2E tumors and positive associations with
ERaplha binding signatures implicating the increase ERalpha activity in Luminal A tumors)
(Supplemental Table ST3). Most connected signatures in analysis of Disease related signatures42
extracted from GEO data and EBI Expression Atlas8 signatures were all related to comparisons of
different breast cancers samples (Supplemental Table ST3). Step by step instructions for
performing this analysis in iLINCS are provided in Supplemental Workflow SW3.
Other use cases: The three interconnected iLINCS workflows (Signatures, Datasets, Genes),
facilitate a wide range of possible use cases. The three detailed cases above all use either pre‐
computed iLINCS signatures, or iLINCS omics datasets to construct signatures. Querying iLINCS
with user submitted external signatures, genes and gene lists allows identification of connected
perturbations and signatures. It also allows users to answer more specific questions about
expression patterns of genes or gene lists of interest in specific datasets or across a class of
cellular perturbations. For example, a query with a specific gene of interest can identify sets of
perturbations that significantly affect the expression of the gene and thus offering a set of
chemicals, or genetic perturbations that can be used to modulate the activity of the
corresponding protein. A query with a list of genes whose coordinated expression is known to be
a hallmark of a specific biological state or process48 can identify a set of perturbations that can
accordingly modify cell phenotype. Additional use cases have also been illustrated in several
published scientific studies utilizing iLINCS: identification of putative therapeutic agents for
schizophrenia49,50, developing new strategies for ERα degradation in breast cancers51, inhibiting
the protective effects of stromal cells against chemotherapy in breast cancer52 and rational drug
combination design to inhibit epithelial‐mesenchymal transition53.

Discussion

iLINCS is a unique integrated platform for analysis of omics signatures. The three use cases
described here only scratch the surface of the wide range of possible analyses facilitated by the
interconnected analytical workflows and the large collections of omics datasets, signatures and
their connections. These cases also feature only a small subset of all analytical tools integrated
within the iLINCS platform. The user interfaces are streamlined and strive to be self‐explanatory
to the majority of scientists with conceptual understanding of omics data analysis. All analyses
presented here were performed by typing the initial queries and then using the mouse to
navigate user interfaces without ever having to copy and/or re‐submit any portions of the data
and results to a separate analytical tool. iLINCS implements the complete systematic
polypharmacology and drug repurposing 54 workflow, and provides new innovative workflows for
harnessing the full potential of LINCS omics signatures.
In addition to facilitating standard analyses, iLINCS also implements innovative workflows for
biological interpretation of omics signatures via connectivity analysis. For example, in use case 2
we show how connectivity analysis coupled with pathway and gene set enrichment analysis can
implicate mechanism of action of a chemical perturbagen when standard enrichment analysis
applied to the differentially expressed genes fails to recover targeted signaling pathways. In a
similar vein, iLINCS has been successfully used to identify putative therapeutic agents by
connecting changes in proteomics profiles in neurons from patients with schizophrenia first with
the LINCS CGSes of the corresponding genes, and then with LINCS CP signatures49,50. These
analyses led to identification of PPAR agonists as promising therapeutic agents capable of
reversing bioenergetic signature of schizophrenia, which were subsequently shown to modulate
behavioral phenotypes in rat model of schizophrenia49.
Several online tools have been developed for the analysis and mining LINCS L1000 signature
libraries. They facilitate online queries of L1000 signatures55,56 and construction of scripted
pipelines for in‐depth analysis of transcriptomics data and signatures57. The LINCS Transcriptomic
Center at the Broad Institute developed the clue.io query tool deployed by the Broad Connectivity
Map team which facilitates connectivity analysis of user submitted signatures2. iLINCS replicates
the connectivity analysis functionality of clue.io, and indeed, the equivalent queries of the two
systems may return qualitatively similar results (see Supplemental Results for a use case
comparison). However, the scope of iLINCS is much broader. It provides connectivity analysis with
signatures beyond Connectivity Map datasets and provides a very large number of primary omics
datasets for users to construct their own signatures. Furthermore, analytical workflows in iLINCS
facilitate deep systems biology analysis and knowledge discovery of both omics signatures and
the genes and protein targets identified through connectivity analysis.
iLINCS removes technical roadblocks for users without programming background to re‐use a
large fraction of publicly available omics datasets and signatures. Furthermore, all analyses steps
behind the iLINCS UI’s are driven by API which themselves can and have been already used within
computational pipelines based on scripting languages58, such as R, Python and JavaScript, or to
power functionality of other web analysis tools33,59. This makes iLINCS a natural tool for analysis
and interpretation of omics signatures for scientists preferring point‐and‐click GUIs as well as
data scientists using scripted analytical pipelines.

Methods

Perturbation signatures
All pre‐computed perturbation signatures in iLINCS, as well as signatures created using an
iLINCS dataset, consist of two vectors: the vector of log‐scale differential expressions between
the perturbed samples and baseline samples, and the vector of associated p‐values. Signatures
submitted by the user can also consist of only log‐scale differential expressions without p‐values,
list of up‐ and down‐regulated genes and single list of genes.
Signature connectivity analysis
Depending on the exact type of the query signature, the connectivity analysis with libraries of
pre‐computed iLINCS signature are computed using different connectivity metric.
If the query signature is selected from iLINCS libraries of pre‐computed signatures, the
connectivity with all other iLINCS signatures is pre‐computed using the extreme Pearson’s
correlation60,61 signed significances of all genes, where the signed significance of a gene is equal
to ‐log10(p‐value) multiplied by the sign of the log‐differential expression. If the number of
overlapping genes between significance vectors of two signatures is less than 2,500, 100
overlapping genes with most positive and 100 with most negative significance value are used for
the extreme Pearson’s correlations.
If the query signature is created from an iLINCS dataset, or directly uploaded by the user, the
connectivity with all iLINCS signatures is calculated as the weighted correlation between the two
vectors of log‐differential expressions and the vector of weights equal to [‐log10(p‐value of the
query) ‐ log10(p‐value of the iLINCS signature)]62. When the user‐uploaded signature consists of
only log differential expression levels without p‐values, the weight for the correlation is based
only on the p‐values of the iLINCS signatures [‐log10(p‐values of the iLINCS signatures)].
If the query signature uploaded by the user consists of the lists of up‐ and down‐regulated
genes connectivity is calculated by assigning ‐1 to down‐regulated and +1 upregulated genes and
calculating Pearson’s correlation between such vector and iLINCS signatures. The calculated
statistical significance of the correlation in this case is equivalent to the t‐test for the difference
between differential expression measures of iLINCS signatures between up‐ and down‐regulated
genes.
If the query signature is uploaded by the user in a form of a gene list, the connectivity with
iLINCS signatures is calculated as the enrichment of highly significant differential expression
levels in iLINCS signature within the submitted gene list using the Random Set analysis63.
Perturbagen connectivity analysis
The connectivity between a query signature and a “perturbagen” is established using the
enrichment analysis of individual connectivity scores between the query signature and set of all
L1000 signatures of the perturbagen (for all cell lines, time points and concentrations). The
analysis establishes whether the connectivity scores as a set are “unusually” high based on the
Random Set analysis63.

LINCS L1000 signature libraries (Consensus gene knockdown signatures (CGS), Overexpression
gene signatures and Chemical perturbation signatures) : For all LINCS L1000 signature libraries,
the signatures are constructed by combining the Level 4, population control signature replicates
from two released GEO datasets (GSE92742 and GSE70138) into the Level 5 moderated Z scores
(MODZ) by calculating weighted averages as described in the primary publication for the L1000
Connectivity Map dataset2. Only signatures showing evidence of being reproducible by having
the 75th quantile of pairwise spearman correlations of level 4 replicates (Broad institute
distil_cc_q75 quality control metric2) greater than 0.2 are included. The corresponding p‐values
were calculated by comparing MODZ of each gene to zero using the Empirical Bayes weighted t‐
test with the same weights used for calculating MODZs. The shRNA and CRISPR knock‐down
signatures targeting the same gene were further aggregated into Consensus gene signatures
(CGSes)2 by the same procedure used to calculate MODZs and associated p‐values.
LINCS targeted proteomics signatures: Signatures of chemical perturbations assayed by the
quantitative targeted mass spectrometry proteomics P100 assay measuring levels 96
phosphopeptides and GCP assay against ~60 probes that monitor combinations of post‐
translational modifications on histones5.
Disease related signatures: Transcriptional signatures constructed by comparing sample
groups within the collection of curated public domain transcriptional dataset (GEO DataSets
collection)37. Each signature consists of differential expressions and associated p‐values for all
genes calculated using Empirical Bayes linear model implemented in the limma package.
ENCODE transcription factor binding signatures: Genome‐wide transcription factor (TF)
binding signatures constructed by applying the TREG methodology to ENCODE ChiP‐seq64. Each
signature consists of scores and probabilities of regulation by the given TF in the specific context
(cell line and treatment) for each gene in the genome.
Connectivity Map Signatures: Transcriptional signatures of perturbagen activity constructed
based on the version 2 of the original Connectivity Map dataset using Affymetrix expression
arrays42. Each signature consists of differential expressions and associated p‐values for all genes
when comparing perturbagen treated cell lines with appropriate controls.
DrugMatrix signatures: Toxicogenomic signatures of over 600 different compounds41
maintained by the National Toxicology Program65 consisting of genome‐wide differential gene
expression levels and associated p‐values.
Transcriptional signatures from EBI Expression Atlas: All mouse, rat and human differential
expression signatures and associated p‐values from manually curated comparisons in the
Expression Atlas8.
Cancer therapeutics response signatures: These signatures were created by combining
transcriptional data with drug sensitivity data from the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal
(CTRP) project47. Signatures were created separately for each tissue/cell lineage in the dataset by
comparing gene expression between the five cell lines of that lineage that were most and five
that were least sensitive to a given drug area as measured by the concentration‐response curve
(AUC) using two‐sample t‐test.
Pharmacogenomics transcriptional signatures: These signatures were created by calculating
differential gene expression levels and associated p‐value between cell‐lines treated with anti‐

cancer drugs and the corresponding controls in two separate projects:
The NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI‐TPW)43 and the Plate‐seq project
dataset4.
Constructing signatures from iLINCS datasets
The transcriptomics or proteomics signature is constructed by comparing expression levels of
two groups of samples (treatment group and baseline group) using Empirical Bayes linear model
implemented in the limma package66. For the GREIN collection of GEO RNA‐seq datasets39, the
signatures are constructed using the negative‐binomial generalized linear model as implemented
in the edgeR package67.
Analytical tools, web applications and web resources
Signatures analytics in iLINCS is facilitated via native R, Java, JavaScript and Shiny applications,
and via API connections to external web application and services. Brief listing of analysis and
visualization tools is provided here. The overall structure of iLINCS is described in the
Supplemental Results.
Gene list enrichment analysis is facilitated by directly submitting lists of gene to any of the
three prominent enrichment analysis web tools: Enrichr23, DAVID24, ToppGene25. The
manipulation and selection of list of signature genes is facilitated via an interactive volcano plot
JavaScript application (shown in Supplemental Workflow 3).
Pathway analysis is facilitated through either general purpose enrichment tool (Enrichr,
DAVID, ToppGene), the enrichment analysis of Reactome pathways via Reactome online tool26,
and internal R routines for SPIA analysis68 of KEGG pathways and general visualization of
signatures in the context of KEGG pathways using the KEGG API27.
Network analysis is facilitated by submitting lists of genes to Genemania28 and by internal
iLINCS Shiny Signature Network Analysis (SigNetA) application.
Heatamap visualizations are facilitated by native iLINCS applications: Java based FTreeView21,
modified version of the JavaScript based Morpheus22 and a Shiny based HeatMap application and
by connection to the web application Clustergrammer32.
Dimensionality reduction analysis (PCA and t‐SNE69) and visualization of high‐dimensional
relationship via interactive 2D and 3D scatter plots is facilitated via internal iLINCS Shiny
applications.
Interactive box‐plots, scatter plots, GSEA plots, bar charts and pie charts used throughout
iLINCS are implemented using R ggplot19 and plotly20.
Additional analysis are provided by connection X2K Web29 (inference of upstream regulatory
networks from signature genes), L1000FWD30 (connectivity with signatures constructed using
characteristic dimension methodology), STITCH31 (visualization of drug‐target networks), piNET33
(visualization of gene‐to‐pathway relationships for signature genes).
Additional information about drugs, genes and proteins are provided by links to, LINCS Data
Portal34, ScrubChem35, PubChem36, Harmonizome70, GeneCards71, and several other only
databases.

iLINCS backend databases provide access to more than 11,000 pre‐processed gene and
protein expression datasets that can be used to create and analyze gene and expression protein
signatures. Datasets are thematically organized into eight collections with some datasets
assigned to multiple collections. User can search all datasets, or browse datasets by collection.
LINCS collection: Datasets generated by the LINCS data and signature generation centers7
TCGA collection: Gene expression (RNASeqV2), protein expression (RPPA), and copy number
variation data generated by TCGA project45
GDS collection: A curated collection of GEO Gene Datasets (GDS)37
Cancer collection: An ad‐hoc collection of cancer related genomics and proteomic datasets
Toxicogenomics collection: An ad‐hoc collection of toxicogenomics datasets
RPPA collection: An ad‐hoc collection of proteomic datasets generated by Reverse Phase
Protein Array assay72
GREIN collection: Complete collection of preprocessed human, mouse and rat RNA‐seq data
in GEO provided by the GEO RNA‐seq Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN)73
Reference collection: An ad‐hoc collection of important gene expression datasets.
