Abstract
The computations and neural processes underpinning decision making have primarily been
investigated using highly simplified tasks in which stimulus onsets cue observers to start
accumulating choice-relevant information. Yet, in daily life we are rarely afforded the luxury
of knowing precisely when choice-relevant information will appear. Here, we examined
neural indices of decision formation while subjects discriminated subtle stimulus feature
changes whose timing relative to stimulus onset (‘foreperiod’) was uncertain. Joint analysis
of behavioral error patterns and neural decision signal dynamics indicated that subjects
systematically began the accumulation process before any informative evidence was
presented, and further, that accumulation onset timing varied systematically as a function of
the foreperiod of the preceding trial. These results suggest that the brain can adjust to
temporal uncertainty by strategically modulating accumulation onset timing according to
statistical regularities in the temporal structure of the sensory environment with particular
emphasis on recent experience.

Introduction
To date, perceptual decision making, described as the process whereby noisy sensory
information is accumulated over time towards a decision bound, has been studied
predominantly using tasks in which there is little ambiguity as to when observers should
begin accumulating sensory information (Gold & Shadlen, 2007; Ratcliff & Smith, 2004;
Shadlen & Kiani, 2013). It has been documented extensively throughout the temporal
attention literature, that there are significant advantages, across a wide-range of perceptual
tasks, to knowing precisely when sensory evidence will be available (for reviews see Correa,
Lupianez, Madrid & Tudela, 2006; Jepma, Wagenmakers & Niewenhuis, 2012; Niemi &
Näätänen, 1981; Nobre, Correa & Coull, 2007; Nobre & van Ede, 2018). However, in the
natural sensory world we are not always afforded the luxury of making decisions based on
sensory events that have the same high degree of perceptual salience and/or predictability in
terms of their onset timing as those typically used in experimental tasks. Such uncertainty
presents a critical challenge because mistiming accumulation onset can have detrimental
consequences: premature accumulation can lead to false alarms and fast errors while
commencing accumulation late can lead to information loss and slow response times or
misses (Teichert, Grinband & Ferrera, 2016). The aim of this study was to shed light on how
evidence accumulation is initiated when sensory evidence onsets are temporally uncertain
and hard to detect.
Recent research has highlighted a few mechanisms that the brain could feasibly
deploy. For instance, several studies have pointed to the possibility that, under some
circumstances, the brain relies on sensory-driven mechanisms that detect the appearance of
goal-relevant sensory changes to trigger evidence accumulation. For instance, the Gated
Accumulator Model, suggests that evidence accumulation onset is contingent on sensory
input surpassing a threshold level (Purcell et al., 2010; Purcell, Schall, Logan & Palmeri,
2012; Schall, Purcell, Heitz, Logan & Palmeri, 2011). Similarly, evidence from human
electrophysiology suggests that in a continuous monitoring context, where the timing of
target sensory changes are unpredictable, early target selection mechanisms are involved in
triggering evidence accumulation (Loughnane et al., 2016). However, the amplitude of target
selection signals was found to be heavily dependent on the strength of the sensory evidence
and therefore it is not clear how broadly such a stimulus driven strategy can be applied. An
additional possibility suggested by Teichert and colleagues (2016) is that the onset of sensory

evidence accumulation may be subject to top-down control and adapted in accordance with
the temporal context or demands of the sensory environment. Specifically, decision onset
timing may be calibrated internally in order to optimise the trade-off between accumulating
information too early, thereby risking performance errors, and accumulating too late, thereby
losing valuable information. In the context of temporal uncertainty, behavioural modelling
and psychophysics studies have indicated that prior knowledge of sensory evidence onset
does modulate the timing of accumulation onset (Bausenhart, Rolke, Seibold & Ulrich, 2010;
Jepma et al., 2012; Seibold, Bausenhart, Rolke & Ulrich, 2011). However, these studies have
relied on indirect behavioural metrics for inferring accumulation onset time and direct
neurophysiological evidence has been lacking.
In this study we aimed to examine the mechanisms of perceptual decision making
when subjects have imperfect foreknowledge of the precise timing of a subtle, goal-relevant
sensory change. To this end, we conducted two experiments, both of which required subjects
to discriminate a subtle change in a single stimulus feature (relative contrast of two overlaid
gratings in experiment 1 and coherent dot motion in experiment 2). Temporal uncertainty was
created by pseudorandomly imposing one of three delays intervening between stimulus onset
and this sensory change (from hereon referred to as the ‘foreperiod’) on each trial. We traced
activity in two previously characterised decision variable signals that trace sensory evidence
accumulation: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP; Kelly & O'Connell, 2013; 2015; O'Connell,
Dockree & Kelly, 2012; Twomey, Murphy, Kelly & O’Connell, 2015) and effector-selective
Mu/Beta band (10-30 Hz) activity (de Lange, Rahnev, Donner & Lau, 2013; Donner, Siegel,
Fries & Engel, 2009; O'Connell et al., 2012; Siegel, Engel & Donner, 2011; Steinemann,
O’Connell & Kelly, 2018). Each of these signals builds gradually during decision formation
at a rate proportional to evidence strength, peaks around the time of a decision-reporting
movement, predicts choice accuracy and RT across trials and exhibits amplitude modulations
consistent with decision bound adjustments (Kelly & O’Connell, 2013; O’Connell et al.,
2012; Steinemann et al., 2018; Loughnane et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2015). Unlike the
decision signals observed in premotor regions of the human and non-human brain, the CPP
provides a domain-general or abstract representation of an emerging decision, tracing
evidence accumulation even in conditions where no overt action is required and motor
preparation is absent (O’Connell et al., 2012; Twomey, Kelly & O’Connell, 2016).
We found that in this situation where subjects are unable to time the onset of decision
formation to coincide with the uncertain onset of choice-relevant sensory evidence (contrast

change in experiment 1 or coherent motion onset in experiment 2), they systematically
initiated evidence accumulation in advance of the evidence. This was reflected in the build-up
of the CPP during the foreperiod, which, in experiment 2, directly reflected random
fluctuations in motion energy, and also in choice-predictive lateralisation of Mu/Beta band
activity. The timing of accumulation onset relative to the sensory change accounted for the
pronounced foreperiod effects that were observed on choice behaviour including increased
miss rates on short foreperiod trials and elevated premature responses and fast errors on long
foreperiod trials. Furthermore, we found that accumulation onset timing was not fixed across
trials but varied systematically according to recent trial foreperiod duration, with
accumulation commencing earlier if the previous foreperiod was shorter. This also gave rise
to a congruency effect whereby choice accuracy was greater if the foreperiod duration on
consecutive trials was congruent.

Results
Experiment 1: Contrast discrimination
We analysed 128-channel EEG data from 23 human subjects performing a twoalternative contrast discrimination task (see materials and methods; figure 1a). in which they
compared the contrast of two overlaid grating stimuli presented at fixation. At the outset of
each trail, the gratings were presented and held constant at 50% contrast for one of three
foreperiod durations (800ms/1200ms/1600ms). Once the foreperiod had elapsed, the gratings
underwent antithetical changes in contrast (one increased while the other decreased), and the
participant was asked to report whether the left or right tilted grating was higher in contrast
by clicking the corresponding mouse button with their corresponding thumb. The magnitude
of the contrast change for each grating was determined separately for each subject during
preliminary training using a staircase procedure (choice accuracy at 65-70%, mean contrast:
5.5% ±1.35, see materials and methods). Participants were informed clearly at the beginning
of the study about the variability in the foreperiod durations. This was demonstrated to them
during practise trials in which the contrast change was very large and evidence onsets clearly
noticeable. Points were awarded on each trial in order to encourage participants to respond
both as quickly and as accurately as possible. 40 points were awarded for correct responses
with a speed bonus of 0-40 additional points. Meanwhile, incorrect, missed or premature
responses were awarded 0 points. Performance feedback was presented on a trial-by-trial
(correct/incorrect/clicked too soon/too late) and block-by-block basis (accuracy, mean
reaction time and cumulative points earned).

Behaviour
Taken together our behavioural data suggest that subjects adopted a decision strategy
that was tailored to the average onset time of the contrast change (i.e. the middle foreperiod)
which resulted in responses that were more closely timed with respect to stimulus onset than
to evidence onset. First, there were significant main effects of foreperiod on RT (figure 1b-c;
one-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1.13, 22.56)=1717, p=1.68x10-39), accuracy (figure
1d-e; F(1.43, 28.64)=60.08, 8.91x10-13), missed responses (figure 1f; F(1.07, 21.38)=114.29,
p=2.88x10-17), premature responses (i.e. prior to sensory change onset, figure 1g; F(1.01
20.12)=39.55, p=1.38x10-5) and points earned (figure 1h; F(1.17, 23.49)=26.55, p=4.60x105

). Post-hoc tests (see figure 1b-h; asterisks indicate significance levels) indicate that a longer

(1600ms) foreperiod resulted in faster but less accurate responses and an increased tendency
to respond prematurely. The opposite was true of short (800ms) foreperiod trials where
responses were slower and less error prone but misses more common. Overall performance
peaked on intermediate (1200ms) foreperiod trials which yielded the highest levels of
accuracy and greatest number of points earned per trial with relatively low levels of both
misses and premature responses.
Next, we analysed accuracy as a function of RT separately for each foreperiod
('conditional accuracy functions'; figure 1d). This analysis revealed two key trends. Firstly,
the diminished accuracy on longer foreperiod trials manifested specifically on trials with
faster RTs, reaching chance levels for the subset of long foreperiod trials with RTs closest to
the contrast-change onset. This observation suggests that responses made close to the target
change onset were were based on little or no valid sensory evidence. Secondly,

the

conditional accuracy functions also highlight that beyond 2400ms, accuracy diminished
monotonically as a function of RT across all three foreperiod durations.

Sensory Evidence Representation Unaffected by Foreperiod Duration
In order to determine whether sensory evidence representations were stable across the
three foreperiod durations, we flickered each of the grating stimuli at a different frequency
(20 Hz for left-tilted gratings, 25 Hz for right-tilted gratings) thereby eliciting separate
SSVEPs in those corresponding frequency bands (20 Hz and 25 Hz respectively) over the
occipital cortex (figure 2a). Key characteristics of these SSVEP signals indicate that they
provide a read-out of the representation of the sensory evidence for contrast-based perceptual
decisions: they are highly sensitive to modulations of stimulus contrast (Di Russo et al., 2007;
Di Russo, Spinelli & Morrone, 2001; Di Russo, Teder-Sälejärvi & Hillyard, 2003; Kim,
Grabowecky, Paller, Muthu & Suzuki, 2007; Norcia, Appelbaum, Ales, Cottereau & Rossion,
2015; O’Connell et al., 2012; Vialatte, Maurice, Dauwels & Cichocki, 2010) and, their
amplitudes predict both response accuracy (Steinemann et al., 2018) and RT (Loughnane et
al., 2018; O’Connell et al., 2012).
We analysed the SSVEPs as a function of foreperiod duration and stimulus (target vs
non-target) using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. As expected, the SNR of the target
SSVEP (corresponding to the grating whose contrast increased) increased following the onset
of the contrast change while that of the non-target (grating whose contrast decreased)
decreased. Consistent with this we found a main effect of stimulus (target vs non-target) on
SSVEP SNR in windows centered on 500ms post-contrast change (figure 2b; F(1, 18)=13.93,
p=.002) and 200ms pre-response (figure 2c; F(1, 18)=30.12, p=3.27x10-5). These effects are
also apparent in the difference SSVEP (d-SSVEP), which was calculated by subtracting the
non-target from the target SSVEP (Figure 2d-e). Foreperiod on the other hand did not affect
the SSVEP SNR (Post-contrast change: F(2, 36)=.06, p=.94; Pre-response: F(1 18.40)=.01
p=.92), irrespective of the stimulus (foreperiod x stimulus interactions: Post-contrast change:
F(2, 36)=.45, p=.64; Pre-response: F(1.05, 18.96)=.13, p=.73). Together these findings
indicate that the representation of sensory evidence was stable across the three foreperiods
and could not account for the observed behavioural trends.

Premature Decision Formation on Trials with Longer Foreperiods
Figure 3b shows that, on longer foreperiod trials, significant CPP build-up was
observed prior to the onset of the contrast change (figure 3b; one-sample t-tests: 800ms:
t(18)=1.79, p=.14; 1200ms: t(18)=3.71 p=.0016; 1600ms t(18)=5.52, p=2x10-5). To explore
this further, we analysed the CPP as a function of foreperiod duration and RT using two-way
repeated measures ANOVAs. To this end we separated the data, within each foreperiod, into
6 equally sized bins, according to RT. Our analyses found that the CPP amplitude prior to
evidence onset was larger on longer foreperiod trials (F(1.27, 22.91=25.00, p=1.6x10-5; linear
contrast: p=4.75x10-5; quadratic contrast: p=.17). Moreover, there was an inverse relationship

between the amount of pre-evidence CPP build up and RT (figure 3d; F(5, 90)=6.56, p=3x105), irrespective of foreperiod duration (RT x foreperiod interaction: F(5.33, 95.91)=1.07,
p=.39), indicating that

greater pre-evidence CPP build-up was associated with faster

responses. Further, the build-up rate of the CPP during the foreperiod (measured as the slope
of a line fit to the CPP waveform in a 300ms window centered at 100ms prior to the contrast
change) also predicted RT, irrespective of foreperiod duration (figure 3f; main effect of RT:
F(5, 90)=4.42, p=.001; main effect of foreperiod: F(2,36)=2.39, p=.11; RT x foreperiod
interaction: F(4.81 86.54)=.63, p=.67).
In light of the fact that the data from experiment 1 were collected over five separate
experimental sessions, we sought to establish the degree to which the early build-up of the
CPP during the foreperiod is a phenomenon that emerges only after extensive practice . As
highlighted in supplementary figure 1, there was significant pre-evidence build-up of the CPP
on longer foreperiod trials even on session 1 (t(18)=4.12, p= 6.4x10-5) and the amount of preevidence CPP-build up did not vary systematically across training sessions (main effect of
session: F(4, 72)=1.18, p=.33).
We also measured and analyzed CPP build-up rates in the response-aligned
waveforms. There was no main effect of either RT (F(5, 90)=.75, p=.59) or foreperiod
duration (F(2, 36)=.56, p=.58) but there was a significant cross-over interaction (figure 3g;
F(10, 180)=4.24, p=2.7x10-5), suggesting that the relationship between RT and pre-response
CPP build-up rate was reversed for short and long foreperiod trials. Figure 3g illustrates that
when the foreperiod was short, faster RTs were associated with steeper pre-response CPP
slope. By comparison, the opposite was true of long foreperiod trials with faster responses
having shallower pre-response CPP slopes. The shallower build-up rate of the pre-response
CPP on faster RT trials can be explained in light of the close temporal proximity of these
responses to the timing of the contrast change and hence the lesser contribution of valid
sensory evidence to those decisions.
Alongside the early CPP build-up, we observed a progressive increase in motor
preparation reflected in Mu/Beta desynchronisation over the hemispheres contralateral and
ipsilateral to the response-executing hand throughout the pre-evidence foreperiod (figure 3i).
To specifically isolate the choice-predictive component of motor preparation, we examined
the differential motor preparation for the ultimately executed response relative to the withheld
response, by computing the Mu/Beta lateralisation index (contralateral minus ipsilateral to the

response hand). This analysis indicated that there was significant pre-evidence Mu/Beta
lateralisation on longer foreperiod trials (figure 3i inset; one-sample t-tests: 800ms: t(18)=1.27, p=.22; 1200ms: t(18)=-3.64, p=.002; 1600ms: t(18)=-3.91 p=.001). To further examine
this choice-predictive motor activity we analysed Mu/Beta lateralisation as a function of
foreperiod and RT using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Longer foreperiods gave rise
to greater pre-evidence Mu/Beta lateralisation (F(2, 36)=3.64, p=.04) with pre-evidence
Mu/Beta lateralisation scaling inversely with RT irrespective of foreperiod duration (figure
3k; main effect of RT: F(5, 90)=2.94, p=.017; RT x foreperiod interaction: F(5.22,
93.99)=1.68, p=.14). This indicated that there was greater choice-selective motor preparation
during the pre-evidence foreperiod predicted faster RTs. Further, the build-up rate of
Mu/Beta lateralisation during the foreperiod (also measured as the slope of a line fit to the
Mu/Beta lateralisation waveform in a 300ms window centered at 100ms prior to evidence
onset) predicted RT irrespective of foreperiod duration (figure 3m; main effect of RT: F(5,
90)=3.56, p=.006; main effect of foreperiod: F(2, 36)=.47, p=.63; RT x foreperiod
interaction: F(4.82, 86.70)=1.45, p=.22). As with the CPP, there was no main effect of
foreperiod on the pre-response build-up rate (measured between -450 and -150ms) of
Mu/Beta lateralisation (F(2, 36)=.25, p=.78) but there was a main effect of RT (F(5,
90)=5.13, p=.01) which was dependent on foreperiod duration (foreperiod x RT interaction:
F(10, 180)=2.08, p=.03). This interaction indicates that the predicted pattern of faster preresponse Mu/Beta lateralisation build-up rates for earlier responses occurred only on short
foreperiod trials but not when the foreperiod was longer (figure 3n).

build-up to increase or decrease across sessions.

Subtle Sensory Evidence Onsets Do Not Elicit Early Target Selection
Responses
Recent research and models of perceptual decision making have pointed to the
importance of sensory-driven target selection mechanisms in triggering the onset of evidence
accumulation (Purcell et al., 2010; Purcell et al., 2012; Schall et al., 2011). In the human
brain, this target selection role has long been attributed to a negative potential over occipital
scalp elicited approximately 200-300ms after the onset of a goal-relevant sensory stimulus

(Luck, 2012; Luck & Hilyard, 1994). Recently we showed that the target selection process is
invoked bilaterally even for a single stimulus at fixation that has no ostensible need for
“selection” and that in a continuous monitoring context, where target onsets are completely
unpredictable, the signal temporally precedes and has a predictive influence on the onset and
rate of evidence accumulation (Loughnane et al., 2016). This highlights the potential general
role for this target selection signal in triggering the accumulation process under conditions of
temporal uncertainty, but given its reliance on the presence of strong, detectable stimulus
transitions (Loughnane et al., 2016), it is not clear whether it could play a major role in the
current task. In fact, here, we did not observe any deflection in bilateral occipital ERP
waveforms in the N2 time window although there was a slow, sustained negativity over the
bilateral occipital cortex (supplementary figure 2a-b). Thus, in contrast to previous
continuous tasks with larger evidence steps, low-level target-selection processes do not
appear to play a role in dealing with temporal uncertainty in the present context.

Foreperiod Duration Does Not Affect Decision Signal Amplitudes at
Response
Recent neurophysiological studies have highlighted that when decisions must be made
to a strict deadline, time-dependent urgency signals serve to expedite the decision process,
progressively lowering the quantity of cumulative evidence required to trigger commitment

(Steinemann et al., 2018 Murphy et al., 2016; Hanks, Kiani & Shadlen, 2014; Thura &
Cisek, 2016). In a recent study we showed that these urgency effects manifested in a timedependent reduction in CPP amplitude (Steinemann et al., 2018). Here however, we did not
find any variation in the CPP amplitude prior to response as a function of foreperiod duration
(F(2, 36)=.47,p=.63; figure 3c) or response time (F(5, 90)=.64, p=.67; figure 3e). Similarly,
the amplitude of contralateral Mu/Beta at the time of response did not vary as a function of
foreperiod duration (figure 3j; F(2, 36)=.49, p=.63) or response time (figure 3n; F(2.16,
38.95)=1.80, p=.18), consistent with a time-invariant action-triggering threshold at the motor
level (Murphy et al., 2016; Steinemann et al., 2018). By comparison, ipsilateral Mu/Beta
prior to response, though not modulated significantly by foreperiod duration (F(1.46,
26.30)=2.82, p=.09), was more desynchronised prior to response on slower RT trials (F(1.86,
33.40)=6.50, p=3x10-5) reflecting more preparation of the unchosen response hand on these
trials and a closer ‘race’ between the alternative outcomes. Correspondingly, mu-beta
lateralisation prior to response was stronger on faster response trials (F(2.68, 48.31)=3.99,
p=.01), a finding that is consistent with previous studies (Murphy et al., 2016).

Summary: Experiment 1
The key results from experiment 1 show that in the absence of foreknowledge about
the precise onset timing of a subtle goal relevant sensory change, subjects were unable to
align the onset of decision formation to sensory evidence onset. On longer foreperiod trials,
subjects consistently commenced decision formation before the target contrast change
occurred, resulting in a higher incidence of false alarms and fast errors. The premature onset
of the decision process was reflected in the build-up of the CPP and the emergence of choice
predictive Mu/Beta lateralisation during the foreperiod. However, these data do not allow us
to definitively establish whether the early build-up of decision-related activity reflected the
accumulation of sensory noise, as opposed to some other process such as urgency (e.g. Cisek,
Puskas & El-Murr, 2009; Thura, Beauregard-Racine, Fradet & Cisek, 2012; Thura & Cisek,
2016). To address this in experiment 2, we used the random dot motion task in which
variability in physical dot motion energy from one frame to the next can be directly
quantified by applying dot motion energy filtering. Random variations in motion energy
during the foreperiod were leveraged in order to directly test for behavioural and
electrophysiological indications of premature evidence accumulation.

Experiment 2: Dot Motion Discrimination
We analysed 128-channel EEG data from 23 human subjects who performed a twoalternative forced choice random dot motion discrimination task in which participants were
required to judge the dominant direction of motion in a cloud of moving dots (see materials
and methods; figure 4a). On each trial the dots initially moved randomly (0% coherence) for
the duration of an initial foreperiod that varied unpredictably from one trial to the next across
three levels (800ms/1200ms/1600ms). Once the foreperiod had elapsed, a portion of the dots
began to move coherently in either a leftward or rightward direction. The portion of
coherently moving dots, which was determined separately for each subject using a staircase
procedure (see materials and methods) was, on average, 7.42% (SD=2.61%). Subjects were
required to indicate the perceived direction of the coherent motion by clicking the
corresponding (left/right) mouse button with their corresponding thumb (left/right).
Participants were fully aware of the initial foreperiod and received feedback and points based
on their performance following the same method implemented in experiment 1.

Behaviour
As in experiment 1, we first analysed behaviour separated according to foreperiod
duration (summarised in Figure 4b-h) and observed highly similar trends including
significant effects on RT (figure 4b-c; F(1.07, 19.20)=150.60, p=1x10-10), accuracy (figure
4d-e; F(1.47, 26.38)=7.69, p=.005), miss rate (figure 4f; F(1.08, 19.42)=63.76, p=9.7x10-8),
premature response rate (figure 4g; F(1.08, 19.40)=58.80, p=1.8x10-7) and points earned per
trial (figure 4h; F(142, 25.50)=10.10, p=.002).

Decision Formation Commenced Prematurely on Longer Foreperiod Trials
and Was Predictive of Behaviour
As in experiment 1 there was significant build-up of the CPP prior to the onset of the
coherent motion (figure 5b) for longer foreperiod trials (one-sample t-tests: 800ms:
t(17)=1.21 p=.24; 1200ms: t(17)=2.28, p=.03; 1600ms: t(17)=3.49, p=.003), with longer preevidence foreperiods resulting in larger CPP amplitudes at the time of coherent motion onset
(F(2, 34) =5.45, p=.009). As in experiment 1, the build-up rate of the pre-evidence CPP did
not vary as a function of foreperiod duration (F(1.45, 24.57)=1.96, p=.17). Likewise, preresponse CPP build-up rate was also invariant across foreperiod durations (ANOVA; main
effect of foreperiod on pre-response CPP build-up rate: F(2, 34)=.04, p=.96).
Similar to the CPP, there was desynchronisation in Mu/Beta band activity over the
hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the response-executing hand throughout the preevidence foreperiod, with a progressive lateralisation toward the contralateral hemisphere on
longer foreperiod trials (figure 5i; 800ms t(17)=-.40, p=.69; 1200ms: t(17)=-1.65, p=.12;
1600ms: t(17)=-3.23, p=.005) that increased as a function of foreperiod duration (F(3,
34)=3.49, p=.04). As reported in experiment 1 the rate of Mu/Beta lateralisation did not vary
across foreperiod durations (F(3, 34)=.72, p=.49). Likewise, there was also no effect of
foreperiod on the slope of pre-response Mu/Beta lateralisation (foreperiod main effect: (F(2,
34)=.09, p=.92).
Also in line with the results of experiment 1 the CPP amplitude at response did not
vary significantly as a function of foreperiod duration (figure 5c; F(1.29, 21.92)=.04, p=.96)
or response time (figure 5e; F(2, 34)=.52, p=.6). Similarly, the amplitude of contralateral
Mu/Beta at the time of response did not vary as a function of foreperiod duration (figure 5j;
main effect foreperiod: F(2, 34)=.13, p=.88) or response time (figure 5j; main effect response
time: F(2, 34)=.74, p=.48).
Although the principle findings of experiment 1 were replicated in experiment 2,
confirming the early onset of the decision formation process on longer foreperiod trials, some

trends from experiment 1 were notably absent in experiment 2. Specifically, the relationship
between RT and pre-evidence CPP amplitude (F(2, 34)=.12, p=.89), pre-evidence CPP slope
(F(1.45, 24.57)=1.96, p=.16) and pre-response CPP slope (F(2, 34)=2.08, p=.14) did not
reach statistical significance. Likewise, the relationship between RT and the magnitude of
Mu/Beta lateralisation in the pre-evidence (F(2, 34)=1.73, p=.19) or pre response time
periods (F(2, 34)=1.80, p=.18), or the buildup rate in either the pre-evidence (F(2, 34)=.71
p=.50) or pre-response periods (F(2, 34)=.33, p=.72), did not reach statistical significance. A
possible reason for these trends failing to replicate is the fact that there were far fewer trials
in experiment 2, which consisted of a single experimental session (circa 500 trials per
subject), than in experiment 1, which consisted of 5 separate experimental sessions (circa
2000 trials per subject). Consequently, when broken down by RT, our neural signal
measurements may have been less robust in experiment 2 and therefore less sensitive to RT
effects.

Pre-Evidence Cumulative Motion Energy Predicts Fast Choices And Preevidence CPP Build-Up
In order to quantify the degree to which the dot motion stimulus by chance favoured
one decision alternative or the other during the incoherent motion foreperiod, we performed
dot motion energy filtering (see Methods). On the basis that the effects of random motion
energy fluctuations should be most prominent for early choices, we separated long foreperiod
trials into fast (<500ms) and slow responses (>500ms) and then calculated the integral of dot
motion energy during the foreperiod (100ms-1600ms). One-sample t-tests confirmed that

there was significant sustained motion energy in the direction of the chosen response on fast
RT trials (figure 6a; t(17)=2.21 p=.04) but not on slow RT trials (figure 6a; t(17)=.03, p=.98).
Next we sought to determine whether pre-evidence motion energy predicted the
magnitude of pre-evidence CPP build-up. To this end we separated trials into two bins
according to the slope of the pre-evidence dot motion integral (shallow vs. steep). This
enabled us to to isolate trials where the cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod
strongly and consistently favoured one choice or another by chance alone (figure 6b). For
each subset of trials we measured the slope of the pre-evidence CPP over a broad window
(600ms-1600ms) and the amplitude of the CPP in a 100ms window centered on the time of
coherent motion onset (1600ms). We found that there was significant pre-evidence build-up
of the CPP on trials where the cumulative motion energy consistently favoured a particular
choice (figure 6c; one-sample t-tests: Amplitude: t(17)=3.21 p=.005; Slope: t(17)=3.25,
p=.005) but not on those where the dot motion weakly and/or inconsistently favoured a
specific choice (figure 6c; Amplitude vs 0: t(17)=1.37, p=.19; Slope vs 0: t(17)=1.59, p=.13).
Paired samples t-tests comparing this pre-evidence CPP build-up between the two conditions
(shallow vs steep pre-evidence motion integral) were significant (Amplitude: t(17)=2.41
p=.03) or close-to-significant (Slope: t(17)=1.92, p=.07) suggesting that the build-up of the
CPP did reflect cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod.

subtle change in a sensory stimulus. Here, we observed a small, N2-like deflection in the time
window 200-300ms relative to coherent motion onset over the bilateral occipital regions
(supplementary figure 3a-b). However, relative to baseline, the magnitude of this component
was not statistically significant for any of the foreperiods (all p>0.5 for t-tests against 0).
Again, this suggests that low-level target-selection processes are not reliably elicited when
coherent motion is weak.

Decision Onset Timing is Modulated by Recent Temporal Structure
Thus far our data suggest that foreperiod effects on choice performance on these tasks
can be attributed, in large part, to the premature onset of evidence accumulation occurring in
this task. Next, we sought to examine the degree to which evidence accumulation onsets
varied systematically as a function of trial history. Prior research in humans (Jazayeri &
Shadlen, 2010) and in monkeys (Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2015) suggests that we exploit previous
experiences and apply bayesian statistics in order to overcome uncertainty when estimating
time or anticipating events. Specifically, these studies suggest that time estimates are affected
by knowledge about the underlying distribution from which time intervals are drawn and are
biased towards the mean of that distribution. Given that there was a uniform distribution of

the three foreperiods on our tasks, a bias towards the mean trial timing would lead to more
favourable performance on intermediate foreperiod, which is what we observed.
To further explore this idea we conducted additional analyses of the data from
experiment 1, hypothesising that, if decision onset timing is indeed affected by prior
knowledge of temporal structure, then recent experiences may be particularly influential. For
instance, in the temporal attention literature, the widely-documented sequential foreperiod
effect suggests that the speed with which perceptual decisions are made is affected by
previous trial timings (Capizzi et al., 2013; Los & Heslenfeld, 2005; Mento, 2013; 2017; Van
der Lubbe, Los, Jaskowski & Verleger, 2004), though this phenomenon has not explicitly
been linked or investigated with respect to the timing of evidence accumulation onset. Here,
we separated trials according to the foreperiod on the current trial (foreperiodn) and the
foreperiod on the immediately preceding trial (foreperiodn-1). We found that behavioural
performance on foreperiodn was modulated significantly by foreperiodn-1, such that responses
were faster when foreperiodn-1 was shorter (figure 7a; F(2, 40)=140.17, p=2.49x10-19) and
this effect was more pronounced when foreperiodn was long (foreperiodn x foreperiodn-1
interaction: F(4, 80)=7.37, p=4.17x10-5). Moreover, foreperiodn-1 also affected accuracy (F(2,
40)=5.23, p=.01), but this effect was dependent on foreperiodn (foreperiodn x foreperiodn-1
interaction: F(4, 80)=14.90, p=3.85x10-9). The trends shown in figure 7b indicate that on
short or long foreperiodn trials, foreperiod repetition led to a gain in accuracy whereas a
change in foreperiod duration from one trial to the next was associated with a cost to
accuracy. Furthermore, in line with the above effects, we found that the rate of missed
responses on short foreperiodn trials was reduced if short foreperiods occurred consecutively
(figure 7c; F(2, 40)=36.51, p=9.52x10-10) while the rate of premature responses on long
foreperiodn trials was reduced when long foreperiods occurred consecutively (figure 7d; F(2,
40)=8.12, p=.001).

Figure 7: Behavioural performance as a function of foreperiodn-1 and foreperiodn.
A) On longer foreperiodntrials, accuracy was higher if foreperiodn-1was also long whereas on short
foreperiodntrials, accuracy was higher if foreperiodn-1was short. B) Participants responded faster when
foreperiodn-1 was shorter. C) The rate of missed responses was higher when foreperiodn-1was long.
D)The rate of premature responses was higher when foreperiodn-1was short.

Our analyses further show that the effects of foreperiodn-1 on behaviour can be
attributed, at least in part, to trial-by-trial modulation of evidence accumulation onset timing.
As illustrated in figure 8a, the CPP reached a higher amplitude at the time of the contrast
change when foreperiodn-1 was shorter (F(2, 36)=4.38, p=.02). The absence of any effect of
foreperiodn-1 on pre-evidence CPP slope (F(2, 36)=.54, p= .59) suggests that the pre-evidence
amplitude differences arose from differences in the onset, rather than the rate, of premature
evidence accumulation. Together these findings indicate that decision onset timing is
modulated by recent experience of temporal structure in the sensory environment.

Discussion
Our investigation yielded three key findings. Firstly, in this situation where
participants lacked exogenous cues marking the onset of temporally unpredictable sensory
evidence, their choice behaviour reflected systematic variations in the onset of the neural
evidence accumulation process, with longer foreperiods being associated with greater
premature accumulation. Secondly, accumulation onset timing, which was not fixed across
trials, appears to have been calibrated strategically and adjusted continuously based on
experience of the underlying temporal structure of the task. Thirdly, our data suggests that
participants could not rely on target selection mechanisms to initiate the onset of evidence
accumulation. Recent work has highlighted that when sensory evidence onsets are
unpredictable but relatively salient, early target selection signals are involved in triggering
evidence accumulation onset (Loughnane et al., 2016; see also Purcell et al., 2010; 2012;
Schall et al., 2011). Here however, our titration procedure ensured that the onset of the
sensory changes were very weak and, by consequence, target selection signals were not
reliably observed in our data forcing participants to rely on alternative strategies. Our data
indicate that participants initiated evidence accumulation to coincide with the earliest
possible evidence onset and, consequently, accumulated sensory noise during the foreperiods,
resulting in faster, less accurate responses on trials with later evidence onsets.
In their recent review, Teichert et al. (2016) suggested that evidence accumulation
onset timing can be adapted strategically in light of the particular challenges of a given
scenario and is not merely triggered on the basis of sensory input. Two features of the data
presented here suggest participants may have adapted the onset timing of accumulation based
on their knowledge of the underlying temporal structure of the task. Firstly, overall
performance peaked on intermediate foreperiod trials which yielded higher level of accuracy
and points earned as well as low rates of both missed and premature responses. This pattern is
interesting in light of research in the domain of time estimation, which suggests that under
conditions of uncertainty the brain biases time estimates towards the centre of the distribution
from which trial timings are drawn, a bayesian strategy known as regression to the mean
(Jazayeri & Shadlen, 2010; 2015). Given that the foreperiod duration was drawn from a
uniform distribution in the present study, the enhanced behavioural performance on
intermediate foreperiod trials observed here, is consistent with a strategy of biasing the timing
of evidence accumulation towards the centre of the foreperiod distribution. This can account

for the tendency to miss more targets on short foreperiod trials and to commit more
premature responses on long foreperiod trials. This claim could be bolstered if, in future
investigations, distinct behavioural patterns were observed when drawing the foreperiod from
asymmetrical distributions. Secondly, we also observed a clear adjustment in evidence
accumulation onset timing from one trial to the next, based on the duration of the foreperiod
on the previous trial. According to the normative theories, intertrial dependencies such as this
may reflect the inherent tendency for the brain to monitor and exploit local statistical patterns
in the environment in order to reduce uncertainty (Jones, Curran, Mozer & Wilder, 2013;
Wilder, Jones, Ahmed, Curran & Mozer, 2013; Wilder, Jones & Mozer, 2010; Yu & Cohen,
2008). Thus, these trial-by-trial adjustments in accumulation onset timing may reflect
continuous updating of temporal expectations that inform accumulation onset timing.
Together these two findings support the conclusion that adaptive, top-down factors impacted
accumulation onset timing.
Our finding that evidence accumulation onset timing is adjusted from trial-to-trial also
adds to a broader and growing body of research into the serial dependency in perceptual
decision making. For instance, numerous studies have recently shed light on the fact that
individuals exhibit a variety of idiosyncratic choice-history biases, which have variously been
linked to biases in the starting point of evidence accumulation (Bode et al., 2012; de Lange et
al., 2013; Yu & Cohen, 2008; Zhang, Huang & Yu, 2014) or biases in the weighting of
sensory evidence (Braun, Urai & Donner, 2018; Kloosterman et al., 2018; Talluri, Urai,
Tsetsos, Usher & Donner, 2018; Urai, de Gee, Tsetsos & Donner, 2019). Here we show that
the timing of evidence accumulation onset is in part determined by the duration of the
foreperiod on recent trials, with shorter foreperiods leading to earlier accumulation onset on
subsequent trials and correspondingly faster RTs. Moreover, trial-by-trial adjustments in
accumulation onset timing were also consequential for accuracy. When the same foreperiod
duration was, by chance, repeated from one trial to the next, decision onset timing was more
aligned to the physical sensory change than when the foreperiods were mismatched, and this
incurred a corresponding benefit for accuracy. In turn, when the foreperiod mismatch on
consecutive trials was maximal (i.e. short followed by long or vice-versa), decision onset
timing was particularly misaligned with the physical sensory change and the greatest
decrements in accuracy were incurred.
Our results also have the potential to shed light on the mechanisms underpinning a
well-known phenomenon in the temporal attention literature, known as the sequential

foreperiod effect. This effect, which is another example of serial dependency, is characterised
by the modulation of RT by previous trial foreperiod in the context of target detection tasks
with variable foreperiods (Capizzi, Correa & Sanabria, 2013; Capizzi, Sanabria & Correa,
2012; Capizzi, Correa, Wojtowicz & Rafal, 2015; Los et al., 2017; Los & Van den Heuvel,
2001; Steinborn & Langner, 2012; Vallesi, McIntosh, & Stuss, 2009; Vallesi, Shallice, &
Walsh, 2007). Our results replicate the sequential foreperiod effect using a task in which
respondents performed a difficult perceptual discrimination task where the foreperiod varied
pseudorandomly from trial to trial. In this context at least, the sequential foreperiod effect, the
underlying mechanisms of which have not yet been fully explained, can be attributed to the
adjustment in evidence accumulation onset timing. Interestingly, in the broader literature on
temporal orienting, data from psychophysical and computational modelling studies have
implicated decision onset timing in temporal orienting more generally (Bausenhart, Rolke,
Seibold & Ulrich, 2010; Jepma, Wagenmakers & Nieuwenhuis, 2012; Rolke, 2008; Rolke &
Hofmann, 2007; Seibold, Bausenhart, Rolke & Ulrich, 2011). Our findings provide the first
neurophysiological evidence in support of this idea.
Finally, our study highlights how neural decision signals can be leveraged to gain
insights into the timing of accumulation onset that are otherwise very difficult to discern
through behaviour. Previous studies investigating decision onset timing have relied on
indirect behavioural measures such as fast error rate, shifts in the leading edge of response
time distributions, and estimates of non-decision time derived from sequential sampling
models (Teichert et al., 2016). The use of non-decision time is problematic because the
timing of evidence accumulation is just one of a number of factors, alongside afferent (e.g.
sensory encoding, neural transmission) and efferent (e.g. motor execution) decision-related
processes that contribute to this parameter. Our data indicate that it is possible to infer the
timing of accumulation onset directly from the temporal dynamics of the CPP.
In summary, this study has shed light on the important role of accumulation onset
timing in perceptual decision-making and has yielded two key insights in this regard. Firstly,
we have shown that in the absence of foreknowledge about the precise timing of a subtle goal
relevant sensory change, observers are unable to accurately time the onset of sensory
evidence accumulation with respect to that event, resulting in instances where accumulation
commences too early, leading to premature responses and fast errors, as well as instances
where accumulation is delayed, leading to missed responses. Secondly, we have
demonstrated that accumulation onset timing is not governed solely by sensory driven

rely on and continuously update our average representation of the temporal structure of a
given task.

Materials and Methods

Subjects
Experiment 1: Contrast Discrimination Task
Twenty-three subjects aged 19-30 (12 males, 11 females) were recruited to take part
in a two-alternative, forced choice, contrast discrimination task as part of a study on
perceptual learning taking place over the course of 6 separate experimental sessions. This
pre-planned sample size is consistent with previous electrophysiological studies conducted
within our group (e.g. Murphy et al., 2015; O’Connell et al., 2012; Kelly & O’Connell, 2015;
Steinemann et al., 2018; Twomey et al., 2015) and elsewhere (e.g. Diaz, Queirazza &
Philiastides, 2017; McGovern, Webb & Peirce, 2012). All subjects were right-handed, had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of personal or familial neurological or
psychiatric illness. Subjects were requested to abstain from alcohol consumption and to
maintain regular patterns of sleeping for the duration of the study so as to minimise potential
confounds between sessions. One subject was excluded after reporting retrospectively that
they had failed to comply with this prerequisite. One further subject dropped out after the
second session and their data were excluded. Data from the final experimental session were
excluded for one additional subject due to an error in setting the presentation monitor refresh
rate on that day. This resulted in a final sample size of 21 (10 male, 11 female; Age:
M=22.41, SD=2.96). For the purpose of electrophysiological analyses two further subjects
were excluded, due to excessive blink and/or EEG artefacts (>40% trial loss), but their data
were retained for behavioural analyses.
Prior to taking part, subjects were informed that they would receive a €10
reimbursement per testing session with the possibility of earning a performance bonus of up
to €20 upon completing the study. In order to incentivise subjects, they were misled to
believe that the exact value of their bonus was dependent on how many points (see design
and procedure) they accumulated over the course of the study. In fact, all subject who
completed the study were awarded the maximum additional bonus of €20 (total payment =
€80) after being debriefed about the nature of the study and rationale for the deception.
Written, informed consent was obtained from all subjects and all procedures were approved

Declaration of Helsinki.

Experiment 2: Dot Motion Discrimination Task
Nineteen subjects aged 18-37 (M=25.74, SD=5.92; 10 females, 9 males) were
recruited to take part in a dot motion discrimination task comprising a single session of data
collection. This pre-planned sample size is consistent with previous electrophysiological
studies conducted within our group (e.g. Murphy et al., 2015; O’Connell et al., 2012; Kelly &
O’Connell, 2015; Steinemann et al., 2018; Twomey et al., 2015). All subjects were righthanded, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no history of personal or familial
neurological or psychiatric illness. In the case of one subject, a file containing the data
necessary for carrying out analyses of dot motion energy (see below) was missing. Their data
were retained for all behavioural and electrophysiological analyses with the exception of
those involving dot motion energy data.
Subjects were informed that they would earn €15 for taking part in the study with the
possibility of earned an additional performance bonus of up to €10. In order to incentivise
subjects, they were misled to believe that the exact value of the bonus was dependent on how
many points they obtained over the course of the study. In fact all subjects were awarded the
maximum bonus for completing the study after being debriefed about the nature of the study
and rationale for the deception. Written, informed consent was obtained from all subjects and
all procedures were approved by the Trinity College Dublin ethics committee and conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Experiment 1: Two-Alternative Forced-Choice Contrast Discrimination
Task
Subjects performed a difficult two-alternative contrast discrimination task, consisting
of discrete trials, in which they were required to discriminate the direction (left or right) of a
target (tilted grating stimulus) based on a change in the relative contrast between two overlaid
grating stimuli (see figure 1a). The experiment consisted of 10 blocks, each containing 50
trials and was conducted in a dark, sound-attenuated room with subjects seated in front of a

51cm cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor (refresh rate: 100 Hz, 1024 x 768 resolution) at a
distance of approximately 57cm. Stimuli used in this task were created using Psychtoolbox
and the experiment was presented using Matlab. The stimuli consisted of two overlaid grating
patterns (spatial frequency = 1 cycle per degree) presented in a circular aperture (inner radius
= 11 outer radius = 6˚) against a dark grey background (luminance: 65.2 cd/m2). Each grating
stimulus was tilted by 45˚ relative to the vertical midline (left tilt = -45˚, right tilt = +45˚).
The gratings were “frequency tagged” in order to allow independent measurement of sensory
evidence in favour of both possible choices, with the left-tilted grating flickering at 20 Hz and
the right-tilted grating flickering at 25 Hz. On each trial the gratings were phase-reversed and
these phase-reversals were pseudorandomly counterbalanced across trials.
Subjects commenced each trial by simultaneously clicking the left and right mouse
button. A central fixation dot was presented, followed 200ms later by the presentation of the
overlaid grating stimuli at 50% contrast. The stimuli were held constant for the duration of an
initial foreperiod, which, as subjects were informed, varied pseudorandomly from trial to trial
between 800ms, 1200ms and 1600ms. After the foreperiod, the gratings underwent opposite
changes in contrast (the magnitude of which were determined individually using a staircase
procedure - see Staircase Procedure below) whereby the target stepped up in contrast while
the non-target stepped down in contrast by a corresponding amount. The gratings remained at
the new contrast level for 2000ms and subjects were required to indicate the direction of the
target stimulus by clicking the corresponding left or right mouse button with their left or right
thumb. Feedback was presented at the end of each trial for 1000ms and at the end of each
block (see Feedback & Points below).
Staircase Procedure:
The change in contrast of the grating stimuli was determined separately for each
subject during an introductory phase of the study, which took place on the first of the six-day
study. During this introduction phase, subjects were first trained to perform the task under
relatively easy conditions (large changes in contrast). Once subjects performed the task under
easy conditions at close to 100% accuracy, the magnitude of the contrast change was then
adjusted downwards gradually over the course of 6-8 short blocks (20 trials each) until
subjects were performing within the range of 65-70% accuracy. The average change in
contrast resulting from this titration procedure was 5.5% (SD=1.35%, range: 2-7%).

Feedback & Points:
At the end of each trial (500ms post stimulus offset) feedback was presented on
screen in text format, for 1000ms. This feedback indicated whether the subject responded
correctly (“Correct”), incorrectly (“Error”), prematurely (responded before or within 150ms
of the contrast change; “Clicked too Soon”), or failed to respond within the deadline (“Too
Late”). At the end of each block, feedback was presented on screen informing subjects of
their mean accuracy and response time during the block. This feedback remained on screen
until either the subject or experimenter exited the screen. With this feedback, subjects were
also given a score for each block reflecting their cumulative points earned during the block.
Points were awarded on a trial by trial basis according to the accuracy and speed with which
subjects responded. Every correct response was awarded 40 points plus a speed bonus, while
incorrect, missed or premature responses were awarded 0 points. The maximum speed bonus
was 40 points and this amount diminished linearly from 40 to 0 across the range of possible
response times (150-2000ms). At the end of each block a bar graph was presented to subjects
depicting their score for each completed block of the task.

Experiment 2: Random Dot Motion Discrimination Task
Subjects performed a difficult, discrete-trial version of the random dot motion
discrimination task (figure 4a) in which they were required to judge the direction (left or
right) of motion based on a cloud of moving dots. The experiment consisted of 8 blocks, each
containing 66 trials and was conducted in a dark, sound-attenuated room with subjects seated
in front of a 51cm CRT monitor (refresh rate: 100 Hz, 1024 x 768 resolution) at a distance of
approximately 57cm. The stimuli used in this task, random dot kinematograms (RDK), were
created using Psychtoolbox and the experiment was presented using Matlab. The RDKs
consisted of a patch of 100 moving white dots (diameter = 4 pixels) presented within a
circular aperture (outer radius = 4˚) against a black background. From frame to frame, the
dots were displaced throughout the circular aperture creating a perception of motion.
At the onset of each trial, a central fixation dot was presented, followed 400ms later
by the onset of the dot motion stimulus. Initially, the dots were displaced within the aperture

at random (0% coherence) giving rise to the perception of random, incoherent motion. The
displacement of the dots remained at 0% coherence for the duration of a foreperiod, which as
subjects were informed, varied pseudorandomly from trial-to-trial between 800ms, 1200ms
and 1600ms. After this foreperiod a portion of the dots began to move coherently in the same
direction (either leftward or rightward). This coherent motion was produced by displacing a
portion of the dots on each frame, chosen at random, in a common direction relative to their
position on the previous frame. All other dots on a given frame were displaced randomly to a
new location within the aperture. The percentage of coherently moving dots was determined
separately for each subject in the study during a pre-experimental introduction phase (see
“Staircase Procedure” below). The duration of coherent motion was 2000ms and subjects
were required to indicate its direction by clicking the corresponding left or right mouse button
with their left or right thumb. As in experiment 1 feedback was presented at the end of each
trial for 1000ms and at the end of each block (see Feedback & Points above).
Staircase Procedure:
The percentage of coherently moving dots was determined separately for each subject
during an introductory phase prior to commencing the experiment. During this phase,
subjects were first trained to perform the task under relatively easy conditions (high coherent
motion). Once subjects were proficient at performing the task under easy conditions (were
close to 100% accuracy), the difficulty of the task was adjusted using a 2-down 1-up staircase
procedure over the course of an 80-trial block that titrated accuracy to 65-70% for each
subject individually. Coherence levels ranged from 3-12% (M=7.42%, SD=2.61%).
Motion Energy Filtering:
RDKs are suited to studying the dynamics of sensory evidence accumulation because
the random displacement of dots from one trial to the next gives rise to objectively
quantifiable variability in sensory evidence within a given trial around the nominal, predetermined, motion coherence level. Momentary sensory evidence favouring leftward or
rightward motion was calculated using dot motion energy filtering (Adelson & Bergen,
1985), using the implementation provided by Urai and Wimmer (2016; see also Urai et al.,
2017). Momentary motion energy values within each trial were initially signed with respect
to whether the movement of the dots on the given frame favoured the left or right choice.
Positive values were attributed to momentary motion energy estimates that favoured
rightward motion and negative values were assigned to those favouring leftward motion.

Behavioural Analysis
Across both experiments the data were segmented according to foreperiod duration
(800/1200/1600ms). In experiment 1, the data were collapsed across experimental sessions.
Response accuracy was defined as the percentage of trials where participants correctly
reported the direction of the target. Response time was calculated in milliseconds (ms)
relative to the time of the sensory change (i.e. the contrast change or onset of coherent
motion). Missed responses were defined as those in which no response was made within the
two-second response deadline (marked by the disappearance of the stimulus from the screen).
Premature responses were defined as those made prior to or within 150ms of the onset of
sensory evidence (i.e. the contrast change or onset of coherent motion). Points earned per trial
were defined as the average number of points earned per trial including trials where no points
were awarded due to missed, erroneous or premature responses. Each of these behavioural
measures was analysed as a function of foreperiod duration using separate one-way repeated
measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by pairwise comparisons (paired-samples
t-tests). The alpha level following Bonferroni corrections for each set of pairwise
comparisons was .017 (.05/3). Accuracy was further examined as a function of response time
by computing condition accuracy functions. To this end the data were broken down into
equally spaced bins based on RT (8 bins in experiment 1 and 6 bins in experiment 2) and
analysed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVAs.
In all of the analyses conducted here, prior investigation was carried out to determine
whether the data were suitable for parametric analysis. Firstly, the data were screened for any
major violations of normality. In the case of repeated measures ANOVAs, Mauchley's test of
sphericity was also carried out to assess the assumption of equal variances of the differences
across all combined levels of a single factor. In all instances where the assumption of
sphericity was violated, greenhouse-geisser corrections were applied to the degrees of
freedom and p-values reported.

The Relationship Between Pre-Evidence Cumulative Motion Energy & Choice
In light of evidence suggesting that the accumulation process may have commenced
before the onset of the goal relevant sensory change, we sought to establish, in experiment 2,
whether there was a relationship between random fluctuations in the sensory stimulus during

the pre-evidence foreperiod and choice. Specifically, we examined whether fast choices on
long foreperiod trials could be attributed to dot motion energy favouring the chosen response
by chance. To this end we expressed momentary motion energy values in terms of whether
they favoured the chosen or unchosen response for a given trial. Positive values were
attributed to motion energy values favouring the chosen response and negative values were
assigned to those favouring the unchosen response. We then divided trials into fast
(RT<500ms) and slow (RT>500ms) responses and calculated the integral of motion energy
during the foreperiod by computing the cumulative sum of the momentary motion energy
values expressed with respect to the chosen responses. The cut-off of 500ms between fast and
slow responses was chosen in order to capture a sufficiently large subset of trials in which
accuracy was very low, as evident in figure 4d. In the case of responses made after the
coherent motion onset, the integral was calculated between 100-1600ms. For responses made
prior to the onset of coherent motion, the integral was calculated between 100ms and the time
of the response. The integral at 1600ms and the slope of the pre-evidence integral (measured
as the slope of a line fit to the pre-evidence motion integral) for fast and slow responses was
compared against 0 using single sample t-tests. Whereas the absolute value of the integral at
1600 provides a measure of how much evidence cumulatively favoured the chosen response,
the slope of the integral is sensitive to the extent to which sensory evidence consistently
favoured the chosen response.

EEG acquisition and Preprocessing (Experiment 1 & 2)
The following procedures for acquiring and preprocessing EEG data apply to data
from experiment 1 and experiment 2. Continuous EEG data were acquired using an
ActiveTwo system (BioSemi, The Netherlands) from 128 scalp electrodes and digitized at
512 Hz. Vertical eye movements were recorded using two vertical electrooculogram (EOG)
electrodes placed above and below the left eye. Data were analysed using custom scripts in
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and the EEGLAB toolbox (Delorme & Makeig, 2004).
Continuous EEG data were low-pass filtered below 35 Hz, high-pass filtered above .05 Hz
and detrended. EEG data were then re-referenced offline to the average reference. EEG data
were segmented into stimulus- and response-aligned epochs. Stimulus-aligned epochs were
extracted from stimulus onset to stimulus offset, which yielded different length windows for
each foreperiod condition: 800ms (Epoch: 0-2,800ms), 1200ms (Epoch: 0-3,200ms) or
37

1600ms (Epoch: 0-3,600ms). Response-aligned epochs were measured from –1000ms preresponse to 600ms post response. The purpose of extending the epoch 600ms post-response
was to allow four full fast fourier transform (FFT) windows to be calculated post-response
(see Time Frequency Decomposition below). All epochs were baseline-corrected relative to
the interval of 500-550ms post stimulus onset. This baseline window was chosen, with the aid
of visual inspection of the grand-average event-related potential (ERP) waveform, to fall
before the onset of the CPP but after the conclusion of evoked potentials elicited by the
appearance of the stimulus on the screen and the mouse click that initiated the trial.
Trials were rejected if the bipolar vertical EOG signal (upper minus lower) exceeded
an absolute value of 200 μV or if any scalp channel exceeded 100 μV at any time during the
stimulus-aligned epoch. To avoid excessive trial loss, channels were interpolated if their
individual artefact count exceeded 10% of the total number of trials for a given session. To
avoid excessive channel interpolation, a maximum of 10% of the total number of channels
were permitted to be interpolated for any given subject’s data in a given session. Subjects
were excluded from electrophysiological analyses entirely if, following these steps, more
than 40% of trials were lost due to blinks and/or EEG artefacts. In order to mitigate the
effects of volume conduction across the scalp, single-trial epochs underwent current source
density (CSD) transformation (Kayser & Tenke, 2006), a procedure that has been used in
order to minimise spatial overlap between functionally distinct EEG components (Kelly &
O'Connell, 2013).
Stimulus- and response-aligned epochs were then decomposed into time frequency
representations using the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) procedure. Each epoch was
divided up into a series of overlapping 400ms time segments taken at 50-ms intervals across
the epoch. The FFT was computed for each 400-ms segment. For the purpose of data analysis
and plotting, each 400ms segment was identified by its median time point. The resulting
time-frequency representations had a frequency resolution of 2.5 Hz and as such allowed for
the direct measurement of SSVEPs at 20 Hz and 25 Hz, which corresponded to the flicker
frequencies used in experiment 1 for the left- and right-tilted gratings respectively. Each
400ms window captured precisely 8 and 10 cycles of the 20 and 25 Hz SSVEPs respectively,
thereby minimising spectral leakage. FFT power measurements were converted into
amplitude measurements by dividing by half the length of the measurement window in
samples.

Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals

The Effect of Foreperiod Duration on Sensory Evidence Representation
Sensory evidence representation was examined by tracing the time course of the
SSVEPs elicited by the left- and right-tilted stimuli flickering at 20 Hz and 25 Hz
respectively. The SSVEPs were normalised with respect to the average activity in the
immediately adjacent frequencies by computing signal to noise ratios (SNR). In order to
obtain a direct measurement of the sensory evidence upon which observers based their
decisions (i.e. the relative contrast of the overlaid gratings) we then computed the difference
SSVEP (d-SSVEP) by subtracting the non-target SSVEP from the target SSVEP. Based on
visual inspection of the sample grand-average topography of the d-SSVEP (calculated at
approximately 200ms prior to response) we identified a broad cluster of electrodes over the
occipital cortex (centered around Oz) at which the d-SSVEP was maximal (figure 2a). At the
single-subject level we then measured the SSVEPs by averaging data from the four electrodes
within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average d-SSVEP was maximal. Single trial
data were rejected from subsequent analyses if the d-SSVEP prior to response exceeded +/- 3
standard deviations from the within subject mean.
To determine whether foreperiod duration had any effect on sensory evidence
representation the SSVEPs were examined as a function of foreperiod duration in the
following windows: i) 500ms post evidence onset and ii) 200ms prior to response. Trials
were excluded from this analysis if subjects responded quicker than 500ms in order to ensure
that response-aligned SSVEP measurements did not include time windows prior to the
contrast change and that post evidence measurements overlapped minimally with time points
post response. This analysis was carried out using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs
(factor 1: foreperiod duration; factor 2:stimulus). Effects of foreperiod duration on the dSSVEP were inferred from the interaction between foreperiod duration and stimulus factors.
We predicted that the target and non-target SSVEPs should undergo antithetical changes in
SNR after the contrast change giving rise to a main effect of stimulus.

The Effect of Foreperiod Duration on Pre-Evidence Decision Formation
Domain-general decision formation was examined by measuring the dynamics of the
CPP. Based on visual inspection of the sample grand-average topography of the pre-response
CPP (response aligned window: -150ms : -50ms) we identified a broad cluster of electrodes
over the centroparietal cortex (centered around Pz) at which the CPP was maximal (figure 3a;
6a). For each subject, the CPP was measured by averaging data from the four electrodes
within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average was maximal. Effector selective
decision formation was examined by measuring desynchronisation in the Mu/Beta frequency
band (10 - 30 Hz) over the contralateral and ipsilateral response hemispheres (20 Hz and 25
Hz were excluded in order to avoid mixing motor and sensory activity). In order to measure
its excursion and minimise the effects of general changes in amplitudes across testing
sessions, Mu/Beta was baseline-corrected relative to 550ms post stimulus onset. This window
was chosen with the aid of visual inspection of the grand average waveforms to ensure that
the motor activity relating to the mouse button click at the beginning of each trial in
experiment 1 was fully resolved. The Mu/Beta lateralisation index was computed by
subtracting ipsilateral from contralateral Mu/Beta. Based on inspecting the grand average
topography of pre response Mu/Beta lateralisation (response aligned window: -150 : -50ms),
a cluster of electrodes was identified in each hemisphere over premotor regions of the scalp
(C3 left hemisphere; C4 right hemisphere; figure 3h; 6h) that exhibited the largest
lateralisation index. For each subject Mu/Beta was measured by averaging data from the four
electrodes within this cluster, at which the subject grand-average was maximal. Single trial
CPP and Mu/Beta data were rejected from subsequent analyses if the values estimated prior
to response exceeded +/- 3 standard deviations from the within-subject mean.
Inspection of grand average CPP and lateralised Mu/Beta waveforms indicated that
there was substantial build-up of both signals during the foreperiod on longer foreperiod trials
suggesting that decision formation may have commenced prematurely on those trials. To
investigate this phenomenon we initially pooled data from correct, incorrect, missed and
premature response trials and separated the data according to foreperiod duration. We
examined the amount of pre-evidence build-up in each signal by calculating the average
amplitude of each signal within a 100ms window centered on the time of the sensory change.
We also measured the rate of build-up during the foreperiod as the slope of a line fit to the
waveforms between -250ms and 50ms relative to the sensory change. In order to determine
whether there was significant pre-evidence decision related activity, the slope and amplitude

of CPP and Mu/Beta lateralisation at each level of foreperiod duration were compared against
0 using one-sample t-tests. We repeated this analysis for long foreperiod trials using only data
from experimental session 1. Next, we divided the data into equally sized bins based on RT
(6 bins in experiment 1; 3 bins in experiment 2) and examined the relationship between RT
and pre-evidence decision related activity (amplitude and slope as defined above) using twoway repeated measures ANOVAs including foreperiod duration and RT bin as factors.

The Effect of Foreperiod Duration on Pre-Response Decision Related Activity
Decision formation dynamics were further investigated relative to response. The
build-up rate of the CPP was measured by calculating the slope of a line fit to the waveform
in the window -500ms to -200ms relative to response. The build-up rate of Mu/Beta
lateralisation was examined by measuring the slope of a line fit to the lateralisation indices
contained within the window -500ms to -200ms relative to response. We measured the
amplitude of the CPP and magnitude of Mu/Beta desynchronisation and lateralisation prior to
response in the window -150:-50ms. Contralateral and ipsilateral Mu/Beta were examined
separately so as to evaluate preparation of both the chosen and unchosen responses. As
before, the data were separated according to foreperiod duration and RT and analysed using
two-way repeated measures ANOVAs.

Examining the Relationship Between Motion Energy & Premature Sensory Evidence
Accumulation (Experiment 2)
In experiment 2 we sought to establish a relationship between cumulative motion
energy during the foreperiod and pre-evidence CPP build-up. To this end, focusing
exclusively on long foreperiod (1600ms) trials, we separated trials into two equally sized
bins according to the steepness (slope) of the dot motion integral. This yielded a subset of
trials in which the cumulative motion energy during the foreperiod strongly and consistently
favoured either leftward or rightward motion by change and a subset of trials where the
cumulative motion energy fluctuated closer to 0, favouring neither direction consistently.
Single sample t-tests were first carried out, comparing the pre-evidence CPP amplitude and
slope against 0, in order to determine whether there was any significant build-up of the CPP
during the foreperiod on steep or shallow integral trials. The amplitude of the CPP was

measured in a 100ms window centred on coherent motion onset while the slope was
measured in a broad window of 600-1600ms. To distinguish between the CPP on steep and
shallow pre-evidence integral trials, additional paired samples t-tests were carried out
comparing the amplitude and slope of the CPP between shallow and steep integral trials.

Examining The Effect of Previous Trial Foreperiod on Accumulation Onset Timing
In order to examine the sequential effect of foreperiod on evidence accumulation, the
single trial data from experiment were subsequently further subdivided according to the
duration of the foreperiod on the previous trial (foreperiodn-1) and the duration of the
foreperiod on the current trial (foreperiodn). At the behavioural level accuracy and response
times were examined using two-way repeated measures ANOVAs including foreperiodn-1 and
foreperiodn as separate independent factors. Missed response rate and premature response rate
were examined using one-way repeated measures ANOVAs including only foreperiodn-1 as
an independent factor. The exclusion of foreperiodn as a factor in these analyses was
necessary because missed responses were made almost exclusively on short foreperiodn trials
while premature responses were made almost exclusively on long foreperiodn-1 trials. At the
neural level we also further analysed the CPP as a function of foreperiod n-1 in order to
determine whether the amount or rate of build-up, in either the pre-evidence onset or preresponse windows, was modulated by the duration of the previous trial foreperiod.
Examining Target Selection Signals Under Temporal Uncertainty
The target selection process was examined by measuring the bilateral N2 which is
thought to play a role in triggering the onset of evidence accumulation (Loughnane et al.,
2016). Based on visual inspection of the sample grand-average topography of the ERP in the
window 200ms to 300ms post sensory change we identified a broad cluster of electrodes over
the bilateral occipital cortex at which negative going activity was maximal (supplementary
figure 2a; 3a). For each subject, the N2 was measured by averaging data from 3 electrodes
centered on P7 and 3 electrodes centered on P8 at which the negativity was greatest. To
establish whether target selection mechanisms were reliably elicited by the sensory change in
this task we compared the amplitude of the N2, measured in the window 200ms-300ms post
sensory change, against 0 using separate single sample t-tests for each level of foreperiod.
