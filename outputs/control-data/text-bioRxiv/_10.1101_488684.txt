Abstract

12

Parents can have profound effects on offspring fitness. Little, however, is known about the

13

mechanisms through which parental genetic variation influences offspring physiology in natural

14

systems. White-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis, WTSP) exist in two genetic morphs,

15

tan and white, controlled by a large polymorphic supergene. Morphs mate disassortatively,

16

resulting in two pair types: tan male x white female (TxW) pairs, which provide biparental care

17

and white male x tan female (WxT) pairs, which provide female-biased care. To investigate how

18

parental composition impacts offspring, we performed RNA-seq on whole blood of WTSP

19

nestlings sampled from nests of both pair types. Parental pair type had a large effect on nestling

20

gene expression, with 881 genes differentially expressed (DE) and seven correlated gene co-

21

expression modules. The DE genes and modules up-regulated in WxT nests with female-biased

22

parental care primarily function in metabolism and stress-related pathways resulting from the

23

overrepresentation of proteolysis and stress response genes (e.g. SOD2, NR3C1). These results

24

show that parental genotypes and/or associated behaviors influence nestling physiology, and

25

highlight avenues of further research investigating the ultimate implications for the maintenance

26

of this polymorphism. Nestlings also exhibited morph-specific gene expression, with 92

27

differentially expressed genes, comprising innate immunity genes and genes encompassed by the

28

supergene. Remarkably, we identified the same regulatory hub genes in these blood-derived

29

expression networks as were previously identified in adult WTSP brains (EPM2A, BPNT1,

30

TAF5L). These hub genes were located within the supergene, highlighting the importance of this

31

gene complex in structuring regulatory networks across diverse tissues.

Introduction
Parents can have profound impacts on offspring development and fitness. Parental effects

38

can manifest throughout the developmental period, both pre- and post-natally (reviewed in

39

Meaney 2001, Lupien et al. 2009) and can be mediated through parental behaviors, genetics and

40

physiology during early development (Trivers 1972). Parents play a substantial role in

41

establishing the early life environment of offspring. For example in birds, parental decisions on

42

nest placement, incubation behavior, and nest defense could strongly impact developmental

43

conditions of the egg. These parental behaviors will impact exposure to sunlight, humidity,

44

temperature, and other environmental impacts of the eggs, which can influence developmental

45

physiology (e.g. Nord & Nilsson 2011). In addition to parental behaviors, prenatal effects often

46

arise via physiological maternal effects. Developing offspring are susceptible to the maternally

47

created environment (e.g. maternal hormones, immune state, nutrition), which influence

48

offspring physiology (Mousseau & Fox 1998, Jacquin et al. 2012; reviewed in Gluckman et al.

49

2008, Wolf & Wade 2009, Cottrell & Secki 2009).

50

The magnitude of parental effects, particularly in altricial species, is likely largest during

51

the postnatal period, when offspring rely entirely on the parents for provisioning and growth

52

(Royle et al. 2012). Provisioning plays a prominent role in offspring development, with the

53

quality and quantity of food items crucial for offspring development (van Oers et al. 2015,

54

Griebel et al. 2019). Similar to the prenatal stage, parental behaviors could also have strong

55

impacts on offspring physiology. In many species, offspring are left alone during parental

56

foraging trips, increasing environmental exposure (Lloyd and Martin 2004) and predation risk

57

(Lima 2009). Parental separation can also increase offspring anxiety (Millstein & Holmes 2007).

58

Siblings must also compete to optimize provisioning, brooding warmth, and preening (Mock &

59

Parker 1997). Thus, this postnatal environment, largely mediated through parental effects, can be

60

a potential source of early life stress (ELS) in offspring, which may result in life-long fitness

61

effects (reviewed in Monaghan 2014).

62

ELS has broad effects on organisms, including impaired neural development,

63

neuroendocrine signaling, behavior, and physiology (McEwen 2007, Monaghan 2014). For

64

example, ELS is associated with impaired neuroendocrine function and corresponding impaired

65

hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) development, which leads to increase stress response

66

sensitivity later in life (e.g. Heim et al. 2008, Spencer et al. 2009, Crespi et al. 2012, Spencer

67

2017). ELS can exacerbate behavioral alterations as organisms develop and mature including

68

symptoms of anxiety and depression in the postnatal environment (Noguera et al. 2017) and

69

result in impaired behavior as reproductive adults (e.g. Krause et al. 2009, reviewed in Bolton et

70

al. 2017). While the organismal effects of ELS are well studied, the genetic underpinnings are

71

relatively underexplored. Much of the genetic work in the context of ELS has focused on gene

72

regulatory impacts, particularly in mammalian biomedical models (reviewed in Szyf et al. 2007,

73

Szyf 2009, Silberman et al. 2016, Alyamani & Murgatroyd 2018). In particular, the quality of

74

parental care can have strong impacts on offspring health resulting from epigenetic modifications

75

(Liu et al. 1997, Meaney 2001, Weaver et al. 2004). These gene regulation studies primarily use

76

changes in DNA methylation as an indicator of ELS (Murgatroyd et al. 2009, Kinnally et al.

77

2011, Lewis & Olive 2014) and recent work has expanded these approaches into non-mammalian

78

organisms (e.g. Rubenstein et al. 2016, Moghadam et al. 2017, Pértille et al. 2017, Gott 2018,

79

Sheldon et al. 2018). DNA methylation studies of ELS investigate changes to the structure of

80

DNA, but are often limited in the functional implications of ELS (i.e. transcription and

81

translation). In general, these modifications are thought to alter transcriptional activity of genes

82

in the modified genomic region (Berger 2007, Lowdon et al. 2016). Indeed, several studies have

83

also taken candidate gene approaches to investigating gene expression in the context of ELS

84

(Marco et al. 2014, Diaz-Real et al. 2017, Anastasiadi et al. 2018, Reshetnikov et al. 2018).

85

However, very few studies assess genome-wide transcription under ELS (Moghadam et al.

86

2017), particularly in the context of parental effects (but see: Weaver et al. 2006).

87

In this study, we examined the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis, WTSP) to

88

assess the role of parental genotype on offspring gene expression. WTSPs exist in two plumage

89

morphs, tan (T) and white (W), that are found in both sexes and in roughly equal frequencies

90

(Lowther 1961). These morphs are genetically determined by alternative alleles of a supergene, a

91

group of linked genes that are inherited together, show limited recombination, and maintain

92

complex behavioral traits (i.e. WTSP morphs; Schwander et al. 2014, Taylor & Campagna 2016).

93

The WTSP supergene resulted from a complex chromosomal rearrangement comprising multiple

94

inversions (hereafter referred to as “inversion” or “inverted”). This inversion contains ~1,100

95

genes on chromosome two, termed ZAL2 m (Throneycroft 1975, Thomas et al. 2008, Romanov et

96

al. 2009, Tuttle et al. 2016). W morphs are nearly always heterozygous for the inversion

97

(ZAL2/ZAL2m) and T morphs are always homozygous (ZAL2/ZAL2; Thorneycroft 1966, 1975).

98

99

This unusual polymorphism in WTSPs influences hormonal profiles and the behavior of
both sexes, and thus has the potential to influence pre- and post-natal environments for the

100

offspring of different morphs. W morph males maintain higher levels of testosterone during the

101

pre-laying, incubation, and brooding stages and oestradiol during the laying and brooding stages

102

(Horton et al. 2014). Only oestradiol has been shown to differ between adult female morphs

103

during the breeding season and is higher in W morph females during the pre-laying and laying

104

stages (Horton et al. 2014). These genetic and hormonal differences also translate into striking

105

behavioral differences. W morphs, for example, are highly territorial and sing frequently whereas

106

T morphs are far less territorial and aggressive (Lowther 1962, Kopachena & Falls 1993, Tuttle

107

2003, Horton & Holberton 2010, Horton et al. 2014). More importantly from the perspective of

108

offspring, males of each morph also differ in paternal investment (Knapton & Falls 1983, Horton

109

et al. 2014). W morph males are promiscuous and provision nestlings very little. T morph males

110

defend their within-pair paternity through mate guarding and are highly paternal. Females tend to

111

provision at intermediate levels, but T morph females may compensate for unassisted care from

112

W morph males and provision more than W morph females (Knapton & Falls 1983). A final

113

wrinkle in this complex mating system is that morphs nearly always mate with the opposite

114

morph (98.5%, Tuttle et al. 2016), resulting in two stable pair types: T male x W female (TxW)

115

and W male x T female (WxT) (Lowther 1961, Tuttle 2003, Tuttle et al. 2016). Because males

116

differ in paternal investment, this results in two distinct parental care strategies. TxW pairs

117

provide biparental care and WxT pairs provide female-biased parental care. In this study we

118

examined gene expression profiles of offspring from both pair-types in order to assess the

119

physiological consequences of variation in parental genotype.

Methods

122

Field based sample collection

123

All nestling whole blood samples in this study came from a breeding population of

124

WTSPs at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station in northern New York, USA (SUNY-ESF,

126

samples collected during the first clutch (June 6 - June 14, 2015), as WTSP males may increase

127

paternal investment in replacement broods (Horton et al. 2014). We collected ~80µL blood in

128

capillary tubes via brachial venipuncture on days 5-7 post-hatch. Approximately 60µL blood was

129

preserved in Longmire’s lysis buffer (Longmire et al. 1992) for genotyping and ~20µL was

130

immediately placed in RNAlater. Within six hours of collection, samples were placed

131

temporarily into liquid nitrogen, before being shipped overnight on dry ice to -80ºC storage until

132

RNA extraction. All animal sampling protocols were approved by the Indiana State University

133

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 562158-1:ET/RG, 562192-1:ET/RG).

134

135

136

Molecular sexing & genotyping
Nestling DNA was extracted from erythrocytes using the DNA IQ® magnetic extraction

137

system (Promega Corp, Madison, WI USA). To determine sex and morph, we used PCR to

138

fluorescently label and amplify a region of the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding gene, and a region

139

of the vasoactive intestinal peptide following Griffiths et al. (1998) and Michopolous et al.

140

(2007). The PCR products were run and analyzed on an ABI PRISMTM 310 genetic analyzer.

141

142

143

RNA extraction, library preparation, & sequencing
We sampled a total of 52 nestlings for RNA extraction, but due to issues with RNA

144

quality after extraction, only 32 were used for sequencing. These samples represent 23 nestlings

145

from eight TxW pairs and nine nestlings from three WxT pairs. Additionally, these data represent

146

18 females, 14 males, 15 T morph, and 17 W morph individuals.

147

148

We removed RNAlater and homogenized whole blood tissue samples with Tri-Reagent
(Molecular Research Company). Total RNA was purified with a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit

(Valencia, CA, USA), followed by DNase treatment and further purification. We quality assessed

150

RNA with an Agilent Bioanalyzer (RIN > 7) (Wilmington, DE, USA). Both library preparation

151

and sequencing were performed at the University of Illinois Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center.

152

A library was prepared for each RNA sample using the Illumina HT TruSeq (San Diego, CA,

153

USA) stranded RNA sample prep kit. Libraries were distributed into four pools with equimolar

154

concentrations and quantitated via qPCR. Each of the pools was sequenced on an individual lane

155

of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 using the Illumina TruSeq SBS sequencing kit v4 producing 100-

156

nucleotide single-end reads.

157

159

Creation of masked reference genome
The WTSP reference genome was generated from a male T morph individual (Tuttle et al.

160

2016). Thus, the reference genome does not contain any sequence data from the ZAL2m

161

inversion. To avoid any potential bias in mapping reads derived from W morph individuals onto

162

a T morph genome, we generated a masked reference genome for this study. To do so, we used

163

previously published whole genome sequences from three W morph adults (Tuttle et al. 2016).

164

Reads were adapter trimmed with Trim Galore! v0.3.8

165

(https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) and aligned to the WTSP reference genome with

166

bwa mem v 0.7.10-r789 (Li 2013). We converted and sorted the resulting SAM alignment to

167

BAM format with samtools view and samtools sort, respectively (samtools v1.2, Li et al. 2009).

168

We then merged all genomic scaffolds corresponding to the ZAL2 m inversion, as identified in

169

Tuttle et al. (2016), with samtools merge. We called SNPs within the inversion using samtools

170

mpileup and bcftools call v 1.2 (Li et al. 2009, Li 2011). We only kept SNPs that were

171

heterozygous in each of the three individuals with SnpSift v 4.3p (Cingolani et al. 2012) and used

172

these SNPs to mask the reference genome with bedtools maskfasta v 2.21.0 (Quinlan & Hall

173

2010).

174

175

176

Quality control, read mapping, differential expression, & gene ontology
We trimmed Illumina sequencing adapters from each of the 32 libraries with Trim

177

Galore! v0.3.8 which uses Cutadapt v1.7.1 (Martin 2011). Trimmed reads were then mapped to

178

the masked reference genome with STAR v2.5.3a (Dobin et al. 2013). The mapping results were

179

then quantified and assigned gene IDs with htseq-count v0.6.0 (Anders et al. 2015) specifying ‘-s

180

reverse’ and ‘-i gene’. We then removed lowly expressed genes by summing the counts for each

181

gene across all 32 samples, dividing by 32 to obtain the study average, and removing genes with

182

an average read count of < 5.

183

All statistical analyses were performed with R v3.5.0 (R Core Team 2013). We first

184

identified outlier samples based on visual inspection of sample distance in a dendrogram within

185

WGCNA (Horvath 2011). Two samples, one T female and one T male representing an entire

186

TxW nest, were identified as outliers and removed from all future analyses (Figure S1). Using

187

the remaining 30 samples, we normalized reads accounting for sequencing depth and assessed

188

differential expression with DEseq2 (Love et al. 2014). We performed variance stabilizing

189

transformation of reads in DEseq2 and performed PCA and hierarchical clustering based on

190

Euclidean distance of gene expression profiles with pcaExplorer v2.6.0 (Marini & Binder 2016).

191

Differential expression analyses utilized pairwise comparisons between nestling morph and pair

192

type (i.e. parental morphs). We controlled for sex in morph comparisons and sex, morph, and

193

nest ID for pair type comparisons. To include nest ID in the pair type comparison, we followed

194

the “individuals nested within groups” guide in the DEseq2 manual. We did not include nestling

195

age in analyses, as most samples were 6 days old (n=21), limiting comparisons with nestlings

196

aged Day 5 (n=3) or Day 7 (n=6). Network analysis (see below) did not reveal any effect of age

197

on variables of interest (morph, pair type; data not shown). We also tested for an interaction

198

between nestling morph and pair type utilizing a grouping variable as outlined in the DEseq2

199

manual. DEseq2 determines differential expression with a Wald test followed by Benjamini &

200

Hochberg (1995) FDR correction. Genes were considered differentially expressed (DE) if the

201

FDR corrected p-value was < 0.10. Details for each model run, including the R code used, are in

202

this project’s GitHub repository.

203

We next tested for gene ontology (GO) enrichment among DE genes with GOrilla (Eden

204

et al. 2007, 2009). For each DEseq2 comparison, we ordered the list of genes based on ascending

205

FDR values, excluding any genes in which DEseq2 did not assign a FDR value. The WTSP

206

genome is not completely annotated, so any loci without a gene symbol were excluded from GO

207

analyses (n=1,926). GOrilla places greater weight on genes located at the top of the list (i.e. DE

208

genes), while accounting for the contribution of each gene in the given comparison. GO

209

categories were considered significantly enriched if the FDR corrected p-value <0.05. GOrilla

210

does not support WTSP annotation; so, all analyses were based on homology to human gene

211

symbols.

212

213

214

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
We used the WGCNA package in R (Zhang & Horvath 2005, Langfelder & Horvath

215

2008) to identify modules of co-expressed genes in our dataset. We first exported variance

216

stabilizing transformed (vst) read counts from DEseq2, removed genes with an average vst < 5

217

averaged across all 30 samples, and imported the subsequent list of 8,982 genes into WGCNA. To

218

build the co-expression matrix, we chose a soft thresholding power (β) value of 12, at which the

219

network reaches scale-free topology (Figure S2). We generated a signed network with minimum

220

module size of 30 genes and merged highly correlated modules (dissimilarity threshold = 0.20,

221

which corresponds to R2 = 0.80). We then correlated the eigengene, which is the first principal

222

component of a module, of these merged modules with external traits (pair type, morph, sex, nest

223

ID). Modules with p < 0.05 were considered significantly correlated with a given trait. For all

224

morph-specific results, we tested for an enrichment of inversion genes with a chi-squared test

225

using a Fisher’s exact test (p < 0.05).

226

To visualize the interaction of genes within a module, we generated the intramodular

227

connectivity (IM) score for each gene, which represents the interconnection of module genes. We

228

exported all IM scores for modules of interest and imported into VisAnt v5.51 (Hu et al. 2013) for

229

visualization. To maximize network clarity, we only plotted the top 300 interactions based on IM

230

scores. Thus, we only visualized the most connected genes. To identify hub genes, we visualized

231

the Degree Distribution (DD) for the network and selected the most connected genes above a

232

natural break in the distribution. This resulted in one to nine hub genes per module.

233

To understand the biological function of modules correlated with traits of interest, we

234

performed a target vs background GO analysis in GOrilla. For each module, we tested the

235

assigned genes for each module against the entire list of 8,982 genes used for the WGCNA

236

analysis. GO categories were significant with a FDR corrected p-value < 0.05.

240

We sequenced each sample to an average depth of 29.4 million reads (range = 16.2-58.5

241

million reads). The 32 libraries were distributed into four pools in equimolar concentration. One

242

pool contained only four samples, which corresponded to the four samples with lowest RNA

243

concentrations. This pool was sequenced to an average depth of 56.17 million reads per library.

244

The remaining three pools were sequenced to an average depth of 25.62 million reads per library.

245

Samples mapped to our masked genome at an average rate of 91.08% (range = 88.19%-92.87%)

246

(Table S1). A total of 8,982 genes had count values ≥ 5 across all samples, which included 641

247

located in the W morph inversion. Samples did not segregate by pair type or morph in PCA or

hierarchical clustering (Figures S3, S4).

Differential Expression – Morph
Ninety-two genes were differentially expressed between morphs. Sixty-five of these

252

genes (71%) were located in the inversion, representing a significant enrichment (χ2=553.73,

253

df=1, p<0.00001) (Table S2). The inversion represents only 641 out the 8,892 genes (7%)

254

sampled here. Additionally, expression of many of these 92 genes was elevated in W morph

255

nestlings and a number of these genes had well-known functions in innate immunity (e.g. IFIT5,

256

IL20RA, EIF2AK2, RSAD2). There was GO enrichment of four categories, two of which are

immunity related: “immune response” (p = 0.019) and “defense response to virus” (p = 0.049)

258

(Table S3).

263

responses were elevated in nestlings in WxT nests, including the glucocorticoid receptor

264

(NR3C1), superoxide dismutase (SOD)1 & SOD2, DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting

265

protein (DEPTOR), and several ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway genes (e.g. UBE2D3,

266

PSMD3, PSMD6). Additionally, several immune system related genes were also elevated in

267

WxT nests, including cytokines (e.g. IL2RA, IL7R), suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1),

268

and five putative major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I loci. No GO categories were

269

significantly enriched, however.

270

We next tested for a morph-specific response to pair type. Within WxT nests, 40 genes

271

were DE (p <0.10) between T and W morph nestlings. Twelve of these genes (30%) are located

272

within the inversion, again reflecting an enrichment of inversion genes among those differentially

273

expressed between morph (χ2=34.44, df=1, p<0.00001). Only two genes (THSD7B & CFAP44)

274

were DE between morphs within TxW nests, both of which are uniquely DE between morphs in

275

TxW nests. No GO categories were enriched in either comparison.

276

277

278

WGCNA – Morph
WGCNA revealed 26 modules, five of which were correlated with morph (Table 1,

279

Figure 1). The light cyan module (183 genes, R2=0.67, p=5x10-5) and ivory module (72 genes,

280

R2=-0.66, p=9x10-5) contained genes elevated and suppressed, respectively, in W morph

281

nestlings relative to T morph nestlings. These modules are both enriched for genes located within

282

the chromosomal inversion (light cyan module = 70/183 (38%) genes, χ2=266.49, df=1,

283

p<0.00001; ivory module = 40/72 (56%), χ2=261.60, df=1, p<0.00001) (Figure S5). The hubs of

284

each of these modules are also located in the chromosomal inversion (Table 1, Figure S5).

285

Additionally, the sky blue module (58 genes, R2=0.53, p=0.003) and dark red module (102 genes,

286

R2=0.47, p=0.009) (Figure S6) contained genes elevated in W morph nestlings and many of these

287

genes overlap with the immune related genes described in the morph DE tests above. The hubs of

288

these networks (e.g. sky blue: EIF2AK2, IFIT5, OASL; dark red: TRAF5) (Table 1) reflect a

289

conserved innate immunity network structure in avian blood (Kernbach et al., in review) (Figure

290

S6).

291

292

WGCNA – Pair Type
We found seven modules correlated with pair type (Table 2, Figure 1). The blue module

293

294

represented genes that are elevated in nestlings from WxT nests (1,142 genes, R2 = -0.45,

295

p=0.01). This module contained both the largest number of genes and correspondingly strongest

296

functional enrichment. Many of these GO enrichments were related to protein function, resulting

297

from the presence of ribosomal genes. Interestingly, several GO categories for metabolism,

298

catabolism, and proteolysis were also enriched, driven by genes encoding ubiquitin-conjugating

299

enzymes and proteasome subunits (e.g. “proteasomal protein catabolic process”, p=2.34x10-4;

300

“proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process”, p=5.32x10-4) (Table S4).

301

Many of these (e.g. PSMF1, PSMD3, PSMD6, UBE2D2, UBE2D3, UBE3C) were also DE

302

between offspring of the two pair types (Figure 2). Lastly, the blue module contains one hub

303

gene, NDUFB3 (DD=42) (Figure 2), which is involved in the mitochondrial electron transport

304

chain.

305

The beige and light green modules represented candidate stress response networks. These

306

modules showed contrasting expression patterns in nestlings from WxT nests (Figures 4 & 5).

307

Although not significantly enriched for any GO categories, the beige module comprised 335

308

genes that were upregulated in WxT nests relative to TxW nests (R2=-0.61, p=3x10-4). DEPTOR,

309

which functions as an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway in response to stress (e.g. Desantis et al.

310

2015), was the single hub in the beige module (DD=39, Figure 3). The beige module also

311

contained NR3C1, which is activated in response to increased glucocorticoid secretion. Lastly,

312

the light green module (116 genes, R2=0.60, p=4x10-4) contained genes with low expression in

313

TxW nests relative to WxT nests. There were three hub genes (DD > 28), CDK19, CHD4, and

314

EPG5, each with previously described roles in the stress response (Figure 4).

315

For each pair type module, the correlation was stronger for the overall effect of pair type

316

than any individual nest, indicating that one nest did not drive the correlation. This trend was

317

reflected in gene expression plots of hub genes and candidate genes described above (Figure S7).

318

We did not observe modules correlated with pair type that were also correlated with nestling

319

morph or sex, suggesting there is no morph or sex-specific response to a given pair type at the

320

network level.

321

322

Discussion

323

By assessing genome-wide transcription in nestlings raised by different WTSP pair types we

324

have identified distinct transcriptomic signatures that suggest WxT pairs induce a stress response

325

in developing nestlings relative to TxW pairs. This is reflected both by differential expression of

326

several genes involved in protein degradation as well as networks of co-expressed genes with

327

stress response hubs. Additionally, we identified morph-specific gene expression driven by

328

innate immunity genes and genes located in the chromosome 2 inversion. As adults, the genes

329

within the inversion strongly influence the WTSP neural transcriptome (Balakrishnan et al. 2014,

330

Zinzow-Kramer et al. 2015). Our results here suggest that as nestlings, parental genotypes and

331

associated behaviors, rather than nestling genotype, have the strongest influence on the nestling

332

transcriptome.

333

334

335

Gene expression differences resulting from pair type
We find 881 genes DE between nestlings raised under the two pair types. Many of these

336

genes function in the proteasome or ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Cells naturally use the

337

proteasome for degradation of proteins targeted by the ubiquitination process, but genes involved

338

in proteasome formation (e.g. PSMD6, PSMD11) and ubiquitination (e.g. UBE2B) are up-

339

regulated in cells experiencing mild oxidative stress (Aiken et al. 2011, Shang & Taylor 2011,

340

Livneh et al. 2016) or organisms experiencing abiotic stress (Dhanasiri et al. 2013, Tomalty et al.

341

2015). Thus, increased expression of these genes in nestlings from WxT nests suggests they are

342

responding to oxidative stress. As a result, there may be a cost to having a W morph father and T

343

morph mother at the nestling stage.

344

To complement our differential expression approach, we also constructed co-expression

345

networks with WGCNA. WGCNA identifies modules of co-regulated genes blind to the

346

experimental design. These modules are then correlated with external traits, offering a systems-

347

level view into how conditions impact transcriptional networks. Within these networks, we can

348

then perform GO analyses as described above and identify network hubs, which are the most

349

highly connected genes within that network. Using this approach, we identified 26 modules of

350

co-regulated genes in this dataset (Figure 1), seven of which were significantly correlated with

351

parental pair type. The blue module contains genes that are elevated in nestlings in WxT nests.

352

The blue module hub gene was NDUFB3 (Module Membership [MM]=0.938, DD=42) (Figure

353

2), which encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain. Interestingly,

16

354

many of the same proteolysis-related genes highlighted in the differential expression results are

355

also present in this module, resulting in the enrichment of several metabolism and stress-related

356

GO categories (Table S4).

357

Two modules, light green and beige, contained stress responsive hub genes. The light

358

green module contains genes that are suppressed in nestlings in WxT nests, with three hub genes:

359

CDK19, CHD4, and EPG5 (Figure 4). The absence of EPG5 expression (via knockout) and

360

reduction in CHD4 expression (via knockdown) has been associated with increased DNA

361

damage (Zhao et al. 2013, Larsen et al. 2010). Similarly, down-regulation of CDK19 following

362

knockdown is associated with an increased stress response (Audetat et al. 2017). Suppression of

363

these genes in these nestlings could be indicative of increased cellular damage. The beige module

364

contains genes whose expression is elevated in nestlings from WxT nests and contains one hub

365

gene, DEPTOR, which is an inhibitor of mTOR signaling (Figure 3). The exact role of DEPTOR

366

remains unclear, but up-regulation likely inhibits the mTORC1 pathway to reduce endoplasmic

367

reticulum stress, promote cell survival, and avoid apoptosis (Peterson et al. 2009, Desantis et al.

368

2015, Catena et al. 2016).

369

Increased expression of genes in the beige module in these nestlings and the high

370

connectivity of DEPTOR to other co-expressed genes provide further support for a

371

transcriptional stress response within WxT nests. The beige module also contains two well-

372

studied stress responsive genes, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and the glucocorticoid receptor

373

(NR3C1). SOD2 mitigates the effects of exposure to reactive oxygen species by scavenging free

374

radicals (Zelko et al. 2002). NR3C1 binds glucocorticoids and has primarily been studied in the

375

context of ELS and methylation of an upstream promoter. NRC3C1 methylation is often

376

associated with down-regulation of NR3C1 (e.g. McGowan et al. 2009) and impairment of the

377

HPA axis, but up-regulation following methylation has also been observed as part of the stress

378

response (Turner et al. 2006, Bockmühl et al. 2015). Increased expression observed here directly

379

implicates the HPA axis and suggests these nestlings may be activating SOD2 and NR3C1 to

380

cope with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and corticosterone, respectively (Wang et al.

381

2018, Finsterwald & Alberini 2014). However, further work is needed to investigate stress

382

physiology, corticosterone levels, and uncover the epigenetic state of NR3C1 in these nestlings

383

and how this may relate to ELS (Banerjee et al. 2011, McCoy et al. 2016, Rubenstein et al. 2016,

384

Quirici et al. 2016, Greggor et al. 2017).

385

386

387

How does parental genotype influence offspring gene expression?
In a non-experimental study, we have limited power to make inferences about the

388

mechanism by which parental genotype impacted offspring gene expression. Given the well-

389

studied reproductive biology of WTSPs, however, two mechanisms seem especially likely:

390

hormone-mediated maternal effects and/or differences in parental provisioning. In weighing the

391

evidence for these two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, we conclude that the difference in

392

parental provisioning is the most plausible explanation for the observed gene expression

393

differences. As described above, WTSP morphs differ in hormone levels. Only oestradiol,

394

however, has been shown to differ between adult female morphs during the breeding season and

395

is higher in W morph females during the pre-laying and laying stages (Horton et al. 2014). No

396

baseline differences in any other hormone measured to date (corticosterone, testosterone, DHEA,

397

DHT) have been described during the breeding season (Spinney et al. 2006, Swett & Breuner

398

2009, Horton & Holberton 2010, Horton et al. 2014). Taken together this suggests that hormone

399

deposition into eggs may not differ dramatically between the morphs. By contrast, there is strong

400

evidence of differences in provisioning among morph types (Knapton & Falls 1983, Kopachna &

401

Falls 1993, Horton & Holberton 2010, Horton et al. 2014). Reduced provisioning by W morph

402

males appears to be stable across populations resulting in female-biased parental care in WxT

403

nests (Knapton & Falls 1983, Horton et al. 2014). Therefore, parental care variation is a likely

404

source of behaviorally mediated maternal or paternal effects (see Crean & Bonduriansky 2014)

405

that would explain the strong signature of stress exposure in the expression data.

406

Previous work revealed no difference in clutch size between pair types (Knapton et al.

407

1984, Formica et al. 2004) and no effect of pair type on nestling mass (Knapton et al. 1984,

408

Tuttle et al. 2017). Also, nestlings did not differ in mass at time of sampling between the TxW

409

and WxT nests used in this study (Smith et al. in review). Increased provisioning by females to

410

compensate for reduced care by males could explain this observation, and this has been observed

411

previously in a separate WTSP population (Knapton & Falls 1983). In this scenario reduced

412

brooding and increased maternal separation could also negatively impact nestling physiology and

413

act as a source of ELS (reviewed in Ledón-Rettig et al. 2013). Somewhat surprisingly, given the

414

gene expression findings described here, a recent study in our study population did not detect

415

differences in reactive oxygen metabolites in plasma of offspring of the two different pair types

416

(Grunst et al. 2019). ROM, however, only provides a limited overview of the stress response and

417

the RNA-seq response we observed could even mitigate long-term consequences of ELS. The

418

results here further highlight the utility of blood RNA-seq as a highly sensitive measure of

419

environmental exposures (Louder et al. 2018).

420

Our study was carried out in the field as part of a long-term study and is limited by the

421

fact that we did not perform a cross-fostering experiment. We aimed to mitigate potential

422

environmental confounds by restricting sampling of nestlings to a short time period of nine days.

423

Certainly the environment may influence gene expression in our samples, but consistent changes

424

among the samples in the two pair types suggest the role of parents is a significant driver of

425

nestling gene expression, rather than temporal or spatial environmental variation.

426

427

Morph-specific gene expression

428

We were also interested in morph-specific gene expression and how nestling morph may

429

respond to differences in parental pair type. WTSPs have been studied extensively as adults, but

430

very rarely in other life stages. W morph males and T morph females exhibit earlier reproductive

431

and actuarial senescence, potentially resulting from the high energy expenditure lifestyle of W

432

morph males and biased parental care given by T morph females (Grunst et al. 2018a, Grunst et

433

al. 2018b). There also appears to be seasonal variation in fitness between the morphs as adults.

434

Following cold, wet winters, W morph males exhibit lower recruitment in the breeding grounds,

435

leading to an overproduction of W morph male nestlings, potentially to stabilize morph

436

frequencies in the population (Tuttle et al. 2017). Thus, morph specific differences may arise in

437

early life. We found 92 genes DE between morphs, including many innate immune-related genes

438

and genes located within the inversion (65/92 genes, Table S2). WGCNA revealed five modules

439

correlated with morph (Figure 1). These included two innate immunity-related modules with

440

increased expression in W morphs (Dark Red & Sky Blue) and two modules enriched with genes

441

located in the inversion (Ivory = 40/72, Light Cyan = 70/183) (Figures S5, S6). The sky blue

442

module contains nine hub genes and the dark red module contains one hub gene, both of which

443

include well-studied anti-viral genes (e.g. sky blue: OASL, RSAD2; dark red: TRAF5). These

444

genes also form a co-expression module in avian blood following West Nile virus infection

445

(Kernbach et al., in review). Adult WTSP morphs differ in their ability to clear infection (Boyd et

20

446

al. 2018), so the immune activation here may be indicative of an increased parasite load in W

447

morph nestlings, although further investigation is required. The light cyan module contains genes

448

elevated in W morph nestlings and contains eight hub genes, each located in the inversion (Table

449

1). Three of these, EPM2A, BPNT1, and TAF5L, were also identified as hub genes in brain

450

tissues of adult W morph males (Zinzow-Kramer et al. 2015). These nestlings thus exhibit

451

expression differences in inversion genes prior to any phenotypic or behavioral differences,

452

revealing the importance of the inversion in maintaining morph phenotypes throughout life.

453

Additionally, the conservation of network hub genes in a different tissue and life stage highlights

454

avenues for further investigation into WTSP gene regulation.

455

Despite broad gene expression differences between the morphs, within pair types morph-

456

specific expression was limited. In part due to small sample size, nestlings in TxW nests only

457

have two genes DE between morphs. There is a larger effect of morph within WxT nests, where

458

the number of DE genes increased to 40. These genes encompassed a wide range of gene

459

functions without any obvious stress-related candidate genes. Of these 40 genes, 34 are uniquely

460

DE within WxT nests and do not overlap with the overall list of 92 genes DE between morphs

461

using all samples. Interestingly, glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) is elevated in W

462

morph nestlings in WxT nests. The function of GLCCI1 remains unclear (Kim et al. 2016), but

463

expression differences between morphs observed here implicates the role of glucocorticoids in

464

response to pair type. This suggests that nestling morphs may respond differently to the parental

465

pair type though larger sample sizes will be needed to explore this further.

468

Using the WTSP, a system with alternative parental care strategies, we show that

469

nestlings in WxT nests (female-biased parental care) have increased expression of stress-related

470

genes, and parental genotypes may act as a source of ELS in the species. Nestling morph also

471

influences transcription, but parental pair type appears to have the greatest effect on their

472

transcriptome. Combined, this supports the parental effects hypothesis (Wade 1998, Schrader et

473

al. 2018), where offspring phenotypes are primarily a result of the nest environment and care

474

received, rather than from offspring genotypes (i.e. T vs. W). Nearly 54% of observed pairs have

475

been WxT (Tuttle et al. 2016). Thus, roughly half of the nestlings in every population will

476

experience female-biased parental care. Our results suggest that these differences in parental pair

477

type have at least short-term consequences on offspring physiology. While we have identified

478

impacts at the level of transcription, an integrative approach assessing nestling WTSP physiology

479

and performing cross-fostering experiments will further elucidate the consequences of variation

480

in parental pair type. Importantly, it remains unclear whether female-biased parental care or

481

differences in maternal effects translate into long-term fitness consequences for offspring. There

482

appears to be a cost associated with parental genotype, as less cooperative reproductive strategy

483

(WxT pairs) accelerates senescence (Grunst et al. 2018a, Grunst et al. 2018b). We show here that

484

this cost is also translated into nestlings within WxT nests via increased stress-related gene

485

expression. This work sets the stage to further explore morph-specific fitness consequences in

486

nestlings experiencing alternative parental care strategies.
