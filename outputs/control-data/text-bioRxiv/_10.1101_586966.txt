Abstract
MCT4 is an H+-coupled transporter expressed in metastatic cancer cells, macrophages, and other
highly glycolytic cells, where it extrudes excess lactate generated by the Warburg phenomenon or
by hypoxia. Intriguingly, its reported Km for lactate, obtained with pH-sensitive probes, is more
than an order of magnitude higher than physiological lactate. Here we examined MCT4-rich MDAMB-231 cells using the FRET sensor Laconic and found a median Km for lactate uptake of only 1.7
mM, while parallel estimation in the same cells with a pH probe gave a Km of 27 mM. The median
Km of MCT4 for lactate was 0.7 mM in MCT4-expressing HEK293 cells and 1.2 mM in human
macrophages, suggesting that high substrate affinity is a robust property of the transporter.
Probed with the FRET sensor Pyronic, MCT4 showed a Km for pyruvate of only 4.2 mM in MDA-MB231 cells, as opposed to > 150 mM reported previously. We conclude that prior estimates of MCT4
affinity based on pH probes were severely biased by the confounding action of pH regulatory
mechanisms. Numerical simulation showed that MCT4, but not MCT1 or MCT2, endows cells with
the capability of lactate extrusion in high lactate environments. The revised kinetic properties and
novel transport assays may help in developing small-molecule MCT4 blockers for research and
therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer cells ferment glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon originally
described by Otto Warburg and colleagues in the 1920s and later found to promote tumor growth
and malignancy 1-4. In addition to fostering glycolysis by end-product removal, cytosolic
alkalinization and NAD+ recycling, the co-extrusion of lactate and protons causes interstitial
acidification, which along lactate itself favors tumor invasiveness and facilitates immune response
evasion 5. Lactate levels were double in cervical tumors with metastatic spread compared with
malignancies in patients without metastases 6. Lactic acid release is also a physiological process, as
in exercising skeletal muscle, in active macrophages and in brain astrocytes 7-9. The transport of
lactate in most mammalian cells is mediated by members of the SLC16A family of H+-coupled
monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 10. Malignant tumors overexpress MCT1 (SLC16A1) and/or
MCT4 (SLC16A3), the latter being characteristic of metastatic cancer in association with HIF1α upregulation 11. Potent small-molecule inhibitors specific for MCT1-2 have been synthetized,
one of which is currently undergoing a Phase I clinical trial 12. However, the development of MCT4specific drugs is lagging.
MCT4-endowed cells, both healthy and cancerous, are the strongest lactate producers. So it seems
puzzling that, at about 30 mM 10, 13, 14, the Km of MCT4 for lactate is more than one order of
magnitude higher than the levels of lactate prevailing in tissues and even within hypoxic tumors 6,
15
. Taken at face value, this means that MCT4 runs at a small fraction of its capacity. In contrast,
MCT1 has a Km of 3-5 mM 10. Kinetic transport parameters are determined by measuring initial
rates of uptake at increasing concentrations of radiolabeled substrate. Unfortunately, this is not
practical for MCTs in mammalian cells, because uptake is too fast, demanding high levels of
radioactivity and sophisticated stop-flow devices. The introduction of pH-sensitive dyes in the
1980s revolutionized the field by permitting MCT activity determinations with high spatiotemporal
resolution 16, 17. With the additional advantage that any substrate could be studied with the same
probe, most of what we know about the functionality of the monocarboxylate transporters was
learnt from substrate-induced acidification. However, there was a caveat. In order to obtain
detectable acidifications, experiments had to be done in the absence of bicarbonate.
Genetically-encoded FRET nanosensors have been recently used by several laboratories to directly
monitor lactate and pyruvate dynamics in various cell types, in vitro and in vivo 18-27. During the
characterization of a MCT4-rich cell line with a FRET sensor we detected robust transport at low
lactate concentrations. The present manuscript describes a set of experiments prompted by that
observation.

METHODS
Standard reagents and inhibitors were acquired from Sigma or Merck. Plasmids encoding the
sensors Laconic 18 and Pyronic 19 are available from Addgene (www.addgene.org). Ad Laconic and
Ad Pyronic (serotype 5) were custom made by Vector Biolabs.

Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 cells were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured
at 37 oC without CO2 in Leibovitz medium (ThermoFisher). Cultures were transfected at 60%
confluence using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) or alternatively, exposed to 5 x 106 PFU of Ad
Laconic or Ad Pyronic and studied after 24-72 h. The generation of the MDA-LAC cell line will be
described elsewhere (Mito Toxy reporter; Contreras et al, submitted doi:
https://doi.org/10.1101/583096). HEK293 cells were acquired from the ATCC and cultured at 37 oC
in 95% air/5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were
transfected at 60% confluence using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) and studied after 24-72
h. To obtain macrophages, blood was collected by venepuncture from ten healthy male
volunteers. Age of donors ranged from 25 to 45 years. Ethical guidelines stipulated by the
Declaration of Helsinki principles were adhered to. Approval was obtained from the Medical
Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile. All donors were
informed about the nature of the studies and gave their written consent to participate. Samples
were treated anonymously. Monocytes were isolated from whole blood treated with 3.8% sodium
citrate, by PercollTM density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Sweden). Macrophage
differentiation of human monocytes was induced by treatment with 25 nM macrophage colonystimulating factor for seven days. Human monocytes-derived macrophages were treated with 100
ng/mL IFN-γ and 10 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for M1 differentiation for 48 h. After isolation
cells were maintained in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
pyruvate. Cytokines were obtained from PeproTech (USA), LPS (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
was from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). For lactate measurements, macrophages maintained in culture for
6 to 7 days were incubated for 24 h with 7x1010 PFU Ad Laconic and imaged 6-7 days later.

Imaging
Cells were imaged at 35 oC in a 95% air/5% CO2-gassed KRH-bicarbonate buffer of the following
composition (in mM): 112 NaCl, 3mM KCl, 1.25 CaCl2, 1.25 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, 24 NaHCO3, pH 7.4.
Alternatively, NaHCO3 was equimolarly replaced with NaCl. Glucose, lactate, pyruvate and
inhibitors were added as indicated in the figure legends. Laconic and Pyronic were imaged using
an upright Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope equipped a 20X water immersion objective (NA
1.0). Laconic and Pyronic were imaged at 440 nm excitation/480 ± 15 nm (mTFP) and 550 ± 15
(Venus) emissions. BCECF was ester-loaded at 0.1 µM for 3–4 min and the signal was calibrated by

exposing the cultures to solutions of different pH after permeabilizing the cells with 10 µg/ml
nigericin and 20 µg/ml gramicidin in an intracellular buffer. BCECF was sequentially excited at 440
and 490 nm (0.05 s) and imaged at 535/30 nm using an Olympus BX51 microscope (20X water
immersion objective, NA 0.95) equipped with a CAIRN monochromator and Optosplit II
(Faversham, UK) and a Hamamatsu Rollera camera.

Immunodetection
For immunoblotting cultured cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1X)
followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was then suspended in
cold RIPA 1X (radioimmune precipitation assay) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 0.1 mM
phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pestatin A).
After 30 min on ice, unlysed cells and nuclei were pelletted at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The
protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay using BSA
standards. Protein samples (50 µg) were loaded onto 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
electrotransferred onto nitrocelulose membranes. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-MCT4 (1:250;
AB3314P, Merck Millipore), mouse anti- β-actin (1:2,000; 8H10D10, Cell Signaling), peroxidaseconjugated antirabbit (1:20,000; 111-035-144, Jackson) and peroxidase-conjugated antimouse
(1:20,000; #7076, Cell Signaling). Signals were revealed using a chemiluminescence kit
(SuperSignal™ West Femto, ThermoFisher), following the instructions of the manufacturer. For
immunocytochemistry macrophages fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.1% PBS-Triton X-100 were blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) plus 10% Normal Goat
Serum (Vector Laboratories). Samples were probed with a primary antibody against MCT4 (1:1000;
AB3314P, Merck Millipore and AlexaFluor488 secondary antibody (1:2000; A11008, Invitrogen).
Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:50,000; D3571, Invitrogen). Samples
were embedded into fluorescence mounting medium (Dako) and analyzed by confocal microscopy
(Leica DMi8, Leica Microsystems) using a 63x oil objective. Image analysis was performed using
Leica and ImageJ software.

Mathematical modeling
Cellular lactate and pyruvate dynamics were simulated using Berkeley Madonna software and the
following set of ordinary differential equations,
(Eq. 1) dTout/dt = KoffH*THout + f1*Tin - Kon*Tout*Hout - f1*Tout
(Eq. 2) dTin/dt = Kon* THin + f1*Tout - Kon* Tin*Hi - f1*Tin
(Eq. 3)

dTHout/dt = Kon*Tout*Hout + KoffL*THLout + KoffP*THPout - KoffH*THout - Kon*THout*Lout - Kon*THout*Pout

where equations 1 to 8 represent the eight possible conformations of the MCT carrier: outwardand inward-facing, either empty (Tout and Tin), loaded with a proton (THout and THin), loaded with
both proton and lactate (THLout and THLin) and loaded with both proton and pyruvate (THPout and
THPin). Equations 9 and 10 represent cytosolic lactate and pyruvate. The association constant Kon
for protons, lactate and pyruvate was set at 108 M-1 *s-1 for the three isoforms (diffusion-limited);
respective dissociation constants KoffH, KoffL and KoffP were 20 s-1, 7.6*107 s-1 and 7.6*106 s-1 for
MCT1, 20 s-1, 7.6*106 s-1 and 7.6*105 s-1 for MCT2, and 20 s-1, 2.4*107 s-1 and 6.4*107 s-1 for MCT4.
Carrier translocation rates f1 (empty) and f2 (loaded) were set at 200 s-1 and 3000 s-1. Rate
constants were 0.01 s-1 (Mito, mitochondrial pyruvate import), 0.5 s-1 (LDHforward, pyruvate to
lactate) and 0.025 s-1 (LDHreverse, lactate to pyruvate). With these parameters and cytosolic and
extracellular pH values of 7.2 (63 nM) and 7.4 (40 nM), apparent zero-trans Km (Kzt) values for
lactate and pyruvate uptake were: 5 and 0.5 mM for MCT1, 0.5 and 0.05 mM for MCT2, and 1.7
and 4.2 mM for MCT4.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out with SigmaPlot software (Jandel). For normally distributed
variables, differences were assessed with the Student´s t-test (pairs) and with ANOVA followed by
the Tukey-Kramer ad hoc test (groups). For variables that failed the normality test, differences
were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA on ranks (groups). *, p < 0.05; ns (nonsignificant), p > 0.05. The number of experiments and cells is detailed in each figure legend.

RESULTS
MCT4 mediates monocarboxylate transport in MDA-MB-231 cells
To study the functional properties of MCT4, we expressed the genetically-encoded FRET lactate
sensor Laconic 18 in MDA-MB-231 cells, a human breast cancer cell line conspicuous for its high
levels of MCT4 28, 29. Fig. 1A shows MDA-LAC, a cell line generated with MDA-MB-231 cells stably
expressing Laconic. Fig. 1B shows that the abundance of MCT4 in these cells is almost as high as
that achieved by overexpressing MCT4 in HEK293 cells under the strong CMV promoter, and that
MCT4 levels are not diminished by expression of the FRET sensor. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells
to a lactate load caused a rapid increase in intracellular lactate, demonstrative of high
permeability (Fig. 1C). The functionality of MCT4 was tested by pharmacological means. As there
are no commercially available inhibitors specific for MCT4, we tested compounds of overlapping
selectivity. pCMBS, which inhibits MCT1 and MCT4 but not MCT2 30, caused lactate accumulation
(Fig. 1C). In contrast AR-C155858 31, which blocks MCT1 and MCT2 but not MCT4, had no effect
(Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results show that the tonic export of lactate by MDA-MB-231 cells
is mediated by MCT4. The insensitivity to AR-C155858 is in agreement with the reported absence
of detectable MCT1 expression in these cells 28, 29. Next, the effect of the pharmacological
inhibitors was tested on lactate uptake. Consistent with the efflux data, pCMBS blocked the
uptake of lactate while AR-C155858 did not (Figs. 2A-B). Moreover, diclofenac, a structurallyunrelated MCT1 & MCT4 blocker 32, also abrogated the influx of lactate whereas AZD3965 33, a
structurally-unrelated blocker of MCT1 & MCT2 (but not of MCT4), had no effect (Figs. 2C-D).
These results provide functional confirmation that MCT4 is responsible for the bidirectional
transport of lactate across the plasma membrane of MDA-MB-231 cells.

MCT4 of MDA-MB-231 cells is a high affinity lactate/pyruvate transporter
The affinity of MCT4 for lactate was determined by exposing MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the
FRET lactate sensor to an increasing extracellular concentration of lactate, as described previously
in MCT1-expressing cardiomyocytes 20. Control uptakes were included at the beginning and end of
the protocol to ensure that measurements were reproducible (data not shown). As illustrated in
Fig. 3A, robust lactate uptake was already apparent at low lactate concentrations. Plotting uptake
rates against lactate concentration revealed Km values in the low milimolar range (Fig. 3B). To
investigate possible confounding effects of experimental conditions, the protocol was repeated in
the presence and absence of bicarbonate, at 23 oC and at 35 oC, and in the absence and presence
of AR-C155858 (to eliminate possible minor contributions of MCT1 and MCT2), in cells in which
Laconic was expressed by transfection, an adenoviral vector, or in a stable cell line. As no strong
differences under these experimental conditions were detected, the data were pooled together.
The median Km for the uptake of lactate was 1.7 mM. In view of this inordinate high affinity for
lactate, an analogous experimental approach was applied to characterize the transport of
pyruvate, using the FRET sensor Pyronic 19. Reportedly, the affinity of MCT4 for pyruvate is so low
that it lies beyond the measurable range (> 150 mM 34). However, we obtained a median Km of 4.2

mM (Fig. 4). Thus, the affinity of MCT4 for lactate and pyruvate in MDA-MB-231 cells was found to
be over one order of magnitude higher than anticipated.

Bicarbonate interferes with pH estimation of MCT4 activity
To evaluate MCT4 activity from its effects on intracellular pH, MDA-MB-231 cells were loaded with
the pH-sensitive dye BCECF. Exposure to lactate did acidify the cells, but in contrast with the
accumulation of lactate measured directly with the FRET sensor, the acidification was highly
sensitive to bicarbonate (Fig. 5A). In bicarbonate, the rate of acidification induced by lactate did
not show saturation. On the contrary, it jumped by a factor of 8 between lactate exposure of 10
and 20 mM. This non-linear behavior suggests that at 20 mM lactate the flux via MCT4 surpassed
the capacity of the cells to muffle protons (Fig. 5B). When bicarbonate was replaced with the
impermeant buffer HEPES (no HCO3), intracellular pH became more sensitive to lactate challenges
and some degree of saturation appeared (Fig. 5A-B). A median Km of 27 mM (26 cells three
experiments) could be estimated, which is not deemed accurate as it lies beyond the highest
lactate concentration applied. Still, this high Km is in agreement with previous determinations of
MCT4 lactate affinity in several cell types using pH, which range from 30 to 40 mM 34, 35. When
BCECF-loaded MDA-MB-231 cell were challenged with pyruvate the results were similar:
insensitivity in the presence of bicarbonate and responses being detected in the absence of
bicarbonate only at > 5 mM pyruvate (Fig. 5B). There was no apparent saturation of the rate of
acidification with or without bicarbonate, so that Km values could not be estimated, as reported 34,
35
. Of note, bicarbonate omission should not be expected to eliminate the problem of buffering,
because bicarbonate represents a minor fraction of the buffering power of mammalian cells 36, 37.
In addition to buffering, mammalian cells possess efficient systems for the extrusion of protons,
including carbonic anhydrase, Na+/H+ exchangers and Na+/bicarbonate cotransporters, some of
which have recently been found strategically located in the vicinity of MCTs 38. We conclude that
buffering/muffling reduces the impact of MCT4-mediated proton transport on intracellular pH,
particularly at low substrate concentrations, introducing a bias in the determination of affinity.

Recombinant MCT4 is also a high affinity lactate transporter
To explore the functional properties of recombinant MCT4, we used HEK293 cells. They possess
abundant MCT1 18 but it is still possible to use them to characterize a foreign transporter if the
endogenous MCT1 is blocked pharmacologically, as recently demonstrated for the identification of
a Drosophila melanogaster monocarboxylate carrier 25. As expected, the uptake of lactate by wild
type HEK293 cells was blocked by AR-C155858 (Fig. 6A). Beyond our expectations, overexpression
of MCT4 rendered the cells insensitive to the MCT1/2 blocker (Fig. 6B). We do not know how
MCT4 overexpression suppressed the functionality of native MCT1 to such an extent, a
phenomenon that may be of physiological interest, as MCT1 and MCT4 may co-exist in the same
cells and use the same chaperone basigin/CD147 to reach the plasma membrane 30. A dominant

role for MCT4 was confirmed by full inhibition of lactate uptake by diclofenac (Fig. 6B). Still,
transport affinity was determined in the presence of AR-C155858 to ensure lack of MCT1 & MCT2
function. We found that HEK293-MCT4 cells transport lactate with a median Km of 0.7 mM (Figs.
6C-E). Thus, high substrate affinity is also a property of recombinant MCT4.

High affinity MCT4-mediated lactate transport in human macrophages
The Warburg effect is important for the activation and operation of macrophages 39, 40, cells
characterized by high MCT4 expression (Fig. 7A) 41-43. To study the affinity of MCT4 in these cells,
monocytes were isolated from blood samples collected from healthy donors, transformed into
macrophages in vitro and transduced with an adenoviral vector for Laconic. Experiments were
carried out with undifferentiated macrophages (M0) and polarized macrophages (M1). In both
developmental stages, the uptake of lactate was strongly inhibited by diclofenac but not by ARC155858, evidencing a preferential role for MCT4 (Fig. 7B). Km values were similar for M0 and M1
macrophages (Fig. 7C), with a pooled average of 1.2 mM.

MCT4 but not MCT1 or MCT2 can export lactate against high ambient lactate
The impact of MCT isoforms on cellular lactate and pyruvate dynamics was gauged using
numerical simulation based on the alternating conformer model of the transporter (Fig. 8A) 34, 44.
The behaviors of MCT4 and MCT1 were first compared at physiological levels of lactate and
pyruvate (Fig. 8B, left panel). Glycolytic cells were simulated by tuning mitochondrial pyruvate
consumption and transporter dosage so that lactate was exported at 95% of the glycolytic flux 5, 45.
For both isoforms there was pyruvate uptake. It seems remarkable that MCT4 imports almost as
much pyruvate as MCT1, despite having an affinity eight times lower. This can be explained by a
higher availability of the outward-facing carrier (TIN in Fig. 8A), pushed by lactate on its way out.
This pyruvate uptake helps to replenish the intracellular pyruvate pool and thus sustain lactate
efflux, which otherwise would be capped at 90% of the glycolytic flux. The steady-state
concentration of lactate and pyruvate were slightly higher in MCT1 cells, but on the whole both
isoforms behaved similarly when simulated at low extracellular lactate (Fig. 8B, left panel).
At elevated ambient lactate, such as is observed within tumors and inflammatory sites, a marked
functional divergence between MCT4 and MCT1 became evident (Fig. 8B, right panel). Here MCT1bearing cells became pyruvate producers while MCT4 cells maintained their lactate producing role
and generated little pyruvate. The divergence was more marked at higher lactate levels (Fig. 8C)
and at higher transporter dosages (Fig. 8D). With mitochondria unable to consume pyruvate, as
would occur during in hypoxia, MCT1 cells reverted from lactate producers to consumers at 3.5
mM extracellular lactate whereas MCT4 cells reverted at 13 mM lactate (Fig. 8E). MCT2-bearing
cells showed a strong tendency towards lactate consumption (Fig. 8D-F) consistent with the
expression of this isoform in highly oxidative cells like neurons 46. For simplicity, the cellular

NADH/NAD+ ratio in these simulations was fixed, that is, it was implicitly assumed that
mitochondria compensate for deficits in NAD+ recycling at LDH. If this were the case, MCT4 cells
will not only release more lactate than MCT1 cells will use less oxygen. Lactate and pyruvate fluxes
are not only determined by MCTs, but also by glycolytic and mitochondrial fluxes and the redox
ratio. Thus, these simulations do not cover every possible condition, but serve to demonstrate that
all things being equal, MCT4 is more suited for lactate export than MCT1 and MCT2 at high
ambient lactate levels.

DISCUSSION
Our main conclusion is that MCT4 is a high affinity lactate transporter and that has a relevant
affinity for pyruvate. A similar Km for lactate of around 1 mM was determined in three different
cell types including endogenous and recombinant MCT4, which suggests that this is a general
property of the isoform. High affinity for lactate and a somewhat lower affinity for pyruvate confer
MCT4-expressing cells the ability to export lactate against high ambient lactate levels, a role that is
not possible for either MCT1 or MCT2, which cannot help losing pyruvate. This ability helps to
explain why MCT4 is preferentially expressed in metastatic tumors, rapidly proliferating cells and
hypoxic tissues.
How come MCT4 has been considered to be a low affinity lactate transporter with negligible
affinity for pyruvate? When BCECF was first used to monitor monocarboxylate transport in 1990,
bicarbonate was purposely omitted from experimental solutions “to minimize intracellular
buffering in order to produce greater and faster pHi changes when small amounts of lactate were
introduced” 16. Shortly afterwards, BCECF was used to estimate kinetic parameters, also in
bicarbonate-free conditions 17. We confirm here that bicarbonate makes a big difference in the
acidification induced by lactate. However, bicarbonate omission is not enough to eliminate the
problem of buffering, because bicarbonate represents only a 30-50% of the buffering power of
mammalian cells, the remainder being shared by protonable aminoacid residues, phospholipids,
metabolites, etc 36, 37. As well as buffering, mammalian cells possess efficient systems for the
extrusion of protons, including carbonic anhydrase, Na+/H+ exchangers and Na+/bicarbonate
cotransporters, some of which are strategically located in the vicinity of MCTs 38. Of note, NBCe1
remains active even in the nominal absence of bicarbonate 47. A study in Xenopus laevis oocytes
showed that the MCT4 activity is enhanced by membrane-anchored carbonic anhydrase.
Significantly for affinity estimations, the effect of carbonic anhydrase was stronger at low lactate
concentrations 48. Our interpretation of the bias introduced by pH measurements is that on the
whole, the pH regulatory system is saturable. Challenged by low lactate loads, it copes well so that
intracellular pH remains stable in spite of lactate influx. At higher lactate loads, the regulatory
system is overwhelmed and cells acidify. In the presence of bicarbonate, pH regulation is even
stronger, so that MCT-mediated pH changes are difficult to detect even at high lactate loads, and
particularly in response to pyruvate, which is a less efficient substrate. The confounding effect of
pH regulation leads to a biased estimation of affinity. Whereas proton buffering and muffling
explain the high apparent Km values previously reported for MCT4 in mammalian cells, it is not
clear to us why a study based on radiolabeled lactate also reported a high Km in MCT4-expressing
oocytes (34 mM 14). The affinity measured here in HEK293-MCT4 cells suggest that overexpression may not account for the discrepancy, neither would genetic variability, because the
splice variants of MCT4 do not include the protein coding region 34. Perhaps factors present in
mammalian cells but not in Xenopus oocytes endow MCT4 with high affinity? Prime candidates are
carbonic anhydrase and proton extrusion mechanisms, which when co-expressed in oocytes
enhance the uptake of lactate 38, 48. Alternatively, the estimation of Km in millimeter-sized oocytes
may have been affected by unstirred layers that are not present in micrometer-sized mammalian

cells, as discussed previously 13. A non-exclusive possibility is metabolism. The radiolabeled assay
involved incubation for 20 minutes, during which some lactate may have been metabolized, an
effect that would be more evident at low lactate loads. Xenopus laevis oocytes have a strong
oxidative phosphorylation relative to glycolysis, producing CO2 from pyruvate 80-140 times faster
than from glucose 49. They also have endogenous MCT and LDH 50, 51, and are therefore equipped
to metabolize lactate. In the case of mammalian cells, oxidative phosphorylation is much slower
than MCT-mediated transport, so it should not interfere significantly with the uptake assay. Still, a
sizable metabolic interference in mammalian cells, a possibility that we do not favor, would mean
that the affinity of MCT4 for its substrates is even higher than reported here. It has been proposed
that MCT4 has a higher transport capacity than MCT1 14. Calibrated lactate and pyruvate
measurements accompanied by parallel measurement of MCT surface expression are needed to
address the pending question of transport capacity.

MCT4 versus MCT1 and MCT2
The most widely expressed, house-keeping member of the monocarboxylate transporter family is
MCT1. It has an affinity for pyruvate 5-10 times higher than that for lactate, commensurate with
the ratio between the physiological concentrations of the two substrates. MCT1 plays a major role
in whole-body energy homeostasis and in the distribution of redox potential between organs 52. It
is also widely expressed in tumors, where it mediates both the export and import of lactate 12, 53.
Hypoxic cells may only use glycolysis to generate ATP, and to sustain glycolysis they need to
recycle the NADH produced at GAPDH. With oxidative phosphorylation disabled in the absence of
oxygen, NADH may only be recycled at LDH, the enzyme that converts pyruvate into lactate. Thus,
to generate energy, hypoxic cells need to release lactate but not pyruvate, a task that is fitting for
MCT4, but not for MCT1. This helps to explain why only the expression of the MCT4 is under the
control of HIF-1α 11. At variance with hypoxic cells, which require glycolytic ATP production for
survival, cancer cells are capable of generating their ATP in mitochondria by oxidative
phosphorylation 45. For reasons that are not fully understood, but which include the interstitial
effects of lactate and protons 5, some cancer cells engage in a glycolytic frenzy to export almost
every glycolytic carbon in the form of lactate 1-4. They do this against elevated ambient lactate
levels caused by inflammation, hypoxia and/or the Warburg effect in neighboring cancer and
stroma cells 4-6, 9. According to our numerical simulations MCT1 cells may only produce lactate at
low ambient lactate levels, because at high lactate levels they cannot avoid producing pyruvate.
Consistently, pharmacological MCT1 inhibition in breast cancer cells was found to inhibit the
release of pyruvate but not that of lactate 54. In contrast, MCT4 exports lactate regardless of
extracellular lactate levels.
As well as to contributing to the understanding of high-lactate microenvironments, the revised
kinetic properties we report here may inform the development of urgently-needed specific MCT4
blockers.
