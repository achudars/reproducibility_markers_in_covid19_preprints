Abstract

7

Predicting how populations will respond to ocean change across generations is critical to

8

effective conservation of marine species. One emerging factor is the influence of parental

9

exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational carryover effects. Parental

10

exposure may deliver beneficial or detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence

11

larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and community structure respond to

12

ocean change. Impacts of adult exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO2 on

13

reproduction and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) using

14

three populations of adult, hatchery-reared O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one

15

of the populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated temperature (+4°C, at 10°C),

16

followed by elevated pCO2 (+2204 µatm, at 3045 µatm) during winter months. Male gametes

17

were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less developed after high pCO2

18

exposure, but there was no impact on female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed

19

to elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless of pCO2 exposure. Those

20

exposed to elevated winter temperature as a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis,

21

but when also exposed to high pCO2 there was no effect. These combined results indicate that

22

elevated winter temperature accelerates O. lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval

23

release and increased production, with elevated pCO2 exposure negating effects of elevated

24

temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may therefore follow warmer winters due to

25

precocious spawning, but these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO2. Offspring

26

were reared in common conditions for one year, then deployed for three months in four estuarine

27

bays with distinct environmental conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had

higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover effect demonstrates that parental

29

conditions can have substantial ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when

30

predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia oysters may be more

31

resilient in certain environments when progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions.

32

Combined with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may be more equipped

33

than other oysters for the challenge of a changing ocean.

Introduction

37

The repercussions of ocean warming and acidification on marine invertebrate physiology

38

are complex, but significant recent advances indicate that larval stages of marine taxa are

39

particularly vulnerable (Byrne & Przeslawski, 2013; Kurihara, 2008; Przeslawski, Byrne, &

40

Mellin, 2015). Understanding how shifting conditions will influence larval recruitment patterns

41

is critical to predicting changing population dynamics, and thus community structure. One

42

emerging consideration is whether larval stages benefit from ancestral exposures, based on

43

evidence that memory of environmental stressors can be transferred between generations through

44

non-genetic inheritance (reviewed in Perez & Lehner, 2019; Donelson et al. 2018; Eirin-Lopez

45

& Putnam, 2019; Ross, Parker, & Byrne, 2016). Beneficial, or positive, carryover effects may be

46

important acclimatory mechanisms for marine organisms facing rapid change, particularly those

47

that evolved in dynamic environments like estuaries and the intertidal (Donelson, Salinas,

48

Munday, & Shama, 2018; Gavery & Roberts, 2014). These carryover effects are defined as

transgenerational when they persist in generations that were never directly exposed.

50

Intergenerational, or parental, effects may be due to direct exposure as germ cells (Perez &

51

Lehner, 2019). Trans- and intergenerational carryover effects are increasingly reported across

52

marine phyla, including Cnidaria (e.g. Putnam & Gates, 2015), Echinodermata (e.g. Clark et al.,

53

2019), Mollusca (e.g. Parker et al. 2015), Arthropoda (e.g. Thor & Dupont, 2015), and Chordata

54

(Review: Munday 2014).

55

A foundational series of studies on the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata)

56

provide strong evidence for intergenerational carryover effects in bivalves, an ecologically and

57

economically important group of taxa (Dumbauld, Ruesink & Rumrill, 2009). Adult S.

58

glomerata exposed to high pCO2 produced larger larvae that were less sensitive to high pCO2,

59

and the effect persisted in the successive generation (Parker et al., 2012, 2015). In the presence

60

of secondary stressors, however, parental high pCO2 exposure rendered larvae more sensitive

61

(Parker et al., 2017). Intergenerational carryover effects are increasingly documented in larvae

62

across other bivalve species, and are beneficial in the mussels Mytilus chilensis (Diaz et al.,

63

2018) and Mytilus edulis (but not juveniles) (Kong et al., 2019; Thomsen et al., 2017), and

64

detrimental in the clam Mercenaria mercenaria, the scallop Argopecten irradians (Griffith &

65

Gobler, 2017), and the oyster Crassostrea gigas (Venkataraman, Spencer, & Roberts, 2019).

66

These preliminary studies provide strong evidence for intergenerational carryover effects

67

in bivalves, but the body of work is still narrow in scope. Nearly all studies have exposed parents

68

to stressors during denovo gamete formation (gametogenesis). For many temperate bivalve

69

species, this occurs seasonally in the spring (Bayne, 1976). Yet, challenging periods of

70

acidification and warming can occur during other times of the year (Evans, Hales, & Strutton,

71

2013; Joesoef, Huang, Gao, & Cai, 2015; McGrath, McGovern, Gregory, & Cave, 2019). The

72

most corrosive carbonate environment in the Puget Sound estuary in Washington State, for

73

example, commonly occurs in the winter when many species are reproductively inactive, while

74

favorable conditions are in the spring when gametogenesis coincides with phytoplankton blooms

75

(Pelletier, Roberts, Keyzers, & Alin, 2018). Thus, adult exposure to severely corrosive

76

conditions during gametogenesis may not represent the natural estuarine system. To our

77

knowledge, only one study has assessed carryover effects of exposure to acidification before

78

reproductive conditioning in a bivalve, the oyster C. gigas, and found negative maternal

79

carryover effects on larval survival (Venkataraman, Spencer, & Roberts, 2019), indicating that

80

pre-gametogenic exposure also matters. No studies have yet attempted to examine

81

intergenerational carryover effects of combined winter warming and acidification in bivalves.

82

To best predict whether intergenerational carryover effects will be beneficial or

83

detrimental, it is also crucial to understand how warming and acidification will impact fertility

84

and reproductive phenology. Temperature is a major driver of bivalve reproduction, and

85

modulates gametogenesis (Joyce, Holthuis, Charrier, & Lindegarth, 2013; Maneiro, Pérez-

86

Parallé, Pazos, Silva, & Sánchez, 2016; Oates, 2013), influences sex determination (Santerre et

87

al., 2013) and, in many species, triggers spawning (Fabioux, Huvet, Le Souchu, Le Pennec, &

88

Pouvreau, 2005) (alongside other factors such as photoperiod, nutrition, lunar/tidal phases).

89

Year-round warming may result in unexpected impacts to larval competency resulting from

90

changes to reproduction. For instance, some temperate bivalve species have a thermal threshold

91

for gametogenesis and enter a period of reproductive inactivity, or “quiescence”, which is

92

believed necessary for successive spawning (Giese, 1959; Hopkins, 1937; Loosanoff, 1942).

93

Warmer winters brought on by global climate change (IPCC, 2013, 2019) may therefore shift

94

species’ reproductive cycles to begin earlier, or eliminate seasonality altogether, resulting in

95

poorly provisioned or ill-timed larvae (Chevillot et al., 2017). Such impacts were clearly

96

demonstrated using a long-term dataset (1973-2001) of estuarine clam Macoma balthica

97

reproduction and temperature. Mild winters and earlier springs resulted in low fecundity, earlier

98

spawning, and poor recruitment, which was largely explained by a phenological mismatch

99

between spawning and peak phytoplankton blooms (Philippart et al., 2003). The impacts of

100

winter acidification on estuarine bivalve reproduction are less predictable. The few studies to

101

date show that high pCO2 delays gametogenesis in the oysters Crassostrea virginica and S.

102

glomerata (Boulais et al., 2017; Parker et al., 2018), but both studies exposed oysters during

103

gametogenesis. Acidification during the winter months could increase energetic requirements

104

(Sokolova, Frederich, Bagwe, Lannig, & Sukhotin, 2012), and deplete glycogen reserves that are

105

later utilized for gametogenesis in the spring (Mathieu & Lubet, 1993), but this hypothesis has

106

yet to be tested.

107

The purpose of this study was to assess whether warmer, less alkaline winters will affect

108

fecundity and offspring viability in the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida. The Olympia is native to

109

the Pacific coast of North America (McGraw, 2009). Overharvest and pollution devastated

110

populations in the early 1900s, and today 2-5% of historic beds remain (Blake & Bradbury,

111

2012; Polson & Zacherl, 2009). Restoration efforts are afoot, but O. lurida populations continue

112

to struggle, and may be further challenged by changing conditions (Barton, Hales, Waldbusser,

113

Langdon, & Feely, 2012; Feely, Klinger, Newton, & Chadsey, 2012; Feely, Sabine, Hernandez-

114

Ayon, Ianson, & Hales, 2008). For instance, large interannual variability in larval recruitment

115

and frequent recruitment failures were recently reported (Wasson et al., 2016; Kimbro, White &

116

Grosholz, 2019). This variability is presumably related to inconsistent spawning success, larval

117

survival, and retention, and governed predominantly by local conditions (Kimbro, White &

118

Grosholz, 2019). It is unknown how the intensity, timing, and duration of local environmental

119

conditions can predict recruitment failure (Wasson et al., 2016). If winter conditions

120

significantly influence recruitment through direct changes to adult reproductive capacity or

121

timing, or indirect changes through parental carryover effects, population densities and

122

distributions will inevitably shift with conditions.

123

Another consideration in this study was the genetic composition of test organisms. Ostrea

124

lurida exhibits varying phenotypes among distinct populations (Silliman, 2019), which can

125

influence their sensitivity to environmental stressors (Bible & Sanford, 2016; Bible, Evans &

126

Sanford, 2019). Indeed, the two groups to measure the response of O. lurida larvae to ocean

127

acidification found contrasting results ⎼ no effect (Waldbusser et al., 2016), and slower growth

128

(Hettinger et al., 2012, 2013) ⎼ possibly a result of local adaptation. The source population used

129

for experimental studies may therefore be a critical factor influencing climate-related findings.

130

Furthermore, testing genetically diverse organisms could reveal cryptic genetic variation, alleles

131

that confer stress resilience only under certain settings (Paaby & Rockman, 2014; Bitter et al.,

132

preprint), which has implications for how wild populations are restored. Therefore, we tested

133

three phenotypically distinct Puget Sound populations (Heare, Blake, Davis, Vadopalas, &

134

Roberts, 2017; Silliman, Bowyer, & Roberts, 2018), which were hatchery-reared in common

135

conditions to adulthood, to account for intraspecific variation while controlling for within-

136

generation carryover effects (Hettinger et al., 2012, 2013).

137

Our study is the first to assess the combined effects of elevated winter temperature and

138

pCO2 on reproduction, and to explore intergenerational carryover in an Ostrea spp. We exposed

139

adult O. lurida to elevated temperature (+4°C), followed by elevated pCO2 (+2204 µatm, -0.51

140

pH). Gonad development, reproductive timing, and fecundity were assessed for the adults in the

141

laboratory, and offspring performance was assessed in the field. Elevated winter temperature was

142

expected to impede gametogenic quiescence, presumably a critical annual event, subsequently

143

reducing larval production. This prediction was in part based on observations of low larval yields

144

in an O. lurida restoration hatchery (Ryan Crim, unpublished) following the winter 2016 marine

145

heat wave in the Northeast Pacific Ocean (Gentemann, Fewings, & García-Reyes, 2017).

146

Similarly, we predicted that high pCO2 exposure would result in negative impacts due to

147

increased energy requirements for calcification and cellular maintenance. Finally, we predicted

148

that negative impacts would be amplified upon exposure to both conditions. By assessing the

149

effects of winter warming and acidification on reproduction and offspring viability in multiple

150

Olympia oyster populations, we provide an ecologically relevant picture of how the species will

151

respond to ocean change.

152

Methods

153

Adult oyster temperature and pCO2 exposures

154

Four cohorts of adult Ostrea lurida were used in this study. Three of the cohorts were first-

155

generation hatchery-produced (F1) oysters (32.1 ± 5.0 mm), all hatched in Puget Sound (Port

156

Gamble Bay) in 2013 (Heare et al., 2017). The broodstock used to produce these F1 oysters were

157

wild, harvested from Fidalgo Bay in North Puget Sound (F), Dabob Bay in Hood Canal (D), and

158

Oyster Bay in South Puget Sound (O-1) (O in Figure 1). These populations are considered

159

phenotypically distinct subpopulations (Heare et al., 2017; White, Vadopalas, Silliman, &

160

Roberts, 2017). The fourth cohort (O-2, 21.9 ± 3.3 mm) was second-generation, hatchery-

161

produced in 2015 from the aforementioned Oyster Bay F1 cohort, from a single larval release

162

pulse and thus likely one family (Silliman, Bowyer, & Roberts, 2018). The O-2 cohort was

163

included to examine whether reproductive and offspring traits were consistent across generations

164

of a population, with the O-2 cohort being closely related to each other (siblings) and 2 years

165

younger than the other cohorts. Prior to the experiment, all oysters were maintained in pearl nets

166

in Clam Bay (C) for a minimum of 500 days.

167

Temperature treatment

168

Oysters were moved from Clam Bay (C) to the Kenneth K. Chew Center for Shellfish Research

169

and Restoration for the temperature and pCO2 experiments. Oysters were held in one of two

170

temperature regimes (6.1±0.2°C and 10.2±0.5°C) for 60 days beginning December 6, 2016

171

(Figure 2). The temperatures correspond to historic local winter temperature (6°C) in Clam Bay,

172

and anomalously warm winter temperature (10°C) as experienced during 2014-2016 (Gentemann

173

et al., 2017). For the temperature exposure, oysters from each cohort (100 for O-1 and F cohorts,

174

60 for D, and 300 for O-2) were divided into four bags, two bags per temperature, in two flow-

175

through experimental tanks (50L - 1.2-L/min). Temperature in the 6°C treatment was maintained

176

using an aquarium chiller, and unchilled water was used for the 10°C treatment. Temperatures

177

were recorded continuously with water temperature data loggers.

178

High pCO2 treatment

179

A differential pCO2 exposure was carried out after the temperature treatment ended. Following a

180

10-day gradual temperature increase for the 6°C treatment to 10°C, oysters were further divided

181

and held at ambient pCO2 (841±85 µatm, pH 7.82±0.02) or high pCO2 (3045±488 µatm, pH 7.31

182

± 0.02) for 52 days (February 16 to April 8, 2017, Figure 2). Animals were housed in six flow-

183

through tanks (50-L - 1.2-L/min), with three replicate tanks per pCO2 treatment and oyster

cohort. High pCO2 treated water was prepared using CO2 injection. Filtered seawater (1µm) first

185

recirculated through a reservoir (1,610-L) with a degassing column to equilibrate with the

186

atmosphere, then flowed into treatment reservoirs (757-L) recirculating through venturi injectors.

187

Durafet pH sensors and a Dual Input Analytical Analyzer monitored pH in treatment reservoirs

188

with readings every 180 seconds. Using solenoid valves, CO2 gas was injected through lines at

189

15 psi in 0.4 second pulses if pH exceeded the 7.22 set point. Water pH was continuously

190

monitored in experimental tanks using Durafet pH sensors, and temperature (10.4 ± 0.4°C) was

191

measured using water temperature data loggers. Twice weekly, water samples (1-L) were

192

collected from experimental tanks, and temperature (°C), salinity (PSU), and pH (mV, converted

193

to pHT) were measured immediately using a digital thermometer, conductivity meter, and pH

194

electrode, respectively. Simultaneously, discrete water samples (120-mL) were collected in

195

duplicate from experimental tanks and preserved with HgCl (50-µL) for later total alkalinity

196

measurements using a titrator. Standard pH curves were generated on each sampling day prior to

197

pH measurements using TRIS buffer prepared in-house at five temperatures (Appendix S1:

198

Section S1). Using the seacarb library in R, pCO2, dissolved organic carbon (DIC), calcite

199

saturation (Ωcalcite), and aragonite saturation (Ωaragonite) were calculated for days 5, 33, and 48

200

(Appendix S1: Table S1).

201

During both temperature and pCO2 treatments, all oysters were fed from a shared algae

202

header tank daily with Shellfish Diet 1800® (300-500-mL, Reed Mariculture) diluted in ambient

203

pCO2 seawater (200-L, Helm & Bourne, 2004), dosed continuously with metering pumps.

204

Experimental, reservoir, and algae tanks were drained and cleaned, and oysters were monitored

205

for mortality and rotated within the experimental system twice weekly.

207

Adult reproductive development

208

A subset of oysters was sampled for gamete stage and dominant sex immediately before and

209

after pCO2 treatments (Figure 2) to capture developmental differences among treatments. Puget

210

Sound O. lurida reportedly enter reproductive quiescence and resorb residual gametes when

211

temperatures are below 12.5°C (Hopkins 1936, 1937), however recent evidence of low-

212

temperature brooding in Puget Sound (10.5°C, Barber et al. 2016) suggests that reproductive

213

activity may occur during warm winters. Therefore, gonad tissue was sampled to estimate the

214

following: 1) whether residual gametes were resorbed or developed during winter treatments; 2)

215

whether temperature and pCO2 influenced winter activity; 3) if male and female gametes

216

responded similarly; and 4) if gonad responses correspond with fecundity. Prior to pCO2

217

exposure, 15 oysters were sampled from O-1, O-2, and F cohorts, and 9 from the D cohort. After

218

pCO2 exposure, 9, 6, and 15 oysters were sampled from each treatment for O-1/F, D, and O-2

219

cohorts, respectively (distributed equally among replicates tanks). Whole visceral mass was

220

excised and preserved in histology cassettes using the PAXgene Tissue FIX System, then

221

processed for gonad analysis by Diagnostic Pathology Medical Group, Inc. (Sacramento, CA).

222

Adult gonad samples were assigned sex and stage using designations adapted from (da

223

Silva, Fuentes, & Villalba, 2009) (Appendix S1: Tables S2 & S3). Sex was assigned as

224

indeterminate (I), male (M), hermaphroditic primarily-male (HPM), hermaphroditic (H),

225

hermaphroditic primarily-female (HPF), and female (F). Gonad sex was collapsed into simplified

226

male and female designations for statistical analyses (hermaphroditic-primarily male = male,

227

hermaphroditic-primarily female = female). For stage assignment, male and female gametes

228

were assigned separately due to the high frequency of hermaphroditism (50.8%). Dominant

229

gonad stage was then assigned based on the sex assignment. The da Silva gonad stages were

applied for early gametogenesis (stage 1), advanced (stage 2), and ripe (stage 3). Departures

231

from da Silva’s stage 0, stage 4 (partially spawned), and stage 5 (fully spawned/resorbing) were

232

as follows: stage 0 in this study represents empty follicles, or no presence of male or female

233

gonad tissue; stage 4 represents both spawned and resorbing gonad; this method did not include a

234

separate stage 5, due to the very high frequency of residual gametes, and no distinct partially

235

spawned oysters (for gonad images see Appendix S1: Fig. S2 and Spencer et al. 2019).

effects of elevated winter temperature alone, gonad metrics were compared between 6°C and

240

10°C treatments prior to pCO2 treatment. To determine the effect of pCO2 exposure, gonad

241

metrics were compared between ambient and high pCO2 after 52 days in pCO2 treatments,

242

including temperature interaction effects. To estimate whether gonad changed during pCO2

243

treatment, metrics were compared before and after ambient and high pCO2 treatments, including

244

temperature interaction effects. P-values were estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations with

245

1,000 permutations, and corrected using the Benjamini & Hochberg method and 𝛼=0.05

(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).

Larval production

249

Following pCO2 exposure, adult oysters were spawned to assess impacts of winter treatment on

250

larval production timing and magnitude. Beginning on April 11, 2017 (Figure 2), oysters were

251

reproductively conditioned by raising temperatures gradually (~1°C/day) to 18.1 ± 0.1°C and fed

252

live algae cocktail at 66,000 ± 12,000 cells/mL. Oysters spawned in the hatchery for 90 days

volitionally, i.e. naturally releasing gametes without chemical or physical manipulation. Six

254

spawning tanks were used for each temperature x pCO2 treatment: 6°C-high pCO2, 6°C-ambient

255

pCO2, 10°C-high pCO2, and 10°C-ambient pCO2. Within the six tanks per treatment, two

256

spawning tanks contained the F cohort (14-17 oysters), two tanks the O-1 cohort (14-17 oysters),

257

one tank the D cohort (9-16 oysters), and one tank the O-2 cohort (111-126 oysters). More O-2

258

oysters were used due to their small size. Olympia oysters release sperm, but have internal

259

fertilization and release veliger larvae following a ~2 week brooding period (Coe ,1931;

260

Hopkins, 1937). Therefore, production was assessed by collecting veliger larvae upon maternal

261

release. Spawning tank outflow was collected in 7.5-L buckets using 100 µm screens made from

262

15.25 cm polyvinyl chloride rings and 100 µm nylon mesh.

263

Larval collection was assessed for differences in spawn timing and fecundity. Larvae,

264

first observed on May 11, 2017 (Figure 2), were collected from each spawning tank every one or

265

two days for 60 days. The number of larvae released was estimated by counting and averaging

266

triplicate subsamples of larvae homogenized in seawater. The following summary statistics were

267

compared between temperature x pCO2 treatments: total larvae released across the 90-day

268

period, average number of larvae collected on a daily basis (excluding days where no larvae were

269

released), maximum larvae released in one day, date of first release, date of maximum release,

270

and number of substantial release days (greater than 10,000 larvae). The total and daily release

271

values were normalized by the number of broodstock * average broodstock height (cm), which

272

can impact fecundity. Distributions were assessed using qqp in the car package for R (Fox &

273

Weisberg, 2011), and log-transformed to meet normal distribution assumptions, if necessary.

274

Differences between treatments were assessed using linear regression and Three-Way ANOVA

(cohort was included as a covariate) with backwards deletion to determine the most

regression, with geom_smooth in the ggplot package (Wickham, 2017), with span=0.3 and

Offspring survival in a natural setting

283

To assess potential carryover effects of parental pCO2 exposure, offspring from parents in 6ºC-

284

ambient pCO2 and 6ºC-high pCO2 treatments were reared then deployed in the natural

285

environment. To focus on the effect of parental pCO2 exposure, only offspring from 6ºC parents

286

were tested in the field (Figure 2). Larvae were collected between May 19 and June 22, 2017,

287

separated by parental pCO2 exposure and cohort, and reared in common conditions for

288

approximately 1 year (Figure 2; for rearing methods see Appendix S1: Section S6). On June 12,

289

2018 the juveniles were placed in four bays in Puget Sound — Fidalgo Bay, Port Gamble Bay,

290

Skokomish River Delta, and Case Inlet — with two sites per bay, for a total of eight locations

291

(Figure 1). Autonomous sensors collected continuous water quality data at each location for pH,

292

salinity (via conductivity), dissolved oxygen, temperature, and chlorophyll. For the F/D and O-

293

1/O-2 cohorts, respectively, 30 and 10 oysters were placed at each location. Initial shell height

294

and group weight were measured, then oysters were enclosed in mesh pouches and affixed inside

295

shellfish bags to exclude predators. At the end of three months, survival, shell height and group

296

weight were measured for live oysters.

Results

311

Adult reproductive development

312

After 60 days in temperature treatments (6.1±0.2°C and 10.2±0.5°C), gonad stage of the

313

dominant sex differed significantly between temperatures (Table 2). The 10°C oysters had more

314

instances of advanced gametogenesis (stage 2), and fewer that were resorbing/spawned (stage 4)

315

(Figure 3). This difference was influenced strongly by more advanced male gametes in 10ºC

316

oysters, but there were no differences in female gamete stages. No differences in sex ratio were

317

observed between temperature treatments (Figure 4).

318

After 52 days in pCO2 treatments, gonad stage of the dominant sex differed significantly

319

between ambient and high pCO2 in the oysters previously held in 10°C (Table 2). More mature

320

gametes (stage 3) were found in 10°C-ambient pCO2 (49%) compared to 10°C-high pCO2

321

(33%). This difference was strongly influenced by oysters that were predominantly male, as male

322

gamete stage tended to differ between pCO2 treatment, but female gamete stage did not (Table 2,

323

Figure 3). In 6°C-treated oysters, there were no pCO2 effects on gonad stage of the dominant sex,

324

male gamete stage, or female gamete stage. No gonad stage or sex ratio differences were

325

detected among oysters from 10°C-high pCO2 (combined stressors) and 6°C-ambient pCO2 (no

326

stressors). Gonad sex did not differ significantly among treatments, however oysters tended to

327

contain fewer male-only and more female-only gonad tissues in the riper, ambient pCO2-treated

328

groups than male-only tissues (Figure 4).

329

Compared to oysters before pCO2 exposure, those exposed to high pCO2 did not differ in

330

gonad sex, stage of the dominant sex, or female gamete stage. Male gametes in the 6°C treated

331

oysters developed while in the high pCO2 exposure, but there was no change in the 10°C treated

332

oysters. Oysters held in ambient pCO2 had significantly more advanced gonad compared to

333

before CO2 exposure regardless of temperature, again influenced strongly by changes in male

334

gamete stage (Table 2).

335
336

No sampled oysters contained brooded embryos or larvae. Gonad data and patterns
within cohorts is reported in Appendix S1: Figures S3, S4, and Table S4.

338

Larval production

339

Adults exposed to 10°C produced more larvae on a daily basis (excluding days where no larvae

340

were released) than those exposed to 6°C in ambient pCO2-exposed oysters (p=0.040), but not in

341

high pCO2-exposed oysters (p=0.66) (Figure 6, pCO2:temperature interaction: (F(2,8)=5.1,

342

p=0.037). Total larvae released over the 90-day spawning period tended to differ by treatment,

343

but not significantly (temperature:pCO2 interaction (F(2,8)=4.0, p=0.063). Temperature and

344

pCO2 as single factors did not affect total larvae released or daily averages.

345

The date of first larval release differed by temperature regardless of pCO2 (Figures 5 & 6,

346

F(1,8)=11.9, p=0.0087), and pCO2 had no effect on timing (not retained in model). Onset was on

347

average 5.2 days earlier in the 10°C treatment. Timing of peak larval release also differed by

348

temperature treatment regardless of pCO2 (Figure 6, F(3,19)=6.7, p=0.018), occurring on average

349

8.3 days earlier in 10°C oysters. The 10°C treated oysters produced more large pulses of larvae,

350

on average 2 additional days, than 6°C (F(1,8=7.25, p=0.027).

351

In total, 18.5 million larvae were collected from 767 oysters. Total larvae produced by

352

each treatment was 3.1M, 4.8M, 5.9M, and 4.5M for 6°C-ambient pCO2, 6°C-high pCO2, 10°C-

353

ambient pCO2, and 10°C-high pCO2, respectively. Based on reports of approximately 215,000

354

larvae produced per adult O. lurida of shell height 35 mm (Hopkins, 1936), the number of

355

oysters that spawned as female in this study was approximately 86, with 14.3, 22.5, 27.6, and

356

21.0 from the 6°C-ambient pCO2, 6°C-high pCO2, 10°C-ambient pCO2, and 10°C-high pCO2

357

treatments, respectively. This estimate is likely low across all treatments, due to the smaller D

358

and O-2 cohorts (mean length in F, D, O-1 and O-2 was 35.7 mm, 29.8 mm, 35.7 mm, and 20.0

359

mm, respectively), therefore the total number of oysters that spawned as female and released

360

larvae is likely higher than 86.

Offspring survival in a natural setting

365

Juvenile survival after three months in the field was on average 15% higher in cohorts from high

366

pCO2 exposed parents than from ambient pCO2 parents (44±37%, and 29±27%, respectively,

367

𝝌2=10.6, p=0.0011). The influence of parental pCO2 on survival varied by bay (bay:parental

pCO2 interaction 𝝌2=15.3, p=1.6e-3), and by cohort (cohort:parental pCO2 interaction 𝝌2=23.5,

369

p=3.2e-5) (Table 3).

370

Survival in offspring from high pCO2 parents was higher in the Fidalgo Bay and Port

371

Gamble Bay locations (𝝌2=17.7, p= 2.6e-5; 𝝌2=10.0, p=1.6e-3, respectively), but this was not

372

the case in Skokomish River Delta or Case Inlet. Survival in the F cohort was 38% higher in

373

oyster from pCO2 parents than those from ambient pCO2 parents across all deployment bays

374

(𝝌2=28.1, p=4.6e-7), and within the Fidalgo Bay location (𝝌2=17.6, p-adj=0.0001). Survival in

375

the D and O-1 cohorts did not differ significantly between parental pCO2 across all bays (D:

376

𝝌2=0.4, p=1, O-1: 𝝌2=2.5, p=0.44), or within individual bays. More O-2 juveniles with ambient

377

pCO2 parents survived across all bays (𝝌2=9.1, p=0.010), and within the Skokomish River Delta

378

(𝝌2=8.9, p=0.011).

379

Without considering parental pCO2, more oysters survived in Port Gamble Bay (mean

380

49±36%) and Fidalgo Bay (39±36%) than in Case Inlet (mean 29±29%, p=0.012 & p=0.037,

381

respectively) (bay factor, 𝝌2=18.5, p=3.4e-4). Survival at Skokomish River Delta did not differ

382

significantly from other locations (32±27%). No interaction between cohort and bay was

383

detected (𝝌2=9.8, p=0.37) (Figure 7, Table 3).

384

Shell length was not affected by bay, cohort or parental pCO2. The mass per oyster

385

(compared to before deployment) differed by cohort (F(3,76)=15.9, p=4.0e-8), due to Dabob Bay

386

cohort growing less than the other three cohorts (∆ g/oyster: D=0.5, F=1.2, O-1=1.6, & O-

2=1.0). Mass change also differed by bay (F(3,76)=4.8, p=3.9e-3) due to less growth in oysters

388

placed at Fidalgo Bay than in Port Gamble Bay and Case Inlet (∆ g/oyster: FB=0.7, PGB=1.0,

CI=1.1, SK=0.8) (Appendix S1: Figure S5).

Discussion

391

Ocean acidification and ocean warming potentially threaten marine organisms, particularly

392

ectothermic calcifiers (Hoffman et al. 2010). An organism’s genotype, complete environmental

393

history, and the timing and magnitude of environmental perturbations may all determine its

394

fitness in future ocean conditions. To begin teasing apart these complex factors in the Olympia

395

oyster, this study examined four adult cohorts with distinct genetic structure but known, shared

396

histories. Elevated winter temperature resulted in increased gonad development, which

397

corresponded with earlier and more frequent larval release (on average 5.2 days earlier, 2

398

additional days). High pCO2 exposure negatively influenced gonad maturation state, but did not

399

affect subsequent fecundity. Offspring from parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had higher overall

400

survival upon deployment. Differences in juvenile survival among bays and cohorts indicate that

401

carryover effects are dependent upon the environment and genotype, and reinforce the

402

importance of using multiple sources of test organisms in stress-response studies.

403

Reproduction

404

We expected elevated winter temperature to reduce fecundity, based on predictions that changes

405

to reproductive quiescence and metabolism would be deleterious to spring reproduction. Counter

406

to this prediction, warm winter temperature positively affected larval production. Oysters in

407

elevated temperature contained more developed male gametes after treatment, and subsequently

408

began releasing larvae earlier and produced more larvae per day compared to cold-treated

409

oysters. We find no evidence that cold winters are critical for spring reproduction, but rather

410

elevated winter temperature may elongate the O. lurida spawning season. In comparison, a 29-

411

year dataset of M. balthica reproduction showed that as winter temperature increased, spring

412

spawning began earlier and fecundity declined (Philippart et al., 2003). However, the present

413

study was conducted in a hatchery setting, with ample phytoplankton, and did result in a

414

temperature shift during spawning. In the wild numerous additional abiotic and biotic factors will

415

contribute to O. lurida fitness, and warmer winters may result in earlier and longer reproductive

416

seasons only if nutritional requirements are met. Whether larvae released earlier in the spring can

417

survive to recruitment will greatly depend on many factors including food availability and

418

predation. Those modeling larval recruitment (e.g. Kimbro, White & Grosholz, 2019; Wasson et

419

al., 2016) should consider including winter temperature as a factor influencing spatiotemporal

420

recruitment patterns.

421

We predicted that high pCO2 exposure would redirect energy away from storage to

422

maintenance processes, resulting in delayed gametogenesis and poor fecundity in the spring.

423

After exposure to 3045 µatm pCO2 (pH 7.31), fewer oysters contained ripe or advanced male

424

gonad tissue than in ambient pCO2, signaling reduced spermatogenic activity. Female gonad, sex

425

ratios, and subsequent fecundity were not affected by sole exposure to high pCO2. Similar

426

impacts on gametogenesis during exposure were observed in the Sydney rock (S. glomerata) and

427

Eastern (C. virginica) oysters, but with varying pCO2 thresholds. Parker et al. (2018) found S.

428

glomerata gametogenesis to slow in 856 µatm (pH 7.91), and Boulais et al. (2017) found normal

429

rates at 2260 µatm (pH 7.5), delay at 5584 µatm (pH 7.1), and full inhibition at 18480 µatm (pH

430

6.9) in C. virginica. Together, these studies indicate that high pCO2 slows the rate of

431

gametogenesis, but the level at which pCO2 affects gametogenesis appears species-specific, and

432

likely reflective of variable physiological mechanisms and reproductive strategies.

433

The combined effects of sequential elevated temperature and pCO2 treatments did not act

434

synergistically to delay gonad development, but instead resulted in oysters with gonad stage and

435

fecundity no different from the untreated oysters. Similarly, combined simultaneous temperature

436

and high pCO2 exposures did not affect S. glomerata fecundity (Parker et al., 2018). We did

437

detect a pCO2 dependent effect of temperature on the average number of larvae released per day.

438

Oysters that had previously been exposed to 10°C produced more larvae than 6°C, but only after

439

ambient pCO2 exposure, which may reflect a general reproductive arrest that occurs when

440

exposed to high pCO2. Despite experimental differences (e.g. sequential vs. simultaneous

441

exposures) which can influence outcomes (Bible et al. 2017), both Parker et al. (2018) and the

442

present study indicate that high pCO2 slows gametogenesis, elevated temperature accelerates it,

443

and these two environmental drivers act antagonistically on gonad development if occurring in

444

the same reproductive season. An important factor not included in either study is ecologically

445

relevant variability. Temperature and pCO2 oscillations, driven by tides and diurnal

446

photosynthesis, could offer daily refuge or expose oysters to dynamic changes, altering how

447

combined stressors interact (Cheng et al. 2015).

448

In contrast to prior studies, temperature and pCO2 did not impact O. lurida sex ratios,

449

whereas in high pCO2 C. virginica skewed male (Boulais et al., 2017), and S. glomerata skewed

450

female (Parker et al., 2018). This observation may be explained by very low incidence of total

451

reproductive inactivity in our O. lurida cohorts — only four out of the 108 oysters that were

452

sampled prior to pCO2 treatment contained empty follicles — and thus sex ratios may be

453

different if pCO2 exposure occurs earlier in life during initial sex differentiation. Furthermore,

454

high pCO2 exposure only occurred in winter, prior to spawning. If high pCO2 persists during

455

oocyte maturation and spawning, O. lurida fecundity may be reduced similar to C. virginica and

456

S. glomerata. Future research should examine O. lurida sexual development during the initial

457

switch from male to female, which can occur the first winter after settlement (Moore et al.,

2016), and across a range of pCO2 to determine conditions in which gametogenesis and sex

459

determination are affected.

460

Offspring

461

Abiotic parental stressors can be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to offspring viability

462

(Donelson et al., 2018). We explored carryover effects of adult exposure to winter pCO2 on

463

offspring by testing survival in the field. Offspring with high pCO2 parental histories performed

464

better in two of four locations, Fidalgo Bay and Port Gamble Bay. Carryover effects of parental

465

high pCO2 exposure may therefore be neutral, or beneficial, to offspring depending on the

466

environmental conditions. Port Gamble Bay and Fidalgo Bay are more influenced by oceanic

467

waters, which could explain cooler observed temperatures. These locations are also typically less

468

stratified than the Skokomish River Delta and Case Inlet. In Port Gamble Bay, where pCO2

469

parental history most significantly correlated with offspring survival across cohorts, mean pH

470

was considerably lower than the other deployment locations (-0.17 pH units), and mean salinity

471

was higher (+3.8 PSU). Given the experimental design we are able to clearly demonstrate that

472

manifestation of carryover effects in Olympia oysters is dependent on environmental conditions.

473

Specifically, there is a greater likelihood of beneficial carryover effects when parents are

474

exposed to stressful conditions. Overall, carryover effects of parental pCO2 treatment were

475

positive, however negative effects were observed in the O-2 cohort. This discrepancy could

476

relate to unique O-2 juvenile characteristics, as they were bred from siblings, and were 3rd-

477

generation hatchery produced. The complex interactions among parental exposure, bay, and

478

cohort indicate that offspring viability is influenced by ancestral environment history,

479

environmental conditions, and genotype.

Our results contrast with a similar study that exposed C. gigas oysters to high pCO2

481

during the winter, and found fewer hatched larvae 18 hours post-fertilization from exposed

482

females, with no discernable paternal effect (Venkataraman, Spencer & Roberts, 2019). Hatch

483

rate was not directly measured in this study due to the O. lurida brooding behavior; however, no

484

difference in daily and total larvae released suggest that hatch rate was unaffected by pCO2. The

485

different responses seen in Venkataraman, Spencer & Roberts (2019) and the present study may

486

reflect variability among species and spawning method. C. gigas gametes were collected

487

artificially by stripping gonad, whereas O. lurida late-stage veliger larvae were collected upon

488

release from the brood chamber. For instance, volitionally-spawned gamete quality and

489

fertilization rates could vary between the natural versus artificial settings to influence larval

490

viability. Larval brooding may also be a mechanism by which sensitive larvae are acclimatized

491

to stressors, as the O. lurida brood chamber pH and dissolved oxygen can be significantly lower

492

than the environment (Gray et al., in press).

493

Beneficial parental carryover may also be linked to the male-specific gonad effects, and

494

the conditions in which the adult oysters were held. During high pCO2 exposure, oocyte stage

495

and prevalence did not change, which indicates that oogenesis did not occur. Negative

496

intergenerational carryover effects are commonly linked to variation in oocyte quality, which can

497

be affected by the maternal environment during oogenesis (Utting & Millican, 1997). In the

498

Chilean flat oyster (Ostrea chilensis), for instance, egg size and lipid content positively correlate

499

with juvenile growth and survival (Wilson, Chaparro, & Thompson, 1996). If high pCO2

500

exposure were to coincide with oocyte proliferation and growth, O. lurida egg quality and larval

501

viability could be compromised. In contrast, male gonad stage advanced significantly during

502

pCO2 exposure. Intergenerational and transgenerational carryover effects are increasingly linked

to the paternal environment in other taxa, such as inheritance of epigenetic changes to the male

504

germ line (Rodgers, Morgan, Bronson, Revello, & Bale, 2013; Anway, 2005; Soubry, Hoyo,

505

Jirtle, & Murphy, 2014). Positive carryover effects of environmental stressors observed in this

506

and other marine invertebrate taxa may be due to paternal epigenetic effects, but this link has not

507

yet been observed.

Conclusion

510

This study clearly demonstrates that exposure to elevated winter temperature and altered

511

carbonate chemistry impacts reproduction and offspring viability in the Olympia oyster.

512

Furthermore, we report the first observations of intergenerational plasticity in an Ostrea species,

513

that is dependent on offspring environmental conditions and population. The observed context-

514

dependent carryover effects could have a substantial impact on species resilience. Combined

515

with previous reports of resilience to environmental stressors (Waldbusser et al 2016; Cheng et

516

al. 2017) and intraspecific variability (Bible, Evans & Sanford, 2019; Maynard, Bible, Pespeni,

517

Sanford, & Evans, 2018; Silliman, Bowyer, & Roberts, 2018; Heare, Blake, Davis, Vadopalas, &

518

Roberts, 2017), the Olympia oyster may be more capable than other marine bivalve species to

519

withstand and adapt to unprecedented ocean change. Furthermore, conserving and restoring O.

520

lurida in a variety of settings — including hypoxic, warmer, and less alkaline areas — could

521

increase the probability that future populations are equipped for challenging conditions through

522

selection or intergenerational carryover.

523

As temperatures rise and ocean acidification progresses, there may be profound and

524

unexpected seasonal changes across marine taxa. Accurate predictions will need to consider

525

parental carryover effects, as they can impart neutral, beneficial, or detrimental characteristics to

526

offspring, which depend on complex interactions among parental exposure timing, reproductive

527

strategies, species plasticity, and standing genetic structure. With these considerations, future

528

biological response studies need to be aware of three possible factors influencing results: 1)

529

source population; 2) environmental history (within-lifetime carryover effects); and 3) ancestral

530

environmental history (inter- and transgenerational carryover effects). Controlling for, or at

531

minimum recognizing and recording these factors, will provide important context for those

532

predicting ecosystem response to environmental change.

Table 2: Gonad stage and sex comparisons among treatments. Gonad was sampled after
temperature treatment but before pCO2 (6°C Pre and 10°C Pre, n=54), and after pCO2 treatment
(Amb=841±85 µatm, n=39; High= 3045±488 µatm, n=39). Pearson’s chi-square statistics are shown
with p-adj in parentheses for gonad sex, stage of the dominant sex, male gametes when present, and
female gametes when present. Cells with * and in bold indicate significant differences between
comparison; blank cells=not tested; % of mature = % of sampled oysters that contained stage 3 male
or female gametes, per treatment.

Table 3: Offspring survival in the field. 1-year old juveniles were deployed for 3 months in four
bays in Puget Sound, Washington, in 2 sites per bay. Percent survival ± SD is shown by cohort x
bay x parental pCO2 treatment (Amb=841±85 µatm, High= 3045±488 µatm). Only offspring from
6°C-treated adults were deployed. Significant survival differences were detected between parental
pCO2 treatment within the Fidalgo Bay and Oyster Bay F2 cohorts (*), and across all cohorts (+).

Figure 1: Locations where O. lurida populations’ progenitors were collected (F, D, O), where

845

oysters were housed prior to and during the experiment (C), and where offspring were deployed

(F, P, S, I): Fidalgo Bay (F), Port Gamble Bay (P), Dabob Bay (D), Clam Bay (C), Skokomish

847

River Delta (S), Case Inlet (I), Oyster Bay (O).

848

Figure 2: Experimental timeline. Four cohorts of adult O. lurida (F, D, O-1, O-2) were

849

sequentially exposed to two winter temperatures (6.1±0.2°C, 10.2±0.5°C) then two pCO2 levels

850

(841±85 µatm, 3045±488 µatm). They were returned to ambient pCO2 conditions to volitionally

851

spawn. Larvae were collected and reared by cohort x temperature x pCO2. Juveniles (~1 year)

852

from 6°C-Ambient pCO2 and 6°C-Low pCO2 adults were deployed in 4 bays in Puget Sound.

Figure 3: Gonad developmental stages for male and female gametes, after 60-days in

854

temperature treatments but before pCO2 treatments (“Pre”, n=54) and after 52 days in high pCO2

855

(3045±488 µatm, n=39) and ambient pCO2 (841±85 µatm, n=39), which indicates that sperm

856

development was influenced by elevated winter temperature (more advanced) and high pCO2

857

(less advanced, 10°C treatment only), but oocyte development was not. All oysters were

858

assigned both male & female stages; if no oocytes were present, for example, that oyster was

859

designated as female stage 0.

Figure 4: Gonad sex, after 60-days in temperature treatments but before pCO2 treatments (“Pre”,

861

n=54) and after 52 days in high pCO2 (3045±488 µatm, n=39) and ambient pCO2 (841±85 µatm,

862

n=39). Winter conditions did not significantly influence gonad sex ratios.

Figure 5: Cumulative larvae released over 90 days of continuous volitional spawning under

pCO2 = 841 µatm (7.8 pH), and high pCO2 = 3045 µatm (7.31). Reproductive conditioning and

867

spawning occurred at 18°C, in ambient pCO2, and with live algae at a density of 66,000 ± 12,000

868

cells/mL.

869

Figure 6: Left: average number of larvae collected on a daily basis (excluding days where no

870

larvae were released). Daily pulses of larvae were larger in 10°C than 6°C, but only in oysters

871

exposed to ambient pCO2. For statistical analysis, data was normalized by number of oysters *

872

average oyster height (cm) (data shown is not normalized). Right: number of spawning days until

873

larval release peaked; peak release occurred on average 8.3 days earlier in 10°C treated oysters.

Letters (a, ab, b) indicate differences among treatments. Boxes contain values lying within the

Figure 7: Percent survival of juvenile offspring in the field. The four panels each represent

878

survival in one bay (Fidalgo Bay, Port Gamble Bay, Skokomish River Delta, Case Inlet). Within

879

each panel, boxplots are separated by parental pCO2 exposure (Ambient=841 µatm, High=3045

880

µatm). Points indicate % survival in each deployment pouch, and symbols indicate cohort

881

(Fidalgo Bay, Dabob Bay, Oyster Bay Cohort 1, and Oyster Bay Cohort 2). Letters (a, b) indicate

882

survival differences among parental pCO2 exposure within each bay. Boxes contain values lying

883

within the interquartile range (IQR), with median survival indicated by lines in the middle of

884

boxes. Whiskers extend to the largest value no greater than 1.5*IQR.
