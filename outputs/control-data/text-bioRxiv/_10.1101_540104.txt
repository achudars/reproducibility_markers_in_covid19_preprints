Ohno's hypothesis postulates that X-chromosome upregulation
rectifies X-dose imbalance relative to autosomal genes, present in
two active copies per cell. Here we dissected X-upregulation into
kinetics of transcription, inferred from allele-specific single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) data from somatic mouse cells. We
confirmed increased X-chromosome expression, and remarkably
found that the X-chromosome achieved upregulation by elevated
burst frequencies. This provides mechanistic insights into Xchromosome upregulation.
In therian mammals, the X-chromosome is present as two copies in
female cells while one copy in male cells. The X and Y-chromosomes
evolved from an ancestral autosomal pair on which the genetic sexdetermining factor Sry appeared around 166 million years ago1. To
preserve genetic linkage between Sry and Y-linked male-beneficial
genes, Y-X recombination was repressed, leading to Y-chromosome
degeneration and gene loss over time2. This rendered males
monosomic for X-linked gene products and thus imbalanced with the
diploid autosomal (A) part of the genome. Landmark theoretical
work3 by Susumo Ohno proposed that cells restore X:AA balance by
doubling the expression of chromosome X, resulting in the X:AA
expression ratio of 1 (analogous to X:A ratio 2). This concept (Figure
1a) is termed Ohno's hypothesis, and the emergence of this
compensatory process is presumed to predate the evolution of Xchromosome inactivation4 (XCI) by which female cells silence one Xchromosome to reach male-equivalent expression levels for X-linked
genes.
Several studies have reported X-upregulation in mammals, initially
using microarrays5,6 and later using RNA-sequencing7,8. But the
validity of Ohno's hypothesis has also been contested9-11, and a
caveat to bulk analysis is that cellular heterogeneity may skew
estimates due to cell subpopulations expressing chromosomes
unequally7. Emerging scRNAseq technology provides the opportunity
to asses X:A dose balance at the level of the actual regulatory system
(i.e. the cell); but dedicated scRNAseq studies are so far few11-14, and
some arrived at opposite conclusions regarding X-upregulation from
the very same scRNAseq data11,12. Moreover, a fundamental
limitation in all present scRNAseq analyses is that they lack unique
molecular identifiers (UMIs) needed to avoid library amplification
bias (which is particularly severe for scRNAseq cross-gene
comparisons)15, or, lack the full-length read coverage of transcripts
needed for allele-specific and single-gene-copy analysis. Finally,
eukaryotic gene expression occurs through episodic bursting of RNA
synthesis16-19, but kinetic studies of X-upregulation are completely
lacking. Here, we dissected X-upregulation using transcriptional
kinetics, providing mechanistic insight to this process.

We investigated primary female fibroblasts (n=224) and male
embryonic stem cells (ESCs, n=188) from outbred mice (hybrids of
CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J) that were subjected to full-length scRNAseq
with UMIs18 (Online Methods). We recently developed methods to
infer transcriptional burst parameters individually for each gene
copy18 using the two-state model of transcription20, providing allelespecific estimates of burst frequency (kon) and burst size (ksyn/koff)
(Figure 1b-c). In order to explore the kinetics of X-upregulation, we
first segregated female fibroblasts expressing either the maternal
(CAST, n=172) or paternal (C57, n=52) X-chromosome due to random
XCI. Expectedly, male ESCs (n=188) transcribed exclusively the
maternal X-allele (Figure 1d-e). To investigate X-chromosome
expression per cell, we first counted mRNAs de facto present in the
individual cells (i.e. ≥1 UMI) and calculated cellular expression levels
for genes on the active X and autosomal chromosomes. Strikingly,
cellular X-chromosome RNA levels were higher than those of
autosomes within the same cells (P≤ 1.2x10-9, paired Wilcoxon ranksum test) (Figure 2a). To avoid possible confoundment of few highexpressed genes dominating chromosomal expression estimates we
excluded genes beyond the 95th percentile of expression levels per
cell. Other thresholds such as the 90th and 99th percentile provided
similar results (Figure 2b) and the X:A difference was significant
across a wide span of thresholds (Figure 2c). Next, we determined
gene-wise expression-level distributions for chromosome X (n=149
genes, fibroblast C57 allele) and autosomes (n=3790 genes, fibroblast
C57 allele), including only expressed genes (average ≥1 UMI detected
per cell) that also had robustly inferable kinetic parameters (Online
Methods). This revealed a positively shifted expression-level
distribution for X-linked genes (median fold-change: 1.4, P= 4,2x10-5,
two-sided Wilcoxon test; fibroblast C57 allele) (Figure 2d-e).
Comparing distributions for all chromosomes, we observed such a
shift to be unique for chromosome X (Figure 2f-g). These results were
replicated over the fibroblast CAST allele and male ESCs
(Supplementary Figure 1-2). This confirms Ohno's hypothesis.
In the two-state model of transcription, expression levels are
determined by (1) the fraction of time the gene spends in
transcriptional on-state, generating a burst of RNA copies; (2) the
average number of RNA molecules synthesised during such a burst;
and (3) the degradation rate of RNA (Figure 1b-c). We compared
burst frequencies (kon) for chromosome X and autosomes.
Intriguingly, X-chromosome genes maintained distinctly elevated
burst frequencies (median fold-change: 1.5, P= 3.3x10-7, Wilcoxon
test, fibroblast C57 allele, Figure 3a-d). This was validated over the
fibroblasts CAST allele as well as in male ESCs (P= 3.7x10-6 and 1.1x
10-7, respectively) (Supplementary Figure 1-2). Next, we performed

similar analyses for burst sizes (ksyn/koff) and observed the lack of
significant difference between chromosome X and autosomes (P=
0.93; power: 99%, Figure 3e-h and Supplementary Figure 1-3). To
confirm that these kinetic features were not unique for fibroblast- or
ESC-specific transcripts, we repeated the analyses using
housekeeping genes (Online Methods) (Supplementary Figure 4).
Altogether, our results imply that X-chromosome upregulation
occurs through increased frequency of transcriptional bursting in
both female and male cells.
Previous studies21,22 found that X-chromosome transcripts tended
to have longer RNA half-lives than those of autosomes, suggesting
that lowered decay rates contribute to dosage compensation. We
used metabolic-RNA-labelling data from mouse ESCs (Online
Methods), and investigated RNA decay rates for X-linked and
autosomal genes. This indeed confirmed lowered decay rates for Xchromosome transcripts (P≤ 1.3x10-4, Figure 3i). However, we also
observed the general trend that expression levels negatively
correlated with decay rates independently of chromosomal origin of
RNAs (Spearman correlation –0.38 and –0.35; P= 9.9x10-5 and P=
1.0x10-79 for X and autosomal genes, respectively; Figure 3i). We
tested whether X-genes had lowered decay rates given their
expression levels by calculating the distribution of decay rates for
autosomal genes of same expression levels. X-chromosome genes
and matched autosomal genes had similar decay rates (medians 0.15
and 0.15, P= 0.50, paired Wilcoxon test) (Figure 3i). This does not
conflict that increased RNA stability might contribute to dosage
compensation, but does motivate the search for X-specific regulatory
features. We reasoned that if increased burst frequency is a key
mechanism to achieve X-upregulation, a shifted burst-frequency
distribution might be detectable even when compared to autosomal
genes of matched expression levels, albeit expectedly with a smaller
shift since the autosomal expression distribution would artificially be
shifted to higher values. Indeed, this was valid for both fibroblast
alleles as well as for ESCs (P= 0.039; 7.6x10-5; 1.9x10-4, respectively;
paired one-sided Wilcoxon test) (Figure 4j-k).
Here we investigated X-chromosome upregulation at the resolution
of transcriptional kinetics for the first time. Using scRNA-seq data
with both full-transcript coverage and UMIs, we simultaneously
obtained precise estimates of expression levels and detailed allelespecific information for single-gene-copy inferences. Analysing these
novel data, we confirmed the validity of Ohno's hypothesis by
detecting positively shifted expression-level distributions for
chromosome X both at cellular and gene-wise level (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1a-b). The observed ~1.4–fold change of X:A
levels (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure 1-2) rather than the
theoretical 2-fold change suggests that not all X-linked genes
attained dosage compensation, or that less than 2-fold upregulation
is adequate to achieve sufficient X:A balance for most genes.
While XCI has been extensively explored, providing profound
insights into gene silencing, mechanistic correlates to mammalian Xupregulation are few13,21,22. By breaking down expression levels into
kinetic parameters of transcription, we showed for the first time that
dosage compensation is achieved by increased burst frequencies on
chromosome X. Since burst frequencies are preferentially encoded in
enhancer elements18, it is likely that the increased transcriptional

output from the X-chromosome is due to trans-acting factors
affecting enhancers. Moreover, such factors would preferentially
target enhancers located on the X-chromosome.

Methods
Sequencing and classification of expressed X-chromosome allele in
each cell. A modified version of Smartseq223,24 was used to sequence
the transcriptomes of primary mouse tail fibroblasts (n=224) and
ESCs (n=188), as described in Larsson et. al.18 . In brief, we utilized a
modified Smartseq2 strand-switch primer containing a UMI (6-base
random sequence). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina
Nextseq 500, and sequence reads were mapped to the C57 and CAST
genomes, and reads spanning strain-specific SNPs were counted as
described previously18,25,26. The sequencing data is available at EMTAB-7098. In order to classify cells as either having the C57 or the
CAST X-chromosome active in the female fibroblasts, due to Xinactivation, we calculated the aggregated expression of all genes
and alleles on the X-chromosome and compared the sums. The
parental X-chromosome with the higher sum was classified as having
that allele active. In addition, we calculated the fraction of maternal
RNA as shown in Figure 1e to further verify this classification. All male
ESCs expressed only the maternal X chromosome, as these cells carry
only one X-chromosome copy.
Inference of transcriptional kinetics parameters. In the model of
transcription used, a gene switches to the on state and off state at
exponentially distributed times with rates 𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 and 𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 respectively.
When the gene is on, RNA is produced at rate 𝑘𝑘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 . Regardless of
gene state, the RNA is degraded with rate 𝜆𝜆. In brief, the probability
distribution for the steady state of the stochastic process illustrated
in Figure 1b is the Beta-Poisson compound probability distribution.
The parameters of this process were estimated in the time scale of
degradation (𝜆𝜆) by maximum likelihood. Detailed information
regarding the inference procedure is described in Larsson et. al.18. For
cells in which the C57 X-chromosome allele was active, we inferred
the parameter for autosomal genes at the C57 allele in the same cells
(n fibroblasts C57= 52, n ESCs C57= 188). For cells in which the CAST
X-chromosome allele was active, we inferred the parameter for
autosomal genes at the CAST allele in the same cells (n cells fibroblast
CAST= 172). RNA decay rates were obtained for mouse ECSs from
Supplementary Table 1 of Herzog et. al.27.
Comparisons between chromosomes. In all comparisons, we
included genes that were expressed (≥1 UMI) in the given cells and
that also had robustly inferable kinetic parameters (defined as:
within the bounds of the maximum likelihood procedure (10−3 <
𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 , 𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 < 103 and 1 < 𝑘𝑘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 < 104 ) and biologically feasible
(

𝑘𝑘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

𝑘𝑘𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

> 1)). For the cell-wise analysis of chromosome expression

levels (Figure 2a) we included genes that were detected (at least 1
UMI) in each individual cell and excluded genes beyond the 95th
percentile of expression levels per cell. We calculated the mean
expression level for each chromosome in each individual cell and
divided these values by the mean expression of all autosomal genes
in the individual cells (resulting in normalized cellular ChrN/ChrA
values). We repeated the analysis using different upper expression
thresholds, and cellular X:A differences were significant even when

excluding as much as the upper 50% of genes (Figure 2c). To compare
gene-wise expression levels between chromosome X and autosomes,
we calculated the mean expression for each gene across the cells of
given cell-type and genotype (C57 allele in cells having the C57-Xchromosome active, and CAST allele in cells having the CAST-Xchromosome active) and plotted a smoother kernel density. To
assess the probability of drawing a set of genes with a median equal
to or higher than that of X-linked genes from the autosomal
distribution, we randomly subsampled autosomal genes (n= n[X-linked
genes]; e.g. 149 in case of fibroblast C57 allele) and calculated the
median expression level. This was repeated 100,000 times (Figure
2e), and we calculated the fraction (f) permutations for which the
median of the random autosomal subset equated or exceeded the
median of chromosome X. Corresponding analyses were performed
for burst frequency (kon), and burst size (ksyn/koff). To assess the
differences between chromosomes in mean expression (UMIs per
cell), burst frequency, and burst size, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test as specified in the figure legends for each comparison.
Housekeeping genes used in Supplementary figure 4 were
ubiquitously expressed genes28 (genes expressed across 17 mouse
tissues).
Power analysis of detecting X-chromosome wide upregulation in
burst size. To assess whether we would have the power to detect a
1.4x change in expression level due to burst size, we randomly
selected 149 autosomal genes, increased their burst size by 1.4, used
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and noted the P-value of this test. This
was repeated 1000 times.

Figure 3. Burst frequencies of X-linked genes are higher than those of autosomal genes but not burst sizes.
(a) Distribu�on of burst frequency (kon) of autosomal and X-linked genes on the C57 allele in ﬁbroblasts. Wilcoxon rank-sum test
was used for signiﬁcance tes�ng. (b) Median burst frequency of randomly selected subsets of autosomal genes compared to the
X-linked genes (n=149 genes; 100,000 permuta�ons), and f deno�ng frac�on permuta�ons for which the autosomal median
reached that of chromosome X. (c) Distribu�on of burst frequency for each autosomal chromosome (light green), all autosomal
genes (dark green), and chromosome X (red). Centre lines denote the median; hinges denote the ﬁrst and third quar�les; whiskers
denote 1.5×IQR. One-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for signiﬁcance tes�ng. (d) P-values from all pairwise comparisons of
burst frequency between chromosomes using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. (e-h) Same as (a-d) but for burst size (ksyn/koﬀ). (i) Top
le�: Distribu�ons of RNA decay rate for autosomal, X-linked and expression-matched autosomal genes in the C57 allele in ESCs.
Top right: Correla�ons between RNA decay rate and mean expression level (n=2690 autosomal and 99 X-linked genes, spearman
correla�on). Bo�om: Distribu�ons of expression levels for autosomal, X-linked and expression-matched autosomal genes. Centre
lines denote the median; hinges denote the ﬁrst and third quar�les; whiskers denote 1.5×IQR. One-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test
used for signiﬁcance tes�ng. (j) Distribu�on of burst frequency for X-chromosome (red) and autosomal genes of matched (nearest)
expression value, shown for each allele in ﬁbroblasts and the C57 allele for ESCs. Paired one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used for signiﬁcance tes�ng between expression matched autosomal and X-genes.
