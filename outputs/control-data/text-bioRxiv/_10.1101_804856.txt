Abstract

52

Tropical regions are subjected to rapid land use changes altering species

53

composition and diversity in communities. The non-Apis bees are vital invertebrates

54

continued to be highly neglected in the tropics. We compared their diversity status,

55

richness and composition across natural areas and agroecosystems in Doon valley, a

56

subtropical-temperate landscape situated at the foothills of outer Himalayas in India. We

57

investigated how two major habitats relate to non-Apis bee diversity, specifically seeking

58

answers to (1) Whether natural habitat is a refuge to richer and rarer bee communities

59

than agroecosystems? (2) Are natural habitats important for supporting wild bee

60

populations in agroecosystems? (3) Do polyculture farms behave similar to natural

61

habitats and therefore support richer bee communities than monoculture? Observation and

62

pantrap sampling were used to collect data. We recorded 43 species belonging to bees of

63

five families. The findings of our investigation demonstrate the importance of natural

64

habitats as a potential refuge for non-Apis bees. The findings highlighted that Doon valley

65

harboured twenty-five rare species of non-Apis bees, and natural habitats are a refuge to

66

11 rare specialist species (clamtest; Specialization threshold K = 2/3, Alpha level =

67

0.005). Natural habitat diversity in Doon valley supports bee communities in nearby

68

agroecosystems (R2 = 0.782, SE = 0.148, P = 0.004). Polyculture practices in

69

agroecosystems (<100m from forest H’ = 2.15; >100m from forest = 2.08) in the valley

70

mimic natural habitats (H’ = 2.37) and support diverse non-Apis bee communities (2.08)

71

in comparison to monocultures (<100m from forest H’ = 2.13; >100m from forest =1.56).

72

Bees evolved with flowering plants over 120 million years and they suffice an ever-

73

growing anthropogenic nutrition needs with their services through enhanced agricultural

74

production in pursuit of forage. We finally recommend similar assessments of bee

75

diversity and plants they support in different habitats and vice versa.

Introduction

77

Pollinators have a crucial role to play in pollination, a key ecological service, that

78

enhances plant production [1,2]. Bees, in particular, are considered the prime pollinator

79

group [3,4]. Beekeeping has hence become an indispensable part of farming cultures

80

worldwide. Managed honey bees successfully pollinate and are responsible for the

81

production of seeds and fruits of about 75% of the most commonly consumed food crops

82

worldwide [5] and an unknown number of wild plants globally [1,2,5]. In addition to the

83

managed honey bees, pollination by the native wild bees is an indiscernible but

84

imperative process to the ecosystem. Native wild bees (non-Apis) other than honey bees

85

(Apis) are increasingly finding the center stage in the backdrop of the global decline of

86

the managed bees [6,7]. Over the last half a decade the honey bee populations suffered a

87

massive decline globally, predominantly in North America [8,9] and a Europe [10,11],

88

leading to pollinator crisis [12].

89

There are several reasons for the bee decline such as climate change [13,14],

90

pollution, pesticide usage [15,16], introduction of exotic species [17,18], electromagnetic

91

waves from mobile towers [19], and pathogens, [20] etc. Changing climate and land use

92

are among the prime drivers of pollinator decline degrading their habitats. Conversion of

93

additional natural land for agriculture is a significant cause of pollinator habitat

94

degradation [21]. It alters biodiversity [22,23], and is predicted to be one of the leading

95

causes of species loss in the future owing to anthropogenic modifications in the global

96

environment [24–26], particularly in the tropics. Tropical regions sustain rare and

97

endemic species of plants, animals and their ecosystem services. Owing to lack of

98

exploration and documentation, the discovery of many species may be yet remaining.

99

There is limited baseline information on the status of non-Apis bees in the changing

100

tropical and subtropical landscapes [27].

101

The global human population is estimated to reach nine billion by 2050 [28,29].

102

Catering to the nutritional needs of a rapidly growing population will mean the

103

conversion of natural habitats to agriculture [30]. Over the past twenty-five years (from

104

1990-2015) 129 million ha of natural land were lost to agriculture worldwide [31].

105

Tropical and developing countries such as India have undergone much rapid land cover

106

conversions. From 1880-2010 the land use land cover (LULC) in India the forests cover

107

decreased by 34% (134 million ha to 88 million ha) while the agricultural land increased

108

by 52% (92 million ha to 140 million ha) [32]. Studies demonstrate that natural habitats

109

are reservoirs of resources required by bees that may be absent in agroecosystems [7,33–

110

36]. Forest cover reduction and farmlands gaining vegetation uniformity with increasing

111

monoculture cause the loss of nesting and foraging sites of the bee pollinators [37,38].

112

Studies on semi-natural habitats have shown to differentially support bee populations in

113

agricultural landscapes [39,40]. Pollinators' utilize forest and agrarian habitats for

114

resources such as forage and nesting [22,41–44]. Monoculture reduces not only natural

115

areas [45] in and around farms but also the floral diversity [38]. The recent bee falloff is

116

attributed to increased conventional monoculture agricultural practices that reduce

117

wildflower abundance [16,46–49]. These practices upset the plant-pollinator community

118

structure [14] and function [50]. Agricultural intensification is an critical global change

119

presently leading to local and global consequences such as poor biodiversity, soil

120

depletion, water pollution and eutrophication and atmospheric components [51]. It can

121

negatively affect the insect pollination services, and thus, decreasing the production of

122

66% crops impacting the global nutrition supply [52]. In the wake of such information,

123

one wonders what kind of differences agriculture and natural habitat might bring to bee

124

diversity.

125

The Himalayan ecosystem is one of the global biodiversity hotspots. It is

126

gradually falling prey to alterations in climate and land cover, to support growing

127

economic needs. These very causes are affecting bee populations worldwide as well, and

128

the Himalayas are particularly sensitive to them [53–56]. Rising temperatures influence

129

plant reproduction and phenology. Mismatch of the plant life cycle will, in turn, affect the

130

pollinators [13,57–59]. Understanding the ecosystem services in the Himalayas has begun

131

[60]. The Global Pollination Project, in particular, investigated the contribution of insect

132

pollinators to the productivity of important crops such as oilseeds, fruits and spices

133

cultivated in the Indian Himalayas [61].

134

Himalayan agriculture is dependent on the managed pollinators for crop

135

productivity. A secondary economic source through honey production is an age-old

136

practice in these mountains [62–65]. The introduction of the non-native honey bees,

137

increasing anthropogenic pressures on the natural resources, climate and lifestyle

138

alterations are further challenging the traditional beekeeping in the region. Few

139

investigations revealed honey bee declines reported in the Himalayan ecosystems [62,65–

140

68]. The rate of honey bee decline in the region and South Asia on a broader scale is

141

unknown. This gap points out the need for utilizing the services of non-Apis bees to

142

improve the reproduction in the wild and cultivated Himalayan plants. Lack of

143

comprehensive investigation and historical records on non-Apis bees is a hindrance

144

towards understanding their ecological function and economic potential in the region.

145

Doon valley is a mosaic of natural, agricultural and human habitats, situated at the

146

foothills of the outer Himalayas. Demonstrating both, traditional chemical-free temperate

147

mountain farming and the conventional intensive cultivation from the Gangetic plains,

148

this Himalayan valley is a perfect example of the changing Himalayan LULC. Few

149

studies in the recent past that have looked at the insect pollinators in Doon valley. Jiju et

al [69] recorded pollinators and flower visitors viz. Dipterans (n= 7), Hymenopterans

151

(honey bees n=3-, wasp n=1-), Coleopterans (n=3), Hemipterans (n=1) and Lepidopterans

152

(n=4) in an organic farm. This investigation, however, lacked any records of non-

153

Apis bees. Migrating human populations from the mountains and the plains are causing

154

rapid land use alterations affecting diverse faunal species in the Doon valley (Yang et al.

155

2013). Transitionary climatic conditions and geography make the Doon valley a unique

156

landscape ideal for supporting a potential source population of non-Apis bees for the

157

surrounding areas. We investigate how two major habitats of LULC viz. natural and

158

agriculture in the Doon valley landscape, affect non-Apis bee diversity, specifically

159

seeking answers to (1) Whether natural habitat is a refuge to diverse and rarer bee

160

communities than the agroecosystems? (2) Are natural habitats important for supporting

161

wild bee populations in agroecosystems? (3) Do polyculture farms behave similarly to

162

natural habitats, thus support species-rich and diverse bee communities than

163

monoculture?

Study Area

167

Doon valley (latitudes 29 ̊59’ to 30 ̊30’ N and longitudes 77 ̊35’ to 78 ̊24’ E) is

168

situated in the western corner of Uttarakhand state, India (Fig 1). It is spread over

169

approximately 1850 km2 area with the elevation ranging from 330 m to 800 m above

170

mean sea-level. The valley is a mosaic of natural habitats such as forest patches, seasonal

171

and perennial riverine systems, agriculture land and urban settlements (Fig 2 and Table

172

1). Situated at the foothills of the Himalayas, the valley is sandwiched between the

173

Shivalik ranges. The rivers Ganga and Yamuna mark the south-eastern and north-western

174

boundaries of the valley, respectively. Doon valley is a fragile, tectonically active

175

landscape with a climate ranging from sub-tropical to temperate type. Ecologically, the

176

valley forms a landscape-level ecotone between the hot tropical plains and the temperate

177

Himalayan mountain ecosystems. Traditionally, the farming practice consists of multiple

178

crops in different seasons of cultivation viz. Kharif, Jayad and Rabi. The major groups of

179

crops grown consist of cereals (wheat, paddy, maize, and millets), oilseeds (mustard,

180

sesame, and linseed), vegetables (potato, tomato, brinjal, radish, cabbage, okra, pea,

181

onion, capsicum, French bean, ginger, garlic) and cash crops (sugarcane)[70]. The valley

182

is famous for its variety of rice called Dehradun Basmati [71]and fruit orchards of litchi

183

[72]. Other fruit orchards commonly cultured in the valley are pear, mango, guava, peach

184

and Indian gooseberry. Numerous local citrus varieties and vegetables are grown

185

seasonally in the valley for household consumption [70]. Based on the increasing

186

demands and economic benefits, crops such as wheat and sugarcane are taking over the

187

diverse cropping system in the Himalayas [73]. One can find many monocultures and

188

polycultures in the valley based on the type and scale of farming.

Study Design

196

Since we wanted to compare the bee diversity in natural and agriculture areas, we

197

sampled majorly different types of the habitats mentioned above in Doon valley. The

198

stratified random sampling design was followed in the two habitats (natural- 13500 sq. m

199

and agriculture- 7000 sq. m) across the study site. The minimum radial distance of 1km

200

was maintained between sites within a particular stratum. Sites were chosen such that a

201

50m buffer was left from the edge of the strata. Among the natural habitats, we sampled

202

sal Shorea robusta forests, riverine patches and small patches of diverse vegetation

203

(teak Techtona grandis, pine Pinus roxburghii, bamboo Bambusa sp. and derelict

204

tea Camellia sinensis plantations). Polycultures and monocultures consisting of food

205

crops and fruit orchards were sampled among the agricultural habitats. We laid 27

206

sampling plots in the natural habitat and 14 plots in the agriculture. The plots were belt

207

transects of 100m×5m with five subsampling plots of 5m×5m dimension. The study site

208

consisted of 203 subsampling plots in the natural (Sal- 45, riverine- 60 and

209

miscellaneous-30) and agricultural (polyculture- 33, monoculture- 35) habitats. The

210

sampling was carried out in the peak flowering periods. Three replicates were repeated

211

from February to May in 2012, January to May 2013 and 2014.

212

Bee Sampling and Identification- Bees were sampled using active and passive methods on

213

each transect. The active methods included visual observations using a transect walk and

214

net sweeping. Visual observations were performed with a walk along the length of the

215

transect searching for bees up to 2m on either side. Any sightings beyond this distance

216

were ignored. It took approximately 20 minutes to complete one transect walk. Three

217

temporal replicates of the transect walk were taken from 600 to 800 hrs., 1200 to 1400

218

hrs. and 1600 to 1800 hrs. Species unidentifiable in the field were collected using insect

219

nets for further identification. The passive method comprised of the use of coloured

220

pantraps to collect bees that are attracted to flower colours [74–77]. A set of three colours

221

of plastic pantraps were used: yellow, blue and white [39]. Initially, the pantraps were left

222

for 24 hrs. However, this duration yielded a low number to no bees. Thus, we left these

223

pantraps for 48 hours and collected them on the third day. In total, 1827 pantrap sampling

224

sessions were run (203 traps of three colours with three replicates) throughout the study

225

period across the valley. Bees collected using all the different methods was appropriately

226

curated. Specimens were stored either as a dried specimen and spread in insect boxes or

227

as wet specimen in 70% ethanol vials till further identification. A standard identification

228

key by Michener [4] was referred, to identify bees into families and further. We sorted the

229

specimen into morphospecies as recognizable taxonomic units (RTU) for further data

230

analysis [78–80].

231
232

Data Analysis

233

Active sampling resulted in 2799 (Sweep Net=34, Observation=2765) bee records

234

compared to passive (n=432) methods. We pooled the data obtained from both active and

235

passive sampling to assess the species diversity of bees across different families. We

236

calculated the bee species richness for all the habitats using non-parametric estimators

237

(Colwell and Coddington 1994). We computed the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to

238

examine whether bee species composition in the two primary habitats varied in Doon

239

valley using Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) [81,82]. A non-metric multidimensional

240

scaling (NMDS) ordination was performed on the rank orders of dissimilarity values

241

obtained from the ANOSIM. We encountered honey bees frequently (n = 2468) compared

242

to non-Apis bees (n = 331) in active sampling, suggesting an observation bias towards the

243

former. Hence, we used only pantrap records of bees for the ANOSIM. We performed a

244

multinomial species classification based on species habitat preferences to test the

245

association of bee compositions with natural and agricultural habitats [83]. The data for

246

all the agricultural sampling plots at varying distances from natural habitats was compiled

247

to explore whether natural habitats act as a refuge for bee communities of the

248

agroecosystems. We classified the distance of sampling plot in agriculture from the

249

nearest natural habitats into seven classes. Each distance class was 100 m wide beginning

250

at zero to 700 m. Individual Shannon diversity indices (H') were computed for each of the

251

eight distance classes. We used regression analysis on the Shannon diversity for each

252

distance class to investigate if nearness to natural habitat affects the diversity of bee

253

assemblages in agroecosystems.

254

We wanted to test whether polycultures behave similarly to natural habitats compared to

255

monocultures. For this we measured the Shannon-Weiner diversity of bees across 78

256

subsampling plots from monoculture and polyculture farms near (< 100m) and far from

257

forests or wilderness (> 100m) viz. 20 monocultures near to the forest, 20 monocultures

258

far from the forest, 18 polycultures close to forest and 20 polycultures far from forest. We

259

compared the farm Shanon-Weiner diversity values with that of the different forests

260

combined.

261

The analyses were carried out in the program R version 3.3.1 using package

262

"vegan"[84,85].

The species composition of bees was significantly more similar within habitats

272

than between habitats (R statistic = 0.20, p = 0.004) (Table 3). Bee composition in

273

agroecosystems slightly overlapped with the different natural habitats. We pooled the data

274

for the different natural habitats and overlaid it on that of agroecosystems. We found that

275

arable lands shared the majority of the species with the different natural habitats in the

276

Doon valley (Fig 3).

We classified the bees into habitat (agriculture, forest) specialists, generalists and

287

species too rare to be classified with confidence (Fig 4). Of the total bee species, 58.14%

288

were rare (n= 25), 25.58% (n= 11) were forest specialists, and 9.3% (n= 4) were

289

generalists and found in both the habitats. During sampling three bee species (6.98%) viz.,

290

Dwarf bee (Apis florea), Asiatic honey bee (Apis indica), and Andrena sp. three were

291

detected only in the agricultural habitats. It is interesting to note that these species were

292

observed inhabiting edges and interiors of the forests in the vicinity of the

293

agroecosystems. Hence, these species are not specialists to agroecosystems but use both

294

the habitats for foraging and nesting and may be subjective to availability of different

295

resources year-round.

Our results demonstrate that forests harboured the highest number of bees (n=21),

304

followed by polycultures near forests or wilderness (n=19) and monoculture near the

305

forest (n=15), polyculture away from the forest (n=13) and monocultures away from the

forests (n=9). The Shannon-Weiner diversity of forests was 2.37, monocultures near

307

forests were 2.13, polycultures near forest was 2.15, monocultures away from forest were

308

1.55 and polycultures away from the forest was 2.08. The bee community diversity

between monocultures and polycultures close to the forests were similar than those farther

Discussions

316

Continual land use changes to meet the needs of a growing human population are

317

predicted to be the primary drivers of species decline [24], including essential pollinators

318

such as bees [21]. The status of the vast majority of non-Apis bees remains uncertain

319

owing to inadequate exploration. Honey bees, on the contrary, form only a small portion

320

and yet have gained more considerable attention and became exhaustively studied. We

321

attempt to bridge this gap and investigate the role of changing land use in shaping the

322

non-Apis bee communities in a fragile river valley landscape at the foothills of the

323

Himalaya. Ours is the first study on bees of this region and may be used as baseline

324

evidence to compare future patterns in their communities locally. We found that Doon

325

valley harbours 6.3% of the 678 bee species recorded from the Indian sub-continent [86].

326

Our investigation pointed out that a majority of these species consist of the less explored

327

non-Apis bees (90.7%). Various bee researchers have demonstrated that honey bees

328

(genera Apis) are a tiny fraction of the vast majority of bees described from the world

329

over [4,87]. It is not surprising that the Doon valley demonstrates a similar pattern of the

330

bee biodiversity. Many (n = 30) bees recorded in the present study (n = 43) are segregated

331

into morphospecies and are yet to be identified up to species level. Using specific

332

taxonomic keys for bees may increase the total number of species in India.

333

We found that bee composition within habitats demonstrated more significant similarity

334

than between habitats in Doon valley. Interestingly, the bee composition of the

335

agroecosystems was a subset of the natural habitats. Bees require a diverse habitat with

336

resources for breeding, nesting, and foraging to complete their life cycles. All the

337

resources required may be unavailable within the habitats that bees occupy. For example,

338

some bees depend on particular plant pollen for proteins that may be highly nutritious for

339

reproduction [88]. However, flowers with such protein-rich pollen may not bloom year

340

around always, which makes them move from one habitat patch to another.

341

Agroecosystems are abundant sources of mass flowering and may serve as a food support

342

system for bees at a particular time of the year. Thus, numerous bees utilize both natural

343

and human-managed ecosystems such as cropland to suffice their nutritional, sheltering

344

and their reproduction requirements [22,41,43,44,88]. We sampled the bees in the peak

345

flowering period in Doon valley. During this is the period many farms in the valley have

346

abundant vegetables, fruits and oilseed plants in the various stages of flowering. Although

347

most bees nested in different natural habitats, agroecosystems may act as rich foraging

348

grounds for some species during the spring in the valley. Thus, the bee composition of

349

agroecosystems overlapped partially with that of the natural habitats in the valley.

350

Our study highlighted that more than half of the bees in the valley were rare. Patterns of

351

the rarity of bees through a large number of singletons reported may arise because of

352

under-sampling, an unrecognized universal trait of a rarity in communities or existence of

353

transient species that thrive well in other regions [89]. Williams et al. [89] tried to

354

understand the change in bee communities across the globe. They highlighted that the

355

native bee community are highly diverse and rich in rare species at local scales (due to a

356

large number of singletons at such scales). Several other researchers reported this pattern

357

in various studies across regions [90–94]. We sampled the valley in peak flowering

358

season, which may answer a part of the question of a rarity in species due to under-

359

sampling during other seasons. Considering that Doon Valley is a transition between two

360

different ecosystems, the other two possibilities of a large number of a rarity in

361

communities based on a universal pattern and transient species cannot be ruled out.

362

Over one-fourth of the bees, we recorded from the valley preferred natural habitats of the

363

forests. Few generalist species were found in both the habitats. Interestingly, 3 of the bee

364

species viz. Dwarf bee (Apis florea), Asiatic honey bee (Apis indica), and Andrena sp. 3)

365

were classified to prefer agroecosystems. Apis florea prefers bushy shrubs with strong

366

twigs to make their nests. Thus, they are highly sensitive to incidences, such as fires.

367

Forest fires are frequent in the valley from mid to end of the spring. Activities such as

368

leftover cigarette buds discarded by humans venturing into the forests for extracting

369

fodder and firewood usually trigger forest fires. They are intensified further by the dry

370

season. Hence, farm boundaries and hedgerows form favourable spaces for the dwarf bees

371

to build their nests beside the availability of abundant food in the spring. The Asiatic

372

honey bees are generalist feeders and feed in large numbers in farmlands with abundant

373

flowering crops. One can observe these bees foraging in large numbers on mustard and

374

other flowering crops in Doon valley in the spring. During different seasons these bees

375

are seen foraging on a diversity of wild and cultivated plants. They reside in parallel

376

combs similar to their close cousins, the Apis mellifera in hollows of trees, rocks or

377

undisturbed enclosed spaces in case of urban areas. Finding A. indica hives in farmlands

378

are rare unless there are intact patches of large trees with hollows or rocky patches.

379

Forests are suitable and typical habitats to find these bees. Andrena bees nest on well-

380

drained, steep open banks [95]. Field boundaries that are used to segregate different crops

381

in Doon valley provide such habitats in abundance. Morandin et al. [40] reported similar

382

observations in their study where untilled field margins adjoining roads provided suitable

383

habitats for Andrena bees to nest. Hence, these three species should be treated as

384

facultative rather than specialists as they utilize resources from both the forests and the

385

agroecosystems.

386

Agroecosystems at increasing distances from the natural habitats demonstrated lower bee

387

diversity in our study. Numerous studies in the past reported similar findings. Pollinators

388

depend on natural and semi-natural habitats adjacent to agroecosystems for supplemental

389

food resources and shelter [6,96–98]. Wild bees in forests demonstrate limited foraging

390

ranges. The valuable services of these bees influence agroecosystems in the vicinity of

391

forests [7]. Maintaining natural habitats within or surrounding the agroecosystems crucial

392

for wild bee pollination services [99].

393

Our results illustrate that monocultures close to forest ecosystems show diverse bee

394

communities than those farther away. Surprisingly, the bee richness in polycultures away

395

from the forests was similar to monocultures in close vicinity of the forests. Our results

396

demonstrate that polycultures behave similar to natural habitat in conserving bees. The

397

outcomes of our study indicate that polyculture farms had rich bee species compared to

398

monoculture. Earlier studies (Potts et al. 2003) showed that bee communities are

399

positively linked to floral diversities and prefer polyculture over monoculture [100]. The

400

traditional Himalayan agriculture consists of diverse crops [101]. Polyculture systems that

401

we sampled consisted of different crops in combinations of 2 to 4 species and wildflowers

402

on the bunds to segregate them, which may have supported a rich composition of bees.

403

On the contrary, our study recorded fewer bee species in monocultures of wheat

404

(Triticum spp.) and mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern). Wheat is wind-pollinated and

405

does not provide biotic pollinating agents with rewards such as nectar and pollen. In

406

monoculture, we found most bee species on mustard or on wild invasive plants such

407

as Lantana camara and Ageratum conyzoides that grew on the boundaries of the farms.

408

Polycultures have a greater diversity of native plants than monocultures which influences

409

the bee biodiversity in agroecosystems [102]. Our findings demonstrate that forests are

410

reservoirs of diverse bee communities in adjoining patches of agroecosystems. The

411

present analysis supports the fact that polycultures act as reservoirs of habitat to bees

412

compared to monocultures in close vicinity to natural habitats.

413

414

Conclusions

415

Our investigation on bees in Doon valley, a landscape with gradual changing

416

LULC at the foot of the Himalaya, is the first one to document the bees (Apis and non-

417

Apis) in the forest and agricultural habitats of the region. Our findings demonstrate that

418

the Doon valley landscape and its natural habitats are a refuge to a diverse community of

419

rare and specialist bees. Agroecosystems shared a lot more species in common with each

420

of the natural habitats. Forests and wilderness are essential habitats to support diverse bee

421

communities in and around the agroecosystems. Furthermore, polycultures support higher

422

bee diversities over monoculture practices. Wilderness along field boundaries such as

423

hedges stands as connectivity between different habitats. Monoculture expansions have

424

diminished these vital corridors [38,103,104], affecting the survival of pollinators [45].

425

Our study implies the importance of multi-crop farming and preserving as many natural

426

habitats as possible to attract native bees and benefit both cultivated and wild plant

427

production.

428

The global tree cover shows an increase of 7% (2.24 million sq. km) from 1982 to 2016

429

(Song et al. 2018), differing from a previous assessment claiming loss of forest (FAO

430

2015). India was ranked first in short vegetation gain (270,000 sq. km), most of which

431

can be attributed to the agricultural intensification under the green revolution [105].

432

Extension of land under intensive agrarian practices is a prime cause of deforestation and

433

loss of wilderness habitats. Wilderness play buffers to biodiversity that have lost intact

434

natural habitats. Loss of wilderness causes the extinction of several terrestrial species

435

across the global biogeographic realms, including the Indomalayan region [106]. Loss of

436

wilderness habitats comprising of essential resources can drive local pollinators

437

depending on them to extinction. Our investigation highlights that natural habitats are

438

integral to bee diversity. In the milieu of honey bee decline worldwide Polycultures give

439

some hope to non-Apis bee diversity in a Himalayan valley landscape. Thus, there is a ray

440

of hope to “land sharing and sparing” as Baurdon and Giller to feed a growing population

441

[107]. Using ecologically friendly farming such as polycultures nutritious biodiverse

442

food for a growing population can be produced while conserving wild pollinators

443

simultaneously. An assessment on similar lines is needed to understand bee diversity

444

occupying natural and arable habitats in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.

445

Besides, it is crucial to understand what percentage of these bees support crop production

446

and do our present agricultural practices in return support bees?
