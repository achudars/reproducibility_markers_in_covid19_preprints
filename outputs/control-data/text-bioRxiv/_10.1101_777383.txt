Abstract
An avenue to improve cereal yields is to harness and manipulate the plant microbiome to increase crop
nutrition and resistance to pathogens and abiotic stressors. To develop microbiome engineering
solutions, more research is needed to characterize plant microbiomes across contrasted geographical
locations, agricultural practices and plant genotypes. Previous work on the wheat microbiome focused
on bacterial diversity and more marginally on archaeal and fungal diversity. Hence, no integrative
assessment of the wheat rhizospheric microbiome including protist diversity (i.e. amoeba, ciliates,
stramenopiles) is currently available. Here, we characterized the rhizosphere microbiome of wheat by
considering both prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities in
soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal). The goals of this study were to
determine the influence of wheat genotype, agricultural practices (conventional vs organic) and soil type
on the rhizosphere microbiome. An additional goal was to determine if a rhizosphere core microbiome
existed across these different countries.
We found a limited effect of the wheat genotype on the rhizosphere microbiome (explain 2% of
variance) and observed that the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple
wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in microbiome structure
were observed between the eight soils studied (57% of variance) and the two agricultural practices (10%
of variance). However, despite these differences in microbiome composition across soils, we observed
that 179 taxa (2 archaea, 104 bacteria, 41 fungi, 32 protists) were consistently associated to wheat roots,
constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these few core taxa were highly abundant
and collectively represented 50% of the relative abundance of our entire wheat microbiome dataset.
We provide evidence of a wheat core microbiome and propose a “most wanted” taxa list, including 9
hubs (potential keystone taxa), that should be targets for future culturomics, metagenomics and for the
creation of wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we confirm that protists are an integral part of
the plant holobiont and we encourage more research to study their roles for plant nutrition and in
controlling plant diseases.

Introduction
Wheat, with a worldwide production of more than 730 million metric tons in 2018-19
(http://www.fao.org/statistics/en/) is now the second most important grain crop (behind corn) that is
mainly used for food, animal fodder, and industrial raw materials. To face the challenges of climate
change and of the nutritional needs of a growing world population, there is a necessity of a 70% increase
in cereal production by 2050 [1]. This increase in agricultural production needs to be sustainable and
have limited environmental consequences on biodiversity, human health and climate [2]. An avenue to
improve cereal yields is to harness and manipulate the plant microbiome to improve its nutrition and
resistance to pathogens and abiotic stressors [3]. The plant microbiome is comprised of complex
communities of bacteria, archaea, fungi and protists that interact with the host plant in different
compartments (e.g. rhizosphere, endosphere, phyllosphere) [4]. In particular, the root-rhizosphere
interface is the nexus of a variety of interactions from which the plant can benefit to acquire mineral
nutrients or water and thus is a compartment that is key for future microbiome engineering solutions in
agriculture [5].
Following the advent of next generation sequencing, several studies characterized the
rhizospheric wheat microbiome and investigated the influence of the compartment (rhizoplane vs
endosphere), crop management or wheat genotypes on the diversity and structure of these complex
microbial communities [6–9]. However, a great majority of these studies focused only on bacterial
diversity (16S rRNA gene) and more rarely on fungal diversity (ITS) [10–12]. To our knowledge, no
integrative assessment of the wheat rhizospheric microbiome including also the diversity of protists (i.e.
amoeba, ciliates, stramenopiles) is currently available. Protists as predators, saprotrophs or phototrophs
influence nutrient cycles in the rhizosphere and exert a strong top-down control on microbial (mainly
bacterial) biomass and composition [13]. Still, despite protists high diversity and biomass in the
rhizosphere, they represent an overlooked component of the plant holobiont.
Moreover, a limited number of studies investigated the effect of the soil used for growing wheat
on the rhizosphere microbiome [14,15]. For other crops, the culture soil has been demonstrated to be the
most important factor structuring the root microbiome before crop management and plant genotype
[16,17]. More work is thus required to study the influence of soil type and geographical location on the
wheat microbiome and hence determine which microbial taxa are specific to a soil/location or are
common across multiple wheat production systems (i.e. wheat core microbiome). Determining if a wheat
core microbiome exists is crucial to help orientate future strain cultivation-based efforts and design
microbiome engineering efforts through modifications of agricultural practices or microbial
inoculations.
These analyses to determine the presence of a wheat core microbiome need to be conducted at
the finest taxonomic level possible (microbial species or strain), as the ecologies and metabolisms of

closely related microbial taxa can be extremely different. Previous analyses of wheat microbiome
diversity were conducted by lumping amplicon sequences at a 97% identity threshold to create microbial
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were assumed to represent “species”. New analyses including
thousands of genomes indicate that optimal thresholds to represent bacterial species and discriminate
phenotypes is at 100% of identity (i.e. exact sequence variant) for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene
[18]. New denoising algorithms for amplicon sequences now enable to eliminate sequencing errors and
resolve exact sequence variants (ESVs) that vary only by one nucleotide [19]. These new bioinformatic
methods open new possibilities to characterize plant microbiomes and their thousands of microbial taxa
at the finest taxonomic level achievable by short-read amplicon sequencing.
Here, we characterized the rhizosphere microbiome of wheat by considering both prokaryotic
(archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities of different wheat genotypes
grown in soils from four different countries. The goals of this study were to determine the influence of
wheat genotype, agricultural practices (conventional vs organic) and soil type on the diversity, structure
and taxonomic composition of the rhizosphere microbiome. An additional goal was to determine if a
rhizospheric core microbiome existed by identifying microbial taxa present on wheat roots grown in
very contrasting soils from different countries. In a growth chamber experiment, we first characterized
the rhizosphere microbiome (here soil tightly bound to roots) of eight different genotypes of winter
bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in one soil (FR2) to assess specifically the genotype effect.
Second, we characterized the rhizosphere microbiome of three wheat genotypes grown in eight
contrasted soils (Table 1) collected from different countries: in Central Africa, Cameroon (CAM1 and
CAM2 soils) and West Africa, Senegal (SEN1 and SEN2 soils) and in Europe, France (FR1 and FR2
soils) and Italy (IT1 and IT2 soils). The total microbiome diversity was characterized using amplicon
sequencing of the marker genes 16S rRNA (prokaryotic diversity: archaea and bacteria) and 18S rRNA
(eukaryotic diversity: fungi and protists). At the taxon level (exact sequence variant), we identified the
core microbiome across all soils and genotypes and determined the relative abundance of these core taxa
and their potential role as hub taxa in the wheat microbiome using network analyses.

Results
Limited effects of wheat genotype on the rhizosphere microbiome in one soil
We observed limited effects of the wheat genotype on the rhizosphere microbiome after 30 days of
growth in experimental chambers under controlled conditions. There were no statistical differences on
the total ESV richness (272 to 368 total ESVs on average) and phylogenetic diversity (15.2 to 18.7 total
PD) between 7 genotypes for the total microbial diversity (Fig. 1A, 1B). Only the genotype BM
presented a lower diversity than some genotypes. Interestingly the genotypes recruited different
proportions of prokaryotes and eukaryotes on their root surfaces. Some genotypes with the highest
prokaryotic diversity (AP, RP, TM) presented a lower eukaryotic diversity, while the genotypes that
presented the highest eukaryotic diversity (CT, CH, CY) had low to intermediate levels of prokaryotic
diversity (Fig. 1A). As a consequence, no significant correlation was observed between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic ESV richness because of the contrasted patterns observed between the different genotypes
(Fig. 1C).
No significant effect of wheat genotype was either observed on total microbiome structure (Fig. 1D,
P=0.13). This limited genotype effect was also observed when analyzing the patterns separately on
prokaryotic (Fig. S1, P=0.04) and eukaryotic community structure (Fig. S1, P=0.22). The phylogenetic
trees show that hundreds of microbial taxa are associated to the roots of multiple wheat genotypes. We
observed that 117 microbial taxa were reliably associated (i.e. present in multiple replicates) to 3 or 4
wheat genotypes, 93 taxa were associated to 5-6 genotypes and 85 taxa to 7-8 genotypes (Fig. 1 bar
graph). These taxa associated to multiple genotypes were especially affiliated to the bacterial families
Burkholderiaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Caulobacteraceae or fungal Ascomycota and cercozoan Filosa for
the eukaryotes (list of 85 taxa associated to 7-8 genotypes is available in Additional file 1). Additionally,
we observed

that the bacterial

phyla or class

Actinobacteria,

Deltaproteobacteria and

Alphaproteobacteria were more specifically associated to the genotypes with a high bacterial richness
(AP, RP, TM, Fig. 1).

Characterization of wheat rhizospheric microbiome across eight African and
European soils
Strong effect of soil on the structure and diversity of the rhizosphere microbiome
Cultivation of wheat in different soils led to large differences in the ESV richness (100 to 380 total
ESVs) and phylogenetic diversity (8 to 22 total PD) of the rhizosphere microbiome (Fig. 2A, 2B). SEN1
soil had the lowest diversity and SEN2, FR1 and IT2 presented the highest microbiome diversity. The
two Cameroonian soils (CAM1 and CAM2) and the FR2 soil presented intermediate levels of diversity
(300-350 ESVs). The proportion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes varied between soils but across all soils
a positive relationship between prokaryote and eukaryote diversity was found (Fig. 2C, R2=0.4,
P<0.001). A very strong effect of the soil was also observed on the structure of the microbial community
explaining 57% of the variance, while the effects of wheat genotype (3 genotypes tested, 2% of the
variance) and the interactive effects between genotype and soil were not significant (Fig. 2D). The root
microbiome samples separated along the NMDS axis 1, mainly according to the continent where the soil
was collected (African soils on the right and European soils on the left). A clear separation between the
Cameroonian and Senegalese soils was also observed on the NMDS axis 2, while the differences in
community structure between the two European soils were not as strong.

Agricultural practices affect the structure and diversity of the rhizosphere microbiome
To assess the influence of agricultural practices, we took advantage of the fact that the Italian and French
soils were collected in long-term experimental plots under two types of farming practices at the same
location (conventional farming with chemical fertilization, and organic farming with culture rotation
with legumes or gramineous plants, Table 1). We observed a significant difference in total taxa richness
between the two agricultural practices, only for the Italian soils (Fig. 3A). Taxa richness was 56% higher

in the organic Italian soil than in the conventional Italian soil. However, we observed a significant
difference in microbiome structure between conventional and organic farming in both Italian and French
soils (Fig. 3B). The separations between Conventional and Organic microbiome samples were present
on the NMDS axis 2 and the agricultural practices explained globally 10% of the variance in community
structure (Fig. 3B). Using differential abundance testing, we identified 51 taxa that were significantly
enriched in conventional farming (in Italian or French soils) and 16 taxa in Organic farming (Fig. S3).
For the taxa enriched in Conventional farming, half were bacteria and the other half eukaryotes
(Cercozoans, Fungi and Oomycetes) including taxa affiliated to Chitinophaga, Flavobacterium,
Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Glissomonadida, Cordyceps or Phytophtora. For the taxa enriched in organic
farming, most bacteria were affiliated to Flavobacterium and Cellvibrio, while the eukaryotes were two
uncultured fungi, two uncultured Stramenopiles and the oomycetes Pythium.

Phylogenetic distribution of rhizosphere microbial taxa across the eight soils
Across the eight soils studied, we observed that the wheat rhizosphere microbiome was extremely
diverse with a total of 4760 ESVs identified. For the Prokaryotes, Archaea represented only 0.9% of the
reads (29 ESVs, Phylum Thaumarcheota only) that were affiliated to two archaeal families of ammonia
oxidizers (Nitrosophaeraceae and Nitrosotaleaceae) and the remaining 99.1% of the reads belonged to
3652 bacterial ESVs in the final dataset. Across all soils, the most abundant and diverse bacterial
families were Burkholderiaceae (10% relative abundance, 251 ESVs, phylum Proteobacteria) followed
by Chitinophagaceae (4.2% relative abundance, 296 ESVs, phylum Bacteroidetes) and

Flavobacteriaceae (4% relative abundance, 79 ESVs, phylum Bacteroidetes) (bubble plot, Fig. 4). For
the Eukaryotes (1125 ESVs), fungal taxa were the most abundant and diverse (61% relative abundance,
459 ESVs), followed by Cercozoa (17%, 415 ESVs) and Oomycota taxa (14%, 47 ESVs). The
eukaryotic dominant clades were Sordariomycetes (7.3%, 90 ESVs, Ascomycota), Peronosporales
(8.6%, 36 ESVs, Oomycota) and Chytridiomycetes (6.5%, 110 ESVs, Chytridiomycota) (bubble plot,
Fig. 4). As seen on the phylogenetic trees, these abundant and diverse prokaryotic or eukaryotic taxa
were present in multiple soils (Fig. 4). More specifically, when considering all the prokaryotic and
eukaryotic taxa associated to wheat roots (n=4760 EVs), we found that 402 taxa (8.5%) where observed
in both African (Cameroon and Senegal) and European (France and Italy) soils and that more than 2000
taxa where specific of the 2 continents (Venn diagram, Fig. 4). The phyla in which few taxa were shared
between continents (clear continental phylogenetic signals) were principally in the Acidobacteria,
Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes phyla for Bacteria and the phylogenetic signals were not as clear for
eukaryotes (Fig. 4). However, it is important to note that the large majority of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
ESVs were observed in multiple countries (Fig. 4).

abundant clades (relative abundance >0.5%) across all samples and the size of the points represent the
number of taxa (ESVs) in each clade.

Evidences for a root core microbiome shared across African and European
soils
2.9% of the microbiome diversity represent 50% of the rhizosphere microbiome abundance
Core taxa (ESV level) of the wheat rhizosphere microbiome were identified based on a criterion of
presence of the ESV in 25% of the samples with no relative abundance threshold (core taxa can be rare).
This prevalence criterion enabled the identification of the wheat core microbiome specific of Africa, of
Europe and common to both continents. The 179 ESVs that responded to the criterion defining a core
taxon in our study are indicated by a red triangle on the phylogenetic trees in Fig. 4. These core taxa
were distributed across all domains (2 Archaea, 104 Bacteria, 73 Eukaryotes) and spanned 65 families
(Fig. 5A, B) and 84 genera. We observed that 118 taxa out of the 179 taxa where observed in soils from
both continents (66%), while only 20 core taxa where specific of African soils and 41 of European soils
(Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, this list of only 179 ESVs on the total 4760 ESVs (prokaryote + eukaryote)
represented 51% of all the sequences in the dataset (Fig. 5D, E) indicating that collectively these 179
core taxa represent half of the relative abundance of the rhizosphere microbiome. From one soil to
another, the number of observed taxa belonging to this list of core taxa varied (Fig. 5C) with the SEN1
soil presenting only 22 core taxa on average (total relative abundance of 52%, Fig. 5D) and the FR2 soil
presenting 90 core taxa on average (total relative abundance of 65%, Fig. 5D). Interestingly, we did not
observe a positive correlation between the number of core taxa observed and their relative abundance in
a sample, indicating that across very different soils, these taxa always represented a high relative
abundance even when a low number of them were present (Fig. S4).
We also studied the relative abundance of each core taxon in the different soils and found that the core
taxa clustered in two main groups based on their distribution patterns across all samples (Fig. 6). These
results show that even if most core taxa are present in both African and European soils, they are generally
very abundant only in soils from one continent and not the other. The 98 taxa affiliated to the cluster 1
were predominantly very abundant in European soils and the 81 ESVs of the cluster 2 were most
abundant in African soils. Interestingly, the proportion of prokaryotes and eukaryotes were different
between the 2 clusters. The cluster 1 (dominant in European soils) was principally composed of bacterial
taxa (65%) and fungal taxa (19%) or protists were less represented, while the cluster 2 (dominant in
African soils) was dominated by eukaryotes (28% Fungi, 16% Rhizaria, 5% Stramenopiles) and
presented 48% of bacterial taxa (Fig. 6).

ESVs (65% Bacteria, 19% Fungi) and the cluster 2 regroups 81 ESVs (48% Bacteria, 28% Fungi, 16%

Co-occurrence network of the core wheat microbiome and identification of hub taxa
The cross-domain network of the 179 core taxa computed with the SParse InversE Covariance
estimation for Ecological Association Inference (SPIEC-EASI) was comprised of two main
components, one being dominated by bacterial taxa and the other dominated by fungal and cercozoan
(protists) taxa (Fig. 7A). The two main components broadly corresponded to the two clusters identified
earlier based on the taxa relative abundance across all samples, with the cluster 1 gathering taxa mainly
abundant in European soils and the cluster 2 in African soils (Fig. 7B). In the network, the predicted
interactions were predominantly positive (440 positive edges vs 56 negative edges) and for each ESV,
the average number of associations with other taxa was 5.54 (node degree). Eight taxa were identified

as potential “hub” taxa based on their centrality and number of associations in the network. These hub
taxa are hypothesized to be keystone taxa or key connector taxa in a community because of their central
position in the network and their high connectivity. Three fungal ESVs that were extremely prevalent
across all soils (60 to 85% of samples) were identified as hub taxa: Mortierella (Mucoromycota),
Exophiala (Ascomycota) and an uncultured Chytridomycetes (Chytridiomycota). The other five hub
taxa were bacterial ESVs in the Gammaproteobacteria phylum, one ESVs affiliated to the genus
Thermomonas and two ESVs from the Burkholderiaceae family: Massilia and an uncultured taxon; in
the Deltaproteobacteria class, one ESVs affiliated to the genus Anaeromyxobacter; in the class
Bacteroidia, one ESV affiliated to the species Niastella koreensis and finally an ESV from the class
Blastocatellia from an uncultured Blastocatellaceae. Interestingly, five of these potential hub taxa were

being often negative edges.

Fig. 7: Cross domain network of the rhizosphere core taxa including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (179 ESVs, n=60
samples). The lines (edges) between the taxa (nodes) represent the predicted interactions either positive (light blue) or
negative (red). The same network is presented twice but the nodes representing the different taxa are colored by their
domain or eukaryotic supergroup in the left figure (A) and are colored by their cluster affiliation in the right figure (B)
as defined in the heatmap in Fig. 5. The core taxa affiliated to the cluster 1 generally had higher relative abundance in
European soils, while the cluster 2 taxa were most abundant in African soils. The “Hub” taxa represented with a triangle
symbol in the networks were identified as the ones presenting the highest centrality (betweenness and closeness
centrality) and connectivity (node degree) in the network (panels C and D). These hubs are potential keystone taxa or
key connectors in the community. The taxonomic affiliations of the hub taxa are indicated in the bottom plots and they
are highlighted with triangle symbols.

A list of the most prevalent core taxa across all samples (>40% of samples) and of the ones identified
as hub taxa are presented in Table 1 (complete list in Additional file 1 with sequence and taxonomy
information). The most prevalent taxa across all samples were three eukaryotic ESVs affiliated to the
fungal genera Mortierella (85% of samples) and Fusarium (82%) and a cercozoan zooflagellate
belonging to the Allapsidae family (77%). The most prevalent bacterial taxa were Bradyrhizobium
japonicum (72% of samples) and an Arthrobacter (70%). We observed that the relative abundance
across all samples of the core taxa varied greatly (min=0.02%, max=5.7%) and that a majority of the
core taxa were relatively rare in terms of abundance in the community (median=0.1%). This was also
true for the eight taxa identified as hubs for which only two fungal taxa had a high relative abundance
(4.24% and 1.71%) and the six others had relative abundance inferior to 0.3%. Using a complementary
dataset not presented here, we determined that at least 33% of the core taxa were also observed in the
wheat endosphere in the same plant samples (Table 1).

Discussion
In this study, we took an integrative approach to characterize the rhizosphere microbiome (i.e. soil
tightly bound to the roots) of multiple wheat genotypes by considering the total microbial diversity,
including archaea, bacteria, fungi and protists in soils from different countries. We show that the main
drivers of the wheat root microbiome are the culture soil and agricultural practices, while wheat
genotypes had very limited effects. Across eight contrasted soils from two continents and three wheat
genotypes, we found that 179 prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa were consistently associated to wheat
roots, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these few core taxa were highly
abundant and collectively represented 50% of the relative abundance of the wheat microbiome on
average. This work enabled the identification of a “most wanted” taxa list for future wheat microbiome
research that will be targets for culturomic, genomic and synthetic community studies to develop
microbiome engineering in agriculture.
The wheat root microbiome is shaped by the soil and agricultural practices but not by the plant
genotype
By growing eight genotypes in the same soil, we observed that wheat varieties had very limited effects
on rhizosphere microbiome diversity (richness and phylogenetic diversity) and structure. The variability
among replicates of a same genotype was often larger than between genotypes. These results were
confirmed in our second sub-experiment where we did not find a significant effect of the three genotypes
selected in the eight test soils (only 2% of variance explained). These results are consistent with previous
work showing a small effect of the wheat genotype explaining only 1 to 4% of the total variance in the
community or effects appearing only after two years of cultivation on the field [6,14,20]. Hence, the
lack of genotype effect in our study could be explained by the short duration of our experiment with the
harvest taking place at the vegetative stage when root microbiome is not fully “mature” [6,21].
Consistent with the literature, the main factor shaping the wheat root microbiome diversity and structure
was the test soil (57% of the variance). A clear separation between African and European soils was
observed indicating potential continental effects on plant microbiome structure. It should be noted that
the two European soils were closely clustered on the NMDS, while the Cameroonian and Senegalese
soils were clearly separated on the second axis. We also observed distinct community structure between
the two soils sampled from each country, that were the strongest for the two Senegalese soils. These
separations could be explained by differences in soil parameters, especially pH (lower pH in African
soils in our study) that has been found to be the main soil parameter influencing wheat microbiomes at
a regional scale in China [15].

Large differences in taxa richness and phylogenetic diversity were present between the eight soils (100
to 380 total taxa), indicating that not only the microbiome composition was different but also the number
of taxa selected by the plant, as already shown in the wheat rhizosphere [7,14,20]. We did not observe
clear diversity patterns associated to countries, for instance the two Senegalese soils had respectively
the lowest and highest phylogenetic diversity of the study and large differences in ESV richness were
also observed between the two Italian soils. In contrast, the diversity indices of the two Cameroonian or
French soils were not statistically different from each other despite large differences in soil properties
and agricultural practices. Interestingly across all soils, prokaryotic diversity was positively correlated
to eukaryotic diversity signifying that the environmental conditions favourable to high diversity are
similar across all microorganisms. These results show in the contrasted eight soils studied that
prokaryotic diversity is 2 to 3 times higher than eukaryotic diversity on wheat roots.
Agricultural practices were also a significant driver of microbiome structure (10% of the variance) in
Italian and French soils in which we compared root microbiomes between conventional and organic
farming. However, the taxa richness was significantly affected by agricultural practices only in the
Italian soils. These results are very similar to the findings of Hartman et al. (2018)[9] that observed more
effects of conventional vs organic practices on wheat microbiome structure (9-10% of the variance) than
on diversity but also with other studies in various cropping systems [11,21]. The IT2 soil sampled from
an organic farming field presented a higher taxa richness (56% higher) than IT1. It is noteworthy that
this IT1 soil has been sampled from a field uninterruptedly sowed for 15 years with small grain cereals
(wheat and barley) that can be considered a long-term monoculture that were cultivated adopting
conventional farming procedures. The lower microbial diversity of IT1 soil in comparison with the other
European soils can be explained by the different hypotheses. First, the higher diversity in the IT2 organic
field could be associated to the addition of new microorganisms with amendments in organic farming.
Moreover, crop rotation compared to long-term monocropping is leading on average to a ∼15.1%
increase in microbial richness [22].
The root-associated microbiome was dominated by the bacterial family Burkholderiaceae (10% of all
sequences), oomycetes from the order Peronosporales (8.6%) and fungi from the Sordariomycetes
(7.3%) and Chytridiomycetes (6.5%) classes. The diversity of protists, especially Cercozoans, was
extremely high, representing half of the eukaryotic diversity in the microbiome, with many abundant
predator taxa affiliated to Rhogostoma (testate amoebae), Allapsidae-Group Te (glissomonads) and
Sandonidae (glissomonads). This study shows that non-fungal eukaryotes are diverse and abundant on
wheat roots and they deserve more attention to determine their functional roles in nutrient cycling and
in controlling microbiome structure through microbial predation.
While many taxa were found to be shared between different genotypes and soils (see core microbiome
section below), we also observed microbial taxa that were specific of some soils or agricultural practices

and that were responsible for the significant shifts in community structure and diversity presented above.
In particular, ESVs affiliated to the Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes phyla were often found
only in African or European soils but not in both, suggesting a continental phylogenetic signal or full
clades sensitive to differences in soil pH. Differentially abundant taxa between conventional and organic
farming were identified in almost all groups (bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, cercozoans) indicating a clear
restructuring of the microbiome as a whole. Interestingly, potential plant pathogenic taxa were found to
be enriched in conventional (Phytophtora) or organic farming (Pythium).
Using an integrative approach of the plant microbiome, contrary to most studies that separate bacteria
and fungi in their analyses, we intentionally grouped all taxa in our structure and diversity analyses
together to present a global view of the wheat microbiome as it occurs in nature. With this approach, we
show that the soil and agricultural practices are the key drivers of wheat root microbiome and that a
large part its micro-eukaryotic diversity is constituted of protists that has been so far overlooked in the
plant holobiont.
Evidences for a wheat core microbiome and identification of hub taxa
Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa were found to be consistently associated to wheat roots from
multiple genotypes and soils, with the exact same 16S or 18S rRNA sequence variants detected in soils
sampled thousands of kilometers apart. More specifically, we identified 179 taxa that constitute the core
microbiome of wheat roots in eight African and European soils. These core taxa where highly prevalent
(present in multiple soils) but also very abundant which was not necessarily expected as we did not
impose a relative abundance threshold to identify core taxa. Collectively, these 179 taxa (2.9% of the
total diversity) represented 50% of the reads in the dataset, suggesting an important biomass of these
microorganisms on root surfaces. These findings show that under very contrasted conditions (continents,
soil types, farming practices, wheat genotypes), wheat associates with the same microbial species or
strains (ESV level) which indicate a potential co-evolution between wheat and these microorganisms.
These results are consistent with large-scale microbiome studies that identified the core microbiome of
different plants like Arabidopsis thaliana [16] or sugarcane [23] and a global soil microbiome study that
highlighted that only 500 OTUs account for half of soil microbial communities worldwide [24].
The wheat root microbiome can be diverse and variable (100 to 380 taxa) but these findings show that
it can be decomposed in two parts: a core microbiome presenting a low diversity that is stable and
abundant across conditions; and an “accessory” microbiome that is extremely diverse and conditionspecific [25]. This observation is consistent with a previous wheat microbiome study that showed that
highly co-occurring taxa (i.e. potential core taxa) were not affected by cropping practices and that the
“accessory” wheat microbiome could be manipulated by changes in farming practices [9]. The high
prevalence and abundance of the core taxa identified suggest an ecological significance in the root
habitat and warrants further research to isolate and phenotype these organisms that are mainly uncultured

(i.e. 62 core taxa without genus affiliations). Based only on amplicon sequencing data, we cannot
determine the role of these microorganisms for plant fitness or if the absence of some of these core taxa
could impact the wheat microbiome or plant health. Thus, here we provide a “most-wanted” list
composed of 2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 32 protists that should be the target of future
culturomics, metagenomics and for the creation of wheat synthetic microbiomes.
Most of these core taxa were present in both African and European soils (118 taxa) but based on their
relative abundance they grouped into two clusters, with taxa having a higher abundance in either
European soils (Cluster 1) or African soils (Cluster 2). These results were confirmed in the cross-domain
network of all core taxa that separated into two main components that broadly corresponded to the two
clusters. Future synthetic community studies should consider and evaluate the effects of contrasted
relative abundances of the core taxa to represent realistic structuration of the wheat microbiomes.
Among all core taxa, a fungal ESV affiliated to the genus Mortierella (phylum Mucoromycota) occupied
a crucial place in the wheat microbiome. This taxon had the highest prevalence (85% of samples) and
relative abundance in the dataset (4.2%) and was identified as a hub taxon in the cross-domain network.
This Mortierella ESV was detected on the wheat rhizoplane but also in the endosphere in a
complementary dataset not presented in this article. This fungus is described as a saprotrophsymbiotroph [26] capable of solubilizing phosphate in the rhizosphere [27]. Our results are consistent
with other studies that identified Mortierella as a keystone taxa of the wheat rhizosphere unsensitive to
cropping practices in Switzerland or the USA [9,28] with potential positive effects on wheat yield in
Canada [29]. Altogether, these findings encourage future research to develop targeted cultivation
approaches of the wheat-associated Mortierella fungi that seem to play a central role in the wheat
microbiome across the world. The other most prevalent fungal core taxa were affiliated to the genera
Fusarium (Ascomycota, 82% of samples), Exophiala (Ascomycota, 62% of samples, hub) and
Chaetomium (Ascomycota, 60% of samples) described as pathotrophs or saprotrophs that also have been
observed on wheat roots in different cropping systems and described as hub taxa [21,28,30].
The taxonomic group that exhibited the highest number of core taxa was bacteria (103 taxa) with the
dominant family Burkholderiaceae presenting the highest number of core taxa (28 taxa) including two
hub taxa. In particular, an ESV affiliated to the genus Massilia was identified as a hub taxon in the wheat
microbiome of our study. This taxon is known as a copiotrophic root colonizer [31] found to be dominant
in the wheat and maize rhizosphere [11,32]. The most prevalent bacterial core taxon was
Bradyrhizobium japonicum (Alphaproteobacteria, 72% of samples), a species frequently found in rootassociated microbiomes, and which can fix nitrogen in symbiosis with legumes (especially soybean).
Here, we show also that archaea and protists that are microbial groups generally ignored in most plant
microbiome studies were characterized as wheat core taxa. The two archaea identified as core taxa were
both affiliated to the genus Nitrososphaera (Phylum Thaumarcheota) that are involved in the nitrogen

cycle as ammonia-oxidizers in the nitrification process (oxidation of ammonia in nitrate) [33] and are
very abundant in soils [34,35]. Interestingly, another nitrifier taxa affiliated to the bacterial genus
Nitrospira (Nitrospira phylum, 67% of all samples) was also identified as core taxon which suggests
that microorganisms involved in nitrification could play an important role for nitrogen availability on
roots. Nitrososphaera taxa were described as hubs in the wheat rhizosphere [30] and as highly prevalent
in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of Arabidopsis thaliana and maize [36,37], indicating that root
surfaces represent a common habitat for these archaea.
Among protists, the most prevalent core taxa were all cercozoans from the phyla Filosa-Sarcomonadae
and Filosa-Granofilosea affiliated to Allapsidae – Group Te (77% of samples), Limonofila borokensis
(70%) and Paracercomonas (63%). These three taxa have also been identified as extremely common
and abundant in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana [38] and Allapsidae – Group Te as a hub taxon
in the maize rhizosphere [39]. Five Oomycetes were also categorized as core taxa with three of them
affiliated to the Pythium genus and one to Phytophthora that are both described as potential plant
pathogens. These observations are consistent with previous plant microbiome studies considering
oomycetes diversity, that always described Pythium as the most dominant taxa among oomycetes
[38,40,41]. These results confirm that protists are an integral part of the plant holobiont and their roles
in controlling microbial populations through predation, disease incidence or contribution to nutrient
cycles through the microbial loop deserve more attention [13].

Conclusions
This work presents a detailed characterization of the wheat root-associated microbiome under contrasted
environmental conditions and propose a “most-wanted” list of microorganisms identified as core and
hub taxa. In this list of 179 prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, 62 are uncultured taxa (no genus affiliation)
and only 11 taxa have a species affiliation, suggesting that almost nothing is known about the ecology
of the key microorganisms associated to a major crop like wheat. Future research efforts are needed to
try to cultivate these microorganisms associated to wheat as they could unlock new knowledge and
biotechnological resources to improve crop yields and resistance to diseases in a sustainable way. These
efforts should be conducted with an integrative approach of the plant holobiont by not only focusing on
bacteria and fungi but also considering archaea, oomycetes and cercozoans.

Methods

Eight soils primarily cultivated with wheat which have been previously treated with chemical or organic
fertilization were collected from four countries: Senegal and Cameroon (West and Central Africa);

France and Italy (Europe). They were chosen for their contrasting physico-chemical and land-use
characteristics to represent a diversity of agricultural practices (conventional, organic, agroforestry),
texture, pH, carbon and nutrient contents (Table 1). The soils from France and Italy were collected from
long-term experimental plots comparing conventional and organic cropping practices and were used to
test the influence of agricultural practices on the wheat microbiome. In each field, we collected 12
microsites distant of 20 m from each other and from 0 to 15 cm depth (500 g each). After passing through
a 4 mm sieve, samples from the same field were mixed together, a sub-sample was used for physicochemical analyses, and the remaining was used for pot experiments. The soil samples were shipped to
France to the lab IPME to perform the experiments described below. All soil analyses were performed
at the Laboratoire des Moyens Analytiques (LAMA) using published protocols: pH and electrical
conductivity (EC) in an aqueous extract [42], soil particle size distribution [43], total organic carbon
[44], total and available concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus.

Experimental design: 2 sub-experiments
During the same experiment, we performed two sub-experiments in a growth-chamber under controlled
conditions in Montpellier (France) with the eight soils collected from African and European countries.
The sub-experiment 1 looked at the effects of tender wheat genotype alone on the root microbiome by

growing eight genotypes in one soil (FR2). The eight winter bread wheats grown in this sub-experiment
were: Apache (AP), Bermude (BM), Champlein (CH), Carstens (CT), Cheyenne (CY), Rubisko (RB),
Soissons (SS) and Terminillo (TM).
The Sub-experiment 2 looked at the interactive effects of wheat genotype and soil on the wheat root
microbiome. Three genotypes from the eight presented above where selected (AP, BM, RB) and were
grown in the eight soils collected in Africa and Europe. These three genotypes were selected because
they are the most recent genotypes (in terms of date of registration) and are highly cultivated.
Plant growth and harvest
Seeds were surface disinfected by washing for 40 min in a 9,6% sodium hypochlorite solution [45],
rinsed 5 times for 3 min in sterile water, then chlorine traces were removed by washing 3 times for 7
min in 2% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate [46] and then rinsed 5 times again for 3 min in sterile water, and
left in sterile water for another 45 min. Sterilized seeds were then incubated for germination on sterile
agar plates (8 g.L-1) for 2 days in the dark at 27°C. Five germinated seeds of each genotype were grown
on each sampled soil mixed with 50% of sterile sand (size 0.4 to 1.4 mm) in pots of 400 mL with 3
replicates per condition. All pots were incubated in a growth chamber (Temperature day/night:
22°C/18°C, duration day/night: 16 h/8 h, humidity: 60-65%) for a month corresponding to the 3-4 leaf
stage at sampling time. The plants were covered with a transparent plastic bag to avoid cross
contaminations, especially during watering. Overall, for the sub-experiment 1, eight varieties of wheat
were grown in one soil (8 conditions) in triplicates (24 pots). For the sub-experiment 2, three varieties
of wheat were grown in eight soils (24 conditions) in triplicates (72 pots). At the end of the experiment,
the three tallest plants from each pot were selected. Their roots were collected and shaked to remove
non-adhering soil, and placed in sterile falcon conical tubes (50 ml) containing 20 mL of NaCl 0.9% to
collect rhizosphere soil (tightly bound to roots). These tubes were vortexed for 5 min, roots were
removed from the tubes and the tubes were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm (Eppendorf). After
centrifugation, the pellet constituting the rhizosphere microbiome was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80˚C before DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing
Total DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil Extraction Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the DNA was checked by gel
electrophoresis and quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometer. DNA samples were stored at -80°C.
The total DNA samples were used as templates using primers F479 and R888 for V4-V5 region of 16S
rRNA amplicons and primers FF390 and FR1 for V7-V8 region of 18S rRNA amplicons [47]. For 16S
rRNA gene fragment, 5 ng of template were used for a 25µl of PCR conducted under the following
conditions: 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 52°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1min, following by 7

min at 72°C. Similarly, 18S rRNA gene fragment was amplified under the following PCR conditions:
94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 52°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, following by 5 min at
72°C. For both, PCR was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (BioLabs). The
PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and quantified using the
PicoGreen staining Kit. Next steps were performed by Genome Québec platform: a second PCR of nine
cycles was conducted twice for each sample under similar PCR conditions with purified PCR products
and 10 base pair multiplex identifiers added to the primers at 5’ position to specifically identify each
sample and avoid PCR bias. Finally, PCR products were purified and quantified. The high-throughput
sequencing was performed on a MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) by Genome Québec
platform. All Illumina sequence data from this study were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive
(ENA) under accession number PRJEB34506.

Bioinformatic analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences
The raw 16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA gene sequences were processed using Qiime 2 (version 2019.1)
[48]. After performing a quality screening, we used DADA2 [49] to process the raw sequences into
exact sequence variants (ESVs). DADA2 resolves biological sequences at the highest resolution (level
of single-nucleotide differences) that correspond to the best proxy to identify microbial species [18].
The DADA2 workflow performs filtering, dereplication, chimera identification, and the merging of
paired-end reads. The taxonomic affiliations were assigned using the SILVA 132 database [50](Quast
et al. 2012) for the 16S rRNA gene sequences and the Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR2) [51]
for the 18S rRNA gene sequences. ESVs present in only one sample and with less than 10 observations
in the entire dataset were excluded. ESVs affiliated to chloroplasts, mitochondria (16S rRNA gene
dataset), to Chloroplastida or to Animalia (18S rRNA gene dataset) were removed in order to keep only
microbial ESVs. We used negative controls and the Decontam package [52] in R 3.5.2 [53] to identify
contaminant sequences from reagents or introduced during the manipulation of the samples. Four 16S
rRNA gene ESVs and seventeen 18S rRNA gene ESVs were identified as contaminant and removed
from the dataset. For the 16S rRNA gene dataset, a total of 5145 ESVs and 1455888 reads were present
in the final dataset. This prokaryotic dataset (bacteria and archaea) was rarefied to 1018 sequences per
sample and 8 samples had to be excluded due to low read numbers after removing non-microbial
sequences. For the 18S rRNA gene dataset, a total of 1409 ESVs and 1281880 reads were present in the
final dataset. This eukaryotic dataset (micro-eukaryotes) was rarefied to 1127 sequences per sample and
6 samples had to be excluded due to low read numbers after removing non-microbial sequences.
Phylogenetic trees of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene ESVs were prepared in Qiime2 (function qiime
phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree) and their visualizations were performed using iTOL [54].

Diversity and core microbiome analyses
We explored the effects of the wheat genotype, agricultural practices and soil on the alpha diversity of
the rhizosphere microbiome by calculating the observed ESV richness and Faith’s phylogenetic
diversity (R package picante) [55]. The effects on microbiome community structure were investigated
based on a Bray-Curtis distance matrix visualized using Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling
(NMDS, metaMDS function) and associated to a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (adonis
function, 999 permutations) in the R package vegan [56]. The core taxa representative of the eight
African and European soils used in this study were identified based on a criterion of prevalence in at
least 25% of the samples (i.e. presence in a minimum of 16 of the 64 samples) with no criterion related
to the relative abundance of the taxa, to consider rare but prevalent microbial taxa (function
core_members in microbiome package) [57]. Based on this criterion, a list of core taxa was identified
and the number and cumulative relative abundance of these core taxa in each sample were calculated.
This prevalence criterion enabled the identification of the wheat core microbiome specific of Africa, of
Europe and common to both continents. The taxonomic affiliation of the core taxa was verified and
refined using nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) analyses.
We inferred cross-domain interaction networks of the wheat core taxa using the SParse InversE
Covariance estimation for Ecological Association Inference (SPIEC-EASI, version 1.0.2) package in R
[58,59]. We identified hub taxa that may act as potential keystone taxon in an ecological network,
following the approach used in Tipton et al. (2018) [59] and Agler et al. (2016) [60]. Hub taxa were
identified based on their high connectivity and centrality within the network compare to the other taxa
using three node parameters: node degree (number of correlations with other taxa), betwenness centrality
and closeness centrality. The node parameters were determined using the R package igraph (version
1.2.4) [61] and the visualization of the network was performed with the package ggnet (version 0.1)
[62].
The statistical effects of the wheat genotype, agricultural practices and/or soil (and their interaction,
when applicable) on the univariate endpoints (e.g. ESV richness, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, number
of core taxa) were assessed using generalized linear models (glm function in package lme4) and post
hoc comparisons were performed using the Tukey method (warp.emm function in package emmeans).
Linear regressions using Spearman correlation test were conducted to investigate relationships between
the prokaryotic (16S rRNA gene dataset) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA gene dataset) ESV richness or
between the number of core taxa and the relative abundance of core taxa per. Heatmaps were performed
using the R package pheatmap and scatter plots were prepared using the package ggplot2 (version 3.1.1)
[63].
