Abstract
Cep152 and Cep63 act as the cradle and recruit Plk4 to initiate the centriole biogenesis in a
mother centriole dependent manner. However, how the Cep152-Cep63 complex is targeted to the
proximal end of mother centrioles is unclear. In this study, we show that Cep57 and its paralog,
Cep57l1, colocalize with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of mother centrioles in both
cycling cells and differentiated multiciliated cells. Both Cep57 and Cep57l1 associate with the
Cep152-Cep63 complex by directly binding to the centrosomal targeting region of Cep63. Codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57l1 blocks the loading of Cep63-Cep152 to the centriole and
subsequently prevents centriole duplication. We propose that Cep57 and Cep57l1 act together to
ensure the recruitment of the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the mother centrioles for procentriole
formation.

Introduction
In mammalian cells, centrosomes function as spindle poles in mitosis and basal bodies for
cilia formation. Typically, a centrosome is made of two cylindrical centrioles surrounded with
pericentriolar material (PCM) (Nigg and Raff, 2009). In dividing animal cells, the duplication of
centrioles must be tightly controlled to ensure the correct bipolar spindle formation, which is
important for the integrity of genome. Aberration in centriole duplication is commonly present in
numerous tumors and other diseases (Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011; Gonczy, 2015; Nigg and
Holland, 2018). Recent years, great progress has been made to understand the molecular
mechanism of centriole biogenesis. To initiate the centriole duplication in mammals, Plk4 is
firstly recruited by the Cep192-containing ring around the proximal mother centrioles at the early
G1 phase and subsequently translocated to the larger Cep152-containing ring when Cep152 is
recruited to the mother centriole(Kim et al., 2013; Sonnen et al., 2013). At the Cep152-ring, Plk4
recruits and phosphorylates Stil/Sas-5 to load Sas-6 for the cartwheel formation (Arquint et al.,
2015; Arquint et al., 2012; Cizmecioglu et al., 2010; Dzhindzhev et al., 2010; Moyer et al., 2015;
Ohta et al., 2014; Ohta et al., 2018). Several proteins, including Cep135, Cpap, Cp110 and
Cep120, contribute to build the centriolar MT wall and mediate centriole elongation(Azimzadeh
and Marshall, 2010; Brito et al., 2012; Carvalho-Santos et al., 2012; Comartin et al., 2013; Hung
et al., 2004; Kohlmaier et al., 2009; Loncarek and Bettencourt-Dias, 2018; Schmidt et al., 2009).
It is known that Cep152 is recruited by Cep63 to act as the cradle for the mother centriole
dependent (MCD) centriole biogenesis (Brown et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2019; Sir et al., 2011;
Zhao et al., 2013). However, it is still unclear how Cep63 or the Cep63-Cep152 complex is
targeted at the proximal end of mother centrioles.

Cep57, a FGF-2 binding and trafficking protein, has been reported to be required for normal
centriole duplication, proper chromosome segregation, PCM organization and centriole
engagement (Bossard et al., 2003; Cuevas et al., 2013; Meunier et al., 2009; Snape et al., 2011;
Wu et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2016). Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152 form a stable complex at the
proximal end of the centrioles and Cep57 is the proximity interactor of Cep63 (Firat-Karalar et
al., 2014; Fortun et al., 2018; Lukinavicius et al., 2013; Sieben et al., 2018), suggesting that
Cep57 may act as the upstream protein to target the Cep63-Cep152 complex for centriole
duplication.
In this study, we find that Cep57l1 is the paralog of Cep57 and these two proteins recruit the
Cep63-Cep152 complex for the centriole duplication.

Results and Discussion
Cep57 specifically co-localizes with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of mother
centrioles
To investigate the spatial relationship of Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152, we costained Cep57
with either Cep63 or Cep152 in U2OS cells. Consistent with the previous study(Lukinavicius et
al., 2013), 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) results showed that Cep57 formed a
ring-like structure with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of both centrioles (Fig. 1A).
Cep57 colocalized with Cep63 with a similar diameter (426.7 ± 49.7 nm for Cep57, 441.0 ± 39.6
nm for Cep63; 26 centrioles from 13 cells), while Cep152 stained a slightly bigger ring (511.0 ±
36.2 nm, 26 centrioles from 13 cells) (Fig. 1A,B). Consistently, GFP-Cep57 also enriched at the
base of mother centrioles in U2OS cells. In addition to the centriolar localization, overexpression
of GFP-Cep57 resulted in microtubule (MT) bundling and both Cep63 and Cep152 were
recruited to the bundled MTs (Lin et al., 2013b; Momotani et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2016) (Fig.
1C,D), indicating that Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152 form a complex and Cep57 could recruit
Cep63 and Cep152 in vivo.
During multiciliation, mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) assemble hundreds of
centrioles through both mother centriole-dependent (MCD) and deuterosome-dependent (DD)
pathways respectively driven by Cep63 and its paralog, Deup1 (Lin et al., 2013a; Zhao et al.,
2019; Zhao et al., 2013). At the early stages of centriole amplification, Cep63 specifically
localizes at the proximal end of parental centrioles, but not at the deuterosomes, with the
association of Cep152. Interestingly, Cep57 behaved similarly as Cep63 during mTECs
differentiation (Fig. 1E,G). In stage I, Cep57 colocalized with Cep152 at the proximal end of two
parental centrioles. In stages II and III, Cep57 exclusively associated with the parental centrioles,

but not with the deuterosomes. In stage IV, Cep57 started to occupy the base of each procentriole
formed around the parental centrioles and deuterosomes, where Cep152 started to protrude
spoke-like structures. In stages V and VI, Cep57 still located at the proximal end of each nascent
centriole as a full ring structure whereas Cep152 and Cep63 further converted into a dot (Fig. 1E)
(Zhao et al., 2013). Consistent with the localization of endogenous Cep57, GFP-Cep57 exhibited
a similar localization pattern in mTECs (Fig. 1F,G).
The spatiotemporal distribution of Cep57 in mTECs indicates that Cep57, similar as Cep63,
only contributes to the MCD pathway and Cep57 together with Cep63 could recruit Cep152 for
the MCD centriole assembly.
Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152 interact hierarchically
To explore the relationship among Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152, we performed coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments (Figs. 2, S1). Cep57 localized to the
centriole via its C-terminal MT binding domain (Momotani et al., 2008) and interacted with
Cep63 through its N-terminal coiled-coil domain (Figs. 2A and S1A,B). Cep63 bound to Cep57
via its N-terminal centriole-binding region and its C-terminus interacted with the centrosomal
targeting region of Cep152 (152M) (Figs. 2B and S1C,D)(Hatch et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2013).
In the GST-pull down assay, GST-Cep57 directly interacted with His-Cep63, but could not pull
down Cep152M in the absence of Cep63 (Fig. 2C), indicating that Cep57 forms the complex
with Cep152 through Cep63 and these three proteins interact in a hierarchical manner (Fig. 2D).
These results indicate that Cep57 localizes to the proximal mother centriole through its Cterminus and recruits the Cep63-Cep152 cradle by directly binding to the centriolar targeting
region of Cep63.
Depletion of Cep57 does not affect the centriolar localization of Cep63 and Cep152

To test whether Cep57 is required for the centrosomal targeting of Cep63 and Cep152, we
generated Cep57 and Cep63 knockout (KO) U2OS cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 method
(Fig. S2)(Cong et al., 2013). Immunofluorescence analysis of Cep63 KO or Cep57 KO cell lines
revealed a complete loss of Cep63 or Cep57 ring-like signals at the proximal end of centrioles
(Fig. 2E-H). As reported previously (Lukinavicius et al., 2013; Sir et al., 2011), Cep152
centrosomal signal reduced dramatically in Cep63 KO cells compared to that in control cells (Fig.
2E).The centrosomal localization of Cep57 was not affected in Cep63 KO cells (Fig. 2F).
Surprisingly, both Cep63 and Cep152 were still able to localize at the centrosome in Cep57 KO
cells (Fig. 2G,H). These results are in accordance with the previous findings that Cep63 is
essential for Cep152 centrosomal localization, whereas Cep57 seems to be dispensable for
loading the Cep63-Cep152 cradle to the centrosome (Lukinavicius et al., 2013; Sir et al., 2011).
The dispensable role of Cep57 in the centriolar targeting of the Cep63-Cep152 complex is
contradictory to the fact that Cep57 forms a stable complex with Cep63 and Cep152 by directly
binding to the centriolar targeting region of Cep63. The paradox raises a possibility that other
proteins may function redundantly with Cep57 to recruit Cep63 and Cep152.
Cep57l1, the paralog of Cep57, forms a complex with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal
end of mother centrioles
We searched for the homologous protein of Cep57 by protein BLAST and we indeed found
out Cep57l1, the Cep57 paralog. Cep57l1 had similar function domains and shared
approximately 43% identities with Cep57 (Figs. 3A and S3). We first tested whether Cep57l1
also interacts with Cep63 as Cep57. We found that the N-terminus of Cep57l1 was necessary and
sufficient to bind Cep63 (Fig. 3B,C). Cep63 also interacted with Cep57l1 through its N-terminal
centrosomal targeting fragment (Fig. 3E,F).

Due to the lack of the Cep57l1 antibody, we examined the subcellular localization of
Cep57l1 by expressing GFP-Cep57l1 in U2OS cells. GFP-Cep57l1 also formed a ring-like
structure with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of centrioles in the interphase with a
comparable diameter to Cep57 (426.6± 34.2 nm, 40 centrioles from 24 cells) (Figs. 3H).
Interestingly, although Cep57l1 showed high similarity with Cep57, Cep57l1 could not bundle
microtubules (Fig. 3D,H). In addition, Cep57l1 was targeted to the centrioles through its Nterminal region (Fig. 3B,D), which was also different from Cep57 (Figs. 2A, S1A).
In multiciliated mTECs, GFP-Cep57l1 displayed similar subcellular distribution as Cep57
and Cep63 (Figs. 3I) (Lin et al., 2013a; Zhao et al., 2013). It also specifically associated with the
parental centrioles but not with deuterosomes at the early stages of centriole amplification in
mTECs (stages II and III). In stage IV, GFP-Cep57l1 started to accumulate at the base of
nascent centrioles to form a goblet like structure (Fig. 3I). Like Cep57, GFP-Cep57l1 still
localized at the proximal end of centrioles in a ring-like pattern in stages V and VI (Fig. 3I).
Collectively, these findings imply that Cep57l1 is the paralog of Cep57 and like Cep57, Cep57l1
interacts with Cep63 at the proximal end of centrioles.
Cep57 and its paralog Cep57l1 cooperate to recruit the Cep63-Cep152 complex for
centriole duplication
To examine whether Cep57l1 is required for the localization of Cep63 and Cep152, we
depleted Cep57l1 by RNAi in both wild type and Cep57 KO U2OS cells (Fig. 4). Given the lack
of Cep57l1 antibody, we selected Cep57l1 siRNA oligos by co-expression of GFP-Cep57l1 with
various siRNA oligos and two oligos, 57L1i-1 and 57L1i-2, were chosen based on knockdown
efficiency (Fig. S4).

As expected, like Cep57, depletion of Cep57l1 alone did not affect the centriolar
localization of either Cep63 or Cep152 in control U2OS cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, depletion of
Cep57l1 in Cep57 KO cells completely abolished the centriolar localization of Cep63 and
Cep152 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Cep57 and Cep57l1 act together to ensure the localization of
the Cep63-Cep152 complex. Furthermore, the localization of Cep63 and Cep152 could be
rescued by expressing either GFP-Cep57 or siRNA-resistant GFP-hCep57l1 (GFP-hCep57l1R),
but not GFP-Centrin1(GFP-Cetn1) (Fig. 4C).
To investigate whether procentriole assembly is impaired by co-depletion of both Cep57
and Cep57l1, we counted the number of assembled procentrioles marked by Sas-6 in S-phase
cells. Consistent with the function of Cep63 and Cep152, the procentriole assembly was severely
impaired upon the co-depletion of both Cep57 and Cep57l1 (Fig. 4D,E), demonstrating a critical
function of Cep57 and Cep57l1 in the initiation of centriole duplication.
In this study, we find that Cep57 and its paralog Cep57l1 form a complex and colocalize
with the Cep63-Cep152 cradle at the proximal end of mother centrioles. In multiciliated cells,
similar as Cep63, Cep57 and Cep57l1 only associate with the parental centrioles but not with the
deuterosomes at the early stages of centriole amplification, suggesting that Cep57, Cep57l1
together with Cep63 specifically function in the MCD pathway for recruiting Cep152. Codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57l1 disrupts the localization of the Cep63-Cep152 complex at the
mother centriole, sequentially blocks normal procentriole formation. Our results indicate that
Cep57 and Cep57l1 cooperate to recruit the Cep63-Cep152 complex at the proximal end of
mother centrioles for centriole biogenesis.

Recently, Cep295 is identified as the key protein for the conversion of daughter centrioles
into functional mother centrioles, and the loading of Cep152 by Cep135 and Cep295 to daughter
centrioles is critical for the conversion (Fu et al., 2016; Tsuchiya et al., 2016). Interestingly,
Cep295 is only required for targeting of Cep152 to the young mother centriole, but not to the old
mother centriole, implying that other scaffold proteins might play a role in anchoring Cep152 to
the old mother centriole. Our findings here raise a possibility that Cep63 recruited by
Cep57/Cep57l1 may function in detaining Cep152 at the mother centriole after its initial loading
by Cep135-Cep295 during the centriole-to-centrosome conversion. In the future, it will be
interesting to investigate the relationship among Cep57/Cep57l1, Cep63 and Cep295 in the
centriolar localization of Cep152.

Figure 1. Cep57 co-localizes with Cep63 and Cep152 at the proximal end of centrioles.
(A) Cep57 co-localized with Cep63 and Cep152. Cep57 (green) was co-stained with Cep63 (red)
and Cep152 (blue) in human U2OS cells.
(B) The line intensity plot showed the centriolar colocalization of Cep57, Cep63 and Cep152.
(C, D) Cep63 and Cep152 were recruited to the bundled microtubule by GFP-Cep57 in U2OS
cells. U2OS cells transfected with GFP-Cep57 for 48 hours were fixed and stained for Centrin
(Cetn, blue) and Cep63 (C, red) or Cep152 (D, red).
(E-G) Cep57 specified MCD cradles during centriole amplification in mTECs. mTECs (E) or
mTECs expressing GFP-Cep57 (F) were fixed at day 3 after inducing multiciliation with the airliquid interfere (ALI d3) and stained for Cep152 (red), Cetn (blue) and Cep57 (green) or GFP.
Cep152 serves as the marker of both the mother centriole and deuterosome, and Centrin as the
marker of centrioles. Representative 3D-SIM images in the indicated stages of centriole
amplification are presented. Magnified areas are used to show details for the MCD (right;
arrowheads) and DD (left; arrows) centriole amplification. Schematic illustration models (G) are
presented to aid understanding.

Representative 3D-SIM images were acquired from mTECs at ALI d 3. Schematic illustration
models are presented to aid understanding.
Figure 4. Cep57 and Cep57l1 recruit the Cep63-Cep152 cradle for centriole duplication.
(A) Cep57l1 knockdown did not affect the centrosomal localization of Cep63 and Cep152.
Human U2OS cells were transfected with a control siRNA or two Cep57l1 siRNA oligos
respectively.
(B) Double depletion of Cep57 and Cep57l1 abolished the centrosomal localization of Cep63
and Cep152. Cep57 knockout cells were transfected with a control siRNA (Ctrli) or two Cep57l1
siRNAs (57L1i-1 and 57L1i-2) respectively.
(C) Overexpression of both GFP-tagged Cep57 and RNAi-resistant hCep57l1 fully rescued the
centriolar loss of Cep63 upon the co-depletion of Cep57 and Cep57l1.For rescue experiments,
Cep57 KO U2OS cells were co-transfected with Cep57l1 siRNA oligos together with either
GFP-Cetn1, GFP-Cep57 or RNAi resistant GFP-hCep57l1 for 48 h and fixed for IF.
(D) Co-depletion of Cep57 and Cep57l1 blocked procentriole formation. Cep57 knockout cells
were transfected with control or Cep57l1 siRNA oligos and stained for Sas-6 and Cetn. EdU was
used to label S phase cells.
(E) Percentage of cells with the indicated Sas-6 dots (n=100 cells). The results were from three
independent experiments. Two tailed t-test was performed for p-values, error bars represent SD,
and asterisks for p-values are ** p<0.01 and *** p<0.001.
