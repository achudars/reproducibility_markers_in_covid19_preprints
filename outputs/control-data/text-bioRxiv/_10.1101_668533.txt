Abstract
Multiplexed quantitative analyses of complex proteomes enable deep biological insight. While a multitude of workflows have been
developed for multiplexed analyses, the most quantitatively accurate method (SPS-MS3) suffers from long acquisition duty cycles.
We built a new, real-time database search (RTS) platform, Orbiter, to combat the SPS-MS3 method’s longer duty cycles. RTS with
Orbiter enables the elimination of SPS-MS3 scans if no peptide matches to a given spectrum. With Orbiter’s online proteomic
analytical pipeline, which includes RTS and false discovery rate analysis, it was possible to process a single spectrum database search
in less than 10 milliseconds. The result is a fast, functional means to identify peptide spectral matches using Comet, filter these
matches, and more efficiently quantify proteins of interest. Importantly, the use of Comet for peptide spectral matching allowed for
a fully featured search, including analysis of post-translational modifications, with well-known and extensively validated scoring.
These data could then be used to trigger subsequent scans in an adaptive and flexible manner. In this work we tested the utility of
this adaptive data acquisition platform to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiplexed quantitative experiments. We found
that RTS enabled a 2-fold increase in mass spectrometric data acquisition efficiency. Orbiter’s RTS was able to quantify more than
8000 proteins across 10 proteomes in half the time of an SPS-MS3 analysis (18 hours for RTS, 36 hours for SPS-MS3).

Introduction
Multiplexed quantitative methods continually attempt to
balance acquisition speed and precursor isolation purity.
The balance derives from the need to achieve high
proteome coverage (speed, depth) to interrogate new
biologies and the need for quantitative accuracy to
eliminate spurious quantitative values (purity, accuracy)
to improve quantitative dynamic range. Initial
experiments with multiplexed isobaric reagents
implemented HRMS2-based methods for multiplexed
quantitation and relied on a single precursor isolation to
attempt to eliminate co-isolating ions1. While the
methods were relatively fast, the resulting quantitation
suffered from the well-documented phenomenon of
reporter ion interference due to co-isolation of
precursors2.
In an effort to eliminate the aforementioned quantitative
interference, methods that employed a tertiary scan to
analyze secondary fragmentation products, multinotch
MS3 or SPS-MS3, were developed2,3. The SPS-MS3
method vastly improved quantitative accuracy, but
required the addition of a third quantification scan to
every instrument scan cycle which subsequently slowed
instrument acquisition speeds3,4. While other methods
have been developed to reduce precursor co-isolation
interference and/or increase the duty cycle speed, these
1

methods generally still rely on either the HRMS2 method
or SPS-MS3 method5,6. Recently a proof-of-principle
showed real-time spectral matching as a novel means to
achieve the speed of HRMS2 analyses with the
quantitative accuracy of SPS-MS34. Real-time search (RTS)
had the potential to vastly improve acquisition efficiency
for multiplexed quantitative analysis by enabling
quantitation if and only if a peptide spectral match (PSM)
was found4. This intelligent acquisition strategy was based
around a binomial search score7,8. By applying this
strategy specifically to multiplexed analyses and through
selective elimination of SPS-MS3 this study demonstrated
a strong improvement in scan acquisition speed and
improved accuracy for multiplexed quantitation.
In the present work we extended the robustness and
flexibility of the RTS strategy for multiplexed quantitative
proteomics. We implemented a full analytical pipeline –
monoisotopic peak refinement, database searching, and
FDR filtering9 – on a millisecond time scale, termed
Orbiter. The speed of Orbiter analysis enabled real-time
decision making to dictate the acquisition of SPS-MS3
scans only when a PSM was observed. We chose the open
source Comet search engine for database searching and
scoring10,11. For this work, Comet was revised to enable
fast real-time spectral analysis while maintaining support
for highly flexible searching (e.g. post translation

modifications, multiple isotopic envelopes, and flexible
fragmentation schemes)10,12. We evaluated the improved
performance of Orbiter RTS against standard SPS-MS3.
Orbiter achieved 2-fold faster acquisition speeds and
improved quantitative accuracy compared to canonical
SPS-MS3 methods.
Experimental Methods
Tissue culture and sample preparation
Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisae, BY4742) were
grown in 500mL YPD cultures to an OD600 of 0.8 then
washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and stored at 80oC until use. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (8M
urea, 50mM EPPS pH 8.5, 150mM NaCl, Roche protease
inhibitor tablet) and lysed by bead beating. After lysis and
bead removal, the lysate was centrifuged to remove
cellular debris and the supernatant was collected for use.
Cell lines were grown to confluence in DMEM containing
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin/puromycin.
Cells were harvested by manual scraping and washed
twice with PBS. Cells were syringe lysed in lysis buffer (8M
urea, 50mM EPPS pH 8.5, 150mM NaCl, and Roche
protease inhibitor tablet) and the resulting lysates were
cleared via centrifugation.
Desired protein amounts were aliquoted and chloroform
methanol precipitated, followed by digestion with LysC
(overnight at room temperature, vortex speed 2; Wako)
and trypsin (6 hours, 37oC; Promega) digestion. Peptides
were labeled with TMT reagents as previously
described6,13. Labeled peptides were mixed, and dried to
remove organic solvent prior to clean-up via Sep-Pak
(50mg C18 SepPak; Waters). As needed, labeled peptide
mixtures were separated via high-pH reversed phase
chromatography and pooled into 12 fractions13. Samples
were dried and stored at -80oC prior to analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis
Samples were resuspended in 5% acetonitrile/2% formic
acid prior to being loaded onto an in-house pulled C18
(Thermo Accucore, 2.6A, 150um) 35cm column. Peptides
were eluted over a 90, 120, or 180 minute gradient from
96% buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.125% formic acid) to 30%
buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.125% formic acid). Sample
eluate was electrosprayed (2600V) into a Thermo
Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer for
analysis. The scan procedure for MS1 scans (Orbitrap scan
at 120,000 resolution, 50ms max injection time, and AGC
set to 1e5) and MS2 scans (Rapid ion scan, 50ms max
injection time, AGC set to 2e4, CID collision energy of 35%
with 10ms activation time, and 0.5 m/z isolation width)
was constant for all analyses.

Database search and analysis
Raw files were converted to mzXML format using an inhouse adapted version of RawFileReader6 and searched
using SEQUEST or Comet11,14. Briefly, spectra were
searched against a target-decoy database for the yeast,
human, or concatenated human-yeast proteomes,
including isoforms6. Searches were performed with a 20
ppm peptide mass tolerance, 0.9 Da fragment ion
tolerance, trypsin enzymatic cleavage with up to 2 missed
cleavages, and three variable modifications allowed per
peptide. Unless otherwise noted, all searches were
performed with variable methionine oxidation
(+15.9949146221), static cysteine carboxyamidomethylation (+57.02146) and static tandem mass tag
modifications on lysine and the peptide N-termini
(+229.16293). Peptide spectral matches were filtered to a
peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR) of less than
1%15. Statistical analyses and plotting was done using the
R project for statistical computing16.
Adaptive instrument control
The adaptive instrument control platform (Orbiter) was
built in the .NET Framework (v4.6.5). Peptide spectral
matches were determined using a version of the Comet
search algorithm specifically designed for improved
spectral acquisition speed enabling searching full targetdecoy databases. These improvements have been made
available in the latest release of Comet10,11. Single
spectrum searching via this modified revision of Comet
retains the full complement of search features available
to Comet (e.g. static/variable modifications, indexed
databases) enabling highly customizable searches. The
real-time search (RTS) Comet functionality has been
released and is available here: http://cometms.sourceforge.net/. Real-time access to spectral data
was enabled by the Thermo Scientific Fusion API
(https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/iapi). The core
search functionalities demonstrated here have been
incorporated into the latest version of the Thermo
Scientific instrument control software (Tune 3.3).
Real-time monoisotopic peak correction
Monoisotopic peaks were corrected in real-time to attain
highly accurate monoisotopic m/z values for each
precursor via modeling averagine across a given
precursor. Briefly, potential monoisotopic envelope peaks
are extracted using an averagine mass offset17. Peaks are
then compared using Pearson correlation against a
theoretical distribution calculated from the estimated
number of carbons and the natural abundance of 13C. The
mass with the best correlation is used as the
monoisotopic m/z17.

Real-time false discovery rate estimation
To improve scoring for a potentially diverse cohort of
samples, real-time false discovery rate (rtFDR) filtering
was implemented using a modified linear discriminant
analysis15 adapted from the Accord.Net Statistical
libraries18. Seven parameters were used for rtFDR
estimation: XCorr, deltaCorr, missed cleavages, charge
state, absolute ppm error, peptide length, and the
fraction of ions matched15. After requiring a minimum set
of observed reverse hits, discriminant scores were used to
sort and filter PSMs to a user-defined rtFDR19. Continuous
real-time peptide spectral matching also enabled on-thefly instrument ppm error estimation and correction.
Results and Discussion
During mass spectrometric analyses, stochastic precursor
selection and fragmentation results in large numbers of
non-peptide matching spectra4. In standard SPS-MS3
methods, these non-matching spectra generate wasteful
MS3 scans. We reasoned that elimination of these
extraneous SPS-MS3 scans would enhance SPS-MS3
acquisition speed while maintaining quantitative
accuracy3,20. Therefore, performing RTS prior to SPS-MS3
acquisition and only triggering SPS-MS3 scans when a
PSM was observed could significantly reduce the number
of spurious SPS-MS3 scans generated4. This process would
free instrument time to acquire more peptide matching
MS2 scans to increase proteome coverage which would in
turn trigger useful SPS-MS3 scans. We built the Orbiter
platform to perform this RTS decision making. Orbiter
encompassed a full featured analytical proteomics
pipeline operating fast enough to seamlessly integrate
concurrently with instrument scan acquisition and inform
future scan decisions (i.e. when to trigger SPS-MS3).
The Orbiter platform was built in C# (.NET 4.6.5+) to
perform spectral pre-processing, RTS using the Comet
search engine, SPS ion selection, and real-time false
discovery rate filtering within milliseconds of the MS2
scan acquisition (Figure 1). Three central components
enabled fast, adaptive database searching. First, the
processing of precursor MS1 scans prior to database
searching facilitated monoisotopic precursor mass
assignment and correction on the fly. Second, a newly
developed revision of the Comet database searching
algorithm enabled rapid single spectrum searching. Third,
real-time false discovery rate (FDR) filtering was built
using linear discriminant analysis to filter PSMs using userdefined FDR settings.

Figure 1. Architecture of the Orbiter platform. DDA MS2 scans are
searched by Orbiter's real-time database search. Peptide spectral
matches are identified using Comet and filtered using a real-time FDR
filter. For multiplexed analyses, SPS ions based on b- and y-ions from
the identified peptide sequence. If and only if a peptide spectral match
passes all assigned filters, will Orbiter trigger a new SPS-MS3 scan.

To run an RTS analytical method, a user queues a
canonical DDA MS2 acquisition method (MS1 precursors
trigger MS2 fragmentation scans for ion trap or Orbitrap
analysis) based on user specified filters (e.g. dynamic
exclusion, intensity thresholds). Running on the
instrument computer, Orbiter listens for the beginning of
each new method. When a new method begins, Orbiter
then listens for the scan description of the first three new
MS1 scans. If the consensus scan description matches to a
previously established Orbiter method, Orbiter will begin
searching with the pre-established database and
parameters. Otherwise, users can override Orbiter
methods by inputting a specific indexed database and
parameters. Instrument listening and control was
accomplished using Thermo Scientific’s Tribrid instrument
application programming interface (iAPI).
Refinement of monoisotopic peak detection has
previously been shown to improve peptide identification
rates17,21,22. To ensure fidelity to the actual monoisotopic
peak mass (often corrected offline) and to offline search
workflows, we developed a fast monoisotopic peak
algorithm to correct instrument assignments based on an

averaged precursor monoisotopic mass17. Here, Orbiter
collects the centroids for every MS1 scan in real-time and
generates a library of all potential precursors that may be
targeted for fragmentation by the instrument. Peaks that
could potentially be part of the isotopic envelope were
extracted using the averagine mass offset17. Peaks were
then compared using Pearson correlation against a
theoretical distribution calculated from the estimated
number of carbons and the natural abundance of 13C. The
resulting peak with the highest correlation was assigned
as the monoisotopic peak. Finally, the monoisotopic peak
detection averages the monoisotopic mass for the
triggering precursor across the preceding n MS1 scans.
This procedure enables accurate monoisotopic peak
detection for use in subsequent searching of potential
peptide fragments.
Comet was chosen as the database searching algorithm as
it was built under an open source framework with active
revisions and maintenance, allowing for rapid prototyping
and adaptation to the challenges of real-time search10,11.
Additionally, Comet has an extensive suite of multiapplication search features10, including well documented
and validated search and scoring functions – for example
XCorr and deltaCorr10,11. The primary challenge for
integrating Comet into an RTS engine was to streamline
the scoring functions and optimize memory allocation to
ensure Comet searching could be run efficiently10. We
accomplished this by deploying new finalizers to rapidly
expunge unmanaged memory resources. This enabled RTS
to run stably over extended periods of time (weeks to
months).
In addition, the RTS revision of Comet was adapted to
remove post-search E-value calculations11. The E-value
calculation made up greater than 80% (e.g. 125ms of a
total of 156ms) of the Comet processing time. Thus, by
eliminating these calculations, search speeds increased 5fold, but required a new FDR metric (see below). With
these changes, Orbiter was able to rapidly search each
new MS2 spectra against an entire organismal database in
milliseconds with high fidelity to the Comet run offline
(Figure 2a). When comparing to offline searching using
Thermo’s high throughput SEQUEST, we observed highly
correlated scores similar to previous comparisons of the
two search engines (Figure 2A)10,14.

(precursor mass -1/+0/+1) and methionine oxidation as a
variable modification and reversed decoy proteins
resulted in median search times of 5ms. We next tested
Orbiter search times for the significantly more complex
full human database with common isoforms (42113
protein entries, Uniprot). When searched with the same
parameters as the yeast database, this test resulted in
median search times of only 17ms. As noted in the above
searches, the RTS revision of Comet (SourceForge revision
r1296) retains the flexible database searching available
offline allowing the use of user-defined variable
modifications, including common post-translational
modifications such as methionine oxidation and
phosphorylation (Figure 2b). Indeed, we observed median
search times for even a full human database considering
variable modifications of both methionine oxidation and
serine, threonine, tyrosine phosphorylation fell well under
the default injection time for 50,000 resolution SPS-MS3
scans (86ms).
In lieu of the E-value calculation (removed to improve
search speeds), Orbiter performs a multi-feature linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) to distinguish high quality
PSMs from low quality PSMs (Figure 3)9,25. Orbiter’s LDA
uses seven score parameters derived from the output of
Comet’s database search: XCorr, deltaCorr, missed
cleavages, charge state, absolute ppm error, peptide
length, and the fraction of ions matched15. The LDA
resulted in a final discriminant score that efficiently
separated target from decoy PSMs (Figure 3A). Of note, as
Orbiter generated a library of PSMs for every run, it was
also possible to track and adjust the ppm error on the fly.
Thereby Orbiter can actively adapt to the current
performance of the instrument (e.g. temperature changes
causing Orbitrap mass accuracy to drift). The adjusted
precursor mass error measurement also provided a realtime quality control metric to assess aberrant instrument
behavior.
The training data for Orbiter’s LDA was derived from all
previous PSMs observed within the single run with and
XCorr greater than 1. Therefore, to ensure that this LDA
was not biased compared to offline discriminant analysis
which used all PSMs from a run for training, we compared
online versus offline LDA on the same run (Figure 3B).
While the reduced training set did have an effect on the
LDA coefficients, this result was minor as noted by the
highly correlated LDA coefficients (Figure 3B). Moreover,

5

the resulting discriminant scores across all PSMs were
highly similar. When enabled, the PSMs that passed the
user-defined FDR filter and did not originate from decoy
peptides trigger SPS-MS3 scans. Filtering of low
confidence and decoy peptides greatly reduces the
number of SPS-MS3 scans triggered. The FDR filter can in
turn be combined with protein inclusion and exclusion
filters to enable Orbiter to target specific subproteomes,
e.g. kinases4.

Figure 3. Real-time False Discovery Rate filtering. A, Real-time peptide
spectral match features (e.g. XCorr, deltaCorr) were used to
discriminate target and decoy peptides on-the-fly. B, Online and offline
LDA scoring resulted in similar numbers of passing peptide spectral
matches. Inset: the resulting LDA coefficients from offline and online
analysis were highly correlated.

By eliminating SPS-MS3 scans downstream of MS2 scans
that matched to low scoring or decoy peptides, Orbiter
should improve instrument acquisition efficiency for
multiplexed analyses. To assess this, we generated
samples from a panel of cell lines of multiple tissues of
origin (i.e. mammary gland, colon, embryonic kidney).
Biological replicates for each of three cell lines (HEK293T,
HCT116, and MCF7) were labeled with TMT reagents and
mixed in equal proportion (Figure 4A). The cell line panel
was then processed as described previously and pooled

into 12 high-pH reversed phase fractions13. Each of these
fractions was analyzed either with a SPS-MS3 method
running 180-minute gradients, or Orbiter methods
running shortened 90 minute gradients (Figure 4B). Thus,
we tested if Orbiter could reach the same quantitative
accuracy and proteome coverage of SPS-MS3 in half the
gradient time. After offline filtering to a peptide and
protein FDR less than 1%, the SPS-MS3 method quantified
8455 proteins in 36 hours. In just 18 hours, the Orbiter
RTS method quantified 8166 (97% of the SPS-MS3
method). These data emphasized a near doubling of the
instrument acquisition speed from 234 proteins
quantified per hour with SPS-MS3 to 454 proteins
quantified per hour with Orbiter RTS. The resulting ratios

6

between SPS-MS3 and Orbiter quantitation were highly
correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.946, Figure 4C).
Although the ratios were highly correlated, we observed a
skew with Orbiter ratios having, in general, greater
absolute values (Figure 4C). We built Orbiter’s RTS to
select MS3 precursors only from b-ions for arginine
terminated peptides or b- and y-ions for lysine terminated
peptides (Figure 4D). In contrast, standard SPS-MS3
precursors were selected based on the top-n most intense
ions in the preceding MS2 scan. Standard SPS-MS3 ions,
therefore, may not originate from the matched peptide3.
To estimate the extent of the improved RTS accuracy we
compared quadrants I and III of the ratio scatter plot to
determine if the Orbiter quantification was enriched for
larger relative ratios compared to SPS-MS3 with a null

hypothesis that an equal number of ratios were greater
using Orbiter compared to SPS-MS3 and vice versa.
Strikingly, by Fisher’s Exact test we observed a significant
enrichment of greater dynamic range measurements
using Orbiter (Figure 4E). We highlight two examples of
this for the proteins Endoglin (CD105) and ALPK2 (Figure
4F). In each case, Orbiter greatly reduced the quantitative
isobaric interference revealing large, cell line specific
ratios (Figure 4E).
The Orbiter platform was built as a flexible RTS pipeline
that enables rapid deployment of new search-based

7

methods. While the initial use case has targeted
improving accuracy and acquisition efficiency in for
multiplex-based SPS-MS3 scans, the RTS via Comet could
rapidly be extended to diverse applications, such as
selection of fragmentation schemes for complex sample
types (e.g. ETD or HCD for glycan analysis) based on
identifying a specific peptide/post-translational
modification or real-time filtering for crosslinking
analysis. Accordingly, the core search functionality
developed here has been implemented as a new feature
for the latest generation of Thermo Tribrid instruments.
