ABSTRACT
Sequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these
viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses, so-called ’quasispecies’. Standard (short-read)
sequencing technologies are ill-suited to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes
and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions. Here, we used a full-length,
direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach based on nanopores to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected
with a human coronavirus.
Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (∼26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By
combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, we reconstructed a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human
coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb). Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step,
we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized.
Also, the DRS approach, which circumvents reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect
methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by
demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation.
Even though several technical challenges remain to be addressed to exploit the potential of the nanopore technology
fully, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus
populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.
Key words: direct RNA sequencing, Coronavirus, nanopore, haplotype, subgenomic

Background
Coronaviruses (subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped positive-sense
(+) single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that infect a variety
of mammalian and avian hosts and are of significant
medical and economic importance, as illustrated by recent zoonotic transmissions from diverse animal hosts to
humans 1,2 . The genome sizes of coronaviruses (∼30 kb)
exceed those of most other RNA viruses. Coronaviruses
use a special mechanism called discountinuous extension of minus strands 3,4 to produce a nested set of 5’and 3’-coterminal subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that carry a
common 5’ leader sequence that is identical to the 5’
end of the viral genome 5,6 . These sg mRNAs contain
a different number of open reading frames (ORFs)
that encode the viral structural proteins and several

accessory proteins. With very few exceptions, only the
5’-located ORF (which is absent from the next smaller sg
mRNA) is translated into protein (Fig. 1).
In HCoV-229E-infected cells, at total of 7 major viral
RNAs are produced. The viral genome (RNA 1) is
occasionally referred to as mRNA 1 because it (also)
has an mRNA function. In its 5’-terminal region, the
genome RNA contains two large ORFs, 1a and 1b,
that encode the viral replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab.
mRNAs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used to produce the S
protein, accessory protein 4, E protein, M protein and
N protein, respectively. The 5’-ORF present in RNA 3
starts contains the central and 3’ regions of the S gene.
Although this sg RNA has been consistently identified in
HCoV-229E-infected cells, its mRNA function has been
disputed and there is currently no evidence that this RNA
is translated into protein 7–9 .

Figure 1: Scheme of genomic and subgenomic (sg) RNAs
produced in HCoV-229E-infected cells 7,8 . Translation of the
5’-terminal ORF(s) of the respective RNA gives rise to the
various viral structural and nonstructural proteins (indicated by
different colors). RNA 3 is considered defective and unlikely
to be translated into protein. Each RNA has a 3’ poly(A) tail
and carries a 5’-leader sequence that is identical to the 5’-end
of the genome. In a process called discontinuous extension of
negative strands, negative-strand RNA synthesis is attenuated
at specific genomic positions. After transfer of the nascent
strand to an upstream position on the template, RNA synthesis
is continued by copying the 5’-leader sequence. As a result,
the 3’-ends of coronavirus minus-strand RNAs are equipped
with the complement of the 5’-leader. The latter process is
guided by base-pairing interactions between the transcriptionregulating sequence (TRS) located immediately downstream of
the leader sequence (TRS-L) at the 5’-end of the genome and
the sequence complement of a TRS located upstream of one of
the ORFs present in the 3’-proximal genome region (TRS-B).

Like many other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses show high
rates of recombination 10–12 . In fact, the mechanism
to produce 5’ leader-containing sg mRNAs represents
a prime example for copy-choice RNA recombination
that, in this particular case, is guided by complex RNARNA interactions involving the transcription-regulating
sequence (TRS) core sequences and likely requires
additional interactions of viral proteins with specific RNA
signals. In other virus systems, RNA recombination
has been shown to generate ’transcriptional units’ that
control the expression of individual components of the
genome 13 . The mechanisms involved in viral RNA
recombination are diverse and may even extend to nonreplicating systems 14 . In the vast majority of cases,
recombination results in defective RNA (dRNA) copies
that lack essential cis-active elements and thus cannot
be replicated. In other cases, functional recombinant
RNA with new properties, such as the ability to replicate
in a new host, may emerge 15–18 . In yet other cases,
defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) may be produced.
These defective (subgenome-length) RNAs contain all
the cis-acting elements required for efficient replication
by a helper virus polymerase and, therefore, represent
parasitic RNAs that compete for components of the viral
replication/transcription complex with non-defective viral
RNAs 19 .
To elucidate the many facets of recombination and to
determine full-length haplotypes of, for example, virus
mutants/variants in complex viral populations (quasispecies), long-read sequencing has become the method
of choice. Short-read second-generation sequencing

technologies – such as IonTorrent and Illumina – are
restricted by read length (200-400 nucleotides 20 ). For
example, the use of highly fragmented viral RNAs
considerably complicates the investigation of haplotypes 21,22 . Since the nested coronavirus mRNAs are
almost identical to the original genome sequence, shortread data can usually not be unambiguously assigned to
specific sg RNA species.
In this study, we performed direct RNA sequencing
(DRS) on an array of nanopores, as developed by
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) 23 . Nanopore
sequencing does not have a limited reading length but is
limited only by fragmentation of the input material 24–26 .
Further, by using DRS, we avoid several drawbacks
of previous sequencing methods, in particular cDNA
synthesis and amplification of the input material. Thus,
for example, cDNA synthesis can create artificial RNARNA chimerae 27 that are difficult to discriminate from
naturally occurring chimerae (such as spliced RNAs).
Also, amplification prior to sequencing would remove
all RNA modifications from the input material, whereas
the nanopore sequencing technology preserves these
modifications 23,28 .
Recently, nanopore sequencing has been used for
metagenomic forays into the virosphere 29 and studies
focusing on transmission routes 30,31 . Furthermore, viral
transcriptomes have been investigated using nanopore
sequencing of cDNA 32–35 , being subject to bias from
reverse transcription and amplification. Other studies
used DRS to study the human poly(A) transcriptome 36
and the transcriptome of DNA viruses such as HSV 37 .
Furthermore, the genome of Influenza A virus has been
completely sequenced in its original form using direct
RNA sequencing 38 .
In the present study, we sequenced one of the largest
known RNA genomes, that of HCoV-229E, a member
of the genus Alphacoronavirus, with a genome size
of about 27,300 nt, in order to assess the complex
architectural details for viral sg RNAs produced in cells
infected with recombinant HCoV-229E. Using DRS, we
aim to capture complete viral mRNAs, including the
full coronavirus genome, in single contiguous reads.
Sequence analysis of thousands of full-length sg RNAs
will allow us to determine the architectures (including
leader-body junction sites) of the major viral mRNAs.
In addition, this approach provides insight into the
diversity of additional HCoV-229E sg RNAs, probably
including DI-RNAs. Further, we aim to assess whether
RNA modifications can be called directly from the raw
nanopore signal of viral molecules without prior in vitro
treatment, as has been shown for DNA 39,40 .

man coronaviruses: wild-type (WT) HCoV-229E, HCoV229E_SL2-SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV, respectively.
In the latter two viruses, a conserved
stem-loop structure (SL2) residing in the HCoV-229E
5’-UTR was replaced with the equivalent SL2 element
from SARS-CoV and BCoV, respectively 41 . Total RNA
samples obtained for the latter two (chimeric) viruses
were pooled prior to sequence analysis. Hereafter,
we refer to the first sample as WT RNA and to the
second (pooled) sample as SL2 RNA (see Methods and
Materials).
We performed two direct RNA sequencing runs (one per
sample) on a MinION nanopore sequencer. As shown
in Table 1, we achieved a throughput of 0.237 and 0.282
gigabases with 225 k and 181k reads for the WT and SL2
sample, respectively. See Supplemental Fig. 1 A for an
overview of the read length distribution. For the WT and
SL2 samples, 33.2 % and 35.9 % of the reads mapped
to the reference HCoV-229E sequences, respectively.
15.8 % and 10.2 % respectively mapped to the yeast
enolase 2 mRNA sequence, a calibration strand added
during the library preparation, while 47.4 % and 52.7 %
could be attributed to human host cell RNA. minimap2
did not align the remaining 3.50 % and 1.11 % of reads.
Using BLAST 42 against the nt database, 18.1 % and
20.7 % of these reads can be attributed again to HCoV,
human or yeast. As reads which were not aligned by
minimap2 were mostly very short (median <= 200 nt),
of poor basecalling quality and represented only 0.62 %
and 0.15 % of total nucleotides respectively, we decided
to only use the higher quality reads that minimap2 could
align. (see Supplemental Fig. 2 for detailed statistics).
The visualized raw voltage signal of a nanopore read is
commonly called ’squiggle’ (see Supplemental Fig. 3).
Different from all previous sequencing technologies,
nanopore sequencing preserves the information about
base modifications in the raw signal 23 . However, one
of the biggest challenges is the accurate mapping of the
raw voltage signal to bases (’base calling’).
As expected for nanopore DRS 23,38 , reads had a median
uncorrected error rate of about 15 % for human and
virus reads, while basecalling errors were reduced for
yeast ENO2 mRNA reads, as the basecaller was trained
on this calibration strand (see Table 1). This included
gaps but omitted dis-continuous sites longer than six
nucleotides since they indicated recombination. Half
of all errors were deletions. In addition, we found
that more than half of all single nucleotide deletions
occur in homopolymers, and most of these streches that
coincide with a deletion are three or more nucleotides
long (see Supplemental Fig. 4). A quarter of the errors
were substitutions, which we argue are largely due to
modified bases that impede the basecaller’s ability to
assign bases correctly.
The HCoV-229E genome was 99.86 % covered, with a
large coverage bias towards both ends (see Fig. 1 and
2). The high coverage of the 3’-end reflects the higher
abundance of mRNAs produced from the 3’-terminal

August 14, 2019

Nanopore long and direct RNA-Seq of coronaviruses
genome regions and is a result of the discontinuous
transcription mechanism employed by coronaviruses and
several other nidoviruses 5,43,44 . The 3’-coverage is
further increased by the directional sequencing that
starts from the mRNA 3’-terminal poly(A) tail. Also,
the observed coverage bias for the very 5’-end results
from the coronavirus-specific transcription mechanism
because all viral mRNAs are equipped with the 65-nt 5’leader sequence derived from the 5’-end of the genome.
The remainder of the high 5’-coverage bias likely reflects
the presence of high numbers of DI-RNAs in which
5’- and 3’-proximal genomic sequences were fused,
probably resulting from illegitimate recombination events
as shown previously for other coronaviruses 10,12,45 . For
the WT and SL2 samples, 38.37 % and 16.32 % were
split-mapped, respectively. Of these, only 278 and 181
had multiple splits. The considerably larger fraction of
split reads in the WT sample is explained by the high
abundance of potential DI-RNA molecules, see Fig. 2 (c).
An alignment of the longest reads from both samples to
the HCoV-229E reference indicates that they represent
near complete virus genomes (Supplemental Fig. 1 B).
The observed peaks in the aligned reads length distribution (see Fig. 4) corresponded very well with the
abundances of the known mRNAs produced in HCoV229E-infected cells 7–9 (see Fig. 1). Alignment of the
reads to these canonical mRNA sequences confirmed
these observed abundances (Supplemental Fig. 5).
The median read length for the combined set of reads
from both samples was 826 nt, with a maximum of
26,210 nt, covering 99.86 % of the 27,276-nt-long virus
genome, missing only 21 nt at the 5’-end, 15 nt at the
3’-end and those nucleotides that correspond to the
skewed error distribution, with 5.7 percentage points
more deletions than insertions (see Tab. 1).
The
median read length might sound short, however most
of the viral RNAs (including many DI-RNAs) identified
in HCoV-229E-infected cells were below 2,000 nt in
length. Furthermore, this number nearly doubles the
longest read length that can be obtained with shortread sequencing methods. We observed an abundance
of very short reads, representing the 3’ (poly-(A)) end
of the genome. This could be an artifact of RNA
degradation, although we cannot estimate the exact
fraction of affected transcripts. Because sequencing
starts at the poly-(A) tail, fragmented RNA will not be
sequenced beyond any 3’ break point. It is thus best
to minimize handling time during RNA extraction and
library preparation. Innovations in these fields will directly
translate into larger median read lengths.
We obtained 99.15 % and 98.79 % identity in both
samples (WT, SL2) respectively with the help of the
consensus caller Ococo 46 using the reference genomes
and all reads mapping to it. We attempted a standard
long-read assembly using Canu 47 , which yielded unusable results (WT: 389 contigs, longest 13 kb, all other
<4 kb; SL2: 517 contigs, all <6 kb). We think that
current nanopore-only assembly tools are not equipped

and S. cerevisiae enolase 2 (ENO2) mRNA (which was used as a calibration standard added during library preparation). Half of
the sequencing errors were deletion errors, probably resulting to a large extent from basecalling at homopolymer stretches. The
S. cerevisiae enolase 2 mRNA reads display an overall reduced error rate because the Albacore basecaller was trained on this
calibration strand. Note that all error rates report differences to the reference genome and thus include actual genetic variation.

canonical sg RNAs gives rise to the sharp coverage peak at the 5’-end. (c) We also observed unexpected ’steps’, especially in the
WT sample (blue). We hypothesize that the sequences correspond to DI-RNA molecules that may arise by recombination at TRSlike sequence motifs as well as other sites displaying sequence similarities that are sufficient to support illegitimate recombination
events (see Fig. 3). We attribute the difference in the observed (non-canonical) recombination sites between the two samples to
biological factors that we either did not control for or do not know (see also legend to Fig. 3).

to handle special read data sets such as those originating from a small RNA virus genome. In addition, we
assembled WT and SL2 consensus sequences using
Nanopore and Illumina data with HG-CoLoR 48 in an
approach that uses long nanopore reads to traverse an
assembly graph constructed from short Illumina reads.
We thereby recovered 99.57 % of the reference genome
in a single contiguous sequence at 99.90 % sequence
identity to reference using this approach with the single
longest read from the SL2 sample. This hybrid approach
illustrates how short- and long-read technologies can
be combined to reconstruct long transcripts accurately,
which will greatly facilitate studies of haplotypes.
Uncharacterized subgenomic and defective interfering RNAs
In addition to the leader-to-body junctions expected for
the canonical sg mRNAs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, we observed
a high number of recombination sites (Fig. 3) which were
consistently found in our samples but have not been
described previously (Fig. 3). In this study, we defined
a recombination site as any site that flanks more than
100 consecutive gaps, as determined in a discontinuous
mapping (’spliced’ mapping). While there is currently no
consensus on how to define such sites, we believe this
to be a conservative definition, as this type of pattern is
unlikely to result from e.g. miscalled homopolymer runs
which, in our experience, typically affect less than 10
consecutive bases. We observe all known canonical
HCoV-229E mRNAs at their expected lengths, including
the (presumably) non-coding mRNA 3 (Fig. 4).
The aligned reads distribution revealed clusters for all
known mRNAs which closely fit the expected molecule
lengths (Fig. 4). The cluster positions show double peaks
with a consistent distance of ∼65 nt, i.e. the length of
the leader sequence. We observed that the 5’-end of
reads has larger-than-average error rates and is often
missing nucleotides (see Supplemental Fig. 8 for detailed
statistics). This might be due to a bias of the basecaller
towards the end of reads. This is plausible, because the
underlying classification algorithm is a bidirectional (i.e.
forward and backward looking) long-short-term memory
neural network (LSTM). The mapping algorithm was
often unable to align these erroneous 5’-ends, leading to
soft-clipped bases. Thus, for many reads representing
canonical mRNAs, the included leader sequence was
not aligned, which gives rise to the secondary peak
at each cluster position. We also observed additional
clusters which likely correspond to highly abundant
dRNAs (Fig. 4).
We also observed several unexpected recombination
sites, e.g. at positions 3,000 to 4,000 (within ORF1a,
see Fig. 3). These sites were confirmed by both
nanopore and Illumina sequencing. They had a high read
support and defined margins, suggesting a specific synthesis/amplification of these sg RNAs which, most likely,
represent DI-RNAs. Since DI-RNAs are byproducts of

August 14, 2019

Nanopore long and direct RNA-Seq of coronaviruses
viral replication and transcription, they present a larger
diversity than the canonical viral mRNAs 49–53 .
Nanopore sequencing captures recombination events far
better than Illumina, which allowed us to identify even
complex sg RNAs (composed of sequences derived from
more than 2 non-contiguous genome regions) at much
higher resolution: For example, we found sg RNAs with
up to four recombination sites in the 5’- and 3’-terminal
genome regions (Fig. 3).
Consistent 5mC methylation signatures of coronavirus RNA
Nanopore sequencing preserves information on nucleotide modifications. Using a trained model, DNA and
RNA modifications such as 5mC methylation could be
identified (Fig. 5). To assess the false positive rate (FPR)
of the methylation calling, we used an unmethylated RNA
calibration standard (RCS) as a negative control which
was added in the standard library preparation protocol
for DRS. We considered a position to be methylated if
at least 90 % of the reads showed a methylation signal
for this particular position. Using this threshold, the
estimated FPR was calculated to be below 5 %. Our
experimental setup did not include a positive methylation
control.
When analyzing 5mC methylation across various RNAs,
we observed consistent patterns (Figure 5) that were
reproducible for the corresponding genomic positions
in different RNAs, suggesting that the methylation of
coronavirus RNAs is sequence-specific and/or controlled
by RNA structural elements. Methylated nucleotides
could be identified across the genome, both in the leader
sequence and in the body regions of viral mRNAs.
While the overall methylation pattern looks similar between subgenomic RNAs and the negative control (see
Supplemental Fig. 9), we nevertheless find consistent
methylation across different subgenomic RNA "types",
i.e. methylated positions of mRNA 2 are mirrored in
mRNA 4 etc.

Discussion
We identified highly diverse sg RNAs in coronavirusinfected cells, with many sg RNAs not corresponding
to the known canonical mRNAs. These ’non-canonical’
sg RNAs had abundant read support and full-length
sequences could be obtained for most of these RNAs.
As indicated above, only 12 % of the sg RNAs were found
to conform to our current understanding of discontinuous mRNA transcription in coronaviruses, resulting in
mRNAs that (all) carry an identical 5’-leader sequence
that is fused to the 3’-coding (’body’) sequence of
the respective mRNA. We however believe that 12 %
represents an underestimate because a large number
of sg RNAs were probably omitted from the analysis:
(1) RNA molecules degrade rapidly under laboratory

HCoV−229E

Figure 3: Joining of non-contiguous genome sequences in sg RNAs identified in HCoV-229E-infected cells. On the circular
axis the annotations of the reference genome (including 5’-UTR (5U) and 3’-UTR (3U)) are shown. Genomic positions of
’discontinuous sites’ identified in Illumina reads (A, outer track), nanopore reads of sample HCoV-229E WT (B, middle track) and
nanopore reads of SL2 sample (C, inner track) reveal multiple recombination sites across the whole genome. An aggregation
of recombination sites can be observed in the region that encodes the viral N protein. Furthermore, clear recombination sites
can be seen at intergenic boundaries and at the 5’- and 3’-UTRs, with the former corresponding to the boundary between the
leader sequence and the rest of the genome. Another prominent cluster can be observed in ORF1a in the WT nanopore sample,
but not in SL2. This cluster is supported by the WT Illumina data, excluding sequencing bias as a potential source of error. We
hypothesize that since samples WT and SL2 were obtained from non-plaque-purified serially passaged virus populations derived
from in vitro-transcribed genome RNAs transfected into Huh-7 cells, differences in the proportion of full-length transcripts versus
abortive transcripts could translate into different patterns of recombination. Generally, nanopore-based sequencing allows more
detailed analysis of recombination events due to the long read length. Even complex isoforms such as two exemplary reads, each
with four discontinuous segments, can be observed (blue and pink).

Figure 4: Distribution of aligned read lengths up to 8,000 nt for both samples based on alignments with minimap2. We observed
clusters that correspond well with the transcript lengths expected for canonical mRNAs (vertical dotted lines). Alignment of the
reads to these canonical mRNA sequences confirmed these observed abundances (Supplemental Fig. 5). The distribution shows
double peaks at the cluster positions because reads corresponding to mRNAs often miss the leader sequence, possibly due
to basecalling or mapping errors. We also observed additional clusters that likely correspond to highly abundant DI-RNAs. (a)
indicates a cluster in the WT sample that respresents chimeric ∼820-nt sg RNAs comprised of both 5’- and 3’-terminal genome
regions (∼540 nt and ∼280 nt, respectively). We propose the template switch for this transcript occurs around position 27,000 and
RNA synthesis resumes at around position 540 (see corresponding peaks in Fig. 3 track B). (b) indicates a cluster from the SL2
sample that contains transcripts with an approximate length of 5,150 nt which represents mRNA 3 (see Fig. 1). These transcripts
are probably formed due to a transcription stop at a TRS motif around position 22,150 (see corresponding peak in Fig. 3 track C).

conditions, even when handled carefully. The resulting
fragments will only be sequenced if they contain a
poly(A) tail. (2) The high sequencing error may introduce
mismappings, especially for low-quality reads. These
reads would not be assigned to the canonical model
under our assumptions because of the high number of
mismatches. However, we think the associated bias is
low, because minimap2 is very robust against high error
rates and because the reads are very long, thus ensuring
that the mapper has sufficient aggregate information on
a given read to position it very reliably on a reference.
(3) The library preparation protocol for DRS includes the
ligation of adapters via a T4 ligase. Any ligase could
potentially introduce artificial chimera, although we did
not investigate this systematically. Again, we think that
this does not affect our results substantially: First, this
bias is random and it seems unlikely that we would
observe the very same RNA ’isoform’ many times if it was
created by random ligation. Second, many ’isoforms’
that we observed only once (e.g. those colored pink
and blue in Figure 3) were structured plausibly: They
contained a leader sequence and had recombined at
expected (self-similar) sites corresponding to putative
or validated TRSs, with downstream sequences being
arranged in a linear 5’-3’-order. (4) Finally, it is important
to note that the RNA used for DRS was isolated
from cells infected with a serially passaged pool of
recombinant viruses rescued after transfection of in vitrotranscribed genome-length (27.3 kb) RNAs. Transfection
of preparations of in vitro-transcribed RNA of this large
size likely included a significant proportion of abortive
transcripts that lacked varying parts of the 3’ genome
regions, rendering them dysfunctional. It is reasonable
to suggest that the presence of replication-incompetent
RNAs lacking essential 3’-terminal genome regions may
have triggered recombination events resulting in the
emergence of DI-RNAs that contained all the 5’- and 3’terminal cis-active elements required for RNA replication,
but lacked non-essential internal genome regions. Upon
serial passaging of the cell culture supernants for 21
times, DI-RNAs may have been enriched, especially in
the HCoV-229E (wild-type) sample (Figure 3). Comparative DRS analyses of RNA obtained from cells
infected with (i) plaque-purified HCoV-229E and (ii)
newly rescued recombinant HCoV-229E (without prior
plaque purification), respectively, would help to address
the possible role of prematurely terminated in vitro
transcripts produced from full-length cDNA in triggering
the large number of DI-RNAs observed in our study.
Although, for the above reasons, the low percentage of
canonical mRNAs (12 %) in our samples likely represents
an underestimate, our study may stimulate additional
studies, for example to revisit the production of mRNAs
from non-canonical templates 54,55 . Also, it is worth mentioning in this context that, for several other nidoviruses,
such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus
(BCoV), and arteriviruses, evidence has been obtained

The majority of sg RNAs (other than mRNAs) we found
in our samples likely represent DI-RNAs, which are a
common occurrence in coronavirus in vitro studies 19 .

Figure 5: 5mC methylation of various annotated coronavirus
mRNAs. The transcripts have been aligned such that corresponding genomic positions can be found in the same vertical
column across facets. Both the leader sequence (including
the TRS) as well as the nested subgenomic sequences
show consistent patterns of methylation across transcripts.
Exemplary positions that display consistent methylation across
all investigated transcripts are marked as red vertical lines.
Note that while coronavirus recombination uses two TRS,
the resulting transcript has only one TRS, because of selfsimilarity based pairing of the TRS. Positions have been
labelled ’methylated’ if at least 90 % of the reads show a
methylation signal. Using this threshold, the estimated FPR
is below 5 %.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to perform RNA
modification calling without prior treatment of the input
sample. It only relies on the raw nanopore signal.
While DNA modifications such as 5mC methylation have
been explored extensively 61 , less is known about RNA
modifications 62 , the importance of which is debated 63 .
We found consistent 5mC methylation patterns across
viral RNAs when tested at a FPR below 5 %. We were
not able to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the

prehensive data exists on prior expectations for such
modifications in Coronaviruses, which might or might not
correspond to those observed in e.g. humans.
In addition, we observed that the software used 39
will likely present high error rates in regions of low
coverage or where the underlying reference assembly is
erroneous. This is because the resquiggle algorithm –
upon which this method is based – has to align the raw
nanopore read signal to the basecalled read sequence
(see Supplemental Fig. 6). This is necessary to test
the raw signal against learned modification models, of
which at the time of manuscript preparation (May 2019)
only 5mC was implemented for RNA. Nevertheless, new
options to call these modifications at an acceptable error
rate without any RNA pretreatment is a powerful method.
The validity of the methylation signal should be confirmed
in future studies using e.g. bisulfite sequencing. Ideally, this validation should start from in vitro, synthetic
transcripts where modified bases have been inserted
in known positions. Furthermore, RNA modification
detection from single-molecule sequencing is a current
bioinformatic frontier, and algorithms and tools are
under active development. We showed that consistent
5mC methylation patterns were seen across different
subgenomic RNAs. However, the overall pattern of the
methylation calls between subgenomic RNAs and the
negative control was very similar. At a false positive
rate of 5 %, the RNA modifications we identified are
supported by their consistent occurence. However, we
cannot rule out that instead, the observed pattern might
be caused by an alignment artifact. In the employed
methylation calling algorithm, the raw signal is aligned
to the nucleotide sequence after basecalling. If there
is a systematic bias in this alignment, and certain
sequence motifs cause a consistent mapping mismatch,
this mismatch could lead to false positive methylated
sites. This is, because in these positions the signal would
deviate from the expected one due to the misalignment,
and not due to methylation. In future experiments this
can be decided using a positive control in the form of
an RNA transcript with known 5mC methylated sites.
However, even if we are in its early stages, the reading
of RNA modifications from the read signal has great
potential to elucidate viral biology.
We were able to reconstruct accurate consensus sequences, both for the Illumina and nanopore data. We
also demonstrated that individual transcripts can be
characterized. More problematic was the resolution of
quasispecies in our experimental setup. Although DRS
allowed us to confirm the presence of each of the two
heterologous SL2 structures present in the SL2 sample,
this was only possible for subgenome-length (DI-) RNAs.
It appears that the high error rate of more than 10 % was
a critical limitation when analyzing the SL2 region located
at the extreme 5’-terminal end of the 27.3 kb genome
RNA. This high error rate made variant calling difficult,
particularly under low-coverage conditions, as was the
case in our analyses of the 5’-UTR of genome-length

Nanopore long and direct RNA-Seq of coronaviruses
RNA (results not included). The current generation of
long-read assemblers is not well suited to reconstruct
many viral genome architectures, such as nested ones.
The development of specialized assemblers would be of
great help in virology projects.
We used a hybrid error correction method (HG-CoLoR 48 )
that uses Illumina data to correct read-level errors.
However, it remains questionable whether the corrected
read sequence is truly representative of the ground truth
read sequence. Signal-based correction methods such
as Nanopolish 65 may be more promising, however, at
the time of manuscript writing (May 2019) correction
on direct RNA data has not been implemented. We
expect this to become available in the near future.
Combined with the ever-increasing accuracy of the
nanopore technology, we think this method might be able
to study quasispecies soon.
There are recombination events observed in the Illumina
data that were not detected in the Nanopore data.
These are likely caused by misalignment of the short
single-end reads (50 nt). A minimum of only 10 nt
was required for mapping on either end of the gapped
alignment. This was a trade-off between sensitivity to
identify recombination sites and unspecific mapping.
In this work, we demonstrated the potential of longread data as produced by nanopore sequencing. We
were able to directly sequence the RNA molecules of
two different samples of one of the largest RNA virus
genomes known to date. We showed how very large
RNA genomes and a diverse set of sg RNAs with
complex structures can be investigated at high resolution
without the need for a prior assembly step and without
the bias introduced by cDNA synthesis that is typically
required for transcriptome studies.
The detail and quality of the available data still require
significant bioinformatic expertise as the available tooling
is still at an early development stage. However, the
technological potential of nanopore sequencing for new
insights into different aspects of viral replication and
evolution is very promising.
Future studies should investigate both strands of the
coronavirus transcriptome. Studies focusing on RNA
modifications need to employ well-defined positive and
negative controls to assess the error rate of the current
software alternatives. Also, the DRS method will be
extremely powerful if it comes to analyzing the nature
and dynamics of specific haplotypes in coronavirus populations under specific selection pressures, for example
mutations and/or drugs affecting replication efficiency
and others.
Our work also serves as a proof-of-concept demonstrating that consistent RNA modifications can be detected
using nanopore DRS.
To fully exploit the potential of DRS, several improvements are needed: First and foremost, a significant
reduction of the currently very high per-read error rate

is crucial. This is especially problematic in studies
focusing on intra-sample heterogeneity and haplotypes.
Secondly, protocols that limit RNA degradation during
library preparation would be of great value. This could
be achieved by shortening the library protocol. To limit
the cost of DRS, barcoded adapters would be desirable.
On the bioinformatics side, the basecaller for DRS data
is still at an early stage and, for example, cannot
accurately call the poly(A) regions as well as the RNADNA-hybrid adapter sequences. Further basecalling
errors likely result from RNA modifications, which need
to be modelled more accurately. However, once these
limitations will be fixed, the use of nanopore-based DRS
can be expected to greatly advance our understanding
of the genomics of virus populations and their multiple
haplotypes.

Methods
RNA virus samples
The two total RNA samples used in this study for DRS
(ONT MinION) and Illumina sequencing were prepared
at 24 h post infection from Huh-7 cells infected at an MOI
of 3 with recombinant HCoV-229E WT, HCoV-229E_SL2SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV, respectively 41 .
Prior to sequence analysis, the two RNA samples
obtained from HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV- and HCoV229E_SL2-BCoV-infected cells were pooled (SL2 sample, see Supplemental Fig. 7).
Generation of recombinant viruses and total RNA isolation were carried out as described previously 41 . Briefly,
full-length cDNA copies of the genomes of HCoV-229E
(GenBank accession number NC_002645), HCoV229E_SL2-SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV,
respectively, were engineered into recombinant vaccinia
viruses using previously described methods 66–68 . Next,
full-length genomic RNAs of HCoV-229E, HCoV229E_SL2-SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV,
respectively, were transcribed in vitro using purified
ClaI-digested genomic DNA of the corresponding
recombinant vaccinia virus as a template. 1.5 µg of
full-length viral genome RNA, along with 0.75 µg of
in vitro-transcribed HCoV-229E nucleocapsid protein
mRNA, were used to transfect 1×106 Huh-7 cells using
the TransIT® mRNA transfection kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Mirus Bio LLC). At 72 h
post transfection (p.t.), cell culture supernatants were
collected and serially passaged in Huh-7 cells for 21
(WT) or 12 times (HCoV-229E_SL2-SARS-CoV and
HCoV-229E_SL2-BCoV), respectively.
Nanopore sequencing and long-read assessment
For nanopore sequencing, 1 µg of RNA in 9 µl was carried into the library preparation with the Oxford nanopore
direct RNA sequencing protocol (SQK-RNA001). All
steps were followed according to the manufacturer’s

August 14, 2019

Nanopore long and direct RNA-Seq of coronaviruses
specifications. The library was then loaded on an R9.4
flow cell and sequenced on a MinION device (Oxford
Nanopore Technologies). The sequencing run was
terminated after 48 h.
The raw signal data was basecalled using Albacore
(v2.2.7, available through the Oxford Nanopore community forum). Due to the size of the raw signal files, only
the basecalled data were deposited at the Open Science
Framework (OSF; doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UP7B4).
While it is customary to remove adapters after DNA
sequencing experiments, we did not perform this preprocessing step. The reason is that the sequenced
RNA is attached to the adapter molecule via a DNA
linker, effectively creating a DNA-RNA chimera. The
current basecaller – being trained on RNA – is not
able to reliably translate the DNA part of the sequence
into base space, which makes adapter trimming based
on sequence distance unreliable. However, we found
that the subsequent mapping is very robust against
these adapter sequences. All mappings were performed
with minimap2 69 (v2.8-r672) using the ’spliced’ preset
without observing the canonical GU...AG splicing motif
(parameter -u n), and k-mer size set to 14 (-k 14).
Raw reads coverage and sequence identity to the HCoV229E reference genome (WT: GenBank, NC_002645.1;
SL2: stem loop 2 sequence replaced with SARSCoV SL2 sequence) were determined from mappings
to the references produced by minimap2. Read origin and sequencing error statistics were assessed by
mapping the reads simultaneously with minimap2 to a
concatenated mock-genome consisting of HCoV-229E
(WT and SL2 variants respectively), yeast enolase 2
mRNA (calibration strand, GenBank, NP_012044.1), and
the human genome (GRCh38). Identity and error rates
are the number of matching nucleotides (or number of
nucleotide substitutions, insertions or deletions) divided
by the total length of the alignment including gaps from
indels.
Consensus calling of nanopore reads was performed
with Ococo 46 (v0.1.2.6). The minimum required base
quality was set to 0 in order to avoid gaps in low coverage
domains.
We used the hybrid error correction tool HG-CoLoR 48
in conjunction with the Illumina HiSeq short-read data
sets of both samples to reduce errors in all reads that
exceed 20k nt in length. The program builds a de Bruijn
graph from the near noise-free short-read data and
then substitutes fragments of the noisy long reads with
paths found in the graph which correspond to that same
fragment of the sequence. HG-CoLoR was run with
default parameters except for the maximum order of the
de Bruijn graph, which was set to 50 in order to fit the
length of the short reads.
Illumina HiSeq sequencing and assembly
Illumina short-read sequencing was performed using
the TruSeq RNA v2 kit to obtain RNA from species

with poly(A) tails and without any strand information.
The three samples (WT, SL2_SARS-CoV, SL2_BCoV)
selected for this study were prepared on a HiSeq 2500
lane and sequenced with 51 cycles. After demultiplexing,
23.2, 22.0, and 23.8 million single-end reads were obtained for the WT and the two SL2 samples, respectively.
The raw sequencing data was deposited at the OSF
(doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UP7B4).
Characterization of transcript isoforms and subgenomic RNAs
We first defined TRS as a 8-mer with a maximum
Hamming distance of 2 from the motif UCUCAACU. We then
searched the HCoV-229E reference genome (GenBank,
NC_002645.1) for all matching 8-mers. We then synthesized sg RNAs in silico as follows: For each pair of
complementary 8-mers (5’-TRS, 3’-TRS) we accepted
at most 1 mismatch to simulate base pairing under
a stable energy state. We then joined two reference
subsequences for each pair or TRS: First, the 5’-end up
to but not including the 5’-TRS. Second, the 3’-end of the
reference genome including the 3’-TRS and excluding
the poly(A) tail.
This way we obtained about 5,000 candidate sg RNAs.
To validate them, we mapped the nanopore reads to
these ’mock’ sg RNAs in a non-discontinuous manner,
i.e. all reads had to map consecutively without large
gaps. To count as a putative hit, 95 % of the read length
had to uniquely map to a given mock transcript, and the
mock transcript could not be more than 5 % longer than
the read.
We only considered putative hits as plausible if they had
a read support of at least 5. With this threshold, we
aim to balance the sensitivity of finding plausible novel
transcripts with a need to control the number of false
positives.

competing interests.

We used Tombo (v1.3, default parameters) 39 to identify
signal level changes corresponding to 5mC methylation
(see Supplemental Fig. 6).
To assess the false positive rate (FPR) of the methylation
calling, we used an RNA calibration standard (RCS) as
a negative control. It is added in the standard library
preparation protocol for direct RNA sequencing. This
mRNA standard is derived from the yeast enolase II
(YHR174W) gene 70 and is produced using an in vitro
transcription system. As a consequence, the mRNA
standard is not methylated.
For a conservative resquiggle match score of 1.3 (part
of the Tombo algorithm, default setting for RNA) and
a methylation threshold of 0.9, the FPR was 4.67 %,
which met our requirement that the FPR be smaller than
5 %. Our experimental setup did not include a positive
methylation control.
