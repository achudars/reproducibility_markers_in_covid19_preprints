Abstract
Extracellular Matrix (ECM) assembly and remodeling are critical physiological
events in vivo, and abnormal ECM assembly or remodeling is related to pathological
conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibrosis, cancers, and genetic diseases. ECM
assembly/remodeling driven by cells represents more physiological processes.
Collagen I (COL) is very abundant in tissues, which assembly/remodeling is mediated
by biochemical and mechanical factors. How cells regulate COL assembly
biomechanically still remains to be well understood. Here we used fluorescent COL in
the medium to study how cells assembled ECM which represents more physiological
structures. The results showed that MDCK cells actively recruited COL from the
medium and helped assemble the fibers, which in turn facilitated cell branching
morphogenesis, both displaying high spatial associations and mutual dependency.
Inhibition of cellular contraction force by ROCK and Myosin II inhibitors attenuated
but did not block the COL fiber formation, while cell motion showed high consistency
with the fiber assembly. Under ROCK or Myosin II inhibition, further analysis
indicated high correlation between local cell movement and COL fiber strength as
quantified from different regions of the same groups. Blocking cell motion by actin
cytoskeleton disruption completely inhibited the fiber formation. These suggest that
cell motion coordinated COL fiber assembly from the medium, possibly through
generated strain on deposited COL to facilitate the fiber growth.

Introduction
Epithelial branching (or tubular) structures exist broadly in organisms. Organs such as
salivary glands, lungs, breasts and kidneys are composed of complex branching structures,
and during embryonic development, the formation of these branching organs is called
"branching morphogenesis" [1,2]. Mechanical force called biomechanics has important
influence on developmental processes. Scientists even believe that mechanical and
chemical factors are both indispensable for controlling embryonic development [3].
There have been studies on branching morphology on cell senses of physical factors in
the environment, tension between cells and adjacent cells, and the effect of mechanical
interaction between cells and extracellular matrix [4,5,6]. Recent study by Guo &
Ouyang, et al. has found that ECM plays an important role in the formation of epithelial
branching structure in MCF-10A cells, in which the long-range force between cells
induces COL rearrangement and forms a mechanical feedback effect [7]. In the latest
research, Baker et al. designed synthetic fibers with controllable stiffness, and found that
cell stretching and network deformation led to recruitment of a large number of fibers
around cells [8].
ECM assembly and remodeling are critical physiological events in vivo, and abnormal
ECM assembly or remodeling is involved into pathological conditions such as
osteoarthritis, fibrosis, cancers, and genetic diseases [9]. ECM assembly is mediated by
both biochemical processes and mechanical force, and force on ECM regulates ECM
remodeling, ligand binding, and homeostasis [10]. For instances, strain on fibronectin
exposes the self-association sites to promote self-assembly [11,12,13]; fibre stretch-assay
studies revealed that mechanical force regulates the interactions of fibronectin and Col

[14]. Tension is required for fibrillogenesis of COL secreted by embryonic tendon cells
[15]. Enzymatic degradation of COL fibrils is down-regulated by increasing mechanical
stretch loading [16,17]. Basically, physical force is actively involved into ECM assembly
and remodeling [18]. The mechanism of how cells regulate COL assembly from the
medium biomechanically remains to be well understood.
In three-dimensional cell culture studies, COL often exists as extracellular matrix
within the hydrogel. In vivo, the initial COL is secreted by the cells, and participates in
the formation of collagen bundles [19]. COL assembly and remodeling driven cells
represent more physiological processes. How COL molecules in medium form cellsassembled fibrillar structure remains unclear. In this work by using CNA35-EGFPlabeled COL in the medium, we visualized the developing process of cells-assembled
COL fibers, and found cell contraction force-dependent motions regulated the fiber
assembly from COL in the medium.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
MDCK cells were purchased from the Beijing Beina Science & technology Co., Ltd.
and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, high glucose; Thermo
scientific) supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum (FBS; Thermo scientific) and 1%
antibiotic (penicillin & streptomycin; Thermo scientific). Cells were incubated at 37°C in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.
Matrigel was purchased from BD Biotechnology, and type I collagen from rat tails
from Advanced Biomatrix. Cytochalasin D, Blebbistatin, and Y27632 were purchased

from Sigma. Plasmid pET28a-EGFP-CNA35 was purchased from Addgene [20]. Mouse
monoclonal anti-collagen type I antibody (Clone COL-1), and Rhodamine-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Sigma.
Cell culture on 3-D Matrigel
Firstly, we prepared polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (DOW) wells for making 3-D
Matrigel. The E600 gel (Shenzhen Hongyejie Technology Co., Ltd) was poured into a
48-well plate, and formed individual cylinders with a diameter of 1 cm. The PDMS base
and the cross-linking agent were thoroughly mixed at a mass ratio of 10:1, poured into a
large dish with uniform insertion of the previously prepared cylinders, and then cured at
70 °C after vacuuming. After removal of the cylinders, PDMS wells were generated with
a diameter of 1 cm and thickness of 0.5 cm. To assemble the PDMS molds, the prepared
PDMS wells were plasma treated to achieve a more hydrophilic surface and then attached
onto glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
To prepare the 3-D Matrigel, about 70 μl of Matrigel solution (BD Biotechnology)
was added into a PDMS mold on ice, and then gelled at 37 °C for 30 min. COL
molecules in solution (4 mg/ml) were labeled with EGFP-CNA35 protein (~0.48 mg/ml)
at volume ratio of 1:5 (EGFP-CNA35: COL) on ice for 10 min. Culture medium
containing 1.5x104 cells/cm2 and 20 μg/ml labeled COL was added on top of the 3-D
Matrigel, and the samples were incubated in the cell culture incubator or imaged under
live-cell microscopy.
Plasmid pET28a-EGFP-CNA35 was transformed into E. coli to produce EGFPCNA35 protein. The expression and purification procedures were described in our
previous work [21,22].

Immunofluorescence
The samples cultured on 3-D Matrigel were first washed with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, permeablized with 0.3% Triton-X 100 for 15 minutes,
and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin V (BSA) (BioFroxx, Germany). The
immune-reaction was carried out overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. Mouse
monoclonal anti-collagen type I antibody (Clone COL-1), and Rhodamine-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were used at dilution of 1:500 and 1:100, respectively. The
primary antibody was washed away with PBS, and the secondary antibody was added for
staining at 37 °C for 1 hour. Finally, the nucleus was stained with DAPI, and washed
with PBS two minutes later. The fluorescence images were captured using the
microscopy imaging system Zeiss cell observer (Karl Zeiss, Germany). Most of the
imaging experiments on 3-D Matrigel were performed under a 20x objective.
Mean fluorescence intensity quantification of COL fibers
A sample below displays the process to quantify the mean fluorescence intensity of
COL fibers on the images. Briefly, in the software MatLab, the fluorescence on the image
at the 24-hour time point (time 24) was subtracted by the same position at the start time
point (time 0) as background. The resulted image (time 24-0) was switched into the
format of gray (time 24-0 gray) by binary processing, in which the pixel values fell into
the scale of 0-255. The mean value was calibrated based on the average value among
those pixels with a threshold value above 10.

Cell motion tracking
The image stack from the time course was processed by binarization in the software
ImageJ. The positions of cell nuclei from a single cell were tracked along with the stack
by using the function ‘manual tracking’ (Plugins -> Tracking -> Manual Tracking). The
resulted readouts of coordinate (x, y) value from each time point were recorded into
Excel (Microsoft) file, and further input into MatLab for calculation of move distance,
and for graphic output of the migration trajectory.
Statistical analysis
The values from different group data were plotted using GraphPad Prism6 software.
Each value on the bar graphs represents the mean ± S.D (standard deviation). Student’s ttest was applied for statistical analysis, and P value < 0.05 was considered to be
significant difference.

In order to visualize COL fiber formation, COL molecules were labeled with
fluorescent CNA35-EGFP, a COL binding protein [20,23]. MDCK cells (~2x104
cells/cm2) were cultured on 3-D Matrigel with 20 µg/ml fluorescence-labeled COL in the
medium. In 24 h, MDCK cells formed branching structure along with fluorescent COL
fibers on the Matrigel surface (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cells formed individual clusters and
no fluorescent fibers were visible when culturing with CNA35-EGFP only without COL
in the medium (Fig. 1B).
To further confirm the fluorescent COL fibers, immunostaining of the samples with
COL antibody (red) did display the co-localization with CNA35-EGFP (green) (Fig. 1C).
The fluorescent fibers only showed up when co-existence of cells and CNA35-EGFPlabeled COL in the culture system, but were not obvious when containing CNA35-EGFP
only, cells with CNA35-EGFP, or CNA35-EGFP-labeled COL only (Fig. 1D). These
data together indicate the mutual dependence that cell branching formation required the
existence of COL, and the fiber assembly from soluble COL also depended on cells.

conditions. (E) Simultaneous visualization of cell branching and COL fiber formations.
MDCK cells were seeded on 3-D Matrigel with 20 ug/ml COL labeled with CNA35EGFP in the medium. The time-lapse imaging with 30 min interval recorded the dynamic
process of branching and fiber assembly (aslo seen in Movie S1). The lines on the images
indicate the cell branching occurrence, and the arrows point to fluorescent COL fiber
assembly.
The dynamics of COL fiber assembly along with cell branching
The fluorescence-labeled COL allowed to check the dynamics how soluble COL in
the medium was assembled into fibrillar structure. We used time-lapse imaging to
simultaneously visualize cell branching formation and COL fiber assembly. After cells
were seeded on the 3-D Matrigel, the dynamics was recorded as follows (shown in Fig.
1E and Movie S1): 1) cells started to initiate mutual connections for branching formation
(indicated by the lines), and bright fluorescent spots appeared around cells in 2 h (pointed
by the arrows), suggesting the possible recruitments of COL from medium by cells; 2) in
4-6 h, the fluorescent spots grew larger, and fibrillar collections between them started to
show up, along with the appearance of cell branching structures at early stage; 3) in 8-12
h, the fibrillar structures got more apparent, the cell branching extended along with more
cell-cell connections, and the two were associated spatially; 4) in 16-22 h, the COL fibers
were assembled with sharp shape, and the cell branching was formed with grown strength,
which two showed well spatial association. It was also seen that COL fibers were not
uniformly distributed along with the cell branching, which might be partially due to
lacking soluble COL later in the medium. From the dynamic process, the occurences of

the cell branching and COL fiber assembly showed mutual dependence with close
spatiotemporal associations.
Cell contraction force-mediated COL fiber assembly
To further check whether cell contraction force regulates the mutual-dependent
assembly of cell branching and COL fibers, we added ROCK signaling inhibitor Y27632
(40 µM) or Myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin (25 µM) into the cell culture, which both
inhibited cell contraction force. In comparison, cells formed longer branchings at the
control condition (DMSO), whereas cells formed short branchings with either inhibitor in
24 hours (Fig. 2A(i-iii)). This was further confirmed by quantification of the branching
length (Fig. 2B). COL fibers were still assembled with or without inhibitors, however, the
fibers looked much stronger and sharper in morphology under control condition (Fig.
2A(i-iii)), which average of fluorescence intensity showed ~60% stronger than those with
inhibitors (Fig. 2C). The dynamic time courses of cell branching morphogenesis and fiber
assembly were further displayed in Movies S2-4 (under control condition, or with
Y27632 or Blebbistatin treatment). These data indicate certain dependence of the fiber
assembly on cell contraction force. When addition of Cytochalasin D (Cyto D) (1 µM) to
inhibit cell actin cytoskeleton, neither cell branchings nor COL fibers were assembled
(Fig. 2A(iv), Movie S5), suggesting that the intact cytoskeleton was required for
assembly of cell branching and COL fibers.

COL fiber assembly relying on cell motion
To further understand why inhibition of cell contraction force disturbed branching
and COL fibers formations, we did quantification to track cell motions during the 24
hours seeding on the 3-D Matrigel. Under control condition, cells migrated in a more
persistently directional way (Fig. 3A, Movie S2), whereas with Y27632 and Blebbitatin
inhibitors, cells migrated more randomly without persistent directions (Fig. 3B-D).
Inhibition of cell contraction force significantly attenuated cell mobility, as shown by the
difference in total travel distance among the few conditions (Fig. 3E). Inhibition of
Myosin II by Blebbistatin seemed to have more impact on cell motility than ROCK
signaling by Y27632 (Fig. 3E). Quantification of final displacements showed that cells
reached much smaller translocations at spatial scale under inhibition of cell contraction
force than those under control condition (Fig. 3F), indicating inefficient directional

migration after contraction force inhibition. Inhibition of intact actin cytoskeleton almost
blocked cell translocation (Fig. 3F), which was consistent with the observation that no
cell branchings or COL fibers were assembled under Cyto D treatment (Fig. 2A(iv)).
To further confirm whether cell motion mediated COL fiber assembly, we quantified
the local cell movement and corresponding fiber fluorescence from the same group of
time courses (from Fig. 2A(ii, iii) under the condition of contraction inhibition. Under the
inhibition condition with Y27632 or Blebbistatin, further analysis found that those areas
with relatively more active cell motions also generated stronger COL fibers, as shown in
Fig. 4(A-C) in which there was positive correlationship between local cell mobility and
fiber assembly from the same group of image samples. Taken together, these data suggest
cell motions relying on contraction force and actin cytoskeleton facilitated COL fiber
assembly from the medium during the branching formation.

Discussion
The components of ECM are secreted by cells in vivo, while ECM provides critical
biochemical and mechanical communications with cells and tissues. The studies on
matrix biology have been a long-time topic, and cells-assembled ECM represents more
physiological structures and relevance [10,24,25]. In this work, we used fluorescent COL
in the medium to exam how cells assembled the COL fibers on the top of 3-D Matrigel.
This method provides a convenient way to visualize the dynamics of cell-based fiber
assembly and to further investigate the underlying mechanism.
Our data showed that cell branching and COL fiber formation had a mutualdependent relationship (Fig. 1), and the deposition of COL into the fibers was
coordinated with the branching growth (Fig. 2). The recruitment of COL from the
medium by the cells was an active process, which promoted branching formation. In
considering that in vivo cells and tissues produce ECM components and help organize
ECM physiological structures [10,13], our experiments provided evidence for the

processes of cells-assisting COL fiber assembly, and cell branching morphogenesis
shaped by COL fibers from in vitro study.
To investigate whether biomechanical force is involved into the fiber assembly, we
demonstrated that inhibition of cell contraction force significantly reduced the strength of
the fibers as measured by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A&C), and at the same time, cells
only formed short and local branches (Fig. 2B). It is also worth noting that COL was still
assembled into long but weaker fibers under the contraction inhibition conditions (Fig.
2A). When further looking at how intracellular contraction force regulated COL fiber
assembly, tracking analysis showed cell motions, particularly directional migrations,
were attenuated by inhibition of contraction force (Fig. 3A-C). Even in the same group of
cells with contraction inhibition by Y27632 or Blebbistatin, those local regions with more
cell motions had relatively stronger COL fibers (Fig. 4). Furthermore, disruption of
cellular actin cytoskeleton almost blocked cell translocations, as well as completely
inhibited both cell branching and COL fiber formations (Fig. 3A(iv)&C). So there was
high coordination between both attenuated cell motions and fiber assembly, and both
blocked cell translocation and fiber assembly. To put together, inhibition of cell
contraction force reduced but didn’t block COL fiber assembly, while cell motion was
closely relevant to the fiber growth.
COL fiber assembly/remodeling is highly regulated by biomechanical and
biochemical processes [17,26,27]. ECM assembly and remodeling driven by cells
represent more physiological processes occurring in vivo [9]. Our work revealed that cell
mobility was an active factor in facilitating cells-mediated COL fibrillar assembly from
the medium. This suggested new insights in matrix biology that cell motions might

provide a biophysical microenvironment such as dynamics and strain/stress in assisting
ECM assembly or remodeling. As a feedback, cells-assembled ECM structures actively
joined in the developments of cell functions and morphogenesis such as cell branching
formation here, indicating a precisely regulated biological system.
In summary, MDCK cells actively recruited COL molecules from the medium and
regulated the fiber assembly, which in turn guided cell branching morphogenesis. The
COL fiber assembly was mediated by cell contraction force and motions. We
hypothesized that cell motions generated pulling force on COL fibers, which facilitated
the fiber growth. Further studies will be needed to identify the molecular machinery of
cells in recruiting and assembling COL fibers from the medium, and to discover the
mechanism of possible strain-induced growth of fiber bundles.
