Abstract
Economic and decision-making theories suppose that people would disengage from an
extremely difficult task, because such a task does not implicate any normative utility values
(i.e. success probability is almost zero). However, humans are often motivated for an
extremely challenging task with little chance of success, even without any extrinsic
incentives. The current study aimed to address how the nature of the task (luck vs. skill) and
the presence of extrinsic rewards modulate this challenge-based motivation, and its neural
correlates. Participants played a game-like, skill-based task with three different probabilities
of success (i.e., high, moderate, and extremely-low chance of success), in one group without
performance-based rewards (no-reward group) and the other group with performance-based
monetary rewards (reward group). Participants in the third group played a similar task but the
reward outcome was determined in a probabilistic manner (gambling group). Participants in
the no-reward group showed increased intrinsic motivation, as the chance of success
decreased (i.e. the task becomes more difficult) even if the task was almost impossible to
achieve. On the other hand, the reward group exhibited the highest intrinsic motivation when
the task had a moderate chance of success, and participants in the gambling group showed
decreased intrinsic motivation as the chance of success decreased. The ventral striatum and
the ventral pallidum also showed similar patterns of activation. These results suggest that,
both at the behavioral and neural levels, people are intrinsically motivated to challenge a
nearly impossible task, but only when the task requires certain skills and extrinsic rewards are
not available.
Key words: effort, challenge-seeking, reward, ventral pallidum, ventral striatum

Introduction
In December 2015, the Government Communications Headquarters in the United
Kingdom released a Christmas puzzle. The puzzle was allegedly extremely difficult and time
consuming at the time of announcement, and apparently promised no monetary rewards for
solving it. Nevertheless, more than 600,000 people tried to solve the puzzle and
(unfortunately) no one succeeded. As illustrated in the example, humans seem to have a
natural inclination to challenge an extremely improbable outcome, even without extrinsic
incentives (e.g., monetary rewards). It is difficult to explain such challenge-oriented
motivation (e.g., Loewenstein, 1999), because there is little chance of succeeding in the task,
making normative utility value almost zero according to standard economic, decision-making,
and reinforcement-learning theories.
The purpose of the current article is to examine the conditions under which people
express such motivation for nearly impossible outcomes and its neural correlates. The
dopaminergic reward network is activated more strongly when people are presented with
cues signalling higher expected reward value (for reviews Delgado, 2007; Diekhof et al.,
2012; Bartra et al., 2013). Based on these findings, the reward network is expected not to be
activated by cues that predict a task with extremely-low chance of success. Past studies on
reward and decision-making, however, overlooked two critical factors for understanding the
task motivation for nearly impossible outcomes. First, previous studies mainly employed
tasks in which outcome was decided in a pure probabilistic manner (luck task). In contrast,
we are often motivated for challenging tasks in our daily life when the task requires some
skills. When task success is contingent upon one’s skills, people focus more on the
improvement of their skills, rather than task success itself; as a result, people may exhibit
greater persistence after failure (Lee and Kim, 2014; Lee and Reeve, 2017), perhaps even
when the task is almost impossible to achieve.

Second, previous research has typically implemented extrinsic rewards to quantify the
value of task cues. However, humans are often intrinsically motivated for a challenging task
in the absence of extrinsic incentives (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In fact,
performance-contingent extrinsic rewards can put people in a conflicting situation in the face
of a challenging task. Specifically, people’s intrinsic motivation for challenge may be offset
by the risk of losing out potential extrinsic rewards. In other words, there may be a qualitative
difference in people’s motivation when extrinsic reward is at stake and when it is not
(Murayama et al., 2010a; Baranes et al., 2014; Braver et al., 2014).
We examined whether the nature of the task and the presence of extrinsic rewards
influence people's motivation for nearly impossible outcomes and how these factors influence
neural responses to the task with different chance of success (including a near impossible
task). Participants were engaged in a game-like task (Figure 1A) in which rewarding outcome
is determined by participants’ skills (skill task) or is probabilistically determined (luck task).
Some participants performed the skill task without performance-contingent extrinsic rewards
(no-reward group), but others played the task with outcome-contingent monetary rewards
(reward group). The remaining participants played the luck task, where they simply received
extrinsic rewards that were determined in a pure probabilistic manner (gambling group).
Across all groups, each trial was preceded by a cue indicating the success probability of the
upcoming task --- high-, moderate-, and extremely-low chance (of success) conditions.
Previous studies have shown that the reward network in the brain (e.g. the striatum)
represents the rewarding value as well as the motivational relevance/mental preparation for
an upcoming task (e.g., Carter et al., 2009; Krebs et al., 2011). Thus, we primarily focus on
the activation in the reward network, especially in the striatum.
We predicted that participants would exhibit motivation for the task with extremelylow chance of success only when they were engaged in a skill task without extrinsic

incentives (no-reward group; Figure 1B, blue line). On the other hand, when participants
were engaged with extrinsic rewards (reward group), we expected that participants’
motivation for improbable outcomes would be hampered due to the low expected
performance reward (Figure 1B; blue and red lines). When participants were engaged in a
luck task with extrinsic incentives (gambling group), there was no room for people to focus
on the improvement of their skills. As such, we predicted that participants' motivation would
monotonically decrease as the chance of winning rewards decreased, simply because a task
with higher chance of success involves higher expected performance reward (Figure 1B, red
line). We further expected that these differential patterns of motivation between groups
would track the striatal activation in the brain.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Fifty-five participants (mean age = 20.05, SD = 1.37; 28 males) were allocated to the
no-reward group, the reward group, or the gambling group, constituting a 3 (group, between
subjects: no-reward, reward, or gambling) x 3 (chance of success, within-subjects: high
chance, moderate chance, or extremely-low chance) factorial design. Participants in the
reward and no-reward groups were randomly assigned to these groups, and the data for the
gambling group were later collected. Prior to data analyses, we excluded data from four
participants: one due to a technical problem, another due to an incidental finding, one due to
large motions, and the other because the participant failed to press buttons in most trials. This
resulted in 17 participants in the no-reward condition, 17 participants in the reward condition,
and 17 in the gamble condition. Thus, the final study sample consisted of N = 51 adults aged
between 18 and 24 (M = 20.1, SD = 1.39), with 23 males and 28 females.
Experimental Procedures
Participants played a stopwatch task, which was designed based on the task used in

previous research (Murayama et al., 2010b; Murayama et al., 2015). Participants’ task was to
stop a stopwatch within a specific time window --- between 49.95 and 50.05. There were
three types of stopwatches which are different in terms of the chance of success: a) in the
high-chance condition, the stopwatch started from 49.95 and ran 100-time slower than an
ordinary watch; b) in the moderate-chance condition, the stopwatch started from 45.00 and
ran in the same speed as an ordinary watch (like the ones used in previous research); c) in the
extremely-low chance condition, the stopwatch started from 0.00 and ran 10-time faster than
an ordinary watch. Thus, while the initial time was different across the three types of the
stopwatches, they were different in their speed, allowing us to manipulate task difficulties
while making the trial duration similar across the conditions (e.g., in all conditions
participants needed to press a button around 5 seconds after the stopwatch started in order to
stop the stopwatch at 50.00).
In the no-reward and the reward groups, each trial (Figure 1) started with three
question marks. Upon participants’ button press, the question marks were replaced by a word
cue indicating the task difficulty level (i.e. chance of success) of the subsequent stopwatch:
“easy” (i.e. high chance of success), “intermediate” (i.e., moderate chance of success), and
“super advanced” (i.e. extremely-low chance of success). The cues (and the following
stopwatches) were differently colored depending on the chance of success (blue, green, and
orange), and the assignment of the colors was counterbalanced across participants.
Participants were then shown the stopwatch, and asked to press a button with the right thumb
to stop it right between 49.95 and 50.05. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of the cue
presentation and start of the stopwatch task was jittered between 4.5 and 8.5 seconds.
Immediately after they pressed the button, they were shown success feedback or failure
feedback for 0.8 seconds, followed by a jittered ITI between 3 and 7 seconds. This task
sequence was optimized to examine the brain activation associated with the cue presentation.

Unbeknownst to participants, in the extremely-low chance condition, the displayed time
when they stopped the stopwatch was manipulated so that participants always failed. In the
moderate chance condition, we made an online adaptive adjustment of task difficulty based
on participants’ previous task performance so that most participants achieved approximately
50% accuracy. In the high-chance condition, the task was so easy that participants succeeded
in all trials without any manipulations. No participants indicated the possibility that their task
performance had been manipulated after the experiment. If participants pressed a button too
early or too late (e.g., if participants did not press a button within 10 secs after the stopwatch
started), a warning message “please press a button” appeared and this trial was skipped.
Prior to the session, participants were told about the differences of the three different
types of stopwatches. Specifically, participants were told that the stopwatch game in the high
chance condition would be very easy and they can easily win; that the moderate chance
condition would be moderately difficult; and that the extremely-low chance condition would
be extremely difficult and would be almost impossible to win. Participants in the reward
group were further told that they would earn 100 yen (approximately USD 1) for every
success irrespective of the type of stopwatch. Participants in the no-reward group were not
told anything about performance-based monetary rewards.
The procedure in the gambling group was similar to that in the reward group with a
few exceptions. As in the reward group, participants were told that they would earn 100 yen
for each time that the stopwatch stopped between 49.95 and 50.05. However, unlike the
reward group, they did not have control over the timing at which the stopwatch stopped and
the stopwatch was called a lottery machine. They were simply asked to watch the stopwatch
starting and stopping on its own and press the button after the stopwatch stopped. If the
stopwatch stopped within the time window, this trial was regarded as hit (success) and
participants earned money. Participants were told that the outcome would be determined by

the computer and the task cue would indicate the chance of hit (success) in that trial.
Specifically, they were instructed that it would be almost certain that they can earn money in
the high-chance condition, whereas it would be almost impossible that they would earn
money in the extremely-low chance condition. They were also told that there would be a fair
chance (50%) of earning money in the moderate chance condition.
In all three groups, participants also completed a control condition, in which they
simply viewed a stopwatch starting and stopping on its own and pressed the button after the
stopwatch stopped without any monetary rewards (watch-stop condition). The watch-stop
condition was preceded by a word cue “passive viewing”, and the color of the cue and the
stopwatch was always gray. The stopwatch ran in one of three different speeds (randomly
chosen), which were matched to one of the three chance-of-success conditions). If
participants did not press a button within 2 seconds after the stopwatch stopped, a warning
message “please press a button” appeared and this trial was repeated.
Across all groups, participants completed 80 trials (20 trials with high chance of
success, 20 trials with moderate chance of success, 20 trials with extremely-low chance of
success, and 20 watch-stop trials) that were divided into two runs of 40 trials. The sequence
of the trials (i.e. the trial order of conditions) was randomized across participants, but to
control for any potential trial order effects, we used the same set of trial sequences across the
three groups. In addition, the sequence of success and failure trials in the gambling group was
matched to that in the reward group. After the session, they completed a self-reported
questionnaire asking their intrinsic motivation to engage in the three types of stopwatch tasks
(three items taken from Elliot and Harackiewicz, 1996; e.g., "It was fun to play the stopwatch
of high chance of success", Cronbach's alpha = .82 - .95). Participants also answered two
questions about their perceived rewarding value towards the task cue for each of the three
stopwatches (“The cue for the moderately difficult stopwatch made me pleased”, “The cue

for the extremely difficult stopwatch made me disappointed”, reverse coded, rs = .67 - 89).
fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing
The functional imaging was performed on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scanner (MAGNETOM Trio, A Tim System, Siemens, Germany) with a 32-channel matrix
head coil at the Tamagawa University with gradient echo T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging
(EPI) sequence. The imaging parameters were TR = 2500 ms, TE = 25 ms, slice thickness = 3
mm, and flip angle = 90°. The data were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping
12 (SPM12, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). Images were motioncorrected with realignment to the first volume of the session, co-registered to the biascorrected, segmented structural image, spatially normalised to the standard Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI, and spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm.
fMRI Data Analysis
For each participant, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response was
modeled with the general linear model (GLM) for the following regressors of interest: the
high-chance stopwatch cue, the moderate-chance stopwatch cue, the extremely-low-chance
stopwatch cue, and the three watch-stop cues (i.e. watch-stop cues with three different
speeds; they were separately modeled and then averaged). In addition, feedback for
stopwatch trials, error trials (i.e. participants did not press a button for a certain duration; see
experimental procedures; for these trials, the entire duration of the trial was modeled), session
effects, and motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest. The regressors
(except motion parameters and session effects) were calculated using a boxcar function for
each stimulus convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) without
derivatives. Temporal autocorrelation was accounted for by using a first-order autoregressive
model during Classical (ReML) parameter estimation. Results for the three watch-stop cues

were averaged and used in the following three contrasts to examine the effects of different
cues: (i) a contrast between the low-chance stopwatch cue and the averaged watch-stop cues;
(ii) another contrast between the moderate-chance stopwatch cue and the averaged watchstop cues; and (iii) a contrast between the extremely-low chance stopwatch cue and the
averaged watch-stop cues.
The resulting contrast images were submitted to a 3 (chance of success: high chance,
moderate chance, or extremely-low chance) x 3 (group: no-reward, reward, or gambling)
mixed ANOVA with chance of success as within-subject factor and group as between-subject
factor. Our primary analysis focused on the reward network in the brain, especially the
striatum/pallidum. Thus, we performed a region of interest (ROI) analysis. The
striatum/pallidum ROI mask included the bilateral caudate, putamen, and pallidum from the
Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). For the
purpose of completeness, we also conducted a set of whole-brain GLM analyses. We applied
a voxel-level family-wise error (FWE)-corrected threshold (PFWE < 0.05) for ROI analysis.
For the whole-brain analysis, we used cluster-extent FWE-corrected threshold with the
cluster defining threshold of p = 0.001 (PFWE < 0.05).
Parametric Modulation Analysis
We conducted a parametric modulation analysis to examine the brain areas associated
with participants’ self-report ratings (intrinsic motivation for the task and rewarding value
toward the task cue) for each level of chance of success. Specifically, we ran GLMs in which
task cues (high, moderate, and extremely-low chance of success) were treated as a single
regressor and the mean ratings of intrinsic motivation for the task or the rewarding value
toward the task cue were added as a parametric modulator. Other regressors were the same
with the main analysis. The contrast of interest was activation associated with the parametric

modulator of stopwatch cues compared to the watch-stop cue. For thresholding, we used the
same FWE correction methods as in the main analysis.
Functional Connectivity Analysis
We also conducted a functional connectivity analysis (i.e. beta series correlation;
Rissman, Gazzaley, & D’Esposito, 2004) in order to examine which brain regions were coactivating with the ventral striatum/ventral pallidum during the cue presentation. To perform
this analysis, a separate GLM was constructed in which every stage of every trial was
modelled with a separate covariate. We then estimated the functional connectivity (i.e.
correlation across estimated beta values in the GLM) between a seed region and other brain
areas for the stopwatch and the watch-stop task separately for each chance of success for each
subject. The seed regions were 5 mm-spheres around the peak voxel observed in the right and
the left ventral striatum/ventral pallidum in the previous ROI analysis. The analyses were
performed using the BASCO toolbox (Göttlich, Beyer, & Krämer, 2015), and the ROI masks
were created using MarsBar (Brett, Anton, Valabregue, & Poline, 2002). The correlation
maps for the watch-stop task were subtracted from those for the stopwatch task, and the
resultant maps were compared between the conditions. We used a cluster-extent FWEcorrected threshold (PFWE < 0.05) with the cluster defining threshold of p = 0.005, and further
applied a Bonferroni correction for two separate seed regions (i.e. the left and right ventral
striatum/ventral pallidum).
Results
Behavioural results
Ratings of the intrinsic motivation for the task were analysed using a 3 (group: noreward, reward, or gambling) x 3 (chance of success: high chance, moderate chance, or
extremely-low chance) mixed ANOVA. This ANOVA showed a main effect of chance of
success, F(2,96) = 10.02, P < .001, generalized η2 = 0.13, which was further qualified by the

interaction between group and chance of success, F(2,96) = 22.72, P < .001, generalized η2 =
0.41. The pattern of the results confirmed our prediction (Figure 2A). Specifically,
participants in the no-reward group showed a linear pattern with an increase in intrinsic
motivation when the chance of success decreased, exhibiting greatest intrinsic motivation for
improbable outcomes. In the reward group, on the other hand, intrinsic motivation was
highest in the moderate chance condition; participants exhibited an increase in intrinsic
motivation in the task with moderate chance of success compared to the task with high
chance of success, but then intrinsic motivation decreased as the chance of success became
extremely low; this resulted in an inverted-U trend as a function of chance of success. Finally,
as predicted, participants’ intrinsic motivation in the gambling group decreased as the chance
of success decreased, showing an opposite linear pattern from that in the no-reward group. A
post-hoc trend analysis supported our observation of a positive linear trend in the no-reward
group, a quadratic trend in the reward group and a negative linear trend in the gambling
group, b = 0.877, t(38.70) = 6.55, P < .001.
A similar ANOVA on the ratings of rewarding value toward the task cue also showed
a main effect of chance of success, F(2,96) = 16.73, p < .001, generalized η2 = 0.21, which
was again qualified by an interaction effect, F(2,96) =20.80, P < .001, generalized η2 = 0.39.
Interestingly, the pattern was somewhat different from intrinsic motivation (Figure 2B).
Participants in the no-reward and gamble groups followed the same trends as observed in the
ratings for intrinsic motivation, while those in the reward group showed a decreasing trend as
chance of success decreased: when the task became difficult (i.e. chance of success
decreased), participants reported reduced reward value for the task cue. In a subsequent a
post-hoc trend analysis, this pattern (positive linear in no-reward, negative linear in reward
and gambling) was confirmed, b = 1.314, t(51) = 7.24, p < .001 (see Figure 2B). In both of

the ANOVAs, the main effect of group was not significant, Fs(2, 48) ≤ 2.33, Ps ≤ .10,
generalised η2s ≤ 0.02.
We also examined participants’ task performance. Although we manipulated
performance feedback (see Experimental Procedures; this ensures that participants’
subjective feelings of success were controlled across participants and groups), it was still
possible to examine the objective performance regarding whether participants were able to
press the button in the right timing, given that participants in the reward and no-reward
groups were motivated to stop the stopwatch right at 5.00 seconds after the start of the
stopwatch. We performed a 2 (chance of success; moderate chance vs. extremely-low
chance) X 2 (group; no-reward vs. reward) ANOVA on the actual timing participants pressed
a button. There was a significant main effect of the group, F (1, 32) = 4.79, P < 0.05,
generalized η2 = 0.06 suggesting that participants in the reward group stopped the stopwatch
relatively earlier and less accurately (M = 4.919sec, SD = 0.065) than those in the no-reward
group (M = 4.945sec, SD = 0.042 in the no-reward group). These results are consistent with
the incentive-dependent performance decrements reported in previous research (Mobbs et al.,
2009); pressures arising from performance-based extrinsic rewards may have impaired task
performance. The main effect of chance of success and the interaction effect were not
statistically significant (Ps > .05).
Main GLM analysis of fMRI data
The 3 (group) x 3 (chance of success) mixed ANOVA in our anatomical ROI (i.e., the
striatum) revealed a significant interaction between group and chance of success in the
bilateral ventral striatum extending into the ventral pallidum (VS/VP; Figure 2C; Ps < .05,
voxel-level FWE corrected; k = 22 and 26 for the left and the right VS/VP, respectively;
voxels in the right cluster survived with voxel-level FWE even at the whole brain level; P
< .05). Confirming our hypothesis, the pattern of the results was consistent with the self-

reported intrinsic motivation: whereas participants in the gambling group showed decreased
activation in the VS/VP for task cues predicting lower-chance task of success, participants in
the no-reward group showed increased activation for task cues predicting lower-chance of
success. Participants in the reward group, on the other hand, showed an inverted U pattern,
showing the highest activation for the task cues predicting moderate chance of success.
To demonstrate that these results do not simply reflect the general activation pattern
in the entire brain, we also conducted a whole brain analysis to explore other brain areas
showing a similar pattern. In this analysis, we defined a contrast that is aligned with the
interaction pattern observed in the VS/VP: high chance (of success) = -1, moderate chance =
0, and extremely-low chance = 1 for the no-reward group; high chance = -1; moderate chance
= 2, and extremely-low chance = -1 for the reward group; and high chance = 1, moderate
chance = 0, and extremely low chance = -1 for the gambling group. The results showed that,
in addition to the cluster peaked at the bilateral VS/VP, a large cluster in the bilateral
occipital cortex and clusters in the cerebellum, the left inferior parietal lobule, and the
bilateral middle/inferior frontal gyrus showed significant activation (Table S1; Ps < 0.05,
cluster-level FWE corrected). However, the VS/VP cluster exhibited the highest peak
activation. For completeness, we also report the full results of the whole brain analysis with
the full factorial 3 X 3 ANOVA in Table S2.
GLM using individual reports as parametric modulators
One interesting observation from the previous analyses is that, whereas participants in
the no-reward group exhibited the highest intrinsic motivation (or the highest VS/VP
activation) with extremely-low chance of success, participants in the reward group showed
decreased intrinsic motivation (and the striatal activation) for the cue for extremely-low
chance of success relative to the cue for moderate chance of success. One possible
explanation is that, in the reward group, participants’ intrinsic motivation for the near

impossible task was compromised by the fact that they are very unlikely to obtain monetary
rewards (Figure 1B). In fact, perceived rewarding value for the task cue linearly decreased in
the reward group as the chance of success decreased, suggesting that participants expected
less monetary rewards for the task with less chance of success (Figure 2B).
Because intrinsic motivation for the task and expected extrinsic rewards are in direct
conflict in the reward group, the group allows us to dissociate the neural correlates
underlying these two processes. For that purpose, we conducted a parametric modulation
analysis for participants in the reward group, using the ratings for intrinsic motivation for the
task or rewarding value toward the task cue at each chance of success as a parametric
modulator (Table 1). Consistent with the previous GLM results using ANOVA (Figure 2C),
the VS/VP activity was positively correlated with the ratings of intrinsic motivations (P < .05,
voxel-level FWE corrected). In addition, outside of the striatum ROI, the inferior frontal
lobule was positively correlated with intrinsic motivation (P < .05, cluster-level FWE
corrected). In contrast, the inferior parietal gyrus, the supplementary motor areas, and the
precentral gyrus were positively correlated with the ratings of rewarding value for the task
cue (Ps < .05, cluster-level FWE corrected). Figure 3 shows these overlapping as well as
distinct activation patterns for intrinsic motivation and rewarding value for the task cue.
These results suggest distinct neural mechanisms underlying intrinsic motivation for the task
and the expected value for extrinsic rewards.
Functional Connectivity Analysis
To further examine the neural mechanisms underlying the decreased intrinsic
motivation under the extremely-low chance of success in the reward group, we conducted a
beta-series functional connectivity analysis (Rissman et al., 2004), which directly compared
the functional connectivity in the extremely-low chance condition between the no-reward
group and the reward group. The results showed that the activation in the left VS/VP (one of

the seed regions) was less correlated with the activation in the supplementary motor area in
the reward group (relative to the no-reward group). These results suggest there was functional
decoupling between the left VS/VP and the supplementary motor area when participants in
the reward group expected a task with little chance of success (Figure 4, P < .05 with
Bonferroni correction, cluster-level FWE corrected).
Discussion
The current study aimed to examine the factors influencing people's motivation for a
nearly impossible task and its neural correlates. Our results showed that, when the task
success depended on participants’ skills (i.e. skill task) and did not promise any extrinsic
rewards, participants' intrinsic motivation increased as the task became more difficult (i.e.
lower chance of success), even to the extent that the task was almost impossible to achieve.
However, when the task was skill-based but participants were promised performance-based
monetary rewards, participants' intrinsic motivation was hampered when the chance of
success was extremely low; their motivation was peaked when the chance of success was
moderate, exhibiting an inverted-U shape relationship between chance of success and
intrinsic motivation. Also, when the task did not involve any skills and the outcome was
determined in a purely probabilistic manner (i.e. luck task), the task motivation
monotonically decreased as the chance of success decreased. VS/VP activation in response to
the task cue showed the same pattern, and indeed it was associated with the self-reported
intrinsic motivation on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, the present research suggests that, both at
the behavioral and neural levels, people are often intrinsically motivated to challenge a nearly
impossible task but this happens mainly when the task requires certain skills and extrinsic
incentives are not available.
Our findings pose some challenge to the normative economic and decision-making
theories, because such a nearly impossible task should have little utility value given the

extremely low expected success probability (Loewenstein, 1999). In fact, in the current
experiment, participants never succeeded in the task of extremely-low chance of success.
Using skill-based tasks, some previous neuroimaging studies have examined the effects of
task difficulty by manipulating task demands (Croxson et al., 2009; Kurniawan et al., 2010;
Krebs et al., 2011; Skvortsova et al., 2014; Ulrich et al., 2014; Dobryakova et al., 2017). In
these studies, however, participants in high demand task conditions exhibited decent task
performance, making it difficult to disentangle the pure challenge-oriented motivation from
the expected positive outcomes. In addition, most of the previous studies introduced extrinsic
rewards to motivate participants toward an effortful task (for exceptions, see (Krebs et al.,
2009; Boehler et al., 2011)). As our findings suggest, the presence of performance-based
extrinsic rewards would make the interpretation of the results difficult, because such rewards
provide external incentive to engage in a task with higher chance of success, which could be
in direct conflict with people’s intrinsic inclination to work on a task of low chance of
success.
Some existing theories have attempted to explain people’s challenge seeking behavior.
For example, in the field of robotics and computational modelling, Oudeyer et al. (2013) (see
also Baranes et al., 2014) argued that, when there are no explicit extrinsic rewards, agents
may use learning progress as intrinsic rewards to motivate behavior. In the literature of
psychology, researchers indicated that people seek (moderate) challenge because this
provides people with feelings of competence and control (Nicholls, 1984; Deci and Ryan,
1985; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), feelings of task achievement and pride (McClelland et al.,
1976; Sedikides and Strube, 1997), self-definition (Gendolla and Richter, 2010), and
opportunity to reduce uncertainty to gauge one’s own ability (Trope, 1979). All of these
theories, however, do not provide a viable explanation of why people are motivated for a
nearly impossible task, because these theories consider occasional experiences of success as a

critical source of motivation. One potential explanation for the observed intrinsic motivation
for the nearly impossible task is that participants were motivated to see how close they could
be to succeeding in the task. In other words, in the absence of extrinsic rewards, participants
might have gauged their achievement and progress against these internally generated subgoals, rather than the externally-defined task success. In fact, in the current task, participants
were able to see how close their button press was to the success. Future research should
examine the exact psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the motivation for nearly
impossible tasks.
This point also highlights the importance of distinguishing between skill tasks and
luck tasks in decision-making and neuroscience research (see also Vostroknutov et al., 2012).
A luck task (e.g. number guessing task) is a popular and predominant paradigm in decision
science/neuroscience to examine how people or animals learn expected reward value from a
task and make a decision. However, as noted above, people and animals also have the
capacity to acquire rewarding value from the feeling of competence, acquiring knowledge,
and achieving self-set goals (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Gottlieb et al., 2013; Murayama, 2019).
This means that more complex decision-making mechanisms might be operative with a task
that entails some sort of skill learning or knowledge acquisition (e.g., Knutson et al., 2005;
Roiser et al., 2010; Aarts et al., 2014). This aspect of the decision-making process is still
underexamined in the literature (for an exception, Baranes et al., 2014), but worth attention
for future research.
Parametric modulation analysis in the reward condition showed that the expected
monetary reward value toward the task cue and intrinsic motivation for the task were
supported by the common as well as distinct brain areas, suggesting the importance of
dissociating these subjective states when extrinsic rewards are provided to participants.
Among the brain areas uniquely associated with the rewarding value toward the task cue, the

18

inferior parietal lobule is often activated when anticipating an extrinsic reward (Liu et al.,
2011), and therefore, one straightforward interpretation is that this activation simply reflects
the expected value for extrinsic rewards. Another possibility is that the inferior parietal lobule
is related to higher-order comparison and integration of different types of tasks and rewards.
In fact, in the reward group, the expected value for monetary rewards was in conflict with the
intrinsic value for the difficult task, and participants had to accommodate these opposing
values. Supporting this idea, a previous fMRI study showed that the inferior parietal lobule is
related to expected large future rewards at the cost of immediate losses (Tanaka et al., 2004),
suggesting the possibility that this area is activated when different sources of rewards are in
conflict and thus need to be integrated (see also Wisniewski et al., 2015).
Our functional connectivity analysis suggests that there is decreased functional
connectivity between the (left) VS/VP and the supplementary motor area when participants in
the reward group expected a near impossible task. Supplementary motor area and its adjacent
area, presupplementary motor area, have been implicated in internally-generated actions and
sense of agency (Gallagher, 2000; Nachev et al., 2008), and has been activated when
participants mentalized voluntary engagement (Lee and Reeve, 2013). Importantly, both
presupplementary motor areas and the striatum showed deactivation when extrinsic
incentives undermined people’s voluntary engagement in a task (undermining effect;
Murayama et al., 2010a). These results indicate that the supplementary motor cortex may
play a critical role in initiating voluntary task engagement after receiving the signal of
internal rewarding value from the striatum. Although exploratory, our findings may add more
evidence to this line of perspective --- the decoupling between the VS/VP and supplementary
motor area in the reward condition may represent the disruption of this coordination because
there is a direct conflict between extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation for challenge.

The current study demonstrated that people have the inherent capability to motivate
themselves for a nearly impossible task without extrinsic rewards, but in reality, failure is a
major source of psychological dis-functioning. This is because failure in real life involves a
multitude of factors that boost the negative implication of failure, such as social comparison,
loss of future opportunities, and stigmatization. Previous studies have identified a number
psychological underpinnings that are related to resilience and perseverance to failure (e.g.,
Duckworth et al., 2007; Trautwein et al., 2009; Yeager et al., 2016) and recent neuroimaging
work also started paying attention to the topic (e.g., Bhanji and Delgado, 2014; Murayama et
al., 2015; Sinha et al., 2016). Our work should be extended to accommodate such real-life
factors, to better understand the potential and limitations of our intrinsic motivation to
challenge very difficult tasks.

Figure 1. Task design and prediction. A. Task sequence. Participants were presented with a
task cue signalling different chance of success (“Easy” = high chance of success,
“Intermediate” = moderate chance of success, and “Super-advanced” is extremely low chance
of success), followed by the actual task. There were also control trials (“watch-stop” trials) in
which participants neither succeeded nor failed, but these trials were omitted from the figure.
B. A schematic picture of how expected performance rewards (red line) and motivation for
challenge (blue line) changes in an opposite manner as a function of task difficulty (chance of
success). Expected performance reward decreases as chance of success decreases (i.e. low
expected utility), whereas motivation for challenge increases as chance of success decreases.

Figure 2. Pattern of results as a function of group (no-reward, reward, and gambling) and
chance of success (high, moderately high, and extremely-low). A. Self-reported intrinsic
motivation for the task increased as the chance of success decreased in the no-reward group,
whereas the pattern was opposite in the gambling group. Reward group exhibited the highest
intrinsic motivation for the task with moderate chance of success. B. Self-reported rewarding
value for the task cue showed a similar pattern except that the rewarding value for the cue
monotonically decreased as the chance of success decreased in the reward group. C. The
bilateral ventral striatum/ventral pallidum activation (right figure, Ps <.05, voxel-level FWE
corrected) mirrored the pattern observed in the self-reported intrinsic motivation. In the noreward group, the ventral striatum/ventral pallidum activation increased as the chance of
success decreased.

Figure 3. Results of parametric modulation analyses in the reward group. Red shows areas
that are significantly positively related to the within-person change in self-reported intrinsic

motivation (i.e. activation was higher when intrinsic motivation was higher within an
individual). Blue shows areas that are significantly related to change in self-reported
rewarding value for the task cue (i.e. activation was higher when rewarding value for the cue
was higher within an individual). All Ps < .05, cluster-level FWE corrected.

Figure 4. Results of functional connectivity analysis (with the ventral striatum/ventral
pallidum seed) comparing reward and no-reward group for extremely-low chance of success.
The results indicate functional decoupling between the left ventral striatum/ventral pallidum
and the supplementary motor area when participants in the reward group expected a task with
extremely-low chance of success (P < .05 with Bonferroni correction, cluster-level FWE
corrected).
