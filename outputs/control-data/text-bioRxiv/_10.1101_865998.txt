Abstract
During inflammatory response, blood leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. This process
involves numerous adhesion molecules, including a transmembrane chemokine, CX3CL1. We
previously found that CX3CL1 clusters in oligomers. How this cluster assembles and whether
it has a functional role remain unknown. Using various biochemical and biophysical
approaches, we show that CX3CL1 clusters are homo-oligomers with 3 to 7 CX3CL1
molecules. We demonstrate that the transmembrane domain peptide self-associates at a
similar level in both cellular and acellular lipid environments while its random counterpart (a
scrambled peptide) does not. Hence, oligomerization is mainly driven by the transmembrane
domain intrinsic properties. Molecular modeling suggests that transmembrane peptide
oligomers are mostly made of monomers linearly assembled side by side. Using a new
adherence assay, we demonstrate that, functionally, oligomerization is mandatory for the
adhesive potency of CX3CL1. Our results indicate that CX3CL1-dependent cellular
adherence in key immune processes can be controlled by disrupting clusters using heterotopic
peptides, which, in turn, alter the adhesive function of the membrane CX3CL1 without
affecting the function of the CX3CL1 soluble form.

Introduction
The migration of blood leukocytes to damaged tissues is the first step of the inflammation
process and involves a sequence of coordinated interactions between leukocytes and
endothelial cells (Ingersoll et al, 2011; Langer & Chavakis, 2009; Luster et al, 2005). The
chemotactic cytokines called chemokines that primarily attract leukocytes, are central to the
physiological and pathological inflammatory processes (Charo & Ransohoff, 2006; OrtegaGomez et al, 2013; Ransohoff, 2009). Chemokines trigger leukocyte activation and their firm
adhesion to the inflamed endothelium, mainly through integrins (Combadière et al, 2007;
Simon et al, 2009; Speyer & Ward, 2011). Two members of the chemokine family are
exceptions: CXCL16 and CX3CL1. In addition to their chemokine domain (CD), these two
chemokines possess three domains: a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a
cytosolic tail (Bazan et al, 1997; Matloubian et al, 2000). When interacting with their cognate
receptors (CXCR6 and CX3CR1, respectively), these chemokines induce cell-cell adhesion
(Ludwig & Weber, 2007). CXCL16 and CX3CL1 can also be cleaved by metalloproteinases,
such as ADAM10 and ADAM-17 (Garton et al, 2001; Hundhausen et al, 2003; Ludwig et al,
2005), to produce a soluble form with chemotactic functions.
The CX3CL1 chemokine, with its unique CX3CR1 receptor (Imai et al, 1997), is involved in
adherence to the endothelium of the inflammatory monocyte population (CD14hi CD16CX3CR1+ CCR2+ in humans, Ly6Chi CX3CR1+ CCR2+ in mice) (Ancuta et al, 2003;
Babendreyer et al, 2017; Geissmann et al, 2003; Ludwig & Weber, 2007; Tacke & Randolph,
2006) likely through interaction with platelets (Postea et al, 2012; Schulz et al, 2007). This
chemokine is also involved in the recruitment of NK lymphocytes (Guo et al, 2003; Lavergne
et al, 2003) and in lymphocyte survival as in allergic diseases (Julia, 2012), as well as in
monocytic (Collar et al, 2018; White et al, 2014) and neuronal survival (Cipriani et al, 2011;
Kim et al, 2011; Meucci et al, 2000; Mizuno et al, 2003). An additional function of the
CX3CR1-CX3CL1 pair is the regulation of the patrolling behavior and the margination of
monocytes in blood vessels (Auffray et al, 2007; Hamon et al, 2017) or their adherence to the
bone marrow (Jacquelin et al, 2013). The CX3CL1 chemokine is also involved in
cytoadhesion of red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
(Hermand et al, 2016). The transmembrane form of CX3CL1, as well as the other

transmembrane chemokine CXCL16, is also involved in glial cross-talk (Ludwig & Mentlein,
2008), possibly by a new mechanism called inverse signaling (Hattermann et al, 2016).
We previously showed that two molecular features are involved in the CX3CL1 adhesive
function, i.e. the glycosylation of mucin stalk and the intracellular domain. Glycosylation
ensures the accessibility of CX3CL1 to the CX3CR1 molecules buried in the membrane of the
counter-adhesive cell while the intracellular domain anchors the transmembrane chemokine in
its cell membrane (Ostuni et al, 2014). We also showed that the CX3CL1 molecule selfassembles and that this assembly is mainly dependent of its TM domain (Hermand et al,
2008). This leads to a model in which the formation of adhesive patches is controlled by the
dynamics of the CX3CR1 receptors that bind the CD domain presented by CX3CL1 bundles.
(Ostuni et al, 2014). However, the exact nature of the CX3CL1 assembly is not known, as
well as the number of CX3CL1 monomer in each functional bundle. Using a large panel of
biophysical, biochemical and cell biology tools, we show here that the CX3CL1 self-assembly
is precisely due to the oligomerizing feature of its TM domain and that the oligomerization
degree is between 3 and 7. In silico molecular modelling suggests that CX3CL1 oligomers are
linearly organized. Finally, using the TM domain peptide alone, we were able to specifically
modulate the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 dependent cellular adherence, opening the way to new class
of inhibitors able to antagonize the function of the CX3CL1 membrane form without affecting
the role of the CX3CL1 soluble form.

Results
Aggregation degree of the whole CX3CL1
To determine the number of monomers per each CX3CL1 bundle, we first performed
electrophoresis of the cell homogenates of L929 cells stably expressing CX3CL1 (hitherto
denoted LCX3CL1) fused to EYFP at its C-terminal (Ostuni et al, 2014). SDS-PAGE showed
that the CX3CL1-YFP monomer is around 130 kDa (Fig 1A). Then, using native
electrophoresis after solubilization of LCX3CL cell homogenates in dodecylmaltoside (DDM)
(Fig 1B), we found an intense band around 480 kDa, i.e. ca. three-fold the molecular weight
of the monomer. Another band is also visible around 1100 kDa. Using a milder detergent,
digitonin, we found very similar results (Fig EV1). We next used another type of detergent
(CALX173ACE from CALIXAR) that was shown to maintain proteins oligomeric state (Agez
et al, 2019; Desuzinges Mandon et al, 2017; Igonet et al, 2018) and protein-protein
interactions (Rosati et al, 2015). To avoid unspecific staining, the CX3CL1-EYFP was
immune-purified before native electrophoresis. We found a major band at 480 kDa and a
minor one at 700 kDa, i.e. 5-fold of the monomer molecular weight, while a minor proportion
of the protein does not enter the gel (Fig 1C). Taken together our native electrophoresis
experiments point out that the native CX3CL1 is certainly not monomeric and contains at
least three monomers.
We next used the single-molecule TIRF microscopy, a reliable technique to investigate the
number of subunits in membrane protein complexes (Dietz et al, 2013; Hastie et al, 2013;
Hines, 2013; Teramura et al, 2006; Ulbrich & Isacoff, 2007; Zhang et al, 2010). This assay
was based on the measurement of spontaneous step-wise decrease of particle fluorescence,
assuming that the number of steps is directly related to the number of fluorophores per
particles. This technique requires that the fluorescent particles be at low density to ensure they
are spatially separated (Ulbrich & Isacoff, 2007). A mixture of LCX3CL1 homogenates and 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposomes was spread on a coverslip and
observed by TIRF microscopy (Fig 2A). DOPC was in large excess to ensure spatial
separation of the CX3CL1 clusters that appeared as isolated particles. The fluorescence

kinetics of more than hundred particles were analyzed. Some particle bleached in one step
(Fig 2B left), some in two (Fig 2B center) or more up to 7 steps (Fig 2B right). We noticed
that the step amplitude of the particles bleaching in 1 or 2 steps were substantially higher than
the amplitude of the fluorescence step of the particles bleaching in 3 steps or more (Fig 2C).
This pointed out that in these particles two or more chromophores were bleaching at the same
time, indicating that each LCX3CL1 particle would contain three EYFP or more. We
hypothesized that the mean amplitude of the fluorescence steps of particles bleaching in 4
steps or more (calculated to be 110 a.u.) corresponded to the bleaching of a single dye. So the
initial fluorescence intensity of each particle divided by this unit step was a good estimate of
the actual number of dyes in each cluster. The resulting distribution (Fig 2D) of the cluster
sizes indicated that CX3CL1 forms an oligomer containing 4 ± 2 monomers.
Oligomerization of the peptide corresponding to the TM domain of CX3CL1
As evidenced by BRET (Hermand et al, 2008) and by FRAP (Ostuni et al, 2014), the
monomers association of the membrane CX3CL1 molecule is mainly controlled by their
transmembrane domain. We intended to directly investigate the possible aggregation of the
TM peptide alone to avoid possible interferences of cytosolic and extracellular CX3CL1
domains. To this end, the peptide corresponding to the 20 residues of the TM domain was
synthesized, with 2 lysine added at each of its end to ensure solubility. The resulting peptide
is called TM24. As a control, we constructed a peptide called SCR24 (“scrambled”) with the
same residues randomly rearranged, except the two lysines at each end. We first checked that
these peptides fold correctly as alpha helices in appropriate buffer: when solubilized in
trifluorethanol (TFE) or detergent, both TM24 and SCR24 possess more than 55% of helical
structure, and more than 90% when solubilized in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) for TM24
(Fig EV2). The conformation of TM24 in DPC micelles was further examined at the residue
level by NMR spectroscopy. Analysis of NMR data confirms the helical conformation of the
peptide, starting at residue Val3 and stabilized by numerous van der Waals contacts between
Val, Leu and Phe side chains (Fig EV3).
We investigated the potential aggregation of the TM24 and SCR24 peptides by FRAP after
peptides incorporation in Giant Unilamelar Vesicles (GUVs) of egg phosphatidyl choline
(EggPC). To this end, the peptides were conjugated with fluorescein (FITC). Using bleaching
circle spot of various diameters (2 to 10 µm), we found different recovery times (Fig 3A). The
calculated diffusion rate is 0.09 ± 0.02 µm2sec-1 for TM24 and 1.14 ± 0.40 µm2sec-1 for
SCR24, showing that TM24 diffuses considerably slower than SCR24 (Fig 3B), and hence is
probably more aggregated than SCR24. This experiment was performed in GUV
environment, i.e. a strict two-dimensional medium. We also used a tridimensional medium
consisting of a lipid cubic “sponge” phase made with C12E5 lipids in the presence of n-octylβ-D-glucopyranoside (Adrien et al, 2016; Pincet et al, 2016). In this case, the bleaching
pattern was made with interference fringe (Davoust et al, 1982; Gambin et al, 2006; Reffay et
al, 2009). A very similar result was found (Figs 3C and 3D). Since the very slow lateral
diffusion of TM24 peptide – as compared to its SCR24 analogue - was observed in two
different types of pure lipids structure, it most probably corresponds to an oligomerization due
to intrinsic features of the peptide.
To directly catch its oligomerization, the peptides are subjected to crosslinking using
bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) after dissolution in DPC, and then analyzed by SDSPAGE (Fig 4A), as previously shown for the transmembrane domain of Carnitine
palmitoyltransferase 1 (Jenei et al, 2009). In absence of crosslinker, TM24 and SCR24 bands
appear between 3 and 6 kDa, i.e. as mixture between monomer and dimer (Fig 4A, left). After
crosslinking, SCR24 displays as a large smearing spot from 30 kDa to 200 kDa probably
corresponding to nonspecific aggregates (Fig 4A, right), which are also visible in the presence

of SDS (Fig 4A, left). In contrast, TM24 shows discrete bands stepping from 3 to 26 kDa (Fig
4A), i.e. with 1 to 10 monomers, as revealed by densitometry (Fig 4B). This confirms that the
TM24 peptide alone can correctly oligomerize.
The dynamical auto-association of TM24 has been assessed by coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulations. Three simulations in lipid boxes made of DOPC were built with one
NMR structure of TM24. 9 or 16 monomers were included in DOPC boxes at different
TM24/DOPC molar ratios (1/50 or 1/100) (Fig EV4A). The kinetics of TM24 peptide
assembly followed over 10 µsec simulations revealed the formation of various types of
oligomers ranging from dimers to nonamers (Fig 5A), depending on the initial conditions (Fig
EV4B and EV4C). Once formed, the monomer to monomer interaction was stable over time
leading to a compact interface, with an average distance between helix-helix center of mass
lower than 1 nm (Fig EV4D). The dimer association did not occur at random, but a favored
interface was observed where the TM are in almost parallel conformation, i.e. with azimuthal
angle of 20-30° (Figs 5B and EV4C). Further oligomer association from this initial dimer
showed an unexpected linear alignment of the TM interacting side by side (Fig 5A).
Finally, the oligomerization degree of the TM24 oligomer was investigated in cellular context
(Fig 6). The diffusion rate of the peptide expressed as a EYFP fusion in COS cells was
compared with the ones of different transmembrane proteins that are known to oligomerize
through their TM domains with a given number of monomers: the CD2 that is known to be
monomer (Bodian et al, 1994; Jones et al, 1992), the transmembrane domain of the dimerized
GlycophorinA (TM-GyA) (Lemmon et al, 1992), the pentamer phospholamban (Arkin et al,
1994; Colyer, 1993; Jones et al, 1985), the 7-TM CX3CR1 and the 12-mer RhBG (Callebaut
et al, 2006). The latter was previously deglycosylated to ensure that the extracellular domain
was not limiting the diffusion rate of the protein (Ostuni et al, 2014; Scullion et al, 1987; Wier
& Edidin, 1988). We find that TM24 diffusion rate is close to the one of the CX3CR1,
meaning that TM24 behaves as a heptamer in this cellular context. Taken together, our data
performed with three different types of experiments (FRAP in pure lipid environments, SDSPAGE after chemical cross-linking, FRAP in cellular context) all indicated the
oligomerization of the TM24 peptide, with an oligomerization degree between 4 and 7.
Use of TM-CX3CL1 peptide to alter the CX3CL1 function
Our results strongly suggest that the CX3CL1 oligomerization is only controlled by the
CX3CL1 TM domain. Therefore, the addition of peptide corresponding to the TM domain
may compete with native CX3CL1 in oligomers, reducing the local concentration in complete
chemokine and thereby altering the adhesive function of CX3CR1/CX3CL1 couple.
To directly test this hypothesis, we added the TM24 peptide to cells expressing the CX3CL1EYFP fusion protein and analyzed its diffusion behavior by FRAP in COS-7 cells (Fig 7).
Yet, we previously showed that CX3CL1 diffusion is highly controlled by the presence of the
mucin stalk. If, as hypothesized, the presence of TM24 peptides generates CX3CL1
assemblies with a smaller amount of CX3CL1 monomers, the viscous drag due to
extracellular mucin stalks will decrease, corresponding to an enhanced diffusion rate. This
was exactly what we found: in the presence of 3 µM or 10 µM of TM24, the diffusion rate of
CX3CL1 was considerably enhanced (Fig 7, filled bars). As a control, the addition of the
SCR24 peptide had no effect (Fig 7, empty bars).
Having shown that TM24 peptides altered the CX3CL1 lateral diffusion by possibly
dispersing the optimal CX3CL1 oligomer, we measured the impact of TM24 on the adherence
function. To this end, we quantified in real time the cell to cell adherence using the
LigandTracerTM technique (Hillerdal et al, 2016). As controls, the black solid trace of Fig 8A
represented the adherence of CHO expressing CX3CR1 (here called CHOCX3CR1) toward L929

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/865998; this version posted December 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

cells expressing CX3CL1 (called here LCX3CL1), while the black dashed trace represented the
adherence of the CHOCX3CR1 to non-transfected L929 cells. The adherence to LCX3CL1 was 3.5
fold higher than the non-specific adherence to L929. In the presence of 5 µM TM24, the
CHOCX3CR1 slightly more adhered to L929 (Fig 8A, red dashed trace). By contrast, the
CHOCX3CR1 adherence to LCX3CL1 was dramatically reduced (more than 2.2 fold less) (Fig 8A,
red solid trace) to the level of the non-specific adherence to L929 (compare both red traces in
Fig 8A). In the presence of 5 µM SCR24, the CHOCX3CR1 adherence to LCX3CL1 was
unchanged (Fig 8A, blue solid trace) while the adherence to L929 was similar to that in the
presence of TM24 (Fig 8A, blue dashed trace). Then, we calculated the specific adherence,
i.e. the adherence to LCX3CL1 subtracted by the adherence to L929 (Fig 8B). The inhibition of
the CX3CL1-specific adherence of the CHOCX3CR1 cells by TM24 was nearly complete
(compare the red trace to the control black trace). This inhibition was dependent on the
peptide sequence since the scrambled one had almost no effect (blue trace, Fig 8B). This
result was further borne out by showing the result of triplicate experiments after 60 min of
adherence (Fig 8B right): 5 µM TM24 reduced the CX3CL1-specific adherence to zero, while
5 µM SCR24 restrained it only by 20%.
To check that this TM24 specific effect is not due to some interference with CX3CL1CX3CR1 binding interface, we conducted binding experiments using the fluorescent
CX3CL1-AF647 with the same LigandTracerTM technique (Fig 8C). In the presence of the
TM24 peptide, the binding of the chemokine to the CHOCX3CR1 was only marginally affected
(Fig 8C, red trace), while it was completely suppressed in the presence of an excess of
unlabeled CX3CL1 (Fig 8C, dashed trace). Next, we assayed CHOCX3CR1 calcium response to
soluble CX3CL1 (Fig EV5): the presence of the TM24 peptide had no effect, confirming that
the presence of the cellular transmembrane CX3CL1 molecule is needed to reveal the TM24
action. Finally, we performed the cell-to-cell adherence assay in the presence of anti-CX3CL1
antibodies (clone AF365), which are known to bind to CX3CL1 surface directly binding to
CX3CR1. Indeed, this anti-CX3CL1 antibody clearly inhibited the CHOCX3CR1 adherence to
LCX3CL1 (Fig EV6). In the presence of a concentration of this anti-CX3CL1 that only
marginally alters the CHOCX3CR1 adherence (1 µg/ml), we found that the dose-response curve
of the TM24 peptide significantly shifted to the left (Fig 8D) meaning that less peptide was
required to obtain the same inhibition. The presence of 1 µM TM24 was only slightly
inhibitory without antibodies, while it almost wholly inhibited the specific adherence of
CHOCX3CR1 cells in the presence of 1 µg/ml of antibodies (Fig 8D). Taken together our data
showed that TM24 peptide effectively weakens the functional CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction
by acting on the transmembrane domain of the CX3CL1 molecule.

Discussion
The cell-to-cell adhesion mediated by CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction very probably implies
numerous molecules at each cellular adhesive interface. Indeed, the membrane form of
CX3CL1 self-associates in many cellular contexts, with an important role of the TM domain
as shown by our previous works (Hermand et al, 2008; Ostuni et al, 2014). However, the
question remained open to know if this association was an intrinsic property of the chemokine
molecule or is due to an interaction with another molecular partner keeping the CX3CL1
monomers together. We therefore conducted here experiments with the TM24 peptide alone.
As expected, this peptide is structured as an alpha-helix in lipid environment (Figs EV2 and
EV3). Moreover, we show that the lateral diffusion rate of the TM24 peptide is considerably
higher than its SCR24 analog in pure lipidic context, as shown by FRAP experiments using
two completely different lipid structures (Fig 3). This strongly indicates that TM24 selfassociation is a multimerization due to hydrophobic forces that are specific of the sequence of
the TM domain of CX3CL1. Electrophoresis data (Fig 4) confirm that the peptide assembly is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/865998; this version posted December 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

properly organized since cross-linking reveals discrete bands with 1 to 10 monomers. We
cannot exclude that the peptide oligomer contains some lipid inside, and that some lipid
moieties are mandatory for oligomerization; however, all the lipids we used here (DOPC,
Egg-PC, Figs 2 and 3A) can endow this organizing function. It also persists in L3 sponge
phase (Fig 3C) and in DPC micelles (Fig 4).
We therefore performed experiments with the whole CX3CL1 molecule. According to our gel
electrophoresis data in the presence of mild detergents (Figs 1B and EV1), CX3CL1 molecule
is present at least as a trimer; a similar result was obtained after solubilization using
stabilizing Calixarene-based detergent and immune-purification (Figs 1C). This shows clearly
that CX3CL1 does not exist as monomer but rather as high molecular weight populations.
Moreover, we cannot exclude that some of the oligomers were dissociated due to the
detergent and the pH shock of the immuno-purification. Furthermore, our single particle
fluorescence analysis indicates an oligomerization degree between 3 and 7 (Fig 1). This
experiment requires a high dilution in DOPC, meaning that the observed oligomerization is
due to intrinsic properties of the CX3CL1 molecule. Here again, it is not impossible that the
amount of monomers per particle could be underestimated since the EYFP fluorescence could
weaken before performing the experiment.
So our data converge to bear out that the CX3CL1 molecule does not behave as a dispersed
monomer, but as a polymer and at least as a trimer. We moreover cannot exclude that
CX3CL1 polymers include diverse populations with different oligomerization degree. Based
on all the present data (Figs 1-6), the CX3CL1 appears as oligomeric molecule containing
between three and seven molecules. Morover, the in silico experiments based on NMR
structure of TM24 confirm our in vitro and in cellulo data demonstrating that oligomerization
is an inherent property of CX3CL1-TM domain, even if the coarse-grained Martini model
used in the molecular dynamics calculations tends to generate excessive aggregation of
transmembrane helices (Javanainen et al, 2017).
Our FRAP experiment is consistent with such conclusion since the diffusion rate of the TM24
expressed in cellular context is as slow as the 7-TM CX3CR1 (Fig 6). Molecular modelling
suggests that the CX3CL1 oligomer is not organized as a bundle but rather as a linear
assembly (Fig 5A), favored by an interface involving Leu, Ala and Gly residues (Fig 5B). 3 to
5 linearly arranged TM would give the same Stokes radius as 7 closed packed TM (see
Materials and Methods). In any case, the CX3CL1 oligomerization allows to better capture
the CX3CR1 molecules of the counter-adhesive cell, especially if the CX3CR1 is linearly
organized to accommodate the potential dimer of CX3CR1 (Darbandi-Tehrani et al, 2010).
There are several adhesive molecules whose adhering function involves its homodimerization
through their transmembrane domain as integrin, ICAM-1 (Hynes, 2002; Miller et al, 1995).
Others are oligomeric like cadherin (Strale et al, 2015) or connexin (Herve et al, 2004) but in
this case, the oligomerization is mainly driven by the extracellular domain and appears in
specific membrane context (adherens or gap junctions) (Hong et al, 2010; Shapiro & Weis,
2009; Thompson et al, 2019). So, to our knowledge, CX3CL1 is the first example of an
oligomeric adherence molecule with at least three monomers in any cellular and lipidic
context.
The next question we address is to know if this TM-driven CX3CL1 oligomerization could be
inhibited by adding TM24 peptides. We first performed FRAP experiments using CX3CL1EYFP expressing cell line. The addition of micromolar concentration of TM peptide indeed
lead to significantly increased lateral diffusion, meaning a lighter CX3CL1 probably due to
decrease of its oligomerization degree (Fig 7). This prompted us to check if the CX3CL1
adherence function is dependent of its oligomerization. To this end, we used a new technique

able to follow in real time the cellular adherence in a confined volume (Fig 8). We found that
in the presence of 5 µM TM24 peptide, the CX3CL1-CX3CR1-dependent cell-to-cell
adherence is wholly inhibited, while the presence of 5 µM SCR24 has no effect (Figs 8A-8B).
To confirm that the TM24 peptide does not directly act on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 binding, we
show that the binding of soluble and fluorescent CX3CL1 to immobilized CX3CR1expressing cells was unaffected by the peptide (Fig 8C). We also show that the peptide has no
effect on the cell calcium response triggered by the soluble form of CX3CL1 (Fig EV5). This
means that the TM24 peptide does not affect the CX3CR1 binding interface to CX3CL1, but
rather acts by decreasing the number of functional CX3CL1 monomers in the CX3CL1
bundles able to efficiently interact with CX3CR1. This was further shown by using an antiCX3CL1 antibody, known to interfere with the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 binding (Fig 8D). This
antibody acts also by decreasing the number of CX3CL1 molecules able to interact with
CX3CR1. As expected, in the presence of such antibody, the TM24 inhibiting effect was
potentiated (Fig 8D). So the TM24 peptide could allosterically or heterotopically control the
availability of CX3CL1 oligomers to induce potent cellular adherence, in a similar way to the
integrin activating peptide corresponding to the integrin TM domain (Yin et al, 2006). It
would be interesting to test shorter peptides targeting specific spots of CX3CL1
transmembrane domain, in order to get inhibitors with better affinity.
In conclusion, our work demonstrates that CX3CL1 is an oligomeric molecule with at least
three monomers and that its oligomerization is required for its adhesive function. We also
show that this functional oligomerization could be controlled by a specific peptide
corresponding to the CX3CL1 TM domain that does not affect the function of the CX3CL1
soluble form. This could be useful to control the CX3CL1 function specifically linked to its
adherence feature, as the monocytes margination in vasculature (Hamon et al, 2017) and the
monocyte retention in bone marrow (Jacquelin et al, 2013). This tool could be of peculiar
worth to reduce the atherosclerosis by reducing the monocyte/macrophage adherence to
inflamed endothelia. It could also reduce the Falciparum gametocyte maturation by inhibit
their nesting in bone marrow.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, proteins and cell culture
Human CX3CL1 (Chemokine Domain) and polyclonal goat anti-CX3CL1 antibody (clone
AF365)
were
purchased
from
Biotechne
(Lille,
France).
Peptides
(KKVGLLAFLGLLFCLGVAMFTYKK called TM24, KKTLVACLVFGMLGYLAGFLFLKK called SCR24, TM24-FITC, SCR24-FITC) were synthetized either by the peptide
synthesis facility of the Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine (FR3631, Sorbonne Université,
CNRS) or by ProteoGenix (Schiltigheim, France). A human embryonic kidney cell line
(HEK293), the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (CHO), the COS-7 cell line and the mouse
connective tissue L929 cell line were grown in Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Stable
transfections with the pEYFP cx3cl1 construct (Ostuni et al, 2014) were performed using
JetPei (PolyPlus Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Stably transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418, ThermoFisher Scientific,
les Ulis, France), and single clones were established by limited dilution.
Cell membrane preparation for electrophoresis
L929 cells stably expressing CX3CL1-YFP (hitherto denoted LCX3CL1) were harvested from
culture flasks through treatment with Cell Dissociation Buffer (Life Technologies, Thermo
Fisher Scientific), washed in PBS, and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in Lysis Buffer
(Tris 10 mM pH 8) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cell lysis was performed on ice using a Bead Beater
homogenizer with 0.1 mm diameter glass beads. Membrane fractionation was then carried out
at 4 °C by sequential centrifugations. Three centrifugations were performed: 500xg for 5 min,
15000xg for 30 min, and 100000xg for 45 min. Membrane enriched pellets corresponding to
plasma membranes (100000xg) were resuspended in PBS, 200 mM NaCl, 1X protease
inhibitor cocktail and glycerol 10%, quantified using the BCA method (Pierce, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France), flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C until use.
SDS-PAGE
CX3CL1 samples (10µg) were denatured with 5x Laemmli buffer and incubated for 20 min at
RT prior to analysis without heating to avoid aggregates formation. Proteins were separated
by SDS-PAGE on a 4-15% acrylamide gel (4–15% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™
Gel, Bio-Rad) and subsequently immobilized by electro-transfer to PVDF membrane.
Native PAGE Native PAGE of solubilized proteins using digitonin and
dodecylmaltoside (DDM)
CX3CL1 samples were suspended in 75 µl of Native PAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in the presence of either 1% digitonin (Sigma) or DDM (Sigma) supplemented
with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) for 30 min at 4 °C under shaking. For
proteins separation, 40 μg were loaded in NativePAGE Novex Bis Tris Gels (3-12 %) and
transferred on a PVDF membrane according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Gels were electrotransferred to Hybond-P nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham
Biosciences), and the blots probed with polyclonal goat antibodies anti-CX3CL1. For
detection, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences).
Clear Native-PAGE of calixarene based solubilization and immuno-purification
Proteins from plasma membrane fractions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C at a final
concentration of 2 mg/ml in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1X protease

inhibitor cocktail, 20 glycerol and with 5 Critical Micellar Concentration of CALX173ACE
(CALIXAR). CALX173ACE solubilized CX3CL1 was loaded into magnetic beads
previously crosslinked to polyclonal anti-CX3CL1 antibody using an IP kit (Pierce, Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Retained CX3CL1 was eluted by pH shock (basic) followed by a
neutralization step. Non-denaturated proteins were separated by native-PAGE on a 4-15%
acrylamide gel (4–15% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™ Gel, Bio-Rad) using 25 mM
imidazole pH 8.0 as anode buffer and 50 mM Tricine, 7.5 mM imidazole, 0.05%
deoxycholate and 0.01% DDM as cathode buffer). Clear Native PAGE gels ran for 90 min at
200 V and 4 °C. Proteins were then immobilized by electro-transfer to PVDF membrane. The
immunodetection of CX3CL1 was performed by using the SNAP i.d. system (Millipore) with
primary antibody (R&D system, MAB3651) against CX3CL1 (1/500 dilution) and revealed
using a mouse HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, 3/10,000 dilution).
Single-molecule photobleaching TIRF
LCX3CL1 clone cells were harvested from culture flasks through treatment with Cell
Dissociation Buffer (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed in PBS, and
resuspended in Lysis Buffer (Tris 10 mM pH 8, 2 mM EDTA) supplemented with Complete
protease inhibitor (Roche, Merck, Sigma-Aldrich, l’Isle d’Abeau, France). After three cycles
of freezing – thawing, the lysate was centrifuged (500xg, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was
centrifuged at 4 °C at 16000xg during 45 min. The pellet containing the membrane was then
resuspended in the lysis buffer. 500µl of this pellet suspension was added to a tube in which
2.5 mg of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC, Avanti Polar lipids, Merck,
Sigma-Aldrich, l’Isle d’Abeau, France) in chloroform had previously been evaporated. The
tube was vortexed for 45 min. 10 µl of this mixture was deposited on a coverslip. Membranes
from homogenates and DOPC liposomes spontaneously spread on the coverslip. The
concentration of homogenates was low enough to observe individual fluorescent clusters
separated by large non-fluorescent DOPC regions. The particle fluorescence was analyzed by
an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, Netherlands) using a 60x
oil objective. The excitation light is provided by a 488 nm laser beam with an incidence larger
than the critical angle to ensure total reflection. For each monitored region of the coverslip, a
2 min movie was recoded. Bleaching of the clusters was subsequently analyzed using ImageJ.
FRAP in pure lipid environment with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs)
GUVs containing peptides were formed using the osmotic shock protocol (Motta et al., DOI:
10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01173, Langmuir 2015, 31, 7091−7099). In brief, 300 µg of EggPC
(L-α-phosphatidylcholine (Egg, Chicken), Avanti Polar Lipids) were dried in a glass tube. In
parallel, TM24-FITC and SCR24-FITC were solubilized at 1.2 µM in PBS. 330 µl of each
solution was added in different EggPC containing tubes that were subsequently vortexed for
an hour to form liposome-like structures containing 1000 lipids per peptide. On Mattek dishes
(Mattek Corporation), 2 µl of each solution was dried and rehydrated with 2 µl of pure water
(3 cycles) to form GUVs. After the last cycle, the Mattek dishes were filled with 500 µl PBS.
FRAP experiments were performed using a Leica 63x dry objective. Two identical regions of
interest (ROI) were monitored: one was photobleached during three scans with the 488 nm
laser beam at full power, and the other was used to monitor the concomitant effects of
intrinsic photobleaching. The pre- and post-bleach images were monitored at low laser
intensity (10 to 15% of full power). The fluorescence in the ROIs was quantified using the
LASAF Leica software. The analysis of the curve of the resulting fluorescence recovery as a
function of time yielded the recovery times that were used to obtain the diffusion coefficients
of the diffusing species. The diffusion coefficient is equal to D = r2/4where “r” is the radius
of the circular beam and “τ” is the time constant obtained from the fit of the curve

(Soumpasis, 1983). In our experiments, each cell was bleached over three different circular
regions with diameters of 3, 4, or 5 µm. The characteristic recovery times (τ) and fluorescence
recovery plateau (Fp) were calculated by fitting the fluorescence recovery curves as
previously described (Braeckmans et al, 2003; Soumpasis, 1983).
Fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching
Fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching (FRAPP) experiments were performed as
previously described (Adrien et al, 2016; Rayan et al, 2010). Briefly, TM24-FITC or SCR24FITC peptides were added into a L3 sponge phase prepared by mixing the non-ionic
surfactant C12E5 (pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether), the co-surfactant octylglucopyranoside and PBS. The samples were vortexed, sonicated, and equilibrated at
room temperature for at least 10 min. The distance among the bilayers is tuned by varying the
amount of these 2 compounds as previously described (Reffay et al, 2009)
The L3 phase was injected into capillary tubes of a 200 μm thickness (VitroCom, Mountain
Lakes, New Jersey), sealed with wax in order to prevent evaporation. Two interfering laser
beams were focused on a dot of approximately 250 μm of diameter creating a fringe pattern.
The interfringe distances were tuned from i = 19.3 to 44,2 μm. The recovery curves were
fitted by an exponential decay. In all experiments, we observed a pure monoexponential
recovery of fluorescence, indicating the diffusion of monodisperse objects. The fact that the
diffusion was Brownian was verified by obtaining a linear variation of the characteristic
recovery times τ plotted versus i2, and the D value was deduced from the slope of the linear
regression following this equation: D = i2/4π2τ. The diffusion coefficients were measured with
an accuracy of 10%. Experiments were performed at room temperature.
FRAP in cellular environment
COS-7 cells were seeded into four wells borosilicate Labtek chambers (Costar-Corning, NY,
USA) 48 h and transfected 24 h before the FRAP experiments. Confocal imaging was
performed on live cells with a Leica SP5 microscope using a 488-nm laser beam and the filter
sets supplied by the manufacturer. The cells were maintained at 37 °C on the microscope
stage and FRAP experiments we performed in a similar manner as for the GUVs using three
different circular bleached regions with diameters of 3, 4, or 5 µm.
Peptide crosslinking and electrophoresis
Peptide crosslink in detergent was performed as previously described (Jenei et al, 2009).
Briefly cross-linking reactions were carried out for 0.4 mg/ml solutions of the SCR24 or
TM24 peptide dissolved in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles (DPC/peptide = 0.1). All
samples were prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mM NaCl (pH 8).
Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]-suberate (BS3, Pierce, 1.9 mM final) was used to cross-link the
peptide according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cross-linking reaction was stopped after
30 min by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and
revealed by staining with silver nitrate.
Circular dichroism
Far UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter
operated at room temperature according to published protocols (Jamin & Lacapere, 2007).
Briefly, a peptide sample (5 µM) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution without or with
30% TFE (TriFluoroEthanol) and 80 mM SDS or DPC was placed in a 0.2 mm path length
quartz cuvette (Hellma, France). CD spectra were recorded in the 185 to 270 nm wavelength
range with a 0.2 nm step resolution, 1 s signal averaging time and 1 nm bandwidth. Spectra
were averaged over five scans, corrected for background and smoothed over 25 points. A

consensus secondary structure content was estimated by spectral deconvolution using
CONTINLL, CDSSTR and Selcon software and data sets of reference proteins SMP50 (37
soluble proteins and 13 membrane proteins) and SP37 (37 soluble proteins) (Sreerama &
Woody, 2000), as well as CDFriend.
NMR
TM24 was dissolved at 1 mM concentration in 550 μL of H2O/D2O (90:10 v/v) containing
80 mM DPC. NMR experiments were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz
spectrometer equipped with a TCI 1H/13C/15N cryoprobe. A double pulsed field gradient spinecho was applied by using band-selective shaped pulses (90° G4 pulse of 4 ms, 180° Reburp
pulse of 3 ms) centered on the amide/aromatic region so as to eliminate large 1H signals
arising from non-deuterated detergent in the acquisition dimension. NMR spectra were
processed with TopSpin 3.2 software (Bruker) and analysed with NMRFAM-SPARKY
program (Lee et al, 2015). 1H resonances were assigned (Table EV1) using 2D 1H-1H TOCSY
(DIPSI-2 mixing time of 68 ms) and 2D 1H-1H NOESY (150 ms mixing time) recorded at
40°C. The chemical shift deviations of 1H were calculated as the differences between
observed chemical shifts and random coil values reported in water (Wishart et al, 1995). 188
inter-proton distance restraints (71 intraresidual, 85 sequential, 32 medium-range) were
derived from NOESY cross-peak intensities and 43 dihedral angle restraints (22 , 21 ) were
obtained from the analysis of 1H CSDs. Structures were calculated using Amber 14 program
(Case et al, 2014) and ff14SB force field (Maier et al, 2015), as described (Byrne et al, 2019).
Molecular dynamics
Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the MARTINI
force field for lipids (Marrink et al, 2007) and proteins (Monticelli et al, 2008). Both
electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated using a 1.2-nm cutoff with a
switch function. The neighbor list was updated every 20 steps and the relative dielectric
constant for the medium was set to 15. The temperature for each group (peptide, lipid, water)
was kept at 303.15 K using the v-rescale temperature coupling algorithm (Bussi et al, 2007)
with a time constant of 1 ps. The pressure was kept constant using the Parrinello-Rahman
algorithm (Parrinello & Rahman, 1981) with a semiisotropic pressure coupling (x and y
dimensions, the bilayer plane, coupled independently from the z dimension) and a time
constant of 12 ps. The integration time step was 20 fs and structures were saved every 100 ps
for analysis.
Three boxes containing 9, 9 and 16 TM24 at lipid ratio 1:100, 1:50 and 1:100 (respectively)
were constructed (Box1, Box2 and Box3) using CHARMM-GUI (Jo et al, 2008; Qi et al,
2015). At the beginning, we placed one TM24 (using the best NMR structure) in a vertical
position within a bilayer of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (of 100 lipids for Box1 and
Box3 and 50 lipids for Box2. The system was hydrated with slightly more than ten times
more water beads compared to the number of lipids (corresponding to an effective water to
lipid ratio of 1:40, one water bead corresponds to 4 water molecules). We also added Na+ / Clion beads to get an ion concentration of ~150 mM and keep the system neutral. This system
was energy minimized and equilibrated to pack the lipids on the peptide (using position
restraints on the latter). Then, the system was replicated 3 times (for Box1 and Box2) or 4
times (for Box3) on the x and y directions using the genconf program from the GROMACS
package. After a minimization and an equilibration of 10 ns (with position restraints on the
peptide), production simulations were run for 10 s for each Box. All simulations were
carried out using GROMACS 2018.5 (Abraham et al, 2015).

Stokes radius of a linear oligomer
To our knowledge, there is no model for the 2D-hydrodynamic radius (Stokes radius) of
linearly aligned transmembrane domains in a membrane. Qualitatively, a compact disc-like
structure will have a smaller 2D-hydrodynamic radius than an elongated rectangle with the
same area. To have a more quantitative insight, we propose to model the linear arrangement
of nr CX3CL1 as an elongated rectangle with √𝑎 as a width and nr√𝑎 as a length; a is the area
occupied by a transmembrane domain. The stokes radius can be estimated by the average
projection of the rectangle in all directions: (nr + 1)a/.
In a cellular context, we found TM24 diffuses as fast as CX3CR1 that has seven
transmembrane domains. Assuming the arrangement of CX3CR1 transmembrane domains has
a disk-shape, the 2D-hydrodynamic radius is √7𝑎⁄𝜋. Hence, the number of CX3CL1 in a
linear arrangement with the same 2D-hydrodynamic radius would be nr ~ 4.
Calcium flux assay
A cytosolic-free calcium assay was measured by fluorescent detection using CalbryteTM520AM (AAT Bioquest, Interchim, Montluçon, France), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, CHO-CX3CR1 cells were plated overnight (4x104 cells per well) in
black 96-well microplate with clear bottom (Greiner, Dutscher, Brumath, France) at 37 °C,
5% CO2. Then the cells are loaded for 45 min at 37 °C with a solution containing 0.04%
pluronic acid (Interchim), 10 µM CalbryteTM520 AM and 1 mM probenecid (Interchim) in
working buffer called HHBSS (Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution supplemented with 10 mM
Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.2). After washing, the cells were treated with
control buffer or TM24 peptide and then with soluble CX3CL1 (Chemokine Domain) at the
appropriate concentrations. Signal was measured as a function of time on a fluorescent plate
reader equipped with fluidic handling (FlexStation 3; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) and quantified by SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices). The signal of each well
was normalized using the maximum obtained after addition of ionomycin (Interchim) and the
minimum obtained after addition of EGTA.
Cellular adherence assay using LigandTracerTM
The day before the experiment, 5x105 L929 or LCX3CL1 cells were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes
(Cellstar Greiner, Dutscher, Brumath, France). After washing, a volume of 900 µL of HHBSS
was kept in each dish. Four of such dishes were inserted in an 87-89 mm cell dish, and the
whole setup was placed on the tilted and rotating support of the LigandTracer instrument
(Ridgewiew, Vänge, Sweden) equipped with the 488/535 detector. The fluorescence intensity
in the elevated area - i.e. the area without liquid- was repeatedly measured (Bondza et al,
2017; Hillerdal et al, 2016; Xu et al, 2013). First, the base line recording was obtained in the
four-spots setting, where each spot was read during 15 s. After 20 min, the instrument was
paused and the various peptides (TM24 or SCR24) or anti-CX3CL1 antibody were added at
the appropriate concentration. Then 5x105 CHOCX3CR1 cells previously labeled with CFSE
(5(6)carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester, Thermofisher Scientific, Villebon-surYvette, France) resuspended in 100µL of HHBSS were added in each cell dish. Then,
fluorescence trace of each spot was recorded. Each experiment included control adherence
experiments on L929 or LCX3CL1 cells without peptide or antibody.
CX3CL1 binding assay using LigandTracerTM
The procedure was the same as the previous one, except that the day before the experiment,
5x105 CHOCX3CR1 cells were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes and that the LigandTracer

instrument was equipped with the 632/670 detector. When the instrument was paused, we
added 100 µL containing the fluorescent CX3CL1-AF647R (Almac, Craigavon, IK) and
various peptides or chemokines at the appropriate concentration.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean and standard deviations of replicates as indicated in the legend
of Figs. Analysis of statistical significance were done by Student’s unpaired two-sided t-test.
All statistical analysis were performed using Prism 5.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
USA). The levels of significance were indicated as following: *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.005; ***p
≤ 0.0005; not significant (ns): p > 0.05.

Diffusion rate of CX3CL1 transmembrane peptides analyzed by FRAP and
FRAPP
A. The fluorescence kinetics of Giant Unilammelar Vesicles containing either TM24FITC (filled squares) or SC24-FITC (empty squares) was analyzed after bleaching by
circles on various diameter (1, 2, 5 and 10 µm). The recovery constant time was
reported versus the bleached area. Each measurement was the mean of triplicates. The
slopes of the linear fit are 2.63 and 29.93 for TM24 and SCR24 respectively.
B. The diffusion rates were calculated based on the mean±SEM of the 12 measurements
data used to give the Fig A.
C. The fluorescence kinetics of lipidic cubic “sponge” phase containing either TM24FITC (filled squares) or SC24-FITC (empty squares) was analyzed after bleaching by
interference pattern with various interfringe (20, 27, 46 and 58 µm). The recovery
constant time was reported versus the interfringe distance. Each measurement is the
mean of triplicates. The slopes of the linear fit are 252 ± 10 and 1093 ± 144 for TM24
and SCR24 respectively.
D. The diffusion rate were calculated based on the mean±SEM of the 12 measurements
data used to give the Fig C. Note that the diffusion rate appeared dramatically higher
in sponge phase since the fluorescent molecules could move in tridimensional milieu.

TM24
A. Real time adherence of CHOCX3CR1 cells to L929 (dashed traces) or LCX3CL1 cells (solid
traces) as assayed by the LigandTracerTM technique, in the presence of 5µM TM24
(red traces), 5µM SCR24 (blue traces) or none (black traces). The data were
normalized using the control trace with LCX3CL1 cells in the absence of peptide (100%
after 60 minutes). The curves are the mean of three independent experiments.
B. Specific adherence of CHOCX3CR1 cells to LCX3CL1 cells using data of Fig 7A. The data
obtained with LCX3CL1 cells were subtracted from data obtained with L929 and
normalized at 100% at the 60 minutes time. The bars in the right of the Fig shows the
specific adherence after 60 minutes (mean of triplicates±SD) in the presence of 5µM
TM24 (red) and 5µM SCR24 (blue).
C. Real time binding of 100nM of fluorescent CX3CL1 to coated CHOCX3CR1 cells using
the LigandTracerTM technique, in the presence of 5µM TM24 (red trace), 1µM
unstained CX3CL1 (dashed trace) or none (black trace). The data were normalized
using the control trace without peptide (100% after 60 minutes).
D. Specific adherence of CHOCX3CR1 cells to LCX3CL1 cells after 60 minutes in the
presence of various TM24 peptide concentrations and in the presence (filled squares)
or in absence (empty squares) of 1µg/ml of anti-CX3CL1 antibody. The data were
calculated and normalized as in Fig 7B. Experiments are performed in duplicate
except for the 1µM TM24 concentration done in triplicates (mean±SD).
