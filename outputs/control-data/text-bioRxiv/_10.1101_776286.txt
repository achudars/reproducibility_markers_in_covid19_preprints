Abstract

16

The Dobzhansky-Muller model provides a widely accepted mechanism for the evolution of reproductive

17

isolation: incompatible substitutions disrupt interactions between genes. To date, few candidate

18

incompatibility genes have been identified, leaving the genes driving speciation mostly uncharacterized.

19

The importance of interactions in the Dobzhansky-Muller model suggests that gene coexpression networks

20

provide a powerful framework to understand disrupted pathways associated with postzygotic isolation.

21

Here, we perform Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to infer gene interactions in

22

hybrids of two recently diverged European house mouse subspecies, Mus mus domesticus and M. m.

23

musculus, which commonly show hybrid male sterility or subfertility. We use genome-wide testis

24

expression data from 467 hybrid mice from two mapping populations: F2s from a laboratory cross between

25

wild-derived pure subspecies strains and offspring of natural hybrids captured in the Central Europe hybrid

26

zone. This large data set enabled us to build a robust consensus network using hybrid males with fertile

27

phenotypes. We identify several expression modules, or groups of coexpressed genes, that are disrupted

28

in subfertile hybrids, including modules functionally enriched for spermatogenesis, cilium and sperm

29

flagellum organization, chromosome organization and DNA repair, and including genes expressed in

30

spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. Our network-based approach enabled us to hone in on

31

specific hub genes likely to be influencing module-wide gene expression and hence potentially driving

32

Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. A total of 69 (24.6%) of these genes lie in sterility loci identified

33

previously in these mapping populations, and represent promising candidate barrier genes and targets for

34

future functional analysis.

Introduction
According to the classic Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) model of speciation, mutations that accumulate

37

independently and in different genomic regions may be incompatible when brought together in a hybrid

38

background, resulting in disrupted epistasis and the development of postzygotic reproductive barriers

39

(Dobzhansky 1982; Muller, 1942). These barriers, which include reductions in hybrid fertility and/or hybrid

40

viability, in turn restrict gene flow, enabling the further divergence of incipient species. The applicability of

41

the DM model to allopatric speciation scenarios has been demonstrated through both theoretical and

42

empirical studies (reviewed in Presgraves, 2010). However, while many genes and loci influencing hybrid

43

fertility have been described (reviewed in Maheshwari and Barbash, 2011), characterizing the specific

44

interactions between loci underpinning Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) remains a challenge.

45

While DMIs were originally assumed to act independently of one another, such that individual loci

46

are involved in a single DMI (Orr, 1995), accumulating evidence raises questions about this assumption. A

47

computational modeling study based on RNA folding demonstrated that as two populations evolve in

48

allopatry, DMIs become increasingly complex over time (Kalirad and Azevedo, 2017). In this context, the

49

majority of DMIs could involve more than two loci and individual loci are expected to participate in multiple

50

DMIs (Kalirad and Azevedo, 2017). Evidence from empirical studies in house mice (Turner et al. 2014;

51

Turner and Harr 2014), Drosophila (Phadnis et al. 2011), as well as plant and fungal taxa, supports the

52

prevalence of complex DMIs involving multiple partners (reviewed in Fraïse et al. 2014). Theoretical

53

studies have also implicated the role of divergence in complex regulatory pathways in driving postzygotic

54

reproductive isolation via DMIs, with reproductive isolation being more likely to develop when regulatory

55

pathways contain larger numbers of loci (Johnson and Porter, 2000) and are under the influence of

56

directional selection (Porter and Johnson, 2002; Johnson and Porter, 2007). Empirical evidence from

57

house mice suggests that divergence in regulatory elements between subspecies disrupts epistatic

58

interactions between sets of genes, resulting in significant reductions or elevations of gene expression in

59

hybrid relative to pure subspecies individuals (Mack et al. 2016).

60

Misexpression in hybrid individuals is commonly observed, and has been associated with reduced

61

fertility in house mice (Good et al. 2010; Turner et al. 2014; Turner and Harr 2014; Mack et al. 2016;

62

Larson et al. 2017), Drosophila (Michalak and Noor, 2003; Moehring et al. 2006; Gomes and Civetta,

63

2015), and cats (Davis et al. 2015). Understanding the role of potentially complex DMIs in driving patterns

64

of misexpression may be facilitated by exploring gene interactions in a network context, in which

65

expression patterns of sets of genes are allowed to depend upon one another. Network-based approaches

66

cluster genes into coexpression modules, which are likely to be associated with common biological

67

pathways and functions (e.g. Ayroles et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2010; reviewed in Mackay, 2014), and have

68

been employed to identify sets of genes associated with fitness-related phenotypes (e.g. Jumbo-Lucioni et

69

al. 2010; Mack et al. 2018) and genes with disrupted interactions associated with disease (e.g. Saris et al.

70

2009; Miller et al. 2010; reviewed in de la Fuente, 2010). Identifying the most highly-connected “hub genes”

71

within modules can facilitate identification of changes driving disruption of pathways from downstream

72

misexpressed genes. Network approaches have also been used to identify mechanisms involved in

73

adaptive ecological divergence (e.g. Kelley et al. 2016; Gould et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2019), and to explore

74

the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation of sympatric lake whitefish ecotypes (Filteau et al. 2013).

75

However, the power of network-based analyses for exploring the disrupted gene interactions associated

76

with reduced hybrid fertility and postzygotic reproductive isolation is yet to be realized.

77

Because mutations and incompatibilities continue to accumulate between independently evolving

78

lineages over time, identifying the incompatibilities that initially caused reproductive isolation requires

79

studying recently diverged lineages, with incomplete reproductive barriers. The European house mouse

80

(Mus musculus) provides one such system. Three subspecies, M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus and M.

81

m. castaneus, diverged approximately 500,000 years ago (Geraldes et al. 2011). Following this initial

82

divergence, M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus (henceforth referred to as musculus and domesticus,

83

respectively) used different routes to colonize Europe, providing the opportunity for the accumulation of

84

DMIs in allopatry. Laboratory crosses between musculus and domesticus have demonstrated reduced

85

fertility in hybrid males (Forejt and Iványi, 1974; Oka et al. 2004; Good et al. 2008a), although the degree

86

of sterility varies depending on the nature of the cross (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Vyskočilová et al.

87

2005; Good et al. 2008b; Larson et al. 2018). Genetic studies of musculus-domesticus hybrids have also

88

led to the first characterization of a mammalian hybrid incompatibility gene, Prdm9 (Mihola et al. 2009), an

89

autosomal histone methyltransferase which binds DNA at recombination hotspots and plays an important

90

role in the initiation of meiotic recombination (Baudat et al. 2010; Davies et al. 2016). Negative interactions

91

between some domesticus Prdm9 alleles and loci on the musculus X-chromosome disrupt expression of

92

the X-chromosome and chromosome synapsis, resulting in meiotic arrest (Bhattacharyya et al. 2013;

93

Campbell et al. 2013; Bhattacharyya et al. 2014; Larson et al. 2017).

94

Following colonization of Europe, musculus and domesticus expanded their ranges to form a zone of

95

secondary contact traversing Central Europe (Macholan et al. 2003; Janoušek et al. 2012). Hybridization

96

along this secondary contact zone is common, resulting in a cline of genomic admixture (Payseur et al.

97

2004; Macholan et al. 2007; Teeter et al. 2008; Janoušek et al. 2012). Reduced male fertility is frequent in

98

wild-caught hybrids, but complete sterility is rare (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Albrechtová et al. 2012;

99

Turner et al. 2012), suggesting that this postzygotic barrier reduces gene flow and contributes to

100

maintenance of the subspecies boundary, but is incomplete and variable in strength across populations.

101

In the present study, we are building on genetic mapping of fertility phenotypes & gene expression

102

traits in F2 musculus-domesticus hybrids generated through a laboratory cross (White et al. 2011; Turner et

103

al. 2014), and in offspring of wild-caught musculus-domesticus hybrids (Turner and Harr 2014), which have

104

identified many autosomal and X-linked sterility loci. DMIs were mapped in both studies, using different

105

methods, yet many loci and interactions are shared between mapping populations (Turner and Harr 2014).

106

Most loci have multiple interaction partners, supporting the presence of complex DMIs (Turner and Harr

107

2014; Turner et al. 2014). Identifying the underlying mechanisms and causative genes remains a

108

challenge, because many loci encompass a large number of genes.

109

Here, we characterize disruptions in gene networks associated with hybrid male sterility in mice, by

110

analyzing patterns of gene coexpression using microarray data from a total of 467 mice from two

111

musculus-domesticus hybrid mapping populations (Turner and Harr 2014; Turner et al.

112

2014). We use weighted gene coexpression analysis (WGCNA, Langfelder and Horvarth, 2008) to (1)

113

characterize a consensus ‘fertile’ network, (2) identify modules of coexpressed genes associated with

114

biological pathways and processes, (3) identify modules disrupted in subfertile hybrids, and (4) identify

115

specific candidate genes likely to be driving network disruptions in subfertile hybrids.

116

Results

117

Concordant genome-wide testis expression patterns in F2 and HZ hybrids

118

We analyzed genome-wide expression patterns in testes from 295 F2 hybrids between two inbred

119

strains of musculus and domesticus (White et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2014) and 172 lab-bred male offspring

120

of mice wild-caught from a hybrid zone (Turner and Harr 2014). Principal components analysis (PCA) of

121

the F2 and Hybrid Zone (HZ) data sets showed similar overall patterns (Supplementary Figure 1). For both

122

populations, PC1, which explains 20.1% of variation in F2 hybrids and 27.8% of variation in HZ hybrids, is

123

clearly associated with fertility classified on the basis of relative testis weight (testis weight/body weight)

124

and sperm count (White et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2012; Supplementary Figure 1A-B). The PC1 loadings for

125

25,146 probes in the two datasets are strikingly highly correlated (r=0.91, p<2.2x10-16), suggesting a

126

common set of genes contribute to the “sterile” expression pattern (Supplementary Figure 1C). The

127

remarkable similarities in overall testis expression pattern between mapping populations, and previous

128

evidence for shared incompatibilities (Turner and Harr 2014), motivated us to combine expression data

129

from F2 and HZ hybrids to characterize gene network disruptions associated with sterility.

130

After combining and batch-correcting data from F2 and HZ hybrid and pure subspecies males, PC1

131

explains 18.26% of variation in gene expression and again is clearly associated with fertility (Figure 1). The

132

PC1 scores of fertile hybrid and pure subspecies males show similar levels of variation (variance: 609.36

133

and 616.10, respectively), while variation in PC1 scores is considerably higher in hybrids with subfertile

134

phenotypes (variance: 15149.70). Hybrids for which both fertility phenotypes fall within the pure subspecies

135

range, yet at least one of the phenotypes is more than one standard deviation from the pure subspecies

136

mean, were classified as “intermediate phenotype (see Methods) and show intermediate levels of variation

137

along PC1 (variance: 1816.78).

138

A sizeable proportion (33.5%) of the subfertile hybrids have PC1 scores that exceed the fertile hybrid

139

and pure subspecies range (Figure 1); we classified these individuals as “Subfertile Aberrant Expression”

140

(SFAE), and classified subfertile hybrids that cluster with fertile hybrids and pure subspecies males along

141

PC1 as “Subfertile Normal Expression” (SFNE). A total of 69 F2 and 38 HZ hybrids were categorized as

142

SFNE, while 37 F2 and 17 HZ hybrids were categorized as SFAE (Figure 1). PC3, which explains 4.28% of

143

variation, is associated with subspecies ancestry: musculus individuals have high scores, domesticus

144

individuals have low scores, and hybrids have intermediate scores (Supplementary Figure 2).

145
146

Fertile hybrid consensus network
To identify potentially interacting sets of genes that are coexpressed in fertile hybrids from different

147

genomic backgrounds, we constructed a consensus fertile network using expression data from the fertile F2

148

(n=102) and HZ (n=79) hybrids and 18,411 probes representing 10,171 genes (see Methods for details). A

149

total of 14,346 probes, representing 7,989 unique genes, were assigned to one of 15 co-expression

150

modules (Figure 2A; Supplementary Data 1); 4,065 probes could not be assigned to a module and are

151

shown in the grey, ‘bin’ module. Thirteen modules are significantly enriched for specific functions on the

152

basis of gene ontology analysis, of which seven were significantly enriched for spermatogenesis or

153

potentially related functions (Table 1, Supplementary Data 2). The module eigengene (ME), which

154

describes the overall expression level of each module across the full dataset of fertile and subfertile

155

hybrids, was significantly positively correlated with both sperm count and relative testis weight for three

156

modules, and significantly positively correlated with relative testis weight alone for an additional three

157

modules (Figure 2B). Four modules have an ME which is significantly negatively correlated with both

158

sterility phenotypes, while the ME of one additional module is significantly negatively correlated with

159

relative testis weight alone. Of the seven modules that are significantly enriched for spermatogenesis or

160

potentially related functions, two (Brown and Tan) have an ME which is significantly positively correlated

161

with at least one of the fertility phenotypes, while two (Green and Pink) have an ME which is significantly

162

negatively correlated with at least one of the fertility phenotypes (Figure 2B). These correlations indicate

163

that the inferred modules of coexpression are informative about fertility.

164

Network preservation in subfertile hybrids

165

To determine whether coexpression networks are disrupted in subfertile hybrids, we estimated

166

module preservation using two approaches based on a set of metrics developed by Langfelder et al. (2011;

167

see Methods). Figure 3A shows the estimated preservation of each module from the consensus fertile

168

network in F2 and HZ hybrids with subfertile phenotypes and either aberrant or normal overall expression

169

patterns. Module preservation was assessed independently for F2 and HZ hybrids, because the presence

170

and prevalence of specific DMIs and associated network disruptions may vary between mapping

171

populations. Modules showing significant evidence for preservation in subfertile hybrids are represented by

172

circles, while modules showing a lack of significant preservation are represented by squares (Figure 3A).

173

Figure 3B and 3C illustrate coexpression patterns within a well-preserved (Red) versus a poorly-preserved

174

(Brown) module in the F2 SFAE hybrids. Pairwise coexpression in the Red module is characterized by

175

strong positive correlations (Figure 3B). In contrast, many pairwise expression correlations in the Brown

176

module are weakened or even reversed in direction (Figure 3C), suggesting substantial disruption in the

177

coexpression of these gene pairs.

178

The level of preservation of modules from the fertile network was similar in subfertile HZ and F2

179

hybrids. Three modules (Magenta, Red, Pink) showed strong evidence for preservation in subfertile HZ

180

hybrids (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table 1); the remaining 12 modules had either a Zsummary < 10 and/or

5

181

non-significant NetRep statistics, indicating weak or a lack of preservation (Langfelder et al., 2016; Ritchie

182

et al 2016, see Methods). In F2 hybrids, four modules (Magenta, Red, Purple and Blue) showed strong

183

evidence for preservation in subfertile mice.

184

As expected, module preservation was much higher in subfertile hybrids with normal expression

185

based on PC1 (SFNE); all modules showed strong evidence of preservation in the HZ SFNE hybrids, and

186

13 of 15 modules were strongly preserved in F2 SFNE hybrids (Greenyellow and Midnightblue modules had

187

non-significant NetRep scores; Supplementary Table 1). By contrast, preservation was lower in subfertile

188

hybrids with aberrant expression; six of 15 modules were preserved in HZ SFAE hybrids, and nine

189

modules in F2 SFAE hybrids.

190

Many modules show consistent levels of preservation across subfertile hybrid classes (Figure 3A).

191

The Red, Magenta, Purple and Turquoise modules consistently rank among the most strongly preserved

192

modules; these modules are significantly enriched for cofactor metabolic processes, histone binding and

193

chromosome organization, fatty acid metabolic processes, and synaptic membrane expression,

194

respectively (Table 1). By contrast, the Brown, Green, Yellow, Midnightblue and Greenyellow modules

195

consistently rank among the modules with the weakest preservation; these modules are significantly

196

enriched for cell projection assembly and cilium organization, DNA repair and chromosome segregation,

197

mRNA processing and spermatogenesis, and protein homooligomerization (the Greenyellow module has

198

no significant enrichments). Notably, while the Magenta and Green modules are significantly enriched for

199

similar processes (chromosome organization and segregation, respectively), the Magenta module appears

200

to be one of the best-preserved modules, while the Green module is among the least preserved across

201

hybrid groups (Figure 3A).

202

While consistencies across subfertile groups are apparent, notable differences were also detected

203

between the HZ and F2 hybrids. For example, the Blue module, enriched for spermatogenesis, is

204

significantly preserved in the F2 SFAE hybrids yet shows relatively poor preservation in the HZ SFAE

205

hybrids (Figure 3A). The Yellow module, which is also significantly enriched for spermatogenesis, is

206

amongst the least preserved modules in all subfertile hybrid groups except for the F2 SFAE, within which it

207

is relatively well preserved.

208

In summary, broad similarity of module preservation statistics across subfertile classes provides

209

further evidence that specific functions and pathways are commonly disrupted in sterile hybrids. By

210

contrast, modules showing differences in conservation in subfertile HZ vs F2 hybrids suggest some network

211

disruptions are unique to specific mapping populations.

212

Modules associated with specific stages of spermatogenesis or testis cell types

213

To determine if coexpression modules are associated with specific stages of spermatogenesis, we

214

tested for significant enrichment of genes expressed in different testis cell types, which was recently

215

determined at high resolution using a combination of single-cell RNAseq and bulk RNAseq at different time

216

points during the first stage of spermatogenesis (gene lists from Supplementary Data 2 in Ernst et al.

217

2019). The gene content of five modules (Blue, Green, Magenta, Pink and Yellow) overlaps significantly

218

with genes expressed in spermatogonia (Table 1). Six modules (Black, Blue, Brown, Green, Magenta and

219

Yellow) overlap with genes expressed in spermatocytes during stages of meiosis (early pachytene,

220

diplotene, metaphase). Five modules (Blue, Brown, Greenyellow, Salmon, Yellow) overlap with genes

221

expressed postmeiotically in at least one of the 11 stages of developing spermatids. For somatic cell types,

222

six modules (Black, Blue, Brown, Green, Magenta, Red) overlap with genes expressed in Sertoli cells and

223

three modules (Pink, Purple and Red) are enriched for genes expressed in Leydig cells. Thus, of the 15

224

modules, three overlap significantly with genes expressed during spermatogenesis only (Greenyellow,

225

Salmon and Yellow), six modules overlap significantly with both genes expressed in spermatogenesis and

226

with genes expressed in somatic cells (Black, Blue, Brown, Green, Magenta and Pink), two modules

227

overlap only with somatic cells (Purple and Red), and four modules do not overlap with genes expressed in

228

any of specific testis cell types (Cyan, Midnightblue, Tan and Turquoise). Complete lists of genes with cell

229

type-specific expression (Ernst et al. 2019) are in Supplementary Data 3. Our findings indicate that several

230

coexpression modules can be linked with one or more stages of the spermatogenesis process.

231

Modules associated with trans eQTL hotspots

232

Turner et al. (2014) identified 11 trans expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) hotspots, that is,

233

regions of the genome with significant effects on the expression of hundreds to thousands of Quantitative

234

Trait Transcripts (QTTs) in F2 hybrids, and provided several lines of evidence linking these hotspots to

235

sterility phenotypes. We investigated whether trans eQTL hotspots affected specific parts of the gene

236

coexpression network by testing for overlap between QTT associated with each hotspot and genes in

237

modules from the fertile network. Genes in seven modules overlap with QTT from 1-7 hotspots (Table 3).

238

Modules negatively correlated with relative testis weight and/or sperm count (Green, Red, Purple) overlap

239

significantly with QTT showing high expression associated with the sterile allele, as established from

240

expression patterns in sterile F1 hybrids (Turner et al. 2014), while modules positively correlated with

241

fertility phenotypes (Brown, Greenyellow, Turquoise) overlap QTT with low expression associated with the

242

sterile allele. That is, in all cases, ‘sterile’ vs. ‘fertile’ patterns were consistent between coexpression

243

modules and QTT associated with sterile vs. fertile alleles.

244

Modules with higher preservation in subfertile hybrids (Red, Purple) overlap with QTT associated with

245

multiple trans-eQTL hotspots (Table 2), highlighting potential interactions between eQTL hotspots. In

246

contrast, modules with intermediate (Black, Turquoise) or weak (Brown, Green and Greenyellow)

247

preservation in subfertile hybrids each overlap significantly with QTT associated with a single trans-eQTL

248

hotspot. In summary, five modules with intermediate or weak preservation overlap significantly with QTT

249

associated with a specific trans-eQTL hotspot, supporting an influence of the underlying sterility alleles on

250

specific parts of the fertile gene network.

253

Differentially correlated genes
Our next aim was to identify specific genes causing observed patterns of network disruption in

254

subfertile hybrids. We identified genes with significant changes in coexpression pattern in subfertile vs

255

fertile hybrids using differential correlation analysis, performed independently for each module using the

256

DGCA R package (McKenzie et al. 2016). A total of 2800 genes showed a significant loss or reversal of

257

coexpression pattern within at least one of the subfertile groups (Supplementary Data 1). The percentage

258

of differentially correlated genes varied across subfertile classes: 14.83% F2 SFNE, 11.08% F2 SFAE,

259

3.06% HZ SFNE, 2.88% HZ SFAE; note, these values are not necessarily consistent with degree of

260

sterility, because sample size is smaller for HZ vs. F2 hybrids, and for SFAE vs. SFNE hybrids. As

261

expected, a higher proportion of genes were differentially correlated in weakly preserved (28.89-46.59%)

262

vs. strongly preserved (1.12-3.65%) modules (Supplementary Table 2).

263

Module hub genes

264

We next identified hub genes in the fertile network. Hub genes are highly connected within modules,

265

and thus more likely to be associated with network disruptions. We identified 281 hub genes across the 15

266

modules on the basis of degree (number of connections) and module membership (correlation between the

267

expression of a gene and the module eigengene) (Horvath and Dong, 2008). Of the 281 hub genes, 95

268

genes within 10 modules show a significant loss or reversal of coexpression pattern in at least one of the

269

subfertile hybrid groups relative to the fertile hybrids (Table 3). Of those 94 differentially correlated hub

270

genes, 29 and 57 show a significant loss of coexpression pattern in the SFAE and SFNE F2, respectively,

271

while 11 and 10 show a significant loss of coexpression pattern the SFAE and SFNE HZ, respectively

272

(Supplementary Data 4). Hence, although the WGCNA and NetRep analyses show evidence for stronger

273

module preservation in SFNE relative to SFAE hybrids, differential correlation analysis shows evidence for

274

the disruption of module hub gene interactions in both the SFAE and SFNE hybrid groups.

275

Table 3 lists the module hub genes, indicating the following as potential candidates for DMIs: genes

276

with different coexpression patterns in subfertile relative to fertile hybrids (n=95); genes that have been

277

found to be expressed within spermatogonia, spermatocytes or spermatids (Ernst et al. 2019) (n=152);

278

genes with GOs including those related to the regulation of gene expression and/or male fertility (n=52);

279

genes that fall within previously identified trans eQTL hotspots (Turner et al. 2014) (n=40); genes within

280

sterility loci identified by GWAS in HZ mice (Turner and Harr 2014) (n=31).

281

All hub genes in the Brown module are differentially correlated in at least one subfertile hybrid group

282

relative to fertile hybrids. Figure 4 illustrates the widespread loss of connectivity within the SFAE relative to

283

the fertile F2 network. The loss of interactions for four of the module hub genes, Prkcd, Dbnl, Ptdss2 and

284

Fkbp4, are shown in Figure 4A, and the overall pattern of reduced connectivity in the SFAE network is

285

shown in Figure 4B. Several genes that interact with module hub genes in the fertile hybrid network,

286

including Spata18, Ttll5, Gli2, Sept2 and Adcy3, have Cell Component (CC) GOs that include cilium and/or

287

sperm flagellum (Figure 4A), which is of note since the Brown module is significantly enriched for genes

288

involved in cilium organization (Table 1).

289

We found some hub genes in significantly preserved modules that nevertheless show disrupted

290

coexpression patterns in subfertile hybrids. For example, the Blue module is significantly preserved in the

291

SFAE F2 hybrid group (Figure 3), however several hub genes show significant loss of interactions in SFAE

292

F2 hybrids, including Hk1, Akap1, Agpat6 and Slain2 (Table 3; Supplementary Figure 3A; Supplementary

293

Data 4). The Blue module coexpression heatmaps for fertile and SFAE F2 hybrids (Supplementary Figure

294

3B-3C) show weakening of positive correlations in these subfertile hybrids. Meanwhile, the Midnightblue

295

module was preserved in SFNE HZ hybrids, despite showing a lack of preservation in all other subfertile

296

groups (Figure 3). However, two hub genes in this module have changes in interactions in both SFNE and

297

SFAE HZ hybrids (Figure 5A). Moreover, an intermediate level of reduced connectivity overall in SFNE HZ

298

hybrids in the Midnightblue module is apparent from visual comparison of the coexpression heatmap of the

299

module compared to fertile hybrids and the more severely disrupted SFAE hybrids (Figure 5B-D).

300

Discussion

301

While the Dobzhansky-Muller model provides a well-accepted mechanism for the development of

302

reproductive isolation between diverging lineages, the specific epistatic interactions underlying DMIs

303

remain mostly uncharacterized. A network approach is ideal for identifying complex DMIs, since pairwise

304

interactions between genes are likely to be non-independent. Here, using hybrids of two house-mouse

305

subspecies between which reproductive barriers are incomplete (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005; Albrechtová

306

et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2012), we take a network-based approach to characterize gene interactions in

307

testis of fertile vs. subfertile males from two hybrid mapping populations. Combining testis expression data

308

from an F2 cross between wild-derived inbred strains (Turner et al. 2014) and offspring of mice wild-caught

309

from a hybrid zone (Turner and Harr 2014) enabled us to generate a consensus fertile network and identify

310

modules of genes that are commonly coexpressed. We identified disruptions in this network in subfertile

311

hybrids at the module and gene level, some of which are associated with specific functions, stages of

312

spermatogenesis, or testis cell types. Integrating our results with previous mapping of subfertility

313

phenotypes and gene expression traits in the same mice (White et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2014; Turner and

314

Harr 2014) reveals candidate pathways and genes for subfertility.

315

Network disruptions in subfertile hybrids

316

Several modules show consistent patterns of poor preservation in subfertile hybrids within both the F2

317

and HZ mapping populations, including modules enriched for cilium organization and the sperm flagellum

318

(Brown), spermatogenesis and the regulation of cell cycle (Blue and Yellow), DNA repair and chromosome

319

segregation (Green). The disrupted modules are enriched for genes expressed in spermatogonia (Blue,

320

Green and Yellow), spermatocytes (Blue, Brown, Green and Yellow) and spermatids (Blue, Brown,

321

Greenyellow and Yellow). Hence, our findings suggest that multiple stages of spermatogenesis are

322

impacted by DMIs in both natural and laboratory-bred hybrid mice. These findings are somewhat supported

323

by previous histological analyses of testis defects in the F2 hybrid mapping population, which revealed a

324

range of phenotypic defects linked to reduced fertility (Schwahn et al. 2019). While the majority of these

325

defects could be explained by a failure to complete meiosis I, so potentially implicating genes expressed in

326

primary spermatocytes, possible downstream errors in meiosis II and postmeiotic errors in spermiogenesis

327

were also implicated (Schwahn et al. 2018).

328

Although most modules enriched for functions potentially related to spermatogenesis show a lack of

329

preservation in at least one of the subfertile hybrid groups, the Magenta module is an exception. This

330

module is relatively well-preserved in all subfertile hybrid groups, despite being enriched for similar

331

processes to the poorly preserved Green module (chromosome organization) and despite being enriched

332

with genes expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. This pattern suggests that while several

333

different stages of spermatogenesis are potentially impacted by DMIs, some pathways and processes

334

remain intact.

335

Patterns of network disruption are broadly similar in the F2 and HZ mapping populations, but

336

differences are also evident. The Blue and Yellow modules, for example, showed higher levels of

337

preservation in the F2 relative to HZ subfertile hybrids, and several module hub genes showed significant

338

changes in coexpression pattern in only one of the hybrid populations. As noted above, power to detect

339

disruptions varies among subfertile classes, due to sample size, but we expect there are also true

340

biological differences, because incompatibility loci are segregating within musculus and domesticus (Good

341

et al. 2008b; Larson et al. 2018). Moreover, the HZ mapping population is more genetically and

342

phenotypically diverse (Turner et al. 2012), hence the specific genes driving network disruptions may vary

343

across hybrid populations. It is possible that severe DMIs might have been purged by selection in hybrid

344

zone, and are consequently detectable in F2 but not HZ hybrids. However, there is ongoing gene flow from

345

pure subspecies populations, and most sterility phenotypes appear to have modest fitness effects. Hence,

346

selection against incompatibilities in the hybrid zone seems unlikely to be a general pattern explaining

347

polymorphism. However, the lack of a prominent role of Prdm9 in sterility of Bavarian hybrid-zone mice is

348

consistent with this hypothesis.

349

Variation in patterns of network disruption

350

We split hybrid mice with subfertile phenotypes into two broad categories: mice with similar overall

351

patterns of gene expression to those seen in fertile hybrids (SFNE) and those with relatively aberrant

352

patterns of gene expression (SFAE). Unsurprisingly, network disruption appears more severe in the SFAE

353

hybrid groups from both the F2 and HZ populations, with fewer modules showing evidence of significant

354

preservation. However, there is evidence for more subtle network disruption in the SFNE hybrids. Two

355

modules are not preserved in the SFNE F2 hybrid group (Midnightblue and Greenyellow, Figure 3). In

356

SFNE HZ hybrids, all modules are preserved but intermediate levels of disruption are apparent upon

357

detailed examination of module-specific coexpression patterns within the Midnightblue module (Figure 5).

358

We identified more fine-scale disruptions in networks by performing differential correlation analysis,

359

which detects genes showing a significant change in coexpression pattern between groups. Genes

360

showing a significant loss or reversal of coexpression patterns were detected in both SFNE and SFAE

361

hybrid groups relative to fertile hybrids, in both the F2 and HZ mapping populations, supporting an influence

362

of subtle network disruptions in all subfertile hybrid groups. The 2800 genes with different interactions in at

363

least one subfertile group include 94 module hub genes, some of which are in relatively well-preserved

364

modules, suggesting hybrid incompatibilities can cause minor or major perturbations in gene interactions.

365

Hence, our findings support varying levels of network disruption within and among subfertile hybrid groups,

366

as expected because sterility loci are segregating within the mapping populations and putative DMIs

367

previously identified show a range of complexity and effect size (White et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2014;

368

Turner and Harr 2014).

369

Overlap with previously identified sterility regions

370

Several modules, including the Black, Brown, Green, Greenyellow, Red, Purple and Turquoise

371

modules, have gene content that overlaps significantly with QTT that are associated with a specific trans-

372

eQTL hotspot. The majority of these modules show weak (Brown, Green, Greenyellow) or intermediate

373

(Black, Turquoise) preservation in subfertile hybrids, potentially supporting a role for network disruptions

374

involving specific trans-eQTL. The Purple and Red modules, however, are well preserved across subfertile

375

hybrid groups and overlap significantly with QTT associated with multiple trans-eQTL hotspots. Unlike the

376

more weakly preserved modules, very few of the Purple and Red module genes are expressed during

377

spermatogenesis (Ernst et al. 2019), rather both modules are enriched for genes expressed in Leydig cells.

378

The overall expression of both modules is negatively correlated with both fertility phenotypes, suggesting

379

expression tends to be higher in subfertile relative to fertile hybrids. These observations are consistent with

380

previous reports that genes expressed in somatic cells in testis (i.e. Leydig, Sertoli) have relatively high

381

expression in subfertile hybrids (Turner et al. 2014), likely reflecting reduction/absence of germ cells.

382

Candidate DMI genes

383

Module hub genes, the most well-connected genes in the fertile network, are good candidates for

384

large-effect DMIs, since disrupted epistatic interactions involving these genes may have knock-on effects

385

on module-wide gene expression. We compared these module hub genes to previously identified

386

candidate DMI loci, which fall within trans-eQTL hotspots (Turner et al. 2014) and/or GWAS sterility regions

387

(Turner and Harr, 2014) and have been prioritized as candidates based on their Gene Ontology (GO)

388

categories. Module hub genes previously prioritized as candidate DMI loci include Nr2c2, Zfp711, Zfp770,

389

Hoxb6, Cry2 and Gsx1, all of which lie within trans-eQTL hotspots, and Cyp11a1, which is located within a

390

GWAS sterility locus on chromosome 9. All of these genes have GO categories that include the regulation

391

of transcription and/or spermatogenesis. The Black module hub gene Nr2c2 is of particular interest. Nr2c2

392

is expressed in mid- and late-stage pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Ernst et al. 2019; Mu

393

et al. 2004) and a lack of expression has been associated with disruptions to late meiotic prophase and

394

consequent delays to spermiogenesis (Mu et al. 2004). The transcription factors Zfp711 (Green module),

395

Zfp770 (Green module), Hoxb6 (Midnightblue module) and Gsx1 (Turquoise module) are also good

396

candidate loci for large-effect DMIs, since they show a loss of coexpression patterns in subfertile relative to

397

fertile hybrids and are hub genes within modules that show weak (Green and Midnightblue) or intermediate

398

(Turquoise) preservation in subfertile hybrids.

399

Trans-eQTL hotspots and many GWAS sterility loci each contain numerous genes (Turner et al.

400

2014; Turner and Harr, 2014), and honing in on the specific causative genes driving DMIs has been

401

challenging. Genes that lie within candidate regions but lack GOs relating to the regulation of transcription

402

and/or spermatogenesis are likely to have been overlooked. Our study identified several hub genes that lie

403

within previously identified sterility regions yet have not previously been highlighted as likely candidate DMI

404

loci. One such gene is Prkcd, a hub gene within the poorly conserved Brown module that lies within a

405

GWAS sterility region on chromosome 14 (Turner and Harr, 2014). Although this gene lacks GOs related to

406

spermatogenesis, a knockout study has reported a role for Prkcd in male fertility. Specifically, the sperm of

407

male mice lacking Prkcd expression have a reduced ability to penetrate the zona pellucida, potentially

408

impairing fertilization (Ma et al. 2015). Hk1, a hub gene within the Blue module, lies within a trans-eQTL

409

hotspot on chromosome 10 yet also lacks GOs related to spermatogenesis. This gene encodes the

410

enzyme that initiates the glycolysis pathway, which is important for sperm motility (Mori et al. 1998), hence

411

suggesting an important role in male fertility. Other genes that lie within trans-eQTL hotspots and/or GWAS

412

sterility regions yet have been overlooked as candidate DMI loci include Rapgef1 and Mapkap1, which are

413

involved in the regulation of signal transduction and establishment of actin cytoskeleton polarity,

414

respectively, Akap1, which is known to be involved in meiosis in female mice (Newhall et al. 2006), and Atr,

415

which plays a role in preventing DNA damage and is associated with reduced testis weight, abnormal DNA

416

replication and cell cycle in knockout male mice (Murga et al. 2009).

417

While several hub genes within the poorly preserved Midnightblue module lie within previously

418

identified sterility regions, only Hoxb6 has been highlighted as a candidate DMI locus. Adam28, Lcn10 and

419

Lcn9 all lie within GWAS sterility regions, and both Adam28 and Lcn9 show a loss of positive coexpression

420

patterns in subfertile relative to fertile hybrids. While all three genes lack GOs relating to spermatogenesis,

421

Adam28, Lcn9 and Lcn10 are all known to be expressed in the epididymis, and are likely to be involved in

422

male fertility (Oh et al. 2005; Suzuki et al. 2014). Although our expression data are from testis; we suspect

423

most of these genes are expressed in both tissues as testes are relatively easy to separate from

424

epididymis during dissection. In fertile hybrids the Midnightblue module hub genes are coexpressed with

425

several genes thought to be involved in sperm maturation, including Cst11 and Spag11, both of which have

426

antimicrobial activity and are thought to be important for sperm maturation in other mammal species (e.g.

427

Avellar et al. 2007; Hamil et al. 2002), and Crisp4, which is implicated in the acrosome reaction required for

428

the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (Turunen et al. 2012). Hence disrupted interactions in

429

Midnightblue module hub genes may have an impact on sperm motility and functioning.

430

Our gene network analysis is largely independent of phenotype data, hence potentially enabling us to

431

identify entirely novel candidate DMI loci. Candidate DMI genes that lie outside of previously identified

432

sterility regions include Fkbp4 and Ptdss2, which are hub genes in the poorly preserved Brown module and

433

show loss of coexpression patterns in subfertile relative to fertile hybrids. Mice lacking Ptdss2 expression

434

have reduced testis weight and can be infertile (Bergo et al. 2002), while the lack of Fkbp4 expression is

435

associated with abnormal sperm morphology (Hong et al. 2007). Helq, a differentially correlated hub gene

436

in the Turquoise module, also lies outside of previously identified sterility regions and is associated with

437

subfertile phenotypes in male mice (Adelman et al. 2013). Finally, D1Pas1 and Adam1a, both hub genes in

438

the Blue module have GOs relating to spermatogenesis and the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida,

439

respectively, yet have not been previously identified as candidates for DMI speciation genes.

440

Conclusion

441

We demonstrate widespread disruptions to gene-interaction networks in association with reduced

442

fertility in hybrid musculus-domesticus house mice. Disruptions are variable in magnitude among hybrid

443

mapping populations and appear to affect multiple stages of spermatogenesis, including chromosome

444

segregation and cell cycle, assembly of the sperm flagellum, and sperm maturation. We identify specific

445

candidate DMI genes, several of which fall within previously identified sterility loci and have been

446

previously associated with reduced fertility phenotypes in male mice.

447

Methods

448

Microarray and phenotype data

449

We used testis gene expression data from two previous studies, the first included F2 hybrid males

450

from a cross between wild-derived inbred strains of M. m. domesticus (WSB/EiJ) and M. m. musculus

451

(PWD/PhJ) (White et al 2011; Turner et al. 2014), and the second included first-generation offspring of

452

mice wild-caught in the hybrid zone (Turner and Harr 2014). Gene expression in the testis of hybrid males

453

sacrificed at a similar developmental stage (70 +/- 5 days and 9-12 weeks for F2 and HZ mice,

454

respectively) was measured using Whole Mouse Genome Microarrays (Agilent), as described in Turner et

455

al. (2014) and Turner and Harr (2014).

456

To investigate changes in gene expression networks associated with sterility, we first classified

457

individuals as ‘fertile’ vs. ‘subfertile.’ As fertility (i.e., ability to father offspring) was not directly measured in

458

F2 or HZ individuals, we used two phenotypes to categorize males as fertile or subfertile: relative testis

459

weight (testis weight/body weight) and sperm count (Turner et al. 2012; White et al. 2011). These

460

phenotypes were measured comparably in mice from both mapping populations and have been associated

461

with reduced fertility in multiple studies of musculus-domesticus hybrids (Britton-Davidian et al. 2005;

462

reviewed in Good et al. (2008), (2010)); we will henceforth refer to these traits as “sterility phenotypes”. A

463

total of 102 F2 and 79 HZ hybrid males have fertility phenotypes that fall within one standard deviation of

464

the pure subspecies mean and were categorized as “fertile”. “Subfertile” hybrids, for which one or both of

465

the sterility phenotypes fall outside of the pure subspecies range include 107 F2 and 55 HZ males. For a

13

466

total of 92 F2 and 41 HZ hybrids, both sterility phenotypes fall within the pure subspecies range yet at least

467

one of the phenotypes is more than one standard deviation from the pure subspecies mean. These hybrids

468

were categorized as “intermediate phenotype”. Finally, data was available for 32 pure subspecies males:

469

16 domesticus and 16 musculus. Eight individuals each of pure domesticus and pure musculus were

470

offspring of mice wild-caught at the edges of the hybrid zone (Turner and Harr 2014), and the remaining

471

pure subspecies males were from wild-derived inbred strains WSB/EiJ (domesticus) and PWD/PhJ

472

(musculus) inbred strains, whose expression was reported in Turner et al. (2014). In total, microarray and

473

sterility phenotype data were available for 467 hybrid and 32 pure subspecies males.

474

Microarray data processing

475

The Whole Mouse Genome Microarray (Agilent) contains 43,379 probes including 22,210 transcripts

476

from 21,326 genes. We started from raw array data from each study rather than processed expression

477

values, to ensure data sets were comparable in network analyses. Preprocessing of raw expression data

478

was performed in the R package limma (Smyth, 2005). Background correction was performed by

479

specifying the “half” setting, which resets intensities that fall below 0.5 following background subtraction to

480

0.5, and by adding an offset of 50. To identify probes with consistently low expression, the 98th percentile

481

of the expression of negative control probes was calculated and only probes that were at least 10%

482

brighter than this background expression level were retained, reducing the dataset to a total of 36,896

483

probes. The Quantile method was used to normalise expression between arrays.

484

Since the expression dataset includes data generated within different laboratories and over different

485

time periods, non-biological systematic bias or “batch effects” must be considered. We adjusted for known

486

batch effects using the empirical Bayes framework implemented via the ComBat function (Johnson et al.

487

2007). We also tried detecting and adjusting for hidden batch effects using the SVA R package (Leek and

488

Storey, 2007) and obtained similar results, with several of the detected surrogate variables clustering the

489

data by the known batches. Adjusting for the batch effect may result in losing potential heterogeneity in

490

gene expression between the F2 and HZ mapping populations. Nevertheless, this effect should be equal for

491

both fertile and subfertile phenotypes, and should therefore have minimal impacts on observed patterns of

492

network disruption in subfertile hybrids. Variation in gene expression across individuals was summarised

493

using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), as implemented using the prcomp function in R (R Core

494

Team, 2018), which uses a singular value decomposition of the centred and scaled data matrix, and

495

extreme outliers were identified visually and removed prior to downstream analyses. Batch-corrected and

496

normalised expression data has been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

497

Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis

498

We used The WGCNA R package (Langfelder and Horvarth, 2008) to identify groups of genes,

499

“modules”, showing similar patterns of expression within and across the F2 and HZ fertile hybrid groups.

500

Because network analysis is computationally intensive, we further filtered the dataset prior to network

501

construction. Specifically, the connectivity of each probe was estimated using the softConnectivity function,

14

502

which is available within the WGCNA R package (Langfelder and Horvarth, 2008) and calculates the sum

503

of the adjacency of each probe to all other probes within the dataset. The median connectivity was

504

calculated and probes with above-average connectivity within fertile hybrids were retained, resulting in a

505

final dataset of 18,411 probes representing 10,171 genes. We used the blockwiseConsensusModules

506

function to perform signed network construction and identify consensus modules across the fertile F2 and

507

HZ datasets, assigning each probe to a single module. Briefly, this process involved calculating a pairwise

508

coexpression matrix for each of the F2 and HZ fertile groups, in which coexpression is estimated using

509

Pearson correlation values. Raising the coexpression matrix to a defined soft-threshold power introduces

510

scale-free topology, in which a small proportion of nodes (hub genes) have a large number of connections

511

within the network. Such scale-free topology is thought to be a fundamental property of most biological

512

networks (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Network topology analysis was performed for a range of soft-

513

threshold values, and an optimal soft-threshold value of five was chosen as the lowest value at which

514

median connectivity reached a low plateau. The coexpression matrix was raised to this soft-threshold

515

power to create an adjacency matrix, which was then converted to a Topological Overlap Matrix (TOM).

516

The TOM describes the network interconnectivity or coexpression between each pair of genes in relation to

517

all others in the network. A consensus TOM was then used to cluster genes using average linkage

518

hierarchical clustering. A dynamic tree cutting algorithm was used to cut the clustering tree, so defining

519

consensus modules of similarly expressed genes. The deepSplit and minimum module size parameters

520

were set to 0 and 50 respectively, and the module eigengene distance threshold was set to 0.2 to merge

521

similar modules.

522

Module eigengenes are defined as the first principal component describing the expression of a given

523

module. To determine whether specific modules are more or less expressed in fertile vs. subfertile

524

individuals, Pearson correlations were computed between the eigengene of each module and each of the

525

two sterility phenotypic trait values (relative testis weight, sperm count).

526

GO enrichment analysis

527

We tested for functional enrichment within each module on the basis of gene ontology (GO) over-

528

representation analysis with Benjamini-Hochberg p-value adjustment (Boyle et al. 2004), performed using

529

the enrichGO function from the clusterProfiler R package (Yu et al. 2012). The gene universe consisted of

530

21,200 genes, established using all Entrez identification numbers (henceforth “genes”) associated with the

531

G4122F microarray (Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarray) probes via the Gene Expression Omnibus

532

entry for the platform (Edgar et al., 2002; Barrett et al. 2013). GO terms associated with more than 10 and

533

fewer than 500 genes in the gene universe were available for assignment.

534

Network preservation between fertile and low fertility hybrid groups.

535

To identify gene interactions which are present in fertile hybrids and disrupted in hybrids with low

536

fertility, we tested for preservation of modules from the fertile network in subfertile hybrids. Levels of

537

genetic variability are likely to vary between the HZ and F2 mapping populations, since the F2 hybrids were

538

created through crosses of inbred domesticus and musculus strains, whereas the HZ population was

539

created through crosses of mice caught wild in the hybrid zone. Since incompatibility loci are likely to be

540

segregating in natural domesticus and musculus populations, the presence or absence of specific sterility

541

loci is likely to differ between the mapping populations. We therefore tested for module preservation in

542

subfertile hybrids independently within the F2 and HZ populations. Because the PCA revealed a strong

543

association between the low fertility phenotype and variation along PC1 (see Results), we further split the

544

subfertile individuals into those clustering together with the fertile individuals along PC1 and those with a

545

PC1 score that falls outside of the fertile range (-91.25 – 49.33; see Figure 1). We refer to these groupings

546

as “SubFertile Normal Expression” (SFNE) and “SubFertile Aberrant Expression” (SFAE). To explore

547

whether the lack of preservation for several modules in the subfertile phenotypes was exclusive to the

548

SFAE group, we tested for module preservation between the fertile and each of the SFNE and SFAE

549

groups within the F2 and HZ populations.

550

We used the statistical frameworks implemented in the WGCNA and NetRep R packages to estimate

551

module preservation (Langfelder and Horvarth, 2008; Ritchie et al. 2016). Both of these permutation-based

552

approaches use the seven preservation metrics developed by Langfelder et al. (2011). The

553

modulePreservation function (WGCNA package, 500 permutations) was used to generate Zsummary scores,

554

which combine several preservation statistics that compare the density and pattern of connections within

555

modules and between datasets. Zsummary scores of ≥ 10, 2-10, and <2 indicate strong, weak, and a lack of

556

module preservation between datasets, respectively (Langfelder et al. 2011). Modules were ranked

557

according to their relative preservation using the median rank statistic, which is based on the Zsummary score

558

and module size (Langfelder et al. 2011).

559

In addition, we used the NetRep R package (Ritchie et al. 2016) to test the significance of all seven

560

of Langfelder’s statistics summarising the preservation of modules between test and discovery datasets. If

561

one or more of the NetRep statistics was found to be non-significant, this was considered evidence for a

562

lack of significant module preservation in subfertile hybrids. The Zsummary scores and least significant

563

NetRep statistics for each module are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

564

Differential correlation analysis.

565

Genes showing significantly different patterns of pairwise coexpression in the subfertile relative to

566

the fertile hybrids were identified using the R package DGCA (McKenzie et al. 2016). Once again,

567

differential correlation analyses were performed independently for each of the F2 and HZ populations, and

568

for each of the SFNE and SFAE hybrid groups. The median log-fold change in pairwise coexpression was

569

estimated for each gene in each of the 15 modules, and the significance of median log-fold change values

570

was estimated using 100 permutations.

571

Identification of module hub genes.

572

Two methods were used to identify hub genes. First, genes with a Module Membership (kME) ≥ 0.85

573

were identified as hub genes, where kME represents the Pearson correlation between the expression of an

individual gene and the module eigengene (Horvath and Dong, 2008). Second, connectivity statistics

575

including the average number of neighbours, which describes the average connectivity of nodes in a

576

module, and the network density, which summarises the overall module connectivity, were calculated

577

independently for fertile F2 and HZ hybrids, using Cytoscape v3.7.1 (Shannon et al. 2003). The top five

578

most connected genes within each of the F2 and HZ networks were also classified as hub genes for each

579

module.
