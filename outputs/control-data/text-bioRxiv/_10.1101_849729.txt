Abstract
The characteristics of acquiring new sequence information under dual-task situations have been
extensively studied until now. Performing such a concurrent task has often been found to affect
performance. In real life, however, we mostly perform a secondary task when the primary one is
already well-acquired. The effect of a dual-task on the ability to retrieve well-established
sequence representations remains elusive. The present study investigated whether accessing a
well-acquired probabilistic sequence knowledge is affected by a concurrent task. Participants
acquired non-adjacent regularities in an implicit probabilistic sequence learning task. After a 24hour offline period, we tested the participants on the sequence learning task under dual-task or
single-task conditions. Here we show that although the dual-task condition significantly
prolonged the overall reaction times in the primary task, the access to the previously learned
probabilistic representations remained intact. Moreover, we found an inverse relationship
between the ability to successfully retrieve sequence knowledge and the accuracy of the
secondary task, which fits in well with the hypothesis of competition between model-based and
model-free processes. Our results highlight the importance of studying the dual-task effect not
only in the learning phase but also during memory access.

Introduction
Implicit sequence learning is a fundamental function of the brain, which underlies the acquisition
of motor, cognitive and social skills. These skill-based actions, such as driving a car or doing
sports, usually become more automatic with extensive practice. In everyday life, these skills are
generally not performed in isolation but simultaneously with other actions. Therefore, the effect
of a secondary task on implicit sequence learning performance has been studied extensively in
the last few decades. Depending on the characteristics of the primary and the secondary task,
evidence for impaired (e.g. Franklin, Smallwood, Zedelius, Broadway, & Schooler, 2016;
Hemond, Brown, & Robertson, 2010; Jiménez & Vázquez, 2005; Nissen & Bullemer, 1987;
Röttger, Haider, Zhao, & Gaschler, 2017; Shanks, Rowland, & Ranger, 2005; Wierzchon,
Gaillard, Asanowicz, & Cleeremans, 2012), intact (e.g. Jiménez & Méndez, 1999; Jiménez &
Vázquez, 2005; Nemeth et al., 2011; Röttger et al., 2017; Rowland & Shanks, 2006) or even
improved performance (Hemond et al., 2010) was found during the acquisition of implicit
sequence knowledge. However, the effect of a secondary task on the retrieval of a complex,
well-established skill is rarely studied. In everyday life, we mostly perform a secondary task
when the primary one is well-learned. For example, when we are learning how to drive, our
entire attention is on the primary task, and we refrain from chatting with our co-pilot. However,
after mastering this skill, we easily engage in conversations during the primary (driving) task.
Therefore, answering the question of whether our performance is affected in such cases is crucial
for the understanding of the effects of dual-tasks on real-life performances. Here we present a
study where we test the effect of a secondary task on the retrieval of implicit sequence
knowledge.
What do we know about the effect of a dual-task condition on the retrieval of the learned
sequence? Sequence learning is typically measured by asking participants to respond to a series
of stimuli that follow a predetermined sequence order (Nissen & Bullemer, 1987). By contrasting
the performance to stimuli presented in a random order, the degree of sequence knowledge can
be measured. Using short single-task practice periods and immediate retrieval, early studies have
found impaired (Curran & Keele, 1993) or intact retrieval of sequence knowledge under dualtask conditions (Frensch, Lin, & Buchner, 1998; Shanks & Channon, 2002). The latter results
were often interpreted as the secondary task affecting only the performance measured at the time

of testing (i.e. the expression of knowledge), but not the underlying representations (Frensch et
al., 1998). Cohen and Poldrack (2008) have investigated the effect of extended dual-task
practice, and have demonstrated that the impairing effect of the dual-task decreases with
extended practice on a serial reaction time task. These results raise the possibility that sequence
learning knowledge remains intact after gaining experience on the primary task. These studies
(along with most of the previous experiments testing the effect of dual-tasking on the initial
learning) used fixed (deterministic) sequence learning tasks, the implicitness of which is
questionable (Cohen & Poldrack, 2008; Frensch et al., 1998; Robertson & Cohen, 2006). For this
reason, probabilistic sequence learning tasks are often used instead of deterministic ones. In a
typical probabilistic sequence learning task, certain sequence elements occur at a higher
frequency than others, and the participants learn to answer faster and more accurately for the
more than the less probable ones (J. H. Howard & Howard, 1997). The probabilistic learning
results in a robust knowledge (Kobor, Janacsek, Takacs, & Nemeth, 2017), and it is more likely
to find intact or impaired sequence learning during a concurrent secondary task in the initial
learning phase (Jiménez & Méndez, 1999, 2001); however, others did claim detrimental effects
(Shanks et al., 2005). An early study of Schvaneveldt and Gomez (1998) have found that
probabilistic sequence knowledge learned without a secondary task cannot be transferred to a
dual-task condition. On the contrary, transfer from dual-task learning to single-task performance
did occur, and the authors concluded that the impaired performance was due to problems in the
expression of knowledge, and not to the impaired learning itself. However, what do we know
about the effects of a secondary task after extended practice? There is a long history of studying
the dual-task effects on automatic behaviours, mostly using non-complex, choice-response tasks.
Most of the results support the claim that an already automatized behaviour is resistant to
concurrently performing a secondary task (e.g. Logan, 1979) and that the dual-task cost on
general skill learning (i.e. on the increasing speed due to practice independently from the
sequence structure) tend to decrease with extended practice (e.g. Brown & Bennett, 2002;
Hazeltine, Teague, & Ivry, 2002; Ruthruff, Johnston, & Van Selst, 2001; Ruthruff, Van Selst,
Johnston, & Remington, 2006; Van Selst, Ruthruff, & Johnston, 1999). Nevertheless, to the best
of our knowledge, no study has compared directly the accessibility of more complex, wellacquired probabilistic sequence knowledge (learned without a secondary task) between single
and dual-task testing conditions.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a concurrent secondary task on
the retrieval of implicit probabilistic sequence knowledge. So far, studies have investigated the
effect of single-task practice on immediate retrieval of the sequence knowledge. However, we do
not know whether a newly-introduced secondary task might disrupt the retrieval of a
consolidated sequence knowledge, although it resembles how we pursue dual-task situations in
everyday life. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a secondary task on the retrieval of a welllearned probabilistic sequential knowledge after extended practice, a 24-hour offline period and a
reactivation phase. First, we trained all participants on an implicit probabilistic sequence learning
task in a single-task condition. After a 24-hour offline period, participants were tested again;
however, at this stage, they performed the task with or without a stimulus-counting secondary
task. To control for the expression of knowledge vs. acquired knowledge problem (Jiménez &
Méndez, 1999; Vekony et al., 2019), we inserted probe blocks (i.e. blocks without a secondary
task for both groups) into the second session. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that
the secondary task will not limit the accessibility of the well-learned probabilistic sequence
knowledge.
Methods
Participants
The participants were selected from a pool of eighty-one participants. One participant who did
not follow the dual-task instruction in the Retrieval Phase (see Procedure section in the Methods)
was excluded from the pool. Two more participants were excluded because their age was more
than 3 standard deviation than the average of the participants. From the rest of the pool, we
selected the participants for the two groups to be matched by age, years of education,
handedness, short term and working memory performance (Table 1), the learning performance in
the first session, the level of consolidation (change between the end of the Learning Phase and
the beginning of the Retrieval Phase), and by the performance in the beginning of Retrieval
Phase (still without dual-task, see Procedure section in the Methods). By that, we were able to
make sure that the observed effects were not due to differences in demographical characteristics,
in general cognitive functions or in the level of initial learning or consolidation. The final
analysis was carried out on 68 participants (NSingle-task

participants were between 18 and 33 years of age (Mage = 22.91, SDage = 3.48). The average

years of education ranged between 10 and 20 (Myears of education = 14.66, SDyears of education = 2.36).
Handedness was measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). The
Laterality Quotient (LQ) of the sample varied between −53.85 and 100 (−100 means complete
left-handedness, 100 means complete right-handedness; MLQ = 44.79, SDLQ = 34.22). All
participants had normal or corrected to normal vision, none had a history of any neurological
and/or psychiatric disorder or reported taking any psychoactive medication at the time of the
experiment. They performed in the normal range on the Counting Span task (RNGCounting Span:
2.33-6, MCounting Span = 3.81, SDCounting Span = 0.89) and on the Digit Span task (RNGCounting Span: 59, MCounting

Alternating Serial Reaction Time task
We used the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task (J. H. Howard & Howard, 1997;
Nemeth et al., 2010). Four empty circles (300 pixels each) were presented continuously in front
of a white background arranged horizontally in the middle of a computer screen. A target
stimulus (a black drawing of a dog’s head, 300 pixels) was presented sequentially in one of the
four empty circles. Participants were asked to respond with their middle and index fingers of
both hands by pressing the button corresponding to the target position on a keyboard with four
heightened keys (Z, C, B, and M on a QWERTY keyboard), each of the four keys corresponding
to the circles in a horizontal arrangement. Participants were instructed to be as fast and as
accurate as possible in the task (Figure 1A).
The serial order of the four possible locations (coded as 1, 2, 3, and 4) in which target
stimuli could appear was determined by an eight-element probabilistic sequence. In this

sequence, every first element appeared in the same order as the task progressed, while the second
elements’ positions were randomly chosen out of the four possible locations (e.g., 2r4r3r1r;
where r indicates a random position). Thus, some combinations of three consecutive trials
(triplets) occur with a greater probability than other combinations. For example, 2_4, 4_3, 3_1,
and 1_2 (where ‘‘_” indicates any possible middle element of the triplet) would occur with high
probability because the third element (bold numbers) could be derived from the sequence (or
occasionally could be a random element as well). In contrast, 1_3 or 4_2 would occur with less
probability because they could never be obtained consisting of two consecutive sequence
elements. Therefore, the third element of a high-probability triplet is more predictable from the
first element when compared to a low-probability triplet. There were 64 possible triplets in the
task altogether (four stimuli combined for three consecutive trials). Sixteen of them were highprobability triplets, each of them occurring in approximately 4% of the trials, about five times
more often than the low-probability triplets (0.8%). Overall, high-probability triplets occur with
approximately 62.5% probability during the task, while the remaining 48 low-probability triplets
only occur with 37.5% probability (Figure 1B). As the participants practice the ASRT task, their
responses become faster and more accurate to the high-probability triplets compared to the lowprobability ones, revealing statistical learning throughout the task (J. H. Howard & Howard,
1997; Kobor et al., 2017; Song, Howard, & Howard, 2007; Unoka et al., 2017).
The ASRT task was completed in blocks, and each block contained 85 button presses (5
random elements at the beginning of the block, then the 8-element alternating sequence was
repeated 10 times). At the beginning of each block, four empty circles appeared horizontally on
the screen for 200 ms, and after that, the first target stimulus turned up. The target stimulus
remained on the screen until the first correct response. Between blocks, the participants could
rest a bit, and along with this, feedback about their performance (average RTs and accuracy)
appeared on the screen. After five blocks, a longer (5 minutes) mandatory pause was inserted.
We defined each trial as the third element of a high or low-probability triplet. Trills (e.g. 1-2-1)
and repetitions (e.g. 1-1-1) were eliminated from the analysis because participants may show
pre-existing response tendencies for these types of triplets (D. V Howard et al., 2004; Janacsek,
Borbély-Ipkovich, Nemeth, & Gonda, 2018; Takács et al., 2018; Unoka et al., 2017). The first
button presses were also excluded from the analysis (first 5 random button presses, and the 6th
and the 7th, as they cannot be evaluated as the third element of a triplet). To facilitate data

analysis and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, every five blocks were collapsed into a larger
unit of analysis.
Procedure
The experiment consisted of two sessions (Figure 1C). In the Learning Phase, participants
completed 45 blocks of ASRT (45 blocks divided into 9 units of analysis: Blocks 1-5, Blocks 610, Blocks 11-15, Blocks 16-20, Blocks 21-25, Blocks 26-30, Blocks 31-35, Blocks 36-40 and
Blocks 41-45), which is long enough to acquire a stable statistical knowledge (e.g. Vekony et al.,
2019). In the Retrieval Phase, which was held 24 hours after the Learning Phase, participants
completed 23 blocks of ASRT with the same sequence that they learned the previous day (20
blocks divided into 4 units of analysis and 3 separate blocks: Blocks 1-5, Blocks 6-10, Blocks11,
Blocks 12-16, Block 17, Blocks 18-22, Block 23). In Blocks 1-5, the instructions were
completely the same as in the previous day. This phase was included to strengthen the
knowledge acquired on the previous day and to make sure that the two groups consolidated the
knowledge to a similar level (see Supplementary Material). However, in Blocks 6-10, Blocks 1216 and Blocks 18-22, a random number of stimuli (between 40-45 out of the 85 appearing
stimuli in one block) was colored in yellow. The Dual-Task Group was instructed to count the
number of yellow dogs through the block. After the completion of the block, the participants had
to type in the number of yellow dogs they counted. The yellow-colored stimuli appeared for the
Single Task Group as well, however, they were instructed to carry on with the task without
paying particular attention to the differently colored stimuli. The performance in the secondary
task was evaluated by calculating the difference from the correct number of yellow stimuli
divided by the total number of yellow stimuli for each unit of five blocks (thus, resulting in a
percentage score of correctly counted yellow stimuli relative to the total number of yellow
stimuli). Using this measure, we were able to control for the differences in the exact number of
yellow stimuli across participants and for the fact that counting more stimuli is also considered
as bad erroneous counting. If a participant's overall differences score was over 15%, the
participant was considered not to properly follow the instructions and was excluded from the
analysis (1 participant). Two probe blocks were inserted between the 3 dual-task phases (Block
11 and Block 17), and one more probe block at the end of the session (Block 23). In these blocks,
there were no yellow stimuli for the Dual-Task, nor for the Single Task Group.

Following the ASRT task, the Inclusion-Exclusion task was administered to check
whether the participants developed conscious knowledge about the learned probabilistic
regularities (see Supplementary Materials for details).

Figure 1. The structure of the ASRT and the experiment. (A) A dog’s head appeared on one of the possible
positions. The participants’ task was to press the corresponding button as fast as possible. In the Learning Phase,
only black-and-white stimuli appeared. During the Retrieval Phase, in Blocks 6-10, 12-16 and 18-22, sometimes
yellow stimuli appeared on the screen, which the participants in the Dual-Task Group had to count, while the
participants in the Single-Task Group were told to ignore. (B) High- and low-probability triplets. Some runs of
consecutive trials (triplets) occurred with a greater probability than other elements. Every stimulus was defined as
the third element of a high- or a low-probability triplet, based on the two preceding trials. High-probability triplets
can be formed by two patterns and one random element and – although more rarely- by two random and one pattern
elements. (C) Experimental design. In the Learning Phase, both groups of participants practiced single-task ASRT
throughout 45 blocks. After 24 hours of rest, in the Retrieval Phase, participants completed 5 more blocks of singletask ASRT, and after that, 18 blocks of ASRT with or without dual-tasking (Dual Task Group and Single Task
Group, respectively). However, 3 of them were probe blocks for both groups (Block 11, 17 and 23).

Statistical analysis
To evaluate the performance in the ASRT task, we calculated the median reaction times (RTs)
and the mean accuracy scores separately for the high- and low-probability triplets in each 5

blocks in the Learning Phase (45 blocks: Blocks 1-5, Blocks 6-10, Blocks 11-15, Blocks 16-20,
Blocks 21-25, Blocks 26-30, Blocks 31-35, Blocks 36-40 and Blocks 41-45), in the Retrieval
Phase (20 blocks: Blocks 1-5, Blocks 6-10, Blocks 12-16, Blocks 18-22), and in each 3 probe
blocks in the Retrieval Phase (3 blocks: Block 11, Block 17 and Block 23). Only correct
responses were included in the RT analysis.
To test the effects of dual-tasking, we compared (1) the performance while the Dual-Task
Group performed the dual-task (test) blocks, and (2) the performance between the dual-task
phases (probe blocks). For the former, we performed a mixed-design ANOVA with Triplet
(high- vs. low-probability) and Blocks (Blocks 6-10, Blocks 12-16 and Blocks 18-22 in the
Retrieval Phase) as within-subject factors, and with Group (Dual-Task Group vs. Single-Task
Group) as a between-subject factor. For the latter, we ran a mixed-design ANOVA with Triplet
(high- vs. low-probability) and Probe block (Block 11 vs. Block 17 vs. Block 23 in the Retrieval
Phase) as within-subject factors, and with Group (Dual-Task Group vs. Single-Task Group) as a
between-subject factor. This analysis was carried out both on the RT and on the accuracy scores.
As the dual-tasking caused major differences in median RTs and average accuracy
between the two groups in the Dual-Task Blocks, we wanted to make sure that the results found
about the sequence knowledge were not due to the changes in the overall speed and accuracy
(i.e., because of the dual-task effect on the general skill learning). To this end, we performed an
additional analysis of the data with standardized scores. The corrected RT scores were calculated
by dividing the learning scores (median RTs for low-probability triplets minus median RTs for
high-probability triplets) by the average RTs of the given five blocks for each participant and for
each unit of five blocks. We standardized the accuracy scores similarly, except that here the
learning scores were defined by subtracting the accuracy for the low-probability triplets from the
accuracy for the high-probability ones. The standardized scores were compared between groups
with a mixed-design ANOVA with Block (Retrieval Phase 6-10 vs. Retrieval Phase 12-16 vs.
Retrieval Phase 18-22) as a within-subject factor, and with Group (Dual Task Group vs. Single
Task Group) as a between-subject factor. Please note that in this analysis, the dependent variable
is a difference score of the high- and low-probability triplets (i.e., learning score).
For all ANOVAs, the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon (ε) correction was used if necessary.
Corrected df values and corrected p values are reported (if applicable) along with partial eta-

squared (ηp2) as the measure of effect size. LSD (Least Significant Difference) tests were used
for pair-wise comparisons. Moreover, we conducted Bayesian ANOVAs on the learning scores
to gain statistical evidence for null-results. Bayes Factor (BF) reflects how well a model behaves
compared to the null-model. In the case of BF01, the smaller the value is, the better the model
predicts the data. The BF01 values of the null model are always 1 (containing the grand mean
only) (Jarosz & Wiley, 2014). We report the BF01 values of the best model and its BFM scores,
which contrasts the predictive value of the model against all the other models (i.e. the degree to
which the data have changed from the prior to posterior model odds) (Wagenmakers et al.,
2018). All of the frequentist analysis of the ASRT task was carried out by using IBM SPSS
Statistics 25, and the Bayesian analyses were run in JASP (version 0.10, JASP Team, 2019).
Results
Did the two groups perform equally before the dual-task phase?
As expected, both groups showed statistical learning in the Learning Phase, and the degree of
learning did not differ between groups, as reflected by RTs (see 2nd paragraph of the
Supplementary Materials) and by accuracies (see 3rd paragraph of the Supplementary Materials).
The level of consolidation proved to be similar in the two groups (see 4th and 5th paragraph of the
Supplementary Materials).
Did the two groups differ in the test blocks?
First, we wanted to find out whether the two groups performed differently in the test blocks
(when the Dual-Task Group performed the secondary task). A mixed-design ANOVA on the RT
scores with Triplet (high- vs. low-probability) x Block (Retrieval Phase Blocks 6-10 vs.
Retrieval Phase Blocks 12-16 vs. Retrieval Phase Blocks 18-22) x Group (Dual-Task Group vs.
Single-Task Group) factors revealed a significant main effect of Block (F(1.665, 109.864) =
11.004, p < 0.001, np2 = 0.143), highlighting that the RTs on average accelerated during the
Retrieval Phase. The significant main effect of Triplet (F(1, 66) = 254.192, p < 0.001, np2 =
0.794) showed that the statistical knowledge was still detectable during the test blocks. Block ×
Triplet interaction was not significant (F(2, 132) = 2.259, p = 0.108, np2 = 0.033) which means
that the degree of the statistical learning did not change throughout the test blocks. The main
effect of Group was significant (F(1, 66) = 13.107, p < 0.001, np2 = 0.166), revealing that the

average RTs were higher in the Dual-Task Group than in the Single-Task Group. This means that
completing the secondary task during the ASRT caused a general slowing down in the task. The
Block × Group interaction was significant (F(2, 132) = 23.402, p < 0.001, np2 = 0.262), signaling
that the general RT decrease was only detectable in the Dual-Task Group; the Single Task Group
did not show acceleration following the Learning Phase. Importantly, the Triplet × Group
interaction was not significant (F(1, 66) = 0.521, p = 0.473, np2 = 0.008), which means that there
was no difference between groups in terms of the degree of statistical knowledge. This lack of
difference did not change throughout the blocks, as revealed by a non-significant Block × Triplet
× Group interaction (F(2, 132) = 0.211, p = 0.810, np2 = 0.003) (Figure 2). The Bayesian mixeddesign ANOVA (containing only the Block and Group factors, as it was carried out on the
learning scores, see the Statistical analysis section) favoured the null-model (BF01 = 1, BFM =
5.044), suggesting similar level of statistical knowledge regardless of the block (Blocks 6-10 vs.
Blocks 12-16 vs. Blocks 18-22) or the group (Single-Task Group or Dual-task Group).
The Block × Triplet × Group ANOVA of the accuracy scores also revealed a significant
main effect of Block (F(2, 132) = 6.541, p = 0.002, np2 = 0.090): accuracy scores on average
became lower during the blocks of the Retrieval Phase. The significant main effect of Triplet
(F(2, 132) = 6.541, p = 0.002, np2 = 0.090) showed that statistical knowledge was observable
also during this phase. However, the interaction of these two factors was also significant (Block
× Triplet: F(2, 132) = 4.399, p = 0.014, np2 = 0.062). The post hoc test revealed that although
statistical knowledge was detectable in all units of five blocks, participants became less accurate
for low-probability triplets during the Retrieval Phase. The main effect of Group was not
significant (F(1, 66) = 2.076, p = 0.154, np2 = 0.031), meaning that the average accuracy did not
differed between groups. The Triplet × Group interaction was also not significant (F(1, 66) =
1.744, p = 0.191, np2 = 0.026), which means that the degree of statistical knowledge was not
affected by the dual-tasking. The Block × Triplet × Group interaction was also not significant
(F(2, 132) = 1.114, p = 0.331, np2 = 0.017), indicating that this lack of difference between group
was stable across the test blocks (Figure 3). The Bayesian mixed-design ANOVA (Block ×
Group) revealed that the best fitting model contained the Block factor only (BF01 = 0.422, BFM =
3.202). The other models had weaker predictive power, suggesting that the Group factor (SingleTask Group or Dual-task Group) did not ameliorate the model.

Did the two groups differ in the probe blocks?
We checked if the groups performed differently in the probe blocks inserted into the test blocks
(Block 11, Block 17 and Block 23). The Block × Triplet × Group ANOVA of the RT scores
revealed no difference of RTs between blocks (F(2, 132) = 0.205, p = 0.815, np2 = 0.003),
meaning that participants’ RTs on average remained stable across the three probe blocks. The
main effect of Triplet was found to be significant (F(1, 66) = 114.514, p < 0.001, np2 = 0.634),
revealing a stable statistical knowledge. The Block × Triplet interaction was also significant
(F(1, 66) = 4.491, p = 0.013, np2 = 0.064); however, as one probe block alone may be considered
relatively noisy (as it contains only 85 button presses) compared to the average of three blocks,
we did not consider these differences to be reliable. The main effect of Group was not significant
(F(1, 66) = 2.694, p = 0.105, np2 = 0.039), which means that the delaying effect of the dualtasking did not affect the performance on the probe blocks. Most importantly, the Triplet ×
Group interaction was not significant (F(1, 66) = 0.128, p = 0.721, np2 = 0.002), signaling a lack
of difference between groups in terms of the degree of statistical knowledge also in the inserted
probe blocks (Figure 4). The Block × Triplet × Group interaction was also not significant;
however (F(2, 132) = 1.935, p = 0.149, np2 = 0.028), again, this result is not considered reliable
because of the lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to the results on the average of three blocks
(Figure 2). The Bayesian mixed-design ANOVA revealed that the best fitting model contained
the Block factor only (BF01 = 0.411, BFM = 4.769). The other models had weaker predictive
power, suggesting that the inclusion of the Group factor (Single-Task Group or Dual-task Group)
did not ameliorate the model.
The Block × Triplet × Group ANOVA of the accuracy scores revealed no difference in
terms of the average accuracy between blocks (Block: F(2,132) = 2.027, p = 0.136, np2 = 0.030).
Again, a stable statistical knowledge was proven by the Triplet main effect (F(1, 66) = 75.822, p
< 0.001, np2 = 0.535). The non-significant Block × Triplet interaction revealed no change of
statistical knowledge during the blocks (F(1.798, 118.696) = 1.403, p = 0.250, np2 = 0.021);
however, again, this comparison may not be reliable because of the high signal-to-noise ratio.
The groups did not differ in terms of the overall accuracy (Group: F(1, 66) = 0.023, p = 0.880,
np2 < 0.001). Most importantly, the degree of statistical knowledge was similar between groups
in the probe blocks (Triplet × Group: F(1, 66) = 0.929, p = 0.339, np2 = 0.014) (Figure 5). Again,

this non-difference did not change across the blocks (Block × Triplet × Group: F(2, 132) =
0.095, p = 0.910, np2 = 0.001) (Figure 3). The Bayesian mixed-designed ANOVA showed that
the best fitting model was the null-model (BF01 = 1, BFM = 7.624), suggesting that models the
Block (Block 11 vs. Block 17 vs. Block 23) and/or the Group factor (Single-Task Group or Dualtask Group) does not predict the degree of statistical knowledge better.

stable statistical knowledge was detected in Blocks 1-5. The dual-tasking slowed down the RTs of the participants,
but the statistical knowledge remained stable even in these phases. We found similar results with standardized
scores.

Did the two groups differ in the test blocks in terms of standardized scores?
In the Block × Group ANOVA on the standardized RT learning scores the main effect of Block
was not significant (F(2, 132) = 1.386, p = 0.254, np2 = 0.021), suggesting that the learning
scores did not change during the test blocks. Importantly, consistent with the results without
correction, no group difference was found in terms of the degree of statistical learning (Group:
F(1, 66) = 1.325, p = 0.254, np2 = 0.020). This lack of difference remained stable throughout the
test blocks, as revealed by a non-significant Block × Group interaction (F(2, 132) = 0.018, p =
0.982, np2 < 0.001). Similarly to the non-standardized results, the Bayesian mixed-design
ANOVA suggested that the null-model is the best-fitting (BF01 = 1, BFM = 2.482), revealing a
similar level of statistical knowledge regardless of the block (Blocks 6-10 vs. Blocks 12-16 vs.
Blocks 18-22) or the group (Single-Task Group or Dual-task Group).
The Block × Group ANOVA on the standardized accuracy learning scores revealed a
significant main effect of Block (F(2, 132) = 4.688, p = 0.011, np2 = 0.066): the learning score of
Block 18-22 was overall higher than that of Blocks 6-10 (p = 0.008) and the Blocks 12-16 (p =
0.027). Similarly to the results of the non-standardized scores, no group differences were found
in terms of the degree of the statistical knowledge (Group: F(1, 66) = 1.678, p = 0.200, np2 =
0.025). This lack of group difference was consistent across the test blocks (Block × Group: F(2,
132) = 1.133, p = 0.325, np2 = 0.017). The Bayesian mixed-design ANOVA showed that the best
fitting model contained the Block factor only (BF01 = 0.427, BFM = 3.122). The other models had
weaker predictive power, suggesting that the Group factor (Single-Task Group or Dual-task
Group) did not result in a better model about the degree of statistical knowledge.

Was the secondary task performance associated with the statistical learning performance
in the Dual-Task Group?
The secondary task performance was evaluated by the difference between the number of
appearing target stimuli and the reported number expressed as a percentage (see Methods for
details). The mean difference was 4.98 % (SD = 4.2 %, RNG = 0.47-14.69 %). We explored for
correlations between the secondary task performance of the Dual-Task Group with the ASRT
learning scores in Blocks 6-10, Blocks 12-16 and Blocks 18-22 separately and also merged
together (RTs and accuracy). We found positive correlation between the ASRT accuracy
learning score in the last test blocks (Blocks 18-22) and the secondary task performance in Block
12-16 (r(34) = 0.457, p = 0.007), in the Blocks 18-22 (r(34) = 0.486, p = 0.004), and with the
overall secondary task performance (Blocks 6-10, Blocks 12-16 and Blocks 18-22 merged
together: r(34) = 0.402, p = 0.018). The correlation remained significant for the standardized
blocks as well (secondary task Blocks 18-22 vs. ASRT ACC learning score in Blocks 12-16:
r(34) = 0.457, p = 0.007; Block 18-22: r(34) = 0.486, p = 0.004; Overall: r(34) = 0.402, p =
0.018). It means that the worst secondary task performance (a bigger difference from the correct
response in the last part of the dual-task phase) was associated with better sequence knowledge
retrieval. No correlations were found with the RT learning scores (all p > 0.545) and correlation
was not found with the accuracy learning scores in Blocks 6-10 and Blocks 12-16 either (all p >
0.054).

blocks and the secondary task performance of Blocks 12-16 (A), Blocks 18-22 (B) and the overall secondary
task performance (C). There was a positive correlation between the learning performance in Blocks 18-22 and the
difference from the correct response in the secondary task. The thus higher level of learning was associated with
worse performance in the secondary task.

Discussion
Here we investigated the effect of a secondary task on the retrieval of a well-established implicit
sequence knowledge. Our participants practiced a sequence learning task with non-adjacent
second-order dependencies through 45 blocks to master the ability to perform the sequence.
After a 24-hour offline period, the participants were tested again on the task with or without a
concurrent stimulus-counting task. Participants who were examined under dual-task conditions
have retrieved their statistical knowledge to the same level as the participants with only singletask testing conditions. Moreover, this similarity proved to be true during blocks where both
groups retrieved their knowledge under single-task conditions. These results remained the same
even when we controlled for the differences in average RTs between groups. Moreover, the lack
of difference between groups in terms of the implicit sequence learning performance was
confirmed also by Bayesian statistical methods. Additionally, in accuracy measures, we found an
inverse relationship between the performance on the primary implicit sequence learning task and
on the secondary stimulus-counting task. It suggests that worst performance on the secondary
task is associated with increased retrieval of probabilistic sequence knowledge. Our results went
beyond previous literature by showing that well-learned, non-adjacent probabilistic sequence
knowledge is resistant to a concurrent secondary task.
Our study could have had three possible outcomes: impaired, intact, or improved retrieval
of the learned probabilities under dual-task conditions compared to single-task retrieval.
Expecting impaired performance can seem reasonable at first, as the majority of previous
literature reported deteriorating effects of a secondary task on sequence learning abilities
(Franklin et al., 2016; Hemond et al., 2010; Jiménez & Vázquez, 2005; Röttger et al., 2017;
Shanks et al., 2005; Wierzchon et al., 2012). This deteriorating effect on learning was explained
by numerous theories such as the suppression hypothesis (Frensch et al., 1998; Frensch, Wenke,
& Rünger, 1999), task integration (Schmidtke & Heuer, 1997), organizational hypothesis
(Stadler, 1995) or the response selection hypothesis (Schumacher & Schwarb, 2009). However,
other studies did reveal intact or even improved learning, especially in the case of more complex
statistical regularities (Jiménez & Méndez, 1999; Jiménez & Vázquez, 2005; Nemeth et al.,
2011; Schvaneveldt & Gomez, 1998). An important difference between our and most previous

studies is that we introduced the secondary task after a considerable amount of practice on the
primary task, and with this modification, we did not find evidence for impaired efficiency of the
retrieval of the learned information under dual-task conditions. Contrary to our results, an early
study of Schvaneveldt and Gomez (1998) have found impaired probabilistic sequence knowledge
in a dual-task condition after initial single-task learning, but not on a single-task condition after
initial dual-task learning. They have concluded that what is learned initially in single-task
situations cannot be applied to a dual-task condition. However, in their study, they tested the
transfer to dual-task conditions within one session (with less practice), while in our design, we
implemented a longer practice period, a 24-hour consolidation and a reactivation period to make
sure that the sequence is well-consolidated before the retrieval. This suggests that to acquire the
sequence knowledge to a great extent might help maintain a good level of retrieval during a
subsequent dual-task condition.
Apart from the potentially disruptive effect of the secondary task, another possible
outcome of the study was that the concurrent task will leave access to the sequence knowledge
intact. This would mean that the processes behind the sequence knowledge retrieval and the
stimulus-counting secondary task are independent from each other, similarly to how performance
becomes automatized and resistant to dual-tasking on non-complex choice-response tasks (e.g.
Brown & Bennett, 2002; Hazeltine et al., 2002; Logan, 1979; Ruthruff et al., 2001, 2006; Van
Selst et al., 1999). As knowledge becomes skill-like, it ceases to rely on the same resources. Our
main results are in line with this prospect: the degree of statistical knowledge remained the same
compared to the single task retrieval during dual-tasking, as well as in the probe blocks, where
both groups accessed their statistical knowledge without a concurrent counting task (please note
that here the sequence knowledge is the one that becomes automatized but not the perceptuomotor improvement, see below). Moreover, the lack of differences persisted even after the
normalization of the baseline scores. The fact that the sequence knowledge was comparable to
the single-task group in both phases (in the dual-task blocks and in the inserted probe blocks)
indicates that the secondary task affected neither the performance nor the competence of the
primary task (Kiss, Nemeth, & Janacsek, 2019; Vekony et al., 2019). These results are also in
harmony with previous research that found intact implicit sequence knowledge after practicing
the primary task in single-task conditions (Frensch et al., 1998; Shanks & Channon, 2002).
However, in these studies, the presentation of the dual-task blocks followed immediately the few

learning blocks, which makes it harder to draw conclusions about the long-term retrieval.
Therefore, our results extend this knowledge by providing evidence for three additional aspects.
First, the retrieval of sequence knowledge remains resistant to a concurrent task even after a 24hour offline period, which underlies the robust nature of probabilistic learning (Kobor et al.,
2017; Nemeth & Janacsek, 2011). Second, the retrieval of clearly implicit probabilistic
representations (see Supplementary Material) remain intact after extended practice. Third,
neither the competence nor the performance of a well-acquired sequence knowledge can be
disrupted by a secondary task.
The third potential outcome of the study was that the secondary task would improve the
retrieval of the memory representations of the primary sequence learning task. This possibility
would fit in well with the hypothesis of competition between the frontal-lobe mediated control
functions and the model-free processes. Several studies have detected negative correlations
between frontal functions and probabilistic statistical learning by means of behavioral and
electrophysiological measurements in healthy subjects (Filoteo, Lauritzen, & Maddox, 2010;
Tóth et al., 2017), by studying the developmental aspects of learning (Janacsek, Fiser, &
Nemeth, 2012) or populations with hypofrontality (Virag et al., 2015) by using hypnosis to
reduce frontal functions (Nemeth, Janacsek, Polner, & Kovacs, 2013), or by disrupting it with
brain stimulation techniques (Ambrus et al., 2019). Here we did not find improved performance
in the dual-task condition as would be predicted by the competition theory. However, we did find
evidence for a negative relationship between the performance on the secondary task and the
successful retrieval of the sequence knowledge. Namely, a negative relationship emerged
between the accuracy of counting the target stimuli and the difference between the high- and
low-probability triplets in the later parts of the dual-task blocks. In other words, long-lasting
dual-tasking might make the frontal-lobe exhausted, and thus the retrieval of the implicit
sequence knowledge becomes better. This explanation harmonizes with the argument that
cognitive fatigue enhances procedural sequence learning (Borragan, Slama, Destrebecqz, &
Peigneux, 2016). Most of the previous studies investigating the implicit sequence learning
performance under dual-tasking did not report the relationship between the primary and
secondary task performance (and used secondary task performance mostly as a criterion to
exclude participants who did not follow the instructions). The above-mentioned correlational
finding opens up many possible research questions regarding a potential negative relationship

between frontal functions and the successful performance on sequence learning under dual-task
conditions. Taken together, two out of three possible outcomes were supported by our data,
namely the hypothesis of independent processes and the competition. Future studies revealing
under which circumstances they are valid seems warranted.
Beyond the theoretical explanations of our results, methodological aspects can also
account for them. The ASRT task allows us to disentangle the general skill-related processes and
sequence-specific knowledge. It was not taken into account by many previous studies, which
makes it harder to reveal the underlying mechanism behind dual-task effects. In our study, the
general skill-related processes are shown by the change of the overall RTs and accuracy in time
(perceptuo-motor adaptation), while the sequence-specific knowledge is considered to be the
emergence of difference between high and low-probability triplets (statistical learning). It is
important to note that the increased overall RTs during the retrieval phase under dual-task
conditions did not reveal impaired sequence knowledge: they indicate altered general skill
retrieval on the primary task due to the dual-task constraint. The dual-task slowed down the
overall perceptuo-motor adaptation performance, which means that in this aspect, the
performance was not automatized until this point. However, the statistical knowledge that
emerged during the learning phase became robust enough to persist under dual-tasking, thus we
found a dissociation between the two processes. The dissection of the perceptuo-motor
adaptation and the statistical aspect of the learning process was also supported by the fact that
after the normalization of the baseline RTs, the lack of differences in statistical learning between
the single- and the dual-task group remained. As the development of general skill and statistical
learning might follow different trajectories (Juhasz, Nemeth, & Janacsek, 2019), this result is
crucial for stating that the sequence knowledge is the same between groups. Previous
inconsistencies in the literature might also originate from differences in the proportion of general
skill- and statistical learning-related factors of the used task. Therefore, future studies
investigating the process of sequence learning or the retrieval of the learned knowledge under
dual-task conditions could benefit from considering these aspects as potential confounding
factors.
Previous studies have tried to determine which characteristics of the secondary tasks are
crucial for disrupting the learning process, such as the correlation between the primary and the

secondary task events or the features of the required response (e.g. Röttger et al., 2017). In our
study, we chose a visual secondary task implemented in the stimuli stream, which does not break
the stimulus-response interval causing interference as tone counting tasks might do (Jiménez &
Méndez, 1999). However, we do not know if different secondary tasks involving functionally
distant cognitive processes affect the sequence retrieval to a similar extent. For example,
sentence processing has been found to impair probabilistic sequence learning, while
mathematical tasks, word processing have not revealed disruptive effect (Nemeth et al., 2011).
This result can be explained by the fact that language processing also relies on non-adjacent
dependencies, similarly to the probabilistic sequence learning task used in the study. On the
contrary, sequence learning has also been shown to be boosted when the secondary task involved
similar sequence-learning mechanisms as the primary adjacent serial reaction time task did
(Hemond et al., 2010). Therefore, studies revealing which cognitive processes can interfere with
the retrieval of sequence information and which do not, seem warranted.
In everyday life, we mostly perform a secondary task when the primary one is wellacquired. In spite of this fact, no study has investigated the effect of a secondary task in the case
of well-acquired, complex statistical regularities. With the aim of filling this gap of knowledge,
we performed a dual-task experiment after extensive practice, a 24-hour offline period and a
reactivation phase. We found evidence for intact (independent processes theory) and partially for
improved performance (competition theory) under dual-tasking. Two main conclusions can be
drawn from our study. First, we found an intact retrieval of implicit probabilistic sequence
knowledge, providing evidence that complex probabilistic representations are robust against
dual-tasking even if the general perceptuo-motoric aspect of the primary task is affected. This
might mean that complex statistical representations become resistant earlier than the perceptuomotoric processes and that we are able to correctly utilize them if we are performing a new, nonstatistical secondary task. Second, we also detected a negative relationship between more
successful retrieval and secondary task performance. This result fits in well with the competition
hypothesis of model-based and model-free processes, thus, more studies revealing the nature of
