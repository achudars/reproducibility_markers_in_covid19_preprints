ABSTRACT

16

As biodiversity declines toward the poles, high-latitude countries will contain the poleward range

17

edge of many species, potentially focusing national conservation toward range-edge populations

18

whose global conservation value remains contentious. Using the >200 vascular plants assessed

19

for protection in Canada, we ask whether national species-conservation rankings are biased

20

toward range-edge populations and supported by adequate research. Of 192 plant taxa deemed

21

at-risk in Canada, 77% were only found in Canada at the northernmost 20% or less of their

22

range. Higher threat categories had more peripheral taxa, and the mismatch between national and

23

global threat rankings was greater for peripheral vs. non-peripheral taxa. Almost half (43%) of

24

Canadian at-risk plants had not been studied in the peer-reviewed, conservation-relevant

25

literature, 57% had not been studied in Canada, and peripheral populations received even less

26

research effort than non-peripheral taxa. Only 5% of 7-9 conservation-relevant studies assessed

27

at-risk populations in the context of their geographic range—information that is critical to

28

establishing their relative conservation value. Thus, flora conservation in Canada is largely the

29

conservation of edge populations, yet edge populations themselves and the geographic context

30

that makes them unique are understudied, a research gap we must close to improve evidence-

31

based conservation.

INTRODUCTION

37

The latitudinal gradient in species diversity poses an interesting conservation dilemma for high-

38

latitude countries. As species drop out toward higher latitudes, large polar countries—

39

particularly in the northern hemisphere where landmass is greater—are likely to contain the

40

poleward range edge of many species. All else being equal, species that occur in a jurisdiction

41

only at the edge of their range (hereafter ‘peripheral species’) will occupy less area and so have

42

fewer individuals than non-peripheral species. This potentially makes peripheral species more

43

likely to be locally rare and deemed ‘at risk’ even if they have robust populations in their range

44

core (Lesica and Allendorf 1995; Glass et al. 2017). Northern jurisdictions must therefore decide

45

how much of their conservation resources to spend protecting peripheral versus more endemic

46

species (Bunnell et al. 2004). This allocation is tricky as the relative conservation value of

47

peripheral populations remains controversial (e.g. Lesica and Allendorf 1995; Bunnell et al.

48

2004; Glass et al. 2017)

49

On one hand, peripheral populations may be less important to species’ overall persistence

50

and harder to conserve than populations closer to the range core (Lesica and Allendorf 1995). In

51

the absence of dispersal barriers, range edges are thought to arise from declines in the abundance

52

and quality of habitat, such that peripheral populations are predicted to be less fit, smaller, and

53

more isolated than central populations (Brown et al. 1996; Eckert et al. 2008). Small populations

54

are more prone to genetic drift, which can lead to the fixation of deleterious mutations and

55

interfere with selection of favourable mutations, thereby eroding population fitness and adaptive

56

potential (Brown et al. 1996). This is particularly true of poleward populations that arose from

57

post-glacial range expansions, as expansion additionally reduces genetic diversity and fitness via

58

successive founder effects and ‘surfing’ of deleterious alleles (Waters et al. 2013; Pironon et al.

59

2017). Small, isolated populations are also more prone to extinction from demographic and

60

environmental stochasticity, and it has often proven challenging to maintain or increase

61

population sizes at species range edges (Bunnell et al. 2004). For these reasons, some biologists

62

and policy makers have argued against allocating limited conservation resources to edge

63

populations (Hunter and Hutchinson 1994; Bunnell et al. 2004).

64

Despite their demographic vulnerability, peripheral populations may harbour distinctive

65

genetic diversity important for preserving species’ evolutionary potential (Hunter and

66

Hutchinson 1994; Hampe and Petit 2005) and hence capacity for response to rapid

67

environmental change. If peripheral populations occupy different environments than core

68

populations (Lesica and Allendorf 1995), they will experience novel selection (Mayr 1954;

69

Chevin and Lande 2011). Transplant experiments reveal that peripheral populations can be

70

locally adapted to range-edge conditions (Sexton et al. 2011; Hargreaves and Eckert 2019),

71

contributing uniquely to intra-species diversity. Dispersal ability is also strongly selected on at

72

range edges (Phillips et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2016), and both adaptation to local habitat and

73

increased dispersal ability can prime peripheral populations for colonizing habitat beyond the

74

species current range (Darling et al. 2008; Hargreaves and Eckert 2014; Hargreaves et al. 2015).

75

Poleward populations are increasingly valuable in this regard, as they are geographically poised

76

to initiate poleward range shifts under climate warming (Gibson et al. 2009).

77

As the above controversy suggests, range position alone may be insufficient to determine

78

a population’s conservation value. Edge populations are not always smaller or more isolated than

79

range-centre populations, nor does range position predict genetic diversity, genetic quality, or

80

demographic stability consistently enough to guide conservation policy (Eckert et al. 2008;

81

Pironon et al. 2017). Empirical evidence for local adaptation in peripheral populations is

82

decidedly mixed, though still poorly tested (Hargreaves et al. 2014). Finally, even ‘super edge

83

populations’ with high performance at many sites in many years may be hard to identify without

84

large experiments, as ecologically important adaptations can be masked in benign years or by

85

poor maternal provisioning or inbreeding (Sexton et al. 2011; Hargreaves and Eckert 2019).

86

Assessing the conservation value of specific edge populations therefore requires empirical

87

research, yet earlier syntheses suggest peripheral populations are under-studied compared to core

88

populations (Eckert et al. 2008; Sexton et al. 2009).

89

Canada is an excellent case for studying peripheral species’ representation in

90

conservation policy and research in high-latitude countries. Canada is the world’s second largest

91

country, spanning almost 10 million km2 and more than 41° of latitude—as much latitude as

92

separates Canada from the Equator. Canada’s biodiversity is clustered at its southern border

93

(Coristine et al. 2018), and many species only occur in Canada at the northern tip of a much

94

larger range (Fig. 1). Canadian conservation legislation seems especially likely to protect such

95

peripheral species, as both the initial conservation assessment body (Committee on the Status of

96

Endangered Wildlife in Canada; COSEWIC) and federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) largely

97

ignore populations outside Canada when determining national conservation priority. Previous

98

estimates suggest that ~75% of Canada’s at-risk species only occur in Canada at their northern

99

range edge (Yakimowski and Eckert 2007; Gibson et al. 2009). Yet in 2012, three species were

100

denied federal protection because the government deemed they were ‘only’ peripheral

101

populations (Fraser 2000; SARA 2012), logic that could jeopardize the protection of many

102

species in Canada.

103

Here we explore the relationships between peripherality (whether a taxon occurs in a

104

jurisdiction only at its geographic range edge), conservation priority, and research effort. We

105

consider vascular plants as they are of high conservation value globally but often receive

106

disproportionately little conservation funding (Raven 1987; Schemske et al. 1994); are relatively

107

diverse in Canada (e.g. 3600 species compared to ~150 mammals); and make up the largest

108

proportion (~23%) of taxa assessed by COSEWIC. Using 214 plant taxa with a published

109

COSEWIC assessment and range map, we designated each as peripheral (northernmost 20% or

110

less of its range in Canada) or non-peripheral (>20% of its range in Canada). We then tested (i)

111

whether the proportion of peripheral taxa increases from low to high COSEWIC threat rankings

112

(not-at-risk, special concern, threatened, endangered) and (ii) whether Canadian and international

113

threat rankings differ more for peripheral vs. non-peripheral taxa using standardized NatureServe

114

rankings. We surveyed the research on at-risk taxa to (iii) test whether the conservation-relevant

115

research effort was evenly spread between peripheral and non-peripheral taxa and (iv) assess

116

how range-wide studies of at-risk taxa could inform conservation.

117
118

METHODS

119

Canadian conservation designation

120

We considered the 214 vascular plant taxa assessed by COSEWIC as of July 2017 for which a

121

published COSEWIC assessment was available (one not-at-risk species, Hackelia ciliata, was

122

excluded due to lack of published assessment). Eligibility for protection under Canada’s Species

123

at Risk Act (SARA) is determined by the COSEWIC Vascular Plant subcommittee using

124

quantitative criteria established by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature

125

(IUCN). Initial COSEWIC assessments consider only populations in Canada (Gärdenfors 2001;

126

COSEWIC 2017), but can be adjusted by secondary assessments that consider the likelihood of

127

genetic replenishment from core populations, local adaptations in Canadian populations,

128

Canadian habitat’s importance to the taxon’s persistence, and the condition of populations

129

outside Canada (IUCN 2018). COSEWIC assessments use the ‘best biological information on a

130

species’, including scientific studies, community knowledge, and Aboriginal traditional

131

knowledge (SARA 2010). The final decision to nationally protect a taxon under SARA rests with

132

the federal government after considering the socioeconomic implications (SARA 2010); we use

133

COSEWIC rather than SARA designations throughout as they more closely reflect biology.

134

Taxa characterization

135

For each of the 214 taxa (including species, subspecies, varieties, and populations), we recorded

136

its COSEWIC designation. 192 taxa were designated at-risk, i.e. of special concern (may become

137

threatened or endangered due to biological constraints and other threats: 21%), threatened (likely

138

to become endangered: 22%), or endangered (facing imminent extirpation or extinction: 47%).

139

The remaining assessed taxa were designated ‘not-at-risk’ (do not face an imminent extirpation

140

or extinction risk given the current circumstances: 10%). For four species with separate listings

141

for two geographically distinct populations (Eleocharis geniculata, Psilocarphus brevissimus,

142

Smilax rotundifolia, Solidago speciosa), we included both listings as separate data points. For

143

each taxon, we determined its taxonomic group (angiosperm, gymnosperm, or pteridophyte

144

(ferns and allies)), lifespan (annual/biennial, perennial, or mixed), growth form (herb/graminoid,

145

woody shrub, or tree), habitat (aquatic or terrestrial), and general location in Canada. This

146

information was generally in COSEWIC reports, otherwise we used SARA and plants USDA

147

databases (SARA Act 2011; USDA 2018).

148

(i) Proportion of peripheral taxa from lowest to highest COSEWIC threat ranking

149

To assess whether peripherality is associated with COSEWIC threat ranking, we designated each

150

taxon as either ‘peripheral’ (only the northernmost 20% or less of their distribution in Canada;

151

Fig. 1), or ‘non-peripheral’. Micranthes spicata had ≤20% of its eastern range edge in the Yukon

152

with the rest in Alaska; it was deemed non-peripheral. Peripheral designation was determined

153

visually from range maps in COSEWIC reports (214 taxa), or from the USDA database (USDA

154

2018) if the COSEWIC report lacked a map (Pedicularis furbishiae). For four taxa close to the

155

20% threshold, we checked visual estimates by digitizing COSEWIC maps and calculating the

156

proportion range area in Canada (P. Caissy & A.L. Hargreaves, unpublished data).

157

Analyses were done in R 3.5.1 (R Development Core Team 2018). We tested whether the

158

proportion of peripheral taxa differed among the four COSEWIC threat rankings using a 4 ´ 2

159

Fisher’s exact test (fisher.test). As it did, we tested which ranks differed from each other using a

160

pairwise post-hoc comparison holding the overall a = 0.05 (pairwiseNominalIndependence,

161

rcompanion package version 2.1.7 (Mangiafico 2018)). To test whether the pattern of

162

peripherality vs. threat ranking differed among habitats, life spans, or growth forms, we ran one

163

binomial generalized linear model (GLM) per grouping, with peripherality as a binomial

164

response (yes/no) and threat rank and group as interacting categorical predictors (peripheral ~

165

threat_rank ´ group, glm, logit link function, Fig. S1). Models of life span excluded 5 taxa with

166

‘mixed’ life spans as there were no ‘not-at-risk’ taxa in this category. Group levels are described

167

above (Taxa characterization). Significance of GLM predictors was assessed using type III tests

168

(Anova, car package version 2.1.4 (Fox and Weisberg 2018)). Finally, we tested whether

169

peripheral taxa were more endangered overall by converting the four COSEWIC categories to

170

numeric ranks (1-4) and testing whether this differed between peripheral and non-peripheral taxa

171

using a non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon test (wilcox.test).

172

(ii) Canadian vs. global NatureServe threat rankings

173

We compared Canadian vs. global threat rankings from NatureServe (i.e. ‘rounded global status’;

174

NatureServe 2018); NatureServe ranks use consistent criteria so national and global rankings are

175

directly comparable. Ranks range from 1 (most threatened) to 5 (least threatened, NatureServe

176

2018). While NatureServe also considers taxa below the species level, Canadian or global ranks

177

were missing for seven taxa (three at-risk and four not-at-risk), so n = 207 taxa (full list of taxa’s

178

COSEWIC, SARA and NatureServe ranks in Dryad data). We calculated the ‘rank discrepancy’

179

for each taxon as ‘Global rank – Canadian rank’. Values are numeric but only range from 0 (i.e.

180

no difference) to 4 (i.e. taxon ranked as 5 (least threatened) globally and 1 (most threatened) in

181

Canada), so are non-parametric. We tested whether rank discrepancy differed between peripheral

182

and non-peripheral taxa using a two-sample Wilcoxon test.

183

Although Nature Conservancy and COSEWIC ranks use different numbers of categories

184

(five and four, respectively), both are derived from IUCN criteria. To test whether the two bodies

185

ranked taxa consistently, we converted COSEWIC ranks to numeric ranks from 4 (not-at-risk) to

186

1 (endangered); as NatureServe did not give any species a 5 (least threatened) in Canada, both

187

NatureServe Canadian ranks and numeric COSEWIC ranks varied from 1 to 4. We used a paired

188

Wilcoxon test to assess whether COSEWIC and NatureServe ranks for Canadian populations

189

differed overall (the five taxa with two distinct COSEWIC designations were each counted

190

twice). As NatureServe and COSEWIC ranks did differ significantly (Fig. S2a), we tested

191

whether the difference between NatureServe – COSEWIC Canadian ranks was greater for

192

peripheral taxa (unpaired Wilcoxon test; Fig. S2b), and whether it altered conclusions re. the

193

‘Global rank – Canadian rank’ (paragraph above) by redoing that analysis replacing NatureServe

194

Canadian ranks with COSEWIC ranks (Fig. S3).

195

(iii) Research effort on plant taxa considered at-risk in Canada

196

To assess the research effort on plants at-risk in Canada, we searched ISI Web of Science for

197

studies on each at-risk taxon using its Latin name, common name, and synonyms listed in its

198

COSEWIC assessment. While COSEWIC evaluated some specific subspecies, varieties or

199

populations, we found few studies for these smaller designations so considered all taxa at the

200

species level (n = 189 at-risk species). We narrowed results to ecological or evolutionary studies

201

by including a second search term “*ecolog* OR evolution* OR population* OR demograph*

202

OR genetic* OR conservation* OR fitness”. We discarded studies that did not present data on the

203

taxon of interest (e.g. only mentioned it in key words), yielding 2940 studies.

204

We categorized the resulting studies on their conservation and geographic relevance. We

205

categorized conservation relevance as: 1—no data on natural populations or that could be used

206

by COSEWIC; 2—data from natural populations but not relevant to COSEWIC (e.g. how much

207

a plant species contributed to a herbivore’s diet); or 3—data of potential use to COSEWIC and

208

conservation (e.g. performance, local adaptation or genetic diversity of natural populations);

209

ultimately we only considered this third category in analyses (below). We also classified whether

210

studies sampled wild Canadian populations, wild populations in the USA, both (providing a

211

wider geographic context for the at-risk Canadian populations), or neither (sampled populations

212

outside Canada/USA or no specific population). Studies that investigated more than one at-risk

213

taxon were counted for each taxon included.

214
215

We then assessed the distribution of research effort potentially relevant to conservation
(category 3). We first tested whether species that were peripheral or not peripheral in Canada
10

216

(binary predictor) differed in the probability that they had been studied anywhere in their range

217

(yes/no response; binomial GLM), or differed in the number of studies per species from

218

anywhere in their range (over-dispersed count response, negative binomial GLM, glm.nb, MASS

219

package version 7.3.45 (Venables and Ripley 2013)). We then reran both analyses considering

220

only studies that included Canadian populations. For negative binomial models, we assessed the

221

significance of peripherality by comparing the model with peripherality as a predictor (#studies ~

222

peripheralYN) to the null model (#studies ~ 1) using a likelihood ratio test with significance

223

evaluated using the Chi squared distribution (anova, df = 1).

224

(iv) Conservation insights from comparing edge vs core populations

225

Studies that sample populations from both Canada and the USA should reveal the most about the

226

relative conservation value of peripheral populations in Canada. We therefore read each such

227

study and noted examples where the results yielded insights relevant to conservation that could

228

not have been gleaned from smaller-scale sampling.

229

RESULTS

230

Of 192 at-risk plant taxa in Canada, 77% were peripheral, with only the northernmost 20% or

231

less of their distribution in Canada. Many occurred only in Ontario or British Columbia (68% of

232

148 peripheral taxa vs. 30% of 44 non-peripheral taxa; Fig. 1). Thus, these provinces are

233

disproportionately responsible for conserving at-risk plants, and peripheral species in particular.

234
235

(i) Proportion of peripheral taxa from lowest to highest COSEWIC threat ranking

236

The percentage of plant taxa that only occur peripherally in Canada increased with increasing

238

higher in the Endangered vs. Special concern rank (post-hoc P = 0.0007), and the differences

239

between Endangered and Not at risk and between Threatened and Special concern were almost

240

significant (post-hoc P = 0.055; Fig. 2). The pattern of peripherality vs. threat ranking was

241

consistent between aquatic vs. terrestrial habitats, herbaceous/graminoid vs. woody growth

242

forms, and annual/biennial vs. perennial life spans (Fig. S1). Overall, peripheral taxa were

243

significantly more endangered than non-peripheral taxa (Wilcoxon test W = 2827, P < 0.001).

244
245

(ii) Canadian vs. global NatureServe threat rankings

246

For the 207 taxa in our dataset with both Canadian and global NatureServe ranks (157 peripheral,

247

50 not peripheral), the disparity between Canadian and global ranks was greater for taxa that are

248

peripheral in Canada compared to taxa that are not (Wilcoxon test, W = 6756, P < 0.001; Fig. 3).

249

Of the 203 plant taxa that NatureServe considered at-risk (ranks 1 to 3) in Canada, 67% were

250

considered secure (ranks 4 or 5) across their global range; most of these at-risk-nationally but

251

secure-globally taxa are peripheral in Canada (125 peripheral, 14 non-peripheral; Fig. 3).

252

NatureServe tended to consider taxa more threatened than COSEWIC, but this difference

253

reflected higher threat rankings for non-peripheral taxa (Fig. S2); the greater discrepancy

254

between national and global threat ranks for peripheral taxa (Fig. 3) remains if one compares

255

NatureServe global ranks and COSEWIC ranks directly (Fig. S3).

256
257

(iii) Research effort on plant species considered at-risk in Canada

258

We found 709 conservation-relevant studies on plant species considered at-risk (by COSEWIC)

259

in Canada. Almost half (43%) of Canada’s 189 at-risk plant species had not been studied in peer-

260

reviewed work that could inform conservation (Fig. 4a). Though this does not preclude the

261

existence of studies in the non-refereed literature or journals not indexed on Web of Science, it

262

suggests that the ‘best biological information’ is sparse for these taxa. Species peripheral in

263

Canada and species not peripheral in Canada did not differ in the likelihood that they had been

264

studied somewhere in their range (43% vs 45%; binomial GLM: peripheral_designation c2df=1 =

265

0.10, P = 0.75) or in the number of studies overall (negative binomial GLM:

266

peripheral_designation c2df=1 = 0.89, P = 0.34; Fig. 4a).

267

Of the 709 conservation-relevant studies, only 188 included Canadian populations; more

268

than half (57%) of plant species at-risk in Canada had not been studied in Canada (Fig. 4b).

269

Compared to non-peripheral species, species that are peripheral in Canada were as likely to have

270

been studied in Canada (57% vs 55%; binomial GLM: peripheral_designation c2df=1 = 0.16, P =

271

0.69) but had significantly fewer studies per species that included Canadian populations

272

(negative binomial GLM: peripheral_designation c2df=1 = 7.27, P = 0.0070; Fig. 4b).

(iv) Conservation insights from comparing edge vs core populations

275

Only 42 (5%) of 709 studies on plants at-risk in Canada studied Canadian populations in the

276

context of their geographic range (i.e. included both Canadian and USA populations). These

277

studies covered 21 (11%) of 189 at-risk species, and almost half were on one of three species:

278

Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis; 8 studies), Butternut (Juglans cinerea, 7 studies), and Juniper

279

sedge (Carex juniperorum, 3 studies). Studies that took a range-wide perspective provided

280

unique insights into the conservation of peripheral populations (Table 1). These include whether

281

edge populations differ from core populations genetically or demographically, or in their traits or

282

habitat. For instance, populations of Deerberry decreased in size and frequency toward the

283

species northern range edge in Canada, but nevertheless were as productive and genetically

284

diverse as core populations, and showed evidence of local adaptation and high dispersal ability

285

(Yakimowski and Eckert 2007, 2008). Thus the demographic and genetic value of these

286

populations was not predicted by their peripherality, size, or spatial isolation.

287

DISCUSSION

288

Our results show that conservation of plants in Canada is fundamentally the conservation of

289

range-edge populations. Three quarters of nationally at-risk plant taxa only occur in Canada at

290

the northernmost 20% or less of their North American range, in line with earlier estimates for all

291

at-risk taxa combined (Gibson et al. 2009). While many not-at-risk plants are also peripheral in

292

Canada (Fig. 2), peripheral taxa had higher threat rankings overall and a greater discrepancy

293

between their Canadian vs. global threat ranking (Fig. 3). Higher national threat ranks for

294

peripheral taxa could reflect real increased risk per population, since human activity is also

295

highest in southern Canada (Coristine and Kerr 2011), or the precautionary principle since

296

Canada has little control over the fate of populations outside its borders. Either way, northern-

297

edge populations are geographically poised to initiate northward range shifts under climate

298

warming, so may be critical for Canada’s future biodiversity (Gibson et al. 2009). Moreover,

299

northward range shifts will bring new species to Canada’s southern border, requiring an

300

informed policy on conserving peripheral populations. Unfortunately, conservation of peripheral

301

taxa has been debated in the absence of much relevant scientific evidence.

302

While peripheral populations are prioritized for conservation in Canada, they do not seem

303

prioritized for peer-reviewed research that could inform their conservation. Based on our Web of

304

Science survey, more than half of the plant species with at-risk populations in Canada had not

305

been studied in Canada in a way that could guide their conservation, and peripheral plants had

306

significantly fewer studies that included Canadian populations than non-peripheral plants (Fig.

307

4). Even the best-studied at-risk peripheral plant (Cirsium pitcheri) had only 8 studies that

308

included Canadian populations. While this could reflect difficulty in obtaining permits or

309

adequate sample sizes, taxonomic bias is likely. For example, one bird species that is both

310

peripheral and at-risk in Canada had almost 50 studies that included Canadian populations

311

(Marbeled murrelet; Web of Science search May 2019). Thus peripheral plants appear

312

systematically under-studied in Canada.

313

Conservation-relevant studies that include both Canadian and US populations illustrate

314

the value of studying peripheral populations directly and in a broad geographical context.

315

However, most such studies have assessed neutral genetic diversity and population structure

316

(Table 1). Conservation would particularly benefit from studies that assess characteristics

317

important for long-term persistence and range expansion, such as habitat preferences, population

318

demography and dispersal ability (Schemske et al. 1994). Future genetic work could move

319

beyond neutral variation to evaluating the adaptive diversity likely to be important in responding

320

to environmental change (Shaw and Etterson 2012), and local adaptation through which range-

321

edge populations may contribute uniquely to species’ biodiversity (Yeaman et al. 2016). Whether

322

researchers will close these knowledge gaps depends partially on how government agencies

323

incentivise (i.e. fund) and remove barriers to (i.e. permit) research on at-risk peripheral

324

populations. Unfortunately, the “peripherality issue” is not currently highlighted in federal

325

programs that fund species-at-risk research in Canada (e.g. Government of Canada 2019).

326
327

We hope that exposing the lack of peer-reviewed study inspires future work on at-risk
edge populations, but recognize that amassing this work will take time, and that some of the most

328

informative types of study, e.g. large reciprocal transplants, will be impossible with endangered

329

taxa. We therefore suggest that we have an excellent and potentially under-used body of research

330

that could inform Canadian conservation: the already extensive theory and empirical research on

331

species range edges (Sexton et al. 2009; Pironon et al. 2017). While this research clearly shows

332

that edge populations can vary significantly from one another in demography (Sagarin et al.

333

2006) and adaptation (Hargreaves and Eckert 2019), it also reveals broad scale patterns that can

334

be predictive, e.g. that poleward range edges are often dispersal limited whereas high-elevation

335

edge populations are often population sinks (Halbritter et al. 2013; Hargreaves et al. 2014). For

336

countries like Canada whose biodiversity is disproportionately comprised of range-edge

337

populations, leveraging the species-distribution literature could help inform conservation,

338

helping meet our commitments to protecting current and future biodiversity.

Threat ranking in Canada (COSEWIC)

Figure S1. The relation between peripherality and threat status does not differ between
habitats, lifespans, or growth forms. Each panel was assessed with a binomial GLM:
proportion peripheral taxa ~ threat_rank ´ group, where group was habitat, lifespan, or growth
form. The interaction term was non-significant in full models (threat ´ habitat: c2df=3 = 0.99, P =
0.80; threat ´ lifespan: c2df=3 = 4.60, P = 0.20; threat ´ growth form: c2df=3 = 2.92, P = 0.41), so
was dropped from final models. In all final models (peripheral ~ threat_rank + group), the
proportion of peripheral taxa did not differ among groups (habitat: c2df=1 = 1.68, P = 0.19;
lifespan: c2df=1 = 0.51, P = 0.47; growth form: c2df=1 = 0.20, P = 0.65), but differed significantly
with COSEWIC status (more peripheral taxa in the endangered vs. special concern rank, as per
main results Fig. 2). Threat categories are listed from least to most threatened, a taxon is
considered peripheral if it occurs in Canada at the northernmost 20% or less of its range, and
numbers at bottom give the number of taxa per bar (total n is lower for (b) as 5 taxa with a mixed
lifespan (annual/perennial or biennial/perennial) were excluded).

Figure S2. NatureServe ranks Canadian plant populations as more nationally-imperiled
than does COSEWIC. NatureServe ranks range from 1 (most threatened) to 5 (least threatened),
but none of the plant taxa assessed by COSEWIC were given a rank of 5. COSEWIC categorical
ranks were converted to numeric ranks from 1= endangered to 4 = not at risk. (a) Even assuming
equivalent scales (i.e. NatureServe 4 equivalent to COSEWIC 4), NatureServe ranks of Canadian
populations differed from COSEWIC ranks (paired Wilcoxon test W = 1078, P = 0.0006; n =
207 taxa) in that NatureServe tended to rank taxa as more nationally threatened than COSEWIC.
(b) The difference between NatureServe and COSEWIC rankings in (a) was driven primarily by
non-peripheral taxa, which showed a bigger discrepancy (unpaired Wilcoxon test W = 4788, P =
0.008).

NatureServe Global threat rank

Figure S3. Peripheral taxa have a greater discrepancy between Canadian and global threat
ranks whether one uses NatureServe Canadian ranks (a) or COSEWIC ranks (b). Threat
rankings are described in Fig. S2 (1=most threatened). (a) Same data as shown in Fig. 3: the
difference in NatureServe Global – NatureServe Canadian threat ranks is greater for peripheral
vs non-peripheral species. (b) The difference between NatureServe Global – COSEWIC
Canadian ranks is also greater for peripheral vs. non-peripheral species (Wilcoxon test, W =
7072, P < 0.001).
