Abstract

11

Urban environments are webbed with iron-steel structures above and belowground. Underground, in non-

12

sulfidic environments, it has been suggested that interspecies interactions cause Fe0 corrosion. Particularly,

13

Methanosarcinales were assumed to interact syntrophically with acetogenic bacteria during Fe0 corrosion.

14

Here we challenge this assumption and show that a community of methanogens (38% Methanosarcinales)

15

prospers on Fe0 especially after the demise of the acetogens. Acetogens were mainly represented by

16

Clostridium (81% of Bacteria). Methanogens were however more diverse including Methanosarcina (22% of

17

Archaea), Methanosaeta (17% of Archaea) and Methanothermobacter (22% of Archaea) as key groups.

18

Surprisingly, acetogens started using electrons from Fe0 immediately, unchallenged by competing

19

methanogens. Acetogens were expected to be outcompeted by energy efficient methanogens with

20

comparatively lower H2-uptake thresholds. However, acetogens prevailed, perhaps because in contrast to

21

methanogens they contain [FeFe]-hydrogenases (encoded in the lake-Clostridia metagenome). [FeFe]-

22

hydrogenases from Clostridium were previously shown effective at retrieving electrons from Fe0 for proton

23

reduction. When acetogens thrived, methanogenic rates were low (25.2±8 µM/day) but increased appreciably

24

(62.5±5 µM/day) when acetogens collapsed. Acetate could not explain more than a third of the observed

25

methanogenic rates. The remaining methane could be explained by methanogens reducing their energy

26

expenses while exploiting Clostridium remains such as readily fixed nitrogen and/or exuded [FeFe]-

27

hydrogenases producing H2 on Fe0. This has implications on our understanding of viable interactions between

28

autotrophic species retrieving electrons from Fe0 or other insoluble electron donors.

29

Implications

30

Corrosion damages to underground iron-structures distress both the local environment and the economy. Here

31

we studied an urban lake community corroding Fe0. The corrosive community was dominated by Clostridium

32

and Methanosarcinales, which sequentially produced first more acetate and later methane. Here we bring

33

evidence for an unusual interaction mechanism on Fe0, showing that methanogenesis is enhanced by inactive

34

acetogens. Alone, the Clostridium-acetogens discovered in this study, could retrieve electrons from Fe0

35

effectively, which makes them a good candidate for electrosynthesis of fossil-fuels’ alternatives - a future

36

biotechnological application.

INTRODUCTION

38

Steel infrastructure extends for billions of kilometers below ground enabling transport and storage of clean

39

water, chemicals, fuels, sewage, but also protection for telecommunication and electricity cables. Deep

40

underground, under anoxic, non-sulfidic conditions, steel was expected to persist unharmed for centuries (1-

41

3). And yet, under such conditions, certain groups of anaerobes (methanogens and acetogens) strip electrons

42

off Fe0 leading to microbial induced corrosion (MIC) (4-8). Damages induced by MIC in the underground are

43

often discovered too late, leading to environmental and economic devastation. Thus, it is important to be able

44

to predict the lifespan of the material if exposed to microbial communities native to the site where steel

45

structures are located. This would lead to effective replacement strategies and recuperation of the metal prior

46

to accidental spills that may be detrimental to the surrounding environment (1-3).

47

MIC in non-sulfidic environments is often linked to the presence of acetogens like Clostridium and

48

methanogens like Methanosarcinales on the surface of the corroded steel structure (4-9). It has been suggested

49

that Methanosarcinales were growing in a mutualistic relationship with the acetogens, and allegedly both

50

groups were gaining from the interaction (7, 8). This assumption was based on acetogens producing acetate,

51

which would be then consumed by acetotrophic Methanosarcinales methanogens. Concurrently, acetogens

52

were expected to be favored by the removal of their metabolic product - acetate. However, apart from

53

establishing a mutualistic interaction on Fe0, acetogens and methanogens may be interacting in two other ways:

54

1) by competing and 2) by establishing a succession to maximize access to electrons from Fe0 for reduction of

55

CO2 to acetate (acetogens; reaction 1) or methane (methanogens; reaction 2).

56

4Fe0 + 2CO2 + 4HCO3- + 4H+ → 4FeCO3 + CH3COOH + 2H2O (∆G0’ = -388 kJ/mol; Reaction 1)

57

4Fe0 + CO2 + 4HCO3- + 4H+ → 4FeCO3 + CH4 + 2H2O

58

Theoretically, under standard thermodynamic conditions, methanogens should have an advantage over

59

acetogens when provided with Fe0 as sole electron donor (Reactions 1 & 2). Especially, since methanogens,

60

unlike acetogens, are more effective at retrieving abiotic H2 (formed on Fe0) due to their low H2-uptake

61

thresholds (10, 11). Several groups of methanogens could corrode Fe0 independent of acetogenic bacteria,

62

including species of Methanosarcina (12-14), Methanobacterium (14-16) and Methanococcus (6, 13, 14, 17).

63

The mechanism by which methanogens corrode Fe0, has been debated and includes reports which suggest they

64

retrieve abiotic-H2 off the Fe0 surface (12), retrieve electrons directly using an unknown electron-uptake

65

mechanism (15, 18) or use extracellular enzymes, which stimulate enzymatic H2-evolution on the Fe0-surface

66

(17). The later mechanism was especially relevant for Methanococcus species which harbored an unstable

(∆G0’ = -446 kJ/mol; Reaction 2)

67

genomic island encoding [NiFe]-hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases enzymes additional to those

68

already encoded by their standard genome (19).

69

And yet, oftentimes acetogens dominate corrosive communities, outcompeting methanogens when

70

concentrations of H2 are high and temperatures are low, presumably due to the higher kinetics (Vmax) of their

71

hydrogenases (10). Moreover, unlike methanogens, acetogens contain [FeFe]-hydrogenases (20), which could

72

retrieve electrons directly from Fe0 for proton reduction to H2 possibly (21-23).

73

In this study, we were interested to understand the dynamics of acetogens and methanogens in an urban area

74

where pipelines for infrastructure are buried underground. We studied corrosion of Fe 0 by an urban lake

75

community from nearby a construction site, on the island of Fyn, Denmark. Alike our previous findings in a

76

coastal-sea environment (24), the corroding microbial community was dominated by Clostridium and

77

Methanosarcinales. We used a combination of physiological experiments, process inhibition and whole

78

metagenomic analyses to study the interactions of acetogens and methanogens during Fe0 corrosion. In contrast

79

to our previous report on a corrosive coastal community (24), the acetogens and methanogens in this lake did

80

not compete for retrieval of electrons from Fe0, instead methanogens appeared to take advantage of metabolites

81

and enzymes released by lifeless acetogens.

82

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

83

Methanogens, attached to corroded structures, were assumed to be indirectly involved in corrosion of Fe 0 (7,

84

8). Here we show that methanogens from an urban lake may corrode Fe 0 alone, as effectively as a complex

85

community of acetogens and methanogens together. However, within a complex community methanogenesis

86

was stimulated by deactivated, but abundant co-occurring Clostridium. We therefore propose an unusual

87

interaction, where methanogens may take advantage of acetogenic proton-reducing enzymes, which are set

88

free during the collapse of the acetogenic community.

89

Corrosion under electron acceptor limited conditions

90

From the anoxic sediments of an urban lake near the university of Southern Denmark (Fig. 1), we enriched a

91

methanogenic community for four successive transfers, strictly using Fe0 as electron donor and CO2 as sole

92

electron acceptor. Under these conditions, the community was highly corrosive as confirmed by gravimetric

93

and product accumulation analyses. Thus, the community utilized 9.5 ± 0.6 mg Fe 0, and induced 41% more

94

weight loss than cell-free controls (6.7 ± 0.05 mg Fe0; n=3; p=0.01) (Fig. 2). Since CO2 is the only electron

95

acceptor available, two metabolisms are possible: methane production via CO 2-reductive methanogenesis

96

(reaction 3) and acetate production via acetogenesis (reaction 4).

97

CO2 + 8e- + 8H+ → CH4 + 2H2O (reaction 3)

98

2CO2 + 8e- + 8H+ → CH3COOH + 2H2O (reaction 4)

99

We determined if either of these processes, methanogenesis or acetogenesis, could be corrosive in isolation.

100

Bacteria (acetogens) were inhibited with a cocktail of antibiotics (kanamycin and ampicillin), in order to favor

101

only methanogens. Alone, methanogens were as corrosive (9.1±0.4 mg Fe0) as the whole community (n=3,

102

p=0.35) (Fig. 2). Methanogens were inhibited with 2-bromoethanesulfonate (a coenzyme A analogue) in order

103

to favor only acetogens. To our surprise acetogens were significantly more corrosive alone (10.6 ± 0.4 mg Fe0;

104

n=3; p=0.04) than within a mixed community (Fig. 2).

105

To better understand how methanogens and acetogens corroded Fe0 we corroborated gravimetric

106

determinations with electron recoveries in metabolic products and functional metagenomics of the corrosive

107

community.

108

Electron recoveries exceeded estimated recoveries from abiotic H 2

109

Electron recoveries revealed that this lake corrosive community does not rely on the abiotic H2 chemically

110

generated at the Fe0 surface (2e- + 2H+ → H2). As such, the community produced 3.3 times more methane (3.5

111

± 0.1 mM) than expected (1.1±0.2 mM) from abiotic H2 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, within the community,

112

methanogens started slowly (27±5.7 µM/day), not rivaling highly productive acetogens (68±1.8 µM/day) for

113

the first month (Fig. 3). At the end of the incubation, acetogenesis ceased, whereas methanogens sped up

114

accomplishing rates of methanogenesis (62.5±5.1 µM/day), twofold above those predicted via acetoclastic

115

methanogenesis (28±7.3 µM/day): CH3COOH → CO2 + CH4 (Fig. 3). Perhaps, methanogens were non-

116

competitively accessing electrons from Fe0 in the absence of the acetogens, during the last month of incubation.

117

To further address this, we verified the effectiveness of methanogenesis after the eradication of bacteria with

118

the help of antibiotics. Bearing in mind that methanogens were as corrosive as the mixed community (Fig. 2),

119

we anticipated this would translate in a highly productive methanogenic community once bacteria were

120

rendered ineffective by antibiotics. To our surprise, methanogens unaccompanied by bacteria produced

121

significantly less methane (1.3±0.1 mM) than within the mixed community (3.5±0.1 mM) (Fig. 3). On the

122

other hand, acetogens accumulated significantly more acetate (2.5±0.05 mM), than they did within the mixed

123

community (2.0±0.03 mM) (Fig. 3). However, the mixed community showed overall better electron recoveries

124

than the summed electron recoveries of unaccompanied acetogens and methanogens put together (Fig. 3). We

125

foresee three different scenarios to why the community was 15% more effective in utilizing Fe0 as electron

126

donor than adding up the corrosive activities of solitary acetogens and solitary methanogens.

127

First, the collapse of the acetogens may release useful enzymes for the methanogens.

128

month of incubation, when the acetogenic population collapsed, we hypothesize that dying acetogens released

129

enzymes (e.g. [FeFe]-hydrogenase), which boost H2-production and consequently H2-dependent

130

methanogenesis. This supposition is backed by previous reports, which showed that acetogenic [FeFe]-

131

hydrogenases in isolation reduce protons to hydrogen when provided with Fe0 as electron donor (21-23).

132

Secondly, the collapse of the acetogens results in methanogens co-feeding on Fe0 and acetate.

133

Alternatively, when acetogens collapse, acetoclastic methanogens may start utilizing the Fe0 directly, but can

134

only do so after they were provided with enough acetate for biomass synthesis. This supposition is backed by

135

reports that acetoclastic methanogens retrieve electrons from electrogenic bacteria directly or via conductive

136

particles, while also requiring acetate for incorporation into biomass (25, 26). Moreover, many of the strict H2-

137

utilizing methanogens, require or are stimulated by acetate (27, 28), likely because it alleviates the need to

138

endogenously produce acetate for biomass synthesis.

139

Thirdly, the collapse of the acetogens may lead to fixed N2 accessible to methanogens corroding Fe0.

140

Methanogens were more effective after the collapse of the acetogenic community, and yet they did require the

141

collapse of the acetogens to achieve the highest methanogenic rates. Some acetogens, including several

142

Clostridium species, are effective N2 fixers (29). N2 fixation catalyzed by nitrogenase enzymes is an energy

143

demanding process requiring 16 ATPs for one fixed N2 (30, 31). We hypothesize that the collapse of the

144

acetogens leads to significant release of fixed-dinitrogen, now easily accessible to the methanogens. This

145

supposition was further supported by functional community analyses, which showed a high N2 fixation

146

capacity within the bacterial community but not the archaea (see below).

147

Thus, to better understand how acetogens and methanogens interact with each other inducing higher electron

148

recoveries as a community than alone (Fig. 3), we examined the functional metagenome of a community

149

residing on Fe0 for four successive transfers.

150

Acetogens

151

Clostridium species (especially ‘Lachnoclostridium’ saccharolyticum) dominated the corrosive community

152

(81.3% of all bacteria; 81.2% of all prokaryotes; Fig. 4) according to whole genome sequence analyses. Most

153

Clostridium have never been tested for autotrophic acetogenesis including ‘L.’ sachharolyticum (32, 33).

154

Nevertheless, we could find the entire Wood Ljungdahl pathway for acetogenesis in its readily available

155

genome (NC_014376.1). Using metagenome analyses we also reconstructed the Wood Ljungdahl pathway

156

almost in its entirety for our corrosive-Clostridium, which carried acetogenesis from Fe0 and CO2 (Fig. 5).

157

This acetogenic pathway has been intensively studied for biotechnological applications such as microbial

158

electrosynthesis, where electrodes are provided as electron donor instead of Fe0 (34, 35). Our corrosive

159

Clostridium was highly effective at generating acetate from Fe0 at room temperature with rates (ca. 84 µM/day;

160

Fig. 3) comparable to those observed for various acetogens incubated at higher temperatures on poised

161

electrodes (36) or Fe0 (5, 37). Moreover, Clostridium acetogens, often associated with corrosion, have been

162

recently reported to corrode Fe0 as effectively as sulfate reducers (38).

163

In our enrichments on Fe0, Clostridium-acetogens were faster than the methanogens, initiating and completing

164

their activity two months before the methanogens (Fig. 2). Acetogens are faster not because the Wood-

165

Ljungdahl pathway is more energy effective than methanogenesis, as acetogenesis generates less ATPs (0.3

166

ATPs/acetate; (39)), than CO2-reductive methanogenesis (0.5 ATPs/methane; (40)). Instead, these Clostridium

167

acetogens may be quicker at accessing electrons from Fe0 because they contain [FeFe] proton-reducing

168

hydrogenases, which are absent in methanogens (20). For example, the proton-reducing [FeFe] hydrogenases

169

from C. acetobutylicum corrodes Fe0 effectively by drawing electrons for the reaction: 2H+ + 2e- → H2 (21-

170

23). Clostridial [FeFe] hydrogenases are operative at H+-reduction compared to methanogenic [NiFe]-

171

hydrogenases which are rather operative in the opposite direction doing H2-oxidation, but less effective doing

172

proton reduction (20). In the environmental metagenome of these lake-Clostridia we did find [FeFe]-

173

hydrogenases (EC. 1.12.7.2 ferredoxin hydrogenase), indicating they have the genetic potential to effectively

174

carry proton-reduction. However, we still do not understand the exact mechanism how this lake Clostridium

175

establishes contact with Fe0 for successful electron retrieval by the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes.

176

One possibility is that they retrieve electrons (i) directly via membrane-bound proteins as it has been proposed

177

for Clostridium ljungdahlii grown on electrodes (34, 35), or (ii) indirectly by exuding exocellular enzymes

178

like hydrogenases or formate dehydrogenases for effective electron uptake for enzymatic H2 production (17,

179

21-23). However, if enzymes were exocellular they would deliver H2 non-specifically for both the Clostridium-

180

acetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, resulting in competition for enzymatically-released H2. Then

181

the microorganisms with highest affinity for H2 would be favored. Generally, Clostridium species have a lower

182

H2-threshold (minimum H2-concentration for growth) compared to most methanogens (41). Thus, if

183

Clostridium releases enzymes extracellularly it would not benefit. We therefore propose that during the first

184

phase Clostridium is most likely to directly retrieve electrons possibly using membrane bound [FeFe]-

185

hydrogenases rather than expelling these enzymes extracellularly to be used by their competitors - the

186

methanogens (Fig. 6a).

187

Methanogens

188

Methanogens were highly diverse comprising both acetoclastic Methanosarcinales (ca. 38% of all archaea;

189

including 22% Methanosarcina and 16% Methanosaeta), as well as hydrogenotrophic groups – mostly

190

represented by Methanothermobacter (ca. 22% of all Archaea) (Fig. 4). Methanothermobacter species are

191

rarely associated with corroded structures (42) and were shown to be especially corrosive when provided with

192

a partner bacterium (43). On the other hand, Methanosarcinales have been often associated with corroded

193

structures (4-9) were capable of utilizing Fe0 as electron donor in pure cultures (12-14), but assumed to be

194

indirectly involved in corrosion feeding on acetate delivered by acetogens (7, 8). Here we showed that

195

methanogens alone could indeed corrode Fe0 as effectively as a mixed community of acetogens and

196

methanogens (Fig. 2).

197

During the acetogenic period (Fig. 6), when Clostridium proliferates on Fe0 and produces acetate, we expected

198

Methanosarcinales to feed on the acetate produced by Clostridium. Our data confirmed that during this period

199

acetate explained all the methane produced. Accordingly, when acetogens collapsed, the rate of acetate

200

consumption (40.1 ± 6 µM/day) surpassed that of methanogenesis (25.2 ± 8 µM/day) (Fig. 3) likely due to

201

incorporation in the biomass of the methanogens. During this acetogenic period, the survival of

202

hydrogenotrophic groups like Methanothermobacter may depend on retrieval of abiotic-H2 as well as H2-

203

produced by acetoclastic methanogens (44, 45).

204

During the methanogenic period (Fig. 6), when acetogens collapsed and methanogenic rates rose steeply from

205

ca. 25 µM/day to ca. 63 µM/day, methanogens appear to take advantage of inactivated acetogens. Methanogens

206

alone did not produce methane with the same rates (max. 17 µM/day) as they did together with acetogens (Fig.

207

3). Thus, methanogens appear to require the preceding occurrence of the acetogens. We propose this is due to

208

a combination of factors provided by ‘dying’ Clostridia such as: (i) leaked [FeFe]-proton reducing

209

hydrogenases; (ii) available acetate for methanogenic biomass production; and (iii) readily fixed nitrogen. Our

210

proposition was supported by metagenome analyses, which showed the presence of [FeFe]-ferredoxin

211

hydrogenases in the acetogens, and an abundance of Firmicutes-nitrogenase genes (86% of the nifH, within

212

the entire corrosive community), which were far less abundant in the metagenome of methanogens (0.2% nifH

213

from Methanosarcina; 0.9% from Methanosaeta; and 1.6% in Methanomicrobia).

214

In conclusion, we describe here a novel form of interspecies interaction between acetogenic Clostridia and

215

Methanosarcinales-methanogens during Fe0 corrosion. We observed the interaction between acetogens and

216

methanogens was not limited to acetate-transfer and required the collapse of the acetogens for an advantageous

217

succession of the methanogens.

218

Thus, during Fe0 corrosion, methanogenesis was stimulated by lysed co-occurring Clostridium and we provide

219

support for three different scenarios: (i) the collapse of the acetogens releasing enzymes that boost

220

methanogenesis, (ii) acetate contributing to increased biomass production and (iii) the collapse of the acetogens

221

leading to more fixed N2 accessible to the methanogens corroding Fe0. Moreover, when acetogens collapse,

222

methanogens don’t have to compete anymore for electrons from Fe0. Thus, the interaction is a form of

223

opportunistic scavenging with methanogens prospering due to the demise of the Clostridium.

224

MATERIALS AND METHODS

225

Sample collection and enrichment culture conditions

226

Sediment cores were sampled during the month of July 2016 from a small lake located near a construction site

227

on the campus of the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), Odense (Fig. 1). The salinity of the lake was

228

0.6 psu, and gas bubbles (including methane) were continuously released to the water surface while sampling.

229

Sediment cores were sliced in the laboratory, and the depth horizon 15- 20 cm was used for downstream

230

enrichments in a DSM modified 120 media (modifications: 0.6g/L NaCl, without casitone, without sodium

231

acetate, without methanol, and without Na2S × 9H2O). The enrichment cultures were prepared in 50 mL blue

232

butyl-rubber-stoppered glass vials with an anoxic headspace of a CO2: N2 gas mix (20:80, v/v). Iron granules

233

(99.98% Thermo Fisher, Germany) or iron coupons (3cm × 1cm × 1mm) were the only source of electrons

234

over the course of five successive transfers. All incubations were performed in triplicate.

235

All enrichments were transferred when methane production reached stationary phase. DNA extractions, SEM

236

analyses, and further experiments were performed at the fourth transfer, after 2 years of enrichment on Fe0. In

237

addition, methanogen-specific coenzyme F420 auto-fluorescence was monitored via routine microscopy to

238

confirm the presence or absence of methanogens. To evaluate the solitary corrosive potential of methanogens,

239

we blocked all bacteria with an antibiotic cocktail 200 µg/mL of kanamycin and 100 µg/mL of ampicillin as

240

done before (46). To evaluate the solitary corrosive potential of the acetogens, we inhibited all methanogens

241

with 2 mM 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) as done before (47).

242

Chemical analyses

243

Methane concentrations were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Trace 1300 gas chromatograph system coupled

244

to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The injector was operated at 150 °C and the detector at 200°C with

245

1.0 mL/min argon as reference gas. The oven temperature was constant at 70°C. Separation was done on a

246

TG-BOND Msieve 5A column (Thermo Scientific; 30-m length, 0.53-mm i.d., and 20-μm film thickness) with

247

argon as carrier gas at a flow of 25 mL/min. The GC was controlled and automated by a Chromeleon software

248

(Dionex, Version 7). On our set-up the limit of detection for H2 and CH4 was 5 µM.

249

Acetate production was measured using the Dionex ICS-1500 Ion Chromatography System (ICS-1500)

250

equipped with the AS50 autosampler, and an IonPac AS22 column coupled to a conductivity detector (31 mA).

251

For separation of volatile fatty acids, we used 4.5 mM Na 2CO3 with 1.4 mM NaHCO3 as eluent. The run was

252

isothermic at 30°C with a flow rate of 1.2mL/min. The limit of detection for acetate was 0.1 mM.

253

DNA purification and metagenomic analyses

254

DNA was isolated as previously described before (24), using a combination of two commercially available

255

kits: MasterPure™ Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicenter, Madison, Wi, USA), and the Fast

256

Prep spin MPtm kit for soil (Mobio/Quiagen, Hildesheim, Germany). DNA quality was verified on an agarose

257

gel, and DNA was quantified on a mySPEC spectrophotometer (VWR®/ Germany). Whole metagenome

258

sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 system, using an Illumina TrueSeq PCR-free approach via a

259

commercially available service (Macrogen/ Europe). Unassembled DNA sequences were merged, quality

260

checked, and annotated using the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation (MG-RAST) server (v4.03) with default

261

parameters (48). Illumina True Seq sequencing resulted in 3,723,388 high-quality reads of a total of 4,032,354

262

with an average length of 250 bp. For taxonomic analyses, the metagenomic data was compared with the

263

RefSeq (49) database available on the MG-RAST platform. Of a total of 2,664,384 OTUs, only 391 were not

264

classified in a domain. The rarefaction curve indicated that most of the prokaryotic diversity was covered in

265

our sample. To investigate genes involved in carbon and nitrogen fixation, sequencing reads were annotated

266

against the KEGG Orthology (KO) reference database. Both taxonomic and functional analyses were

267

performed with the following cutoff parameters: e-value of 1e–5, a minimum identity of 80%, and a maximum

268

alignment length of 15 bp.

269

Removal of corrosion crust and corrosion rates

270

The corrosion crust from the iron coupons was removed with inactivated acid (10% hexamine in 2M HCl)

271

(50). Then, the iron coupons were dried with N2 gas stream, weighted and anaerobically stored.

272

Scanning electron microscopy

273

Fixation of cells on tron coupons was performed anaerobically by adding 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M

274

phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) and incubating at 4◦C for 12 h. The corroded coupons were then washed three times

275

with 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4°C for 10 min each. Dehydration was accomplished by a series of anoxic pure

276

ethanol steps (each step 10 min; 35%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100% v/v) (51). The coupons were

277

chemical dried with hexamethyldisilazane under a gentle N2 gas stream. Specimens were stored under N2

278

atmosphere and analyzed within 18-24 h at the UMASS electron microcopy facility using the FEI Magellan

279

400 XHR-SEM with a resolution of 5kV.

447

abiotic H2 microorganisms could use four mols H2 to produce a mol of products (acetate or methane)
