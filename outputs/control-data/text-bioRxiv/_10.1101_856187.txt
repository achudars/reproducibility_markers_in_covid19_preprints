Abstract

20

Background

21

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a major public health concern in Ethiopia. However, knowledge

22

about the complex zoonotic transmission cycle is limited, hampering implementation of control

23

strategies. We explored the feeding behavior and activity of the vector (Phlebotomus pedifer) and

24

established the role of livestock in CL transmission.

25

Methods

26

Blood meal origins of engorged sand flies were determined by sequencing host DNA. A host choice

27

experiment was performed to assess the feeding preference of P. pedifer when humans and hyraxes

28

are equally accessible. Ear and nose biopsies from goats and bovines were screened for the presence

29

of Leishmania parasites. Sand flies were captured indoor and outdoor with human landing catches

30

(HLC) and CDC light traps to determine at which time and where P. pedifer is mostly active.

31

Principal findings

32

A total of 180 sand flies were found to bite hosts of 12 genera. Humans were the predominant blood

33

meal source (59.4%, p < 0.001) in all habitats, even in caves, where hyraxes are abundant. Only

34

10.6% of the sand flies fed on hyraxes based on the blood meal analysis, but the host choice

35

experiment revealed that sand flies have a significant preference for feeding on hyraxes over

36

humans (p = 0.009) when hosts are equally accessible. Only a single goat nose biopsy from 412

37

animal samples was found with Leishmania RNA. We found that P. pedifer is predominantly

38

endophagic (p = 0.003), but occurs both indoors and outdoors. A substantial amount of sand flies

39

was active in the early evening, which increased over time reaching its maximum around midnight.

40

Conclusion

41

We indicate that Leishmania transmission in southwestern Ethiopia is, in contrast to earlier

42

suggestions, likely mainly anthroponotic and that livestock does not play a role in transmission.

Author summary

46

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. It is caused by

47

Leishmania aethiopica protozoa that are transmitted when female sand flies take a blood

48

meal. Hyraxes are assigned as the reservoirs of the infection, because many were found

49

infected with Leishmania. There is very limited knowledge about the behavior of sand flies

50

and other potential hosts of the infection. However, this information is a prerequisite for

51

disease control, which is currently hampered. In this study, we found that humans are likely

52

the main source of the infection and that the role of hyraxes in disease transmission needs

53

further investigation to decide whether they should be included in control programs.

54

Livestock appears not play a role in transmission, even though sand flies like to feed on

55

them. We also show that sand flies are active indoors and outdoors, but have a preference

56

for feeding inside human dwellings and that they are mostly active around midnight.

57

Overall, we conclude that disease prevention and control should emphasize on human

58

protection by applying vector control indoors, at night.

Introduction

60

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector born disease, caused by Leishmania protozoa and

61

transmitted by female phlebotomine sand flies. It is characterized by nodules or ulcerative skin

62

lesions on people’s faces and extremities, which result in disfiguring scars after healing [1,2].

63

CL is a major public health concern in Ethiopia, affecting approximately 20,000 to 50,000 people

64

annually [3], in which Leishmania aethiopica is responsible for the majority of the infections [4–6].

65

Ochollo, our study site, is a village in the mid-highlands of southwestern Ethiopia, where CL is

66

endemic and is mainly affecting young children [7,8]. A recent study identified 4% of the primary

67

school children with active lesions, 1.5% with lesions and scars and 59.8% with scars [8]. Adults are

68

very seldom found with active lesions, because they already recovered from a childhood Leishmania

69

infection, thereby becoming resistant to the development of clinical infection [9]. There are

70

currently no control programs for CL in southern Ethiopia, mainly because of the complexity of the

71

zoonotic transmission cycle and the limited understanding of the vector’s behavior.

72

Previous researchers described Phlebotomus pedifer as the only vector in Ochollo [10–13], showing a

73

3.5% infection rate [13]. A study in Kenya found a good vectorial capacity of P. pedifer when feeding

74

on active human CL lesions caused by L. aethiopica, implying that it is an efficient vector [14]. The

75

species has been found indoors, around household compounds, in tree holes, rocky areas and inside

76

caves [12,13]. A study in Ochollo in 1973 showed that 11 P. pedifer sand flies from indoors and five

77

from caves were solely feeding on humans and hyraxes respectively [12]. However, until now

78

relatively little is known about its biting behavior. Sand flies are generally known to be active

79

between dusk and dawn and females feed on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. However, the peak

80

activity and host preference differs among sand fly species, so species specific entomological data

81

are crucial to obtain a clear image of the transmission cycle [15–17].

82

Besides the vector, the reservoirs of the infection should be well documented. Hyraxes (Heterohyrax

83

bucei and Procavia capensis) have been described as the reservoir of the zoonotic transmission of CL

84

in Ethiopia [4–6,13]. H. brucei is abundant in Ochollo and a large proportion has been found infected

85

with L. aethiopica. They live near human settlements, in caves and rock crevices, where sand flies

86

and other potential hosts are abundant [12,13]. Rodents were found most probably not to play a

87

role in transmission in Ochollo [13], but other animals have so far not been investigated yet as

88

carriers of L. aethiopica. Given that bovines are commonly bitten by the main CL vector in Ethiopia,

89

P. longipes, they could potentially serve as a reservoir as well [12,18,19].

90

Successful disease control requires profound understanding of the transmission cycle. Knowledge

91

about the blood meal preference of sand flies is crucial to demonstrate which vertebrates might

92

contribute to disease transmission and should be included in control programs. Moreover,

93

information on where and at what time sand flies are biting is a prerequisite to decide which vector

94

control methods should be applied.

95

In this study, we aimed to gather knowledge on (i) the blood meal sources of P. pedifer in different

96

habitats and its feeding preference when hosts are equally available, (ii) the role of domestic animals

97

in CL transmission, and (iii) the indoor and outdoor activity pattern of P. pedifer. This information

98

will shed light on the natural transmission cycle of CL in southwestern Ethiopia and help in

99

instructing control efforts in the area.

Ethics Statement

102

This study was reviewed, approved and monitored by the Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) of

103

Arba Minch University (cmhs/1203482/111 and cmhs/120017/111). Healthy adults (> 18 years) with

104

obvious scar formation, who have been living in Ochollo their whole life, were selected as subjects

105

for the human landing collections and host choice experiment. Written informed consent was

106

obtained from all human volunteers who participated. All animal handlings were carried out

107

according to the 2016 Guidelines of the American Society of Mammologists for use of mammals in

108

research and education and in agreement with the appropriate institutional authorities.

109

Study area

110

Ochollo is located in southwestern Ethiopia (6°11’N, 37° 41’ E), about 20 km North of Arba Minch

111

(Fig 1). It is a rocky area with steep slopes and basalt cliffs with caves, situated at an altitude ranging

112

between 1600 m and 2200 m. The area has a modest climate with an average yearly temperature

113

around 20°C and a high humidity from May until October [13]. The village covers approximately

114

1100 hectares and is divided into eight sub-villages, namely Shole-Kokuma, Zuza, Keya, Denkera,

115

Casha-Afilaketsa, Kancho, Abale-Mowale and Oddo. Ochollo is densely inhabited by approximately

116

5000 people, which are mainly clustered on the tops of hills and steep slopes. People ranch cattle

117

and goats, and some households have dogs. Hyraxes are abundant and live in caves and rocky areas

118

near human residences, while rodents mainly occupy stone fences and human and animal dwellings.

Host identification

124

Sand fly collection Sand flies were collected indoors and outdoors from 72 households (nine

125

households in each of the eight sub-villages) between February and May 2018. Additionally, ten

126

caves were selected in the village for monthly sand fly collections from March to June 2018.

127

Trapping was performed once per month at each sampling site with a particular entomological

128

approach. Indoors and in caves, one CDC miniature light trap (John W. Hock Company, Florida, USA)

129

and five sticky traps (ST, A4 format white papers attached to card board, covered with plastic

130

impregnated with sesame oil on both sides) were placed at the bed end and wall cracks indoors, and

131

inside caves. Collection with the two methods was performed on separate days. Only ST were

132

utilized outdoors (N = 5 per collection site), which were placed on wall cracks of the houses and

133

surrounding potential sand fly breeding or resting sites. Traps were set at 18h and collected again

134

the next morning at sunrise. Blood fed female sand flies were sorted out, and the thorax and

135

abdomen were dissected and stored in 97% ethanol at -20°C until further analysis. No distinction

136

was made among different stages of blood digestion in sand flies.

137

Blood meal analysis DNA isolation the blood fed specimens was performed with a NucleoSpin Tissue

138

kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the DNA

139

was eluted in 50µl nuclease free water. Unfed sand flies and sand flies fed on laboratory mice

140

(Lutzomyia longipalpis, acquired from the Laboratory of Microbiology, Parasitology and Hygiene,

141

University of Antwerp, Belgium) were respectively used as negative and positive extraction controls.

142

DNA extracts were subjected to a PCR targeting a fragment of the Cytochrome B gene (Cyt B, 359

143

bp) as described by Steuber et al. (2005) and Carvalho et al. (2017) [22,23]. In short, the 15µl

144

reaction mixture consisted of 1X Green GoTaq Flexi buffer (Promega, Leiden, Netherlands), 1.5mM

148

Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega, Leiden, Netherlands) and 1.5µl DNA template. Amplification was

149

carried out with an initial activation step of two minutes at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds

150

at 94°C, 30 seconds at 52°C and one minute at 72°C, and a final extension step of five minutes at

151

72°C. The PCR was performed on Biometra T professional gradient Thermocycler (Biometra,

152

Westburg, Netherlands). Positive and negative PCR controls and the above-mentioned extraction

153

controls were included in each of the PCR reactions. PCR results were visualized on a 1.5% gel. After

154

the PCR analyses were carried out at Arba Minch University in Ethiopia, the amplicons were sent to

155

the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) at the University of Antwerp in Belgium for

156

sequencing. The obtained Cyt B sequences were aligned in GenBank using BLAST to determine the

157

host species that served as a blood source. Results were only included when both query coverage

158

and identity exceeded 95%.

159

Sand fly species identification If the blood meal of a specimen was successfully identified, the sand

160

fly species was determined with a PCR targeting a 700 bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase

161

subunit I (COI) gene, as described by Kumar et al. (2012) and Pareyn et al. (2019) [13,24].

162

Livestock sample collection Ear and nose biopsy samples from livestock (bovines and goats) were

163

collected between January and April 2019. Samples originated either from animals that were

164

slaughtered for human consumption or live animals. For the latter collection method, Xylocaine 2%

165

gel (Astra Zeneca, Dilbeek, Belgium) was applied on the nose and ear for local anesthesia. Samples

166

were collected using a 3 mm Biopsy puncher (Henry Schein, Vilvoorde, Belgium) and stored in 97%

167

ethanol at -20°C until further analysis. To stop the bleeding, the incised skin wound was ligated with

168

skin glue. Between ear and nose biopsy collections of each animal, the puncher was cleansed with

169

1% bleach and rinsed in distilled water, and a new puncher was used for each animal.

170

Leishmania detection in livestock Nose and ear biopsies were screened for the presence of

171

Leishmania nucleic acids at Arba Minch University (Ethiopia). Samples of each animal were subjected

172

to a reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting Spliced-Leader (SL-)RNA. Additionally, a

173

selection of the samples (216/412) was also screened for the presence of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) to

174

confirm the results of the first assay. Nose and ear biopsy samples of each animal were pooled

175

before extraction. Both RNA and DNA were isolated from the selection of samples that were tested

176

by the two assays using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and NucleoSpin

177

RNA/DNA buffer set (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

178

For the remaining samples, only RNA isolation was carried out using solely the first method. A naive

179

and L. major infected mouse ear from an experimental infection (Laboratory of Microbiology,

180

Parasitology and Hygiene, University of Antwerp, Belgium; ethical approval UA ECD 2017-80) were

181

respectively used as negative and positive extraction controls. The SL-RNA and kDNA qPCR assays

182

were carried out as described previously by Eberhardt et al. and Pareyn et al. respectively [13,25].

183

Extracts were 1:10 diluted before addition to the reaction mixture to avoid inhibition. Each PCR run

184

included a no-template (negative) control and an infected (positive) control (a L. aethiopica infected

185

hyrax nose biopsy DNA/RNA extract). For positive animals, ear and nose tissue samples were

186

subjected to a separate extraction, followed by a PCR to determine the parasite RNA/DNA presence

187

in the different tissues.

188

Sand fly activity pattern

189

Human landing catches To assess the indoor and outdoor human biting rhythms of P. pedifer,

190

human landing catches (HLC) were conducted in and around four different household compounds

191

between March and August 2018. HLC were done once per month at each sampling site, indoors and

192

outdoors on the same day. Four collectors were used for each collection night, each working for six

193

hours. In the first part of the night (between 18h and 24h), one collector performed the HLC indoors

194

and one outdoors. In the second part of the night (24h until 6h), two other collectors carried out the

195

same activities. The person sitting outdoors was positioned at least 10 m from the house. The

196

collectors sat on chairs with only their legs exposed and sand flies that landed on their legs were

197

collected using a mouth aspirator. For each iteration of the experiment, there was an exchange in

198

pre- and post-midnight and indoor-outdoor shifts to compensate for individual differences in

199

attractiveness and collection skills. The collected specimens were cleared in Nesbitt’s solution,

200

washed with 70% ethanol and mounted in Hoyer’s medium. Sand flies were determined up to

201

species level with morphological identification keys [11,26].

202

CDC light trap captures Sand fly activity was also studied with CDC miniature light traps (John W.

203

Hock Company, Florida, USA) from January to March 2019. Sand flies were captured during eight

204

trapping sessions in a cave, which was previously determined as a hotspot of P. pedifer [13]. Traps

205

were placed between 18h and 18h30 and collections were performed with an interval of 75 minutes

206

until about 1h, eventually resulting in five collections per night. Sand flies were collected with a

207

mouth aspirator and the number of male and female sand flies was recorded to establish the hourly

208

activity of the sand flies. Captured sand flies were later used for the host choice experiment.

209

Host choice experiment

210

A host choice experiment was carried out using the sand flies that were captured with CDC light

211

traps for the sand fly activity assessment. Additional sand flies were trapped in other surrounding

212

caves in Ochollo with CDC miniature light traps (John W. Hock Company, Florida, USA) in order to

213

increase the sample size. The experiment was performed at 2h, immediately after the hourly CDC

214

light trap captures.

215

The experimental set-up consisted of three connected cages (Fig 2). Female non-fed sand flies were

216

placed in the middle cage. In each of the lateral cages, a particular host served as a blood meal

217

source: a human volunteer’s hand and a hyrax. Hyraxes were trapped by local people using

218

traditional trapping methods. They were sedated during the experiment with ketamine (10mg/kg

219

intramuscularly; Verve Human Care Laboratories, Uttarakhand, India) and placed inside the cage

220

exposing the nose, ears and forepaws to the sand flies. Their eyes were protected from sand fly bites

221

with a napkin. Human volunteers were positioned with their head nearby the cage for CO2

222

attractiveness towards the sand flies. The experimental set-up was covered by a plastic canvas to

223

avoid interference of wind and other potential feeding sources in the surroundings.

224

Fig 2: Host choice experiment set-up. Female non-fed sand flies captured from caves were transferred to the

225

middle cage, where they were left for 30 minutes to adapt. Then, the connecting tubes to the lateral cages,

226

where a hyrax and human hand were exposed, were opened to allow sand flies to obtain their preferred blood

227

meal during four hours. The hosts themselves and their places were changed for each iteration of the

228

experiment.

229

After 30 minutes adaptation in the middle cage, the connecting tubes to the two lateral cages were

230

opened for four hours to allow sand flies to bite their preferred host. Blood fed sand flies were

231

collected using a mouth aspirator and stored in 97% ethanol at -20°C until further analysis. The

232

experiment was conducted eight times and for each iteration, the position of the hosts was changed

233

and new subjects were used. Hyraxes were released at their trapping site after the experiment. The

234

blood meal sources and sand fly species were determined by sequencing a fragment of the Cyt B and

235

COI gene respectively, according to the methods described above (blood meal analysis and sand fly

236

identification).

237

Data analysis

238

All statistical analyses were carried out in R version 3.5.0, using packages “lme4” and “lmerTest”

239

[27,28]. P-values < 0.05 were assumed statistically significant.

240

Sand fly blood meal sources To assess which host group served as an important blood meal source

241

for sand flies, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with Poisson error distribution was used.

242

The number of sand flies that fed on a particular host, within a specific habitat, during a certain

243

month was included as the response variable. The habitat where sand flies were captured (indoors,

244

outdoors, cave), the host group they acquired their blood meal from and the interaction between

245

habitat and host type were included as fixed effects. In order to correct for monthly variation in sand

246

fly presence, we incorporated the collection as a random effect in the model. A post hoc test,

247

specified as Tukey test, was applied to compare the hosts groups with each other [29].

available under aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

248

After the previous general model, GLMMs were made similarly for each habitat separately to

249

determine the important blood meal sources in each habitat. The model was constructed as

250

described above, but only the host group was included as a fixed variable.

251

Sand fly activity The sand fly human biting rhythms indoors and outdoors were measured with HLC.

252

We had to transform our data to a binomial distribution (0 = no sand flies were caught within an

253

hourly time interval, 1 = one or more sand flies were captured within a time interval), because the

254

hourly counts were low. A GLMM was used with the HLC at each time interval as the dependent

255

variable with a binomial error distribution. The location where sand flies were trapped

256

(indoor/outdoor) was included as a fixed effect in order to assess if sand flies bite significantly more

257

indoors compared to outdoors. Time interval was included as a fixed effect to compare at which

258

moment sand flies were mostly active. We used the time interval as a categorical variable instead of

259

continuous, because our preliminary analyses showed that there was a non-linear correlation. The

260

trapping month and sampling site were incorporated as random effects in the model.

261

Sand fly activity was based on the number of captured sand flies with a CDC light trap. A GLMM with

262

Poisson error distribution was used to estimate the sand fly activity. Due to technical difficulties, we

263

were not able to include the fifth trapping night in the final dataset. The number of male and female

264

sand flies at a certain time interval was used as the dependent variable. Sex was implemented as a

265

fixed effect in the model to assess whether there were more males or females. Time interval was

266

included as a categorical fixed effect to determine during which period most individuals were

267

present. The experiment day was incorporated as a random effect to correct for potential

268

differences between the sampling days.

269

Host choice experiment A GLMM with binomial distribution was used to determine the preferred

270

blood meal source of sand flies when both humans and hyraxes are available. The proportion of

271

Results

278

Sand fly blood meal sources

279

A total of 368 blood fed female sand flies were collected, which underwent procedures for blood

280

meal origin identification. 92 (25.0%) of these samples were excluded from the analysis, as negative

281

extraction controls tested positive, indicating contamination during the DNA isolation procedure.

282

The Cyt B gene could not be amplified for 11 samples (3.0%) and the sequence identity of 83

283

samples (22.6%) could not be determined using the previously set cut-off requirements for the

284

BLAST analysis. The overall analysis resulted in successful blood meal identification for 182 (49.5%)

285

specimens. All of these specimens, except for two, turned out to be P. pedifer. The other two

286

matched with several Phlebotomus Laroussius sand fly species in GenBank with low query coverage

287

and identity, but could not be identified up to species level. One sand fly acquired its blood meal

288

from a human and the other one from a bush hyrax.

289

A total of 180 P. pedifer sand flies fed on 12 different hosts, presented in Table 1. Overall, humans

290

were the most important blood meal source (p < 0.001), accounting for 59.4% of the identified

291

origins, followed by bovines (13.9%), bush hyraxes (10.6%), goats (7.2%) and rodents (5.0%).

292

Residual blood meals were acquired from a wide variety of vertebrates, together covering 4.0% of

293

the determined sources. From the sand flies that fed on humans, five out of 137 (two collected from

294

caves and three from indoors) were positive for Leishmania kDNA.

Indoors, 129 blood fed sand flies were collected (Fig 3A). Significantly more sand flies (65.9%, p <

300

0.001) had fed on humans (S1 Table) compared to 23.3% that fed on livestock (16.3% on bovines and

301

7.0% on goats) and 5.4% on rodents. Three of the sand flies that were captured indoors had

302

acquired their blood meal from hyraxes.

bovines and goats and the category rodents consists of Acomys spp., Grammomys sp. and Arvicanthis sp.. The

306

‘other’ host group includes all other vertebrates that sand flies fed on (Table 1).

307

No significant difference in blood meal sources could be determined from the 18 sand flies that were

308

captured outdoors (Fig 3B, S1 Table), but the most important origins were again humans (38.9%) and

309

livestock (33.3%).

310

In caves, 33 sand flies were blood fed, which mainly acquired their blood meal more from humans

311

(45.5%) and hyraxes (42.4%), although the numbers were not significantly different from the other

312

three groups (Fig 3C, S1 Table).

selection of the samples that were subjected to both kDNA and SL-RNA assays were all negative. The

317

pooled sample of one live goat was positive for SL-RNA. After separate tissue extractions of this

318

goat, the nose sample appeared positive for kDNA and SL-RNA, with a Ct value of approximately 28

319

in both assays.

320

Sand fly activity

321

Human landing catches A total of 161 sand flies were captured with HLC, of which 93% were

322

identified as P. pedifer, while the remaining 7% belonged to the subgenus Sergentomyia, which were

323

removed from further analysis.

324

P. pedifer was found to bite humans both indoors and outdoors, but the overall the probability of

325

indoor biting was significantly higher (p = 0.003, Fig 4A).

329

the response variable.

330

Sand fly collections showed a similar temporal biting pattern indoors and outdoors (p = 0.912, Fig

331

4B). There was a substantial probability of sand fly biting in the early evening, which increased

332

during the night, reaching a its maximum around midnight. After that, a drop was observed, with the

333

lowest biting probability just before sunrise. Although Fig 4B shows a clear pattern in the activity,

334

comparison of the biting activity at the different time intervals provided no significant differences

335

between neighboring intervals (S2 Table).

336

CDC light trap captures A total of 821 sand flies were captured with CDC light traps during seven

337

trapping nights, of which 711 were female and 110 male. The hourly activity pattern of female and

338

male sand flies is depicted in Fig 5. Significantly more female than male sand flies were captured (p <

339

0.001). The activity of female sand flies between 19h-20h was significantly lower compared to the

340

other hours, except for 24h-1h (S3 Table). Other time intervals were not significantly different from

341

each other. Overall, the activity pattern of female sand flies shows that there was considerable

342

activity in the early evening, which increased over time, reaching its maximum at 22h-23h. For male

343

sand flies, no clear trend could be distinguished.

Host preference

348

A total of 716 female P. pedifer sand flies were used in the host choice experiment, of which in total

349

65 sand flies were found blood fed over the eight repeats of the experiment (S4 Table).

350

The Cyt B fragment was successfully amplified and sequenced for all freshly engorged sand flies. All

351

sand flies included in the experiment were P. pedifer. Fig 6 shows that sand flies were biting both

352

hosts, but significantly more sand flies fed on hyraxes (61.5%) than on humans (38.5%, p = 0.009).

353

The position of the host had no effect on the host choice (p = 0.776).

357

Discussion

358

We gathered novel insights in the biting behavior and activity of P. pedifer and the role of livestock

359

in transmission of CL in southwestern Ethiopia, which can be used as a guidance in disease control

360

programs.

361

We identified the blood meal sources of sand flies in Ochollo indoors, outdoors and in caves. Sand

362

flies acquired their blood meals from hosts of 12 different genera, which is a wider variety compared

363

to the results of Ashford et al. (1973) from Ochollo, who found only hyraxes and humans as blood

364

meal sources in caves and indoors [12]. This may be linked to our larger sample size and the

365

availability of more sophisticated analysis methods.

366

Overall, the majority of sand flies fed on humans and 3.6% of these sand flies were Leishmania DNA

367

positive. Additionally, previous research showed that there is a high infection prevalence in humans

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856187; this version posted November 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

368

in Ochollo and that L. aethiopica transmission from a human CL lesion to P. pedifer is very efficient

369

[8,14]. These combined data suggest that humans are probably more than just an accidental host in

370

the transmission cycle [8,14,19]. On the contrary, only 10.6% of the sand fly blood meals were

371

derived from hyraxes and none of these sand flies were found kDNA positive. This is an interesting

372

result, since we recently documented that 20% (5/25) of the hyraxes captured in Ochollo were

373

Leishmania DNA positive [13]. Although CL in Ethiopia has only been reported as zoonotic with

374

hyraxes serving as the only reservoir host [5,6,19,30], this study demonstrates that there is very

375

likely also anthroponotic transmission in southwestern Ethiopia. Hence, control should focus on

376

humans, whether or not with additional reservoir control. Notably, the kDNA positive blood fed sand

377

flies should be interpreted with care, because sand flies could have been infected before the current

378

blood meal was acquired.

379

Some sand flies fed on rodents, in particular on different spiny mouse species (Acomys spp.), thicket

380

rat (Grammomys sp.) and grass rat (Arvicanthis sp.). Several researchers have focused already on

381

rodents as potential reservoirs of CL in Ethiopia. In a previous study that we carried out in Ochollo

382

(2019), only a single African pigmy mouse (Mus mahomet) out of 192 rodents of eight different

383

species was found kDNA positive. Despite the large trapping effort in that study, Acomys and

384

Grammomys spp. were not captured [13]. In another study carried out all over Ethiopia by Kassahun

385

and his colleagues (2015), 141 Acomys spp. were collected, of which 14 (9.9%) were found kDNA

386

positive and three of these could be further identified as L. tropica infections [31]. A giant rat

387

(Cricetomys sp.) and a ground squirrel (Xerus rutilus) have been found naturally infected with L.

388

aethiopica. The latter was found in Aba Roba (1200 m), a visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic area in

389

Ethiopia, where human CL cases have never been reported [32,33]. Except these observations, L.

390

aethiopica has to our knowledge never been found in rodents before, despite the various sampling

391

efforts that have been undertaken previously [5,12,33,34]. This suggests that rodents are probably

392

not a reservoir for L. aethiopica and hence do not play an important role in the transmission

393

dynamics.

394

Acomys spp. in Ethiopia are known to inhabit rocky slopes and rock crevices, but in our study, five

395

out of six sand flies that fed on this species were found indoors [35]. Likewise, three sand flies that

396

were captured indoors had fed on hyraxes. This result suggests that sand flies might rest indoors

397

after have taken their blood meal elsewhere, which could be further investigated with i.e.

398

fluorescent powder on sand fly wings to demonstrate their dispersal [36,37].

399

Remarkably, the blood meal analysis from cave collected sand flies demonstrated that sand flies

400

feed on humans as much as on hyraxes, while hyraxes are abundant and live inside the caves. This

401

could be interpreted as an increased preference for biting humans. We tested this by a host choice

402

experiment, in which human and hyrax were both available. Surprisingly, while sand flies do feed on

403

both hosts, there was a significant preference for hyraxes, which contradicts the previous

404

hypothesis. The result that humans are equally dominant as hyraxes as sand fly host meals in caves

405

is probably not due to blood meal preference, but potentially to an increased availability of humans

406

during the peak sand fly activity hours. Previously, Ashford et al. recommended complete hyrax

407

elimination by shooting or biological control, such as release of predators [38]. Other researchers

408

suggested hyrax elimination near human settlements (about 1 km) as a possible intervention against

409

L. aethiopica transmission [30,39]. This rises the concern that P. pedifer's preferred blood meal host

410

would not be available anymore, resulting in a shift towards biting humans, thereby increasing their

411

exposure to sand fly bites and accordingly their risk of infection. A study of Svobodova et al. (2006)

412

showed that asymptomatically infected hyraxes were infectious to P. arabicus, but with a low

413

success rate [40]. Additional research remains necessary to establish the transmission efficiency of

414

parasites from infected hyraxes to the current vector to deliberate whether elimination of hyraxes

415

should be included in control programs. The fact that that sand flies captured from caves obtained a

416

similar proportion of blood meals from humans as from hyraxes implies that humans are accessible

417

as blood source in proximity to the hyrax habitats.

418

Many specimens in the blood meal analysis did not provide a successful PCR or sequence according

419

to the previously set requirements, while host sequences could be determined from all freshly fed

420

sand flies in the host choice experiment. It has been shown that the success rate of host DNA

421

analysis is negatively correlated with the time-course after the blood meal was taken [15,41–43]. We

422

did not record the estimated days post-feeding, but sand flies with partially digested blood were

423

included in the blood meal analysis, which explains the success rate of the blood meal analysis.

424

To unravel the complex CL cycle in southwestern Ethiopia, it is important to assess all players of

425

transmission. This study demonstrates that livestock accounts for 21.1% of the blood meal sources

426

of P. pedifer, but in ear and nose biopsies from goats and bovines, we found only a single goat nose

427

biopsy positive for kDNA and SL-RNA with a high Ct value. This points to a relatively low, but viable

428

parasitemia, although persistence and transmission of the parasites are not guaranteed [25].

429

Overall, it should be considered that some animals in the current study might have had parasites in

430

their skin, which remained undetected due to the collection of only a small tissue biopsy [44].

431

Studies have already found DNA or antibodies indicating the presence of VL parasites in livestock,

432

also in northern Ethiopia [45–48]. Research investigating the role of livestock in CL transmission is

433

rather scarce. A study conducted during a CL outbreak in a non-endemic village in Venezuela found

434

suspected active CL lesions in seven out of 29 (24%) donkeys in hairless areas (ear, tail, etc.), of

435

which six lesion samples contained Leishmania parasites [49]. In a similar research conducted in a CL

436

endemic area in Kenya, one goat was found with lesions and detectable levels of L. aethiopica DNA

437

in the skin and other organs [50].

438

Based on our results, gathered from a large sample size collected from areas with different

439

ecological features and screened with highly sensitive assays, we conclude that domestic animals in

440

similar ecological areas in southwestern Ethiopia are likely not to play a considerable role in

441

transmission. However, many sand flies acquired their blood meal from these animals and it was

442

observed that livestock is living close to or even inside human settlements in Ochollo. It has been

443

suggested to keep livestock close to human settlements to divert vector biting from humans

444

(zooprophylaxis) or to use them as baits for vector attraction to insecticide-treated livestock [51–

445

54]. In contrast, other researchers assert that this could increase the vector population near humans

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856187; this version posted November 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

446

(zoopotentiation) or augment the vector infectivity if blood meal sources are readily available

447

[46,52,54,55]. More research is necessary to determine whether domestic animals could serve as

448

protection against contraction of leishmaniasis.

449

Understanding the vector’s biting behavior gives an indication about when and where Leishmania

450

transmission occurs, and at which time and place control strategies would be most effective. Both

451

activity experiments showed that sand flies are predominantly active around midnight and the

452

majority of the sand flies were captured indoors with HLC. Therefore, insecticide-treated bed nets or

453

indoor residual spraying are potentially effective control strategies to manage the peak transmission

454

at night [56–59]. Considerable activity was also observed in the early evening with about 30% of the

455

sand flies captured outdoors by HLC. During the fieldwork, children were collecting water near caves

456

and rock crevices and adults were performing outdoor activities in the early evening (e.g. dinner

457

preparation and washing), thereby increasing their risk of exposure to potentially infectious sand fly

458

bites. This was also shown in a study by Sang et al. in a CL endemic area in Kenya, where almost all

459

CL cases admitted that they often visit caves [60]. Hence, improvement of community knowledge

460

and attempts to decrease the vector population densities near places of outdoor activity could

461

contribute to a reduction of residual transmission [61].

462

The activity of the CL vectors in Ethiopia has never been studied so far, but similar studies were

463

carried out on P. orientalis in different VL foci in northern Ethiopia and Sudan [62–67]. These studies

464

found various activity patterns for this vector species, indicating that the activity of a single species

465

can differ between regions. Research on sand fly behavior in each ecologically different setting is

466

accordingly necessary to accomplish efficient vector control.

467

This study shows that sand flies in Ochollo mainly feed on humans and that there is likely also

468

anthroponotic transmission of L. aethiopica. Hyraxes are the preferred blood meal source when

469

hosts are equally accessible, so the efficiency of parasite transmission from H. brucei to P. pedifer

470

should be investigated before including them in control programs. Livestock appears an important

471

blood meal source for sand flies, but does probably not play a significant role in transmission of CL in

473

outdoor activity, suggesting that combined measures are required for efficient disease control.
