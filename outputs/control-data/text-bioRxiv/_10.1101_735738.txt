ABSTRACT

20

Recent transcriptional profiling technologies are uncovering
previously-undefined cell populations and molecular markers at an unprecedented pace. While single cell RNA
(scRNA) sequencing is an attractive approach for unbiased
transcriptional profiling of all cell types, a complementary
method to isolate and sequence specific cell populations from
heterogeneous tissue remains challenging. Here, we developed Probe-Seq, which allows deep transcriptional profiling
of specific cell types isolated using RNA as the defining feature. Dissociated cells are labelled using fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) for RNA, and then isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). We used Probe-Seq to purify and profile specific cell types from mouse, human, and
chick retinas, as well as the Drosophila midgut. Probe-Seq
is compatible with frozen nuclei, making cell types within
archival tissue immediately accessible. As it can be multiplexed, combinations of markers can be used to create specificity. Multiplexing also allows for the isolation of multiple
cell types from one cell preparation. Probe-Seq should enable RNA profiling of specific cell types from any organism.

Multicellular eukaryotic tissues often comprise many different cell types, commonly classified using their morphological features, physiological function, anatomical location, and/or
molecular markers. For example, the retina, a thin sheet of neural tissue in the eye that transmits visual information to the brain,
contains seven major cell classes - rods, cones, bipolar cells
(BC), amacrine cells (AC), horizontal cells (HC), Müller glia
(MG), and retinal ganglion cells (RGC), first defined primarily
using morphology1,2 . More recently, scRNA profiling technologies have led to the appreciation of many subtypes of these major cell classes, bringing the total number of retinal cell types
close to 1003-5 . Such accelerated discovery of cellular diversity
is not unique to the retina, as scRNA profiling is being carried
out in many tissues and organisms6-8 .
Several approaches have been used to transcriptionally profile tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing of whole tissues can be done
at great depth, but does not capture the diversity of individual
transcriptomes and often fails to reflect signatures of rare cell
types. Currently, bulk sequencing of specific cell types is limited

by the availability of cell type-specific promoters, enhancers,
dyes, or antigens for their isolation9-14 . This has limited bulk
RNA sequencing primarily to select cell types in geneticallytractable organisms. Single cell and single nucleus RNA sequencing methods have allowed for the recording of transcriptional states of many individual cells simultaneously3,5,15-18 . Despite the undeniable appeal of scRNA sequencing, capturing
deep profiles of specific cell populations in bulk can be sufficient or preferable for many experiments, e.g. when the goal is
to understand the results of perturbations.
We and others have used antibodies to enable FACSbased isolation for transcriptional profiling of specific cell
populations11,19-23 . However, antibodies are frequently unavailable for a specific cell type. Furthermore, marker proteins in certain cell types such as neurons are often localized to processes
that are lost during cellular dissociation. We therefore aimed to
create a method that would leverage the newly discovered RNA
expression patterns for the isolation of specific cell populations
from any organism. This led us to develop Probe-Seq, which
uses a FISH method based upon a new probe design, Serial Amplification By Exchange Reaction (SABER)24 . Probe-Seq uses
RNA markers expressed in specific cell types to label cells for
isolation by FACS and subsequent transcriptional profiling. Although specific cells cultured in vitro have been successfully labelled by FISH for isolation using FACS, this method had not
yet been tested for tissue25-27 . We used Probe-Seq to isolate
rare bipolar cells from the mouse retina, cell types that were
previously defined using scRNA sequencing5 . We demonstrate
that probe sets for multiple genes can be hybridized at once,
allowing isolation of multiple cell types simultaneously. Moreover, the fluorescent oligonucleotides used to detect the probe
sets can be quickly hybridized and then stripped. This enables
isolation of an indefinite number of cell types from one sample by serial sorting and re-labeling. We extended Probe-Seq
to specific bipolar cell subtypes in frozen archival human retina
by labeling nuclear RNA. To further test the utility of ProbeSeq in non-vertebrate animals and non-CNS tissues, we profiled
intestinal stem cells from the Drosophila gut. In each of these
experiments, the transcriptional profiles of isolated populations
closely matched those obtained by scRNA sequencing, and in
most cases, the number of genes detected exceeded 10,000. Finally, we used Probe-Seq on the chick retina, an organism that
is difficult to genetically manipulate, to determine the transcrip-

end reads to be able to reliably detect low abundance transcripts. The average 3’ bias for the mapped reads for all samples
was 0.74±0.02, which corresponds to a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 2-429 , indicating mild degradation of RNA. Unbiased hierarchical clustering showed that samples of the same
cell population clustered together (average Pearson correlation
between samples within population: r = 0.93) (Supplementary
Figure 1). The three populations were then analyzed for differential expression (DE). Between each population, the frequency
distribution of all p-values showed an even distribution of null
p-values, thus allowing for calculation of adjusted p-value using
the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Supplementary Figure 1).
Between Grik1- and Grik1+ populations, we found 1,740 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value < 0.05) out of 17,649
genes (Supplementary Figure 1). The high number of genes
detected indicates successful bulk RNA sequencing of low abundance transcripts.

Specific bipolar cell subtypes can be isolated and profiled
from the mouse retina using Probe-Seq
To determine whether Probe-Seq can enable the isolation and
profiling of specific cell types based on FISH labeling, we
tested it using the mouse retina. The retina is a highly heterogeneous tissue, with cell classes and subtypes classified by
scRNA sequencing, as well as more classical methods2 . We
used a new method for FISH, SABER-FISH, to label the intracellular RNA24 . SABER-FISH uses OligoMiner to design
20-40 nt tiling oligonucleotides that are complementary to the
RNA species of interest and are optimized for minimal off-target
binding. The tiling oligonucleotides are pooled to generate a
gene-specific probe set. Each probe set is then extended using
a primer exchange reaction28 , which appends many copies of a
short-repeated sequence to each tiling oligonucleotide in the set.
These concatemer sequences can be made unique for each probe
set. The concatemers are detected by the hybridization of short
fluorescent oligonucleotides.
To isolate specific BC subtypes, fresh adult mouse retinas
were dissociated, fixed, and permeabilized prior to FISH labeling (Figure 1a). We designed gene-specific probe sets against
Vsx2, a marker of all BCs and MG, and Grik1, a marker of
BC2, BC3A, BC3B, and BC4 subtypes (∼2% of all retinal
cells)5 (Figure 1b). Vsx2 and Grik1 probe sets were hybridized
to the dissociated retinal cells overnight at 43◦ C, and fluorescent oligonucleotides were subsequently hybridized to the genespecific probe sets. By FACS, single cells were identified by
gating for a single peak of Hoechst+ events, while debris and
doublets were excluded (Figure 1c). Out of these single cells,
the Vsx2+ population was judged to be the cells that shifted
away from the diagonal Vsx2- events (Figure 1c). Out of the
Vsx2+ population, we found three populations that were Grik1- ,
Grik1MID , and Grik1HI . Based upon scRNA sequencing of BC
subtypes, Grik1MID likely corresponded to BC2, and Grik1HI
to BC3A, BC3B, and BC45 . We isolated both Grik1MID and
Grik1HI (henceforth called Grik1+ ) cells as well as Vsx2+ /Grik1(henceforth called Grik1- ) and Vsx2- cell populations. We expected the Grik1+ population to contain BC2-BC4, the Grik1population to contain other BC subtypes and MG, and the
Vsx2- population to contain non-BC/MG cell types (Figure 1d).
The isolated populations displayed the expected FISH puncta
(Figure 1e). On average, we isolated 200,000±0 Vsx2- cells,
96,000±18,600 Grik1- cells, and 22,000±1,000 Grik1+ cells per
biological replicate, with each replicate originating from 2 retinas. These results indicate that gene-specific SABER-FISH can
label dissociated cell populations for isolation by FACS.
To determine whether the isolated populations corresponded
to the expected cell types, we reversed the crosslinking and extracted the RNA from these cells. SMART-Seq v.4 cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced on NextSeq 500. Each
sample was sequenced to a mean of 15±3 million 75 bp paired-

To determine which retinal cell types were enriched in the
isolated populations, we cross-referenced the DE gene set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) to retinal cell class-specific markers
identified by Drop-Seq (see Methods for details of gene set
curation)3 . We saw that the Vsx2- population was enriched for
markers of all cell classes except for BCs and MG (Supplementary Figure 2), as expected from the expression pattern
of Vsx25 . The Grik1- population was enriched for most BC
and MG markers, while the Grik1+ population was enriched for
a subset of BC markers (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between Vsx2and Grik1- populations indicated significant enrichment of rod,
cone, AC, HC, and RGC markers in the Vsx2- populations and
BC and MG markers in the Grik1- population (default significance at FDR < 0.25; Enrichment in Vsx2- population: Rod:
FDR < 0.001; Cone: FDR < 0.001; AC: FDR < 0.001; HC:
FDR = 0.174; RGC: FDR = 0.224; Enrichment in Grik1- population: BC: FDR < 0.001; MG: FDR < 0.001).
To determine which BC subtypes were enriched in the
Grik1- and Grik1+ populations, we cross-referenced the DE
gene set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) to BC subtype specific markers identified by scRNA sequencing5 . We found that the majority of BC2, BC3A, BC3B, and BC4 markers were enriched
in the Grik1+ population as expected, and all other BC subtype
markers were highly expressed in the Grik1- population (Figure 1f). GSEA between Grik1- and Grik1+ populations confirmed these results (Enrichment in Grik1+ population: BC2:
FDR < 0.001; BC3A: FDR = 0.005; BC3B: FDR < 0.001; BC4:
FDR < 0.001; Enrichment in Grik1- population: BC1B: FDR
= 0.132; BC5A: FDR = 0.135; BC5C: FDR = 0.136; BC5D:
FDR = 0.172; BC6: FDR = 0.145; BC7: FDR = 0.169; BC8/9:
FDR = 0.174; RBC: FDR < 0.001). From the DE analysis, we
also identified the top 20 most DE genes that were specific to a
cell population (Supplementary Figure 3). We confirmed the
expression of Tpbgl, a previously uncharacterized transcript, in
Grik1+ cells by SABER FISH in retinal tissue sections (Supplementary Figure 3). These results indicate that the cell populations isolated and profiled by Probe-Seq correspond to the
expected BC subtypes.
We next aimed to determine the relative quality of the transcriptomes obtained by Probe-Seq versus those obtained from

freshly dissociated cells. To this end, we electroporated the
Grik1CRM4 -GFP reporter plasmid into the developing retina at
P2. We previously showed that 72% of GFP+ cells were Grik1+
using this reporter24 . At P40, the retinas were harvested, and
the electroporated region was dissociated into a single cell suspension. GFP+ cells were FACS isolated into Trizol (henceforth
called Live cells). Simultaneously, cells from the unelectroporated region from the same retina were used for Probe-Seq of
Grik1+ cells (henceforth called Probe-Seq cells). On average,
836±155 Live cells (n=3) and 10,000±0 Probe-Seq cells (n=3),
were collected for transcriptional analysis. A strong correlation
of expression levels of all genes between Live and Probe-Seq
cells was seen (average Pearson correlation r = 0.78±0.01) (Figure 1g). Since 72% of the GFP+ population in the Live cell
population were expected to be Grik1+ cells, we expected that
the correlation for markers of BC2-BC4 to be approximately
0.72. Notably, when analyzing only the subtype-specific markers, the correlation was 0.66 between Live and Probe-Seq cells,
with enrichment of these markers in the Probe-Seq population
(Figure 1g). Therefore, expression of GFP in Grik1- cells using
the Grik1CRM4 -GFP reporter plasmid could explain, at least partially, the discrepancy between the Probe-Seq and Live cell populations. Accordingly, DE analysis between these two populations indicated enrichment of rod, cone, and MG markers, as evidenced by high expression of marker genes (i.e. Rho, Opn1mw,
and Apoe) in the Live cell population (Figure 1g). Despite the
imperfect match in the cellular compositions of these two preparations, the strong correlation between the transcriptomes obtained by Probe-Seq and traditional live cell sorting indicates
that high quality transcriptomes can be obtained by this method.

ing of seven retinal cell classes using three cycles of FISH.
After each round of imaging, the fluorescent oligonucleotides
are stripped using conditions that do not strip the gene-specific
probe sets, allowing fluorescent channels to be reused for detection of different genes in the same cells. To determine
whether serial multiplexing is feasible with Probe-Seq, dissociated mouse retinal cells were incubated with three gene-specific
probe sets for Gad1, Vsx2, and Grm6 (Figure 1i). For the first
round of flow cytometry, the fluorescent oligonucleotides for detecting Gad1 and Vsx2 were applied. These were assayed by
flow cytometry and then stripped using 50% formamide. The
removal of the fluorescent oligonucleotides was confirmed by
the lack of signal in a subsequent round of flow cytometry (Figure 1i). We then applied the fluorescent oligonucleotides for
Grm6 and were able to detect a new population of cells from
the same cellular pool. These results indicate that serial multiplexed Probe-Seq can allow detection of multiple cell types in
the same cell preparation with iterative rounds of hybridization
and FACS.
Probe-Seq enables isolation and RNA sequencing of cell
type-specific nuclei from frozen postmortem human tissue
To determine whether Probe-Seq will allow one to access the
transcriptomes of the many archived human tissue samples, we
tested the method on frozen human retinas. Nuclear preparations were made, as whole cell approaches to frozen cells are
not feasible30,31 . The initial test was carried out on frozen mouse
retinas. Nuclei were extracted by Dounce homogenization, fixed
with 4% PFA, and labeled by a gene-specific probe set for Grik1
(Supplementary Figure 5). Grik1HI (not Grik1MID ) and Grik1populations were isolated by FACS, the nuclear RNA was extracted, and the cDNA was sequenced. We cross-referenced the
DE gene set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) to BC subtype specific
markers and found that the majority of mouse BC3A, BC3B,
and BC4 markers were enriched in the Grik1+ population, as expected, and all other BC subtype markers were highly expressed
in the Grik1- population (Supplementary Figure 5). These results indicate that cell type-specific nuclear RNA from frozen
tissue can be isolated by Probe-Seq.
We thus obtained fresh-frozen human retinas (age range: 40
60; see Methods for full description of samples), and aimed to
isolate and profile human BC subtypes using a probe set for
GRM6, which is expressed in cone ON bipolar cells and rod
bipolar cells (RBC) in the mouse and human retina5,32 (Figure
2a). To test the GRM6 probe set in human retinas, it was first applied to a fixed human tissue section, where signal was observed
in the expected pattern, in a subset of cells in the inner nuclear
layer, where BCs reside (Figure 2b). Nuclei were extracted
from frozen human peripheral retinas, fixed, and incubated with
the GRM6 probe set. The GRM6- and GRM6+ nuclei were then
isolated by FACS after application of the fluorescent oligonucleotides (Figure 2c). On average, 43,000±35,500 GRM6- nuclei and 1,800±781 GRM6+ nuclei were isolated from approximately 5 mm x 5 mm square of the retina per biological replicate
(Figure 2d). SMART-Seq v.4 cDNA libraries were sequenced
on NextSeq 500, with each sample sequenced to a mean depth
of 18±3 million 75 bp paired-end reads. The average 3’ bias for
the mapped reads of the negative population was 0.70±0.04, indicating slight degradation of RNA. Quality control of the read

We next sought to investigate the parameters for SABER
probe sets that are important for successful FACS isolation. We
reasoned that the ability to resolve a targeted cell from the total
cell population would be dependent upon the total number of fluorescent probes in that cell, which can be increased by targeting
more tiling oligonucleotides to each transcript, or by targeting
more abundant RNA species. To investigate these parameters,
we generated three gene-specific probe sets, for Grik1, Grm6,
and Neto1, which exhibit high-to-low levels of gene expression based upon FISH analysis in retina tissue sections (Number of puncta per positive cell: Grik1: 37; Grm6: 20; Neto1:
6.5) (Supplementary Figure 4). For each gene-specific probe
set, 48, 24, or 12 randomly-chosen tiling oligonucleotides were
pooled for extension. These were then used for Probe-Seq, and
the fluorescent signals from the FACS were analyzed to calculate the Stain Index (SI; see Methods for calculation of SI). This
allowed for quantification of the separation of the positive population from the negative population. The SI was found to decrease with the reduced number of tiling oligonucleotides and
the level of expression of each gene (Figure 1h). However,
with an SI cutoff of 2, 12 tiling oligonucleotides were sufficient
for confidence in the separation of gene-positive and negative
populations, demonstrating that short transcripts or few tiling
oligonucleotides can be used successfully for Probe-Seq.
To label multiple cell types, or cellular states, it is often necessary to use a combination of gene-specific probe sets. Serial detection of markers has been achieved using SABER-FISH
(Exchange-SABER). Exchange-SABER has enabled the label4

and DE analysis (Supplementary Figure 6). Upon filtering out
genes with zero counts in more than 4 samples, 1,956 out of
9,619 genes were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value <
0.05).
We compared the DE gene set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) to
human retinal cell type-specific markers identified by scRNA
sequencing32 . We found an enrichment of markers for RBCs
and ON BCs in the GRM6+ population (Figure 2e). GSEA between GRM6- and GRM6+ confirmed these results (Enrichment
in GRM6+ population: RBC: FDR = 0.003; ON BC-1: FDR =
0.181; ON BC-2: FDR = 0.126), indicating that the expected human retinal populations were accurately isolated. We validated
the expression of CDH12, a transcript highly enriched in the
GRM6+ population, but previously not reported to be a marker
of these subtypes, by performing SABER FISH on fixed adult
human retina sections (Figure 2f). These results show that nuclear transcripts isolated from frozen tissue by Probe-Seq are

sufficient for transcriptional profiling.
Isolation and transcriptional profiling of intestinal stem cells
from the Drosophila midgut
To determine whether Probe-Seq can be successfully applied to
non-CNS cells, and to cells from invertebrates, we applied the
method to the midgut of Drosophila melanogaster. The adult
Drosophila midgut is composed of four major cell types - enterocytes (EC), enteroendocrine cells (EE), enteroblasts (EB),
and intestinal stem cells (ISC), though recent profiling studies
have revealed heterogeneity among ECs and ISC/EBs33,34 . We
aimed to isolate ISCs and EBs using a gene-specific probe set
for escargot (esg), a well-characterized marker for these cell
types (Figure 3a). As SABER-FISH had not yet been tested on
Drosophila tissue, we first tested this method on wholemounts
of the Drosophila gut. SABER FISH signal was observed in the
appropriate pattern, in a subset of midgut cells (Figure 3b). To
perform Probe-Seq, we dissociated 35-40 Drosophila midguts

per biological replicate, fixed in 4% PFA, and incubated the cells
with the esg probe set. FACS was then used to sort esg- and esg+
populations (Figure 3c-d). As only the 2N single cells were
sorted, proliferating ISCs and polyploid ECs were excluded. On
average, 1,400±208 esg- cells and 1,000±404 esg+ cells per
biological replicate were isolated. SMART-Seq v.4 cDNA libraries were sequenced on NextSeq 500 to a mean of 16±4 million 75 bp paired-end reads. Quality control of the read mapping
and DE analysis indicated successful RNA sequencing and DE
analysis (Supplementary Figure 7). Upon filtering out genes
with zero counts in more than 3 samples, 405 out of 1,596 genes
were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.05).
The DE gene set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) from Probe-Seq
was compared to cell type-specific markers identified by scRNA
sequencing34 . An enrichment of ISC/EB1 and ISC/EB2 markers
was observed in the esg+ population isolated using Probe-Seq,
while markers of all other cell types were enriched in the esgpopulation (Figure 3e). GSEA between esg+ and esg- popula-

tions isolated using Probe-Seq indicated significant enrichment
of ISC/EB1 and ISC/EB2 markers in the esg+ population and
all other cell type markers in the esg- population (Enrichment
in esg+ population: ISC/EB1: FDR < 0.001; ISC/EB2: FDR
= 0.081; Enrichment in esg- population: aEC1: FDR < 0.001;
aEC2: FDR < 0.001; pEC2 FDR < 0.001; pEC1: FDR < 0.001;
pEC3: FDR < 0.001; EE: FDR < 0.001; aEC3: FDR = 0.009;
mEC: FDR = 0.041). Using SABER FISH on wholemounts of
midguts, we validated the co-localization of esg and Sox100B, a
transcript significantly enriched in the esg+ population (Figure
3f). Additionally, we cross-referenced the Probe-Seq DE gene
set (adjusted p-value < 0.05) to ISC/EB and EC markers defined
by DamID profiling of the adult Drosophila gut35 . From this
analysis, the majority of ISC/EB and EC markers were seen to
be enriched in esg+ and esg- populations, respectively (Supplementary Figure 8). These results demonstrate that Probe-Seq
enables the isolation and transcriptional profiling of specific cell
types from invertebrate non-CNS tissue.

Transcriptome profiling of the central chick retina reveals
unique transcripts expressed in cells that give rise to the high
acuity area

75bp paired-end reads on NextSeq 500. Interestingly, the 3’ bias
of the mapped reads from the chick retina was significantly reduced compared to that of the mouse retina (0.59±0.04, comparable to RIN 6-8) (Supplementary Figure 9). Quality control
of the read mapping and DE analysis indicated successful RNA
sequencing and DE analysis (Supplementary Figure 10). Between FGF8- and FGF8+ populations, we found 1,924 DE genes
out of 12,053 genes.

The central chicken retina contains a region thought to endow
high acuity vision, given its cellular composition and arrangement of cells. It comprises a small and discrete area that is devoid of rod photoreceptors and enriched in cone photoreceptors,
with a high density of retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons
of the retina36,37 . These features are shared with the high acuity areas (HAA) of other species, including human. Although
we have shown that FGF8, CYP26C1, and CYP26A1 are highly
enriched in this area at embryonic day 6 (E6)37 , the other molecular determinants that may play a role in HAA development
are unknown. Probe-Seq was thus used to isolate and sequence
FGF8+ cells. Hamburger-Hamilton stage 28 (HH28) chick retinas were dissociated into single cells, fixed, and probed for the
FGF8 transcript (Figure 4a). On average, 7,000±6,950 FGF8+
cells and 189,000±19,000 FGF8- cells were FACS isolated into
individual populations (Figure 4b). The cDNA from each population (n=3) was sequenced to a mean depth of 18±7 million

Among the top 50 most enriched DE transcripts in the
FGF8+ population were FGF8, CYP1B1, and CYP26C1 (Figure 4c). The latter two transcripts are components of the retinoic
acid signaling pathway, and were previously shown to be highly
enriched in the central retina where FGF8 is expressed37 . Previously, FGF8 expression was shown to be largely confined to
the area where progenitor cells reside. However, it was unclear
whether it was also expressed in differentiated cells37 . DE analysis of the FGF8- and FGF8+ populations revealed enrichment
of early differentiation markers of RGCs (i.e. NEFL) and photoreceptors (i.e. NEUROD1) in the FGF8- population, confirming that FGF8 is mostly expressed in central progenitor cells

(Supplementary Figure 11). As we wished to validate the DE
genes using FISH on sections, and SABER FISH had not yet
been tested on chick tissue, we first tested the method using the
FGF8 probe set on chick tissue sections (Figure 4e). Robust
and specific FISH signal was seen in the appropriate pattern for
FGF8. An additional SABER-FISH probe set for BMP2, a transcript enriched in the FGF8+ population, was then used on developing HH28 chick central retinal sections. BMP2 was found
to be highly enriched within the FGF8+ population, i.e expression was confined to a discrete central retina where FGF8 was
expressed (Figure 4e). These results indicate that Probe-Seq of
the developing chick retina using FGF8 as a molecular handle
can reveal the transcriptional profile of the progenitor cells that
will comprise the chick high acuity area.

ther modified to use other single molecule FISH methods such
as clampFISH40 or RNAscope41 rather than SABER-FISH, as
these methods have their respective strengths and weaknesses.
Additionally, the protocol may also be adapted to use a cell
strainer for the wash steps to minimize cell loss from centrifugation. Further development for scRNA sequencing after cell
type enrichment using Probe-Seq may also be possible. For this,
however, adaptation of Probe-Seq for the reversal of crosslinks
for scRNA sequencing42-44 will likely be necessary.
METHODS

Studies of model organisms have allowed the dissection of
molecular mechanisms that underlie a variety of biological
processes. However, each organism across the evolutionary
tree possesses unique traits, and understanding these traits will
greatly enrich our understanding of biological processes. Nonmodel organisms can now be investigated at the genetic level,
due to advances in DNA sequencing, transcriptional profiling,
and genome modification methods. Despite progress, challenges remain to achieve greater depth in the characterization
of the transcriptomes of rarer cell types within heterogeneous
tissues. Even in model organisms, deep transcriptional profiling
of specific cell types remains difficult if specific cis-regulatory
elements are unavailable. To overcome these challenges, we developed Probe-Seq.
Probe-Seq uses a FISH method based upon SABER probes
to hybridize gene-specific probe sets to RNAs of interest24 .
This method provides amplified fluorescent detection of RNA
molecules and can be spectrally or serially multiplexed to mark
cell populations based on combinatorial RNA expression profiles. Previously-identified markers can thus be targeted by
gene-specific probe sets to isolate specific cell types by FACS.
Subsequently, deep RNA sequencing can be carried out on the
sorted population to generate cell type-specific transcriptome
profiles. Due to the reliance on RNA for cell sorting, rather
than protein, this method is applicable across organisms. Other
RNA-based methods to label specific cell types for downstream
sequencing have not been tested with tissue samples, and/or require cell encapsulation in a microfluidic device25,38,39 .
Probe-Seq allowed the isolation and profiling of RNA from
fresh mouse, frozen human, and fresh chick retinas, as well as
gut cells from Drosophila melanogaster. Aside from the different dissociation protocols, Probe-Seq does not require speciesor tissue-specific alterations. To profile multiple cellular subtypes, serial multiplexed Probe-Seq allows for iterative labeling, sorting, and re-labeling. This strategy enables separation
of FACS-isolated, broad populations into finer sub-populations.
The Probe-Seq method is also cost and time effective, with less
than 6 hours of hands-on time, including FISH, FACS, and library preparation. Per sample, we estimate the cost to be less
than $200, from start to finish, achieving 15 million pairedend reads. The Probe-Seq protocol may be further optimized
to maximize utility. For example, the protocol may be fur-

Mouse retina samples
All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Harvard University. For fresh
samples, retinas of adult CD1 mice (>P30) from Charles River Laboratories
were dissected. For frozen samples, retinas of adult CD1 mice (>P30) were
dissected and frozen in a slurry of isopentane and dry ice and kept at -80◦ C.

493

Human retina samples
Frozen eyes were obtained from Restore Life USA (Elizabethton, TN) through
TissueForResearch. Patient DRLU041818C was a 53-year-old female with
no clinical eye diagnosis and the postmortem interval was 9 hours. Patient
DRLU051918A was a 43-year-old female with no clinical eye diagnosis and
the postmortem interval was 5 hours. Patient DRLU031318A was a 47-yearold female with no clinical eye diagnosis and the postmortem interval was 7
hours. This IRB protocol (IRB17-1781) was determined to be not-human subject research by the Harvard University-Area Committee on the Use of Human
Subjects.

Dissociation of mouse and chick retinas
Mouse or chick retinas were dissected away from other ocular tissues in Hanks
Balanced Salt Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #14025092) or PBS. The
retina was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 7 minutes at 37◦ C with an activated papain dissociation solution (87.5 mM HEPES
pH 7.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #15630080), 2.5 mM L-Cysteine (MilliporeSigma, cat. #168149), 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat.
#AM9260G), 10 µL Papain Suspension (Worthington, cat. #LS0003126), 19.6
µL UltraPure Nuclease-Free Water (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #10977023),
HBSS up to 400 µL, activated by a 15-minute incubation at 37◦ C). The retina
was then centrifuged at 600 xg for 3 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and
1 mL of HBSS/10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #10437028) was added
without agitation to the pellet. The pellet was centrifuged at 600 xg for 3 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and 600 µL of trituration buffer (DMEM
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #11995065), 0.4% (wt/vol) Bovine Serum Albumin (MilliporeSigma cat. #A9418)) was added. The pellet was dissociated
by trituration at room temperature (RT) using a P1000 pipette up to 20 times or
until the solution was homogenous.

517

Dissociation of Drosophila midgut
35-40 Drosophila midguts were dissected in PBS and transferred to 1%
BSA/PBS solution. The midguts were incubated in 400 µL of Elastase/PBS
solution (1 mg/mL, MilliporeSigma cat. #E0258) for 30 minutes to 1 hour
at RT, with trituration with a P1000 pipette every 15 minutes. 1 mL of 1%
BSA/PBS was then added. This solution was overlaid on top of Optiprep/PBS
(MilliporeSigma, cat. #D1556) solution with a density of 1.12 g/mL in a 5-mL
polypropylene tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #1495911A). The solution
was centrifuged at 800 xg at RT for 20 minutes. The top layer with viable cells
was collected for further processing.

gestion Buffer, 4 µL of protease), and incubated for 3 hours at 50◦ C, which
differs from the manufacturer’s protocol. The downstream steps were according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The volume of ethanol/additive mix in the
kit was adjusted based on the total volume (100 µL of Digestion Mix and remaining volume after cell pelleting). The libraries for RNA sequencing were
generated using the SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio, cat.
#634890) and Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, cat. #FC1311096)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The number of cycles for SMARTSeq v.4 protocol was as follows: Mouse Vsx2/Grik1: 13 cycles; Chick FGF8:
16 cycles; Human GRM6: 16 cycles; Drosophila esg: 17 cycles. 150 pg of total
cDNA was used as the input for Nextera XT after SMART-Seq v.4, and 12 cycles
were used except for Drosophila samples for which 14 cycles were necessary.
The cDNA library fragment size was determined by the BioAnalyzer 2100 HS
DNA Assay (Agilent, cat. #50674626). The libraries were sequenced as 75bp
paired-end reads on NextSeq 500 (Illumina).

was then overlaid on top of 20% sucrose solution (25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 ,
10mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0) and spun at 500 xg for 12 minutes at 4◦ C.
Probe-Seq for whole cells and nuclei
For all solutions, 1 µL mL-1 RNasin Plus was added 10 minutes before use. If
the cells or nuclei were not already pelleted, the suspended cells/nuclei (henceforth called cells) were centrifuged at 600 xg for 5 minutes at 4◦ C. The cells
were then resuspended in 1 mL of 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat.
#15714S, diluted in PBS) and incubated at 4◦ C for 15 minutes with rocking.
The cells were centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at 4◦ C. Except in the case
of nuclei, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL
of Permeabilization Buffer (Hoechst 33342 10 µg mL-1 , 0.1% Trixon X-100,
PBS up to 1 mL) and incubated for 10 minutes at 4◦ C with rocking. For both
cells and nuclei, the cells were next centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at 4◦ C.
The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 500 µL of
pre-warmed (43◦ C) 40% wash Hybridization solution (wHyb; 2x SSC (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, cat. #15557044), 40% deionized formamide (MilliporeSigma,
cat. #S4117), diluted in UltraPure Water). Compared to the original SABER
protocol24 , the Tween-20 was removed as we found that it causes cell clumping.
The cells were incubated for at least 30 minutes at 43◦ C. After this step, the cell
pellet became transparent. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes
at RT, and the supernatant was carefully removed, leaving ∼100 µL of supernatant. The cells were then resuspended in 100 µL of pre-warmed (43◦ C) Probe
Mix (1 µg of probe per gene, 96 µL of Hyb1 solution (2.5x SSC, 50% deionized formamide, 12.5% Dextran Sulfate (MilliporeSigma cat. #D8906)), diluted
up to 120 µL with UltraPure Water) and incubated overnight (16-24 hours) at
43◦ C.
500 µL of pre-warmed (43◦ C) 40% wHyb was added to the cells and centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at RT. The supernatant was removed, and the
cells were resuspended in 500 µL of pre-warmed (43◦ C) 40% wHyb. The cells
were incubated for 15 minutes at 43◦ C. The cells were then centrifuged at 2000
xg for 5 minutes at RT, and the supernatant was removed. 1 mL of pre-warmed
(43◦ C) 2x SSC solution was added, the cells were resuspended, and incubated
for 5 minutes at 43◦ C. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at
RT, and the supernatant was removed. Cells were then resuspended in 500 µL of
pre-warmed (37◦ C) PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at
RT, and the supernatant was removed. The cells were resuspended in 100 µL of
Fluorescent Oligonucleotide Mix (100 µL of PBS, 2 µL of each 10 µM Fluorescent Oligonucleotide) and incubated for 10 minutes at 37◦ C. After incubation,
500 µL of pre-warmed (37◦ C) PBS was added and the cells were centrifuged at
2000 xg for 5 minutes at RT. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were
resuspended in 500 µL of pre-warmed (37◦ C) PBS. The cells were incubated
for 5 minutes at 37◦ C. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at
RT, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 500-1000
µL of PBS, depending on cell concentration.

RNA-Seq data analysis
Quality control of RNA-seq reads were performed using fastqc version
0.10.1 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). RNA-seq
reads were clipped and mapped onto the either the mouse genome (Ensembl GRCm38.90), human genome (Ensembl GRCh38.94), chick genome
(Ensembl GRCg6a.96), or Drosophila genome (BDGP6.22) using STAR
version 2.5.2b46,47 .
Parameters used were as follows: –runThreadN
6 –readFilesCommand zcat –outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate –
outSAMunmapped Within –outSAMattributes Standard –clip3pAdapterSeq –
quantMode TranscriptomeSAM GeneCounts
Alignment quality control was performed using Qualimap version 2.2.148 .
Read counts were produced by HT-seq version 0.9.149 . Parameters used were as
follows: -i gene name -s no
The resulting matrix of read counts were analyzed for differential expression by DESeq2 version 3.950 . For the DE analysis of human and Drosophila
samples, any genes with more than 4 and 3 samples with zero reads, respectively, were discarded. The R scripts used for differential expression analysis
are available in Supplementary Files.

FACS isolation of specific cell types
The suspended labeled cells were kept on ice before FACS. Immediately before
FACS, the cells were filtered through a 35 µM filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
cat. #352235) for mouse, chick, and human retina cells/nuclei or a 70 µM filter
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #352350) for Drosophila cells. FACSAria (BD
Biosciences) with 488, 561, 594, and 633 lasers was used for the sorts. 2N single cells were gated based on the Hoechst histogram. For the Drosophila gut,
debris was gated out first by FSC/SSC plot because the high number of debris
events masked the Hoechst+ peaks. Out of the single cells, a 2-dimensional plot
(with one axis being the fluorescent channel of interest and another axis that is
empty) was used to plot the negative and positive populations. The events that
ran along the diagonal in this plot were considered negative, and the positive
events were either left- or right-shifted (depending on axes) compared to the diagonal events. For some samples, the number of sorted cells was capped, as
indicated by a standard deviation of 0. Different populations were sorted into
microcentrifuge tubes with 500 µL of PBS and kept on ice after FACS. The protocol was later modified so that the cells are sorted into 500 µL of 1% BSA/PBS,
as this significantly improved cell pelleting. The data obtained for this study did
not use 1% BSA/PBS.

Gene set curation
Unique marker genes that define different cell types in different tissue types
were curated in an unbiased manner. For the mouse retina, marker genes of
major cell types were identified from scRNA sequencing3 . Genes that were
found in more than one cluster were removed from the analysis to obtain unique
cluster-specific markers. Rod-specific genes were highly represented in all clusters; thus, they were considered non-unique by this analysis. Therefore, top 20
rod-specific genes were manually added after non-unique genes were removed.
For mouse BCs, marker genes of BC subtypes with high confidence were identified by scRNA sequencing5 . Genes that were found in more than one cluster
was removed from the analysis. For the human retina, marker genes of major
cell types were identified by scRNA sequencing32 . Marker genes that were expressed in < 90% of cells in the cluster were removed for analysis. For the
Drosophila gut, marker genes of major cell types were identified from DamID
transcriptional profiling and scRNA sequencing34,35 . For the DamID dataset, a
cutoff of FDR < 0.01 was used for marker genes that were specifically expressed
between ISC/EBs and ECs.

653

Gene set enrichment analysis
GSEAPreranked analysis was performed using GSEA v3.051 . Curated gene sets
described above were used to define various cell types. Parameters used were
as follows: Number of permutations: 1000; Enrichment statistic: classic; the
ranked file was generated using log2 FoldChange generated by DESeq2. To determine significance, we used the default FDR < 0.25 for all gene sets.

670

SABER probe synthesis
SABER probe sets were synthesized using the original protocol24 . The gene
of interest was searched in the UCSC Genome Browser. Then, the BED
files for genes of interest were generated through the UCSC Table Browser
with the following parameters: group: Genes and Gene Predictions; track:
NCBI RefSeq; table: UCSC RefSeq (refGene); region: position; output format: BED; Create one BED record per: Exons. If multiple isoforms were
present in the BED output file, all but one was removed manually. Genomewide probe sets for mouse, human, chick, and Drosophila were downloaded
from (https://oligopaints.hms.harvard.edu/genome-files) with Balance setting.
The tiling oligonucleotide sequences were generated using intersectBed (bedtools 2.27.1) between the BED output file and the genome-wide chromosomespecific BED file with f 1. If the BED file sequences were on the + strand, the
reverse complement probe set was generated using OligoMiners probeRC.py
script (https://github.com/brianbeliveau/OligoMiner). For each tiling oligonucleotide sequence, hairpin primer sequences were added following a TTT linker.

RNA isolation and library preparation
The sorted cells were transferred to a 5-mL polypropylene tube and centrifuged
at 3000 xg for 7 minutes at RT. The supernatant was removed as much as possible, the cells were resuspended in 100 µL Digestion Mix (RecoverAll Total
Nuclear Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #AM1975) 100 µL of Di-

The tiling oligonucleotides were ordered from IDT with the following specifications in a 96-well format: 10 nmole, resuspended in IDTE pH 7.5, V-Bottom
Plate, and normalized to 80 µM. The tiling oligonucleotides were then combined into one pool for gene-specific probe set synthesis using a multi-channel
pipette. The tiling oligonucleotide sequences for every gene-specific probe set
used in this study are provided in Supplementary Files.
Tiling oligonucleotides were extended by a PER concatemerization reaction
(1X PBS, 10 mM MgSO4 , dNTP (0.3 mM of A, C, and T), 0.1 µM Clean.G, 0.5
µL Bst Polymerase (McLab, cat. #BPL-300), 0.5 µM hairpin, 1 µM oligonucleotide pool). The reaction was incubated without the tiling oligonucleotide
pool for 15 minutes at 37◦ C. Then, the oligonucleotide pool was added and the
reaction was incubated for 100 minutes at 37◦ C, 20 minutes at 80◦ C, and incubated at 4◦ C until probe set purification. 8 µL of the reaction was analyzed
on an 1.25% agarose gel (run time of 8 minutes at 150 volts) to confirm the
probe set length. Probe sets of 300-700 nt were used for the study. The 37◦ C
extension time was increased or decreased (from 100 minutes) based on desired
concatemer length. The probe set was purified using MinElute PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen, cat. #28004) following manufacturers protocol. The probe set was
eluted in 25 µL UltraPure Water and the concentration was analyzed by NanoDrop on the ssDNA setting (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Probe sets with ssDNA
concentration ranging from 200-500 ng/µL, depending on the hairpin, were used
for this study.
Fluorescent oligonucleotides were ordered from IDT with 5’ modification
of either AlexaFluor 488, ATTO 550, ATTO 590, or ATTO 633. The sequences
for fluorescent oligonucleotides and hairpins are included in Supplementary
Files. Working dilutions of the hairpins (5 µM) and tiling oligonucleotides (10
µM) were made by diluting in IDTE pH 7.5 and stored at -20◦ C. Working dilutions of the fluorescent oligonucleotides (10 µM) were made by diluting in
UltraPure Water and stored at -20◦ C.
Fluorescent oligonucleotide stripping for multiplexed Probe-Seq
Cells were incubated in 50% formamide solution (diluted in PBS) for 5 minutes
at RT. The cells were then centrifuged at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at RT. The cells
were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and centrifuged again at 2000 xg for 5 minutes at RT. Hybridization of new fluorescent oligonucleotides was carried out as
described above.
Stain Index calculation
The Stain Index (SI) was calculated by measuring the geometric mean of the
positive and negative populations as well as the standard deviation of the negative population using FlowJo Software. The SI was calculated as follows: (Geo.
MeanPOS - Geo. MeanNEG ) / (2 x SDNEG ).
Live cell RNA sequencing
In vivo retina electroporation was carried out as described previously at P210 .
Two plasmids, CAG-BFP and Grik1CRM4 -GFP, were electroporated simultaneously at a concentration of 1 µg/µL per plasmid. Retinas were harvested at P40.
The electroporated and unelectroporated regions were processed separately. The
electroporated region was dissociated as described above, and BFP+ /GFP+ cells
were FACS isolated into Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #15596026).
Cells from the unelectroporated region were used for Probe-Seq as described
above. The RNA from the cells in Trizol was extracted following manufacturers
protocol. The RNA-sequencing libraries were generated using the SMART-Seq
v.4 and Nextera XT kits as described above.
Histology and SABER FISH
For the mouse retina, adult CD1 mouse retinas were dissected and fixed in
4% PFA for 20 minutes at RT. The fixed retinas were cryoprotected in 30%
sucrose (in PBS). Once submerged, the samples were embedded in 50%/15%
OCT/Sucrose mixture in an ethanol/dry ice bath and stored at -80◦ C. The retinas were cryosectioned at 15 µM thickness. For the human eye, formalinfixed human postmortem eyes were obtained from Restore Life USA. Patient
DRLU101818C was a 54-year-old male with no clinical eye diagnosis and the
postmortem interval was 4 hours. Patient DRLU110118A was a 59-year-old female with no clinical eye diagnosis and the postmortem interval was 4 hours. A
square ( 1 cm x 1 cm) of the human retina was cryoprotected, embedded, and
cryosectioned as described above. For the Drosophila gut, the midgut was fixed
in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at RT. For the chick retina, the central region of developing HH28 chick retina that contained the developing high acuity area was
excised and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes at RT. The retina was then cryoprotected, embedded as described above, and cryosectioned at 50 µM thickness.
SABER FISH of retinal sections was carried out on Superfrost Plus slides
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. #1255015) using an adhesive hybridization
chamber (Grace Bio-Labs, cat. #621502). For Drosophila guts, wholemount
SABER FISH was performed in microcentrifuge tubes. For retinal sections, they
were rehydrated with PBS for 5-10 minutes to remove the OCT on the slides.

10

Subsequently, sections were completely dried to adhere the sections to the slides.
Once dry, the adhesive chamber was placed to encase the sections. For both retinal sections and wholemount Drosophila guts, the samples were incubated in
0.1% PBS/Tween-20 (MilliporeSigma, cat. #P9416) for at least 10 minutes. The
PBST was removed, and the samples were incubated with pre-warmed (43◦ C)
40% wHyb (2x SSC, 40% deionized formamide, 1% Tween-20, diluted in UltraPure Water) for at least 15 minutes at 43◦ C. The 40% wHyb was removed,
and the samples were then incubated with 100 µL of pre-warmed (43◦ C) Probe
Mix (1 µg of probe per gene, 96 µL of Hyb1 solution (2.5x SSC, 50% deionized
formamide, 12.5% Dextran Sulfate, 1.25% Tween-20), diluted up to 120 µL
with UltraPure Water) and incubated 16-48 hours at 43◦ C. The samples were
washed twice with 40% wHyb (30 minutes/wash, 43◦ C), twice with 2x SSC
(15 minutes/wash, 43◦ C), and twice with 0.1% PBST (5 minutes/wash, 37◦ C).
The samples were then incubated with 100 µL of Fluorescent Oligonucleotide
Mix (100 µL of PBST, 2 µL of each 10 µM Fluorescent Oligonucleotide) for
15 minutes at 37◦ C. The samples were washed three times with PBST at 37◦ C
for 5 minutes each and counterstained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat.
#D1306; 1:50,000 of 5 mg/mL stock solution in PBS) or WGA-405s (Biotium,
cat. #290271; 1:100 of 1 mg/mL stock solution in PBS). Cell segmentation and
cell calling algorithms were performed as described previously24 .

764

Imaging
Fluorescent images were acquired with W1 Yokogawa Spinning disk confocal
microscope with 50 µM pinhole disk and 488, 561, and 640 laser lines. The objectives used were either Plan Fluor 40x/1.3 or Plan Apo 60x/1.4 oil objectives,
and the camera used was Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus sCMOS monochrome camera.
Nikon Elements Acquisition Software (AR 5.02) was used for image acquisition
and Fiji or Adobe Photoshop CS6 was used for image analysis. SABER FISH
images were acquired as a z-stack and converted to a 2D image by maximum
projection in Fiji.
