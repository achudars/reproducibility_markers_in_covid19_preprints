ABSTRACT

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Better

25

understanding of factors and pathways involved in lung cancer is needed to improve

26

diagnose and treatment strategies. Recent studies have provided insights into the

27

possible correlation between intestinal dysbiosis and cancer development. Although

28

the immunological relationship between gut and lung had been suggested by many

29

researches, however, to date, no study had investigated the characterization of gut

30

microbiome in treatment naïve lung cancer patients, whether it is distinct from that of

31

health individuals and contribute to the onset and development of lung cancer remain

32

unclear. In this study, we investigated whether gut microbiome of lung cancer patients

33

(LC, n=28) is altered compare with that of matched healthy individuals (HC, n=19) by

34

high throughout sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of 16S rDNA in their fecal samples.

35

We also identified microbiota signatures specific for different histological types of

36

lung cancer, including SSC, ADC, and SCLC. The gut microbiome of lung cancer

37

patients is characterized by decreased relative abundance of Prevotella, and increased

38

bacteria groups such as Actinomyces, and Streptococcus, etc. We also detected a mild

39

structural shift in gut microbiome between ADC and SCLC patients. Our results

40

showed that the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients altered significantly

41

compared with healthy individuals. However, the association between microbial

42

dysbiosis and lung cancer is not clearly understood, future studies involving larger

43

cohorts and metagenomics, or metabolomics, may elucidate the correlations between

44

gut microbiota and lung cancer development.

INTRODUCTION

52

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death (1). There are estimated 1.82 million

53

new cases of lung cancer globally, which constitutes nearly 13% of all newly

54

diagnosed cancer cases annually (2). More than one-third of lung cancer worldwide

55

occurring in China, where 733,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed, and about

56

591,000 Chinese people died from it each year (3-4). Better understanding of factors

57

and pathways involved in lung cancer is urgently needed to improve treatment

58

strategies.

59

As a heterogeneous disease, many factors are involved in the onset and

60

development of lung cancer. Although smoking is considered as an important factor,

61

only 10–15% of smokers develop cancer (5), which highlights other influences, such

62

as the involvement of microbial communities. Recent studies showed that changes in

63

the lung microbiome may be relevant for progression and exacerbations in lung

64

cancer (6,7). By comparison of microbiome in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of

65

patients with lung cancer with benign mass like lesions, Lee et al. found that the

66

genera Veillonella and Megasphaera are more abundant in lung cancer patients,

67

which may serve as potential biomarkers for the disease detection/classification (8). A

68

recent research, in which surgical lung tissue samples were used, concluded that the

69

microbiota of the lung cancer is unique, with the genus Thermus more abundant in

70

tissue from advanced stage (IIIB, IV) patients, while Legionella is higher in patients

71

who develop metastases (9). These studies provide insights into the possible

72

correlation between microbiota and lung cancer development.

73

However, lung microbiota doesn’t seem to be the only microbial factor

74

contributing to the development of lung cancer. The influence of gut microbiota on

75

lung immunity has been vastly explored and several studies have linked changes in

76

the gut microbiome with lung diseases (10,11). For example, gut flora is responsible

77

for inducing lung inflammatory reaction against bacterial challenge and enhancing

78

neutrophils infiltration through TLR4 in mice (12,13). Antibiotic treatment can cause

79

overgrowth of particular fungal species in the gut and promote allergic airway

80

inflammation via fungi-induced prostaglandin E2 (14). Conversely, the lung

81

microbiota also influences the gut microbiota through the blood stream. Acute lung

82

injury (ALI) can disrupt the lung microbiota, induces a transient translocation of

83

bacteria into blood and causes an acute increase of bacterial load in cecum (15). These

84

studies emphasized the important role of gut-lung axis in development of diseases

85

(16). However, to date, no study had investigated the characterization of gut

86

microbiome in treatment naïve lung cancer patients, whether it is distinct from that of

87

health individuals and contribute to the onset and development of lung cancer remain

88

unclear.

89

In this study, we investigated whether gut microbiome of lung cancer patients

90

(LC, n=28) is altered compare with that of matched healthy individuals (HC, n=19) by

91

high throughout sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of 16S rDNA in their fecal samples.

92

We also identified microbiota signatures specific for different histological types of

93

lung cancer, including SSC, ADC, and SCLC.

95

Characteristics of participants. A total of 50 participants enrolled in the

96

Department of Medical Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical

97

University (Dalian, China). Participants were excluded after fecal sample collection

98

because of antibiotic use, received chemotherapy, or combined with other diseases

99

such as diabetes mellitus (Fig. 1). Finally, a total of 28 LC patients were remained,

100

they were mainly males (83%) with a median age of 65 years old (Table 1) and with

101

an average smoking index of 606.79±127.1. 19 healthy controls (HC) were included

102

for age and gender matching, with an average smoking index of 350.00±72.1 (P >

103

0.05 compared with LC group) (details in Table 1). More than 64% of the enrolled LC

104

patients were smokers, with a high smoking index about 606.79±127.1. Among them,

105

28.57% (8/28) of the patients were diagnosed as SCLC, and 71.43% (20/28) were

106

NSCLC. Among the NSCLC patients, 21.43% (6/28) were diagnosed as squamous

107

cell carcinoma and 50.00% (14/28) were adenocarcinoma.

108

The overall structure of gut microbiome in LC patients. By sequencing of the

109

16S ribosomal RNA gene, we found that The HC and LC groups share about 2368

110

same Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), but there are 372 OTUs were obtained

111

specifically in the HC group, and 202 were obtained specifically in the LC group (Fig.

112

2A). We observed significant decrease in alpha diversity of gut microbiota in LC

113

group, which expressed by the ACE and Chao1 index (Fig. 2B and C). Whereas the

114

Shannon diversity index and the Simpson index did not show significant differences

115

between two groups (Fig. S1). Changes in the relative abundance of gut microbes in

116

LC patients were observed not only on the phylum level, but also on the levels of

117

order, class, and family (Fig. S4). At genus level, significant decreased abundance of

118

Prevotella and elevated abundance of Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus etc. were

119

detected in LC patients (Fig. 2D).

120

The beta diversity metrics from the control and LC individuals also showed

121

strong grouping pattern. Although significant inter-individual variation exists among

122

patients and the healthy controls, the fecal microbiota of the two groups still separated

123

clearly according to community composition using Principal component analysis

124

(PCA, Fig. S3), and unweighted/weighted UniFrac Principal coordinates analysis

125

(PCoA) (Fig. 2E). These differences were also observed by the two-dimensional

126

Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on unweighted/weighted

127

UniFrac (Fig. 2F). Most of the samples from each group clustered together as

128

evaluated by Hierarchical clustering based on Weighted UniFrac by the method of

129

Unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA, Fig. S4). Especially,

130

when analyzed by the method of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis

131

(PLSDA), we observed a significant separation between the LC patients and HCs (Fig.

132

2G).

133

Altered microbiota composition in LC patients. The alteration of gut

134

microbiome in LC patients was further proved by the LEfSe approach, which

135

identified the key phylotypes responsible for the difference between the two groups.

136

Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Mycobacteriaceae, etc,

137

which were most abundant in the LC group, and Prevotella, Bacteroidetes, and

Dialister, which were most abundant in the HCs, were the dominant phylotypes that

139

contributed to the difference between the intestinal microbiota of LC patients and HCs

140

(Fig. 3A and B). The significantly elevated relative abundance of Actinomyceae,

141

Streptococcus, and Ruminococcus, and decreased abundance of Prevotellaceae were

142

observed in the gut microbiome of most of the LC patients, which suggested a highly

143

consistence among different individuals (Fig. S5).

144

Using the method of Metastats, we found a significant decrease in the abundance

145

of Bacteroidetes (phylum), Bacteroidia (class), Bacteroidales (order) and elevated

146

abundance of Firmicutes (phylum), Bacilli (class), Actinomycetales (order), Bacillales

147

(order), Lactobacillales (order) in gut of the LC patients (Fig. S6). On the family level,

148

significant elevation of the relative abundance of Streptococcaceae, Actinomycetaceae,

149

decreased abundance of the Prevotellaceae and Veillomellaceae were observed in gut

150

of LC patients compared with HCs (Fig. 4A). These changes may mainly due to the

151

changing of genus such as the Streptococcus, Actimomyces, and Prevotella etc (Fig.

152

4B). In addition, we also detected elevation of genera such as Ruminococcus, Rothia,

153

Bacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoacterium, etc, and decreased abundance of

154

Dialister in gut of LC patients, which are consistent with LEfSe analysis results.

155

Comparison of gut microbiome in LC patients with specific histological types.

156

We further performed a detailed comparison of the gut microbiome in lung cancer

157

patients according to different histological types, including adenocarcinoma (Group A,

158

n=14), squamous cell carcinoma (Group B, n=6), and SCLC (Group C, n=8). Only the

159

index of alpha diversity (ACE) in SCLC patients is significantly lower than control

160

(Fig. 5A). Other groups showed no significant differences compared either with HC

161

or other groups, although the average indexes of each of the specific histological type

162

are obviously lower than that of the HCs (Fig. 5A and Fig. S7). The beta diversity

163

analysis by PCoA and NMDS showed no obvious separation between groups (Fig. 5B

164

and C). When analyzed by the method of PLSDA, we observed a mild separation

165

between group A and C, which suggested that the gut microbiome of SCLC patients

166

may differ from that of LC patients with adenocarcinoma (Fig. 5D). The

167

taxonomy-based comparison at the genus level showed that, Bifidobacterium,

168

Clostridium, and Prevotella, etc, are the dominant phylotypes in group A, but were

169

significantly reduced in the other two groups. In group B, the dominant genera

170

including Ruminococcus, Lachnospira, and Lactobacillus, etc, which are less

171

abundant in group A and C. in addition, the genera of Streptococcus, Anaerotruncus,

172

and Bacillus, etc are more abundant in group C when compared with group A and B

173

(Fig. S8).

DISCUSSION

176

Alterations of the gut microbiome influence the incidence and progression of not

177

only gastric carcinogenesis (17), but also extra-intestinal cancers, such as breast and

178

hepatocellular carcinoma, presumably through inflammatory and metabolic circuitries

179

(18). Meanwhile, gut microbiota was also found contribute to the acute lung injury

180

(19), the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (20), and the

181

development of asthma (21), which highlighted its important role in affecting the

182

respiratory system. Actually the hypothesis of “gut–lung” axis has been raised 20

183

years ago, when study found that gut-derived injurious factors can reach to the lung

184

and systemic circulation via the intestinal lymphatics (22). Gut flora was found to be

185

responsible for inducing lung inflammation against bacteria in mice and enhancing

186

neutrophils infiltration through activation of tool like receptor 4 (TLR4) (23). Such

187

immune transmission from gut to lung has been proved by many studies. One

188

viewpoint supports that exacerbation of chronic lung diseases occur as an

189

uncontrolled and inappropriate inflammatory response to bacteria colonizing damaged

190

airways due to an ineffective Peyer’s patch-derived T lymphocyte response (24).

191

These studies above strongly suggested a possible correlation between intestinal

192

dysbiosis and the development of lung cancer. However, to our knowledge, no study

193

has explored this possibility yet.

194

Although based on a small number of cases, we found a statistically significant

195

decrease of alpha diversity in gut microbiota of lung cancer patients, compared with

196

that of the healthy controls, which was consist with previous discovery that

197

non-malignant lung tissues have higher microbiota alpha diversity than the paired

198

tumors (10). The decline in both the bacterial diversity and richness was found in gut

199

of patients with chronic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and

200

colonrectal cancer, especially in patients with conventional adenoma (25). Reduced

201

respiratory microbiome was also shown associated with greater emphysema and

202

increased immune cell infiltration in COPD patients (26). These observations seem in

203

line with the hygiene hypothesis that diverse microbes play an essential role in

204

establishing the immune networks of a host, while in patients with various
11

205

non-communicable inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, these regulatory networks

206

seemed to be underrepresented and poorly developed (27).

207

Alterations of the gut microbial structure in lung cancer patients were

208

characterized by the significant decrease of Bacteroidetes (phylum), Bacteroidia

209

(Class), Bacteroidales (Order), and increase of Firmicutes (phylum), Bacilli (Class),

210

Actinomycetales, and Bacillales (Order), which were mainly contributed by the

211

reduction of bacteria genera such as Prevotella and Dialister, and the increase in

212

Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, Rothia, Bacillus, Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, etc.

213

These changes are not consistent with previous studies in sliva, bronchoalveolar

214

lavage fluid, or lung tissues in patients with lung cancer, except that the genus of

215

Streptococcus was previously found increased in lower airway of LC patients (28).

216

But interestingly, they are highly agreed with the observations in patients with colon

217

cancer that the class of Bacilli, genera of Streptococcus, Actinomyces,

218

Peptostreptococcus, and etc are enriched (29). Importantly, we found a significantly

219

increased ratio of Bacteroides/Prevotella, which was also proved in patients with

220

colorectal cancer when compared with normal individuals (25). Taken together, these

221

results indicate a state of dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with lung cancer.

222

As the major genus that was found significantly reduced in LC patients’ gut,

223

Prevotella had drawn many of our attentions. Prevotella strains are classically

224

considered commensal bacteria due to the extensive presence in the healthy human

225

body and the rare involvement in infections. Prevotella can stimulate epithelial cells

226

to produce cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6 and CCL20, which can promote mucosal

227

Th17 immune responses and neutrophil recruitment (30). Increased Prevotella

228

abundance is associated with augmented Th17-mediated mucosal inflammation,

229

which is in line with the marked capacity of Prevotella in driving Th17 immune

230

responses through activation of TLR2 (30). These studies suggested an

231

immune-stimulating activity of this genus. Congruously, Prevotella abundance was

232

found reduced within the lung microbiota of patients with asthma and COPD (31),

233

which further highlighted its important role in affecting lung cancer development.

234

On the other side, the increasing of certain bacteria in LC patients suggested a

235

deleterious role of them in the development of cancer. Species of Streptococcus are

236

found

237

the NSCLC patients presented significantly higher frequencies of Th1 and Th17

238

cells reacting to S. salivarius and S. agalactiae, in the PB, LC, and GI tract (32). The

239

order of Actinomycetales had been as potential colorectal cancer driver bacteria (25).

240

Among them, the filamentous Gram-positive anaerobic genus Actinomyces, was

241

found to cause Actinomycosis, which is a rare and slowly progressive infectious

242

disease that can affect a variety of organ systems including the lung (33). Actinomyces

243

was also found significantly associated with the carcinoma-in-adenoma group (34).

244

Besides, Peptostreptococcus species, P. stomatis was confirming known to be

245

associated with CRC (35). P. anaerobius, which is increased in human colon tumors

246

compared with nontumor tissues, can enhance AOM-induced tumorigenesis in mice

247

by activating TLR2/4-ROS-cholesterol axis (36). In addition, species of Atopobium,

248

A. parvalum was found positively correlates with pediatric IBD disease severity (37).

249

However, the effects of these bacteria on lung cancer development are still unclear,

250

which deserves in-deep study.

251

In addition, we compared the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients according

252

to different histological types based on collected samples, including SSC, ADC, and

253

SCLC. Although the alpha diversity among groups showed no difference, we detected

254

an obvious separation of beta diversity between patients with ADC and SCLC. Given

255

the limited number of study cases, further large scale studies on the characterization

256

of gut microbiome in LC patients with different histological types are necessary.

Conclusions. In conclusion, this is the first report to show the alteration of gut

258

microbiome in lung cancer patients. Our results showed that the gut microbiome of

259

lung cancer patients altered significantly compared with healthy individuals. However,

260

the association between microbial dysbiosis and lung cancer is not clearly understood,

future studies involving larger cohorts and metagenomics, or metabolomics, may

elucidate the correlations between gut microbiota and lung cancer development.

subjects were examined clinically before sampling and were subsequently divided

272

into three groups: SCLC (n=17), AC (n=18), SCC (n=15). The samples of the healthy

273

controls (HC, n = 30) were collected during routine physical examination at the First

274

Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.

275

The participants with the following diseases were excluded: cardiovascular

276

disease, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory
