ABSTRACT
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) express heterogeneous levels of pluripotency and developmental transcription
factors (TFs) and their cell cycle is unsynchronised when grown in the presence of serum. Here, we asked
whether the cell cycle and developmental heterogeneities of ESCs are coordinated by determining the state
identities of G1- and G2M-enriched mouse ESCs (mESCs) at single cell resolution. We found that G2M cells
were not all the same and demonstrate their split into the naïve and formative (intermediate) pluripotency
states marked by high or low Esrrb expression, respectively. The naïve G2M sub-state resembles ‘ground’
state pluripotency of the LIF/2i cultured mESCs. The naïve and formative G2M sub-states exist in the pre- and
post-implantation stages of the mouse embryo, respectively, verifying developmental distinction. Moreover,
the G2M sub-states partially match between the mouse and human ESCs, suggesting higher similarity of
transcriptional control between these species in G2M. Our findings propose a model whereby G2M separates
mESCs into naïve and formative pluripotency states. This concept of G2M-diverted pluripotency states
provides new framework for understanding the mechanisms of pluripotency maintenance and lineage
specification in vitro and in vivo, and the development of more efficient and clinically relevant reprogramming
strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Heterogeneity of mESC populations and pluripotency state
transitions
Different pluripotency states present in the peri-implantation
mouse embryo are recapitulated in vitro in the form of mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESCs, E4.5, naïve state), epiblast-like
cells (EpiLCs, E5.5, early post-implantation or formative state) and
epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs, E6.5, primed state)[1]. The regulatory
networks controlling the transitions between these states include
combinatorial and dosage-dependent interactions between
general and state-specific pluripotency and priming transcription
factors (TFs). The expression of pluripotency TFs including Nanog
[2], Esrrb [3], Zfp42/Rex1 [4] is not uniform in mESCs when grown
in the presence of serum and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) [5].
Therefore, according to the emerging model, the naïve and primed
cell states, as well as the recently described intermediate or
formative state, co-exist and are interconvertible in these culture
conditions. How these transitions occur in individual cells and
whether they follow stochastic or deterministic regulatory
principles, is still under active investigation.
Cell cycle and fate choice
Cell cycle phasing has been shown to contribute to the observed
heterogeneity of mESCs, and efforts have been made to separate
cell cycle driven heterogeneity from construction of TF circuitries
of different developmental states [6,7]. These approaches have
intuitively assumed that the ESC transcriptomes within the same
cell cycle phase are more uniform than between phases. Given the
dynamic nature of pluripotency state transitions, pluripotency and
priming TFs could be variably expressed in the same cycle phase.

Indeed, several studies have dissected the role of a particular cell
cycle stage in determining ESC fate choice, and consequently
shown that ESCs can adopt different fates when
positioned in a certain cell cycle phase [8–11]. These findings
imply potential diversion and switching between distinct gene
regulatory programs in the same cell cycle phase.
Here, we asked whether mESCs residing in a particular
cell cycle phase are in the same transcriptional state space or
diverge into distinguishable naïve and primed sub-states (Fig. 1A)
that facilitate change in cell fate. We focussed our attention on G1
and G2M phases that have been shown to either facilitate cell
differentiation [10] or enhance maintenance of pluripotency [8],
respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to dissect
the cell cycle-centred TF heterogeneity of ESCs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
mESC culture
mESCs were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plastic
in GMEM/β-mercaptoethanol/10%FCS/LIF as described before
[12].
Generation of mESCs expressing endogeneous cell cycle
reporter
For the generation of endogenous Cyclin B1-GFP reporter cell
line, a targeting strategy similar to Bressan et al., 2017 was used
[13]. 1 kb of homologous sequences upstream and downstream of
CCNB1 stop codon were amplified from wild type (wt) E14Tg2A
ESCs.
A targeting cassette with fluorescent reporter was
generated using Gibson assembly in the following configuration:
5’-1 kb homologous sequence - flexible linker – enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) - STOP codon – 1 kb of 3’ homologous
flanking region. Independent plasmids coding for CRISPR/Cas91

Nickase (D10A) and sgRNAs (CTGCAGATGTAGCAGTCTAT,
ACCATGTGCCGCCTGTACAT) were used for introducing an
EGFP tag to the C-terminus of CCNB1 in E14Tg2A ESCs. For the
delivery, 3x106 mESCs were seeded onto a 10-cm dish and
transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were transfected with 2 ug of
Cas9-Nickase (D10A) expression vector, 1 ug of each gRNA
expression vector, and 700 ng of donor cassette. The
representation of the targeted CCNB1 locus is shown in Fig. S1A.
The efficiency of genome editing was analysed by flow cytometry
48h post-transfection with 0.2% of the total population being
positive for GFP expression. It is important to note that this
percentage only describes targeted cells that were in S/G2/M
phase at the time of analysis due to natural Cyclin B1 expression
dynamics during cell cycle. GFP-positive cells were sorted as
single cells into 1x 96-well plate and clones expanded for 10 days.
Cells with ESC like morphology were picked and 7 clones
successfully expanded for genomic DNA isolation using DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) followed by genotyping using Taq
DNA polymerase (Takara) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Primers used for genotyping were: Primer 1: 5’CCTAATATGGAAGGAGTGTGAC-3’,
Primer
2:
5’AGGAATACTGTTGATAAAATG-3’. Out of 7 analysed clones, one
was homozygous (N7) and one heterozygous for CCNB1 targeting
(Fig. S1B). Clone N7 and one wt clone (N5) were selected for
FACS analysis (Fig. S1C). Snapshots taken form a time-lapse
imaging of N7-mESCs confirmed cell cycle regulated expression
dynamics of CyclinB1-GFP fusion protein (Fig. S1D).
Cell sorting and single-cell RNA-seq library preparation
N7-mESCs were stained with 50 uL Hoechst 33342 (50 mg/mL
stock) in 10 mL medium 45 min at 370C prior to FACS-sorting of
single cells directly into 2 uL of lysis buffer (0,2 % Triton X 100,
2U/uL RNase inhibitor in water) in 96-well plates. Plates were
immediately put on dry ice and stored at -800C until library
preparation. 2x 96-well plates were sorted from both G1 and G2M
gate (Fig. 1C), and 1x 96-well plate form non-gated asynchronous
population. We used Smart-seq2 protocol for cDNA synthesis [14],
and Fluidigm protocol (PN 100-7168 M1) for tagmentation and
index-PCR using Nextera chemistry to prepare single cell
sequencing libraries. 2x 96-plates were pooled together and
sequenced on one lane on Illumina HiSeq 4000 (50 bp, single-end
reads).
Read processing and quality control
Raw reads were mapped against the Ensembl mouse reference
genome version GRCm38.68 using STAR RNA-seq aligner [15]
with the inclusion of the sequences for the External RNA Controls
Consortium (ERCC) spike-ins. Mapped reads per gene were
calculated using Rsubread [16]. Genes with zero counts across all
cells were excluded. Standard quality control metrics were
calculated using the scater package [17]. The following quality
control criteria was used: cells with more than 25% of reads
mapping to ERCCs or fewer than 100,000 total reads or fewer than
4,000 genes detected (at least one read per gene) were excluded
from downstream analyses (Fig. S2A-D). The number of cells
passing this quality control were: 62 cells for Asynch, 111 cells for
G1 and 104 cells for G2M.

Statistical analyses
The input genes for the construction of the G1-G2M pseudotime
trajectory were selected by differential expression between the G1
and G2M cells using the differentialGeneTest function in Monocle
2 [18]. Log2 +1 counts per million (CPM) values were computed
using the calculateCPM function in scater. Boxplots were
constructed using ggplot2 and statistical tests applied using
ggpubr. A Wilcox statistical test was applied in pairwise
comparisons and a Kruskal-Wallis test in group comparisons.
Differential expression analysis was conducted using the SCDE
package in R [19].The resulting z-score ranked gene lists were
used in a GSEA analysis [20].
Comparisons between different datasets
Raw counts from the [6] were downloaded from
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/teichmann-srv/espresso/index.php,
and
cells with more than 25% of reads mapping to ERCCs or fewer
than 106.3 reads or fewer than 9,000 genes detected (at least one
read per gene) were rejected, resulting in 668 cells. The total
number of cells went down from the original of 704 cells to 668
primarily due to the new ERCC threshold set. Data from [21] was
obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
under a reference number GSE100597, and the associated
metadata was obtained using the getGEO function from the
GEOquery package. No further quality criteria were applied. Data
from [22] was downloaded from EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress under
the accession number E-MTAB-6819. Human gene names were
converted to mouse names using BioMart. scmapCluster() from
the scMap package was used for all comparisons between our and
external datasets [23].
RESULTS
G2M splits mESCs into sub-states
To begin to elucidate the heterogeneity of cell cycle phasematching ESCs, we aimed to incorporate into our analyses a
comparable number of cells from both G1 and G2M. Cell cycle
phase assignment using Cyclone [24] of an asynchronous
population of mESCs [6] revealed the majority of cells to reside in
S phase (Fig. 1B), a cell cycle profile characteristic to ESCs [25].
Therefore, to capture mESCs in G1 and G2M phases, we
generated a mESC line that expressed GFP-tagged Cyclin B1
from its endogeneous loci (Fig. S1A). The expression of Cyclin B1
protein directly correlates with cell cycle progression by peaking in
G2M and rapidly disappearing in G1, and when combined with a
fluorescent tag and Hoechst 33342 live DNA staining, provides a
simple single-reporter system for separating G1 and G2M from S
phase using flow cytometry (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1D). This approach
enabled us determine gene expression in chemically unperturbed
cell cycle enriched ESC populations.
Sorted cells were applied to single cell sequencing library
preparation using a modified version of the Smart-seq2 protocol
by Picelli et al., 2014 (see Experimental procedures). We
obtained 111 cells in G1 and 104 cells in G2M after quality filtering
of cells collected from duplicate plates. We also sequenced one
plate corresponding to the asynchronous population (62 cells). We
used Cyclone to quantitatively assess the G1 and G2M enrichment
in sorted ESCs (Fig. S3A-C). G1 cells appeared less uniform in
terms of G1-signature (Fig. S3B), whereas 96 % of G2M-sorted
ESCs were assigned to be in G2M and as little as 1 % or 3 % in
G1 or S, respectively, confirming high purity of the sorted G2M
fraction (Fig. S3C).

Next, to reconstruct cell-to-cell relationship of G1 and
G2M-enriched mESCs on a branching trajectory, we used
Monocle that orders individual cells by pseudotime and thereby
enables tracking the emergence of hidden developmental states
[18]. Curiously, we identified two branching points upon joint
clustering of G1- and G2M-enriched cells (Fig. 1D and E), and the
emergence of two G2M sub-states - G2M-a and G2M-b. To
confirm plate-independent branching, we performed separate
clustering of replicate G1 and G2M plates and saw a) continuous
spreading of G1 cells along the trajectory, and b) bifurcation
happening only in G2M on both plates (Fig. 1F and G). This finding
clearly shows that not all cells in the G2M are the same.
G2M sub-states separate by reciprocal expression of Esrrb
and Pou3f1
To investigate the split of G2M in more detail, we performed
unbiased single-cell consensus clustering of G2M cells using SC3
[26] which recovered near-perfect separation of G2M-a and G2Mb sub-states into two clusters (Fig. 2A). We identified 330 marker
genes for the clusters (Suppl. Table 1) including 134 highconfidence genes in cluster 1 (q < 0.05) and 18 genes in cluster 2
(q < 0.05). Among the marker genes were the early postimplantation genes Pou3f1 and Fgf5 in cluster I, and naïve
pluripotency genes Esrrb and Klf2 in cluster II (Fig. 2A). Opposite
expression of early post-implantation and naïve genes has been

shown to distinguish pre- and post-implantation epiblast of the
mouse embryo and their corresponding cellular derivates in vitro
[27,28] suggesting separation of G2M sub-states by different
developmental state.
The expression of Esrrb was distributed differently across
individual cells at distinct Monocle states, confirming lower median
expression (log2Ex < 1) in G2M-a and higher median expression
(log2Ex > 6) in G2M-b (Fig. 2B). Reverse distribution of Pou3f1 in
G2M-a (median log2Ex > 2) and G2M-b (median log2Ex = 0)
confirmed reciprocal expression of Esrrb and Pou3f1 in G2M substates (Fig. 2C).
We conducted single-cell differential expression analysis,
SCDE [19] between G2M-b (G2M-Esrrb-High) and G2M-a (G2MEsrrb-Low) and used the resulting ranked gene list (Suppl. Table
2) in a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [20,29] to verify that
the Esrrb expression positively correlated with the expression of
the naïve pluripotency genes (Fig. 2D). These results indicate
towards G2M-Esrrb-L and G2M-Esrrb-H split into alternative
states of pluripotency.
G2M sub-states represent features of the naïve and formative
pluripotency states
To compare more directly whether the G2M-Esrrb-L and G2MEsrrb-H differed by expression signatures of known pluripotency
states (naïve, early post-implantation or formative, primed), we

plotted the z-scores from the SCDE analysis for selected gene sets
combined from [21,28,30,31] (Fig. 3A). To our excitement, a clear
distinction between G2M-Esrrb-L and G2M-Esrrb-H appeared only
by the expression of naïve and early post-implantation or formative
state genes, where G2M-Esrrb-H cells expressed higher levels of
Zfp42, Nanog, Prdm14 among others (positive z-scores) and
G2M-Esrrb-L cells higher levels of Pou3f1, Fgf5, and Perp
(negative z-scores, Fig. 3A). Such clear diversion was not seen
between G1 sub-states (Fig. S3D). Importantly, both G2M-EsrrbL and G2M-Esrrb-H cells expressed similar levels of core
pluripotency TFs including Pou5f1 and Sox2 revealing general
pluripotency in both G2M sub-states. Importantly, the expression
of Otx2, Sox3 and several other priming genes was similar or
slightly higher in the naïve G2M-Esrrb-H state than in the formative
G2M-Esrrb-L state, suggesting identification of a very early exitfrom-naivety state in G2M.
We visualised the expression of the genes from Fig3A on
a clustered SC3 expression matrix which verified separation of
G2M-Esrrb-L and G2M-Esrrb-H states solely by the reciprocal
expression of naïve (cluster 2) and formative genes (cluster 1, Fig.
3B). This was confirmed by the distribution of expression of
selected marker genes across G2M-Esrrb-L and G2M-Esrrb-H
populations (Fig. 3C).

mESC separation into G2M-Esrrb-H and G2M-Esrrb-L states
is common in serum/LIF cultures
To test whether the split into G2M-Esrrb-H and G2M-Esrrb-L
states is a general phenomenon characteristic to mESC
populations cultured in serum/LIF, we re-analysed another dataset
from asynchronous mESC population [6] marked by the name
“Kolo”. We selected G2M-classified mESCs (using Cyclone)
grown in serum/LIF (37 cells) from the Kolo dataset for analysis.
To enable direct matching of cells from two datasets, we
used scMap [23], a tool that can project cells from one experiment
onto the sub-types identified in another experiment. When
mapping G2M-serum/LIF Kolo mESCs onto our identified cell
cycle sub-states (including both G1 and G2M sub-states), we
identified a match with both G2M-Esrrb-H (18 cells) and G2MEsrrb-L (12 cells) states, verifying the G2M bifurcation (Fig. 4A).
Seven cells out of the 37 Kolo G2M-serum/LIF cells were not
assigned to any of our sub-states (unassigned, Fig. 4A).
To compare the distributions into G2M-Esrrb-H and G2MEsrrb-L sub-states between the Kolo and our data, we plotted the
percentages of cells in each state on a stacked barplot (Fig. 4B).
Slightly higher proportion of G2M cells were at the G2M-Esrrb-H
state in our dataset (83 %) than in the Kolo dataset (60 %),
possibly reflecting differences in cell cycle sorting versus cell cycle

prediction, respectively, or in the duration of G2M. We performed
GSEA between the Kolo G2M-Esrrb-H and G2M-Esrrb-L cells and
observed similarly strong enrichment of the pluripotency gene
expression in the G2M-Esrrb-H compared with G2M-Esrrb-L (Fig.
4C).
It has been demonstrated that mESCs grown in the
presence of GSK-3α/β and MEK1/2 inhibitors (“2i”) mimic “groundstate” pluripotency, a state resembling conditions of the preimplantation embryo [35]. To test whether the naïve G2M-Esrrb-H
state is more similar to the ground state pluripotency, we
performed mapping of the Kolo mESCs cultured both in 2i/LIF and
serum/LIF onto our G2M sub-states. Indeed, all analysed Kolo
2i/LIF cells (G2M-classified) matched with the G2M-Esrrb-H state
(83 cells), whereas the Kolo serum/LIF cells matched either with
G2M-Esrrb-H (17 cells) or G2M-Esrrb-L (10 cells), or were
unassigned (10 cells, Fig. 4D). This result shows that the ‘ground
state’ of pluripotency emerges in serum/LIF cultured mESCs when
in the early G2M phase.
G2M sub-states separate the earliest pre-implantation stages
The naïve and formative G2M sub-states appear to match with the
embryonic stages of the mouse development in vivo and best
distinguish the earliest E3.5 and E4.5 developmental stages as
evidenced by mapping of the data from Mohammed et al., 2017
[21] onto our identified pluripotency sub-states (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, despite distinct growth requirements of the mouse and
human naïve ESCs [36,37], we saw relatively strong matching
between G2M-ESCs from the two species (Fig. 5B) by reverse
mapping of our G2M sub-states onto G2M-classified hESCs [22],
suggesting more conserved regulatory mechanisms of
pluripotency maintenance in G2M that could remain unnoticed
when analysing bulk populations.

DISCUSSION
Developmental heterogeneity in G2M
It is well established that ESC developmental capacity is
coordinated by cell cycle dynamics [8–11]. Accordingly, several
single cell approaches have revealed pluripotent TF heterogeneity
to partly result from differential cell cycle position [6,7,24,38]. In
our study, we provide evidence for the temporal connection
between cell cycle and TF heterogeneities by demonstrating
developmental split of ESCs into distinct pluripotency sub-states
specifically in G2M.
Heterogeneous expression of several pluripotency TFs in
mESCs cultured in serum/LIF [2–5] has been proposed to reflect
a variable developmental progression towards a primed state [39].
We show G2M cell cycle phase to separate mESCs grown in
serum/LIF into TF expression states with reciprocal expression of
naïve and early post-implantation factors, revealing developmental
split of ESCs at later stages of the cell cycle. We did not see such
strong bifurcation in G1 phase, which has been shown to be the
phase when irreversible differentiation decisions are made [10].
The role of G2M in facilitating enhanced maintenance of
pluripotency [8] as well as the earliest selection of ESC fate
direction [9,40] corroborate our findings about the emergence of
alternative pluripotency states in G2M.
We found that the most significant determinant of the
mESC split into naïve versus formative state in G2M is the
differential expression of TF Esrrb. Esrrb has been shown to be
critical for the sustained activity of the naïve pluripotency
regulatory network and in enhanced reprogramming to the naïve
state [41]. Moreover, drop in Esrrb concentration below certain
levels has been shown to trigger exit from naïve pluripotency [42].
Our finding that G2M cells exist either as Esrrb-H or Esrrb-L
populations therefore strongly suggest G2M to be the phase when
the decision to maintain or exit the naïve state is made.

Fig. 5. G2M sub-states separate the earliest
pre-implantation stages A. G2M-classified
cells from the mouse embryo at distinct
developmental stages (data from Mohammed
et al., 2017) mapped to our identified G2M substates. More cells from the pre-implantation
embryo (E3.5 and E4.5) map to the naïve
state, while cells from the peri- and postimplantation embryos (E5.5 and E6.5) map to
the formative state. B. Reverse mapping of our
G2M sub-states to G2M-classified human
ESCs (data from Messmer et al., 2019). Note
the resemblance of the G2M-naïve mESCs
with the G2M-naïve hESCs.

Recently, S/G2M-controlled early ESC differentiation
processes have received attention. mESC differentiation was
shown to be initiated directly after DNA synthesis phase via
mechanisms that involve delayed accumulation of repressive
histone marks [11]. In hESCs, G2 cell cycle pause was required
for initiation of differentiation [9]. A related phenomenon may be
the enhanced capacity of G2M nuclei to reprogram cell fate via
nuclear transfer [43], and higher reprogramming potency via cell
fusion of ESCs in SG2 phase [44]. Therefore, G2M phase may
facilitate change in cell fate in both directions, towards a more
differentiated as well as less differentiated state.
Our most prominent finding that mESC exist in a
significantly distinct pluripotency state with formative features in
G2M builds a connection of ESC state control with the cell cycleregulated chromatin dynamics. The formative state is
hypothesised to be required for transcriptional and epigenetic
remodelling to enable exit from the naïve state [1,30]. Remarkably,
extensive ESC chromatin reorganisation occurs like a clockwork
during each cell division. We hypothesise that the formative state
in G2M may be linked to enhancer landscape switching to enable
lineage specification [45,46]. This state diversion in G2M coincides
with reduced Esrrb and other naïve TF expression, probably
resulting in the decommissioning of the naïve enhancer
landscape. This speculation is supported by findings about the role
of Esrrb in activation of silent enhancers during a reverse
developmental, the reprogramming process [47]. Taken together,
we propose that the pluripotency state diversion in G2M may be
mechanistically related to the extensive chromatin remodelling
taking place in preparation for cell division that directly creates the
epigenetic context for fate choices.
G2M sub-states in vivo and between species
We found our G2M-naïve mESCs to match relatively well with the
G2M cells from the pre-implantation mouse embryo, suggesting
transcriptional recapitulation of the earliest stage of in vivo naivety.
Our preliminary comparison of G2M-phased mESCs and
hESCs revealed noticeable similarity between these species.
Transcriptomic profiling of the human embryo has demonstrated
the expression of Esrrb and Klf2 only in the early inner cell mass
which become downregulated in the pre-implantation epiblast,
suggesting species-specific differences [48–50]. Nonetheless, in
addition to the core pluripotency factors (Pou5f1, Sox2), the
expression of the cell cycle regulators (Mybl2), chromatin
remodelling factors (Jarid2) and factors promoting cell proliferation
(Etv4/5) were shown to be conserved between rodents and human
[48]. This may reflect lower sensitivity of G2M cells from different

species to growth factor signalling and/or indicate partially
redundant
G2M-centred
mechanisms
of
pluripotency
maintenance.
Conclusion
Single cell profiling of mESC expression states during cell cycle
revealed the split of mESCs into naïve and formative pluripotency
states in G2M. These findings demonstrate that mESC
heterogeneity evident in serum/LIF conditions marks distinct
developmental capacity attributable to transitions through late cell
cycle phases.
