Abstract

28

preponderance of extracellular Amyloid-β plaques. These plaques are formed by aggregation

29

of polypeptides that are derived from Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). Amyloid-β plaques

30

are thought to play either a direct or an indirect role in disease progression, however the exact

31

role of aggregation and plaque formation in the ethology of Alzheimer’s Disease is subject to

32

debate, not least because the biological effects of soluble and aggregated Amyloid-β peptides

33

are difficult to separate in vivo. To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-β

34

oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-β

35

peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the

36

crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-β oligomers underlie the pathologies of

37

Alzheimer’s Disease. We show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization

38

of Amyloid-β were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the

39

metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-β oligomerization from

40

Amyloid-β expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-β oligomers also

41

recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD. We show that the

42

lifespan deficit induced by Amyloid-β oligomers was reduced with Li+ treatment. Our results

43

present the first model to separate different aspects of disease progression.

The brains of Alzheimer’s Disease patients show a decrease in brain mass and a

Introduction

46

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating, age-associated, neurodegenerative disease which

47

affects more than 46.8 million people worldwide and represents the 6th leading cause of

48

death in the United States of America (Ahn et al. 2001, Zhang et al. 2011, De-Paula et al.

49

2012, Kumar et al. 2015, Hawkes 2016). Despite extensive efforts over the last 50 years, no

50

disease-modifying therapy has been found and, most recently, several high-profile Phase III

51

clinical trials have failed (Anderson et al. 2017, Lim et al. 2018, Park et al. 2018). AD

52

clinical trial landscape has largely been dominated by the amyloid cascade hypothesis, with

53

more than 50% of the drugs targeting amyloid beta (A) in Phase III trial alone (Cummings

54

et al. 2018). The amyloid cascade hypothesis, in its original form, posits the deposition of

55

A, in particular the extracellular A plaque, as the main driver of AD (Hardy et al. 1992).

56

However, the causative role of A plaque has been challenged recently, not least because of

57

the failure of numerous interventions targeting A plaque in Phase III trials (Cummings

58

2018) and the observation of Aβ plaques in brains of non-AD symptomatic individuals.

59

Model organisms ranging from nematodes to mice have further shown that AD pathology can

60

be modeled in the absence of obvious Aβ plaques (Duff et al. 1996, Fong et al. 2016). These

61

observations point to a different mechanism for Aβ neurotoxicity perhaps through Aβ’s

62

intracellular accumulation (LaFerla et al. 2007).

63
64

Amyloid plaques are macroscopic extracellular protein aggregates, but intracellular Aβ must

65

function in smaller units of single peptides, oligomers or aggregates. Of these, soluble Aβ

66

oligomers appear to be the main toxic species in AD (Ferreira et al. 2011). For example, Aβ

67

oligomers have been shown to induce neurotoxic effects including memory loss in transgenic

68

animal models (reviewed in (Mroczko et al. 2018)). These studies, however, mostly rely on

69

in vitro injection of synthetic Aβ oligomers or oligomers extracted from AD brains

70

(Mroczko, Groblewska et al. 2018). There is currently a lack of tools that can directly control

71

Aβ oligomerization in vivo, which will allow direct examination of the effects of Aβ

72

oligomerization.

73
74

Here we describe an optogenetic method to study Amyloid-β (Aβ) protein oligomerization in

75

vivo in different model organisms and apply it to delineating mechanisms of disease

76

progression. Optogenetics hinges on light responsive proteins that can be fused to genes of

77

interest, allowing for the spatial and temporal regulation of proteins in a highly precise

78

manner. Temporal-spatial control is achieved simply by the exposure of the target system to

79

lights of a specific wavelength, without the need to introduce other external agents (Fenno et

80

al. 2011).

81

cryptochrome2 (CRY2) protein, oligomerizes quickly and reversibly in the presence of blue

82

light at 488nm. CRY2 fusion proteins have, for instance, been used to study cortical actin

83

dynamics in cell contractility during tissue morphogenesis, the dynamics of Wnt and EGF

84

signaling, plasma membrane composition and transcriptional regulation (Kennedy et al. 2010,

Idevall-Hagren et al. 2012, Guglielmi et al. 2015, Huang et al. 2017, Johnson et al. 2017,

Kaur et al. 2017).

One such optogenetic protein, a modified version of the Arabidopsis

88

To address the role of aggregation of intracellular Aβ in the pathophysiological effects of

89

AD, we developed a light-inducible system for use in model organisms. Specifically, we

90

generated an in vivo, light-dependent, oligomerization switch for the formation and

91

dissolution of Aβ oligomers in Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio

98

We generated transgenic animals expressing the 42-amino-acid human Aβ peptide (Aβ1-42)

99

fused to Cryptochrome2 and the fluorescent protein mCherry (Aβ-CRY2-mCh). Drosophila

100

lines were under the control of the GAL4/UAS system(Brand et al. 1993) and expressed

101

either ubiquitously via AD-Gal4 driver (Figure 1b-c) or specifically in neurons using Elav-

102

Gal4 driver (Figure 1d-e, S1). C. elegans lines were made with the heat shock promoter

103

(Figure 1f-h, S2). In order to observe oligomerization and clustering of intracellular Aβ, we

104

took a live imaging approach in Drosophila embryos using a lightsheet microscope with a

105

488nm laser activating CRY2 and the 561nm laser imaging mCh over time. We observed

106

clusters of mCh fluorescence forming in embryos exposed to 488nm light, but fewer in

107

embryos that were not exposed to blue light (Figure S3, Movies 1-2). The intensity of the

108

clusters was quantified using Imaris quantification software to show the intensity of oligomer

109

formation (Figure 1c).

111

We proceeded to test the effectiveness of light induced clustering of Aβ-CRY2-mCh in C.

112

elegans. As this construct is driven by a heat shock promoter, worms were heat shocked at

113

35°C for 90 minutes followed by resting at 20°C before being immobilized and imaged using

114

confocal microscopy (Figure 1f-h). We observed an increase in clusters in worms exposed to

115

blue light over their siblings not exposed to blue light. The results were quantified as

116

fluorescence intensity and represented in (Figure 1h) showing the formation of Aβ clusters.

117

Even though the CRY2 system predominantly oligomerizes, we also observed the formation

118

of intracellular Aβ aggregates, using a direct stain for Aβ aggregates (Figure S4).

119

Importantly, we observed that Aβ aggregation was not reversible as had previously been

120

observed for signaling molecules(Huang, Amourda et al. 2017, Johnson, Goyal et al. 2017,

121

Kaur, Saunders et al. 2017), rather CRY2 appears to initiate clustering leading to Aβ bundles

122

that do not come apart once blue light is turned off. We further confirmed that turning on

123

blue light alone without the transgene expression did not lead to any Aβ expression or cluster

124

formation (Figure S2b, Ab HS L vs Ab –HS L), suggesting that the oligomerization process

125

is CRY2-specific and not an artifact of light. Together, our results showed that the Aβ-

126

CRY2-mCh transgene is functional in both organisms, with a high specificity to blue light,

127

which induces irreversible oligomerization of Aβ.

128
129

Light-inducible Aβ oligomerization causes lifespan and behavioral deficits in transgenic

130

models

131

To test the functionality of Aβ-CRY2-mCh, we next looked for phenotypes associated with

132

light-induced intracellular Aβ oligomerization. We performed lifespan studies to assess the

133

effects of Aβ-CRY2-mCh by expressing Aβ-CRY2-mCh either ubiquitously (AD-Gal4) or

134

specifically in the nervous system (Elav-Gal4). Newly eclosed adult flies were separated into

135

two groups in each case, one of which was exposed to ambient white light and the other kept

136

in the dark. In both cases, flies exposed to light died much more quickly with half the mean

137

and maximum lifespans (Figure 2a-b) compared to those reared in the dark. We extended

138

this analysis to C. elegans, though starting at Day 6 due to the heat-shock manipulation step.

139

Under light conditions, C. elegans showed markedly decreased lifespans as compared to the

140

transgenic C. elegans kept in dark conditions (Figure 2c). Most significantly, we observed

141

that the lifespan decrease was reversible, as taking animals exposed to light for 24 days and

142

moving them into darkness showed a recovery of their lifespan, or a rescue (Figure 2a-b). To

143

ensure that these reduced lifespans were physiological, we examined the fitness of the

144

animals. Fitness was severely decreased in light-exposed flies and worms as quantified by

145

fertility and locomotive assays (Figure S5). Interestingly, light-induced Aβ oligomerization

146

caused further impairment in sensorimotor function of transgenic Aβ nematodes (Figure

147

S5c). These results suggest that light-induced oligomerization of Aβ not only affected

148

lifespan and fitness, but also impaired complex sensorimotor function related to

149

neurobehavior.

150
151

Light-inducible Aβ oligomerization leads to physical and metabolic damage in

152

transgenic models

153

The lethality mediated by light-induced Aβ oligomerization led us to examine the

154

morphological effects of Aβ-CRY2-mCh clustering during embryonic stages in Drosophila.

155

Embryos expressing Aβ in only the nervous system developed at a normal pace and did not

156

show any morphogenetic defects and even hatched when in the absence of blue light (Movie

157

1). In contrast, sibling embryos exposed to blue laser light arrested in late neurogenesis

158

stages where the central nervous system stopped developing and the embryos died (Movie 2

159

and Figure S3, S6). These embryos showed a variety of abnormalities in the positioning of

160

neurons and glial cells (Compare to complete normal development, Movie 3) suggesting that

161

light-induced Aβ oligomerization causes physical, structural damage that affects neuronal

162

development.

163
164

The severity of the physical damage phenotype in embryos exposed to blue light (Figure 3a-

165

d’’) led us to investigate the differences in mechanism between the two conditions by

166

exploring inflammatory response, mitochondrial health and oxidative damage. Expression of

167

Aβ alone, without light-induced Aβ oligomerization, led to a small increase in inflammatory

168

markers (Figure 3e)(Westfall et al. 2018). In embryos exposed to light, two of these markers

169

increased to a much greater level (Figure 3e). We observed a significant reduction the

170

number of mitochondria light-treated Aβ animals (Figure 3f). Markers of oxidative damage

171

in light and dark exposed C. elegans showed differential expression of antioxidant defense

172

genes, specifically Catalase, Trx-2 and Sod-3, suggestive of the occurrence of oxidative stress

173

induced by Aβ oligomerization (Figure 4). These results suggested that light-induced Aβ

174

oligomerization phenocopies many of the hallmarks of AD.

175
176

We proceeded to look at light-induced Aβ oligomerization in metabolic impairments in

177

transgenic C. elegans. Heat-shocked mutants exposed to light (Aβ HS L) had lower ATP

178

levels compared to the non-transgenic control (Ctrl -HS D) (Figure 5). However, heat-

179

shocked mutants in dark condition (Aβ HS D) did not show any significant differences in

180

ATP level compared to the non-transgenic control. This result suggested that presence of Aβ

181

alone is insufficient to induce ATP deficits, and that light-induced oligomerization of Aβ is

182

required for the defect to manifest. Aβ expression alone was also insufficient to affect the

183

nematodes’ maximum respiratory capacity, as heat-shocked mutants in dark condition (Aβ

184

HS D) did not display differences in maximum and spare respiration capacity compared to

185

control animals (Ctrl -HS D). However, light-induced Aβ oligomerization significantly

186

reduced maximum respiration capacity in C. elegans. Heat-shocked mutants in the light

187

condition (Aβ HS L) displayed significantly lower maximum and spare respiration capacity

188

compared to controls (Ctrl -HS D) and to heat-shocked mutants in the dark condition (Aβ HS

189

D) (Figure 5b-d). Together, these results highlight the metabolic differences between the two

190

conditions and show that metabolic deficits are mediated by light-induced Aβ

191

oligomerization.

192
193

Light-inducible Aβ lifespan decrease is rescued by Li+.

194

Among the mechanisms for neuroprotection, the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in

195

modulating AD pathology and its progression (De Ferrari et al. 2003, Toledo et al. 2009, Parr

196

et al. 2015, Jin et al. 2017). Activation of Wnt signaling through lithium (Li+) treatment

197

attenuated Aβ aggregation and increased the lifespan of Aβ models (Toledo and Inestrosa

198

2009). By inhibiting the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), Li+ compounds drive

199

the downstream production of intracellular β-catenin activating the Wnt–β-catenin signaling

200

pathway(Klein et al. 1996).

201

impairment and neurodegeneration induced by Aβ fibrils(De Ferrari, Chacón et al. 2003).

202

Taken together, these studies point to a putative AD therapeutic intervention that is based on

203

the activation of the Wnt signaling cascade through Li+. To test the usefulness of optogenetic

204

Aβ for drug testing, we supplemented the food for Drosophila expressing Aβ-CRY2-mCh

205

with Li+.

206

lifespans, suggesting a rescue effect induced by Li+ (Figure 2a-b), and that the optogenetic

207

model can be used for inducible expression drug testing. Rapid drug testing can be also be

208

achieved through cell culture. We extended this assay to HEK293 cells transfected with Aβ-

209

CRY2-mCh. These showed Aβ clusters forming upon stimulation with blue light, but the

210

clustering was ameliorated by the addition of Li+ or the specific GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021

Li+ treatment through Wnt activation also rescued behavioral

Drosophila exposed to light, but consuming Li+ had significantly increased

(Figure S7). These data demonstrate the potential use of our optogenetics system for drug

212

testing.

Finally, we also extended these findings to a vertebrate system. We generated a zebrafish

215

permanent line with UAS: Aβ-CRY2-mCh in the transgenic TgBAC(gng8:GAL4) c416

background (Hong et al. 2013). We observed a diffuse mCh fluorescence in a small subset

217

of neurons in the olfactory epithelium, the interpeduncular nucleus and in a few neurons

sparsely distributed in the forebrain at 5 dpf. Upon blue light exposure (488 nM) the

detectable intensity of the fluorescence increased rapidly (Figure S8).

Discussion

223

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that induced

224

oligomerization of intracellular Aβ mediates AD pathologies and that different pathologies

225

(induced by Aβ oligomerization vs expression alone) are separable. Previous approaches

226

lacked an inducible oligomerization tool and could only demonstrate Aβ oligomers’ toxicity

227

through exogenous injection of Aβ oligomers (Mroczko, Groblewska et al. 2018). We use a

228

tool to investigate the pathological effects of intracellular Aβ oligomerization in nematodes

229

and flies, human kidney cells, and in the vertebrate model organism zebrafish (Figure S8,

230

Movie 4). In all three systems, the CRY2 initiated clumping of Aβ that appeared to be

231

irreversible likely due to the structure of the aggregates (Antzutkin et al. 2012). Consistent

232

with existing literature showing that Aβ oligomers induce oxidative stress and

233

inflammation(Butterfield et al. 2013, Forloni et al. 2018), we show that light-induced

234

oligomerization of Aβ, but not Aβ expression alone, is necessary for the metabolic defects,

235

loss of mitochondria and inflammation in C. elegans and Drosophila. Light-induced

236

oligomerization also leads to physical damage of the nervous system, resembling the loss of

237

brain tissue in AD (Figure S8). The embryonic assay for physical damage phenocopies brain

238

lesions only to some extent as the extent of the damage is enhanced by the forces applied to

239

the developing neural tissue. The irreversibility of Aβ aggregates once initiated as seen here,

240

also hints at intrinsic properties that may be unique or unusual to this peptide and warrants

241

further investigation. It is also likely to prove a good model for testing anti-aggregation

242

compounds.

243
244

We anticipate that our approach will serve as an attractive tool for carrying out drug screens

245

and mechanistic studies for the treatment of AD.

246

undoubtedly complement other techniques due to the high level of spatiotemporal specificity.

247

For example, it could be optimally positioned to gain insights into the unresolved mechanism

248

of Aβ - whether oligomerization and subsequent accumulation or lack of effective clearance

249

underpins AD pathologies. The separation of two phases of AD progression also suggests

250

that single drug treatments will not suffice, and perhaps combinatorial approaches should be

251

tried.

This optogenetic strategy will also

Molecular Cloning of Optogenetic Transgenes

258

DNA sequences corresponding to the human Amyloidβ1-42 amino acid sequence were

synthesized (IDT) into a Gateway technology (Invitrogen) entry vector. The human Aβ1-42

260

sequence was used for Drosophila and zebrafish due to close evolutionary conservation and a

261

nematode-codon-optimized version of Aβ1-42 was used for C. elegans (Fong et al. 2016).

The CRY2-mCh fragment was cloned into pDONR vector with attB5 and attB2 sites, and

263

MultiSite Gateway® Pro 2.0 recombination (Invitrogen) was used to recombine donor

264

plasmids and pDONR-CRY2-mCh into the respective destination vectors for three model

265

organisms:

b) pDEST-hsp-16-2p, a kind gift from Hidehito Kuroyanagi (Medical Research Institute,

269

Tokyo Medical and Dental University) to synthesize hsp-16-2p-Aβ-CRY2-mCh for C.

270

elegans (Okazaki et al. 2012).

containing 6g Bacto agar, 114g glucose, 56g cornmeal, 25g Brewer’s yeast and 20ml of 10%

300

Nipagin in 1L final volume. Transgenic Drosophila and controls were distributed into either

301

dark or light condition on Day 1. C. elegans were maintained as previously described at

302

20oC(Stiernagle). Age-synchronized nematodes were generated by hypochlorite bleaching.

303

250µM of 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (FUDR) was added to prevent progeny production in all

304

experiments except for fertility assays. For Fertility assay, normal Nematode Growth Media

305

(NGM) agar plates were used. To induce expression of Aβ-CRY2-mCh, Day 4 young adult

306

worms were heat shocked at 35⁰C for 90 minutes, and subsequently incubated at 20⁰C for a

307

day (Day 5) for recovery. The heat-shocked transgenic Day 6 C. elegans were then separated

308

into dark or light condition and was maintained at 20⁰C throughout the experimental period.

309

Non-heat shock controls were used for lifespan, fertility and locomotion studies.

310
311

Lifespan Assays

312

Drosophila and C. elegans were counted daily for the number of dead subjects and the

313

number of censored subjects (excluded from the study). Drosophila that failed to respond to

314

taps were scored as dead and those stuck to the food were censored. C. elegans that failed to

315

respond to plate-tapping were scored as dead, those that burrowed to the side of the plate

316

were censored.

317
318

Locomotion assay

319

Drosophila locomotion was assessed using an established geotaxis assay previous described

320

in(Rival et al. 2009). In brief, 25 Drosophila were enclosed in a plastic column (25cm tall,

321

with a 1.5cm internal diameter) and were tapped to the bottom. The number of Drosophila at

322

the top (Ntop) of the column, and that at the bottom (Nbot) were counted after 20 seconds.

323

Three trials with the same sample were performed within 30 seconds interval. Performance

324

index was defined as (15+Ntop-Nbot)/30.

325
326

Heat-shocked C. elegans were assessed at Day 9, by placing worms onto individual NGM

327

plates, pre-spotted with Escherichia coli OP50. C. elegans were placed on the side of the

328

bacteria spot on the NGM plate using a platinum worm picker and were left undisturbed to

329

move freely for 15 minutes. Distance travelled was determined by imaging and measuring of

330

worm tracks on bacteria using a stereomicroscope.

331
332

Fertility assay

333

25 pairs of male & female Drosophila expressing MD-Aβ-Cry2-mCh were kept in a single

334

tube under dark or light conditions. The number of eggs laid were scored after 5 hours 30

335

minutes for Days 5, 6, 7, 13, 14 and 20. Day 5 heat-shocked C. elegans were transferred onto

336

individual NGM plates spotted with E. Coli. Each worm was transferred to a fresh plate daily

337

from Day 6 to Day 8, allowing 24 hours’ egg laying period. The number of new young

338

worms were counted on each plate as the progeny of a single individual.

339
340

Food race assay

341

Food race assay adapted from Nyamsuren et al.(Nyamsuren et al. 2007) was conducted using

342

94mm NGM plates seeded with 0.2mL of OP50-1 at a designated food spot. A starting spot

343

60mm away from the food spot was marked on the plate. 30 D2 adult worms from each

344

condition 24hrs post heat-shock were placed on the starting spot and left to roam at room

345

temperature. After 15min, the number of worms that reached the food spot and the number of

346

worms that left the starting spot were tabulated. Mobility index was calculated by dividing

347

the number of worms that reached the food spot by the number of worms that left the starting

348

spot. 3 technical repeats were conducted for each condition.

349
350

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay

351

ATP assay using firefly lantern extract (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed as described by

352

Tsujimoto(Tsujimoto et al. 1970). 100 D2 adult worms from each condition 24hr post heat-

353

shock were freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen and sonicated in 10% Trichloroacetic acid

354

(TCA) buffer. The extracted ATP from the different conditions and ATP standards were

356

measured using a Cytation 3 Imaging Reader (Biotek).

357
358

Mitochondrial metabolic flux assay

359

Mitochondrial metabolic flux assay was performed as described by Fong et al.(Fong et al.

360

2017). 60 D2 adult worms from each condition 24hr post heat-shock were transferred to a 96-

361

well Seahorse plate containing M9 buffer. The plate was loaded into the XF96 Extracellular

362

Flux Analyzer (Seahorse) which measures the animal’s basal and maximum respiratory

363

capacity.

364
365

Light-sheet microscopy

366

Drosophila embryos were dechorionated using bleach, rinsed twice with water and dried, and

367

loaded into a capillary filled with 1% low-melting agarose Type VII-A in water (Sigma)

368

(Colosimo et al. 2006). C.elegans and D. rerio were embedded directly in the agarose.

369

Samples were imaged with a Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. Cry2 was activated by a dual-side

370

illumination with 10% power 488nm laser for 29.95ms for every 2.5minutes for 500 cycles.

371

Controls were only exposed to 561nm. Images were acquired with a water immersion

372

objective at 10x/0.2 Illumination Optics and W Plan-Apochromat 20x.1.0 UV-VIS

373

detection objective (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Image data were processed using the maximum

374

intensity projection function of ZEN 2014 SP software (Carl Zeiss, Germany), and were

375

analyzed with ImageJ (NIH) and IMARIS 9.0 (Bitplane AG, UK).

376
377

Transfection and Live cell confocal microscopy

378

Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in

379

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Penicillin and

380

Streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at 80% confluence on 35mm TC treated glass

381

bottom dish 24 hours prior to transfection with 2.5mg of pDEST40-Aβ-CRY2-mCh using the

382

Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Untransfected cells were used as negative control.

383

Cells were imaged 24 hours after transfection using the Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope

384

with 63x oil immersion lens.

385
386

Immunofluorescence & Confocal microscopy

391

processing as described in(Colosimo and Tolwinski 2006).

392
393

Primary antibodies used were the glial cell marker anti-Repo (mouse mAb, 8D12) and the

394

neuronal cell marker anti-Elav (rat mAb, 7EA810) from Developmental Studies Hybridoma

395

Bank (DSHB developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University

396

of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA 52242). Secondary antibodies

397

used were Alexa Flour 488 anti-rat and Alexa Flour 647 anti-mouse (Invitrogen).

398
399

For detection of Aβ aggregates, thioflavin T (ThT) staining were performed as previously

400

described (Iijima et al. 2008). Formaldehyde-fixed embryos were incubated in 50% EtOH

401

containing 0.1% ThT (Sigma) overnight. Embryos were destained in 50% EtOH for 10

402

minutes, followed by three washes in PBS. Embryos were then mounted on microscope

403

slides using Aquapolymount (Polysciences, Inc.).

404
405

Images were acquired on the Zeiss LSM 800 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using the following

406

settings: 1% laser power for 488nm; 5% laser power for 561nm; 2% laser power for 647nm.

407

Images were processed using the ZEN 2014 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and Imaris

408

(Bitplane AG).

409
410

RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and qPCR

411

Drosophila embryos 9 hours after deposition were incubated at 25°C in either light or dark

412

conditions for 13 hours were used. Embryos were dechorionated and washed with 100%

413

ethanol prior to RNA extraction using the ISOLATE II RNA Mini Kit’s protocol (Bioline,

414

UK). The extracted RNA was quantified using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA

415

synthesis was done according to the SensiFAST™ cDNA Synthesis Kit‘s protocol (Bioline).

416

Primers pairs used: AttA, IMD, DptA, Def, Duox, Rel, catalase, Prdx3, Trx1, Trx2, SOD-1,

417

SOD-2, SOD-3 and reference gene Rpl32. Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR®

418

Green. Expression data were normalized to the dark controls. For mitochondrial copy

419

number, the above collection method was used except the following: the embryos were stored

420

in tritonX-100 and the primers used were Mitochondria Cytochrome b (MtCyb) and reference

421

Image Data & Statistical Analysis

425

Aβ aggregates were quantified in Drosophila using ImageJ (NIH) and in C. elegans with

426

IMARIS. For statistical analysis of the expression of genes, student’s t-test was used for

427

except for cases where the data showed unequal standard deviation (F-test, p<0.05), in which

428

the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was performed. Statistical analysis of lifespan studies

429

and behavioral assays were performed using OASIS2 6. The number of samples was

430

determined empirically. All graphs were plotted using Graphpad PRISM 6 (Graphpad

431

Software).

Figure S1. Transgenic Drosophila model expressing Aβ-CRY2-mCh. (a-d) Still images
from lightsheet timelapse microscopy of Elav-Gal4/UAS-Aβ-CRY2-mCh in neurons detected
by mCh fluorescence (red) in transgenic Drosophila embryos at different developmental stages.
(e) Aβ localization to neuronal cell body volume in a Drosophila embryo expressing the
mentioned construct.
Figure S2. Exposure to light drives Aβ aggregation in C. elegans strains 24h post heatshock. (a) Confocal microscopy images of mutant C. elegans 24 hours post heat-shock at 20x
magnification in Aβ -HS L (no heat shock, exposed to light), Aβ HS L (with heat shock,
exposed to light) and Aβ HS D (with heat shock, kept in the dark) conditions. Aβ -HS L worms
are used as a control for quantifying baseline Aβ expression. Distinct puncta (yellow) can be
seen in animals in Aβ HS L condition. No red fluorescence was observed in control animals
without the transgene (not shown). (b) Quantification of intensity of red fluorescence measured
in the animals in Aβ HS L (n = 13), Aβ HS D (n = 9) and Aβ -HS L (n = 5) conditions 24 hours
post heat-shock. Difference in expression between Aβ HS L conditions and Aβ -HS L is
statistically significant (p = 0.034). (C) Quantification of total area of bright puncta in the
animals in Aβ HS L (n = 13), and Aβ HS D (n = 9) conditions 24 hours post heat-shock.
Difference in area of fluorescence between Aβ HS L conditions and Aβ HS D is statistically
significant (p = 0.031).
Figure S3. Light-induced Aβ aggregation in Drosophila embryos resulted in distinct
developmental defects. (a) Still images from a 24-hours recording of Elav-Gal4/UAS-AβCRY2-mCh aggregates in a Drosophila embryo without blue light illumination resulted in
normal development. Time stages t=1-6 showed embryonic development stages 12-13 (~440620 minutes after fertilization), where germ band retraction starts and ends respectively. Germ
band was 5.125mm at t=1, and retracted to 2.875mm by t=6. (b) Still images from a 24-hours
recording of Elav-Gal4/UAS-Aβ-CRY2-mCh aggregates in a Drosophila embryo with blue
light illumination every 2.5 minutes resulted in the arrest of embryogenesis during late germ
band retraction stages. Time stages t=1-6 showed embryonic development from late stage 10
to early stage 12 (~300-460 minutes after fertilization), where germ band retraction begins
(stage 12). Germ band was 5.125mm at t=1, and retracted only to 4.25mm by t=6. (c) Still
images from a 24-hours recording of uniform expression AD-Gal4/UAS-Aβ-CRY2-mCh
aggregates in a Drosophila embryo without blue light illumination resulted in normal
development. Time stages t=1-6 showed embryonic development stages 14-16 (~620-900
minutes after fertilization), where dorsal closure of midgut and epidermis and shortening of
ventral nerve cord occurs. In this case, the ventral nerve cord shortening was not clearly visible.
(d) Still images from a 24-hours recording of AD-Gal4/UAS-Aβ-CRY2-mCh aggregates in a
Drosophila embryo with blue light illumination at every 2.5 minutes resulted in the arrest of
embryogenesis at dorsal closure stages. Time stages t=1-6 corresponded to embryonic
development stage 14 (approximately 620 – 680 minutes after fertilization), where dorsal
closure begins.

embryo exposed to light. (a, b) were imaged at 20x. (c, d) were magnified images of the box in
(a, b) imaged at 63x.

Figure S5. Aβ-CRY2-mCh expressing transgenic C. elegans and Drosophila reared in
light showed signs of reduced fitness. (a) Exposing Aβ-CRY2-mCh C. elegans to blue
light significantly reduced progeny numbers. Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.1. Data were sampled
over three days (Days 6-8), n=8 light and dark worms. (b) MD-Gal4 driven Aβ-CRY2-mCh
transgenic Drosophila produced significantly lower number of progeny when exposed to blue
light. Two-way ANOVA ****p < 0.0001. Data were sampled on Days 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, and 20,
n= 25 light and dark pairs of Drosophila. (c) Aβ-CRY2-mCh C. elegans have significantly
reduced locomotive ability when reared in light. Distance travelled was reduced by about
three-folds compared to the dark control and non-heat shocked control. Data were sampled on
Days 9 and 10, two-way ANOVA **p < 0.01 n= 6 light, dark and non-heat shocked controls.
(d) Climbing assay showed that transgenic Aβ Drosophila displayed sensorimotor
impairments when exposed to light. Two-way ANOVA ****p < 0.0001. n= 18 light and dark
conditions.

GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (positive control) show little clustering of the light-induced AβCRY2-mCh. Fewer cellular vacuoles observed. (c) HEK cells treated with lithium chloride
shows homogenous expression of Aβ-CRY2-mCh, whereby blue light illumination did not
result in significant clustering of Aβ-CRY2-mCh.
