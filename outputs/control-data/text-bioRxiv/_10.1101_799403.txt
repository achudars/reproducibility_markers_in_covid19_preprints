Anti-CRISPRs (Acrs) are small proteins that inhibit the RNA-guided DNA targeting activity of
CRISPR-Cas enzymes. Encoded by bacteriophage and phage-derived bacterial genes, Acrs
prevent CRISPR-mediated inhibition of phage infection and can also block CRISPR-Casmediated genome editing in eukaryotic cells. To identify Acrs capable of inhibiting
Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SauCas9), an alternative to the most commonly used genome
editing protein Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), we used both self-targeting CRISPR
screening and guilt-by-association genomic search strategies. Here we describe three new potent
inhibitors of SauCas9 that we name AcrIIA13, AcrIIA14 and AcrIIA15. These inhibitors share a
conserved N-terminal sequence that is dispensable for anti-CRISPR function, and have divergent
C-termini that are required in each case for selective inhibition of SauCas9-catalyzed DNA
cleavage. In human cells, we observe robust and specific inhibition of SauCas9-induced genome
editing by AcrIIA13 and moderate inhibition by AcrIIA14 and AcrIIA15. We also find that the
conserved N-terminal domain of AcrIIA13-15 binds to an inverted repeat sequence in the
promoter of these Acr genes, consistent with its predicted helix-turn-helix DNA binding
structure. These data demonstrate an effective strategy for Acr discovery and establish
AcrIIA13-15 as unique bifunctional inhibitors of SauCas9.

Introduction
CRISPR systems are RNA-guided, adaptive immune systems that defend prokaryotes against
invading mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (1). However, some MGEs, particularly phages, have
evolved anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), peptide inhibitors of Cas proteins that block CRISPR defense
systems (2, 3). Acrs have been discovered to inhibit distinct CRISPR systems, including type I
(4-8), type II (9-16), type III (17, 18), and type V (7, 19). Strategies for identifying new Acrs
include testing genes of unknown function that are proximal to anti-CRISPR associated (aca)
genes (5-7, 9, 15) and screening genes in organisms with self-targeting CRISPR systems (7, 19,
20).
The frequent clustering of Acr and aca genes together allows for a ‘guilt-by-association’
approach that quickly identifies potential Acr candidates for experimental testing, but requires a
known Acr or aca gene to seed the search (5-7, 9, 15). Conversely, self-targeting CRISPR
systems represent diverse genomes that could encode corresponding CRISPR-Cas inhibitors to
block autoimmunity (21) (Fig. 1A), but finding relevant Acr-encoding genes within these
genomes can be daunting. Nonetheless, analysis of known Acrs suggests that self-targeting
CRISPR-containing genomes are attractive to study because they often encode at least one
corresponding Acr (19).
Multiple anti-CRISPR (Acr) families inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) and
various Cas12a proteins, and can be used in cell-based experiments to control genome editing
outcomes (7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 22, 23). Although weak cross-reactivity with other non-cognate
Cas9 orthologs has been detected for a subset of these, we wondered whether more potent and
selective inhibitors of particular Cas9 variants might exist in nature. To address this question, we
focused on Staphylococcus genomes that might encode inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9

(SauCas9), a genome editing alternative to SpyCas9 whose smaller size could offer advantages
for delivery into mammalian cells (24, 25). We used a combination of self-targeting CRISPR
screening and guilt-by-association genomic searches to discover three new peptide inhibitors of
SauCas9. We show that these SauCas9 Acrs, AcrIIA13, AcrIIA14 and AcrIIA15, limit or
prevent RNA-guided DNA cleavage in vitro and genome editing in human cells. These three
inhibitors share a common N-terminal domain with a predicted helix-turn-helix structure that is
dispensable for Acr function but can bind specifically to the inverted repeat sequence in the
promoter of these Acr genes. The C-terminus of each Acr is distinct and is responsible for
SauCas9 inhibition in each case, likely by differing mechanisms. These SauCas9 inhibitors
provide new tools for the selective control of genome editing outcomes, and validate a multipronged strategy for discovering diverse Acrs in nature.

Results
Bioinformatic identification of self-targeting type II-A CRISPR systems
To identify potential new Acrs that inhibit SauCas9, we first used the Self-Target Spacer
Searcher (STSS) (19) to query all Staphylococcus species deposited in NCBI for instances of
CRISPR self-targeting. We observed 99 total instances of self-targeting in Staphylococcus
CRISPR systems across 43 different strains out of a potential 11,910 assemblies searched (Table
S1). Of the 99 self-targeting instances predicted, 50 could not be attributed to any particular
CRISPR subtype, 48 were associated with a type II-A system, and one occurred as part of a type
III-A system. We did not observe any self-targeting CRISPR type I-C systems that are
occasionally found in Staphylococcus (26). It should also be noted that 29 of the predicted

CRISPR self-targeting systems occurred in eight species whose CRISPR loci were manually
annotated as type II-A based on identity to other type II-A Cas9-encoding genes.
To select the genomes most likely to contain Acrs, we filtered the list of 48 self-targets to
exclude those with target protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) that were more than one
indel/mutation away from the known 3′-NNGRR(T) PAM for SauCas9 (25). This step
eliminated genomes in which an incorrect PAM sequence could explain survival, without the
need for Acrs. The remaining 14 self-targeting instances, belonging to 12 different strains (Table
S1), were ranked according to similarity of their encoded Cas9 and SauCas9 (Table S2). Of the
seven Cas9s displaying high similarity to SauCas9 (>50% identity with blastp), two species,
Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus schleiferi, were selected for further screening
for Acrs active against SauCas9 based on strain availability.

Self-targeting screen for Acr activity
To reduce the sequence space to search for Acr genes, we selected only one of the two selftargeting strains identified for each species (S. schleiferi and S. haemolyticus), since the two
strains of each respective species contained highly similar genomic sequences and MGE content.
The S. schleiferi strain 5909-02 was chosen for having three self-targets vs. the two self-targets
present in strain 2713-03, and S. haemolyticus strain W_75, containing a single self-target, was
selected arbitrarily over strain W_139 (Fig. S1).
To first assess whether the CRISPR systems in S. schleiferi and S. haemolyticus are
active, we generated amplicons encoding the Cas9, Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2 of each system under
their natural promoters and a plasmid expressing a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) for SauCas9 (27).
Two versions of the sgRNA were designed, one targeting a superfolder GFP reporter (sfGFP)

and the other containing a non-targeting sequence. We co-expressed each amplicon with the
targeting or control sgRNA-encoding plasmid, and a plasmid encoding sfGFP, in a cell-free
transcription-translation extract (TXTL) (19, 28). We observed a strong reduction in sfGFP
expression in the TXTL reaction mixtures expressing the targeting, but not the non-targeting,
sgRNAs (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that the native type II-A CRISPR systems in both S.
schleiferi strain 5909-02 and S. haemolyticus strain W_75 are active.
Nearly all currently known Acrs can be found in MGE sequences, especially phages,
highlighting their use as a CRISPR counter-defense mechanism (3). Therefore, we examined the
genomes of both S. schleiferi and S. haemolyticus for integrated MGEs using PHASTER (29)
and Islander (30) to identify potential hotspots that might harbor Acrs. We found four predicted
MGEs in S. schleiferi strain 5909-02 and eight in the contigs of the S. haemolyticus strain W_75
assembly. We then designed 27 genome fragment (GF) amplicons in total covering all the
predicted sequences, each up to ~10 kb, with the goal of best capturing complete operons
wherever possible (Table S3). We then prepared TXTL reactions containing DNA encoding the
sfGFP reporter, the sgRNA-encoding plasmid, a GF amplicon, and the associated Cas proteinencoding amplicon from the GF’s source organism. By comparing GFP expression over time, we
found that the presence of GF5 from S. schleiferi corresponded to nearly complete inhibition of
Cas9-mediated sfGFP knockdown (Fig. 2A). We observed no inhibitory activity in the presence
of any GFs derived from S. haemolyticus.
S. schleiferi GF5 contains eight genes (Fig. 2B), most of which are predicted to be part of
the lactose metabolic pathway. Genes 1 and 2, however, have no predicted function. We cloned
each gene from GF5 into a heterologous plasmid under the control of a pTet promoter and
repeated the TXTL assay with each cloned gene individually in place of the GF5 amplicon. We

observed that gene 2 alone produced the inhibitory effect previously observed with the complete
GF5 (Fig. 2C). This gene was named AcrIIA13 to indicate its inhibition of a CRISPR type II-A
system, in accord with standard Acr nomenclature (22). There is also a homologous protein,
AcrIIA13a, found within GF8, and although no inhibitory activity from GF8 was ever observed,
when AcrIIA13a is expressed separately using the pTet expression plasmid, it does exhibit
inhibitory activity (Fig. 2D).

‘Guilt-by-association’ identification of SauCas9 Acrs
We wondered whether AcrIIA13 or the neighboring gene in its operon (GF5 gene 1) might be
associated with other Acrs, and whether these inhibitors might have the ability to block activity
of the SauCas9 protein. We first searched AcrIIA13 homologs to find potential Acr candidates
co-occurring with it (Fig. S2A). While we did find a truncated homolog missing the AcrIIA13 Nterminus, AcrIIA13b, we did not observe any new genes commonly found near AcrIIA13.
However, when we searched for homologs of GF5 gene 1, we found that they occur widely in
bacteria (Fig. S2B), a typical hallmark of aca genes (6, 9, 10, 15). We identified genes that
frequently co-occur with GF5 gene 1 and selected them as an initial set of Acr candidates. Then,
because many Acrs are clustered together, we also added genes that co-occurred with the initially
chosen Acr candidates to create the final test set. This set of ten candidate Acr genes was cloned
into the pTet expression plasmid for further analysis.
Each of the ten new candidate Acr genes was tested in the TXTL sfGFP depletion
experiment, this time using SauCas9 expressed from a recombinant plasmid. After ten hours, we
observed that TXTL reaction mixtures for two of the new Acr candidates, candidate 1 and
candidate 10, expressed GFP levels that were significantly above the baseline (Fig. 2E and S3).

Candidate 1, hereafter referred to as AcrIIA14, is phylogenetically associated with a close
homolog of GF5 gene 1 and occurs in Staphylococcus simulans strain 19, which had previously
passed the PAM filtering step for self-targeting Staphylococcus genomes and has a Cas9 closely
related to SauCas9 (86% identical via blastp) (Table S2). Although candidate 10, hereafter
referred to as AcrIIA15, does not occur in a CRISPR-self-targeting strain, a close homolog (80%
identical via blastp) can be found in S. pseudintermedius strain 104N, which is self-targeting
(Fig. S2, Table S1).

Reconstitution of Acr activity against SauCas9
To examine the inhibitory activity detected in the TXTL experiments with AcrIIA13-15, we
purified each Acr protein and tested its ability to inhibit SauCas9-mediated double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) cleavage in vitro. We began by first assembling the SauCas9-sgRNA RNP
complex, then added the individually purified Acr proteins and dsDNA target. Under these
conditions, we observed near total inhibition of SauCas9 dsDNA cleavage at 20-fold molar
excess of Acr relative to Cas9 RNP (Fig. 3A, left and Fig. S4A, top). As a negative control, we
performed the same assay using BSA and AcrVA4 and observed no difference in cleavage
activity of SauCas9 (Fig. S4B). To shed more light on the mechanism, we performed the
SauCas9 in vitro cleavage experiments again, but added the Acr proteins before the addition of
sgRNA. Adding the Acr protein before the sgRNA led to ~4-fold increase in inhibition by the
Acr proteins, on par with the only currently known broad spectrum Acr for type II-A Cas9,
AcrIIA5 (11) (Fig. 3A right and Fig. S4A, bottom).
We then performed RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to determine if
the Acrs were able to prevent, or reverse, Cas9-sgRNA RNP formation. While AcrIIA13 and

AcrIIA14 did not prevent RNP formation, the addition of AcrIIA15 before the sgRNA during
complex formation eliminated the presence of the slow-migrating species corresponding to Cas9
RNP formation that is visible when the Acr is added after RNP complex formation (Fig. 3B).
The lack of a mobility-shifted species when AcrIIA15 is added before sgRNA suggests that
AcrIIA15 binds directly to Cas9 to prevent RNP formation rather than causing RNP disassembly.
Next, we performed EMSAs to evaluate the ability of the Acrs to prevent binding of the Cas9sgRNA RNP to its target dsDNA. We found that both AcrIIA13 and AcrIIA15 inhibited dsDNA
binding of Cas9, but only when added prior to the addition of target dsDNA. Interestingly,
although AcrIIA14 completely inhibited Cas9 cleavage activity (Fig. 3A), it did not prevent Cas9
RNP from binding to its target. However, a super-shifted species was observed after the addition
of AcrIIA14 and either before or after addition of dsDNA. This suggests that AcrIIA14 may act
by binding the SauCas9 active site without impacting DNA binding, similar to the behavior of
AcrIIC1 (31). AcrIIA14 might also trigger complex dimerization to form an inactive
conformation, similar to the mechanisms of AcrIIC3 (31, 32) or AcrVA4 (33) (Fig. 3C).
Altogether, these biochemical data suggest that each of the newly discovered Acrs inhibits
SauCas9-mediated DNA cleavage by a different method.

AcrIIA13-15 share a N-terminal domain that binds an inverted repeat
To determine the level of sequence similarity between AcrIIA13-15, we performed a multiple
sequence alignment with MUSCLE and observed a shared N-terminal domain across all three
Acrs, which was absent in AcrIIA13b, a truncated homolog of AcrIIA13 found during the guiltby-association search (Fig. 3D). The remaining C-terminus, however, was not closely related
between AcrIIA13-15 (Fig. S5A). Given the apparently distinct mechanisms of inhibition for

AcrIIA13-15 respectively, we suspected that the residues downstream of the shared N-terminus
were responsible for the Acr activity. To test this, we cloned, expressed and purified truncated
versions of all three Acrs with the shared N-termini removed (Fig. S5A). In DNA cleavage
assays with the purified C-terminal AcrIIA13-15 proteins, all the Acrs showed complete
inhibition of Cas9 cleavage activity at ~5-fold molar excess whether added before or after Cas9sgRNA RNP formation (Fig. S5B). We also observe strong inhibition of the C-terminal portion
of AcrIIA13 in the TXTL sfGFP expression assay, while no inhibition was detected using the Nterminal domain alone (Fig. S5C). Overall, these data support the conclusion that the variable Cterminal domains of AcrIIA13-15 constitute the Acr activity of each protein. We also tested the
truncated AcrIIA13-15 proteins for inhibition of SpyCas9 in an RNA-guided DNA cleavage
assay, but observed no significant reduction in DNA cutting (Fig. S5D).

The shared Acr N-terminal domain binds an inverted-repeat DNA sequence
On further sequence analysis of the homologous N-terminal section of AcrIIA13-15, we found
they contain a conserved helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (Fig. 3D and Fig. S5A). These HTH
domains have been found in aca genes and were recently shown to repress their own
transcription along with other Acrs in the same operon (16, 34). These aca genes encode proteins
that bind to promoter-proximal sequences containing two inverted repeats to block polymerase
access. We observe inverted repeats (IR) proximal to the promoters driving transcription of the
operons containing AcrIIA13-15 (Fig. S5A). To determine if AcrIIA13-15 are capable of binding
to the promoter proximal IR sequences, we performed DNA EMSAs, combining each purified
Acr protein with a FAM-labelled dsDNA sequence spanning the IRs in the promoter-proximal
region of AcrIIA15 (Fig. S5B). We found that AcrIIA13 and AcrIIA15 strongly interact with the

promoter-proximal IR sequence, while AcrIIA14 only weakly interacted with it (Fig. 3E).
Mutating the IR sequence of the dsDNA substrate completely abolished the Acr-IR DNA
interaction. To further assess if this interaction was mediated by the HTH motif, we repeated the
DNA EMSA using the C-terminal AcrIIA15, where we failed to detect any interaction with the
dsDNA IR-DNA substrate (Fig. S6C). Together, these data suggest that, similar to AcrIIA1
(16), AcrIIA13-15 also are fusion proteins that link an anti-SauCas9 Acr with a DNA binding
domain that is likely to regulate the expression of its own operon.

Inhibition of SauCas9-mediated genome editing in human cells
To assess the ability of AcrIIA13-15 to inhibit genome editing in the context of human cells, we
designed a lentiviral validation system to express Cas9, an sgRNA, and an Acr protein from
three different, stably integrated constructs (Fig. 4A). Using HEK-RT1 genome editing reporter
cells (35, 36) - a monoclonal HEK293T-based cell line expressing a doxycycline-inducible GFP
reporter - lentiviral constructs encoding the AcrIIA proteins or mTagBFP2, and SauCas9 or
SpyCas9, were sequentially transduced and stable integrants selected. The resulting cell lines
were then further transduced with a vector expressing a GFP-targeting or negative control
sgRNA and an associated mCherry fluorescence marker. In this system, we observed a baseline
of ~75% GFP-positive cells after induction in presence of a negative control sgRNA, which was
reduced to near 0% by an on-target sgRNA disrupting GFP expression (Fig. S7).
We next tested three known Acrs for their ability to inhibit SauCas9-mediated genome
editing in mammalian cells, including the robust SpyCas9 inhibitor AcrIIA4 (10), the broadspectrum type II-A Cas9 inhibitor AcrIIA5 (12) and the species-specific Streptococcus
thermophilus Cas9 inhibitor AcrIIA6 (12). While AcrIIA4 prevented genome editing by

SpyCas9 as expected (10), we found that it had no effect against SauCas9 (Fig. S8). Conversely,
AcrIIA5 displayed strong inhibitory activity towards both SauCas9 and SpyCas9, while AcrIIA6
did not show any inhibition of either of the two Cas9s.
Similar genome editing inhibition experiments using AcrIIA13-15 showed that AcrIIA13
is a potent inhibitor of SauCas9, with near complete inhibition of GFP gene editing activity (Fig.
4B and Fig. S9). However, in contrast to AcrIIA5, AcrIIA13 did not inhibit SpyCas9, making it
the first Acr selective for SauCas9 to our knowledge, and further expanding the CRISPR-Cas
modulation toolkit. Interestingly, the truncated form of AcrIIA13, which is substantially smaller,
was equally effective at inhibiting SauCas9-mediated genome editing in human cells. The
AcrIIA13b homolog that lacks the N-terminal DNA-binding domain showed a comparable trend
of SauCas9 selective inhibition. Full-length AcrIIA14 also proved to be a potent inhibitor of
SauCas9, although less robust than AcrIIA13, and removing its N-terminal domain had a larger
impact on its inhibitory efficacy (Fig. 4C). SpyCas9 was not affected by AcrIIA14. Finally, only
AcrIIA15 demonstrated any activity toward SpyCas9-mediated genome editing, but its inhibition
was minimal (Fig. 4C), showing that AcrIIA13-15 are potent and selective inhibitors for
SauCas9.

Discussion
The potential role of anti-CRISPRs in regulating CRISPR-Cas gene editing in therapeutic
applications has helped spur the discovery of over 40 different families of Acrs (3). However,
creating ‘designer’ inhibitors for specific gene editors and editing scenarios is very challenging
as Acr proteins are small and lack any sequence and structural conservation to use for direct
identification of desired modalities. To overcome these problems, approaches such as screening

self-targeting genomes (7, 10, 19) or metagenomic DNA (13, 14) attempt to cast a wide net in
the genomic space to identify novel Acr activities. A more direct method is to use a ‘guilt-byassociation’ search approach, which leverages the repeated observations that Acrs tend to coexist in similar operons and that the genomic neighborhood of several Acrs contain anti-CRISPR
associated (aca) genes that are closely coupled with Acrs, and widespread in bacteria and MGEs.
In this work, we sought to identify potent inhibitors of SauCas9, a common SpyCas9
alternative. Using a combination of the methods described above, we identified three novel
families of Acrs (AcrIIA13-15) that are potent inhibitors of SauCas9. Using biochemical
approaches, we find that all three Acrs possess different mechanisms of Cas9 inhibition.
AcrIIA13 prevents SauCas9-mediated dsDNA cleavage activity by blocking DNA binding,
while AcrIIA15 binds to SauCas9 to block RNP assembly (Figs. 3B, 3C). Our data also show
that AcrIIA14 does not interfere with SauCas9 binding to either RNA or dsDNA, but inhibits
dsDNA cleavage activity at a potency comparable to AcrIIA13 and AcrIIA15. It is possible that
AcrIIA14 either causes the SauCas9-sgRNA RNP to form higher order structures like AcrVA4
(33) or AcrIIC3 (31, 32), or interacts with RNP to prevent cleavage but not binding like AcrIIC1
(31). We also observed potent and SauCas9-specific inhibition by AcrIIA13 and AcrIIA14 in
mammalian cells (Fig, 4). AcrIIA15 was able to inhibit both SpyCas9 and SauCas9 in human
cells, but to a much lesser extent. Of the three Acrs, AcrIIA13 was the most potent inhibitor of
SauCas9 in human cells.
In comparing the protein sequences between AcrIIA13-15, we observe that the N-termini
of the Acrs possessed a highly conserved HTH motif (Figs. 3D and S4A). This motif is a
prominent feature of aca genes, which were recently shown to negatively regulate the
transcription of their own operon (16, 34). The self-regulating activity of aca proteins was shown

to be mediated by a direct interaction between the HTH motif and promoter proximal sequences
containing two inverted repeats (IR). Examining the promoter regions of AcrIIA13-15, we found
that all of them also contain similar promoter-proximal IR sequences (Fig. S6A), and that all
three Acrs are able to bind to the IR sequences specifically and only when the N-terminal domain
is present (Fig. 3E and S6C). The DNA binding activity of the N-terminal region also has little to
no effect on Acr potency when removed from the protein in in vitro cleavage assays (Fig. S5BD) and no or only a minor effect in human cells depending on the Acr (Fig. 4B,C). AcrIIA13 in
particular is unaffected by the removal of its N-terminus, and represents a highly potent,
SauCas9-specific inhibitor for use in mammalian contexts for regulating Cas9 activity.
Based on our data, the AcrIIA13-15 proteins we identified are likely fusions between
three unique Acr proteins and a shared aca gene, which we name aca8. It is unclear how aca8
became fused with different Acr proteins, or what benefit a single protein would have over the
split alternative. Regardless, the new aca8 gene provides another seed to search for further
discoveries using the guilt-by-association approach. With the addition of yet more proteins, we
increase the chances of finding new activities that are particularly attractive to biotechnology and
therapeutic applications, such as catalytic Acrs that would have low delivery requirements for
potent inhibition (37, 38). We believe that the search for more Acrs with potent and novel
mechanisms of inhibition will continue to rapidly add new dimensions of control into the
CRISPR toolbox.

Targeting Spacer Searcher (STSS) (https://github.com/kew222/Self-Targeting-Spacer-Searcher)
was used the NCBI database for all assemblies returned using a search of
“Staphylococcus[organism] NOT phage NOT virus”. Each assembly was checked for instances
of self-targeting, which were reported along with details about the instance including: target site
mutations, up/downstream target sequences, Cas genes found near the array of the self-targeting
spacer, predicted CRISPR subtype based on repeats/Cas proteins, repeat sequences and
conservation, etc. Systems that were output as ambiguous type II CRISPR systems were
manually checked for: 1) repeat sequence similarity to other known loci, 2) presence of defining
Cas proteins (i.e. Csn2 for II-A), and 3) alignment of Cas9 of the system in question to a set of
type II-A, II-B, and II-C Cas9s to determine similarity. The final set of self-targeting instances
found in Staphylococcus genomes on NCBI can be found in Table S1. Strains were chosen for
further study based on similarity of the downstream target site to the SauCas9 PAM (3′NNGRR(T) ) and similarity of the self-targeting system’s Cas9 to SauCas9 by blastp.

Guilt-by-association search. GF genes 1 and 2 (AcrIIA13) were used to query the NCBI protein
database with blastp to identify homologs. Each homolog found was then manually surveyed for
neighboring genes that were not found within the genome fragment amplicons tested with the
TXTL sfGFP assay. This approach was repeated using any neighboring proteins to further locate
their neighbors. Only alignments with an E-value < 0.001 were considered. The search was
ended after 10 candidate proteins were identified.

gDNA extraction. To extract gDNA, 4 mL of a culture containing Staphylococcus haemolyticus
(strains W_75 and W_139) or Staphylococcus schleiferi (strains 5909-02 and 2713-03) cells

were grown overnight in Tryptic Soy Broth. The cultures were then pelleted and resuspended in
500 μL of PBS. Cells were then treated with lysostaphin for 1 hr at 37°C. gDNA was then
extracted using the Monarch gDNA Purification Kit from NEB following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Template preparation for TXTL. Each TXTL reaction contained three template DNA sources:
a sfGFP constitutive reporter plasmid (pUC), a plasmid expressing a sgRNA targeting GFP
(pUC) using the SauCas9 sgRNA sequence from Strutt, et al. (27), an either a plasmid expressing
SauCas9 under an arabinose promoter (p15A) or a genomic amplicon containing the Cas9 from
S. haemolyticus or S. schleiferi. Reactions may also contain an Acr or Acr candidate expressed
from a Tet-repressible promoter or a genomic fragment amplicon with the naturally occurring
sequence. The plasmid preparation for the reporter, sgRNA plasmid, and SauCas9 were as
described in Watters, et al. (19). To prepare the Cas9 genomic amplicons, PCR of purified
gDNA with Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs) was performed with primers that spanned all
of the Cas genes (Table S3). Similarly, genomic fragment amplicons were prepared with PCR
using the gDNA and primers listed in Table S3. Acr candidates that were to be tested
individually were cloned into a plasmid for use in TXTL.
To prepare the plasmids for TXTL, a 20 mL culture of E. coli containing one of the
plasmids was grown to high density, then isolated across five preparations using the Monarch
Plasmid Miniprep Kit (New England Biolabs), eluting in a total of 200 μL nuclease-free H2O.
200 μL of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were then added to each combined miniprep
and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions, eluting in a final volume of 20 μL in
nuclease-free H2O.

All anti-CRISPR candidate amplicons and subfragments were prepared using 100 μL PCRs with
Q5 or Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs), under various conditions to yield a clear
single band on an agarose gel such that the correct fragment length was greater than 95% of the
fluorescence intensity of the lane on the gel. 100 μL of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter)
were then added to each reaction and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
eluting in a final volume of 10 μL in nuclease-free H2O. The PCRs and purification of the Cas9
genomic amplicons was scaled up 5-fold. A listing of the plasmids used in the TXTL
experiments can be found in Table S5.

TXTL reactions. The reactions were carried out as described in Watters, et al. (19). Briefly,
each reaction was mixed from 9 μL of TXTL master mix, 0.125 nM of each reporter plasmid, 1
nM of Cas9 amplicon or plasmid, 2 nM of sgRNA plasmid, 1 nM of genomic fragment amplicon
or Acr candidate plasmid, 1 μM of IPTG, 0.5 μM of anhydrotetracycline, 0.1% arabinose, and 2
μM of annealed oligos containing six χ sites (39).
The reactions were run at 29 °C in a TECAN Infinite Pro F200, measuring GFP (λex: 485
nm, λem: 535 nm) fluorescence levels every three minutes for 10 hours. To plot kinetic data, the
minimum measured fluorescence intensity was subtracted from each point on the curve (to
compensate for early variations due to condensation on the sealing film), then the overall curve
was normalized by the fluorescence level measured for the non-targeting negative control after
10 hours of reporter expression.

Protein purification. DNA sequences corresponding to SauCas9 and variants of AcrIIA13-15
were cloned downstream of 10xHis tag, MBP tag and a TEV cleavage site. Each of these

constructs were grown in Rosetta2 cells overnight in Lysogeny Broth and were subcultured in
750 mL of Terrific Broth. After the cultures reached an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8, proteins were induced
by treatment with 0.5 mM IPTG for ~20 hrs at 16°C. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer
containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol and Roche
cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed by sonication, followed by purification using NiNTA Superflow resin (Qiagen). The eluted proteins were then cleaved with TEV protease
overnight at 4°C while performing buffer exchange in buffer containing 250 mM NaCl. The
cleaved proteins were further purified using Ion exchange chromatography with a linear NaCl
gradient using Heparin HiTrap column (GE) or HiTrap Q column (GE). The protein samples
were then concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography with Superdex 200 size
exclusion column (GE). The proteins were eluted in final storage buffer containing 20 mM
HEPES pH 7.0, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol. Plasmids for expressing the Acrs
are available on Addgene with ##XXX, XXX, XXX.

In vitro cleavage assays. All dsDNA cleavage assays were performed in a 1X Cleavage Buffer
containing 20 mM HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP. sgRNA
sequences synthesized by IDT were first refolded in 1X cleavage buffer by heating at 70°C for 5
min then cooling to room temperature. For all the cleavage assays involving SauCas9, reaction
components were added in the following two ways: (1) SauCas9 and Acrs were complexed
together, followed by sequential addition of sgRNA and dsDNA. (2) SauCas9 and sgRNA were
complexed together, followed by addition of Acrs and dsDNA target. Each step of sequential
additions in both reactions were preceded by incubation at 37°C for 10 min. All cleavage
reactions were then quenched on completion with 2 µL of 6X Quenching Buffer containing 30%

glycerol, 1.2% SDS, 250 mM EDTA. Cleavage products were read using a 1% agarose gel
prestained with SYBRGold. All DNA/RNA sequences used for biochemical assays can be found
in Table S6.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RNA EMSAs were performed by incubating SauCas9
and sgRNA in 1X cleavage buffer lacking MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 10-fold molar
excess of different Acrs relative to SauCas9. The reactions were then incubated at 37°C for 10
mins and run on 6% TBE polyacrylamide gels for 1 hr at 50V. The gels were then visualized
using SYBRGold stain. DNA EMSAs to evaluate binding of SauCas9 RNP to dsDNA target
were performed by incubating the reaction components described in their respective figures in
1X cleavage buffer lacking MgCl2 at 37°C for 10 min. The dsDNA substrates used for this assay
were synthesized as 5’ FAM labelled 34 bp DNA oligos that were annealed prior to their
addition to the EMSA reaction. The reactions were run on 6% TBE polyacrylamide gels and
visualized on a Typhoon imager (GE). DNA EMSAs for the binding of AcrIIA13-15 to IR DNA
were performed by incubating the components in 1X cleavage buffer lacking MgCl2 at 37°C for
10 min. The completed reactions were then run on 6% TBE polyacrylamide gels for 1 hr at 50V
and visualized with SYBRGold stain.
Lentiviral vectors. The lentiviral vector pCF525-mTagBFP2, expressing an EF1a-driven
polycistronic construct containing a hygromycin B resistance marker, P2A ribosomal skipping
element, and an mTagBFP2 fluorescence marker had been cloned before (19). For stable
lentiviral expression of AcrIIA candidates, mTagBFP2 was replaced by the gene-of-interest open
reading frame (ORF) using custom oligonucleotide gBlocks (IDT), Gibson assembly reagents
(NEB), and standard molecular cloning techniques. The SpyCas9 guide RNA-only lentiviral

vector pCF820, encoding a SpyCas9 U6-sgRNA cassette and an EF1a driven, human codon
optimized mCherry2 marker (40), was based on the pCF221 vector (35). To make the backbone
more efficient and increase viral titers, the f1 bacteriophage origin of replication and bleomycin
resistance marker were removed, as has previously been done for pCF525 (19). The SauCas9
guide RNA-only lentiviral vector pCF824, encoding an SauCas9 U6-sgRNA cassette and an
EF1a driven, human codon optimized mCherry2 marker, was based on the pCF820 vector. The
SauCas9 guide RNA scaffold was designed as previously reported (41), synthesized as custom
oligonucleotides (IDT), and assembled using Gibson techniques and standard molecular cloning
methods. A lentiviral vector referred to as pCF823, expressing an EFS driven SpyCas9-P2APuroR cassette, was based on the vector pCF204 (35) by removing the f1 bacteriophage origin of
replication and bleomycin resistance marker to increase viral titers. A lentiviral vector referred to
as pCF825, expressing an EFS driven SauCas9-P2A-PuroR cassette, was based on the vector
pCF823 by replacing the SpyCas9 ORF with the SauCas9 ORF from pX601 (Addgene #61591)
(25). Vector sequences are provided in a separate file (Table S7).
Design of sgRNAs. The following protospacer sequences were used for SpyCas9 sgRNAs: sgC
(GGAGACGGAGGACGACGAACGTCTCT), sgGFP8 (GCAGGGTCAGCTTGCCGTAGG).
The following sequences were used for SauCas9 sgRNAs: sgC
(GGAGACGGAGGACGACGAACGTCTCT), sgGFP1 (GCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTCAC).
Mammalian cell culture. All mammalian cell cultures were maintained in a 37°C incubator at
5% CO2. HEK293T (293FT; Thermo Fisher Scientific) human kidney cells and derivatives
thereof were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Corning Cellgro, #10-013CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm #1500-500), and 100 Units/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (100-Pen-Strep; Gibco #15140-122). HEK293T and

HEK-RT1 cells were tested for absence of mycoplasma contamination (UC Berkeley Cell
Culture facility) by fluorescence microscopy of methanol fixed and Hoechst 33258 (Polysciences
#09460) stained samples.
Lentiviral transduction. Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells using
polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences #23966) based transfection of plasmids, as previously
described (35). In brief, lentiviral vectors were co-transfected with the lentiviral packaging
plasmid psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and the VSV-G envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Addgene
#12259). Transfection reactions were assembled in reduced serum media (Opti-MEM; Gibco
#31985-070). For lentiviral particle production on 6-well plates, 1 µg lentiviral vector, 0.5 µg
psPAX2 and 0.25 µg pMD2.G were mixed in 0.4 ml Opti-MEM, followed by addition of 5.25
µg PEI. After 20-30 min incubation at room temperature, the transfection reactions were
dispersed over the HEK293T cells. Media was changed 12 h post-transfection, and virus
harvested at 36-48 h post-transfection. Viral supernatants were filtered using 0.45 µm
polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filters, diluted in cell culture media if appropriate, and added
to target cells. Polybrene (5 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was supplemented to enhance transduction
efficiency, if necessary.
Gene editing inhibition assays in human cells. Candidate anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins were
tested in a HEK293T-based monoclonal reporter cell line called HEK-RT1 (35, 36), which
features a doxycycline-inducible GFP reporter (42) that can be edited before doxycycline-based
induction of its expression. To test the effect of genomic integration and expression of AcrIIA
candidate proteins in mammalian cells, HEK-RT1 cells were stably transduced with the lentiviral
vector pCF525 (19) encoding the various candidate proteins or mTagBFP2, and selected on
hygromycin B as previously described (19). The resulting HEK-RT1-AcrIIA candidates and

HEK-RT1-mTagBFP2 genome protection and editing reporter cell lines were then used to
quantify genome editing inhibition by flow cytometry. For this, all reporter cell lines were stably
transduced with the lentiviral vector pCF823-SpyCas9 (expressing SpyCas9-P2A-PuroR from an
EFS promoter) or pCF825-SauCas9 (expressing SauCas9-P2A-PuroR from an EFS promoter)
and selected on puromycin (1.0 µg/ml). AcrIIA/mTagBFP2 and SpyCas9/SauCas9 expressing
HEK-RT1 reporter cell lines were then stably transduced with lentiviral vectors pCF820-SpysgGFP8/sgC (U6 promoter driven expression of SpyCas9-specific guide RNAs targeting GFP or
a non-targeting recipient control, along with an EF1a driven humanized mCherry2 marker) or
pCF824-Sau-sgGFP1/sgC (U6 promoter driven expression of SauCas9-specific guide RNAs
targeting GFP or a non-targeting recipient control, along with an EF1a driven humanized
mCherry2 marker). At day three post-transduction of the guide RNA vectors, anti-CRISPR
(AcrIIA candidates, mTagBFP2) + Cas9 (SpyCas9, SauCas9) + guide RNA (Spy-sgC/sgGFP8,
Sau-sgC/sgGFP1) expressing HEK-RT1 reporter cells were treated with doxycycline (1 µg/ml)
for GFP reporter induction. At 24 h post-induction, transgenic GFP genome editing efficiency
and inhibition thereof were quantified by flow cytometry (Attune NxT, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). For guide RNA expressing samples, quantification was gated on the mCherrypositive (lentiviral guide RNA transduced) population. Data was normalized on samples without
guide RNA expression treated +/- doxycycline (1 µg/ml).

Figure 1. Identification of self-targeting Staphylococcus strains that contain active type II
CRISPR-Cas systems. (A) Acquisition of protospacers from MGEs can result in self-targeting
if the MGE is capable of stably integrating (e.g. prophages) or associating (e.g. plasmid) with the
genome. (B) Overview of TXTL assay to test for Acr activity. Cas9 template DNA is combined
with an sfGFP reporter plasmid and a plasmid expressing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting
the reporter. In the absence of Acr activity, expression of the Cas9 RNP suppresses sfGFP
expression. In the presence of Acrs, the Cas9 RNP is inhibited, resulted in increased
fluorescence. (C) Genomic amplicons from S. schleiferi and S. haemolyticus containing Cas9
lower sfGFP expression with an sfGFP-targeting sgRNA, demonstrating that the natural CRISPR
loci are active.

Figure 2. Identification of three new Acrs using amplicon screening and guilt-byassociation. (A) The relative level of Cas9 DNA-cleavage inhibition for each fragment was
measured as percentage of the GFP expression for the non-targeting (NT) control after
subtracting the fluorescence level observed with no Acr present. Thus, 0% inhibition is
equivalent to the GFP expression level measured with the targeting sgRNA, while 100%
inhibition represents no reduction in the maximum GFP expression. GF5 is the only amplicon
that exhibits Acr activity. (B) Genes found in GF5. (C) Each gene in GF5 was individually
cloned and tested for Acr activity with TXTL and SauCas9. The 2nd gene of GF5 (AcrIIA13)
inhibits SauCas9. (D) AcrIIA13a, a homolog of AcrIIA13, is found in GF8 and is also able to
inhibit SauCas9 in a TXTL assay. GF8, which contains AcrIIA13a did not exhibit Acr activity,
however. (E) Of 10 candidates chosen from a guilt-by-association search seeded by GF5 gene 1
(aca8), candidates 1 (AcrIIA14) and 10 (AcrIIA15) were found to inhibit SauCas9 using the
TXTL assay.

cleavage activity from 3 independent replicates. Error bars represent average +- sd. (B) 6%
polyacrylamide gel showing formation of Cas9-sgRNA RNP in the presence and absence of
different Acrs. Lanes boxed in red represent reactions where Acrs were added before the addition
of sgRNA. Lanes boxed in blue represent reactions where Acrs were added after the addition of
sgRNA. Order of the addition of different reaction components are shown above the boxes. (C)
6% polyacrylamide gel showing binding of Cas9-sgRNA RNP to either target DNA (T) or nontargeting DNA (NT) in the presence and absence of different Acrs. Lanes boxed in red represent
reactions where Acrs were added to Cas9 before the addition of sgRNA and dsDNA. Lanes
boxed in blue represent reactions where Acrs were added after the addition of dsDNA to Cas9sgRNA RNP. Order of the addition of different reaction components are shown above the boxes.
(D) Schematic showing the gene structure of AcrIIA13-15. The gene section highlighted in blue
is highly conserved across the different Acrs and contains the conserved Helix-turn-helix (HTH)
motif. The C-terminal region shows high variability across the three Acrs. (E) Schematic
showing our hypothesis that the Acrs containing HTH motif binds to the promoter proximal
sequence spanning inverted repeats -IR1 and IR2. 6% polyacrylamide gel showing binding of
individually purified Acr proteins to AcrIIA15 promoter proximal sequence containing inverted
repeats. The reaction components are indicated above the gel.

were sequentially transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Acr candidates, SauCas9 or
SpyCas9, and guide RNAs targeting GFP or a negative control. Three days post-transduction of
the guide RNAs, GFP expression was induced by treatment with doxycycline for 24 hours.
Genome editing inhibition efficiency for each Acr candidate was measured as the increase in
percentage GFP-positive cells expressing on-target guide RNAs (sgGFP, mCherry-positive),
compared to controls. (B) Quantification of SauCas9 and SpyCas9 inhibition efficiency of
AcrIIA13, an N-terminal truncation of AcrIIA13, and an AcrIIA13 homolog (AcrIIA13b) in
human cells. Error bars represent the standard deviation of triplicates. sgC, sgGFP1/sgGFP8:
