Abstract

12

Chromatin interactions have important roles for enhancer-promoter interactions

13

(EPI) and regulating the transcription of genes. CTCF and cohesin proteins are located

14

at the anchors of chromatin interactions, forming their loop structures. CTCF has

15

insulator function limiting the activity of enhancers into the loops. DNA binding

16

sequences of CTCF indicate their orientation bias at chromatin interaction anchors –

17

forward-reverse (FR) orientation is frequently observed. DNA binding sequences of

18

CTCF were found in open chromatin regions at about 40% - 80% of chromatin

19

interaction anchors in Hi-C and in situ Hi-C experimental data. It has been reported that

20

long range of chromatin interactions tends to include less CTCF at their anchors. It is

21

still unclear what proteins are associated with chromatin interactions.

22

To find DNA binding motif sequences of transcription factors (TF), such as CTCF,

23

and repeat DNA sequences affecting the interaction between enhancers and promoters

24

of genes and their expression, first I predicted TF bound in enhancers and promoters

25

using DNA motif sequences of TF and experimental data of open chromatin regions in

26

monocytes and other cell types, which were obtained from public and commercial

27

databases. Second, transcriptional target genes of each TF were predicted based on

28

enhancer-promoter association (EPA). EPA was shortened at the genomic locations of

29

FR or reverse-forward (RF) orientation of DNA motif sequence of a TF, which were

30

supposed to be at chromatin interaction anchors and acted as insulator sites like CTCF.

31

The expression levels of the transcriptional target genes predicted based on the

32

EPA were compared with those predicted from only promoters. Total 287 biased

33

orientation of DNA motifs (159 FR and 153 RF orientation, the reverse complement

34

sequences of some DNA motifs were also registered in databases, so the total number

35

was smaller than the number of FR and RF) affected the expression level of putative

36

transcriptional target genes significantly in CD14+ monocytes of four people in common.

37

The same analysis was conducted in CD4+ T cells of four people. DNA motif sequences

38

of CTCF, cohesin and other transcription factors involved in chromatin interactions

39

were found to be a biased orientation. Transposon sequences, which are known to be

40

involved in insulators and enhancers, showed a biased orientation. The biased

41

orientation of DNA motif sequences tended to be co-localized in the same open

42

chromatin regions. Moreover, for ~85% of FR and RF orientations of DNA motif

43

sequences, EPI predicted from EPA that were shortened at the genomic locations of the

44

biased orientation of DNA motif sequence were overlapped with chromatin interaction

45

data (Hi-C and HiChIP) significantly more than other types of EPAs.

55

insulator function limiting the activity of enhancers into the loops (Fig. 1A). DNA

56

binding sequences of CTCF indicate their orientation bias at chromatin interaction

57

anchors – forward-reverse (FR) orientation is frequently observed (de Wit et al. 2015;

58

Guo et al. 2015). About 40% - 80% of chromatin interaction anchors of Hi-C and in situ

59

Hi-C experiments include DNA binding motif sequences of CTCF. However, it has been

60

reported that long range of chromatin interactions tends to include less CTCF at their

61

anchors (Jeong et al. 2017). Other DNA binding proteins such as ZNF143, YY1, and

62

SMARCA4 (BRG1) are found to be associated with chromatin interactions and EPI

63

(Bailey et al. 2015; Barutcu et al. 2016; Weintraub et al. 2017). CTCF, cohesin, ZNF143,

64

YY1 and SMARCA4 have other biological functions as well as chromatin interactions

65

and EPI. The DNA binding motif sequences of the transcription factors (TF) are found

66

in open chromatin regions near transcriptional start sites (TSS) as well as chromatin

67

interaction anchors.

68

DNA binding motif sequence of ZNF143 was enriched at both chromatin

69

interaction anchors. ZNF143’s correlation with the CTCF-cohesin cluster relies on its

70

weakest binding sites, found primarily at distal regulatory elements defined by the

71

‘CTCF-rich’ chromatin state. The strongest ZNF143-binding sites map to promoters

72

bound by RNA polymerase II (POL2) and other promoter-associated factors, such as the

73

TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the TBP-associated protein, together forming a

74

‘promoter’ cluster (Bailey et al. 2015).

75

DNA binding motif sequence of YY1 does not seem to be enriched at both

76

chromatin interaction anchors (Z-score < 2), whereas DNA binding motif sequence of

77

ZNF143 is significantly enriched (Z-score > 7; Bailey et al. 2015 Figure 2a). In the

78

analysis of YY1, to identify a protein factor that might contribute to EPI, (Ji et al. 2015)

79

performed chromatin immune precipitation with mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS), using

80

antibodies directed toward histones with modifications characteristic of enhancer and

81

promoter chromatin (H3K27ac and H3K4me3, respectively). Of 26 transcription factors

82

that occupy both enhancers and promoters, four are essential based on a CRISPR

83

cell-essentiality screen and two (CTCF, YY1) are expressed in >90% of tissues

84

examined (Weintraub et al. 2017). These analyses started from the analysis of histone

85

modifications of enhancer and promote marks rather than chromatin interactions. Other

86

protein factors associated with chromatin interactions may be found from other

87

researches.

88

As computational approaches, machine-learning analyses to predict chromatin

89

interactions have been proposed (Schreiber et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). However,

90

they were not intended to find DNA motif sequences of TF affecting chromatin

91

interactions, EPI, and the expression level of transcriptional target genes, which were

92

examined in this study.

93

DNA binding proteins involved in chromatin interactions are supposed to affect

94

the transcription of genes in the loops formed by chromatin interactions. In my previous

95

analysis, the expression level of human putative transcriptional target genes was

96

affected, according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter association (EPA) (Fig. 1B;

97

(Osato 2018)). EPI were predicted based on EPA shortened at the genomic locations of

98

FR orientation of CTCF binding sites, and transcriptional target genes of each TF bound

99

in enhancers and promoters were predicted based on the EPI. The EPA affected the

100

expression levels of putative transcriptional target genes the most among three types of

101

EPA, compared with the expression levels of transcriptional target genes predicted from

102

only promoters (Fig. 2). The expression levels tended to be increased in monocytes and

103

CD4+ T cells, implying that enhancers activated the transcription of genes, and

104

decreased in ES and iPS cells, implying that enhancers repressed the transcription of

105

genes. These analyses suggested that enhancers affected the transcription of genes

106

significantly, when EPI were predicted properly. Other DNA binding proteins involved

107

in chromatin interactions, as well as CTCF, may locate at chromatin interaction anchors

108

with a pair of biased orientation of DNA binding motif sequences, affecting the

109

expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in the loops formed by the

110

chromatin interactions. As experimental issues of the analyses of chromatin interactions,

111

chromatin interaction data are changed, according to experimental techniques, depth of

112

DNA sequencing, and even replication sets of the same cell type. Chromatin interaction

113

data may not be saturated enough to cover all chromatin interactions. Supposing these

114

characters of DNA binding proteins associated with chromatin interactions and avoiding

115

experimental issues of the analyses of chromatin interactions, here I searched for DNA

116

motif sequences of TF and repeat DNA sequences, affecting EPI and the expression

117

level of putative transcriptional target genes in CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells of

118

four people and other cell types without using chromatin interaction data. Then, putative

119

EPI were compared with chromatin interaction data.

Results

122

Search for biased orientation of DNA motif sequences

123

Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were predicted using open chromatin

124

regions and DNA motif sequences of transcription factors (TF) collected from various

125

databases and journal papers (see Methods). Transcriptional target genes were predicted

126

using TFBS in promoters and enhancer-promoter association (EPA) shortened at the

127

genomic locations of DNA binding motif sequence of a TF acting as insulator such as

128

CTCF and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) (Fig. 1B). To find DNA motif sequences of TF

129

acting as insulator, other than CTCF and cohesin, and repeat DNA sequences affecting

130

the expression level of genes, EPI were predicted based on EPA shortened at the

131

genomic locations of the DNA motif sequence of a TF or a repeat DNA sequence, and

132

transcriptional target genes of each TF bound in enhancers and promoters were

133

predicted based on the EPI. The expression levels of the putative transcriptional target

134

genes were compared with those predicted from promoters using Mann Whiteney U test

135

(p-value < 0.05) (Fig. 2). The number of TF showing a significant difference of

136

expression level of their putative transcriptional target genes was counted. To examine

137

whether the orientation of a DNA motif sequence, which is supposed to act as insulator

138

sites and shorten EPA, affected the number of TF showing a significant difference of

139

expression level of their putative transcriptional target genes, the number of the TF was

140

compared among forward-reverse (FR), reverse-forward (RF), and any orientation (i.e.

141

without considering orientation) of a DNA motif sequence shortening EPA, using

142

chi-square test (p-value < 0.05). To avoid missing DNA motif sequences showing a

143

relatively weak statistical significance by multiple testing collection, the above analyses

144

were conducted using monocytes of four people independently, and DNA motif

145

sequences found in monocytes of four people in common were selected. Total 287 of

146

biased (159 FR and 153 RF) orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF were

147

found in monocytes of four people in common, whereas only one any orientation of

148

DNA binding motif sequence was found in monocytes of four people in common (Fig.

149

3; Table 1; Supplemental Table S1). FR orientation of DNA motif sequences included

150

CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), ZNF143 and YY1, which are associated with

151

chromatin interactions and EPI. SMARCA4 (BRG1) is associated with topologically

152

associated domain (TAD), which is higher-order chromatin organization. The DNA

153

binding motif sequences of SMARCA4 was not registered in the databases used in this

154

study. FR orientation of DNA motif sequences included SMARCC2, a member of the

155

same SWI/SNF family of proteins as SMARCA4.

156

The same analysis was conducted using DNase-seq data of CD4+ T cells of four

157

people. Total 265 of biased (158 FR and 139 RF) orientation of DNA binding motif

158

sequences of TF were found in T cells of four people in common, whereas only four any

159

orientation (i.e. without considering orientation) of DNA binding motif sequences were

160

found in T cells of four people in common (Supplemental Fig. S1 and Supplemental

161

Table S2). Biased orientation of DNA motif sequences in T cells included CTCF,

162

cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), ZNF143, YY1, and SMARC. Biased orientation of DNA

163

motif sequences in T cells and monocytes (using H3K27ac histone modification marks,

164

which is described in the next paragraph) included JUNDM2 (JDP2), which is involved

165

in histone-chaperone activity, promoting nucleosome, and inhibition of histone

166

acetylation (Jin et al. 2006). JDP2 forms a homodimer or heterodimer with various TF

167

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_dimerization_protein). Among 287, 61 of biased

168

orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF were found in both monocytes and T

169

cells in common (Supplemental Table S5). For each orientation, 31 FR and 34 RF

170

orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF were found in both monocytes and T

171

cells in common. Without considering the difference of orientation of DNA binding

172

motif sequences, 84 of biased orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF were

173

found in both monocytes and T cells. As a reason for the increase of the number (84)

174

from 61, a TF or an isoform of the same TF may bind to a different DNA binding motif

175

sequence according to cell types and/or in the same cell type. About 50% or more of

176

alternative splicing isoforms are differently expressed among tissues, indicating that

177

most alternative splicing is subject to tissue-specific regulation (Wang et al. 2008)

178

(Chen and Manley 2009) (Das et al. 2007). The same TF has several DNA binding

179

motif sequences and in some cases one of the motif sequences is almost the same as the

180

reverse complement sequence of another motif sequence of the same TF. For example,

181

RAD21 had both FR and RF orientation of DNA motif sequences, but the number of the

182

FR orientation of DNA motif sequence was relatively small in the genome, and the RF

183

orientation of DNA motif sequence was frequently observed and co-localized with

184

CTCF. I previously found that a complex of TF would bind to a slightly different DNA

185

binding motif sequence from the combination of DNA binding motif sequences of TF

186

composing the complex in C. elegans (Tabuchi et al. 2011). From another viewpoint of

187

this study, the expression level of putative transcription target genes of some TF would

188

be different, depending on the genomic locations (enhancers or promoters) of DNA

189

binding motif sequences of the TF in monocytes and T cells of four people.

190

Moreover, using open chromatin regions overlapped with H3K27ac histone

191

modification marks known as enhancer and promoter marks, the same analyses were

192

performed in monocytes and T cells. H3K27ac histone modification marks were used in

193

the analysis of EPI, but were not used in the analysis of TF as insulator like CTCF and

194

cohesin in this study, since new biased orientation of DNA motif sequences were found

195

in this criterion. When H3K27ac histone modification marks were used in the analysis

196

of TF as insulator like CTCF and cohesin, the number of biased orientation of DNA

197

motif sequences was decreased. Total 241 of biased (141 FR and 120 RF) orientation of

198

DNA binding motif sequences of TF were found in monocytes of four people in

199

common, whereas only one any orientation of DNA binding motif sequence was found

200

(Supplemental Table S3). Though the number of biased orientation of DNA motif

201

sequences was reduced, JDP2 was found in monocytes as well as T cells. CTCF,

202

RAD21, SMC3, ZNF143, YY1, and SMARCC2 were also found. For T cells using

203

H3K27ac histone modification marks, total 195 of biased (107 FR and 110 RF)

204

orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF were found in T cells of four people

205

in common, whereas only six any orientation of DNA binding motif sequences were

206

found (Supplemental Table S4). Though the number of biased orientation of DNA motif

207

sequences was reduced, CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, YY1, and SMARCC2 were found.

208

Scores of CTCF, RAD21, and SMC3 were increased compared with the result of T cells

209

without using H3K27ac histone modification marks, and they were ranked in the top six.

210

As summary of the results with and without H3K27ac histone modification marks, total

211

386 of biased (223 FR and 214 RF) orientation of DNA motif sequences were found in

212

monocytes of four people in common. Total 348 of biased (202 FR and 198 RF)

213

orientation of DNA motif sequences were found in T cells of four people in common.

214

Total number of these results in monocytes and T cells was 590 biased (368 FR and 359

215

RF) orientation of DNA motif sequences. Biased orientation of DNA motif sequences

216

found in both monocytes and T cells were listed in Supplemental Table S5.

217

To examine whether the biased orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of

218

TF were observed in other cell types, the same analyses were conducted in other cell

219

types. However, for other cell types, experimental data of one sample were available in

220

ENCODE database, so the analyses of DNA motif sequences were performed by

221

comparing with the result in monocytes of four people. Among the biased orientation of

222

DNA binding motif sequences found in monocytes, 69, 82, 56, and 53 DNA binding

223

motif sequences were also observed in H1-hESC, iPS, Huvec and MCF-7 respectively,

224

including CTCF and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) (Table 2; Supplemental Table S6).

225

The scores of DNA binding motif sequences were the highest in monocytes, and the

226

other cell types showed lower scores. The results of the analysis of DNA motif

227

sequences in CD20+ B cells and macrophages did not include CTCF and cohesin,

because these analyses can be utilized in cells where the expression level of putative

231

insulator sites. Some experimental data of a cell did not show a significant difference

232

between promoters and the EPA (Osato 2018).

233

Instead of DNA binding motif sequences of TF, repeat DNA sequences were also

234

examined. The expression levels of transcriptional target genes of each TF predicted

235

based on EPA that were shortened at the genomic locations of a repeat DNA sequence

236

were compared with those predicted from promoters. Three RF orientation of repeat

237

DNA sequences showed a significant difference of expression level of putative

238

transcriptional target genes in monocytes of four people in common (Table 3). Among

239

them, LTR16C repeat DNA sequence was observed in iPS and H1-hESC with enough

240

statistical significance considering multiple tests (p-value < 10-7). The same as CD14+

241

monocytes, biased orientation of repeat DNA sequences were examined in CD4+ T cells.

242

Three FR and two RF orientation of repeat DNA sequences showed a significant

243

difference of expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in T cells of four

244

people in common (Supplemental Table S7). MIRb and MIR3 were also found in the

245

analysis using open chromatin regions overlapped with H3K27ac histone modification

246

marks, which are enhancer and promoter marks. MIR and other transposon sequences

247

are known to act as insulators and enhancers (Bejerano et al. 2006; Rebollo et al. 2012;

253

chromatin regions was analyzed in monocytes. The number of open chromatin regions

254

with the same pairs of DNA binding motif sequences was counted, and when the pairs

255

of DNA binding motif sequences were enriched with statistical significance (chi-square

256

test, p-value < 1.0 × 10-10), they were listed (Table 4; Supplemental Table S8). Open

257

chromatin regions overlapped with histone modification of enhancer and promoter

258

marks (H3K27ac) (total 26,095 regions) showed a larger number of enriched pairs of

259

DNA motifs than all open chromatin regions (Table 4; Supplemental Table S8).

260

H3K27ac is known to be enriched at chromatin interaction anchors (Phanstiel et al.

261

2017). As already known, CTCF was found with cohesin such as RAD21 and SMC3

262

(Table 4). Top 30 pairs of FR and RF orientations of DNA motifs co-occupied in the

263

same open chromatin regions were shown (Table 4). Total number of pairs of DNA

264

motifs was 492, consisting of 115 unique DNA motifs, when the pair of DNA motifs

265

were observed in more than 80% of the number of open chromatin regions with the

266

DNA motifs. Biased orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of TF tended to be

267

co-localized in the same open chromatin regions.

268

To examine the association of 265 biased orientation of DNA binding motif

269

sequences of TF in CD4+ T cells, co-location of the DNA binding motif sequences in

270

open chromatin regions was analyzed. Top 30 pairs of FR and RF orientations of DNA

271

motifs co-occupied in the same open chromatin regions were shown (Supplemental

Pairs of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences surrounding genes

280

CTCF and cohesin are found in chromatin interaction anchors and are considered

281

to form homodimers. TF are also known to form heterodimers with another TF. In this

282

study, if the DNA binding motif sequence of only the mate to a pair of TF was found in

283

EPA, EPA was shortened at one side, which is the genomic location of the DNA binding

284

motif sequence of the mate to the pair, and transcriptional target genes were predicted

285

using the EPA shortened at the side. In this analysis, the mate to both heterodimer and

286

homodimer of TF can be used to examine the effect on the expression level of

287

transcriptional target genes predicted based on the EPA shortened at one side. To

288

examine whether biased orientation of DNA motif sequences tend to be found as a pair

289

of the same TF or different TF in upstream and downstream of genes, the enrichment of

290

pairs of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences was investigated. The number of

291

genes with a pair of FR or RF orientation of DNA motif sequences was counted using

292

all pairs of the DNA motif sequences, and statistical tests (chi-square test) were

293

conducted. The total number of genes (transcripts) with a biased orientation of DNA

294

motif sequence in their upstream or/and downstream was about 20,000. This is almost

295

the same way of analysis as co-location of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences,

296

and the analysis here used the number of genes instead of open chromatin regions. Fig.

297

4 and Supplemental Fig. S2 showed that not only pairs of the same TF, but also pairs of

298

different TF were found in upstream and downstream of genes. The number of DNA

299

motif sequences of the same TF was assigned independently in each figure of heat map,

300

so for example, ‘CTCF_1’ in Fig. 4 may not be the same DNA motif sequence of

301

‘CTCF_1’ in another figure in Supplemental Fig. S2. DNA motif sequences of CTCF

302

and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) were enriched near the same genes, but cohesin

303

tended to be found with another TF near the same genes as well. The number of some

304

pairs of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences in genome sequences was small,

305

though they showed statistical significance (Supplemental material 2). The result of the

306

analysis seems to be different between monocytes and T cells and between using

307

H3K27ac histone modification marks and not using them (Supplemental Fig. S2). Some

308

of these TF would form homodimers or heterodimers directory or indirectly composing

309

a complex structure, contributing to make chromatin interactions (Fig. 6).

Comparison with chromatin interaction data

312

To examine whether the biased orientation of DNA motif sequences is associated

313

with chromatin interactions, enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) predicted based on

314

enhancer-promoter associations (EPA) were compared with chromatin interaction data

315

(Hi-C). Due to the resolution of Hi-C experimental data used in this study (50kb), EPI

316

were adjusted to 50kb resolution. EPI were predicted based on three types of EPA: (i)

317

EPA without being shortened by the genomic locations of a DNA motif sequence, (ii)

318

EPA shortened at the genomic locations of the DNA motif sequence of TF acting as

319

insulator sites such as CTCF and cohesin (RAD21, SMC3) without considering their

320

orientation, and (iii) EPA shortened at the genomic locations of FR or RF orientation of

321

DNA motif sequence of TF. EPA (iii) showed significantly a higher ratio of EPI

322

overlapped with chromatin interactions (Hi-C) using DNA binding motif sequences of

323

CTCF and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) than the other two types of EPAs

324

(Supplemental Fig. S3). Total 59 biased orientation (40 FR and 23 RF) of DNA motif

325

sequences including CTCF, cohesin, and YY1 showed significantly a higher ratio of EPI

326

overlapped with Hi-C chromatin interactions (a cutoff score of CHiCAGO tool > 1)

327

than the other types of EPAs in monocytes (Supplemental Table S10). When comparing

328

EPI predicted based on only (i) and (iii) with chromatin interactions, total 174 biased

329

orientation (101 FR and 84 RF) of DNA motif sequences showed significantly a higher

330

ratio of EPI predicted based on (iii) overlapped with the chromatin interactions than EPI

331

predicted based on (i) (Supplemental material 2). The difference between EPI predicted

332

based on (ii) and (iii) seemed to be difficult to distinguish using the chromatin

333

interaction data and the statistical test in some cases. However, as for the difference

334

between EPI predicted based on (i) and (iii), a larger number of biased orientation of

335

DNA motif sequences was found to be correlated with chromatin interaction data.

336

Chromatin interaction data were obtained from different samples from DNase-seq, open

337

chromatin regions, so individual differences seemed to be large from the results of this

338

analysis. Since, for some DNA motif sequences of transcription factors, the number of

339

EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions was small, if higher resolution of chromatin

interaction data (such as HiChIP, in situ DNase Hi-C, and in situ Hi-C data, or a tool to

341

improve the resolution such as HiCPlus) is available, the number of EPI overlapped

342

with chromatin interactions would be increased and the difference of the numbers

343

among three types of EPA might be larger and more significant (Rao et al. 2014;

344

Ramani et al. 2016; Mumbach et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018).

345

After the analysis of CD14+ monocytes, to utilize HiChIP chromatin interaction

346

data in CD4+ T cells, the same analysis for CD14+ monocytes was performed using

347

DNase-seq data of four donors in CD4+ T cells (Mumbach et al. 2017). EPI predicted

348

based on EPA were compared with HiChIP chromatin interaction data in CD4+ T cells.

349

The resolutions of HiChIP chromatin interaction data and EPI were adjusted to 5kb. EPI

350

were predicted based on the three types of EPA in the same way as CD14+ monocytes

351

using top 60% of all the transcript (gene) excluding transcripts not expressed in T cells.

352

The criteria of the analysis were determined to include known DNA motif sequences

353

involved in chromatin interactions such as CTCF and cohesin in the result, and the

354

result was consistent with the result using Hi-C chromatin interaction data. EPA (iii)

355

showed the highest ratio of EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions (HiChIP) using

356

DNA binding motif sequences of CTCF and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), compared

357

with the other two types of EPAs (Fig. 5). Total 121 biased orientation (73 FR and 58

358

RF) of DNA motif sequences including CTCF, cohesin, ZNF143, and SMARC showed

359

a higher ratio of EPI overlapped with HiChIP chromatin interactions (more than 1,000

360

counts for each interaction) than the other types of EPAs in T cells (Table 5). When

363

higher ratio of EPI predicted based on (iii) overlapped with the chromatin interactions

364

than EPI predicted based on (i) (Supplemental material 2). As expected, the number of

365

EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions (HiChIP) was increased, compared with

366

Hi-C chromatin interactions. Most of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences (85%)

367

were found to be correlated with chromatin interactions, when comparing EPI predicted

368

based on (i) and (iii) with HiChIP chromatin interactions.

369

Though the ratios of EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions were increased

370

by using many chromatin interaction data including lower score and count of chromatin

371

interactions (a cutoff score of CHiCAGO tool > 1 for Hi-C and more than 1,000 counts

372

for HiChIP), the ratios of EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions showed the same

373

tendency among three types of EPA (FR, any and others). The ratio of EPI overlapped

374

with Hi-C chromatin interactions was increased using H3K27ac marks in both

375

monocytes and T cells. The ratio of EPI overlapped with HiChIP chromatin interactions

376

was also increased using H3K27ac marks. The same as CD14+ monocytes, chromatin

377

interaction data were obtained from different samples from DNase-seq, open chromatin

378

regions in CD4+ T cells, so individual differences seemed to be large from the results of

379

this analysis, and (Mumbach et al. 2017) suggested that individual differences of

380

chromatin interactions were larger than those of open chromatin regions. ATAC-seq data,

381

open chromatin regions were available in CD4+ T cells in the paper, however, when

382

using ATAC-seq data, the result of the analysis of biased orientation of DNA motif

383

sequences was different from DNase-seq data, and not included a part of CTCF and

Discussion

388

To find DNA motif sequences of transcription factors (TF) and repeat DNA

389

sequences affecting the expression level of human putative transcriptional target genes,

390

the DNA motif sequences were searched from open chromatin regions of monocytes of

391

four people. Total 287 biased [159 forward-reverse (FR) and 153 reverse-forward (RF)]

392

orientation of DNA motif sequences of TF were found in monocytes of four people in

393

common, whereas only one any orientation (i.e. without considering orientation) of

394

DNA motif sequence of TF was found to affect the expression level of putative

395

transcriptional target genes, suggesting that enhancer-promoter association (EPA)

396

shortened at the genomic locations of FR or RF orientation of the DNA motif sequence

397

of a TF or a repeat DNA sequence is an important character for the prediction of

398

enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) and the transcriptional regulation of genes.

399

When DNA motif sequences were searched from monocytes of one person, a

400

larger number of biased orientation of DNA motif sequences affecting the expression

401

level of human putative transcriptional target genes were found. When the number of

402

donors, from which experimental data were obtained, was increased, the number of

403

DNA motif sequences found in all people in common decreased and in some cases,

404

known transcription factors involved in chromatin interactions such as CTCF and

405

cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) were not identified by statistical tests. This would be

406

caused by individual difference of the same cell type, low quality of experimental data,

407

and experimental errors. Moreover, though FR orientation of DNA binding motif

408

sequences of CTCF and cohesin is frequently observed at chromatin interaction anchors,

409

the percentage of FR orientation is not 100, and other orientations of the DNA binding

410

motif sequences are also observed. Though DNA binding motif sequences of CTCF and

411

cohesin are found in various open chromatin regions, DNA binding motif sequences of

412

some TF would be observed less frequently in open chromatin regions. The analyses of

413

experimental data of a number of people would avoid missing relatively weak statistical

414

significance of DNA motif sequences of TF in experimental data of each person by

415

multiple testing correction of thousands of statistical tests. A DNA motif sequence was

416

found with p-value < 0.05 in experimental data of one person and the DNA motif

417

sequence found in the same cell type of four people in common would have p-value <

418

0.054 = 0.00000625. Actually, DNA motif sequences with p-value slightly less than 0.05

419

in monocytes of one person were observed in monocytes of four people in common.

420

EPI were compared with chromatin interactions (Hi-C) in monocytes. EPAs

421

shortened at the genomic locations of DNA binding motif sequences of CTCF and

422

cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) showed a significant difference of the ratios of EPI

423

overlapped with chromatin interactions, according to three types of EPAs (see Methods).

424

Using open chromatin regions overlapped with ChIP-seq experimental data of histone

425

modification of an enhancer mark (H3K27ac), the ratio of EPI not overlapped with

426

Hi-C was reduced. (Phanstiel et al. 2017) also reported that there was an especially

427

strong enrichment for loops with H3K27 acetylation peaks at both ends (Fisher’s Exact

428

Test, p = 1.4 × 10-27). However, the total number of EPI overlapped with chromatin

429

interactions was also reduced using H3K27ac peaks, so more chromatin interaction data

430

would be needed to obtain reliable results in this analysis. As an issue of experimental

431

data, data for chromatin interactions and open chromatin regions were came from

432

different samples and donors, so individual differences would exist in the data.

433

Moreover, the resolution of chromatin interaction data used in monocytes is about 50kb,

434

thus the number of chromatin interactions was relatively small (72,284 at 50kb

435

resolution with a cutoff score of CHiCAGO tool > 1 and 16,501 with a cutoff score of

436

CHiCAGO tool > 5). EPI predicted based on EPA shortened at the genomic locations of

437

DNA binding motif sequence of TF that were found in various open chromatin regions

438

such as CTCF and cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3) tend to be overlapped with a larger

439

number of chromatin interactions than TF less frequently observed in open chromatin

440

regions. Therefore, to examine the difference of the numbers of EPI overlapped with

441

chromatin interactions, according to three types of EPAs, the number of chromatin

442

interactions should be large enough.

443

As HiChIP chromatin interaction data were available in CD4+ T cells, biased

444

orientation of DNA motif sequences of TF were examined in T cells using DNase-seq

445

data of four people. The resolutions of chromatin interactions and EPI were adjusted to

446

5kb by fragmentation of genome sequences. In monocytes, the resolution of Hi-C

447

chromatin interaction data was converted by extending anchor regions of chromatin

448

interactions to 50kb length and merging the chromatin interactions overlapped with

449

each other. Fragmentation of genome sequences may affect the classification of

450

chromatin interactions of which anchors are located near the border of a fragment, but

451

the number of chromatin interactions would not be decreased, compared with merging

452

chromatin interactions. The number of HiChIP chromatin interactions was 19,926,360

453

at 5kb resolution, 666,149 at 5kb resolution with chromatin interactions (more than

454

1,000 counts for each interaction), and 78,209 at 5kb resolution with chromatin

455

interactions (more than 6,000 counts for each interaction). As expected, the number of

456

EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions was increased, and 46 – 85% of biased

457

orientation of DNA motif sequences of TF showed a statistical significance in EPI

458

predicted based on EPA shortened at the genomic locations of the DNA motif sequence,

459

compared with the other types of EPAs or EPA not shortened. False positive predictions

460

of EPI would be decreased by using H3K27ac marks and other features. The ratio of

461

EPI overlapped with Hi-C chromatin interactions was increased using H3K27ac marks

462

in both monocytes and T cells. The ratio of EPI overlapped with HiChIP chromatin

463

interactions was also increased using H3K27ac marks. However, the number of biased

464

orientation of DNA motif sequences showing a higher ratio of EPI overlapped with

465

HiChIP chromatin interactions than the other types of EPAs was decreased using

466

H3K27ac marks (Supplemental material 2).

467

Though the number of known DNA binding proteins and TF involved in

468

chromatin interactions would be less than 30 or so, about 300 DNA binding proteins

469

showed enrichment of biased orientation of their DNA binding sequences, and known

470

DNA binding proteins involved in chromatin interactions were found in the biased

471

orientation of DNA binding sequences. JUNDM2 (JDP2) found in T cells and

monocytes is not known DNA binding proteins involved in chromatin interactions.

473

JDP2

is

involved

in

histone

and

nucleosome-related

474

histone-chaperone activity, promoting nucleosome, and inhibition of histone acetylation

475

(Jin et al. 2006). JDP2 forms a homodimer or heterodimer with various TF

476

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_dimerization_protein). Thus, the main function of

477

JDP2 may not be associated with chromatin interactions, but it forms a homodimer or

478

heterodimer with TF, potentially forming a chromatin interaction through the binding of

479

JDP2 and another TF, like chromatin interactions formed by YY1 (Weintraub et al.

480

2017). In the analysis of HiChIP chromatin interaction data, JDP2 was in the list of

481

biased orientation of DNA motif sequences showing a higher ratio of EPI overlapped

482

with HiChIP chromatin interactions than the other types of EPAs, using chromatin

483

interactions with more than 6,000 counts (Supplemental material 2). When forming a

484

homodimer or heterodimer with another TF, TF may bind to genome DNA with a

485

specific orientation of their DNA binding sequences. From the analysis of biased

486

orientation of DNA motif sequences of TF, TF forming heterodimer would also be

487

found. If the DNA binding motif sequence of only the mate to a pair of TF was found in

488

EPA, EPA was shortened at one side, which is the genomic location of the DNA binding

489

motif sequence of the mate to the pair, and transcriptional target genes were predicted

490

using the EPA shortened at the side. In this analysis, the mate to both heterodimer and

491

homodimer of TF can be used to examine the effect on the expression level of

492

transcriptional target genes predicted based on the EPA shortened at one side. For

493

heterodimer, biased orientation of DNA motif sequences may also be found in

forward-forward or reverse-reverse orientation.

495

I reported that the ratio of the number of functional enrichment of putative

496

transcriptional target genes in the total number of putative transcriptional target genes

497

changed according to the types of EPA, in the same way as gene expression level (Osato

498

2018). JDP2 showed a higher ratio of functional enrichment of putative transcriptional

499

target genes using EPA shortened at the genomic locations of FR orientation of the DNA

500

binding motif sequence, compared with the other types of EPAs (RF or any orientation)

501

in monocytes and T cells, among monocytes, T cells and CD20+ B cells. While the

502

genome-wide analysis of functional enrichment of putative transcriptional target genes

503

takes computational time, the genome-wide analysis of gene expression level is finished

504

with less computational time. The analysis of gene expression level can be used for a

505

cell type and experimental data where the expression levels of transcriptional target

506

genes predicted based on EPA are significantly different from those predicted from only

507

promoter.

508

It has been reported that CTCF and cohesin-binding sites are frequently mutated

509

in cancer (Katainen et al. 2015). Some biased orientation of DNA motif sequences

510

would be associated with chromatin interactions and might be associated with diseases

511

including cancer.

512

The analyses in this study revealed novel characters of DNA binding motif

513

sequences of TF and repeat DNA sequences, and would be useful to analyze TF

514

involved in chromatin interactions and/or forming a homodimer, heterodimer or

515

complex with other TF, affecting the transcriptional regulation of genes.

553

Transcription factor binding sequences of TF derived from vertebrates were used for

further analyses. Transcription factor binding sequences were searched from each

555

narrow peak of DNase-seq data using FIMO with p-value threshold of 10−5 (Grant et al.

transcription factor binding sequences were not linked to transcript IDs such as UCSC,

562

RefSeq, and Ensembl transcripts.

563

Target genes of a TF were assigned when its TFBS was found in DNase-seq

564

narrow peaks in promoter or extended regions for enhancer-promoter association of

565

genes (EPA). Promoter and extended regions were defined as follows: promoter regions

566

were those that were within distance of ±5 kb from transcriptional start sites (TSS).

567

Promoter and extended regions were defined as per the following association rule,

568

which is the same as that defined in Figure 3A of a previous study (McLean et al. 2010):

569

the single nearest gene association rule, which extends the regulatory domain to the

570

midpoint between the TSS of the gene and that of the nearest gene upstream and

571

downstream without the limitation of extension length. Extended regions for EPA were

572

shortened at the genomic locations of DNA binding sites of TF that were the closest to a

573

transcriptional start site, and transcriptional target genes were predicted from the

574

shortened enhancer regions using TFBS. Furthermore, promoter and extended regions

575

for EPA were shortened at the genomic locations of forward–reverse (FR) orientation of

576

DNA binding sites of TF. When forward or reverse orientation of DNA binding sites

577

were continuously located in genome sequences several times, the most external

578

forward–reverse orientation of DNA binding sites were selected. The genomic positions

579

of genes were identified using ‘knownGene.txt.gz’ file in UCSC bioinformatics sites

580

(Karolchik et al. 2014). The file ‘knownCanonical.txt.gz’ was also utilized for choosing

581

representative transcripts among various alternate forms for assigning promoter and

582

extended regions for EPA. From the list of transcription factor binding sequences and

605

606

sequence was compared with the expression level of transcriptional target genes

607

predicted from promoter. For each DNA motif sequence shortening EPA, transcriptional

608

target genes were predicted using about 3,000 – 5,000 DNA binding motif sequences of

609

TF, and the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes of each TF was

610

compared between EPA and only promoter using Mann-Whitney test (p-value < 0.05).

611

The number of TF showing a significant difference of expression level of putative

612

transcriptional target genes between EPA and promoter was compared among

613

forward-reverse (FR), reverse-forward (RF), and any orientation (i.e. without

614

considering orientation) of a DNA motif sequence shortening EPA using chi-square test

615

(p-value < 0.05). When a DNA motif sequence of a TF or a repeat DNA sequence

616

shortening EPA showed a significant difference of expression level of putative

617

transcriptional target genes among FR, RF, or any orientation in monocytes of four

618

people in common, the DNA motif sequences were listed.

619

Though forward-reverse orientation of DNA binding motif sequences of CTCF

620

and cohesin is frequently observed at chromatin interaction anchors, the percentage of

621

forward-reverse orientation is not 100, and other orientations of the DNA binding motif

622

623

chromatin interactions for Monocytes with scores of CHiCAGO tool > 1 and

651

as monocytes, Hi-C chromatin interaction data of CD4+ T cells (Naive CD4+ T cells,

653

Enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) were predicted using three types of EPAs in

654

monocytes: (i) EPA shortened at the genomic locations of FR or RF orientation of DNA

655

motif sequence of TF, (ii) EPA shortened at the genomic locations of any orientation (i.e.

656

without considering orientation) of DNA motif sequence of TF, and (iii) EPA without

657

being shortened by a DNA motif sequence. EPI predicted using the three types of EPAs

658

in common were removed. First, EPI predicted based on EPA (i) were compared with

659

chromatin interactions (Hi-C). The resolution of chromatin interaction data used in this

660

study was 50kb, so EPI were adjusted to 50kb before their comparison. The number and

661

ratio of EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions were counted. Second, EPI were

662

predicted based on EPA (ii), and EPI predicted based on EPA (i) were removed from the

663

EPI. The number and ratio of EPI overlapped with chromatin interactions were counted.

664

Third, EPI were predicted based on EPA (iii), and EPI predicted based on EPA (i) and

665

(ii) were removed from the EPI. The number and ratio of EPI overlapped with

666

chromatin interactions were counted. The number and ratio of the EPI compared two

667

times between EPA (i) and (iii), and EPA (i) and (ii) (binomial distribution, p-value <

668

0.025 for each test).
