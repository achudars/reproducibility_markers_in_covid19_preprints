Abstract:

44

Patients with liver diseases often suffer from chronic itch or pruritus, yet the

45

itch-causing pruritogen(s) and their cognate receptor(s) remain largely elusive. Using

46

transcriptomics and GPCR activation assays, we found that an orphan, primate

47

specific MRGPRX4 is expressed in human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) and selectively

48

activated by bile acids. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that

49

MRGPRX4 is expressed in ~7% of hDRG neurons and co-localizes with HRH1, a

50

known itch-inducing GPCR. Bile acids elicited a robust Ca2+ response in a subset of

51

cultured hDRG neurons, and intradermal injection of bile acids and an MRGPRX4

52

specific agonist induced significant itch in healthy human subjects. Surprisingly,

53

application of agonist for TGR5, a known sequence conserved bile acid receptor

54

previously implicated in cholestatic itch, failed to elicit Ca2+ response in cultured

55

hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human subjects. In situ hybridization and

56

immunostaining results revealed that hTGR5 is selectively expressed in satellite glial

57

cells, unlike mTGR5 (in mouse DRG neurons), likely accounting for the inter-species

58

difference functionally. Finally, we found that patients with cholestatic itch have

59

significantly higher plasma bile acid levels compared to non-itchy patients and the bile

60

acid levels significantly decreased after itch relief. This elevated bile acid level in itchy

61

patients is sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Taken together, our data strongly suggest

62

that MRGPRX4 is a novel bile acid receptor that likely underlies cholestatic itch,

63

providing a promising new drug target for anti-itch therapies.

INTRODUCTION

66

Chronic itch, or pruritus, is a severe and potentially debilitating clinical feature

67

associated with many dermatological and systemic conditions1, severely affecting

68

quality of life and potentially leading to lassitude, fatigue, and even depression and

69

suicidal tendencies2. The most well-characterized itch receptors are the H1 and H4

70

histamine receptors (HRH1 and HRH4)3. Although antihistamines, which act by

71

inhibiting histamine receptors, are generally effective at relieving itch symptoms

72

induced by inflammation and allergens, these compounds are usually ineffective at

73

treating chronic itch caused by systemic diseases and most skin disorders. To date,

74

no effective treatment is available for treating histamine-resistant itch2.

75

A high percentage of patients with systemic liver failure develop itch with

76

cholestatic symptoms4. For example, the prevalence of itch is as high as 69% among

77

patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and severe itch is an indication for liver

78

transplantation5. Moreover, itch occurs in more than half of pregnant woman with

79

intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a condition that has been associated with an

80

increased risk of preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, and fetal distress6.

81

Several medications have been tested for treating cholestatic itch, including

82

ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholestyramine, and rifampicin; however, these

83

compounds either are ineffective or induce severe side effects5. Therefore, safe and

84

effective treatments for cholestatic itch are urgently needed, and identifying the

85

underlying molecular mechanisms—particularly the receptor and ligand—is the

86

essential first step.

87

Although the link between cholestasis and itch was first described more than

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/633446; this version posted May 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

88

2000 years ago7, the detailed mechanisms underlying cholestatic itch remain

89

unidentified. To date, a handful of molecules have been proposed as the pruritogens

90

that mediate cholestatic itch, including bile acids, bilirubin, lysophosphatidic acid,

91

autotaxin, and endogenous opioids4. With respect to the cognate receptor for the

92

pruritogen, a few receptors have been proposed, albeit based primarily on rodent

93

models. For example, the membrane-bound bile acid receptor TGR5 has been

94

reported to mediate bile acid induced itch in mice8,9. However, a recent study found

95

that administering TGR5-selective agonists failed to elicit an itch response in mouse

96

models of cholestasis10, raising doubts regarding whether TGR5 is indeed the

97

principal mediator for cholestatic itch. Recently, Meixiong et al. reported that Mrgpra1

98

and MRGPRX4 (in mice and humans, respectively) can be activated by bilirubin, a

99

compound that serves as one of the pruritogens in cholestatic itch in mice11.

100

Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism that underlie cholestatic itch in

101

humans remains to be determined.

102

We specifically focused our search on genes that are selectively expressed in the

103

human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where the cell bodies of primary itch-sensing

104

neurons are located. Our search revealed a novel ligand-receptor pair comprised of

105

bile acids (the ligand) and the receptor MRGPRX4. Moreover, we found that

106

MRGPRX4 is expressed selectively in a small subset of neurons in the human DRG,

107

and bile acids directly trigger intracellular Ca2+ increase in these neurons. In addition,

108

intradermal injection of both bile acids and the MRGPRX4-specific agonist nateglinide

109

induce detectable itch in human subjects, and this bile acid-induced itch is

110

histamine-independent. Surprisingly, application of agonist for TGR5, a known

111

sequence conserved bile acid receptor previously implicated in cholestatic itch, failed

112

to elicit Ca2+ response in cultured hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human

113

subjects. In situ hybridization and immunostaining results revealed that unlike

114

mTGR5 expressing in mouse DRG neurons, hTGR5 is selectively expressed in

115

satellite glial cells, likely accounting for the inter-species difference functionally.

116

Finally, we found that plasma bile acid levels are well correlated with itch sensation in

117

cholestatic patients and that this elevated bile acid level is sufficient to activate

118

MRGPRX4. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that the

119

ligand-receptor pair of bile acids and MRGPRX4 is likely to be one of the critical

120

mediators for human cholestatic itch.

121
122

RESULTS

123

MRGPRX4 is activated by bile extract

124

DRG neurons are primary somatosensory neurons that express a variety of receptors

125

and ion channels for detecting both extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli12. To identify a

126

receptor in mediating cholestatic itch in human, we reason that this candidate

127

receptor could be expressed in human DRG neurons and activated by bile extracts.

128

Since the majority of itch receptors identified to date belong to the G protein coupled

129

receptor (GPCR) superfamily13, we analyzed two published transcriptomics datasets

130

compiled from a variety of human tissues14,15, specifically focusing on GPCRs.

131

Among the 332 transcripts that are enriched in the human DRG (Table S1), we

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/633446; this version posted May 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

132

identified the following seven highest-enriched orphan GPCRs: GPR149, MRGPRX4,

133

GPR139, GPR83, MRGPRE, MRGPRX1, and MRGPRD16,17 (Fig. 1a and Table S2).

134

Next, we cloned and expressed these candidate receptors in HEK293T cells

135

(Supplementary Fig. 1a, b), finding that all seven receptors were expressed at the

136

plasma membrane (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We measured the activation of each

137

receptor by bovine bile extract using two reporter assays, the Gs-dependent

138

luciferase assay18 and the Gq-dependent TGFα shedding assay19 (Fig. 1b,c). No

139

signal was detected with the Gs-dependent luciferase assay (Fig. 1b). Interestingly,

140

bile extract elicited a significant increase in reporter activity in cells expressing

141

MRGPRX4 measured using the TGFα shedding assay, but had no effect on cells

142

expressing the other six GPCRs (Fig. 1c). These results suggest that MRGPRX4 is

143

activated by one or more compounds present in bile extract, and that MRGPRX4

144

likely signals through the Gq but not the Gs pathway. Further experiments revealed

145

that bovine, porcine, and human bile extract activate MRGPRX4 to a similar extent in

146

a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1d); in contrast, extracts obtained from bovine brain,

147

spleen, heart, kidney, and liver tissues induced no detectable signal on

148

MRGPRX4-expressing cells (Fig. 1e). Taken together, these results suggest that

149

MRGPRX4 is potently activated by bile extract and active compound(s) is/are highly

150

enriched in bile extract.

151
152

Identifying which in bile extract activate MRGPRX4

153

Next, to identify the component(s) in bovine bile extract that activate(s) MRGPRX4,

154

we separated the extract into six fractions using silica gel column chromatography

155

(Fig. 2a). Each fraction was then applied to MRGPRX4-expressing HEK293T cells,

156

and MRGPRX4 activation was measured using the TGFα shedding assay. Among the

157

six fractions tested, fraction 4 caused the strongest activation of MRGPRX4, whereas

158

fractions 1 and 6 caused the weakest activity (Fig. 2b), indicating that the active

159

component(s) are mainly present in fraction 4. Mass spectrometry of fractions 4 and 6

160

revealed a peak enriched specifically in fraction 4 (Fig. 2c); this peak corresponded to

161

ions with an m/z value of 410.3265 in the positive ion mode and was annotated to

162

prostaglandin F2α diethyl amide and/or dihydroxy bile acids. Further experiments

163

using 1H-NMR revealed that two pure dihydroxy bile acids—deoxycholic acid (DCA)

164

and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)—produced peaks that were identical to the

165

peaks in fraction 4 (Fig. 2d); other fractions that only weakly activated MRGPRX4

166

also contained characteristic peaks of bile acids as shown by

167

(Supplementary Fig. 2). These results suggest that DCA and/or CDCA are enriched

168

in the active fraction of bile extract and may be the key compounds that activate

169

MRGPRX4.

Characterization of bile acids: MRGPRX4 activation and the downstream

173

To further characterize the efficacy and potency of DCA, CDCA, other bile acids, and

174

their derivatives in activating MRGPRX4, we systematically measured their ability to

175

activate MRGPRX4 in HEK293T cells, using TGFα shedding assay and FLIPR

176

(fluorescent imaging plate reader) Ca2+ assay. All of the bile acids tested activated

177

MRGPRX4 to some extent; DCA had the highest potency measured with both assays,

178

with an EC50 value of 2.7 μM and 2.6 μM in the TGFα shedding and FLIPR assays,

179

respectively; cholic acid (CA), CDCA, and lithocholic acid (LCA)—three close analogs

180

of DCA—were less potent (Fig. 3a-c). Based on the structural differences between

181

DCA and the less potent bile acids, we reasoned that hydroxylation at position of R1

182

and/or R2, as well as taurine/glycine conjugation at position R3, is important for

183

specific bile acids to activate MRGPRX4 (Fig. 3c).

184

Next, we examined the potential signaling events downstream of bile

185

acid-induced MRGPRX4 activation by measuring intracellular Ca2+ concentration

186

([Ca2+]i) in MRGPRX4-expressing HEK293T cells loaded with Fluo-8 AM, a

187

fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. We found that DCA, CA, CDCA, and LCA induced a robust

188

fluorescence response in these cells (Fig. 3d-f), and pretreating the cells with the

189

phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 significantly reduced the DCA-evoked Ca2+ signals;

190

in contrast, the Gβγ inhibitor gallein had no effect on DCA-evoked signaling (Fig.

191

3g-h). Taken together, these results indicate that a Gq-dependent signaling pathway

192

involving phospholipase C is downstream to MRGPRX4 activation by bile acids.

193

Interestingly, even though MRGPRX1, MRGPRX2, and MRGPRX3 are close

194

analogs of MRGPRX4, none of these receptors was activated by bile acids, even at

195

100

196

putative ligand-binding sites in MRGPRX4 by comparing the primary amino acid

197

sequence of MRGPRX4 with these three analogs (Fig. 3i). We identified amino acid

μM

concentration (Supplementary Fig. 3a-e). We therefore investigated the

198

residues that are conserved in MRGPRX1, MRGPRX2, and MRGPRX3 but not in

199

MRGPRX4 and mutated these residues, once per time, to an alanine residue in

200

MRGPRX4. We found that mutating amino acids 159, 180, and 235 reduced the

201

receptor’s affinity for DCA (Fig. 3j), without affecting trafficking to the cell membrane

202

(Fig. 3k); thus, these three sites may play a critical role in the binding of bile acids to

203

MRGPRX4. In addition, we examined whether mouse and/or rat Mrgpr family

204

members also respond to bile acids. Intriguingly, bile acids failed to activate any

205

mouse or rat Mrgpr members tested (Supplementary Fig. 3g-h), suggesting that the

206

ability of MRGPRX4 to sense bile acids may be a new functional addition during

207

evolution.

208
209

A subset of human itch-related DRG neurons express MRGPRX4 and respond

210

to bile acids

211

Next, we examined endogenous expression pattern of MRGPRX4 in hDRGs. We

212

performed in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe against

213

MRGPRX4 mRNA, and found that MRGPRX4 mRNA is expressed in only ~6-8% of

214

hDRG neurons (Fig. 4a, c); similar results were obtained with immunofluorescence

215

using an MRGPRX4-specific antibody (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 4).

216

Morphologically, these MRGPRX4-expressing neurons are small-diameter neurons,

217

with a diameter of approximately 50 μm, which is similar to small-diameter neurons

218

that express the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA) (Fig. 4d),

219

suggesting a function in nociception and/or pruriception20.

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

220

To further characterize the molecular profile of these MRGPRX4-positive hDRG

221

neurons, we performed triple-labeling of MRGPRX4 and two additional molecular

222

markers using RNAscope in situ hybridization (Fig. 4e). Our analysis revealed

223

that >90% of MRGPRX4-positive neurons also express the histamine receptor HRH1,

224

a well-characterized itch receptor in humans21, and TRPV1 (transient receptor

225

potential cation channel subfamily V member 1) (Fig. 4f-g), which functions

226

downstream of Mrgprs and histamine receptors22,23. Interestingly, the majority of

227

MRGPRX4-expressing neurons also co-express Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium

228

channel, the peptidergic marker CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), and

229

TrkA24,25 (Fig. 4f-g). These results suggest that MRGPRX4 is specifically expressed

230

in a subset of small diameter peptidergic hDRG neurons.

231

Next, we tested whether MRGPRX4 in DRG neurons can be activated by bile

232

acids. Because bile acids failed to induce a detectable Ca2+ signal in cultured rat

233

DRG neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5), we expressed the human MRGPRX4 in

234

cultured rat DRG neurons. Bile acids triggered a robust Ca2+ response in

235

MRGPRX4-expressing rat DRG neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that

236

MRGPRX4 expressed in rat DRG neurons mediates the bile acid induced activation.

237

Consistent with our finding that DCA is a more potent agonist of MRGPRX4 than CA,

238

DCA induced a significantly larger Ca2+ response and activated a larger number of

239

MRGPRX4-expressing rat DRG neurons than CA (Supplementary Fig. 5).

240

Next, we asked whether hDRG neurons can also be activated by bile acids.

241

Application of DCA induced a robust fluorescence increase in a subset (~6%) of these

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/633446; this version posted May 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

242

hDRG neurons loaded with Fluo-8 AM; this percentage of DCA-responsive cells is

243

similar to the percentage of MRGPRX4-expressing cells measured with in situ

244

hybridization (Fig. 4a, c). Moreover, the less potent MRGPRX4 agonist CA also

245

induced a response, albeit much weaker than DCA (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig.

246

6). In addition, nearly all (~90%) of DCA-responsive hDRG neurons were

247

capsaicin-sensitive, and approximately one-third of DCA-responsive neurons also

248

responded to histamine (Fig. 4j). Together, our results indicate that expression of

249

MRGPRX4 is sufficient to render bile acid sensitivity of primary somatosensory

250

neurons.

251
252

Pharmacological activation of MRGPRX4 triggers itch sensation in human

253

subjects

254

Given the specific expression pattern of MRGPRX4 in a subset of hDRG neurons,

255

and the known role of Mrgpr family members in mediating itch sensation, we next

256

asked whether pharmacologically activating MRGPRX4 could trigger itch sensation in

257

human subjects. We recruited healthy volunteers and performed a double-blind skin

258

itch test, in which each subject received a 25-μl intradermal injection of the test

259

compounds or vehicle in four separate sites on both forearms (Fig. 5a1, inset), after

260

which the subject was asked to rank the itch sensation at each injection site using a

261

generalized labeled magnitude scale (LMS)26. Interestingly, the pharmacological

262

MRGPRX4 specific agonist nateglinide, a previously reported MRGPRX4 agonist27,

263

(Supplementary Fig. 3f) —but not vehicle—induced a robust itch sensation in

264

healthy subjects (Fig. 5a1, a2). These results show that activation of MRGPRX4 is

265

sufficient to trigger itch sensation in humans, suggesting that MRGPRX4 is a human

266

itch receptor.

267
268

Bile acid induced itch in humans is both histamine- and TGR5-independent

269

Previous studies have implicated that bile acids could induce itch in human28,29. Here,

270

we systematically test pruritic effect of bile acids on human and whether bile aicd-

271

induced itch shows some features similar to that of cholestatic itch17. We found that

272

500 μg (25 μl) of DCA induced a significant itch sensation that peaked within 5 min

273

and declined slowly over time; in contrast, control injections with vehicle did not

274

induce an itch response (Fig. 5a1, a2). Moreover, itch intensity induced by DCA was

275

in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5b1, b2). We also found that less potent

276

MRGPRX4 agonists, including CA, CDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA),

277

and LCA, also induced a weaker—albeit still significant—itch sensation (Fig. 5c1, c2).

278

Given that antihistamines are largely ineffective for treating cholestatic itch4, we

279

tested whether itch induced by bile acids can be blocked by antihistamines. We found

280

that pretreating subjects with an antihistamine prevented histamine-induced itch but

281

had no effect on DCA-induced itch (Fig. 5d1, d2), suggesting that itch induced by bile

282

acids does not involve histamine signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that

283

bile acids trigger an itch sensation with features similar to cholestatic itch.

284

In mice, the membrane bile acid receptor TGR5 has been reported to mediate

286

mediated by TGR5, we chose a non-bile acid TGR5 agonist compound 1530, which is

287

nearly 70-fold more potent than DCA in activating human TGR5 and does not activate

288

human MRGPRX4 (Fig. 6b, c). Intradermal injections of 10 μg (25μl) of compound 15

289

did not induce detectable itch in humans, whereas DCA, as the positive control,

290

induced significant itch (Fig. 6a1, a2, d). These results suggest that TRG5 is not the

291

receptor mediating bile acid-induced itch. Furthermore, we examined the expression

292

of TGR5 in the human, monkey, and mouse DRG tissues. Very surprisingly, although

293

the amino acid sequence of TGR5 is relatively conserved between rodents and

294

primates (Supplementary Fig. 7a), we found the different expression pattern of

295

TGR5 in DRG tissues. In human and monkey, both in situ hybridization and

296

immunostaining revealed that TGR5 is highly expressed in satellite glial cells

297

surrounding DRG neurons but not the primary sensory neurons (Fig. 6e-i and

298

Supplementary Fig. 7), while in mouse, the same in situ probe and antibody

299

detected the expression of TGR5 in mouse DRG neurons (Fig. 6f, h and

300

Supplementary Fig. 7c), similar to the previous publication8,9. These results

301

revealed an interesting species difference in TGR5 expression and function between

302

mouse and primate. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the function of

303

TGR5 in human somatosensory system is different from that in mouse, and TGR5 is

304

not the receptor for mediating bile acid-induced itch in human.

305
306

The elevated levels of bile acids in cholestatic itchy patients are sufficient to

307

activate MRGPRX4

308

Lastly, to investigate whether bile acids are the pruritogens under pathological

309

conditions, we collected plasma samples from patients with liver or skin diseases and

310

measured the concentration of 12 major bile acids using HPLC-MS/MS (Fig. 7a and

311

Supplementary Fig. 8a). We found that glycine- and taurine-conjugated primary bile

312

acids,

313

glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and TCDCA are the major bile acids present

314

in cholestatic patients (Fig. 7a), consistent with previously published results31-33.

315

Compared to itchy patients with liver diseases, non-itchy patients had significantly

316

higher levels of total bile acids (defined here as the sum of the 12 bile acids shown in

317

Fig. 7a) (Fig. 7a, b). The level of total plasma bile acids in the itchy patients with skin

318

diseases was barely detectable and significantly lower than the itchy patients with

319

liver diseases. Among the 12 bile acids measured, the ones with the largest

320

differences between the patients with itch and those without itch were for GCA,

321

GCDCA, TCA, and TCDCA (Fig. 7a, b), suggesting that these four bile acids play key

322

roles in mediating chronic itch under pathological conditions. Indeed, intradermal

323

injections of TCDCA caused significant itch in healthy subjects (Fig. 5c1, c2). For

324

DCA, the most potent ligand for MRGPRX4 among all tested bile acids, we did not

325

see the significant difference between itchy and non-itchy patients with liver diseases

326

(Fig. 7a), suggesting it is not the major contributor for cholestatic itch under

327

pathological conditions. More importantly, although bile acid levels vary among itchy

328

patients with liver diseases both from our data (Fig. 7a, b) and previously reported

329

results32-34, we found that the total plasma bile acids, as well as the individual levels of

including

glycocholic

acid

(GCA),

taurocholic

acid

(TCA),

330

GCDCA, TCDCA, TCA, and GCA, significantly decreased in 11 out of 13 patients

331

following itch relief (Fig. 7c, d and Supplementary Fig. 8c). Taken together, these

332

results suggest that high levels of bile acids are well correlated with itchy symptom in

333

patients with liver diseases and that bile acids—particularly GCDCA, TCDCA, TCA,

334

and GCA— could be main metabolites triggering cholestatic itch.

335

Next, we examined whether combinations of bile acids at pathologically relevant

336

levels are sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. We prepared mixtures of bile acids similar

337

to the plasma/serum levels in healthy subjects (“healthy mix”) or in patients with liver

338

diseases and itch (“liver itch mix”), which are estimated based on previously

339

published data31,35 and our quantification results (Fig. 7a). These mixtures were then

340

applied to MRGPRX4-expressing HEK293T cells while performing Ca2+ imaging. We

341

found that the “liver itch mix” but not “healthy mix” induced a significant Ca2+ signal

342

(Fig. 7e, f), suggesting that pathological relevant level of bile acids is sufficient to

343

activate MRGPRX4.

344

Recently, Meixiong et al. reported that MRGPRX4 can also be activated by

345

bilirubin, which is another potential pruritogen for triggering cholestatic itch11. We

346

therefore compared bilirubin and DCA with respect to binding and activating

347

MRGPRX4. We found that compared to bile acids, bilirubin is a less potent, partial

348

agonist of MRGPRX4 (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Given the structural differences

349

between bilirubin and DCA, we then tested whether bilirubin is an allosteric modulator

350

of MRGPRX4. Indeed, we found that bilirubin can potentiate the activation of

351

MRGPRX4 by DCA (Supplementary Fig. 9b), and—conversely—DCA potentiate the

352

activation of MRGPRX4 by bilirubin (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Moreover, we found

353

that both total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin levels were significantly higher in itchy

354

patients with liver diseases compared to non-itchy patients (Supplementary Fig. 9d)

355

and plasma bilirubin levels decreased significantly after itch relief (Supplementary

356

Fig. 9e). Compare to total bilirubin, total bile acids show better correlation with itch

357

intensity (measured using a self-report numerical rating scale36) (Supplementary Fig.

358

9f). Taken together, these results suggest that bile acids are the major pruritogens in

359

MRGPRX4-mediated cholestatic itch and bilirubin facilitates the activation of

360

MRGPRX4 by bile acids and may also contribute to cholestatic itch in pathological

361

conditions.

362
363

DISCUSSION

364

Here, we report that MRGPRX4 is a novel GPCR that fits with the criteria we set for

365

identifying putative receptor in mediating cholestatic itch. MRGPRX4 is selectively

366

expressed in a small subset of human DRG neurons. Bile acids triggered a robust

367

Ca2+ response in a subset of hDRG neurons as well as rat DRG neurons expressing

368

MRGPRX4 exogenously. Both bile acids and an MRGPRX4-specific agonist induce

369

itch in human. Bile acid-induced itch in human is histamine independent, which is

370

consistent with antihistamines are largely ineffective for treating cholestatic itch.

371

Surprisingly, application of agonist for TGR5 failed to elicit Ca2+ response in cultured

372

hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human subjects. The expression pattern

373

of TGR5 is different between mouse and human. hTGR5 is selectively expressed in

374

satellite glial cells, while mTGR5 is expressed in DRG neurons, likely accounting for

375

the inter-species difference functionally. We also found that plasma levels of bile

376

acids were well correlated with itchy patients with liver diseases. Importantly, a

377

mixture of bile acids with components and concentrations similar to that of cholestatic

378

itchy patients—but not healthy volunteers—was sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Our

379

data indicate bile acids are the major pruritogens in MRGPRX4-mediated cholestatic

380

itch and bilirubin facilitates the activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acids and may also

381

contribute to cholestatic itch in pathological conditions. Based on our results, we

382

propose a new working model for cholestatic itch (Fig. 7g): patients with cholestasis

383

usually display increased plasma levels of bile acids and bilirubin, which are

384

precipitated in the skin and activate MRGPRX4 receptors in itch-related primary fibers,

385

thereby triggering itch in these patients. Our results exclude TGR5 as a primary itch

386

receptor in human, and the broad expression of TGR5 in satellite glial cells implies a

387

more general function which remains to be determined in the future.

388

Here, we provide important evidence that MRGPRX4 is sufficient for mediating

389

bile acid induced itch, and thus should play an important role in cholestatic itch.

390

Since specific antagonist for MRGPRX4 is currently unavailable, we could not

391

determine whether MRGPRX4 is necessary for bile acids induced itch in human.

392

Future studies will be designed to further examine the role of MRGPRX4 in

393

cholestatic itch using to-be-developed pharmacological and/or human genetic

394

approaches. For example, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have

395

been identified in the human MRGPRX4 gene37, and it would be interesting to screen

396

for loss-of-function and gain-of-function MRGPRX4 variants. Characterizing the

397

relationship between these variants and itch intensity in cholestatic patients and

398

healthy subjects with bile acid induced itch could help to further delineate the

399

relationship between MRGPRX4 activity and cholestatic itch. These experiments will

400

also help to determine whether MRGPRX4 is the main molecular receptor for

401

mediating cholestatic itch, or whether other GPCRs4, such as lysophosphatidic acid

402

receptors and serotonin receptors also play roles in cholestatic itch.

403

Our current understandings about mechanisms underlying somatosensation in

404

the mammalian system are mainly derived from studies of rodents. Despite the great

405

value and insights we gained using rodent models, notable failures have happened in

406

translating results obtained in rodents into effective and safe clinical treatments in

407

human38-41. The bile acid receptors we study here is a great example demonstrating

408

the species differences between rodent and human somatosensory systems.

409

Although TGR5, a bile acid membrane receptor, was previously reported to be

410

expressed in mouse DRG neurons and mediate bile acid induced itch in mice8,9, our

411

expressing characterizations as well as functional assays revealed that TGR5 is not

412

expressed in human DRG neurons and doesn’t directly mediate itch sensation in

413

human. Instead, primate MRGPRX4 gains the novel function of bile acid sensitivity

414

during evolution. Therefore, it is crucial to study and validate the mechanism of

415

cholestatic chronic itch and develop the correspondent treatment within the context of

416

human physiology.

417

Recently, Meixiong et al. reported that mouse Mrgpra1 and human MRGPRX4

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/633446; this version posted May 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

418

can be activated by bilirubin, suggesting that bilirubin may serve as a pruritogen in

419

cholestatic itch11. Bilirubin, a yellow compound that causes the yellow discoloration in

420

jaundice, has not been considered a likely candidate pruritogen though, because the

421

clinical observation that itch often precedes the appearance of jaundice, particularly in

422

patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)42 and patients with primary

423

biliary cirrhosis7. Our results suggest that bilirubin is a partial agonist of MRGPRX4

424

and may potentiate the activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acids. This notion is

425

consistent with our finding that the correlation between bile acid levels and itch

426

intensity is stronger than the correlation between bilirubin levels and itch intensity.

427

Based on these findings, we propose that bile acid is the major contributor to

428

cholestatic itch, and bilirubin serves to increase bile acid induced cholestatic itch

429

under pathological conditions.

430

In summary, we found that the membrane-bound GPCR MRGPRX4 is a novel bile

431

acid receptor and may serve as an important molecular mediator of chronic itch in

432

patients with systemic liver diseases. Our results suggest that MRGPRX4 is a

433

promising molecular target for developing new treatments to alleviate devastating

434

chronic itch in these patients.

neurons. These activated neurons relay the itch signal to the spinal cord and higher

623

brain centers, eliciting the sensation of itch.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

860

Analysis of GPCRs expressed in human DRG neurons

861

The expression profile of all genes in hDRG neurons was compared to human

862

reference tissues, including trigeminal ganglia, brain, colon, liver, lung, muscle, and

863

testis14,15. To identify DRG-enriched GPCRs, we using the following formula: [(the

864

expression level of a given gene in the DRG)/(the total expression level of that gene

865

in all tissues)]; a value ≥0.5 was used to define DRG-enriched genes. The expression

866

level of a gene refers to the number of fragments per kilobase of exon per million

867

fragments mapped (FPKM) in the tissue transcriptome.

868
869

Bovine tissue extracts

870

Fresh bovine heart, brain, kidney, spleen, and liver tissues (40 g each) were

871

dissected and then boiled for 5 min in 200 ml water. Acetic acid and HCl were then

872

added to a final concentration of 1 M and 20 mM, respectively, and the mixture was

873

homogenized thoroughly and then centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 min. The

874

supernatant was collected and concentrated to a volume of 40 ml using a rotary

875

evaporator. Acetone (80 ml) was then added to the concentrated solution, and the

876

new solution was again centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatant

877

was collected using a rotary evaporator and freeze-dried in a vacuum. The final

878

product was weighed, and equal amounts of each extract were used to test for

879

activity.

881

Generation of stable GPCR-expressing cell lines

882

Stable cell lines expressing orphan GPCRs were generated using the PiggyBac

883

Transposon System. In brief, each orphan GPCR was subcloned into the PiggyBac

884

Transposon vector and co-transfected with the hyperactive PiggyBac transposase43

885

into the HEK293T-based TGFα shedding reporter cell line19 using polyethylenimine

886

(PEI). Receptor-expressing cells were selected and maintained in DMEM containing

887

10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μg/ml puromycin, 100 U penicillin, and 100 μg/ml

888

streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C containing 5% CO2.

889
890

TGFα shedding assay

891

Cultured cells expressing orphan GPCRs were rinsed once with Mg2+-free and

892

Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then detached with 0.05% (w/v)

893

trypsin. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15-ml tube and centrifuged at 190xg

894

for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was suspended in 10 ml

895

PBS and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT). The cells were

896

re-centrifuged and suspended in 4 ml HBSS (Hanks’ balanced salt solution)

897

containing 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). The suspended cells were then seeded in a

898

96-well plate at 40,000-50,000 cells per well and placed in a 37ºC incubator in 5%

899

CO2 for 30 min. A 10x stock solution of each drug was prepared in assay buffer

900

(HBSS containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and 10 μl of 10x stock solution was added

901

to each well. The plate was then placed in the incubator for 2 hr, after which alkaline

902

phosphatase (AP) activity was measured in the conditioned media and cells.

FLIPR assay

905

HEK293T cells stably expressing human MRGPRX4 were seeded in 96-well plates at

906

a density of ~50,000 cells per well. The following day, the cells were loaded with

907

Fluo-8 (Screen Quest Fluo-8 No-Wash Calcium Assay Kit, AAT Bioquest, Cat. No.

908

36316) for 2 hr, and test compounds were added to the wells. The Fluo-8 signal was

909

measured using the FLIPR TETRA system (PerkinElmer).

910
911

Luciferase assay

912

We generated a luciferase reporter plasmid that encodes secreted NanoLuc under

913

the control of a cAMP response element (CRE) and a minimal promoter. The

914

hygromycin-resistance gene and EBFP driven by the SV40 promoter in the reporter

915

plasmid were used to generate stable cell lines. HEK293T cells were transfected with

916

this plasmid, and a stable cell line was generated by selecting with hygromycin.

917

This stable reporter cell line was then transfected with various GPCRs and used

918

to monitor the activation of these receptors. In brief, the cells were seeded in 96-well

919

plates; the next day, the culture medium was replaced, and compounds were added

920

to the wells; forskolin (10 μM final concentration) and 0.01% DMSO (v/v) were used

921

as positive and negative controls, respectively. The plates were incubated at 37°C in

922

5% CO2 for 24 hr, after which a 10-μl aliquot of cell culture medium was removed from

923

each well and combined with 40 μl culture medium plus 50 μl assay buffer (containing

924

20

μM

of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine); after 5 min incubation,

In the first study (to measure bile acid induced itch sensation), each tested

1048

compound was dissolved in physiological saline containing 7% Tween-80

1049

(Sigma-Aldrich). The injection sites were cleaned with rubbing alcohol, and 25 μl of

1050

each solution was injected intradermally on the volar surface of each arm. The same

1051

volume of vehicle (saline containing 7% Tween-80) served as the negative control.

1052

Itch was defined as the desire to initiate scratching during the experiment, and the

1053

subjects rate the perceived intensity according the generalized labeled magnitude

1054

scale (LMS) described by Green et al.26

1055

In the second study (to measure the effect of antihistamines on DCA-induced

1056

itch), two experimental sessions were performed, separated by 2 weeks, with 14 and

1057

12 subjects participating in the first and second sessions, respectively. Approximately

1058

1.5 g of topical antihistamine cream (doxepin hydrochloride cream, Chongqing

1059

Huapont Pharm. Co., China) or a placebo cream (cold cream, Eau Thermale Avène,

1060

Paris, France) was applied 2.5 hr before injection of DCA or histamine

1061

(Sigma-Aldrich); any unabsorbed cream was removed with alcohol. A 500 μg/25 μl

1062

solution of DCA was prepared as described above, and a 2.5 μg/25 μl solution of

1063

histamine was dissolved in saline; 25 μl of the DCA or histamine solution was injected

1064

into the volar surface of the arm as described above. In the first session, each subject

1065

received two intradermal injections of DCA (one at the antihistamine-treated site and

1066

one at the placebo-treated site). In the second session, each subject received two

1067

intradermal injections of histamine (one at the antihistamine-treated site and one at

1068

the placebo-treated site). The subjects then rate the itch sensation as described

1069

above.

Quantification of plasma bile acids and bilirubin

1072

These experiments were approved by the Committee for Biomedical Ethics, Peking

1073

University First Hospital (2017-R-94). Itch intensity was measured using a self-report

1074

numerical rating scale (NRS)36, and whole blood samples were collected from

1075

patients with skin diseases and patients with liver diseases. Plasma was obtained by

1076

centrifuging 2 ml of whole blood at 4°C, 11,000 g for 10 min; 100 μl of each plasma

1077

sample was then mixed with 400 μl acetonitrile and left to sit at 4°C for 20 min. The

1078

mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried in a rotatory evaporator

1079

(45°C under vacuum), and the dried residue was retrieved and dissolved in 60%

1080

methanol for further analysis.

1081

The bile acid level in plasma samples was measured using HPLC-MS/MS

1082

(Agilent model LC1260 QQQ 6495). Chromatographic separation was performed in

1083

an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm; Waters Corp.). The

1084

mobile phase consisted of solution A (water) and solution B (acetonitrile). The total

1085

running time was 23 min, and a linear gradient (0.3 ml/min) was applied as follows:

1086

0-2 min: 10% B - 40% B; 2-18 min: 40% B - 50% B; 18-19 min: 50-100% B; 19-20 min:

1087

100% B; 20-21 min: 100-10% B; 21-23 min: 10% B. The injection volume was 5 μl,

1088

and the mobile phase flow rate was 3 ml/min. Deoxycholic-2,2,4,4,11,11-d6 acid

1089

(Sigma, cat. no. 809675) was used as an internal standard.

1090
1091

Total bilirubin and direct bilirubin values were obtained from the patients’ hospital
blood chemistry reports.

1093

Statistical analysis

1094

Summary data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Human subjects were randomly

1095

assigned to control and experimental groups, and the subjects and investigators were

1096

double-blinded with respect to the experiment treatments. Data were analyzed using

1097

the Student’s t-test, two-proportion z-test, Chi-square test or One-way ANOVA and

1098

differences with a P-value of < 0.05 were considered significant.
