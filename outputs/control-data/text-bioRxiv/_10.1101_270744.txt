ABSTRACT
We know little about human olfactory ability in natural settings—including natural and built
environments. Our knowledge derives from clinics and lab experiments using samples of
convenience, often students and usually ‘WEIRD’ populations. Yet, humans live in odor rich
environments, most are not western, and many are not industrialized or formally educated. There
are currently no methods available for studying olfactory ability outside the lab. Such methods
would expand representativeness in datasets and enable a true characterization of human
olfactory ability. To explore what clinical methods might be transferrable from the lab to the
field, we completed two repeated measures experiments—one in the field and one in the lab—
using the five-item odor identification test. We report two major findings. First, there are no
sufficient methods for mobile field-testing of olfactory ability. Our test of five-item odor
identification test was not sufficient in the field due to subjective biases in data analysis and
potential for participant odor learning. Second, environment may not a significant factor in
olfactory ability when testing occurs in dynamic odorscapes, but food-rich odors may enhance
olfactory ability in females. In fact, even in our less than perfect field setting and problematic test
tool, females still outperformed males. We discuss the evolutionary and ecological implications
of superior female olfactory ability that may have been under selective pressure from foraging
activity in our lineage long before the split with our closest relatives, chimps and bonobos.

INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of our knowledge on human olfaction derives from lab studies conducted in
odor-controlled environments using samples of convenience, typically white educated
industrialized rich and democratic or WEIRD populations (Henrich et al. 2010)— often students
(Hanel and Vione 2016). Meanwhile, the vast majority of human olfactory experience is in
dynamic non-western and non-industrialized odorscapes. The limited research done on olfactory
ability in different ecological settings suggests that non-industrial populations may have superior
olfactory sensitivity but not discrimination abilities (Sorokowska et al. 2014; Sorokowska et al.
2013). While these studies provide an intriguing peak at what natural human variation in
olfactory ability might be like, comparing data collected in the field to those in the lab challenges
interpretation given the unknown variables in the field influencing test outcomes. Thus, we know
little about how humans detect, discriminate, and identify odors in mixtures in natural settings—
for humans, natural settings include the built environment, both urban and rural.
Lab data provide insights into smelling odor mixtures. First, while we may detect many to most
odors in a complex odor mixture, the whole of that information is not transduced to the brain due
to the inhibition of some olfactory receptor cells via receptor competition (Jinks and Laing
1999). Even if all odors in the mix are subliminally processed in the cerebrum, only some are
perceived (Hummel et al. 2013). Second, there may be an upper limited to the number of odors
detectable individually from mixes—one experiment suggested that more than 30 equal-intensity
odorants are perceived as an ‘olfactory white’ (Weiss et al. 2012). Third, the ability to detect
single odors in mixtures may be improved by experience (Sinding et al. 2015) and training
(Barkat et al. 2012; Morquecho-Campos et al. 2019). Fourth, there may be ecological pressures
that have acted on the filtering mechanisms of the olfactory system. There is a neuronal pattern
that suggests we are particularly tuned to food odors (Saraiva et al. 2019). Thus, the olfactory
system is limited by its ability to integrate complex whole mixtures into perception and driven by
attention to specific compounds. Perhaps environmental variation outside the lab is not a
disruptive confounding factor. By widening data collection to field-based settings, a
representative sample would be possible and allow us to understand the extent of natural human
variation in olfactory ability.
The principle challenge in generating ecologically salient data is the lack of field-based methods
(Kern et al. 2014). The only field-validated method is the Olfactory Function Field Exam
(OFEE), an 11-minute olfactory function test that uses a modified and abbreviated version of
Sniffin’ Sticks—two odors for threshold detection (Kern et al. 2014) and five odors for
identification (Mueller and Renner 2006). As part of The National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project in the United States, the OFFE was validated on a cohort of 2,304 older adults and
conducted in participants’ homes following a short odor training session. Results were nearly
identical to testing conducted in labs on a similarly aged cohort but not using repeated measures
on the same subjects (Kern et al. 2014). OFFE validation results suggest that between-subjects
environmental variation was not significant. Olfactory adaptation down-regulates receptor
stimulation when odors are constant, however, which means that OFFE subjects were not
smelling their home environments and the effect from variation would be small (Auffarth 2013;
Dalton 2000).

Our goal was to assess the impact on olfactory ability from a dynamic environment to which
subjects were not adapted. We needed a tool that was highly portable and easy to administer in
the field. The ease of administering the two most accurate tests, threshold and discrimination, in
the field without a table was prohibitive. That left odor identification. There are three validated
short tests of olfactory ability that rely solely on odor identification—a five odor Sniffin’ Sticks
test (Mueller and Renner 2006), a three odor Sniffin’ Sticks test (Hummel et al. 2010), and a
three-odor test using microencapsulation (Jackman and Doty 2005). We used the five-item test in
two repeated measures studies: a field study comparing olfactory ability in a low odor
environment to 1) a polluted environment and 2) a high odor environment; a lab study comparing
olfactory ability in a low odor control lab to a high odor experiment condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Our five-item test included four of the original five-item test odors: peppermint, orange, rose,
fish (Mueller and Renner 2006). Leather was replaced by garlic because it had a lower
identification rate in the UK (Neumann et al. 2012). The field study was conducted in August
2018 and the lab study in February 2019. Materials were purchased in July 2018 and stored at the
University of Roehampton at a temperature within the recommended manufacturer’s range.
Screening and Testing Protocols
Testers wore cotton gloves during testing and wore no scented products. Each odor was moved
across the nostrils slowly for three seconds. Participants were asked to describe the odor via free
response then choose one of 22 terms from a verbal prompt card: five odor terms (one correct per
odor), 15 distractor odor terms (none correct for any odor), ‘undefinable’, and ‘no odor’ (see
Table 2 of Mueller and Renner 2006). The field study consisted of three tests per participant and
the lab study consisted of two. Between-test gaps were small (25-30 minutes for field, 15-20 for
lab).
Data Coding and Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed and graphics plotted in R for Windows v3.6.1 (Charif and Lobry 2007)
using the R Studio GUI v1.2.1335 (RStudio Team 2015). Responses were coded as correct, near
miss (a related item like lime for orange), far miss (a more general term like citrus for orange),
and incorrect (an unrelated item like raspberry for orange) following Cain (1979). Betweencoder agreement (JCB, KCH) was tested by Cohen’s kappa (κ) using irr (Gamer et al. 2012) in
the lpsolve package (Berkelaar 2015). The total correct provided an ordinal level variable
describing olfactory ability (Mueller and Renner 2006):
• Poor (0): severely impaired or no sense of smell
• Indeterminate (1 to 3): further testing required
• Normal (4-5 correct): normal or slightly reduced sense of smell
The effect on olfactory ability from differing environments was estimated using ordinal
regression (AKA logistic regression and cumulative link models), specifically, we used the clmm
function in the ordinal package (Christensen 2019). Logistic regression offers a powerful
alternative to traditional ordinal tests (Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed rank sums, Kruskal
Wallis) because it allows the estimation of fixed effects on the dependent variable and estimation
of repeated measures via a random term (McCullagh 1980)—an ordinal version of mixed-model

linear regression or repeated measures ANOVA. We used the proportional odds model which
assesses the probability of being in x ranked category or lower versus being in any higher ranked
category with olfactory rank as the thresholds between categories. We included additional fixed
effects—sex because females perform better in lab studies (Oliveira-Pinto et al. 2014;
Sorokowski et al. 2019) and age because olfactory ability declines after age 50 in lab studies
(Martinez et al. 2017; Sinding et al. 2014).The field study had two additional effects, day and
time of testing, due to potential temporal variation in test environments. The proportional odds
effects plots were generated in the R package effects (Fox and Hong 2009) using output from the
polr function in MASS (Venables and Ripley 2002).
Ethical Considerations
Field research for this project was approved by the University of Roehampton Ethics Committee,
approval number LSC 17/ 213 (JCB, KCH). Written informed consent included asked volunteers
to provide no further information beyond a name (signed and printed). Data collection sheets
were labelled with a unique numeric ID. The unique numeric ID was not noted on the informed
consent which means no personally identifying information was linked to test data. The data
collection sheet included basic demographic information (sex, age, ethnicity) and free and verbal
prompt responses to each of five odors per location.
RESULTS
Coding
The initial coding of descriptive data by two observers (JCB, KCH) was in moderate agreement:
Repeat Markets, (free response κ= 0.537, verbal prompt κ= 0.500) and Repeat Labs (free
response κ= 0.418, verbal prompt κ= 0.676). After discussion of discrepancies, we agreed to
code only veridical terms as correct (even if given with other terms), unrelated food types and
qualitative responses as incorrect rather than far miss, onion as near miss for garlic, and /mint as
correct for peppermint. After recording, coders were in perfect agreement (κ=1).
Field study
For the field study (n=29), we used social media (e.g., Twitter, meetup.com), blogs
(smellofevolution.com), word of mouth, and direct solicitation for participants. Testing was
conducted on two separate days with two groups per day (10am and 2pm). We used the area by
the Tate Turbine Hall as a low odor control (low pollution, no food vendors, leafy area) for
comparison to Southwark Bridge pedestrian area (traffic pollution, urine, cigarettes, and some
food odors) and Borough Market (raw and cooked food vendors). We expected pollution to
lower scores at Southwark and the odor signal to odor noise ratio at Borough to lower scores.
The logistic regression indicates no significant effect from location (Table 1). A visualization
change in the proportional odds (e.g., probability of being poor versus normal if you are
indeterminate) show the opposite trend to what was expected. The odds of being ‘poor’ and
‘indeterminate’ decrease from Tate to the other locations (1=Tate, 2=Southwark, 3=Borough)
while the odds of being ‘normal’ increase (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Odds of change in olfactory ability in the field
The only significant fixed effect is within-subjects. The difference between a model with and
without the within-subjects term is significant (Likelihood Ratio statistic=16.6, df=1, pvalue=0.000045). Most individuals vary from the sample average predicted response (set to 0)
taking into account the estimated impact from fixed effects (Figure 2). While the significant
random term in the regression indicates that individual variation impacts the model, it does not
indicate if individuals vary in their scores across locations. Since there are no confounding
factors from fixed effects, we used a paired ranks test to determine if there were significant
changes in olfactory ability by individual (Table 2). There were no significant changes by
individual for olfactory ability but there are two findings worth noting. First, the environmental
impact on male olfactory ability is variable with some improving and some declining. So, while
the summary statistics suggest no change, within-subjects change is taking place. Second, the
environmental impact on female olfactory ability is consistent—all females improve at Borough
(a dynamic food odor environment).

Lab Study
For Repeat Labs (n=30), we recruited University of Roehampton students and staff to participate
in a lab-based experiment. Testing was conducted in two labs at the same time each day over
three days. Olfactory ability in a control lab (well-ventilated low-odor) were compared to those
taken in an experimental condition (food market odors). Odors (garlic, coffee, madras curry
paste, and caramel furanone [3% concentration]) were diffused each day one hour prior to
testing. We expected olfactory ability to be negatively impacted by the experimental condition
but this was not the case (Table 1). The odds of dropping in olfactory ability rank (Figure 3)
under experimental conditions is consistent across but slight and not significant.

Again, the only significant model term is within-subjects. The difference between a model with
and without the within-subjects term is significant (Likelihood Ratio statistic=3.74, df=1, pvalue=0.053. All individuals differ from the average predicted response to varying degrees. The
paired ranks test did not return a significant result but the direction of change is variable across
the sexes—while females tend to improve more than decline, the positive directionality of the the
field study is not replicated.

Figure 4: Random effect on olfactory ability (conditional modes with 95% confidence
intervals based on individual variance), lab study
Despite the lack of significant differences among locations, the overall trend is that the control
lab provided the best environment for olfactory ability (Figure 4). In addition, females
consistently outperformed males with median and modal scores of 3 (normal) compared to male
median and modal scores of 2 (indeterminate). Females captured a proportionately larger share
of the normosmic diagnosis: 38% of results across trials were female and normosmic but only
14% were male and normosmic. While the field settings have a much lower probability of
normosmia, females have a higher probability of normosmia and a very low probability of
anosmia, compared to males.

DISCUSSION
Our first research goal was to identify a utilitarian data collection method for olfactory ability in
diverse non-lab environments. There is no tool for mobile rapid collection of olfactory ability.
We had hoped that the five-item odor identification test might provide a rough measure but there
are methodological problems with the tool that might affect outcomes. First, we found that
participants were learning—they relied on verbal prompt terms after the first test, even when
incorrect (choosing raspberry for orange consistently) and ignored the card in subsequent tests
(‘same as before but stronger’, ‘same as last time’). Learning will take place so perhaps longer
between-test gaps would mitigate the effect but would require greater participant commitment to
the process. Second, there is subjectivity introduced by observer coding of odor terms. Prior data
on social consensus for odor terms and usage frequency of those terms would help mitigate
marking correct choices as incorrect—such as knowing that a population associates the eugenol
with the dentist, rose or lemon with cleaning supplies, or peppermint and orange with chewing
gum. Another option is to code based on how consistent an individual is in odor term labels
(Rabin and Cain 1984) but being consistent is not the same as correctly identifying an odor.
Our second research goal was to conduct preliminary data collection on how humans smell in the
dynamic odorscapes of everyday living. Published data on olfactory ability differences in the lab
compared to the field indicated a large effect size (Sorokowska et al. 2015; Sorokowska et al.
2014; Sorokowska et al. 2013), which suggested our sample size in a repeated measures design
was sufficient. We believe that the environmental effect size is smaller than estimated when
comparing the same populations in a repeated measures approach. Despite the statistically null
result, the data visualization reveals that olfactory ability was best in the lab and that comparing
lab-based data to field-based data is problematic.
While collecting data in the field (i.e., non-lab settings) may seem superfluous to those
accustomed to lab environments, the clinically-derived dataset is insufficient to capture variation
in and the breadth and context of human olfaction. Field-based data collection methods are
needed to widen participation beyond current olfactory ability datasets that are comprised of
non-representative samples. Why non-representative? First, WEIRD samples are biased by
individuals who can afford the costs of travel and time to be tested in a lab. Second, WEIRD
populations (or even simply EIRD) are a global minority. Third, many populations are
geographically isolated from lab-testing sites—this describes the majority of indigenous,
traditionally living, small-scale societies. Fourth, lab conditions cannot be recreated in the field.
Clinical data serve their purposes but field data are needed to address an entirely different
question: are meaningful biological differences in olfactory ability explained by ecological
context?
The overabundance of human olfactory sensory neurons dedicated to food-related odors
indicates these odors have particular evolutionary and ecological salience (Saraiva et al. 2019).
Data from hunter-gatherers suggest that foraging activity may have placed females under a
separate selection regime than males and olfactory ability may have been part of that package.
While most animal-based food derives from both male and female labor, the majority of the
plant-based food derives from female labor (Marlowe 2007; Waguespack 2005) and constitutes
roughly one third of total energy intake in most hunter-gatherer populations (Ströhle and Hahn

2011). A stronger ability to remember and distinguish among food odors would be useful in
plant-based foraging but not useful in hunting which requires visual and tracking skills. Women
outperform men at foraging tasks that involve spatial memory and navigation skills (McBurney
et al. 1997; New et al. 2007). An ability to map food resources and navigate a catchment area
would be useful in food foraging but not important when following prey. Females also more
frequently use tools for food foraging and processing, a trait shared with our closest relatives,
chimps and bonobos (Gruber et al. 2010; Pruetz et al. 2015), which suggests the selective
pressure acting on females predates the Homo-Pan split. There is ample evidence in biological
structures that females share a pattern unique to their sex—females have roughly double the
number of olfactory bulb cells, both glial cells and neurons (Oliveira-Pinto et al. 2014). There is
ample evidence in cognitive processing that females have a stronger olfactory modality than
men. Even when accounting for different cultural settings in industrialized societies (Doty et al.
1985), women outperform men in smell testing (Dalton et al. 2002; Doty et al. 1985; Doty and
Cameron 2009; Doty et al. 1984b; Oliveira-Pinto et al. 2014). Women are more interested than
men in smell (Seo et al. 2010), are better than men at learning odors (Doty et al. 1984a; Ferdenzi
et al. 2013; Larsson 1997; Larsson et al. 2003; Lehrner 1993), and more proficient than men at
odor identification tasks (Oberg et al. 2002). Turning again to our closest relatives, female
chimpanzees forage alone but in spaces that overlap with other females, which generates some
competition to space and food resources. High-ranking females tend to have preferential access
to resource-rich sites which correlates with greater reproductive success (Pusey and SchroepferWalker 2013). So, reproduction is, in part, determined by foraging ability. We would argue that
females are more likely to have a better signal-to-noise ability when detecting food odors, an
innate skill well-suited to successful foraging and group provision—such as seen in our data
when female olfactory ability was enhanced in the rich food-odor environment of Borough
Market.
In conclusion and despite published data indicating a significant environmental effect on
olfactory ability (Sorokowska et al. 2014; Sorokowska et al. 2013), we failed to detect any
significant differences in two repeated measures studies. We suspect that either withinpopulation repeated measures tests have a more subtle impact from environment on olfactory
ability than cross-cultural comparisons or that the comparison of field- to lab-collected data
overemphasized differences. We also found that odor identification is a less than ideal tool for
assessing olfactory ability despite ease of delivery and speedy test time. We argue that fieldbased methods are needed to characterize representative variation in human olfactory ability and
the importance of ecological context. Lastly, we find that even in the field and despite
methodological problems, females still exhibit better olfactory ability and that may be an artifact
of long-standing evolutionary pressure acting on a mosaic of traits related to food foraging in
females only.
