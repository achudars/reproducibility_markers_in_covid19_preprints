Abstract:

16

The Hopkin’s host-selection principle (HHSP) suggests that organisms at higher trophic levels

17

demonstrate a preference for the host species on which they developed during larval stage.

18

Although investigated in many herbivorous and predatory insects, the HHSP has, to our

19

knowledge, never been tested in the context of insects hosting selfish endosymbiotic passengers

20

such as the maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. Here, we investigate the effect

21

of Wolbachia infection on host pre-imaginal learning in the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma

22

brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). We compare host-choice in Wolbachia-infected

23

and uninfected adult female parasitoids after rearing them on two different Lepidopteran hosts,

24

namely the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) or the grain moth

25

Sitotroga cerealella (Lep.: Gelechiidae). We show that in T. brassicae, Wolbachia affect the pre-

26

imaginal learning ability of female wasps. Wolbachia infected wasps do not show any host

27

preference and easily switch hosts in the laboratory, while uninfected wasps significantly prefer

28

to lay eggs on the host species they developed on. We discuss how the facilitation of a generalist

29

strategy by Wolbachia may allow T. brassicae to escape intraspecific competition with their

30

uninfected counterparts, and may have important evolutionary consequences for the host and its

31

symbionts.

Introduction:

36

Learning from experience is a property embedded into the survival strategies of most animals,

37

including insects [1-3]. For example, learning from olfactory cues enables many insects to

38

optimize foraging, mating, and the completion of other behaviors in their complex local

39

environments [4-6]. Parasitoid wasps especially rely on such innate mechanisms to directly

40

identify, detect and parasitize their hosts [7, 8], or indirectly detect the host plants or any other

41

characteristics of the environment in which the parasitoid has previously encountered its host [9].

42

Consequently, olfactory learning in parasitoids may contribute to behavioral optimization

43

through increasing the speed and the efficiency of detecting suitable hosts, which should also

44

positively affect the fitness of the parasitoid [10-12]. In the Ichneumonoid parasitoid wasps,

45

Hyposoter horticola and Venturia canescens, females use olfactory cues from conspecific

46

deterrent markings, to avoid costly interference and competition for resources (hosts) between

47

individuals [13, 14]. Similarly, it has been shown that Trichogramma brassicae wasps reared

48

from larvae feeding on tomato, later parasitized significantly more hosts on tomato plants than

49

on lettuce [15].

50

The learning process of olfactory cues in insects was previously suggested to either occur during

51

adult emergence, or at the young adult stage [9, 16-19]. Learning at adult emergence relies on

52

traces of chemical cues from hosts, inside or outside the host body, which influence adult

53

behavior potentially during a ‘sensitive period’ associated with adult emergence [20- 24] This

54

phenomenon, learning at emergence, has been proposed to occur in two different ways. First, as

55

a result of larval experiences, that implies that the larva can learn from its environment and that

56

this memory can be transferred from pre-imaginal stages to the adult—the so-called Hopkins’

57

host selection principle [25]; second, at eclosion of the imago, in which the larval environment is

58

carried over to the adult stages and olfactory learning occurs during the contact of the young

59

wasp with olfactory cues at emergence—the so-called “chemical legacy” hypothesis [19, 26].

60

Two ectoparasitoid wasps, Hyssopus pallidus and Aphidius ervi, of the codling moth, Cydia

61

pomonella, rely on chemical cues learned during their respective pre-imaginal stages to find

62

hosts [17, 19]. Early experience of olfactory stimuli associated with their host is an important

63

driver of parasitoid foraging choices, notably leading to host selection [27].

64

Successful host detection and choice may depend on a parasitoid’s ability to learn different cues

65

during its contact period with its host [2, 28, 29], and is most likely to affect the fitness of the

66

offspring that will develop within the chosen host. Host specificity in parasitoid wasps varies

67

from highly specific, with many species only parasitizing one unique host species, to generalist,

68

with species using a wide range of hosts [30-32]. Furthermore, studies have shown that in certain

69

conditions, specialist parasitoids may successfully lay eggs in new host species [33, 34] , which

70

may lead to evolutionary changes in host specificity. Such change in host-specificity may occur

71

through two different strategies. A ‘host switch’ is a sudden or accidental colonization of a new

72

host species by a few individuals capable to establish a new and viable population in the new

73

host, while a ‘host-shift’ is a gradual change of the relative role of a particular host species as

74

primary versus secondary host. Host preference is also by no means static, but is characterized

75

by behavioral plasticity that allows parasitoids to switch hosts when their preferred host is

76

unavailable and by learning host cues associated with positive or negative experiences[35- 37].

77

Wolbachia is a single bacterial lineage in the alpha-group of the Proteobacteria. The bacterium

78

benefits from strategies, such as thelytoky that increases the number of Wolbachia-transmitting

79

females in the host population [38-42]. Similarly, Wolbachia can also successfully spread in their

4

80

host populations by positively affecting various of their host’s life history traits, including

81

fecundity, and survival to pathogens or environmental stresses [43-48].

82

The parasitoid wasp T. brassicae (Westwood) (Hym.: Trichogrammatidae) is an egg parasitoid

83

widely used as a biological control agent of various Lepidoptera pest species [49-53]. As it is

84

often the case in Trichogramma wasps, T. brassicae can reproduce by arrhenotokous

85

parthenogenesis, with unfertilized eggs producing viable haploid male offspring [54-56].

86

However, in certain lineages of T. brassicae, only females can emerge from unfertilized eggs [54,

87

56, 57]. In these particular cases, studies have shown that the wasps are naturally infected by the

88

endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, which modifies the reproductive system of the wasps, such

89

that Wolbachia-infected individuals reproduce through the tlythokous parthenogenesis instead

90

[43, 57]. As the embryo grows up in host eggs, their pre-imaginal learning abilities are likely to

91

be affected by direct cues from their hosts, but less by chemical cues linked to host food or

92

environmental chemical cues. We hypothesized that the manipulated pre-imaginal learning and

93

host-preference in T. brassicae by Wolbachia may support host shift and adaptation to new

94

intracellular environments in parasitoid wasps.

Material and methods:

97

Parasitoids

98

We compared two lineages of Trichogramma brassicae: one Wolbachia infected (Wolbachia

99

wBaT.bra registered as FJ441291 in Genbank), and one uninfected. Previous studies have shown

100

that the Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free lineages carry the same genetic background [44].

101

This characteristic allowed us to avoid the use of antibiotics against Wolbachia, and their

102

potential confounding effects on the physiology and behavior of antibiotic treated insects [58-60].

103

Both lineages came from colonies maintained by the Ecology and Behavior Laboratory of the

104

University of Tehran, Iran, and were originally collected in 2016 from a Cornfield in north of

105

Iran (Baboulsar Region, South of Caspian Sea, Iran). Both original lineages have been reared on

106

Ostrinia nubilalis (Lep.: Crambidae) in the laboratory for two generations before experimental

107

design. Parasitoids were reared on egg cards (2×5 cm), loaded with one-day old eggs of O.

108

nubilalis. The egg cards were placed into emergence canisters and held in incubators at 25±1ºC,

109

16L: 8 D and 50±5% RH. Emergence canisters were closed cardboard cylinders (500 ml, 63×161

110

mm) with a glass vial (50 ml, 26×93 mm).

111

For all experiments described below, we used two different Lepidoptera species as host to the

112

parasitoids: the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and the grain

113

moth Sitotroga cerealella (Lep.: Gelechiidae). Lepidoptera eggs were obtained from a culture

114

maintained at the Insectary and Quarantine Facility, University of Tehran. The cultures were

115

reared at 25±1ºC on wheat flour and yeast (5%). Newly emerged and mated female moths were

116

kept in glass containers (500 ml) to provide eggs. Eggs were collected daily to ensure that the

117

eggs used in the experiments were no more than 24 h old. The parasitoids were reared at 25±1ºC,

118

50±5% RH, and 16:8 L: D on eggs of either Lepidoptera hosts for more than ten generations.

119

Wolbachia screening

120

We determined Wolbachia presence in female wasps, which produced only female offspring [43],

121

by PCR screening for the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene using the Wolbachia specific

122

primers 81F/691R [43,61]. The Wolbachia infected line was monitored for the infection

123

throughout the study by PCR. Also uninfected strain was screened randomly to check on any

124

contamination or horizontal transfer between the lines throughout the experiment.

125

126

All treatments were carried out in an insectary room under controlled conditions with a

127

temperature of 25±1ºC and 55±5% RH. Individual Trichogramma females were presented with

128

patches of host eggs fixed with water onto small pieces of white cardboard. The experiments

129

ended once the female wasps left the patches of eggs that were offered to them. All parasitized

130

eggs were incubated at 25 ± 1 °C, L16:D8, and 50 +/-5% R.H. for 4–5 days until the eggs

131

blackened, suggesting that the parasitoid had pupated within its host. Parasitized host eggs were

132

then cut out of the cardboard patch and placed individually in gelatin capsules to await the

133

emergence of the parasitoid progeny. We then measured the total number of parasitoids that

134

emerged. Parasitism rate was calculated as the ratio of blacked eggs compared to the total

135

number of provided host eggs for each wasp.

136

Immediately after wasp emergence, mated female wasps were removed from their gelatin

137

capsules and maintained for an hour in new tubes individually. During this period, the wasps

138

were never in contact with hosts, and were kept in a separate growth chamber than their future

139

hosts. The emerging parasitoids sex was determined by morphological differentiation of the

140

antennae [52]. We calculated the sex ratio of the emerging progeny for each female wasp.

141

A) Innate host preference

142

We first tested the innate preference of newly collected female wasps, infected or not by

143

Wolbachia, toward both experimental hosts (E. kuehniella and S. cerealella), after emerging

144

from the European corn borer, O. nubilalis. Thirty newly emerged wasps infected by Wolbachia,

145

and 30 newly emerged uninfected wasps were exposed to eggs from each experimental host in a

146

choice and non-choice test.

147

In the choice experiment: wasps were exposed to 50 one-day old eggs of E. kuehniella and 50 on

148

day old eggs of S. cerealella (Ntotal=100 eggs), simultaneously. Eggs of each host species were

149

attached to small cards (1× 5 cm) separately and were placed in a glass tubes (2×10cm).

150

In the non-choice experiment: newly collected wasps were exposed to patch containing 100 one-

151

day old eggs of each experimental host separately. Each egg card contained 100 eggs fixed on

152

labeled, white cardboard cards (2.5× 5 cm) of either host later exposed to a wasp in a glass tubes

153

(2×10cm). For each test, a naive (no previous oviposition experience) one-day old female wasp

154

was released on each egg patch.

155

B) Host preference after early imaginal experience

156

To study host preference after early imaginal experience, wasps were reared on either of the two

157

experimental hosts for 10 consecutive generations prior to the experiment. We studied the effect

158

of Wolbachia presence and experimental host species during immature developmental time on

159

pre-imaginal learning ability using a full factorial design: each of the two parasitoid lineages

160

were offered to parasitize each of the two Lepidoptera host species, with 30 replicates for each

161

treatment. The four treatments scheme includes Treatment T1: uninfected wasps reared on E.

162

kuehniella, T2: uninfected wasps reared on S. cerealella, T3: Wolbachia-infected wasps reared

163

on E. kuehniella, and T4: Wolbachia-infected wasps reared on S. cerealella (Figure 1).

164

Data analysis

165

All statistical analyzes were done by SAS software [62]. To compare egg-laying preference of

166

the female wasps, we implemented a Generalized Linear model in the procedure GENMOD of

167

the SAS software (ver. 9.1), with the binomial family error and logit link. After this global test,

168

the least square estimates of the proportions in each level were compared by the Chi-square

169

approximation (an option offered by GENMOD).

170

The rate of emergence was calculated based on the total number of emerged wasps and the total

171

number of oviposited eggs, and was analyzed for each experiment using generalized linear

172

models based on a binomial logit distribution [63]. The numbers of female and male offspring

173

produced by uninfected wasps were compared by Student’s t-test.

174

In all cases, the explanatory variables were the host species and the Wolbachia infection, and

175

when a significant effect of the treatment was found, the tests were followed by Bonferroni’s

176

posthoc multiple comparison tests. The two-by-two comparisons were evaluated at the

177

Bonferroni-corrected significance level of P = 0.05/k, where k is the number of comparisons.

178

Data are presented as means ±SE (through the results and Table 1).

Host preference experiments

182

A) Innate host preference

183

Effects of Wolbachia infection status, host species, and their interaction on the preference of the

184

female parasitoid wasps are shown in Table 1. As showed in Figure 1, both lineages displayed no

185

significant preference for either experimental host E. kuehniella or S. cerealella, and showed the

186

same response toward the two hosts in both the choice and the no choice tests.

187

B) Host preference after early imaginal experience

188

In the choice experiment: A significant interaction between wasp Wolbachia infection status, and

189

host species was observed on the wasps’ host preference (Table 1). The uninfected wasps reared

190

on E. keueneilla significantly preferred the hosts that were reared on, E. keuene, (χ2=9.77,

191

P=0.0018, N=100), while Wolbachia-infected wasps did not show any preference for either host

192

(χ2=0.26, P=0.611, N=100) (Figure 3). Similarly, when given the choice, uninfected wasps reared

193

on S. cerealella showed a significant preference toward the host they were reared on (χ2=14.55,

194

P=0.0001, N=100) (Figure 3), while Wolbachia infected wasps reared on S. cerealella showed

195

no preference toward either hosts (χ2=0.11, P=0.74, N=100).

196

In the no-choice experiment: Uninfected wasps reared on E. keueneilla laid more eggs on E.

197

keueneilla (χ2=6.79, P=0.009, N=100). However, no significant difference was observed in

198

number of eggs laid in both hosts by infected wasps (χ2=0.2, P=0.653, N=100) (Fig 3).

199

Uninfected wasps reared on S. cerealella, again significantly oviposited more on the host they

200

were on (χ2=11.09, P=0.0009, N=100), while Wolbachia infected wasps reared on S. cerealella

201

oviposited similarly on both hosts in no choice tests (χ2=0.57, P=0.45, N=100) (Figure 3).

202

Emergence rate

203

The parasitoid infection status (χ2=8.44, P=0.003), the host species (χ2=4.86, P=0.0275), and

204

their interaction (χ2=42.41, P<0.0001) had a significant effect on the emergence rate of the

205

parasitoid. Uninfected wasps reared on S. cerealella showed significant lower emergence rate

206

when they were reared for one generation on E. kuehniella (Figure 4). Similarly, emergence rate

207

of uninfected wasps reared on E. kuehniella was significantly lower when wasps were reared on

208

S. cerealella for one generation (Figure 4). All other treatments showed similar emergence rates.

209

Sex ratio

210

Reared uninfected wasps on E. kuehniella laid more female eggs in E. kuehniella eggs (t = 7.668,

211

df = 1, P<0.0001) compared to uninfected wasps exposed to S. cerealella; their observed

212

offspring sex ratio was 1:3 (male: female). Also uninfected wasps reared on S. cerealella

213

produced more female offspring in patches containing S. cerealella eggs (t = 2.677, df = 1, P =

214

0.015) compared to uninfected wasps exposed to E.kuehniella, with a ratio of 1:3. All produced

215

offspring by infected wasps in both hosts were females. Due to Wolbachia-induced thelytoky, all

216

offspring from Wolbachia-infected wasps were females.

217
218

Discussion:

219

According to our results, Wolbachia-infected specimens of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma

220

brassicae do not follow the Hopkin’s host-preference principle, while their uninfected

221

counterparts do. Wolbachia manipulates the host preference of the parasitoid wasp, such that

222

female wasps do no discriminate between eggs from E. kuehniella and S. cerealella. In contrast,

223

uninfected wasps of the same species show a significant preference towards parasitizing the

224

Lepidopteran host species from which they emerged. We also show that when choice is not given,

225

Wolbachia-infected wasps lay the same amount of eggs in both Lepidopteran hosts offered, with

226

similar emergence rates from both hosts, contrasting with uninfected wasps, which significantly

227

lay more eggs and consequently show higher emergence rates in the host species they emerged

228

from. The family Trichogrammatidae is one of the earliest branching families of the superfamily

229

Chalcidoidea [64, 65]. Although many members of this family are generalists, host specificity

230

has also been reported [66-68]. The two T. brassicae lineages used for this study were collected

231

from a same unique location in Iran, from a same host species, Ostrinia nubilalis, and were later

232

shown to share the same genetic background, we believe they originally share similar host

233

preference. Thus, the differences observed in our study are more likely only due to the insects’

234

Wolbachia infection status.

235

By relaxing strict host preference through modifying pre-imaginal learning ability in its host,

236

generalist Wolbachia infected individuals could oviposit in and thus benefit from a wider range

237

of hosts resource [69, 70]. They may as well benefit from a more nutritionally balanced diet, and

238

show higher capacity to confront variable environments [71-73]. In contrast, the information-

239

processing hypothesis suggests that highly efficient decision-making should evolve faster in

240

specialist foragers compared to generalists [74-77]. Additionally, specialists may also evolve as

241

better competitors on their unique hosts, and thus show higher survival, but could also be more

242

susceptible to population fluctuation of the host than generalist species [78, 79].

243

According to our results, Wolbachia infected wasps show similar host preference behavior even

244

after emerging from different hosts. Previously, [80] shown that there are no differences in

245

olfactory responses between conditioned and unconditioned Wolbachia infected T. brassicae

246

toward peppermint odor. The fixed behaviors were suggested to be a consequence of Wolbachia

247

affecting organs structure and function [81, 82], and thus potentially leading to poor information

248

integration, and no differentiation between different host species and host qualities [44]. Studies

249

have also shown that Wolbachia can directly affect a range of neurotransmitters with potential

250

impacts on subsequent fitness-related behaviors in various insects [48, 83, 84]. Learning capacity

251

may allow the host to tune behavior to an adaptive solution, especially when the environment is

252

not informative enough for the specific foraging behavior to be optimized [85]. Through

253

manipulating the time dedicated to cues learning and/or information processing, Wolbachia may

254

thus appear beneficial for the host that can utilize and develop on different host species.

255

Specialists have long been seen as potential evolutionary dead-ends [86], but more recent

256

research indicates that transition from specialist to generalist phenotype often occur [87]. Switch

257

to a new host however will most likely require genetic, physiologic, and ecological adaptations

258

from the parasitoid wasps [33, 37, 88, 89]. Our study suggests that symbionts like Wolbachia can

259

be powerful evolutionary motors in the transition from specialization to generalization [90-92],

260

as their presence may decrease adaptations costs to the new hosts [93,94]. To switch and survive

261

in/on new hosts, the parasitoids must overcome many new ecological and physiological barriers

262

imposed by the new hosts such as overcoming host immune system [95]. Wolbachia has been

263

shown to be involved in nutritional provisioning for its hosts, such as providing some elements

264

missing from their host diet or environment [96-99]. In T. brassicae, [100] showed that

265

Wolbachia may provide for the larval development of their host, as individuals previously reared

266

on hosts of different qualities showed no fitness differences at the adult stage. The details of this

267

potential provision however remain unclear.

268
269

Conclusion

270

We show here that Wolbachia can indeed manipulate its host preference for certain resource, and

271

maintain a generalist parasitism strategy in T. brassicae. Although the details of the genetic and

272

physiological background of the behavioral manipulation still remain to be investigated, we

273

believe this phenotype is conserved in nature as it may support the spread of the symbiotic strain

274

in unstable environments, in which specialists may be at higher risk of extinction. Wolbachia has

275

been considered as “a generalist in host use” as it is thought to be present in at least 40% of all

276

insects [101]. Although a strict maternal transmittion of the symbiont would lead to co-evolution

277

of the symbiont and its hosts, phylogenetic studies have shown that the phylogenetic trees of

278

Wolbachia strains is rarely congruent with those of their insect hosts [102]. These results suggest

279

that Wolbachia transfer horizontally between host species more often than previously thought.

280

By restraining its host ability to preferentially parasitize the Lepidoptera host species it emerge

281

from, the Wolbachia strain present in T. brassicae may thus increase its chance to transfer

282

horizontal and potentially establish in a wider range of naïve species populations.
