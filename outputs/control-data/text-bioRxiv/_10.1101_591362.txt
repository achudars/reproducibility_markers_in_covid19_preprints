sistently shown that heart failure is associated with the reactivation of a fetal gene program: a curated set of genes with
well-established roles in fetal heart development that are normally repressed in non-failing adult heart 13,14 . Notably, a
fetalization mechanism has also been suggested for similar
pathways involved in lung disease 15,16 and tumorigenesis 17 .
However, the full quantitative extent of fetal gene program
reactivation in disease processes and the identity of the gene
regulatory sequences correlated with these changes remain
unknown.
Gene expression is controlled in part by enhancers, a major class of cis-regulatory elements, which can act over large
genomic distances to activate gene transcription in specific
cell types or developmental stages 9 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) targeting
enhancer-associated chromatin marks (e.g., H3K27ac) can be
used to generate accurate genome-wide maps of enhancers
active in a tissue of interest 10,18 . However, the small number
of ChIP-seq data sets from individual human heart samples
described to date has been insufficient to systematically assess the reproducibility of the cardiac enhancer landscape in
healthy individuals or to quantify and characterize possible
changes associated with disease states 19–21 . In particular, a
recent study examined cardiomyocyte cells isolated from a
small number of failing and non-failing hearts to explore the
regulatory landscape of these cells in disease 22 but identified
a very limited set of enhancers that were differentially active
between these states.
We performed a comprehensive exploration of human heart
enhancers in left ventricle samples from an extensive cohort
of control adults and individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see study overview in Figure 1). In healthy hearts, we
observe a highly reproducible enhancer landscape across individuals. Furthermore, we observe major changes in the regulatory landscape of DCM samples and, through comparison
with fetal heart tissue samples, demonstrate that more than
3,400 enhancers adopt fetal-like regulatory activity states
in DCM. We also show that these enhancers are enriched
in a specific subset of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor binding sites and are sufficient to drive cardiac expression in vivo in transgenic mouse reporter assays.

Heart disease is associated with re-expression of key transcription factors normally active only during prenatal development of the heart. However, the impact of this reactivation
on the genome-wide regulatory landscape in heart disease has
remained obscure. Here we show that pervasive epigenomic
changes occur in heart disease, with thousands of regulatory sequences reacquiring fetal-like chromatin signatures. We used
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq targeting a histone modification associated with active transcriptional enhancers to generate genomewide enhancer maps from left ventricle tissue from 18 healthy
controls and 18 individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Healthy individuals had a highly reproducible
epigenomic landscape, consisting of more than 31,000 predicted
heart enhancers. In contrast, we observed reproducible diseaseassociated gains or losses of activity at more than 7,500 predicted heart enhancers. Next, we profiled human fetal heart
tissue by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Comparison with adult tissues revealed that the heart disease epigenome and transcriptome both shift toward a fetal-like state, with 3,400 individual enhancers sharing fetal regulatory properties. Our results
demonstrate widespread epigenomic changes in DCM, and we
provide a comprehensive data resource (http://heart.lbl.gov) for
the mechanistic exploration of heart disease etiology.

Introduction

Heart failure resulting from cardiomyopathy is a prevailing
cause of adult mortality worldwide 1 . Among cardiomyopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common 2 and is characterized by the dilation and weakening of
the left ventricle and decreased ejection fraction in the absence of coronary artery disease or other abnormalities 3 . Approximately one third of DCM cases are explained by coding
mutations in known genes 4,5 . Gene expression studies have
been widely used to facilitate the identification of additional
causal genetic variation and to understand the transcriptional
pathways impacted during heart failure, which may provide
new therapeutic targets 6–8 . Transcriptional profiling of failing hearts, including those with idiopathic DCM, has identified numerous coding and non-coding genes whose expression is altered in heart disease 7,9–12 . These studies have con-

tome. We defined enhancers as genomic regions with significant H3K27ac enrichment that are at least 1 kbp away from
the nearest transcription start site (see Methods). All chromatin and RNA-seq data from these samples, as well as disease samples described below, are available for download and
browsing in an accompanying web resource (heart.lbl.gov).
Control samples had an average of 17,352 putative distal
enhancers, with 40% of peaks identified in any given control sample present in all other control samples, 78% shared
across two-thirds of all control samples, and only 9% (685)
unique to the individual (Figure 2a). Across all 18 control
samples, we identified a total of 43,363 predicted distal enhancers present in at least one sample, with more than 70%
(31,033) found in at least two individuals (Supplementary
Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2). To determine the functions of genes associated with the cardiac enhancers predicted through this approach, we examined the enrichment of
functional ontology terms 24 among genes located near candidate regions showing strong H3K27ac enrichment in at least
16 healthy controls (see Methods). Among the most significantly enriched annotations derived from mouse gene expression studies, 11 of the top 20 are cardiovascular-related functions (Supplementary Table 3). Our results indicate that the
enhancer landscape in healthy human hearts is overall highly
reproducible, with quantitatively modest differences between
individuals.
To verify that enhancers predicted by this ChIP-seq approach
are bona fide cardiac-specific regulatory sequences, we first
compared our predicted human heart enhancers with the
VISTA Enhancer Browser (enhancer.lbl.gov), an existing catalog of in vivo validated enhancers 23 . This database contains 283 human and mouse loci that have been tested using transgenic mouse assays and have validated activity in
the heart. Nearly 55% (n=154) of these validated heart enhancers overlapped peaks in our adult human heart samples
(Supplementary Table 2). We additionally performed forward in vivo validation using transgenic mouse reporter assays 25 at embryonic day 11.5 for several candidate human
adult heart enhancers. Examples of reproducible in vivo cardiac reporter activity driven by different candidate enhancers,
including one near PDLIM3, are shown in Figure 2b, c. Together, these results reinforce that predicted adult heart enhancers drive gene expression in heart tissue.

Fig. 1. Overview of this study. We performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on left
ventricle samples from 18 healthy donors. We identify reproducible enhancer predictions and gene expression patterns in healthy heart (top). Next, we identify global
alterations in enhancer occupancy from 18 hearts with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (center). Last, we compare adult healthy and disease states with 5
embryonic or fetal heart and identify similarities in the enhancer landscapes of DCM
and fetal heart (bottom).

We demonstrate, through correlation with transcriptome data,
that enhancers activated in disease are in close proximity to
genes with increased expression in disease. Finally, we identify more than 200 fetal heart genes that are up-regulated in
adult heart failure. Taken together, our findings indicate that
a large number of fetal heart enhancers become consistently
reactivated in heart disease, and our results identify the genomic locations and activation states of these enhancers, providing a rich resource for the exploration of mechanistic links
between enhancers and clinical cardiac phenotypes.

Results
Highly Reproducible Heart Enhancer Landscape in
Healthy Individuals. To assess the heterogeneity of the gene

regulatory landscape in healthy human hearts, we used chromatin profiling to identify putative enhancer regions. We performed ChIP-seq with an antibody to H3K27ac on left ventricle samples from 10 male and 8 female healthy adult donor
hearts for which an acceptable transplant recipient could not
be found (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1). In parallel,
we performed RNA-seq on these samples to enable a comparison of each enhancer profile with its associated transcrip2

Differential Regulation of Disease-Related Genes and
Pathways. To further assess the regulatory relationship be-

tween differentially active enhancers and differentially expressed genes in DCM, we examined correlations between
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data. We observed multiple anecdotal examples of differentially active enhancers located near
genes with the same directionality of differential expression.
An illustrative example is provided by the SMOC2 locus,
where a strong, DCM-specific increase in H3K27ac signal
at a site 20 kb upstream of the promoter correlates with a
strong increase in SMOC2 expression in DCM (Figure 4a).
To examine this effect beyond individual loci, we performed
a global correlation analysis, assessing the enrichment of
differentially bound candidate enhancers near differentially
expressed genes. Differentially bound candidate enhancers
with increased binding are indeed enriched near differentially upregulated genes, and candidate enhancers with decreased binding are enriched near downregulated genes, with

the most pronounced enrichment observed within the 100 kb
window closest to the promoter (Figure 4b, c).
To assess the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes and differentially active enhancers, we examined their enrichment for biological process ontology
terms 24 . For the 4,406 enhancer peaks with predicted increased activity in DCM, there is enrichment for terms
including extracellular matrix remodeling (Supplementary
Table 7). Similarly, genes up-regulated in DCM independently show enrichment for extracellular matrix components
and cell adhesion (Supplementary Table 8). These results
reinforce our conclusion that DCM-specific enhancers are enriched near genes that are differentially regulated in disease,
highlighting fibrosis pathways in heart failure 27 .
To identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) that may
be driving altered enhancer activity in DCM, we performed
binding site enrichment analysis 28 for distal enhancer peaks

involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 29 , which
may contribute to cardiac fibrosis 30 . In peaks with decreased
activity in DCM, there is enrichment in nuclear receptor transcription factor binding sites (Figure 4e). We found particularly pronounced enrichment in glucocorticoid response elements (GRE), which are involved in growth and immune
response pathways 31 . We also found enrichment of bZIP
factors that are part of the AP-1 complex, which has been
suggested to act as homeostatic regulator required to maintain a steady state of cell proliferation 32,33 . Taken together,
these data show that heart disease-associated enhancers are
enriched near genes differentially regulated in disease and
that known functions of these genes are consistent with roles
in heart failure.

However, beyond anecdotal examples, the transcriptomewide scale of such re-expression of prenatally expressed human genes in DCM has remained unclear. Likewise, it is unknown whether reactivation of these fetal genes is associated
with reactivation of fetal regulatory elements. To comprehensively define the fetal gene program reactivated in dilated
cardiomyopathy and to test whether enhancer regulation correlates with the re-expression of fetal genes, we performed
ChIP-seq and RNA-seq on five embryonic and fetal human
heart samples, covering developmental stages ranging from 8
weeks to 17 weeks post conception (Figure 5a, Supplementary Tables 9, 10; see Methods for sample details). We performed principal component analysis followed by dimensionality reduction using t-SNE to capture variation from multiple
principal components for healthy, DCM, and prenatal samples (Figure 5b, c; Supplementary Figure 4; and Methods). These analyses, capturing the local and global structure
of complex data for visualization in two dimensions 35 , indicate that the three groups of samples (adult controls, adult

enhancer signatures (Figure 5b, c). Consistent with the notion of reactivation of fetal genes in heart disease, we found
that genes expressed during fetal development are enriched
among those upregulated in DCM relative to healthy adult
heart and vice versa (Supplementary Figure 4c, d).
In total, of the 416 genes upregulated in DCM, 213 are upregulated in fetal heart relative to healthy adult. To examine if this coincides with enhancers returning to a fetal-like
state in heart disease, we focused on the activity states of
4,547 regions that showed differential H3K27ac binding in
both health versus DCM, as well as in adult versus fetal samples. The majority of these enhancers (76%, n=3,471) show
the same activity state in fetal and adult DCM heart, respectively, resulting in an overlap of DCM- and fetal-biased peaks
that was enriched 1.6-fold relative to the overlap expected by
chance (Figure 5d, e). For the 1,622 enhancers with predicted increased activity in DCM and fetal, there is enrichment for gene ontology terms associated with fibrosis and

pathways are upregulated in cardiac development and in heart

properties in DCM, we also observed populations of enhancers that are either anti-correlated with fetal enhancer
activity states (n=1,076) or that were DCM-specific, i.e.
showed activity states that were different from fetal and
healthy adult cardiac tissue (n=2,960). Both of these groups
of enhancers indicate that while the genome-wide alterations

between DCM and fetal development versus those that are
specific to DCM, we examined enrichment of transcription
factor binding site motifs in the 1,622 enhancers that have
increased activity in both versus the 2,784 that are upregulated only in DCM. Both sets of enhancers were generally
enriched for bHLH transcription factor binding motifs, but
we observed the most significant enrichment for distinct subsets of bHLH motifs (Supplementary Figure 5). For example, enhancers with increased activity in both DCM and fetal
samples were especially enriched in motifs for MyoD and

Understanding the mechanisms regulating gene expression
in healthy and pathological states of the heart is critical for
understanding cardiac biology and disease. By performing
enhancer discovery by ChIP-seq on heart tissues from a sizable cohort of individuals, we were able to assess the baseline
variation in heart enhancer landscape across the population.
Importantly, we found that the activity of cardiac enhancers is
well conserved across individuals. This observation, together
with the underlying comprehensive maps of heart enhancers
generated through this study, provides an important reference
point for assessing the impact of environmental factors, genetic variation, and disease-associated molecular processes
on cardiac gene regulation.
Similar to the high reproducibility of the enhancer landscape in the healthy heart, our systematic assessment of enhancers in DCM, the most common cardiomyopathy, revealed disease-associated activity changes in thousands of
enhancers that were highly reproducible across individuals.
This insight implies that pathological disease states of the
heart are not associated with a general disruption of coordinated gene expression, but instead show a complex, but
well-defined shift in genome-wide transcriptional regulation
involving a distinct set of distant-acting enhancers.
Finally, our comparison with data from fetal heart tissue uncovered that, beyond the limited number of examples described to date 13,14 , hundreds of fetal genes and more than
a thousand fetal enhancers become consistently reactivated
in adult heart disease. Our study identified the genomic locations and activation states of this intriguing subset of diseaseassociated enhancers, offering an entry point for targeted experimental exploration for hundreds of genes with diseaseassociated activity changes. Reactivation of individual fetal
pathways has also been observed in other, non-cardiac disease processes 15–17 . While limited to anecdotal examples,
in conjunction with data from the present study, these reports raise the possibility that widespread reactivation of fetal enhancers is a more generalized disease-associated phenomenon.
Taken together, our study highlights how the etiology of a disease process with major epidemiological relevance is tightly
interlinked with, and possibly driven by, reproducible activity
changes across thousands of enhancers in the human genome.
The identification of substantial overlap between diseaseassociated and developmentally active cardiac enhancers reinforces the notion that modulation of genes and pathways
normally active in the embryonic and fetal heart may impact
on disease progression 13 , thus providing inspiration for new
therapeutic strategies.

Mouse embryos were only excluded from further analysis if
they did not carry the reporter transgene or if they were not
at the correct developmental stage. Randomization and experimenter blinding were unnecessary and not performed for
transgenic assays, as all resulting embryos were treated with
identical experimental conditions and no direct comparisons

counts were log2-converted, imported in a Seurat object, and
scaled. PCA was then run using regions showing highly variable signal (mean.function = ExpMean, dispersion.function
= LogVMR, x.low.cutoff = 0, x.high.cutoff = 14, y.cutoff =
1, num.bin=100). To determine the correct settings for t-SNE
visualization, the optimal number of components was determined by JackStraw, resulting in the top 4 components to be
used as input for the t-SNE. This was run using the Seurat
internal function and perplexity set to values in the following
range: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]. Figures show t-SNE graphs with
perplexity of 10.

(cat#39133, lot 01613007). Protein A and G Dynabeads
(Invitrogen) were then added to this chromatin/antibody
mixture for 30 minutes at 4°C. Immuno-complexes were
sequentially washed. The protein/DNA complexes were
eluted in an SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10
mM EDTA) at 37°C for one hour. Samples were treated
with Proteinase K at 37°C and reverse-crosslinked overnight.
Finally, the DNA was purified on Zymo ChIP clean and
concentrate columns (Zymo Research), and the quality
was assessed on the Agilent bioanalyzer. The ChIP-seq
libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq library
preparation kit followed by pooling of libraries. Libraries
were pooled and sequenced via single end 50 bp reads on a
HiSeq 2500 (6 libraries per lane) or HiSeq 4000 (8 libraries

Kit (Agilent). RNA sequencing libraries were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Human/Mouse/Rat kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA-seq libraries were subjected to an additional purification to remove remaining high molecular
weight products as follows: sample volume was increased
to 100 µl by addition of 1X TE buffer or Illumina Resuspension Buffer and then incubated with 60 µl Agencourt AMPure XP beads for 4 min. The beads were pelleted by incubation on a magnet, and the entire supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 50 µl of fresh AMPure XP beads
and incubated for 4 min. After pelleting the new beads with
a magnet, the supernatant was discarded, the beads washed
twice with 80% ethanol and the DNA was eluted in 30 µl Illumina Resuspension buffer. The resulting RNAseq libraries
were diluted 10×, and their quality and concentration were
assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity

by pronuclear injection, and F0 embryos were collected at
embryonic day 11.5 and stained for LacZ activity as previously described 25,39 . Only patterns that were observed in
at least three different embryos resulting from independent

Gene enrichment. To identify gene ontologies enriched
in differential regions we ran GREAT 24 version 3.0.0
using default settings, including the association rule:
Basal+extension: 5,000 bp upstream, 1,000 bp downstream,
1,000,000 bp max extension, curated regulatory domains included. We used the Lift Genome Annotations tool in the
UCSC genome browser (genome.ucsc.edu) to convert hg38
regions to hg19 regions required for GREAT input. We identified the most significant terms by binomial q value using the
GO Biological Process and GO Molecular Function ontologies. To identify gene ontologies represented in differentially
expressed genes, we used PANTHER 46 version 10.0 and ran
the PANTHER Overrepresentation Test (release 20181113).

total number of expressed genes includes all genes present
in at least two samples with normalized CPM (counts per

the previous paragraph, using the log2-transformed, TMMnormalized expression values as input. PCA results were
robust to the choice of the most variable genes used as input (range tested: 1,000 to 10,000). t-SNE 35 was run using Seurat 44 as described in the previous paragraph, with
the exception of the parameters used to identify highly variable signal (mean.function = ExpMean, dispersion.function
