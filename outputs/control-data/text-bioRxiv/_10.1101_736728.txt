Abstract:
Polarized protein distributions at the cortex play an important role in the spatial organization of cells.
In S. pombe, growing microtubule ends contribute to the establishment and maintenance of such
distributions by delivering specific factors to membrane receptors at the poles of the cell. It is
however unclear how microtubule plus-end tracking of proteins favours protein accumulation at the
cell cortex compared to proteins arriving directly from the cytoplasm. To address this question, we
developed an in vitro assay, where microtubules were made to deliver His-tagged plus-end tracking
proteins to functionalized microchamber walls. We found that motor-mediated protein clusters
formed at microtubule ends were able to transfer to the walls, but non-clustered proteins were not.
We further show that this transfer mechanism leads to preferential cluster accumulation at chamber
poles, when microtubules are confined to elongated microfabricated chambers with sizes and shapes
similar to S. pombe.

Introduction
Polarized distributions of proteins at the cell cortex serve as cues to organize and localize intracellular
components. Such protein distributions are involved in defining cell polarity and dictating the
directionality of global processes such as cell division, migration, or polarized cell growth [Nelson
2003, Macara and Milli 2010]. There are multiple mechanisms by which cortical protein distributions

may in principle be formed, either based on reaction-diffusion principles and/or dependent on
cytoskeletal processes [Vendel et al. 2019], but the exact mechanisms are not yet understood. Here
we focus on the principles behind establishment of polarized protein distributions in the model
system fission yeast, where dynamic microtubules are essential in targeting cell-end specific factors
to the cell poles.

Microtubules are long protein filaments formed by the assembly of alpha and beta-tubulin
heterodimers. They typically consist of 13 protofilaments that form a hollow tube of about 24 nm
diameter that can extend up to several tens of micrometres [Tilney et al. 1973]. Microtubules
stochastically switch between two states in a process termed dynamic instability: a slow-growing
state caused by the net addition and lateral association of heterodimers at the protofilament ends;
and a fast-shrinking state caused by curling out of the protofilament ends and subsequent
disassembly from the tubular structure into short unstable pieces [Mitchison and Kirschner 1984,
Desai & Mitchison 1997, Walker et al. 1988]. The switch from growth to shrinkage is termed a
‘catastrophe’ and the reverse a ‘rescue’. The end of the microtubule that is exposing beta-tubulins,
termed the plus end, is highly dynamic. The other end, the minus end, is much less dynamic and is
often anchored at a microtubule nucleating centre.

In cells, microtubules typically grow from nucleating centres near the middle of the cell towards the
cell periphery, where contact with the cell cortex may cause temporal stalling or buckling, followed
by catastrophe [Tran et al. 2001, Tischer et al. 2009]. Upon such contact-induced catastrophes,
proteins that specifically associate with growing microtubule plus ends, so-called +Tips [Akhmanova
and Steinmetz 2008], may be transferred to the cortex leaving behind a protein “hot spot” that
contributes to the establishment of a cortical protein distribution [Siegrist and Doe 2007]. This has
been extensively shown in S. pombe [Mata and Nurse 1997, Dodgson et al. 2013], and may occur also
in neurons and migrating cells [Horiguchi etal. 2012, Siegrist and Doe 2007].

Although microtubule-mediated protein transfers have been observed in vivo, it is not clear what the
requirements for successful transfers are. Interestingly, +Tips that are transferred in vivo associate
with microtubule plus ends by forming complexes with other proteins, including motor proteins. In S.
pombe, transfer of the protein Tea1, responsible for polarized cell growth, requires the interaction
between several +Tips (Figure 1A). These include the EB homologue Mal3, the kinesin-like Tea2, and
the CLIP-170 homologue, Tip1, among others [Busch et al. 2004a, Busch et al. 2004b, Martin et al.
2005] (see Figure S1A for more details). Tea1 binds to Tip1-Tea2 complexes by direct interaction with
Tip1 [Behrens and Nurse 2002, Feierbach 2004]. Tip1-Tea2 complexes are recruited to the
microtubule lattice and transported to the microtubule end with the help of Mal3 [Bieling et al. 2007].
Transfer of Tea1, Tip1, and Tea2, but not Mal3, to the cell cortex occurs by direct interaction
between Tea1 and the transmembrane prenylated anchor Mod5 [Behrens and Nurse 2002, Browning
2003, Snaith and Sawin 2003, Busch et al. 2004, Feierbach et al. 2004, Snaith et al. 2005, Meadows et
al. 2018]. At the cortex, Tea1 proteins, as well as other cell end factors, have been found in clusters
of sizes up to 100 nm [Bicho et al. 2005, Dodgson et al. 2013].

In this study, we sought to establish an in vitro assay in which the mechanism of microtubulemediated protein transfer could be addressed with a minimal number of components. The specific
question we asked is whether and how the transfer of +Tips to a biomimetic cortical receptor differs
between autonomous plus-end trackers and motor-mediated plus-end complexes. We developed an
assay where dynamic microtubules bring His-tagged +Tips in contact with a glass wall functionalized
with Ni-NTA (Figure 3A) [Taberner et al. 2014]. We tested under which conditions this microtubulebased delivery of proteins to the wall led to successful transfers. As an autonomous tip tracker, we
used His-tagged Mal3, and as a motor-mediated complex we used the Tip1-Tea2-Mal3 system with
only Tip1 carrying a His-tag. In both cases, only the His-tagged proteins had affinity for the
functionalized walls. We found that His-tagged Tip1 formed clusters at microtubule ends that were

efficiently transferred to functionalized walls (as well as other microtubule lattices). In contrast, Histagged Mal3, which accumulates at microtubule ends but does not appear to form clusters, was not
transferred, even when total protein numbers at microtubule ends were comparable. We further
observed that in the presence of ADP-bound Tea2, which has reduced microtubule affinity, Histagged Tip1 cluster formation at microtubule ends was highly reduced and so were transfers to the
walls. These observations show that a locally enhanced concentration of proteins at the microtubule
end is not enough to produce successful transfers. Instead, clustering at microtubule ends seems
necessary. We further found that microtubule catastrophe events, although not necessary, facilitated
protein transfers. We finally used the developed in vitro assay to show that transfer of protein
clusters by microtubule ends is biased to the chamber poles of elongated micro-fabricated chambers,
when microtubules spontaneously align. This leads to a mildly polarized protein distribution in a
chamber-length-dependent manner.

Results
Tip1 forms transferable clusters at microtubule ends
Before confronting growing microtubules with functionalized walls, we screened experimental
parameters to find out under which conditions maximum accumulation of His-tagged +Tips at
growing microtubule plus ends is achieved. We let microtubules polymerize from GMPCPP stabilized
‘seeds’ bound to a glass slide in the presence of either 6H::Mal3::mCherry or Mal3, Tea2 and
6H::eGFP::Tip1 at different protein concentrations. As shown in earlier studies, 6H::Mal3::mCherry
forms comets at growing microtubule plus ends with fluorescent intensities saturating at
concentrations around 200nM. (Figure 1B and D) [Bieling et al. 2007, Maurer et al. 2011]. As also
previously shown [Bieling et al. 2007], the fluorescent signal of 6H::eGFP::Tip1 (150 nM), in the
presence of Mal3 (200 nM) and Tea2 (with ATP), reveals transport traces along GDP microtubule
lattices as well as protein accumulation at growing microtubule plus ends (Figure 1C). At low Tea2

concentrations (10 nM), 6H::eGFP::Tip1 accumulation at microtubule ends was comparable to
autonomous 6H::Mal3::mCherry accumulation at similar concentrations (Figure 1E). Increasing Tea2
up to 100nM led to a higher accumulation of 6H::eGFP::Tip1 at the plus ends (Figure 1E and F). Note
that the Tip1 signal increased in a non-linear way both as a function of Tip1 concentration (Figure 1E)
and Tea2 concentration (Figure 1F), and was highly variable at high motor concentrations. Therefore,
the number of 6H::eGFP::Tip1 molecules that can accumulate at microtubule ends with the help of
active Tea2 is much higher than the number of 6H::Mal3::mCherry molecules that can autonomously
track microtubule ends.

In addition we observed, even at low Tea2 concentrations, that 6H::eGFP::Tip1 proteins which
accumulated at growing plus ends could be transferred to other crossing microtubule lattices in
apparent “clusters” that continued advancing on the accepting lattice (Figures 1G and H). During
transfers, the clusters formed physical links between the two microtubules that could last several
seconds (Figure 1G). Via this link, a donating microtubule plus end could be stirred along an accepting
microtubule (Figure 1G), which suggests that clusters contain multiple motor proteins (Figure 1I).
Interestingly, transferred clusters often showed lower speeds than “normal” Tea2-driven Tip1 traces
on microtubule lattices (Figure 1G and Supplementary 2). We thus conclude that Tip1 can form
transferable clusters at microtubule plus ends, even at low Tea2 concentrations. This motormediated cluster formation is likely the reason that at high Tea2 concentrations, Tip1 can accumulate
at much higher numbers than saturating numbers of Mal3.

We note that “normal” 6H::eGFP::Tip1 traces were not observed on GMPCPP microtubule lattices
(the seeds), for which Mal3 has very low affinity (Figure S1B) [Maurer et al. 2011]. Interestingly,
6H::eGFP::Tip1 transported from growing minus ends detached from the microtubule when reaching
the GMPCPP lattice (Figure S1B). This suggests that Mal3 is not only needed for recruitment of Tip1
and Tea2 to the microtubule lattice, but also for transport along the lattice.

Preparing the biomimetic cortex
To create a biomimetic cortex, we fabricated glass micro-chambers with 300-400 nm high sidewalls,
containing a double layer of 50 nm chromium and 50 nm gold on top to create an overhang (Figure
2A, S2AB). The walls of the chambers were functionalized with chelated nickel ions using
poly(ethylene glycol) - grafted with copolymer poly(L-lysine), and derivatives of copolymer poly(Llysine) with a functional three-head nitrilotriacetic (PLL-g-PEG/tris-Ni(II)-NTA) [Bhagawati et al. 2013]
(Figure 2B, S2C). The bottom surfaces of the microchambers were coated with either PLL-gPEG/biotin for subsequent immobilization of biotinylated microtubule GMPCPP ‘seeds’ or PLL-g-PEG
for passivation against unspecific absorption of proteins using a previously described method
[Taberner et al. 2014].

Each Tris-Ni(II)-NTA unit contains three chelated nickel(II) ions (Figure 2B). To each of these ions two
histidines can reversibly bind via their imidazole functional group. A His-tagged protein, containing
six consecutive histidines, can thus bind stoichiometrically to one Tris-Ni(II)-NTA unit [Lata and
Piehler 2005]. Addition of imidazole in solution competes with His-tagged proteins for binding sites,
therefore it effectively reduces His-tagged protein affinity for Tris-Ni(II)-NTA. To avoid strong direct
binding of proteins from solution to the walls, the cortical affinity needs to be slightly lower than that
of the proteins for the microtubule ends. We found that at 10 mM imidazole, 6H::eGFP::Tip1 as well
as 6H::Mal3::mCherry at 150 nM would exhibit very low binding to the wall, fulfilling this condition.
Indeed, measurement of the 6H::Mal3::mCherry binding curve to the wall at 10 mM imidazole
yielded a dissociation constant of KD = 190±20 nM, indicative of the concentration at which on
average half of the wall binding sites are occupied with 6H::Mal3::mCherry (Figure 2CD). Alternative
experiments to measure the KD of 6H::eGFP::Tip1 in individual samples gave similar order of
magnitude results (Figure S3).

Microtubules transfer Tip1 clusters to the biomimetic cortex
We then tested whether microtubule ends could transfer his-tagged Mal3 or his-tagged Tip1 to the
functionalized walls. Stabilized microtubule seeds were immobilized on the bottom surface via
biotin-streptavidin linkages. Dynamic microtubules were grown in the presence of either 150 nM
6H::Mal3::mCherry or 150 nM 6H::eGFP::Tip1, 10 nM Tea2 and 200 nM Mal3 with an imidazole
concentration of 10 mM (Figure 3A). We observed microtubule plus end contacts with the wall and
measured the fluorescence intensity at the contact point over time.

Figures 3B and Movie 2 show a typical example of a microtubule delivering 6H::Mal3::mCherry to the
wall (dotted yellow circle). In these experiments, the protein delivered to the wall did not remain
attached after microtubule catastrophe. This can be seen in the kymograph along the microtubule,
and also in the fluorescence intensity at the contact point with the wall over time (Figure 3B below).
Although the 6H::Mal3::mCherry fluorescence signal at the wall increased upon microtubule contact
(at 218 s), it returned to pre-contact values after microtubule catastrophe (at 232 s). Fluorescence
intensity values were normalized to the average intensity elsewhere at the wall (where no protein
was delivered). In the example shown, the spot on the wall reached by the microtubule contained no
pre-bound protein, therefore the base intensity (when no microtubule end is inside the spot)
fluctuates around 1 a.u. In the case of microtubules delivering 6H::eGFP::Tip1 to the walls, clear
transfers were often observed (Movie 3). Figure 3C left shows an example where the microtubule
transferred 6H::eGFP::Tip1 to a spot on the wall (at 115 s, dotted yellow circle), and then continued
sliding along the wall. This same microtubule later stopped moving at another spot on the wall (at
170s, yellow arrow), transferred extra protein there, and then underwent catastrophe (dashed
yellow line in the kymograph). During the shrinking phase, the microtubule end slid back along the
wall, and passed again through the first spot. This contact did not leave extra protein behind at the
wall (Figure 3C left at 290 s).

We quantified the success of protein transfers for individual events by plotting the amount of protein
(as measured by fluorescence intensity) left behind at the wall after microtubule contact (Figure 4
inset) versus the amount of protein delivered by the microtubule plus end. Protein delivered by the
microtubules was determined by the average fluorescence intensity at the wall during microtubule
contact. We distinguished between cases where the microtubule left the contact point by
undergoing catastrophe (´MT catastrophe´) or by continuing sliding along the wall (‘no MT
catastrophe’). We also distinguished between ‘end-on’ contacts (angle between the microtubule and
the wall larger than 15˚) and lateral contacts (all other cases).

Quantification of all plus end contacts with the walls shows that 6H::Mal3::mCherry (Figure 4A first
row panels) was not transferred at all, whereas 6H::eGFP::Tip1 was clearly transferred, proportional
to the amount of protein delivered by the microtubule plus end (Figure 4A second row panels). Histagged eGFP::Tip1 transfers exhibited on average 34±1% docking efficiency. Instead, for
6H::Mal3::mCherry the average amount of protein transferred was negligible (~0.03 a.u.), regardless
of the amount of protein delivered by the microtubule. Many microtubule plus ends delivered more
6H::eGFP::Tip1 protein to the wall than maximally possible for 6H::Mal3::mCherry (Figure 4B) (see
also results for freely growing microtubules above). For these high protein amounts, i.e. deliveries
above 13 a.u., successful transfers were observed in almost all cases (Figure 4B). Although the
example in Figure 3C shows that microtubule catastrophe is not a requirement for successful
transfers, many events in which the microtubule left the contact point by sliding along the wall did
not lead to successful transfers (Figure 4A and B central panels). As a result, the average efficiency of
protein transfer was lower (11±1%) than after catastrophes.

Our observations suggest that Tea2 motor activity promotes the ability of Tip1 to form clusters at
microtubule ends, and that cluster formation is a requirement for successful transfers to the

functionalized wall. There are however other possible reasons for the difference in behaviour
between 6H::Mal3::mCherry and 6H::eGFP::Tip1 proteins. For example, it is possible that aggregates
of Tip1 are present in solution which would appear as high-density clusters when transported as
cargo by Tea2 motor proteins. In addition, differences in protein size, location of the histidine tag,
and exact binding location at the microtubule end [Maurer et al. 2012, Maurer et al. 2014, Zhang et
al. 2015] could all lead to differences in the ability of individual proteins to “reach” the functionalized
wall while still bound to the microtubule end.

To start with the last possibility, we analysed plus end contacts with the wall in a lateral configuration.
In this case, proteins that do not reach the very tip of the microtubule (such as Mal3 under normal
circumstances) can still contact the wall. Although lateral contacts led to clear transfers of
6H::eGFP::Tip1, they again did not lead to transfers of 6H::Mal3::mCherry (see Figure 4 A). To rule
out the effect of differences in protein size and location of the histidine tag, we next looked for a way
to impose Mal3-like microtubule-binding behaviour on Tip1. We removed the microtubule binding
and motor activity of Tea2 by substituting ATP by ADP in our 6H::eGFP::Tip1 assays [Cross 2016].
Under these conditions, 6H::eGFP::Tip1 exhibited Mal3-like end tracking behaviour at both
microtubule ends and transport traces along the lattice were no longer observed (Figure 1C). In the
presence of ADP, Tea2 presumably acts as a passive linker between Mal3 and Tip1 to help recruit
Tip1 to growing microtubule ends, since Tip1 does not end track in the presence of Mal3 alone
[Bieling et al. 2007 and our own observations]. When we replaced ATP with ADP in 6H::eGFP::Tip1
delivery experiments, clear transfers were rarely observed (Figure 3C, Movie 4, and Figure 4A third
row panels). Interestingly, in these assays, 6H::eGFP::Tip1 numbers at microtubule ends were
considerably lower than for assays with ATP, indicating that cluster formation had been highly
impaired. Since in the presence of ADP the behaviour of Tip1 was similar to that of Mal3, we
attribute the failure to transfer to the walls to the inability to form clusters rather than to differences

in molecular details. The lack of Tip1 cluster formation in the presence of ADP furthermore argues
against the possibility that Tip1 is simply forming aggregates in solution.

Tip1 clusters stabilize microtubules against catastrophes during wall
contact
We observed significantly different dynamics for microtubules encountering the wall in assays with
6H::eGFP::Tip1 containing ATP compared to assays containing ADP, or assays with 6H::Mal3::mCherry.
While in the latter two assays 70% of the microtubules underwent catastrophe upon first contact
with the wall, this only occurred in 40% of the cases for the 6H::eGFP::Tip1 samples with ATP (Figure
5A, coloured fractions). Microtubules in the remaining (grey) fractions continued sliding along the
wall, and eventually underwent catastrophe somewhere else.

We also quantified the fraction of microtubules that showed clear buckling due to prolonged contact
with a fixed point on the wall while continuing microtubule growth (Figure 5A, dashed fractions).
Only 6H::eGFP::Tip1 samples containing ATP showed significant fractions of microtubule buckling
(30% of the events). We previously showed that in the absence of +Tips, microtubules can buckle
during growth against a fixed point on the wall [Janson et al. 2003, 2004]. The absence of buckling
events in 6H::Mal3::mCherry assays is due to the fact that Mal3 promotes catastrophes in the
presence of compressive forces. In the presence of ATP, this effect is counteracted by the presence
of Tip1-Tea2 complexes at microtubule contact points with the wall. This is also reflected in the
distribution of microtubule-wall contact times (Figure 5B). While in 6H::Mal3::mCherry samples,
microtubule ends remained on average 34 s in contact with the wall, microtubules in 6H::eGFP::Tip1
samples with ATP showed an average contact time of 100 s. In the presence of ADP, an intermediate
average contact time of 52 s was observed. Instead, quantification of free microtubule catastrophe
times (without wall contact) in the same samples showed very little difference between microtubules
grown in the presence of Mal3 alone, or with the additional presence of Tip1 and Tea2 (Figure 5C).

Therefore, microtubules are specifically stabilized by Tip1 clusters that accumulate at microtubulewall contact points. The observed Tip1-mediated stabilization of microtubules at the wall is similar to
previous in vivo observations which showed that Tip1 S. pombe cells exhibit shorter microtubule
plus end contact times with the cell poles than wild type [Tran et al. 2001]. Also, a recent study linked
Tea2 with microtubule stabilization in contact with the cell ends [Meadows et al. 2018].

Tip1 cluster transfer promotes tethering of microtubule ends to the wall
We observed that microtubule ends sliding along the wall often stopped at specific points (Figure 5D).
This could be caused by: 1) an irregularity on the wall surface, 2) capturing of the microtubule end by
pre-bound 6H::eGFP::Tip1 at the wall, or 3) 6H::eGFP::Tip1 at the microtubule end tethering it to the
wall. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the fluorescence intensity at the wall
before, during, and after microtubule end contact. We then computed the fraction of pixel locations
where a microtubule end stopped as a function of the amount of protein deposited (fluorescence
intensity after the contact minus intensity before the contact, Figure 5E), and as a function of the
fluorescence intensity before the contact (Figure 5F).

The likelihood of microtubule stopping increased with the amount of protein being transferred
(Figure 5E). On the other hand, the likelihood of microtubule stopping showed nearly no dependence
on the amount of protein pre-bound at the wall (Figure 5F). These data indicate that Tip1 cluster
transfer correlates positively with microtubule stopping, suggesting that the transferred clusters can
form a physical link between the microtubule end and the wall, similar to the link observed earlier
between microtubule ends and crossing microtubules (Fig. 1). Such a link is apparently less likely to
be formed by proteins that are pre-bound at the wall than by proteins being delivered by the
microtubule. Consistent with this, pre-bound proteins did not appear to provide efficient receptors
for clusters delivered by the microtubules. Figure 5G shows that the likelihood of successful docking
events in fact decreased with the amount of protein pre-bound at the wall.

6H::eGFP::Tip1 clusters were furthermore occasionally observed to be transferred from the
microtubule lattice (far from the microtubule end), and to induce microtubule gliding along the wall
(Figure S4). These observations further support the idea that a physical link between the wall and the
microtubule can be formed by 6H::eGFP::Tip1 clusters. The observed tethering of microtubule ends
by 6H::eGFP::Tip1 clusters at the wall is again very reminiscent to in vivo observations. In S. pombe
cells, microtubule tethering has been suggested to occur via interactions between Tea1 and its
cortical receptor, as deletion of Tea1 leads to microtubule curling around the poles [Mata and Nurse
1997].

Microtubules in elongated microchambers can establish a mildly polarized
distribution of Tip1 clusters
Having established that growing microtubule ends can transfer Tip1 clusters to points of
microtubule-wall contact, we next tested whether microtubules aligned along the long axis of
elongated micro-chambers can establish a polarized Tip1 distribution. In these experiments,
microtubules were grown from free GMPCPP seeds inside functionalized rectangular microchambers
in the presence of 6H::eGFP::Tip1, Tea2 and Mal3 (and ATP). Micro-chambers were designed with
different aspect ratios and sizes ranging from 7 to 50 m. Microtubule dynamics and 6H::eGFP::Tip1
distributions at the wall were assessed in time-lapse movies over 10-20 minutes (see snapshots in
Figure 6A). Since the chambers were not sealed, microtubules could potentially diffuse in and out of
the chambers. However, by using methyl cellulose as a crowding agent, microtubules longer than ~5
m remained close to the bottom surface. In addition, the chamber walls were made with an
overhang, which prevented microtubules from sliding up the walls.

To assess the degree of alignment of the microtubules, we computed the microtubule preferred
orientation at each pixel position inside the chambers (Figure S5) and plotted the average preferred

angle as a function of aspect ratio for each chamber (Figure 6B). Microtubules in elongated chambers
(aspect ratio > 1) preferentially aligned between the longest axis (angle = 0) and the chamber
diagonal. Microtubule length distributions depended on the size of the chamber (Figure 6C). For
chambers with a diagonal shorter than ~20 m, mean microtubule length scaled with chamber size.
However, for longer chambers, microtubule length plateaued at a value of ~20 m. Microtubule
lengths in small chambers were likely limited due to catastrophes occurring when the two ends of
the microtubule reach the chamber ends. In long chambers, microtubule lengths were instead likely
limited by their intrinsic dynamic properties. Microtubules in these long chambers formed two
densely packed layers of parallel microtubules (smectic layers [Onsager 1949, Frankel et al. 1988]).
Surprisingly, the plus ends of these layers faced each other in the centre of the chamber. It is likely
that this configuration resulted from Tip1-Tea2 cluster-mediated sliding between antiparallel
microtubules. As a result of this microtubule configuration, microtubule plus end contacts with the
ends of the chamber were limited.

To quantify the degree of polarization of the Tip1 distributions on the chamber walls, we used a
‘Polarity Score’ introduced by Sokolowski 2013. This score corresponds to the ratio between the
amount of protein found at the poles divided by the amount of protein found at the sides. In our
assays protein densities were quantified by fluorescence intensity, and the chamber corners were
considered as polar regions (Figure 6C inset). Mild polarity (Polarity Score > 2) could be observed only
in chambers of sizes between 10 and 20 m and aspect ratios between 1.6 and 3 (Figure 6C and D,
blue colours). In these chambers, the average microtubule length was close to the chamber size
(Figure 6C), implying that microtubule plus ends could reach the chamber poles and undergo
catastrophes there. In longer chambers, where microtubules were shorter than the chamber size, a
Polarity Score around 1 was observed (red colours). These data suggest that mild polarity resulted
from microtubule-based transfers of clusters to the poles of the chambers.

Discussion
In this paper we set up an in vitro assay to establish a minimal mechanism for the microtubule-based
transfer of proteins to a cortical receptor. We showed that the local increase of protein density at
the microtubule end, as exhibited by EB proteins (6H::Mal3::mCherry in our experiments), is not
enough to facilitate transfer to a cortical receptor. Instead, motor-mediated clustering of a cargo
protein (6H::eGFP::Tip1 in our experiments) at the microtubule end is sufficient for efficient transfer
events. Reduction of protein clustering at the microtubule end by disrupting the transport activity of
the motor protein (Tea2) substantially reduced the chances of successful transfer (Figure 4C). Protein
transfer appeared to be mediated by simultaneous binding of Tip1 clusters to the microtubule end
and the wall, as frequent microtubule end tethering at the contact sites was observed. In addition,
although not necessary, microtubule catastrophes increased the amount of protein being transferred
to the wall. Finally, we showed that an elongated chamber shape can bias microtubule-based
transfers to the poles of chambers with sizes and aspect ratios comparable to S. pombe. Below we
discuss the relevance of our observations for the in vivo establishment of polarized protein
distributions.

The nature and role of motor-mediated clustering at microtubule ends
So far, we did not comment on the nature of the motor-mediated clusters at microtubule ends.
Interestingly, the three proteins used, Mal3, Tea2, and Tip1, are all constitutive dimers [Bieling et al.
2007, Sen et al. 2013]. Each of these proteins can directly interact with the other two as well as with
the microtubule ([Busch et al 2004a-b, Browning et al. 2005], Figure S1A). Therefore, dynamic
protein clusters may be held together by multiple low affinity bonds, templated by the microtubule.
In other systems, similar interactions have been found to form liquid-liquid phase separated protein
droplets under crowding conditions [Lin et al. 2015, Hernández-Vega et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2018].

In our system, the motor-activity may serve to drive proteins sufficiently close together to enhance
such effects. Since depositions at the wall often involve only a fraction of the total amount of protein
present at the microtubule end, it is unlikely that single rigid clusters are formed.

What may be the reason that clustering of polarity factors at growing microtubule ends facilitates
transfer to cortical receptors? An attractive explanation is that protein clusters that can
simultaneously interact with the microtubule end and the receptor, can transfer to the cortex
without the need of 3D diffusion. Such a multi-component cluster at the microtubule end may
furthermore interact with multiple cortical receptors at the same time. In this way, the cluster at the
microtubule end becomes a multivalent ligand which is expected to have a higher collective affinity
(avidity) for the cortex than individual polarity factors [Krishnamurthy, et al. 2006]. This would then
lead to preferential retention of pre-clustered proteins over individual proteins which arrive by
simple 3D diffusion. In this scenario, the role of motor proteins would thus not be to transport the
proteins all the way towards the receptor, but to facilitate the formation of a protein clusters at
microtubule ends that have enhanced affinity for the receptor proteins at the cortex.

In vivo, clustering of Tea1 at the cortex was previously shown to be important for cell end deposition
[Bicho et al. 2005, Dodgson et al. 2013]. In this case, cluster formation appeared to occur at the
plasma membrane as Tea1 gets internalized into a cortical network via interaction with Mod5 [Bicho
et al. 2005]. Given our findings, an alternative (or additional) hypothesis may be that Tea1 cluster
formation already occurs at the microtubule end, facilitating subsequent transfer to the cell poles.

Microtubule catastrophes and transfer events
In S. pombe cells, Tea1 transfers are typically observed after microtubule catastrophes, but it remains
unclear whether there is a strict cause-effect relation. In our in vitro setup, his-tagged eGFP::Tip1
transfers were enhanced by microtubule catastrophes, but catastrophes were not strictly required.

One can imagine that in a situation where a Tip1 cluster is simultaneously bound to the microtubule
end and the functionalized wall, a catastrophe facilitates its transfer by disappearance of the
microtubule interaction site. When the microtubule keeps sliding along the wall, binding to the
microtubule continues to compete with binding to the wall. In this case, transfer will be less likely,
but not impossible.

In our assays, the presence of Tip1 clusters at microtubule ends promoted prolonged microtubule
end contacts with the wall. These events included sliding and buckling events and were not always
associated with protein transfer. In vivo, such stabilization may help reduce microtubule
catastrophes at the cortical sides of S. pombe, allowing microtubule ends to reach the cell poles
[Drummond and Cross 2000, Minc et al. 2000, Tran et al. 2001]. Moreover, the longest microtubule
end contacts with the wall were observed in cases of protein transfer. It is therefore possible that
simultaneous binding of Tip1 clusters to the wall and the microtubule end leads to further
microtubule stabilization. Note that in vivo, such long contacts may be prevented by the competing
action of destabilizing motors at microtubule ends [Meadows et al. 2018].

Polarity establishment
In our assays, mildly polarized distributions were established in chambers of length and aspect ratios
similar to S. pombe. Clearly, the degree of polarization was much less than what is observed in vivo.
One likely reason for this difference is that microtubule transfers in our in vitro experiments were not
restricted to the poles of the chamber. In S. pombe, the polarized distribution of the receptor Mod5
provides additional positional information. As Mod5 presence at the sides of the cell is very low,
transfers there are less probable [Minc et al. 2000, Snaith and Sawin 2003]. We previously showed
that an artificial cortical protein that is able to diffuse can form a polarized distribution simply by
interactions with microtubule tips in S. pombe [Recouvreux et al. 2016]. Therefore, motile receptors,
with direct or indirect microtubule binding may facilitate restricting transfers to the poles of the cell.

Indeed, receptor redistribution combined with microtubule end capturing, has recently been shown
to induce polarity in silico [Foteinopoulos and Mulder 2017]. In vitro, this combination could be
tested by replacing rigid chamber walls with fluid interfaces in water-in-oil droplets with
functionalized lipids [Taberner et al. 2015].

Finally, in long micro-chambers (long axis larger than 30 m), microtubule plus ends showed a clear
bias towards the center of the chambers, leading to a failure of cortical polarization. In S. Pombe cells,
outward microtubule orientation is enforced by Ase1 and Klp2-dependent antiparallel bundle
formation [Carazo-Salas and Nurse 2006, Janson et al. 2007]. In the future it will be interesting to test
whether such anti-parallel bundles would allow to form polarized distributions in longer microchambers as well.

Materials and methods

Protein purification:
Kinesin Tea2 was expressed in E. coli and purified as in [Bieling et al. 2007].
The following proteins were purified as in [Maurer et al. 2011]:
6H::TEV::Mal3::mCherry sequence was obtained by deleting the GFP sequence in 6his::Mal3::GFP
(generous gift by Thomas Surrey, [Maurer et al. 2011]) and inserting the mCherry sequence
(generous gift from Milena Lanzova and Tom Shimizu) between the PacI and NotI restrictions sites.
To select for correct ligations, we further digested the final constructs with NdeI before
transformation.
Unlabeled 6H::TEV::Mal3 was obtained as in [Bieling et al. 2007]. The his-tag was removed by
cleavage overnight with AcTEV™ protease (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) at 4ºC according to
the provider’s protocol.

6H::TEV::eGFP::Tip1 was obtained as in [Bieling et al 2007] and the oligo duplex 5'tccgcgggtgagaatcttcagggcgcc-3' containing a TEV recognition site was added between the his-tag and
the eGFP (recognition sites SapI and NcoI).
Tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, USA). This includes unlabeled (T240),
Rhodamine labelled (TL590M), fluorescent HiLyte 488 (TL488M), and biotinylated (T333P) tubulin
from porcine brain.

Sample preparation:
Standard flow cell preparation: Glass slides were cleaned by sonication 10 min in water, Hellmanex®
(HellmaAnalytics, UK), water, and 70% ethanol sequentially. They were stored in 70% ethanol and
sonicated for 10 minutes in water before use.
Coverslips (No.1 24x24 mm x170 m, Menzel Glässer GmbH, Germany) were cleaned by base piranha
(NH4OH:H2O2 in 3:1 at 75˚C) for 10 min) and sonicated for 10 min in water.
Flow cells were made by placing two cut 5 mm wide stripes of parafilm on the glass slides separated
5 mm and placing on top the glass slides. Then the parafilm was melted by placing the sample several
seconds on a 100˚C hot plate and gently pressing a bit on it with tweezers.
Miro-chamber fabrication was done as in Taberner et al. 2013 (Figure S2A, see Supplementary
information).
Micro-chamber functionalization: The microfabricated glass slide was wetted with 0.4 mM Pll-gPEG/Tris-NTA solution ([Bhagawati et al. 2013], generous gift from Jacob Piehler, Universität
Osnabrück, Germany) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to deep UV (185 and 254 nm) with an Ozone
Cleaner (Uvotech Systems Corporation, Concord, CA, USA) for 10 min (Figure S2B). Then a flow cell
was made with TESA® tape (Tesa SE, Norderstedt, Germany) and the bottom surface was
functionalized again by incubating 0.4 mg·ml-1 of either PLL(20)-g[3.1]-PEG(2)/PEG(3.4)-biotin(17.5%)
or PLL(20)-g[3.1]–PEG(2) (SUSOS AG, Dübendorf, Switzerland) for 30 min. Biotinylated samples were

further incubated with 1 mg·ml-1 streptavidin for 10 min. All samples were finally passivated with 1.2
mg·ml-1 -casein.
GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds: Microtubule seeds were prepared by a polymerization depolymerization - polymerization cycle with GMPCPP in MRB80 (80 mM KPipes, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), pH 6.8). The first polymerization step was performed by
incubating a tubulin mix of biotinylated tubulin, fluorescently labelled and non-labelled tubulin in a
ratio 18:12:70 (total of 20 M tubulin) with 1 mM GMPCPP (NU-405 Jena BioScience, Jena, Germany)
at 37˚C for 30 min. For non-biotinylated seeds the biotinylated tubulin was simply exchanged by nonlabelled tubulin. The mix was then airfuged 5 min at 30 psi with an Airfugee® Air-driven
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, California, USA) and the pellet was re-suspended in 80%
of the initial volume and left on ice for 20 min to depolymerize the microtubules. Then, 1 mM
GMPCPP was added to the mix and left for 30 min at 37˚C to polymerize again. The seeds were then
airfuged again, re-suspended in MRB80 with 10% glycerol and stored at 80˚C. Thawed seeds were
kept at room temperature for up to a week.
Tip tracking assays: Flow cells were functionalized with 0.2mg·ml-1 PLL(20)-g[3.1]–PEG(2)/-PEG(3.4)–
biotin(17.5%) (SUSOS AG), with a subsequent incubation of 0.1 mg·ml-1 streptavidin, and further
passivation with 1.2 mg·ml-1 -casein. Biotinylated GMPCPP ‘seeds’ where incubated for 5 minutes.
Then, dynamic microtubules where grown from a mix containing 14.25 M tubulin, 0.75 M
rhodamine tubulin, 50 mM KCl, 0.6 mg·ml-1 -casein, 0.4 mg·ml-1 glucose oxidase, 50 mM catalase,
0.1% methylcellulose, 1 mM GTP, and 2 mM ATP in MRB80 and the variable stated concentrations of
6H::eGFP::Tip1, Mal3, and Tea2.
Tip tracking assays were recorded with a TIRF microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope)
equipped with an Apo TIRF 100x1.45 N.A. oil objective, a Perfect Focus System (PFS), a motorized
TIRF illuminator (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ, USA) and a QuantEM:512SC EMCCD camera
(Photometrics, Roper Scientific). Images were taken at 300 ms exposure for excitation lasers 491 nm

every 2 to 5 s with the same power for all samples. The temperature was kept at 26˚C with a
homemade objective heater device.
Protein transfer assays were performed in microfabricated glass microchambers with a 150 nM
6H::eGFP::Tip1, 10 nM Tea2 and 200 nM Mal3 and no imidazole. Transfers were recorded as the tip
tracking assays with TIRF with a frame rate of 2.0 s.
Free binding assay: Functionalized and passivated samples, were incubated with the stated protein
concentration of either 6H::Mal3::mCherry or 6H::eGFP::Tip1 for 50 min in a MRB80 solution
containing 0.1 % methyl cellulose, 0.4 mg·ml-1 glucose oxidase and catalase, 50 mM glucose, 0.6
mg·ml-1 -casein, 50 mM KCl and 10 nM imidazole. For the equilibrium binding curve fluorescence
microscopy images were taken 50 minutes after protein incubation. For the unbinding measurement,
the flow cell was flashed with MRB80 buffer with 50 mM KCl and 10 mM imidazole every 5 minutes.
For all measurements fluorescence microscopy snapshots were taken at separate locations along the
sample at the z position of highest protein fluorescence intensity at the wall. Imaging was done with
spinning disc fluorescence microscopy using a IX81F-ZDC2 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with
a spinning disc confocal head CSU-X1 (Yokogawa, Yokogawa, Japan), 100X oil immersion objectives,
and EmCCD camera iXon3 (Oxford instruments, Oxford, UK). Excitation lasers 488 and 561 nm
(Oxford instruments) were used. AOTF laser intensity of 22, exposure of 300 ms, and EM Gain 115
were used.
+Tip deposition assays: Each functionalized glass slide was used for three flow cells and imidazole
concentration was adjusted depending on the level of free his-tagged protein binding to the walls
from solution in the first two flow cells. Both, Mal3 and Tip1 assays were prepared in an MRB80
solution containing 14.25 M tubulin, 0.75 M labelled tubulin, 0.1 % methylcellulose, 0.4 mg·ml-1
glucose oxidase, 50 mM glucose, 0.6 mg·ml-1 -casein, 50mM KCL, and 2 mM of ATP or ADP when
needed. To reach nearly equilibrium state of free protein binding from solution samples were let at
imaging temperature for more than half an hour. Measurements of Mal3 and Tip1 depositions were

done with the spinning disc microscope mentioned above. Z-stacks of 2-3 focal planes separated 300
nm were taken every 2 s for Mal3 assays and 5 s for Tip1 assays for 25 min.
Polarity assessment assay: After functionalization of the walls with Pll-g-PEG/Tris-Ni(II)-NTA (0.2
mg·ml-1), the bottom surface was passivated with Pll-g-PEG (0.2 mg·ml-1 for 15 min), and -casein (1.2
mg·ml-1 for 10 min). Then microtubule ‘seeds’ were incubated in an MRB80 solution containing 0.1 %
methylcellulose and let sediment for 5 min. The 6H::eGFP::Tip1 deposition assay was prepared by
incubating 150 nM 6H::eGFP::Tip1, 100 nM Mal3 and 10 nM Tea2 in a MRB80 solution containing
14.25 M tubulin, 0.75 M Rhodamine tubulin, 1 mM GTP, 2 mM ATP, 0.1 % methylcellulose, 0.4

C. and D. Binding of 6H::Mal3::mCherry to micro-chambers with walls coated with Pll-g-PEG/trisNi(II)-NTA with 10 mM imidazole. C shows the relation between 6H::Mal3::mCherry protein
concentration and the measured bulk fluorescence signal (far from the wall). Error bars correspond
to standard deviation. D shows the fluorescence signal at the wall, as a function of the bulk signal.
Yellow to red dots correspond to individual measurements (mean value along 1 um of the wall), color
coded by protein concentration as in C. Black dots correspond to the binned data by the FreedmanDiaconis rule (bins of 67 a.u.) [Freedman and Diaconis 1981], except for the first bin which is smaller
(35 a.u.). Blue line corresponds to a fitted binding curve. The right side shows examples of
background subtracted images for individual measurements indicated in D.

B and C. Examples of different deliveries of his-tagged +Tips: 6H::Mal3::mCherry in B, 6H::eGFP::Tip1
in the presence of Tea2 and Mal3 with ATP (left) or ADP (right) in C. Top images show snapshots
before, during, and after microtubule tip contact with the wall. The wall location and the initial
contact site are indicated by a yellow dashed line and circle respectively. A yellow line has been
drawn parallel to the microtubule of interest as a guide to the eye. Arrows point at transfers at
subsequent contact sites. The snapshots are accompanied below by a kymograph along the
microtubule trajectory of the measured fluorescence intensity over time at the initial contact site.
Cartoon insets in the 6H::eGFP::Tip1 case indicate the sequence of events for the microtubule of
interest, consisting of an initial growth phase along the wall followed by a shrinking phase.

A. Fractions of events where the microtubule undergoes catastrophe at the site of first contact with
the wall (colors) versus events where the microtubule first slides along the wall (grey). Dashed areas
correspond to fractions of microtubules exhibiting clear buckling due to continued microtubule
growth while maintaining contact with a fixed site on the wall.
B. Distribution of microtubule end contact times with the wall, with exponential time axis.
C. Distribution of microtubule catastrophe times (growth times from seed nucleation to first
catastrophe) without wall contact.
D. Top panels show snapshots of a microtubule sliding along the wall with its end stopping at two
sites (yellow arrows). Dashed yellow line indicates the wall. Continuous yellow line indicates the
microtubule. The bottom panel shows a kymograph along the microtubule plus end trajectory
(yellow arrows in the first snapshot). This includes a straight segment from the microtubule seed
towards the wall, and a curved segment along the wall. Dashed lines indicate the time window in the
kymograph where the microtubule end stopped.
