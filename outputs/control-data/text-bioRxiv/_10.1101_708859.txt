Abstract
Honey and ghee is an important constituent of our diet. Honey contain about 200 components in its which
play an important role as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound healing and sunburn, etc.
Ghee has also many essential constituents such as phospholipids, PUFA, fat- soluble vitamins, etc. It is
mention in Charak Samhita that equal ratio of honey and ghee when taken in food become toxic to health.
This study was designed to explore the mechanism of toxicity through the biochemical and histological
parameter. For this study, 24 Charles foster rats were taken and divided into four groups (n=6) normal,
honey, ghee, and honey+ghee (1:1). After 60 days rats were sacrificed. Weight loss, Hair loss and red
patches on ear were found on honey+ghee fed rats. LFT, amadori test, AGE, UV, glucose, DPP-4 and
LPO were found significantly increased in honey+ghee group. SOD, Catalase, GSH, ABTS+, GLP-1,
GIP-1, ACB and HB were found significantly decreased in honey+ghee group. No changes were found in
RFT. H&E show normal morphology in kidney, intestine, and pancreas but mild inflammation was found
in liver tissue. We conclude that the equal mixture of honey and ghee shows toxic effect. Increased
formation of hydroxymethyl furfural, amadori product, DPP-4 activity and low incretins (GLP-1, GIP-1)
activity resulting high postprandial hyperglycemic response are collectively responsible for oxidative
stress-mediated toxicity of the mixture of honey and ghee in equal ratio.

Keywords: Honey, Ghee, Incompatible diet, Ayurveda, Oxidative stress, Postprandial hyperglycemia

1. Introduction
Honey and ghee are important constituents of the normal diet. Honey is a sweet, thick, yellowish liquid
made by honey bees mainly by sugar-rich nectar of the flower. It is a complex mixture having more than
200 substances(Escuredo, Míguez, Fernández-González, & Carmen Seijo, 2013). These are in consistence
because of variation in type of flower nectar which is used by the honey bee. Rather than this floral
source, some external factor is also responsible for the variability in honey composition such as
environmental and seasonal factor and processing time or way, time of storage and packing (Escuredo,
Dobre, Fernández-González, & Seijo, 2014). Honey is a supersaturated solution of sugars, of which

fructose (38%) and glucose (31%) is the important contributor. Some minor constituent are also present in
wide range which include phenolic acid and flavonoids (Andrade, Ferreres, & Amaral, 1997), certain
enzymes like glucose oxidase, catalase, ascorbic acid(Andrade et al., 1997), carotenoid like compound
(Tan, Wilkins, Holland, & McGhie, 1989), organic acids (Tan et al., 1989), maillard reaction product,
amino acids and protein (Tan et al., 1989), minerals, vitamins ions (Alqarni, Owayss, Mahmoud, &
Hannan, 2014). These phenolic compound and flavonoids present in honey is a rich source of antioxidant.
Honey is a sweet and flavorful natural product, which is consumed for its high nutritive value and for its
effects on human health, with antioxidant, bacteriostatic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties,
as well as wound and sunburn healing effects(Tan et al., 1989).

Ghee is similar to clarified butter fat which is produced by the heating butter to remove milk solids and
water. It is prepared from cow’s milk, buffalo milk’s and mixed milk’s. Ghee contain fats (99%),
vitamins, cholesterol, tochopherol, free fatty acids, carotene, lanosterol, ubiquinones, etc(Sserunjogi,
Abrahamsen, & Narvhus, 1998). Ghee is made from butter but the milk solids and impurities have been
removed, so most people who are lactose or casein intolerant have no issue with ghee.

Although both are rich nutrients but as per ayurvedic literature its regular use in equal quantity, in one
food, proof be toxic. (Charak Samhita, Charaka Sutra sthana, ½, Page-4, 2001). It is mention in Charak
Samhita that when we take this incompatible diet for a short time then it may not be dangerous for health
but when we take it regularly for longer time it become dangerous and may be cause types of diseases like
sterility, herpes, eye diseases, skin eruptions, ascites, fistula, leprosy, sprue, edema, fever, rhinitis, fetal
distress, and may even cause death (Charak Samhita, Charak Sutra sthana, 26/102, page-361, 2001).
However this believes has not been scientifically validated till date, though some research papers are
available (K. R. Anilakumar, Annapoorani, Murthy, & Bawa, 2011)(K. Anilakumar, Khanum, Murthy,
Bawa, & Annapoorani, 2010).
Here we have tried to explore the effect of this mixture on the physical appearance, anatomical and
physiological changes on GIT with special reference to oxidative stress, incretin secretion, structural
modification in blood component circulating protein and carbohydrates.

2. Method and materials:
2.1. Material
Honey was purchased from Patanjali. Ghee was purchased from Anik. All the biochemical kits were
purchased from Accurex Biomedical PVT LTD., Biosar, Thane. Lipase substrate, 4-nitrophenyl butyrate,
DPP-4 substrate gly-pro-p-nitroanilide, and ABTS+ tablet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GLP-1

and GIP-1 EIA kit was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, Riboflavin,
Methionine, Bradford reagent, Bromocresol green (BCG) reagent, Thiobarbutiric acid, Tricholoro acetic
acid were purchased from Hi-media Ltd, Calcutta.
2.2. Method
The experimental protocol was approved by an animal welfare ethic committee of the Institute of Medical
Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi (ethical committee letter # No Dean/2017/CAEC/720).
Healthy male Charles Foster strain rats (24) from an inbreed colony were randomly selected from the
central animal house of our institute (Institute of Medical Sciences). They were of average weight ranging
between 100–200 gm. The purpose of taking male rat is only to avoid the variation like different
metabolic rate of gender including sex hormones, lactation, pregnancy which is inherent in the female.
Rats were kept separately in propylene cage, fed standard diet and kept in hygiene conditions. The entire
animals were kept in 25

C with standard condition 12 h light/dark cycle. Before treatments start rats

were kept under the standard condition for 1 week with free access to standard chow and tap water for
acclimatization.
2.3. Treatment
After acclimatization, the rats were divided into four groups (n=6). Group-1 received the normal diet.
Group-2 received honey along with the normal diet. Group-3 received ghee along with the normal diet.
Group-4 received equal mixture of honey and ghee (Honey+ghee) along with the normal diet. For
finalization of dose, we have taken the basis of earlier publications where 2.5g/kg/day dose of honey have
been used(Sadeghi, Salehi, Kohanmoo, & Akhlaghi, 2019). As per Ayurvedic practice, the recommended
dose of honey is 48g/day and the recommended dose of ghee is 30ml/day for a healthy 70 kg men. Based
on these literatures we have selected the dose. Honey and ghee were given 0.7 ml/100gm body weight for
60 days. Equal ratio of honey and ghee were mixed and given to rats for 60 days. Just before given, the
mixture was vigorously vortex for emulsion the mixture and immediately given by the oral gavages.
These experiments were carried out for 60 days and weight, physical appearance, food intake was
recorded and blood was collected on every 15 days. Rats were sacrificed on 61 day by using ethyl ether
and Liver, kidney, intestine, pancreas organ were collected and washed with 1x PBS for various
biochemical and histological study.

Urea, BUN, and Creatinine test were done by using commercial kit available (Accurex Biomedical).
2.4.3.

Oxidative stress parameter

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured in term of inhibition of reduction of nitro blue
tetrazolium (NBT) in the presence of riboflavin as described (Beauchamp & Fridovich, 1971) with slight
modification (Nagwani & Tripathi, 2010). Catalase enzyme activity was measured by Aebi’s method by
monitoring H2O2 breakdown at 240 nm (Aebi, 1984). GSH was done according to described by Beutler
et.al,(Beutler, Duron, & Kelly, 1963) with slight modification (Tripathi, Shukla, Chaurasia, & Chaturvedi,
1996). ABTS.+ radical scavenging activity was determined according to described by Re.et.al. (Re et
al.,1999). Lipid peroxidation was measured by the thaiobarbutiric acid method (Matsunami, Sato, Sato,
Yukawa, & Sato, 2010).
2.4.4.

Protein modification parameter

2.4.4.1. Amadori test
The formation of Amadori products was assessed using the method of Johnson and Baker (Johnson &
Baker, 1987), with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). One hundred microliters of the sample per well were
transferred to a 96-well plate. One hundred microliters of NBT reagent (250 μM NBT in 0.1 M carbonate
buffer, pH 10.35) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Absorbance was
measured at 525 nm. An absorption coefficient of 12,640 cm−1 mol−1 for monoformazan was used
(Mironova, Niwa, Handzhiyski, Sredovska, & Ivanov, 2005).
2.4.4.2. UV Absorbance Spectroscopy
Absorption profiles of normal and treated plasma were recorded on Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 UV/VIS
spectrometer in 200 to 400 nm wavelength range using quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. Increase in
absorbance at 280 nm indicated the increased in hyperchromatocity due to protein oxidation.
2.4.4.3. Fluorescence Study for AGEs
AGE-specific fluorescence was recorded by exciting the samples at 390 nm and keeping the emission
range of 400 to 600 nm in PerkinElmer LS 45 fluorescence spectrometer (Jairajpuri, Fatima, &
Saleemuddin, 2007).
2.4.4.4. Albumin –cobalt binding assay

μL of serum was mixed with 25 μL cobalt chloride (CoCl2, 1 mg/mL) in a 96-well plate and
incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The 25 μL dithiothreitol (DTT, 1.5 mg/mL) was added,
followed by 2-minute incubation to allow the reaction with free cobalt salt. Finally, 150 μL saline was

Glucose level was estimated by using the Accurex Biomedical kit. GLP-1 and GIP-1 enzyme activity was
done by using EIA kit (Sigma-Aldrich). DPP-4(dipeptidyl peptidase) activity was done by adding 95 μl

GPPN (0.2 mM) as a substrate in the mixture of 65 μl Tris-HCl (50 mM, 7.5 pH) and 10 μl plasma.
Absorbance was taken immediately and after 20 min at 405 nm.

Enzyme unit (U/ml) = (((∆Abs/min (sample)- ∆Abs/min(blank))* reaction volume*dilution factor)/molar
extinction coefficient * path length*sample volume

2.4.6.

Triglycerides and Lipase activity in plasma

Triglycerides level was estimated by Accurex Biomedical kit. Lipase activity was done according to
Winkler and Stuckmann (Winkler & Stuckmann, 1979). Briefly, the reaction mixture was prepared by
mixing one volume of a solution containing 10mM of PNPB into isopropanol with 18 part of the solution
of phosphate buffer 100mM, pH-7, and 7.0% ±0.5% w/v triton x100. Ten µl of enzyme was added in
appropriate dilution and 190 µl of the reaction mixture was placed in ELISA plate and read absorbance at
415nm for 10min and time interval 30s at 30 C.
Enzyme unit (U/ml) = (((∆Abs/min (sample) -

∆Abs/min

(blank))* reaction volume*dilution

factor)/molar extinction coefficient * sample volume

2.5. Histology study
H& E staining was done in formalin-fixed liver, kidney, pancreas and intestine (jejunum) tissue followed
by rehydration, dehydration, block preparation, slide preparation, staining and mounting described in the
early procedure (Suvarna, Layton, & Bancroft, n.d.). Image was examined under a microscope (Eclipse
50i; Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan) encumbered with imaging software (NIS Elements Basic Research;
Nikon).

2.6. Statistical study
Statistical analysis was carried out using one way ANOVA test followed by Post Hoc analysis with
Tukey’s test by using SPSS software. All the result were expressed in mean±SD. The statistical
significant difference was considered as p-value less than or equal to 0.05.

found to decrease in the honey+ghee group. On 60 day weight was -0.78 % decreased in Honey+Ghee
group rats comparison to 1st day (Table: 1). We found normal skin in all 3 groups until 60 days. But in
equal ratio of honey and ghee fed rats (honey+ghee) we found the hair loss on 60 day (Figure: 1). We also
found the red patches on the ear on honey+ghee group rats on 60 days but there were no any red patches
found on normal, honey and ghee group rats (Figure: 2). The result of physical appearance on different
days was shown in Table: 2.

4. Discussion
This present study has been focused on to know the reason behind an equal mixture of honey and ghee
which is reported to be toxic in long used. In this study, weight of rats, treated with equal mixture of
honey and ghee was significantly decreased in comparison to other groups. These rats also showed hair
loss and skin patches. Such effects have been reported in patients going under chemotherapy, immune
check point inhibitor, program protein inhibitor (PD1) at the latter stage of treatment even after
discontinuing the medicine. In these patients the symptoms of Alopecia (hair loss), skin patches,
dermatitis eczema are observed(Sharma et al., 2018). The genes like Tnfrs19, Ercc2, Lama5, Ctsl, Per1
are shown to be involved in etiology of skin disorders, these genes regulate various biological process
involved in hair follicle development, hair follicle maturation, hair follicle morphogenesis and regulation
of hair cycle(Lim, Kim, Lim, & Kim, 2019). Thus our observations showing the toxicity of honey and
ghee are supported by other toxins reported here. The biochemical mechanism behind these toxicity could

be associated with oxidative stress as it has been reported in case of hair loss and alopecia (Prie et al.,
2015).
Literature showed that the AGEs is responsible for the glycation of many extracellular membrane protein
like collage, elastin (Lim et al., 2019). Then the glycated extracellular protein is no longer responsible for
the tightness of the skin, so the skin becomes aged and loses. This looseness of skin is responsible for the
loss of hair and weight as well. This could be possible caused behind the hair loss and weight loss in rats
of the honey+ghee group in our experiments.
In our study, we found a decreased level of SOD, catalase, GSH, % inhibition of ABTS and increased
level of LPO. It is known that honey is rich in phenolic compound, flavanoids, vitamins and proteins
which give honey antioxidant properties. As well as ghee also contain some vitamins which give
antioxidative properties to ghee. But when we mix honey and ghee in equal ratio there is some chemical
changes occur which is responsible for the formation of a carcinogenic compound hydroxyl methyl
furfural which may produce the deleterious effect(K. Anilakumar et al., 2010). These hydroxyl methyl
furfural is already present in honey in very little amount. The increased amount of this HMF production
makes honey also toxic. The furfural and hydroxyl methyl furfural is formed by the acid catalyzed
degradation of pentoses and hexoses respectively. The HMF formation is directly correlated with the
chemical characteristic, free acids content, pH, metal content, lactone content and total acidity. This
hydroxyl methyl furfural has found to be accountable for the induction and accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which is ultimately responsible for the cell component death in all organ including
mitochondria and vacuolar membrane and chromatin in yeast (Allen et al., 2010).

The primary oxygen radical species generated by mitochondria is superoxide anion which is converted to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by spontaneous dismutation or by superoxide dismutase (SOD), present both
within the mitochondria and in the cytosol. Hydrogen peroxide, in turn, is converted into water by
glutathione peroxidase or catalase; otherwise, in the presence of divalent cations such as iron, H2O2 can
undergo Fenton’s reaction to produce hydroxyl radical .OH. Due to increased production of ROS, the
activity of these enzymes like SOD, GSH, catalase are increased in the beginning to overcome the
oxidative stress indicating the adaptive step but when ROS productions increases continuously then these
antioxidative enzymes are unable to overcome oxidative stress and then level are decreases. One of the
study showed that the furfural and HMF create oxidative stress by acting thiol-reactive electrophiles(Kim
& Hahn, 2013), which relates to decreases GSH level.

In addition, this may block free 34SH of albumin and reducing its antioxidant properties. In this study, we
found an increased level of albumin but decreased level of albumin cobalt binding which was due to
oxidative stress. The free 34SH group of albumin is responsible for the binding of cobalt and other metal
ions for transportation in the blood but when SH group is oxidized then the capacity of albumin to cobalt
binding is decreased which is the sign of oxidative stress. The decrease in % inhibition of ABTS indicates
the decreased free radical scavenging activity and increased lipid peroxidation also indicates the oxidative
stress.

There is various type of oxidoreductase enzyme which carried out the reductive detoxification of furfural
and HMF(Liu & Moon, 2009)(Lewis Liu, Moon, Andersh, Slininger, & Weber, 2008)(Almeida et al.,
2008). During the reduction process, a lot of NADH and NADPH used as oxidoreductases cofactors. The
consumption of NADH and NADPH for the reduction of furfural and HMF is responsible for the
inhibition of different types of biosynthetic pathways which creates toxicity in the cell or tissues.

The amadori product formation occurs when the protein and glucose level is increase in blood which is
the basis of the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Here in the present study, we
found that the significant increase in amadori product formation and advanced glycation end product
formation. The formation of amadori product leads to the formation as well accumulation of reactive
carbonyl species through dehydration and rearrangement of amadori product. The major carbonyl
intermediates are glyoxal, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosaone((Skovsted, Christensen, Breinholt, &
Mortensen, 1998)(Baynes, 1991)). These compounds are responsible for intracellular oxidative stress
which cause cellular apoptosis (Okado et al., 1996). AGEs have long been measured as poisonous that
promote cell death and cause organ damage in man. AGEs is not responsible only for diabetic
complication as well as it contributes for the development of many others metabolic diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases and aging(Van Puyvelde, Mets, Njemini,
Beyer, & Bautmans, 2014).

We found in our study that the absorption of serum protein was notably increased in the group of equal
mixture of honey and ghee fed rats than the other groups. These changes in absorption could be due to the
formation of AGEs and oxidation of protein. Here we found decreased level of hemoglobin; this may be
due to the glycation of hemoglobin. Increased amadori product formation may be due to the glycation of
hemoglobin.

Honey is reported as a antidiabetic agent but when we take it in higher doses and for longer time the
fructose and glucose present in it may responsible for the augmentation in glucose level because fructose
is responsible for the creation of insulin resistant and obesity development(Matsushita, Ishii, Kijima, Jin,
Takasu, Kuroda, et al., 2012). Long term carbohydrate and fat rich diet feeding is linked to the
hyperglycemia condition. Increased glucose level is responsible for activation of DPP-4 enzyme. DPP-4
is an intestinal enzyme responsible for inactivation of GLP-1 because the sustained activity of GLP-1 is
not recommended for normal physiology. The normal life for GLP-1 is 3-4 minute thus the optimum
activity of DPP-4 is desired for a healthy person but increases in DPP-4 is injurious to health because it
damages the normal level of GLP-1 and GIP-1 also(Mentlein, Gallwitz, & Schmidt, 1993). Glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a remarkable antidiabetic gut hormone with combinatorial actions of stimulating
insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, increasing beta-cell mass, reducing the rate of gastric
emptying and inducing satiety. Gastric inhibitory polypeptide-1(GIP-1) inhibits gastric acid secretion and
stimulates insulin secretion in healthy volunteers.

3-deoxyglucosone is an amadori product.

Accumulation of 3-deoxyglucosone in intestinal tissue is responsible for the attenuation of GLP-1
secretion which causes insulinotropic effect in rats(Zhang et al., 2016). For the first time we are reporting
the changes in incretins hormones by using equal amount of honey and ghee which are not reported
earlier. Further study are required this linked to toxicity.
The increased formation of amadori product and advanced glycation end product leads to direct
inflammation in liver by various types of signaling pathways((Hyogo & Yamagishi, 2008)(Bijnen et al.,
2019)). HMF is also responsible for the mutation of important gene in liver(Matsushita, Ishii, Kijima, Jin,
Takasu, & Kuroda, 2012). The possible cause of liver inflammation in honey+ghee group rats could be
the formation of these HMF, amadori product, advanced glycation end product and oxidative stress. We
found that the liver function test enzymes serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases (SGOT), serum
glutamate pyruvate transaminases (SGPT), alkaline phosphatases(ALP) activity were significantly
increased in honey+ghee group in comparison to others group. These enzymes are the initial marker of
liver inflammation. The increased amount of protein, albumin in honey+ghee group in comparison to
other three groups also indicates the early sign of liver inflammation. H&E image of liver tissue showed
mild inflammation in portal track, neutrophil infiltration, some amount of glycogen accumulation in the
nucleus and some bile duct dilation which showed the initiation of inflammation in equal mixture of
honey and ghee treated rats.

In this study, we didn’t find any significant differences in blood urea, Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and
kidney histology between all groups, which indicates that the equal mixture of honey and ghee has no
effect on kidney till 60 day.

When we take carbohydrate-rich diet it is directly related to fatty acid synthesis and further triglycerides.
A fat rich diet contains many fats, triglycerides and cholesterol which are directly linked to the TG
accumulation in liver and blood also. Enzyme lipase is responsible to the degradation of these
triglycerides into fatty acids. We found the similar result in our experiments.

5. Conclusion
As discussed above, increased oxidative stress generation, decreased albumin cobalt binding, increased
amadori product formation and advance glycation end product formation, glucose and DPP-4
augmentations which relate to GLP-1 and GIP-1 attenuation, liver function test enzyme elevation, liver
tissue inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, bile duct dilation , glycogen accumulation, rise in TG and
lipases level are the evidence which can say that the formation of HMF, amadori product like 3deoxyglucosone, advance glycation end product could be the possible cause of toxicity of equal ratio of
honey and ghee. These may be responsible for weight and hair loss as well as the appearance of red
patches on ears.
