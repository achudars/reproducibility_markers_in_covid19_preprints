Abstract

12

In pancreatic islets the major cell-types are α, β and δ cells, secreting the hormones glucagon

13

(GCG), insulin (INS) and somatostatin (SST), respectively. The GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)

14

signalling system is expressed in human pancreatic islets. We have previously used single-cell

15

RT-PCR in combination with current recordings to correlate expression of single hormone

16

transcript with functional GABAA receptor (iGABAAR) properties in islets. Here we extended

17

these studies to islet cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donors that express mRNAs for

18

more than one hormone. We detected cells expressing double (α/β, α/δ, β/δ cell-types) and triple

19

(α/β/δ cell-type) hormone transcripts. The most common mixed-identity cell-type was the α/β

20

group where the cells could be grouped into β- and α-like subgroups. The β-like cells had low

21

GCG/INS expression ratio (< 0.6) and significantly higher frequency of single-channel iGABAAR

22

openings than the α-like cells where the GCG/INS expression ratio was high (> 1.2). The

23

difference in expression levels and single channel iGABAAR characteristics varied in the α/β/δ

24

cell-type. No correlation was observed between the cell-types identity with time in culture or cell

25

size. Clearly, multiple hormone transcripts can be expressed in islet cells whereas iGABAAR

26

functional properties appear α or β cell specific.

Introduction

32

The three major cell types of the endocrine pancreas are α, β and δ cells [1], producing glucagon,

33

insulin and somatostatin, respectively. When the physiological or pathological aspects of

34

pancreatic islets are studied, the function of α or β cells is traditionally in the focus. However,

35

emerging evidence indicates there are subgroups of pancreatic islet cells that previously were

36

overlooked [2, 3]. Among these are groups of cells expressing more than one hormone transcript

37

[4-6]. They may express hormone transcripts in different combinations such as GCG/INS,

38

INS/SST, GCG/SST or GCG/INS/SST and have different levels in individual cells. Such cells are

39

here termed “mixed-identity cells”. These cells may potentially represent different developmental

40

stages of the primary cell types [1, 7] but also may appear as a consequence of exposure to

41

different conditions, e.g. development of obesity or diabetes [4, 5].

42

Elements of the different neurotransmitter signalling machineries are found within human

43

pancreatic islets and one of them is the GABA signalling system [8-11]. This system has been

44

shown to modulate exocytosis [10], insulin and glucagon secretion [8, 9] and regulate β cell

45

replication [11, 12]. In addition, the GABAA receptors in β cells in intact human pancreatic islets

46

and their functional properties have been recently characterized in details [10]. Here we examined

47

the prominence of the single and multiple hormone transcript-expressing cells within intact

48

human pancreatic islets from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donors, examined patterns of

49

activity of iGABAARs in the mixed-identity cells and correlated the channel characteristics with

50

the hormones’ mRNA ratios. Together, the results identify the iGABAARs as a functional marker

51

of the physiological identity of the mixed-identity cell subtype.

Methods

54

Intact human islets of Langerhans. The Nordic Network for Clinical Islet Transplantation

55

generously provided human pancreatic islets. All procedures were approved by the regional ethics

56

committee in Uppsala (Sweden). Experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines

57

and regulations stipulated by appropriate Swedish and European legislation and informed consent

58

was obtained from donors or their relatives. The pancreata from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic

59

donors were treated by collagenase, and the islets were isolated by Biocoll gradient centrifugation

60

[13]. After that the islets were picked and cultured in CMRL 1066 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa

61

Mesa, CA, USA) with the addition of 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin,

62

0.25 μg/ml fungizone (GIBCO, BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 20 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Bayer

Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany), and 10 mM nicotinamide at 37 °C in a high-humidity

64

atmosphere containing 5 % CO2, vol/vol and used in the experiments from the second up to

65

fourteen day of culturing.

67

Electrophysiological recordings. The electrophysiological recordings from cells in the

68

superficial layers in intact islets were done in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration using the

69

blind approach. The intact islet was held by the wide-bore holding pipette, and the cell within the

70

islet was approached by the recording pipette from the opposite side. The composition of

71

extracellular solution (in mM): 137 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES and 20

72

glucose (pH 7.4 using NaOH). The high glucose concentration enhances the vesicular release

73

[14], and we used this phenomenon to stimulate GABA release from the β cells and thus

74

maximize the interstitial GABA concentration within the islets in our experiments in order to

75

facilitate the detection of the GABAA receptor activity. The intracellular solution consisted of

76

(mM): 135 CsCl, 30 CsOH, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES and 3 Mg-ATP (pH 7.2 with HCl).

77

Drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) or Ascent Scientific (Bristol,

78

UK). Recordings were done using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz, digitized on-line

79

at 10 kHz using an analog-to-digital converter and Clampex 10.5 (Molecular Devices, San Jose,

80

CA, USA) software. The access resistance was monitored and if it changed by more than 25%, the

81

recording was rejected.

Cytoplasm harvesting and single-cell RT-PCR. The cytosome harvesting procedure and single-

84

cell RT-PCR was previously described [10, 15]. Briefly, after completing the patch-clamp

85

experiment in the whole-cell configuration, the negative pressure was applied to the back of the

86

pipette and was relieved at the moment of the whole-cell configuration destroying, and then the

87

pipette content was locked at the atmospheric pressure. These manipulations allowed to collect

88

the cytosome from the cell the electrophysiological recording was done from. The pipette content

(5 μL) was expelled to a 200-μL RNase-free PCR tube. The collected cytosome was subjected to

90

the reverse transcription (RT) performed with Verso™ cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific

91

Waltham, MA, USA). The 20 μL of RT-reaction was exposed to 42 °C for 30 min and then

92

incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. PCR was accomplished according to a standard procedure [10]. The

93

primers for hormone transcripts are glucagon (forward: GCAACGTTCCCTTCAAGACAC,

97

primers for each hormone transcript was in the range between 99 and 100%. The relative

98

expression of pairs of hormone transcripts (mRNA) in individual mixed-identity cells was defined

99

as 2-(Ct[mRNA1]-Ct[mRNA2]). The melting curve of the PCR product was examined and/or PCR product

every individual cell recorded from. Hormone transcripts were detected in 174 cells from 45 non-

116

diabetic and 8 type 2 diabetic donors (HbA1c = 6.5 ± 0.16, mean ± S.E.M. (48 mmol/mol)). Table

117

1 shows the distribution of the cell-types identified. Characteristics of GABA-activated currents in

118

the α, β and δ single-hormone cell-types have been described [10]. Here we analysed the samples

119

containing multiple hormone transcript-expressing cells. For islets from non-diabetic and type 2

120

diabetic donors, single-hormone transcript was detected in 55% and 48% of the cells,

121

respectively, with 44% (non-diabetic) and 32% (type 2 diabetic donors) of the cells being insulin-

122

positive β cells (Fig. 1A). The remaining cells, 45% from non-diabetic and 52% from type 2

123

diabetic donors, were positive for more than one hormone transcript. The frequency of the

124

specific subtypes of mixed-identity cells i.e. α/β, β/δ, α/δ, α/β/δ, varied somewhat between the

125

non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donor islets, with the most notable difference being a decrease in

126

β/δ and an increase in mixed-identity cell subtypes expressing the GCG in type 2 diabetic donors

127

(Fig. 1A, Table 1). As the data from type 2 diabetic donors was limited and overlapped with the

128

data from the non-diabetic donors, we combined the results from the two groups when examining

129

single-channel properties and effects of days in culture on the channel properties (Fig. 2, 3).

In rodent islets the cell size normally correlates with the major cell types [15, 16] but the

134

situation is somewhat different for human islet cells where we did not detect any difference in cell

135

size among α, β and δ cells in intact islets [10]. However, it is possible that alterations in size

136

reflect transdifferentiation of one cell-type to another. We, therefore, examined if the mixed-

137

identity cells differed in size or if the time in culture influenced the cells’ diameter. Fig. 1B shows

138

that the different subtypes of cells were similar in size, as determined from cell membrane

139

capacitance measurements, and that the cell size did not correlate with the time in culture after

140

isolation of islets. We further examined if the relative expression level of a pair of hormone

141

transcripts in the mixed-identity cells correlated with the cells size but no correlation was found

142

between these two parameters (Fig. 1C).

143
144

iGABAA receptor-mediated currents in the different subtypes of the mixed-identity cells. We

145

further analysed the recordings of iGABAAR-mediated currents in mixed-identity cells in order to

146

examine if a particular subtype of the mixed-identity cells had a characteristic pattern of GABA-

147

activated currents. The single-channel iGABAAR currents were recorded in 87% of the mixed-

148

identity cells analysed with both electrophysiological and single-cell RT-PCR techniques. Fig. 2A

149

shows the distribution of the GCG/INS expression ratio for individual mixed-identity α/β cells as a

150

function of days in culture after the isolation of pancreas. No effect of time in culture on the

151

GCG/INS expression ratio was detected (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.22, P = 0.248, n =

152

30 cells).

153

Interestingly, recordings from α/β cells with higher relative INS expression (corresponding

154

to lower GCG/INS values) have higher frequency and larger amplitudes of iGABAAR-mediated

155

currents than those with higher GCG/INS expression ratio (see Fig. 2Aa, Ba and Ad, Bd). In

156

agreement with this observation, we found strong anticorrelation between relative GCG/INS

157

expression levels and single-channel iGABAAR opening frequency (Fig. 3A; Spearman

158

correlation coefficient r = –0.89, P < 0.0001, n = 18). Thus, the α-like α/β cells had relative

159

expression levels of 1.2 < GCG/INS < 550 and the β-like α/β cells of 0.002 < GCG/INS < 0.6 and

160

the difference in frequencies of the single-channel iGABAAR openings for α-like α/β cells, 0.054

161

± 0.011 Hz, and for β-like α/β cells, 7.30 ± 2.57 Hz, was significantly different (mean ± S.E.M,

162

nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.0001, n = 9 in the β-like group, n = 8 in the α-like group;

163

Fig. 3B). This is in line with the patterns of activities of iGABAARs in single hormone transcript7

164

expressing α and β cells [10] (Fig. 2G) and can be used to discriminate between α- and β-like α/β

165

cells. We also examined if the frequency of single-channel openings of iGABAARs altered with

166

duration of the islets in culture but no change was detected (Spearman correlation coefficient r = –

167

0.35, P = 0.15, n = 18).

168

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors are not expressed in human α cells [3, 17].

169

Accordingly, in a cell with high GCG/INS expression ratio, no potentiation of single-channel

170

iGABAAR activity with GLP-1 application was observed (Fig. 2Ad, Bd) consistent with an α cell-

171

like phenotype. Moreover, in a mixed-identity α/δ cell with high expression of GCG relative to

172

SST (Fig. 2C), we recorded low-frequency single-channel iGABAAR-mediated events with low

173

conductance that also corresponds to an α-like cell phenotype (Fig. 2D). In the mixed-identity

174

cells with higher INS/SST expression ratios (Fig. 2E), high activity level of the single-channel

175

events with the current amplitudes comparable to those obtained in single-transcript (INS only) β

176

cells was generally observed, and the currents were potentiated by GLP-1 application (Fig. 2Fg–

177

i). We also recorded currents through iGABAARs in mixed-identity α/β/δ cells. The most

178

prominent single-channel iGABAAR currents were recorded in cells with the highest INS

179

expression among all three hormone transcripts (Fig. 3Cb,c and Db,c). However, the difference in

180

hormone transcripts expression levels varied in the mixed-identity α/β/δ cells and the frequency of

181

the single-channel iGABAAR currents was relatively low in these cells (see Fig. 3Db,c and e.g.

182

Fig. 2Ba, Fi).

183
184

Discussion

185

In recent years, reports have emerged indicating that there are groups of pancreatic islet cells that

186

express more than one hormone transcript [2, 3, 7]. It is possible that these mixed-identity cells

187

have properties different from single hormone transcript-expressing cells. In the current study we

188

analyzed the proportions of single hormone transcript-expressing and mixed-identity cells in islets

189

from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic donors and further, explored the iGABAAR-mediated

190

currents peculiar to a specific mixed-identity cell subtype.

191

Studies of type 2 diabetes have shown a decrease in the β cell mass and a concomitant

192

augmentation in the number of α cells in islets from type 2 diabetic donors as compared to control

193

subjects [18, 19]. Our cytosome analysis corroborate these results, revealing a decreased

194

probability of identifying single-hormone INS-expressing β cells in islets from type 2 diabetic

195

donors compared to islets from non-diabetic subjects. In contrast, the probability of identifying

196

cells containing the GCG increased and, in particular, the percentage of single-hormone GCG-

197

expressing α cells increased in islets from type 2 diabetic donors. Whether this change is a cause

198

or a consequence of the disease remains to be determined. Interestingly, different subtypes of the

199

mixed-identity cells express hormone transcripts at variable levels, and several combinations

200

exist. Importantly, however, no systematic change in the GCG/INS expression level was observed

201

for the cells during the 10 days after isolation from the donors.

202

Apparently, the mixed-identity cells have distinct intracellular regulatory mechanisms

203

governing particular hormone transcript expression. These cells may also differ in iGABAAR

204

subunit composition and their expression levels that will be reflected in different patterns of

205

single-channel iGABAAR openings.

206

We have previously characterized the functional properties of iGABAAR in human α and β

207

cells [10]. Here, in mixed-identity α/β cells, we found that cells having higher GCG/INS

208

expression ratio correlated with no or low single-channel iGABAAR opening frequency and low-

209

amplitude single-channel events and no response to GLP-1 application. This pattern of activity is

210

very much similar to the behavior of iGABAARs in single-hormone GCG-expressing α cells [10].

211

On the other hand, mixed-identity α/β cells with lower GCG/INS expression ratio had activity

212

similar to single-hormone INS-expressing β cells [10] with higher frequency and larger

213

amplitudes of single-channel iGABAAR openings. In the majority of the mixed-identity β/δ cells

214

we found that the INS expression level was higher than that for somatostatin and the pattern of

215

activity of single-channel iGABAARs was similar to the activity pattern in β cells. Together, the

216

results identify the iGABAARs as a functional marker of the physiological identity of the mixed-

217

identity cell subtype.

218

The explanations for the existence of mixed-identity cells in the human pancreatic islets

219

may be many. The human islet is a plastic structure [1, 20, 21] and numerous factors [4, 5, 22],

220

including GABA [23, 24] may influence the signatures of the cells. The cell-type determination

221

has been proposed to take place during development [25] or alter due to dedifferentiation [22] or

222

intentional reprogramming [7]. Further studies are required to identify factors and conditions

223

regulating the cell-type identity [26].

224

The GABA signaling system is an integral part of the normal human pancreatic islet

225

physiology [8, 27]. If pancreatic islet GABA concentration changes out of the physiological

226

range, it may impair proper insulin and glucagon secretion, potentially alter cell fate [23, 24, 28]

227

and eventually contribute to pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, interstitial GABA has

228

also been proposed to inhibit cytotoxic immune cells entering the islets and is of potential

229

importance for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [28-30].

230

In conclusion, our results show that iGABAAR activity predicts the phenotype of the

231

mixed-identity cells. Better understanding of the GABA signalling system effects in the human

232

pancreatic islets will be valuable and may assist in unravelling the relationship between the α and

233

the β cells plus, potentially, how the intrinsic potential for regeneration of the β cell mass comes

234

about.

405

Bb and Fi have vertical scale bar 10 pA. Recordings d, g–i were done in the presence of 10 nM

406

GABA first (black traces), and then 50 pM GLP-1 was added to the extracellular solution in order

407

to examine the potentiation of iGABAARs via the activation of GLP-1 receptor (blue traces). The
