ABSTRACT

17

Antimicrobial resistance is a globally recognized public health risk. High incidence of

18

antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in solid organic waste

19

necessitates the development of effective treatment strategies. The objective of this study

20

was to assess ARG diversity and abundance as well as the relationship between resistome

21

and microbial community structure during anaerobic co-digestion (AD) of food waste,

22

paper and cardboard. A lab-scale solid-state AD system consisting of six sequentially fed

23

leach beds (each with a solids retention time of 42 days) and an upflow anaerobic sludge

24

blanket (UASB) reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions continuously for 88

25

weeks to successfully treat municipal organic waste and produce biogas. A total of ten

26

samples from digester feed and digestion products were collected for microbial

27

community analysis including SSU rRNA gene sequencing, total community

28

metagenome sequencing and quantitative PCR. Taxonomic analyses revealed that AD

29

changed the taxonomic profile of the microbial community: digester feed was dominated

30

by bacterial and eukaryotic taxa while anaerobic digestate possessed a large proportion of

31

archaea mainly belonging to the methanogenic genus Methanosaeta. ARGs were

32

identified in all samples with significantly higher richness and relative abundance per 16S

33

rRNA gene in digester feed compared to digestion products. Multidrug resistance was the

34

most abundant ARG type. AD was not able to completely remove ARGs as shown by

35

ARGs detected in digestion products. Using metagenomic assembly and binning we

36

detected potential bacterial hosts of ARGs in digester feed, that included Erwinia,

37

Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus.

IMPORTANCE

40

Solid organic waste is a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (1) and

41

effective treatment strategies are urgently required to limit the spread of antimicrobial

42

resistance. Here we studied the antibiotic resistome and microbial community structure

43

within an anaerobic digester treating a mixture of food waste, paper and cardboard. We

44

observed a significant shift in microbial community composition and a reduction in ARG

45

diversity and abundance after 6 weeks of digestion. We identified the host organisms of

46

some of the ARGs including potentially pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria,

47

and we detected mobile genetic elements required for horizontal gene transfer. Our

48

results indicate that the process of sequential solid-state anaerobic digestion of food

49

waste, paper and cardboard tested herein provides a significant reduction in the relative

50

abundance of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene.

INTRODUCTION

53

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a widely recognized public health risk. The extensive

54

use of antimicrobial compounds since World War II has triggered the rapid spread and

55

evolution of AMR mechanisms to such an extent that AMR is considered one of today’s

56

top medical concerns globally (2). Currently, 700 000 deaths are attributed to resistant

57

microbial infections annually, which is projected to increase to 10 million deaths by 2050

58

resulting in the loss of 100 trillion USD of economic output (3). In light of this gloomy

59

prospect, a One-Health approach has been proposed to tackle AMR by recognizing the

60

connections between human and animal health and the environment (4).

61

Although the vast majority of antimicrobial research is focusing on the clinical

62

setting, the natural environment has gained attention as a possible reservoir and dispersal

63

route of antimicrobial resistance determinants, including antibiotic resistant bacteria and

64

antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (5, 6). Various natural ecosystems, such as ancient

65

permafrost sediments (7), pristine soil (8, 9), oceanic (10) and freshwater bodies (11)

66

have been shown to possess a diversity of ARGs collectively defined as the resistome.

67

However, higher concentrations of resistance determinants have been observed in

68

environments with anthropogenic impact where selective pressure for ARGs is present,

69

such as wastewater treatment plants, animal husbandry facilities, aquaculture farms and

70

pharmaceutical manufacturing (12).

71

Various types of solid organic waste may also serve as potential sources of

72

antibiotic resistant bacteria and ARGs (1). In addition to the extensively studied

73

resistomes of sewage sludge and animal manure, the organic fraction of municipal solid

74

waste (MSW) may also contribute to the dissemination of AMR. Global production of

75

MSW is estimated at around 2 billion tons per year, of which 34–53% is organic

76

biodegradable waste including food waste as the primary component (13). Paper waste

77

forms 17% of MSW globally, including different lignocellulosic fibres such as cardboard,

78

newspaper, magazines, wrapping paper, shredded paper, boxes, bags and beverage cups

79

(14).

80

Several studies have highlighted the role of the food chain in AMR as a direct link

81

to human health (15, 16) and identified antibiotic resistant pathogens in various food

82

products such as meat (17–19), fruit and vegetables (20–23), poultry (24, 25), fish (26,

83

27) and dairy (28). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ARGs are also present in

84

food waste: Lee et al. (29) detected a variety of ARGs in the wastewater from food waste

85

recycling in Korea, although the abundance of ARGs remained below that of manure and

86

sewage sludge.

87

To mitigate the harmful environmental impacts of organic solid waste, anaerobic

88

digestion (AD) is widely implemented as a treatment strategy, providing waste

89

stabilization as well as the production of renewable energy (30). AD changes the

90

structure of the microbial community of the substrates which in turn affects the resistome

91

present in digestion products. Although it is generally accepted that ARG abundance is

92

reduced overall during AD, enrichment of some ARGs and rebound-effects have been

93

reported in several studies (summarized by Youngquist et al. (31)). For example, Pu et al.

94

(32) studied the impact of applying pig manure to fields and found that AD reduced the

95

relative abundance of Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin (MLS) and tetracycline

96

resistance genes, while resistance genes for sulfa, aminoglycoside, florfenicol,

97

amphenicol and chloramphenicol were enriched. Similarly, the effect of aerobic

98

composting of organic waste remains contradictory: while some evidence suggests

99

composting can reduce the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria and ARGs, other

100
101

studies have shown increased abundance and diversity of ARGs (31).
Recently, there has been growing interest in AD of food waste due to its high

102

energetic value (13). However, limited information is available on the effect of AD on the

103

microbial community and resistome in food waste. Zhang et al. (33) identified 11 ARGs

104

and class 1 integron integrase gene intI1 in digested food waste: while tetA, tetB, tetX,

105

sul1, cmlA, floR and intI1 were significantly reduced by AD, enrichment of tetM, tetW,

106

tetQ and tetO was recorded. Similarly, another study detected both increase and reduction

107

of specific ARGs in the co-digestion of sewage sludge and food waste following

108

microwave pretreatment (34). Thus, the effect of AD on the food waste resistome and the

109

associated microbial community is still unclear.

110

In addition to quantification of individual ARGs, detecting potential host

111

organisms of these genes is important to evaluate the risk to human health. Several

112

studies have used correlation and network analysis to detect relationships between

113

individual ARGs and bacterial genera (34–37). High mobility of ARGs due to horizontal

114

gene transfer (HGT) is responsible for the spread of AMR between different bacteria

115

including human pathogens as well as non-pathogenic environmental bacteria which

116

often serve as reservoirs of ARGs (38).

117

The objective of this study was to measure ARG abundance and resistome

118

diversity before and after anaerobic co-digestion of food waste, paper and cardboard.

119

Samples were collected from a lab-scale solid-state AD system that exhibited stable

120

methane production and substrate destruction rates (39, 40). By simultaneously analyzing

121

microbial community shifts, we attempted to assign ARGs to specific host organisms.

122

Using SSU rRNA gene sequencing, total community metagenome sequencing and

123

targeted quantitative PCR we were able to quantify changes in the diversity and size of

124

the resistome before and after digestion together with changes in the taxonomic profile of

125

the microbial community. We were further able to identify potential host organisms of

126

ARGs by using metagenomic assembly and binning methods.

127
128

RESULTS

129

A total of 10 samples were collected from a lab-scale solid-state anaerobic digestion

130

system described in detail by a recent PhD thesis (39). The ten samples included three

131

samples of raw food waste (FW1, FW2, FW3) collected from local residential green bin

132

program, three samples of the mixture of food waste and lignocellulosic fibres that

133

constituted the leach bed feed (LBF1, LBF2, LBF3), three samples of 6 week old

134

digestate (DG74, DG76, DG78) and one sample of the microbial granules from the

135

upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) treating leachate from the leach beds.

136

DNA was extracted from each sample in order to analyze the microbial community

137

composition and ARGs diversity, abundance, genomic location and host organisms using

138

a multi-pronged approach combining metagenome sequence analyses, taxonomic

139

profiling and quantitative PCR (Fig. 1).

140

Microbial community. Microbial community structure was analyzed by small

141

subunit (SSU) rRNA gene-fragment sequencing (method 2 in Fig. 1) capturing bacterial,

142

archaeal and eukaryotic diversity (Tables S1 and S2 in supplemental material). A clear

143

distinction in the communities of digester feed and digestion products was detected: food

144

waste and leach bed feed microbial communities were dominated by bacterial and

145

eukaryotic taxa while anaerobic digestate and microbial community of granules from the

146

UASB reactor possessed a large proportion of archaeal phylotypes mainly belonging to

147

the methanogenic genus Methanosaeta (Fig. 2). The most abundant bacterial OTUs in

148

digester feed belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae, including the genera

149

Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Kluyvera, Pantoea, Serratia and Lelliottia.

150

Additionally, representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were detected in FW2, including

151

the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, probably indicating fermentation processes

152

occurring in the respective food waste. In addition to bacterial sequences, fungal and

153

plant material was detected in digester feed (FW, LBF), but not in digestion products

154

(DG) or the UASB. Across all samples, 36–62% of OTUs were detected at low relative

155

abundances comprising less than 1% of the total community. A comparison of genus

156

level taxonomic composition detected from SSU rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis

157

using QIIME (tool 2.1 in Fig. 1) to that derived from total community metagenome

158

sequencing analysis using Kaiju (tool 3.3 in Fig. 1) or metaxa2 (tool 3.4 in Fig. 1)

159

showed relatively good agreement between the three different annotation tools used in

160

this study (Fig. S1 in supplemental material).

161

ARG diversity and abundance. Total community metagenome sequencing data

162

from seven samples (Table S3 in supplemental material) was analyzed using the ARGs

163

Online Analysis Pipeline (ARGs-OAP) (41) (tool 3.5 in Fig. 1) to characterize the

164

distribution and diversity of ARGs before and after anaerobic digestion. The richness of

165

ARGs, measured as the number of distinct ARGs identified in one sample type, was

166

highest in digester feed with 330 and 336 different ARGs detected in FW and LBF

167

samples, respectively. The richness of ARGs in digestion products remained two times

168

lower with 115 different ARGs detected in DG and UASB samples indicating reduced

169

diversity of ARGs after anaerobic digestion. Twenty three ARGs were found to be unique

170

to digestion products belonging to aminoglycoside (aac(3)-I, ant(9)-I), beta-lactam

171

(OXA-10, OXA-205, OXA-251, OXA-34, OXA-46, OXA-75), chloramphenicol (catQ),

172

MLS (ereB, lnuB, mphA, carA), sulfonamide (sul3), tetracycline (tet44, tetT),

173

trimethoprim (dfrA5) and vancomycin (vanA, vanG, vanH, vanN, vanU, vanX) type.

174

In addition to richness, the relative abundance of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene was

175

determined from total community metagenome sequencing data (Table S4 in

176

supplemental material). Relative abundances of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene were

177

significantly higher in digester feed than in digestion products, indicating the ability of

178

anaerobic digestion to reduce ARGs (Fig. 3). Total relative abundances of ARGs per 16S

179

rRNA gene in food waste samples FW1 (0.78 ARG/16S rRNA) and FW2 (0.40 ARG/16S

180

rRNA) were similar to the respective values in the mixtures of food waste with

181

lignocellulosic fibres (LBF1 0.84 ARG/16S rRNA, LBF2 0.44 ARG/16S rRNA),

182

indicating the role of food waste as the primary source of ARGs in leach bed feed. Most

183

of the ARGs identified in digester feed conferred multidrug resistance (Fig. 3A).

184

Additionally, many potential ARGs with unclassified resistance type were detected. The

185

highest relative abundance value for an individual gene (Fig. 3B) was recorded for

186

AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux complex subunit acrB reaching 0.05 copies/16S rRNA

187

gene in samples FW1 and LBF1. Other highly abundant genes in digester feed included

188

subunits of multidrug resistance complexes (acrA, mdtB, mdtC, tolC), several regulatory

189

protein genes associated with AMR (cpxR, arlR) and bacitracin resistance gene bacA.

190

Relative abundances of individual ARGs in digestion products remained below 0.01

191

copies/16S rRNA in all cases. Similarly to digester feed, the highest value for an

192

individual gene in digestion products was recorded for acrB with 0.007 copies/16S rRNA

193

in UASB.

194

A high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) array was also used as an alternative

195

approach to quantify 315 ARGs (tool 4.1 in Fig. 1) and 57 mobile genetic elements

196

(MGEs) (tool 4.2 in Fig.1) in food waste and digestate DNA samples (Table S5 in

197

supplemental material). In agreement with the results from the metagenomic data, the

198

diversity of ARGs and MGEs was higher in food waste with 161 different genes detected,

199

while only 32 different genes were detected in digestate (Fig. 4). Among these, 10 ARGs

200

were found only in digestate samples and not in food waste. Notably, MLS resistance

201

genes mphA and lnuB, phenicol resistance gene catQ and tetracycline resistance gene

202

tet44 were found to be unique to digestate by both methods.

203

Although the richness of ARGs and MGEs was higher in food waste samples,

204

absolute abundances of individual genes normalized per sample dry weight reached

205

higher levels in digestates (Fig. 4) according to HT-qPCR array results calculated based

206

on abundance of 16S rRNA gene per gram of dry sample (tool 1.1 in Fig. 1, Fig. S2 in

207

supplemental material). Most prevalent ARG types in final digestates (Fig. 4B) included

208

MLS (genes ere(A), erm(F), erm(O), lnu(F), lnuB, mef(B), mphA), aminoglycoside

209

(genes aac3-Via, aadE, aph4ib) and tetracycline (genes tet44, tetD, tetM, tetW) with

210

absolute abundances of individual genes ranging between 107 and 108 copies/g-dw.

211

Absolute abundances of ARGs in food waste samples ranged between 104 and 107

212

copies/g-dw. MGEs followed a similar pattern to ARGs with more genes detected in food

213

waste but higher absolute abundances of individual genes per gram of sample dry weight

214

detected in digestates (Fig. 4C).

215

Genomic context of ARGs. In order to study the genomic context of ARGs, total

216

community metagenome sequencing reads were assembled into longer contigs using

217

MEGAHIT (tool 3.6 in Fig. 1) and metaSPAdes (tool 3.7 in Fig. 1) assemblers (Table S6

218

in supplemental material), followed by detection of ARGs on contigs (tool 3.10 in Fig. 1)

219

and identification of plasmid sequences carrying ARGs (tool 3.8 in Fig. 1) (Table S7 in

220

supplemental material).

221

On average, 0.10% of all assembled contigs carried ARGs in digester feed, while

222

only 0.003% of contigs identified in digestion products included ARGs (Table S8 in

223

supplemental material). More than 90% of ARG-carrying contigs in all samples included

224

only one ARG, however, contigs with multiple ARGs were also observed with up to five

225

ARGs per contig (Table S8 in supplemental material) detected in digester feed. Contigs

226

with multiple ARGs typically carried subunits of multidrug efflux systems such as

227

MdtABC-TolC coupled with two-component regulatory systems for efflux proteins (such

228

as BaeSR).

229

Identification of plasmids from ARG-carrying contigs revealed that on average

230

32% of ARGs detected in digestion substrates were located on plasmids (Table 1)

231

indicating their potential for HGT. The distribution of plasmid ARGs resembled the

232

pattern of ARGs identified from short sequencing reads with multidrug resistance genes

233

being the most abundant type in digestion substrates (Fig. S3 in supplemental material).

234

Proportion of plasmid ARGs in digestion products varied between 33.3% and 60.0%,

235

although the number of detected ARGs remained low (11 ARGs on plasmids in DG74,

236

24 ARGs in DG78, and 20 ARGs in UASB, respectively; Table 1). ARGs identified as

237

chromosomal accounted for 8.3 to 28.9% of ARGs across all samples, remaining below

238

the respective values for plasmid ARGs in all cases (Table 1).

239

Bacterial hosts of ARGs. MEGAHIT-assembled contigs that were not identified

240

as plasmids were further annotated for their taxonomic affiliation (tool 3.9 in Fig. 1).

241

Figure 5 depicts the frequency of specific host-ARG pairs identified for most abundant

242

bacterial genera in digester feed. Gammaproteobacterial genera Stenotrophomonas and

243

Acinetobacter clustered separately and were characterized by species-specific multidrug

244

resistance efflux complexes and the corresponding regulatory systems.

245

Stenotrophomonas carried subunits for SmeABC and SmeDEF efflux pumps as well as

246

the SmeRS regulatory system formerly identified in S. maltophilia (42, 43).

247

Acinetobacter carried subunits for AdeIJK and AdeFGH multidrug efflux pumps together

248

with multidrug resistance genes adeB, abeM, transcriptional activator mexT and

249

aminoglycoside resistance gene APH(3’)-Ia. In addition to Stenotrophomonas and

250

Acinetobacter, other identified ARG host genera in the digester feed included

251

Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Raoultella, Rahnella, Rouxiella, Pantoea,

252

Serratia, Erwinia, Citrobacter, Leclercia and Lelliottia that formed a network by sharing

253

connections with ARGs belonging mainly to multidrug resistance type. For example,

254

Pseudomonas was characterized by the highest number of ARG connections carrying

255

subunits of the MexEF-OprN efflux system; similarly, Enterobacter and Klebsiella

256

shared connections to subunits of MdtABC-TolC and AcrAB-TolC efflux systems. In

257

addition to multidrug resistance genes, genes conferring resistance to polymyxin were

258

related to multiple host genera in digester feed: rosA and rosB were both found in

259

Serratia, Rahnella and Rouxiella, arnA was found in Citrobacter and Pseudomonas,

260

pmrE in Enterobacter and Klebsiella, and pmrA in Raoultella.

261

Only a limited number of ARGs were detected and their host organisms

262

taxonomically determined in digestion products (Table 2). Bacterial hosts of ARGs in

263

digestion products included genera formerly identified in anaerobic digesters associated

264

with microbial degradation processes, such as Fermentimonas, and several sulphate-

265

reducing genera (Desulfobacca, Desulfococcus). More importantly, Burkholderia and

266

Arcobacter (both carrying isoniazid resistance gene katG), Streptococcus (carrying MLS

267

resistance gene mefA) and Escherichia (carrying MLS resistance gene mefB) were

268

identified as ARG host organisms of clinical relevance.

269

To further investigate the potential hosts of ARGs, the assembled contigs were

270

binned into 201 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) (tools 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 in

271

Fig. 1) with >75% completeness and <25% redundancy (Table S9, Fig. S4 in

272

supplemental material). Notably, MAGs found in digestion products (DG74, DG78,

273

UASB) accounted for 75% of all assembled MAGs and did not contain ARGs. On the

274

contrary, four MAGs containing ARGs were identified in digester feed (FW1, FW2,

275

LBF1, LBF2) (Table 3). Interestingly, a genome belonging to the plant pathogenic genus

Erwinia carried 19 ARGs conferring resistance to aminoglycoside, bacitracin, polymyxin,

277

quinolone and sulfonamide antibiotics while also harboring several genes for multidrug

278

resistance. Lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus that are generally

279

associated with probiotic features displayed resistance for MLS (Lactococcus lactis genes

(Lactobacillus gene dfrE). Additionally, a MAG belonging to the family

Bifidobacteriaceae carried the inner membrane transporter gene mdsB of multidrug and

metal efflux complex MdsABC. The four ARG-containing MAGs that were highly

284

abundant in digester feed were not identified in digestion products (Fig. S4 in

DISCUSSION

288

AD is widely used for treatment of solid organic waste providing waste stabilization as

289

well as energy (biogas) production. More recently, the potential of AD to reduce

290

antibiotic resistant bacteria and ARGs has been investigated with mixed results (31). In

291

this study, we examined the effect of co-digestion of food waste, paper and cardboard on

292

microbial community composition and resistome using SSU rRNA gene sequencing, total

293

community metagenome sequencing and quantitative PCR. The studied AD system that

294

was a lab-scale solid-state leach bed reactor with leachate recycle via a UASB reactor

295

that has been thoroughly described elsewhere (40). This AD system performed very well

296

over 1.5 years of operation, also maintaining a stable microbial community (44).

297

Microbial community composition of digester feed and digestion products.

298

Microbial community composition has been suggested as one of the main drivers of

299

ARGs in anaerobic digesters (35, 45). The microbial communities of the digester feed – a

300

mix of food waste and lignocellulosic fibres – revealed aerobes and facultative aerobes

301

that were distinct from the strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea inside the digester. The

302

FW alone and the blended LBF samples had very similar taxonomic profiles indicating

303

that food waste was the main contributor to the microbial community in the digester feed,

304

consisting mainly of microorganisms native to food products or of the microbes that

305

colonized food waste during collection and storage prior to AD.

306

Previous studies on food microbiomes have highlighted the role of fermentative

307

organisms such as lactic acid bacteria in fermentation processes (46). Several OTUs

308

belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc were identified in the food waste

309

used in this study, indicating the presence of fermented food products (e.g. cheese,

310

sourdough) or the start of degradation processes during the collection, storage and pre-

311

processing of food waste prior to AD. Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc may also indicate

312

spoilage of meat as previously shown for vacuum-packed pork (47), beef (48–50),

313

minced meat (51) and sausages (52, 53). Besides lactic acid bacteria, several genera from

314

the family Enterobacteriaceae were detected in digester feed, including Citrobacter,

315

Enterobacter, Erwinia, Kluyvera, Pantoea, Serratia and Lelliottia. Jackson et al. (54)

316

identified Serratia, Erwinia, Enterobacter and Pantoea from leafy salad vegetables,

317

which are also common in food waste. While many of the identified Enterobacteriaceae

318

are widely recognized as plant pathogens or symbionts (e.g. Erwinia), potential human

319

pathogens were also detected (e.g. Enterobacter, Serratia).

320

Special attention should be given to the occurrence of ESKAPE pathogens -

321

Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter

322

baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, that are common causes

323

of nosocomial infections and characterized by various antimicrobial resistance

324

mechanisms (55). A total of 15 OTUs annotated to S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A.

325

baumannii or P. aeruginosa were found in very low abundance in digester feed (each

326

with relative abundance below 0.12% of total OTUs), while none of these were detected

15

327

in digestion products. One hundred and two (102) OTUs were annotated to Enterobacter

328

comprising up to 0.13% of OTUs in digester feed, while none was detected in digestion

329

products. Thus, ESKAPE pathogens were detectable in relatively low abundance in the

330

digester feed used in this study but did not survive anaerobic treatment.

331

The microbial community after AD was completely different from that in the

332

feed. Hydrolytic, fermenting, acidogenic, acetogenic and methanogenic microorganisms

333

comprise a typical microbial community in a stable AD process. Representatives from the

334

phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria that

335

have been connected to hydrolysis, fermentation and acidogenesis (56) were identified in

336

the bacterial communities of the digestate samples in this study. As expected, digestates

337

exhibited abundant archaeal communities responsible for methane production.

338

Acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta was identified as the dominant archaeal genus

339

(reaching up to 72.6% of total archaeal OTUs in DG74), which has been noted before for

340

digesters with high acetate concentration (57, 58). Members of the orders

341

Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales commonly identified in anaerobic digesters

342

treating food waste (59–61) were also present in the digestates of the current study. Thus,

343

a diverse methanogenic community achieved stable methane production, as evidenced by

344

substantial feedstock degradation and biogas production rates (40).

345

ARGs in digester feed and digestion products. ARGs were identified in all

346

samples, in digester feed as well as in AD products. Higher richness as well as higher

347

relative abundance of individual ARGs per 16S rRNA gene was found in digester feed

348

compared to digestion products indicating the ability of AD to reduce ARG diversity and

349

abundance. Total relative abundance of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene reached 0.84

16

350

ARG/16S rRNA gene in digester feed (LBF1), which is comparable to ARG levels in

351

faeces and wastewater from livestock farms (36), while the respective value in digestion

352

products was below 0.05 ARG/16S rRNA (0.04 ARG/16S rRNA in UASB), comparable

353

to natural environments such as soils, sediments and river water (36). Thus, AD clearly

354

reduced ARG values from levels associated with high contamination to environmental

355

background levels.

356

Yet, although AD significantly reduced the abundance of ARGs, a limited number

357

of ARGs were also detected in digestion products. Total community metagenome

358

sequencing and HT-qPCR array both detected ARGs in digestion products that were low

359

in abundance relative to the total microbial population (as shown by total community

360

metagenome sequencing), but achieved high absolute abundance per gram dry mass of

361

digestate (reaching 108 copies/g-dw for individual genes and 109 copies/g-dw in total)

362

due to high bacterial loads in the digestates (as shown by HT-qPCR array). Same order of

363

magnitude absolute abundance values of individual ARGs detected by qPCR have also

364

been reported previously for anaerobic digestates of FW (62). Thus, the effectiveness of

365

AD on treating waste containing ARGs is a function of which microbes can grow in the

366

AD system. In this case study, ARGs from food waste microbes were eliminated while

367

ARGs present in the microbes involved in the digestion process were more abundant in

368

the final digestate, and were at high absolute abundance owing to the high concentration

369

of microbes generally after digestion. Future experiments should focus on post-treatment

370

of digested solids, such as additional aerobic curing to reduce odor and stabilize waste, to

371

determine the ultimate environmental load of ARGs associated with land application of

372

anaerobic digestates.

373

Special attention should be given to the mobility of ARGs that can be transferred

374

from environmental bacteria to human pathogens or vice versa as shown previously (63).

375

In this study, on average, 32% of ARGs in assembled contigs from digester feed were

376

located on plasmids, indicating their potential mobility. Similar plasmid proportions from

377

total assembled contigs have also been found in photobioreactor microbial communities

378

(64) and microbial mats inhabiting mine waters (65). The HT-qPCR array detected a

379

wide array of MGEs including insertional sequences, integrases, transposases and

380

plasmids mostly in food waste but also in digestates. Class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1

381

has been suggested as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution (66) and was also found in

382

digester feed (in the range of 105–106 copies/g-dw) as well as in digestion products (108

383

copies/g-dw) of this study. The occurrence of intI1 in digestion products correlates with

384

the limited number of ARGs detected in the digestates of this study, showing that

385

anthropogenic impact remains detectable after AD.

386

Potential bacterial host organisms of ARGs. Correlation and network analysis

387

have been used in previous studies to link ARGs to their potential host organisms (35–37,

388

67). Here we used a combination of metagenomic assembly and binning methods to

389

detect taxonomically annotated contigs and MAGs with ARGs.

390

Taxonomic annotation of ARG-containing contigs showed several connections

391

between bacterial genera and ARGs. Among others, the genera Enterobacter, Klebsiella,

392

Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas that include medically critical ESKAPE-pathogens were

393

connected to ARGs in digester feed conferring resistance to multidrug, MLS, polymyxin,

394

aminoglycoside, triclosan and bacitracin antibiotics. The high number of multidrug

395

resistance genes is especially worrisome as these genes have the potential to confer

396

resistance to several types of antibiotics. Besides that, 12 out of 14 of the most abundant

397

ARG-containing genera in digester feed also included resistance genes to polymyxin, a

398

last-resort antibiotic used against Gram-negative bacteria. This highlights the spread of

399

ARGs against last-resort antibiotics among various bacterial genera. ARG-containing

400

genera that include clinically important species were also detected in digestion products,

401

including Burkholderia, Arcobacter, Streptococcus and Escherichia indicating the risks

402

associated with the possible use of anaerobic digestates.

403

Using metagenomic binning we were able to detect four ARG-containing MAGs

404

originating from digester feed. A MAG annotated as Erwinia was found to carry 19

405

ARGs conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics. Although Erwinia is

406

commonly known as a plant pathogen, few cases of human infections have also been

407

reported (68, 69). As Erwinia is closely related to other Enterobacteriaceae that include

408

several known human pathogens, horizontal transfer of ARGs from plant-pathogenic

409

Erwinia to human pathogenic genera may occur. Additionally, MAGs annotated as lactic

410

acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus were found to carry ARGs. These

411

bacteria are extensively used for food fermentation processes and are often regarded as

412

probiotics, however, increasing evidence suggests they are reservoirs of potentially

413

transmissible ARGs and may play a crucial role in the acquisition of AMR via food (70).

414

It is noteworthy, that although 75% of all MAGs originated from digestion products,

415

these MAGs did not contain ARGs. This correlates with the low abundance of ARGs in

416

digestion products detected by other methods used in this study.

417
418

Methodological aspects of ARG detection. In this study total community
metagenome data and HT-qPCR data were used to characterize the diversity and

419

abundance of ARGs. While the metagenomic approach has the potential to detect higher

420

diversity of ARGs due to large reference databases, qPCR of ARGs, although being

421

limited in the number of ARGs even in high-throughput applications, can provide higher

422

sensitivity (71). Our results showed that both metagenomic and HT-qPCR approach

423

detected a broad spectrum of ARGs with higher diversity of ARGs in digester feed

424

compared to digestion products. Among the limited number of ARGs detected in

425

digestion products mphA, lnuB, catQ and tet44 were found to be unique to digestate by

426

both metagenomic and HT-qPCR approach. Additionally, HT-qPCR provided absolute

427

abundance values for individual ARGs that could be related back to the number of gene

428

copies present per gram of digester feed and in digested solids. This type of quantitative

429

information on ARGs is required for assessing the risks associated with food waste and

430

the use of anaerobic digestates as agricultural fertilizers. Thus, a combination of shotgun

431

metagenomic and qPCR approach is recommended for a comprehensive view of a

432

sample’s resistome and for the assessment of AMR risks.

433

In addition to the annotation of short sequencing reads, we used assembled

434

contigs to provide genomic context of ARGs. The distribution of ARG types on

435

assembled contigs closely resembled that on short sequencing reads, additionally,

436

assembled data provided information about genomic location and potential host

437

organisms of ARGs, which cannot be determined from short sequencing reads. Although

438

assembled contigs provide better resolution for taxonomic and functional annotation than

439

short sequencing reads, assembly may also introduce biases (71). Similar problem has

440

been noted for metagenomic binning, which often has limited power for analysis of

441

complex microbial communities. This was also evident in the results of the current study

20

442

with 75% of MAGs (151 MAGs) originating from digestion products and only 25% of

443

MAGs (50 MAGs) originating from the heterogeneous microbial communities of digester

444

feed. Thus, our findings should be interpreted in light of the limitations of current

445

methods used for taxonomic and functional analysis of complex microbial communities.

446

In conclusion, using a combination of metagenome sequencing, assembly and

447

binning as well as quantitative PCR analysis is recommended to estimate the diversity

448

and abundance of ARGs and to situate the ARGs within their genomic context and

449

potential host organisms. The detection of potential host organisms and genomic context

450

allows for a more accurate risk evaluation associated with solid organic wastes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Anaerobic digestion system and feedstock. A lab-scale anaerobic digestion

454

system designed for the treatment of solid organic waste was operated for a total of 88

455

weeks. System design, its operating parameters and feedstock have been described in

456

detail by Guilford et al. (40). In short, the anaerobic digestion system consisted of 6 leach

457

beds (8.5 L each), an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB, 27.5 L) treating

458

leach bed leachate, a UASB feed tank (17.5 L), a leach bed feed tank (17.5 L), three

459

peristaltic pumps to recirculate leachate, two wet-tip gas meters for biogas measurement,

460

and an automated control system. The system was maintained at 37–39°C with

461

continuous recirculation of the leachate. It was operated in sequential batch feeding

462

mode: each week one of the leach beds was filled with a mixture of lignocellulosic fibres

463

and food waste (FW) making up the leach bed feed (LBF), recovered from local

464

residential waste recycling programs. Lignocellulosic fibres included shredded cardboard,

465

boxboard, fine paper and newsprint; food waste was collected from a residential green

466

bin program and sorted manually to remove bones and inorganic materials. Solids

467

retention time in the system was six weeks.

468

Sampling and DNA extraction. Samples for microbial community analysis were

469

collected during weeks 75–84 of the experiment, during which FW contributed 21.3% of

470

the total COD in the feedstock and the system exhibited stable performance with a

471

methane yield of 246 L-CH4 kg-VSadded-1 and a substrate destruction efficiency, as

472

volatile solids (VS), of 63.5% (40). Ten 50 mL samples were collected: three food waste

473

samples FW1, FW2, FW3 (FW source and composition has been described by Guilford

474

et al. (40)); three leach bed feed samples LBF1, LBF2, LBF3 consisting of the respective

475

food waste mixed with lignocellulosic fibres; three digestate samples DG74, DG76,

476

DG78 collected after 6 weeks of digestion; and one sample from the microbial granular

477

sludge of the UASB reactor (UASB). It should be noted that DG74, DG76 and DG78

478

were not direct digestion products of LBF1, LBF2 and LBF3, respectively, although

479

derived from the same source of FW and lignocellulosic fibres used for LBF1, LBF2 and

480

LBF3. All samples were preserved at –20°C until DNA extraction.

481

Total community DNA was extracted using the PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation

482

Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 5 g of sample according to

483

manufacturer’s protocol. FW and LBF samples were further purified with 5 M NaCl and

484

100% ethanol as recommended by the manufacturer. The quantity and quality of DNA

485

extracts was confirmed using NanoDrop spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Wilmington, DE,

486

USA). All DNA extracts were stored at –80°C.

487

Quantitative PCR analyses. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify total

488

bacterial (method 1.1 in Fig. 1) and archaeal (method 1.2 in Fig. 1) 16S rRNA gene

489

copies using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories,

490

Hercules, CA, USA) and previously published primers targeting most bacterial 16S

491

rRNA genes: Bac1055f (5’-ATGGCTGTCGTCAGCT-3’) and Bac1392r (5’-

492

ACGGGCGGTGTGTAC-3’) (72, 73), and most archaeal 16S rRNA genes: Arch787f

493

(5’-ATTAGATACCCGBGTAGTCC-3’) and Arch1059r (5’-GCCATGCACCWCCTCT-

494

3’) (74). qPCR reactions were performed in 20 µL comprising 10 µL SsoFast EvaGreen

495

Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), 0.5 µM each forward and reverse

496

primer, 2 µL template DNA, and sterile UltraPure distilled water. The thermocycling

497

program was as follows: initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of

498

denaturation at 98°C for 5 s, annealing at Tm (55°C for bacterial 16S rRNA, 60°C for

499

archaeal 16S rRNA) for 10 s, and final melting curve analysis in the range of 65–95°C

500

(steps of 0.5°C for 5 s). All samples were measured in three technical replicates and

501

every qPCR run included negative controls containing all reaction components except for

502

template DNA. Serial dilutions of plasmid stocks containing corresponding 16S rRNA

503

gene fragments were used to generate standard curves. Amplification data was analyzed

504

using CFX Manager Software v.3.1. Copy numbers of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA

505

genes per gram of sample dry weight were calculated as follows: AbsoluteAbundance =

506

StartingQuantity * DNAElutionVolume / (SampleWeight*SampleDW) where

507

StartingQuantity represents the gene copies in 1 µL DNA extract as estimated by the

508

CFX Manager Software, DNAElutionVolume was 5000 µL for DG74, DG76, DG78,

509

UASB and 100 µL for FW1, FW2, FW3, LBF1, LBF2, LBF3, SampleWeight was the

510

mass of the sample used for DNA extraction and SampleDW was the dry weight of the

511

sample material used for DNA extraction.

512

A high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) array was used for the quantification of

513

ARGs (method 4.1 in Fig. 1) and MGEs (method 4.2 in Fig. 1) in FW1, FW2, DG74 and

514

DG78. DNA extracts were sent to Dr Robert Stedtfeld at Michigan State University

515

(USA) who performed the analysis. A total of 384 primer sets were used targeting 315

516

ARGs and 57 MGEs, additionally taxonomic marker genes were included in the array

517

(75). All HT-qPCR reactions were performed using Takara (previously WaferGen)

518

SmartChip real-time PCR system as described previously (76). In brief, 5184 parallel

519

qPCR reactions (100 nL) were dispensed into the SmartChip using the SmartChip

520

Multisample Nanodispenser, followed by thermal cycling in the SmartChip Cycler,

521

automatic melting process and initial data processing with SmartChip qPCR Software

522

(v.2.7.0.1) as described before (76). Wells with multiple melt peaks and wells with

523

amplification efficiency outside the range 1.75 to 2.25 were removed from analysis. Each

524

sample was analyzed by three technical replicates. Genes detected in only one of the

525

replicates were considered false positives and removed from analysis. Genomic copy

526

numbers were estimated using the formula in Looft et al. (77) with the exception of

527

setting detection limit to threshold cycle (Ct) 28 as suggested by Stedtfeld et al. (75).

528

Relative abundances of the studied genes were calculated as ratios to 16S rRNA:

529

RelativeAbundancegene = GenomicCopyNumbergene / GenomicCopyNumber16S. Absolute

530

abundances were determined by multiplying the relative abundance of a gene by 16S

531

rRNA absolute abundance (determined by regular qPCR analysis described above):

532

AbsoluteAbundancegene = RelativeAbundancegene * AbsoluteAbundance16S. ARG

Total community metagenome sequencing and bioinformatic workflow. Total

549

community metagenome sequencing of the samples FW1, FW2, LBF1, LBF2, DG74,

550

DG78, UASB was performed at University of Toronto Centre for the Analysis of

551

Genome Evolution and Function (Canada) on Illumina NextSeq500 Desktop Sequencer

552

v2 using High Output flowcell (PE150). Bioinformatic workflow included quality control

553

and trimming of the sequencing reads, taxonomic classification, metagenomic assembly

554

and binning, and detection of ARGs. Sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic

556

trimming to remove polyG sequences (≥30 bp) was performed with AfterQC v.0.9.1 (83)

557

(tool 3.2 in Fig. 1).

558

Quality-trimmed reads were subjected to taxonomic classification using Kaiju

559

v.1.4.5 (84) (tool 3.3 in Fig. 1) in greedy mode (allowed substitutions 5, minimum

560

required match length 11, minimum required match score 70) with bacterial, archaeal,

561

eukaryotic and viral protein sequences from the NCBI nr database as reference. To

562

further investigate microbial community composition, metaxa2 v.2.1 (85) (tool 3.4 in Fig.

563

1) was used to extract small subunit rRNA gene reads in metagenome mode with default

564

search criteria and reliability score cut-off 80.

565

Quality-trimmed reads were assembled into longer DNA contigs using

566

MEGAHIT v.1.1.1 (86) (tool 3.6 in Fig. 1) and metaSPAdes v.3.10.1 (87) (tool 3.7 in

567

Fig. 1) with default settings. Assemblies were compared using metaQUAST v.4.5 (88)

568

which also provided assembly statistics. Metagenome binning was performed using

569

MaxBin v.2.2.3 (89) (tool 3.11 in Fig. 1) and MetaBAT v.2.12 (90) (tool 3.12 in Fig. 1)

570

with default settings on the MEGAHIT assemblies. All genome bins produced by both

571

binning methods were dereplicated using dRep v.1.4.3 (91) (tool 3.13 in Fig. 1) with

572

default settings (ANI cut-off 99%, minimum genome completeness 75%, maximum

573

contamination 25%) and evaluated with CheckM v.1.0.7 (92). Quality of the resulting

574

metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) was defined as (Completeness –

575

5*Contamination) as suggested by Parks et al. (93). MAGs with quality >50 and

576

taxonomic classification to at least phylum level, were submitted to the JGI Integrated

577

Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG) database for annotation. Anvi’o v.5 (94)

578

was used for visualizing MAGs clustered based on the relative abundance of MAGs in

579

the samples: Euclidian distances were calculated from relative abundance estimates of

580

each MAG and clustering was performed using the ward linkage algorithm. Relative

581

abundance of each MAG was calculated as number of reads recruited to the MAG

582

divided by total reads recruited to that MAG across all samples.

583

ARGs from subsets of quality-trimmed sequencing reads (20 million

584

reads/sample) were determined with ARGs-OAP v.1.2 (41) (tool 3.5 in Fig. 1) using the

585

default reference database SARG and default settings. The same reference database was

586

also used to detect ARGs on assembled contigs by local BLASTp (evalue 1e-7, identity

587

percent 80, minimal alignment length 25) using protein coding genes annotated by JGI

588

IMG/M 4 version (95) as query sequences (tool 3.10 in Fig. 1). Contigs with multiple

589

ARGs were identified by a local python script that counted how many times a contig ID

590

appeared in the list of contigs that carried ARGs (Method S1 in supplemental material).

591

PlasFlow v.1.1 (65) with default settings was used to predict plasmid sequences from the

592

contigs with ARGs (tool 3.8 in Fig. 1). Taxonomic classification of the non-plasmid

593

contigs carrying ARGs was determined with Kaiju v.1.4.5 (84) in greedy mode

594

(maximum mismatches allowed 5, minimal required match length 11, minimal required

595

match score 70, filtering of query sequences containing low-complexity regions on) (tool

596

3.9 in Fig. 1) using NCBI RefSeq reference database and visualized with Cytoscape

597

v.3.6.1 (96) by selecting 10 most abundant ARGs from all genera above relative

598

abundance of 1%. The presence of ARGs in MAGs was determined by a local python

599

script comparing a list of ARG-carrying contigs to the list of contigs included in the

600

MAG (tool 3.14 in Fig. 1, Method S2 in supplemental material).

FIG 4 Absolute abundance of ARGs and MGEs in food waste (FW1, FW2) and digestate

992

(DG74, DG78) samples detected using a high-throughput qPCR array. Absolute

993

abundance of all detected genes is presented on log-scale as gene copies per gram of dry

994

weight of food waste or digestate samples. Genes not detected are marked in grey. Panel

995

A shows all ARGs detected in at least one of the four samples. Panel B shows all ARGs

996

detected in at least one of the digestate samples. Panel C shows all MGEs detected in at

997

least one of the four samples. Raw data for all analyzed genes together with abundance

998

calculations are provided in Table S5 in supplemental material.

FIG 5 Most abundant bacterial host genera of non-plasmid ARGs detected in digester

1002

feed (FW1, FW2, LBF1, LBF2). ARGs were identified on MEGAHIT-assembled contigs

1003

by BLAST analysis of protein coding genes using local SARG reference database (Table

1004

S7 in supplemental material). Non-plasmid contigs carrying ARGs were further

1005

annotated for their taxonomic affiliation using Kaiju. ARGs are depicted in ellipses

1006

colored by resistance type and bacterial genera are depicted in grey rectangles. The width

1007

of the connecting edge corresponds to detection frequency of individual host-ARG pairs.
