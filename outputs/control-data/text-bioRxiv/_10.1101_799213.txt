Abstract

26

Recovery from perturbations during walking is primarily mediated by reactive control

27

strategies that coordinate multiple body segments to maintain balance. Balance control is often

28

impaired in clinical populations who walk with spatiotemporally asymmetric gait, and, as a

29

result, rehabilitation efforts often seek to reduce asymmetries in these populations. Previous

30

work has demonstrated that the presence of spatiotemporal asymmetries during walking does

31

not impair the control of whole-body dynamics during perturbation recovery. However, it

32

remains to be seen how the neuromotor system adjusts intersegmental coordination patterns to

33

maintain invariant whole-body dynamics. Here, we determined if the neuromotor system

34

generates stereotypical coordination patterns irrespective of the level of asymmetry or if the

35

neuromotor system allows for variance in intersegmental coordination patterns to stabilize

36

whole-body dynamics. Nineteen healthy participants walked on a dual-belt treadmill at a range

37

of step length asymmetries, and they responded to unpredictable, slip-like perturbations. We

38

used principal component analysis of segmental angular momenta to characterize

39

intersegmental coordination patterns before, during, and after imposed perturbations. We found

40

that two principal components were sufficient to explain ~ 95% of the variance in segmental

41

angular momentum during both steading walking and responses to perturbations. Our results

42

also revealed that walking with asymmetric step lengths led to changes in intersegmental

43

coordination patterns during the perturbation and during subsequent recovery steps without

44

affecting whole-body angular momentum. These results suggest that the nervous system allows

45

for variance in segment-level coordination patterns to maintain invariant control of whole-body

46

angular momentum during walking. Future studies exploring how these segmental coordination

47

patterns change in individuals with asymmetries that result from neuromotor impairments can

Introduction
Bipedal locomotion is inherently unstable due to the small base of support, long single-

52

limb support times, and sensorimotor transmission delays [1]. As a result, we must frequently

53

generate corrective responses to maintain balance in response to both internal and external

54

perturbations [2,3]. For example, to recover from unexpected perturbations such as slips or trips

55

while walking, the nervous system generates reactive control strategies involving simultaneous,

56

coordinated responses of both the upper and lower limbs [4,5]. These reactive, interlimb

57

responses to perturbations can restore stability by generating changes in angular momentum that

58

counteract the body's rotation toward the ground.

59

One conventional method to capture whole-body rotational dynamics during perturbation

60

responses is to compute whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM reflects the net

61

influence of all the body segments’ rotation relative to a specified axis, which is commonly taken

62

to project through the body's center of mass [6–8]. WBAM is highly regulated as its value

63

remains close to zero during normal, unperturbed walking [9,10]. During perturbed walking,

64

angular momentum dramatically deviates from that measured during unperturbed walking [6,7],

65

and this deviation captures the features of body rotation that, if not arrested, would lead to a fall.

66

To regain balance when encountering unexpected perturbations, the central nervous system

67

activates muscles to accelerate body segments and restore angular momentum across multiple

68

recovery steps [11,12].

69

Angular momentum can also capture balance impairments in populations with gait

70

asymmetries and sensorimotor deficits such as amputees and stroke survivors. These individuals

71

often have a higher peak-to-peak range of angular momentum than healthy controls [13–16], and

72

the presence of gait asymmetries may contribute to balance impairments in these populations.

73

For example, the magnitude of step length asymmetry in people-post stroke is negatively

74

correlated with scores on the Berg Balance Scale, indicating that step length asymmetry is

75

associated with increased fall risk [17].

76

An important question for clinical researchers is whether there is a causal relationship

77

between gait asymmetry and the ability to maintain balance in response to perturbations during

78

walking. Previous work demonstrated that whole-body dynamics, as measured by WBAM, do

79

not change in response to imposed gait asymmetries in healthy individuals [7]. However, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/799213; this version posted October 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

80

strategy that the central nervous system uses to stabilize whole-body dynamics remains to be

81

determined. There are two distinct hypotheses capable of explaining the negligible influence of

82

asymmetry on whole-body angular momentum. First, the central nervous system may generate

83

stereotypical, invariant intersegmental coordination patterns in response to perturbations,

84

irrespective of the level of asymmetry. Alternatively, the nervous system could use reactive

85

control strategies that covary with asymmetry in a manner that would lead to invariant control of

86

whole-body momentum. This would be consistent with the uncontrolled manifold (UCM)

87

hypothesis, which predicts that the nervous system allows for variability in segmental angular

88

momenta to stabilize a higher-order performance variable such as whole-body angular

89

momentum [18].

90

Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are

91

commonly used to capture how the central nervous system coordinates multiple limb segments

92

[6,19]. PCA reduces the high-dimensional, multi-segmental time series data into a lower-

93

dimensional set of latent variables capable of capturing the variance in the overall behavior.

94

Aprigliano et al. used PCA to show that there is no difference in intersegmental coordination

95

patterns between fall-prone older adults and healthy young adults in response to slip-like

96

perturbations [19]. Other studies used PCA of segmental angular momentum to show that the

97

intersegmental coordination patterns observed during recovery from slip-like perturbations are

98

highly correlated with the patterns observed during unperturbed walking [20,21]. Together, these

99

studies suggest that the central nervous system may adopt a preprogrammed and invariant

100
101

response to perturbation recovery across different tasks and populations.
Here, our objective was to determine how the presence of step length asymmetries

102

influences patterns of intersegmental coordination during slip-like perturbations. Since it has

103

previously been demonstrated that step length asymmetry does not influence the magnitude of

104

whole-body angular momentum, we aimed to determine if this was because the neuromotor

105

system generates stereotypical intersegmental coordination patterns across levels of asymmetry

106

or because the neuromotor system generates patterns of intersegmental coordination that covary

107

with spatiotemporal asymmetry. Ultimately, our findings extend our understanding of how the

108

healthy central nervous system coordinates intersegmental dynamics to maintain balance during

109

walking.

Methods
2.1 Participant characteristics

112

A total of 19 healthy young individuals (10M, 24 ± 4 yrs old) with no musculoskeletal or

113

gait impairments participated in this study. Lower limb dominance was determined by asking

114

participants which leg they would use to kick a ball. The study was approved by the Institutional

115

Review Board at the University of Southern California, and all participants provided informed

116

consent before participating. All aspects of the study conformed to the principles described in the

117

Declaration of Helsinki.

118

2.2

119

Experiment protocol
Data used here were collected as part of a previous study [7], and we provide a summary

120

of the procedures and setup below. Participants walked on an instrumented, dual-belt treadmill

121

with force plates underneath (Bertec, USA) at 1.0 m/s for six separate trials and reacted to

122

accelerations of the treadmill belts throughout the experiment. Although 1 m/s was slower than

123

the reported average self-selected speed during treadmill walking [22], we chose this speed to be

124

consistent with other investigations of the role of asymmetry during healthy gait [23–25]. For

125

the first trial, participants walked on the treadmill for three minutes (Baseline) to obtain their

126

natural level of step length asymmetry. Then, for subsequent trials, participants were instructed

127

to modify their step lengths according to visual feedback provided via a display attached to the

128

treadmill, and we informed them that random slip-like perturbations would occur during these

129

trials. The visual feedback displayed the target step length for both right and left legs. A

130

“success” message would appear on the screen if the participants were able to step within three

131

standard deviations of the target step length. Participants completed a randomized sequence of

132

five, six-minute trials with target step length asymmetries (SLA, Eq. 1) of 0%, ± 10%, and ±

133

15% where 0% represents each participant’s baseline SLA.

134

(1)

135

SLleft represents left step length and SLright represents the right step length. Each trial

136

consisted of one-minute of practice walking without any perturbations, and then a total of 20

137

perturbations were applied (10 to each belt) during the remainder of the trial. Foot strike was

138

computed as the point when vertical ground reaction forces reached 150 N. Each perturbation

139

was remotely triggered by preprogrammed Python code and was characterized by a trapezoidal

140

speed profile in which the treadmill accelerated at foot strike to 1.5 m/s at an acceleration of 1.6

141

m/s2, held this speed for 0.3 s, and then decelerated back to 1.0 m/s during the swing phase of the

142

perturbed leg. Participants were aware that they would experience perturbations during the

143

experiment, but the perturbations were randomly triggered to occur within a range of 20 to 30

144

steps after the previous perturbation to prevent participants from precisely anticipating

145

perturbation timing. This range of steps was also selected to provide participants with sufficient

146

time to reestablish their walking pattern to match with the visual feedback.

147

2.3

Data Acquisition

148

A ten-camera motion capture system (Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) recorded 3D

149

marker kinematics at 100 Hz and ground reaction forces at 1000 Hz. We placed a set of 19 mm

150

spherical markers on anatomical landmarks to create a 13-segment, full-body model [26,27]. We

151

placed marker clusters on the upper arms, forearms, thighs, shanks, and the back of heels.

152

Marker positions were calibrated during a five-second standing trial at the beginning of each

153

trial. We removed all joint markers after the calibration.

154

2.4

155

Data processing
We post-processed the kinematic and kinetic data in Visual3D (C-Motion, Rockville,

156

MD, USA) and Matlab 2017a (Mathworks, USA) to compute variables of interest. Marker

157

positions and ground reaction forces were low-pass filtered by 4th order Butterworth filters with

158

cutoff frequencies of 6 Hz and 20 Hz, respectively. We selected the type of filter and cut-off

159

frequency based on previous literature [3,28,29]. We calculated the achieved SLA as follows:

160

first, we calculated the mean SLA of the four strides before each perturbation and then

161

distributed these mean values into five equally spaced bins centered at -15%, -10%, 0, 10%, 15%

162

with bin width equal to 5%. We used this achieved SLA instead of target SLA as the independent

163

variable in our statistical analyses. We categorized Baseline (BSL) steps as the two steps before

164

the perturbation occurred, perturbation (PTB) steps as the step during which the perturbation was

165

applied, and recovery (REC) steps as the steps that followed the perturbation. Since we did not

166

find any differences between left and right perturbations, our current analysis includes only

167

perturbations of the right limb [7]. We also focused our analysis on angular momentum about the

168

pitch axis as this was the direction in which the most prominent changes in WBAM were

169

observed. Only minor deviations in WBAM about the roll and yaw axes occurred during the

170

perturbation and recovery steps [7].

171

2.5

172

Segmental Angular Momentum
We created a 13-segment, whole-body model in Visual3D and calculated the angular

173

momentum of each segment about the body’s center of mass. Segmental angular momenta (𝐿𝑠i )

174

captured how the rotational behavior of each body segment changed in response to the treadmill

175

perturbations. The model included the following segments: head, thorax, pelvis, upper arms,

176

forearms, thighs, shanks, and feet. The limb segments’ mass was modeled based on

177

anthropometric tables [30], and segment geometry was modeled based on the description in

178

Hanavan [31]. All segments were modeled with six degrees of freedom, and we did not define

179

any constraints between segments. Segmental linear and angular velocity were computed using

180

Eq. 2 [15].
𝑚𝑖(𝑟𝐶𝑀𝑖 ‒ 𝑖 × 𝑣𝐶𝑀𝑖 ‒ 𝑖 ) + 𝐼𝑖𝜔𝑖

181

𝐿𝑠i =

182

Here, mi is segmental mass, rCM-i is a vector from the segment's COM to the body's COM,

𝑀𝑉𝐻

(2)

183

vCM-i is the velocity of each segment’s COM relative to the body’s COM, Ii is the segmental

184

moment of inertia, ω𝑖 is segmental angular velocity, and the index i corresponds to individual

185

limb segments. Lastly, we normalized momentum by the participant’s mass (M), baseline

186

treadmill velocity (V), and the participant’s height (H) (Eq. 2) following previous literature

187

[9,16]. Since our statistical analysis used a within-subject design, the choice of variables used for

188

normalization should not affect the statistical results.The convention for measuring angular

189

momentum was defined such that positive values represented backward rotation.

190

2.6

191

Principal component analysis (PCA)
We used principal component analysis (PCA) to extract intersegmental coordination

192

patterns for each step cycle. Before performing PCA, we first time normalized the time series of

193

segmental angular momenta to 100 points for each step cycle. Then, for each participant, we

194

generated an 𝐿𝑠 matrix for each achieved SLA ( ± 15%, ± 10%, ± 5%, %0) and step type

195

(BSL1, BSL2, PTB, REC1, REC2, REC3, REC4) with n_steps*100 rows and 13 columns. On

196

average, we created 6 (achieved SLA) by 7 (step types) matrices per participant as not all

197

participants achieved each desired level of asymmetry. We then standardized each matrix to have

198

zero mean and performed PCA to extract subject-specific coordination patterns using the pca

199

function in Matlab’s Statistical and Machine Learning Toolbox. Using PCA, we decomposed the

200

segmental angular momenta data into 1) a weighting coefficient matrix consisting of principal

201

components (PCs) ordered according to their variance accounted for (VAF) and 2) time series

202

scores which represented the activation of each PC throughout the step cycle (Figure 1). We

203

retained the number of PCs necessary to account for at least 90% of variance in 𝐿𝑠.

Comparison of intersegmental coordination patterns
To investigate how intersegmental coordination patterns changed after each perturbation,

216

we compared the PCs extracted from the perturbation and recovery steps to the PCs extracted

217

from baseline steps. We computed the included angle (θstep , Eq. 3) between each pair of PCs as

218

this is a common method to compare the similarity between vectors in a high-dimensional space.

219

The included angle of the unit vectors was between 0° (parallel and identical) and 90°

220

(orthogonal and most dissimilar) [32].

221

θstep = cos ‒ 1 (𝑃𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 ∙ 𝑃𝐶𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)

222

We then determined if the included angle between perturbation steps and baseline steps

(3)

223

was outside the distribution of included angles observed during unperturbed baseline walking.

224

To this end, we performed a permutation test that randomly and repeatedly selected two groups

225

of ten baseline steps for each participant. For each permutation, we first performed PCA for each

226

group of 10 steps and then calculated the included angle between the two PCs. We repeated this

227

shuffling process 10000 times for each participant. We used the median of this distribution as a

228

threshold to determine if the included angle for post-perturbation values was greater than what

229

would be expected from step-to-step variance.

230

Similarly, we computed the included angle between PCs extracted during walking at

231

different levels of asymmetry to those extracted from symmetrical walking to investigate how

232

asymmetry influenced intersegmental coordination patterns. (Eqn. 4).

233

θasym = cos ‒ 1 (𝑃𝐶𝑠𝑦𝑚 ∙ 𝑃𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑦𝑚)

234

We also determined if the differences in coordination observed during walking with

(4)

235

different levels of asymmetry were above the level of variance observed during symmetrical

236

walking. As described above, we obtained a reference distribution of included angles from

237

symmetric walking to determine if the included angle for each level of asymmetry was greater

238

than would be expected from natural, step-to-step variance.

239

2.8

240

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R (3.4.3) using linear mixed-effects (LME)

241

models. We used the lme4 package to fit the model, the multcomp comparison for multiple

242

comparisons [33], and lmerTest package to calculate p-values [34]. Residual normality was

243

confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. When computing p-values, we used the Satterthwaite

244

approximation for the degrees of freedom based on differences in variance between conditions.

245

We used the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for all post-hoc analyses. For each

246

model, we determined if random effects were necessary by comparing a model including random

247

intercepts for each participant against a model with only fixed effects. The most parsimonious

248

model was chosen based on the results of a likelihood ratio test. The random effects were

249

included to account for the individual differences between subjects. Significance was set at

250

p<0.05 level.

251

We first determined if the PCs extracted from the recovery steps differed from the PCs

252

extracted from the baseline steps during symmetrical walking. Here, the independent variable

253

was step type, and the dependent variable was θstep. The models were fit for both PC1 and PC2.

254

We performed a log transformation of the dependent variable (θstep) to ensure that the residuals

255

were normally distributed. Then, we determined if intersegmental coordination patterns during

256

asymmetrical walking differed from those during symmetrical walking. For this analysis, we

257

used Welch’s t-test to evaluate if the included angle between the PCs extracted from the

258

asymmetrical trials and those extracted from symmetric walking were greater than what would

259

be expected by chance. We used Welch’s t-test because the included angle was not normally

260

distributed.

261

Lastly, we determined if the included angle between each asymmetric trial and symmetric

262

walking varied with the magnitude or direction of asymmetry. For this analysis, the independent

263

variables were the magnitude of asymmetry, the direction of asymmetry, and the interaction

264

between asymmetry magnitude and direction, and the dependent variable was θasym. We fit

265

separate linear mixed-effect models for each of five steps (Baseline1, Baseline2, Perturbation,

266

Recovery 1 and Recovery 2) and each PC. We performed a log transformation of the dependent

267

variable (θasym) to ensure that the residuals were normally distributed.

Results
For all steps, two principal components accounted for ~95% of the variance in segmental

270

angular momentum (Table 1). On average, PC1 explained 74 ± 4% of the variance, and PC2

271

explained 22± 1% of the variance, while PC3 accounted for less than 3% of the variance. Thus,

272

the remaining analysis focuses on the first two PCs.

Patterns of intersegmental coordination when walking with equal step lengths
Contributions from the lower extremities were typically dominant in the first PC, while

278

contributions from the arms, pelvis, thorax, and head were less prominent (Figure 2). During

279

right steps, the left leg was in the swing phase and generated more positive momentum about the

280

body's COM, while the right leg generated negative momentum. Thus, the weighting coefficients

281

for the left leg segments (left thigh, shank, and foot) were positive while the coefficients for the

282

right leg segments were negative. Similarly, during a left step, the right leg was in the swing

283

phase and generated more positive momentum about COM, while the left leg generated negative

284

momentum. Thus, the weighting coefficients were positive while the coefficients for the left leg

295

For PC2, weighting coefficients for distal segments were also larger than the weighting

296

coefficients for proximal segments, although the coefficient for the thorax (THX) increased

297

compared to that in PC1. During the right step, the left thigh and left shank’s momenta opposed

298

the momentum of the left foot. Similarly, during the left step, the right thigh and shank momenta

299

opposed the right foot momentum. Thus, PC2 captured intralimb cancellation of segmental

300

momenta.

Effects of perturbations on patterns of intersegmental coordination
During the perturbation step, there was a significant increase in the included angle, which

303

indicated that the intersegmental coordination patterns during perturbation steps differed from

304

the coordination patterns during baseline steps (Figure 3). For this analysis, the results of the log-

305

likelihood ratio test revealed that random effects were necessary for the regression model. For

306

PC1, we found that the intersegmental coordination patterns were significantly different from the

307

patterns during baseline walking for the perturbation steps (t(54)=18.2, p<2e-16), first recovery

308

steps (t(54)=11.8, p<2e-16), and second recovery steps (t(54)=8.4, p=2.3e-11). Similarly, for

309

PC2, intersegmental coordination differed during perturbation steps (t(54)=11.8, p<2.0e-16), first

310

recovery steps (t(36)=6.7, p<2e-16),and second recovery steps (t(54)=4.9,p=8.9e-6).There was

311

no significant difference between intersegmental coordination patterns during the third recovery

312

steps for either PC1 (p = 0.97) or PC2 (p = 0.14). Thus, participants generally were able to

313

restore their coordination patterns to baseline by the third recovery step.

Effects of step length asymmetry on patterns of intersegmental coordination
Although the general patterns of intersegmental coordination were similar across levels

328

of asymmetry, asymmetric walking patterns led to measurable changes in the contributions of the

329

distal lower extremity segments (Figure 4). Qualitatively, we observed increased weights at the

330

left foot as well as decreased weights of the left shank segment for the first principal component

331

during right steps. This likely reflected the need for longer left steps and faster foot swing for

332

positive step length asymmetries.

across all participants (N=17), and the black lines indicate the standard deviation.

337
338

As the magnitude of achieved asymmetry increased, we observed an increase in the

339

deviation of intersegmental coordination patterns from symmetrical walking (Figure 5). Results

340

of log-likelihood ratio tests showed that random intercepts were required in the regression

341

models. One outlier was removed before fitting the linear mixed model for the perturbation step

342

for PC2 because it was more than three standard deviations higher than the median of the

343

included angles. Excluding the outlier did not change the statistical outcome. All included angles

344

differed from the permutated estimate of included angles (p<0.05), indicating that intersegmental

345

coordination at each level of asymmetry differed from the coordination pattern during

346

symmetrical walking. For all steps, we observed a significant main effect of asymmetry on the

347

included angle between the PCs from the asymmetric trials and the symmetric trial (Table 2).

Figure 5: included angle between PCs extracted during asymmetrical walking (5%, 10%, and
15%) and symmetrical walking for each step (*** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05). Blue: Right

356
357

The included angle between the PCs extracted during asymmetric walking and symmetric

358

walking increased with the magnitude of achieved asymmetry (Figure 5). Specifically, the

359

difference between intersegmental coordination patterns was greater when walking with 15%

360

asymmetry compared to 5% asymmetry during right baseline steps (Bonferroni corrected

361

p<0.001), perturbation steps (Bonferroni corrected p<0.001), first recovery steps (Bonferroni

362

corrected p=0.03) and second recovery steps (Bonferroni corrected p=0.002) for PC1. The

363

difference in included angles was also significantly different from 5% asymmetry for PC2 when

364

walking with 15% asymmetry during baseline right steps (Bonferroni corrected p=0.01) and

365

perturbation steps (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.003) and second recovery steps (Bonferroni

366

corrected p=0.04). Lastly, there was only an effect of the direction of asymmetry for PC2 (F(1,

367

79), p=0.049) during the baseline right step (Baseline 1).

Discussion
We investigated how step length asymmetry affected intersegmental coordination

370

patterns during responses to treadmill-based slip perturbations during walking. Our central

371

finding was that intersegmental coordination patterns observed during asymmetrical walking

372

differed from symmetrical walking during both unperturbed walking and perturbation recovery.

373

When combined with previous observations that the reactive control of overall WBAM is not

374

influenced by asymmetry [7], these results indicate that healthy people use a flexible

375

combination of intersegmental coordination patterns rather than invariant reactions to maintain

376

WBAM during perturbation responses when walking with asymmetric gait patterns.

377

Variations in coordination patterns during asymmetrical walking likely resulted from

378

changes in the momentum generated by the lower extremities to reach the target asymmetry.

379

Since the distal segments of the lower limbs are relatively far from the body’s center of mass and

380

have a high velocity, they make the largest contribution to changes in intersegmental

381

coordination patterns. For example, to achieve a positive asymmetry, participants placed their

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/799213; this version posted October 9, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

382

left foot further in front of the center of mass and increased the extension of their right hip so that

383

the right foot was further behind their COM at heel strike. To achieve this objective, participants

384

had to increase swing velocity. This likely explains why we observed increased weights of the

385

left foot as SLA increased during right steps in the first principal component since positive step

386

length asymmetries required longer left steps and faster foot swing.

387

The observation that reactive control of WBAM is consistent across levels of asymmetry

388

[7] despite the variation in intersegmental coordination observed here may indicate that WBAM

389

is a task-level variable that is stabilized by the nervous system during perturbation recovery. This

390

is consistent with the framework proposed by the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM),

391

which argues that the central nervous system allows for variability over a manifold of solutions

392

that all successfully stabilize a higher-level performance variable [35]. Here, WBAM would

393

serve as a high-level performance variable that is stabilized through covariation of elemental,

394

segmental-level momenta. For example, Papi et al. demonstrated a similar concept when they

395

found no differences between people post-stroke and healthy individuals in COM displacement

396

during the stance phase of walking despite between-group differences in lower extremity joint

397

kinematics [36]. Therefore, it is possible that when dynamic stability is challenged during

398

walking, the central nervous system carefully regulates WBAM while allowing variance in

399

lower-level, intersegmental coordination patterns.

400

In this study, we provided visual information about the desired and actual step lengths at

401

each foot-strike throughout all trials, including the perturbation and recovery steps. Participants

402

were encouraged to achieve the target step lengths for as many steps as possible, and therefore

403

participants may have relied on this feedback during perturbation recovery to return to their pre-

404

perturbation walking patterns faster than they otherwise would without visual feedback.

405

However, participants’ reactive response is unlikely to influence measures of momentum until

406

late into the first recovery step as the step length information was only shown after the foot-strike

407

of the first recovery step. It remains to be seen if patterns of interlimb coordination would differ

408

in the presence of asymmetries that are not guided by online visual feedback.

409

Although the reactive intersegmental coordination patterns were significantly different

410

from those observed during unperturbed locomotion, the overall patterns were qualitatively

411

similar across steps. Taken together, these results may reflect two keys aspects of coordination

412

during perturbed walking. First, the qualitative similarity between pre- and post-perturbation

413

patterns observed here and in previous work [21] may reflect the dominant coordination patterns

414

that characterize both unperturbed and perturbed bipedal walking. In contrast, the statistical

415

differences between pre- and post-perturbation coordination patterns may reflect the changes in

416

coordination necessary to maintain balance in response to perturbations. Patterns of

417

intersegmental coordination observed during responses to external perturbations during walking

418

likely capture a combination of passive limb dynamics, stereotypical pattern generation, and

419

reactive balance control responses [37].

420

We observed that the upper limbs’ contribution to the control of angular momentum in

421

the sagittal plane was negligible compared with lower limb segments during perturbation

422

recovery. Since a stepping response is sufficient to restore balance from the treadmill

423

accelerations used in this study, increases in momentum from the lower extremities may have

424

been sufficient to restore sagittal plane WBAM. Consistent with our findings, Pijnappels et al.

425

also found that arm movements had a small effect on body rotation in the sagittal plane during

426

tripping over obstacles which elicits excessive forward rotation similar to the current study [38].

427

However, during larger perturbations that trigger backward falls, the arms elevate to shift the

428

body’s center of mass back within the base of support [4]. This difference in the role of the arms

429

across studies of perturbation recovery may result from the use of a larger velocity and

430

displacement of the foot in the Marigold et al. [4] study. However, it remains to be seen how

431

systematic variation of the magnitude and direction of external perturbations influences the role

432

of the upper extremities during balance recovery.

433

Our results may also have implications for understanding the potential effects of

434

interventions designed to reduce gait asymmetries in people post-stroke, as this is a common

435

rehabilitation objective in this population [39]. Based on the current results, we would expect

436

that reducing asymmetry in people post-stroke would also affect their reactive control strategies.

437

However, further investigation is necessary to determine if reductions in asymmetry affect

438

interlimb coordination during reactions to perturbations. The data from the current study

439

illustrate how the intact neuromotor system modulates coordination between the upper and lower

440

extremities in response to changes in asymmetry, and these data could serve as useful reference

441

data to understand how sensorimotor impairments such as muscle weakness [40] and
