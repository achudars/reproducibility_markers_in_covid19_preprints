ABSTRACT
Carotid bodies are the sensory organs for detecting hypoxemia (decreased arterial blood oxygen
levels) and ensuing chemo reflex is a major regulator of breathing and blood pressure. Chang et
al (2015) proposed that olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78) plays a major role in hypoxic sensing by
the carotid body. However, such a possibility was questioned by a subsequent study ((TorresTorrelo et al. 2018). The discrepancy between the two reports prompted the present study to reexamine the role of Olfr78 in hypoxic sensing by the carotid body (CB). Studies were performed
on age and gender matched Olfr78 knock out mice generated on BL6 and JAX backgrounds and
corresponding wild type mice. Breathing was monitored by plethysmography in un-sedated and
efferent phrenic nerve activity in anesthetized mice. Carotid body sensory nerve activity was
determined ex vivo and [Ca2+]i responses were monitored in isolated glomus cells, the primary O2
sensing cells of the carotid body. Olfr78 null mice on both BL6 and JAX backgrounds exhibited
attenuated hypoxic ventilatory response, whereas breathing responses to CO2 were unaffected.
The magnitude of hyperoxia-induced depression of breathing (Dejour’s test), which is an indirect
measure of carotid body hypoxic sensing, was markedly reduced in Olfr78 mutant mice on both
background strains. Furthermore, carotid body sensory nerve and glomus cell [Ca2+]i responses
to hypoxia were attenuated in BL6 and JAX Olfr78 null mice. These results suggest that Olfr78
plays an important role in hypoxic sensing by the carotid body.

INTRODUCTION
Carotid bodies (CB) are the sensory organs for detecting decreased arterial blood O2
levels. Hypoxemia increases the CB sensory nerve activity, and triggers reflex stimulation of
breathing and blood pressure to ensure optimal oxygen delivery to tissues (Kumar and Prabhakar
2012). The CB is comprised of two major cell types; glomus or type I cells, which are of
neuronal lineage, and sustantecular or type II cells, resembling glial cells of the nervous system.
Glomus cells which are in synaptic contact with the afferent nerve ending are considered the
primary site of transduction of the hypoxic stimulus (Kumar and Prabhakar 2012). There is
considerable debate regarding the sensory transduction in glomus cells (Prabhakar, Peng and
Nanduri 2018, Kumar and Prabhakar 2012, Rakoczy and Wyatt 2017).
Olfactory receptors (OR) are G-protein coupled receptors for detecting smell sensation
(Schild and Restrepo 1998). Although ORs are originally described in olfactory neurons,
emerging evidence suggest that some ORs are also expressed in other tissues (Maßberg and Hatt
2018). Chang et al reported high abundance of Olfr 78 (also known as MOL2.3 and MOR 18-2)
gene expression in glomus cells of the mouse carotid body (Chang et al. 2015), a finding that
was subsequently confirmed using single cell mRNA analysis in neonatal mice (Zhou et al.
2016). Olfr78 knockout mice exhibit blunted CB sensory nerve excitation, [Ca2+]i elevation of
glomus cells by hypoxia and these effects were associated with reduced hypoxic ventilatory
response (HVR), which is a hallmark of the CB chemo reflex (Chang et al. 2015). However, a
subsequent study reported that HVR, [Ca2+]i and neurotransmitter secretory response of glomus
cells to hypoxia were unaffected in Olfr78 knockout mice, thereby questioning the role of Olfr78
signaling in the carotid body hypoxic sensing (Torres-Torrelo et al. 2018). The discrepancy
between the studies by Chang et al (2015) and Torres-Torrelo et al (2018) prompted us to reexamine the role of Olfr78 signaling in the CB response to hypoxia. Our results showed that

HVR monitored either in conscious or anesthetized mice were reduced in Olfr78 knockout mice.
The attenuated HVR was associated with impaired CB sensory nerve excitation in response to
graded hypoxia as well as hypoxia-evoked [Ca2+]i elevation in glomus cells. Our results suggest
that Olfr78 is an important component of the CB response to hypoxia.

METHODS
Preparation of Animals
Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Chicago. Experiments were performed on age-matched adult wild-type (WT)
and Olfr78 null mice on C57BL/6 background (BL6, gift from Dr. J. Pluznick, Johns Hopkins
University) and on 129P2/OlaHsd background (JAX, gift from Dr. A. Chang, The University of
California, San Francisco, UCSF).
Measurements of breathing
Whole body plethysmography- Ventilation was monitored by whole-body plethysmograph
(Buxco, DSI, St. Paul, MN), and O2 consumption and CO2 production were determined by the
open-circuit method in un-sedated mice as described (Peng et al. 2006). Ventilation was recorded
while the mice breathed 21% or 12% O2-balanced N2. Each gas challenge was given for 5 min.
O2 consumption and CO2 production were measured at the end of each 5-min challenge. For
determining ventilatory response to CO2, baseline ventilation was determined while mice
breathed 100% O2 followed by hypercapnic challenge with 5% CO2–95% O2–balance N2. Sighs,
sniffs, and movement-induced changes in breathing were monitored and excluded in the analysis.
All recordings were made at an ambient temperature of 25 ± 1 °C. Minute ventilation (VE =
Tidal volume, VT x respiratory rate, RR) was calculated and normalized for body weight and
expressed as ratio to O2 consumption (VE / VO2).
Measurements of efferent phrenic nerve activity- Mice were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal
injections of urethane (1.2g/kg). Supplemental doses (10% of the initial dose of anesthetic) were
given when corneal reflexes or responses to toe pinch were observed. Animals were placed on a
warm surgical board and a tracheotomy was performed through a midline neck incision. The

trachea was cannulated and mice were allowed to breathe spontaneously. Core body temperature
was monitored by a rectal thermistor probe and maintained at 37±1°C by a heating pad. The
phrenic nerve was isolated unilaterally at the level of the C3 and C4 spinal segments, cut distally,
and placed on bipolar stainless steel electrodes. Integrated efferent phrenic nerve activity was
monitored as an index of central respiratory neuronal output. The electrical activity was filtered
(band pass 0.3–1.0 kHz), amplified (P511K, Grass Instrument, West Warwick, RI), and passed
through Paynter filters (time constant of 100 ms; CWE Inc.) to obtain a moving average signal.
Data were collected and stored in the computer for further analysis (PowerLab/8P, AD
Instruments Pty Ltd, Australia). Phrenic nerve bursts/ min (index of respiratory rate, RR, tidal
phrenic nerve activity, and minute neuronal respiration (MNR = RR x tidal phrenic nerve
activity) were analyzed. The effects of hypoxia (12% O2 balanced nitrogen) and hypercapnia
(5% CO2 balanced 95% O2) on efferent phrenic nerve activity were determined. Gases were
administered through a needle placed in the tracheal cannula and gas flow was controlled by a
flow meter. For hypoxic response, baseline phrenic nerve activity was monitored while the
animals breathed room air for 3 min. Subsequently, inspired gas was switched to 12% O2 for
3min. The duration of 3min for hypoxia was chosen because longer duration of hypoxic
exposure (> 5min) in anesthetized mice leads to hypotension which confounds interpretation of
results. For hypercapnic response, 3 min of 5% CO2 balanced 95% O2 was preceded by exposure
to 100% O2 for 3 min. At the end of the experiment, mice were killed by overdose of urethane
(>3.6 g/kg, i.p.).
Hyperoxic Challenge (Dejours test)
These experiments were performed on anesthetized mice. Baseline neural respiration (efferent
phrenic nerve activity) was recorded while animals breathed 21% O2 for 45 sec followed by

100% O2 for 20 sec. Respiratory variables were analyzed during 21% O2 breathing and during
the last 15 sec of hyperoxia (the initial 5 sec was excluded because of the dead space).
Recording of CB sensory nerve activity
Sensory nerve activity from CB ex vivo was recorded as previously described (Peng et al. 2006).
Briefly, CBs along with the sinus nerves were harvested from anaesthetized mice, placed in a
recording chamber (volume, 250μl) and superfused with warm physiological saline (35°C) at a
rate of 3 ml/ minute. The composition of the medium was (mM): NaCl, 125; KCl, 5; CaCl2,1.8;
MgSO4,2; NaH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 25; D-Glucose, 10; Sucrose, 5. The solution was bubbled
with 21% O2/5% CO2.

Hypoxic/hypercapnic challenges were achieved by switching the

perfusate to physiological saline equilibrated with desired levels of O2. To facilitate recording of
clearly identifiable action potentials, the sinus nerve was treated with 0.1% collagenase for 5
min. Action potentials (1–3 active units) were recorded from one of the nerve bundles with a
suction electrode and stored in a computer via a data acquisition system (PowerLab/8P). ‘Single’
units were selected based on the height and duration of the individual action potentials using the
spike discrimination module. Oxygen level of the superfusate medium in the chamber was
continuously monitored with a platinum electrode placed next to the CB using a polarographic
amplifier (Model 1900, A-M Systems, Sequim, WA).
Primary cultures of glomus cells
Primary cultures of glomus cells were prepared as described previously (Makarenko et al. 2012).
Briefly, CBs were harvested from urethane (1.2 g/kg, I.P.) anesthetized mice. Glomus cells were
dissociated using a mixture of collagenase P (2 mg/ml; Roche, USA), DNase (15μg/ml; Sigma,
USA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA; 3 mg/ml; Sigma, USA) at 37°C for 20 min, followed by
a 15 min incubation in medium containing DNase (30μg/ml) only. Cells were plated on collagen

(type VII; Sigma)-coated cover slips and maintained at 37°C in a 7% CO2 + 20% O2 incubator
for overnight (~18h). The growth medium consisted of F-12K medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS-X; Invitrogen), and
1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine mixture (Invitrogen).
Measurements of [Ca 2+]i
Glomus cells were incubated in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with 2μM fura-2-AM and
1mg/ml albumin for 30 min and then washed in a fura-2-free solution for 30 min at 37°C. The
cover slip was transferred to an experimental chamber for determining the changes in [Ca2+]i.
Background fluorescence at 340nm and 380 nm wavelengths was obtained from an area of the
cover slip that was devoid of cells. On each cover slip, glomus cells were identified by their
characteristic clustering and individual cells were imaged. Image pairs (one at 340nm and the
other at 380nm wavelength, respectively) were obtained every 2s by averaging 16 frames at each
wavelength. Data were continuously collected throughout the experiment. Background
fluorescence was subtracted from the cell data obtained at the individual wavelengths. The image
obtained at 340nm was divided by the 380nm image to obtain ratiometric image. Ratios were
converted to free [Ca2+]i using calibration curves constructed in vitro by adding fura-2 (50μM
free acid) to solutions containing known concentrations of Ca2+ (0 –2000 nM). The recording
chamber was continually superfused with warm solution (31°C) from gravity-fed reservoirs. The
composition of the medium was the same as that employed for recording CB sensory activity
described above.
Data analysis
The following variables were analyzed in un-anaesthetized mice: tidal volume (VT; μl);
respiratory rate (RR/min); minute ventilation (VE; ml/min∙g body weight); O2 consumption (VO2;
ml/ min); CO2 production (VCO2; ml/min). In agreement with other investigators (Tankersley,

Fitzgerald and Kleeberger 1994, Dauger et al. 1998, Tankersley et al. 1993), we also found that
breathing is unstable in un-sedated mice due to movement, sniffing and exploratory behaviors.
Therefore, 15-20 consecutive stable breaths per minute were chosen for analysis of respiratory
variables during breathing room air and during 5 min of inspired O2 and CO2 challenges. VT and
VE were normalized to the body weight of the animals. Each data point represents the average of
two trials in a given animal for a given gas challenge. In anaesthetized animals, the following
respiratory variables were analyzed: respiratory rate (RR; phrenic bursts per minute), amplitude
of the integrated tidal phrenic nerve activity (a.u., arbitrary units) and minute neural respiration
(MNR) (number of phrenic bursts per min, RR × amplitude of the integrated tidal phrenic nerve
activity, a.u.). CB sensory activity (discharge from ‘single’ units) was averaged during 3 min of
baseline and during the 3 min of gas challenge and expressed as impulses per second unless
otherwise stated. All data are presented as Box-Whisker plots with individual data points, unless
otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by either Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test or
two‐way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by Tukey's test. P values < 0.05 were
considered significant.

RESULTS
Impaired hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in Olfr78 null mice
In the first series of experiments, breathing was monitored by plethysmography in unsedated mice. Examples of the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and summary data of
VE/VO2 in both WT and Olfr78 null mice (on BL6 and JAX backgrounds) as percentage of
normoxia is presented in Fig. 1 A-D. Absolute values of respiratory changes and metabolic
variables (

,) are given in Table 1A and B. Baseline breathing (21% O2) was

comparable between WT and Olfr78 null mice (BL6 and JAX background strains). Minute
ventilation presented as VE/VO2, a measure of convective requirement, increased in response to
12% O2 in WT mice, which was primarily due to increased respiratory rate (Fig.1 A-D; Table 1
a-b). The magnitude of HVR was significantly attenuated in Olfr78 null mice on both BL6 and
JAX backgrounds (Fig.1 A-D; Table 1 a-b).
In the second series of experiments, efferent phrenic nerve activity was monitored as an
index of respiratory neuronal output in anesthetized mice. Examples of neural breathing
responses to hypoxia (12% O2) in WT and Olfr78 null mice on BL6 and JAX background and
summary data of minute neural respiration during hypoxia are presented in Figure 2 A-D. WT
mice showed increased minute neural respiration during hypoxia, which was due to increased
phrenic burst frequency (RR) as well as tidal phrenic amplitude and these responses were
markedly attenuated in Olfr78 null mice (Fig.2 A-D).
In contrast, WT and Olfr78 null mice (BL6 and JAX background) responded to
hypercapnia (5% CO2) with comparable increases in breathing measured either by
plethysmography (Fig. 3 A-D) or by efferent phrenic nerve activity (Fig. 4 A-D).

Assessment of carotid body function in Olfr78 null mice
The magnitude of the transient depression of breathing in response to a brief hyperoxic
exposure is considered as an index of peripheral chemoreceptor, especially the CB sensitivity to
O2 (Dejours 1962). Phrenic nerve activity was monitored in anesthetized mice for 45sec while
breathing room air and then for 20 sec after a hyperoxic challenge (100% O2). As compared with
Olfr78 null mice (BL6 and JAX backgrounds), wild-type mice manifested a significantly greater
depression of minute neural respiration in response to hyperoxia (Fig. 5 A-D).
To further establish the effects of hypoxia, CBs were isolated from mutant mice on both
BL6 and JAX backgrounds as well as corresponding wild-type mice, and the carotid sinus nerve
activity was recorded ex vivo. CBs were challenged with graded hypoxia. Examples illustrating
the effect of hypoxia (pO2 ~40 mmHg) in Olfr 78 (BL6 and JAX backgrounds) and the
corresponding wild-type mice are shown in Fig. 6 A-B and average data of CB sensory responses
to graded hypoxia are presented in Fig. 6 C-D. The magnitude of sensory nerve response at given
pO2 was significantly less in Olfr78 null CBs on both BL6 and JAX backgrounds as compared to
corresponding wild-type CBs (Fig. 6 C-D).
[Ca2+] i responses of glomus cells to hypoxia
We next determined whether Olfr78 is required for [Ca2+]i response of glomus cells to
hypoxia. Studies were conducted on glomus cells isolated from wild type and Olfr78 mutant
mice on BL6 and JAX backgrounds, and were maintained overnight (∼18 h) in a growth
medium. For these experiments, we chose pO2~ 30 mmHg because severe hypoxia (pO2 < 30
mmHg) produces markedly reduced sensory nerve excitation(Peng et al. 2019).
Hypoxia increased [Ca2+]i in wild-type glomus cells and this effect was attenuated in
Olfr78 mutant mice raised either on BL6 or JAX background (Fig. 7A-D). In contrast, [Ca2+]i

elevation produced by 40mM KCl, a non-selective depolarizing stimulus were comparable
between wild-type and Olfr78 null glomus cells (Fig. 7 A-D).

DISCUSSION
Consistent with the findings of Chang et al (Chang et al. 2015), we also found attenuated
HVR, a hallmark of the CB chemo reflex, in un-sedated Olfr78 null mice as measured by whole
body plethysmography. The reduced HVR was primarily due to attenuated respiratory rate rather
than tidal volume and is reflected in minute ventilation which was normalized to body weight as
well as oxygen consumption (VO2), the later a measure of convective requirement. Such an
attenuated HVR was evident in Olfr78 null mice both on BL6 and JAX background strains
(Table 1), thereby negating any potential confounding influence of background strains. These
observations differ from those reported by (Torres-Torrelo et al. 2018),

who monitored

integrated respiratory rate as a measure of breathing in un-sedated mice. However, we found it is
technically not possible to integrate respiratory rate in un-sedated mice, because of highly
unstable breathing arising from sniffing and exploratory behavior, which was also reported by
other investigators (Tankersley et al. 1994, Dauger et al. 1998, Tankersley et al. 1993). Because
of the unstable breathing, it was necessary to choose segments of 15-20 consecutive breaths of
stable breathing every minute for analyzing breathing during baseline and during hypoxia in unsedated mice.
One might argue that our analysis of HVR is biased because of the choice of stable
breaths. To circumvent this limitation, we further analyzed HVR by monitoring efferent phrenic
nerve activity as an index of breathing in anesthetized mice. Our results showed a clear
attenuation of HVR in anesthetized Olfr 78 null as compared to wild-type mice. Attenuated HVR
in anesthetized Olfr 78 null mice is due to both reduced tidal volume as well as the respiratory
rate as opposed to attenuated respiratory rate in un-sedated mice. Remarkably, stimulation of
breathing by CO2 was unaffected in Olfr78 null mice measured either by plethysmography or by

efferent nerve activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate selective impairment of HVR,
which is a hallmark of the CB chemo reflex, in mice lacking Olfr78.
It is well established that depression of breathing evoked by brief hyperoxia is an indirect
measure of peripheral chemo receptor sensitivity to oxygen both in humans (Dejours 1962), and
in experimental animals (Kline et al. 1998). Olfr 78 null mice (both on BL6 and JAX
background) displayed remarkable attenuation of breathing depression by hyperoxia, suggesting
impaired peripheral chemo receptor, possibly CB sensitivity to O2. To further establish the
effects of Olfr78 deficiency on CB function, we directly monitored the CB sensory nerve
responses to graded hypoxia. It is clear from our results, CB sensory nerve response to any given
pO2 is markedly attenuated in Olfr78 generated both on BL6 or JAX backgrounds. Consistent
with the response of the CB sensory nerve activity, hypoxia-evoked [Ca2+]i elevation of glomus
cells is also impaired in Olfr78 null mice, whereas [Ca2+]i elevation evoked by KCl, a nonselective depolarizing stimulus was unaffected. These findings are consistent with the earlier
observations by Chang et al. (Chang et al. 2015), and demonstrate that Olfr78 is an important
component of the CB hypoxic sensing pathway.
In striking contrast to present observations, Torres-Torrelo et al found that hypoxiaevoked [Ca2+]i elevation was unaffected in Olfr78 null glomus cells (Torres-Torrelo et al. 2018).
A major difference between our study and by Torres-Torrelo et al (Torres-Torrelo et al. 2018) is
the severity of hypoxia used for evoking [Ca2+]i elevation in glomus cells. Torres-Torrelo et al
used 10-15 mmHg pO2(Torres-Torrelo et al. 2018), whereas we employed pO2 of ~30 mmHg.
We recently reported that severe hypoxia (i.e., below pO2 of 30mmHg) although evokes [Ca2+]i
elevation in glomus cells but produces only a weak stimulation of the CB sensory nerve activity
and depress breathing rather than stimulation (Peng et al. 2019). Therefore, we employed a

medium pO2 of ~30 mmHg for eliciting Ca2+]I response of glomus cells, which produces robust
CB sensory nerve excitation (Fig. 6), which is an essential pre-requisite for triggering reflex
stimulation of breathing. It follows that Olfr78 play an important role in the CB excitation to a
physiologically relevant hypoxia but not to near anoxic stimulus.
