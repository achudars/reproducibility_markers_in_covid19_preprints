Abstract
The Atlantis Massif rises 4,000 m above the seafloor near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and
consists of rocks uplifted from Earth's upper mantle. Exposure of the mantle rocks to
25

seawater leads to their alteration into serpentinites. These aqueous geochemical
reactions, collectively known as the process of serpentinization, are exothermic and
are associated with the release of hydrogen gas (H2), methane (CH4), and small
organic molecules. The biological consequences of this flux of energy and organic
compounds from the Atlantis Massif were explored by International Ocean Discovery

30

Program (IODP) Expedition 357, which used seabed drills to collect continuous
sequences of shallow (<16 meters below seafloor) marine serpentinites and mafic
assemblages. Here, we report the first census of microbial diversity in samples of the
drill cores, as measured by environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
The problem of contamination of subsurface samples was a primary concern during

35

all stages of this project, starting from the initial study design, continuing to the
collection of samples from the seafloor, handling the samples shipboard and in the
lab, preparing the samples for DNA extraction, and analyzing the DNA sequence
data. To distinguish endemic microbial taxa of serpentinite subsurface rocks from
seawater residents and other potential contaminants, the distributions of individual

40

16S rRNA gene sequences among all samples were evaluated, taking into
consideration both presence/absence as well as relative abundances. Our results
highlight a few candidate residents of the shallow serpentinite subsurface, including
uncultured representatives of the Thermoplasmata, Acidobacteria, Acidimicrobiia,
and Chloroflexi.

Importance
International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 357: “Serpentinization and Life”
utilized seabed drills for the first time to collect rocks from the oceanic crust. The
recovered rock cores represent the shallow serpentinite subsurface of the Atlantis
50

Massif, where reactions between uplifted mantle rocks and water, collectively known
as serpentinization, produce environmental conditions that can stimulate biological
activity and are thought to be analogous to environments that were prevalent on the
early Earth and perhaps other planets. The methodology and results of this project
have implications for life detection experiments, including sample return missions,

55

and provide the first window into the diversity of microbial communities inhabiting
subseafloor serpentinites.

Introduction
Subsurface environments may host the majority of microbial life on Earth (1, 2), but
60

current estimates of subsurface biomass lack certainty due to a paucity of
observations. Recent studies, including major ocean drilling expeditions, have
greatly improved the quantification and characterization of microbial populations in
deep marine sediments (3–6). Seafloor crustal rocks are also expected to be an
important microbial habitat, in part because a significant fraction of the oceanic crust

65

supports hydrothermal circulation of seawater that can bring nutrients and energy
into subseafloor ecosystems (7–9). The mineral composition and geological history
of the host rocks determine the local environmental conditions experienced by
subseafloor microbes (10–13). Ultramafic habitats for life may have unique

attributes, as these rock types are unstable in the presence of seawater and undergo
70

a series of serpentinization reactions that can support chemolithotrophy (14–16). A
few microbial diversity surveys of mafic basaltic and gabbroic seafloor rocks have
been conducted (17–19), but no studies have characterized the microbial diversity of
ultramafic rocks.

75

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357 addressed this
knowledge gap by targeting the Atlantis Massif, a submarine mountain located in the
north Atlantic Ocean on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (20, 21). The
massif is approximately 16 km across and rises 4,267 m from the seafloor. It is
composed of variable amounts of ultramafic rocks uplifted from the upper mantle

80

along a major fault and altered into serpentinites through the geochemical process of
serpentinization (22, 23). Oxidation of iron minerals in the serpentinizing rocks
results in the release of hydrogen gas and hydroxyl ions, contributing to the
formation of extremely reducing, high pH fluids (24, 25). The high hydrogen
concentrations that develop during serpentinization are conducive to the formation of

85

methane and other organic compounds from the reduction of inorganic carbon (26–
28). Circulation of organic-rich fluids through the serpentinites of the Atlantis Massif
may support an active subseafloor ecosystem (29).

Most of our current knowledge of the biological implications of marine
90

serpentinization comes from the exploration of the Lost City hydrothermal field, a
collection of carbonate chimneys near the summit of the Atlantis Massif where high
pH fluids exit the seafloor (22, 25, 30, 31). The chimneys are covered in
mucilaginous biofilms formed by bacteria and archaea that are fueled by the high

concentrations of hydrogen, formate, and methane in the venting fluids (32–35). The
95

high density of the microbial biofilm communities is likely enabled by the mixing of
warm, anoxic hydrothermal fluids with oxygenated ambient seawater, enabling a
wide range of metabolic strategies. In contrast, the much more voluminous, rocky
subsurface habitats underlying the Lost City chimneys and throughout the Atlantis
Massif probably experience much more diffuse hydrothermal circulation and perhaps

100

limited exposure to ambient seawater. Our knowledge of this subseafloor
environment, however, is extremely limited (19).

The work reported here focused on two fundamental questions regarding
serpentinization and life: How can we distinguish endemic microbial communities of
105

low biomass subseafloor rocks from other environments? Which microbes inhabit
marine serpentinites? To address these questions, we conducted a cultivationindependent census of microbial diversity in the shallow (<16 mbsf) rocks collected
during IODP Expedition 357 (21) and compared these to the communities found in
seawater and potential sources of contamination.

110
Laboratory contamination of DNA sequencing datasets is a well-known problem (36–
39), especially for low biomass subsurface samples (19, 40–42), that must be
addressed by a combination of experimental and computational methods. No matter
how cleanly DNA is prepared, contaminant sequences can appear for a myriad of
115

reasons (37)(38). Sheik et al. (39) recently reviewed practices for identifying
contaminants in DNA sequence datasets, highlighting the importance of collecting
and sequencing control samples representing potential sources of environmental
and laboratory contamination. These studies have highlighted the need to

complement careful laboratory protocols with computational methods that can
120

distinguish true residents from multiple potential environmental and laboratory
contaminants (43–45).

Here we report our methodological and computational strategies for minimizing and
identifying contaminants in DNA sequencing datasets from extremely low-biomass
125

seafloor serpentinites collected during IODP Expedition 357. Sequencing DNA from
serpentinites required the development of a novel DNA extraction and purification
protocol that recovers highly pure DNA without the use of any commercial kits or
phenol. We then identified environmental and laboratory contaminants in the
resulting DNA sequencing data with a computational workflow that considers the

130

relative abundances of individual sequences among potential contamination sources.
Finally, we describe the archaeal and bacterial taxa that are potential residents of
seafloor serpentinites.

Results

DNA Yields from Rocks
DNA was extracted from at least one rock core sample collected from all sites
(Figure 1, Text S1) except M0073 (Table 1, Data set S1). DNA yields from lysates
(post-lysis, pre-purification) ranged from ~100 to almost 500 ng of DNA per gram of
rock sample. DNA yields from serpentinite and non-serpentinite rocks (including

140

metagabbro, carbonate sand, basalt breccia and metadolerite) were similar (Table 1
and Data set S2). These values may be inflated by the many impurities in the
lysates, which had not been purified and were visibly cloudy. No trends in DNA yield
with respect to mineralogy or locations of the boreholes were apparent. During initial

testing of the protocol, DNA quantification was conducted at each step of the
145

extraction to verify that DNA levels never increased, which would indicate laboratory
contamination. For the precious serpentinite samples, however, DNA was quantified
only after lysis, washing, and the final purification. DNA was below the detection limit
for all final, purified preparations, indicating a substantial loss of DNA from the
lysates but also minimal laboratory contamination.

150
DNA Sequencing Results
Despite the below-detection levels of purified DNA, a total of 1,125,191 sequencing
read pairs of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained from all rock samples (50 samples
including sequencing duplicates). Here we focus only on the DNA sequencing results
155

from the 15 samples characterized as serpentinites, but the DNA sequencing data
from all samples are included in our SRA BioProject PRJNA575221. At least 2,780
read pairs were obtained from each sample, and >10,000 read pairs were obtained
from five of the serpentinite rock samples (Table 1). We identified 2,063 amplicon
sequence variants (ASVs) among all rock samples, 664 of which were found only in

160

serpentinites. We obtained 27,524,256 read pairs from the water samples (76
samples of surface, shallow, and deep including sequencing duplicates) (Data set
S3), from which we identified 15,142 ASVs. Six samples of lab air yielded 66,846
read pairs and 293 ASVs (Data set S4), despite below-detection levels of purified
DNA.

165
The proportional abundances of all 17,081 unique ASVs among all rock, water, and
air samples were used to calculate the community dissimilarity between each pair of
samples. The results are visualized in the non-metric multidimensional scaling

170

The bacterial communities of both serpentinite (orange points) and non-serpentinite
(yellow points) rock samples are highly variable and are not consistently distinct from
each other. The bacterial compositions of lab air samples (green points) overlap with
those of the rock samples in this visualization.

175

Evaluation of Contamination Sources
To evaluate contamination in the serpentinites, we used SourceTracker2 (45) to
estimate the proportion of each rock sample's DNA sequences that could be
attributed to contamination from water or air. These results show that very few of the
DNA sequences in serpentinites can be traced back to seawater (Figure 3). The

180

number of sequences attributed to air was highly variable among the serpentinites,
from nearly zero to >50% of total sequences. Most serpentinite samples were
dominated by sequences that could not be attributed to a single source by
SourceTracker2. These ASVs are designated as having an "unknown" source and
may represent true inhabitants of the serpentinites or may be derived from another

185

source that was not sampled in this study. Based on these results, serpentinite
samples with >15% of sequences attributed to lab air were excluded from further
analyses (0AMRd014A, 031C, 033A, 033C, 034A, 036A, 045B, 067C, 071A, and
073A).

190

SourceTracker2 computes probabilistic estimates of how the whole-community
composition of samples relate to each other, but it is not designed to identify the
source of each taxon. For example, multiple ASVs in sample 0AMRd057A occurred
in both air and water samples, which some approaches would consider to be

evidence of contamination, even though SourceTracker2 estimated that <1% of
195

sequences in this sample could be assigned to water or air sources (Figure 3).
Therefore, we explored other methods for the identification of individual ASVs as
contaminants.

Identification of Contaminants from Air and Seawater
200

Of the 293 ASVs detected in air samples, 187 also occurred in serpentinites and
were therefore designated as contaminants (Figure 4A). Thus, all remaining ASVs
were absent in air and were only detected in water and serpentinite samples. Next,
two approaches, simple overlap (SO) and differential abundance (DA), were used in
parallel to distinguish the serpentinite ASVs from the water ASVs. In the SO

205

approach (Figure 4B), the ASVs shared between water and serpentinite samples
were removed from the dataset regardless of their abundances in water or
serpentinites (i.e. only considering presence/absence). Thus, the results from the SO
approach include only those ASVs that are exclusively found in serpentinite samples
(664 ASVs).

210
In the differential abundance (DA) approach (Figure 4C), the sequence counts (i.e.
the number of merged paired reads) of each ASV shared between water and
serpentinite samples were compared. ASVs that were significantly more abundant in
water samples compared to serpentinites were identified and then removed from the
215

dataset (Table S3). In this case, ASVs that are highly abundant in serpentinites and
very rare (but still present) in water are not necessarily identified as contaminants, as
they were in the SO approach. Three edgeR comparisons were performed between
serpentinite samples and each depth category of water samples (serpentinites vs.

surface, serpentinites vs. shallow, and serpentinites vs. deep). The ASVs that were
220

more abundant in each group of water samples (one example in Figure 4C) were
designated as contaminants from water and excluded from further analyses. The
ASVs identified as water contaminants and detected in serpentinites are listed in
Data set S5. The DA approach results in a final list of 684 ASVs putatively
considered to be true inhabitants of serpentinites (Data set S6), including 20

225

additional ASVs compared to the SO approach. Seven of these 20 ASVs were
present at >100 counts in serpentinite samples and less than a total of 53 counts in
all water samples (Data set S7).

Taxonomic Composition of Serpentinites
230

To conservatively report a shorter list of likely serpentinite inhabitants, the following
analyses and visualizations only include ASVs with at least 100 total counts among
all samples. Taxonomic classifications of the putative serpentinite ASVs from the SO
approach are summarized in Figure 5. For clarity, the taxonomic classifications of
only the top 50 most abundant ASVs are shown, and more information about these

235

50 ASVs is provided in Data set S7. The taxonomic compositions of serpentinite
samples are variable, consistent with the spread of serpentinites shown in the NMDS
plot (Figure 2).

No significant differences with respect to sample handling

(flamed/unflamed, shaved/unshaved, washed/unwashed) could be detected. Indeed,
very few similarities between any two samples were apparent.
240
Sample 0AMRd057A (Figure 6) provided the deepest sequencing dataset (98,462
merged paired reads among those ASVs with at least 100 counts). Most of the
taxonomic diversity in this sample was represented by rare ASVs (i.e. those with

lower abundance than the top 50 shown in Figure 5). The most abundant ASV was
245

classified as family Thermoplasmatales (phylum Euryarchaeota) and has 99%
identity to a clone (NCBI accession number: AB825685, Data set S7) from a deepsea sediment core in the Okinawa Trough (46). Two of the top ASVs in this sample
were classified as two different classes of Chloroflexi (S085 and Anaerolineae), each
of which was unique to sample 0AMRd057A and was most similar to clones from

250

marine sediments (AM998115; HQ721355). Another top ASV unique to this sample
was classified as Acidimicrobia clade OM1 (phylum Actinobacteria), which was
nearly identical to a clone from a marine endolithic community (47). Two ASVs in
0AMRd057A were classified as Acidobacteria Subgroup 21 and were most similar to
sequences from marine sediments, including a clone (KY977768) from altered rocks

255

of the Mariana subduction zone, where serpentinization also occurs (48).

The deepest sequencing datasets of the remaining samples were obtained from
0AMRd045A, 0AMRd072A, 0AMRd075A, and 0AMRd076A, which were collected
from the sites closest to the Lost City chimneys (boreholes M0072B and M0076B;

serpentinization (49). However, the genus Dechloromonas has also been detected
on human skin (50).
270
Sample 0AMRd030A is dominated by two ASVs classified as genera Acidovorax
(class Betaproteobacteria) and Cobetia (class Gammaproteobacteria), respectively.
The Acidovorax ASV matches sequences from soil (e.g. CP021359) and an anoxic
lake (KY515689)(51). Cobetia marina (previously Halomonas marina) is a ubiquitous
275

marine bacterium (52) and also a model organism for the study of biofouling due to
its ability to grow as a biofilm on a variety of surfaces (53).

Other abundant ASVs shown in Figure 5 and listed in Data set S7 include those
classified as Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes,
280

and Ktedonobacteria, and these sequences were generally most similar to
environmental sequences from soils or freshwater. One possible exception is an
ASV that was abundant in sample 0AMRd031A and was classified as genus
Modestobacter, a soil bacterium, but it was also identical to another species in the
same family, Klenkia marina, which was isolated from marine sediment

285

(NR_156810).

Discussion
Serpentinite samples have minimal environmental contamination
Sequencing of environmental DNA from seafloor rocks is challenging due to their
290

very low biomass and their abundance of minerals (e.g. phyllosilicates) that inhibit
enzymatic reactions and bind DNA (54–56). The extremely low biomass of seafloor
rocks also makes them susceptible to environmental and laboratory contamination.

Many precautions were taken during handling of the rock core samples to minimize,
eliminate, and detect contamination, and our results agree with previous reports that
295

these efforts were generally successful (20, 57, 58).

To assess environmental contamination of the cores, perfluoromethylcyclohexane
(PFC) was injected into the seabed drilling fluids during coring. Orcutt et al. (57)
reported that the interior zones of rocks whose outer surfaces had been shaved off
300

with a sterile rock saw had greatly reduced levels of PFC. Only one sample in our
study (0AMRd073), whose exterior had been shaved, contained detectable levels of
PFC. Two additional samples (0AMRd030, 0AMRd036), which were too rubbly to be
shaved with the rock saw and were instead washed with ultrapure water, contained
detectable PFC. In general, however, washing rubbly samples with ultrapure water

305

was largely effective in reducing the level of PFC, and presumably of any other
surface contamination (57). The PFC tracer, however, was not designed to track any
seawater contamination that might have occurred after drilling or any contamination
that might have resulted from handling the rock cores shipboard or in the laboratory.

310

We assessed environmental contamination of the serpentinites by sequencing DNA
from samples of seawater collected above the boreholes. The contribution of
seawater DNA sequences into the serpentinites was minimal (Figure 3), further
demonstrating that the sampling-handling precautions on the ship and at the Kochi
Core Center were successful in eliminating environmental contamination that must

315

have occurred at some level during core recovery on the seafloor. In addition, our
results agree with those of Orcutt et al. (57) that there was no noticeable difference

in contamination levels between rocks whose outer surfaces had been subjected to
flame sterilization compared to those that were not flamed.

320

Serpentinite samples have minimal environmental DNA
Our yields of ~200 ng of DNA per g of rock sample in the crude lysates (Table 1)
were much higher than expected from the previously reported numbers of cells for
these serpentinites (20), all of which were only slightly greater than the quantification
limit of ~10 cells cm-3. Such a cell density would predict 20 fg of DNA cm-3 (assuming

325

2 fg of DNA per cell), which is approximately 7 orders of magnitude less DNA than
observed. Therefore, the total environmental DNA must have been primarily
extracellular. Nearly all of the DNA was lost during purification and fell below our
detection limit, so much of it was probably highly fragmented. Indeed, neither the
filtration units used for washing nor the electrophoretic purification method are

330

expected to recover DNA below 600 bp.

Our lowest detection limit of purified DNA (which was concentrated from many
parallel extractions of 30-40 grams of rock per sample) was 0.05 ng per gram of
rock, which is still 10,000 times greater than that expected from the cell numbers.
335

However, amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in the environmental DNA was
moderately successful, most likely thanks to the elimination of PCR inhibitors by the
electrophoretic SCODA purification. Because of the exceedingly low levels of input
DNA, the probability of contamination during purification, PCR, and sequencing was
very high. Indeed, laboratory contamination was evident in the serpentinites, as

340

represented by their relatively high proportions of DNA sequences from samples of
our laboratory's air (Figure 3).

Identification of laboratory contaminants
We identified laboratory contaminants as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that
345

occurred in samples of both air and serpentinites. This simple overlap (SO) approach
is commonly used in environmental microbiology studies to remove all sequences (or
taxonomic categories) that are shared between any sources of contamination and
the sample of interest (39). This approach can be useful for removing ASVs from
obvious sources of contamination. An important assumption of the SO approach is

350

that the direction of contamination is from the suspected contamination source into
the sample. However, this assumption is often untested. For example, if a low-DNA
control sample is handled in close proximity (e.g. the same 96-well plate) to a highDNA environmental sample, it may be more likely for "contamination" to occur from
the environmental sample into the control sample. Subsequent use of the SO

355

approach would erroneously identify an abundant member of the environmental
sample as a laboratory contaminant.

We considered the possibility of "reverse contamination" from our core samples into
our air samples to be unlikely for multiple reasons. First, most of the processing of
360

the rock samples, including sawing, crushing, washing, and subsampling, occurred
at the Kochi Core Center in Japan, and our samples of air were collected in our
laboratory at the University of Utah. Second, our SourceTracker2 results implicated
air as a major source of DNA into the serpentinites (Figure 3). Third, nearly all of the
taxa detected in the air samples are typically associated with humans (e.g.

365

Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter). Our list of laboratory air taxa (Data
set S4) may be useful for identifying contaminants in future studies, as a

complement to previously reported lists of contaminants from laboratory reagents
(37–39).

Identification of environmental contaminants
Identification of environmental contaminants from seawater into the serpentinites
was more complex because of the greater possibility of mixing between seawater
and rocks in both directions. The Lost City chimneys provide dramatic evidence of
the flux of biological material from the rocky subsurface into ambient seawater (25),

375

and flux from the boreholes in this study was also evident by the release of bubbles
during drilling (20). Deep seawater near the Atlantis Massif cannot be assumed to be
completely free of subsurface inhabitants, and samples of seawater at shallower
depths or locations far removed from the Atlantis Massif would not be accurate
representations of the environmental contamination that the serpentinite samples

380

experienced during recovery on the seafloor. Therefore, the relative abundances of
taxa in samples of deep seawater and serpentinites should be informative because
true subsurface organisms that are mixed into ambient seawater should be
immediately diluted and present in seawater only at very low abundances.

385

In such situations of environmental mixing, the SO approach can erroneously identify
contaminants because it ignores abundance information. We identified at least one
such example in our study by comparing the results of the SO approach with the
differential abundance (DA) approach. An ASV classified as Acidobacteria Subgroup
21 occurred 264 times in a serpentinite sample (0AMRd057A; 0.3% of total

390

sequence counts in that sample) from borehole M0075 and also occurred a total of
12 times among five deep seawater samples collected from above boreholes M0068,

M0072, and M0073 (Data set S6). The ASV was identical to several sequences from
marine sediments as well as one from altered rocks of the Mariana subduction zone

(EU491098)(17).

This was the most striking example in our study, but there were 19 additional ASVs
flagged as contaminants by the SO approach but not by the DA approach. This
relatively small difference (664 compared to 684 total ASVs in serpentinites) is
400

probably a consequence of the success in minimizing and eliminating environmental
contamination during handling of the rock cores, as discussed above and
demonstrated by the minimal level of contamination from seawater shown in Figure
3. Differences between the SO and DA approaches are likely to be greater in studies
where environmental contamination cannot be controlled so carefully.

405
Identification of contaminants by taxonomy
After removal of DNA sequences identified as contaminants from seawater and air,
the most abundant serpentinite ASVs (Data set S6) still contained many taxa that
seemed unlikely to be true inhabitants of the subseafloor. Some are typically
410

associated with animal digestive tracts (e.g. Ruminiclostridium), some are found in
soil (e.g. various Acidobacteria), and others have been previously identified as
reagent contaminants (e.g. Micrococcus)(37, 38). The sources of these likely
contaminants could not be determined in this study, but the extraction and
sequencing reagents are strong candidates, even though we took great care in

415

preparation of our own reagents at every step and did not use any commercial
extraction or purification kits. Also, we only sampled and sequenced DNA from the

17

air in our own laboratory at the University of Utah and did not sample the air inside
the research vessel, the Kochi Core Center, or the DNA sequencing core facility at
Michigan State University.
420
Identification of contaminants at the level of taxonomic category is risky, however,
because organisms that are capable of persisting in the extreme environments of
mostly sterile laboratory supplies, may also be capable of inhabiting the extreme
environments of mostly sterile subsurface rocks (59). For example, a relatively
425

abundant serpentinite ASV that was absent in all seawater and air samples is
nevertheless a suspected contaminant because it was classified as Acidovorax, a
ubiquitous soil bacterium and plant pathogen that has also been identified as a
contaminant in laboratory reagents (38). The ability of Acidovorax to form biofilms
and perform anaerobic iron oxidation (60), however, would be advantageous in the

430

serpentinite subsurface. Because we are suspicious of these taxa but lack direct
experimental evidence of a source other than serpentinites, we include these ASVs
in our final tables but flag them as suspected contaminants (Data set S7).

Putative inhabitants of the serpentinite subsurface
435

Excluding all air and seawater ASVs and ignoring all suspicious taxa leaves us with
a few putative inhabitants of subseafloor serpentinites (Data set S7). Many of the
these ASVs were unique to a single serpentinite sample shown in Figure 6A. This
serpentinite was recovered from the most eastern site (borehole M0075A) at a depth
of ~60 cm below the seafloor, and it had extensive talc-amphibole alteration,

440

suggesting that it was eroded from the central dome during uplift of the massif. The

Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria, all of which matched DNA sequences previously
found in marine sediments and rocks. The most abundant ASV was classified as
Thermoplasmatales (an order within the Euryarchaeota) and was nearly identical to
445

a clone from hydrothermal sediment collected during IODP Expedition 331 to the
Mid-Okinawa Trough (46). Most, but not all, of the characterized members of the
Thermoplasmatales are thermophilic, and they are typically involved in sulfur cycling
(61, 62). The Thermoplasmatales are generally known as acidophiles (63), which is
curious since serpentinization is associated with high pH.

450
The most abundant taxa in serpentinites recovered from the central dome of the
massif (boreholes M0069, M0072, and M0076) were more difficult to interpret. At
least two probable subsurface taxa (Sphingomonadaceae and Dechloromonas) were
detected in these serpentinites, but many of the other sequences from these
455

samples are identical to environmental sequences from studies of animal digestive
tracts or soils. Therefore, serpentinites from the central dome, which are considered
to be most representative of the massif's basement, appear to be more susceptible
to undetected contamination, perhaps due to extremely low DNA yields from these
samples.

460
Recently, Quéméneur et al. (58) reported enrichment cultures obtained from IODP
Expedition 357 rock cores, including two serpentinite samples. One of these was a
section of a serpentinite core (357-71C-5R-CC) that was adjacent to a sample
included in the present study (0AMRd036A). Our parallel sample was heavily
465

contaminated with air DNA (Figure 3) and did not contain any of the dominant taxa
detected by Quéméneur et al. Many of the taxa detected in their cultivation

experiments were also present in our results, but only one genus reported by
Quéméneur et al. (Sphingomonas) was included in our final list of candidate
serpentinite taxa (Data set S7). Most of the successful enrichments reported by
470

Quéméneur et al. were obtained from a carbonate-hosted basalt breccia, which was
not included in our study.

In 2005, IODP expedition 304/305 recovered gabbroic rocks from the central dome
of the Atlantis Massif, but no serpentinites (Figure 1). A few phylotypes of
475

proteobacteria were detected in the gabbroic rock cores by sequencing of
environmental 16S rRNA genes (19). None of these matched the candidate
serpentinite taxa reported here. However, most of the functional genes detected by
Mason et al. (19) with the GeoChip microarray, including genes associated with
metal toxicity, carbon degradation, denitrification, and carbon fixation, are consistent

480

with the taxa detected in our serpentinite samples.

Conclusions
This study provides the first sequences of environmental DNA from subseafloor
serpentinites, enabled by the high recovery of rock cores by IODP Expedition 357 to
485

the Atlantis Massif (20). The extremely low biomass of the serpentinites presented
multiple challenges, necessitating the development of a novel DNA extraction and
purification protocol. We developed strategies to increase the yield of DNA
appropriate for PCR amplification, while eliminating many potential sources of
laboratory contamination. We hope that our methodology, as well as our

490

identification of laboratory contaminants derived from dust particles, will prove to be
useful to other researchers studying extremely low-biomass environments. We were

able to identify candidate residents of the serpentinite subseafloor by employing a
series of contamination-detection procedures, including evaluations of whole-sample
compositions and of individual sequences. Our results highlight the importance of a
495

multi-faceted approach to contamination control that features sampling of potential
contamination sources as a complement to microbiologically clean sampleprocessing protocols. Multiple statistical and bioinformatic tools were used to identify
contaminant DNA sequences in a careful process that did not unnecessarily ignore
useful information, such as the relative abundances of individual DNA sequences in

500

potential contamination sources. No computational tool can ever prove that an
environmental DNA sequence is not a contaminant, and future studies will
investigate candidate subseafloor organisms with experimental studies.

Materials and Methods
505

Detailed descriptions of samples and sample-processing protocols are available in
the Supplemental Methods (Text S1). DNA was purified from rock samples with
SCODA (synchronous coefficient of drag attenuation) technology implemented with
the Aurora purification system (Boreal Genomics, Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada). 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was conducted by the Michigan

510

State University genomics core facility on all of the samples (rock, water, and lab
air). All samples were sequenced twice (i.e. sequencing replicates). The V4 region of
the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with dual-indexed Illumina fusion primers
(515F/806R) as described elsewhere (64). 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences
were processed with cutadapt v. 1.15 (65) and DADA2 v. 1.10.1 (66). Taxonomic

515

classification of all ASVs was performed with DADA2 using the SILVA reference
alignment (SSURefv132) and taxonomy outline (67). Raw counts were converted to

proportions to normalize for variations in sequencing depth among samples. The
non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) plot was generated from a table of
ASV proportional abundances across all sample categories (rocks, water, lab air)
520

using the distance, ordinate, and plot_ordination commands in the R package
phyloseq v.1.26.1 (68). The major sources of contamination and the level of
contamination in each sample were estimated with SourceTracker2, version 2.0.1
(45). Differential abundance was tested with the R package edgeR v. 3.24.3 (69) as
recommended elsewhere (70). We used edgeR to contrast the total read counts of

525

ASVs in serpentinite rock samples compared to three groups of water samples
(surface, shallow, deep). ASVs that were absent in all serpentinites and ASVs with
low variance (<1e-6) were excluded from the comparisons. The output of the three
edgeR tests (serpentinite samples compared to each of the three groups of water
samples) was three lists of ASVs with significant differential abundances (false

530

discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in serpentinite samples or water samples. The final list
of ASVs was created by deleting ASVs with greater abundances in any of the
categories of water samples (as determined by the edgeR tests) from the original list
of ASVs from which all air ASVs had already been removed. Finally, rare ASVs
(those that did not have >=100 counts in a single sample) were excluded from the

535

final results, merely as a conservative abundance filter for reporting a final list of
ASVs expected to be present in serpentinite rocks. No comparisons of diversity were
attempted after removing rare ASVs.

Figure 2: A non-metric multidimensional scaling plot shows general patterns in the
16S rRNA gene microbial community compositions of all types of samples. Each

data point represents the microbial community composition of a sample of seawater
(deep, shallow, or surface), rock core (serpentinite versus non-serpentinite), or
laboratory air. The distances between the data points represent the Morisita-Horn
dissimilarities among the microbial communities.
