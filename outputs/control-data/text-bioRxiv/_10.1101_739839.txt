Abstract
Activation of bile acid (BA) receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has been shown to inhibit
inflammatory responses and improve tissue ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study
investigated the effect of FXR deficiency on liver IRI, using a liver warm IRI mouse model. We
demonstrate that liver IRI resulted in decreased FXR expression in the liver of WT mice. FXR-/mice displayed greater liver damage and inflammatory responses than WT mice, characterized by
significant increases in liver weight, serum AST and ALT, hepatocyte apoptosis and liver
inflammatory cytokines. Liver IRI increased expression of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and
FGF21 in WT liver, but not in FXR-/- liver, which conversely increased CHOP expression,
suggesting a loss of ER stress protection in the absence of FXR. FXR deficiency increased
circulating total BAs and altered BA composition with reduced TUDCA and hepatic BA synthesis
markers. FXR deficiency also reshaped gut microbiota composition with increased Bacteroidetes
and Proteobacteria and decreased Firmicutes. Curiously, Bacteroidetes were positively and
Firmicutes were negatively correlated with serum ALT levels. Administration of FXR agonist
CDCA inhibited NF-B activity and TNFα expression in vitro and improved liver IRI in vivo. Our
findings demonstrate that FXR signaling plays an important role in the modulation of liver IRI.

Introduction
Recent improvements in surgical techniques, liver preservation and immunosuppression continue
to improve liver operations and increase survival of liver grafts in transplantation (1, 2). However,
liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) remains an important problem in the clinical scenario
of liver surgery (3). In major liver resection, a primary side effect is liver warm IRI, i.e. ischemia
of remnant liver following temporary vascular occlusion, and additional reperfusion injury added
to the damage sustained during ischemia (4). In liver transplantation, liver warm and cold IRI may
occur in situ during recipient surgery or donor liver harvest, which may cause cellular injury, organ
dysfunction, or even complete graft failure (5).
Tissue ischemia and reperfusion initiates a defensive process known as the unfolded
protein response (UPR) for adaptation and safeguard of cell survival. Activation of the inositolrequiring enzyme (IRE)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway in response to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress protects hepatocytes from apoptosis. However, sustained activation of ER
triggers proapoptotic signals via C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is responsible for
cellular dysfunction (6, 7). Evidence for the role of BAs and their receptors in the regulation of
inflammation and tissue IRI already exists in experimental and animal settings (8, 9). Activation
of the BA membrane receptor, G protein-coupled BA receptor 1 (TGR5), by TGR5 agonists
inhibits inflammatory responses and attenuates liver IRI by suppressing the Toll like receptor 4
(TLR4)-NF-B mediated pathway (10). Recent experimental data suggest that activation of BA
nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), stimulates the IRE/XBP1 pathway and may be
protective during liver injury (11). Similarly, administration of the FXR-agonist obeticholic acid
(OCA) improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, through gut barrier preservation and
mitigated inflammation (12). However, in the setting of liver IRI, the role and fundamental
mechanism of FXR signaling in the modulation of ER stress and inflammatory responses remain
unexplored.
There is growing evidence of bidirectional interactions between BAs and the gut
microbiota, i.e. BAs in the distal intestine influence the composition of the gut microbiota that in
turn modify primary BAs to generate secondary BAs (13). FXR deficiency significantly reduces
the abundance of Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes (14). Dysbiosis directly impairs intestinal
barrier function and increases gut permeability. Bacteria and their components, such as

lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pass through the intestinal barrier to the liver, causing inflammatory
responses. Modulation of the gut microbiota may inhibit inflammatory responses and represent a
novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of tissue IRI (15).
In this study, we examined FXR deficiency in the aggravation of liver IRI using a mouse
model of liver warm IRI. We hypothesized that a lack of FXR exaggerates hepatocyte ER stress
and apoptosis during liver IRI. FXR deficiency may alter BA and gut microbiota homeostasis,
which may also contribute to the pathogenesis of liver IRI. Our results demonstrate that mice
lacking FXR are more susceptible to liver IRI than wild type (WT) mice.

Materials and Methods
Mice and surgical procedures
FXR knockout (FXR-/-, B6.129X1-Nr1h4tm1Gonz/J) mice (8-weeks of age) were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory. Male homozygous FXR-/- and FXR wild type (WT) littermate mice (5 mice
per group) were used. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free, temperature-controlled
and 12-hour light-dark cycle environment in the Animal Resources Center (ARC) at the University
of Chicago.
The liver warm IRI model was conducted under general anesthesia with isoflurane and
equal O2 through a cone placed around the mouse’s nose. A small clip (Roboz, RS-5424) was used
to interrupt arterial/portal venous blood supply to the median and left lateral lobes, in which 70%
of liver blood flow was blocked (16). To test whether a lack of FXR exaggerates liver damage,
after 90 minutes of ischemia, the clip was removed followed by 6 hours of reperfusion in FXR-/mice compared to WT mice. To test whether FXR activation improved liver IRI, FXR agonist
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was administered to WT mice at a dose of 150 mg/kg (dissolved
in 100μl 1% carboxymethylcellulose or CMC) by oral gavage daily for a week prior to IRI
challenge. The same volume of CMC (Vehicle) was used in control mice. The animal’s vital signs
were monitored throughout surgery, including respiratory rate, response to pedal or palpebral
stimulus and assessment of spontaneous movements. All animals received humane care, according
to the criteria outlined in the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" prepared by the
National Academy of Sciences and published by the NIH. All animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Chicago.
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) analysis
Blood samples were collected at 6 hours (WT vs. FXR-/-) or 24 hours (WT with and without FXR
agonist CDCA) after ischemia and were centrifuged to obtain serum. ALT and AST were measured
to assess the extent of hepatocyte damage using an automated chemical analyzer (Olympus
Automated Chemistry Analyzer AU5400, Tokyo, Japan).
Bile acid analysis
Total BAs and BA composition were analyzed as described in our previous reports (17, 18). Briefly,
stock solutions of individual BAs and NDCA were prepared in methanol at a concentration of
6

5μg/mL. Calibration standards were prepared by adding individual bile acids at a concentration
range of 12ng/mL to 1.5ug/mL to charcoal stripped human serum. 1.6μL of NDCA was added to
40μL of standards and samples. Deproteinization was carried out by adding 15X ice-cold methanol
to 40μL of standards and samples. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, evaporated under
vacuum and dissolved in 100μL of 50% methanol. The tubes were centrifuged at 11,000xg for 1
min before transfer in to specific vials for injection in to an LC-MS/MS system. Data were acquired
on AB Sciex triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative ion mode coupled to Shimadzu
Nexera XR HPLC system. Chromatographic separation was carried out on Thermo Scientific
Accucore XLC8 column (4μm, 100 x 3mm I.D.). Quantitation of bile acids was carried out on
MultiQuant software v3.0.2 (AB Sciex). BAs, including CA, CDCA, DCA, LCA, TCA, TDCA,
TCDCA, UDCA and TUDCA, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. bMCA, TbMCA and internal
standard 23-nordeoxycholic acid (NDCA) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada).

were generated by an Illumina MiSeq DNA platform at Argonne National Laboratory and analyzed
by the program Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) (19). Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were picked at 97% sequence identity using open reference OTU
picking against the Greengenes database (20). OTUs generated in QIIME were then analyzed using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) where non-parametric factorial KruskalWallis sum-rank testing (p < 0.05) identified significantly abundant taxa followed by unpaired
Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine LDA scores > 2 (21).

of denaturation (95oC for 10s), annealing (55oC for 20s) and extension (60oC for 30s), followed
by a final incubation at 55oC for 30s and cooling at 40oC for 30s. All measurements were
normalized by the expression of GAPDH gene, considered as a stable housekeeping gene. Gene
expression was determined using the delta-delta Ct method: 2-ΔΔCT (ΔΔCT = [Ct(target gene) –
Ct(GAPDH)] tested - [Ct(target gene) -Ct(GAPDH)]control) and displayed as relative mRNA
levels.
Cell culture and tissue luciferase assay
To test whether the FXR agonist CDCA inhibited NF-B activity and TNFα expression in
macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) transfected with a luciferase gene
under the control of the NF-B promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Wei Han, Vanderbilt University)
(24) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.025μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO).
BMDMs were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FCS at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 4 hours. Luciferase activity in BMDMs was determined by the
tissue luciferase assay using the Bradford Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions as described in our previous report (25). TNFα
mRNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR as described above.
Histological examination
Liver tissue was collected 6 hours following ischemia and subjected to H&E staining. Hepatocyte
apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL assay. TUNEL labeling was performed using a TUNEL kit
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitation of apoptotic
cells was accomplished by calculating of the labeling index, which was defined as the ratio
between the number of labeled cells and the total cells counted in triplicate field by two blinded
investigators.
Statistical analysis
Data from the current studies were analyzed by ANOVA tests (StatView 4.5, Abacus Concepts,
Berkeley, CA) with Tukey post-hoc multiple comparisons, or by 2-tailed Student’s t test when
appropriate, where p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. The results are presented as mean ±
SEM.

Results
Mice lacking FXR were more susceptible to liver IRI
A lack of FXR increased TGR5 expression in naïve FXR-/- mice, indicating a compensation of
TGR5 for the deficiency of FXR. Liver IRI reduced hepatic expression of FXR in WT mice, and
conversely, the same procedure increased expression of TGR5 in WT and FXR-/- mice (Fig. 1, A
and B). FXR-/- mice also revealed an increase in liver weight (liver/body weight) in untreated FXR/-

(FXR-/- Control) mice, compared with untreated WT (WT Control) mice. Liver IRI further

increased liver weight (Fig. 1C) and aggravated liver injury in the deficiency of FXR evidenced
by increased circulating AST (Fig. 1D) and ALT (Fig. 1E) levels in FXR-/- IRI mice, compared
with WT mice. The gross examination suggested evidence of liver steatosis and cholestasis in
FXR-/- controls and FXR-/- IRI mice, which was confirmed histologically (H&E) (Fig. 1F), and
suggested possible steatosis, which was previously identified as a susceptibility factor under IRI
(26).
A lack of FXR resulted in increased TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 transcript in FXR-/- control mice
(FXR-/- Control vs. WT Control, p < 0.05, Fig. 2, A to C). As expected, liver IRI also increased
TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 transcripts in both WT and FXR-/- mice (p < 0.01), and TNFα was
significantly increased in FXR-/- IRI mice, compared to WT IRI mice (Fig. 2A). Superoxide
dismutase 2 (SOD2) binds to the superoxide to improve tissue injury. Reduced SOD2 expression
was observed in WT mice following IRI, but more dramatically in FXR-/- mice (p = 0.05, Fig. 2D).
FXR deficiency triggered hepatocyte apoptosis via activation of ER stress
ER stress activates a number of proteins that straddle ER membranes. Activated IRE1α functions
as an endoribonuclease splicing a 26 base pair intron from XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 (sXBP1)
mRNA is translated into a stable and active UPR transcription factor. Therefore, measuring XBP-1
splicing represents a reliable indirect method of determining IRE1α activation (27). Liver IRI
promoted expression of total XBP1 (TXBP1, Fig. 3A), sXBP1 (Fig. 3B) and unconventional
splicing XBP1 (usXBP1, Fig. 3C) in WT mice. However, mice deficient in FXR showed no change
in these genes (Fig. 3, A to C). Liver IRI decreased expression of ATF4 and GFP94 in the absence
of FXR (WT IRI vs. FXR-/- IR, p < 0.05, Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, FXR deficiency resulted
in decreased ERAD-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM, Fig. 3F), ultimately resulting
in hepatocyte susceptibility to apoptosis. Consistently, we observed increased CHOP with FXR

deficiency (Fig. 3G). TUNEL tests showed increased apoptotic cells in untreated FXR-/- control
mice, but without statistical difference. Liver IRI increased apoptotic cells in all groups; however,
apoptotic cells were significantly increased in FXR-/- mice compared with WT IRI mice (Fig. 3H).
Both the lack of FXR and liver IRI altered BA homeostasis
FXR represses transcription of the gene encoding CYP7A1 that is the rate-limiting enzyme in BA
synthesis, and thus, the lack of FXR thus resulted in increased circulating total BAs (Fig. 4A). BA
composition analysis demonstrated that the lack of FXR specifically increased circulating TbMCA
(Fig. 4B), TCA (Fig. 4D) and DCA (Fig. 4F) when compared to WT control mice. Liver IRI
increased circulating total BAs (Fig.4A), TbMCA (Fig. 4B), bMCA (Fig. 4C), TCA (Fig. 4D) and
TUDCA (Fig. 4G) in WT mice. Although CA and DCA were increased in WT liver IRI mice,
there were no statistical differences (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4, E and F). There were no changes to
circulating LCA in any groups (Fig. 4H). Given that the mutation of FXR affects BA synthesis
and transport (28), and IRI may also impacts liver BA homeostasis, we analyzed total BAs in the
liver. As expected, the absence of FXR causes BA accumulation of total BAs in the liver; however,
IRI results in decreases of liver total BAs in both WT and FXR-/- mice (Fig. 4I).
Enzyme CYP7A1 initiates the classic pathway of BA synthesis, followed by CYP8B1 that
produces the majority of the BA pool. The alternative pathway involves the BA synthetic enzyme
CYP27A1 followed by BA hydroxylation by CYP7B1. BA synthesis is under the regulation of
FXR, which enhances expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and stimulates ileal
fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) in mice (FGF19 in humans). FGF15/19 travels to the liver
where the membrane receptor, FGFR4, triggers a signaling cascade that results in BA synthesis
inactivation. ER stress and inflammatory responses suppress BA synthesis and enhance BA
removal from hepatocytes (29). Our results showed that liver IRI inhibited expression of SHP (Fig.
5A). Liver IRI and the lack of FXR reduced FGFR4 gene, but no statistical difference (Fig. 5B).
BA synthesis enzymes, including CYP7A1 (Fig. 5C), CYP8B1 (Fig. 5D), CYP27A1 (Fig. 5E) and
CYP7B1 (Fig. 5F), were reduced in WT and FXR-/- mice. Naïve FXR-/- animals demonstrated
decreased mean expression levels of CYP27A1 and CYP7B1 mRNAs, but not significantly (Fig.
5, E and F, p > 0.05).
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is identified as one of tissue protective proteins (30).
To test whether FGF21 is altered under liver IRI, liver FGF21 expression was analyzed. Results

showed that liver IRI increased FGF21 transcript in the WT liver. However, IRI failed to enhance
liver FGF21 expression in the absence of FXR (Fig. 5G), suggesting FGF21 expression may be,
at least in part, regulated by FXR (31).
FXR deficiency altered gut microbiota composition
Taxonomic analysis of gut microbiota composition showed changes at the phylum level, where
Bacteroidetes was increased and Firmicutes decreased - with increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes
ratios - in FXR-/- IRI mice with and without liver IRI (Fig. 6, A and B) consistent with a previous
report (14). Our data showed that Proteobacteria was increased in untreated FXR-/- and FXR-/- IRI
mice (Fig. 6C). More interestingly, altered Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were correlated with
markers of liver function; Bacteroidetes was positively and Firmicutes was negatively correlated
with serum ALT levels (Fig. 6, D and E) following liver IRI. Increasing data identify
Proteobacteria as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) producers that act as possible microbial signature of
host disease (32). Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, the relative abundance of Bacteroides was
increased in naïve and FXR-/- IRI mice (Fig. 6, F and G). Within the phylum Firmicutes, the
relative abundances of Turicibacter and Clostridiales were decreased in FXR-/- mice with and
without liver IRI (Fig. 6, H and I). Finally, within the phylum Proteobacteria, the relative
abundance of Desulfovibrio was increased in FXR-/- mice with and without liver IRI (Fig. 6J).
Activation of FXR inhibited inflammatory reaction in vitro and improved liver IRI in vivo
Macrophage-induced inflammatory responses are mediated through inflammatory signaling
pathways, such as NF-B, causing TNFα expression. In the bone marrow-derived macrophage
(BMDM) culture, LPS increased luciferase activity, indicating increased NF-B activity, which
was inhibited by administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, Supplemental Fig. 1SA). TNFα
mRNA was increased by the stimulation of LPS but also inhibited by CDCA (Supplemental Fig.
1SB).
To test whether FXR activation improved liver IRI, FXR agonist CDCA was administered
to WT mice undergone 90 minutes of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. The results showed
that serum ALT levels were significantly decreased in CDCA-treated WT mice compared to
Vehicle-treated WT mice (Supplemental Fig. 1SC). Although CDCA also decreased AST levels
in the same animals, differences between CDCA-treated and control mice did not reach
significance (p > 0.05, Supplemental Fig. 1SD).

Discussion
We employed animals lacking FXR compared with WT to investigate critical signaling pathways
in liver IRI. The results herein demonstrated that liver IRI decreased hepatic FXR expression in
WT mice in line with elevated IL-6 levels, a known FXR repressor (33), indicating an inverse
relationship between FXR and liver IRI. Under FXR deficiency, more profound increases in proinflammatory cytokines may directly contribute to elevated susceptibility to liver IRI, including
elevated circulating AST and ALT, and more pronounced hepatocyte apoptosis compared with
WT controls.
ER stress triggers the adaptive response that acts in concert to mitigate the load of new
proteins entering the ER through increasing ER content, such as chaperone capacity, thereby
degrading misfolded proteins and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Chaperone GRP94 and ATF4 are the
most abundant glycoprotein in the ER and participate in protein folding and assist in the targeting
of misfolded proteins for ER associated degradation (ERAD) (34). Promotion of ERAD through
upregulation of ERAD-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) promotes cell recovery by
accelerating ERAD of terminally misfolded polypeptides and protects against cell apoptosis (35).
A recent report suggests that FXR signaling modulates ER stress via activation of the IRE/XBP1
pathway (11). Our findings show that mice lacking FXR resulted in reduced expression of GRP94,
ATF4, EDEM, XBP1 (including total, spliced and unconventional spliced XBP1) in the liver when
suffering from IRI, suggesting that the absence of FXR forfeits protection of hepatocytes from
apoptosis, contributing to the susceptibility to liver IRI.
ROS generation inflicts tissue damage and initiates a cascade of deleterious cellular
responses leading to inflammation, cell death and ultimately liver failure. SOD2 transforms toxic
superoxide and clears mitochondrial ROS and therefore confers protection against hepatocyte
apoptosis (36). In the absence of FXR, liver IRI fails to promote production of SOD2, and
accumulation of ROS may initiate the inflammatory reaction and liver damage.
FGF21 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family that regulates cell growth,
differentiation, and glucose and lipid metabolism. FXR activation promotes FGF21 expression
(31), which alleviates hepatic ER stress under the physiological condition (37). Increased FGF21
protects against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity by enhancing antioxidant capacity (38).
Clinical findings show that serum FGF21 increases following liver or cardiac ischemia and is

associated with protective responses (39). We observed that liver IRI promoted expression of liver
FGF21 in WT mice, but deficiency of FXR failed to increase FGF21 expression, thereby losing
liver protection.
The lack of FXR stimulates BA synthesis, resulting in increased circulating total BAs,
TbMCA, MCA, TCA and DCA. Due to the damage of BA transports in the absence of FXR (28),
BAs are accumulated in the liver as evidenced by increased total BAs in the liver of FXR-/- mice.
Liver IRI causes immediate reduction of synthesis as confirmed by decreased BA synthetic
enzymes and reduced total BAs in the liver in both WT and FXR-/- mice. However, liver IRI
induces rapid increases of circulating total BAs and alterations of BA composition in both WT and
FXR-/- mice. Among the notable changes in circulating BAs was TUDCA, a hydrophilic BA that
regulates ER stress and mediates cytoprotective responses during liver IRI (40); however, FXR-/mice failed to demonstrate elevated TUDCA. Nevertheless, whether the alteration of BA
composition mediates liver IRI needs further study.
A biochemical link between the gut microbiota and FXR signaling has been demonstrated
(41). Taxonomic tree analysis displaying differential taxa in hierarchical layers supports the
concept that FXR deficiency is associated with distinct microbiota and liver IRI may generate
selection pressure for certain gut bacterial taxa. Recent work shows that FXR-/- mice exhibit
reduced levels of the phylum Firmicutes and destabilizes the gut microbiota when compared with
WT animals (42). Our findings demonstrate that liver IRI decreased the relative composition of
the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes in WT animals, consistent with previous work (43). FXR
deficiency leads to increased Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes. Increased Bacteroidetes and
reduced Firmicutes were correlated with higher levels of circulating ALT after liver IRI across all
animals. This analysis also showed increased cecal Proteobacteria in the absence of FXR.
Proteobacteria are a major phylum of gram-negative bacteria that include a wide variety of
pathogens, such as Escherichia Coli, capable of producing LPS (44). However, Proteobacteria are
not increased in WT IRI mice, suggesting that the lack of FXR, but not stress (IRI) contributes to
increased Proteobacteria. Within the Proteobacteria, the genus Desulfovibrio is a Gram-negative
obligate anaerobic that was elevated by IRI. Increased Desulfovibrio is associated with
inflammation of gut tissues (45) and may mediate inflammatory responses following liver IRI.
Due to the presence of LPS in the outer membrane, increased Proteobacteria may induce
inflammatory responses in the liver, where LPS and other danger associated molecular patterns

reach the liver via the portal vein. Consequently, a lack of FXR results in dysbiosis of the
microbiome that are empirically associated with hepatocyte injury and therefore may contribute to
the liver IRI pathogenesis.
BMDMs functionally resemble Kupffer cells and are used to study immune responses that
mediate liver injury (46). Here we show that FXR agonist CDCA attenuated NF-B activity and
TNFα expression the BMDM cell culture consistent with a previous report (47). When CDCA is
administered to WT animals, it improves liver IRI supported by decreased serum ALT levels.
However, a major limitation to our work relates to the evidence that mice and humans are
inherently different in the homeostasis of BAs, i.e. the human liver synthesize CA and CDCA as
FXR agonists, whereas mice synthesize TbMCA that are considered antagonistic towards FXR.
In conclusion, these data illustrate fundamental roles for FXR in the modulation of liver
IRI. FXR expression is decreased during liver IRI in WT mice. Mice lacking FXR reduce baseline
chaperone expression and exhibit significant changes of BA composition, which potentially
triggers IRI-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. The absence of FXR results in dysbiosis of the gut
microbiota, which may further exacerbate liver inflammatory reactions during liver IRI. Our
findings suggest that hepatocyte protective mechanisms are impaired in the absence of FXR
signaling. As proof of this concept, our work shows that activation of FXR with exogenous CDCA
inhibits inflammatory responses in vitro and improves liver IRI markers in vivo.

Fig. 5. Liver IRI and the lack of FXR altered expression of BA synthesis-related molecules (n =
5 per group). (A) Liver IRI and the lack of FXR decreased expression of SHP in the liver. WT
Control vs. WT IRI, p < 0.001; FXR-/- Control vs. WT Control, p < 0.001. (B) Liver IRI decreased
expression of FGFR4, but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). (C) Liver IRI decreased
expression of CYP7A1. WT Control vs. WT IRI, p < 0.01; FXR-/- IRI vs. FXR-/- Control, p <
0.001. (D) Liver IRI decreased expression of CYP8B1. WT IRI and FXR-/- IRI vs. WT Control
and FXR-/- Control, p < 0.01, respectively. (E) Liver IRI decreased expression of CYP27A1. WT
IRI and FXR-/- IRI vs. WT Control and FXR-/- Control, p < 0.01, respectively. (F) Liver IRI
decreased expression of CYP7B1. WT Control vs. WT IRI, and FXR-/- Control vs. FXR-/- IRI, p <
0.05, respectively. (G) Liver IRI increased FGF21 expression in WT mice, but not in FXR-/- mice.
WT Control vs. WT IRI, p < 0.05.

The lack of FXR altered gut microbiota composition (n = 5 per group).

(A)

Reconfiguration of phyla. The lack of FXR reduced phylum Firmicutes and increased phylum
Bacteroidetes. (B) Decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes cause an increase in the ratio
of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in FXR-/- mice. (C) The lack of FXR increased phylum Proteobacteria.
(D) Increased phylum Bacteroidetes was positively related with increased serum ALT levels in

FXR-/- mice. (E) Increased phylum Firmicutes was negatively related with serum ALT levels in
FXR-/- mice. (F) The relative abundance of cecal content genera of microbiome. (G) The lack of
FXR led to increase in Bacteroides (under phylum Bacteroidetes). (H) The lack of FXR caused
decrease of Turicibacter (under phylum Firmicutes). (I) The lack of FXR caused decrease of
Clostridiales (under phylum Firmicutes). (J) The lack of FXR caused increase of Desulfovibrio
(under phylum Proteobacteria).
Supplemental Fig. 1. FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) inhibited inflammatory
responses in vitro and improved liver function in vivo. (A) Supplement of CDCA inhibited
luciferase activity induced by LPS in the bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) culture,
indicating the inhibition of NF-B activity. LPS CDCA vs. LPS, p < 0.001. (B) Supplement of
CDCA inhibited TNFα expression induced by LPS in the BMDM culture. LPS CDCA vs. LPS, p
< 0.001 (the cell culture was repeated twice). (C) Administration of CDCA decreased serum ALT
levels in WT mice with liver IRI (CDCA vs. Vehicle, p < 0.05). (D) Serum AST levels in WT
mice with liver IRI (CDCA vs. Vehicle, p > 0.05).
