Abstract

30

Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse

31

vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts,

32

with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed

33

short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the

34

horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs

35

in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192

36

PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae,

37

Hipposideridae,

38

newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two

39

PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered

40

phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three

41

inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of

42

the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with

43

the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously

44

explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese

45

horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with

46

each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of

47

positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis

48

indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of

49

PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of

Emballonuridae,

Miniopteridae

and

Pteropodidae)

Author summary

54

Since the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been

55

considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this

56

study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale

57

surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred

58

between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent

59

contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV

60

host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including

61

horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to

62

both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly

63

host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an

64

increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary

65

scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the

66

diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of

67

PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other

68

DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.

Introduction

71

Bats (order Chiroptera) account for more than 20% of mammalian species with > 1,100 known

72

species in > 200 genera worldwide [1]. These diverse mammals harbor numerous highly virulent

73

viral pathogens, including rabies virus [2], Marburg virus [3], Ebola virus [4], Nipah virus [5],

74

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus [6-8] and the newly identified

75

swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus [9]. Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or

76

domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10].

77

Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and

78

highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation

79

in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15].

80

Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the

81

family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and

82

classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine

83

floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species

84

[17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary

85

history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different

86

mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission

87

within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host

88

divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and,

89

potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant

90

diversity based on the available genetic data [17].

91

Currently, 15 alphapolyomaviruses and 10 betapolyomaviruses have been formally recognized

92

in insectivorous and frugivorous bat species within the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia

93

(Indonesia) and the Pacific (New Zealand) [19-26]. These studies identified significant diversity

94

and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or

95

partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and

96

recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and

97

frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in

98

horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly

99

identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26].

100

In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel

101

PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse

102

ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching

103

events in these bat-borne PyVs. The findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of intra-host PyV

104

diversification in their mammalian hosts and extend the knowledge of PyV genetic diversity,

105

evolution, host restriction and host-switching.

109

In 2015-2016, a total of 1,083 bats belonging to 20 species in 6 families (Rhinolophidae,

110

Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) were

111

collected from 29 different colonies (colonies 1-29 in Fig 1 and S1 Table) from five provinces in

112

southwest (Yunnan and Guangxi), southeast (Fujian and Zhejiang) and northwest (Xinjiang)

113

provinces in China. The bats were identified morphologically by field-trained experts during

114

sampling and confirmed by partial mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequencing [31] of

115

representative individuals in every colony (S1 Table). The bats were insectivorous except for one

116

fruit bat species Rousettus leschenaultii in the family Pteropodidae, and were captured in diverse

117

habitats, including natural and artificial caves, orchards and human-made structures (S1 Table).

118

Archived tissues from individual bats had previously been sampled for zoonotic virus

119

surveillance, including for group A rotaviruses (RVA) [32] and hantaviruses [33].

120

As part of the regional viral surveillance of a bat-borne zoonosis program, the lungs and rectal

121

tissue of 208 bats of 9 bat species from colonies 1-4 (S1 Table) collected in Yunnan province

122

were pooled and subjected to viral metagenomic analysis, as previously described [34]. Nucleic

123

acids were amplified by sequence-independent single primer amplification prior to Illumina

124

sequencing. A total of 1.76×107 sequence reads with an average length of 125 nucleotides (nt)

125

were obtained, of which 694 PyV-related reads with average length of 167 nt were identified

126

from 38,468 virus-related sequences. Preliminary analyses of these PyV sequences indicated a

127

high level of diversity with previously unrecognized members from both Alpha- and

128

Betapolyomavirus genera.

129

To determine the prevalence of PyVs in bats collected not only from Yunnan but also from

130

other provinces in China, a broad-spectrum PyV nested PCR targeting the VP1 gene of known

131

members within the Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera [27] was performed using genomic

132

DNAs extracted from archived rectal tissues of all 1,083 bats. This yielded 186 (17.2%) PyV

133

positive samples from 15 bat species within 6 families. These PyV positive bats were from 21 of

134

29 bat colonies in the survey area. As shown in Fig 1 and Table 1, all five investigated provinces

135

had PyV positive bats with detection rates of 9.6% (20/208) in Yunnan, 11.9% (59/495) in

136

Guangxi, 10.1% (16/158) in Xinjiang, 42.5% (74/174) in Fujian and 35.4% (17/48) in Zhejiang.

137

With respect to the bat families (Fig 1 and Table 1), 103 from 6 species of Rhinolophidae, 60

138

from 4 species of Vespertilionidae, 7 from 2 species of Hipposideridae, and 11, 2 and 3

139

respectively from 1 species each of Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae were PyV

140

positive. At the species level, Rh. affinis, in the Rhinolophidae, widely distributed in southern

141

China, yielded the highest number of positive bats (n=64), while Myotis horsfieldii in the

142

Vespertilionidae collected in Fujian, showed the highest positivity rate: 66.6% (24/36).

Extensive genetic diversity of polyomaviruses among bats.

150

VP1 genes of PyV were amplified using broad-spectrum primers from 186 positive samples and

151

then cloned into vectors. Four clones derived from each amplicon were sequenced to detect

152

potential co-infection of multiple PyVs in each positive sample. As a result, 180 of 186 bats were

153

confirmed to harbor one PyV, while the remaining 6 had a co-infection with two distinct PyVs

154

(detailed in S1 Table). A total of 192 non-redundant partial VP1 sequences were obtained and

155

phylogenetically compared with VP1 sequences of known PyVs. Results showed that the 192

156

VP1 sequences had extensive diversity and could be classified into 44 clusters within the Alpha-

157

and Betapolyomavirus genera (Fig 2 and S1 Fig), with 46.6-90.1% nt identities between clusters

158

and 95.1-100% within clusters. Of these 44 PyVs clusters, 42 showed exclusive host specificity

159

within a single bat species while, surprisingly, the remaining 2 clusters included viruses detected

160

in two bat species within different families (Rh. affinis and Hipposideros larvatus; Rh. affinis and

161

Myotis horsfieldii, respectively). This finding provided preliminary evidence of inter-family

162

transmission of PyVs (Fig 2 and S1 Fig). The majority (n= 191) of these partial VP1 shared less

163

than 90% nt identity with the closest known PyVs. Interestingly, one VP1 sequence (marked by

164

cluster 10 in S1 Fig), named here as Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 (strain

165

PyV10-YXAC25) shared 98% nt identity with Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 1, previously

166

identified in brown rats in Germany [35].

167

To further characterize the genetic diversity of the PyVs in these bats, inverse PCR based on

168

the partial VP1 sequences was employed to amplify the remaining genomes. A total of 42 full

169

genomes were obtained from 40 individual bats. As shown in Table 2, the genome sizes of the

170

novel bat-borne PyV were 4,869–5,529 bp with 39.49–44.69% G+C content. All PyV genomes

171

displayed an archetypal genomic organization, including an early region encoding two

172

nonstructural proteins [large tumor antigen (LTAg), and short tumor antigen (STAg)], and a late

173

region encoding three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) on opposite strands. Early and late

174

regions were separated by a non-coding control region harboring regulatory elements. For all

175

samples from which PyVs genomes were obtained, a ~1,800 bp fragment of the cytb gene was

176

amplified to corroborate the bat host species (Table 2 and S2 Fig).

177

The PyV strains sharing ≥ 97% nt identity within the LTAg coding sequence were defined as

178

the same PyV, while those sharing ≤ 90% identities were defined as different PyV [36].

179

Consequently, as shown in Table 2 and Fig 3, the 42 PyV strains were identified as 28 novel

180

bat-borne PyVs based on genomic identities. Of these novel bat-borne PyVs, 26 were identified

181

in a single bat species, indicative of a high degree of host specificity. They included one PyV

182

identified in a cryptic bat species (provisionally named Rhinolophus sp. CN2016) the permanent

183

identification of which awaits formal binomial classification of the host species as the cytb gene

184

showed only 90% nt identity with that of known bat species [37]. The PyVs named in the present

185

study were based on the binomial names of their host bat species and the chronological order of

186

discovery, as per ICTV guidelines. For example, Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was the

187

first PyV discovered in Aselliscus stoliczkanus bats, and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 was

188

the second PyV discovered in Rh. affinis bats. Interestingly, two remaining PyVs were identified

189

in more than one bat species. In detail, a PyV, herein provisionally named as Rhinolophus

190

affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Ra-Hl PyV), was identified in both Rh. affinis and H.

191

larvatus bats. Similarly, another PyV named as Rhinolophus affinis-Myotis horsfieldii

192

polyomavirus (Ra-Mh PyV) was identified in Rh. affinis and My. horsfieldii bats. For clarity and

193

according to the naming tradition of PyV, the Ra-Hl PyV identified in Rh. affinis was named

194

Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 (the fifth PyV discovered in Rh. affinis), and the Ra-Hl PyV

195

identified in H. larvatus was named Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1. Similarly, the Ra-Mh

196

PyV identified in Rh. affinis was named Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3, and the Ra-Mh PyV

197

identified in My. horsfieldii named Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus 3.

Among the newly identified single-host PyVs (Fig 3), 19 PyVs shared 68-83% nt sequence

199

identities with the closest-known species or with each other in the LTAg coding sequences,

200

therefore were considered to be novel PyV species according to a demarcation standard based on

201

≥ 15% genetic divergence in the LTAg gene [36]. Seven PyVs shared 86-90% identity with the

202

closest known species or with each other in the LTAg gene, therefore showing insufficient

203

divergence; however, all were identified for the first time in their specific bat hosts. Furthermore,

204

these PyVs were exclusively detected in bat species separated by considerable distances (≥ 564 ±

205

328 km) (Fig 3 and S2 Table). They could therefore be considered novel PyV species, a proposal

206

further reinforced by additional correlation provided by the genetic selection analysis described

207

below [36]. Ra-Hl PyV and Ra-Mh PyV, exhibited 66% and 77% nt sequence identities in their

208

LTAg coding sequences with the closest known PyV, could therefore be proposed as novel PyV

209

species. However, the nomenclature for these PyVs requires further discussion as inter-family

210

host-switching is unprecedented for mammalian PyVs [36].

Phylogenetic analysis and identification of host-switching events.

217

In order to verify the host-switching events, an LTAg amino acid tree was constructed to

218

compare the 28 new PyVs with 126 known Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus species (including 38

219

bat-borne PyV reference species). As shown in Fig 4, 28 new bat PyVs (colored in the figure)

220

clustered within the Alphapolyomavirus (n=19) and Betapolyomavirus (n=9) genera along with

221

38 known bat PyVs. Within each viral genus, bat PyV sequences grouped into 7 clusters, referred

222

to here as Alpha 1-7 and Beta 1-7, respectively. Among these novel PyVs, two viruses, Ra-Hl

223

PyV in the Alphapolyomavirus and Ra-Mh PyV in the Betapolyomavirus genera, were identified

224

in bat hosts of different families living in the same colony, suggestive of two viral host-switching

225

events, labeled as host-switching event 1 and 2 (HS1 and 2 in Fig 4). Furthermore, a third PyV

226

clustered in the phylogenetic tree with PyVs carried by bats of different families (Hipposideridae

227

and Rhinolophidae), indicative of another inter-family host-switching event (HS3 in Fig 4).

228

The first host-switching event HS1 in the Alpha 3 cluster (Fig 4) occurred between Rh. affinis

229

(family Rhinolophidae) and H. larvatus (family Hipposideridae). Strikingly, Ra-Hl PyV,

230

characterized in Rh. affinis (Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5) and H. larvatus (Hipposideros

231

larvatus polyomavirus 1), exhibited 100% nt identity between both genomes. Importantly, they

232

were detected in multiple animals and, also, from different colonies. The Rhinolophus affinis

233

polyomavirus 5 was detected in two colonies (colonies 16 and 17 separated 10 km apart in south

234

Guangxi province in southern China) with detection rates of 1/22 and 8/28, respectively. Notably,

235

the Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1 was also detected in colonies 16 and 17 in H. larvatus,

236

also in Guangxi province, with positive rates of 3/19 and 2/10, respectively.

237

The host-switching event HS2 in the Beta 5 cluster (Fig 4) occurred between Rh. affinis

238

(family Rhinolophidae) and My. horsfieldii (family Vespertilionidae), involving Ra-Mh PyV

239

characterized in Rh. affinis (Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3) and in My. horsfieldii (Myotis

240

horsfieldii polyomavirus 3). These PyV strains were also extremely close genetically but not

241

identical, sharing 97-99% nt genomic identity. Ra-Mh PyV was frequently detected in both hosts:

242

Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 was detected in five colonies of Rh. affinis bats in Yunnan,

243

Guangxi and Fujian provinces (23%; 43/188), in which 7 full genomes shared 97-100% nt

244

identity in their LTAg coding sequences (marked with black circles in Fig 3). The Myotis

245

horsfieldii polyomavirus 3 had a high positive rate 63.8% (23/36) in My. horsfieldii bats within a

246

single colony (colony 24 Fig 1 and S1 Table) where, notably, Rh. affinis and My. horsfieldii

247

species roosted together. In this cave, Rh. affinis also harbored Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus

248

3 with a 57% (12/21) detection rate. Geographically, Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 was

249

widely distributed in Rh. affinis hosts.

250

The third host-switching event, HS3, in the Alpha 7 cluster (Fig 4) occurred between A.

251

stoliczkanus (family Hipposideridae) and Rhinolophus spp. (family Rhinolophidae). The

252

Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 exhibited 87% and 86% nt identity with Rhinolophus

253

affinis polyomavirus 2 and Rhinolophus pearsonii polyomavirus 2, respectively (Fig 3). The two

254

sampling locations of the Rhinolophus species were from caves located 731 km and 86 km

255

respectively from the cave in which the single Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 positive

256

sample was detected.

257

Besides these three host-switching events, a PyV-positive rectal tissue sample, named

258

Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 [strain PyV10-YXAC25], collected from a

259

Pipistrellus pipistrellus (family Vespertilionidae) bat in colony 28 in northwestern Xinjiang

260

exhibited 98% nt identity in a partial VP1 fragment (~270 nt) with Rattus norvegicus

261

polyomavirus 1 (detected in German rats) [35] in the Alphapolyomavirus genus (marked as

262

host-switching event HS4 in Fig 2). A qPCR protocol designed to detect both the previously

263

described rat PyV and the P. pipistrellus PyV was employed to screen samples comprising spleen,

264

kidney, lung, liver, rectal and brain tissues in all P. pipistrellus bats (n=158) collected in three

265

locations in Xinjiang in 2016. Also screened were rectal and kidney tissues from brown rats

266

(n=51) available from collections in two other locations in Xinjiang during 2015-2016 [38]. The

267

original PyV10-YXAC25 isolate yielded CT values of 36-38 upon repeated testing, indicative of

268

very low copy numbers of target. An additional lung tissue sample derived from another P.

269

pipistrellus bat from the same colony in which the original PyV10 was detected was also positive,

270

with a higher viral load (CT: 34) by qPCR. No rat samples were positive. Despite repeated

271

attempts to amplify by inverse PCR, no genomes were recovered from the bat samples.

272
273

Correlation of genetic divergences between PyVs and bat hosts.

274

As shown in Fig 3 and 4, although seven new PyVs showed high LTAg nt identities (86-90%)

275

with each other or the closest known PyVs, the phylogenetic clustering supported codivergence

276

279

Rhinolophus ferrumequinum polyomavirus 2 shared 89% identity with Rhinolophus simulator

280

polyomavirus 1 (LC269978) previously identified in Zambian bats (Alpha 7); and Rhinolophus

281

ferrumequinum polyomavirus 1 shared 90% identity with Rhinolophus simulator polyomavirus 3

282

(LC269980) also identified in Zambian bats (Alpha 6). These last two instances showed that

283

PyVs from Chinese and African horseshoe bats were remarkably similar despite the geographical

284

separation.

285

To investigate further the factors potentially influencing the divergence between PyVs with

286

high nt sequence identities, Mantel’s correlation tests were performed to compare the divergence

287

among PyV genome sequences with those among cytb genes of their corresponding hosts and to

288

control the putative effects of the geographic location on the bat collection. As shown in Table 3,

289

correlation analysis was performed using three groups of data: 1) a total of 42 PyVs with full

290

genomes from the present study; 2) a total of 48 PyVs including the 42 PyV genomes described

291

here and 6 PyV genomes we previously identified in Zambian horseshoe bats [26]; 3) a total of

292

37 PyVs obtained by removing 11 PyVs (marked in Fig 4 which potentially arose by

293

host-switching events) from the 48 PyVs identified in both China and Zambia. Analysis of each

294

of these three groups of data showed that there was negligible correlation between geographical

295

distances and divergence for either hosts or viruses. Moreover, the geographical proximity

296

between the colonies had little effect on the co-evolution of viruses with their respective hosts.

297

Analysis using the first group of data showed that a significant correlation existed between

298

host and PyV divergence per genus considering the 42 genomes identified in China. The

299

correlation between bat hosts and PyVs in the Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera was 0.47 (P

301

divergence model of PyV and hosts, with multiple viral lineage duplications, in support of a

302

previous model of PyV evolution [17]. The addition of PyV sequences sampled from African

303

Rhinolophus spp. [26] increased the correlation index between host and viral divergence as the

304

number of considered sequences increased. Altogether, these findings support an intra-host

305

divergence model for the radiation of PyV species within the order Chiroptera. In the third group,

306

by removing 8 sequences (also marked as host switching lineages in Fig 4) in the Alpha- and 3 in

307

the Betapolyomavirus genera, which, notably, included host-switching events (HS1-HS3) from

308

both PyV genera, the correlation indices increased 40% and 30%, respectively.

Bayesian estimation of tMRCA of bat hosts and PyVs.

313

To test whether the host-switching events of the PyV species occurred after the divergence of

314

host species, the times to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of both bat hosts and the PyVs

315

were estimated employing a Bayesian approach. As shown in Fig 5A, the tMRCA of bat hosts

316

were estimated based on the cytb sequences (~1800 bp) of bats that harbored the 28 novel PyVs.

317

The results showed that divergence among Rhinolophus species happened 14.2 to 17.3 million

318

years ago (MYA) with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD), which is consistent with

319

previously reported divergence times (16–17 MYA) of the bat hosts based on mitochondrial

320

DNA [39] and other sampled bat families [40]. The Bayesian results for PyV divergence times

321

(Fig 5B) also showed that the tMRCAs for both Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera were

322

115-182 MYA with 95% HPD, overlapping with the divergence times of the tMRCA of placental

323

mammals (92 to 116 MYA) [41]. However, when compared with the Bayesian results for the bat

324

hosts, the time scale of PyV divergence was not always in agreement: specifically, 1) the

325

divergence time between Rhinolophus and Hipposideros hosts was estimated with a median 36.3

326

MYA in the 95% HPD range (34, 38) MYA, while the tMRCAs of Rhinolophus affinis

327

polyomavirus 5 and Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1 were estimated with a median of 0.02

328

MYA in the 95% HPD range (0.0012, 0.12) MYA; 2) The tMRCAs of Myotis horsefieldii

329

polyomavirus 3 and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 had a median of 1.05 MYA in the 95%

330

HPD range (0.4, 1.9) MYA, while the median tMRCA of both corresponding host species was

331

66.76 MYA in the 95% HPD range (60.9, 73.5) MYA; 3) The median tMRCA of Rhinolophus

332

affinis polyomavirus 2 and Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was estimated as 11.61 MYA

333

in the 95% HPD range (6.6, 17.8) MYA, however, the tMRCA between both hosts had a median

334

of 36.3 MYA in the 95% HPD range (34.3, 38.2) MYA. Finally, 4) the estimated time of

335

divergence between Scotophillus kuhlii polyomavirus 2 and Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus

336

1, with a median of 37 MYA in the 95% HPD range (23, 54) MYA, was less than the predicted

337

divergence time between the hosts, with a median of 44.42 MYA in the 95% HPD range (40, 49)

338

MYA. In the four examples, the most parsimonious explanation for the lesser median ages to

339

divergence of the PyVs compared to the longer tMRCAs for the bat hosts is that these represent

340

examples of inter-family viral host-switching events.

341
342

Intra-lineage host duplication and host-switching events during bat PyV evolution.

343

The findings of the Mantel test and other studies [17] supporting intra-host divergence for PyVs,

344

required reconciliation with the compelling evidence of similar viral species infecting

345

evolutionarily distant bat species. Co-phylogenetic reconstruction analyses using JANE 4 were

346

therefore performed separately for both viral genera. The best-supported solution to explain the

347

divergence in the genus Alphapolyomavirus for the novel Chinese PyVs and African samples was

348

modeled with 11 co-speciations, 4 lineage duplications, 13 lineage losses and 9 host-switching

349

events (Fig 6A). Among the 9 inferred host-switching events, in agreement with the tMRCA

350

estimations, it was implied that Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 originated in the lineage

351

which gave rise to Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1, Rhinolophus sinicus polyomavirus 1

352

and 2, and Scotophilus kuhli polyomavirus 2 indicating that Rh-Hl PyV was originally a PyV

353

harbored by Rh. affinis, which was subsequently transmitted to H. larvatus. The best-supported

354

solution also suggested that the lineage of Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 had given rise to

355

Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1. Other host-switching events inferred earlier in the

356

divergence among PyVs were more difficult to corroborate with the available tMRCA data.

357

Divergence in the genus Betapolyomavirus involved 6 co-speciations, 2 lineage duplications, 7

358

lineage losses and 7 host-switching events (Fig 6B). Similar to the Alphapolyomavirus genus, the

359

solution for the Betapolyomavirus genus suggested, among the 7 host-switching events, that the

360

origin of Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus 3 was as a descendant of the lineage giving rise to

361

Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 (i.e. that Rh-Mh PyV was originally a PyV harbored by Rh.

362

affinis and transmitted to My. horsfieldii), in agreement with the tMRCA results. In both solutions,

363

although the presence of duplication events could explain the existence of more than one

364

different viral species in the same host species, in multiple instances the dissimilarity between

365

viral species from the same host species was more easily explained by host-switching events

366

following the divergence between host species.

370

Given the diversity of viral species identified in the genus Rhinolophus, viral proteins under

positive selection during the evolution of the different PyV lineages were of interest as possible

372

speciation determinants. We performed a Bayesian analysis to calculate the ω rate (dN/dS) to

373

identify genomic regions of the Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera in Rhinolophus PyV

374

clusters, which were likely subject to positive selection (S3 Fig). As expected, the majority of the

375

horseshoe bat PyV genomes were found to be under neutral or negative selection (ω values ≤ 1);

376

however, a number of residues in VP2, VP1, LTAg and STAg proteins did show evidence of

377

positive selection (ω values > 1) in both viral genera (shown in red in S3 Fig) and amino acid

378

residues relative to human BK virus (species of Human polyomavirus 1) and simian virus 40

379

(species of Macaca mulatta polyomavirus 1) are detailed in S5 Table. We focused on the major

380

capsid protein VP1 as this determines antigenicity and the engagement of sialylated glycans

381

present on host glycoproteins and glycolipids during cellular attachment and entry in mammalian

382

(murine, human and monkey) viruses [42-46].

383

In the Rhinolophus alphapolyomavirus cluster, 11 residues were found under positive selection,

384

located in four regions of VP1 (S5 Table): in the BC-loop (D77, N79 and V82), the DE-loop

385

(L135, A139 and T143), the HI loop (N274, N275 and S279) and the C-terminal residues I367

386

and N369. In the Rhinolophus betapolyomavirus cluster, 9 residues had ω values > 1 at the

387

N-terminus (K17), in the BC loop (A75, A77, T80, V82 and P84), the DE loop (N134 and Q149)

388

and the EF loop (S178). No positively selected amino acids were identified in the interior of the

389

major

capsid

protein.

Discussion

391

While mammalian PyVs are highly host specific [12] there are data suggesting cross-species

392

jumps of PyVs between closely related mammalian hosts. Previously, short-range intra-genus

393

host-switching events of PyVs were identified in African horseshoe bats, occurring between Rh.

394

simulator and Rh. blasii in a single Zambian cave [26]. Strikingly, the genomes of PyVs

395

characterized in respective bat species were 99.9% identical and contained only four virus

396

species-specific polymorphisms. Importantly, these polymorphisms were found to be present in

397

both spleen and kidney samples of each bat host species, indicating a systemic and productive

398

infection. The genetic stability and restricted host-specificity of mammalian PyVs had previously

399

suggested a model of strict codivergence for PyV evolution [47]. However, this is inconsistent

400

with family-wide patterns of diversity, where an important contribution of intra-host lineage

401

duplication, recombination and, possibly, host-switching events is evident. A model of intra-host

402

divergence, with these additional evolutionary processes, occurring over the ancient timescales

403

for association of PyVs with multicellular life, has been proposed to explain the extant diversity

404

within the family Polyomaviridae [17]. The findings in the present study extend these

405

observations to PyVs in Chinese horseshoe bats and other bat hosts (see model in Fig 7) and

406

provide the first definitive evidence of inter-family host-switching of PyVs in mammals

407

occurring among the bat families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae.

408

The host-switching events of PyVs identified in the present study indicate that transmission of

409

PyVs between different bat species has been an ongoing process during the evolutionary history

410

of PyVs. HS1 and HS2 occurred between bats of different families and strains of PyVs sharing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/627158; this version posted May 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

411

100% or 97-100% nt identity were characterized in their respective hosts. The tMRCA analysis

412

estimated that HS1 and HS2 occurred between 0.02-1.05 MYA. Considering the “slow”

413

evolutionary rate of PyVs (8  10−9 substitutions per site per year as previously estimated [48]),

414

the transmission events of Rh-Hl PyV and Rh-Mh PyV in bats happened recently, with a small

415

number of mutations accumulating in the viral genomes during viral adaptation to the permissive

416

hosts. Compared with HS1 and HS2, HS3 was estimated to have occurred much earlier, between

417

6.6-17.8 MYA, with the Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 showing 87% nt identity with

418

the closest PyV (Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2), indicating that the former had been

419

transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to A. stoliczkanus bats for a long period of time, had

420

co-evolved with A. stoliczkanus and, finally, had formed a novel PyV species. In addition to

421

these observed host switching events, the tMRCA estimation and correlation analysis showed

422

strikingly that numerous PyVs had also been derived from host switching, thereby shaping the

423

evolutionary history of PyVs and providing evidence that inter-species transmission of PyVs, at

424

least in bats, is not as rare as previously thought.

425

An issue raised by the present study is how to define and name a PyV species when

426

inter-family host-switching events of PyV are identified. The ICTV criteria for the formal

427

designation of PyV species in mammals must include the binomial name of the host species [36];

428

nevertheless, the inter-family host-switching events of PyVs discovered in the present study as

429

well as the inter-species host-switching event also identified in Rhinolophus hosts in a previous

430

study [26] which has challenged this nomenclature system for bat PyVs. Furthermore, numerous

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/627158; this version posted May 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY 4.0 International license.

431

host-switching lineages have also been characterized here by correlation analyses and dating

432

estimation. All these findings suggest that host-switching of PyVs has occurred not only in

433

different bat species but also at different time points in different geographical locations. The

434

ICTV nomenclature criteria should therefore be updated to include recognition of PyVs derived

435

from two different mammalian host species.

436

Inter-species transmission has already been observed in bird PyVs such as budgerigar

437

fledgling disease PyV (BFDV), which can infect multiple avian species with pronounced

438

pathogenicity [49]. Nevertheless, the ICTV nomenclature has utilized only the order level of the

439

host species in the naming scheme: for instance, species belonging to BFDV have been classified

440

as Aves polyomavirus 1. This naming scheme could also be expanded using the more descriptive

441

host species, as with the mammalian PyV species. So far, PyVs with host-switching events have

442

only involved two host species, illustrating the limited ability of PyVs for transmission between

443

different mammalian hosts. Therefore, the improved naming scheme of novel PyVs with

444

host-switching events proposed here would include the binomial names of both host species; e.g.,

445

Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Rh-Hl PyV), identified in the present

446

study, would become the prototype of a new species named Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros

447

larvatus polyomavirus 1.

448

Another ICTV criterion is the allowable genetic distance of the LTAg coding sequence (≥

449

15%) to demarcate PyV species. This cut-off value is not strict, as exemplified by two PyVs

450

identified in two different species of squirrel monkeys which shared 89% sequence identity but

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/627158; this version posted May 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

451

were recognized as two separated PyV species [36]. In the present study, we have discovered

452

numerous novel PyVs carried by diverse bat species, all exhibiting 86-90% sequence identities

453

with their closest known species or with each other. These should be considered new PyV species

454

since all were detected exclusively in distinct bat species in different areas and exhibiting strict

455

host specificity. Examples include the PyVs identified in different Rhinolophus bat species from

456

China and Africa sharing 89-90% nt identify. The correlation and genetic selection analysis

457

reported here has shown that the high sequence identity of different PyVs carried by different

458

host species was due to the co-divergence with strong negative selection of PyVs in respective

459

hosts, indicating that the ≥ 15% cut-off in LTAg gene identity for species demarcation is perhaps

460

no longer adequate and should be updated to ≥10%. With regard to the relationship between

461

Chinese and African bat PyVs referred to above, it is of interest to note that hepadnaviruses

462

(pararetroviruses with DNA genomes) identified in Chinese Rhinolophus bats in another study

463

[49] were also found to exhibit the closest genetic relation (79.6–79.7% nt identify) with viruses

464

carried by African Rhinolophus bats, [50] thereby suggesting that co-divergence of DNA viruses

465

within their Rhinolophus bat hosts is relatively common.

466

In the present study we have identified 28 novel PyVs from 15 bat species in 6 families [36], a

467

finding that has considerably increased our knowledge of both the genomic diversity and the

468

evolution of PyVs. Additionally, since there is a dearth of commercially available, standardized

469

bat cell lines for isolation and identification of bat-borne viruses there are now added options to

470

establish immortalized bat cell lines from many bat species by using LTAg genes cloned from

471

divergent PyVs identified in specific Chinese bat species. At present, the Tb1 Lu cell line derived

472

from the free-tailed bat (Tardarida brasiliensis, family Molossidae) is currently the only bat cell

473

line available in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Nr. CCL-88) [51]. Recently,

474

however, Banerjee et al. [52] have reported immortalization of primary bat kidney cell lines from

475

the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, family Vespertilionidae) which were stably transformed by a

476

plasmid harboring a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, family Vespertilionidae) PyV LTAg. The

477

ability to establish cell lines from different tissues of diverse bat species and to make these

478

available to researchers is a prerequisite for replication studies, virus-host interactions and new

479

virus discoveries.

480

Papillomaviruses (PVs), which are closely related to PyVs and share similar properties such

481

as, high genetic stability and strict host specificity, have been shown to cause transient and

482

potentially cross-species infections. García-Pérez et al. [53] reported that PVs do not follow strict

483

host restrictions in free-ranging Iberian bats (Eptesicus serotinus, family Vespertilionidae), as

484

they found evidence of host-switching events between two different bat species (E. serotinus and

485

E. isabellinus). They therefore recommended a revised paradigm of strict host specificity in PVs

486

[53].

487

The findings presented here have possible implications for the study of zoonotic transmissions

488

involving highly virulent viral pathogens in bats. For example, horseshoe bats within the family

489

Rhinolophidae have been found to harbor genetically diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome

490

(SARS)-like corona viruses, which acted as major reservoirs for spillover of SARS coronavirus

491

to humans [7]. The Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has similarly been

492

transmitted via dromedary camels, it has been shown to be closely related to several bat

494

coronaviruses, including those sequenced from species within the family Vespertilionidae

495

(Neoromicia capensis, Pipistrellus abramus and Vespertilios uperans) [54]. Recently, swine

496

acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) coronavirus has been associated with high morbidity and

497

mortality in pig populations in Guangdong province, China in close proximity to the origin of the

498

SARS pandemic, and striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in

499

geographical, temporal, ecological and etiological settings exist [9]. We consider noteworthy that

500

in the present study we identified host-switching events of the normally highly host-restricted

501

PyVs within the bat families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. Whether this reflects a greater

502

propensity for host-switching in these bat families when compared with others and what

503

mechanisms are involved require further functional studies. Conceivably, given the high

504

prevalence we and others have detected of bat PyVs, co-infection of bat species within the

505

families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae may affect the prevalence and/or transmission of

506

CoVs and other high virulent pathogens in bats. This suggestion warrants further study.

507

Our findings that inter-family transmission of PyVs can occur in mammals may also have

508

implications for studies of viral oncogenesis proposed previously for the Polyomaviridae. For

509

example, three bovine PyVs (BoPyVs) have been identified in cattle [55] with more likely given

510

the 13 so far identified as infectious agents in humans [56]. Intriguingly, BoPyV2, occupies the

511

same clade as Merkel cell PyV which is causally implicated in oncogenic transformation in a

512

neuroendocrine carcinoma of the elderly. BoPyV3, is also related to human polyomavirus 6

513

which has been reported in non-melanoma skin cancers, specifically keratocanthomas [57].

514

Colorectal cancer has been suggested to have an infectious disease etiology [58] and the

515

relatively high thermoresistance of PyVs may preclude inactivation by lowered cooking

516

temperatures [59]. Similarly, in field studies, sequences of BK virus were identified by

517

metagenomics in the feces of non-human primates [60]. Our evidence that inter-family

518

transmission of PyVs can occur in bats provides a precedent for studies of longer-range

519

transmission of PyVs in mammals.

520

In addition to three bat inter-family host-switching events of PyVs, we also identified a partial

521

VP1 fragment in rectal tissue of a P. pipistrellus bat collected in northwestern Xinjiang that

522

showed 98% nt identity with the VP1 of a previously described Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus

523

1 identified in Germany [35]. Further qPCR assay also detected the virus in lung tissue of another

524

P. pipistrellus bat but not from any brown rat (n=51) collected in the same Xinjiang area. This

525

preliminary observation provides an impetus to investigate potential PyV host-switching between

526

mammal species beyond families.

527

The host-switching events identified in this study were strongly associated with the ecological

528

environment of the hosts, with host-switching only identified between different bat species in one

529

to two colonies. Our study suggests that PyVs can transmit between different mammalian hosts

530

between two different animal families by frequent contact of hosts within specific environments,

531

such as the densely packed bat populations that occur in large hibernacula in caves. The

532

host-switching PyVs were identified from rectal tissues of multiple individuals, indicating that

533

shedding via feces is a key factor for viral transmission by the fecal-oral route between different

534

host species.

535

PyV attachment to target cells is mediated by cell surface receptors. MHC class I acts as a

536

co-receptor and SV40 employs the ganglioside GM1 as receptor [61]. The finding that

537

gangliosides are also primary receptors for human PyVs via VP1 [62] suggests that this may be a

538

general property for primate PyVs although whether this is applicable to other mammalian PyVs,

539

including bats, is unknown. In the present study, amino acid residues in VP1 were found to be

540

under positive selection in Rhinolophus PyVs in the BC, DE and HI loops (Alphapolyomavirus)

541

and in the BC, DE and EF loops (Betapolyomavirus). Interestingly, both Rhinolophus PyV genera

542

showed evidence of positive selection in the external surface BC and DE loops. In BK virus,

543

serological subtypes are assigned based on mutations present within the BC loop [63]. It has also

544

been previously demonstrated that sialylated glycans can act as primary receptors for PyVs [64]

545

and binding to sialic acid moieties was attributed to amino acids residues within the BC, DE and

546

HI loops, suggesting that these VP1 domains play a key role in virus attachment and cellular

547

entry events [45]. The surface loops of VP1, i.e. the BC, DE, HI and EF loops, are responsible for

548

viral antigenicity and escape mutants cluster in these regions, suggesting they represent

549

conformational epitopes recognized by host neutralizing antibodies [65, 66]. VP1 surface loops

550

form a unique virus-host interaction conformation that determines the host range, cellular tropism

551

and pathogenicity which may explain the enrichment of positive selected residues within these

552

regions [67]. The availability of annotated bat genomes in the future, as proposed by the genome

553

consortium Bat1K [68], and annotation of the genes encoding putative entry receptors (such as,

554

for example, the cell surface ganglioside and other sialylated glycan receptors) from within the

555

bat families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae from species previously found

to harbor identical or closely related viruses would facilitate the functional characterization of the

557

cellular receptors/attachment factors and of which amino acid residues in VP1 are required for

558

binding and entry. Availability of annotated bat genomes would also help determine whether

559

certain families of bats are more susceptible than others to virus-host switching events.

581

gene developed by Johne et al. in 2005 [27] was employed to screen all metagenomic samples,

582

and partial VP1 amplicons were cloned and bidirectionally sequenced by standard methods. In

583

addition, the PCR was expanded to screen genomic DNA extracts from rectal tissues of bats

584

collected from other Chinese provinces.

585

Genomic DNA from each bat tissue sample was extracted manually using the TIANamp

586

Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR screening

587

employed the PCR master mix (Tiangen) with the following thermocycling conditions: 45 cycles

588

for both outer and inner PCRs with denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 46°C (outer PCR)

589

or 56°C (inner PCR) for 30 s or 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with ddH2O as a

590

negative control. Positive PCR amplicons were purified by gel extraction (Axygen) and

591

sequenced directly on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Genewiz) to confirm homology to PyVs and then

592

ligated into vector pMD-18T (TaKaRa) and used to transform E. coli DH5α competent cells

593

(Tiangen). Four clones from each VP1 amplicon were picked for Sanger sequencing. GenBank

accession numbers of 192 partial PyV VP1 sequences are showed in S3 Table.

595

Oligonucleotide primers for inverse PCRs for amplification of the 5 kb PyV genomes were

596

design based on the partial VP1 sequences. Multiple pairs of hemi-nested degenerate primers

597

were subsequently designed for VP1 clusters which showed close phylogenetic relationships (see

598

S6 Table). All ~5 kb products were amplified from bat genomic DNA by inverse PCR employing

599

the PrimeSTAR MAX DNA polymerase (Takara), purified by gel extraction (Axygen), cloned

600

into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and bidirectionally sequenced by primer walking to

sequences, the full genomes of each PyV were assembled by Geneious software using the partial

603

VP1 and 5 kb products.

604

A real-time PCR (qPCR) method (S6 Table) was established based on a 59 nt fragment of the

605

VP1 genes of Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 and Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus

pipistrellus bats (n=158) collected in three locations in Xinjiang in 2016 and also rectal and

608

kidney tissues from brown rats (n=51) available from collections in two other locations in

609

Xinjiang during 2015-2016 (S1 Table). The extracted DNAs from the tissues were amplified

Phylogenetic analysis.

614

The pairwise identity of the LTAg coding sequences was calculated with Sequence Demarcation

615

Tool (SDT) v1.2 [70]. The nucleotide sequence of host cytb, the sequences of PyV genes and

616

proteins were aligned using MAFFT under the algorithm FFT-NS-i [71]. Phylogenetic trees were

617

inferred using MrBayes v3.2, with 106 generations chains to ensure < 0.01 standard deviations

618

between the split frequencies and 25% of generations discarded as burn-in [72], as described

619

previously [73]. For the LTAg multiple-sequence alignment, a mixed substitution model was

620

used to explore the best substitution model when inferring the topology. On the other hand, the

621

best fitting nucleotide substitution models for host cytb and the PyV LTAg coding sequence

622

alignments were chosen with MEGA7 [74] by choosing the lowest Bayesian information

criterion (BIC).

624

The tMRCA for hosts and viral samples were estimated with Bayesian analyses conducted as

625

4 independent MCMC chains of 10 million generations each, sampled every 1,000 generations

626

(BEAST v2.4.6 [75]). The cytb and LTAg gene multiple sequence alignments were used to infer

627

the divergence times among hosts and PyVs, respectively. The general time-reversible

628

substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of

629

invariable sites (GTR+G+I) were assumed for both models. Other settings were: uncorrelated

630

lognormal relaxed molecular clocks for host and PyV models with a Bayesian skyline population

631

and exponential population models, respectively. These models chosen had the highest likelihood

632

when compared to other models with the PathSampler application in BEAST v2.4.6 package. The

633

host model was calibrated with divergence times between genera as inferred by Agnarsson [40]

634

and the PyV model was calibrated following Buck et al. [17, 76].

635
636

Correlation analysis.

637

The divergence correlation between the hosts and PyVs in the Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus

638

genera was assessed by applying Mantel’s correlation tests to the pairwise evolutionary distance

639

matrices for hosts and viral samples in both genera with 104 repetitions. Additionally, the

640

matrices were also analysed against the geographical distance between sampling points, and

641

partial correlations between host and polyomavirus distance matrices were estimated controlling

642

for the correlation with the geographical distance. The correlation analysis was performed

643

considering three sets of data per genus: 1) considering only samples identified in China, 2)

644

considering samples identified in China and samples identified in Africa [26], and 3) removing

645

samples from 2) such as the correlation index increased. Removed samples in 3) were chosen by

646

estimating the correlation coefficient without each sample and then removing samples whose

647

absence maximized the correlation between hosts and PyVs.

649

Co-phylogenetic analysis.

650

Mapping the divergence of PyV species to the divergence among hosts was performed with

651

JANE 4 [77]. The solutions for Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera were generated with costs

652

for co-speciation, duplication, loss and host switch events as 0, 1, 1 and 3, respectively. The input

653

was the phylogenetic tree for the host species inferred with mitochondrial cytb sequences, the

654

phylogenetic trees for the Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera inferred with amino acid

655

sequences of the LTAg protein and the table indicating the association between hosts and viruses.

Analysis of natural selection on the evolution of proteins in Rhinolophus PyV species.

in Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera with MrBayes v3.2.6 [72] with NY98 as the codon

660

model for 5×104 generations sampling every 250 and assuring the effective sample size was >

Fig 4. Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the PyV LTAg protein sequences. The tree was

929

constructed with 156 amino acid sequences of 28 new PyVs identified in the present study, and

930

126 PyV references (including 38 bat PyV species references) in Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus

931

genera available in GenBank. Names of new PyVs with their strain names in parentheses at the

932

branch tips are colored differently according to their host species within the Chiropteran family,

933

as shown in the top left-hand corner. Three host-switching events are marked as HS1 to HS3 by

934

opposing arrows. Host switching lineages identified by correlation analyses are also shown with

935

black circles. Silhouettes of the mammalian hosts of PyVs are shown alongside each clade.

936

Bayesian posterior probability supporting the branching is shown next to the branches.

Fig 5. Dating the tMRCA of host bat species employing mitochondrial cytb sequences (A)

940

and PyV species using the LTAg gene (B). Cytb and PyV sequences from this study are colored

941

according to the Chiropteran family of the host species and following the legend in the top

942

right-hand corner. Calibration points of cytb are marked on the branches with black squares (A).

943

Calibration points using PyVs identified from non-human primates and other bat species are

944

shown in the upper section of the phylogeny and marked with black squares (B). The timescale at

945

the bottom of both figures and the tMRCAs shown next to the branches are in millions of years

946

(MYA) before the present. Median age of the tMRCAs of cytb (A) and PyVs (B) are shown next

947

to the branches. In Fig 5B, branches that matched the divergence between host species in Fig 5A

948

are identified with red circles.

S1 Fig. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of partial VP1 nucleotide sequences from

970

PyV positive samples. The tree was constructed with 192 partial VP1 sequences of PyVs in

971

present study (filled circles), and 74 PyV references (including 38 bat PyV species references) in

972

Alpha- and Betapolyomavirus genera downloaded from GenBank. These 192 partial VP1

973

sequences were classified into 44 clusters representing host-switching events (green circles;

974

clusters 7, 10, 17 and 31; red circles: no host switching). GenBank accession numbers of 192

975

partial PyV VP1 sequences in this tree are listed in S3 Table. The tree was generated in MEGA7

976

by the maximum-likelihood method based on the TN93 model and evaluated with 250 bootstrap
