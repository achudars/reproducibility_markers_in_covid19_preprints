Synopsis The first structure of a thrombospondin module 1 domain (TSP1) from a CCN family

matricellular protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure shows a typical threestranded fold, but with an incomplete pi-stacked structure that is usually found in these domains. The
structure reveals highest conservation in the positively charged central segment, which we predict to be
a binding site for heparan sulphates. The atypical features of this domain have been used to revise the
definition of the TSP1 domains and identify a number of new domains in sequence databases.
Abstract

Members of the CCN (Cyr61/CTGF/Nov) family are a group of matricellular regulatory

proteins, essential to a wide range of functional pathways in cell signalling. Through interacting with
extracellular matrix components and growth factors via one of its four domains, the CCN proteins are
involved in critical biological processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, bone development,
fibrogenesis, and tumorigenesis. We present here the crystal structure of the thrombospondin module 1
(TSP1) domain of CCN3 (previously known as Nov), which shares a similar three-stranded fold with
the thrombospondin type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 and Spondin-1, but with variations in the
disulfide connectivity. Moreover, the CCN3 TSP1 lacks the typical pi-stacked ladder of charged and
aromatic residues on one side of the domain, as seen in other TSP1 domains. Using conservation
analysis among orthologous domains, we show that a charged cluster in the centre of the domain is the
most conserved site and predict it to be a potential functional epitope for heparan sulphate binding. This

1. Introduction

The CCN proteins are a family of intriguing matricellular proteins, playing regulatory roles in various
cellular signalling processes and a range of critical biological functions. There are six members within
this protein family in humans, designated CCN1-6 (Brigstock et al., 2003). The CCN acronym was
derived from the three prototypical members: Cyr61 (cysteine-rich protein 61)/CCN1, CTGF
(connective tissue growth factor)/CCN2, and Nov (Nephroblastoma overexpressed gene)/CCN3 (Bork,
1993). The Wnt-inducible proteins, Wisp1-3, are later defined as the three remaining members (CCN46) of the family (Pennica et al., 1998).
The CCN proteins have been shown to be involved in developmental processes such as angiogenesis,
osteogenesis, proliferation and differentiation (Kubota & Takigawa, 2007; Katsube et al., 2009; Kawaki
et al., 2011; Hara et al., 2016); as well as being responsible for diseased states of inflammation, fibrosis,
and various types of cancer (Kular et al., 2011; Riser et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2018).
However, the molecular mechanism underlying the functions and regulations of the CCN proteins are
poorly understood, mostly due to the large number of ligands that have been reported to interact with
the CCN proteins and the variety of signalling pathways they are involved in. While CCN proteins have
been shown to activate specific signalling pathways, direct receptors for these proteins have not yet
been identified. There is also an increasing amount of evidence that CCN proteins, sometimes referred
to as growth factors, affect several signalling pathways via direct interactions with cytokines and
extracellular matrix components. For instance, CCN2 downregulates bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP)-2 and -4-mediated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and the activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways, thereby inhibiting embryogenesis and chondrocyte proliferation (Abreu et
al., 2002; Maeda et al., 2009). Signalling by other growth factors, such as the transforming growth
factor β (TGFβ), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) have also been shown to be affected by the CCN proteins (Abreu
et al., 2002; Inoki et al., 2002; van Roeyen et al., 2008; Nishida et al., 2011; Aoyama et al., 2012).
Furthermore, the modulation of the signal transduction by the CCN proteins can also be achieved by
association with extracellular matrix components. These include sulphated proteoglycans, fibronectin,
decorin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), Notch, and integrins (Chen et
al., 2000; Yoshida & Munakata, 2007; Vial et al., 2011; Gao & Brigstock, 2003; Sakamoto et al., 2002;
Tan et al., 2009). Despite this wealth of information, the molecular determinants of the interactions of
CCN proteins with other molecules are still to be elucidated.

Another feature contributing to the complexity of their molecular functions is that, like many other
extracellular proteins, the CCN proteins are a mosaic of structurally distinct domains. Four discrete
cysteine-rich domains, an insulin-like growth factor binding domain (IB), a von Willebrand factor C
domain (vWC), a Thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1), and a C-terminal cystine-knot domain
(CTCK), make up the primary structure of the CCN proteins (Bork, 1993). A short, variable hinge
region separates the N-terminal IB and vWC domains from the C-terminal TSP1 and CTCK domains.
The CCN family members are highly conserved in their primary structure, with 31-50% pairwise
sequence identity between the six paralogs, except for the absence of the CTCK domain in CCN5
(Brigstock, 2003). The 38 cysteine residues are spread out across the four domains and are nearly
invariant, with the exception of CCN6 that lacks four cysteines in its vWC domain. Small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) analysis has provided us with the first glimpse of the structural arrangements of the
four domains, which shows an extended, non-globular fold, with flexibility between the domains
predicted to facilitate simultaneous ligand binding (Holbourn et al., 2011). A number of studies have
shown that this hinge is prone to proteolysis and the resulting fragments of CCN proteins have been
identified in various tissues (Yang et al., 1998; Perbal et al., 1999; Christine P. Burren et al., 1999; Su
et al., 2001; Roestenberg et al., 2004). A recent work shows that cleavage of CCN2 in this hinge is
required for CCN2-mediated activation of Akt and the ERK pathway, suggesting that the full-length
CCN proteins are latent pro-forms (Kaasbøll et al., 2018).
Despite the wealth of data on CCN proteins’ role in signalling, very little is known of their structure
and interactions at molecular level. We have recently published the structure of the vWC domain of
CCN3 (Xu et al., 2017), but no other high-resolution structures are known for CCN proteins or their
domains. Several structures of IB domains have been determined (PDB IDs: 1h59, 1wqj, 2dsp, 3tjq,
3zxb)(Zesławski et al., 2001; Siwanowicz et al., 2005; Sitar et al., 2006; Eigenbrot et al., 2012; Trachsel
et al., 2012) as well as one structure of CTCK domain (Zhou & Springer, 2014), but given their low
sequence similarity with CCN proteins, relatively little functional predictions can be derived from these
structures.
Here, we present the first crystal structure of the TSP1 domain from CCN3. TSP1 domains, also
previously known as thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), were initially identified in the human
endothelial cell thrombospondin-1 (Lawler & Hynes, 1986) and have turned out to be one of the most
common motifs in extracellular proteins with close to 402 domains in 97 different human proteins

residues, and is characterised by a well conserved pattern of residues containing six cysteines (two of
which are variable – further details below in Results), two arginines, and two tryptophans.
It has been reported that TSP1 domains inhibit angiogenesis through interactions with α3β1 and αvβ3
integrins, CD36 on the endothelial cell surface, as well as sequestering VEGF away from its receptors

(Dawson et al., 1997; Bornstein & Sage, 2002; Inoki et al., 2002). TSP1 domains also typically bear
the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding sites, used for mediation of GAG-dependent cell adhesion
(Clezardin et al., 1997). Neural guidance receptor Unc5 controls the Latrophilin GPCR-FLRT mediated
cell adhesion, where its TSP1 domain is responsible for the octameric complex formation (Jackson et
al., 2016). In the CCN proteins, the TSP1 domain of CCN2 has been found to display the most
promising regenerative effect on chondrocytes and osteoarthritis, compared to the other individual
domains and the full-length CCN2 (Abd El Kader et al., 2014). By solving the first structure of a TSP1
domain in the CCN family, we provide the first insights into the possible molecular functions of the
CCN proteins.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cloning and expression of CCN3 TSP1

The expression construct of rat CCN3 TSP1 domain (residues 195-249, Uniprot: Q9QZQ5) was
amplified by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides (forward – TATATCCATGGATTCTAGTA
TCAACTGCATTGAGCAG, reverse – TATATAAGCTTATTCCCCAGGCTCTTGCTCACAAGG)
from cDNA (kind gift from Dr. Paul Kemp) and cloned into pHAT4 vector (Peränen et al., 1996), which
contains an N-terminal His6-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. For protein expression, the
construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli competent cells and grown on LB-agar plates
containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin overnight. Resulting colonies were cultured in 2-YT medium with
100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C under agitation, until cells reached OD600nm of 0.8-1.0. Protein expression
was induced by 400 µM IPTG for 4h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in
ddH2O, and stored at -20°C.
2.2. Protein refolding and purification

The CCN3 TSP1 domain was expressed insolubly in inclusion bodies and subsequently subjected to
refolding to regain its native conformation. Harvested cells were first lysed using the Emulsiflex C5
homogeniser in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT) with addition of
0.5% (v/v) Ralufon DM detergent. The lysate was incubated with 10 µg/ml DNase I and 4 mM MgCl2
for 20 min at room temperature. Inclusion bodies were separated upon centrifugation and washed twice
by homogenisation in the lysis buffer containing either 0.5 % Ralufon DM or 1 M NaCl, and finally
once with lysis buffer only. Denaturation was achieved by resuspension in 6 M guanidine
hydrochloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, and 25 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine.
The denatured protein was clarified by centrifugation, buffer exchanged to 6 M urea, 20 mM HCl, and
adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Refolding was performed by 1:10 rapid dilution into 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5,
100 mM ethanolamine pH 8.5, 1 M pyridinium propyl sulfobetaine, 2 mM cysteine, 0.2 mM cystine,
and left for 7 days at 4°C. Refolded protein was purified first by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography,

followed by cleavage of the His-tag by TEV protease, and finally by reversed phase chromatography
(ACE® 5 C8-300). Purified protein was lyophilised and resuspended in ddH2O. MALDI mass
spectrometry analysis was used to confirm the molecular weight and the formation of disulfide bonds.
2.3. Crystallisation

Purified CCN3 TSP1 domain at a concentration of 17.6 mg/ml was subjected to crystallisation
experiments in 96-well plates in sitting drops consisting of 100 nl of protein and 100 nl of crystallisation
solution using a number of commercial crystallisation screens. Initial crystal hits were improved by
streak seeding using a rabbit whisker, and larger crystals subsequently appeared in 3.0 M NaCl, 0.1 M
Tris pH 8.0, in 1µl + 1 µl hanging drops. For experimental phasing, derivative crystals were produced
by soaking the native crystals in 6.7 mM K2PtCl4 in mother liquor overnight. The crystals were cryoprotected in 25% (v/v) glycerol and cryo-cooled using liquid nitrogen.
2.4. Data collection, structure determination and refinement

X-ray diffraction data of CCN3 TSP1 were collected at Europe Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF),
beamline ID14-4, using an ADSC Q315r CCD based X-ray detector (ADSC, CA), via remote control
from Cambridge, UK. Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing experiment was
performed for the K2PtCl4 soaked CCN3 TSP1 crystals. Two datasets were recorded for these derivative
crystals, at a wavelength of 1.0717 Å for peak anomalous signals, and at 1.0721 Å for inflection point.
High resolution diffraction data for the native crystals were obtained at wavelength 0.93 Å. Data were
indexed and integrated using iMOSFLM 1.0.7 (Battye et al., 2011), and scaled using Aimless 1.1 (Evans
& Murshudov, 2013) in the CCP4 suite 6.3.0 (Winn et al., 2011). AutoSHARP 2.8.2 (Vonrhein et al.,
2007) was used for MAD phasing. The resulting structure was used as the search model for molecular
replacement by Phaser 2.5.1 (McCoy et al., 2007) for the native dataset. Refinement was performed
using Refmac 5.5 (Vagin et al., 2004) and phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010). Coot 0.7 (Emsley &
Cowtan, 2004) was used for model building and validation. Statistics of data collection and refinement
are shown in Table 1. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data
Bank with accession code 6RK1.

2.5. Conservation analysis

The ConSurf server (https://consurf.tau.ac.il) was used to evaluate the degree of evolutionary
conservation of each amino acid position in the CCN3 TSP1 domain. Protein sequences of TSP1 domain
in different CCN family members across a range of species were extracted from the Ensembl database
(http://www.ensembl.org/index.html, version 76) (Aken et al., 2016), and aligned and scored for
position-specific conservation by the ConSurf Server (Ashkenazy et al., 2016).

A sequence similarity network was constructed using the domain sequences from the four Pfam families
of the TSP1 clan (CL0692): TSP_1 (PF00090), TSP1_spondin (PF19028), TSP1_ADAMTS (PF19030)
and TSP1_CCN (PF19???). One thousand sequences from each family were randomly selected and
used for an all-against-all BLAST search. All pairwise hits with a score above 35 bits were further
loaded into Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) to display the network using the default “Perfuse Force
Directed Layout” method. In order to highlight the structural coverage of the families in the network,
domain sequences in the ECOD database (Cheng et al., 2014) version 248 (23/08/2019) matching any
of the TSP1 Pfam family models were included using the same procedure described here.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The crystal structure of CCN3 TSP1 domain

The structure of CCN3 TSP1 domain was determined by MAD phasing using K2PtCl4 derivative
crystals (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). The three main heavy atom sites are from three platinum atoms bound to
sulfur atoms in methionine residues. One Pt bound to methionine 231 in chain A out of two in the
asymmetric unit with an occupancy of 1, and two Pt bound to two split conformations of the same M231
in the other chain with occupancies of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. Two additional sites with low
occupancies of 0.2-0.3 are from Pt bound to cysteines when dissociated from disulfide bonds as a result
of radiation damage. The structure from MAD phasing was further refined to a resolution of 1.63 Å
using the native dataset (Table 1 and Fig. 1b and c). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are
nearly identical, with an RMSD of 0.345 Å for 44 C atoms.
The CCN3 TSP1 structure exhibits an elongated fold consisting of three antiparallel strands, placing
the N- and C-termini at the opposite ends of the domain. This small domain is stabilised by the three
disulfide bonds from its six cysteines that are distributed all along the sequence. The top disulfide (when
the domain is viewed with its N-terminus pointing up) is formed between C1200- C4229 (superscripted
number refers to the sequential position of the cysteine in the domain) between strands I and III, C2210C5238 links strand I to the end of the β-sheet in strand III in the middle of the domain, and third disulfide
between C3214-C6246 links the turn between strands I and II with the very C-terminus of the domain
(Fig. 1d).
Strand I (N199-C214) is more irregular and rippled, while strands II (G218-L223) and III (Q232-E237)
form a regular anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 1d). In addition to secondary structure-defining interactions
between strands II and III, the structure is stabilised by hydrogen bonds formed between the irregular
strand I and strand II. These include main chain–main chain atoms of Q203 (O)-N226 (N), T205 (N)V222 (O), S208 (N)-T220 (O), and S211 (N)-L218 (O), a pair of side chain–side chain H-bonds of
E202 Oδ with the Nη and Nε of R225, and a few other main chain–side chain H-bonds between strand I
and II (Fig. 1e).

3.2. Conservation analysis of TSP1 in CCN proteins

The surface of CCN3 TSP1 domain shows now significant cavities, as potential binding sites for
ligands. Projection of electrostatic potential on the surface shows a strongly positively charged zone
around the centre of the domain. TSP1 domains are known to bind heparan sulphates (HS) (Guo et al.,
2006) and this patch could form a part of a HS binding site. In the absence of mutagenesis or other data
on functional sites on TSP1 domain, we turned to the analysis of the evolutionary conservation of the
domain. We took all available CCN family proteins from Ensembl genome database and aligned these.
This alignment across higher eukaryotes was mapped on to the CCN3 TSP1 structure using ConSurf
server by colouring according to conservation scores (Fig. 2). In addition to the almost invariant

cysteines, the highest conservation mapped to the central part of the domain, with residues W207, S219,
R221, Q234, and R236 showing 100% conservation in all CCN family TSP1 domains. These residues
are localised in the positively charged cluster and point to the “front” of the domain, as shown in Figure
1. As they are part of the charged/aromatic spine of the domain, it is impossible to say whether they are
conserved for functional or structural reasons, or both.

the conservation scores of the residues (sequence alignment in supplementary Fig. S1 ) onto the
structures. Residues clustered in the most conserved surface patch are labelled.
3.3. Similarity and diversity in TSP1 domains

To analyse the structure further, we collected all other TSP1 domain structures from the PDB. Firstly,
we used Dali server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/, (Holm & Laakso, 2016) to find the
closest homologue from the PDB90 set which contains proteins with maximum 90% pairwise identity.
This revealed sporozoite surface protein 2 (PDB 4hqo) as the closest homologue of CCN3 TSP1
domain, but thrombospondin, F-spondin, Complement C6 and C8 proteins were identified in this search
as related structures. Further TSP1 structures were taken from the Pfam database listing (family
PF00090). List of currently available TSP1 domain structures is shown in supplemental Table S2.
The elongated three-stranded fold is observed in all TSP1 domains. A distinctive feature of the TSP1
domains are the so-called ‘CWR layers’, consisting of the side chain stacking of cystines, tryptophans,
and arginines, as described by Tan et al. (2002). In the thrombospondin-1 repeat 2/3, an array of
tryptophan and arginine residues form multiple π-cation interactions between the aromatic rings and the

planar cationic guanidinium groups; these arginines are often found paired with large polar residues
forming side-by-side hydrogen bondings across the strands. Together with the three “C” layers of
disulfide bridges, these stacked residues form a stabilising spine for this small domain and appear to
provide structural rigidity to it in the absence of a hydrophobic core. The first W layer is in some cases
replaced by another hydrophobic residue (Leu or Tyr in Spondin-1), but otherwise the CWR-stacked
structure is conserved in Spondin-1 repeat 1/4 (Fig. 3a) and structures of other TSP1 domain containing

(Tossavainen et al., 2006; Lovelace et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012; Aleshin et al., 2012). By contrast,
in the CCN3 TSP1 domain the three R layers and three C layers are conserved, but only the third W
layer is present (Fig. 3). The W layers in all TSP1 domains are located in strand I, with their aromatic
side chains extending towards the centre of the structure. The R layers in thrombospondin-1 and
Spondin-1 TSP1 domains are all formed between strands II and III. In CCN3 TSP1, the top R layer is
formed between strands I and II instead. The consequence of the missing top W layer (and the absence
of another hydrophobic residue that could replace it), is that the CCN3 TSP1 domain is more open, with
strand I more separate from the rest of the structure compared with domains that pull the N-terminus
towards the core of the domain by the W layer interactions (Fig. 3).
Another variable feature among the TSP1 domains is the disulfide bond pattern. The three C layers
comprise of one layer at the very top of the structure (when viewed with N-terminus at the top), and
two consecutive layers at the bottom, alternated with W and R layers. The bottom two C layers are
conserved among all TSP1 domains, formed between strands I and III whereas the top C layer varies in
its position and connectivity. In CCNs and Spondins, C4 is located at the top of strand III and disulfide
bonded to C1 at the very N-terminus of strand I. In thrombospondin, C4 forms a disulfide with C3 (which
is missing from CCN-like domains) in the middle of the sequence, at the top of strand II. The differences
in the disulfide connectivity in the first C layer at the top of the domain and the lack of the first W layer
results in larger differences in the structure of CCN3 TSP1 domain compared with other similar
domains. The central W layer in CCN3 ensures that the core of the domain aligns well with other TSP1s.
Typical to a large family of disulfide-rich domains, there are always more subtle variations to the
connectivity. For example, circumsporozoite protein TSP1 domain (PDB 3vdl and 6b0s) (Doud et al.,
2012; Scally et al., 2018) lack the top disulfide and has a long helices containing insertion in loop IIIIII, whereas Micronemal protein 2 (PDB 4okr) (Song & Springer, 2014) contains also a long insertion
in loop II-III with an additional pair of disulfide linked cysteines (supplemental Fig. S2).
Overall, the “canonical” TSP1 domains with C3-C4 connectivity are more structurally conserved with
very well defined layered structure, whereas domains with C1-C4 connectivity have more variable
structures and are difficult to align unambiguously.
This difference in the top C layer can be used to categorise different TSP1 domains in matricellular
proteins. Sequence alignment of selected TSP1 domains with alternative disulfide connectivities shows

that while CCN and Spondin proteins share the same C1-C4 disulfide pattern, ADAMTS (an
extracellular protease), UNC5C (receptor for Netrin), Properdin (a plasma protein), together with
thrombospondin, form the alternative group (Fig. 4). However, the functional implication of this
structural division of disulfide connectivity is as yet unclear.

3.4. Redefinition of TSP1 domain

The existing Pfam family sequence profile (release 32.0) was entirely built from sequences that had
the C3-C4 connectivity. This meant that matches to C1-C4 connectivity domains were partial and
thus missing the first critical cysteine residue. To remedy this, two new Pfam families were
constructed to represent the two subtypes of C1-C4 connectivity TSP1 domains related to those
found in spondins and CCN proteins. These domain families have been deposited in Pfam with
accession names TSP1_spondin (PF19028) and TSP1_CCN (PF19???). A new Pfam clan was also
built to represent TSP1 domains with accession CL0692 (new TSP1 families and the new clan will
be released with version 33.0 of Pfam database). We were further interested to know how common
each of these connectivities were across known TSP1 domains. To investigate this, we constructed
a Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) of all domains and highlighted the different families. The
SSN showed an additional group of sequences that were matching the original TSP1 family but
formed their own separated cluster, so a fourth TSP1 Pfam family was built to represent them. This
new family (PF19030) was found to correspond to a set of domains from ADAMTS proteins which
lack one of the tryptophans, but replace one of the conserved arginines with a hydrophobic residue.
Examples of this domain, for which no structures have been experimentally determined yet, can be

seen as the second and third domains in ADAMTS1 in Figure 4. The complete SSN displaying the
relationships among domains in these three families is shown in Figure 5, along with consensus
sequence logo for each of the three families.
Updating the Pfam domain definitions has several important consequences. Firstly, the overall detection
of TSP1 domains has increased by 17% from 57,847 to 69,393 (Fig. 5). This includes 13 proteins in
SwissProt, four of which are human CCN family members where TSP1 domains were previously not
identified by Pfam. Secondly, the improved definitions allow stronger predictions of the disulphide
connectivity of Pfam domain matches across all known proteins.

Figure 5 New TSP1 domain families. A Sequence Similarity Network (SSN) of TSP1 domains
coloured according to the updated Pfam family definitions. Nodes represent domain sequences and
edges represent BLAST hits with a score above 35 bits. Orange nodes belong to the newly defined CCN
type TSP1 family (PF19028), maroon nodes correspond to spondin-like TSP1 domains, green nodes to
the additional ADAMTS type TSP1 domain family (PF19030), and blue nodes mark the original Pfam
TSP_1 family (PF00090). Domains for which experimental structures are known, as derived from the
ECOD database, are shown as larger grey nodes and labelled by their PDB accession codes. In the Venn
diagram segments of the diagram that do not overlap with the blue circle (original Pfam family
PF00090) represent newly identified TSP1 domains. The sequence logos show the conservation within
each TSP1 family with the height of the letters correlating with conservation.

Second X-ray crystallographic structure of a domain from the enigmatic CCN family of matricellular
proteins has revealed variant form of TSP1 domain with limited pi-cation ladder typical to these

proteins. While functional prediction from this structure of a small domain with limited conservation
being difficult, the structure has helped with definition of the larger TSP1 domain population more
accurately in Pfam domain database and better annotation of these domains in sequence databases.
Methods for the production of CCN proteins and their fragments in high quality will allow us to use
them for further analysis of their molecular functions, identification of interaction partners and
biophysical characterisation of these interactions in vitro. With significant interest in these proteins as
therapeutic targets, in fibrotic conditions in particular, correctly folded proteins will facilitate the
development of neutralising antibodies against CCN proteins as well.
