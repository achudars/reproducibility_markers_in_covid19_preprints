Abstract

27

Males in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia (N. vitripennis, N. giraulti, N. longicornis)

28

have distinct, species specific, head shapes. Fertile hybrids among the species are

29

readily produced in the lab allowing genetic analysis of the evolved differences. In

30

addition, the obligate haploidy of males makes these wasps a uniquely powerful model

31

for analyzing the role of complex gene interactions in development and evolution.

32

Previous analyses have shown that complex gene interactions underpin different

33

aspects of the shape differences, and developmental incompatibilities that are specific

34

to the head in F2 haploid hybrid males are also governed by networks of gene

35

interaction. Here we use the genetic tools available in Nasonia to extend our

36

understanding of the gene interactions that affect development and morphogenesis in

37

male heads. Using artificial diploid male hybrids, we show that alleles affecting head

38

shape are codominant, leading to uniform, averaged hybrid F1 diploid male heads,

39

while the alleles mediating developmental defects are recessive, and are not visible in

40

the diploid hybrids. We also determine that divergence in time, rather than in

41

morphological disparity is the primary driver of hybrid developmental defects. In

42

addition, we show that doublesex is necessary for the male head shape differences, but

43

is not the only important factor. Finally we demonstrate that we can dissect complex

44

interspecies gene interaction networks using introgression in this system.

45

advances represent significant progress in the complex web of gene interactions that

46

govern morphological development, and chart the connections between genomic and

47

phenotypic variation.

Introduction
Form develops in large part through the complex action and interaction of differentiating

51

tissues and cells, and the gene regulatory networks (GRN) acting within them (Davidson et al.

52

2003). Stable changes in form within populations and between species are encoded by changes

53

in the identity or magnitude of connections within and between developmental GRNs

54

(Stathopoulos and Levine 2005; Hinman and Davidson 2007). Some interactions are relatively

55

straightforward, resulting in phenotypes that are near to the expected sum or logical

56

combination of the effects of the alleles alone in a neutral background. These are termed

57

additive effects, and are often the result of independent pathways that contribute to a trait. In

58

contrast, those phenotypes that are significantly different in magnitude and/or sign than the

59

expected combination of alleles are due to the phenomenon of epistasis (Cheverud and

60

Routman 1995). Epistasis among alleles is strongly indicative of direct interaction among the

61

genes involved in producing the epistatic phenotype (Phillips 2008; Werren et al. 2016).

62

Although some studies have argued that nearly all gene interactions are additive (Hill et al.

63

2008), a strong body of literature refute that claim, and even show that apparent additive effects

64

can result from many underlying epistatic interactions (Avery and Wasserman 1992; Cheverud

65

and Routman 1995; Huang et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2014). This discrepancy is likely due to

66

detection bias, whereby statistical constraints limit testing to pairwise interactions, or search for

67

quantitative trait loci (QTL) only among regions that show a significant marginal effect (Wolf et

68

al. 2000). In fact, much epistasis involves chromosome regions that show little marginal effects,

69

and three- or four-way interactions are quite common (Templeton et al. 1976). Non-biased

70

epistatic QTL methods face much greater technical challenges than individual QTL mapping

71

methods, but can be very informative as they simultaneously weigh the mean additive or non-

72

additive effects on phenotype (Carlborg and Haley 2004).

73

While these nonlinear genetic interactions complicate the genotype-to-phenotype map, they are

74

essential in generating complex and quantitative traits. Knowledge of epistatic interactions will

75

deepen our understanding of complex traits, how they are encoded in the genome, and how

76

they evolve (Mackay 2014). Thus investigating developmental GRNs is crucial to understand

77

the genetic basis of form (Phillips 2008). The head is perhaps the most complex morphological

78

feature of the bilaterian body plan. Considerable developmental challenges in patterning and

79

development are encountered as several major sensory organs arise from a common

80

primordium, like the eye-antennal disc, (Domínguez and Casares 2005; Palliyil et al. 2018), and

81

then integrate with other primordia, such the labial disc and gnathal segments (Younossi-

82

Hartenstein et al. 1993).

83

This complexity is reflected in the gene networks underlying head development, and the

84

complex genetic interactions that participate in head development revealed by the highly

85

epistatic nature of pathological syndromes in humans and model organisms (Lidral and Moreno

86

2005; Wolf et al. 2005; Gross et al. 2014). Since these model systems are standard diploids,

87

analysis of complex epistatic interactions suffers from the complications of dominance effects

88

and extremely rapid increase in the number of progeny required to detect gene interactions

89

(Werren et al. 2016). Epistatic interactions among multiple recessive alleles are quite

90

demanding to detect due to the exponentially increasing rarity of progeny homozygous for the

91

required alleles at all loci involved. In diploid organisms the rate of obtaining the correct

92

genotype is ¼X for recessive interacting alleles, where x is the number of loci involved in the

93

producing the epistatic phenotype (Werren et al. 2016).

94

Conversely, use of a haploid model system significantly increases the frequency of the

95

(1/2x for haploids vs 1/4x for diploids) and eliminates interference from dominance effects. The

96

preceding is a major reason why haplodiploid insects in the genus Nasonia show strong

97

promise as model systems for understanding how epistasis and complex interactions among

98

alleles in GRNs that affect the evolution of form (Gadau et al. 2002; Hoedjes et al. 2014). Like

99

all Hymenoptera, Nasonia have haplodiploid genetics, where unfertilized eggs obligate haploid

100

males, and fertilized eggs become diploid females (Werren and Loehlin 2009). Additionally,

Nasonia are small insects easily reared in the lab, have short generation times, can be

102

kept alive under refrigeration for extended periods, have fully annotated genomes, visible and

103

molecular markers and crucially, the ability to make viable, fertile F1 hybrids between all species

104

(Werren and Loehlin 2009; Lynch 2015). Furthermore, there are clearly marked morphological

105

differences between the species, particularly among the haploid males, making evolutionary

106

genetic analysis possible in Nasonia (Beukeboom and Desplan 2003; Werren and Loehlin 2009;

107

Lynch 2015; Werren et al. 2016).

108

The distinctness of male head morphology is particularly apparent in the males of N.

109

giraulti (Werren et al. 2016), (Figure 1, Figure 2A-E, Table S1). Females of all species of the

110

genus, and males of N. vitripennis have a rounded ovoid face shape. In contrast, N. giraulti

111

male faces are mostly square, with consistent width along the length of the face (Figure 1,

112

TableS1). The exception to this square-ness is the cheeks, which protrude ventrally, giving

113

these males a jowly appearance (Werren et al. 2016), (Figure 1, Figure 2E, Table S1).

114

In addition to functional hybrid males with mixtures of morphological features found in

115

the males of the parental species, F2 male hybrid offspring between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti

116

display a wide variety abnormal phenotypes (Werren et al. 2016). These defects include cranial

117

midline furrowing, dorsal-ventral asymmetries, and lateral asymmetries (Werren et al. 2016).

118

Preliminary QTL analyses indicate that all of these abnormalities are largely due to epistatic

119

interactions among alleles of several genes from the two species (Werren et al. 2016).

120

Here, we aim to develop a better understanding of the genetic and developmental origin

121

of the phenotypes we observe between species and among hybrids. Our analyses address

122

several outstanding questions about the nature of the head patterning GRNs of the two species

123

and how alleles interact to produce different hybrid phenotypes by combining interspecies

124

crosses, RNA interference, and cross-species introgression analyses. Questions we address

125

include: 1) Are development defects in hybrid F2 males correlated with divergence time

126

between the species or with degree of morphological divergence? 2) Are the defects due to

127

general developmental instability or to disruption of gene interactions specific to the head? 3)

128

Are the defects primarily due to the exposure of allelic incompatibilities in haploids, or are there

129

dominant alleles involved in the formation of novel structures and shapes arising between the

130

species? We also address the dominance relationships among alleles affecting head shape and

131

the developmental defects observed in hybrid males.

Materials and Methods

134

Hybrid crosses

135

Wolbachia-free and highly inbred strains of N. vitripennis (AsymCx), N. giraulti, (RV2x)

136

and N. longicornis (IV7) (Werren et al. 2010) were used to make hybrids. For each cross a ratio

137

of fifteen females to nine males were allowed 24 hours to mate before provided fly hosts to

138

parasitize. Fifteen to twenty F1 hybrid virgin females from each interspecies cross were then

139

provided hosts to parasitize. Setting females as virgins guarantees all offspring to be haploid

140

males.

Measurements
Heads from male hybrids were stained, mounted and imaged as outlined by Werren et

144

al. 2016. Measurements were taken in Imaris7.1.1 according to parameters also outlined in

145

Werren et al. 2016. Acronyms are as follows: MHW- maximum head width, HL- head length,

146

OIO- interocular distance through ocelli, MIO- maximum interocular distance, AIO- interocular

147

distance across antennal sockets, FE- distance from bottom of eye to center of mandible, FEP-

148

farthest point on cheek perpendicular to line FE (see Figure S1 for diagram). Measurements are

149

presented as ratios to normalize natural difference in overall size of the individual. MHW, OIO,

150

MIO and AIO are normalized in relation to head length (HL) and dividing FEP by FE normalizes

151

cheek size. Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for nonparametric data between two groups,

152

and Bonferroni adjustments made for multiple comparisons. For wild type parent species,

153

comparisons were made among males of each species, among females of each species, and

154

between males and females within each species. Each experimental group was compared

155

individually to N. vitripennis and N. giraulti wild type males. Plots were generated using R (R

156

Core Team 2013), raw averages, standard deviations and significance can be found in Tables

157

S1 and S3.

Analyses of symmetry

160

Heads

161

Head symmetry was measured by Procrustes distance analysis of 105 hybrid male heads as

162

well as 72 wild types (30 N. vitripennis and 28 N. giraulti of equal males and females). Each

163

head was marked at 16 landmarks: One at each ocellus, at the tops and bottoms of each eye, at

164

the maximum arc of each eye, the maximum arc of each cheek, the center point of the

165

mandible, both ends of the MIO, and location of each antennal socket (Figure S1). Landmarks

166

were established three times for each head and coordinates for each landmark were averaged

167

and imported as an array in R (R Core Team 2013). Scaling, rotating and superimposition of

168

head landmarks was carried out using R packages gemorph, shapes and Momocs (Bonhomme

169

et al. 2014; Adams et al. 2017; Dryden 2017). R package vegan (Oksanen et al. 2017)

170

quantifies symmetry by overlaying the left and right sides of heads and performs Procrustes

171

distance analyses, defined as Σ((distance between corresponding landmarks)2).

172

Legs and wings

173

Front wings and T1 legs of the same 105 hybrid and 72 wild type wasps were carefully removed

174

and mounted on slides. Each wing and leg was imaged on a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V.8

175

dissecting scope using Zeiss Axiovision software v. 4.8. Each specimen was measured three

176

times and the length averaged. The difference in length between left and right sides of each

177

appendage was compared for hybrids and wild types.

RNAi
Diploid males

181

To generate diploid males, we used parental RNAi (Lynch and Desplan 2006) on a mutant

182

strain of N. vitripennis with grey eye color (N.vitOy/Oy). Female yellow pupae of N.vitOy/Oy were

183

injected with 1ug/ul of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting Nv-transformer (Nv-tra), whose

184

function is required for female development in fertilized eggs (Verhulst et al. 2010). The injected

185

N.vitOy/Oy adult females were then crossed to the wild type N. giraulti (RV2x), which have a red-

186

brown eye color. While haploid males display the grey eye phenotype, the hybrid, diploid males

187

express wild type red-brown eye color allele obtained from the N. giraulti parent. Male vs female

188

offspring are easily differentiated in the pupal state by wing size and absence/presence of an

189

ovipositor (Werren and Loehlin 2009).

Introgression

203

Introgression of Ng chromosomal regions into an Nv genetic background is routinely used to

204

investigate the genetic basis of differences in traits between the species, and some cases for

205

positional cloning of causal loci . We generated an Ng introgression into Nv of a region on

206

chromosome 2 implicated in abnormal head clefting in F2 males (Werren et al. 2016). The initial

207

chromosome 2 introgression line is designated INT_2C, and head shape effects were observed,

208

in addition to phenotypic effects on body color, survival and female fertility (data not shown).

209

Subsequent recombinants where generated by using primers flanking insertion/deletion

210

differences across the region. A smaller scale introgression designated 2C-Cli was produced

that shows an abnormal head clefting in both males and females. The recessive lethal and

212

female fertility effects were separated from the clefting region by recombination. Both

213

introgression lines were generated according to methods described in Breeuwer and Werren,

214

1995. The smaller region is estimated to be 16 centimorgan based on the map in Desjardins et

215

al. 2013. The line with an introgression on chromosome four (denoted INT_wm114) was

216

generated to study the sex-specific gene size differences in Nasonia (Loehlin et al. 2010). Adult

217

heads were stained, imaged and measured as described above.

Results

229

Wild type males have species-specific morphologies

230

The significant differences in head shape between the males of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti

231

were described in Werren et al. 2016, and a general description of N. vitripennis, N. giraulti, and

232

N. longicornis heads was provided in Darling and Werren, 1990. To understand how head

233

shape has evolved in the Nasonia genus, we examined head shape of the males and females in

234

more detail. To this end, we took seven measurements (Figure S1) on several heads (n=12-20,

235

Table S1) from both males and females of the three species we investigate here. These

236

measurements include maximal head width, head length, facial width in three places, and cheek

237

size.

238

General head shape measurements were normalized by dividing the measurement by

239

the head length to consistently control for variation in head size. Cheek size measurements are

240

expressed as ratios with another measurement of head size to normalize for natural size

241

variation across individuals and since females tend to be larger than males. Upon comparing

242

measurement ratios, we found that N. vitripennis, N. giraulti and N. longicornis females all have

243

roughly the same oval shape in their faces (Figure 1A', B', C', D', Figure 2B-D), with N. giraulti

244

females having the least round shape (Figure 2C). Males on the other hand, all look quite

245

different (Figure 1A, B, C, D). The males of N. vitripennis look nearly the same as that of the

246

females (Figure 1A-A’), but are actually wider at maximum head width (MHW) and maximum

247

interocular distance (MIO) (Figure 2A and C). The males of N. giraulti (Figure 1B) appear much

248

more square due to their consistency in the three normalized face width measurements: across

249

ocelli (OIO), across antennae (AIO), and MIO (Figure 2B-D, Table S1). Male heads of N.

250

longicornis (Figure 1C), were previously described to be similar to N. vitripennis males and

251

females (Darling and Werren 1990), but actually measure more similar to N. giraulti in terms of

252

face shape at measurements MHW, OIO and AIO (Figure 2A, B, D, Table S1). Additionally, N.

253

longicornis males are almost exactly intermediate between the other two species in cheek size

254

(FEP/FE) (Figure 1D, Figure 2E, Table S1).

255

Also interesting to note is that a few traits are partially sex specific. For example,

256

females of N. giraulti and N. longicornis do have bigger cheeks than N. vitripennis, but the

257

males traits are extreme (Figure 2E). This implies incomplete sex specificity of the shape

258

differences between species, and that some genes responsible for the extreme male differences

259

also affect female development. Similar phenotypes appear to exist at the interocular width at

260

the top and bottom of the head, OIO and AIO, where both male and female N. giraulti and N.

261

longicornis have relatively narrower faces than the N. vitripennis counterparts, but again the

262

male trait difference are more exaggerated. Overall conclusions from wild type species shape

263

analyses is that females across the three species have roughly the same shape except for

264

maximum head width, intraspecies sex-specific differences are starkest within N. giraulti, and

265

that N. longicornis displays phenotypes intermediate between the other two species, in contrast

266

to what was previously reported (Darling and Werren 1990; Werren et al. 2010).

267
268

Developmental incompatibility alleles more strongly associated with temporal, rather

269

than morphological divergence

270

Understanding the genetic basis of morphological divergences can provide insight to

271

how morphology evolves. One question that needs to be addressed is whether the genetic basis

272

of developmental defects in F2 hybrids between Nv and Ng are caused by negative interactions

273

among alleles involved in producing the divergent head shapes. One could imagine that alleles

274

important for making the exaggerated traits may contribute to tissue behavior incompatible with

275

the effects of alleles driving the formation of elongate, ovoid head of Nv. Similarly, alleles

276

required to produce the novel Ng cheeks may have unexpected interactions with alleles of the

277

cheek-less Nv. On the other hand, the F2 hybrid male head defects could occur due to

278

interactions among divergent alleles that have changed due to forces other than morphological

evolution of the head, such as random drift over the course of the 1.4-1.6 million years of

280

independent evolution since these species shared a common ancestor.

281

To differentiate between these possibilities, we examined F2 hybrid males created with

282

N. longicornis (Nl). Nl is a sister species to N. giraulti, from which it diverged ~0.4 - 0.56 million

283

years ago (mya). The divergence time between Nl and Nv is identical to that between Ng and

284

Nv (~1.4 million years). We have found that, while male Nl heads are significantly less square,

285

and have significantly smaller cheeks (Figures 1 and 2, Table S1) than Ng males, they are also

286

statistically significantly different from Nv in these measures (Figures 1 and 2, Table S1). Thus,

287

divergence time is not completely uncoupled from morphological evolution in this experiment.

288

However, the timing of the origin of the negative interactions leading to developmental defects

289

can still be inferred as could a potential influence of the exaggerated morphological differences

290

in Ng relative to Nv.

291

Eighty-eight percent of F2 males produced by N. giraulti x N. vitripennis (Ng-Nv) hybrid

292

females show head defects of some type, while 80% of F2 hybrid males resulting from N.

293

longicornis x N. vitripennis hybrids (Nl-Nv) exhibit head defects (Figure 3A). These defects took

294

many forms, with some co-occurring in the same individual. Lateral asymmetry indicates a

295

difference in relative size between the left and right sides of the head (Figure 3B, compare

296

arrows), or misplacement of ocelli (Figure 4A). Individuals with a cleft phenotype display a

297

furrow among the midline of the face (Figure 3B’ arrowhead). In wild type wasps, the point at

298

which the eye meets the epidermis at the top of the head is directly above the point where the

299

eye meets the epidermis at the bottom of the head (Figure 1D-D’). When this is not the case in

300

hybrid individuals it is referred to as dorso-ventral (DV) asymmetry (Figure 3B’, compare

301

arrows), which can occur in one or both eyes. Abnormalities that account for less than five

302

percent of the hybrid population are grouped under “miscellaneous.” These include swollen

303

head syndrome, an expansion at the top of the head (Figure 3B’’); bulging eye syndrome, where

304

the eye field is larger than average causing the facial area to be smaller than average; pitting

around the antennal sockets; and presence of a fourth ocellus. Some individuals display more

306

than one type of abnormality, which are noted under “multi” in Figure 3A. In contrast to the high

307

rate and diversity of head defects in the Nl-Nv and Ng-Nv F2 male hybrids, observable head

308

defects are seen in only ~20% of the F2 N. longicornis x N. giraulti (Nl-Ng) hybrids (Figure 3A).

309

Strikingly, the clefting phenotype was completely absent and both DV and lateral asymmetries

310

only occurred in five percent of hybrids (compared to ~25% and 20% in hybrids involving Nv,

311

respectively, Table 1). Miscellaneous defects accounted for 10% of abnormal heads in Nl-Ng F2

312

hybrid males (compared to 18-24% in Nv hybrids, Table 1) and no individuals of this cross had

313

more than one defect (compared to 10-12% of Nv hybrids, Table 1).

314

In summary, it appears that most of the alleles causing developmental defects in the

315

heads of hybrids between N. vitripennis and N. longicornis or N. giraulti arose and were fixed

316

prior to the divergence of the N. giraulti and N. longicornis lineages from each other ~ 400k-

317

500k years ago (Campbell et al. 1993; Martinson et al. 2017). This indicates that exaggeration

318

of morphological differences in N. giraulti males had little effect on the evolution of

319

developmental incompatibility between N. giraulti and N. vitripennis. The low frequency of

320

defects seen in Nl-Ng hybrids may be due to new alleles that have arisen in one or both

321

lineages, or may reflect independent sorting of polymorphisms present in the ancestral

322

population that gave rise to them.

323
324
325

Asymmetric hybrid phenotypes are specific to the head
The most common of the abnormal hybrid phenotypes is asymmetry (Figure 3A). We

326

wanted to know the extent of these asymmetries and whether they are caused by a general

327

developmental instability in the hybrids, as is often seen in some systems (Alibert and Auffray

328

2003; Leamy and Klingenberg 2005), or if the phenotype has its basis in genetic mechanisms

329

operating specifically in the head. To determine this, we developed an approach to quantify

330

asymmetry among head capsules as well as difference in length at two other body parts: legs

and wings (Figure 4E). Symmetry between left and right sides of heads was quantified using R

332

package vegan (Oksanen et al. 2017), wherein landmarks from the left are overlayed to their

333

corresponding landmarks on the right (ie, the wireframe is folded along the centerine) and a

334

Procrustes distance analyses is performed by calculating Σ((distance between corresponding

335

landmarks)2). A Procrustes distance analysis (Figure 4A-C) done on 105 Nv x Ng hybrid heads

336

found that a hybrid head has only 93% correlation on average between its left and right sides

337

(Figure 4D). On the other hand, wild type heads measured from both males and females of N.

338

vitripennis and N. giraulti revealed a 99.5% correlation between left and right sides of the head.

339

The differences in correlation are highly statistically significant (P<0.001), indicating a strong

340

effect of the hybrid genome on the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, we found no

341

significant difference in the length between the left and right T1 legs, nor between the first pair

342

of wings in the same set of F2 hybrid wasps, as compared to either parental species (Figure 4E,

343

Table S2). We therefore conclude that generalized developmental instability is not a likely

344

explanation for cranial asymmetry, since we do not observe defects or asymmetries in other

345

body parts. Rather, there appears to be phenomenon specific to the head patterning and

346

homeostasis system.

347
348

Alleles causing head defects are recessive whereas alleles governing head shape are

349

codominant

350

Due to the obligate haplodiploidy, hymenopterans such as Nasonia, males are normally

351

hemizygous and interactions among alleles can be assessed in the absence of dominance

352

effects. However, understanding the dominance relationships of alleles is helpful in

353

understanding both the function of the genes involved in generating a phenotype, and the

354

molecular nature of interactions that lead to changes or failure in development.

355
356

To study the dominance relationships between the two parental genomes while
maintaining male-specific traits, we created diploid males using the previously described

method of knocking down the maternal Nv-tra contribution by pRNAi. In the absence of maternal

358

Nv-tra, mated females will produce diploid males (Verhulst et al. 2010; Beukeboom et al. 2015),

359

Nv-tra dsRNA injected Nv females were mated to Ng males, which resulted in diploid, hybrid

360

male, offspring (Figure 5C). Since these offspring are F1 hybrids where not genetic

361

recombination or assortment has taken place, and there are no sex-based chromosomal

362

differences in these species, they receive an equal contribution genetic material from each

363

parental species (along with the lack of sex chromosomes in this system). Interestingly, we

364

found that for almost all traits, the phenotype for these diploid hybrid males was nearly exactly

365

intermediate between, and significantly different from, both of the parental species (Figure 5A-C,

366

Figure 6, Table S3). Minor deviations from this pattern were at OIO measurements which were

367

closer to those of N. vitripennis, while MHW and AIO were more similar to that of N. giraulti

368

(Figure 6, Table S3).

369

These results indicate that alleles of genes involved in regulating the size and shape of

370

the head are codominant, leading to hybrids with intermediate traits. Additionally, diploid males

371

did not display any of the anomalous phenotypes that occur in haploid hybrids, indicating that it

372

is not the mere presence of an allele from the other species that causes the incompatibility.

373

Rather, it appears that there are species specific alleles that can only function with alleles at

374

other loci that are derived from the same species, and it is the absence of the compatible alleles

375

that leads to defects in the hybrid F2 males between Nv and Ng. In other words, hybrid head

376

defects involve recessive interaction among loci from the two species.

Doublesex knockdown in N. giraulti males generate a reduced cheek phenotype
Since the divergent head morphology in N. giraulti is a specific novelty in the males (the

380

females are barely distinguishable from other Nasonia species females), we hypothesized that

381

effectors of the sex determination system may play an important role in generating the divergent

382

features of the N. giraulti male head. To test this, we examined the involvement of doublesex

383

(dsx) in craniofacial development in N. giraulti. Dsx is the main effector gene of the sex

384

determination pathway, and it is known to play specific roles in the evolution of developmental

385

traits that vary between sexes (Hediger et al. 2004; Verhulst et al. 2010; Tanaka et al. 2011; Ito

386

et al. 2013), including sex specific differences in wing size between Nv and Ng (Loehlin et al.

387

2010). We therefore hypothesized that it would play a role in generating the sex specific

388

features of the N. giraulti male head. Larval RNAi (Werren et al. 2009)was used to knock down

389

N. giraulti doublesex (Ng-dsx) in male (progeny of virgin females) late-stage larvae before the

390

main period of growth and patterning of the eye and antennal imaginal discs commenced.

391

Compared to wild type N. giraulti males, the divergent N. giraulti features of the male

392

were significantly reduced by Ng-dsx knockdown, (Figure 5D, Figure 6B-E, Table S3). MIO and

393

cheek size (FEP/FE) were significantly different from both wild-type Ng (p<0.01 and 0.05,

394

respectively) and wt Nv (both p<0.01) after Ng-dsx RNAi. OIO and AIO were strongly different

395

from wt Ng (p<0.01), but were statistically indistinguishable from Nv males, indicating that these

396

features are strongly influenced by Ng-dsx. (Figure 6, Table S3). From these results we can

397

conclude that Ng-dsx plays an important role in producing the lineages specific male traits in

398

Ng. It is possible that female form is the default, and genes that determine male sex also cause

399

the male-specific facial morphology. However, the Ng-dsx RNAi strain was still significantly

400

different from Ng females at MHW, MIO and cheek size (Table S4), indicating there was not a

401

complete transformation to the female phenotype, and we can conclude that dsx likely works

402

alongside many other genes to generate the male form.

403
404
405

Introgression of N. giraulti dsx non-coding region increases cheek size:
The role of Ng-dsx in generating the N. giraulti male specific structures was further

406

tested by taking advantage of an introgression line containing a portion of the regulatory region

407

of Ng-dsx isolated in the background of N. vitripennis (Figure 5D). This introgression was

408

originally identified as a region important for the larger size of the Ng male wing (Loehlin et al.

409

2010). This relatively small introgression (~40kb) containing only DNA in the non-coding region

410

upstream of the transcription start site of Ng-dsx has a strong effect on the shape of the male

411

head in an N. vitripennis background. For all five measures examined, the introgression line

412

showed highly statistically significant difference to normal Nv male values (p<0.01 for all values,

413

Table S3). Additionally, the introgression line was not statistically significant from normal Ng

414

males at MHW and OIO, which is consistent with our hypothesis that dsx plays a crucial role in

415

generating the N. giraulti specific male head shape features.

416

Since this introgression line also shows significant differences in shape also from N.

417

giraulti (Figure 5E, Figure 6), it is clear that other factors are involved. It is likely that multiple loci

418

contribute significantly to the head shape differences, as seen for the wing size and shape

419

network differences between these two species (Gadau et al. 2002). Indeed, complex genetic

420

bases for all of the differing male head shape and size features were predicted in our previous

421

quantitative trait locus analysis (Werren et al 2016). That being said, we cannot exclude that Ng-

422

dsx plays a larger role than that detected here. We do not know exactly how Nv-dsx expression

423

is being affected in the head, and there may be additional enhancers not included in the

424

introgressed region that are important for additional aspects of dsx expression divergence

425

between the species.

426
427

Introgression of incompatible loci lends insight to abnormal clefting phenotype

428

As shown above (and previously in Li et al. 2005; Loehlin et al. 2010; Loehlin and Werren 2012;

429

Hoedjes et al. 2014), introgression of genomic regions from one species' background into

430

another is a powerful method to analyze the genetic basis of evolutionary traits in Nasonia.

431

Previous QTL analyses for clefting showed a complex web of genetic interaction among regions

432

on chromosomes 2, 4 and 5 (Werren et al. 2016). Briefly, clefting occurs at frequency of ~25%

433

when either or both the regions on Chr 2 and Chr 4 have the N. giraulti genotype AND the

434

region on Chr 5 has the N. vitripennis genotype. If Chr 5 has the N. giraulti genotype, clefting is

435

completely suppressed, unless both the Chr2 and Chr 4 region derives from N. vitripennis.

436

Clefting also occurs at about 25% of the time when all three regions derive from N. vitripennis,

437

indicating that at least one more locus is involved, or that there is an effect of the general hybrid

438

background on the threshold for clefting.

439

To simplify analysis of this trait, we examined existing introgression lines with segments

440

of Ng DNA introgressed in a Nv background. One line, derived from a larger introgression

441

spanning the centromere of chromosome 2 consistently showed facial clefting (See Methods,

442

Figure 5F). Significantly, the females homozygous for this introgression also display the cleft

443

phenotype, unlike F1 hybrid females that never show abnormalities. This shows that the

444

interactions leading to the epistatic phenotype are recessive, since the introgression lines are

445

homozygous and are not seen in the F1 females. The result is consistent with the F2 clefting

446

QTL analysis which predicts that the Ng allele in chromosome 2 will induce clefting when

447

combined with the Nv alleles at the locus on chromosome 4 or 5 (Werren et al. 2016). This

448

result also indicates that the clefting trait is not directly related to the sex specific morphological

449

divergence between the species, and is rather a general defect in head patterning. Finally, this

450

introgression importantly shows that, at least for the locus on chromosome 2, the clefting trait is

451

fully penetrant when incompatible alleles are isolated from any suppressing alleles at other loci.

452

This will simplify identification of the causative allele from N. giraulti, and aid in the fine-scale

453

mapping and positional cloning of suppressing alleles at other loci (e.g. on chromosome 5).

Discussion

458

explore the genetic basis of shape. Taking advantage of the significant differences in cranial

459

morphologies among three closely related species and the ability to generate interspecies

460

hybrids, we are able to begin unraveling the network of gene interactions that govern trait

461

formation. Both morphology and genetic incompatibility are result of complex epistatic

462

interactions (Werren et al. 2016).

463

In these experiments, we have demonstrated the use of Nasonia genus of parasitic wasps to

Abnormally asymmetric phenotypes, as seen in the hybrid F2 males here, are known as

464

fluctuating asymmetries, typically caused by developmental instability (Dongen 2006).

465

Developmental instability can result from any number of genetic or environmental factors,

466

commonly observed when hybridizing genomes (Leamy and Klingenberg 2005). However, our

467

system differs from typically cases of fluctuating asymmetry, since we observe stable symmetry

468

among the rest of the body in hybrid males. This indicates generalized developmental instability

469

is not likely to be the cause in this case. This indicates that the head asymmetries we observe in

470

F2 males are not likely to be due to general developmental instability, but rather have a specific

471

genetic basis in the context of head development. The feasibility of dissecting gene interactions

472

governing complex head defects using introgression and recombination mapping has already

473

been shown with our work with the clefting trait, so Nasonia is well positioned to make a unique

474

contribution to understanding the genetic and developmental causes of fluctuating asymmetry.

475

Sex identity clearly plays an important role in some aspects of the head shape network, at least

476

in N. giraulti. While knockdown of the male-specific spliceoform of Ng-dsx does decrease male-

477

specific morphology, a full transformation to the female form may require the function of the

478

female specific transcript of Ng-dsx. However our results are also consistent with a complex

479

interplay between sex-specifc genes, and developmental factors shared between the sexes in

480

generating sex specific morphologies. While morphology is strongly influenced by sex, the

22
481

negative gene interactions that cause developmental defects in F2 hybrid males clearly are not,

482

since our clefting introgression line shows the phenotype in homozygous females as well as

483

haploid males.

484

QTL analysis is valuable as a starting point for fine-scale mapping of interacting loci that

485

are the genetic basis for observed disrupted phenotypes (Gadau et al. 1999). Putative causal

486

regions can be isolated in the other species' genetic background by introgression for further

487

analysis. Introgression is a very powerful method to understand quantitative traits and gene

488

interactions, whereby a section of one genome is isolated in the background of another through

489

a series of backcrosses, and its localized effects examined. Introgression lines are also powerful

490

starting points for fine scale mapping and positional cloning of causative alleles. The

491

introgression of the clefting locus on chromosome 2 is a good example of the power of the

492

introgression approach. Given the complexity of the interactions that govern the appearance of

493

the cleft in F2 hybrid males, it was somewhat surprising that the introgression of the N. giraulti

494

Chr2 locus led to a completely penetrant phenotype in both males and females, behaving

495

basically as a Mendelian recessive allele. Thus it appears that while the genetic architecture

496

preventing clefting in the pure species is complex, each individual allele may have a relatively

497

simple and robust role, rather than each locus having an unpredictable magnitude of effect on

498

the phenotype.

499

Future analyses will focus on determining whether the other participating alleles

500

predicted by the QTL analyses (Werren et al. 2016) also have strong effects in a foreign

501

background, or if there is a mixture of completely, and incompletely, penetrant negative

502

interactions. In particular, a region on Chr5 interacts with the region from Chr2. Based on the

503

QTL analysis (Werren et al. 2016), we expect an introgression of the Chr 5 region to completely

504

suppress clefting in combination with the Chr 2 introgession, since clefting occured 0% of the

505

time when these two alleles were present together in F2 males used for the QTL analysis. The

506

expected phenotype of this Chr5 region are less clear, since overall clefting occured 25% of the

507

time when regions on both Chr 2 and Chr4 had the N. vitripennis genotype. (Werren et al.

508

2016). This indicates either that there are other loci that suppress clefting induced by the N.

509

giraulti Chr5 allele, or that this allele does not promote clefting in a fully penetrant way.

510

We intend to map these additional interacting loci governing the evolution of morphology

511

by first using Multiplexed Shotgun Genotyping and QTL analysis to identify genomic segments

512

associated with the traits of interest (Andolfatto et al. 2011). We can then use marker based

513

introgression and recombination mapping to identify the causative alleles.

514

In crosses between the closely related flies Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana

515

which have divergent head shapes, seemingly coordinated changes in size of the eye field and

516

facial cuticle were found to be due to separable genomic loci (Arif et al. 2013). No complex gene

517

interactions or developmental defects (such as clefting or asymmetry) were reported. This may

518

be due to the shorter divergence time between the Drosophila species (~250,000 years (ref:

519

Genome Res. 2012. 22: 1499-1511)) than between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti (~1 million

520

years). Our results are consistent with the appearance of negative epistatic interactions

521

between isolated species being correlated with increased time since divergence, since we do

522

not observe these effects in hybrids of closely related species N. longicornis and N. giraulti.

523

Future analysis of the genetic architecture of the morphological difference between N.

524

longicornis and N. giraulti also have more simple genetic bases, like those observed between D.

525

simulans and D. mauritiana, or whether epistasis plays an important role already in more

526

recently diversified species of Nasonia.

527

In conclusion, our results have demonstrated important roles of sex, ploidy, and

528

divergence time in the evolution of novel morphologies and developmental defects in hybrids. In

529

addition, our introgression of an allele from one species that causes a severe developmental

530

defect in the genomic background of its close relative is an important step in simplifying an

531

understanding of the still daunting task of characterizing gene interactions involved in head

532

development and developmental abnormalities. The powerful genetic tools available in Nasonia
