Abstract
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) skin infections are caused by a diverse array of strain
types and are highly prevalent in Indigenous and other disadvantaged populations. The
role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood,
representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine
challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity
required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This
mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the
accumulation of immunity in populations.
We used a mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the
epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after
two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for
uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum
inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain
diversity. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance
observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed
the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context.
Our model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the
maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our
vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited
impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific
immunity requires repeated episodes of infection.
Our results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings
is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated
infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human
studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.

GAS are under development, but their effective use will require better understanding of
how immunity develops following infection. Evidence from an animal model of skin
infection suggests that the generation of enduring strain-specific immunity requires two
infections by the same strain within a short time frame. It is not clear if this mechanism
of immune development operates in humans, nor how it would contribute to the
persistence of GAS in populations and affect vaccine impact. We used a mathematical
model of GAS transmission, calibrated to data collected in an Indigenous Australian
community, to assess whether this mechanism of immune development is consistent with
epidemiological observations, and to explore its implications for the impact of a vaccine.
We found that it is plausible that repeat infections are required for the development of
immunity in humans, and illustrate the difficulties associated with achieving sustained
reductions in disease prevalence with a vaccine.

Introduction

1

The development of immunological memory following infection or vaccination against a

2

particular pathogen enables a more rapid and enhanced immune response during

3

subsequent infections. The characteristics of this immunological memory at an

4

individual host level – such as the degree or duration of immune protection against

5

subsequent pathogen encounters – impact epidemiological dynamics at the host

6

population level [1, 2].

7

Routine vaccination programs targeting pathogens comprised of a single serotype
(i.e., one immunologically-equivalent strain), such as the mumps and measles viruses,

June 13, 2019

8

9

inhibit sustained transmission because they result in the accumulation of hosts with

10

enduring immunological memory (herd immunity) effective against all pathogen

11

genotypes [3, 4]. For pathogens with multiple serotypes (i.e., multi-strain pathogens),

12

such as Neisseria meningitidis [5], poliovirus [6], Streptococcus pneumoniae [7] and

13

dengue virus [8], infection by one strain may lead to an immune response that is

14

strain-specific, providing less, if any, protection against other strains (cross-strain

15

immunity). As a result, the link between an individual’s immune response and the

16

accumulation of herd immunity at the host population-level can be more complex for

17

multi-strain pathogens, posing challenges for understanding their transmission and for

control [1, 2, 9–15].

19

An important human pathogen with very high strain diversity is group A

20

Streptococcus (GAS), which, globally, is comprised of over 230 molecular sequence

21

types [16] and over 290 distinct genotypes [17]. GAS generally causes infections of the

22

skin or throat that are mild and easily treated. However, mild GAS infection can also

23

lead to more serious invasive and immune-mediated disease with high mortality

24

rates [18]. Hence, populations with high rates of mild GAS infections tend to also suffer

25

from high rates of invasive disease and immune sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever

26

and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [18]. These GAS “hyper-endemic

27

populations” also tend to have much higher strain diversity compared to populations

28

with a low prevalence of GAS [19]. For example, dozens of strains of GAS are reported

29

to co-circulate in the Indigenous communities of tropical northern Australia, where the

30

prevalence of GAS skin infections can be as high as 45% in children, and the incidence

31

of acute rheumatic fever is among the highest reported in the world [18, 20–24].

32

Despite the high global burden of GAS disease [18], currently there is no licensed

June 13, 2019

33

GAS vaccine, although there are a number in the vaccine pipeline [25]. A critical

34

knowledge gap in GAS vaccine development is our limited understanding of how

35

strain-specific immunity might prevent GAS infection (particularly skin infection) and,

36

in turn, shape patterns of transmission across different populations. Epidemiological

37

studies indicate that GAS skin infection is much less frequent in adults than in

38

children [20, 24, 26, 27], suggesting that people may be able to acquire enduring

39

immunity to particular GAS strains following skin infection. However, if enduring

40

strain-specific immunity to GAS is possible, the high rates of repeat skin infections

41

observed in children in hyper-endemic regions [27–29] suggest that it is slow to develop.

42

Moreover, an association between the age-related immunity to GAS and the acquisition

43

of GAS specific antibodies suggest the need for repeated GAS exposures for enduring

44

immunity [30]. A recent study in mice showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific

45

and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within

46

three weeks [31]. A single infection, or two infections by the same strain that occurred

47

greater than three weeks apart did not result in the generation of memory B cells, but

48

rather only short-lived strain-specific immunity. An analogous mechanism of acquiring

49

enduring strain-specific immunity from GAS skin infection in humans may be a

significant impediment to the accumulation of herd immunity, particularly in

51

populations with high numbers of circulating strains.

52

In this work we use mathematical modelling to determine the population-level

June 13, 2019

53

consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity that is contingent on hosts

54

experiencing two repeated episodes of GAS infection by the same strain [31]. We

55

explore the effects of this immunity mechanism in the context of GAS transmission in

56

small connected communities that are typical of Australian Indigenous populations in

57

northern Australia, as well as other GAS hyper-endemic regions such Fiji and Samoa [].

58

A key element of the model is that hosts can only acquire enduring immunity protecting

59

against reinfection by a particular strain if they experience two repeated episodes of

60

infection by this strain within a specified time interval. To the best of our knowledge,

61

this is the first time a transmission model of any pathogen has accounted for this type

62

of strain-specific immunity. We use the model to assess whether epidemiological

63

observations of GAS in hyper-endemic populations are consistent with this type of

64

immune response. We also assess the impact of one of the leading multivalent strain

65

specific GAS vaccines on interrupting transmission in this context. Understanding

66

generated may be crucial for predicting and understanding future population effects of

67

GAS vaccines currently in development [25].

68

Methods

69

In this section we describe our agent-based model of GAS transmission, the selection of

70

model parameters based on available epidemiological studies, and our in silico

71

experiments.

72

Model of GAS transmission

73

Our agent-based model simulates the transmission of n(t) strains of GAS in a

74

well-mixed host population (where agents correspond to hosts) of constant size N , in

75

discrete time t. We assume the population is situated in a geographical region where

76

nmax strains of GAS are in circulation so that 0 ≤ n(t) ≤ nmax . Each strain is assumed

77

to have on average identical transmissibility, cause infections with identical baseline

78

average duration, and be equally distant to each other in ‘antigenic strain space’ [32] so

that each strain prompts a distinct immune response in hosts.

80

The model tracks the age, infection and immunity status of each host through time.

81

Changes in host infection and immunity status occur due to the clearance of infections,

82

transmission events, and waning immunity (detailed below), and are updated

83

synchronously at the end of each day. New susceptible individuals aged zero are

84

introduced into the population at a per capita rate d to replace individuals that are lost

85

due to natural death. We also model migration at a per capita rate of α (detailed

86

below).

87

Infection

88

In high incidence settings, multiple strains of GAS have been concurrently detected in

89

the same and different skin lesions of individuals [33]. Therefore, in our model, hosts

90

can be co-infected by multiple strains. We assume that a host can have a maximum of κ

91

infections at any one time (including multiple infections of the same strain), and that

92

the susceptibility of hosts to infection decreases as the total number of infections in each

93

host increases. These assumptions incorporate the effects of pathogen populations

94

directly competing for space and resources within the host, or indirectly interacting via

95

the host immune response. We calculate the relative susceptibility r of host i to an

96

uninfected host as

97


r=

gi (t)
1−
κ

x
,

(1)

where gi (t) is the total number of infections of host i at time t and x > 0 is a number

98

scaling the level of resistance to acquisition of new infections due to the competitive

99

advantage of already established infections. Clearly, if host i is uninfected then r = 1,

100

and if the host is at infection carrying capacity κ then r = 0.

101

Each day, each infecting strain will clear with probability Γ = 1 − exp(−γ/s), where

June 13, 2019

102

1/γ is the mean duration of infection of a host without prior immunity, and s is the

103

expected relative duration of infection of a host compared to a host without prior

104

immunity (detailed below). If a host has multiple infections of the same strain and this

105

strain clears during a time step, then we assume that all infections of that strain in the

106

host clear simultaneously.

Transmission

108

In the model, each host has on average c contacts with other hosts per day. The

109

contacts of infected hosts are chosen uniformly at random from the population, and the

110

outcomes of these contact events are then determined (i.e., whether or not a

111

transmission event occurs). We specify that transmission may only occur one-way from

112

the infected host to their contacts. The probability of a contact resulting in

113

transmission is B = βr, where β is the baseline probability of transmission, and r is the

114

relative susceptibility of a host to an uninfected host (detailed above). If the infected

115

host has more than one infection, only one of these co-infections can possibly transmit

116

during a single contact event. For co-infected hosts, we choose one infection uniformly

117

at random to attempt transmission. If this attempt fails, then the contact event does

118

not result in transmission. These rules correspond to the assumption that co-infected

119

hosts are not necessarily more infectious than hosts with a single infection. We also

120

specify that a host may only contract a maximum of one infection per day.

121

With these assumptions, we can calculate the basic reproduction number R0 , which
is the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infected host

123

introduced into a completely susceptible host population. A pathogen is expected to

124

cause an outbreak or become endemic in a host population if R0 > 1. In our model, R0

125

is defined as

126

cβ
R0 =
.
γ+d+α

(2)

Immunity

127

Based on observations in the mouse model of GAS skin infection discussed above [31],

128

we assume that the clearance of any host’s first infection by a particular strain confers

129

temporary immunity. This temporary immunity has a strain-specific effect of strength σ

130

(where 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1) and a cross-strain effect of strength ω1 (where 0 ≤ ω1 ≤ σ) that lasts

131

for a duration w for all hosts and strains.

132

If a host has temporary strain-specific immunity to a particular strain and is

June 13, 2019

122

133

reinfected by the same strain, clearance of this subsequent infection leads to enduring

134

strain-specific immunity that prevents reinfection by this strain and confers enduring

135

cross-strain immunity of strength ω2 that is effective against strains that a host does

not have temporary or enduring strain-specific immunity to. However, if this temporary

137

immunity wanes, then a subsequent infection by this strain will only confer temporary

138

immunity with the same characteristics as a first infection. This natural history of

139

infection is summarised in Fig 1. Henceforth, we refer to the duration w, as the

140

‘maximum inter-infection interval’ that enables the development of enduring

141

strain-specific immunity.

142

Fig 1. Model of the natural history of disease with respect to a single
strain. A: Hosts without prior immunity to a particular strain (S) become infected by
contacting infected hosts (I1 or I2 ). These infections (I1 ) clear at an average rate γ
which confers temporary immunity (R1 ). This temporary immunity reduces the
duration of a subsequent infection (I2 ) by a factor dependent on the strength of
temporary strain-specific immunity (σ) if the subsequent infection occurs within a
short-enough time window (the maximum inter-infection interval, w) from the time of
clearance (green line). If infection does not occur within this time frame (blue line),
then temporary immunity wanes and a subsequent infection has the characteristics of a
first infection. If temporary immunity does not wane before the next infection, then the
clearance of this next infection occurs faster, and confers enduring immunity protecting
against further infection (R2 ). B: An example of a host’s immune response (solid black
line) following three episodes of infection by the same strain. Here, the temporary
immunity acquired following the first infection wanes before the second infection. The
clearance of the second infection leads again to temporary immunity. However this
becomes enduring immunity following the clearance of the third, more timely, infection.
Note that the immune response is implicitly assumed to accumulate during an infection,
leading to clearance (as shown by the dotted lines).

We note that in the model, it is possible for a host without any prior strain-specific
immunity of a strain to experience multiple infections of a particular strain

144

simultaneously. Due to our assumptions about strain clearance (detailed above), all

145

infections by the same strain will clear simultaneously in the model when the host

146

recovers from this strain, leading to a single immune response. We assume that such a

147

clearance event only confers temporary immunity.

148

In the mouse model [31], the effect of the immune response was assessed by
determining the number of colony forming units in skin and blood samples (bioburden)
collected six days post inoculation. These showed a reduction in bioburden of
approximately 90% for second infections of the same serotype compared to the first
infection, provided that the second infection occurred within three weeks of the first.
However, if the second infection was a different serotype, this reduction in bioburden
ranged from approximately 0–30%. Our model does not explicitly represent bioburden
within hosts. However, a reduction in bioburden during an infection could conceivably

result in a reduced duration of infection and/or reduced infectiousness of the host. In
our model, we translate the reduction in bioburden due to host immunity into a
reduction in the duration of infection. Specifically, for each host i their expected

June 13, 2019

Clearly, if a host has no immunity then the expected duration of an infection is not

149

reduced from the baseline duration 1/γ (since s = 1 in this case). If a host has

150

temporary strain-specific immunity of a strain at the time they are infected by this

151

strain, then the expected duration of infection is reduced according to the strength of

152

temporary strain-specific immunity σ (so that s = 1 − σ). A host with enduring

153

strain-specific immunity to a strain is essentially completely protected against infection

154

by this strain (since a subsequent infection by this strain will have zero duration).

155

Without strain-specific immunity to a strain, a host may still have a shorter expected

156

duration of infection by that strain if they have either temporary or enduring immunity

157

of other strains at the time of infection (since either s = 1 − ω1 or s = 1 − ω2 in these

158

cases).

159

Migration

160

In host settings where GAS disease is hyper-endemic and where high numbers of GAS

161

strains typically co-circulate, different strains of GAS have been observed to move

162

sequentially through communities rather than persist indefinitely [21–24]. The

163

introduction of novel strains and previously circulating strains into these populations is

164

thought to be enabled by host mobility [34, 35]. Therefore, in our model, each day A

hosts (where A is a Poisson distributed random variable with mean αN ) are chosen

166

uniformly at random to be replaced by immigrants. Immigrants are assumed to have a

167

similar immune profile to individuals in the population. This is implemented by

168

specifying that an immigrant will have the same immune profile as an individual

169

selected uniformly at random from the population. Immigrants may also be infected

170

with up to one copy of infection of any strain (chosen uniformly at random from all

171

nmax strains in the region). The prevalence of infection in immigrants is set at 10% to

172

be consistent with the asymptomatic carriage rate of GAS across all age groups and

173

population settings [36].

174

Summary statistics

175

Two metrics are used to summarise transmission dynamics in our model at the

176

population-level at time t: the diversity of strains D(t), and the prevalence of infected

177

hosts P (t). We choose these summary statistics as they can be calculated from existing

178

epidemiological data of GAS transmission [24]. Strain diversity is a measure of the total

179

number of strains as well as how evenly strains are distributed across all infections in the

180

host population. We calculate strain diversity using Simpson’s reciprocal index, D(t):

181

M (t)(M (t) − 1)
D(t) = P
,
j mj (t)(mj (t) − 1)

where mj (t) is the number of infections of strain j in the host population at time t, and

182

M (t) is the total number of infections in the host population at time t. The prevalence

183

of infected hosts in a host population, P (t), is calculated as

184

P (t) =

1 X
1 + (gi (t)) × 100%,
N i Z

Z+ (the positive integers) of the

when host i has at least one infection) and zero otherwise. We define pathogen

187

extinction to be the case where the prevalence P (t) = 0.

In silico experimental approach

189

We simulate our model to (I) understand the population-level consequences of hosts

190

requiring two episodes of infection within a given time frame to obtain enduring

191

strain-specific immunity; (II) to determine whether epidemiological observations of GAS

192

in an Australian Indigenous population are consistent with this type of immune

193

response; and (III) to investigate how a targeted multivalent vaccine could potentially

194

alter the prevalence of GAS in the Australian Indigenous context.

195

Since GAS is endemic in human populations, we only consider endemic transmission
dynamics in our model. All simulations are run for at least 50 years to allow the

197

epidemiological dynamics to reach a quasi-steady state where the level of immunity in

198

the population reaches a stable level. We measure population immunity by the mean

199

number of strains hosts in the population currently have immunity to, Yb (t), and we

200

define the quasi-steady state (where Yb (t) is stable) as the endemic equilibrium. We also

201

define P ∗ and D∗ to be the endemic values of the summary statistics P (t) and D(t).

202

These are calculated by taking the mean values of P (t) and D(t) across the previous 5

203

years (that is, for t ∈ [45, 50] years).

204

Selection of model parameters

205

Table 1 shows the parameters in our model and the values we considered in our

206

simulations. Parameters were selected to reflect GAS transmission an Indigenous

207

population of northern Australia, where GAS disease is hyper-endemic and the majority

208

of GAS infections are skin infections [24].

209

The population size N and the number of strains circulating in the region nmax are

210

set at 2500 and 40 respectively to be consistent with community sizes [24] and the

211

number of strains circulating [19] among Indigenous populations of northern Australia.

212

The mean duration of infection 1/γ is set at 14 days to be consistent with clinic data

213

collected in this setting [22–24].

214

The number of daily contacts c is calculated using household contact data collected

June 13, 2019

196

215

in remote Australian Indigenous communities [38]. In this setting, it is estimated that

216

individuals make approximately 22 contacts per day on average in households. Due to a

217

lack of data describing contact patterns outside of households in these populations, we

make the assumption that an individual will have roughly half the number of contacts

219

outside of households compared to within households (approximately 11 contacts per

220

day), as has been assumed previously for a model of influenza transmission in this

221

setting [38]. Therefore, we set the mean number of daily contacts c to be 33.

222

Migration patterns are not described in this settings. We set the per capita expected
migration rate α to 0.002 per week which corresponds to an average of 5 migration

224

events per week when the population size N = 2500. With the prevalence of infection in

225

migrants set to 10%, infected migrants enter the population approximately once every

226

two weeks, which is consistent with genomic analysis of GAS isolates collected across

227

two Indigenous communities in Northern Australia [39].

228

Values for parameters relating to the effects of immunity are determined from the

229

mouse model of GAS skin infection [31]. We set the strength of temporary strain-specific

230

immunity σ to 0.9 and the strength of temporary and enduring cross-strain immunity to

231

0.1. These values are based on the respective observations of 90% and 0-30% reduction

232

in bioburden in the mouse due to strain-specific and cross-strain immunity [31].

233

To date, R0 has not been calculated for GAS. We explore values of R0 ranging from

1–10 (detailed below). For each combination of the parameters {R0 , 1/γ, c} considered,

235

the baseline transmission probability β is calculated using Equation (2).

I. What are the population-level consequences of enduring strain-specific

237

immunity being contingent on repeat infections?

238

The maximum inter-infection interval w was estimated to be three weeks in the mouse

239

model [31]. It is not clear how this timespan translates in humans. Based on

240

comparisons in mice versus humans of lifespan, the time of weaning, and the age of

241

adulthood onset, the equivalent 3-week timespan in humans could be estimated as

242

either 104 weeks, 19 weeks or 420 weeks, respectively [40]. Therefore, to understand the

243

population-level consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity being contingent on

244

repeated episodes of infection of the same strain, we consider all three of these estimates

245

for the maximum inter-infection interval w in humans, as well the case where w remains

246

unchanged between the mouse and human, that is, with w = {3, 19, 104, 420} weeks.

247

We explore values of R0 in increments of 0.5 ranging from 1–10. This range includes
values of R0 that are consistent with estimates for other pathogenic bacteria that

249

occupy similar niches to GAS: S. pneumoniae [41, 42] and Staphylococcus aureus [43]

250

(R0 = 2–3). It also allows for the possibility that GAS may have a higher than expected

251

R0 in Indigenous populations of northern Australia, where factors such as household

252

crowding [38] and poor access to clean water [44] may increase transmissibility.

253

For each value of w and for each value of R0 considered, we perform 80 simulations

June 13, 2019

248

254

of our model. From each set of simulations, we obtain a distribution of values for the

255

endemic prevalence P ∗ and endemic strain diversity D∗ , from which we calculate their

256

mean values, and 2.5%–97.5% quantiles.

257

II. Are our model outputs consistent with epidemiological data?

258

Next, we determine whether data simulated from our model with any of the estimates of

259

w and R0 considered is consistent with epidemiological data collected in a

260

hyper-endemic population. We compare the simulated distributions of P ∗ and D∗ to

261

real data collected in one Indigenous community in the Northern Territory (NT) of

262

Australia [24]. In this study, prospective surveillance of a population of approximately

263

2500 people was carried out monthly over a 23 month period. Swabs were taken from

264

the throats of all participants and any skin sores of participants and GAS isolates

265

underwent strain typing (according to emm sequence). From this data we calculate the

prevalence and strain diversity at each time point.

267

III. What is the potential impact of a multivalent vaccine?

268

A number of GAS vaccines are in the vaccine pipeline, including multivalent vaccines

269

targeted towards serotypes associated with pharyngitis and invasive disease in Northern

270

America and Western Europe [45]. While these targeted multivalent vaccines are

271

predicted to provide high strain coverage in their target populations, the coverage in

272

other populations where disease burden is much greater is predicted to be much

273

lower [17, 19]. For example, at the time of design, a leading multivalent GAS vaccine

274

was estimated to target only 25% of the serotypes of GAS circulating in Indigenous

275

populations of Australia, and 85-90% of serotypes in Northern America (ignoring any

276

potential cross reactivity between serotypes) [19].

277

To investigate how a targeted 30-valent vaccine could potentially alter the prevalence
of GAS in the Indigenous Australian context, we simulate the effects of a vaccination

279

program consisting of routine vaccination and a one-off catch up campaign. The routine

280

vaccination program vaccinates children when they reach one-year of age. At the

281

commencement of the intervention, a one-off catch-up campaign vaccinates primary

282

school-aged children in the population (aged 5–11 years). As there are no currently

283

licensed GAS vaccines, no real-world studies to measure vaccine effectiveness exist.

284

Therefore, we assume a best-case scenario where vaccinated hosts obtain life-long

285

immunity from one dose of the vaccine that protects against all strains in the vaccine,

286

and a vaccine effectiveness of 90% (which takes into account both imperfect vaccine

287

protectiveness and imperfect program coverage).

288

A region-wide vaccination program will likely alter the overall prevalence of vaccine

289

versus non-vaccine strains in the region. Therefore, strains infecting immigrants are no

290

longer chosen uniformly at random from all nmax strains in the region. Instead, we

291

define the probability pv (t) to be the probability that a strain infecting an immigrant

292

will be a vaccine strain at time t. This is calculated as

293

pv (t) = (nv (t) + 1)/(nv (t) + nnv (t) + 2),

(6)

where nv (t) and nnv (t) are, respectively, the number of vaccine strains and non-vaccine

strains present in the population at time t. This expression for pv (t) is chosen so that

295

(1) there is a small chance that an infected migrant will be carrying a vaccine strain

296

when there are no vaccine strains currently present in the population (since pv (t) > 0);

297

and (2) there is a small chance that an infected migrant will be carrying a non-vaccine

298

strain when there are no non-vaccine strains currently present in the population (since

299

pv (t) < 1). Since we are unsure how the vaccine will affect the overall prevalence of

300

infection, we make the conservative assumption that the prevalence of infection in

301

immigrants remains unchanged at 10%. For every infected immigrant, if it is

302

determined (via the probability pv ) that their infecting strain is a vaccine strain, then

303

this strain is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all vaccine strains. Conversely,

304

if it is determined that their infecting strain is a non-vaccine strain, then this strain is

305

chosen uniformly at random from the set of all non-vaccine strains. The vaccination

306

status of any immigrants coming into the population are determined in the same way as

307

their immune profiles – by specifying that the immune profile and vaccination status be

308

the same as that of individuals in the population sampled uniformly at random.

309

We assess a range of vaccine scenarios that vary by the extent to which the 30-valent
vaccine is tailored to the Australian Indigenous population context. We consider

311

scenarios where the vaccine protects against infection by 25% of GAS strains circulating

312

in the region (10 strains), an intermediate case where there is 50% strain coverage (20

313

strains), and a best-case scenario where all 30 strains targeted by the vaccine are strains

314

that are currently circulating in the region (corresponding to 75% strain coverage). For

315

each of these scenarios, we also explore the effect of further tailoring the vaccine to the

316

population by choosing the vaccine strains to be the most-prevalent strains at the

317

commencement of the intervention, as opposed to a random selection of strains (which

318

might arise if the vaccine were tailored to another population setting).

319

We compare the base-line (pre-vaccine) endemic epidemiological dynamics with

June 13, 2019

310

320

those calculated post-vaccine (after a further 100 years to allow the epidemiological

321

dynamics to re-equilibrate). We also consider the short-term impact of the vaccine

322

during the first two years of implementation. The intervention scenarios considered are

323

further broken down into those where routine vaccination is, or is not, supplemented by

324

the one-off catch-up campaign targeting primary school aged children.

Results

326

I. The total prevalence of infection and strain diversity are

327

maintained by the successive reintroduction of strains

328

In our model, endemic transmission is characterised by continuous strain turnover

329

rather than the persistence of individual strains over long periods of time, which is

330

consistent with GAS epidemiological observations within endemic settings [21–24].

331

When individual strains appear in the population, they either fade out quickly or cause

332

an outbreak that can last for a period of months before going locally extinct and then

333

reappearing some time later due to a re-importation. Outbreaks of individual strains

334

can also partially overlap, but this overlap is reduced for larger outbreaks (see panels

335

A–B in Fig 2).

per capita per week, nmax = 40, n(0) = 35, N = 2500, w = 19 weeks, x = 10, σ = 0.9,
and ω1 = ω2 = 0.1.
Despite the unstable nature of individual strains, a positive overall prevalence of

June 13, 2019

337

infection P (t) and diversity of strains D(t) can be maintained in the population over

338

long periods of time (see panels C–D in Fig 2) if the maximum inter-infection interval w

339

and the basic reproduction number R0 are appropriately specified (this is expanded

340

upon below). In such cases, P (t) and D(t) oscillate around stable positive values at

341

endemic equilibrium as individual strains sporadically appear, cause an outbreak, and

342

then fade out. The mean number of strains that hosts are immune to, Yb (t), does not

343

undergo oscillations at endemic equilibrium. Instead, it is maintained at close to a

344

constant level (see panel E in Fig 2).

345

For a fixed value of the inter-infection interval w, increasing R0 above unity initially

346

causes both an increase in the endemic prevalence P ∗ and strain diversity D∗ until their

347

maxima are achieved somewhere between 2 < R0 < 6 for all values of w considered

(Fig 3). Further increases to R0 result in a slow decrease for both of these quantities.

349

Therefore, a non-monotonic relationship exists between the basic reproduction number

350

R0 and both the endemic prevalence P ∗ and strain diversity D∗ . For a fixed value of

351

R0 , increasing w from the value estimated in the mouse model of infection (3 weeks), to

352

the smallest estimate of the equivalent timespan in humans (19 weeks) has a substantial

353

effect on reducing both the endemic prevalence P ∗ and strain diversity D∗ for all values

354

of R0 > 1 considered (Fig 3). Further increases to w (beyond 19 weeks to 104 and 420

355

weeks) correspond to increasingly smaller reductions in the endemic prevalence P ∗ and

356

strain diversity D∗ for all values of R0 > 1 considered.

and when it is equal to three estimates of the equivalent timespan in humans (19, 104
and 420 weeks) as a function of the basic reproduction number R0 (horizontal axis).
Here, R0 ∈ [1, 10], 1/γ = 2 weeks, α = 0.002 per capita per week, c = 33, nmax = 40,
n(0) = 30, N = 2500, x = 10, σ = 0.9, and ω1 = ω2 = 0.1.

II. Model outputs are consistent with epidemiological data

358

collected in a hyper-endemic population

359

When we compare the distributions of the endemic prevalence P ∗ obtained from our

360

simulated data and real data collected in a hyper-endemic setting we find there is only a

361

substantial overlap of the interquartile ranges when the values of the inter-infection

362

interval w is set to w = 19 weeks, and when the basic reproduction number R0 is set

363

between 2 ≤ R0 ≤ 5 (Fig. 4A). The corresponding simulated distributions of endemic

364

strain diversity D∗ have substantial overlap with that of the real data for all values of w

365

considered and when 2 ≤ R0 ≤ 5. Therefore, we conclude that epidemiological data

366

collected in a hyper-endemic population is most consistent with our simulated data

367

generated with w = 19 and 2 ≤ R0 ≤ 5.

by the results shown in Fig. 3, and so these results are not shown

III. Impact of a targeted multivalent vaccine is dampened by

369

strain replacement

370

When we consider the impact of a targeted multivalent (serotype-specific) vaccine on

371

transmission, we find that the effects of the vaccine program in the short term (over the

372

first 2 years post introduction) and in the long term (once the system reaches a new

373

endemic equilibrium) depend on the number of distinct strains in circulation that the

374

vaccine protects against (Fig 5). Only short-term vaccine impact is dependent on the

375

prevalence of each vaccine strain at the commencement of the intervention, and the

376

choice of whether or not to implement the one-off catch-up campaign.

377

replacement (A–F) The mean (lines) and interquartile range (shaded regions) from 80
simulations of the model showing the prevalence over time, before and after the
initiation of a vaccine intervention with (A,D) 25% strain coverage; (B,E) 50% strain
coverage; and (C,F) 75% strain coverage. (A–C) Strains targeted by the vaccine are the
most-prevalent strains at the initiation of the intervention. Scenarios with routine
vaccination only (green), are compared against those where routine vaccination is

endemic equilibrium pre vaccination (red boxplot) compared against those calculated

coverage in the vaccine, when those strains targeted by the vaccine are the
most-prevalent strains at the initiation of the intervention, and when there is a one-off
catch up campaign as well as routine vaccination. Here, R0 = 3, w = 19 weeks, 1/γ = 2
weeks, c = 33, α = 0.002 per capita per week, nmax = 40, n(0) = 30, N = 2500, x = 10,
σ = 0.9, and ω1 = ω2 = 0.1.
Specifically, in vaccine scenarios with the one-off catch-up campaign, prevalence P (t)
is quickly reduced following commencement of the vaccine program compared to

equivalent scenarios without the catch-up campaign (see panels A–C in Fig. 5). This

380

reduction in prevalence is greater when the vaccine is targeted towards the

381

most-prevalent strains in the population at the time of the intervention, particularly for

382

strain coverage less than 50% (see panels D–F in Fig. 5). However, prevalence rebounds

383

in the months following the catch-up campaign to levels that are seen in equivalent

384

scenarios without the catch-up campaign. On average, this occurs within a year when

385

the strain coverage in the vaccine is 50% or less. When the coverage is 75%, this process

386

takes, on average, twice as long.

387

In the long term, we find that the vaccine reduces the endemic prevalence P ∗ by an

June 13, 2019

388

amount that is less than the percentage of circulating strains targeted by the vaccine.

389

Specifically, with 25%, 50% and 75% strain coverage in the vaccine, the median endemic

390

prevalence P ∗ is reduced by 20%, 38% and 65% respectively. The failure to fully sustain

391

initial reductions in prevalence following vaccine introduction is due to the partial

392

replacement of vaccine strains with non-vaccine strains, as evidenced by the

393

corresponding small reductions in median endemic strain diversity D∗ of 18%, 20% and

394

40%, respectively.

395

Discussion

396

Incomplete understanding of the the immune response to GAS infection in individuals

397

and the development of herd immunity in host populations represents a key barrier to

398

the development of a globally effective GAS vaccine. Current consensus is that the

399

immune response to GAS infection is largely strain (serotype)-specific [25]. Recent

400

evidence in a murine model of GAS skin infection raises the possibility that the longevity

401

of this immune response may be contingent on individuals experiencing a repeat episode

402

of infection by the same strain within a narrow time window [31]. As yet, there is no

403

direct evidence for an analogous immune response to GAS infection in humans.

404

Indirect evidence for immunity being contingent on repeat

405

infections

406

The results of our mathematical modelling study indicate that epidemiological

407

observations of GAS infections in a population with high rates of GAS disease are

consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being contingent on repeated infection

409

with the same strain. Both epidemiological observations [21–24] and the data simulated

410

from our model with a sufficiently long maximum inter-infection interval w are reflective

411

of there being a continuous turnover of GAS strains in the population rather than

412

individual strains persisting over long periods of time (see Fig 2). In our model, this

413

strain cycling is enabled by (1) infected hosts migrating into the population and

414

triggering outbreaks of new or previously-circulating strains; (2) the accumulation of

415

hosts with enduring immunity which causes these strains to go locally extinct; and (3)

416

the loss of sufficient herd immunity due to the continual influx of susceptible hosts into

417

the population (through birth and migration) which eventually allows a future

418

reimportation to trigger another outbreak. We found that our model best matches real

419

epidemiological data when the maximum inter-infection interval w is 19 weeks, and if

420

the basic reproduction number R0 is between 2 and 5.

421

An alternative hypothesis of the immune response to GAS skin infection is that

June 13, 2019

422

enduring strain-specific immunity can be acquired through the clearance of a single

423

infection. Mathematical models of other multi-strain pathogens that incorporate this

424

type of immune response can also exhibit high strain turnover in host populations and

425

result in a non-monotonic relationship between R0 and the endemic prevalence [1, 46],

426

similar to what is observed in our model. However, this hypothesis precludes individuals

427

experiencing repeated infections by the same GAS strain, which has been observed in

428

children in high-incidence settings [22]. Another alternative hypothesis is that skin

429

infection can never lead to enduring strain-specific immunity, but only temporary

430

strain-specific immunity, thus allowing repeat infection by the same strain once

431

immunity has waned. Future modelling work could consider whether there are

432

conditions under which such a model is also consistent with GAS epidemiological data

433

collected in high-incidence settings.

Epidemiological consequences of immunity being contingent on

435

repeat infections

Our study demonstrates the broader epidemiological consequences of enduring

437

strain-specific immunity being contingent on repeated episodes of infection. Pathogen

increase in P ∗ continues until transmission reaches a critical level whereupon it becomes

444

more feasible for hosts to encounter the same strain twice within the required time

445

window w and acquire enduring immunity. In this regime, further increases to R0

446

correspond to increased levels of herd immunity that eventually lead to reductions in

447

the endemic prevalence P ∗ for further increases to R0 . However, these further increases

448

to R0 correspond to increasingly smaller reductions in the endemic prevalence P ∗ ,

449

possibly because the reduction in duration of outbreaks of individual strains (which

450

coincide with increases to transmissibility) make it more difficult for hosts to experience

451

multiple episodes of infection of the same strain during a single outbreak.

452

A possible consequence of a non-monotonic relationship existing between R0 and the

June 13, 2019

453

endemic prevalence is that interventions designed to reduce R0 (e.g., via social

454

interventions to improve household crowding or access to healthcare or running water)

455

may lead to different outcomes in populations characterised with different baseline R0 .

456

For example, an intervention that leads to a substantial reduction in prevalence in one

457

population may lead to very little change or even an increase in prevalence in a different

458

population that has a higher baseline R0 .

459

Short and long-term benefits of tailoring a multivalent vaccines

460

to target populations

461

Our study also demonstrated how our model can be used to interpret and predict the

462

effects of a targeted multivalent-vaccine intervention in a high-incidence setting. A key

463

determinant of long-term vaccine impact is the number of strains that the vaccine

464

protects against that are circulating in the greater geographic region of the population.

465

The greatest long-term reductions in prevalence occur when all strains in the vaccine are

466

those in circulation, indicating the importance of customising a multivalent vaccine to

467

particular host settings, or incorporating more conserved antigens with multivalent

formulations [17].

469

Nevertheless, the high strain turnover that characterises transmission is likely to

470

limit the long-term effectiveness of a targeted multivalent vaccine that does not protect

471

against every strain in circulation. In our model, the replacement of vaccine strains

472

with non-vaccine strains occurred within a few years of the implementation of the

473

vaccine intervention. This occurred even when there was 75% vaccine strain coverage,

474

and following significant short-term reductions in prevalence. While it may be the case

475

that initial reductions in prevalence following the introduction of the vaccine cannot be

476

sustained, it may be possible for long-term benefits to arise if the vaccine is rolled out in

477

combination with other interventions designed to reduce transmission. It will be crucial

478

to conduct surveillance for a number of years following vaccine introduction to evaluate

479

short- and long-term vaccine impact.

480

Limitations and future work

481

In our model of GAS transmission in an Indigenous population of northern Australia,

482

we assume that all GAS infections lead to the same type of immune response – that

483

which was was observed in the mouse model of GAS skin infection [31] – since the

484

majority of mild GAS infections in this setting are skin infections [23, 24]. However, in

485

lower incidence settings, current consensus is that GAS causes throat infections more

486

frequently than skin infections [18]. Furthermore, GAS can also be carried in the nose

487

and throat of hosts without symptoms, and, less frequently, cause invasive disease [18].

488

It is not clear whether these other types of GAS infections cause an analogous immune

489

response. If so, future modelling work could consider transmission and the effect of

490

interventions in populations where other or multiple types of immune responses to GAS

491

infection occur.

492

We have assumed that all GAS strains in the model have identical epidemiological

June 13, 2019

493

characteristics. Further empirical work is needed to determine the validity of this

494

assumption. Given that all strains share the same ecological niche, any differences in

495

the competitive ability of strains will likely alter the level of strain diversity that can be

496

sustained over short and long timescales in populations [47]. Furthermore, perturbations

497

to pathogen population structure through the implementation of a vaccine targeting a

subset of strains is likely to also depend on the epidemiological characteristics of

499

targeted strains relative to non-targeted strains [47].

500

There are parallels between our simulation results and observed responses to the

501

multivalent vaccines targeting another highly diverse human pathogen, S. pneumoniae.

502

S. pneumoniae has over 90 different serotypes, and the multivalent pneumococcal

503

conjugate vaccines (PCVs) targeted the most prevalent S. pneumoniae serotypes

504

responsible for severe disease in different populations. The response to the PCVs varied

505

across subgroups within these populations [48, 49]. However, generally there was a

506

decrease in detection of vaccine strains and an increase in detection of non-vaccine

507

strains following the implementation of PCV programs [50]. This is speculated to be

508

due, in part, to strain replacement [50], similar to what occurred in our simulations.

509

However, evolutionary factors such as serotype switching [51] and selection dynamics

510

associated with the accessory genome, which remained relatively unchanged pre and

511

post the implementation of the PCVs [52], may also have played a role in the observed

512

vaccine response. Future work could consider exploring similar factors in the context of

513

a GAS vaccine by incorporating evolutionary dynamics, such as mutation and

514

recombination, into our model.
