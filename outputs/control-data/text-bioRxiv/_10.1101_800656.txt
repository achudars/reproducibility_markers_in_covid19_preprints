Abstract

13

The Steinernema carpocapsae-Xenorhabdus nematophila association is a nematobacterial complex (NBC)

14

used in biological control of insect crop pests. The ability of this dual pathogen to infest and kill an insect

15

strongly depends on the dialogue between the host’s immune system and each partner of the complex. Even

16

though this dialogue has been extensively studied from the two partners’ points of view in several insect

17

models, still little is known about the structure and the molecular aspects of the insects' immune response

18

to the dual infection. Here, we used the lepidopteran pest Spodoptera frugiperda as a model to analyze the

19

respective impact of each NBC partner in the spatiotemporal immune responses that are induced after

20

infestation. To this aim, we first analyzed the expression variations of the insect’s immune genes in the fat

21

bodies and hemocytes of infested larvae by using previously obtained RNAseq data. We then selected

22

representative immune genes for RT-qPCR investigations of the temporal variations of their expressions

23

after infestation and of their induction levels after independent injections of each partner. We found that

24

the fat body and the hemocytes both produce potent and stable immune responses to the infestation by the

25

NBC, which correspond to combinations of bacterium- and nematode-induced ones. Consistent with the

26

nature of each pathogen, we showed that X. nematophila mainly induces genes classically involved in

27

antibacterial responses, whereas S. carpocapsae is responsible for the induction of lectins and of genes

28

expected to be involved in melanization and cellular encapsulation. In addition, we found that two clusters

29

of unknown genes dramatically induced by the NBC also present partner-specific induction profiles, which

30

paves the way for their functional characterization. Finally, we discuss putative relationships between the

31

variations of the expression of some immune genes and the NBC’s immunosuppressive strategies.

Author summary

34

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are living in the soil and prey upon insect larvae. They enter the

35

insect by the natural orifices, and reach the hemocoel through the intestinal epithelium. There, they release

36

their symbiotic bacteria that will develop within the insect and eventually kill it. Nematodes can then feed

37

and reproduce on the insect cadaver. By using transcriptomic approaches, we previously showed that

38

Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda) produce a strong immune

39

response in reaction to infestation by EPNs. However, we do not know if this immune reaction is triggered

40

by the nematode itself -Steinernema carpacapsae - or its symbiotic bacteria - Xenorhabdus nematophila.

41

To answer this question, we present in this work a careful annotation of immunity genes in S. frugiperda

42

and surveyed their activation by quantitative PCR in reaction to an injection of the bacteria alone, the axenic

43

nematode or the associated complex. We found that the immune genes are selectively activated by either

44

the bacteria or the nematode and we discuss the implication of which pathway are involved in the defense

45

against various pathogens. We also show that a cluster of newly discovered genes, present only in

46

Lepidoptera, is activated by the nematode only and could represent nematicide genes.

Introduction

48

The Steinernema-Xenorhabdus nematobacterial complexes (NBCs) are natural symbiotic associations

49

between nematodes and enterobacteria that are pathogenic for insects. The soil-living nematodes infest

50

insects through the respiratory and/or the intestinal tract (1) and reach the hemocoel, the internal body

51

cavity, where they release their intestinal symbionts. The bacteria then grow extracellularly in the

52

hemolymph, the insect equivalent of blood, and improve the nematodes’ pathogenicity as well as their

53

ability to reproduce in the host dead body (2). Until now, about 90 species of Steinernema have been

54

identified, among which several are usable as biological control agents against diverse insect crop pests (3,

55

4). In consequence, their interactions with insects have been extensively studied for about 50 years (5).

56

These studies have shown that in addition to ecological and morphological parameters (3), the NBCs’

57

interactions with the host’s immune system is one of the most crucial factors influencing their ability to

58

infest and kill a given insect (6-8).

59

Insects possess an elaborate immune system, which is able to respond by adapted ways to diverse types of

60

pathogens and of infections. This system firstly relies on protective external barriers such as the cuticle, or

61

the peritrophic matrix in the midgut (9, 10). It then relies on local defenses of the surface epitheliums,

62

which repair efficiently (11-13) and produce toxic factors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (14-17)

63

and reactive oxygen species (18). The third line of defense of insects is provided by the hemocytes, which

64

are the circulating immune cells. They can produce diverse types of immune responses, including AMP

65

synthesis, phagocytosis, nodulation, encapsulation, coagulation and melanization (19). Nodulation and

66

encapsulation are cellular immune responses respectively consisting in the engulfment of bacterial

67

aggregates and of large invaders via hemocytes aggregation (19). Together with coagulation, these

68

responses are coupled with a melanization process consisting in series of phenolic compounds oxidations

69

resulting in synthesis of reactive molecules and melanin that participate of pathogens trapping and killing

70

(20, 21). Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces potent systemic

71

humoral immune responses involving a massive secretion of AMP cocktails in the hemolymph. These

72

responses can be induced by two major signaling pathways of insect immunity; the Imd pathway, which is

73

mainly activated by Gram negative bacteria, and/or the Toll pathway, which is mainly activated by Gram

74

positive bacteria, fungal organisms and by proteases released by pathogens (22, 23).

75

The Steinernema-Xenorhabdus NBC whose interactions with the immune system have been the most

76

extensively studied is the S. carpocapsae-X. nematophila association. These interactions have firstly been

77

studied from the NBC point of view, which allowed the identification of a multitude of immunoevasive

78

and immunosuppressive strategies. For instance, studies in Rhynchophorus ferrugineus and Galleria

79

mellonella have respectively shown that the cuticle of S. carpocapsae is not recognized by the host's

80

immune system (24, 25) and that the nematode secretes protease inhibitors impairing the coagulation

81

responses (26, 27). Studies in diverse insect models have also shown that both partners produce factors

82

impairing melanization (28-31), hemocyte's viability (32-36) and the production of cellular immune

83

responses by several ways (27-29, 31, 37, 38). Finally, both X. nematophila and S. carpocapsae secrete

84

proteolytic factors degrading cecropin AMPs (39, 40) and the bacterium has also been shown to reduce

85

more globally the hemolymph antimicrobial activity, as well as AMP transcription in lepidopteran models

86

(24, 39, 41, 42).

87

On the other hand, the description of these interactions from the hosts’ points of view is at its beginning.

88

This aspect has mainly been studied in the Drosophila melanogaster model, with a first transcriptomic

89

analysis of the whole larva responses to infestations by entire NBCs and by axenic nematodes (43). This

90

analysis has shown that several immune processes are induced by both pathogens at the transcriptional

91

level. For instance, the authors found in each case an overexpression of genes related to the Imd and Toll

92

pathways that was accompanied by the induction of a few AMP genes. They also found an upregulation of

93

genes related to melanization, coagulation, or involved in the regulation of cellular immune responses (43).

94

Complementary gene knockout experiments in this model demonstrated an involvement of the Imd

95

pathway in the response against X. nematophila (44) and revealed a possible involvement of the Imaginal

96

Disc Growth Factor-2, the intestinal serine protease Jonah 66Ci (45) as well as TGF-β and JNK pathways

97

members in the regulation of anti-nematode immunity (46, 47).

98

In order to improve our understanding of the dialogue that takes place between this NBC and its host, we

99

recently published a topologic transcriptomic analysis of the response of the lepidopteran model

100

Spodoptera frugiperda to the infestation (48). This analysis was focused on the three main

101

immunocompetent tissues that are confronted to the NBC, which are the midgut (the main entry site in the

102

hemocoel), the hemocytes and the fat body. The RNAseq experiment showed that there was no potent or

103

well-defined transcriptional response in the midgut. However, we observed dramatic transcriptional

104

responses in the fat body and the hemocytes at 15 h post-infestation, which is a middle time point of the

105

infection. In agreement with the results obtained in D. melanogaster whole larvae (43), global analysis of

106

these responses showed they are dominated by immune processes. The objective of the present study is to

107

go further in the analysis of these induced immune responses. In order to describe them with high accuracy,

108

we first examine the expression variations of all the immune genes that have been identified in the insect’s

109

genome. We then use tissue RT-qPCR experiments to analyze the temporal dynamics and the relative

110

contribution of each NBC partner in the identified immune responses. Our results show that a large number

111

of immune genes are responsive in either one or the two tissues during the infestation, with activation of

112

antimicrobial and cellular immunities, of melanization, coagulation and of metalloprotease inhibition.

113

These responses were found to be stable over the time post-infestation and to consist in combinations of X.

114

nematophila-induced and S. carpocapsae-induced responses in each tissue. The X. nematophila-induced

115

responses mainly correspond to genes that are classically involved in antibacterial immunity, whereas the

116

S. carpocapsae-induced ones mainly include lectins and genes potentially involved in melanization and

117

encapsulation. In addition, our RT-qPCR experiments show that two previously identified candidate

118

clusters of uncharacterized genes (48) also present partner-specific induction profiles. Our hypothesis is

119

that they may correspond to new types of anti-nematode and antibacterial immune factors found in

120

Spodoptera genus and lepidopteran species, respectively.

121

Results & Discussion

122

Hemocytes’ and fat body’s immune responses

123

In order to get an accurate picture of the S. frugiperda transcriptional immune responses to the NBC

124

infestation, we first used a previously published list of immune genes identified by sequence homology in

125

the S. frugiperda genome (49). We then looked at their expression variations in the fat body and in the

126

hemocytes (S1A Table) and we completed the repertoire with additional putative immune genes that we

127

directly identified from our RNAseq data (S1B Table). In total, we present the annotation of 226 immune

128

or putative immune genes of which 132 were significantly modulated at 15 h post-infestation (hpi) (Sleuth,

129

p-value < 0.01; |Beta| > 1; all count values > 5 in at least one condition) in one or both tissues (Fig 1).

130

Among them, 62 were involved in antimicrobial responses (Fig 1A), 18 were related to melanization (Fig

131

1B), 23 were involved in cellular responses (Fig 1C) and the 29 remaining genes were grouped in a category

132

called “diverse” due to pleiotropic or poorly characterized functions (Fig 1D).

133

Antimicrobial responses. In the antimicrobial response category, 58 genes were found to be

134

upregulated in at least one of the two tissues (Fig 1A). The signaling genes encoded 3 and 8 members of

135

the Imd and Toll pathways, respectively, as well as 5 short catalytic peptidoglycan recognition proteins

136

(PGRP-S), which are probably involved in the regulation of these pathways by peptidoglycan degradation

137

(50, 51) (Fig 1A). Four other genes were considered as involved in recognition. They encoded Gram

138

negative binding proteins (GNBPs), which have been reported to recognize peptidoglycans or β-glucans

139

and participate in the further activation of the Toll pathway (22) (Fig 1A). Finally, the effector genes

140

encoded 33 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) belonging to all the S. frugiperda’s AMP families (49) plus 4

141

lysozymes and lysozyme-like proteins (LLPs) (Fig 1A). Depending on their families and on the insect

142

species, AMPs can present varied activity spectra, ranging from antiviral or antibacterial activities to anti-

143

fungal and anti-parasitic ones (52). Varied activity spectra have also been found for several insects’

144

lysozymes and LLPs (53-57). Interestingly, all of the categories and subcategories cited above were

145

represented in the two tissues, indicating that their antimicrobial responses are diversified and that the

146

factors responsible for their disappearance in the hemolymph (24, 41) probably act at a post-transcriptional

147

level. About a half of the genes presented similar and significant induction profiles in the hemocytes and

148

in the fat body. This is for instance the case of the usually anti-Gram negative bacteria attacin, cecropin and

149

gloverin AMPs (52), which were all highly induced in the two tissues (Fig 1A), suggesting they both

150

respond to the bacterial partner X. nematophila. On the other hand, all the induced GNBP, lysozyme and

151

LLP genes were found to be either significantly induced in the hemocytes or in the fat body, and in the

152

AMP category, tissue-specificities were observed for diapausin, defensin-like and most moricin genes (Fig

153

1A).

154

Only 8 antimicrobial response genes were found to be significantly downregulated (Fig 1A). Interestingly,

155

4 were involved in the Imd pathway whereas the 4 remaining ones were dispersed between the AMP, GNBP

156

and lysozyme categories (Fig 1A). The Imd pathway downregulated factors included sickie and the akirin

157

in the hemocytes and SMARCC2 and BAP60 in the fat body (Fig 1A). In D. melanogaster, Sickie

158

participates in the activation of Relish, the transcription factor of the Imd pathway (58) and the akirin acts

159

together with the Brahma chromatin-remodeling complex, containing BAP60 and SMARCC2, as cofactor

160

of Relish to induce the expression of AMP genes (59). Given the potent induction of anti-Gram negative

161

bacteria immune responses in the two tissues, the down-regulation of these genes could be attributed to

162

immune regulations. However, it has been shown that in the close species S. exigua, live X. nematophila

163

reduces the expression of several AMP genes, including attacin, cecropin and gloverin (42, 60, 61). It would

164

thus be of particular interest to determine whether the observed down-regulations are related to this

165

immunosuppressive effect.

166

To summarize, the antimicrobial responses are potent and diversified in the two tissues, with a common

167

induction of genes that probably respond to X. nematophila. Yet unexplained tissue-specific responses were

168

observed and the results show a down-regulation of Imd pathway members that could be related to a

169

previously described transcriptional immunosuppressive effect of the NBC. However, this effect would not

170

be potent enough to suppress the humoral responses at this time point, suggesting that the NBC probably

171

uses other immunosuppressive strategies in this model.

172

Melanization. In the melanization category, 16 genes were found to be upregulated in at least one of the

173

two tissues (Fig 1B). These genes firstly encoded 6 serine proteases (Fig 1B) that were considered as

174

members of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system. The proPO system is an extracellular proteolytic

175

cascade ending in the maturation of the proPO zymogen into PO, which initiates the melanization process

176

(62). Among the upregulated serine proteases, PPAE2 is the only one that is known to take part in proPO

177

processing whereas the other proteases were included in this category because of their characteristic CLIP

178

domains and of their low homology with the serine proteases acting upstream of the Toll pathway in D.

179

melanogaster (63). The other upregulated genes in this category included 3 serpins, which are known to

180

regulate the proPO system in several model insects (62), 3 melanization enzymes, DDC, Yellow-like 1 and

181

Punch-like (64, 65) as well as 4 genes, Reeler-1 and 3 Hdd23 homologs, that are involved in melanization

182

and nodule formation in other models (66, 67) (Fig 1B). Despite of tissue-specific induction patterns, serine

183

proteases and serpins were found in the two tissues (Fig 1B), suggesting that both participate in the

184

stimulation of the proPO system, which is consistent with results obtained in other interaction models (68-

185

70). However, with the exception of the DDC, all the melanization enzymes as well as the nodulation-

186

related genes were specifically induced in the hemocytes (Fig 1B), which is consistent with the very

187

localized nature of this immune response (65) that is mainly mediated by hemocyte subtypes.

188

Finally, only 2 genes, PPAE1 and Yellow-like 2, were found to be significantly down-regulated in this

189

category (Fig 1B). Both were specifically repressed in the hemocytes, which could be due to functional

190

interferences with their upregulated homologs (PPAE2 and Yellow-like 1).

191

In summary, our results suggest that both the hemocytes and the fat body participate in induction and

192

regulation of melanization in response to the NBC and no sign of transcriptional immunosuppression is

193

detected for this response. These results are in agreement with the previous identification of diverse PO

194

inhibitors in both S. carpocapsae (28, 29) and X. nematophila (30, 31).

195

Cellular responses. In the hemocytes, 19 upregulated genes were placed in the cellular responses

196

category (Fig 1C). The signaling ones encoded 3 homologs of the transcription factor Krüppel (Kr) (Fig

197

1C). In D. melanogaster, Kr and Kr homologs are involved in several developmental processes such as

198

embryo patterning (71), organogenesis (72-74), and cell differentiation (75). More specifically in the

199

hemocytes, Kr has been shown to take part in hemocytes’ differentiation and/or activation (76), a crucial

200

step for the induction of cellular immune responses. The recognition genes encoded 3 cellular receptors of

201

the Scavenger (SR) and Integrin families plus the hemolin, a secreted immunoglobulin-containing protein

202

(Fig 1C). Both Scavenger receptors and integrins are known to act as membrane receptors in phagocytosis

203

of bacteria and apoptotic cells (77). In addition, integrins are involved in diverse processes, including cell

204

motility and adhesion, and encapsulation (78, 79). The hemolin is known to act as an opsonin by increasing

205

phagocytosis and nodulation of bacteria in Manduca sexta (80). Among the effector genes, we first

206

identified 5 upregulated genes corresponding to conserved intracellular phagocytosis-related proteins. They

207

included Ced-6, the Rabenosyn-5 (Rbsn-5-like), a V-ATPase subunit (ATP6V0A2-like) and 2 small

208

GTPase Activating Proteins (Rabex-5-like, CdGAPr-like) (77) (Fig 1C).We also found genes encoding

209

membrane proteins, such as the immunoglobulin-containing hemicentin (HMCN-like) (81) and 4

210

tetraspanin-like (Tsp-like) proteins (82) (Fig 1C), that could participate in cell-cell adhesion and cellular

211

immune responses. Interestingly, one of the upregulated tetraspanins (Tsp-like 3) presented 79.5% identity

212

with the Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) tetraspanin D76, which takes part in hemocytes

213

aggregation during capsule formation by trans-interacting with a specific integrin (83). Finally, 2 genes

214

encoding proteins similar to the D. melanogaster clotting factors GP150 (84) and a transglutaminase (Tg-

215

like) (85) were also found upregulated (Fig 1C). Only 2 genes (Ced-6-like, Rbsn-5-like) of the cellular

216

responses category were found to be upregulated in the fat body (Fig 1C) and both encoded intracellular

217

proteins that are probably not related to immunity in this tissue.

218

All the 4 down-regulated putative cellular immunity-related genes were specifically modulated in the

219

hemocytes (Fig 1C). They encoded 2 Rho GTPase Activating Proteins (RhoGAP-like), a scavenger

220

receptor similar to the D. melanogaster Croquemort receptor (SR-B3) and a homolog of the D.

221

melanogaster integrin α-PS1. In D. melanogaster, Croquemort has been shown to take part in phagocytosis

222

of apoptotic cells and of the Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus but not of the Gram negative

223

bacterium Escherichia coli (79, 86). Integrin α-PS1 is a ligand of the extracellular matrix protein laminin

224

(87). It is involved in migration and differentiation of several cell types during development (88-90) but

225

does not seem to be required for any immune process. Their down-regulations are thus probably due to

226

their uselessness in the context of the response to the NBC.

227

Overall, the results suggest that all types of cellular responses are transcriptionally induced at 15 hpi,

228

including phagocytosis and nodulation, as well as encapsulation that would be adapted to the bacterial

229

partner or the nematode, respectively. In addition, the induction of coagulation responses is particularly

230

interesting, since many clotting factors participate in D. melanogaster resistance to infestation by another

231

type of NBC, the Heterorhabiditis bacteriophora-Photorhabdus luminescens association (91-94).

232

Moreover, despite S. carpocapsae does not pierce the insects’ cuticles as H. bacteriophora (1), it has been

233

shown to express at least two secreted proteases with inhibitory activities towards the formation of clot

234

fibers and coagulation-associated pathogen trapping (26, 27). Once again, the induction of such immune

235

responses is consistent with the previous identification of several virulence factors of the NBC targeting

236

cellular immunity (26, 28, 29, 31-38).

237

Diverse immunity-related genes. A total of 29 modulated genes were involved in other diverse

238

immune processes. They included 10 up- or down-regulated signaling genes, 7 upregulated recognition

239

genes, 8 upregulated effector genes and 5 upregulated genes of unknown functions that are known to be

240

modulated after immune challenge (Fig 1D).

241

The signaling genes firstly encoded 2 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-II-like) and 2 insulin receptor

242

substrate homologs (IRS1-like) (Fig 1D). Insulin signaling is known to have a deleterious impact on the

243

induction of systemic immune responses in the fat body of D. melanogaster (95) whereas insulin increases

244

hemocyte proliferation in the hemolymph of mosquitoes (96) as well as in the hematopoietic organs of the

245

lepidopteran model Bombyx mori (97). In agreement with these assertions, we found that 2 of these genes

246

were down-regulated in the fat body, but all 4 genes were upregulated in the hemocytes (Fig 1D). Two

247

other signaling genes were found to be specifically overexpressed in the hemocytes. The first one is a

248

homolog of the Litopenaeus vannamei (Decapoda: Penaeidae) leucine-rich repeat flightless-I-interacting

249

protein 2 (LRRFIP2-like) (Fig 1D), which has been shown to upregulate AMP expression in L. vannemei

250

as well as in D. melanogaster (98). On the other hand, 3 signaling genes were found to be strictly down-

251

regulated (Fig 1D). Interestingly, these genes included a member of the TGF-β pathway (BAMBI-like) in

252

the hemocytes and a member of the JNK pathway in the fat body (Basket), two pleiotropic pathways that

253

are currently suspected to take a part in the D. melanogaster immune response to nematodes after NBC

254

infestation (47, 99-101). The third down-regulated gene was found in the fat body and encoded MASK, an

255

inducer of the Jak/Stat pathway (102). In the fat body, the Jak-Stat pathway has mainly been shown to

256

induce the expression of cytokines (103) and of a putative opsonin belonging to the TEP family (104).

257

Remarkably, several Tep genes have been shown to participate in antibacterial immunity after NBC

258

infestation in D. melanogaster (91, 105-107). All of these down-regulations could thus impair the insect’s

259

immune response to the NBC. However, more detailed analyses of their functions and modulations would

260

be required to hypothesize immunosuppressive effects of the NBCs.

261

All 7 upregulated recognition genes encoded lectins (Fig 1D). Five of them encoded C-type lectins

262

(CLECT), which are known to be involved in binding of diverse pathogens (108), including bacteria and

263

nematodes (109). This binding can then stimulate several immune responses, such as bacterial aggregation,

264

melanization, phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation (108). The 2 others encoded galectins, which are

265

involved in diverse aspects of mammalian immunity, including pathogens binding (110), and are

266

considered as relevant candidate immune proteins in insects (111). Despite a larger set of upregulated

267

lectins was identified in the fat body, members of these protein families were found upregulated in the two

268

tissues.

269

In the hemocytes, the upregulated effector genes firstly encoded a homolog of the superoxide dismutase

270

(SOD-like), a conserved detoxifying enzyme involved in responses to reactive oxygen species (112) (Fig

271

1D). The 7 remaining genes encoded proteins with similarity to insect metalloproteinase inhibitors (IMPI-

272

like) (Fig 1D), whose functions have only been studied in the lepidopteran model Galleria mellonella. The

273

only characterized IMPI encodes two proteins of which one is probably involved in the regulation of

274

extracellular matrix remodeling and the second specifically targets metalloproteinases from pathogens

275

(113, 114). S. carpocasape and X. nematophila both express several secreted serine proteases as well as

276

metalloproteinases during the infectious process (39, 115-120). The induction of such immune responses

277

could interfere with some of these proteinases to impair the NBC’s virulence and/or survival. Interestingly,

278

all but one of these IMPI homologs were found to be specifically upregulated in the hemocytes, a tissue-

279

specificity that had not been highlighted in previous reports (121, 122).

280

Finally, the remaining genes of unknown function encoded Spod-x-tox, a protein without antimicrobial

281

activity which contains tandem repeats of defensin-like motifs (123), 3 REPAT genes, which are known to

282

be induced in the midgut after exposure to toxins, viruses and intestinal microbiota perturbations in the

283

close species S. exigua (124-126), and Hdd1, which is induced in response to bacteria and peptidoglycan

284

in the lepidopteran models Hyphantria cunea and Bombyx mori (127, 128) (Fig 1D).

285

In summary, we found an important additional mobilization of several relevant candidate immune genes,

286

including mainly insulin signaling factors and IMPIs in the hemocytes and lectins in the fat body. In

287

addition, these results suggest that the candidate immune pathways TGF-β, JNK and Jak/Stat could be

288

down-regulated. Such down-regulations are in disagreement with the results of Yadav and colleagues (43)

289

in D. melanogaster and thus would require further investigation.

290

Temporal analysis of the induced immune responses

291

In order to put the S. frugiperda immune responses in relation with the infectious process, we then described

292

their temporal dynamics in each analyzed immunocompetent tissue. To this aim, we monitored with RT-

293

qPCR experiments the induction levels of selected representative immune genes from 5 hpi, the mean time

294

at which nematodes release X. nematophila in the hemocoel, to 20 hpi, which is about 9 hours before the

295

first insect deaths (S1 Fig).

296

In the hemocytes, the selected genes included 15 genes of the antimicrobial response, 2 genes involved in

297

melanization, 5 cellular response genes, 2 lectins and one IMPI-like gene. At 5 hpi, only 2 genes, encoding

298

a lebocin antibacterial (52) AMP (Lebocin 2) and the negative regulator Pirk of the Imd pathway (129),

299

were found to be significantly upregulated. However, most of the selected genes that are strongly induced

300

at later time points also presented positive log2 fold changes at this time point (Fig 2A). From 10 to 20 hpi,

301

all selected genes but few exceptions (cecropin D, Tg-like and Integrin -like) due to biological variability

302

were significantly upregulated at each time point (Fig 2A). Clustering analyses based on Pearson

303

coefficients however revealed 3 distinct clusters of covariations. The first one contained 13 genes belonging

304

to all the categories cited above and corresponded to very stable induction patterns (Fig 2A). The second

305

one, which contained 8 genes involved antimicrobial and cellular responses plus the selected C-type lectin

306

(CLECT (ccBV)), corresponded to slightly increasing patterns (Fig 2A). Finally, the third one, which

307

contained the Relish and Pelle members of the Imd and Toll pathways (22), an integrin and the DDC

308

melanization enzyme (130) genes, corresponded to slightly decreasing patterns (Fig 2A).

309

In the fat body, the selected genes included 15 genes of the antimicrobial response, 2 genes involved in

310

melanization, one galectin gene (Galectin 1) and an IMPI-like gene (IMPI-like 3). At 5 hpi, all 7 selected

311

AMPs, PGRP-S1 and Galectin 1 were found to be upregulated (Fig 2B). All these genes were among the

312

most strongly overexpressed at later time points. Such as in the hemocytes, most of the selected genes were

313

then significantly upregulated from 10 to 20 hpi (Fig 2B). In this tissue, the genes only subdivided into two

314

main covariation clusters: a cluster of genes with stable induction patterns and a cluster of genes with

315

increasing induction patterns. The first cluster contained 10 genes of which 8 were involved in antimicrobial

316

responses, one encoded a melanization-related serine protease (Snake-like 2) and one encoded the Galectin

317

1 (Fig 2B). The second cluster contained 9 genes, of which 7 were involved in antimicrobial responses, one

318

encoded the DDC melanization enzyme (130) and the last one encoded the IMPI-like 3 (Fig 2B).

319

Altogether, the results obtained for the two tissues show that most of the transcriptional immune responses

320

induced at 15 hpi take place between 0 and 10 hpi, which is comparable to timings observed in other

321

interaction models (131-133). The results also indicate that these responses are globally stable across the

322

time post-infestation despite some distinct gene induction patterns in each category of response.

323

Interestingly, while we were hoping to discriminate between an early response, probably activated by the

324

nematode presence, and a later response, probably reacting to bacterial growth, we did not find any clear

325

link between the gene inductions’ dynamics and the different immune processes and pathways that were

326

represented in our selection.

327

Evaluation of each NBC partner’s part in the induced immune responses

328

In order to identify each NBC partner’s relative participation in the fat body’s and hemocytes’ immune

329

responses, we used RT-qPCR to compare the induction levels of the selected immune genes after

330

independent infections by the whole NBC, the axenic nematode or the bacterial symbiont. To this aim, we

331

decided to use a more standardized protocol of direct injection of the pathogens into the hemocoel, thereby

332

limiting putative side effects such as early hemocoel colonization by intestinal microorganisms.

333

Importantly, we previously compared the kinetics of X. nematophila growth and of S. frugiperda survival

334

after injection of the entire NBC and of 200 X. nematophila (S2A and S2B Fig). This comparison showed

335

that both kinetics are very similar and thus that any difference of induction level between the 2 conditions

336

would not reflect differences in bacterial load or physiological state. However, the putative impact of

337

axenization on the nematode’s physiology could not be assessed by the same way due to technical

338

limitations and to its avirulence in absence of its bacterial symbiont (S2B and S2C Fig).

339

In the hemocytes, 14 genes presented higher induction levels in response to X. nematophila than in response

340

to the axenic nematode (Fig 3). In the antimicrobial category, they included the negative regulator Pirk of

341

the Imd pathway (129), all the selected attacin, cecropin, gloverin, lebocin and gallerimycin AMPs, the 2

342

selected PGRP-S, and also probably the Imd pathway transcription factor Relish (22) (Fig 3A). As indicated

343

above, the Imd pathway, as well as the attacin, cecropin and gloverin AMP families, are known to take part

344

in anti-Gram negative bacteria immune responses (11, 52). Their induction patterns thus indicate that the

345

antimicrobial X. nematophila-induced responses are well adapted to the nature of the pathogen. Moreover,

346

these results are in agreement with the study of Aymeric and colleagues (44) showing that the Imd pathway

347

functions in the D. melanogaster immune response to X. nematophila. In the other categories, the X.

348

nematophila-induced genes encoded the DDC melanization enzyme (130), the hemolin antibacterial

349

opsonin (80), the IMPI-like 3, and also probably the selected integrin (Integrin β-like) (Fig 3B, 3C and 3D).

350

Once again, all of these genes are susceptible to play a part in an immune response to a pathogenic

351

bacterium even though most of them could act on diverse types of invaders. Surprisingly, we found that X.

352

nematophila strongly over-induces the transglutaminase (Tg-like) putative clotting factor (85) (Fig 3C).

353

This result could suggest that the bacterium is actually the main responsible for tissue damages at this time

354

point and/or that Tg-like expression is induced in response to bacteria. Importantly, this result is in

355

agreement with the study of Yadav and colleagues (43), who showed that the D. melanogaster Fondue

356

clotting factor was induced after infestation by the NBC but not after infestation by axenic nematodes.

357

Remarkably, most of the genes that were mostly induced by X. nematophila presented higher induction

358

values in response to the bacterium alone than in response to the whole NBC. However, this observation

359

cannot be directly interpreted as an antagonistic effect of the nematode partner since it could be due to

360

changes in the relative proportions of each hemocyte subtype, which would not necessarily reflect absolute

361

variations in their numbers. In addition, the nematode partner specifically induced the overexpression of

362

the selected C-type lectin (CLECT (ccBV)) and was probably the main inducer of the Galectin 1, the

363

tetraspanin D76 homolog (Tsp-like 3) and the selected diapausin AMP (Diapausin 5) (Fig 3A, 3C and 3D).

364

As mentioned before, the M. sexta tetraspanin D76 is known to take part in encapsulation (83) and some

365

lectins can bind nematodes and participate in melanization (109) as well as in all types of cellular immune

366

responses. Once again, their induction patterns are consistent with the nature of the pathogen, since both

367

types of molecules could be involved in classical anti-nematode immune responses, such as cellular or

368

melanotic encapsulation (134). Finally, 5 genes, encoding the Toll pathway members Pelle and Cactus (22),

369

the selected moricin AMP (Moricin 2), the melanization-related PPAE2 and the Krüppel-like transcription

370

factor (Kr-like factor 1), were similarly induced by each of the three pathogens (Fig 3A, 3B and 3C),

371

suggesting that these responses are induced by the 2 partners without any additive effect.

372

In the fat body, statistical analysis of the results firstly revealed that the induction levels of Pirk as well as

373

of the selected cecropin and gloverin AMPs were significantly lower in response to the axenic nematode

374

than in response to the NBC and to X. nematophila (Fig 4A), suggesting the bacterial partner is the main

375

responsible for their inductions. In addition, despite non-significant statistics, the results for the selected

376

attacin AMP, PGRP-S6 and GNBP3 showed similar induction patterns (Fig 4A). As for the hemocytes, the

377

induction patterns of Pirk and of the attacin, cecropin and gloverin AMPs suggest that the fat body’s

378

antimicrobial response to X. nematophila is well adapted to the type of pathogen that is met. On the

379

contrary, the induction levels of the melanization-related serine protease (Snake-like 2) was significantly

380

lower in response to X. nematophila than in response to the NBC and to the axenic nematode (Fig 4B),

381

suggesting that the nematode partner is the main responsible for its induction. Similar induction patterns

382

were obtained for the Toll pathway members Toll and Cactus (22) as well as for Galectin 1 (Fig 4A and

383

4C). As mentioned for the hemocytes, the induction of lectins and melanization-related genes in response

384

to the nematode is consistent with the nature of the pathogen since both could participate in classical anti-

385

nematode immune responses (134). The induction of Toll pathway members is more difficult to relate with

386

known anti-nematode immune responses and Yadav and colleagues (47) found that the inactivation of this

387

pathway does not impact the D. melanogaster survival to infestation by the whole NBC or by axenic S.

388

carpocapsae. Therefore, the involvement of this immune pathway in anti-nematode immune responses may

389

depend on the downstream effectors and thus be variable between insect species. Finally, the other genes

390

did not show any clear difference of induction level after injection of the 3 pathogens, except for the

391

gallerimycin AMP, PGRP-S1 and the DDC melanization enzyme, which presented a lesser induction when

392

each NBC partner was injected alone (Fig 4A and 4B). These results suggest synergistic effects of the

393

nematode and of the bacterium on the induction of these genes.

394

In summary, we found in the 2 tissues that most of the selected genes presented partner-specific induction

395

patterns, suggesting that the immune response to the NBC corresponds to combinations of responses

396

induced by each partner. The detailed analysis of these genes indicates that X. nematophila is the main

397

inducer of most of the selected genes, and especially of the well-known antibacterial ones. On the other

398

hand, S. carpocapsae is the main inducer of some melanization and encapsulation-related genes and of the

399

selected lectins, which could all take part in classical anti-nematode immune responses. The results thus

400

globally suggest that the hemocytes and the fat body both respond by adapted ways to each NBC partner

401

despite some yet unexplained results, such as an induction of Toll pathway members in the fat body by the

402

nematode partner.

403

Expression patterns of two new clusters of candidate immune genes

404

During our first analysis of the RNAseq data, we identified 2 new clusters of candidate immune genes (48).

405

The first one, named the Unknown (Unk) cluster, was localized close to Tamozhennic, a gene encoding a

406

nuclear porin involved in the nucleation of Dorsal, the transcription factor of the Toll pathway (135). It

407

contained 5 genes predicted to encode secreted peptides and short proteins that were all highly

408

overexpressed in the midgut, fat body and hemocytes at 15 hpi and of which 4 were the unique mobilized

409

genes at 8 hpi in the fat body. The second cluster, named the Genes with Bacterial Homology (GBH)

410

cluster, contained 3 genes located inside a defensin-like AMP cluster in the S. frugiperda genome. The 3

411

genes were predicted to encode secreted proteins similar to each other and one of them was also found

412

highly induced at 15 hpi in the 3 tissues. The particularity of these genes is that homologs are found only

413

in lepidopteran species as well as, intriguingly, in Gram positive bacteria. Here, we reexamined the

414

expression patterns of the Unk and GBH genes and found that the 5 Unk genes were mainly expressed in

415

the fat body whereas 2 of the 3 GBH genes were mainly expressed and induced in the hemocytes (S2 Table).

416

In order to learn more about their putative functions, we decided to analyse, as we did for the known

417

immune genes, their induction patterns across the time post-infestation and in response to each NBC partner

418

in the corresponding tissues. In both cases, we found that the induction dynamics of the genes were very

419

similar to those of immune genes, with an upregulation that becomes significant at 5 or 10 hpi and with

420

globally stable induction patterns from 10 to 20 hpi (Fig 5A and 5B).

421

In the case of the GBH cluster, the results that we got for the 2 NBC-responsive genes (GBH1 and GBH3)

422

in the hemocytes indicate that they are significantly less induced after axenic nematode injection than after

423

NBC and X. nematophila injections, suggesting that the bacterium is the main responsible for their up-

424

regulation (Fig 5C). We could hypothesize an acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria of the

425

GBH genes. In this case, their putative involvement in the antibacterial immune response would be

426

particularly interesting, since bacterial genes hijacking for immune purpose has only been reported once in

427

metazoans, in the tick Ixodes scapularis (136). Such a hypothesis however requires functional confirmation.

428

In the case of the Unk cluster, we found that the 4 most induced genes in the fat body (Unk2 to 5) are all

429

strongly and similarly induced by the NBC and by the axenic nematode whereas they are not induced by

430

X. nematophila (Fig 5D). The results are very similar for the least expressed Unk gene (Unk1), for which
14

431

we only found a significant induction for the injection of axenic nematodes (Fig 5D). This partner-specific

432

induction pattern suggests the Unk genes are involved in specific aspects of the insect responses to the

433

infestation. In addition, the putative involvement of the Unk genes in the response towards the nematode

434

partner seems to be in agreement with their early mobilization during the infectious process and with their

435

overexpression in the midgut, which is the entry site of the nematode. In our previous study, we had

436

hypothesized the Unk may encode new types of immune effectors (48). However, given their low levels of

437

conservation in species as close as S. littura or S. littoralis (S4 Fig) another hypothesis would be that they

438

correspond to regulatory long non-coding RNAs (137, 138). In both cases, the further functional

439

characterization of these genes could be very promising given our current lack of knowledge of the immune

440

pathways and molecular effectors of insect anti-nematode immunity.

441

Conclusion

442

Here, we provide a very deep and contextualized analysis of the S. frugiperda’s hemocytes’ and fat body’s

443

transcriptional immune responses to infestation by the S. carpocapsae-X. nematophila NBC. Our topologic

444

analysis of these responses at 15 hpi firstly confirmed the induction of very potent and diversified immune

445

responses towards the pathogen, such as suggested by our previous analysis of the transcriptomic data (48)

446

as well as by the study of Yadav and colleagues (43) in the D. melanogaster model. The present work

447

establishes that these responses are very stable across the post-infestation time and that they correspond to

448

combinations of X. nematophila- and S. carpocapsae-induced responses that seem to be well adapted to the

449

nature of each partner (Fig 6).

450

The pieces of information collected during these analyses are of great interest for the study of the dialogue

451

that takes place between each NBC partner and their hosts’ immune systems. First, our results strongly

452

suggest that the NBC immunosuppressive strategies globally have a low impact on the induction of immune

453

responses at the transcriptional level. They also indicate that the nematode and/or its effects on the host are

454

detected by the insect’s immune system that in return seems to induce adapted immune responses towards

455

the pathogen. Such observations could help to identify the limits of previously described

456

immunosuppressive and immunoevasive strategies of the NBC. For example, they suggest that the

457

suppressive effect of X. nematophila on the expression of AMP genes (42, 60, 61) as well as the camouflage

458

strategy of S. carpocapsae (24, 25) are probably far from sufficient to explain their success towards the

459

immune system in the case of S. frugiperda. Nevertheless, we found several unexplained down-regulations

460

of signaling genes, such as of members of the Imd, JNK, TGF-β and Jak-Stat pathways, that represent

461

interesting working trails for the study of the molecular basis of the NBC’s immunosuppressive strategies.

462

Finally, this study allowed the identification of very large panels of candidate immune genes involved in

463

all the main components of insect immunity as well as of some yet uncharacterized genes that could encode

464

new immune factors involved in the response to the complex.

465

Continuing this work with more functional and mechanistic approaches is now required to get an accurate

466

picture of the molecular dialogue between the NBC and the immune system. In the longer term, such

467

approaches could help to identify the precise causes of the immune system’s failure against this NBC and

468

thus the conditions that are required for an adequate use of this NBC against insect pests.

469

Materials and Methods

470

Insect rearing

471

Corn variant Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae) were fed on corn-based artificial diet (139).

472

They were reared at 23°C +/- 1°C with a photoperiod of 16 h/8 h (light / dark) and a relative humidity of

473

40 % +/- 5 %. Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae) were reared on honey and pollen at 28°C in

474

dark.

475

Production and storage of nematobacterial complexes

476

Steinernema carpocapsae-Xenorhabdus nematophila complexes (strain SK27 isolated from Plougastel,

477

France) were renewed by infestation of one month-old Galleria mellonella larvae. They were collected on

478

White traps (140) and stored at 8°C in aerated Ringer sterile solution with 0.1 % formaldehyde. The

479

maximal time of storage was limited to 4 weeks to avoid pathogenicity losses.

480

Production of axenic nematodes

481

Gravid S. carpocapsae females were extracted from G. mellonella dead bodies at day 4 to 6 after infestation

482

by nematobacterial complexes. After 5 washing steps in Ringer sterile solution, the females were surface-

483

sterilized by 20 min incubation in 0.48% (wt/vol) sodium hypochlorite and 3 h incubation in Ringer sterile

484

solution supplemented with antibiotics (150 µg/mL polymyxin, 50 µg/mL colistin, 50 µg/mL nalidixic

485

acid). The eggs were extracted by female crushing with sterile glass pestles and then washed by

486

centrifugation (2 min, 16000 g) in Ringer sterile solution, disinfected by incubation in 0.48% sodium

487

hypochlorite for 5 min, and washed again twice. After microcopic observation, the intact eggs were placed

488

on liver-agar (40 g/L Tryptycase Soja Agar [BioMérieux], 5 g/L Yeast Extract [Difco], 100 g/L porc liver)

489

plates supplemented with antibiotics (150 µg/mL polymyxin, 50 µg/mL colistin and 50 µg/mL nalidixic

490

acid). The plates were maintained inside a dark humid chamber for 1 month to allow nematodes

491

development. The nematodes were then suspended in Ringer sterile solution and infective juvenile stages

492

(IJs) were sorted by pipetting under a microscope (Leica). The IJs were rinsed twice by centrifugation (2

493

min, 3000 g) in 1 mL Ringer sterile solution and used within minutes for experimental infection.

494

Nematodes’ axenicity was verified a posteriori by DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Nematodes

495

were suspended in 200 µL milliQ water supplemented with 200 µL glass beads (Ø ⩽ 106 µm) (Sigma).

496

They were grinded for 2 x 40 sec at 4.5 ms speed with a FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). The

497

debris were discarded by centrifugation (2 min, 16000 g) and 150 µL supernatant were mixed with 200 µL

498

lysis buffer (Quick extract kit, Epi-centre) for a second grinding. To ensure bacterial cell lysis, the samples

499

were incubated at room temperature for 48 h with 2 µL Ready-Lyse Lysozyme solution at 30000 U/µL

500

(Epi-centre). Protein denaturation was then performed by 10 min incubation at 90°C, and RNA was

501

removed by 10 min incubation at 37°C with 20 µL RNase A (20 mg/mL) (Invitrogen). DNA was extracted

502

by successive addition of 500 µL phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and 500 µL chloroform, followed by

503

centrifugations (10 min, 16000 g) and aqueous phase collections. DNA was precipitated with 500 µL 100%

504

ethanol supplemented with 20 µL sodium acetate and by freezing at -80°C for 2 h. After defrosting, DNA

505

was concentrated by centrifugation (30 min, 16000 g) and the precipitates were washed twice by

506

centrifugation (15 min, 16000 g) in 500 µL 70% ethanol. DNA was finally suspended in 50 µL sterile

507

milliQ water and left at room temperature for a few hours to ensure precipitate dissolution. After DNA

508

quantification with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen), X. nematophila presence was assessed by PCR

509

amplification with Xenorhabdus-specific primers (Xeno_F: 5'-ATG GCG CCA ATA ACC GCA ACT A-

510

3’; Xeno_R: 5'-TGG TTT CCA CTT TGG TAT TGA TGC C-3'), which target a region of the XNC1_0073

511

gene encoding a putative TonB-dependent heme-receptor. The presence of other bacteria was assessed by

512

16S rRNA gene amplification with universal primers (141). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed using

513

Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) in a Biorad thermocycler (Biorad), with hybridization temperatures of 55°C

514

and 50°C respectively. PCR products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

515

Experimental infections

516

Experimental infestations with nematobacterial complex were carried out on individual 2nd day 6th instar S.

517

frugiperda larvae according to (48). Larvae were kept at 23°C in 12-well plates with an articial diet (139).

518

Briefly, each well was coated with a piece of filter paper (Whatman) and 150 +/- 20 NBCs in 150 µL Ringer

519

solution were poured in each larva-containing well. 150 µL Ringer sterile solution were used for control

520

larvae.

521

For intra-hemocoelic injection experiments, pathogens were injected in larvae’s abdomens after local

522

application of 70% ethanol with a paintbrush. Injections were performed using a syringe pump (Delta labo)

523

with 1 mL syringes (Terumo) and 25G needles (Terumo). X. nematophila suspensions were prepared as

524

described in Sicard et al (2004)(142). Bacterial culture was diluted in PBS and 20 µL containing 200 +/-

525

50 bacterial cells were injected in the hemocoel at a rate of 1.67 mL/min. 20 µL sterile PBS was used for

526

control larvae. The purity and number of injected X. nematophila were verified by plating 20 µL of the

527

bacterial suspension on NBTA (143). For NBC and axenic nematode injections, 10 +/- 3 nematodes in 20

528

µL solution at 70% Ringer and 30% glycerol were injected at a rate of 2.23 mL/min. Syringes were

529

frequently renewed in order to limit nematodes’ concentration and sedimentation and the number of

530

injected nematodes was verified by 10 simulations of injection in Petri dishes followed by nematode

531

counting under a microscope (Zeiss). Sterile solutions at 70% Ringer and 30% glycerol were used for

532

control larvae. To avoid accidental per os infections, the injected larvae were then briefly washed in sterile

533

PBS and dried on paper towel before being placed in 12-well plates. The pathogens efficacies were checked

534

by monitoring 12 control and 12 infected larvae’s survival for 72 h after infestation or after injection.

535

Production and storage of bacterial symbionts

536

X. nematophila strain F1 isolated from nematobacterial complexes strain SK27 was conserved at -80°C.

537

Within 3 weeks before each experiment, they were grown for 48 h at 28°C on NBTA with erythromycin

538

(15 µg/mL). The colonies were then conserved at 15°C and used for overnight culture at 28°C in 5 mL

539

Luria-Bertani broth (LB) before experiments.

540

RNA extraction

541

RNAs were prepared as described in Huot et al (2019) (48). Briefly, nine larvae per technical replicate were

542

bled in anti-coagulant buffer (144). Hemocytes were recovered by centrifugation (1 min, 800 g) at 4°C and

543

the pellet was immediately flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. The larvae were then dissected for fat body

544

and midgut sampling and the tissues were flash-frozen in eppendorf tubes with liquid nitrogen. After

545

storage at -80°C for at least 24 h, 1 mL Trizol (Life technologies) was added to the pooled tissues. The

546

tissues were then grounded by using a TissueLyzer 85210 Rotator (Qiagen) with one stainless steel bead

547

(Ø : 3 mm) at 30 Hz for 3 min. For optimal cell lyses, grounded tissues were left at room temperature for 5

548

min. To extract nucleic acids, 200 µL chloroform (Interchim) were added and the preparations were left at

549

room temperature for 2 min with frequent vortex homogenization. After centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 g)

550

at 4°C, the aqueous phases were transferred in new tubes and 400 µL 70% ethanol were added. RNA

551

purifications were immediately performed with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and contaminant DNA was

552

removed with the Turbo DNA-freeTM kit (Life Technologies).

553

RNA yield and preparation purity were analyzed by measuring the ratios A260/A280 and A260/A230 with a

554

Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA integrity was verified by agarose gel

555

electrophoresis and RNA preparations were conserved at - 80 °C.

556

RNAseq experiments

557

RNAseq raw data originate from Huot et al (2019) (48). In brief, libraries were prepared by MGX GenomiX

558

(IGF, Montpellier, France) with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample preparation kit (Illumina). The

559

libraries were then validated on Fragment Analyzer with a Standard Sensitivity NGS kit (Advanced

560

Analytical Technologies, Inc) and quantified by qPCR with a Light Cycler 480 thermal cycler (Roche

561

Molecular diagnostics). cDNAs were then multiplexed by 6 and sequenced on 50 base pairs in a HiSeq

562

2500 system (Illumina) with a single-end protocol. Image analysis and base calling were performed with

563

the HiSeq Control and the RTA softwares (Illumina). After demultiplexing, the sequences quality and the

564

absence of contaminant were checked with the FastQC and the FastQ Screen softwares. Data were then

565

submitted to a Purity Filter (Illumina) to remove overlapping clusters.

566

For each sample, the reads were pseudoaligned on the S. frugiperda reference transcriptome version

567

OGS2.2 (49) using the Kallisto software (145). Differential expression between infested and control

568

conditions were then assessed for each time point and tissue with the Sleuth software (146). Wald tests

569

were used with a q-value (equivalent of the adjusted p-value) threshold of 0.01 and a beta value (biased

570

equivalent of the log2 fold change) threshold of 1. Only transcripts with normalized counts over 5 in all

571

three replicates of the infested and/or of the control condition were considered as reliably differentially

572

expressed.

573

Previously annotated immune transcripts (49) were then checked for significant expression changes and

574

not annotated differentially expressed ones were researched with the Blast2GO software by blastx on the

575

NCBI nr and drosophila databases (147). To avoid mistakes related to genome fragmentation, the immune

576

transcripts were gathered by unique gene after careful examination of their sequences and of the available

577

genomic data (49). The induction levels of the transcripts were then averaged by unique gene before

578

graphical representation of the results.

579

RT-qPCR experiments

580

cDNAs were synthesized from 1 µg of RNA with the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen),

581

according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

582

The primers (S3 Table) were designed with the Primer3Web tool (148). Their efficiency was estimated by

583

using serial dilutions of pooled cDNA samples and their specificity was verified with melting curves

584

analyses. Amplification and melting curves were analyzed with the LightCycler 480 software (Roche

585

Molecular diagnostics).

586

RT-qPCR were carried out in triplicate for each biological sample, with the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green

587

I Master kit (Roche). For each sample and primer pair, 1.25 µL of sample containing 50 ng/µL of cDNA

588

and 1.75 µL of Master mix containing 0.85 µM of primers were distributed in multiwell plates by an Echo

589

525 liquid handler (Labcyte). The amplification reactions were then performed in a LightCycler 480

590

thermal cycler (Roche) with an enzyme activation step of 15 min at 95°C, and 45 cycles of denaturation at

591

95°C for 5 sec, hybridization at 60°C for 10 sec and elongation at 72°C for 15 sec.

592

Crossing points were determined using the Second Derivative Maximum method with the LightCycler 480

593

software (Roche) and relative expression ratios between control and infected conditions were manually

594

calculated according to the method of Ganger et al (2017)(149). The ratios were normalized to RpL32

595

housekeeping gene relative levels and the EF1 gene was used as an internal control.

596

Statistical analyses of the data were all performed with the R software (150). Differential expression

597

significance between the control and infected conditions was assessed by paired one-tailed t-tests on ∆Cq

598

values. Multiple comparisons of fold changes were assessed by one-way ANOVA on ∆∆Cq values followed

599

by post hoc Tukey tests. P-values under 0.05 were considered as significant for all the above tests. The

600

gplots package was used to draw the heatmaps and the clusters were built from a dissimilarity matrix based

601

on Pearson correlation coefficients.

602

Quantification of nematodes in the midgut lumen

603

NBCs in the midgut lumen were quantified at several times after infestation by nematode counting in the

604

alimentary bolus. For 3 independent experiments, 3 infested larvae were dissected and the midguts

605

alimentary bolus were extracted. Each alimentary bolus was then dissolved in 3 mL sterile PBS in a Petri

606

dish (Ø : 35 mm) and motile nematodes were counted with a microscope (Leica).

607

Quantification of X. nematophila in the hemolymph

608

The concentration of X. nematophila in the hemolymph was estimated by CFU counting. For 3 independent

609

infection experiments and 3 technical replicates, hemolymph was collected by bleeding of 3 caterpillars in

610

200 µL PBS supplemented with phenylthiourea (Sigma). The volumes of hemolymph were then estimated

611

by pipetting and serial dilutions of the samples were plated on NBTA with 15 µg/mL erythromycin. CFU

612

were counted after 48 h incubation at 28°C and the counts were reported to the estimated hemolymph

613

volumes in order to calculate the bacterial concentrations. Hemolymph of naive larvae was also plated for

614

control.

615

Insect survival kinetics

616

Survival kinetics were performed in triplicate on pools of 20 infested or injected larvae. Survival was

617

monitored from 0 to 72 hours after contact or injection. Naïve larvae were used as control for infestations

618

whereas larvae injected with PBS were used for controls of X. nematophila injections and larvae injected

619

with 70% Ringer - 30% glycerol solutions were used for controls of nematobacterial complexes and

620

nematodes injections.

621

Parasitic success measurement

622

Parasitic success was measured in triplicate on pools of 20 nematobacterial complexes or axenic

623

nematodes-injected larvae. Dead larvae were individually placed on white traps (140) approximately 2 days

624

after their deaths. The emergence of nematodes was assessed at day 40 after injection by observation of the

625

collection liquid with a microscope (Leica). Parasitic success was then calculated as the percentage of

626

larvae with nematode emergence among the infected larvae.
