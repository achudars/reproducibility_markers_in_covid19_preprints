Abstract
Early vertebrate embryogenesis is characterized by extensive post-transcriptional regulation
during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on mRNA
have been shown to affect both translation and stability of transcripts. Here we investigate the
m6A topology during early vertebrate embryogenesis and its association with polyadenylated
mRNA levels. The majority (>70%) of maternal transcripts harbor m6A, and there is a substantial
increase of m6A in the polyadenylated mRNA fraction between 0 and 2 hours post fertilization.
Notably, we find strong associations between m6A, cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational
efficiency prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Interestingly, the relationship between m6A
and translation is strongest for peaks located in the 3’UTR, but not overlapping stop codons.
Sequence analyses revealed enrichment of motifs for RNA binding proteins involved in
translational regulation and RNA degradation. After ZGA, m6A seem to diminish the effect of miR430 mediated degradation. The reported results improve our understanding of the combinatorial
code behind post-transcriptional mRNA regulation during embryonic reprogramming and early
differentiation.

Introduction
Post-transcriptional chemical modifications of RNA alter their fate and are important for RNA
function. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most abundant internal mRNA
modification, and each mRNA contains on average three to five m6A modifications [1, 2]. The fate
and life-time of m6A containing mRNAs is partly regulated through specific interaction with the
YTH-domain containing proteins. RNAs bound by YTHDF2 is transported to decay sites resulting in
increased degradation rates [3], while mRNAs bound to YTHDF1 are more efficiently translated
through interaction with the translation machinery [4]. In addition to these direct effects, m6A can
change the secondary structure of transcripts and allow proteins to bind otherwise hidden
sequence motifs [5, 6].

Zebrafish is a very attractive system to study embryogenesis and associated processes such as
reprogramming and differentiation, including their associated transcriptomic and epigenetic
blueprints. Although the zebrafish share embryonic features with other species, embryogenesis is
remarkably fast compared with mammals (Fig 1a). The egg is activated upon water contact, and
after fertilization and the zygote period (1-cell; 0 to 0.75 hours post fertilization, hpf), the embryo
start to divide rapidly during cleavage stages (0.75 to 2 hpf), reaching 64-cells before entering the
blastula period (2.25 to 5.25 hpf). During this time span, zygotic genome activation (ZGA, ~3 hpf),
occurs. At 4hpf (“sphere”) there is robust expression of many genes important for further
developmental progress [7, 8]. The blastula period cells can form embryonic stem cells in culture,
similar to the inner cell mass of mouse embryos [9, 10]. Thus, from fertilization until blastula, the
germ cells have been reprogrammed to become pluripotent. During the gastrula period (5.25 to 10
hpf), the germ layers are formed. The gastrula period is characterized by more extensive changes
in cell division synchrony and cell migration patterns, leading to the formation of the “shield” at 6

hpf.

Due to the lack of transcription, early embryonic development relies on maternally provided
transcripts and proteins [8]. Post-transcriptional mechanisms such as elongation of polyA tails
through cytoplasmic polyadenylation (CPA), and mRNA degradation are crucial for normal
developmental progression [11]. CPA causes transitioning of maternal transcript from a dormant
to an actively translatable state [7, 12, 13]. This mechanism regulates thousands of maternal
transcripts [7, 14], including important factors for reprogramming and ZGA, such as pou5f3 and
nanog [12, 15]. How these transcripts are targeted for CPA after fertilization remains largely
unknown, since the amount of variation explained by cis elements is low, and most studies are
performed on maturing oocytes [16, 17].

Degradation of maternal RNAs and proteins is achieved both through maternal and zygotic
programs [18]. Motifs in the 3’UTR such as AU-rich elements (AREs) together with stabilizing (e.g.
HuR/Elavl1) or destabilizing (e.g. Auf1) RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are implicated in regulating
the stability of transcripts [19]. After ZGA, degradation of many maternal RNAs is mediated by the
microRNA-430 (miR-430) family [20]. However, miR-430 miRNAs have many more predicted
targets than those affected by miRNA knock-down [20]. In the cases of both mRNA activation and
degradation it therefore remains a possibility that there are additional regulatory layers that
determines which transcripts are targeted for degradation, or CPA and translation.

m6A is dynamically regulated in the heat shock response and during sporulation in yeast [21, 22].
Recent studies have also indicated a role for m6A in regulating pluripotency related genes and the
reprogramming process [23-25]. More recently it was reported that m6A reader protein Ythdf2
mediates degradation of maternal transcripts in zebrafish embryos [26]. However, other potential

effects of m6A, such as cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational efficiency, were not
examined.

We therefore found it timely to investigate the role of m6A during early embryogenesis in a
broader perspective. We performed m6A-RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (m6AIP-seq), and compared it to multiple published datasets available for the studied developmental
period (0 to 6 hpf). We find that m6A is a highly prevalent modification on maternally produced
RNA transcripts, with an estimate of 75% of the genes being modified at some level, much higher
than recent estimates [26]. There is a substantial increase of m6A in the mRNA fraction between 0
and 2 hpf. After extensive CPA, m6A modified transcripts are translated at a substantially higher
level at 2 hpf (64-cell stage) than transcripts without m6A, and generally become degraded
between 4 and 6hpf (blastula to gastrula stage). Furthermore, between 4 and 6 hpf, m6A
containing transcripts targeted by miR-430 are more stable than miR-430 targets without m6A.
These observations warrant further functional studies, and implicate m6A in several key molecular
processes important for embryonic development, including ZGA and reprogramming.

Materials and methods
Zebrafish husbandry and stage selection
Embryos from the AB wild type strain were obtained from the NMBU zebrafish facility where the
zebrafish were kept at 28±1°C on a 14-10 hour light-dark cycle at a density of 5-10 fish/L. System
water (SW) was prepared from particle and active charcoal filtrated tap water, deionized
by reverse osmosis (RO) and kept sterile by UV irradiation. The water was conditioned to a
conductivity of 500µS/cm, general hardness (GH) 4-5 and pH 7.5 by addition of 155g synthetic sea
salt (Instant Ocean, Blacksburg, USA), 53g sodium carbonate and 15g calcium chloride (Sigma-

Aldrich) per liter RO water. Adult fish were fed with Gemma Micro 300 (Skretting, Stavanger,
Norway) dry feed twice a day and live artemia (Scanbur, Karlslunde, Denmark) once a day. Health
monitoring was by daily inspection, use of sentinel fish sent for pathology (ZIRC, Eugene, Oregon)
and water microbiology analysis (NMBU Vetbio, Oslo) every six month. Adult fish were allowed to
mate for 30 minutes in standard 1L breeding tanks (Aquatic Habitats, Apopka, FL). Harvested
embryos were kept in autoclaved SW at 28 °C, harvested by snap freezing (liquid nitrogen) and
visually controlled for stage and lack of abnormalities at the selected time points. The zebrafish
facility and the used SOPs, including protocol for fish line maintenance, have AAALAC accreditation
(No. 1036), and is approved by the National Animal Research Authority. All experiments were
performed according to Norwegian Animal Welfare Act (2009), the EU Directive 2010/63.

Quantification of global m6A by LC-MS/MS
We collected three batches of 50 embryos and isolated total RNA from each using the RNeasy
MicroKit (QIAGEN, #74004), in which a needle and syringe and a QIAshredder (QIAGEN, #79654)
was used to disrupt the embryos. PolyA+ RNA was extracted using Dynabeads® mRNA Purification
Kit (Ambion, #61006).

RNA was hydrolyzed to nucleosides by 20 U benzonase (Santa Cruz Biotech), 0.2 U nuclease P1,
and 0.1 U alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in ammonium acetate pH 6.0 and 1 mM magnesium
chloride at 37ºC for 40 min, added 3 volumes of methanol and centrifuged (16,000 g, 30 min, 4
o

C). The supernatants were dried and dissolved in 50 µl water for LC-MS/MS analysis of m6A and

unmodified nucleosides. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Shimadzu Prominence
HPLC system with a Zorbax SB-C18 2.1x150 mm i.d. (3.5 µm) column equipped with an Ascentis
Express C18 150 x 2.1 mm ID (2.7 μm) column equipped with an Ascentis Express C18 5 x 2.1 mm
ID (2.7 µm) guard column (Sigma-Aldrich). The mobile phase consisted of water and methanol

(both added 0.1 % formic acid), for m6A starting with a 5-min gradient of 5-60 % methanol,
followed by 5 min re-equilibration with 5 % methanol, and for unmodified nucleosides maintained
isocratically with 30 % methanol. Mass spectrometric detection was performed using an MDS
Sciex API5000 triple quadrupole (AB Sciex) operating in positive electrospray ionization mode,
monitoring the mass transitions 282.1/150.1 (m6A), 268.1/136.1 (A), 244.1/112.1 (C), 284.1/152.1
(G), and 245.1/113.1 (U).

m6A-RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing
We isolated total RNA from four zebrafish developmental stages (1-cell/20 minutes post
fertilization, 2, 4 and 6 hpf), in batches of 200 embryos, using TRIzol (Invitrogen, cat.no. 15596018). We added ERCC spike-in RNA (TermoFisher scientific, cat.no. 4456740) to the trizol. RNA
yield and quality can be found in table S1. For each sequencing library two batches of total RNA
(from 200 embryos) were merged and enriched for polyA+ RNA using Dynabeads® mRNA
Purification Kit (Ambion, #61006). Two biological replicates (with 2 x 200 embryos in each) for
each stage were used in the m6A-IP experiment. The m6A-IP experiment was carried out as
previously described [27]. Briefly, polyA+ enriched RNA was partially fragmented by alkaline
hydrolysis, ethanol precipitated and SDS-PAGE size selected for 20-80nt. Part of the fragmented
RNA was used as input, to account for changes in polyadenylated mRNA levels, and the rest was
immunoprecipitated at 4oC for 2 h using Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies, # 10008D)conjugated anti-m6A antibody (Synaptic systems, # 202003). After stringent washing, the bound
RNA was eluted with 0.5mg/ml N6-methyladenosine sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, # M2780),
ethanol precipitated, and resuspended with RNase-free water. The eluted RNA and input RNA
were subjected to 3’pre-adenylated DNA linker ligation with T4 RNA ligase2, truncated KQ (NEB,
#M0373L), at 16 oC over night. The sequencing library was constructed with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU)-CLIP protocol described in [28], with improved RT primers as indicated in [27], without

crosslinking. The samples were sequenced in four lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The data is
deposited under GEO accession number GSE89815.

Analyses of m6A-IP-seq
The sequencing output from each of the 4 lanes in the sequencing run was trimmed 7 nucleotides
in the 5’end, and de-multiplexed (4 samples in each lane). Reads from both m6A-IP and input
samples were mapped to Zv10 using the STAR aligner [29] with options --seedSearchStartLmax 15
--clip3pNbases 10 --clip5pNbases 10 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax
0.05 --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.0 --outFilterMatchNmin 15 --outFilterScoreMinOverLread
0.0.

Approximately 99% of reads mapped (Table S2). For the input control samples, the number of
input reads per ensemble83 gene was obtained using featureCounts v.1.5.0 [30], using default
options. The data was normalized as previously described [31] after obtaining normalization
factors using calcNormFactors in the edgeR package [32]. For visualization in IGV we made tdf files
using IGVTools [33], with options -w 10 --minMapQuality 5, thus only visualizing high confidence
reads.

We performed peak calling and detection of differentially methylated genes using ExomePeak [34]
(FDR cut-off = 0.05). For all analyses we used the “consistent peaks” dataset (peaks detected in
both samples). We selected genes with a 2-fold up or down-regulation for functional annotation
analyses.

To generate a complete set of peaks, comparable between samples, we merged peaks found at
the different stages (overlapping peaks merged using mergeBed). We then counted the number of

high confidence IP and input reads in each peak, and after adjustment for sequencing depth
(dividing counts by million high confidence mapped reads in the sample), we calculated the m6AIP/input ratio (adding a value of 0.5 to both the IP and input value to avoid division by zero, and
high, but irrelevant ratios for low values). This dataset was used as an estimate of the fraction of
transcripts with and without m6A (for each gene), and to measure the correlation between
samples (using Spearman correlation).

Gene annotations were downloaded from Ensembl83 and we extracted first and last exons, and
stop codons from the GTF file using a custom script. Sequences were either obtained directly from
Biomart (e.g. 3’UTRs), or extracted using getFasta in the bedTools suite (e.g. m6A regions).
To construct the m6A fate map we intersected bed files from the peak calling using bedTools
(intersectBed).

We performed de novo motif discovery using HOMER (v. 4.8) [35], motif occurrences using FIMO
[36] and discriminant analysis using DREME [37]. For the FIMO analysis we selected a thresholds
that for all motifs led to no mismatches from the IUAPAC motif. An exception was made for the
U10 motif where one mismatch was allowed. EaSeq [38] was used to create heatmaps of m6A, stop
codons and SAPAS reads. R (https://cran.r-project.org) was used extensively in data mining,
statistical testing and for visualization.

Analyses of published datasets
Datasets were downloaded from public repositories and reads mapped using STAR (v. 2.5.0a).
FeatureCounts (v.1.5.0) were used to count reads per gene with parameters according to library
type and sequencing technology (see table S3).

Results
Global m6A levels during embryogenesis are dynamic
We measured the amounts of m6A in total and polyA enriched RNA from different early embryonic
stages of Zebrafish development using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
There was a significant increase of m6A (per total unmodified nucleotides) in the polyadenylated
RNA fraction between 0 hpf and 1.5 hpf (p = 0.0016 after correction for multiple tests (4 pairwise
tests), two-sided t-test, n = 3, 22% increase) (Fig 1b), but there was no change in the amount of
m6A in total RNA (Fig S1).

m6A-seq and the embryonic m6A transcriptome
To gain insight into which polyadenylated mRNAs carry the m6A modification we performed m6ARNA-immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (m6A-IP-seq) in duplicates (400
embryos per replicate), of four developmental time points; 0, 2, 4 and 6 hpf (Fig 1a and see
methods and table S1 and S2 for RNA yield and sequencing results). To account for fluctuations in
polyadenylated RNA levels, which are substantial during these stages, we also included input
controls for each replicate. Thus, in total, the dataset consist of 16 sequencing libraries. Transcript
isoform quantification is still imprecise [39], therefore we opted for a gene centric analysis. We
refer to “genes” in the following, yet, we are aware that transcripts are the functional unit.

The data were of high quality as evidenced by the similarity between replicates at the single gene
level (Fig 1c), and genome wide correlations of peak scores (Fig S2a). Consistent with the mass
spectrometry results we found a substantial increase in the number of peaks and genes with m6A
between 0 and 2 hpf, and a substantial decline between 4 and 6 hpf (Fig 1d). This dynamic was
also evident when testing for differentially methylated genes between developmental stages (Fig

10

S2b). We constructed an m6A peak diagram of genes found to have m6A at one or more of the four
developmental stages (figure 1e). This diagram demonstrated that 99% of the 6845 m6A
containing genes at 0 hpf are also present with m6A at 2 hpf, plus an additional 2,940 genes.
Subsequently there are very few novel m6A containing genes, but a substantial loss between 2 and
6 hpf (n = 4,880). Interestingly, there is an 85% overlap between genes that gain m6A between 0
and 2 hpf, and those losing m6A between 2 and 6 hpf. Thus, a subset of genes displays a highly
dynamic pattern, whereas a core group of genes has m6A enrichment at all stages.
In several species it has been shown that m6A occurs in a RRACU sequence context. We did a de
novo motif discovery and for all samples (0, 2, 4 and 6 hpf) there were an overwhelming
enrichment for motifs that included the RRACU motif (Fig 1f) (e.g. p-value at 0 hpf = e-480, binomial
distribution). Direct search for the RRACU motif found that this was present in 90.3-91.2% of the
peaks. This validates the m6A-IP-seq results further, and shows that the preference for the RRACU
motif is conserved also in zebrafish.

Maternal and zygotic transcript display differences in m6A levels and
frequency
The fraction of maternal genes (defined as all genes expressed at 2 hpf) detected with m6A was
dependent on the gene expression level cut off used, ranging from 57% at 10 counts per million
(CPM, based on input sample gene counts), to 69% at 50 CPM cut off. In contrast, for zygotic genes
(expression >10 CPM at 6hpf and >2 log2 fold-change increase between 4 and 6 hpf), only 34%
(297 of 873 genes) of the genes were methylated (odd ratio 2.56, 95% CI 2.21-2.97, p-value <2.2e16

, Fisher exact test).

It has been shown that the percentage of m6A modified transcripts in a particular transcript
species (e.g. the number of m6A modified and unmodified nanog) vary between transcripts [40,

11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/528422; this version posted January 23, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

41]. As a rough assessment of this fraction we calculated the m6A-IP/input ratio (see methods).
We found that the median log2 m6A-IP/input ratio for maternal transcripts was 1.33, while it was
1.70 for zygotic transcripts (p-value <2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Maternal transcripts are
thus more commonly methylated than zygotic, but a smaller percentage of the transcripts (for a
particular transcript species) are methylated.

Genes with dynamic m6A status are regulators of embryonic events
We used Metascape to investigate the functionality of genes marked with m6A at different stages
[42]. We focused on the two most dynamic periods, the increase pre-ZGA and the changes
occurring after ZGA by selecting genes that had a m6A log2 fold change >2. Consistent with the
substantial number of genes that both gain methylation pre-ZGA and lose it post-ZGA, the two
groups (up 0-2 hpf and down 4-6 hpf) were enriched for similar terms related to developmental
processes (e.g. embryonic morphogenesis and cell fate commitment) (Fig S3a and b). Genes with
lower m6A level at 6 hpf (relative to 4hpf) were in addition enriched for genes with hydrolase
activity and kinase regulators (Fig S3b). In contrast, genes that gain m6A after ZGA are most
frequently involved in chromatin restructuring and retinol metabolism (Fig S3c). This enrichment
fits well with the transition of modified histones and nucleosomes around this time [43, 44], and
the necessity of retinoic acid signaling during gastrulation [45].

m6A are preferentially found over or in the vicinity of stop codons
In order to identify the location of m6A within genes we intersected peak coordinates with
annotated features (>1 bp overlap with 3’UTRs, first and last exons, and stop codons). Because
annotations can be incomplete and may not perfectly represent early developmental stages, we
used only last exons that had both a 3’UTR and a stop codon associated with them. The results

showed that the vast majority of peaks are found in last exons (81-86%), and a minor fraction in
first exons (6.2-8.7%), consistent with published data [46]. Between 44 and 49% of the peaks
overlapped directly with a stop codon. A gene centered Venn diagram of the position of peaks
revealed that most genes with a last exon peak also had a peak overlapping the stop codon (Fig
1g). Similarly, first exon peaks were rarely present without other m6A peaks (<10% of first exon
peaks). Of note, the antibody used for m6A-IP-seq (see methods) does not discriminate between
m6A and N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). The latter modification was recently shown to
enhance mRNA stability [47].

Interestingly, we found that the m6A/input ratio for peaks stratified by their position in the
transcript were distinct in terms of signal strength. Peaks in last exons that did not overlap with a
stop codon, had a much lower m6A /input ratio than peaks overlapping a stop codon (log2
enrichment of 1.33 and 1.78 at 0 hpf, n = 2,512 and 5,469, p-value <2.2e-16, Wilcoxon test).

In order to improve the resolution of the spatial relationship between m6A, stop codons and
polyadenylation sites we visualized last exons with m6A and their annotated stop codons using
EaSeq [38]. As multiple polyadenylation sites are frequent during embryogenesis [48, 49], we
included SAPAS data (sequencing of alternative polyadenylation sites) from corresponding stages
to visualize the utilized polyadenylation site [49]. The stop codon was frequently found in the
beginning of the last exon (Fig 2a), and overlapped with the normalized m6A signal, but not the
SAPAS signal, both at 0 and 6 hpf. To investigate if the enrichment at the 5’ end was related to the
end of the exon, or the stop codons, we visualized the start and end of each last exon, which again
showed high degree of co-occurrence between stop codons and m6A, and not with the SAPAS
signals (Fig 2b). The results shows that when m6A is present at last exons containing a stop codon,
it occurs in close proximity to the stop codon, while the distance to the cleavage site vary

depending on the length of the last exon.

Comparison with total RNA m6A IP sequencing
In a recent publication ribosome depleted RNA was used to IP m6A during zebrafish
embryogenesis (in contrast to our polyA+ selected RNA) [26] (GSE79213). To evaluate if our result
were in any way biased by the large fluctuations in polyadenylated RNA levels during development
we wanted to compare our results from polyA+ selected RNA with that of rRNA depleted RNA. To
test if we “missed out” on a lot of genes because of polyA+ RNA selection we identified a cohort of
877 genes that had very high total RNA levels compared to polyA+ levels (at 0 hpf), suggesting
they might not be captured during polyA+ selection. Even though underrepresented, 315 of these
were still found to be methylated in our dataset (at 2 hpf), and 562 were found to be
unmethylated. Only 10 of these unmethylated (10 out of 562) were detected in the total m6A CLIPseq experiment, and these genes included ribosomal RNA (5.8S), ribozymes (Nuclear RNAase P)
and Metazoa Signal Recognition Particle RNA. Thus, non-coding RNA components of the ribosome.
Three genes were protein coding according to annotation. From these analyses we conclude that;

i)

Most genes underrepresented in polyA+ sequencing are not methylated (562 of 877
genes).

ii)

Most of those that are methylated are still detected as such (315/325).

iii)

Only a handful of underrepresented genes are detected by total RNA based methods,
and the majority of these are ribosomal components not translated (but still found in
RPF-seq because they are components of the ribosome).

To gain insight into the role of m6A in RNA biology during early vertebrate embryogenesis we took
advantage of the rich repertoire of different sequencing experiments for zebrafish embryonic
stages that are publicly available (see table S3 for references and accession number).

PolyA-tail length and mRNA levels
The pre-ZGA stages of development are characterized by extensive polyA tail dynamics, in
particular the addition of adenosines to the already existing polyA tails of maternal transcripts, a
process referred to as cytoplasmic polyadenylation (CPA) [16]. To analyze a possible relationship
between m6A and polyA tail length we first used direct measurement of the polyA tail length
obtained from poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) experiment [13]. We found
only a small difference between m6A and non-m6A transcripts both at 2 hpf (24.5 and 23.2 nt,
respectively), and at 6hpf (39.7 and 36.9 nt, respectively). However, there is substantial CPA prior
or just after fertilization [7, 50], before the first time point in the PAL-seq study (2 hpf). Therefore,
it remained a possibility that m6A can regulate CPA either in the oocyte, or immediately after
fertilization. As an indirect measure of CPA we used mRNA-seq levels from published mRNA-seq
datasets [7, 51]. Since transcripts here are selected through hybridization between the polyA tail
and oligo(dT) beads, and only low levels of transcription occur, the bulk of mRNA abundance
increase must be due to CPA [8, 31].

Due to large difference in average polyadenylated mRNA levels between m6A and non-m6A genes,
we stratified the genes into comparable subgroups with similar levels. For every subgroup, m6A
genes increase substantially more than non-m6A genes pre-ZGA (Fig 3a). To assess at which time
point the increase occur we used our previously published dataset, which included several early
time points [7]. We found a robust difference between the 1- and 16-cell stage (median log2 foldchange 1.51 and 0.88, n = 7148 and 5970, expression >10 reads at 1-cell stage, p < 2.2e-16,

Wilcoxon rank sum), but only a minor difference between 16- and 128-cell (median log2 foldchange 0.25 and 0.24, n = 7148 and 5970, expression >10 reads at 1-cell stage). Next, we extracted
genes with relatively higher methylation level at 2 hpf compared to 0 hpf, and found that these
had a significantly higher increase pre-ZGA compared to genes with m6A at 0 hpf (1.55 and 1.95
log2 fold-change, p = 2.7e-11, n = 5,143 and 737, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, only genes
expressed >50 CPM at the 1-cell stage).

m6A is associated with higher translational efficiency pre-ZGA
There is a strong relationship between polyA tail length and translational efficiency during
embryogenesis [13]. However, m6A has also been shown to enhance translation through the m6A
binding protein YTHDF1 [4]. To evaluate a possible relation between m6A and translation during
early embryogenesis we generated a dataset with genes that had translational efficiency (TE)
values at three stages (2, 4 and 6 hpf, n = 3,541), using published ribosome protected fragments
sequencing (RPF-seq) data [13]. Through intersections with our m6A peak data we found a large
difference in the TE between m6A (n = 2,648) and non-m6A genes (n = 893) at 2 hpf (median TE
0.55 and -0.31, p-value <2.2e-16, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) (Fig 3b). At 6 hpf, the translation
efficiency for m6A and non-m6A was more similar (0.91 and 0.54 for m6A and non-m6A,
respectively). Also of interest, we found that genes with m6A located in the last exon, but not
overlapping a stop codon, had much higher TE than genes with m6A over the stop codon or in the
5’UTR (TE 0.85, 0.52 and 0.32 for last, stop codon and first exon peaks respectively).

m6A is associated with sequence motifs bound by translational regulators
As shown earlier the RRACU motif was the most overrepresented motif within peak regions. To
gain a deeper insight to the m6A sequence context we performed a more extensive sequence
analysis. We performed discriminant analysis between the 3’UTR of m6A and non-m6A genes, to

potentially detect novel motifs that are different between the two groups. The two top motifs
enriched in m6A genes at 2 hpf were AGU(U/C)C (p-value = 3.4e-156 , 81% vs 65%), and AACG(U/A)
(p-value = 3.0e-121, 74% vs 58%) (Fig 3c). The former motif bear close resembles to a reported Dazl
binding motif [52], while the latter is bound by Unr, with highest affinity when present together
with an upstream purine rich motif [53]. Both Dazl and Unr have been shown to be involved in
translational regulation. Dazl promote translation, probably through elongation of the polyA tail
[52, 54], while Unr interact with CCR4 and PABP in translation dependent decay [55].

mRNA degradation and translational inhibition through miR-430 is modulated by
m6A
During the first 2 hours of embryo development in zebrafish there are only trace levels of
transcription [8], which make this time frame ideal to study the stability of maternally produced
transcripts. Using two complementing total RNA-seq datasets [12, 56], we found no significant
differences in the pre-ZGA stability of m6A and non-m6A genes at 2 hpf (median log2 fold-change 0.21 and -0.28) [56].

After ZGA, miRNAs of the miR-430 family clear the maternal transcriptome [18, 20]. We found that
miR-430 targets are enriched for m6A at 2 hpf (78% and 67% of genes with and without the miR430 seed had m6A, respectively, p <2.2e-16, OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.65-2.01, Fisher exact test). To
investigate if m6A might modify the outcome of miR-430 seed presence in target mRNAs, we
examined the changes in total RNA levels [12]. Notably, there was a significant difference between
miR-430 target genes, with and without m6A, towards enhanced stability if they contained an m6A
residue at 2 hpf (median log2 fold-change -0.94 and -1.80, n = 822 and 575, p <0.001, KolmogorovSmirnov test) (Fig 4a). Interestingly, for m6A and non-m6A genes without the miR-430 seed had
smaller differences (median log2 fold-change -0.34 and -0.60).

Expression of writers, readers and erasers of m6A during development
Proteins involved in m6A functionality can be divided into writers, readers and erasers.
Importantly, all known genes involved in m6A regulation are conserved in zebrafish. Interestingly,
both the writer mettl14 and the eraser alkbh5 have robust increase pre-ZGA (Figs S4a and b). This
suggests a highly dynamic m6A state, with frequent methylation and demethylation. Notably, we
observed high levels of the m6A reader and translational regulator ythdf1 at all stages (Fig 4b). In
contrast, ythdf2 increase from relatively low levels pre-ZGA and reaches its top level at 4.3hpf (Fig
4b). Another gene suggested to be involved in m6A gene regulation, elavl1, has robust increase in
expression from ZGA and onwards (Fig 4c) [3, 57].

Discussion
Our study improves the understanding of two key processes during embryogenesis, posttranscriptional regulation of maternal transcripts, and miR-430 mediated regulation post-ZGA.
There are, however, important questions that remain unanswered. First, do m6A affect CPA only,
and thus indirectly translation, or both CPA and translation independently? The earlier timing of
CPA, and the delay in effect on translation, but not CPA, suggests that CPA is the primary driver.
An exception from this might be for temporarily restricted peaks located away from stop codons,
but still in last exons. They were most strongly associated with translation, yet they display lower
IP/input ratio, suggesting that they are very potent signals for translational increase. Preliminary
analysis using multiple linear regression found that m6A presence were an significant independent
predictor, together with polyA tail length, in predicting TE, however the main proportion of TE
variation is explained by polyA tail length.

Second, it needs to be proven functionally which proteins are involved in the regulation of m6A
levels and effects on mRNA dynamics. It seems likely that ythdf1, already expressed at high levels
at fertilization and previously shown to enhance translation [4], is involved. Further, ythdf2 and
elavl1 can alter the stability of transcripts [3, 58], and their expression profiles suggest a role
during or after ZGA. Indeed, it was recently shown that ythdf2 knock-out cause developmental
delay after ZGA, probably caused by reduced degradation of maternal transcripts and lower
expression of zygotic transcripts [26]. However, only a small number of high confidence ythdf2
targets were identified (n = 135). We could not detect any general effects on total RNA stability
prior to ZGA, consistent with the expression pattern of ythdf2 (Fig 4f). However, genes with m6A at
2 hpf were more strongly degraded post-ZGA, in line with the observed effect of ythdf2 binding.
Yet, degradation is not a general effect of m6A, since genes that retained their m6A modification at
6 hpf were more stable than non-m6A genes post-ZGA. Our results are consistent with a more
complex model of m6A function, in which the mRNA fate depends on the combinatorial effect of
multiple RNA binding proteins, directly to m6A and/or due to effects on secondary structure. The
outcome of m6A is therefore likely to vary in time and space. Our observations indicate that prior
to ZGA the predominant effect of m6A is enhancement of translation, and after ZGA, on stability.

Another gene possibly associated with post-ZGA RNA regulation is Elavl1. Although pulled down in
an m6A bait approach and experimentally linked to m6A [3, 57], it has been questioned if Elavl1
binds m6A directly [59]. However, structural imprints in vivo have shown that m6A alter the
secondary structure of mRNAs [6], and that the altered structure can affect the ability of RNA
binding proteins to target their sequence motifs [5]. This might be the case for the observed
association between m6A and Elavl1. Similarly, we found several sequence motifs for protein
factors such as translational regulators Dazl and Unr, enriched in the vicinity of m6A (Fig 3c).
Enhanced RNA binding of these proteins might also contribute to the RNA dynamics we observed.

It is likely that the relative position of m6A, protein binding sequences and secondary structures
predict the mRNA fate.
Future work will also be needed to determine and understand the onset of high m6A levels in early
embryogenesis. The relatively lower levels of m6A in MII oocytes (3820 genes) reported in Xenopus
[60], indicates that the increase in m6A occurs later than the MII stage. Further studies using
recently developed methods to determine differences in structure and co-occurrence with RNA
binding proteins will increase the understanding of how m6A contributes to RNA biology. The
current work lays an interesting fundament for future mechanistic studies and shed light into the
combinatorial code of mRNA regulation during early vertebrate embryogenesis.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Zebrafish embryogenesis and m6A dynamics. A) Four stages of zebrafish early
embryogenesis with descriptive names on top, and hours post fertilization (hpf) below embryos.
ZGA; Zygotic genome activation. B) Amount of m6A in the mRNA fraction during development
measured by LC-MS/MS. The bars represent the average of three replicates and error bars depicts
one standard deviation. Stages are from left to right; 0 hpf, 1.5 hpf, 2 hpf, 4 hpf and 6 hpf. C)
Integrative genome browser (IGV) snapshot showing all m6A-RIP-seq replicates, and one selected
input sample from each stage. Height of the barplot indicates enrichment level. D) Number of
peaks and genes with m6A identified by m6A-IP-sequencing. E) m6A fate map during early
embryogenesis. Number of genes that gain m6A on the left side, genes with m6A in boxes, genes
with maintained enrichment below boxes and number of genes with lost m6A on the right side. F)
Enriched motif found in peak regions in the 0 hpf sample (p-value <0.001, 53% vs 30%,
hypergeometric test). G) Venn diagram showing which genes have peaks in the different regions.

Figure 2. m6A enrichments are associated with stop codons. A) Heatmaps of last exons with an
annotated stop codon and m6A enrichment at 0 hpf. Leftmost heatmap shows the length of the
exon in black and the stop codon in yellow. The two next heatmaps display m6A enrichment (first)
and the density of SAPAS reads (second) at 0 hpf. The same heatmaps are shown for 6hpf.
B) Start (upper panel) and end (lower panel) of last exons with an annotated stop codon and m6A
enrichment at 0 hpf. Leftmost heatmap visualizes the stop codon position, the next three m6A
enrichment, m6A outside the stop codon and SAPAS read density (green).

Figure 3. m6A and RNA stability, cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation. A) Boxplot of
genes in different expression classes, from low to high polyA+ mRNA levels (left to right), divided
by m6A status. B) ECDF plot of TE values for genes with and without m6A at 2 hpf. C) Motif
discovery results from discriminant analysis of 3’UTRs using DREME.

Figure 4. m6A modulates mRNA fate of miR-430 targeted transcripts. A) ECDF plot of log2 foldchange values post-ZGA from total RNA-sequencing for genes containing the miR-430 seed and
stratified by presence or absence of m6A enrichment. B) and C) Expression of different m6A
readers during development.
