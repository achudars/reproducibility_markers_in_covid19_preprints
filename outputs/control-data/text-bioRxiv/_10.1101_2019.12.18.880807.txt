Abstract:

12

Assembling microbial and phage genomes from metagenomes is a powerful and appealing

13

method to understand structure-function relationships in complex environments. In order to

14

compare the recovery of genomes from microorganisms and their phages from groundwater, we

15

generated shotgun metagenomes with Illumina sequencing accompanied by long reads derived

16

from the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform. Assembly and metagenome-assembled

17

genome (MAG) metrics for both microbes and viruses were determined from Illumina-only

18

assemblies and a hybrid assembly approach. Strikingly, the hybrid approach more than doubled

19

the number of mid to high-quality MAGs (> 50% completion, < 10% redundancy), generated

20

nearly four-fold more phage genomes, and improved all associated genome metrics relative to

21

the Illumina only method. The hybrid assemblies yielded MAGs that were on average 7.8%

22

more complete, with 133 fewer contigs and a 14 kbp greater N50. Furthermore, the longer

23

contigs from the hybrid approach generated microbial MAGs that had a higher proportion of

24

rRNA genes. We demonstrate this usefulness by linking microbial MAGs containing 16S rRNA

25

genes with extensive amplicon dataset. This work provides quantitative data to inform a

26

cost-benefit analysis on the decision to supplement shotgun metagenomic projects with long

27

reads towards the goal of recovering genomes from environmentally abundant groups.

Introduction
29

Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful method that conceptually allows all the genomes

30

from all the organisms and their associated viruses within a sample to be determined with

31

sufficient sequencing depth (Venter et al., 2004; Handelsman et al., 2007). In practice,

32

metagenomic data typically represents hundreds to thousands of microorganisms and viruses at

33

different coverage levels depending on the community structure within the sample (richness,

34

evenness, and genome size variation). These data enable the determination of the community

35

composition (who is there) and total community function (what are they capable of doing). In

36

addition to this wealth of information, one of the most beneficial outcomes of shotgun

37

metagenomic projects is the ability to assemble high quality, complete or nearly-complete,

38

genomes from organisms not yet amenable to cultivation practices (Tyson et al., 2004; Luo et

39

al., 2012). And indeed, such metagenome-assembled-genomes (MAGs) have provided

40

information leading to the cultivation of organisms of interest (Gutleben et al., 2018; Cross et al.,

41

2019; Imachi et al., 2019), along with the discoveries of new metabolic processes (Daims et al.,

42

2015), novel insights into the ecology and evolution of globally abundant groups (Delmont et al.,

43

2018), and uncovering a wide diversity of novel Phylum-level lineages that have restructured the

44

current understanding of the tree of life (Brown et al., 2015; Hug et al., 2016).

45

MAGs not only represent bacteria and archaea, but also include viruses, which are an

46

integral part of most metagenomes (Dutilh et al., 2014). Viruses are the most abundant

47

biological entities in many ecosystems and can exert proportionately large effects on ecosystem

48

functions (Fuhrman, 1999; Breitbart et al., 2002). Viral MAGs have lead to the discovery of

49

megaphages (with genomes >540 kb) from human and animal gut microbiomes (Devoto et al.,

50

2019), provided the first insights into the global distribution of such megaphages (Al-Shayeb et

51

al., 2019), and confirmed that environmental cyanophages contribute to global marine

52

photosynthesis rates (Fridman et al., 2017). However, the identification of viruses from

53

metagenomes and their distinction from prophages continues to be challenging because there is

54

not an established computational gold standard (Nooij et al., 2018).

55

One exciting avenue in reconstructing de novo MAGs has been the inclusion of

56

long-read sequences that can act as scaffolds to short-read sequences to help improve

57

contiguity and bridge repeat regions within a genome (Chen et al., 2019). This concept has

58

been present since the advent of second-generation sequencing technologies (Roche 454,

59

Illumina, SOLiD) (Goldberg et al., 2006), but the breakthroughs in third-generation sequencing

60

technologies, particularly PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), have improved the

61

practicality of such approaches by providing access to much longer reads (Scholz et al., 2014;

62

Frank et al., 2016; Bertrand et al., 2019).

63

The goal of this study was to compare a hybrid assembly approach, incorporating ONT

64

long reads, to an Illumina-only short-read approach with respect to the recovery of high-quality

65

MAGs from a groundwater ecosystem. We leveraged the well-characterized monitoring transect

66

of the Hanich Critical Zone Exploratory (CZE) that encompasses 15 monitoring wells spread

67

across a hillslope covered by mixed beech forest, pasture land, and cropland (Küsel et al.,

68

2016). Groundwater from this site contains a wide diversity of microbial life. The microorganism

69

component is dominated by Patescibacteria, uncultured organisms that are often missed by

70

routine amplicon datasets (Herrmann et al., 2019; Wegner et al., 2019), and the viral component

71

has only recently started to be explored (Kallies et al., 2019). A previous, gene-centric based

72

metagenomics project has identified dominant metabolic pathways within the aquifer (Wegner et

73

al., 2019). However, it has been challenging to directly link these key metabolic pathways to the

3

74

specific microorganisms mediating them, which is critical for our understanding of the ecology of

75

the site.

76

In order to address these knowledge gaps, we first quantified the improvements in the

77

recovery of MAGs by including Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long reads. This approach

78

doubled the number of recovered MAGs that met our quality thresholds and covered a wider

79

range of phylogenetic diversity present. The hybrid approach also improved all MAG metrics

80

assessed and had a higher proportion of recovered MAGs with rRNA genes. From a viromics

81

perspective, there were nearly four times more phages identified from the hybrid assembly, and

82

of these, there were 10x more prophages identified. The results from this study are likely

83

conservative and we expect there to be further improvements as ONT sequence quality

84

increases with more accurate base calling algorithms and as more assembly and binning

85

algorithms are developed to take advantage of all the information provided by long reads.

Materials and Methods

88

Sample Collection, DNA Extraction
Groundwater was collected in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (NW Thuringia,

89

Germany), from shallow groundwater resources in Upper Muschelkalk bedrock that has been

90

extensively described (Küsel et al., 2016; Lehmann and Totsche, 2020). In brief, the Hainich

91

CZE contains a multistorey, fractured aquifer system within the hillslope, composed of altering

92

layers of limestone and mudstone (Kohlhepp et al., 2017). The Upper-Muschelkalk aquifer

93

system is characterized by the limestone-dominated main aquifer (Trochitenkalk formation,

94

moTK; formerly referred to as the HTL) that is predominantly oxic and the mudstone-dominated

95

hanging strata (including Meissner formation, moM; formerly the HTU) that is anoxic (Kohlhepp

96

et al., 2017). Groundwater (115 L) was collected from well H52 (moM) on December 11th, 2018

97

and was sequentially filtered through 0.2 µM, and 0.1 µM PTFE filters (142 mm, Omnipore

98

Membrane, Merck Millipore, Germany). Filters were immediately frozen on dry ice and

99

transported to a -80° C freezer.

100

The DNA extraction was performed as previously described, using a phenol-chloroform

101

based method without mechanical lysis to minimize fragmentation (Taubert et al., 2018).

102

Following extraction, the Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator kit was used to purify and

103

concentrate the DNA for both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing.

104

DNA concentrations of 8.89 ng/µL (0.1µM filter fraction) and 37.7 ng/µL (0.2µM filter fraction)

105

were measured using a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Invitrogen).

106

Illumina Metagenome Preparation and Initial Processing
107

Illumina libraries from both filter fractions were generated using the NEBNext Ultra II FS

108

DNA library preparation kit following the recommended protocol. Size selection was performed

109

using the AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). The average insert sizes were 509 bp (0.2µM

110

fraction) and 392 bp (0.1 µM fraction) as determined with an Agilent Bioanalyzer using a

111

DNA7500 chip. The sequencing was performed in-house on an Illumina Miseq with 2x300 bp v3

112

chemistry. The 0.2 µM filter fraction DNA sample generated 17,660,385 paired-end sequences

113

(10.6 Gbp), while the smaller 0.1 µM fraction sample generated 15,546,350 (9.33 Gbp) raw

114

sequences.

115

Adapter sequences from the Illumina reads were removed using bbduk using kmer

116

searching (k=23, hdist=1) and reads were trimmed with a phred score of 20, allowing to trim

117

both sides of the read. Reads shorter than 50 bp were discarded (Bushnell, 2014). The average

118

estimated insert sizes of the sequences were 234 bp and 214 for the 0.2 µM fraction and the 0.1

119

µM fraction samples, respectively. Raw reads were deposited at the ENA under accession

120

PRJEB35315.

121

Oxford Nanopore Metagenome Preparation
122

We performed Nanopore sequencing of the 0.2 µM fraction on a single MinION flow cell

123

(FLO-MIN106 with an R9.4.1 pore) using the 1D genomic DNA by ligation kit (SQK-LSK109,

124

ONT) following manufacturers’ instructions with minor adaptations. In short, the initial g-TUBE

125

shearing step was omitted and potential nicks in DNA and DNA ends were repaired in a

126

combined step using NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix and NEBNext Ultra II End

127

repair/dA-tailing Module (New England Biolabs, USA) and doubling the incubation time. A

128

subsequent AMPure bead (Agencourt AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter) purification was followed

129

by the ligation of sequencing adapters onto prepared ends. A second clean-up step with

130

AMPure beads was performed and sequencing buffer and loading beads were added to the

131

library. An initial quality check of the flow cell (ID: FAK43462) showed 1761 active pores at the

132

start of sequencing. We loaded the DNA with a concentration of 98 ng/ul (measured by Qubit 3

133

Fluorometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a total amount of ~1.4 µg. The sequencing run

134

stalled after 18 h and was restarted for another 24 h using the MinKNOW software.

135

Basecalling was performed using the Guppy software (v2.3.1) with the high-accuracy

136

model r9.4.1_450bps_large_flipflop. Called reads were classified as either pass or fail

137

depending on their mean quality score. A total of 2,380,279 reads were basecalled and of these

138

2,081,879 (87.5%) were passed as satisfying the quality metric. The passed reads contain a

139

total of 11.58 Gb of DNA sequence with a mean read length of 5,560 nt. This passed-fraction

140

amounts to 91.8% of the total DNA nucleotide bases sequenced.

141
142

We deposited the raw signal files (FAST5) and basecalled reads (FASTQ) at the ENA
under accession PRJEB35315.

143

Metagenome Assembly and Binning
144

We used metaSPAdes v3.13.0 (Nurk et al., 2017) to assemble the hybrid and

145

Illumina-only data in order to be able to directly compare both approaches. The sequences from

146

the 0.2 µm sample were individually assembled with the default parameters specified by the

147

“-meta” flag with only the inclusion of the long reads with the “-nanopore” flag being different.

148

The assembly statistics for the two methods were calculated using MetaQUAST with the default

149

settings (Mikheenko et al., 2016). We binned the scaffolds from each assembly that were longer

150

than 1000 nucleotides (nt) using MaxBin2 (Wu et al., 2016) and MetaBAT2 (Kang et al., 2015,

151

2019) included in the MetaWRAP (Uritskiy et al., 2018) binning module with the “--universal”

152

flag. Differential coverage information was included using Illumina QA/QC reads from both filter

153

fractions. Additionally, scaffolds > 3000 nt from each assembly were binned with BinSanity using

154

the “wf” workflow and the log normalized coverage file produced with the “BinSanity-profile”

155

command (Graham et al., 2017). The MetaWRAP “Bin_refinement” module was used to

156

dereplicate bins produced from the 3 different binning methods, using the MetaWRAP scoring

157

algorithm which favors low redundancy values while also selecting for higher percent

158

completion. We found that the MetaWRAP “Ressamble_bins” module reduced the quality of our

159

bins and thus proceeded with the two sets of refined bins that were at least 50% complete with

160

less than 10% redundancy.

161

Each collection was imported into Anvi’o and MAG statistics were exported using the

162

anvi-summarize command (Murat Eren et al., 2015). Our completeness and

163

redundancy/contamination criteria were initially assessed using estimations from checkM (Parks

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.880807; this version posted December 19, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

et al., 2015), while the estimations exported from anvio were used to calculate the values

165

represented in Figure 1 (visualized using the R package ggplot2 v3.1.0 (Wickham, 2009;

166

Wickham et al., 2019)). The anvio completeness estimations were lower than the checkM

167

values while the redundancy/contamination estimations were higher, and therefore 74 hybrid

168

and 39 Illumina-only MAGs were included, out of the original 82 and 44. Each MAG was

169

screened for rRNA genes using barrnap, with each hit required to be at least 20% of the full

170

gene length (Seemann, 2015). These statistics were compiled from the automatically refined

171

MAGs and not from manually curated MAGs as we considered this the most direct comparison.

172

While we consider it essential that MAGs be manually curated before publishing (Bowers et al.,

173

2017; Shaiber and Eren, 2019), using the automated results for this specific comparison

174

minimizes added bias, and likely underestimates the actual improvements due to the more

175

fragmentary nature of the Illumina-only MAGs.

176

To identify MAGs that were recovered from both assembly methods, FastANI was run on

177

all pairwise comparisons of MAGs that were initially assessed using checkM (82 hybrid, 44

178

Illumina-only) (Jain et al., 2018). All MAGs that were recovered from both assemblies had an

179

average nucleotide identity (ANI) of at least 98.8%, and in all cases, secondary hits were < 82%

180

ANI. These shared MAGs were investigated in more detail as they enabled a direct comparison

181

between the Illumina and the hybrid assemblies. Paired Welch’s t-tests with

182

Benjamini-Hochberg correction were used to specifically test the differences in completeness,

183

redundancy/contamination, genome length, number of scaffolds, and N50. The proportion of

184

MAGs containing each of the rRNA genes was tested using a two-sample z-test in R (R Core

185

Team, 2014).

186
187

The scaffolds from each pair of MAGs that were recovered were aligned using mummer
wrapped within the mummer2circos.py (https://github.com/metagenlab/mummer2circos) script

188

(Kurtz et al., 2004). All nanopore reads > 1 kbp were aligned to a concatenated fasta file of all

189

scaffolds from all the hybrid-generated bins using minimap2 with the “-ax map-ont” flag (Li,

190

2018). Log2 scaled coverage profiles were generated from QAQC Illumina reads for each filter

191

fraction using pileup.sh across 1 kb sized sections from the BBTools suite (Bushnell, 2014),

192

after aligning the reads to the hybrid-bin scaffolds using bbmap.sh and sorting the alignments

193

with samtools (Li et al., 2009). MAGs were taxonomically classified using GTDB-TK v0.3.2,

194

following the classify workflow (Hyatt et al., 2010; Matsen et al., 2010; Price et al., 2010; Eddy,

195

2017; Jain et al., 2018; Parks et al., 2018).

196

The 16S rRNA genes recovered from MAGs were compared using blastn to 97%

197

representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from primer pair 341F/785R (Altschul et al.,

198

1990; Yan et al., 2019). All hits were required to be >98.5 % sequence identity across at least

199

350 bp. In the case of multiple OTUs matching a MAG 16S gene, the highest bit score was

200

used, followed by the most abundant representative OTU. The representative OTUs originated

201

from 101 samples collected between July 2014 and April 2017 from 10 monitoring wells of the

202

hillslope transect (Yan et al., 2019). The figure was created using ggplot2 and the tidyverse

203

package within R (R Core Team, 2014; Wickham et al., 2019).

204

In order to disentangle the improvements in MAG recovery due to longer ONT scaffolds

205

instead of simply having higher sequencing depth, we subsampled the ONT reads into four

206

different sets, then re-ran the SPAdes assemblies and binning steps. As described above, the

207

full hybrid assembly approach was based on 17,660,385 Illumina paired-end sequences (10.6

208

Gbp), and 2,081,879 ONT sequences (11.58 Gbp). The four additional ONT sets were, (1) all

209

nanopore reads >10,000 nt which lead to 349,321 sequences (6.8 Gbp), (2) ONT reads >

210

20,000 nt (114,853 sequences; 3.6 Gbp), (3) ONT reads > 50,000 nt (7,848 sequences; 0.48

211

Gbp), and (4) randomly subsampled to 25% of the initial number of sequences (595,070

212

sequences, 3.15 Gbp). Each of the resulting assemblies were binned and analyzed following

213

the same procedures as above.

214

Viral Comparison
215

We used VirSorter v1.0.5 to search for putative phage and prophage sequences in the

216

assemblies (Roux et al., 2015). To identify the phages that were recovered from both

217

assemblies, we used Blastn v2.9.0+ and filtered the hits by an e-value of 1e-10, a sequence

218

identity >90%, and an alignment length >50% (Altschul et al., 1990).

219

Results and Discussion
220

One of the most striking findings is that the inclusion of long reads more than doubled

221

(74 vs 39) the number of bacterial and archaeal MAGs that were at least 50% complete and

222

less than 10% redundant, as compared to using assemblies generated from only Illumina

223

short-read sequences (Figure 1 A). The 74 MAGs recovered from the hybrid approach were

224

less fragmented with more than 50% having less than 100 scaffolds as compared to ~5% of the

225

Illumina-only MAGs (Figure 1 B). The hybrid MAGs correspondingly exhibited much higher N50

226

values with > 75% of the MAGs having an N50 > 10 kbp as compared to 20% of the

227

Illumina-only MAGs (Figure 1 C). The additional MAGs recovered from the hybrid approach

228

were due to recovering MAGs with lower coverages (minimum 1.9x vs 4.2x) and improved

229

recovery of populations that were close to our quality cutoff values (Figure 1 E).

230

In addition to the bacterial and archaeal MAGs, we identified 278 putative phage

231

sequences (258 phages, 20 prophages) in the hybrid assembly and only 73 (71 phages, 2

232

prophages) in the Illumina-only assembly (Figure 1 F). Remarkably, the number of complete

233

phage contigs of the VirSorter category 1 (confident phage assignment) increased from 7 to 22

234

sequences in the hybrid assembly. Thus, the integration of long-read data into the assembly

235

process helped to recover more potential phage sequences from the sample, as well as an

236

increase in phage sequences that were confidently identified. In one noteworthy case, a

237

category 2 phage sequence (enriched in viral domains) from the Illumina-only assembly (length

238

17,648 nt) was integrated into a much larger prophage contig (category 4; high confidence

239

prophage) within the hybrid assembly (75,806 nt). Of the 73 identified putative phage

240

sequences from the Illumina-only assembly, 52 were also recovered with the hybrid approach.

241

The remaining 21 phage sequences are composed of three category-1, 17 category-2, and a

242

single category-4 prophage. Of those, 19 sequences could be confirmed by an additional blast

243

step to be included in larger contigs of the full hybrid assembly, however, they were not

244

identified by VirSorter within the hybrid assembly.

245

For the bacteria and archaea, every MAG reconstructed from the Illumina-only assembly

246

was also recovered from the hybrid assembly. We performed an in-depth comparison of the 44

247

bacteria and archaea MAGs that were initially recovered with both assemblies (Table S1). On

248

average, the hybrid-assembled MAGs were 7.8% ± 3.1% (mean ± 95% confidence intervals)

249

more complete (adj.p < 1e-5) and exhibited the same degree of redundancy (0.4% ± 0.7%; adj.p

250

= 0.22). In addition, the hybrid MAGs were 358 ± 123 kbp longer (adj.p < 1e-5), with 133 ± 34

251

fewer scaffolds (adj.p < 1e-8), that had 14.1 ± 5.4 kbp greater N50 values (adj.p < 1e-5). There

252

was no significant difference found in the proportion of the rRNA genes between the recovered

253

MAGs (two proportion two-tailed z-test), although the hybrid MAGs had 1 more 5S gene (16 vs.

254

15), 6 more 16S genes (16 vs. 10), and 4 more 23S genes (13 vs. 9). A non-significant result is

255

not discouraging here as even a single extra 16S rRNA gene might allow a dominant population

256

to be connected to an extensive amplicon dataset. In addition, a manual examination of the few

257

Illumina-only MAGs that were more complete than the corresponding hybrid MAG found that the

258

Illumina-only MAGs were likely mixed populations with different coverage profiles across their

259

scaffolds.

260

To see if the improvements in MAG-retrieval were mainly due to the increase in

261

sequencing depth provided by the ONT reads, we subsampled using four different strategies.

262

These ranged from only using ONT reads > 50,000 nt (7,848 sequences; 0.48 Gbp) to all reads

263

> 10,000 nt (349,321; 6.8 Gbp), along with a random subsampling to simulate a less successful

264

sequencing run (595,070 sequences; 3.15 Gbp) (Table S2). The randomly subsampled ONT set

265

yielded 62 MAGs that were > 50% complete and < 10% redundancy (as assessed by checkM),

266

32 more MAGs than the MiSeq assembly alone. Including only the ~8,000 reads that were

267

greater than 50,000 nt resulted in 58 MAGs passing our standards. We interpret these results to

268

show that the longer nanopore reads do help recover MAGs, and a large improvement can be

269

expected even if the ONT run was not so successful, while also acknowledging that the greater

270

sequencing depth alone supplied by the ONT reads partially contributes to these results.

271

The full hybrid assembly recovered MAGs representing 17 phyla, while 14 phyla were

272

represented from the Illumina-only assembly. The missing phyla were Bacteroidota (2 MAGs),

273

Microarchaeota (1), and Verrucomicrobiota (1). The (super)phylum with the greatest

274

improvement in the number of assembled MAGs was the Patescibacteria (formerly the

275

Candidate Phyla Radiation group), with over double (35 vs. 17) the number of MAGs recovered

276

from the hybrid approach that met our criteria (Figure 2). The ONT long-read sequences bridge

277

missing gaps in the Illumina-only MAGs, thereby improving the contiguity and increasing the

278

genome length across fewer scaffolds (Figure 2). It is noteworthy that these benefits are not

279

restricted to only the most abundant organisms and even relatively few long-reads mapping to

280

populations can improve chances to recover them (Figure 2 B). Here we focused on the

12

281

Patescibacteria, since this group contains almost no cultivated representatives and they are

282

often highly abundant in groundwater systems (Brown et al., 2015; Pedron et al., 2019). In

283

addition, previous research from the Hainch CZE has demonstrated that Patescibacteria can

284

represent up to 79% of the groundwater community (Herrmann et al., 2019).

285

A similar visualization was performed for three other dominant bacterial phyla

286

(Nitrospirota, Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria) that had previously been shown to be important

287

in the functioning of the groundwater (Wegner et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2019) (Figure S1). There

288

were almost double the number of Nitrospirota associated MAGs (7 vs. 4) recovered with the

289

hybrid approach, and these were amongst the largest of the MAGs recovered. Within the

290

Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria, we recovered the same MAGs with each approach. The

291

MAG metrics within each phyla fell within the confidence intervals of the full sample set with the

292

exception of the Actinobacteriota that showed greater than expected improvements with the

293

hybrid approach (Figure S1). The results presented herein also likely further underestimate the

294

improvements ONT long reads contribute since the 2x300 bp paired-end sequences used are

295

longer than those typically generated in metagenome projects (either 2x150 reads from an

296

Illumina HiSeq or 2x250 from an Illumina Nextseq).

297

Our results from these diverse and understudied groundwater ecosystems extend

298

findings recently published that utilized mock communities and spiked-in complex human gut

299

microbiome communities (Bertrand et al., 2019). We demonstrate the recovery of a wider

300

diversity of microorganisms and phages using a hybrid approach, in our case, the recovery of

301

three additional phyla and 6 classes. Additionally, the improvements towards contiguity and

302

completeness of recovered MAGs are likely generalizable as they are reflected within the

303

results presented by Bertrand and colleagues (2019). While not explicitly tested in our study, the

304

hybrid approach has been previously shown to result in fewer misassemblies using a mock

305

community where the genome contents are known a priori (Bertrand et al., 2019).

306

High-quality MAGs that are (nearly) complete with lower frequencies of misassemblies

307

allow relevant metabolic processes to be constrained to individual organisms, directly

308

connecting phylogeny to function (Woyke et al., 2019). To help with this task, one of the benefits

309

we document here is that the less fragmented hybrid MAGs contained more ribosomal RNA

310

genes (Figure 1 D). 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets are a common method to survey

311

microbial communities, often with a large number of samples that are well replicated

312

spatiotemporally due to decreases in sequencing costs and ease of multiplexing. Here, MAGs

313

were linked to a 16S dataset containing 101 samples from the Hainich CZE that were collected

314

across 3 years (July 2014 to April 2017) and 10 wells (Yan et al., 2019).

315

Of the 16S hybrid MAGs that mapped to a 16S OTU, four were visualized based on their

316

relative abundance and spatiotemporal distributions throughout the Hainich CZE (Figure 3). The

317

16S sequence from bin49 was full length (1498 bp) and shared 100% identity across the full

318

OTU_31 sequence. The MAG taxonomy (GTDB_TK) was class ABY1 within the

319

Patescibacteria, while the 16S taxonomy (RDP trained with SILVA v.132) was Candidatus

320

Kerfeldbacteria within the same class (Wang et al., 2007; Schloss et al., 2009; Quast et al.,

321

2012; Parks et al., 2018). This population recently showed a large increase in relative

322

abundance starting in Jan 2017 and is localized to well H5-2 within the upper aquifer

323

assemblage, where these metagenomes originated from. Bin19 and bin52 also both contained

324

partial 16S sequences (769 bp, 727 bp respectively) that were 100% identical to corresponding

325

16S OTU sequences. The GTDB_TK taxonomy for bin19 was within the order

326

Peregrinibacterales (Patescibacteria) while bin52 was most similar to the MBNT15 group. One

327

exciting finding was that both these organisms were more relatively abundant in the oxic well

14

328

H4-1 within the lower aquifer assemblage rather than the anoxic well that was used to generate

329

the metagenomes. The last example provided is for a MAG, bin61, within the

330

Thermodesulfovibrionales (Nitrospirota) that shared 99% sequence identity to the most

331

abundant OTU detected across the entire Hainich CZE (mean ± SD relative abundance = 5.9 ±

332

7.6%; max = 32%). This OTU is extremely abundant within the anoxic wells H53 and H52, while

333

also being among the most abundant OTU in the oxic or hypoxic Trochitenkalk formation

334

(moTK; HTL) at times (wells H41 and H51). With these examples, we extend the information

335

provided by a spatially constrained metagenomics project across the entire aquifer assemblage

336

to better explore the potential niches of these abundant organisms.

337

Unlike more traditional, gene-centric based analyzes that provide insights into the sum

338

metabolic repertoire of an ecosystem, a genome-centric approach enables research questions

339

directed towards population niche differentiation, determination of microbial groups that are

340

bioindicators for a specific metabolism, and potential microbial networks and microbial

341

interactions between syntrophs and/or auxotrophs along with the phages that control population

342

sizes and alter or enhance biogeochemical cycling rates (Anantharaman et al., 2016;

343

Howard-Varona et al., 2017). Such an approach further offers insights into the evolutionary

344

history of archaeal, bacterial, or viral groups and the ecological consequences if such groups

345

were to be lost or invade the system. In particular, the identification of novel viruses from

346

metagenomic data and the way they interact with other microbes extends our understanding of

347

complex environmental systems (Roux et al., 2016). As a final consideration, the information

348

contained within high-quality MAGs may offer a road map to cultivation, which in turn allows

349

hypothesis testing and verification of in silico predictions (Cross et al., 2019).

351

Conclusions
352

To improve the recovery of metagenome-assembled-genomes we find that the addition

353

of Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing doubled the number of bacterial

354

and archaeal MAGs, that represented more phylogenetic diversity, and improved all measured

355

quality metrics as compared to an Illumina short-read approach only. In addition, nearly four-fold

356

more putative phage sequences were identified including 10x more putative prophages.

357

Considerations on supplementing Illumina paired-end metagenomic projects with ONT reads

358

include the DNA extraction method used, the total amount of DNA available, and the cleanliness

359

of the extract. The additional amount of hands-on time needed to prepare a sequencing run with

360

the minION is comparably low. The current library preparation time using the revised genomic

361

DNA by ligation kit takes about three hours (including elongated incubation times). Shorter

362

protocols such as the rapid kit are also available by the ONT-community. A sequencing run lasts

363

between 24 and 48 hours, or until no active pores are available anymore and the data can be

364

immediately analyzed depending on the available hardware. There are cost concerns with

365

supplementing an already expensive metagenomic sequencing project with ONT long-read

366

sequences, considering a complete run on one minION flow cell, including library preparation,

367

currently costs 750 € per sample. However, the improvements documented here provide better

368

genome context for both microbial and viral comparative genomic projects, more single marker

369

copy genes for detailed phylogenomic studies, more complete metabolic reconstructions, and

370

an end-product that is more useful to the greater scientific community.

reconstructed from the hybrid assembly (left) and the Illumina-only assembly (right). (A) The
number of MAGs from each method. (B) The number of scaffolds each MAG was represented
by relative to all recovered MAGs. (C) The N50 value for each MAG recovered as a proportion
of all MAGs. (D) The proportion of MAGs containing each of the rRNA genes. (E) The mean
coverage of every MAG that met our quality standards within each approach (points) and their
distributions plotted on a log10 scale. (F) The number of identified phages / prophages in each
assembly as assessed with VirSorter.

retrieved by both assembly methods. The outer ring in blue represents the hybrid assembly
derived scaffolds, followed by the corresponding Illumina assembly scaffolds in grey. The
nanopore reads were mapped with minimap2 and colored based on length. The coverage
values are log2 scaled and calculated for each 1kb segment of the hybrid-derived scaffolds with
pileup.sh from BBTools of the Illumina reads. The values below each plot represent the mean
coverage from the 0.2 µM fraction Illumina MiSeq reads and the 0.1 µM fraction reads,
respectively. The hybrid based genome size is indicated in the middle of each plot.

Figure 3. MAGs containing 16S genes were mapped to the amplicon sequence dataset
presented in Yan et al., using blastn. All matches were > 99% sequence identity across at least
350 bp. The distribution of these OTU was explored throughout the full aquifer system across a
3-year monthly sampling time series. The aquifer is mainly divided into two assemblages, the
upper (moM; HTU) characterized by anoxia, and the lower (moTK; HTL) by oxic and hypoxic
conditions. H52 was the well where the DNA for the metagenomes originated from and is
highlighted with the solid purple. The percent abundance values result from counts that were
normalized with metagenomeseq (Paulson et al., 2013). The mapping information is as follows:
bin.49 (len = 1498 bp; ID = 100%, 404 bp); bin.19 (len = 769, ID = 100%, 405 bp); bin.52 (len =
769, ID = 100%, 405 bp); bin.61 (len = 1403; 99%, 402 bp). All 16S and MAG taxonomic
assignments were consistent.
