Abstract
Patients suffering from autoimmune diseases are more susceptible to mental disorders yet,
the existence of specific cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the co-morbidity of
these pathologies is far from being fully elucidated. By generating transgenic mice
overexpressing Annexin-A1 exclusively in T cells to study its impact in models of
autoimmune diseases, we made the unpredicted observation of an increased level of anxiety.
Gene microarray of Annexin-A1 CD4+ T cells identified a novel anxiogenic factor, a small
protein of approximately 21kDa encoded by the gene 2610019F03Rik which we named
Immuno-moodulin. Neutralizing antibodies against Immuno-moodulin reverted the
behavioral phenotype of Annexin-A1 transgenic mice and lowered the basal levels of
anxiety in wild type mice; moreover, we also found that patients suffering from obsessive
compulsive disorders show high levels of Imood in their peripheral mononuclear cells. We
thus identify this protein as a novel peripheral determinant that modulates anxiety behavior.
Therapies targeting Immuno-moodulin may lead to a new type of treatment for mental
disorders through regulation of the functions of the immune system, rather than directly
acting on the nervous system.

The challenging life of patients diagnosed with autoimmune diseases is often further
impoverished by the emergence of mental disorders as a major co-morbidity 1,2. For
instance, ~40% of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis have attempted suicide 3,4 while
more than 30% of those affected by autoimmune hepatitis suffer from schizophrenia 5,6.
Most strikingly, immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of autoimmune conditions
might aggravate the emergence of these problems 7 thus presenting both clinicians and
patients with a paradoxical dilemma: the physical symptoms of autoimmunity might be
effectively improved at the expenses of a worsening of the emotional state and wellbeing.
This is for instance the case of interferon beta (IFN-b) that is currently used as an effective
treatment for multiple sclerosis but its use is limited by the increased incidence of suicidal
thoughts in a significant proportion of patients 8. Although some studies have investigated
the functional cross-talk between the brain and the immune system9,10, it is still not clear
how one system influences the other and if there is a common root or determinant for the
emergence of mental disorders in autoimmune conditions.
Annexin-A1 (AnxA1) is an endogenous modulator of a variety of physiological and
pathological processes ranging from inflammation 11,12 to autoimmunity 13,14 and cancer 1517
. As with many other multifunctional mediators, AnxA1 plays a homeostatic role in the
immune system as it can exert both positive and negative functions depending on the
contexts. In the context of T cells, studies have indeed provided contrasting and opposite
results showing that it can act as both a positive 18-27 and a negative modulator of T cell
activation 27-30. All these studies have been done using either exogenously administered
recombinant AnxA1 (and its mimetic) or AnxA1-deficient mice where the protein is absent
in every immune cell. Aiming to address these controversies, we have generated a T cell
specific AnxA1 transgenic mouse colony (AnxA1tg ) to address the biology of this mediator.
In this paper, analysis of AnxA1tg response in experimental model of autoimmunity showed
exacerbated signs of inflammation. However, besides their autoimmune-prone phenotype,
AnxA1tg mice displayed an unexpected high level of compulsive digging that was noticeable
even in their home cage and at basal physiological settings e.g. in mice that were not
subjected to any inflammatory condition. Further exploration on the molecular mechanisms
behind this phenotype of anxiety led us to the discovery of a new homeostatic modulator
that we named Immuno-moodulin (Imood) - because of its discovery in T cells. Immunomoodulin levels in mice affect their intrinsic basal level of anxiety. In addition, we found
that patients suffering from OCD present high levels of Imood in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. The results of this study expand our knowledge of the complex
interactions and intersection between the immune and the central nervous system.
Materials and Methods
Generation of T cell-specific AnxA1tg mice
To generate the VACD2 AnxA1 FLAG transgenic mice, murine AnxA1 gene was extracted,
amplified and tagged with the FLAG epitope. The gene was cloned in TOPO pcDNA3.1
vector for verification of its expression in vitro and finally subcloned in the VACD2 vector
31
for T cell specific expression in the mouse. Finally, the VACD2 AnxA1 FLAG construct
was modified and purified for the pronuclear microinjection into the mouse genome.
Subjects
20 OCD outpatients of either gender and any age, treated and followed up at the OCD
tertiary outpatient Clinic of the University Department of Psychiatry of Milan, Policlinico

Hospital, were included in the study. Diagnoses were assessed by the administration of a
semi-structured interview based on DSM-5 criteria (SCID 5 research version, RV). In case
of psychiatric comorbidity, OCD had to be the primary disorder, causing the most
significant distress and dysfunction and providing the primary motivation to seek treatment.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had recent or current alcohol or substance
abuse (last 3 months), as well as medical conditions including autoimmune diseases, due to
their potential influence over gene expression. For the same reason, lifetime history of
trauma (according to DSM-5), as well as the current presence of relevant psychological
stress, were considered exclusion criteria. Clinical assessment included the collection of the
following demographic and clinical variables: gender, age, age at onset, and current
pharmacological treatment. In addition, illness severity was measured through the YaleBrown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Patients had maintained their pharmacological
treatment stable for at least one month in order to be enrolled in the study and on the day of
collection of blood. Control subjects (n = 20) were volunteers matched for gender, age and
ethnicity, with no psychiatric diagnosis as determined by the SCID 5 and no positive family
history for major psychiatric disorders in the first-degree relatives (as assessed by the Family
Interview for Genetic Studies). Blood collection was performed between 2 and 4 pm from
not fasting donors. PBMCs were separated by density gradient using the Lympholyte-H kit
as recommended by the manufacturer (Cedarlane Laboratories, Canada). All subjects had
given their written informed consent to participate to the study, which included the use of
personal and clinical data as well as blood drawing for genotyping and methylation analysis.
The study protocol had been previously approved by the local Ethics Committee.
Results
Generation and phenotypic characterization of T cell specific AnxA1tg mice
We generated T cell specific transgenic mice through pronuclear injection of VACD2
AnxA1 FLAG construct in 129 FVB mice (Supplementary Figure 1). Both the two
founders and their litters showed no gross sign of disease. Following backcrossing onto
C57BL/6 background and intercross to generate mice with the transgene on both alleles, we
noticed that the female litters from one of the two transgenic founders presented an unusual
high incidence (almost 80%) of maternal cannibalism. This was successfully controlled by
administering perphenazine (0.025 mg/ml in drinking water) during pregnancy as it has
been previously reported for other autoimmune prone and highly anxious mouse strains such
as the DBA/2J 32. Rescued newborn pups from this line (called ‘the red line’) had often to
be raised by C57BL/6 foster mothers to avoid losing the colony. The combined
administration of perphenazine and fostering care, made this line challenging to use.
Therefore, unless otherwise stated, all the experiments were carried out using the litters of
the other founder. Analysis of the immune repertoire of AnxA1tg mice from both founders
showed no significant differences in lineage commitment towards CD4+ or CD8+ cells in
all lymphoid organs (Supplementary Figure 2A). To assess if AnxA1 overexpression in T
cells would have any effects on the cellularity of the lymphoid organs we measured the total
cell number of cells present in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus of AnxA1tg mice compared
to control. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2B, no significant changes were found
except in in lymph nodes where the cellularity was significantly higher (by about 60%) in
AnxA1tg mice compared to control.
Increased T cell activation and autoimmunity in AnxA1tg mice
Consistent with our previous reports 19,20,22,23, AnxA1tg T cells showed a clear proinflammatory phenotype as evidenced by lower threshold of CD25 and CD69 upregulation

(Figure 1A) and increased production of IL-2 following anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (antiCD3/CD28) stimulation (Figure 1B). In vivo, AnxA1tg mice showed an exacerbated
inflammatory response in the MOG35-55-induced experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Figure 1C) as evidenced by the exacerbated severity of the
clinical score and increased weight loss after the onset of the disease (day 12) and larger
inflammatory infiltrate of the spinal cord in AnxA1tg mice compared to wild type. No
differences were observed in terms of disease incidence between control and AnxA1tg mice
(Table in Figure 1C). The same exacerbated inflammatory response was observed and
confirmed in the red line mice (Supplementary Figure 3A). To expand and confirm these
findings in another model of autoimmune inflammation, we subjected AnxA1tg mice to an
experimental model of systemic lupus erythematosus 33. As shown in Figure 1D (right
panel), injection of pristane to AnxA1tg mice provoked a significant weight loss over a
period of 35 days while control mice gained about 30% of their initial weight over the same
period. As the disease progresses, a number of organs, including the spleen and the lung,
becomes enlarged or accumulate inflammatory infiltrate 34,35. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 4A, AnxA1tg mice showed increased splenomegaly (spleen weight 0.130± 0.010 gr
in wild type mice vs 0.281± 0.011 gr in AnxA1tg; n=5 mice, p<0.0001) with typical
pathological features such as enlarged B-cell follicles and infiltration of oil droplets
compared to control wild type mice. The lungs of AnxA1tg mice also showed increased
areas of focal hemorrhages together with severe mixed inflammatory infiltrate compared to
control (Supplementary Figure 4B). Consistent with these results, ~ 30% of AnxA1tg mice
died during the 35-day treatment while control animals showed a 100% survival (Figure
1D; left panel).
Selective accumulation of Th1/Th17 double positive cells in the inflamed tissue of
AnxA1tg mice
To further examine the activation state of AnxA1tg T cells in the EAE mice, we investigated
the effector phenotype of these cells at day 9 (onset of the disease) and day 16 (peak of the
disease). This allowed us to distinguish the effects of AnxA1 overexpression during the
priming phase occurring in the draining lymph nodes at day 9 or the differentiation phase
occurring within the spinal cord at day 16 36. Comparison of the total cell number of CD45+
leukocytes in either lymph node or spinal cord of AnxA1tg and wild type mice showed no
significant differences (Figure 2A and B, bottom panels). Day 9 comparison of the
draining lymph nodes of control and AnxA1tg mice showed a significant increase in the
number of CD4+ T cells (by about 85%) in the latter group, but no difference in the
percentage of IL-17+/IFN-g+ or IL-17+/GM-CSF+ double-positive or single-positive T cells
(Figure 2A). At day 16, the number of CD4+ T cells recovered from the spinal cord of was
~3-fold higher in AnxA1tg compared to control but in this case we observed an increase in
the percentages of IFN-g+/IL-17+ (1.9 ± 0.12% in wild type vs 4.5 ± 0.21% in AnxA1tg;
p<0.0001) or GM-CSF+/IL-17+ (4.8 ± 0.19% in wild type vs 10.4 ± 0.45% in AnxA1tg;
p<0.0001) pathogenic 37 double-positive T cells in the former compared to the latter (Figure
2B). Fate mapping reporter studies for Th17 cells in this model of autoimmune
inflammation have shown that these double-positive cells represent a transition phase during
the ‘conversion’ of IL-17 single-positive into IFN-g or GM-CSF double-positive T cells at
the site of inflammation 38. Consistent with these findings, AnxA1tg mice show a higher
percentage of IL-17+ cells and a corresponded reduced percentage of IFN-g (about 10% in
AnxA1tg vs 18 % in control) and GM-CSF (about 16 % in AnxA1tg vs 20% in control)
single-positive cells (Figure 2B).

Direct observation of AnxA1tg mice in their cage revealed an altered behavior typified by
an increased tendency to compulsive digging (compare Movie 1, wild type mice and Movie
2, AnxA1tg mice). Similar behavior was observed in the litters from the other founder (red
line mice; compare Movie 3 of wild type mice with Movie 4 of AnxA1tg mice).
Interestingly, the litter of red line mice also showed an increased level of hetero-barbering
(plucking of fur from cage-mates; Movie 5) - a behavior that has been proposed to represent
a model of human trichotillomania and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders39.
To thoroughly measure this heightened anxious behavior, we used a battery of classical tests
for anxiety behavior. The marble-burying test is used to measure digging 40 and when
applied to AnxA1tg we quantified a significant increase in the number of buried marbles by
the mice, which spent approximately double the time on this activity (Figure 3A). In the
light and dark shuttle box test 41 AnxA1tg mice spent in the lit area than the wild type
counterpart, with a marked attenuation of numbers of crossings between the two
compartments (Figure 3B). Significant behavioral differences were observed also in the
climbing test- an experimental paradigm to measure vertical activity 42: AnxA1tg mice
showed an increased latency to the first climb and a significant reduction in the time spent
on this activity (Figure 3C). All these changes were not secondary to a general impairment
of locomotor activity as AnxA1tg mice showed no difference in the number of i) square
crossed or ii) rearing as quantified in the open field test 43 when compared to wild type
animals (Figure 3D). This heightened anxiety-like behavior was confirmed in the litters of
the red line mice (Supplementary Figure 3B).
Gene fingerprint of AnxA1tg whole brain reveals an increased expression of anxietyrelated genes
CD4+ T cells exert a homeostatic control over a number of functions of the brain including
learning, memory and anxiety-like behavior 44. In a previous study we have shown that
CD4+ rather than CD8+ T cells revert the increased anxiety-like behavior observed in Rag1-/- immunodeficient mice. Most interestingly, we have shown that the modulatory effects
exerted by CD4+ T cells on behavior were ‘mirrored’ by specific changes in the gene
fingerprint of the whole brain 45. Thus, for instance, S100a10, a known biomarker for
anxiety-like behavior, was up-regulated in RAG-1-/- and down-regulated to wild type level
in RAG-1-/- mice where CD4+ T cells artificially re-introduced (RAG-1-/-/OT-II TCR
transgenic mice). In light of these premises, we queried if AnxA1tg mice would also show
changes in their brain gene fingerprint and performed a comparative analysis of gene
expression of the whole brain using microarray analysis. The results showed significant
differences in the level of expression of 15 genes of which 8 were unregulated and 7
downregulated in the whole brains of AnxA1tg mice in comparison to those of wild type
mice (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 1). Among these, several were associated with
emotional disorders including alcoholism and anxiety such as erythroid differentiation
regulator 1 (Erdr1) 46 and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 (Gabra2) 47
(Figure 4B) RT-PCR analysis of these genes on a larger number of samples confirmed these
results with a down regulation of Erdr1 by about 78% and an ~3-fold upregulation of Gabra
2 (Figure 4C). Thus, the transgenic T cells can exert a tonic regulation on a discrete set of
genes in the brain, even in the absence of any experimental manipulation.
AnxA1tg CD4+ T cells express high level of a new anxiogenic factor named Immunomoodulin
To identify the anxiogenic factor produced by AnxA1tg CD4+ T cells, we compared gene
expression profiles of purified CD4+ T cells by microarray. In resting conditions, no

statistical differences were observed between AnxA1tg and control CD4+ T cells (data not
shown). However, in anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated cells, 8 genes were identified to be
significantly modulated (Supplementary Table 2). Among those upregulated, AnxA1,
interferon-inducible 203 and 2610019F03Rik (also called testis development related
protein, Tdrp or C8orf42). We were intrigued by the last one as it encoded for a small protein
of about 21kDa (like most of the cytokines) that was stored in vesicles
(https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180190-TDRP/cell) and present in circulation
(https://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/v3/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TDRP)
and
therefore
decided to investigate its function. As we identified this gene in T cells and hypothesized
that would be responsible for the anxious behavioral phenotype of AnxA1tg mice, we named
it Immuno-moodulin (Imood).
Next, we validated microarray results using immunoblotting and FACS intracellular
staining of CD4+ T cells using a commercially available polyclonal antibody against Imood.
We first investigated Imood expression in resting or activated T cells from non-transgenic
C57BL/6 mice. In basal conditions, about 20% of cells express high levels of Imood.
Activation of CD4+ T cells via the TCR caused a clear increase in the number of these cells
with a doubling of their number (44%) following the triggering of both signal 1 (anti-CD3)
and signal 2 (anti-CD28) (Figure 5 A). When we compared the expression of Imood in
resting wild type and AnxA1tg CD4+ T cells (Figure 5 B), it was possible to see an increase
in the percentages of Imood-high cells in AnxA1tg mice compared to wild type (about 55%
in AnxA1tg vs 35% in wild type) and their median fluorescence intensity (about 15 in
AnxA1tg vs 7 in wild type). These differences tapered off but remained visible following
activation with anti-CD3/CD28: about 80% of AnxA1tg cells expressed Imood with a
median fluorescence intensity of 26 while about 70% wild type cells showed a median of
18. These results were confirmed at mRNA levels where it was possible to observe both the
upregulation of Imood mRNA following activation of T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 and an
increased expression in AnxA1tg compared to wild type in both resting and stimulating
conditions (Figure 5 C). We confirmed these findings by western blot. Resting AnxA1tg
CD4+ T cells showed increased levels of intracellular Imood compared to control (Figure
6D, Top panel). In addition, immunoprecipitation of Imood from the cell supernatant of wild
type and AnxA1tg T cells in both resting and activated conditions showed an increased
secretion of this protein in AnxA1tg T cells (Figure 5 D, bottom panel).
To explore the possible role of Imood in regulating anxiety behavior we administered the
recombinant product of this gene (https://www.origene.com; Recombinant protein of
human chromosome 8 open reading frame 42 [C8orf42], catalogue number TP313199) into
wild type C57BL/6 mice. In all the experiments that followed, we used the light-dark shuttle
box as a convenient screening test since this showed the highest difference between AnxA1tg
and wild type mice. As shown in Supplementary Figure 5, mice injected with 500ng of the
intact (r-Imood) but not the denatured (95°C for 5min) protein (d-Imood) or PBS showed a
significant increase in anxiety-like behavior. This change did not occur within hours of
administration but started to be noticeable at day 3 post-injection (data not shown) and
became highly significant at day 7. To confirm that Imood was indeed responsible for the
increased anxiety-like behavior of AnxA1tg mice, we administered a commercially available
polyclonal antibody against this protein (https://www.novusbio.com/; catalogue number
NBP1-93675) and control IgG to these mice. We also administered the same dose of
antibodies and control IgG to wild type C57BL/6 to test its effect in control mice. As shown
in Supplementary Figure 6, only AnxA1tg mice that received the polyclonal anti-Imood
antibodies but not those receiving the control IgG showed a significant increase of the time

in the light (by ~249%; p<0.001) and number of crossing (by ~194%; p<0.001).
Interestingly, administration of the same antibody in wild type C57BL/6 mice also caused
a significant increase in time in the light (by ~24%; p<0.05) and number of crossing (by
~76%; p<0.01) suggesting there may be an endogenous Imood level which might regulate
basal anxiety behavior of mice.
To further validate our hypothesis and increase specificity of action, we generated
monoclonal antibodies against Imood using genetic immunization48 (Supplementary
Figure 7). Congruent with previous data, administration of highly selective purified
monoclonal anti-Imood antibodies 1B10 or 1C4 to AnxA1tg significantly increased the
number of crossing (by ~123%, p<0.01 for 1C4; by ~178%, p<0.001 for 1B10) and the time
in the light (by ~208%, p<0.01 for 1C4; by ~396%, p<0.001 for 1B10) compared to IgG
control. Thus, anti-Imood therapy rescues the phenotype of AnxA1tg back to that of wild
type mice.
Similar to what we observed with the polyclonal antibody, C57BL6 control mice
administered with 1B10 and 1C4 showed significant increase in time in the light (by ~75%,
p<0.01 for 1C4; by ~86%, p<0.001 for 1B10) and number of crossings (by ~41%, p<0.05
for 1C4; by ~68%, p<0.001 for 1B10). Collectively this data reveals Imood as an innovative
target for therapeutic strategies to treat anxiety behavior in mice (Figure 6A).
Increased expression of Imood in OCD patients
Finally, we searched for Imood expression in man. To this aim, we performed an initial
retrospective screening of cDNA samples of PBMC obtained from obtained from 20
patients that have been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders and 20 healthy
controls. Both sociodemographic (gender, education, employment and marital status) and
clinical (duration of illness, duration of untreated illness, family history of psychiatric
disorders, psychiatric comorbidity and current treatments) variables have been reported in
Supplementary Table 3. As shown in Figure 6B, Imood expression was significantly
higher (approximately 6-fold) than controls in both male and female subjects.
Discussion
A growing number of studies support the hypothesis that mood disorders can be driven by
cellular and biochemical events that are rooted in the immune system 10,49,50. This evidence
emerged from several experimental studies investigating how both the depletion of T cells
in mice 51,52 or the repopulation of lymphopenic mice with T cells alter brain functions
including cognitions 53,54, fear 55 and emotional states 45,56. Thus, in a study by Clark et al.,
CD4+ T cells conferred anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in Rag-2-/- mice 57. Using
similar approaches, Scheinert et al. and Brachman et al. have shown that adoptive transfer
of lymph node cells from chronically stressed mice were able to revert the anxious and
depressive-like behavior of Rag-2-/- mice 58,59.
The modulatory effect of T cells on behavior has also been explored using effector disease
relevant T cells. Seminal studies by Beurel and Jope have shown that the number of effector
Th17 cells was significantly higher in the brain of mice exhibiting depressive-like behavior
or in mice subjected to chronic restraint stress 60-62. In line with the studies mentioned above,
the same group has shown that adoptively transferred Th17 cells in Rag-2-/- mice
accumulated in the hippocampus of learned-helpless mice 61 and induced endogenous Th17
cell differentiation 60. This work has provided key evidence that autoimmune effector T cells
play a fundamental role in regulating pathological processes other than autoimmunity. In

the context of this study, these findings have laid the foundations for a further exploration
of the possible mechanisms linking autoimmunity and mental disorders. In addition, the lack
of novel therapeutic opportunities to treat mental health issues is very topical and we reason
that detailed investigation of the mechanism(s) linking the immune system with behavioral
responses could guide the development of new therapies.
We reasoned about the existence of novel mechanism and plausibly un-identified factors
while noting the behavioral phenotype of mice which single anomaly was higher expression
of AnxA1 in T cells. This transgenic tool was generated to further investigate the specific
properties of this mediator on the adaptive immune response 14,22,23. In retrospective, our
novel observations are aligned with the emerging notion that AnxA1 can regulate mental
disorders. Genome-Wide Association Studies searches (GWAS Central at
www.gwascentral.org) for AnxA1 reported about 62 studies on this protein and many of
them on mental disorders. In fact, reports have shown a significant association between
AnxA1 gene duplication and autism63 or single nucleotide polymorphism in AnxA1 gene
and schizophrenia64, bipolar disorder or depression65. Most intriguingly, all these conditions
have been often linked to immune dysfunctions or inflammatory conditions 66-68.
Moreover, AnxA1 is a ligand for the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) 69-71. These prototype
sensors of the innate immune system were initially identified as the cellular antenna for the
capture of formylated peptides released by bacterial pathogens 72-75. Of interest, studies have
shown that these receptors have more than one way to help the host sensing the danger.
Their expression in the olfactory system allow mice to ‘sense’ the presence of infectionassociated olfactory cues thus allowing animals to move away from the source of infection
76-78
. Other lines of evidence support a role for FPR in regulating behaviour. Studies in knock
out mice for both FPR1 and FPR2/ALX receptors have shown a significant reduction in
anxiety 79,80 e.g. the opposite phenotype of AnxA1tg mice. Putting everything together, FPR
may represent a prototype of signalling molecules that influence the behaviour of the host
at both cellular and physical levels with the ultimate goal of preserving it from the
challenges of the external environments 81.
The anxiolytic effects of antibodies against Imood required days to be visible and
statistically significant. A similarly delayed response was observed with recombinant Imood
suggesting, in both cases, a downstream regulation of the expression of genes associated to
anxiety rather than influencing directly the effects of neurotransmitters in the brain.
The time-lag effect for the emergence of modulatory effects on anxiety, with AnxA1tg cells
or following the administration of Imood, resonates well with the notion that classical drugs
for the treatment of depression and anxiety present a delayed onset of 5 to 7 days for their
clinical efficacy to be apparent 82. Recent studies have put forward the proposition that
delayed onset could be linked to the time needed for the immune system to respond and/or
adapt to the administration of these drugs83, reinforcing the hypothesis that the immune
system regulates the emotional state via a homeostatic control of the expression of genes
with direct effect on emotions.
This study opens a number of interesting and challenging questions that needs to be
addressed to provide a full picture of how Imood might ultimately influence behavior. First
of all, we would need to establish how Imood would enter the brain and what would be its
receptor(s). Paradigm-shifting work by Kipnis and collaborators have very recently ascribed
the meningeal lymphatic as “a system capable of carrying fluid, immune cells, and

macromolecules from the central nervous system” 84. This system has been proposed as the
vascular network that allows the circulation and exchange of soluble contents between the
brain cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid 85,86 and could be therefore the entry door for
Imood in the CNS. Another interesting perspective would be the existence of an Imoodspecific mechanics of transport present in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and in
endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier like in the case of leptin 87. One surprising finding
of our study is the existence of a small percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of
Imood (Figure 5) and the increased number of these cells in the AnxA1tg mice. It is tempting
to speculate that these Imood-high cells could specifically recirculate through the brain and
thus be directly involved in the regulation of brain gene expression profile. This would be
particularly intriguing as we have observed a readily upregulation of this protein following
TCR stimulation. The constitutive activation state of autoimmune T cells might justify, at
least in part, the increased incidence of mental disorders in patients suffering these diseases.
All these hypotheses could only be validated through systematic screening for Imood
expression at both protein and mRNA levels in a large cohort of patients, with different
types of mental disorders as well.
The possibility that Imood could represent a novel fine tuner of mental disorders would also
offer the opportunity to have a novel biomarker of prognostic and diagnostic value. This
would enable patient stratification for the correct mental disorder (e.g. those associated with
an immune component) or identification of the right patient subgroup for specific drug
treatment. As such, for those with higher expression of Imood, a combinatorial therapy with
immunomodulators and Imood neutralizing antibodies like 1B10 might provide the unique
opportunity to achieve a ‘healthy body in a healthy mind’. Along these lines, the
identification of a protein mediator of emotional behavior and the availability of biological
therapies that modulate its levels would represent a significant step forward for the treatment
of mental disorders. Indeed, a biologic for the treatment of mental disorder would bypass
several of the side effects associated with the daily administration of standard therapies
mental disorders 88-90 as it would specifically act at the level of immune system rather than
the CNS.

summery of the study showing how physiological levels of both AnxA1 and Imood
play a homeostatic role regulating host immune response and emotional wellbeing.
T cell activation causes the release of AnxA1 and the externalization of its receptor
FPR. This signaling pathway integrates with the TCR and contributes to the
regulation of the strength of TCR signaling and the level of T cell activation.
Activated T cells express higher levels of Imood. The release of this protein by T
cells contribute to a physiological state of lower mood that is similar to the sickness
behavior observed following an infection. The increased level of expression of
AnxA1 in T cells observed in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases is
responsible for the lower threshold of T cell activation and the increased expression
of Imood. The increased release of this protein in circulation leads to a state of higher
anxiety and depression that is often observed in patients suffering from autoimmune
conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS
Reagents
Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. For the convenience
of the readers all the antibodies used in the study have been reported in Table 4 as well as
in the figure legends.
Animals and husbandry
Wild type C57BL/6J (B6-CD45.2) and B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (B6-CD45.1) were
purchased from Charles River. AnxA1tg mice were generated in the in-house transgenic
mouse facility of Queen Mary University of London by pronuclear injection.
Mice were housed in groups of 6 per cage under specific-pathogen-free conditions and with
free access to food and water. Mice were housed for at least 7 days prior to testing. All
experiments were performed during the light phase of the light-dark cycle and no more than
2 tests per day were performed. The results presented in this manuscript were obtained using
male mice (6-8 weeks old) because - unlike in humans - both the intensity and incidence of
inflammatory/autoimmune disease are more pronounced in male mice. However, the
difference we observed in terms of both immune response and behavioral changes were
confirmed and reproducible in female mice (data not shown). All tests were conducted under
license from the Home Office and according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act,
1986. All experiments were approved and performed under the guidelines of the Ethical
Committee for the Use of Animals, Bart’s and The London School of Medicine and Home
Office Regulations (57) (PPL 80/8714).
To monitory the transgenic colony, genomic DNA were extracted from ear clips by using
REDExtract N-AMP –XNAT kit (Sigma, UK) and analysed by PCR with the following
specific primers for AnxA1tg: forward primer 5’-GTATGGAATCTCTCTTTGCCAAGC3’; reverse primer is 5’-ACHGATATGCACATCAGGAGGG-3’ (Thermo Scientific, UK).
The parameters of the PCR reactions are: initial denaturation at 94ºC for 3min followed by
30 cycles of denaturation at 94ºC for 45sec, annealing at 60ºC for45sec and extension time
at 72ºC for 15sec, and afterwards a final extension step at 72ºC for 7 min.
All the behavioral tests were video-recorded and analyzed double-blind during the light
phase of the light-dark cycle, as previously described91. The scoring and analysis of the data
was hand-made by at least 2 blinded independent experimenters. All the efforts were made
to minimize mouse discomfort in these behavioral experiments. Mice were brought to the
testing room at least 30 minutes before the start of the test session to allow habituation to
the testing environment. All behavioral equipment was thoroughly cleaned and sanitized at
the end of the day and in between tests. Unless otherwise specified, standard lighting (about
50 lux) and quiet conditions were maintained throughout each experiment.
Flow cytometric analysis
Single cell suspension of thymocytes or lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes were
obtained as previously described 19,45. Briefly, tissues were gently desegregated in RPMI
medium supplemented with 100U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (PAA laboratories,
Buckinghamshire, UK) using a 70µm mesh cell strainer (Falcon, UK) and the piston of a
5ml syringe. Cell suspensions from spleen and lymph nodes were layered onto Histopaque1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, England) in a ratio 3:1 and centrifuged at 400g for 10 mins

to isolate mononuclear cells. The resulting buffy coat was collected and washed twice with
RPMI supplemented with 100U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (PAA laboratories,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and then suspended in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline
containing 5% fetal calf serum and 0.02% of NaN2) for further analysis. Thymocytes were
washed twice with RPMI supplemented with 100U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (PAA
laboratories, Buckinghamshire, UK) and then suspended in FACS buffer. Aliquots of cell
suspensions were used to evaluate the total number of cells using a standard
hematocytometer. Cells were stained in 100 µl of FACS buffer containing the following
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD4 (clone GK 1.5),
anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7) (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were labeled
with the appropriate concentration of conjugated antibodies for 1 h at 4°C. After labeling,
cells were washed and analyzed using FACScalibur flow cytometer. Results were analyzed
using the FlowJoTM software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA, Oregon Corporation).
T cell activation assay
Lymph node T cells (1x105 cells/200 µl) were incubated with medium alone or stimulated
by plate-bound anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11; eBioscience) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51;
eBioscience) for 24 hours in 96-well plates. For CD25 and CD69 upregulation, lymph node
T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 as indicated in the figure.
After 16 hours, the cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD69 (clone H1.2F3) and
FITC-conjugated anti-CD25 (clone PC61.5) diluted in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1%
FCS and 0.02% NaN2). The polyclonal antibody against Tdrp (Imood) was purchased from
Novusbio (catalogue number NBP1-93675). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG from Abcam (catalogue number ab150077). Intact cells
were gated by using forward and side scatter and analyzed with the FlowJoTM software
(Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA, Oregon Corporation). IL-2 production was measured after
24 or 48 hr of stimulation using a standard ELISA kit and according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (eBioscience).
Intracellular staining and cytometric bead assay
Th cell phenotype was studied by intracellular staining. Lymphocytes were isolated from
MOG35-55 immunized mice from peripheral lymphoid organs and spinal cord. Lymphocytes
(10x106 cells/ml) from lymph nodes and spleen were cultured for 72 hours with either
medium alone (CTRL) or with anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11; eBioscience) and anti-CD28
(clone 37.51; eBioscience) antibodies (1µg/ml; plate bound) or with the specific antigen
MOG35-55 (100µg/ml). At third day, the cells were pelleted and the supernatants stored at 20ºC. Subsequently, the cells were re-challenged with concanavalin A (ConA, 5µg/ml;
Sigma) in presence of protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A (1:1000; eBioscience) for 4
hours. Mononuclear cells isolated from the spinal cords instead were directly triggered with
ConA and Brefeldin A after collection.
Cells were pelleted and then stained for CD4 (clone GK 1.5; eBioscience) for half an hour
and fixed with 1% PFA for 10 minutes. Thereafter, cells were permeabilized and stained for
30 min in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) containing conjugated antibodies (all from
eBioscience) for cytokines (dil: 1:250) such as IFNγ (clone XMG1.2), IL-17 (eBioTC1118H10.1), GM-CSF (clone MP1-22E9) and IL-10 (clone JES5-16E3). Finally, cells were
washed and suspended in FACS buffer for flow cytometer analysis.

Cytokine production was measured by bead-based analytic assay in flow cytometry. We
used a custom-designed Mouse Th1/Th2/ Th17 /Th22 13plex kits supplemented with
antibody-bounded beads for GM-SCF and IL-23 (eBioscience). Each sample (25µl of cell
culture supernatant) was incubated with 50µl bead mixture and 50µl mix of antibodies
conjugated with biotin for 2h. After two washes, streptavidin PE conjugated antibodies was
added and samples were let rocking for 1 hour in dark. Finally, samples were washed and
stored overnight at 4ºC. Standards diluted serially for 7 times were prepared and processed
at the same time. Samples were analysed using a BD LSR Fortessa using the following
voltage settings: FSC 444, SSC 250, YG-585/15 channel 430, R-670/14 channel 400.
Histology
Intact spinal cords were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 72 h and then incubated
with decalcifying solution containing EDTA (0.1 mM in PBS) for 14 days prior to paraffin
embedding. Tissues sections (5 µm) were deparaffinized with xylene and stained with
hematoxylin
and
eosin
(H&E)
by
our
in-house
histology
facility
(https://www.bci.qmul.ac.uk/en/research/lab-facilities/pathology). Photos of the sections
were acquired using an Olympus BX61 available at the in-house pathology facility. In all
cases, a minimum of three sections per animal was evaluated. Phase-contrast digital images
were taken using the Image Image-Pro (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA) analysis
software package.
MOG35-55-induced Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis
Male C57BL/6 mice received an intradermal injection of 300 µg of MOG35-55
(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK, synthetized by Cambridge Research Biochemicals,
UK; Cambridge Research Biochemicals) emulsified in Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA;
Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, England) and two doses of 500ng of pertussis toxin (PTX; SigmaAldrich, Dorset, England) at day zero and day two as previously reported 20. The severity
of the disease was scored on a scale of 0 to 6 with 0= no neurological signs, 1=tail weakness,
2= tail paralysis, 3= loss of righting reflex (the mouse can no longer right themselves after
being laid on their back), 4= hind leg paralysis, 5= quadriplegia and 6= death.
Leukocytes isolation from central nervous system
Vertebral columns were dissected from the lumbar to the cervical region and washed several
times in PBS to remove blood trace. Spinal cords were extracted by hydro pressure in the
spinal canal by using a 2ml syringe and 19-gauge needle. Subsequently, tissues were torn
apart in sterile PBS by mechanical pressure through a 70µm mesh cell strainer (Falcon).
Mononuclear cells and lymphocytes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation in
Percoll (GE Healthcare). In detail, cells were pelleted at 400xg for 5 min and suspended in
a 30% Percoll solution. The 30% Percoll solution was carefully layered onto a 70% Percoll
solution in a ratio 1:2 and centrifuged at 500xg for 30 min. In this density gradient
mononuclear cells sediment at the interface between 30% and 70% Percoll layers. About 23ml of interface solution was collected only after the fatty layer at the top of the centrifuge
tube was carefully removed. The purified mononuclear cells were washed twice in RPMI
supplemented with 100U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin and 10% of FCS (Invitrogen).
Pristane-induced lupus
Wild type or AnxA1tg male mice received received a single 0.5 ml i.p. injection of sterile
pristane (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Weight was recorded every other day or
every 3 days for over 5 weeks. In some experiments, mice were culled after 4 weeks and

the spleen and lung collected for histological analysis. The weight of the spleen was also
measured to compare the level of splenomegaly between wild type or AnxA1tg.
Digging and marble-burying tests
Marble-burying and digging tests were carried out as described previously 80 with some
modifications. Briefly, mice were individually placed in a clear plastic box (48cm x 39cm
x 31cm) filled with approximately 5-cm-deep wood chip bedding lightly pressed to give a
flat surface. The same bedding substrate was used for all the mice and flattened after each
test. Twenty glass marbles were placed on the surface in five rows of 4 marbles each. The
latency to start digging, the number of digging bouts and the number of buried marbles (to
2/3 their depth) were recorded during the 10 min test.
Climbing activity test
The climbing test is used to assess vertical activity and exploratory behavior. The test was
performed as previously described 80. Briefly, mice were placed, one at a time, on a thin
layer of fresh wood chip bedding on a laboratory bench and covered with a cylindrical
climbing mesh (60 cm x 30 cm base diameter). They were each observed and recorded for
5 minutes. The number of climbing events and total duration of climbing activity was
assessed. The criterion for climbing was for a mouse to have all 4 feet on the wire mesh
while a climb terminated as soon as one foot touched the bench. This test was conducted in
the late afternoon, when mice are known to be more active.
Light-dark shuttle box
In this test exploratory activity reflects the combination of hazard and risk avoidance 41. The
apparatus consisted of a 45cm x 20 cm x 21 cm box, divided into two distinct compartments:
one third (15 cm long) painted black, with a black lid on top, the remaining two thirds
painted white and uncovered. A 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm opening joined the two compartments. One
side of the bright box was transparent to enable behavioral assessment and the averseness
of this compartment was increased by additional illumination supplied by a 50 W lamp
placed 45 cm above the centre of the box floor. The test was performed in accordance with
a previous published protocol 41. Each mouse was placed in the bright compartment, facing
away from the opening and allowed to explore the box for 5 minutes. Dependent variables
included the time spent in the light area, latency to cross to the dark area (all four paws in)
and the total number of transitions between compartments. The apparatus was cleaned after
each trial.
Open field activity test
The open filed test was performed as described previously 80. The open field consisted of a
white PVC arena (50cmx30cm) divided into 10cmx10cm squares. Mice were brought into
the experimental room 15min before testing. Each mouse was placed in one of the corner
squares facing the wall, observed and recorded for 5min. The total number of squares
crossed, latency to the first rear and the total number of rears were recorded. After each test,
the arena was cleaned with water to attenuate and homogenize olfactory traces.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from brains of wild type and AnxA1tg mice RNeasy Microarray
Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) while for the purified CD4+ T cells we used
RNeasy Mini Kit from the same manufacturer. Meninges were removed by gently rolling
the brains on Whatman paper. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using 2 mg oligo(dT)15
primer, 10 U AMV reverse transcriptase, 40U RNase inhibitor (all from Promega

Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and 1.25mM each dNTP (Bioline, London, UK) for 45
min at 42ºC. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out by using ABsoluteTM
QPCR ROX Mix (Thermo Scientific, Epsom, UK) and fluorescent QuantiTect primers
(Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). The human and murine primers for Tdrp were HsTDRP1SG
and MmTdrp1SG. Cycling conditions were set according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence-specific fluorescent signal was detected by 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). mRNA data were normalized relative to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and then used to calculate expression levels.
We used the comparative Ct method to measure the gene transcription in samples. The
results are expressed as relative units based on calculation of 2-DDCt, which gives the relative
amount of gene normalized to endogenous control (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) and to the sample with the lowest expression set as 1.
Total RNA was also isolated from PBMCs of OCD subjects and healthy controls according
to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi 92. RT-PCR reactions were performed using the
RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). The relative abundance was assessed by RT-qPCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Hercules, CA, USA) on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 Continuous Fluorescence Detection
System (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA). To provide precise quantification of the initial
target in each PCR reaction, the amplification plot was examined and the point of early log
phase of product accumulation defined by assigning a fluorescence threshold above
background, defined as the threshold cycle number or Ct. Differences in threshold cycle
number were used to quantify the relative amount of the PCR targets contained within each
tube. After PCR, a dissociation curve (melting curve) was constructed in the range of 60 to
95 °C to evaluate the specificity of the amplification products. The relative expression of
different amplicons was calculated by the delta-delta Ct (DDCt) method and converted to
relative expression ratio (2−DDCt) for statistical analysis. All human data were normalized to
the endogenous reference genes β-actin and GAPDH combined.
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array chips at UCL Genomics
(London, UK) with standard Affymetrix protocols, using GeneChip Fluidics Station 450,
and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Data was normalized by robust multiarray average (RMA) of the Bioconductor package,
affy. Relevant genes were filtered by excluding those without an Entrez ID and those with
low expression levels less than 100 by non-logged value. T-statistics were applied across
the data set using the Bioconductor package Limma, and differentially expressed genes were
identified by P < 0.05 (non-adjusted P value).
Western blotting analysis
Lymph node and splenic T cells or purified CD4+ T cells were stimulated as indicated in
figures. To obtain the whole cell lysate, cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (1%
NP-40, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1
µM aprotinin, 1 µM leupeptin, 1 µM pepstatin, 50 µM NaF, 1 µM NaVO4, 1 µM µglycerophosphate) and left on ice for 5 mins. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at
4ºC for 5 mins and the post-centrifugation supernatants collected, mixed with 6×Laemmli
buffer (Invitrogen) and stored at -20°C.

sepharose beads (Santa Cruz) were added to 500 µl of culture supernatants obtained from
1x107/ml CD4+ T cells stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 (1µg/ml) for 24 hrs.
Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C under continuous rotation and then washed with
cold PBS for 3 times. Soon after the washes, samples were denatured with 35ml of
6×Laemmli buffer (Invitrogen).
Lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (Novagen). After subsequent transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride
Immobilon-P Transfer membranes (Millipore, Watford, UK), these were incubated
overnight with antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline solution containing Tween-20
(TTBS: 130 mM NaCl; 2.68 mM KCl; 19 mM Tris-HCl; 0.001% v/v Tween-20, pH 7.4)
with 5% nonfat dry milk (Marvel) at 4°C. Immunoblotting and visualization of proteins by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant Tdrp used as positive
control was purchased from Origene (https://www.origene.com; Recombinant protein of
human chromosome 8 open reading frame 42 (C8orf42), catalogue number TP313199).
Genetic Immunization
Genetic immunization is an antibody generation platform offered as service by Aldveron
(http://www.aldevron.com). This technology is most suitable to generate neutralising
antibodies because native proteins are expressed in vivo with normal posttranscriptional
modifications. The target is cloned into one of Aldveron proprietary immunization vectors
and introduced into the host organism for gene expression. To help identify positive antisera
and hybridomas, screening without purified antigen is made possible with the use of
Aldveron proprietary screening vectors.
The procedure followed for the generation of 1B10 and 1C4 is herein briefly described. Six
rats were immunised with the immunisation vector pB8-TDRP-mur containing TDRP
cDNA sequence. The immune serum was taken at day 24 of the immunisation protocol,
after 4 genetic applications. Sera, diluted in PBS 3% FBS, were tested by flow cytometry
using mammalian cells transiently transfected with the murine Tdrp cDNA cloned into an
Aldevron proprietary expression vector (pB1-TDRP-mur). A goat anti-rat IgG Rphycoerythrin conjugate (Southern Biotech, #3030-09) at 10 µg/ml was used as a secondary
antibody. As negative control, mammalian cells transfected with an irrelevant cDNA cloned
in the same expression vector were used. Cell surface expression of the screening vector
pB1-TDRP-mur was analysed by flow cytometry using an anti-tag antibody and a goat antimouse IgG R-phycoerythrin conjugate (Southern Biotech, #1030-09) at 10 µg/ml as a
secondary antibody.
Statistics
According to the nature of the data obtained, a Student’s t test (2-tailed), or a 1 or 2-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Time-course observations were analysed
with two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison test. Behavioural data
was analysed via nonparametric analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad PRISM software v8.0, with the exception of
microarray analysis which was carried out as stated in 2.13.3 using the software package
LIMMA (Bioconductor). Data was analysed for normality using the D’Agostino-Pearson
omnibus normality test.
