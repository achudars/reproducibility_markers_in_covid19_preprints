ABSTRACT

21

Hearing loss has been implicated as a risk factor for schizophrenia, but it is not known whether this

22

association arises from common etiology, top-down influences (e.g., social isolation), bottom-up

23

neurobiological mechanisms, or combinations of these factors. Patients with 22q11.2 Deletion

24

Syndrome (22q11.2DS) have a 25-30% risk of developing schizophrenia, and also suffer frequent

25

hearing loss. Here, we used the Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS to investigate the relationship

26

between hearing loss and susceptibility to schizophrenia-relevant brain and behavioral

27

abnormalities. Df1/+ mice have a multi-gene deletion analogous to the chromosomal microdeletion

28

that causes human 22q11.2DS, and like human 22q11.2DS patients exhibit high rates of hearing

29

loss arising primarily from susceptibility to middle ear inflammation. We found that hearing loss in

30

Df1/+ mice affected schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, including electrophysiological

31

measures of central auditory gain and behavioral measures of auditory sensorimotor gating.

32

Moreover, PV+ inhibitory interneurons, another marker for schizophrenia pathology, were

33

significantly reduced in density in auditory cortex but not secondary motor cortex of Df1/+ mice with

34

hearing loss. These results reveal bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms through which

35

peripheral hearing loss arising from the 22q11.2 deletion may promote the emergence of

36

schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities, and also suggest a link

37

between conductive hearing loss and reduced PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT

39

Hearing loss is a known risk factor for schizophrenia. Deletion of chromosomal locus 22q11.2 is

40

associated with both schizophrenia and hearing loss in humans. In the Df1/+ mouse model of

41

human 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, we find that hearing loss shapes measures that are

42

considered schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, such as central auditory gain and auditory

43

sensorimotor gating. Moreover, we report a reduction in density of PV+ inhibitory interneurons in

44

the auditory cortex, but not secondary motor cortex, of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. These results

45

suggest mechanisms through which hearing loss associated with the 22q11.2 deletion may

46

promote emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities and

47

indicate that conductive hearing loss may influence PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.

INTRODUCTION

49

22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the strongest known cytogenetic risk factor for

50

schizophrenia in humans (McDonald-McGinn et al., 2015). 22q11.2DS is caused by a 0.7-3Mbp

51

congenital multigene deletion which occurs in approximately 1 out of 3000-6000 live births, making

52

it the most common chromosomal microdeletion syndrome and the second most common

53

chromosomal disorder after Down's Syndrome (McDonald-McGinn et al., 2015; Paylor and

54

Lindsay, 2006). Approximately 25-30% of patients with 22q11.2DS develop schizophrenia during

55

adolescence or adulthood (Drew et al., 2011; McDonald-McGinn et al., 2015). In addition to

56

increased schizophrenia susceptibility, 22q11.2DS is also associated with over 100 different

57

malformations and clinical presentations including heart defects, immune dysfunction,

58

hypocalcaemia, and craniofacial abnormalities such as cleft palate (Paylor and Lindsay, 2006).

59

Furthermore, patients with 22q11.2DS have frequent hearing loss, arising primarily from high rates

60

of recurrent or chronic otitis media (middle ear inflammation) (Verheij et al., 2017).

61
62

The Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS has an engineered hemizygous deletion of 1.2Mbp

63

encompassing 18 orthologs of genes deleted in human 22q11.2DS (Lindsay et al., 1999). Along

64

with other mouse models of 22q11.2DS, the Df1/+ mouse recapitulates many phenotypic features

65

of human 22q11.2DS (Paylor and Lindsay, 2006), including cardiac defects (Lindsay et al., 1999),

66

craniofacial abnormalities (Aggarwal et al., 2006), and brain and behavioral abnormalities that

67

have been linked to schizophrenia in humans (e.g., Hamm, Peterka, Gogos, & Yuste, 2017;

68

Sigurdsson, Stark, Karayiorgou, Gogos, & Gordon, 2010). Behaviorally, Df1/+ mice exhibit reduced

69

prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (Paylor et al., 2001), a robust behavioral marker

70

for schizophrenia-like abnormalities and common feature of 22q11.2DS in humans (Drew et al.,

71

2011). Functionally, specific abnormalities in auditory thalamocortical processing have also been

72

reported in Df1/+ mice, including abnormal sensitivity of auditory thalamocortical projections to

73

antipsychotic drugs (Chun et al., 2014). Interestingly, like humans with 22q11.2DS, Df1/+ mice

74

have been found to have high rates of hearing loss (Fuchs et al., 2013), due to increased

75

susceptibility to otitis media caused by developmental defects arising from the 22q11.2DS deletion

76

(Fuchs et al., 2015). However, the potential interaction between hearing loss and auditory brain

77

and behavioral abnormalities in Df1/+ mice has not previously been explored.

78
79

In humans, hearing loss has been described as the “neglected risk factor for psychosis” (Sommer

80

et al., 2014). Hearing loss is associated with increased risk of psychosis and hallucinations, and

81

hearing impairment in childhood elevates the risk of developing schizophrenia later in life (see

82

Linszen, Brouwer, Heringa, & Sommer, 2016). The mechanisms underlying the association

83

between hearing loss and schizophrenia are unknown, and could include common etiology, top-

84

down influences (e.g., social isolation), and/or bottom-up effects. A role for bottom-up effects is

85

suggested by data from animal studies indicating that loss of peripheral auditory input drives long-

86

lasting changes in central auditory processing which can affect behavior (Chambers et al., 2016;

87

Sanes and Kotak, 2011; Takesian et al., 2009; Yao and Sanes, 2018). Even reversible conductive

88

hearing loss, such as that caused by otitis media, can produce persistent changes in inhibitory

89

synaptic transmission in the auditory cortex (Mowery et al., 2015; Sanes and Kotak, 2011;

90

Takesian et al., 2012, 2009). However, it is not yet known how changes in the auditory brain

91

arising from hearing loss relate to changes in brain circuitry produced by genetic and other risk

92

factors for schizophrenia. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons play a key role in maintaining

93

excitation-inhibition balance in the cortex (Moore et al., 2018) and abnormalities in these inhibitory

94

cells are thought to be important to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Lewis, 2014). However,

95

reductions in the density of PV+ interneurons have not previously been linked with conductive

96

hearing loss in animal models of either schizophrenia or otitis media.

97

Here we report a link between hearing loss and schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and

98

behavioral abnormalities in the Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS. Putative schizophrenia

99

endophenotypes in Df1/+ mice, such as abnormalities in electrophysiological markers of central

100

auditory gain and behavioral measures of auditory sensorimotor gating, were largely explained by

101

hearing loss. Moreover, density of PV+ interneurons was significantly reduced in the auditory

102

cortex of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. Our results suggest that peripheral hearing loss arising from

103

the 22q11.2 deletion contributes to the emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and

104

behavioral abnormalities in 22q11.2DS.

106

MATERIALS AND METHODS

107

Animals

108

Experiments were conducted in Df1/+ mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates, all 6 to 19 weeks

109

of age (mean 13, SD 4.49 weeks). All mice used in these experiments were bred from a genetically

110

modified line established previously on the C57BL/6J background (Lindsay et al., 1999). Breeding

111

was maintained by crossing Df1/+ males from within the colony with WT C57BL/6J females either

112

from within the colony or from Charles River UK. Back-crossing into the C57BL/6J strain had been

113

maintained for well over 10 generations at the start of the experiments. Mice were maintained in

114

standard cages and mouse housing facilities, on a standard 12 h on, 12 h off light/dark cycle. All

115

experiments were performed in accordance with a Home Office project license approved under the

116

United Kingdom Animal Scientific Procedures Act of 1986.

117
118

Acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) testing

119

To test auditory sensorimotor gating in Df1/+ and WT mice, we measured the acoustic startle

120

response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the ASR. Startle experiments were conducted

121

using a custom-built startle measurement system consisting of four piezoelectric sensors mounted

122

underneath a circular platform 12.5 cm in diameter, housed within a dark acoustic isolation booth

123

lined with acoustical foam. The platform was encircled by a removable cylindrical plastic tube

124

approximately 13 cm in diameter and 30 cm high, to prevent the mice from jumping off. Infrared

125

lighting outside the visible range of the mouse and a webcam (Logicam) were used to monitor the

126

animals during testing. If a mouse tried to climb up the cylinder, the testing session was paused,

127

the animal was returned to the platform and the recording restarted. A speaker (Peerless Vifa

128

XT25TG30-04) was mounted in the ceiling of the booth, approximately 40 cm above the platform

129

and centered over the opening of the cylindrical platform enclosure.

130
131

Sensor signals were acquired at a 30 kHz sample rate from the analog inputs on an Open Ephys

132

data acquisition board using Open Ephys GUI software (www.open-ephys.org), then downsampled

133

to 1 kHz for analysis. Acoustic stimuli were generated at a 96000 Hz sample rate using a

134

professional sound card (RME HDSPe AIO) and custom Python software (“StimControl”, by Arne

135

F. Meyer). Stimuli were delivered to the speaker via either a Rotel RB-971 speaker amplifier or a

136

Tucker-Davis Technologies SA5 speaker amplifier. Speaker output was calibrated using a ¼-inch

137

free-field microphone, preamplifer and amplifier (G.R.A.S. 40BF, 26AC and 12AA) before the

138

experiments began, to ensure that noise levels for cue and startle stimuli were within 2 dB of target

139

levels. Measurements of speaker output were made with the microphone positioned in the center

140

of the platform at the approximate height of the animals’ ears during testing.

141
142

Acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition data were typically collected from each mouse in two

143

repeated 25-30 min testing sessions on different days, separated by 2 days. An additional testing

144

session was conducted on a third day if a previous session had been unsuccessful (e.g., if there

145

had been technical problems or difficulty keeping the animal on the measurement platform). Each

146

session involved two types of behavioral tests: startleIO tests and startlePPI tests.

147

In startleIO tests, the ASR input/output function was measured, recorded, and also visually

148

inspected online to choose prepulse cue levels used for subsequent startlePPI tests. StartleIO

149

tests involved presentation of a 65 dB SPL continuous white noise background sound, overlaid

150

with 20 ms noise bursts with sound levels ranging from 55 or 60 dB SPL to 95 dB SPL in 5 dB

151

steps. Noise bursts of different sound levels were presented in pseudorandom order, with

152

randomly varied inter-burst intervals that typically ranged from 1.67 s to 8 s (average 5 s). A typical

153

startleIO test lasted 225 s and involved presentation of 5 repeats of each noise burst sound level.

154

An initial online analysis of startle magnitude as a function of noise burst intensity level was

155

performed to choose the two or three loudest sound levels that did not evoke a startle response,

156

for use in subsequent startlePPI tests.

157
158

In startlePPI tests, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response was assessed. Like startleIO

159

tests, startlePPI tests were conducted with a continuous 65 dB SPL white noise background.

160

Approximately 20-25% of startlePPI trials were uncued trials, in which a 40 ms, 95 dB SPL startle-

161

eliciting stimulus was presented in the middle of the 20 s trial. On the remaining 75-80% of trials

162

(cued trials), the startle-eliciting stimulus was preceded by a 20 ms prepulse noise burst at one of

163

the sound levels chosen to be below the startle threshold in the startleIO tests. The delay between

164

the onset of the prepulse cue and the onset of the startle-eliciting stimulus alternated randomly

165

between 50 ms and 100 ms; however, PPI proved to be more robust in both Df1/+ and WT mice

166

using the shorter delay, and so only data collected using the 50 ms delay is presented here. A

167

typical startlePPI test lasted 1000 s and involved pseudorandom presentations of 10 repeats of

168

each of 4 possible cue conditions (2 sound levels x 2 delays) and 10 repeats of the uncued

169

condition.

171

Within 1-2 days of the final behavioral testing session, mice that underwent startle testing were

172

anaesthetized for auditory brainstem response and auditory evoked potential recordings, and then

173

immediately terminated and perfused for immunohistochemical analysis.

174
175

Auditory brainstem response (ABR) and auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording

176

To screen mice for hearing loss we recorded the auditory brainstem response (ABR), an

177

electroencephalographic signal measured through the use of scalp electrodes which allows for the

178

detection and visualization of sound-evoked potentials generated by neuronal circuits in the

179

ascending auditory pathway (Willott, Carlson, and Chen 1994). ABR recordings were performed in

180

a sound isolation booth (Industrial Acoustics Company, Inc.). Auditory stimuli were generated at a

181

sample rate of 195,312.5 Hz using a digital signal processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, TDT

182

RX6), attenuated as needed (TDT PA5), amplified (TDT SA1), and presented using a free-field

183

speaker (TDT FF1) positioned 17-18 cm from the ear directed toward the speaker. Speaker output

184

was calibrated to within 2 dB of target values before each set of experiments using a Bruel & Kjaer

185

¼ inch microphone (4939), placed at the location of the ear to be tested. Data was acquired at a

186

24,414 Hz sample rate (TDT RX5) using a low impedance headstage and signal amplifier (TDT

187

RA4LI and RA16SD, 20x gain overall, 2.2 Hz - 7.5kHz filtering) along with a custom low-pass filter

188

designed to remove attenuation switching transients (100 kHz cutoff). Stimulus presentation and

189

data acquisition was controlled using software from TDT (Brainware) and custom software written

190

in MATLAB (Mathworks).

191
192

Mice were anaesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine-medetomidine cocktail (0.003-

193

0.01 ml/g body weight of 10mg/ml ketamine, 0.083 mg/ml metetomidine). Body temperature was

194

maintained at 37-38°C using a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus). Subdermal needle

195

electrodes (Rochester Medical) were typically inserted under the skin at the vertex (positive), at the

196

bulla behind the ear directed toward the speaker (negative), and over the olfactory bulb (ground).

197

In a few animals for which ABRs but not AEPs were recorded, we instead placed the ground

198

electrode behind the bulla opposite the tested ear. ABR thresholds were determined in the left and

199

right ears in turn in most animals. The animal was re-oriented between recordings to direct the ear

200

being tested toward the speaker, but we avoided altering the positions of the subdermal electrodes

201

by switching electrodes at the input of the pre-amplifier whenever possible. ABR stimuli were 50 μs

202

monophasic clicks ranging in sound level from 0 to 90 dB SPL in 5 dB steps, repeated 500 times at

203

an inter-click interval of 50 ms.

204
205

In a subset of animals, we collected further ABR recordings in combination with auditory cortical

206

evoked-potential (AEP) recordings. To measure AEP signals, additional subdermal electrodes

207

were placed at locations corresponding approximately to the left and right auditory cortices, and

208

referenced to the same ground (at the olfactory bulb) as for the ABR recordings. Stimuli were 80

209

dB SPL clicks presented 1000 times at an inter-click interval of 300 ms. The longer inter-click

210

interval allowed for resolution of late cortical AEP waves as well as the earlier ABR signals.

211
212

Histology, immunohistochemistry and microscopy

213

Mice were euthanized using an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (0.1-0.2 ml of 20 mg/ml Euthatal;

214

Rhône Mérieux, Essex, UK) and were perfused transcardially with at least 30 ml 4%

215

paraformaldehyde (Merck, Dorset, UK) using a peristaltic pump. Brain tissue was removed and

216

stored in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C until histology could be performed. Brains were transferred

217

to increasing concentrations of sucrose solution (15% followed by 30%) for cryoprotection before

218

freezing and slicing. Coronal sections 50 μm thick were cut using a cryostat (Bright Instruments).

220

In some animals, alternate sections were used for Nissl staining and parvalbumin (PV)

221

immunohistochemistry. In other animals, sections were triple-stained for PV, NeuN and DAPI. Nissl

222

staining was performed on mounted sections using cresyl violet, according to standard procedures.

223

For PV and NeuN staining, sections were incubated with 0.5% Triton and blocked with 0.5% Triton

224

and goat serum blocking solution before being incubated in mouse anti-PV monoclonal antibody

225

(1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse anti-NeuN polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C

226

overnight. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary

227

antibody (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich) for one hour at room temperature on a shaker. Sections were then

228

rinsed again in PBS. Slides were mounted with DAPI Flouromount-G (Southernbiotech) and

229

coverslipped.

230
231

Sections stained for Nissl were viewed at 2.5x to 5x magnifications on a Zeiss Axio Scan 2 Imaging

232

microscope. Single-plane images of appropriate A1 and M2 sections were taken at 5x to 10x

233

magnification, with individual images for each hemisphere. Sections immunostained for PV were

234

viewed and captured at 10x magnification on a Zeiss Axio Scan 2 Imaging microscope. All images

235

were obtained at a resolution of 720 pixels/inch.

236
237

Data analysis

238

A total of 32 Df1/+ mice (11 male, 21 female) and 39 WT littermates (20 male, 19 female) were

239

used in these experiments. All data analyses were conducted blind to the genotype of the animal.

240

We performed comparisons between two groups with the unpaired t-test, and comparisons

241

between multiple groups with the ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD tests where group differences

242

were significant. Non-parametric tests were used where required; for random permutation tests the

243

data were randomly permuted 10,000 times and the actual difference between the means of the

244

groups were compared against the randomized distribution. Unless otherwise indicated, all

245

statistical tests were two-tailed with α=0.05.

246
247

Startle data analysis

248

Startle analysis was performed on data from 17 Df1/+ mice and 14 WT mice that completed startle

249

testing successfully and also underwent subsequent ABR testing to assess hearing sensitivity. The

250

time-varying startle signal was defined at each 1-ms time point as the square root of the sum of

251

squared outputs from the four piezoelectric force sensors embedded beneath the startle platform.

252

The startle response was defined as the sum of these sample-by-sample startle signals over the 0-

253

65 ms period following the onset of the startle-eliciting noise burst. To determine the threshold for

254

the startle response for each mouse, data from startleIO behavioral sessions were pooled across

255

repeated sessions. The startle response threshold was then defined as the lowest noise burst level

256

for which its startle response was significantly greater than the startle response elicited by a 60 dB

257

SPL noise burst (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p<0.01), and for which all noise burst levels above the

258

threshold sound level also elicited a significantly stronger startle response than the 60 dB SPL

259

reference. Mice for which no startle response threshold could be identified (2 Df1/+, 5 WT) were

260

excluded from the population analysis shown in Figure 8.

261
262

The uncued startle response was determined using data from startlePPI behavioral sessions, and

263

computed as the mean startle response to a 95 dB SPL noise burst on uncued trials from each

264

behavioral session, averaged across repeated behavioral sessions for each animal. A behavioral

265

session was included in this and other PPI analyses only if the uncued startle response was

266

significantly different from the background startle response computed over a period 0–65 ms

267

before the noise burst occurred (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, p<0.01). For startlePPI sessions meeting

268

this criterion, the cued startle response was then computed for each cue type, as the mean startle

269

response to the 95 dB SPL noise burst on cued trials in each behavioral session averaged across

270

repeated behavioral sessions for each animal. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) was then defined for each

271

behavioral session and each cue type as follows:

273

PPI (%) = 100 * (1 - [cued startle response / uncued startle response]).

For population analysis, PPI values for each cue type and each behavioral session were averaged

276

across behavioral sessions to obtain a single PPI measure for each animal. Cue conditions in

277

which the cue itself evoked a significant startle response (i.e., significant difference in background

278

startle response 0–65 ms before startle noise onset between cued and uncued trials; Wilcoxon

279

rank-sum test, p<0.01) were excluded from the population analysis.

281

ABR/AEP data analysis

282

ABR recordings were performed in 25 Df1/+ (9 male, 16 female) and 26 WT (13 male, 13 female)

283

mice. A total of 104 ABR threshold measurements (50 Df1/+, 52 WT) were obtained; each mouse

284

contributed two separate ABR measurements, one for each ear. In the majority of animals, we

285

collected ABR recordings in combination with auditory cortical evoked-potential (AEP) recordings.

286

Combined ABR/AEP recordings were obtained from 79 ears and contralateral hemispheres (40

287

Df1/+, 39 WT); 20 Df1/+ mice and 19 WT mice each contributed separate ABR/AEP

288

measurements for both of the two possible ear / contralateral hemisphere combinations, while 1

289

WT mice died after only one ABR/AEP recording had been completed. Separate measurements

290

from the same animal obtained during auditory stimulation of left versus right ears were treated as

291

independent measurements in our data analysis.

292

The differential ABR signal for a given ear (vertex electrode signal minus ipsilateral ear electrode

293

signal) was averaged across 500 trials for each click intensity, and analyzed to extract ABR

294

waveform components as in previous studies (Fuchs et al. 2013). The ABR threshold was defined

295

as the lowest sound intensity at which at least one of the characteristic deflections in the ABR

296

waveform could be distinguished upon visualization of the ABR signal across all sound intensity

297

levels (see Fuchs et al., 2013 for examples and details).

298
299

The single-ended AEP signal was derived from the temporal lobe electrode contralateral to the ear

300

directed at the speaker, since AEP signals were stronger over the contralateral than ipsilateral

301

hemisphere. Signals were averaged over 1000 repeated trials to obtain the AEP waveform. The

302

AEP wave components were characterized as in Maxwell et al., 2004: P1, or P20, was defined as

303

the maximum peak 15-30 ms after stimulus onset; N1, or N40, was defined as the maximum

304

negative deflection 25-60 ms post-onset; and P2, or P80, was defined as the maximum peak 60-

305

110 ms post-onset.

306
307

Wave amplitudes were defined for an 80 dB SPL click stimulus, as the difference in ABR/AEP

308

signal amplitudes between baseline at the start of the recording and peak for ABR wave I; between

309

the peak and subsequent trough for AEP P1-N1 complex; and between the trough and subsequent

310

peak for AEP N1-P2 complex (see Figure 2). Wave latencies were defined as peak or trough times

311

relative to stimulus onset. All amplitude and latency analyses were performed blind to mouse

312

genotype and ABR threshold. Central auditory gain was defined as the amplitude of the AEP wave

313

complex (P1-N1 or N1-P2) divided by the amplitude of ABR wave I.

Quantification of cell counts

316

PV+ and NeuN+ cell counts and laminar distributions in A1 and M2 were estimated for images

317

from both hemispheres in each mouse when possible. Immunohistochemical data from some

318

hemispheres and animals were lost due to problems with perfusion, damage to sections, or

319

aberrant fluorescence in images. See Table 1 for details of number of mice and hemispheres used

320

for different comparisons shown in Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10. Only data from animals that

321

had undergone ABR testing prior to immunohistochemistry were used for comparisons between

322

Df1/+ mice with hearing loss, Df1/+ mice without hearing loss, and WT mice.

were included in comparisons of WT animals and Df1/+ mice with and without hearing loss (Figure

Cortical areas of interest were defined by overlaying the section image with the Paxinos and

330

Franklin (2012) mouse atlas image of the corresponding coronal location relative to bregma, using

331

Adobe Photoshop Elements (Adobe Systems Inc). Using ImageJ, dots were centered over the

332

cells, cell centroid locations recorded (X,Y coordinates, in pixels), and data transferred to MATLAB

333

for analysis of cell counts. All cells in the cortical area of interest (A1 or M2) were counted in

334

sections immunolabelled for PV, and cells within a 5% area through the center of the region of

335

interest were counted in sections immunolabelled for NeuN. Laminar distributions of cells were

336

estimated using custom MATLAB software designed to calculate cell centroid depth along a line

337

perpendicular to the pial surface and white matter. Laminar distributions were normalized by the

338

pia-to-white-matter distance in each section. Laminar distributions were compared between animal

339

groups using multiple t-tests on cell counts binned by cortical depth; similar results were obtained

340

using 5, 10 or 20 bins in depth. All cell counts and laminar distribution data were gathered blind to

341

genotype and ABR thresholds of the mouse.

RESULTS

344

Df1/+ mice exhibit hearing loss in 60% of animals (54% of ears)

345

Both human 22q11.2DS patients and mouse models of 22q11.2DS have been reported to have

346

high rates of hearing loss due primarily to middle ear inflammation (Dyce et al., 2002; Fuchs et al.,

347

2015, 2013; Reyes et al., 1999; Verheij et al., 2017). We measured hearing thresholds for each ear

348

in 25 Df1/+ mice and 26 WT mice using the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The ABR is an

349

electroencephalographic signal arising from sound-evoked neural activity within the auditory nerve

350

and brainstem (Willott, 2006). The ABR threshold was defined as the lowest sound intensity at

351

which at least one of the characteristic deflections in the ABR waveform could be distinguished

352

upon visualization of the signal across all sound intensity levels (see Materials and Methods).

353

Click-evoked ABR thresholds were estimated for each ear in each mouse by an observer blind to

354

the genotype of the animal. To minimize the influence of age-related sensorineural hearing loss

355

characteristic of the C57BL/6J background strain (Parham, 1997), Df1/+ and WT mice tested in

356

each session were littermates between 6 and 12 weeks of age. To reduce the potential for

357

transmission of sound signals to the inner ear via bone or tissue conduction rather than via the

358

middle ear, all sound stimuli were presented free-field rather than through an in-ear coupler.

359
360

Replicating previous results obtained in a different cohort of Df1/+ and WT mice (Fuchs et al.

361

2013), we found clear evidence for hearing loss in more than half of the Df1/+ animals (Figure 1).

362

Mean ± SEM values for ABR thresholds were 44.8 ± 1.73 dB SPL in Df1/+ ears versus 32.5 ± 0.47

363

dB SPL in WT ears. Elevation of ABR thresholds in Df1/+ relative to WT mice was evident in both

364

male and female animals (Figure 1A), and a two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of

365

genotype but not gender (genotype: F(1,97)=44.24, p<0.0001; gender: F(1,97)=0.63, p=0.43). The

366

range of ABR thresholds in Df1/+ ears extended from the minimum to well beyond the maximum of

367

the WT range (Figure 1B); i.e., ABR thresholds were abnormally elevated in some Df1/+ ears but

368

not others. Defining the upper bound of normal hearing as 2.5 SD above the mean ABR threshold

369

for WT ears (40.89 dB SPL), we found that 54% (27/50) of Df1/+ ears and 0% (0/52) of WT ears

370

displayed hearing loss. Overall, 60% (15/25) of Df1/+ mice had either monaural or binaural hearing

371

loss, and monaural hearing loss occurred most commonly in the left ear (Figure 1C). These results

372

align both qualitatively and quantitatively with findings previously reported by Fuchs et al. (2013).

374

ABR Wave I amplitude reductions in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss are not maintained in

375

cortical AEPs

376

Previous studies have reported abnormalities in sound-evoked auditory thalamic and/or cortical

377

activity in mouse models of 22q11.2DS (Chun et al., 2014; Didriksen et al., 2017). We wondered if

378

auditory brain responses might differ between Df1/+ and WT mice, and if so, whether these

379

differences might be related to peripheral hearing loss. To find out, we recorded both ABRs and

380

auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in 20 WT and 20 Df1/+ mice (11 Df1/+ with no hearing loss, 9

381

Df1/+ with hearing loss in at least one ear), following presentations of loud (80 dB SPL) clicks at

382

300 ms inter-click intervals. We then measured latencies and amplitudes of ABR and AEP waves

383

to determine whether the waveforms differed between WT and Df1/+ mice, or between WT mice

384

and Df1/+ mice with and without hearing loss (Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4). To assess the

385

timing and strength of afferent input to the auditory brain, we measured the peak latency and

386

baseline-to-peak amplitude of ABR wave I (Figure 2A), which arises from the auditory nerve

387

(Willott, 2006). Within the AEP, we focused on wave peaks or troughs typically attributed to activity

388

within the auditory thalamus (P1), auditory cortex (N1), and associative cortices (P2), measuring

389

P1, N1, and P2 latency and P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitudes (Figure 2D).

390
391

Hearing loss, defined here as an elevation of the ABR threshold, would be expected to reduce

392

ABR wave I amplitude for a suprathreshold click. As expected, the amplitude of ABR wave I to an

393

80 dB SPL click was significantly lower in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss (HL) than in either Df1/+

394

mice with no hearing loss (NHL) or WT mice (Figure 2C and Figure 3B; ordinary one-way ANOVA,

395

F(2,76)=5.55, group difference p=0.0056; Fisher's LSD, Df1/+ HL vs. NHL p=0.0019; Df1/+ HL vs.

396

WT p=0.0094), while there was no significant difference between Df1/+ mice without hearing loss

397

and WT animals (Df1/+ NHL vs. WT p=0.33), nor between Df1/+ and WT mice overall (Figure 2B

398

and Figure 3A; unpaired t-test, p=0.66). More surprisingly, there were no significant differences in

399

AEP wave amplitudes between Df1/+ and WT mice, even when Df1/+ mice with and without

400

hearing loss were considered separately (Figure 2E,F and Figure 3C-F; WT vs. Df1/+ overall,

401

unpaired t-tests, P1-N1: p=0.82, N1-P2: p=0.22; WT vs. Df1/+ NHL vs. Df1/+ HL, ordinary one-way

402

ANOVAs, P1-N1: F(2,76)=0.025, group difference p=0.98, N1-P2: F(2,76)=1.20, group difference

403

p=0.31). There were also no significant differences in latencies of ABR wave I or AEP waves P1,

404

N1 or P2 between WT and Df1/+ animals, either overall or when hearing loss in Df1/+ mice was

405

taken into account (Figure 4; unpaired t-tests and ordinary one-way ANOVAs, all comparisons

406

p>0.1). Thus, while ABR wave I amplitude was reduced as expected in Df1/+ mice with hearing

407

loss, there were no significant differences in the AEP waves between any of the subgroups,

408

suggesting possible central auditory compensation for reduction in auditory nerve input in Df1/+

409

mice with hearing loss.

410
411

Df1/+ mice with hearing loss show elevation of central auditory gain

412

Given that peripheral hearing loss, including disruption of middle ear function, is known to drive

413

compensatory changes throughout the auditory brain that reduce inhibition and increase “central

414

auditory gain” (Clarkson et al., 2016; Sanes and Kotak, 2011; Takesian et al., 2009; Teichert et al.,

415

2017), we wondered if central auditory gain might differ between Df1/+ and WT mice, or between

416

Df1/+ mice with and without hearing loss. To determine this, we compared ABR wave I amplitude

417

in each recorded ear to AEP P1-N1 or N1-P2 amplitude recorded over the contralateral cortical

418

hemisphere (number of ear-hemisphere comparisons: 39 WT, 40 Df1/+ of which 22 were from

419

Df1/+ mice without hearing loss, 18 from Df1/+ mice with hearing loss), and we used the ratios of

420

AEP P1-N1 and N1-P2 amplitude to ABR wave I amplitude as measures of central auditory gain in

421

each ABR/AEP recording.

423

For both the P1-N1 and N1-P2 complexes, central auditory gain was elevated in Df1/+ mice with

424

hearing loss (Figure 5). There were no significant differences observed in the ratio of either AEP

425

P1-N1 amplitude or N1-P2 amplitude to ABR wave I amplitude when comparing Df1/+ mice overall

426

with WT mice (Figure 5A,C: unpaired t-tests, P1-N1 p=0.36, N1-P2 p=0.084). However, the P1-N1

427

/ wave I ratio was significantly higher in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss than in either WT mice or

428

Df1/+ mice without hearing loss (Figure 5B; ordinary one-way ANOVA, F(2,76)=4.96, group

429

difference p=0.0094; Fisher's LSD, Df1/+ HL vs. WT p=0.011, Df1/+ HL vs. Df1/+ NHL p=0.0037),

430

while Df1/+ mice without hearing loss were not significantly different from WT animals (WT vs.

431

Df1/+ NHL p=0.44). Similarly, the N1-P2 / wave I ratio was significantly higher in Df1/+ mice with

432

hearing loss than in either WT mice or Df1/+ mice without hearing loss (Figure 5D; ordinary one-

433

way ANOVA, F(2,76)=7.68, group difference p=0.0009; Fisher's LSD, Df1/+ HL vs. WT p=0.0006,

434

Df1/+ HL vs. Df1/+ NHL p=0.0009), while no significant differences in N1-P2 gain were found

435

between Df1/+ mice without hearing loss and WT mice (WT vs. Df1/+ NHL p=0.79). These results

436

are consistent with the conclusion that central auditory gain is increased in Df1/+ animals with

437

hearing loss.

438
439

Df1/+ mice exhibit abnormal PPI of ASR for prepulse cues with fixed absolute sound level,

440

but not for cues adjusted relative to startle threshold

441

We next examined potential behavioral influences of the hearing deficit and altered central auditory

442

gain observed in Df1/+ mice. The acoustic startle response (ASR) is a reflexive jump evoked by a

443

loud sound, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the ASR is the suppression of this jump that occurs

444

when the loud sound is reliably preceded by a quieter but audible cue (the prepulse). Deficits in

445

PPI of the ASR have been reported in the Df1/+ mouse and other mouse models of 22q11.2DS

446

(Chun et al., 2014; Didriksen et al., 2017; Paylor and Lindsay, 2006), as well as in humans with

447

22q11.2DS (Sobin et al., 2004) or schizophrenia (Turetsky et al., 2007). We wondered whether

448

hearing loss and/or central auditory consequences of hearing loss might account for abnormally

449

weak PPI of the ASR in Df1/+ mice. To examine this, we measured startle responses and PPI of

450

the ASR in 14 WT mice and 17 Df1/+ mice. For testing PPI of the ASR, we chose prepulse sound

451

levels for each mouse that were 5-20 dB below the animal's behaviorally determined startle

452

response threshold (i.e., below the quietest sound that evoked a significant startle response),

453

thereby adjusting the prepulse cue levels for each animal to be as audible as possible without

454

evoking a startle response. The loud startle-eliciting stimulus, in contrast, was always 95 dB SPL

455

(Willott et al., 1984). All mice included in this analysis exhibited a significant startle response to the

456

95 dB SPL sound, and no significant startle response to the prepulse cues. Behavioral testing was

457

performed blind to the genotype of the animal (and to its ABR thresholds, which were measured

458

only after behavioral testing was completed).

459
460

Startle response functions were determined for each animal by presenting noise bursts of varying

461

sound levels against a 65 dB SPL white noise background. We defined the startle threshold as the

462

lowest sound level that evoked a significant startle response at that sound level and all higher

463

sound levels (Figure 6A,B; see Materials and Methods). We also measured the magnitude of the

464

uncued startle response to the fixed 95 dB SPL noise burst used as the startle-eliciting stimulus in

465

all PPI tests. We found that startle thresholds were significantly higher in Df1/+ than in WT mice

466

(Figure 7A; random permutation test, p=0.023), and uncued startle response magnitudes were

467

significantly lower in Df1/+ than WT mice (Figure 7C; unpaired t-test, p=0.029). Both of these

468

findings are consistent with the conclusion that hearing loss in Df1/+ mice reduces sensitivity to

469

noise bursts used as prepulse cues or startle-eliciting stimuli. We note, however, that the

470

differences between Df1/+ and WT mice in startle threshold and uncued startle response

471

magnitude did not reach significance when the Df1/+ animals were further subdivided into mice

472

with and without hearing loss (see Figure 7B,D and Figure 7 legend for details).

473

Several previous studies have reported that PPI of the ASR is reduced in Df1/+ mice (Chun et al.,

474

2014; Paylor and Lindsay, 2006). We wondered if PPI of the ASR would still be weaker in Df1/+

475

than WT mice if the sound levels of the prepulse cues were not fixed on an absolute dB SPL scale,

476

but instead adjusted relative to each animal's startle threshold, to match its sensory salience

477

across animals. The examples of Figure 6 illustrate our approach. After measuring each animal's

478

startle threshold (Figure 6A,B), we tested PPI of the ASR using at least two different prepulse

479

sound levels, chosen to be between 5 and 20 dB SPL below the animal's startle threshold. We

480

then compared PPI for prepulse cues with fixed absolute sound level (Figure 6C,D) to PPI when

481

the prepulse cue level was defined relative to startle threshold for each animal (Figure 6E,F). As

482

shown for the example mice in Figure 6, PPI to a fixed 70 dB SPL prepulse cue was 68% in the

483

WT mouse (Figure 6C) but only 27% in the Df1/+ mouse (Figure 6D). In contrast, PPI to a prepulse

484

cue with sound level of -10 dB relative to startle threshold was very similar in both mice (Figure

485

6E,F; 59% in WT mouse, 57% in Df1/+ mouse). This finding held across the population. PPI of the

486

ASR was significantly weaker in Df1/+ than WT mice tested with a fixed 70 dB SPL prepulse cue

487

(Figure 7E; unpaired t-test, p=0.022; number of mice: 9 WT, 14 Df1/+), but there were no

488

significant differences in PPI between Df1/+ and WT animals when the cue level was adjusted to

489

be -10 dB relative to startle threshold (Figure 7G; unpaired t-test, p=0.82; number of mice: 11 WT,

490

12 Df1/+). Similar trends but no significant group differences were found when the groups were

491

further subdivided to compare WT mice and Df1/+ mice with and without hearing loss (see Figure

492

7F,H and Figure 7 legend for details). These results suggest that Df1/+ mice do not exhibit reduced

493

PPI of acoustic startle compared to WT mice when the prepulse cue level is adjusted relative to

494

startle threshold for each animal.

496

Df1/+ mice with hearing loss show reduced density of PV+ but not NeuN+ cells in auditory

497

cortex

498

After examining physiological and behavioral effects of hearing loss in Df1/+ mice, we investigated

499

potential neuroanatomical correlates. Abnormalities in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneuron

500

networks are a common finding in animal models of schizophrenia (see Lewis, Curley, Glausier, &

501

Volk, 2012 for a review), and alterations in PV+ interneuron activity have previously been linked

502

both to changes in central auditory gain (Resnik and Polley, 2017) and changes in PPI of acoustic

503

startle (Aizenberg et al., 2015). We wondered whether PV+ interneuron density in auditory cortex

504

might be abnormal in Df1/+ mice relative to WT mice, and if so, how these abnormalities might

505

relate to hearing loss. To compare PV+ interneuron density to density of neurons overall, we

506

performed immunohistochemical staining for PV and NeuN (a pan-neuronal marker) in coronal

507

brain sections through the auditory cortex (Figure 8A and Figure 4A) in 26 WT mice and 24 Df1/+

508

mice. The final data set included images from auditory cortex in 66 cortical hemispheres (32 WT,

509

34 Df1/+).

510
511

PV+ interneuron density in A1 was significantly lower in Df1/+ than WT mice (Figure 8B; unpaired

512

t-test, p=0.00030). Moreover, PV+ cell density was significantly reduced in Df1/+ mice with hearing

513

loss compared to either WT mice or Df1/+ mice without hearing loss (Figure 8C; ordinary one-way

514

ANOVA, F(2,43)=6.37, group difference p=0.0038; Fisher's LSD, Df1/+ HL vs. WT p=0.0011, Df1/+

(Df1/+ NHL vs. WT p=0.53). In contrast, there were no significant differences in NeuN+ cell density

in A1 between WT and Df1/+ animals overall (Figure 9B; unpaired t-test, p=0.29), nor between WT

mice, Df1/+ mice without hearing loss, and Df1/+ mice with hearing loss (Figure 9C; ordinary one-

520

density in A1 is reduced in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss, suggesting that cortical changes might

521

contribute to central auditory compensation for hearing loss in Df1/+ animals.

522
523

Df1/+ mice do not show abnormalities in PV+ or NeuN+ cell density in M2, nor changes in

524

laminar distributions of PV+ cells in A1

525

We also wondered if abnormalities in PV+ interneuron density in Df1/+ mice might be evident in

526

other cortical areas besides A1. Auditory cortex in mice is reciprocally connected with the

527

secondary motor cortex (M2), and neural activity in M2 is known to modulate auditory cortical

528

processing (Nelson et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2014). To find out if reductions in PV+

529

interneuron density observed in A1 of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss also occurred in M2, we

530

analyzed PV and NeuN immunostaining in coronal brain sections through frontal cortex (Figure 8D

531

and Figure 9D) in 79 hemispheres (43 WT, 36 Df1/+).

532
533

PV+ interneuron density in M2 did not differ between WT and Df1/+ mice (Figure 8E; unpaired t-

534

test, p=0.46), nor between WT mice, Df1/+ mice without hearing loss, and Df1/+ mice with hearing

535

loss (Figure 8F; ordinary one-way ANOVA, F(2,56)=1.04, group difference p=0.36). There were

536

also no significant differences between animal groups in NeuN+ cell density in M2, either between

537

WT and Df1/+ mice overall or when the Df1/+ animals were further subdivided into those with and

538

without hearing loss (Figure 9E,F; WT vs. Df1/+, unpaired t-test, p=0.82; WT vs. Df1/+ NHL vs.

539

Df1/+ HL, ordinary one-way ANOVA, F(2,42)=0.076, group difference p=0.93). These results

540

suggest that reductions in PV+ interneuron density observed in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss may

541

be specific to the auditory cortex.

542
543

Previous studies have reported aberrant inhibitory interneuron distributions in the frontal cortex in

544

another mouse model of 22q11.2DS, the LgDel mouse (Meechan et al., 2009). We therefore

545

wondered whether laminar distributions of PV+ interneurons might be altered in A1 or M2 of Df1/+

546

mice. To find out, we quantified the laminar depth of cell centroids along the pia-to-white-matter

547

axis in both areas, normalizing the depth measures by cortical thickness. We then discretized cell

548

counts into 5, 10, or 20 proportional depth bins to analyze effects of genotype or hearing loss on

549

laminar distribution of cells. We found no significant differences in the laminar distribution of PV+

550

interneurons in Df1/+ mice compared to their WT littermates in either A1 or M2 (Figure 10A,C; two-

551

way ANOVA, A1 WT vs. Df1/+, F(4,164)=0.25, p=0.91, M2 WT vs. Df1/+ mice F(4,212)=1.13,

552

p=0.34). When we compared WT mice and Df1/+ mice with and without hearing loss, we again

553

found no significant differences in laminar distribution of PV+ cells in A1, while a weak effect of

554

hearing loss was observed in M2 when using 5 but not 10 or 20 proportional depth bins (Figure

555

10B,D; two-way ANOVA, A1 WT vs. Df1/+ NHL vs. Df1/+ HL, F(8,160)=0.22, p=0.99, M2 WT vs.

556

Df1/+ NHL vs. Df1/+ HL mice F(8,208)=2.24, p=0.026). Thus, we found minimal evidence for

557

abnormalities in laminar distributions of PV+ interneurons in either A1 or M2 of Df1/+ mice,

558

regardless of hearing loss.

559
560

DISCUSSION

561

Hearing loss in mouse models of 22q11.2DS

562

Our data confirm that Df1/+ mice have high rates of hearing loss, replicating both qualitatively and

563

quantitatively results reported by Fuchs et al. (2013) for a different cohort of animals. Like Fuchs et

564

al. (2013), we found that approximately 60% of Df1/+ mice have elevated ABR thresholds in one or

565

both ears; that the incidence of hearing loss is similar in male and female Df1/+ mice; and that

566

hearing loss in Df1/+ mice can be either monaural or binaural. Fuchs et al. (2013) also showed that

567

hearing loss in Df1/+ mice correlates with otitis media (middle ear inflammation). Subsequently,

568

Fuchs et al. (2015) demonstrated that otitis media in Df1/+ mice is associated with a bilateral or

569

monolateral defect in the levator veli palatini muscle lining the Eustachian tube, which affects

570

drainage of middle ear effusion. This muscle defect arises early in myogenesis and appears to be

571

caused by haploinsufficiency of the gene Tbx1 (Fuchs et al., 2015), which has also been linked to

572

other middle and inner ear abnormalities (Liao et al., 2004). Thus, any mouse model of 22q11.2DS

573

with heterozygous deletion of Tbx1 may be susceptible to otitis media and hearing loss. The Tbx1

574

gene lies within the minimum human 22q11.2DS deletion region, and susceptibility to otitis media

575

and hearing loss has been widely reported in human 22q11.2DS patients (see Verheij et al., 2017

576

for a review).

577
578

There are, however, some discrepant results in the literature on hearing loss in mouse models of

579

22q11.2DS. For example, Paylor et al. (2006) tested frequency-dependent distortion-product

580

otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in 6 Df1/+ and 6 WT mice, and found no significant differences in

581

DPOAE thresholds between the groups (see their Supplementary Figure 6). DPOAE thresholds

582

reflect outer hair sensitivity, not auditory nerve activity, but conductive hearing loss (e.g. from otitis

583

media) should increase DPOAE as well as ABR thresholds (Qin et al., 2010). A more direct

584

methodological analogy to Fuchs et al. (2013) and the present study comes from a recent

585

characterisation of a new congenic mouse model of the minimum human 22q11.2DS deletion, the

586

Df(h22q11)/+ mouse, which like the Df1/+ mouse is heterozygous for deletion of Tbx1 (Didriksen et

587

al., 2017). Didriksen et al. (2017) found no significant differences in click-evoked ABR thresholds

588

between 13 Df(h22q11)/+ and 13 WT animals.

589
590

One possible explanation for these discrepancies is differences in methodology. For example,

591

(Paylor et al., 2006) and Didriksen et al. (2017) used in-ear speakers or couplers for sound

592

delivery, rather than free-field speakers as in Fuchs et al. (2013) and the present work. While in-

593

ear and free-field sound delivery techniques should produce similar results, hearing loss arising

594

from middle ear dysfunction might not be detected if physical coupling of a sound delivery device

595

to the ear canal enables transmission of sound signals directly to the inner ear via bone or tissue

596

conduction (Steel et al., 1987).

597
598

Age differences and genetic differences in the mice might also help to explain the discrepant

599

results. The Df(h22q11)1/+ mice that underwent ABR testing in Didriksen et al. (2017) were

600

indicated to be approximately 5 months old (see their Supplementary Figure A2), while the mice

601

used here and in Paylor et al. (2006) were somewhat younger (here, 1.5-4.5 months old, mean 3

602

months; 2-4 months old in Paylor et al. 2006). It is possible that the accelerated age-related

603

hearing loss characteristic of the C57BL/6 background strain (Hequembourg and Liberman, 2001)

604

might have obscured hearing loss due to middle ear problems in the Didriksen et al. (2017) study.

605

Alternatively (or additionally), genetic differences between Df(h22q11)1/+ and Df1/+ mice might

606

have affected results of hearing tests, since the Df(h22q11)1/+ mice used by Didriksen et al.

607

(2017) have a slightly larger chromosomal deletion affecting an extra 5 genes (Dgcr2, Tssk2,

608

Tssk1, Mrpl40, and Hira). However, both Df1/+ mice and Df(h22q11)1/+ mice exhibit the

609

haploinsufficiency for Tbx1 that is thought to underlie vulnerability to otitis media and hearing loss

610

(Didriksen et al., 2017; Fuchs et al., 2015), and genetically, the Df1/+ mice used by Paylor et al.

611

(2006) should have been essentially identical to the Df1/+ mice used here.

612
613

Microbiological status of the mice might also be a factor, but is rarely discussed in published

614

reports. Opportunistic pathogens that are common in laboratory mouse facilities can increase risk

615

of otitis media in susceptible animals (Bleich et al., 2008). Mice used in the present study were

616

maintained in standard mouse housing facilities; it is possible that the incidence of otitis media and

617

hearing loss in Df1/+ mice might be reduced if animals were housed in a super-clean facility.

618

Importantly, however, hearing loss and otitis media have been estimated to affect a majority of

619

human 22q11.2DS patients (Verheij et al., 2017). Therefore, even if it were possible to reduce the
27

620

incidence of otitis media in Df1/+ mice by restricting their microbiological exposure, the resulting

621

animals would be poorer models of the human syndrome. Similar concerns about the translational

622

value of “squeaky-clean” mouse models have recently been raised by many immunologists

623

(Willyard, 2018).

624
625

Central auditory abnormalities in mouse models of 22q11.2DS

626

We found that the magnitude of the cortical auditory evoked potential to a loud sound was similar

627

in Df1/+ and WT mice, even for Df1/+ mice with abnormally elevated ABR thresholds. Measures of

628

central auditory gain (e.g., ratios between AEP P1-N1 or N1-P2 amplitude and ABR wave I

629

amplitude) were significantly higher in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss than in WT mice or in Df1/+

630

mice without hearing loss. These results suggest a compensatory increase in central auditory gain

631

in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. Interestingly, although Didriksen et al. (2017) did not observe

632

differences in ABR thresholds between Df(h22q11)/+ and WT mice, they did find evidence for

633

increased central auditory gain: AEP amplitude increased more steeply with sound loudness in

634

Df(h22q11)/+ than WT animals.

635
636

Increased central auditory gain in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss could arise at multiple stages of the

637

central auditory pathway. Loss of peripheral auditory input drives homeostatic changes throughout

638

the auditory brainstem, midbrain, thalamus and cortex, which typically manifest as reductions in

639

inhibitory synaptic transmission, increased spontaneous activity, and increased gain of sound-

640

evoked responses (Chambers et al., 2016; Eggermont, 2017; Takesian et al., 2012, 2009).

641

Conductive hearing loss – the form of hearing loss caused by otitis media – has been shown to be

642

sufficient to evoke plastic changes throughout the central auditory system (Clarkson et al., 2016;

643

Sinclair et al., 2017; Teichert et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2007), even when it affects only one ear

644

(Keating et al., 2015; Popescu and Polley, 2010). Moreover, conductive hearing loss that occurs

645

transiently during development can produce a reduction in inhibitory synaptic currents in the

646

auditory cortex that persists in adulthood (Mowery et al., 2015; Sanes and Kotak, 2011; Takesian

647

et al., 2012). Thus, otitis media and hearing loss in mouse models of 22q11.2DS would be

648

expected to produce abnormalities throughout the central auditory system, even if the hearing loss

649

occurred only transiently during development.

650
651

Our results are consistent with this literature, and suggest a possible re-interpretation of auditory

652

thalamocortical deficits previously reported in mouse models of 22q11.2DS (Chun et al., 2014).

653

Using in vitro electrophysiology and calcium imaging, Chun et al. (2014) observed a reduction in

654

auditory thalamocortical synaptic transmission in the Df(16)1/+ mouse (which has the same

655

deletion as the Df1/+ mouse). No such abnormality was detected in visual or somatosensory

656

thalamocortical slices, indicating that the deficit was specific to the auditory system. Chun et al.

657

(2014) linked the disruption of auditory thalamocortical synaptic transmission to aberrant elevation

658

of D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) expression in the auditory thalamus, apparently caused by

659

haploinsufficiency of the microRNA-processing gene Dgcr8. They argued that Drd2-dependent

660

disruption of thalamic inputs to the auditory cortex could be a key pathogenic mechanism

661

underlying auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.

662
663

A different interpretation is that hearing loss could be the proximal cause of the auditory thalamic

664

and thalamocortical abnormalities reported by Chun et al. (2014). The possibility of hearing loss in

665

Df(16)1/+ (or Dgcr8/+) animals was not explicitly examined in that study. Furthermore, some of the

666

conclusions were based on analysis of small numbers of in vitro recordings, taken from only a few

667

animals (or an unspecified number of animals). Given that 60% of Df1/+ mice have hearing loss in

668

one or both ears (Fuchs et al., 2013 and present work), it is possible that results in Chun et al.

669

(2014) could have been affected by the chance inclusion of differing numbers of animals with or

670

without hearing loss in different analyses. In the absence of animal-by-animal controls for hearing

671

loss, it remains unclear whether elevation of Drd2 expression in auditory thalamus and disruption

672

of auditory thalamocortical transmission are abnormalities specific to 22q11.2DS models, or more

673

general consequences of hearing loss. Notably, hearing loss has been shown to affect

674

dopaminergic function in the central auditory system (Fyk-Kolodziej et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2005).

675
676

Auditory sensorimotor gating in mouse models of 22q11.2DS

677

Consistent with findings of previous reports (Didriksen et al., 2017; Paylor et al., 2001; Paylor and

678

Lindsay, 2006; Stark et al., 2008), prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response was reduced

679

in Df1/+ mice relative to WT mice, for prepulse cues with 70 dB SPL absolute sound level.

680

However, there was no significant difference in PPI between Df1/+ and WT mice when the

681

prepulse cue sound level was adjusted to be 10 dB below the startle threshold to match its sensory

682

salience across animals. We also found that uncued startle responses to the startle-eliciting

683

stimulus (a fixed 95 dB SPL noise) were weaker in Df1/+ than WT mice.

684
685

Acoustic startle thresholds and/or PPI can be affected by abnormalities in either auditory or motor

686

circuitry, or both (Swerdlow et al., 2001). While we cannot rule out the possibility that motor control

687

deficits in Df1/+ mice (Sumitomo et al., 2018) might also have contributed to the results, our

688

findings are clearly consistent with known effects of hearing loss. Hearing loss reduces auditory

689

nerve input to the cochlear nucleus, which is the first stage of the acoustic startle circuit, and also

690

alters neural activity in the inferior colliculus, which is involved in PPI (Swerdlow et al., 2001;

691

Takesian et al., 2009).

692
693

Central auditory compensation for loss of peripheral input might counteract some effects of hearing

694

loss, but such compensation is likely to be less complete for the subcortical auditory structures

695

providing input to the startle and PPI circuits than for cortical responses (Chambers et al., 2016).

696

Therefore, the fact that cortical AEPs appeared normal in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss does not

697

mean that subcortical auditory inputs to the startle and PPI circuits were unimpaired. Similarly, a

698

low threshold for acoustic startle did not necessarily imply normal hearing (cf. Paylor et al., 2001;

699

Scott et al., 2018). While the median startle response threshold was higher in Df1/+ than WT

700

animals, the range of thresholds (75-95 dB SPL) largely overlapped in WT mice and Df1/+ mice

701

with and without hearing loss.

702
703

Parvalbumin-positive cortical interneurons and hearing loss

704

In immunohistochemical studies, we found that the density of PV+ inhibitory interneurons was

705

significantly reduced in the auditory cortex of Df1/+ relative to WT mice. The reductions in PV+ cell

706

density did not arise from an overall change in neuronal density, and were not observed in the

707

frontal region M2 which is interconnected with the auditory cortex (Nelson et al., 2013; Tomescu et

708

al., 2014). Moreover, the auditory cortex abnormality in PV+ cell density arose primarily in Df1/+

709

mice with hearing loss, again suggesting central auditory compensation for loss of peripheral input.

710
711

To our knowledge, this is not only the first report of a link between hearing loss and reduced PV+

712

interneuron density in an animal model of schizophrenia, but also the first indication that hearing

713

loss due to middle ear inflammation may influence PV+ interneurons in the auditory cortex.

714

Previous studies in mice have demonstrated that PV+ interneurons in the auditory cortex can be

715

affected by age-related (sensorineural) hearing loss (Martin del Campo et al., 2012), or by

716

mutations that disrupt both auditory hair cell function and cortical interneuron migration (Libé-

717

Philippot et al., 2017). It has also been shown that conductive hearing loss during development

718

decreases inhibitory synaptic strength in the auditory cortex (Takesian et al., 2012). Our findings

719

raise the additional possibility that conductive hearing loss, either alone or in combination with
31

720

genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, may lead to reductions in PV+ interneuron density. Further

721

experiments are required to test this hypothesis in other mouse models with conductive hearing

722

loss, and to identify the reasons for the change in PV+ cell labelling (e.g., disruption of PV+ cell

723

migration, increased PV+ cell death, or decreased PV expression).

724
725

Parvalbumin-positive cortical interneurons in mouse models of 22q11.2DS

726

Previous studies of mouse models of 22q11.2DS have reported abnormalities in PV+ cortical

727

interneurons in other brain areas and at other developmental stages (Meechan et al., 2015, 2009;

728

Piskorowski et al., 2016). In the Lgdel/+ mouse (with deletion of 5 more genes than in the Df1/+

729

mouse), Meechan et al. (2009) found that corticogenesis and subsequent differentiation of the

730

cerebral cortex was disrupted. Laminar distribution of PV+ interneurons was altered in the medial

731

prefrontal cortex at P21, but there was no apparent reduction in the density of PV+ interneurons

732

(although the density of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons was reduced). In adult Df1/+ and WT mice,

733

we found no significant differences in the laminar distribution of PV+ interneurons in A1 and

734

minimal differences in M2, despite a larger sample size (WT n=30, Df1/+ n=25 hemispheres) than

735

that used in the Meechan et al. (2009) study. Therefore, while abnormalities in PV+ interneurons

736

appear to be a reliable finding in mouse models of 22q11.2DS, the form of these abnormalities

737

may differ between mouse models, between brain areas, or between developmental time points.

738

Further work is needed to understand these differences, and also to determine their origins.

739
740

Decreased PV+ interneuron density in Df1/+ mice might produce abnormalities in cortical dynamics

741

that also occur in schizophrenia. Abnormalities in PV+ interneurons, including reductions in PV+

742

interneuron density, are a common finding in human schizophrenia (Beasley et al., 2002; Hamburg

743

et al., 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2003; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010) and are thought to contribute to

744

cognitive dysfunction (Lewis, 2014). Optogenetic reductions in PV+ interneuron

745

activity in animal models significantly attenuate the power of cortical gamma oscillations (Cardin et

746

al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009). Gamma oscillations are associated with active information

747

processing, and are attenuated in power or synchrony both in animal models of schizophrenia and

748

in human schizophrenia patients (Haenschel et al., 2009; Hamm et al., 2017; Uhlhaas and Singer,

749

2010).

750
751

While changes in PV+ immunostaining in cortex do not necessarily imply changes in interneuron

752

activity or cortical gamma oscillations, our results and those of Meechan et al. (2009, 2015)

753

suggest that mouse models of 22q11.2DS might have chronic abnormalities in PV+ interneuron

754

function. Our results further indicate that hearing loss either drives or contributes to the emergence

755

of auditory cortical abnormalities in mouse models of 22q11.2DS. Further studies are required to

756

disentangle the impact of schizophrenia-associated genetic risk factors from the effects of hearing

757

loss on auditory cortical function.

758
759

Implications for schizophrenia research

760

Disruption of auditory brain function in Df1/+ mice has previously been described as a key

761

schizophrenia-relevant pathology (Chun et al., 2014), but the possible contribution of hearing loss

762

was not considered. Our results point to a significant role for hearing loss in promoting auditory

763

brain and behavioral abnormalities in Df1/+ mice. Increased central auditory gain and reduced

764

auditory cortical PV+ interneuron density were most pronounced in Df1/+ mice with hearing loss,

765

and there were no significant differences between WT mice and Df1/+ mice without hearing loss.

766

Moreover, abnormalities in prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in Df1/+ mice were reduced when

767

prepulse cue level was adjusted relative to each animal's acoustic startle threshold. Further

768

experiments in other mouse models, including WT mice with induced hearing loss, will be required

769

to determine whether these and other central auditory abnormalities in Df1/+ mice arise from

hearing loss alone or from an interaction between hearing loss and genetic risk factors for

There is compelling evidence that hearing loss in adulthood increases the risk of psychosis and

774

hallucinations (see Linszen et al., 2016 for a recent review). Moreover, hearing impairment in

775

childhood elevates the risk of developing schizophrenia in adulthood. The mechanisms underlying

776

the association between hearing loss and psychosis remain unknown, but could include not only

777

common etiology but also bottom-up changes in neuronal networks driven by loss of sensory input,

778

and top-down changes in cognition driven by difficulty with social communication (Linszen et al.,

779

2016). In individuals with genetic or other risk factors for schizophrenia – such as 22q11.2DS

780

patients – these consequences of hearing loss might be a critical “second hit” promoting

781

development of hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms. Thus, the Df1/+ mouse and other

782

mouse models of 22q11.2DS may help to reveal how hearing loss interacts with other

783

schizophrenia risk factors to produce brain and behavioral abnormalities underlying psychiatric

784

disease.

mouse. Dashed lines indicate the upper bound of normal hearing, defined as 2.5 SD above the

mean ABR threshold for WT ears (see text). 60% (15/25) of Df1/+ mice had either monaural or

1202

binaural hearing loss, and 54% (27/50) of Df1/+ ears exhibited hearing loss. As previously

1203

observed (Fuchs et al., 2013), monaural hearing loss in Df1/+ mice occurred most commonly in the

1204

left ear (cf. Figure 2 in Fuchs et al., 2013).
