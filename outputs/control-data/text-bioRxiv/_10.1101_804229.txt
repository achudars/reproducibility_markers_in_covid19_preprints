Abstract (199 words)

37

The mechanisms by which HIV increases susceptibility to tuberculosis and other respiratory

38

infections are incompletely understood. We used transcriptomics of paired whole

39

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to compare the

40

effect of HIV at the lung mucosal surface and in the peripheral blood. The large majority of

41

HIV-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were specific to either the peripheral or

42

lung mucosa compartments (1,307/1,404, 93%). Type I interferon signaling was the dominant

43

signature of DEGs in HIV-positive blood with a less dominant and qualitatively distinct type

44

I interferon gene set expression pattern in HIV-positive BAL. DEGs in the HIV-positive

45

BAL were significantly enriched for infiltration with cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Higher

46

expression of representative transcripts and proteins in BAL CD8+ T cells during HIV

47

infection, including IFNG (IFN-γ), GZMB (Granzyme B) and PDCD1 (PD-1), was confirmed

48

by cell-subset specific transcriptional analysis and flow cytometry. Thus, we report that a

49

whole transcriptomic approach revealed qualitatively distinct effects of HIV in blood and

50

bronchoalveolar compartments. Further work exploring the impact of distinct type I

51

interferon programs and CD8+ T cells infiltration of the lung mucosa during HIV infection

52

may provide novel insights into HIV-induced susceptibility to respiratory pathogens.

Introduction

56

HIV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa bears

57

the highest burden globally with approximately 7.7 million people living with HIV in 2018 1.

58

Introduction of immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) following diagnosis has greatly

59

improved long-term outcomes and life expectancy in people living with HIV. However, 46%

60

of people living with HIV in South Africa are still viremic either because they don’t know

61

their HIV status or due to treatment failure 1.

62

HIV-infected viremic patients are more likely to develop active tuberculosis (TB) from either

63

new exposure to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) or reactivation of a pre-existing latent Mtb infection

64

when compared to HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected non-viremic individuals 2, 3. T helper 1

65

(Th1) polarized CD4+ T cells that produce interferon gamma and TNF-alpha are thought to

66

play a significant role in controlling TB infection, and their depletion in HIV-infected

67

individuals may contribute to the increased risk of TB disease

68

developing active TB increases even before significant CD4+ T cell depletion, doubling

69

within the first year of HIV infection, suggesting that other HIV-induced modulations of the

70

immune system could contribute to the increased risk of TB in people with HIV 6. Indeed,

71

HIV infection has been shown to decrease the polyfunctional cytokine production in Mtb-

72

specific CD4+ T cells independent of CD4+ T cell depletion

73

is associated with reduced phagocytic potential of alveolar macrophages, an effect that could

74

reduce the initial innate immune barrier to TB infection 9.

75

Strategies to enhance control of Mtb in HIV-infected and uninfected persons are hindered by

76

our limited understanding of the natural immunological control of Mtb and the mechanisms

77

underlying progression from latent Mtb infection to disease. Hypothesis-driven targeted

78

studies may miss important pathways that could inform the understanding of TB

79

immunopathogenesis. In contrast, high throughput approaches have the potential to offer

unbiased insights into the immune defects mediated by HIV, and thus advance the field of TB

provide mechanistic insights into the immunologic pathways that are defective in patients

who are likely to get infected with TB or progress to active disease, such as HIV-positive

(PBMCs) in transcriptomic studies has the advantage of giving an overall picture of the

86

immune profiles that are associated with development of TB. For instance, transcriptomic

analyses of whole peripheral blood in tuberculosis has pointed to the development of a type 1

90

the effect of HIV in the lung, the site of Mtb exposure; most of the work has been on samples

91

from peripheral blood because they are easily accessible.

92

In this study, we assessed the differences in immune profiles between blood and the

93

bronchoalveolar compartments using whole compartment and sorted CD8+ T cells by RNA-

94

seq and flow cytometry. We also assessed the compartment-specific effects of HIV to

95

comprehensively explore and describe the immunological defects that could explain the

96

increased lung comorbidities, especially TB disease, in HIV-infected individuals. We report

97

that while HIV induces primarily a type I interferon signature in blood, its primary signature

in the bronchoalveolar compartment is an induction of a cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltrate.

We used matched blood and bronchoalveolar fluid samples that were collected from 19 HIV-

based cohort) and 11 HIV-positive participants (8 from the research bronchoscopy cohort and

105

3 from the hospital-based cohort) (Table 1). The median age of all participants was 34 years

106

and 50% of the participants were female. There were no significant differences in age or sex

107

distribution between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups. All HIV-infected

108

participants were ART-naïve. The median viral load for the HIV-infected group was 54,942

109

(Interquartile range [IQR]: 18,743-174,293). The median CD4+ T-cell counts for the HIV-

110

uninfected and HIV-infected groups were 1,048 (IQR: 854-1,352) and 353 (IQR: 173-576),

111

respectively (p<0.0001).

112

113

Distribution of major immune cell populations in bronchoalveolar compartment and blood

114

To determine the HIV-specific effects on the distribution of major populations of immune

115

cells within each anatomical compartment, we used matched samples from the

116

bronchoalveolar compartment and blood to conduct two-way comparisons i.e. between

117

disease states within each compartment (comparisons 1 and 2, Figure 1A) and between

118

compartments (comparisons 3 and 4). We carried out differential cell counts to enumerate

119

differences in distribution of key immune cell populations between the two compartments

120

(Figure 1B). In both HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals, distributions of immune

121

cells were significantly different between the two compartments (Figure 1C). In both groups,

122

alveolar macrophages were the dominant immune cell in the bronchoalveolar compartment

123

with medians of 87.4% (Interquartile range [IQR]: 79.8-90) and 79.3 (Interquartile range

124

[IQR]: 70.9-88) among HIV-negative and HIV-positive persons, respectively (Figure 1C and

125

Supplementary table 1). On the other hand, lymphocytes and neutrophils were the dominant

126

immune cells in the peripheral blood in both groups. Notably, the distributions of major

127

immune cells were not significantly different between HIV-negative and HIV-positive

128

participants within the compartments.

129

We then used flow cytometry to further assess if there were HIV-specific alterations within

130

the lymphocyte populations. The proportions of total T cells (CD3+ cells) were reduced in the

131

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

132

cells (BLCs) of HIV-positive patients, consistent with HIV-associated T-cell infiltration in

133

bronchoalveolar compartment (p = 0.0030 and p=0.0473, respectively) (Figure 1D). The

134

reduction of proportions of CD3+ lymphocytes in PBMCs of HIV-positive study participants

135

was primarily due to the loss of CD4+ T cells as shown by the reduction in proportions of

136

CD4+ T cells in PBMCs (p =0.0001). We observed similar reduction in proportions of CD4+

137

T cells in the BLCs of HIV-positive participants (p <0.0001) (Figure 1E). Notably, we

138

observed an HIV-associated increase in proportions of CD8+ T cells in both PBMCs (p =

139

0.002) and BLCs (p = <0.0001). In further separate analyses of the research bronchoscopy

140

cohort and the hospital-based cohort, we observed a similar HIV-associated increase in

141

proportions of CD8+ T cells and a reduction in proportions of CD4+ T cells in the BLCs and

142

PBMCs (Supplementary figure 4 A, B, D and E). Thus, HIV was associated with an increase

143

in proportions of CD8+ T cells and a decrease in proportions of CD4+ T cells in both blood

144

and bronchoalveolar compartments in multiple cohorts.

146

HIV infection is associated with compartment-specific changes in the transcriptional profile

148

To first assess transcriptome-wide differences between compartments, we used RNA-seq to

149

determine RNA expression differences between BLCs and PBMCs in four HIV-uninfected

150

participants and three HIV-infected participants from the hospital-based cohort. Except for

151

one PBMCs sample, we obtained at least 1 million unique forward and reverse reads for each

152

sample after deduplication (Supplementary figure 2).

153

There were 4,761 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the BLCs and PBMCs in

154

either HIV-positive or HIV-negative participants. Of these, there were 4,084 DEGs between

155

BLCs and PBMCs in the HIV-negative group, with 2,336 genes being upregulated and 1,748

156

genes being downregulated in BLCs when compared with PBMCs (Figure 2A). On the other

157

hand, there were 2,186 DEGs between BLCs and PBMCs in the HIV-positive group, with

158

1,204 genes being upregulated and 982 genes being downregulated in BLCs when compared

159

with PBMCs (Figure 2B). Notably, the large majority of the DEGs (69% (1,509 out of

160

2,186)) between compartments in the HIV-positive individuals were also differentially

161

expressed between compartments in the HIV-negative individuals (Figure 2C).

162

To assess the compartment-specific effects of HIV, we then checked for differences between

163

the HIV-negative and HIV-positive groups within each compartment. There were 774 DEGs

164

in PBMCs between the HIV-positive and the HIV-negative groups, with 515 genes being

165

upregulated and 259 genes being downregulated in the HIV-positive group (Figure 2D). On

166

the other hand, there were 727 DEGs in BLCs in comparisons between the HIV-positive

167

group and the HIV-negative group, with 540 genes being upregulated and 187 genes being

168

downregulated in the HIV-positive group (Figure 2E). Notably, of the DEGs in either the

169

BLCs or the PBMCs between disease states, only a very small minority (6.9%, 97 of 1401)

170

were differentially expressed in both compartments. Thus, HIV-induced transcriptional

171

alterations were compartment-specific (Figure 2F).

172

Using gene ontology (GO) analyses to annotate enriched functions in these compartment

173

specific HIV-induced transcriptional changes, we identified 30 GO terms that were

174

significantly enriched (FDR q-value<0.05) in our list of DEGs in PBMCs between the HIV-

175

positive and HIV-negative groups (Supplementary table 2).

We also identified 140

176

significantly enriched GO terms in BLCs between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups

177

(Supplementary table 3). The top enriched GO term in the PBMCs of HIV-positive

178

participants was the “type I interferon signaling pathway” gene set (Figure 3A). On the other

179

hand, the most enriched GO term in the BLCs of HIV-positive participants was the “adaptive

180

immune response” gene set (Figure 3B). We also observed some enrichment of the “response

181

to interferon-beta” and “type I interferon signaling pathway” GO terms in the BLCs of HIV-

182

positive participants, but those GO terms ranked low in our list (Supplementary table 3).

183

Thus, even though HIV also induces a type I interferon signaling signature in

184

bronchoalveolar compartment, its dominant effect there is the modulation of adaptive

185

immune responses.

186

Enrichment of the “type I interferon signaling pathway” gene set in HIV-positive PBMCs

187

was due to upregulation of twenty genes, namely EGR1, IFI27, IFI35, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT2,

188

IFIT3, IFITM3, IRF4, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL, STAT1, XAF1

189

and RSAD2. On the other hand, enrichments of the “type I interferon signaling pathway” and

190

the “response to interferon-beta” gene sets in HIV-positive BLCs were due to upregulation of

191

fourteen genes, namely EGR1, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IRF1, IRF3, IRF4, IRF7, ISG15,

192

ISG20, RSAD2, AIM2, CDC34 and PYHIN1 (Figure 3C). Notably, from the above lists of

193

twenty-eight type I interferon-associated genes that were differentially expressed in either of

194

the two compartments, only six (namely EGR1, IFITM3, IRF4, IRF7, ISG15, and RSAD2)

195

were differentially expressed in both compartments, suggesting qualitative differences

196

between the compartments.

197

In BLCs, enrichment of the “adaptive immune response” gene set was attributable to the

198

HIV-induced upregulation of transcripts that suggested infiltration with cytolytic T cells,

199

such as the lineage transcripts for CD8+ T cells (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD8A and CD8B),

200

CD8+ T-cell effector molecules (granzyme M (GZMM), perforin (PRF1) and interferon

201

gamma (IFNG)) and the CD8+ T-cell transcription factors (e.g. EOMES) (Figure 3C). We

202

also observed contribution by inhibitory/exhaustion markers (PD-1 (PDCD1) and LAG-3

203

(LAG3)) in the enrichment of this GO term. Further observation of B-cell transcripts (CD19,

204

CD79A and CD79B) suggests that HIV also induces infiltration of the bronchoalveolar

205

compartment by other lymphocytes as previously reported 15 (Figure 3C).

206

Since the GO analyses suggested lymphocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar

207

compartment, we conducted further targeted analyses on the major lymphocyte lineage

208

markers to determine the infiltrating populations. There were significant upregulations of

209

CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD19 transcripts in the BLCs but not PBMCs of HIV-positive

210

patients, suggesting selective HIV-induced expansion in the bronchoalveolar compartment

211

(Supplementary 3A-D). We observed significant upregulations of transcripts for CD8A and

212

CD8B in both BLCs and PBMCs of HIV-positive patients (Supplementary 3E-F). Even

213

though transcripts for NCAM1/CD56 were reduced in PBMCs of HIV-positive patients, they

214

were not significantly altered in BLCs, suggesting that the upregulation of cytotoxic markers

215

in the BLCs of HIV-positive patients could be attributed to infiltration by cytotoxic CD8+ T

216

cells and not natural killer cells (Supplementary 3G). The levels of CD4 transcripts did not

217

differ between disease states in either of the compartments, probably because the molecule is

218

expressed on CD4+ T cells as well as other lineages such as monocytes and macrophages, a

219

phenomenon that could mask the known HIV-induced CD4+ T-cell depletion (Supplementary

220

3H), with the latter confirmed by flow cytometry in PBMCs (Figure 1E).

221

The whole compartment transcriptomic approach limited our ability to confidently attribute

222

the transcripts of effector molecules to any specific cell type, and in particular the infiltrating

223

CD8+ T cell population which appeared the most likely candidate based on transcriptome

224

profile. We therefore assessed the expression of these molecules in CD8+ T cells using flow

225

cytometry and RNA-seq on sorted CD8+ T cells. At the protein level, HIV-positive people

226

had higher levels of constitutive Granzyme B production in both PBMCs-derived and BLCs-

227

derived CD8+ T cells (Figure 4A). However, ex vivo stimulation with mitogens yielded

228

similar inducible interferon gamma between the disease states in both PBMCs-derived and

229

BLCs-derived CD8+ T cells (Figure 4B). In agreement with our analyses on bulk BLCs, the

230

HIV-positive individuals had increased expression of PD-1 in BLCs-derived CD8+ T cells

231

when compared with HIV-negative individuals (Figure 4C).

232

expression were seen when we analyzed the two cohorts separately, confirming that they

233

were immunologically similar (Supplementary figure 4 C and F). Transcriptional analysis of

234

mRNA levels from sorted CD8+ T cells confirmed these findings. HIV was associated with a

235

trend of increased transcription for granzyme B (GZMB) in BLC-derived CD8+ T cells

236

(Figure 4D). Unlike the observation on inducible interferon gamma protein, we observed

237

trends of higher constitutive expression of IFNG in HIV-positive individuals in both PBMCs-

238

derived and BLCs-derived CD8+ T cells, suggesting that HIV infection could be associated

239

with increased constitutive transcription of IFNG in vivo (Figure 4E). In agreement with the

240

data on expression of PD-1 protein on CD8+ T cells, we observed a trend of HIV-associated

241

increase in transcription of the PD-1 (PDCD1) in both BLCs-derived and PBMCs-derived

242

CD8+ T cells (Figure 4F). Thus, the infiltrating CD8+ T cells in HIV-positive individuals’

243

bronchoalveolar compartment had a functional phenotype consistent with pre-existing

244

cytotoxic products. Considering that PD-1 can be a marker of both exhaustion and activation

245

depending on context, the significance of increased PD-1 expression in BLC-derived CD8 T

246

cells in the HIV-positive group needs to be determined in future studies.

HIV is associated with an increased incidence of both infectious and non-infectious lung

250

morbidities

251

pneumonia, active tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia

252

have a higher prevalence of noninfectious structural lung complications such as emphysema

253

and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

254

Despite the high prevalence of HIV-induced lung complications, the immunopathogenesis of

255

HIV in the lung is poorly understood. Due to logistical difficulties of obtaining lung samples,

256

most studies on immune responses to respiratory infections have been conducted in

257

peripheral blood with an assumption that circulating cells have similarities with those in the

258

lung. Here, we show that there are significant differences in the global transcriptional profiles

259

between the blood and the bronchoalveolar compartment, and that the immunological effects

260

of HIV infection revealed by whole compartment transcriptomics in the two compartments

261

are different.

262

While a type I interferon signature was the most dominant effect of HIV in PBMCs, a CD8+

263

T-cell infiltrate was the dominant effect in the bronchoalveolar compartment. We also

264

observed a weaker and qualitatively different HIV-associated type I interferon signature in

265

the bronchoalveolar compartment of viremic HIV patients. An elevated interferon signature

266

in blood has been associated with progression to TB disease and could arguably relate to the

267

increased susceptibility to TB disease among HIV patients who have a strong type I

268

interferon signature in blood

269

between the compartments could be due to the differences in cellular compositions. Whether

270

specific lung signatures drive the association of type I interferon signaling with progression

271

from latent to active TB remains largely unknown and can be addressed through the study of

272

the bronchoalveolar compartment in participants who go on to develop TB disease.

The infiltration of the bronchoalveolar compartment of HIV-positive patients with CD8+ T

274

cells has been reported in previous studies. However, there is limited information on its

275

functional nature

276

specific RNA-seq, we show that the HIV-induced CD8+ T-cell infiltrate is associated with

277

higher expression of effector molecules such as granzymes, perforin and interferon gamma,

278

suggesting a cytolytic and inflammatory profile. We also report higher expression of PD-1 on

279

bronchoalveolar CD8+ T cells of HIV-positive patients. PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells has

280

been associated with exhaustion 19. However, in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, PD-1+ CD8+ T

281

cells derived from synovial fluid were metabolically active functional effector memory T

282

cells, suggesting that PD-1 expression could also act as a marker of locally adapted functional

283

T cells 20. Thus, depending on context, PD-1 could be a marker of either exhaustion or local

284

activation in tissues. Even though PD-1 blockade on BLCs-derived T cells from HIV-positive

285

patients was previously shown to boost cytokine secretion in vitro, suggesting exhaustion,

286

there was a counterintuitive increased PD-1 expression among the interferon gamma

287

secreting T cells 18. As such, the implication of HIV-associated increase in PD-1 expression

288

on CD8+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar compartment needs further investigation.

289

The HIV-induced infiltration of the bronchoalveolar compartment with cytolytic CD8+ T

290

cells could be driven directly by HIV replication 21. The lung has been shown to be a site of

291

HIV replication where small alveolar macrophages and CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells are

292

preferentially infected with HIV

293

replication by killing the HIV-infected CD4+ T cells and alveolar macrophages. Indeed, in

294

previous studies, lymphocytic alveolitis in asymptomatic HIV patients was enriched for HIV-

295

specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that could execute such effector functions 18. Whether HIV

296

induces bronchoalveolar infiltration with other specificities of CD8+ T cells that can

297

modulate opportunistic respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis, is unclear.

298

In other settings, CD8 lymphocytic alveolitis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of

299

noninfectious lung complications, such as COPD and emphysema. Considering that HIV

300

infection is also associated with increased prevalence of the same noninfectious lung

301

complications, HIV-induced lymphocytic alveolitis is thought to accelerate the deterioration

302

of lung function in patients who are exposed to other risk factors for COPD and emphysema,

303

such as smokers 21, 23-26. Whether similar bystander destructive mechanisms play an important

304

role in CD8+ T-cell-mediated disruption of the containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in

305

granulomas is unknown. In an immune-competent mouse model, LCMV-specific CD8+ T

306

cells infiltrated Mycobacterium bovis granulomas in the liver, but without conferring any

307

benefit in the control of bacterial growth, suggesting that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in our

308

setting could also infiltrate Mycobacterium tuberculosis granulomas in human hosts

309

another mouse model, LCMC-specific cytolytic CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme B and

310

NKG2D infiltrated Leishmania major lesions and exacerbated disease by causing an

311

exaggerated inflammatory response 28. Infiltrating cytolytic CD8+ T cells in the lung of HIV

312

patients could similarly exaggerate the inflammatory state, disrupting the containment of

313

Mycobacterium tuberculosis in granulomas thus promoting bacterial dissemination. Notably,

314

the CD8+ T-cell infiltrate in our cohorts was characterized by increased expression of

315

granzymes and perforin, suggesting some overlap between the findings in our cohorts and the

316

Leishmania major mouse model 28. Additional studies will be needed to directly interrogate

317

the possible contribution of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the inflammatory destruction of lung

318

tissues and the anatomical dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.

319

We conclude that HIV is associated with a cytolytic CD8+ T-cell infiltrate in the

320

bronchoalveolar compartment. Further mechanistic studies are required to understand the

321

consequences of the infiltration on respiratory infections, such as Mycobacterium

322

tuberculosis, and noninfectious comorbidities, such as COPD and emphysema. Our study did

323

not assess the antigen specificity of the infiltrating CD8+ T cells, although a previous report

324

suggested an enrichment for HIV-specific CD8+ T cells

325

important to determine whether enrichment for CD8+ T cells against respiratory infections,

326

such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs, and the functional competence of these cell. This

327

study was limited by the sample size in the transcriptomic profiling and intracellular cytokine

328

staining. Nevertheless, the data reveal important compartment-specific effects of HIV in the

329

bronchoalveolar compartment, suggesting a possible mechanism by which HIV modulates

330

immunity to respiratory infections and lung function in ways that cannot be revealed by

331

studying peripheral blood. Furthermore, we show the utility of using whole compartment

332

transcriptomic analyses to reveal infiltration of different sites with various immune cells.

333

Methods

334

Study population

335

We studied the effect of HIV on immune function in the peripheral blood and

336

bronchoalveolar compartment using two bronchoalveolar study cohorts at African Health

337

Research Institute (AHRI) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The first cohort was a hospital-

338

based cohort in which we recruited HIV-negative or HIV-positive ART-naive participants

339

(>18yrs) who came for clinical investigations but were determined (after extensive work-up

340

including bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar microbiological investigations) to not have any

341

infectious or inflammatory pulmonary disease. Their clinical indications and final diagnosis

342

are documented in supplemental table 4. Participants were consented for research use of

343

clinically excess BAL fluid and a paired peripheral blood draw. The second cohort was a

344

research bronchoscopy cohort of HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults (18-50yrs).

345

Exclusion criteria included: pregnancy, any history of disease other than HIV, history of

346

antiretroviral therapy (ART), and smoking. Study participants were recruited from

347

KwaDabeka Community Health Centre. All participants were confirmed to be free of

respiratory symptoms and to have a normal chest x-ray. Further, HIV-positive participants

349

were confirmed to have a negative sputum Mtb GeneXpert.

350

participants was determined by 4th generation HIV antibody/antigen Enzyme Linked-

351

Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) testing and HIV RNA quantitative viral load. CD4+ T cell

352

counts were determined in all participants. All participants also underwent assessment of

353

hemoglobin (had at least 10g/dL), platelet level (had at least 100X109 cell/L) and

354

prothrombin time (INR<1.3) to meet safety criteria for bronchoscopy. Once screened and

355

characterized, participants were transported to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital

356

(IALCH) where they underwent research bronchoscopy and paired peripheral blood draw.

357

All participants provided written informed consent. Both study protocols were approved by

358

the University of KwaZulu-Natal Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (BREC; reference

359

numbers BF503/15 and BE037/12) and Partners Institutional Review Board.

The HIV status of all

360
361

Participant samples were selectively subjected (depending on sample availability for different

362

techniques) to differential cell count, mitogen stimulation, monoclonal antibody staining, and

363

transcriptomic analysis.

364
365

Sample processing and differential cell counts

366

Bronchoscopies were performed by pulmonologists at IALCH with participants receiving

367

sedation and bronchodilators according to local standard of care protocols. Two hundred

368

milliliters of normal saline were infused into the right middle lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage

369

fluid was stored at 4 0C and processed in the laboratory within 90 minutes. Paired peripheral

370

blood was collected in acid citrate dextrose (ACD) tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and

371

stored at room temperature. A portion of the sample was directly used for differential cell

372

counts in each compartment after standard preparation and interpretation of peripheral blood

smear and cytospin slide for BAL fluid. PBMCs were isolated using standard Histopaque

374

(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) gradient centrifugation protocols.

375

To isolate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells (BLCs), BAL fluid was passed through a 40 µm

376

filter (BD). The fluid was spun at 1,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4 0C and all cells resuspended

377

in RPMI media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptavidin, 1%

378

HEPES buffer and 1% amphotericin. The cells were freshly used for monoclonal antibody

379

staining and mitogen stimulation to test functionality.

380
381

Flow cytometry

382

The BLCs and PBMCs were counted and assessed for viability using trypan blue (Sigma-

383

Aldrich) and compound microscopy to ensure > 90% lymphocyte viability. To assess

384

distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, immune regulation and functionality of CD8+ T cells

385

in HIV infection, cells from the two compartments were subjected to two panels of

386

fluorescently labelled antibodies. Panel 1 (phenotypic panel): Live/dead-amcyan (Life

387

technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), CD3-BV650, CD4-BV711, CD14-APC-Cy7, PD-1-

388

sequencing were stored in RNAlater stabilizing reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) at -80 0C. Samples

399

were later thawed at room temperature, pelleted and suspended with 1% β-mercaptoethanol

400

RLT buffer from the Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extraction of

401

RNA was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, a QIAshredder column

402

was used to homogenize the samples. DNAse 1 treatment was used to eliminate any

403

remaining genomic DNA contamination. The extracted RNA was quantified using nanodrop

404

and aliquoted into ~200 ng aliquots, adequate for RNASeq library preparation. All aliquots

405

were immediately stored at -80 0C.

406
407

Sorted CD8+ T cell populations

408

For work on purified CD8+ T cells, freshly processed cells from the hospital cohort were

409

sorted into 70% TRIzol LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and

410

stored at -80 0C. Both RNA and DNA were isolated from these samples using the

411

TRIzol/chloroform method with minor modifications. Briefly, RNA was precipitated using a

412

nucleic acid co-precipitant, 5 mg/mL linear acrylamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All

413

reagents were kept at 4 0C to facilitate separation of nucleic acid into different layers and

414

efficient precipitation. QIAGEN RNeasy Micro kit was used to purify RNA from the TRIzol

415

extracted samples. The quality of the extracted RNA was determined using the BioAnalyzer

416

RNA Pico kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

422

primers from the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit were used to label the samples.

423

A subset of the libraries was assessed for acceptable quality using the BioAnalyzer DNA

424

High Sensitivity Chip or the DNA TapeStation (Agilent). Concentrations of the libraries were

425

determined using a Qubit dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Equal molarities of the indexed

426

libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform to yield 75 bp

427

paired end reads.

428

429

Sequencing data analyses

430

The raw data were demultiplexed and processed using Trimmomatic version 0.36 to remove

431

adaptors and leading/trailing low-quality bases. Subsequent analyses were done using the

432

Tuxedo protocol as previously described

433

human reference genome GRCh37 (hg19) using the TopHat module (version 2.1.1) and

434

bowtie (version 2.2.4). The mapped reads were then sorted using the Picard SortSam module.

435

Duplicate reads were identified using the Picard MarkDuplicates module and removed. The

436

Cufflinks module (Version 2.2.1) was used for subsequent analyses. The transcripts for each

437

sample were assembled and the numbers of reads quantified for each transcript. The

438

expression levels were expressed as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million

439

fragments mapped (FPKM). The assembled transcripts for all samples were merged to obtain

440

a master transcriptome assembly (Cuffmerge) followed by assessment of differential

441

expression (Cuffdiff). A statistically significant difference in the expression of a transcript

442

between two groups of participants was defined as having at least a two-fold difference and q

gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/) by checking for enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms among the

448

differentially expressed genes 30. To exclude very large or very small nonspecific GO terms

449

that did not have specific biological implications, an arbitrary cut-off was set whereby only

450

GO terms whose sizes are between 20 and 200 genes were considered in the analyses.

Statistical analyses

453

Comparisons of flow cytometry data and differential counts data between HIV-uninfected

and HIV-infected groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Matched

455

comparisons of flow cytometry data and differential counts data between blood and

456

bronchoalveolar lavage samples were assessed using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank

457

test. Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Comparisons of ratios of

458

participants between groups were done using Chi-square test. All statistical analyses were

459

done on GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc).
