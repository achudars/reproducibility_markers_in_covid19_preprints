Abstract: Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) is a disease characterized by skeletal
muscle wasting, contractures of the major tendons, and cardiac conduction defects.
Compromised skeletal muscle regeneration is predicted to result from impaired muscle stem cell
differentiation. Mutations in the gene encoding emerin cause EDMD. We previously showed
emerin-null myogenic progenitors fail to properly exit the cell cycle, delay myoblast commitment
and form less myotubes. Treatments with theophylline, a HDAC3 activator, rescued myotube
formation in differentiating emerin-null myogenic progenitors. This suggested emerin activation
of HDAC3 activity to reduce H4K5 acetylation is important for myogenic differentiation.
Pharmacological inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) targeting acetylated H4K5 were
used to test if the increased acetylated H4K5 was responsible for inhibiting emerin-null myogenic
differentiation. Nu9056 and L002 were added to differentiating wildtype and emerin-null
myogenic progenitors and differentiation was assessed. HAT inhibition rescued emerin-null
myogenic progenitor differentiation. L002 also rescued myoblast commitment. Increased
concentrations of L002 inhibit p300 and GCN5/pCAF, suggesting H3K9, H3K18 or H3K27
acetylation dynamics are important for myoblast commitment and are regulated by emerin. In
contrast to treatment with these HAT inhibitors, emerin-null myogenic progenitors treated with
SRT1720, which targets SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, showed no significant change in
myotube formation. Thus, we conclude emerin regulation of HDAC3 activity to affect H4K5
acetylation dynamics is important for myogenic differentiation.

Introduction
The nuclear envelope is composed of two lipid bilayers, the outer nuclear membrane,
which is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum, and the inner nuclear membrane [1].
Although the outer and inner nuclear membranes arise from a common membrane, they are
functionally distinct membranes containing proteins localizing specifically to either the outer or
the inner nuclear membrane. Underlying the inner nuclear membrane is a network of Type V
intermediate filament proteins named lamins that provide nuclear rigidity and elasticity [2]. The
inner nuclear membrane contains a large number of integral inner nuclear membrane proteins
[3], many of which show cell-type-specific expression [4-11]. Inner nuclear membrane proteins
function in diverse roles, including nuclear structure, genomic organization, chromatin
architecture, gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization [1, 12]. The
nuclear lamins and its associated inner nuclear membrane proteins define the nuclear lamina.

Emerin is a lamin-binding, integral inner nuclear membrane protein. Mutations in the gene
encoding emerin cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD1), an inherited
disorder causing progressive skeletal muscle wasting, irregular heart rhythms, and contractures
of major tendons [13-16]. Evidence suggests the skeletal muscle wasting seen in EDMD is caused
by impaired differentiation of skeletal muscle stem cells and inefficient skeletal muscle
regeneration. For example, skeletal muscle necrosis and increased skeletal muscle fiber
permeability are rarely seen in EDMD patients [17]. Further supporting this hypothesis, emerinnull mice exhibit delayed skeletal muscle regeneration and repair, motor coordination defects,
and mild atrioventricular conduction defects [18, 19]. Skeletal muscle from EDMD1 and EDMD2
patients and emerin-null mice showed altered expression of muscle regeneration pathway
components [18, 20]. Emerin-null myogenic progenitors and emerin-downregulated C2C12
myoblasts exhibit impaired differentiation and myotube formation [21-23] due to aberrant
temporal activation of myogenic differentiation genes [24] and disruption of key signaling
pathways [25], suggesting defective muscle regeneration contributes to the EDMD skeletal
muscle phenotype [18, 21, 22]. The coordinated temporal expression of MyoD, Myf5, Pax3 and
Pax7 was also disrupted in emerin-null myogenic progenitors [26] due to the inability of the
genome to properly reorganize during differentiation [18, 20, 25]. Emerin binds directly to
HDAC3 and activates its deacetylase activity [27], which is required for proper dynamic
reorganization of MyoD, Myf5, Pax3 and Pax7. The failure of the genome to properly reorganize
during emerin-null myogenic differentiation supports the hypothesis that emerin-null myogenic
progenitors fail to undergo the transcriptional reprogramming required for myogenic
differentiation. It further suggests the regulation of HDAC3 activity by emerin is critical for
transcriptional reprogramming during myogenic differentiation.
Whether H4K5 acetylation dynamics were important for myogenic differentiation was
tested using histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors targeting HATs mediating H4K5
acetylation (e.g., Tip60/KAT5). HAT inhibition rescued emerin-null myogenic differentiation,
showing increased H4K5 acetylation contributes to the impaired differentiation of emerin-null
myogenic progenitors.
2. Results
Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibition rescues emerin-null myogenic differentiation
We previously showed emerin-null myogenic progenitors had impaired differentiation
[23]. This impaired differentiation was rescued by activation of HDAC3. Histone
acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) were used to independently test if the altered H4K5
acetylation dynamics was responsible for the impaired differentiation of emerin-null progenitors.
HATi used for these studies were chosen because they preferentially inhibit acetylation of lysine
residues targeted by HDAC3 (e.g., H4K5)[28]. Cell cycle withdrawal, myosin heavy chain
(MyHC) expression and myotube formation were analyzed 36 hours post-differentiation
induction within the same cell population during differentiation. Emerin-null and wildtype
myogenic progenitors were treated with 0.5 µM L002 upon differentiation induction to test
whether inhibition of H4K5 acetylation rescued myogenic differentiation of emerin-null
progenitors, (Figure 1A). L002 was developed as a specific inhibitor of p300. However, in
addition to inhibiting H3K18 and H3K27 acetylation, L002 also inhibited H4 acetylation in cells at
low micromolar concentrations (0.3 µM)[29]. We confirmed L002 inhibited H4K5 acetylation at
0.5 µM L002 (Figure 2). L002-treated wildtype progenitors exited the cell cycle normally (Figure
1C’, J). 2.7% of emerin-null progenitors failed to exit the cell cycle after 36 hours, as expected

(Figure 1G, J). Emerin-null progenitors treated with L002 showed a trend toward reducing the
number of emerin-null cells in the cell cycle (2.1%; p=0.06; Figure 1G’, J). L002 treatment
significantly increased the percentage of differentiating emerin-null progenitors expressing
MyHC (46%, Figure 1H, K; p=0.015). The number of MyHC-positive cells in L002-treated
differentiating emerin-null progenitors is statistically similar to untreated wildtype progenitors
(47.8% in wildtype, p=0.35; Figure 1D, H’, K), indicating rescue of myoblast commitment. L002
treatment increased myotube formation 1.8-fold in differentiating emerin-null progenitors
(Figure 1 I, L) to completely rescued myotube formation to wildtype levels (p=0.97 for L002treated emerin-null cells vs. wildtype cells; Figure 1E, I’, L).

of whole cell lysates treated with Nu9056 or L002 to analyze H4K5 acetylation during
differentiation of emerin-null progenitors. DMSO-only treatment was the control. Three biological
replicates are shown for each treatment. (B) Densitometry was performed and acetylated H4K5 in
each sample was normalized to total H4 protein in each sample. Levels of acetylated H4K5 for each
condition were normalized to DMSO-treated cells. Results are mean±s.d. of n=3 for each condition.

Wildtype and emerin-null myogenic progenitors were differentiated for 36 hours in the
presence of the HAT inhibitor Nu9056 to independently confirm HAT inhibition rescued emerinnull myogenic differentiation. Nu9056 is a highly specific inhibitor of Tip60/KAT5 [30].
Tip60/KAT5 mediates the acetylation of H4K5, H4K8 and H4K12. Unlike L002, Nu9056 exhibits
greater specificity, as the IC50 of Nu9056 for p300 or pCAF/GCN5 is 20-40-fold higher than for
Tip60/KAT5. 0.5 µM Nu9056 in DMSO or DMSO alone were incubated with wildtype or emerinnull myogenic progenitors upon differentiation induction (Figure 3A). Nu9056 treatment had no
effect on cell cycle withdrawal of wildtype or emerin-null myogenic progenitors, (Figure 3C, G,
J). Nu9056 treatment failed to rescue myoblast commitment, as the number of MyHC-expressing
cells was similar in Nu9056-treated (51.0%) and untreated emerin-null myogenic progenitors
(50.3%; Figure 3H, K). This suggests myoblast commitment results from inhibition of p300 or
pCAF/GCN5 activity with L002. Myotube formation in emerin-null progenitors was rescued by
Nu9056 treatment, as 15.1% of Nu9056-treated emerin-null progenitors fused to form myotubes,
compared to 10.8% of DMSO-treated emerin-null progenitors (Figure 3I, L). Myotube formation
in Nu9056-treated emerin-null progenitors was statistically similar to wildtype progenitors
(p=0.11).

Western blotting using antibodies against H4 and H4 acetylated on lysine 5 (H4K5ac) was
used to confirm L002 and Nu9056 inhibited H4K5 acetylation. We previously showed emerinnull cells increased H4K5ac by 1.9-fold [23]. Treatment of emerin-null progenitors with L002
during differentiation reduced H4K5ac 2.4-fold (Figure 2), comparable to H4K5ac levels in
wildtype progenitors. Nu9056 treatment decreased H4K5ac 3.2-fold in emerin-null myogenic

progenitors (Figure 2). Decreased H4K5ac seen in emerin-null myogenic progenitors treated with
Nu9056 is similar to the H4K5ac levels seen in differentiating wildtype progenitors.
A Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activator was used to confirm rescue of emerin-null progenitor
differentiation was due to changes in acetylation of HDAC3 target residues (e.g., H4K5ac). Unlike
HDAC3, SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that was shown to deacetylate a
number of protein targets within the cell, including p53 and PGC1 [31]. SIRT1 has not been
shown to effect H4K5, H4K8 or H4K12 acetylation [32]. 1.5 µM SRT1720 was added to wildtype
or emerin-null myogenic progenitors upon differentiation induction and differentiation was
analyzed after 36 hours (Figure 4A). SRT1720 failed to rescue cell cycle withdrawal of
differentiating emerin-null progenitors, as 7.0% of DMSO-treated and 5.4% of SRT1720-treated
cells were cycling (Figure 4G, J; p=0.09). 41.1% of SRT1720-treated differentiating emerin-null
progenitors expressed MyHC compared to 42.7% of DMSO-treated emerin-null progenitors
(Figure 4H, K; p=0.49). SRT1720 treatment also failed to rescue myotube formation in emerin-null
progenitors (Figure 4I, L; p=0.44). Western blotting confirmed the levels of H4K5ac were
unchanged by treatment with SRT1720 (Figure 5).

Discussion
The studies presented here used a cell-based system to follow differentiation, in which
myotubes are formed by myoblast-to-myoblast fusion or myoblast-to-myotube fusion. Upon
stimulation of myogenic progenitors to differentiate, transcriptional reprogramming is initiated,
leading to cell cycle exit. This reprogramming activates the myogenic differentiation program
and represses the proliferative program, thereby leading to myoblast commitment followed by
fusion to form myotubes. Transcriptional reprogramming is compromised in emerin-null
progenitors [33]. The failure of emerin-null progenitors to coordinate the temporal reorganization
of their genome during differentiation is predicted to cause this defective transcriptional
reprogramming.
Emerin binds directly to HDAC3, the catalytic component of the Nuclear Co-Repressor
(NCoR) complex [27, 34] and activates its activity. Emerin-binding recruits HDAC3 to the nuclear

envelope. The functional interaction between emerin and HDAC3 coordinates the spatiotemporal
nuclear envelope localization of genomic regions containing important transcription factors that
control the temporal expression of differentiation genes [26, 27]. Loss of emerin disrupts this
genomic reorganization resulting in impaired myogenic differentiation. Activation of HDAC3
rescues emerin-null myotube formation [23, 26]. Nuclear envelope localization of HDAC3 is also
important in cardiomyocyte differentiation [35]. In the absence of nuclear envelope-localized
HDAC3, repressed genomic loci were aberrantly localized to the nuclear interior resulting in
precocious differentiation. Thus, controlling HDAC3 nuclear envelope localization and activation
is an important regulatory mechanism used to regulate differentiation.
The results presented here support the role of emerin in controlling histone acetylation
dynamics by regulating HDAC3 activity. We predict loss of emerin disrupts these dynamics
resulting in failure to coordinate the transcription activation and repression needed for
transcriptional reprogramming at the onset of differentiation. This initial reprogramming event
triggers the coordinated temporal expression of transcription factors required for later
differentiation transitions. Emerin is proposed to play an important role in regulating myogenic
differentiation by regulating chromatin dynamics, since treatment of emerin-null progenitors
with small molecules that restore histone acetylation dynamics (e.g., HDAC3 activators, HAT
inhibitors) rescue differentiation.
Using HATi specifically targeting acetylation of residues deacetylated by HDAC3, we
found HAT inhibition rescued emerin-null differentiation. This recapitulated the rescue seen by
treatment of emerin-null progenitors with an HDAC3 activator. Thus, H4K5 acetylation
dynamics are predicted to be important for ensuring proper transcriptional reprogramming upon
differentiation induction (Figure 6). Similar to HDAC3 activation, HDAC inhibition primarily
affected later differentiation transitions [23], suggesting emerin regulation of HDAC3 activity
controls the temporal expression of these later genes. This may result from failure to completely
reprogram the transcriptome upon differentiation induction or by specifically regulating the
latter steps of the gene expression program.
HAT inhibition and HDAC3 activation rescued the latter steps of emerin-null myogenic
differentiation. This suggests emerin regulation of H4K5ac dynamics during transcriptional
reprogramming may impair the complete reprograming during differentiation to effect genes
that act at the latter stages of differentiation (e.g., myotube formation). Alternatively, emerin
regulation of H4K5ac levels, and thus transcriptional activity, may specifically regulate genes
important for cell fusion or myotube maturation. Consistent with these results, HDAC3
inhibition by RGFP966 blocked MyHC expression and fusion in both differentiating wildtype
and emerin-null myogenic progenitors [23]. We propose H4K5 acetylation levels are tightly
regulated and that increases or decreases in H4K5 acetylation levels impairs the transition from
committed, differentiating myoblasts to myotubes by altering transcription reprogramming upon
differentiation induction. These results support pharmacological targeting of H4K5 acetylation as
a promising therapeutic approach for rescuing muscle regeneration in EDMD.
Interestingly, L002 rescued myoblast commitment, whereas Nu9056 failed to rescue
myoblast commitment, as measured by MyHC expression. Myoblast commitment regulation is
independent of H4K5ac dynamics. Rather, it is likely caused by L002 inhibiting p300- or
pCAF/GCN5-mediated acetylation of H3K18 and H3K27 or H3K9, respectively. L002 was
identified as a p300-specific inhibitor [29]. p300 specifically acetylates H3K18 and H3K27.

However, at submicromolar levels, L002 inhibits H4 acetylation and can inhibit H3K9ac. Thus,
we predict the acetylation dynamics of H3K9ac, H3K18ac and H3K27ac are altered during
emerin-null differentiation to inhibit myoblast commitment (Figure 6). Supporting this
hypothesis, emerin-null myogenic progenitors have less H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 and more
H3K4me3, indicative of more relaxed chromatin [27]. It will be important to elucidate how
emerin regulates the dynamic epigenetic changes occurring during myogenic differentiation to
control the transcriptional programs needed for passage through specific transition points.

Materials and Methods

4.1. Pharmacological treatments
A 1.0 mM stock solution of L002 in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 0.5 µM in
differentiation medium. A 1.0 mM stock solution of Nu9056 in DMSO was added to a final
concentration of 0.5 µM in differentiation medium. A 3.0 mM stock solution of SRT1720 in DMSO
was added to a final concentration of 1.5 µM in differentiation medium. Differentiation media
containing each inhibitor or DMSO was added to induce differentiation of wildtype or emerinnull myogenic progenitors.
4.2. Cell culture
Cell culture of proliferation and differentiation of H2Ks were done as previously described
[23]. Briefly, for proliferation, wildtype and emerin-null H2K myogenic progenitors were seeded
onto tissue culture plates (Falcon cat no. 353046 and 3530003) and maintained at 33℃ and 10%
CO2 in proliferation medium (high glucose DMEM supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, 2% L-glutamine, 2% chick embryo extract, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, sodium
pyruvate, 20 units/ml γ-interferon, ThermoFisher Scientific). The plates were coated with 0.01%
gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to seeding.
Wildtype and emerin-null H2K myogenic progenitors were seeded onto 12 well tissue
culture plates coated with 0.01% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for differentiation induction. Cells were
seeded at 23,500 cells/cm2 in proliferation media for 24h at 33℃ and 10% CO2. Differentiation
was stimulated by replacing the proliferation medium with differentiation medium (high glucose
DMEM with sodium pyruvate, 5% horse serum, 2% L-glutamine, ThermoFisher Scientific). The
cells were maintained at 37℃ and 5% CO2 throughout differentiation.
4.3. EdU assays and immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were treated with 10 µM EdU (ThermoFisher Scientific) in DMSO 2h prior to fixing,
while incubating at 37℃ and 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min
and washed three times with PBS. Fixed cells were then stored at 4°C with 0.1% sodium azide in
PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 20 minutes, washed twice
with 3% BSA in PBS for five minutes per wash and treated with the Click-IT EdU reaction
cocktail for 25 minutes. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature
with 3% BSA with 0.1% Triton X-100. MyHC antibodies (1:20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, H-300
for L002 and Nu506 experiments; 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, B-5 for SRT1720 treatments)
were added and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed
with PBS three times and treated with Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (1:200, C10637;
A11032, ThermoFisher Scientific) at room temperature for 1 hour, washed with PBS and
incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes.
Images were taken using the EVOS-FL imaging system (ThermoFisher LifeSciences) for
experiments with L002. The remainder of the images were taken with the EVOS-FL Auto
(ThermoFisher LifeSciences). All images were obtained using a long working distance 40x
objective. At least three replicates, with each replicate containing three culture wells per group,
were done for each drug treatment. Images from five different sections from each well were
taken, with each section containing approximately 50-200 cells. The total number of cells
analyzed for each experiment ranged between 500-1500.

The cell counter plugin on ImageJ was used to count proliferating cells. The percent of cells
still in the cycle was determined by dividing the number of EdU positive nuclei by the total
number of nuclei. The DAPI and MyHC images were superimposed to calculate the percentage
of cells expressing MyHC. Myotube formation was determined by superimposing the phase
contrast image, which allowed for monitoring nuclei within a shared cytoplasm, with DAPI and
MyHC images. Myotube formation, or the differentiation index, was determined by counting the
number of nuclei in MyHC positive cells that contained three or more nuclei divided by the total
number of nuclei in the field.
4.4. Western Blotting
Differentiated H2K cells were resuspended directly in sample buffer and 50,000 to 100,000
cell equivalents were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The
membranes were blocked either at room temperature for 2 h or overnight at 4°C in 3% BSA in
PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20). Antibodies against H4 (1:50,000; Millipore, 05-858) and H4K5-ac
(1:1,000; Millipore, 07-327), were then incubated either at room temperature for 2 h or overnight
at 4°C. The membranes were washed three times in PBS and incubated with Goat Anti-Rabbit
HRP secondary antibody (1:10,000; ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBST either at room temperature
for 2 h or overnight at 4°C. The membranes were treated with ECL chemiluminescence detection
reagent (GE healthcare, product # RPN2106V1 and RPN2106V20 and imaged using the Bio-Rad
Chemidoc system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Densitometry was done using ImageLab software (BioRad Laboratories) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
