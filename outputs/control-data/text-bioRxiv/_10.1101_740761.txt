Abstract
Macaques are one of the most widely used model organisms in biomedical research. Macaca
mulatta and M. fascicularis are currently being used for toxicology, HIV, diabetes, neuroscience
and psychiatric and psychological disorder researches. Many studies have been conducted on M.
mulatta and M. fascicularis genomes for this purpose in order to understand the genomic
properties of these species. Several M. fascicularis individuals from different geographical
locations and also M. mulatta genomes have been sequenced and studied in depth for the purpose
of understanding the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships between various macaque
populations. But still a gap in knowledge remains for other macaque populations such as the
Sinica group. In this study for the very first time, we sequenced the exome of toque macaques (M.
sinica), an endemic island population of Sri Lanka. Here we confirmed that M. sinica and M.
thibetana cluster together and are closely related, also the three distinct phylogenetic groupings
of fascicularis and sinica. We also found that M. sinica has less number of polymorphisms with
respect to the reference genome M. mulatta signifying the smaller and restricted population size
of this species.

1. Introduction
Macaques are Old World monkeys that belong to subfamily Cercopithecoidea and tribe
Papionini. Humans and macaques shared a common ancestor about 25 million years ago (Kumar
and Hedges 1998). They are predominantly distributed in southern and eastern parts of Asia,
except Barbary macaques which distribute in northern parts of Africa, specifically regions of
Algeria and Morocco (Lavieren 2012). Macaques have been introduced to some countries in the
world where they did not exist. One such example is Mauritius Island, where fasciclaris
macaques were introduced by sailors from Java in the 17th century (Sussman and Tattersall 1981).
Initially macaques were classified into four distinct groups by Fooden (1976), namely silenussylvanus, fascicularis, arctoides, and sinica. Over the years there has been new developments
regarding the categorization of the macaques. Currently the macaques are grouped in to three
main categories, namely fascicularis, sinica and silenus (Delson 1980; Hayasaka et al. 1996).
The fascicularis group consists of four species following Fooden (2006); M. fascicularis, M.
mulatta, M. cyclopis, and M. fuscata. The sinica group consists of M. sinica, M. radiata, M.
assamensis, and M. thibetana (Hayasaka et al. 1996). The silenus group contains lion tailed
macaques (M. silenus), pig tailed macaques (M. nemestrina) and stump tailed macaques (M.
arctoides) (Hayasaka et al. 1996). Li et al. (2010) proposed four groups of macaque species;
sylvanus, silenus, sinica and fascicularis based on 358 Alu insertion polymorphisms.
Macaques are one of the mainly used non-human primates in biomedical research, in
toxicology, research in HIV, diabetes, neuroscience and psychiatric and psychological disorders.
This is because macaques show high genetic similarity to humans (94%; Osada et al. 2015).
Rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) is the most widely used for research purposes, while crab-eating

macaques (M. fascicularis), pig-tailed macaques (M. nemestrina) and Japanese macaques (M.
fuscata) are also used. M. fascicularis of Mauritius Island are commonly used for research
purpose, as they are genetically highly heterogeneous which make them valuable in testing
responses to various drugs (Osada et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2011; Osada et al. 2015). Fan et al.
2014; Osada et al. 2015; Fan et al. 2018 also found that within individuals the proportion of
heterozygous

polymorphisms

are

higher

compared

to

polymorphisms in Mauritius M. fascicularis due to strong population bottle neck.
The main interest of this study is M. sinica, commonly known as toque macaques for the
tuft of hair on top of the head which resembles a hat. This species belongs to the sinica group
and is endemic to Sri Lanka. There are three different subspecies within the island based on their
geographical distribution. M. sinica sinica, M. sinica aurifrons, and M. sinica opisthomelas are
found in dry zone, wet zone and highlands of Sri Lanka, respectively. These macaques have been
studied since 1960s with regards to hematology (Hawkey et al. 1978; Jain 1986), pathogens,
parasites and viruses (Dissanaike 1965; Dewit et al 1991). Hoelzer et al. (1994) identified highly
diverged mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in M. sinica. However, M. sinica genome has not yet
been studied from a comparative genomics perspective. The main reason for this is the
unavailability of genome sequences of M. sinica. Here we attempted to fill the gap of lacking
knowledge and also data by sequencing the exome of M. sinica in order to expand the
understanding of toque macaque genome from an evolutionary and comparative genomics point
of view.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. DNA sequencing
We extracted the genomic DNA from muscle tissue of a male M. sinica reared at Japan Monkey
Centre, Inuyama, Japan (specimen number: Pr6182) using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit This
individual is an offspring of first-degree inbreeding (father and daughter) and the father and the
daughter’s mother are also captive-born but their origin cannot be traced more. The library
construction and sequencing was conducted at Human Genetics Laboratory at National Institute
of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. Three µg of DNA was sheared into fragments with length of 150200 bp using Covaris S2 focused-ultrasonicator. Sequencing library was constructed with
SureSelect XT reagent kits. Target enrichment was constructed with SureSelect Human All Exon
V5 + lncRNA kit. The library was sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, in rapid run
mode with 2 × 150-bp paired-end module. The quality check of the sequence reads was
performed by using FastQC (Andrew 2010) and all reads were above Q30 quality level.

2.2. Other macaque genomes used in the comparative analysis
We used eight macaque genomes to compare with toque macaque exome data; three M. mulatta
(SRR1927155, SRR1929293, SRR1950974) (Xue et al. 2016), one Vietnamese M. fascicularis
(SRA023855) (Yan et al. 2011), one Malaysian M. fascicularis (Higashino et al. 2012), two
Mauritian M. fascicularis (SRR1564753, SRR1564755) (Ericsen et al. 2014), and one M.
thibetana (SRR1024051) (Fan et al. 2014). These 8 individuals (section 2.3) were used

separately for variant calling to determine effects of SNPs on genes of all 7 individuals except
reference. The reason for this separate variant calling (stage-1) with rhesus macaque as
reference is the availability of better quality annotation data for genes for rhesus macaque that
would help in determining the effects of variants on these genomes.
In order to obtain an abstract view on genetic relationships between species, we again called
variants (stage-2) using M. nemestrina as the reference (section 2.4) with an addition of several
other newly sequenced species (M. assemensis and M. arctoides). This was to determine
phylogenetic relationships between these individuals via phylogenetic tree and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). But these species were not considered for down-stream analyses
on SNP effect.

2.3. Stage-1 variant calling for 8 macaque individuals with M. mulatta as reference
Variant calling was performed simultaneously on M. sinica, M. thibetana, two M. fascicularis
(Mauritius), M. fascicularis (Malaysian), M. fascicularis (Vietnam), M. mulatta (Chinese), two
M. mulatta (Indian) genomes. Genotypes were called with the Best Practice pipeline of Genome
Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) (DePristo et al. 2011).

2.4. Phylogenetic relationship between the species used in the study with stage-2 variant
calling with M. nemestrina as reference

In order to construct an elaborate phylogenetic tree with many recently sequenced macaque
species, we remapped the exome reads from M. sinica to the M. nemestrina (GCA_000956065.1)
genome, which would work as an out-group. The choice of reference genome here also removes
mapping bias that might occur by using the rhesus macaque genome as the reference, because M.
nemestrina is expected to be equally distant from the sinca and fascicularis groups. In addition,
we added two recently-determined genome sequences from the sinica group: one M. assemensis
(SRR2981114), and one M. arctoides (SRR2981139) (Fan et al. 2018) into the analysis. The data
of Malaysian M. fascicularis was removed from the phylogenetic analysis because the reads of
the samples were determined by a SOLiD sequencer and would not be suitable for mapping to a
new reference genome. The Neighbor joining tree (Saitou and Nei. 1987) was constructed with
distance matrix determined based on genotype data for the 11 individuals used for this analysis,
using the Phylo package in R.

2.5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Stage-2 variant calling variants that were found in all 10 individuals except the reference (M.
nemestrina) (section 2.6) were used to construct PCA. The filtering and processing of data for
making ped and map files was performed by custom made perl scripts. PCA was constructed
with smartpca program in EIGENSOFT software package (Patterson et al. 2006).

2.6. Divergence time estimation for sinica and fascicularis lineages

Genotype data of all variant and invariant sites were used to calculate genetic distances between
individuals. Evolutionary rate of 1x10-8 per site/per generation and generation time of 11 years
(Xue et al. 2016) was assumed for the divergence time estimation.

2.7. Effect of SNPs
We annotated all variants and also the probable effect or in other words functional consequences
of variants by SnpEff (Cingolani et al. 2012). Gene annotations are based on Mmul_8.0.1.86.
Further we classified the genes in which the high and low impact variants are located for all 9
individuals in the study. The high impact SNP genes were classified by Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) by Huang et al. (2009a, 2009b).

2.8 M. Sinica only heterozygous non-synonymous sites
We looked at the heterozygous non-synoymous sites found only in M. sinica genome. These sites
were analyzed in detail for its effect on the genome. The possible functionality of the genes in
which these sites are found and the disease conditions that can be caused due to mutations were
further looked at.

3. Results
3.1. Exome sequencing of M. sinica and variant identification summary for the nine
macaque individuals
The exome sequencing of the M. sinica was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform and
more than 22,280,000 pair end reads were generated. The reads have been deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive under accession
number PRJNA546445. The average depth calculated for the mapped exome was 50x. A total of
394,202 variant sites were identified for the nine individuals in the study with rhesus macaque as
the reference during stage-1 variant calling. M. thibetana and M. sinica had less number of
polymorphisms. This less genetic diversity is expected in isolated island populations such as M.
sinica. M. sinica is endemic to Sri Lanka which is an island in South Asia but the observation of
less number of polymorphisms in M. thibetana requires further analyses which we will not be
addressing during this study. The small restricted population size and isolation leads to
inbreeding and then again to reduced genetic variation, as with the case of M. sinica. Also lower
genetic diversity can lead to extinction of the species in the long run. With respect to the
reference genome, M. mulatta, we identified 26,126 heterozygous sites (Supplementary Figure 1)
which is relatively lower than for the other species in the analysis. M. thibetana shows a similar
pattern to M. sinica. M. thibetana is also an endemic group to China (Fan et al. 2014). In general
M. sinica and M. thibetana showed considerably high levels of homozygous sites
(Supplementary Figure 1). Among other factors such as mutation rate, natural selection and
patterns of recombination and linkage disequilibrium, excessive increase in homozygous sites
can also be directly related to inbreeding (Gibson et al. 2006) due to isolation and small

population size which can be observed in both M. sinica and M. thibetana populations. One
important consideration is that the DNA sample we used for this study came from an individual
that resulted from inbreeding (father-daughter inbred offspring). This causes the heterozygosity
levels to drop to 75% in the offspring by considering inbreeding coefficient as 25%. In a case
where 0.25 of inbreeding coefficient is considered our results show lower level of heterozygosity
(Supplementary Table 1) than expected. Therefore in this case lower level of heterozygosity
observed in the M. sinica individual should be due to reasons other than inbreeding.
We determined the heterozygous synonymous and nonsynoymous SNPs for each species
or sample. Synonymous SNPs will result in same amino acid as the reference genome and if the
SNP is nonsynonymous it will result in a different amino acid compared to the reference genome
(Supplementary Figure 1). We also determined the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
variants (Table 1) for heterozygous sites. The ratio is slightly higher for M. thibetana and M.
sinica compared to the M. fascicularis and M. mulatta individuals. This finding is plausible due
to the smaller population size of M. thibetana and M. sinica macaques.

3.2. Genetic relations between populations with PCA
The macaque individuals showed clustering pattern where, Fascicularis, Sinica and Mulatta
macaques were in three distinct groups (Supplementary Figure 2). Mauritian Fascicularis
macaques were found to be genetically closer to the Vietnamese Fascicularis macaques. This
result reconfirms findings by Osada et al. (2015). M. thibetana M. sinica, M. arctoides, M.
assemensis clustered together in the PCA signifying sinica group.

3.3. Genetic relations between populations with phylogenetic tree
The phylogenetic tree that was constructed using 11 genomes which included newly sequenced
stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides), Assamese macaque (M. assamensis) showed
clustering of M. sinica, M. thibetana and M. assamensis. This phylogeny also coincides with Fan
et al. 2018 where stump-tailed macaque clusters close to sinica group. It is known that stumptailed macaques have an unresolved genetic relationship with other macaque species, but our
result here agrees with Fan et al. 2014 signifying that stump-tailed macaque is more closely
related to sinica group than to fascicularis or mulatta.

Residing with one of the primary

objective of the study we confirm that Sri Lankan M. sinica and Tibetan macaques belong to the
same phylogenetic group (Figure 1).

3.4. Divergence time estimation for sinica and fascicularis groups
Fascicularis and Mulatta individuals clustered together as the fascicularis group. M. sinica and
M. thibetana individuals were clustered outside of the Fascicularis and Mulatta group (Figure 2).
This finding is in congruence with Jiang et al. (2016) who reported that the Fascicularis group
and the Sinica group clustered into two distinct groups based on 84 Alu insertion polymorphisms.
Assuming a uniform evolutionary rate of 1x10-8 per site/per generation and a generation time of
11 years for macaques (Xue et al. 2016), the divergence time estimated for the M. mulatta and M.
fascicularis group was approximately 1.3 million years which is close to the estimation of Osada
et al. (2008), who estimated that M. fascicularis and M. mulatta shared a common ancestor about
0.9 million years ago. We also estimated that sinica and fascicularis groups diverged about 1.7
million years ago.

3.5. Effect of SNPs
We found that 2672 SNPs were annotated as HIGH impact by SnpEff4.3v across all 9
individuals in this study. The variant effects are classified into LOW and MODERATE effect by
SnpEff4.3v. The majority of the variants belonged to MODERATE classification group.
Interpretation of the LOW and MODERATE classifications is that they have lower phenotypic
impacts on the gene. The numbers of variants in each group are provided in Table 2. We further
classified the genes with high impact SNPs, and this analysis revealed several functional
classification groups. Highest enrichment group contained cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes,
second group contained genes with guanylate binding protein and septin. The third functional
group contained MHC class I and class II genes. CYP enzymes are known to have an impact on
drug metabolism of humans and macaques (Zuber et al. 2002). CYP class of enzymes is also
involved in metabolism of certain anticancer drugs (Kivistö et al. 1995). Guanylate binding
proteins are responsible for cell autonomous immunity and inflammasome activation (Man et al.
2016). The Major Histocompatibility region (MHC) plays a key role in immune response (Karl
et al. 2013) and the third highest enrichment was related to this class of genes (Table 3).

3.6. M. sinica only non-synonymous variants
We found 6614 autosomal heterozygous non-synonymous variant sites only detected in the M.
sinica genome (sinica-specific). At these sites all other individuals used in the study were
homozygous to the reference genome. Chromosome 1, 7, 14 and 19 and 20 showed higher levels
of non-synonymous heterozygous sites compared to other chromosomes (Supplementary Table
1). In order to find if some chromosomes have more non-synonymous variants because of a

biological impact or just because of the size of chromosome we determined the correlation
between the length of the chromosomes and the number of variants found. We found that there
is a slight positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: r= 0.5635) between the number of
sites and the length of the chromosome (according to reference genome chromosome length).
Therefore more sites might not necessarily mean that a particular chromosome went through
more mutations than others.
We conducted the GO (gene ontology) analysis for the genes that harbored variant sites
and further looked at the top 10 genes that contained the most number of variants (Table 4). Of
the top 10 genes with most variants 5 genes were associated with skeletal muscle formation and
mutations of these were causing various diseases associated with muscle formation.
In total, there were 20 HIGH impact sinica-specific non-synoymous mutations and out of
those 5 were HIGH impact loss of function variant sites in 5 different genes (WDR66, TEX35,
ENSMMUG00000043123 (uncharacterized), FHOD3 and RGS6) in M. sinica genome (Table 6).
WDR66, TEX35, and ENSMMUG00000043123 had intron splice donor variants, while FHOD3
and RGS6 had stop codon gain and a start codon loss, respectively that were causing high impact
on the corresponding genes. According to functional annotations and characterization regards to
the human genome, WDR66 is a gene associated with sperm production and mutations in coding
region cause spermatogenic failure, causing infertility. TEX35 is a testis expressed gene. The
splice donor mutations normally lead to single exon skipping and defective protein formation
(Abramowicz and Gos 2018) where the gene is unable to continue with its normal function.
Defects in FHOD3 is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), where the left ventricle of
the heart becomes enlarged to the level that the heart fails to pump blood as normal (GeneCards).
Stop codon gained mutation causes the protein to be short and may lead to loss of function of the

protein. RGS6, which showed loss of start codon, is a gene responsible for regulation of G
protein signaling and mutations cause Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) with large intestine or colon
(Human Disease Database). Start loss mutations result in reduction or complete loss of function
of the protein. Therefore there is a possibility that these genes may have been malfunctioning in
this sequenced sinica individual.

4. Discussion
We sequenced the exome of M. sinica, an endemic macaque species to Sri Lanka for the first
time. This attempt was to close the gap in the availability of sequence data of this species and
also to understand its underlying genomic properties from a comparative genomics point of view.
Here we found that M. sinica shared less polymorphisms with rest of the macaque species used
in the study which included crab-eating and rhesus macaques. Similarly Tibetan macaque also
showed a similar pattern with regards to polymorphisms. There were less heterozygous sites and
also we found that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous SNPs were relatively higher in
two Sinica species. Less genetic diversity is expected in isolated island populations such as M.
sinica. The small restricted population size and isolation leads to inbreeding and then again
reduced genetic variation. Tibetan macaques follow a similar pattern (Fan et al. 2014).
The phylogenetic tree construction and the PCA analysis both showed that Mulatta and
Fascicularis cluster together forming one group, which is documented as Fascicularis group (Li
et al. 2010) and M. sinica and M. thibetana clustered together in forming the Sinica group.
We found that the shared annotated high impact missense mutations of the 9 individuals
used in the study reside in genes related to drug metabolism and MHC region. The non14

synonymous sites found in M. sinica were found in genes related to zinc finger proteins. Also 5
of the the M. sinica only heterozygous non-synoymous sites revealed to have high impact loss of
function effect on the genes they were located.
Here we presented the exome of M. sinica genome and also we looked at the exome
sequences from numerous perspectives, but further analysis and studies on whole genome
sequences of M. sinica genome may reveal a plethora of interesting facts of this rather less
explored island population.

5. Conclusion
For the first time we sequenced Macaca sinica exome with 50x average coverage. This exome
revealed less polymorphisms in the M. sinica genome similar to M. thibetana which is also an
endemic macaque population. This could be a consequence of geographical isolation. The
phylogenetic and clustering analyses revealed that M. sinica clusters with M. thibetana and M.
assamensis, whereas M. fascicularis and M. mulatta form their own distinct cluster. This finding
agrees with the taxonomical grouping standard that had been introduced in the early 1970s’ by
Fooden. Also our result shows congruence with Fan et al. 2018 phylogeny where taxonomically
unresolved stump-tailed macaque showed close genetic relation to sinica group.
