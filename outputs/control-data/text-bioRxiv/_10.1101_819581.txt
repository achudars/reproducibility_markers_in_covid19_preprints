Abstract
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a versatile tool for discovering and
annotating cell types and states, but the determination and annotation of cell
subtypes is often subjective and arbitrary. Often, it is not even clear whether a
given cluster is uniform. Here we present an entropy-based statistic, ROGUE, to
accurately quantify the purity of identified cell clusters. We demonstrated that our
ROGUE metric is generalizable across datasets, and enables accurate, sensitive
and robust assessment of cluster purity on a wide range of simulated and real
datasets. Applying this metric to fibroblast and B cell datasets, we identified
additional subtypes and demonstrated the application of ROGUE-guided analyses
to detect true signals in specific subpopulations. ROGUE can be applied to all
tested scRNA-seq datasets, and has important implications for evaluating the
quality of putative clusters, discovering pure cell subtypes and constructing
comprehensive, detailed and standardized single cell atlas.

Introduction
Tissues are complex milieus comprising various cell types and states with
specialized roles1. Characterizing the property and function of each pure cell type
is a long-standing challenge in biological and medical disciplines. The recent
advances in scRNA-seq have transformative potential to discover and annotate
cell types, providing insights into organ composition2, tumor microenvironment3,
cell lineage4 and fundamental cell properties5. However, the identification of cell
clusters is often determined by manually checking specific signature genes, which
are arbitrary and inherently imprecise. In addition, different methods and even
parameters used for normalization, feature selection, batch correction and
clustering can also confound the final identified clusters6, thus motivating the need
to accurately assess the purity or quality of identified clusters (Fig. 1a).

A pure cluster here is defined as a population where all cells have identical function
and state without variable genes. The importance of purity assessment is
particularly relevant for analyses that aim to discover novel pure subtypes and
further detect the true biological signals. For example, signature genes specific to
a pure subpopulation may be mistakenly considered as the common signals of a
mixture due to less guided clustering and annotation. The purity evaluation could
therefore eliminate such misleading conclusions, potentially aiding our
understanding of cellular function, state and behavior. While pioneering
approaches such as silhouette7, DendroSplit8, and distance ratio9 have been
devoted to determining the optimal number of identified clusters by calculating the
ratio of within-cluster to inter-cluster dissimilarity, they are not comparable among
datasets and have poor interpretability of cluster purity. For example, an average
silhouette value of 0.7 indicates a fairly strong consistency for a given cluster, but
it is still unknown whether this cluster is a pure population or a mixture of similar
subpopulations especially when frequent dropout events occur.
The challenges presented by purity evaluation can be broadly addressed by
investigating the number of “infiltrating” non-self cells and variable genes, which
are suited to the intended areas of unsupervised variable gene detection. Given
its importance, diverse methods10 have been proposed for the quantification and
selection of highly variable genes. In particular, scran11 aims to identify variable
genes by comparing variance to a local regression trend. However, the overdispersion, coupled with the high frequency of dropout events, would often result
in “swamping” of useful information, causing the deterioration of the results of such
variance-based approaches12. Alternatively, Gini coefficient13 could be used to
quantify the variation in gene expression, but the limited performance restricts its
scalability. New probabilistic approaches for variable gene selection using dropout
rates have also been recently adapted14, with the advantage of supporting both
pseudotime analysis and discrete clustering, but their usage of dropout metric
hinder the capturing of the global distribution of gene expression. Although highly
informative genes can also be determined by inspecting their weights during
multiple iterations of dimensionality reduction15, such ad hoc approaches are
computationally intensive and do not provide independent metrics for gene
expression variability.
Here, we present an entropy-based model to measure the randomness of gene
expression in single cells, and demonstrate that this model is scalable across
different datasets, capable of identifying variable genes with high sensitivity and
precision. Based on this model, we propose the ROGUE statistic to quantify the
purity or homogeneity of a given single cell population while accounting for other
technical factors. We demonstrate that the ROGUE metric enables accurate and
unbiased assessment of cluster purity, and thus provides a universal measure to
evaluate the quality of both published and newly generated cell clusters. Applying

Results
Expression entropy model enables sensitive and accurate identification of
variable genes
As scRNA-seq data can be approximated by negative binomial (NB) or zeroinflated NB (ZINB) distribution16,17, we considered the use of the statistic, 𝑆𝑆
(expression entropy — differential entropy of expression distribution, as defined in
Methods), to capture the degree of disorder or randomness of gene expression.
Notably, we observed a strong relationship between 𝑆𝑆 and the mean expression
level (𝐸𝐸) of genes, thus forming the basis for our expression entropy model (𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸
model, Fig. 1b-c). Moreover, 𝑆𝑆 is linearly related to 𝐸𝐸 for the Tabula Muris dataset2
as expected (Fig. 1b), which is characteristic of current droplet experiments, hence
demonstrating the NB nature of UMI-based datasets (Methods). For a
heterogeneous cell population, certain genes would exhibit expression deviation
in fractions of cells, leading to constrained randomness of its expression
distribution and hence the reduction of 𝑆𝑆. Accordingly, informative genes can be
obtained in an unsupervised fashion by selecting genes with maximal 𝑆𝑆-reduction
(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) against the null expectation (Methods).
To illustrate the performance of 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model, we benchmarked our method against
HVG11, Gini13 and M3Drop14 on data simulated from both NB and zero-inflated NB
(ZINB) distribution (Methods). For a fair comparison, we generated a total of 1600
evaluation datasets and used AUC as a standard to test the performance of each
method. As a tool to identify genes specific to rare cell types, Gini outperformed
HVG and M3Drop when there were subpopulations accounting for less than 20%
of the cells. In contrast, HVG was slightly better than Gini and M3Drop in the
presence of cell subpopulations with a larger proportion. Notably, expression
entropy model consistently achieved the highest AUC score and significantly
outperformed other gene selection methods in all tested cases with varied
subpopulation proportions or gene abundance levels (Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Figs. 1 and 2).
To validate our unsupervised feature selection method in real datasets, we
performed cross-validation experiments using random forest classifier (RF)18, with
70% cells from the original sample as reference and remaining 30% cells as query
set (Methods). Intuitively, gene sets that enable higher classification accuracy are

more biological meaningful. Using 14 previously published datasets derived from
both droplet-based and full-length protocols (Supplementary Table 1), we
demonstrated that our method consistently identified genes with greater ability of
classification when different number (30-5000) of genes were selected, followed
by Gini, HVG and M3Drop (Fig. 1e,f and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Specially,
our 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model showed notable superiority when fewer genes (30-100) were used,
demonstrating its sensitivity. Taken together, these results suggest that genes
identified by our model are more informative and biologically discriminating.
Since datasets derived from the same biological system are expected to have
reproducible informative genes14, we tested how our expression entropy model
behave using technical replicates from different tissues (Supplementary Table 2).
Notably, genes identified by our 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model were more reproducible when top 5002000 genes were used (Fig. 1g). In addition, we also considered four pancreatic
datasets (Supplementary Table 3) derived from different technologies and labs.
These real datasets are more complex than technical replicates as they included
systemic nuisance factors such as batch effects. Despite substantial systematic
differences, our model consistently achieved the highest reproducibility score (Fig.
1h), demonstrating that 𝑆𝑆 - 𝐸𝐸 model provides reliable, robust and accurate
identification of informative genes, hence forming the foundation for the
subsequent purity assessment of single cell clusters.
The ROGUE index for quantifying the purity of cell population
Unsupervised clustering is currently the standard method to identify new cell
types19. However, the identification and annotation of a putative subtype is often
arbitrary and lack a quantitative metric for robust purity evaluation. Here, we take
advantage of the wide applicability of 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model to scRNA-seq data and introduce
the statistic ROGUE (Ratio of Global Unshifted Entropy) to measure the purity of
single cell populations (Methods). Intuitively, a cell population with no significant
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 for all genes will receive a ROGUE value of 1, indicating it is a completely pure
subtype or state. In contrast, a population with maximum summarization of
significant ds will yield a purity score of ~0.
We investigated the performance of ROGUE on 1860 cell populations simulated
from both NB and ZINB distribution (2000 cells x 20000 genes each), with 0.1%50% genes varied in a second cell type (Methods). A cell population with both
fewer “infiltrating” non-self cells and varied genes would yield a high purity score,
while a population with converse situation is expected to yield a low purity score.
It is evident that the ROGUE index decreased monotonically with the heterogeneity
of cell populations (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). ROGUE
performed well even when cell populations contained few varied genes (<1%) and
“infiltrating” cells (<1%), indicating ROGUE index provides a sensitive and
unbiased measure in response to the degree of cell population purity. To address

the potential concern that the number of cells may represent an intrinsic challenge
for 𝑆𝑆 and ROGUE calculation, particularly if only few cells are collected from given
samples, we performed down sampling analysis to test how 𝑆𝑆 was impacted by
cell numbers. By calculating the Pearson correlations of 𝑆𝑆 between the randomly
down-sampled datasets and the entire datasets, we found the similarity values
of >0.99 and demonstrated that our 𝑆𝑆 and ROGUE calculation would not be
unaffected by variation in cell number (Fig. 2c).
Sequencing depth can vary significantly across cells, with variation potentially
spanning orders of magnitude2, and hence contributes to a substantial technical
confounder in scRNA-seq data. We sought to investigate whether ROUGE index
can accurately assess the purity of single cell population while accounting for this
technical effect. As test cases, we simulated increasing molecular counts
(sequencing depth) in a second “mock” replicate, with the fold change of gene
expression means ranging from 2 to 100 (Fig. 2d and Methods). Despite the
substantial technical effect, the mixture of each two simulated replicates is
expected to be a pure cell population. Here we used silhouette to measure the
degree of replicate-to-replicate differences. The results revealed ROGUE values
of ~0.99-1 for each population consisting of two replicates, with silhouette values
ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Thus, ROGUE
not only offers a robust and sensitive way to estimate the purity of single cell
population, but also accounts for the variation in sequencing depth.
The ROGUE accurately assesses the purity of cell populations
To illustrate the applicability of ROGUE index to real data, we first considered an
ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium) dataset20 with no biological variability,
which is an ideal case of pure cell population. This ERCC dataset achieved
ROGUE ~1 with only one significant gene. Further, we investigated the fresh
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enriched from a single healthy
donor20. The authors provided multiple cell types purified by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS), and thus representing a suitable resource for purity
assessment. These cell types in Fig. 2g, including CD4/CD8 naïve T cells and CD4
memory T cells, have been shown to be highly homogeneous populations21, and
were detected high ROGUE values (0.94-1) as expected. In contrast, both CD14
monocytes and CD34+ cells are mixtures of diverse subtypes20 and received
relatively low ROGUE values (~0.8; Fig. 2h), thus confirming their heterogeneity.
In addition to highly controlled datasets, it is also instructive to investigate how
ROGUE index performs on pure subtypes identified by unsupervised clustering.
Here we first considered six well defined T cell subtypes from human colorectal
cancer5, which were generated via the Smart-seq2 protocol. All these pure
subtypes achieved high ROGUE values of >0.9 (Fig. 2i), versus 0.78 for complete
data (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We next examined four dendritic cell (DC) subsets

collected from human lung cancers22 and sequenced with inDrop platform.
Specially, tumor-infiltrating DC2 cells have been proven to be highly
heterogeneous populations23,24 and deviated substantially from the other
homogeneous cell types including DC1, LAMP3+ DC and pDC (Fig. 2j). Taken
together, these results illustrate that our ROGUE represents an effective and direct
quantification of cell population purity without being affected by technical
characteristics.
ROGUE-guided analysis enhances single cell clustering and cell type
identification
We next evaluated the potential for ROGUE to guide clustering analysis with
silhouette, which investigates whether a certain clustering has maximized intercluster dissimilarity and minimized within-cluster dissimilarity. As a test case, we
simulated a scRNA-seq dataset consisting of three cell types A, B and C (see
Methods for details), where cell type A and B were similar subtypes with 1% varied
genes. We clustered this dataset into 2, 3, 4, and 5 subpopulations respectively by
adjusting the resolution parameter in Seurat25 (Fig. 3a), then evaluated the results
by inspecting corresponding silhouette and average ROGUE values. Proper
clustering of this dataset should result in three subpopulations, one for each cell
type. However, silhouette received the maximum value when cell type A coclustered with B (Fig. 3b), i.e., when only two clusters were identified, suggesting
that such measure is poorly interpretable for cluster purity as opposed to ROGUE,
which reached saturation when there were three clusters (Fig. 3c). Repeating the
simulation with varied differences in cell type A, B and C yielded equivalent
performance for these two methods (Supplementary Fig. 8a-f). Since ROGUE can
provide direct purity quantification of a single cluster and is independent of
methods used for normalization, dimensionality reduction and clustering, it could
also be applied to guide the splitting (re-clustering) or merging of specific clusters
in unsupervised clustering analyses.
To test how ROGUE could help the clustering of real datasets, we examined a
previously reported dataset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)26, which were
collected from lung tumors. CAFs have been reported to represent a highly
heterogeneous population and may play a tumor-supportive role in the tumor
microenvironment27. We found that the 7 identified fibroblast clusters received low
ROGUE values (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Fig. 9a). We therefore performed
re-clustering analysis with the goal of exploring the extent of heterogeneity and
identified a total of 11 clusters with a higher average ROGUE value (Fig. 3d,e). In
addition to the two classical subtypes of CAFs (myofibroblastic CAFs and
inflammatory CAFs), we also found the presence of antigen-presenting CAFs
(apCAFs) that was characterized by the high expression of CD74 and MHC class
II genes (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The apCAFs were firstly discovered as a
fibroblast subtype in mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but barely

detectable in human PDAC without forming a separate cluster28. The considerable
existence of apCAFs in lung cancer thus may indicate potential differences
between different cancer types.
Furthermore, we noted that the myCAFs (AF_C02_COL4A1, ROGUE=0.81)
identified by original authors could be further segregated into three distinct
subpopulations, including BF_C01_RGS5 (ROGUE=0.87), BF_C02_ACTA2
(ROGUE=0.84) and BF_C03_GPX3 (ROGUE=0.94). Interestingly, the signature
genes of AF_C02_COL4A1 described by original authors were actually specific to
one of these three subpopulations, including MEF2C in BF_C01_RGS5 and
MYH11 in BF_C02_ACTA2 (Fig. 3f). Pathway analysis also revealed that the
NOTCH signaling was activated in BF_C01_RGS5 (Fig. 3g) rather than a common
signal of AF_C02_COL4A126. Despite the considerable increase of overall
ROGUE index, BF_C00_AOL10A1, BF_C04_COL1A2 and BF_C05_PLA2G2A
still received relatively low ROGUE values, thus deserving further investigation.
Overall, ROGUE-guided analysis not only discovered novel cell subtypes, but also
enabled the detection of the true signals in specific pure subpopulations.
ROGUE-guided analysis identified pure B cell subtypes in liver and lung
cancer
B cells are key components in tumor microenvironment but have unclear functions
in antitumor humoral response29. Here we investigated previously reported liver
and lung tumor infiltrating B cells26,30 and found that they received relatively low
ROGUE values (Fig. 4a). Thus, we applied further clustering analysis coupled with
ROGUE to these B cells in an attempt to discover pure subtypes. A total of 7
clusters were identified, each with its specific marker genes (Fig. 4b-d). Cells from
the first B cell subset, B_C0_JUNB, specifically expressed signature genes
including JUNB and FOS, thus representing activated B cells31. The second subset,
B_C1_TXNIP, showed high expression of glycolysis pathway genes
(Supplementary Table 4), indicating its metabolic differences. ACTB, a gene
involved in antigen presenting, was highly expressed in the third subset
(B_C2_ACTB). Pathway activity analysis also revealed a strong antigen
processing and presentation signal in this subset (Supplementary Table 4). The
fourth cluster, B_C3_FCER2, characterized by high expression of HVCN1 and
genes involved in B cell receptor signaling pathway (Supplementary Table 4), was
largely composed of pre-activated B cells30. The fifth cluster, B_C4_MX1,
predominantly composed of interferon induced B cells32, expressed high levels of
MX1, IFI6 and IFI44L. The sixth cluster, B_C5_CD3D, expressed key markers of
both T and B cell lineages (Fig. 4d), thus maybe the dual expressers (DEs)-like
lymphocytes33 or doublets. The remaining B cells, falling into the seventh cluster,
B_C6_LRMP, exhibited high expression of LRMP and RGS13, indicative of the
identity of germinal center B cells34.

Both DEs/doublets-like and germinal center B cells exhibited low ROGUE values
(Fig. 4e), but the limited cells did not permit further clustering. For germinal center
B cells, we readily detected the high expression of proliferating marker genes,
including MKI67 and STMN1 (Supplementary Fig. 10), in a fraction of these cells,
thus explaining the heterogeneity to some extent. In contrast to these two clusters,
we found ROGUE values of >0.92 for each of the remaining five clusters (Fig. 4e),
demonstrating that they were all highly homogeneous B cell subtypes. By
calculating the ratio of observed to expected cell numbers with chi-square test
(RO/E), we noted that both B_C02_ACTB and B_C04_MX1 contained mainly cells
from tumor, with RO/E values > 1 (Fig. 4f). Similar analyses stratified by patient
further confirmed this trend (Fig. 4g). Based on the independent TCGA lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cohort dataset, patients with higher expression of the
marker genes of B_C02_ACTB (normalized by MS4A1; Supplementary Table 5)
showed significantly worse overall survival (Fig. 4h). Such survival difference was
also observed in TCGA liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cohort dataset (Fig.
4i). Thus, the clinical implication deserves further study to investigate what specific
roles B_C02_ACTB cells play in tumor microenvironment. In summary, identifying
pure subtypes with ROGUE-guided analysis could enable a deeper biological
understanding of cell state and behavior.

Discussion
Purity assessment of identified cell clusters is paramount to the interpretation of
scRNA-seq data. This assessment is especially pertinent as increasingly rare and
subtle cell subtypes are being uncovered. To address this computational challenge,
we present the 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model and demonstrate that this model is capable of identifying
variable genes with high sensitivity and precision, and thus could be applied to
both clustering and potentially pseudotime analyses. By taking advantage of the
wide applicability of 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model, we develop the statistic ROGUE to quantify the
purity of single cell populations. Through a wide range of tests, we demonstrate
that our entropy-based measure, ROGUE, is generalizable across datasets from
different platforms, protocols and operators, and able to successfully quantify the
purity of single cell populations regardless of uncontrollable cell-to-cell variation.
When using ROGUE to assess the purity of four DC subtypes from human lung
tumors, we found that DC2 was a heterogeneous population, which is consistent
with previous findings24. Such heterogeneous populations like DC2 may have
different properties and specialized roles in the cancer microenvironment, and
could be assessed in a similar fashion with ROGUE. Accordingly, future studies
could focus on these cell populations and hence may deepen our understanding
of cellular origins of cancer. In addition, ROGUE addresses an important need in
unsupervised single cell data analyses, i.e., to effectively assess the quality of
published or newly generated clusters. Often, unsupervised clustering may lead to
under- or over-clustering of cells due to the lack of universal stands for clustering

quality. By quantifying cluster purity with ROGUE before and after clustering or reclustering, we were able to detect low-purity clusters and perform further analysis
to discover pure subtypes. Improving the purity and credibility of the everincreasing number of cell types is a mounting challenge with explosive efforts
towards single cell sequencing, and ROGUE could become a potential universal
standard for judging the quality of cell clusters.
Our ROGUE-guided analysis on fibroblasts identified a novel subpopulation in lung
cancer, apCAFs, which highly expressed CD74 as well as MHC class II genes and
had a strong antigen-presenting signal. These cells have been speculated to
deactivate CD4 T cells and decrease the CD8+ to Treg ratio in mouse PDAC28,
but have unclear role in the lung cancer microenvironment, hence requiring further
investigation. Moreover, when applying ROUGE to B cell analysis, we found an
interesting pure cluster B_C02_ACTB that displayed high expression of genes
involved in antigen processing and presentation. Cells from this cluster were
preferentially enriched in tumors and were associated with poor prognostic
outcomes in both lung and liver cancer. We therefore hypothesize that these cells
may contribute to immune suppression in the cancer microenvironment and hence
curtail anti-tumor immunity, although further studies are required to define the roles
of these cells. Such approaches for discovering novel or additional pure subtypes
can also be extended to other published or newly generated scRNA-seq datasets.
When determining the purity of cell clusters, we recommend a ROGUE value of
0.9 as a suitable threshold, at which the number of “infiltrating” cells and varied
genes is well constrained. But for low-quality data or continuous data, the threshold
could be determined by considering the global ROGUE values. Although ROGUE
can be very efficient and effective, we anticipate that additional extensions could
enable enhanced performance, for example, assessing the purity of integrated cell
populations from different protocols and platforms. Overall, our ROGUE metric
provides a robust, direct and universal measure for cluster purity in the presence
of substantial technical confounders. We expect the ROGUE metric to be broadly
applicable to any scRNA-seq datasets, and anticipate that our strategy will improve
the rigor and quality of unsupervised single-cell data analysis.

𝑖𝑖 across 𝑛𝑛 cells as:

∑𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗=1�𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �

which captures the degree of disorder or randomness of gene expression37. Given
that genes under 𝐻𝐻0 (non-variable genes) account for the major proportion, we fit

corresponding residual as 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 to improve the performance (Fig. 1b,c). The
significance of 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is estimated based on a normal distribution approximation and
is adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg method. We also extended such procedure
to full-length datasets and found that our approach consistently outperformed other
gene selection methods (Fig. 1f,h and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Data simulation
We simulated droplet datasets with NB distribution. Mean gene abundance levels
X were sampled from the log-normal distribution:
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(X)~N(μ, σ2 )

with parameters μ = 0 and σ = 2. The number of transcripts for each gene were
drawn from:
���𝚤𝚤∙ , r)
𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~NB(X

For each simulated dataset, the dispersion parameter r (r = 𝛼𝛼)41 was set to a fixed
value, ranging from 2 to 10 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, we simulated fulltranscript datasets with ZINB distribution. The dropout rates for each gene was
modeled with the sigmoid function42:
���𝚤𝚤∙ ))
𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ~sigm(−(𝛾𝛾0 + 𝛾𝛾1 X

���𝚤𝚤∙ ). Each simulated scRNA-seq
with parameters 𝛾𝛾0 = −1.5 and 𝛾𝛾1 = 1/median(X
dataset contained 20,000 genes and 2,000 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Differentially expressed genes were added in a fraction of cells (1%-50%,
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), with fold changes sampled from the log-normal
distribution (μ = 0 and σ = 2).

HVG, Gini and M3Drop
The HVG method11 identifies variable genes by comparing the coefficient of
variation squared (CV2) to a local regression trend, and was implemented with the
‘BrenneckeGetVariableGenes’ function in the M3Drop14 package. In the Gini index
model proposed in GiniClust13, a gene is considered as informative if its Gini is
higher than expected from the maximum observed expression. In addition, M3Drop

uses dropout rates for variable gene selection and was implemented with the
‘M3DropFeatureSelection’ function in the M3Drop package.
Cross-validation experiments and gene reproducibility
To illustrate the performance of 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model in real datasets (Supplementary Table
1), we performed cross-validation experiments using RF18 (with 200 trees) from
the python module sklearn29, with 70% of the cells randomly selected from the
original sample as reference and the remaining 30% as query set. The
classification accuracy was measured as the percentage of query cells that were
assigned the correct label. We calculated the reproducibility by intersecting the
corresponding sets of variable genes as:
𝑖𝑖−𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖−𝑛𝑛
∩ 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟−2
𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟−1
Reproducibility =
𝑛𝑛

where 𝑖𝑖 denotes the gene selection method adapted and 𝑛𝑛 is the number of top
ranked variable genes.
ROGUE calculation
By taking advantage of the wide applicability of 𝑆𝑆-𝐸𝐸 model to scRNA-seq data, we
introduce the statistic ROGUE to measure the purity of a cell population as:
∑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = 1 −
∑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝐾𝐾

where 𝐾𝐾 is an important parameter that constrains the ROGUE value between 0
and 1. A cell population with no significant ds for all genes will receive a ROGUE
value of 1, while a population with maximum summarization of significant ds is
supposed to yield a purity score of ~0. We reasoned that Tabula Muris2 can be
considered as such a plausible reference dataset with maximum ∑𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 because
it comprises cells from 20 organs, and thus represents a highly heterogeneous
population. Motivated by the definition of Michaelis constant in Michaelis-Menten
equation, the default value of 𝐾𝐾 is set to one-half summarized significant ds of
Tabula Muris dataset. In this way, ROGUE will receive a value of 0.5 when
summarized ds is equivalent to one-half of the maximum, and hence provides a
universal metric for assessing the purity of given cell clusters. The default value of
𝐾𝐾 is set to 45 and 500 for droplet-based and full-length based datasets,
respectively. The 𝐾𝐾 value can also be determined in a similar way by specifying a
different reference dataset in particular scRNA-seq data analyses.
Silhouette coefficient
To assess the differences of simulated replicates and the separation of different
cell clusters, we calculated the silhouette width7, which is the ratio of within-cluster
to inter-cluster dissimilarity. Let 𝑎𝑎(𝑖𝑖) denote the average dissimilarity of cell 𝑖𝑖 to all
12

other cells of its cluster A, and let 𝑏𝑏(𝑖𝑖) denote the average dissimilarity of cell 𝑖𝑖 to
all data points assigned to the neighboring cluster, whose dissimilarity with cluster
A is minimal. The silhouette width for a given cell 𝑖𝑖 is defined as:
𝑠𝑠(𝑖𝑖) =

𝑏𝑏(𝑖𝑖) − 𝑎𝑎(𝑖𝑖)
max (𝑎𝑎(𝑖𝑖), 𝑏𝑏(𝑖𝑖))

A high 𝑠𝑠(𝑖𝑖) value suggests that the cell 𝑖𝑖 is well assigned to its own cluster but
poorly assigned to neighboring clusters.
Sequencing depth simulation
Sequencing depth can vary significantly across cells and thus contributes to a
substantial technical confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis. To illustrate that
ROGUE is robust to sequencing depth, we generated simulated populations, each
consisting of two replicates with only differences in sequencing depth (Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Fig. 7a). In each simulation, we varied the sequencing depth of the
two replicates as:
𝜇𝜇𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟−2,𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟−1,𝑖𝑖 ∙ 𝛿𝛿, 𝑖𝑖 ∈ {1, … , 𝑛𝑛}

where n is the number of genes, 𝜇𝜇 is the mean expression level and 𝛿𝛿 ∈
{2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 70, 100}.

Generation of simulated cell types
To demonstrate the potential for ROGUE to guide single cell clustering, we used
NB model as aforementioned to simulate different scRNA-seq datasets, each
consisting of three cell types A, B and C (1,000 cells x 10,000 genes each), where
A and B were similar subtypes. For the three scenarios shown in Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Fig. 8a,d, we introduced 500, 1000 and 800 varied genes between
cell type A and cell type B/C respectively, with fold changes drawn from the lognormal distribution (μ=0 and σ=2). In addition, we simulated 100, 100 and 120
highly variable genes between cell type B and C respectively, with fold changes
sampled from a log-normal distribution with μ=0 and σ=1. The results were
visualized using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)43.

Processing and analysis of the fibroblast and B cell datasets
We filtered out low-quality cells with either less than 600 expressed genes, over
25,000 or below 600 UMIs. After filtration, a total of 4,291 B cells and 1,465
fibroblasts were remained. We further normalized the gene expression matrices
using regularized negative binomial regression44 with the SCTransform function in
Seurat25. The top 3000 genes with maximal Pearson residual were used for PCA
analysis. To remove batch effects between donors, we performed batch correction
using BBKNN45 with the first 50 PCs. Using the leiden clustering approach
implemented in scanpy46, each cell cluster was identified by its principle
components. This yielded 11 fibroblast subtypes and 7 B cell subtypes as shown
13

in Fig. 3d and Fig. 4b, which were visualized in 2D projection of UMAP47 with
default parameters.
Pathway and TCGA data analysis
To characterize and detect the pathway signals in specific fibroblast subtypes, we
performed pathway analyses using hallmark pathways from the molecular
signature database48 with GSVA49. The TCGA LUAD and LIHC data were used to
investigate the prognostic effect of 13 signature genes (Supplementary Table 5)
derived from B_C2_ACTB. To eliminate the effects of different B cell proportions,
we normalized the mean abundance level of these 13 marker genes by the
expression of MS4A1 gene, and performed subsequent statistical analyses using
GEPIA250 with default parameters.
