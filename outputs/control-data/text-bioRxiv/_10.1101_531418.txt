Abstract
The DivJ-DivK-PleC signaling system of Caulobacter crescentus is a signaling network

23

that regulates polar development and the cell cycle. This system is conserved in related bacteria,

24

including the sister genus Brevundimonas. Previous studies had shown unexpected phenotypic

25

differences between the C. crescentus divK mutant and the analogous mutant of Brevundimonas

26

subvibrioides, but further characterization was not performed. Here, phenotypic assays

27

analyzing motility, adhesion, and pilus production (the latter characterized by a newly discovered

28

bacteriophage) revealed that divJ and pleC mutants have mostly similar phenotypes as their C.

29

crescentus homologs, but divK mutants maintain largely opposite phenotypes than expected.

30

Suppressor mutations of the B. subvibrioides divK motility defect were involved in cyclic-di-

31

GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling, including the diguanylate cyclase dgcB, and cleD which is

32

hypothesized to affect flagellar function in a c-di-GMP dependent fashion. However, the screen

33

did not identify the diguanylate cyclase pleD. Disruption of pleD in B. subvibrioides caused

34

hypermotility in wild-type, but not in the divK background. Analysis of c-di-GMP levels in these

35

strains revealed incongruities between c-di-GMP levels and displayed phenotypes with a notable

36

result that suppressor mutations altered phenotypes but had little impact on c-di-GMP levels in

37

the divK background. Conversely, when c-di-GMP levels were artificially manipulated,

38

alterations of c-di-GMP levels in the divK strain had minimal impact on phenotypes. These

39

results suggest that DivK performs a critical function in the integration of c-di-GMP signaling

40

into the B. subvibrioides cell cycle.

Importance
Cyclic-di-GMP signaling is one of the most broadly conserved signaling systems in

46

bacteria, but there is little understanding of how this system directly affects the physiology of the

47

organism. In C. crescentus, c-di-GMP has been integrated into the developmental cell cycle, but

48

there is increasing evidence that environmental factors can impact this system as well. The

49

research presented here suggests that developmental signaling could impact physiological

50

processes in c-di-GMP dependent and independent ways. This hints that the integration of these

51

signaling networks could be more complex than previously hypothesized, which could have a

52

bearing on the larger field of c-di-GMP signaling. In addition, this work further examines how

53

much models developed in one organism can be extrapolated to related organisms.

Introduction
Though model organisms represent a small portion of the biodiversity found on Earth, the

56

research that has resulted from their study shapes much of what we know about biology today.

57

The more closely related species are to a model organism, the more that theoretically can be

58

inferred about them using the information from the model organism. Modern genomic studies

59

have given this research an enlightening new perspective. Researchers can now compare the

60

conservation of particular systems genetically. Using model organisms can be a very efficient

61

and useful means of research, but the question still remains of how much of the information

62

gained from the study of a model can be extrapolated unto other organisms. Though genomic

63

comparison shows high levels of conservation between genes of different organisms, this does

64

not necessarily mean the function of those genes or systems has been conserved. This

65

phenomenon seems to be evident in the Caulobacter crescentus system.

66

C. crescentus is a Gram-negative alphaproteobacterium that lives a dimorphic lifestyle. It

67

has been used as a model organism for the study of cell cycle regulation, intracellular signaling,

68

and polar localization of proteins and structures in bacteria. The C. crescentus life cycle begins

69

with the presynthetic (G1 ) phase in which the cell is a motile “swarmer cell” which contains a

70

single flagellum and multiple pili at one of the cell’s poles [for review, see (1)]. During this

71

period of the life cycle, the cell cannot replicate its chromosome or perform cell division. Upon

72

differentiation, the cell dismantles its pili and ejects its flagellum. It also begins to produce

73

holdfast, an adhesive polysaccharide, at the same pole from which the flagellum was ejected.

74

The cell then develops a stalk, projecting the holdfast away from the cell at the tip of the stalk.

75

The differentiation of the swarmer cell to the “stalked cell” marks the beginning of the synthesis

76

(S) phase of the cell life cycle as chromosome replication is initiated. As the stalked cell

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531418; this version posted January 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

77

replicates its chromosome and increases its biomass in preparation for cell division, it is referred

78

to as a predivisional cell. Toward the late predivisional stage, it again becomes replication

79

incompetent and enters the postsynthetic (G2 ) phase of development. At the end of the G2 phase,

80

the cell completes division forming two different cell types. The stalked cell can immediately

81

reenter the S phase, while the swarmer cell moves once again through the G1 phase.

82

Brevundimonas subvibrioides is another Gram-negative alphaproteobacterium found in

83

oligotrophic environments that lives a dimorphic lifestyle like that of C. crescentus.

84

Brevundimonas is the next closest genus phylogenetically to Caulobacter. According to a

85

Pairwise Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) test, their genomes are approximately 74% identical.

86

Bioinformatic analyses showed that all developmental signaling proteins found in the C.

87

crescentus cell cycle are conserved B. subvibrioides (2, 3). However, little physiological

88

characterization has been performed. Conservation of genes does not necessarily mean

89

conservation of function or properties (3). Essential gene studies within the Alphaproteobacteria

90

have shown that gene essentiality/non-essentiality in one organism does not always correspond

91

with that in another organism (3–6). Analyses that have been performed on C. crescentus and B.

92

subvibrioides have shown many similarities in gene essentiality between the two, but have

93

shown several surprising differences as well (3).

94

In C. crescentus, the DivJ-DivK-PleC system controls the spatial activation of one of the

95

master regulators in C. crescentus, CtrA (1, 7). This system is a prime example of how C.

96

crescentus has evolved traditional two-component proteins into a more complex signaling

97

pathway and, as a result, has developed a more complex life cycle. The DivJ-DivK-PleC

98

pathway consists of two histidine kinases (PleC and DivJ) and a single response regulator (DivK)

99

(8, 9). DivJ is absent in swarmer cells but is produced during swarmer cell differentiation. It

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531418; this version posted January 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

100

then localizes to the stalked pole (8). DivJ is required for, among other things, proper stalk

101

placement and regulation of stalk length (8). C. crescentus divJ mutants display filamentous

102

shape, a lack of motility, and holdfast overproduction (8, 9).

103

PleC localizes to the flagellar pole during the predivisional cell stage (10). Though

104

structurally a histidine kinase PleC acts as a phosphatase, constitutively de-phosphorylating

105

DivK (8, 9). C. crescentus pleC mutants display a lack of pili, holdfast, and stalks, and have

106

paralyzed flagella leading to a loss of motility (11–13). DivK is a single-domain response

107

regulator (it lacks an output domain) whose location is dynamic throughout the cell cycle (9, 14).

108

DivK remains predominantly unphosphorylated in the swarmer cell, while it is found mostly in

109

its phosphorylated form in stalked cells. Photobleaching and FRET analysis show that DivK

110

shuttles rapidly back and forth from pole to pole in the pre-divisional cell depending on its

111

phosphorylation state (9). Previous studies have shown that phosphorylated DivK localizes

112

bipolarly while primarily unphosphorylated DivK is delocalized throughout the cell (9). A divK

113

cold-sensitive mutant suppresses the non-motile phenotype of pleC at 37°C. However, at 25°C,

114

it displays extensive filamentation much like the divJ mutant (15). Additionally, filamentous

115

divK mutants sometimes had multiple stalks, though the second stalk was not necessarily polar

116

(15). Furthermore, electron microscopy of divK disruption mutants led to the discovery that they

117

lack flagella (15).

118

Upon completion of cytokinesis, PleC and DivJ are segregated into different

119

compartments, thus DivK phosphorylation levels in each compartment are dramatically different.

120

This leads to differential activation of CtrA in the different compartments (9, 16). In the

121

swarmer cell, the de-phosphorylated DivK leads to the downstream activation of CtrA. CtrA in

122

its active form binds the chromosome at the origin of replication and prevents DNA replication

123

(17, 18). The opposite effect is seen in stalked cells where highly phosphorylated DivK results

124

in the inactivation of CtrA and, therefore, permits DNA replication (19).

125

Gene essentiality studies in B. subvibrioides led to the discovery of a discrepancy in the

126

essentiality of DivK. In C. crescentus DivK is essential for growth, while in B. subvibrioides

127

DivK is dispensable for growth (3, 15). Further characterization found dramatic differences in

128

the phenotypic consequences of disruption. Through the use of a cold-sensitive DivK allele or

129

by ectopic depletion, C. crescentus divK disruption largely phenocopies divJ disruption in cell

130

size and motility effects (8, 9, 15). This is to be expected as DivK~P is the active form and both

131

divJ or divK disruption reduce DivK~P levels. In B. subvibrioides, disruption of divJ leads to the

132

same effects in cell size, motility, and adhesion (3). However, divK disruption leads to opposite

133

phenotypes of cell size and adhesion, and while motility is impacted it is likely by a different

134

mechanism.

135

While the previous study revealed important differences between the organisms, it did not

136

analyze the impact of PleC disruption, nor did it examine pilus production or subcellular protein

137

localization. The work presented here further characterizes the DivJ-DivK-PleC signaling

138

system in B. subvibrioides and begins to address the mechanistic reasons for the unusual

139

phenotypes displayed by the B. subvibrioides divK mutant.

147

for counter-selection. Escherichia coli was cultured on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/L

148

tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L yeast extract) at 37°C. Kanamycin was used at 50 μg/ml,

Mutant generation
The B. subvibrioides ΔdivJ, ΔdivK, and ΔdivJΔdivK mutants were used from a previous

153

study (3). The B. subvibrioides ΔpleC construct was made by PCR amplifying an upstream

154

fragment of ~650 bps using primers PleC138Fwd

155

(attgaagccggctggcgccaCCAGATCGAAAAGGTGCAGCCC) and PleCdwRev

156

(tctaggccgcGCCCCGCAAGGCGCTCTC) and a downstream fragment of ~550 bps using

157

primers PleCupFwd (cttgcggggcGCGGCCTAGAGCCGGTCA) and PleC138Rev

158

(cgtcacggccgaagctagcgGGTGCTGGGATGAAGACACG). The primers were designed using the

159

NEBuilder for Gibson Assembly tool online (New England Biolabs) and were constructed to be

160

used with the pNPTS138 vector (MRK Alley, unpublished). Following a digestion of the vector

161

using HindIII and EcoRI the vector along with both fragments were added to Gibson Assembly

162

Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and allowed to incubate for an hour at 50°C. Reactions

163

were then transformed into E. coli and correct plasmid construction verified by sequencing to

164

create plasmid pLAS1. This plasmid was used to delete pleC in B. subvibrioides as previously

165

described (3).

166

To create insertional mutations in genes, internal fragments from each gene were PCR

167

amplified. A fragment from gene cpaF was amplified using primers cpaFF

168

(GCGAACAGAGCGACTACTACCACG) and cpaFR (CCACCAGGTTCTTCATCGTCAGC).

169

A fragment from gene pleD was amplified using primers PleDF (CCGGCATGGACGGGTTC)

170

and PleDR (CGTTGACGCCCAGTTCCAG). A fragment from gene dgcB was amplified using

171

primers DgcBF (GAGATGCTGGCGGCTGAATA) and DgcBR

172

(CGAACTCTTCGCCACCGTAG). A fragment from gene cleD was amplified using primers

173

Bresu1276F (ATCGCCGATCCGAACATGG) and Bresu1276R

174

(TTCTCGACCCGCTTGAACAG). The fragments were then cloned into the pCR vector using

175

the Zero Blunt cloning kit (Thermo Fisher), creating plasmids pPDC17 (cpaF), pLAS1 (pleD),

176

pLAS2 (dgcB), and pLAS3 (cleD). These plasmids were then transformed into B. subvibrioides

177

strains as previously published (3). The pCR plasmid is a non-replicating plasmid in B.

178

subvibrioides that facilitates insertion of the vector into the gene of interest via recombination,

179

thereby disrupting the gene.

180

To create a C-terminal B. subvibrioides DivJ fusion, ~50% of the divJ gene covering the

181

3' end was amplified by PCR using primers BSdivJgfpF

182

(CCTCATATGGGTTTACGGGGCCTACGGG) and BSdivJgfpR

183

(CGAGAATTCGAGACGGTCGGCGACGGTCCTG), and cloned into the pGFPC-2 plasmid

184

(21), creating plasmid pPDC11. To create a C-terminal B. subvibrioides PleC fusion, ~50% of

185

the pleC gene covering the 3' end was amplified by PCR using primers BSpleCgfpF

186

(CAACATATGCCAGAAGGACGAGCTGAACCGC) and BSpleCgfpR

187

(TTTGAATTCGAGGCCGCCCGCGCCTGTTGTTG), and cloned into the pGFPC-2 plasmid,

188

creating plasmid pPDC8. These plasmids are non-replicative in B. subvibrioides and therefore

189

integrate into the chromosome by homologous recombination at the site of each targeted gene.

190

The resulting integration creates a full copy of gene under the native promoter that produces a

191

protein with C-terminal GFP tag, and a ~50% 5' truncated copy with no promoter. This

192

effectively creates a strain where the tagged gene is the only functional copy.

193

Due to the small size of the divK gene, a region including the divK gene and ~500 bp of

194

sequence upstream of divK was amplified using primers BSdivKgfpF

195

(AGGCATATGCCAGCGACAGGGTCTGCACC) and BSdivKgfpR

196

(CGGGAATTCGATCCCGCCAGTACCGGAACGC) and cloned into pGFPC-2, creating

197

plasmid pPDC27. After homologous recombination into the B. subvibrioides genome, two

198

copies of the divK gene are produced, both under the native promoter, one of which encodes a

199

protein C-terminally fused to GFP.

200

Constructs expressing E. coli ydeH under IPTG induction on a medium copy (pTB4) and

201

low copy (pSA280) plasmids were originally published in (22). Constructs expressing

Transposon mutagenesis

206

Transposon mutagenesis was performed on the B. subvibrioides ΔdivK mutant using the

207

EZ-Tn5 <KAN-2> TNP transposome (Epicentre). B. subvibrioides ΔdivK was grown overnight

208

in PYE to an OD600 of about 0.07 [quantified with a Themo Nanodrop 2000 (Themo Scientific)].

209

Cells (1.5 ml) were centrifuged 15,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was

210

then resuspended in 1 ml of water before being centrifuged again. This process was repeated.

211

Cells were resuspended in 50 µl of nuclease free water, to which 0.2 µl of transposome was

212

added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The mixture was added

213

to a Gene Pulser Cuvette with a 0.1 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad). The cells were then

electroporated as performed previously (3). Electroporation was performed using a GenePulser

215

Xcell (Bio-Rad) at a voltage of 1,500 V, a capacitance of 25 µF, and a resistance of 400 Ω. After

216

electroporation, cells were resuspended with 1 ml of PYE then incubated shaking at 30°C for 3

217

hours. Cells were diluted 3-fold then spread on PYE + Kan plates (100 µl/plate). Plates were

Swarm assay
Strains were grown overnight in PYE, diluted to an OD600 of 0.02, and allowed to grow

222

for two doublings (to OD600 of ~0.06 - 0.07). All strains were diluted to OD600 = 0.03 and 1 µl of

223

culture was injected into a 0.3% agar PYE plate. Isopropyl 1-thio-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG)

224

(final concentration 1500 µM) and vanillate (final concentration 1 M) was added to plate mixture

225

before pouring plates where applicable. Molten 0.3% agar in PYE (25 ml) was poured in each

226

plate. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 days. Plates were imaged using a BioRad ChemiDoc

227

MP Imaging System with Image Lab software. Swarm size was then quantified in pixels using

228

ImageJ software. Assays were performed in triplicate and average and standard deviation were

for two doublings (to OD600 of ~0.06 - 0.07). All strains were diluted to OD600 = 0.05, at which

234

time 0.5 ml of each strain was inoculated into a well of a 24-well dish and incubated at 30°C for

235

238

washed by dunking in a tub of deionized water. Crystal violet bound to biomass was eluted with

239

0.5 ml acetic acid and the A589 was quantified using a Themo Nanodrop 2000 (Themo

240

Scientific). Averages for each strain were calculated and then normalized to wild-type values

to calculate average and standard deviation.

Lectin-binding assay and microscopy conditions
Holdfast staining was based on the protocol of (24). Strains of interest were grown

246

overnight in PYE to an OD600 of 0.05 – 0.07. For each strain, 200 µl of culture were incubated

247

in a centrifuge tube with 2 µl of Alexafluor 488 (GFP imaging conditions, Molecular Probes) for

248

20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed with 1 ml of sterile water then centrifuged

249

15,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of sterile

250

water. A 1% agarose pad (agarose in H2 0) was prepared for each strain on a glass slide to which

251

1 µl of culture was added. Slides were then examined and photographed using an Olympus IX81

252

microscope by phase contrast and epifluorescence microscopy at appropriate wavelengths.

253

Holdfast of GFP-labeled strains were stained with Alexafluor 594 (RFP imaging

Surface water samples from freshwater bodies were collected from several sources in

260

Lafayette County, Mississippi in 50 ml sterile centrifuge tubes and kept refrigerated. Samples

261

were passed through 0.45 m filters to remove debris and bacterial constituents. To isolate

phage, 100 l of filtered water was mixed with 200 l mid-exponential B. subvibrioides cells and

263

added to 2.5 ml PYE with molten 0.5% agar. The solution was poured onto PYE agar plates,

264

allowed to harden, and then incubated at room temperature (~22oC) for 2 days. Plaques were

265

excised with a sterile laboratory spatula and placed into sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. 500 l

266

PYE was added and the sample was refrigerated overnight to extract phage particles from the

267

agar. To build a more concentrated phage stock, the soft-agar plating was repeated with

268

extracted particles. Instead of excising plaques, 5 ml of PYE was added to the top of the plate

269

and refrigerated overnight. The PYE/phage solution was collected and stored in a foil-wrapped

270

sterile glass vial, and 50 l chloroform was added to kill residual bacterial cells. Phage solutions

271

were stored at 4oC.

Isolation of phage resistant mutants.
B. subvibrioides was mutagenized with EZ-Tn5 transposome as described above. After

275

electroporation, cells were grown for 3 hr without selection, followed by 3 hr with kanamycin

276

selection. Transformed cells (100 l) were mixed with 100 l phage stock (~1 x 1010 pfu/ml)

277

and plated on PYE agar medium with kanamycin. Colonies arose after ~5 days and were

278

transferred to fresh plates. Transformants had their genomic DNA extracted using the Bactozol

279

kit (Molecular Research Center). Identification of the transposon insertion sites was performed

280

using Touchdown PCR (25), with transposon specific primers provided in the EZ-Tn5 kit.

Phage sensitivity assays.
Two different phage sensitivity assays were used. First (hereafter referred to as the

284

spotting assay) involved the mixing of cells and phage in liquid suspension and then spotting

285

droplets on an agar surface. Each cell culture was normalized to OD600 = 0.03. The culture was

286

then diluted 10-2, 10-4 and 10-5 in PYE medium. For control assays, 5 l of each cell suspension

287

(including undiluted) was mixed with 5 l PYE, then 5 l of this mixture was spotted onto PYE

288

plates, allowed to dry, then incubated at room temperature for 2 days. For the phage sensitivity

289

assays, 5 l of each cell suspension was mixed with 5 l of phage stock (~1 x 1010 pfu/ml), 5 l

290

spotted onto PYE plates, allowed to dry, then incubated at room temperature for 2 days.

291

The second assay (hereafter referred to as the soft agar assay) involved creating a lawn of

292

cells and spotting dilutions of phage on the lawn. Cell cultures were normalized to OD600 = 0.03

293

and 200 l of cells were mixed with 4.5 ml PYE with molten 0.5% agar, mixed, poured onto a

294

PYE agar plate, and allowed to harden. Phage stock (~1 x 1010 pfu/ml) was diluted in PYE

295

media as individual 10X dilutions to a total of 10-7 dilution. 5 l of each phage concentration

296

(10-1 to 10-7, 7 concentrations total) were spotted on top of the soft agar surface and allowed to

297

dry. Plates were incubated 2 days at room temperature.

Swarm suppressor screen

300

Individual colonies from a transposon mutagenesis were collected on the tip of a thin

301

sterile stick and inoculated into a 0.3% agar PYE plate. Wild-type B. subvibrioides strains as

302

well as B. subvibrioides ΔdivK were inoculated into each plate as controls. 32 colonies were

303

inoculated into each plate including the 2 controls. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 days.

304

Plates were then examined for strains that had expanded noticeably further than the parent divK

305

strain from the inoculation point. Those strains of interest were then isolated for further testing.

306
307

Identification of swarm suppressor insertion sites.

308

Swarm suppressor insertion sites were identified by Inverse PCR (iPCR, (26)). Genomic

309

DNA (gDNA) was purified using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Digests were then

310

prepared using 1 µg of gDNA and either AluI or HhaI incubated overnight at 37°C. Digests were

311

heat inactivated for 20 minutes at 80°C then column cleaned using the DNA Clean and Concen-

312

trator kit (Zymo Research). Dilute ligations (100-500 ng DNA) were then prepared so that di-

313

gested fragments would likely circularize. Ligations were incubated at 17°C overnight. Reac-

314

tions were heat inactivated at 65°C for 20 minutes then column cleaned using the DNA Clean

315

and Concentrator kit. The ligated DNA was used as the template in a PCR reaction with primers

316

that anneal inside the transposon sequence. Primers used included AluIF (GCGTT-

317

GCCAATGATGTTACAGATGAG) and AluIR (GCCCGACATTATCGCGAGCCC) as well as

318

HhaIF2 (TTACGCTGACTTGACGGGAC) and HhaIR2 (GGAGAAAACTCACCGAGGCA).

319

Given the large size of the resulting AluI fragment from the transposon sequence alone, another

320

primer AluIFSeq (CGGTGAGTTTTCTCCTTCATTACAG) was designed specifically for se-

321

quencing after iPCR was complete. Primers were designed facing outward toward either end of

322

the transposon such that the resulting PCR amplicon would be fragments that begin and end with

323

transposon sequence with gDNA in between. PCR reactions were prepared using 10.75 µl H20,

324

5 µl HF buffer (BioRad), 5 µl combinational enhancer solution (2.7 M betaine, 6.7 mM DTT,

325

6.7% DMSO, 55 µg/mL BSA), 1 µl of template DNA from each ligation, 1 µl each of their re-

326

spective forward and reverse primers (primers based on what enzyme was used during diges-

tion), 1 µl of 10 mM dNTP’s (BioLine), and 0.25 µl iProof (BioRad). PCR conditions were as

328

follows. Initial melt was set to 98°C for 30 seconds. Melting temperature was set to 98°C for 45

329

seconds, annealing temperature was set to 52°C for 20 seconds, extension temperature was set to

330

72°C for 2:30 seconds. and these three steps were cycled through 30 times. Final extension tem-

331

perature was set to 72°C for 10 minutes. 5 µl from each reaction were run on a 1% agarose gel

332

to check for fragments. Those reactions that tested positive for bands were drop dialyzed using

333

0.025 µm membrane filters (Milllipore) then prepared for sequencing with their respective pri-

334

mers. Samples were sent to Eurofins for sequencing.

335
336

Quantification of c-di-GMP.

337

Strains of interest were grown overnight in PYE to an OD600 of 0.05 – 0.07. Metabolites

338

were then extracted from each sample and c-di-GMP was quantified using the protocol previous-

339

ly described in (27). Metabolites from each strain were extracted in triplicate. Remaining cellu-

340

lar material was dried at room temperature and resuspended in 800 µL 0.1M NaOH. Samples

341

were incubated at 95°C for 15 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C,

342

20,800 x g. Protein levels were measured in triplicate for each sample using 10 µl from the pel-

343

let treatment and the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Intracellular

344

concentrations measured by mass spectrometry were then normalized to protein levels.

Results
Deletion mutants in the B. subvibrioides DivJ-DivK-PleC system result in varied

348

phenotypes compared to that of analogous C. crescentus mutations. In the previous study

349

done in Brevundimonas subvibrioides, deletion mutants of the genes divJ, divK, and a divJdivK

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531418; this version posted January 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

350

double mutant were made and partially characterized, uncovering some starkly different

351

phenotypes compared to the homologous mutants in C. crescentus. However, characterization of

352

this system was not complete as it did not extend to a key player in this system: PleC. As

353

previously mentioned, C. crescentus pleC mutants display a lack of motility, pili, holdfast, and

354

stalks (28). To begin examining the role of PleC in B. subvibrioides, an in-frame deletion of the

355

pleC gene (Bresu_0892) was created. This strain, along with the previously published divJ,

356

divK, and divJdivK strains, were used in a swarm assay to analyze motility. All mutant strains

357

displayed reduced motility in swarm agar compared to the wild-type (Figure 1A). This had been

358

reported for the published strains (3). The mechanistic reasons for this are unclear. All were

359

observed to produce flagella and were seen to swim when observed microscopically. The divJ

360

strain has significantly filamentous cell shape which is known to inhibit motility through soft

361

agar, but the divK and divJdivK strains actually have shorter than wild-type cells. The nature of

362

the pleC motility defect is also unknown. The cell size of the pleC mutants was not noticeably

363

different from that of wild-type cells (Figure 1B). The C. crescentus pleC mutant is known to

364

have a paralyzed flagellum which leads to a null motility phenotype, but B. subvibrioides pleC

365

mutants were observed swimming under the microscope suggesting that unlike C. crescentus

366

their flagellum remains functional. While the mechanistic reason for this discrepancy is

367

unknown, it does provide another important difference in developmental signaling mutants

368

between the two organisms.

369

To further the phenotypic characterization, these strains were analyzed for the surface

370

adhesion properties using both a short-term adhesion assay as well as staining holdfast material

371

with a fluorescently-conjugated lectin. As previously reported, the divK and divJdivK strains had

372

minimal adhesion and no detectable holdfast material (Figure 1AB). It was previously reported

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531418; this version posted January 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

373

that the divJ strain had increased adhesion over wild-type, but in this study, it was found to have

374

slightly reduced adhesion compared to wild-type. It is not clear if this difference is significant.

375

The pleC strain had reduced adhesion compared to wild-type, but more adhesion compared to the

376

divK or divJdivK strains. When analyzed by microscopy, the pleC strain was found to still

377

produce detectable holdfast, which is a difference from the C. crescentus pleC strain where

378

holdfast was undetectable (28, 29).

379

An important component to the function of this signaling system is the subcellular

380

localization of DivJ and PleC to the stalked and flagellar poles respectively. As the localization

381

of these proteins had yet to be characterized in B. subvibrioides, GFP-tagged constructs were

382

generated such that the tagged versions were under native expression. Because B. subvibrioides

383

cells very rarely produce stalks under nutrient-replete conditions (30), holdfast material was

384

stained using a WGA lectin conjugated with a fluorophore that uses RFP imaging conditions. As

385

seen in Figure 1C, DivJ-GFP formed foci at the same pole as the holdfast, while PleC-GFP

386

formed foci at poles opposite holdfast. As it has been demonstrated that holdfast material is

387

produced at the same pole as the stalk in B. subvibrioides (30), this result suggests that these

388

proteins demonstrate the same localization patterns as their C. crescentus counterparts.

389

Additionally, DivK-GFP was seen to form bipolar foci in predivisional cells (Figure 1C), the

390

same as C. crescentus DivK. Therefore, while the phenotypic consequences of signaling protein

391

disruption vary between these organisms, the localization patterns of the proteins are consistent.

392

Isolation of a bacteriophage capable of infecting B. subvibrioides. Another important

393

developmental event in C. crescentus is the production of pili at the flagellar pole coincident

394

with cell division. Pili are very difficult to visualize, and in C. crescentus the production of pili

395

in strains of interest can be assessed with the use of the bacteriophage CbK, which infects the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531418; this version posted January 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

396

cell using the pilus. Resistance to the phage indicates the absence of pili. However,

397

bacteriophage that infect C. crescentus do not infect B. subvibrioides (data not shown) despite

398

their close relation. In an attempt to develop a similar tool for B. subvibrioides, a phage capable

399

of infecting this organism was isolated.

400

Despite the fact that B. subvibrioides was isolated from a freshwater pond in California

401

over 50 years ago (4), a phage capable of infecting the bacterium was isolated from a freshwater

402

pond in Lafayette County, Mississippi. This result is a testament to the ubiquitous nature of

403

Caulobacter and Brevundimonas species in freshwater environments all over the globe. This

404

phage has been named Delta, after the state’s famous Mississippi Delta region. To determine the

405

host range for this phage, it was tested against multiple Brevundimonas species (Figure 2A).

406

Delta has a relatively narrow host range, causing the largest reduction of cell viability in B.

407

subvibrioides and B. aveniformis, with some reduction in B. basaltis and B. halotolerans as well.

408

None of the other 14 Brevundimonas species showed any significant reduction in cell viability.

409

Neither did Delta show any infectivity toward C. crescentus (data not shown). While B.

410

subvibrioides, B. aveniformis, and B. basaltis all belong to the same sub-clade within the

411

Brevundimonas genus (P. Caccamo, Y.V. Brun, personal communication), so do B.

412

kwangchunensis, B. alba and B. lenta, all of which are more closely related to B. subvibrioides

413

than B. aveniformis and all of which were resistant to the phage. Therefore, infectivity does not

414

appear to fall along clear phylogenetic lines and may be determined by some other factor.

415

To begin identifying the infection mechanism of Delta, B. subvibrioides was randomly

416

mutagenized with a Tn5 transposon and resulting transformants were mixed with Delta to select

417

for transposon insertions conferring phage resistance as a way to identify the phage infection

418

mechanism. Phage resistant mutants were readily obtained and maintained phage resistance

419

when rescreened. A number of transposon insertion sites were sequenced and several were

420

found in the pilus biogenesis cluster homologous to the C. crescentus flp-type pilus cluster. In-

421

sertions were found in the homologs for cpaD, cpaE and cpaF; it is known disruption of cpaE in

422

C. crescentus abolishes pilus formation and leads to CbK resistance (2, 3, 31–33). A targeted

423

disruption was made in cpaF and tested for phage sensitivity by the soft agar assay (Figure 2B).

424

The cpaF disruption caused complete resistance to the phage. The fact that multiple transposon

425

insertions were found in the pilus cluster and that the cpaF disruption leads to phage resistance

426

strongly suggest that Delta utilizes the B. subvibrioides pilus as part of its infection mechanism.

427

The identification of another pili-tropic phage is not surprising as pili are major phage targets in

428

multiple organisms.

429

Phage Delta was used to assess the potential pilis production in developmental signaling

430

mutants using the soft agar assay (Figure 2C). The divJ mutant has similar susceptibility to

431

Delta as the wild-type, suggesting this strain still produces pili. This result is consistent with the

432

C. crescentus result as the C. crescentus divJ mutant is CbK susceptible (8). Conversely, the B.

433

subvibrioides pleC mutant shows a clear reduction in susceptibility to Delta, indicating that this

434

strain is deficient in pilus production. If so, this would also be consistent with the C. crescentus

435

pleC mutant which is resistant to CbK (8, 28). With regards to the divK strain, if that mutant

436

were to follow the C. crescentus model it should demonstrate the same susceptibility as the divJ

437

strain. Alternatively, as the divK strain has often demonstrated opposite phenotypes to divJ in B.

438

subvibrioides, one might predict it to demonstrate resistance to Delta. As seen in Figure 2C, the

439

divK strain (and the divJdivK strain) shows the same level of resistance to phage Delta as the

440

pleC mutant. Therefore, in regards to phage sensitivity, the divK strain is once again opposite of

441

the prediction of the C. crescentus model. Interestingly, none of these developmental signaling

442

mutants demonstrate complete resistance to Delta as seen in the cpaF strain. This result suggests

443

that these mutations impact pilus synthesis, but does not abolish it completely.

444

A suppressor screen identifies mutations related to c-di-GMP signaling. As the B.

445

subvibrioides divK mutant displays the most unusual phenotypes with regard to the C. crescentus

446

model, this strain was selected for further analysis. Complementation of divK was attempted by

447

expressing wild-type DivK from an inducible promoter on a replicating plasmid, however

448

induction failed to complement any of the divK phenotypes (data not shown), indicating proper

449

complementation conditions have not yet been identified. Transposon mutagenesis was

450

performed on this strain and mutants were screened for those that restore motility. Two mutants

451

were found (Bresu_1276 and Bresu_2169) that restored motility to the divK strain, and

452

maintained this phenotype when recreated by plasmid insertional disruption. Both mutants were

453

involved in c-di-GMP signaling. The C. crescentus homolog of the Bresu_1276 gene, CC3100

454

(42% identical to Bresu_1276), was recently characterized in a subcluster of CheY-like response

455

regulators and renamed CleD (34). Function of CleD is, at least in part, initiated by binding c-di-

456

GMP via an arginine-rich residue with high affinity and specificity for c-di-GMP (34). Upon

457

binding, roughly 30% of CleD localizes to the flagellated pole of the swarmer cell. Nesper et. al

458

suggests that CleD may bind directly to the flagellar motor switch protein, FliM. Based upon

459

these findings, it was hypothesized that increased c-di-GMP levels cause activation of CleD,

460

which binds to the flagellar switch and inhibits flagellar function. In C. crescentus, cleD mutants

461

are 150% more motile while their adhesion does not differ significantly from that of the wild-

462

type. Unlike conventional response regulators, the phosphoryl-receiving aspartate is replaced

463

with a glutamate in CleD. In other response regulators, replacement of the aspartate with a

464

glutamate mimics the phosphorylated state and locks the protein in an active conformation.

465

Alignment of CleD with orthologs from various Caulobacter and Brevundimonas species

466

demonstrated that this was a conserved feature of CleD within this clade (Figure 3). Similar to

467

C. crescentus, the swarm size of B. subvibrioides cleD mutant increased to 151% compared to

468

wild-type. However, unlike C. crescentus the cleD disruption reduced adhesion by 35%

469

compared to wild-type (Figure 4A). A knockout of cleD in the divK background led to a

470

complete restoration of motility compared to that of wild-type, while adhesion did not appear to

471

be affected. These phenotypes correspond relatively well with the model given in Nesper et al.

472

A cell lacking CleD would have decreased flagellar motor disruption leading to an increase in

473

motility and a delay in surface attachment.

474

Bresu_2169 is the homolog of the well-characterized C. crescentus diguanylate cyclase,

475

DgcB (61% identical amino acid sequence). In C. crescentus, DgcB is one of two major

476

diguanylate cyclases that work in conjunction to elevate c-di-GMP levels which in turn helps

477

regulate the cell cycle, specifically in regards to polar morphogenesis (35). It has been shown

478

that a dgcB mutant causes adhesion to drop to nearly 50% compared to wild-type while motility

479

was elevated to almost 150%. It was unsurprising to find very similar changes in phenotypes in

480

the dgcB mutant in wild-type B. subvibrioides. In the dgcB mutant, swarm expansion increased

481

by 124% while adhesion dropped to only 46% compared to wild-type (Figure 4A). Though the

482

dgcB mutant did not restore motility to wild-type levels in the divK background, the insertion did

483

cause the swarm to expand nearly twice as much as that of the divK parent. These phenotypes

484

are consistent with our current understanding of c-di-GMP’s role in the C. crescentus cell cycle.

485

As c-di-GMP builds up in the cell, it begins to make the switch from its motile phase to its

486

sessile phase. Deleting a diguanylate cyclase therefore should prolong the swarmer cell stage,

487

thereby increasing motility and decreasing adhesion.

488

A pleD mutant lacks hypermotility in divK background. Given the identification of

489

dgcB in the suppressor screen, it was of note that the screen did not identify the other well-

490

characterized diguanylate cycle involved in the C. crescentus cell cycle, PleD. PleD is an

491

atypical response regulator with two receiver domains in addition to the diguanylate cyclase

492

domain (36, 37). The pleD mutant in C. crescentus has been shown to suppresses the pleC

493

motility defect in C. crescentus which led to its initial discovery alongside divK (22, 36, 37).

494

However, in a wild-type background, pleD disruption has actually been shown to reduce motility

495

to about 60% compared to wild-type (22, 35). Additionally, a 70% reduction in adhesion is

496

observed in pleD mutants which is thought to be a result of delayed holdfast production (22, 35,

497

38). Therefore, it was not clear whether a pleD disruption would lead to motility defect

498

suppression in a divK background. To examine this, a pleD disruption was made in both the

499

wild-type and divK B. subvibrioides strains (Figure 4A).

500

In wild-type B. subvibrioides, pleD disruption caused hypermotility with swarms

501

expanding to 156% of wild-type, while adhesion dropped to only 10% compared to wild-type.

502

While this data supports the broader theory of c-di-GMP’s role as the “switch” between the

503

motile and sessile phase of the cell cycle, it does not align with those phenotypes seen in a C.

504

crescentus pleD mutant. While adhesion is reduced in both organisms, the reduction in adhesion

505

was much more drastic in B. subvibrioides than C. crescentus. Moreover, the motility

506

phenotypes in homologous pleD mutants shift in opposite directions. In C. crescentus, pleD

507

mutants causes a decrease in motility by nearly 40% in the wild-type background (22, 35). In B.

508

subvibrioides, we see a 156% increase (Figure 4A).

509
510

Another interesting detail discovered in performing these assays was the lack of change
in phenotypes seen in the pleD disruption strain in a divK background. It is not surprising that

511

adhesion was not negatively impacted as it is already significantly lower in the divK strain

512

compared to wild-type. However, disrupting the pleD gene did not cause hypermotility in the

513

divK mutant even though it does cause hypermotility in the wild-type background. In fact,

514

motility was reduced to 89% compared to the divK control (Figure 4A). It is not clear why

515

disruption of the diguanylate cyclase DgcB leads to increased motility in both the wild-type and

516

divK backgrounds, but disruption of another diguanylate cycle PleD leads to increased motility in

517

just the wild-type background. Interestingly, it was previously shown that DivJ and PleC do not

518

act on DivK alone, but in fact also have the same enzymatic functions on PleD phosphorylation

519

as well (39). It may be that PleD acts upon motility not through c-di-GMP signaling but instead

520

by modulating DivK activity, perhaps by interacting/interfering with the polar kinases. If so,

521

then the absence of DivK could block this effect.

522

Suppressor mutants have altered c-di-GMP levels. As these mutations are all involved

523

in c-di-GMP signaling, c-di-GMP levels in each strain were quantified to determine if the cellular

524

levels in each strain correspond to observed phenotypes. These metabolites were quantified from

525

whole cell lysates. In bacteria, high c-di-GMP levels typically induce adhesion while low c-di-

526

GMP levels induce motility. Therefore, it would be expected that hypermotile strains would

527

show decreased c-di-GMP levels. Instead, hypermotile strains of the wild-type background had

528

varying c-di-GMP levels (Figure 4B). The pleD knockout had reduced c-di-GMP levels as

529

predicted. While it may seem surprising that c-di-GMP levels are not affected in a dgcB mutant,

530

this in fact true of the C. crescentus mutant as well (35). This result suggests that the c-di-GMP

531

levels found in the dgcB strain do not appear to be the cause for the observed changes in motility

532

and adhesion.

533

Perhaps the most interesting result is that the cleD mutant had the highest c-di-GMP

534

levels of all strains tested. This is surprising as it is suggested by Nesper et. al. that CleD does

535

not affect c-di-GMP levels at all, but rather is affected by them. CleD is a response regulator that

536

contains neither a GGDEF nor an EAL domain characteristic of diguanylate cyclases and

537

phosphodiesterases respectively. Instead it is thought CleD binds to c-di-GMP, which then

538

stimulates it to interact with the flagellar motor. The data presented here suggests that there may

539

be a feedback loop whereby increased motility in the swarm agar leads to increased c-di-GMP

540

levels. One potential explanation is that this situation increases contact with surfaces. Yet the

541

cleD mutant clearly shows decreased adhesion compared to wild-type despite the elevated c-di-

542

GMP levels. Therefore, there must be a block between the high c-di-GMP levels and the

543

execution of those levels into adhesion in this strain.

544

Very different results were obtained when c-di-GMP levels were measured in divK

545

derived strains (Figure 4B). While a wide variety of motility phenotypes were observed in cleD,

546

dgcB, and pleD disruptions in the divK background, their c-di-GMP levels are all nearly identical

547

to that of the divK mutant. For the dgcB divK strain, once again the increase in motility occurs

548

without a change in c-di-GMP levels. These results suggest that DgcB is not a significant

549

contributor to c-di-GMP production in B. subvibrioides. While pleD disruption leads to

550

decreased c-di-GMP levels in the wild-type background, no change is seen in the divK

551

background. This means in the absence of PleD some other enzyme must be responsible for

552

achieving these levels of c-di-GMP. Given the lack of impact DgcB seems to have on c-di-GMP

553

signaling, it is tempting to speculate an as-yet characterized diguanylate cyclase is involved.

554

Lastly the elevated c-di-GMP levels seen in the cleD disruption are not seen when cleD is

555

disrupted in the divK background. This result suggests that whatever feedback mechanism leads

556

to elevated c-di-GMP levels is not functional in the divK mutant.

557

Non-native diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases cause shifts in c-di-GMP

558

levels but do not alter phenotypes in the divK strain. As previously mentioned, c-di-GMP is

559

thought to assist in the coordination of certain developmental processes throughout the cell cycle.

560

The previous results found mutations in genes involved in c-di-GMP signaling could suppress

561

developmental defects, but the actual effect of the mutations appears uncoupled from effects on

562

c-di-GMP levels. In order to further investigate the connection between developmental defects

563

and c-di-GMP signaling, c-di-GMP levels were artificially manipulated. Plasmid constructs

564

expressing non-native c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes previously used in similar experiments

565

in C. crescentus were obtained and expressed in B. subvibrioides. The diguanylate cyclase ydeH

566

from Escherichia coli was expressed from two different IPTG inducible plasmids; a medium

567

copy number pBBR-based plamid pTB4, and a low copy number pRK2-based plasmid, pSA280

568

(22). The combination of the two different inducible copy number plasmids resulted in different

569

elevated levels of c-di-GMP (Figure 5B). A phosphodiesterase pchP from Pseudomonas

570

aeruginosa (40), as well as its active site mutant pchPE328A were expressed from pBV-MCS4, a

571

vanillate inducible medium copy number plasmid (23). The phosphodiesterase on a medium

572

copy plasmid was enough to decrease levels of c-di-GMP to either equivalent or lower levels as

573

is seen in the divK strain. The decrease was not observed when the active site mutant was

574

expressed, demonstrating that the reduction of c-di-GMP was the result of pchP expression.

575

Wild-type and divK strains were grown with IPTG and vanillate respectively to control for any

576

growth effects caused by the inducers.

577

The low copy diguanylate cyclase plasmid did not appear to affect levels (Figure 5B), and

578

unsurprisingly did not appear to affect either motility or adhesion. However, the medium copy

579

diguanylate cyclase plasmid increased c-di-GMP levels but had the opposite phenotypic effect

580

than expected. An increase in c-di-GMP levels would be predicted to decrease motility and

581

increase adhesion, but here the increase in c-di-GMP caused an increase in motility and a

582

decrease in adhesion (Figure 5A). Conversely, expression of the phosphodiesterase in the wild-

583

type background caused a reduction in c-di-GMP which would be predicted to increase motility

584

and decrease adhesion. While this strain had a large reduction of adhesion, it also had a

585

reduction in motility. Therefore, the changes in c-di-GMP levels largely do not match the

586

changes in phenotype. It is also interesting to note that expression of the phosphodiesterase

587

results in similar c-di-GMP levels to that of the divK strain yet the phosphodiesterase strain

588

demonstrates much larger swarm sizes than the divK strain.

589

In the divK background strain, expression of either diguanylate cyclase increases c-di-

590

GMP levels, though the low copy diguanylate cyclase increase is not as dramatic as the medium

591

copy. However, neither expression level has a significant impact on motility or adhesion (Figure

592

5). Neither the phosphodiesterase nor its active site mutant cause a noticeable shift in the c-di-

593

GMP levels compared to the divK strain nor any noticeable impact on phenotype. In fact, though

594

the c-di-GMP levels differed dramatically between strains, the phenotypes of all six of these

595

strains are not impacted. T-tests performed between each strain and its respective control

596

showed no significant difference. These results appear to be the antithesis of those found from

597

the suppressor screen. While the suppressor mutants showed recovery in their motility defect

598

compared to divK, their c-di-GMP levels did not significantly differ from each other or divK.

599

Conversely, when c-di-GMP levels were artificially manipulated, alterations of c-di-GMP levels

600

in the divK strain had no impact on phenotypes. These results suggest that DivK is somehow

601

serving as a block or a buffer to c-di-GMP levels and their effects on phenotypes and calls into

602

question the role c-di-GMP has in B. subvibrioides developmental progression.

603

Discussion

604

Across closely related bacterial species, high levels of gene conservation are commonly

605

observed. It has therefore been a long-standing assumption that information gathered from

606

studying a model organism can be extrapolated to other closely related organisms. Through this

607

study, it has been shown that these assumptions may not be as safe to make as previously

608

thought. Preliminary data raised a few questions by demonstrating major differences in the

609

phenotypes of divK mutants between species. Here more differences between systems were

610

observed by demonstrating pleC mutants have similar but not identical phenotypes to C.

611

crescentus pleC mutants. These differences in signaling protein operation were observed despite

612

the fact that subcellular localization patterns are the same in both organisms. These findings

613

strongly indicated that some aspect of this system is somehow behaving differently than the

614

understood C. crescentus model system. These discoveries not only raised questions about how

615

the DivJ-DivK-PleC system has evolved over a short evolutionary distance, but they have also

616

called into question different aspects of the C. crescentus system.

617

In an attempt to further map this system in B. subvibrioides and perhaps identify missing

618

pieces, a suppressor screen was employed using the divK mutant as its phenotypes differed most

619

dramatically from its C. crescentus homolog. Suppressor mutations were found in genes

620

predicted to encode proteins that affected or were affected by c-di-GMP. This was not

621

necessarily a surprising discovery. C-di-GMP is a second messenger signaling system conserved

622

across many bacterial species used to coordinate the switch between motile and sessile lifestyles.

623

Previous research in C. crescentus suggests that organism integrated c-di-GMP signaling into the

624

swarmer-to-stalked cell transition. Mutations that modify c-di-GMP signaling would be

625

predicted to impact the swarmer cell stage, perhaps lengthening the amount of time the cell stays

626

in that stage and thus lead to an increase in swarm spreading in soft agar. However, further

627

inquiry into c-di-GMP levels of divK suppressor mutants revealed discrepancies between c-di-

628

GMP levels and their corresponding phenotypes. Firstly, CleD, a CheY-like response regulator

629

that is thought to affect flagellar motor function, caused the strongest suppression of the divK

630

mutant restoring motility levels to that of wild-type. Given that the reported function of CleD is

631

to bind the FliM filament of the flagellar motor and interfere with motor function to boost rapid

632

surface attachment (34), it is expected that disruption of cleD would result in increased motility

633

and decreased adhesion which can be seen in both the wild-type and divK background strains

634

(Figure 4A). What was unexpected, however, was to find that a lack of CleD led to one of the

635

highest detected levels of c-di-GMP in this study, which was surprising given that CleD has no

636

predicted diguanylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase domains. Yet when this same mutation was

637

placed in the divK background, the c-di-GMP levels were indistinguishable from the divK parent.

638

Therefore, the same mutation leads to hypermotility in two different backgrounds despite the fact

639

that c-di-GMP levels are drastically different. Consequently, the phenotypic results of the

640

mutation do not match the c-di-GMP levels, suggesting that c-di-GMP has little or no effect on

641

the motility phenotype. A similar result was seen with DgcB. Disruption of dgcB in either the

642

wild-type or divK background resulted in hypermotility, but c-di-GMP levels were not altered.

643

Once again, the effect on motility occurred independently of c-di-GMP levels.

644
645

Disruption of pleD led to different results. In the wild-type background, disruption of
pleD caused a reduction in c-di-GMP levels, which would be predicted given that PleD contains

646

a diguanylate cyclase domain. Therefore, of the three proteins analyzed here (CleD, DgcB, and

647

PleD), it appears only PleD actually contributes to the c-di-GMP pool. Yet when disruptions of

648

any of the genes are placed in a divK background, c-di-GMP levels are not altered. Disruption of

649

divK seems to somehow stabilize c-di-GMP levels. Even when non-native enzymes are

650

expressed in the divK background the magnitude of changes seen in the c-di-GMP pool is

651

dampened compared to the magnitude of change seen when the enzymes are expressed in the

652

wild-type background. This may explain why pleD was not found in the suppressor screen.

653

While CleD and DgcB seem involved in c-di-GMP signaling, their effect on the cell appears c-

654

di-GMP-independent, while PleD appears to perform its action by affecting the c-di-GMP pool.

655

If that pool is stabilized in the divK strain, then disruption of pleD will have no effect on either

656

the c-di-GMP pool or on the motility phenotype. However, it should be noted that c-di-GMP

657

levels were measured from whole cell lysates and does not reflect the possibility of spatial

658

variations of c-di-GMP levels within the cell. It is possible that CleD and DgcB have c-di-GMP

659

dependent effects, but those effects are limited to specific sub-cellular locations in the cell.

660

This research raises several questions. First, what is the exact role of c-di-GMP in cell

661

cycle progression of B. subvibrioides? Is this signal a major driver of the swarmer cell and

662

swarmer cell differentiation? Or have the various c-di-GMP signaling components found new

663

roles in the swarmer cell and the actual c-di-GMP is simply vestigial. What is the role of PleD in

664

cell cycle progression? Why are c-di-GMP levels so stable when DivK is removed? And lastly,

665

are the answers to these questions specific to B. subvibrioides, or can they be extrapolated back

666

to C. crescentus? Further investigation into c-di-GMP signaling in both organisms is required.

Figure 1. Deletions in B. subvibrioides developmental signaling genes results in varying

785

physiological phenotypes. A) Wild-type, divJ, divK, divJdivK, and pleC B. subvibrioides strains

786

were analyzed for swarm expansion (dark bars) and adhesion (light bars) defects using a soft

787

agar swarm assay and a short-term adhesion assay. Mutant strains were normalized to wild-type

788

results for both assays. Deletion of divJ gives motility defects but minimal adhesion defects,

789

similar to C. crescentus divJ results. B. subvibrioides divK and divJdivK strains give opposite

790

results, with severe motility and adhesion defects. The B. subvibrioides pleC strain has reduced

791

motility and moderately reduced adhesion, which is similar but not identical to the C. crescentus

792

ΔpleC strain. B) Lectin staining of holdfast material of wild-type, divJ, divK, divJdivK, and

793

ΔpleC strains. The ΔpleC strain, despite having reduced adhesion in the short-term adhesion

794

assay, still has detectable holdfast material C) GFP-tagged DivJ localizes to the holdfast

795

producing pole, while PleC-GFP localizes to the pole opposite the holdfast. DivK-GFP displays

796

bi-polar localization. These localization patterns are identical those of C. crescentus homologs.

Figure 2. Bacteriophage Delta serves as a tool to investigate B. subvibrioides pilus

799

production. A) Phage Delta was tested for infection in 18 different Brevundimonas species.

800

Control assays used PYE media instead of phage stock. Delta caused a significant reduction in

801

B. subvibrioides and B. aveniformis viability, with some reduction in B. basaltis and B.

802

halotolerans as well. B) Phage Delta was tested against wild-type and cpaF::pCR B.

subvibrioides strains using a soft agar phage assay. Wild-type displayed zones of clearing with

804

phage dilutions up to 10-7, while the cpaF strain showed resistance to all phage dilutions. C) B.

assays. Wild-type shows clear susceptibility to Delta, as does the divJ strain suggesting that, like

807

C. crescentus divJ, it produces pili. The pleC strain shows a 2-3 orders of magnitude reduced

808

susceptibility to the phage, indicating reduced pilus production which is consistent with the C.

809

crescentus phenotype. The divK and divJdivK strains display similar to resistance as the pleC

810

strain. Here again, divK disruption causes the opposite phenotype to divJ disruption, unlike the

811

C. crescentus results.

Figure 3. CleD displays a conserved glutamate residue in place of an aspartate typical of

814

response regulators. CleD orthologs from various Caulobacter and Brevundimonas species

815

were aligned by ClustalW, along with B. subvibrioides DivK. The shaded box indicates B.

816

subvibrioides DivK D53, which is analogous to C. crescentus DivK D53 and is the known

817

phosphoryl-accepting residue. This alignment demonstrates that CleD orthologs all contain a

818

glutamate substitution at that site, which has been found to mimic the phosphorylated state and

819

lock the protein in an active conformation in other response regulators.

Figure 4. Phenotypes exhibited by divK suppressors do not coincide with intracellular c-di-

822

GMP levels. A) Swarm expansion (dark bars) and surface adhesion (light bars) of suppressor

823

mutations tested in both the wild-type and divK background. Disruption of CleD, DgcB and

824

PleD lead to increased motility in the wild-type background, but only CleD and DgcB lead to

825

increased motility in the divK background. Disruptions in the wild-type background lead to

826

varying levels of adhesion reduction, but the same disruptions had no effect on adhesion in the

827

divK background. B) C-di-GMP levels were measured using mass spectrometry then normalized

828

to the amount of biomass from each sample. Despite disruptions causing increased motility in

the wild-type background, those strains had different c-di-GMP levels. No disruption changed c-

830

di-GMP levels in the divK background even though some strains suppressed the motility defect

831

while others did not. These results show a discrepancy between phenotypic effects and

832

intracellular c-di-GMP levels.

Figure 5. Artificial manipulation of c-di-GMP levels do not significantly affect phenotypes

835

in the divK mutant. A) Swarm expansion (dark bars) and surface adhesion (light bars) of strains

836

that have altered c-di-GMP levels caused by expression of non-native enzymes in the wild-type

837

and divK background. Constructs including the E. coli diguanylate cyclase ydeH expressed from

841

the medium copy DGC increased motility and decreased adhesion, which is opposite the

expected outcome, while the PDE reduced motility and severely reduced adhesion. In the divK

increased c-di-GMP levels, though PDE expression has no effect, despite the fact that neither

DGC construct has an effect on motility and adhesion phenotypes.
