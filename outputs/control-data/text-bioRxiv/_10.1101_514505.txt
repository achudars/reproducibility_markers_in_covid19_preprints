Abstract
Using contextual information to predict aversive events is a critical ability that protects from
generalizing fear responses to safe contexts. Animal models have demonstrated the importance of
spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear
learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety
learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual
representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains
unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context
conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment
included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were
identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently
(100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe
context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance
responses (SCRs; CS+ > CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear
generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the
Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representantions for the two contexts
in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear
expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score <
1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context
representation (z-score > 1.65). Thus, a low neural representation of spatial context may explain
overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that contextdependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this
involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory.

Introduction

2

The unwanted expression of learned fear responses in safe environments is one of the hallmarks of

3

anxiety and fear-related disorders (Lissek & Grillon, 2010; Shin & Liberzon, 2010). A crucial factor

4

that protects against this overgeneralization of fear is the ability to correctly use contextual factors

5

to predict threat and regulate fear expression. Animal research has shown that accurate context-

6

dependent prediction of threat depends on spatial context representations within the hippocampal

7

formation (Maren, Phan, & Liberzon, 2013). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known

8

to be critically involved in regulating fear expression (Dunsmoor & Paz, 2015; Greenberg, Carlson,

9

Cha, Hajcak, & Mujica-Parodi, 2013), but also fear generalization (Xu & Südhof, 2013). In humans, the

10

role of these regions in context-dependent expression and generalization of fear remains to be

11

investigated.

12

The role of context information in fear learning has been mostly studied in animal models

13

using context conditioning paradigms (Maren et al., 2013). In these paradigms, rodents learn that the

14

context (e.g., a box) predicts an aversive outcome, unlike cue conditioning paradigms, in which a cue

15

(e.g., a tone) serves as conditioned stimulus (CS) to predict an unconditioned stimulus (UCS).

16

Different neural mechanisms are involved in associating threat with a cue versus a context. The

17

amygdala plays a critical role in both the formation and expression of the cue CS-UCS association

18

(LeDoux, 2003; Phillips & LeDoux, 1992), although in humans, the role of the amygdala in fear

19

expression is less clear (Fullana et al., 2016; Mechias, Etkin, & Kalisch, 2010). The hippocampus is

20

critically involved in spatial mapping (Epstein, Patai, Julian, & Spiers, 2017; O’Keefe & Nadel, 1978)

21

and thereby also plays a role in the acquisition and storage of contextual threat information (Wiltgen,

22

2006). In addition to the context predicting the aversive outcome by itself, the context can also

23

change the predictive value of the cue. In this case, the context serves as an “occasion setter” (Bouton

24

& Nelson, 1998; Holland & Bouton, 1999; Maren et al., 2013) such that the CS predicts an aversive

25

outcome in one context, but not in another.

26

Electrophysiological studies in rodents have demonstrated the existence of place cells within

27

the hippocampus which selectively increase their firing rates when an animal is at a specific location

28

(O’Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971), thus providing a neuronal representation of the spatial environment

29

(O’Keefe & Conway, 1978; Wilson & McNaughton, 1993). In addition to neuronal spikes, hippocampal

30

local field potentials (LFP) have also been shown to code spatial location (Agarwal et al., 2014).

31

Similarly, research with intracranial recordings in humans has shown that cells in the hippocampus

32

respond to specific spatial locations while navigating around a virtual environment (Ekstrom et al.,

33

2003). Also using non-invasive imaging techniques, such as blood oxygen level-dependent functional

34

magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI), evidence was found for spatial representations in medial

35

temporal lobe (MTL) regions in humans (Steemers et al., 2016). Work using machine learning

36

methods applied to BOLD-fMRI data has furthermore shown that it is possible to decode

37

environment-specific representantions within a virtual environment from patterns of hippocampal

38

activity (Hassabis et al., 2009; Rodriguez, 2010; Sulpizio, Committeri, & Galati, 2014). We therefore

39

reasoned that the ability to decode environment-specific representantions from such patterns of

40

hippocampal activity can serve as an index of the strength of a context representation.

41

Context representations might play an important role in fear generalization. Animal research

42

has shown that lesions in the hippocampus prevent contextual fear conditioning in rats (Kim &

43

Fanselow, 1992), providing direct evidence for the importance of the hippocampus for contextual

44

fear learning. In humans, using virtual reality on a computer screen (Dunsmoor, Ahs, Zielinski, &

45

LaBar, 2014) or a head-mounted device (Kroes, Dunsmoor, Mackey, McClay, & Phelps, 2017), it is

46

now possible to study the role of context in fear learning. Initial studies using virtual reality by means

47

of preprogrammed movies have shown that responses to the CS+ acquired in a threat context

48

generalize to a safe context (Baas, Nugent, Lissek, Pine, & Grillon, 2004). However, since volitional

49

movement influences the formation of context representations in rodents (Cei, Girardeau, Drieu,

50

Kanbi, & Zugaro, 2014), these paradigms are less suited to investigate context representations. Here,

51

we therefore used a self-navigated virtual reality environment to test the hypothesis that individuals

52

with a low hippocampal context representation show increased fear generalization in the safe

53

context compared to those with a high context representation.

54

The vmPFC is thought to play a critical role in regulating the expression of fear memory, and

55

has been investigated extensively in the context of extinction leaning (Milad & Quirk, 2012). It has

56

been shown that extinction recall is context dependent (Milad, Orr, Pitman, & Rauch, 2005), and that

57

this context-dependent expression of extinction requires the vmPFC and its interactions with the

58

hippocampus and amygdala (Maren et al., 2013). A failure to recruit the vmPFC in response to safe

59

stimuli has been associated with deficiencies in fear generalization (Cha et al., 2014; Holt, Coombs,

60

Zeidan, Goff, & Milad, 2012). In animal models, the mPFC has been implicated in fear generalization

61

as well (Xu & Südhof, 2013). We reasoned that the presentation of a CS+ in a safe context could lead

62

to a suppression of fear responses similar to a CS+ presentation during extinction recall (Maren et al.,

63

2013) and therefore hypothesized that processing of a cue predicting an aversive outcome presented

64

in a safe context is supported by similar vmPFC-dependent mechanisms as those involved in

65

extinction recall.

66

The present study was designed to test these hypotheses in humans using fMRI and a virtual

67

reality environment. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent a context training paradigm within

68

the virtual reality environment. This environment involved a rich landscape including two buildings.

69

The buildings had distinct features on the outside, but were identical on the inside. Within this

70

environment, participants underwent context training which was followed by a differential delay

71

contextual fear conditioning paradigm with spatial context as occasion setter. The context training

72

paradigm served to create a strong context representation, and to allow for measurement of these

73

representations without the potential confound of threat-induced arousal during the fear

74

conditioning paradigm. During the fear conditioning paradigm, two different cues (CS+ and CS-) were

75

presented in both buildings, but the CS+ was only paired with a mild electric shock (at a

76

reinforcement rate of 100%) in the threat context, and never in the safe context. The CS- was never

77

paired with a shock. Estimations of spatial context representation strength were obtained using a

78

linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier that we trained on hippocampal patterns obtained

79

from and tested in the context training paradigm.

80

We tested the following predictions. First, we expected that, in addition to differential

81

conditioned SCRs in the threat building, differential conditioned SCRs in the safe building would be

82

present (i.e., where participants never received a shock, indicating fear generalization). Second, we

83

expected that also differential conditioned BOLD responses in the threat context would generalize to

84

the safe context. Third, if context-dependent downregulation of fear expression in safe environments

85

is indeed a process similar to extinction recall, then CS+ in the safe context should elicit stronger

86

BOLD responses in the vmPFC than CS+ in the threat context. Fourth, we predicted using multi-voxel

87

patterns of hippocampal activity that the hippocampus has a distinct representation of the two

88

buildings in the virtual environment. If low representations of spatial context play a role in fear

89

overgeneralization, then participants with lower classifier accuracy in distinguishing the two

90

buildings should exhibit increased generalization of conditioned SCRs the safe context.

Methods

92

Participants

93

Twenty-one right-handed healthy volunteers (12 females, 12 males; 19-34 years [M=23.3, SD=3.6])

94

completed the study. Exclusion criteria were: current or lifetime history of psychiatric, neurological,

95

or endocrine illness, current treatment with any medication that affects central nervous system or

96

endocrine systems, average use of more than three alcoholic beverages daily, average use of

97

recreational drugs weekly or more, habitual smoking, predominant left-handedness, uncorrected

98

vision, intense daily physical exercise, and any contraindications for MRI. Participants gave written

99

informed consent and were paid for their participation. This study was approved by the local ethical

100

review board (CMO region Arnhem-Nijmegen).

102

Design and procedure

103

The design of this study is illustrated in Figure 1. Each session started with a familiarization of the

104

virtual reality task outside of the scanner. This was done to minimize learning and/or novelty effects

105

during the scanning phase and to allow time for context representations to be formed and stabilized,

106

and create a “cognitive map” (Doeller, King, & Burgess, 2008; Hassabis et al., 2009). Next, participants

107

underwent a functional MRI session which included the following tasks: an object localizer task (7

108

min 40 sec), the context training paradigm (16-21 min), and the fear conditioning paradigm (25-30

109

min). The localizer paradigm was programmed using Presentation® software (Version 0.70,

110

www.neurobs.com). Data including the localizer paradigm will be reported elsewhere. The virtual

111

reality environment was built and presented using the Unreal Development Kit (Unreal Engine 3,

112

http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/WebHome.html) which communicated with the Presentation®

113

software to be able to synchronize with the image acquisition and trigger the electrical shocks in the

114

fear conditioning paradigm.

Figure 1 - Overview of the experimental design. (A) The task consisted of four stages. First, participants
were familiarized with the virtual reality environment outside the MRI. Next, participants underwent a
functional MRI session in which they performed an object localizer paradigm including different
versions of the CSs, a context training phase in the virtual environment, and finally a fear conditioning
phase. Both phases included two runs. (B) Illustration of the conditioned stimuli. Each participant saw
either a zucchini or a pumpkin (CS+ or CS- counterbalanced) and either a turtle or seagull (CS+ or CScounterbalanced). (C) An overview of the virtual reality environment. Participants navigated through
it from a first-person perspective. The environment contained two buildings (Threat or Safe
counterbalanced). (D) A schematic overview of a trial within a building for the context training phase
and the fear conditioning phase. When participants entered the “Trial booth”, depicted as a red
rectangle, within the building, the 3D environment converted to a 2D environment. A fixation dot
appeared on the screen for seven seconds. In the fear conditioning phase, this was followed by the CS for
five seconds. In the threat building, the CS+ was always followed by a shock.

115

Context familiarization of the virtual environment

116

Participants navigated through a virtual environment from a first-person perspective. The

117

environment involved a rich landscape including two buildings which they were able to enter. See

118

Figure 1C for an illustration of the environment. The buildings had distinct features on the outside

119

but were identical on the inside. First, we familiarized participants with the entire virtual

120

environment which was done outside the MRI scanner. In this paradigm, participants navigated

121

through the environment using three buttons (i.e., forward, left, and right) based on instructions that

122

where given to them. For example, participants were instructed to “go to the wooden barrel” or “walk

123

to the bucket”. Through these instructions, participants visited all areas of the environment at least

124

once.

125

After this initial familiarization paradigm, the participants practiced the main task. They were

126

placed in the environment and were instructed to walk to an instruction booth located outside of the

127

two main buildings. Once they entered, the number "1" or "2" was displayed, indicating which

128

building they were required to visit. Participants had to figure out which building corresponded to

129

this number. If they stood in front of the door of the correct building, the door would open and they

130

had to enter. In the middle of the building, there was a “trial booth” which they had to enter. At that

131

moment, participants could not navigate anymore and a trial would be presented on the screen in 2D.

132

For this familiarization paradigm, a trial consisted of a fixation cross presented for 4-6 sec. In total,

133

there were 48 trials (24 per building). If after a trial, the next trial was in the same building, the door

134

would stay closed. There were always two to four consecutive trials in the same building to reduce

135

the amount of time spent on navigation. After these trials, the door would be open and participants

136

could leave the building and navigate to the instruction booth, which switched to a new random

137

location each time, but was always outside the two buildings. Participants never visited the same

138

building more than twice in a row.

139
140

Context training of the virtual environment during functional MRI

141

Once in the MRI scanner, participants were placed in the virtual environment again. This paradigm

142

was very similar to the last part of the familiarization paradigm. The instruction booth indicated

143

which building they had to enter. Once the participant entered the building they were instructed to

144

go to the trial booth in the middle of the building. Once they entered the booth, a trial started. In this

145

paradigm, a trial consisted only of a gray screen with a fixation cross presented for 7 s. This was done

146

to sample hippocampal response patterns within the two buildings in the absence of a stimulus, and

147

with identical visual features at the moment of sampling. After the end of a trial there were again two

148

options, either to go to the booth in the same building again, or to go to the instruction booth. There

149

were always two to four consecutive trials within the same building, no more than twice they had to

150

go to the same building, and in total there were 48 trials (24 per building) divided over two scan runs.

151

Navigating through the environment was self-paced, therefore the duration of the task varied

152

between participants (range: 16-21 min, M=18 min 10 sec, SD=1 min 30 sec).

153
154
155

Fear acquisition in the virtual environment during functional MRI
The fear conditioning paradigm took place in the same environment and was therefore very similar

156

in setup to the context training paradigm. Here, a trial consisted of a fixation cross with a duration of

157

7 s, which was followed by a conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation with a duration of 5 s. In each

158

trial, one of two CSs, a CS+ and a CS-, was shown. The same CSs were used in each of the two buildings,

159

but only in one of the buildings (the Threat context), the CS+ predicted an electrical shock. In the

160

other building (the Safe context) participants never received a shock. The CS- was never paired with

161

shock. There were two pairs of CS+/CS- (a picture of a Seagull/Pumpkin or Tortoise/Zucchini) the

162

use of which was counterbalanced across participants. See Figure 1B for an illustration. Again, after

163

each trial, there were two options, either to stay in the same building for a new trial, or to leave the

164

building and go to the instruction booth. There were always two to four consecutive trials within the

165

same building, no more than twice they had to go to the same building, and in total there were 60

166

trials (30 per building), divided over two scan runs. Because navigation through the environment

167

was self-paced, the duration of this paradigm varied between participants (range: 25-30 min, M=27

168

min 30 sec, SD=1 min).

169
170

Peripheral stimulation

171

Electrical shocks were delivered via two Ag/AgCl electrodes attached to the distal phalanges of the

172

thumb and fifth digit of the right hand using a MAXTENS 2000 (Bio-Protech) device. Shock duration

173

was 200 ms, and intensity varied in 10 intensity steps between 0V-40V/0mA-80mA. During a

174

standardized shock intensity adjustment procedure, each participant received and subjectively rated

175

five shocks, allowing shock intensity to converge to a level experienced as uncomfortable, but not

176

painful. The resulting average intensity step was 4.1 (SD: 1.5) on a scale from 1 to 10.

177
178

Peripheral measurements

179

Electrodermal activity (EDA) was assessed using two Ag/AgCl electrodes attached to the distal

180

phalanges of the second and third digit of the left hand using a BrainAmp MR system and recorded

181

using BrainVision Recorder software (Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany). Data were

preprocessed using in-house software; radio frequency (RF) artifacts were removed and a low-pass

183

filter was applied (de Voogd, Fernández, & Hermans, 2016b, 2016a). Skin conductance responses

184

(SCR) were automatically scored with additional manual supervision using Autonomate (Green,

185

Kragel, Fecteau, & LaBar, 2014) implemented in Matlab 7.14 (MathWorks). SCR amplitudes

186

(measured in Siem) were determined for each trial within an onset latency window between 0.5

187

and 3.8 s after stimulus onset, with a minimum rise time of 0.5 s and because there was a 100%

188

reinforcement rate, the maximum latency of the peak was set at 4.9 s, the time point the shock was

189

given. All response amplitudes were square-root transformed and normalized according to each

190

participant’s mean UCS response (Schiller, Kanen, LeDoux, Monfils, & Phelps, 2013) prior to

191

statistical analysis. Analyses on the SCRs were performed using SPSS 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New

192

York). A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted including CS (CS+, CS-), Context (Threat, Safe) as

193

within-subject factors. To assess fear generalization, we calculated a fear-generalization index by

194

subtracting the differential SCR responses from the last two trials in the safe context from the

195

differential SCR responses from the last two trials in the threat context. Effect sizes are reported as

196

Partial eta squared (𝜂𝑝2 ) and Cohen’s D.

197

Finger pulse was recorded using a pulse oximeter affixed to the second digit of the left hand.

198

Respiration was measured using a respiration belt placed around the participant’s abdomen. Pulse

199

and respiration measures were used for retrospective image-based correction (RETROICOR) of

200

physiological noise artifacts in BOLD-fMRI data (Glover, Li, & Ress, 2000). Raw pulse and respiratory

201

data were processed offline using in-house software for interactive visual artifact correction and

202

peak detection, and were used to specify fifth-order Fourier models of the cardiac and respiratory

203

phase-related modulation of the BOLD signal (Van Buuren et al., 2009), yielding 10 nuisance

204

regressors for cardiac noise and 10 for respiratory noise. Additional regressors were calculated for

205

heart rate frequency, heart rate variability, (raw) abdominal circumference, respiratory frequency,

206

respiratory amplitude, and respiration volume per unit time (Birn, Diamond, Smith, & Bandettini,

207

2006), yielding a total of 26 nuisance regressors.

209

MRI data acquisition

210

MRI scans were acquired using a Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) MAGNETOM Skyra 3.0T MR scanner

211

with a 32-channel head coil. T2*-weighted BOLD images were recorded using a multiband

216

to magnetic field inhomogeneity, we acquired field maps using a dual echo 2D gradient-echo

MRI data preprocessing in standard stereotactic space and group analyses of the fear conditioning

224

To investigate BOLD response activation patterns across participants for the general task effects in

225

the fear conditioning paradigm, MRI data were pre-processed in standard stereotactic (MNI152)

226

space (using SPM12; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm; Wellcome Department of Imaging

227

Neuroscience, London, UK). For this, structural images were segmented into grey matter, white

228

matter, and CSF images using a unified probabilistic template registration and tissue classification

method (Ashburner & Friston, 2005). Tissue images were then registered with site-specific tissue

230

templates (created from 384 T1-weighted scans) using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007), and registered

231

(using an affine transformation) with the MNI152 template included in SPM12. Identical

232

transformations were applied to all functional images, which were resliced into 2 mm isotropic

233

voxels and smoothed with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. For three participants, the MRI data could

234

not be analyzed due to a reconstruction error. These participants were therefore excluded from this

235

analysis.

236

The first-level model included four regressors of interest (CS+threat, CS-threat, CS+safe, CS-safe) for

237

both runs using 5 s box car functions. Additionally, the period during which participants were

238

navigating was modeled in a separate regressor in each run using a box car function with a duration

239

set to the navigation duration of that period. Responses to shocks were modeled in an additional

240

regressor using a delta function. The model additionally included six movement parameter

241

regressors (3 translations, 3 rotations) derived from rigid-body motion correction, 26 RETROICOR

242

physiological noise regressors (see above), high-pass filtering (1/128 Hz cut-off), and AR(1) serial

243

correlations correction. Single-subject contrast maps obtained from first-level analyses were entered

244

into second-level random effects analyses (one-sample t-test). We used a cluster-forming voxel-level

245

threshold of p< .001 (uncorrected). Alpha was set at .05, whole-brain family-wise error (FWE)

246

corrected at the cluster level using Gaussian Random Field Theory-based methods (Friston et al.,

247

1996).

MRI data preprocessing in native space and statistical analyses of the context training paradigm

249

For the classification analysis, BOLD-fMRI data was preprocessed in native space (i.e., including the

250

steps

251

(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK).

252

We created a first-level model using a finite impulse response (FIR) model which included 20 time-

253

bins (TR = 0.909 s) time-locked to trials. Bin number 2 to 8 covered the fixation duration and were

254

used for classification of the context. This first-level model makes no assumptions regarding the HRF

255

shape and yields independent response estimates for all time bins.

using

SPM12

256

We used a leave-one-out procedure to model each of the 48 trials separately, meaning 48

257

first-level models were created for each participant. In each one trial was modeled separately using

258

one 20-regressor FIR set, and all other trials where collapsed into another 20-regressor FIR set

259

(divided over the two runs). The resulting contrast images were used as data input for the classifier,

260

as explained below.

261
262

Linear support vector machine classification, permutation testing, and region of interest definition

263

A linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a linear discriminant function

264

distinguishing between the two buildings (Threat context, Safe context) during the context training

265

paradigm. This was done because during this paradigm no shocks where given. Shock-induced

266

movement and threat-induced arousal could therefore not influence the classification. We took a

267

region-of-interest (ROI) approach based on previous studies showing it is possible to decode

268

environment-specific representantions from the hippocampus (Hassabis et al., 2009). The

269

hippocampus was individually defined in native space using automated anatomical segmentation of

270

T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). As a control region

271

we took the amygdala, since this region is located close to the hippocampus, but no context decoding

272

can be expected from this region.

273

First, all features (i.e., voxels within the hippocampus) were scaled using a z-transformation.

274

The mean and standard deviation were always obtained from the training data and applied to both

275

the training and test data. Thus, test data did not influence the scaling. The parameter C, the

276

optimization parameter for misclassifications, was fixed at C=1. We used the train and prediction

277

functions

278

(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm/). We trained and tested the data from all trials (24 per

279

building) using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure with voxels from the predefined

280

hippocampal ROI. We repeated this procedure 1,000 times resulting in an estimate of the average

classification accuracy. For statistical testing, we performed a permutation test (1,000 repetitions)

282

for each participant. Before each classification we randomly shuffled the labels. We obtained a

283

standard (z) score for each classification accuracy within the permutation distribution. The resulting

284

z-score was tested against the classification of a control region, namely the amygdala, and against

285

zero.

286

To assess interindividual differences in context representation and fear generalization, we

287

divided participants into two groups based on a z-score cut-off of 1.645 (95%). Poor context

288

representation was defined as an average (left and right hemisphere) classification z-score of <1.645

289

(n=14) and a good context representation by an average (left and right hemisphere) classification z-

290

score of >1.645 (n=7).

Results

293

Psychophysiological measures

294

To confirm the effectiveness of the fear conditioning paradigm, we compared the average skin

295

conductance responses to the CS+ and CS- in both threat and safe contexts using a repeated-measures

296

ANOVA with CS type (CS+ and CS−) and Context (Threat, Safe) as within-subject factors. We found

297

higher average SCR amplitudes for the CS+ compared to the CS- [main effect of CS, F(1,20)= 18.36,

298

p=3.61E-04, 𝜂𝑝2 =.48]. As expected, these differential responses (CS+ > CS-) were stronger in the threat

299

context compared to the safe context [F(1,20)=9.78, p=.005, 𝜂𝑝2 =.33]. Nevertheless, differential

300

responses were not only present in the threat context [t(20)=3.982, p=.001, D=1.064], but also in the

301

safe context [t(20)=3.447, p=.003, D=.921]. As an exploratory analysis, we added sex as a between-

302

subject factor, however, there were no significant main effects of, or interactions with sex.

303

We next reasoned that by averaging across the entire time course of learning, we may not

304

capture fear generalization well, since participants in the beginning have not learned yet which

305

context is safe. Thus, to specifically investigate the relationship between context learning and fear

306

generalization, we used the last two learning trials. We again found higher SCR amplitudes for the

307

CS+ compared to the CS- [main effect of CS, F(1,20)= 7.327, p=.014, 𝜂𝑝2 =.27]. There was, however, no

308

CS (CS+, CS-) by Context (Threat, Safe) interaction [F(1,20)= 1.111, p=.31, 𝜂𝑝2 =..05]. Analyzing

309

differential SCRs separately within the two contexts, we found a trend-level differential (CS+ > CS-)

310

response in the threat context [t(20)=2.030, p=.056, D=.622] and a significant differential (CS+ > CS-)

311

response in the Safe building [t(20)=2.504, p=.021, D=.773]. Together, this pattern of results

312

indicates that there was robust generalization of conditioned fear expression from the threat context

313

to the safe context by the end of acquisition. For further analyses, we calculated a participant-specific

315

means that the higher this index was, the stronger the expression of differential conditioned fear

316

responses were in the safe context, relative to the threat context.

317

In sum, electrodermal data show that our virtual reality fear conditioning paradigm elicited

318

robust conditioned fear responses, and that fear responses generalized to a safe context. See Figure

Univariate functional MRI analysis
We verified whether the fear conditioning paradigm within the virtual reality environment exhibited

323

the expected task-related activity during CS presentation using conventional group analyses in

324

standard stereotactic (MNI152) space. With a whole-brain analysis we first identified regions that

325

were more responsive to the CS+ versus the CS-. In line with results commonly seen in fear

326

conditioning paradigms, we observed robust differential BOLD responses in the left and right

327

anterior insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [cluster size=125784 mm3, cluster p<.001,

328

whole-brain FWE-corrected] as well as the left [cluster size=72 mm3, cluster p=.016, FWE-SVC] and

329

right amygdala [cluster size=88 mm3, cluster p=.015, FWE-SVC], among others. For the reversed

330

contrast (CS- > CS+) we found differential BOLD responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex

331

[cluster size=2688 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected), and left [cluster size=

332

2464mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected] and right angular gyrus [cluster size= 2424

333

mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected], among others. See Figure 3 and Table 1.

334

Additionally, we found an interaction with Context (Threat context, Safe context) in similar

335

regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [cluster size=37512 mm3, cluster p<.001,

336

whole-brain FWE-corrected] as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex [cluster size=6144 mm3,

337

cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected], among others. When investigating the differential

338

responses (CS+ versus CS-) in both contexts separately, we found differential responses in the threat

339

context in the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, caudate and putamen [cluster

340

size=139920 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected], left [cluster size=16 mm3, cluster

341

p=.029, FWE-SVC] and right amygdala [cluster size=40 mm3, cluster p=.024, FWE-SVC], as well as

342

the vmPFC [cluster size=8488 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-corrected], among others. See

343

Figure 3 and Table 1.

344

Critically, we also observed differential responses within the safe context (i.e., where

345

participants never received a shock) in the left [cluster size=4192 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain

346

FWE-corrected] and right anterior insula [cluster size=9008 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-

347

corrected], and left [cluster size=6 mm3, cluster p=.041, FWE-SVC] and right amygdala [cluster

348

size=6 mm3, cluster p=.041, FWE-SVC], among others. Finally, as predicted, when comparing the CS+

349

in the safe building with the CS+ in the threat building, we saw increased responses in the

350

ventromedial prefrontal cortex [cluster size=3816 mm3, cluster p<.001, whole-brain FWE-

351

corrected]. See Figure 3 and Table 1.

352

In sum, similar to the SCR data, our virtual reality paradigm elicited robust fear conditioning

353

responses as well as generalized fear responses in the safe context. Moreover, the CS+ in the safe

354

context elicited increased activation in the vmPFC, a region critically implicated in fear extinction.

Context classification
Finally, to test our hypothesis regarding the association between strength of context representations

357

and fear generalization, we trained and tested a linear support vector machine (SVM) on voxels from

358

the hippocampus in the context training paradigm, before participants received any shock. We found

359

an average (1000 repetitions of this procedure) of 54.20% accuracy (left: 54.31 % and right: 54.09 %).

360

For statistical testing, we repeated the procedure but this time before each classification we shuffled

361

the labels, resulting in a permutation distribution for each individual (1000 repetitions). Next, we

362

obtained a standard score [(accuracy – average permutation accuracy) / standard deviation

363

permutation] for each individual and each hemisphere. This resulted in an average z-score of 1.33

364

(left: 1.37 and right: 1.29). As an additional control analysis, we repeated the entire procedure for a

365

control region. We took the amygdala since this region is bordering the hippocampus, is involved in

366

fear learning, but not involved in context representation. We found an average accuracy of 52.00%

367

(left: 52.21 and right: 51.80) and average z- score of 0.55 (left: 0.61 and right: 0.48). We then

368

performed a ROI (hippocampus, control) by Hemisphere (left, right) repeated-measures ANOVA and

369

found that z-scores were higher in the hippocampus than the control region [F(1,20)=43.51, p<.001,

370

Pη2=.68]. Follow-up one-sample t-test (corrected for four comparisons) showed that for the

371

hippocampus, z-scores were significantly above chance [left: t(20)=6.80=, p<.001, corrected, and

372

right: t(20)=5.774, p<.001, corrected], which was not the case for the control region [left: t(20)=2.388,

373

p=.11, corrected, and right: t(20)=2.052, p=.20, corrected]. See Figure 4D.

374

Finally, we investigated the time course of BOLD signal within trials by performing the same

375

classification procedure on each time bin within the 7-s fixation period for the hippocampus and the

376

control region. We performed an ROI (hippocampus, control) by Hemisphere (left, right) by Time bin

377

(7 bins) repeated-measures ANOVA and found that z-scores were higher in the hippocampus than

378

the control region [F(1,20)=15.50, p<.001, Pη2=.44]. Follow-up tests (corrected for two comparisons)

379

showed z-scores were significantly above zero for the hippocampus [F(1,20)=14.24, p=.002,

380

corrected, Pη2=.42], which was not the case for the amygdala [F(1,20)=2.311, p=.29, corrected,

381

Pη2=.10]. See Figure 4E.

382
383

In sum, in line with the previous literature, we found distinguishable multi-voxel patterns of
hippocampal environment-specific representantions within a virtual reality environment.

384
385

Context representations associated with fear generalization: SCR

386

Finally, we reasoned that a low context representations would predict poor fear contextualization.

387

To investigate this, we made use of the fear-generalization index described above, which was based

388

on generalization of conditioned fear to the safe context in the final two trials of acquisition. To

389

determine to what extent participants exhibited strong versus weak context representations, we

390

divided participants into two groups based on a z-score cut-off of 1.645 (95%) for the individual

391

classifier performance in distinguishing the two contexts. In this way we defined a group of low

392

context representation (z-score < 1.645, n=14) and a group of high context representation (z-score>

393

1.645, n=7). Next, we added Context representations as a between-subject factor to the SCR analyses

394

(as described above).

395

We found stronger fear generalization in the low context representation group compared to

396

the high context representation group [t(19)=1.806, p=.04, one-tailed, D=.836]. Due to a violation of

397

the normality assumption, we performed a permutation test and confirmed this result [t= 1.717,

398

p=.04, one-tailed permutation test, 100,000 repetitions]. Further testing showed that this effect was

399

not specific to either of the two contexts, meaning this effect may be partly driven by numerically

400

stronger differential SCRs in the safe context for the low context representation group, but also partly

401

by numerically stronger differential SCRs in the threat context in the high context representation

402

group. See Figure 4F.

403

Additionally, we tested whether fear acquisition in general was affected by context

404

representation. We found a CS (CS+, CS-) by Context (Threat context, Safe context) by Context

405

representation (Low, High) interaction [F(1,19)=5.391, p=.032, 𝜂𝑝2 =.18] across all learning trials.

406

Differential responses (CS+ minus CS-) in the Threat context was stronger for the high context

407

representation group compared to the low context representation group [F(1,19)=5.084, p=.036,

408

𝜂𝑝2 =.21], but there were no differences in differential responses (CS+ minus CS-) in the Safe context

409

[F(1,19)=.315, p=.58, 𝜂𝑝2 =.02] between the groups. This suggests that contextual information also

410

plays a role during fear acquisition.

411

In conclusion, we found that the high context representation group showed stronger

412

differentially conditioned SCRs in a threat context overall, indicating more strongly discriminative

413

fear learning. We furthermore found evidence that the low context representation group showed

414

stronger differential responses in a safe context, reflecting stronger fear generalization.

Discussion
This study was designed to investigate the role of spatial context representations in context-

417

dependent expression and generalization of learned fear. We hypothesized that suppression of the

418

expression of conditioned fear in safe contexts would depend on similar neural mechanisms as those

419

involved in extinction recall. Furthermore, we hypothesized that a low context representation of a

420

virtual environment would underlie the generalization of fear to a safe context. We tested these

421

hypotheses in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm in which context in a self-navigated virtual

422

environment served as an “occasion setter”.

423

We report the following findings. First, we found expression of differentially conditioned

424

responses (i.e., increased SCRs to the CS+ compared to the CS-) in a safe context (i.e., where

425

participants never received a shock), demonstrating generalization of fear and thus validating our

426

paradigm. Second, in line with our expectation that context-dependent suppression of fear is similar

427

to extinction recall, we found increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) responses to the

428

CS+ in the safe context compared to the CS+ in the threat context. Third, we found above-chance

429

decoding of environment-specific representations within the virtual environment (measured before

430

fear acquisition took place). Lastly, interindividual differences in context representation predicted

431

later differential fear conditioning strength, independent of the context. Critically, weaker context

432

representations prior to fear learning predicted later fear generalization.

433

We found increased SCRs as well as increased BOLD responses in regions typically activated

434

in response to cues associated with threat, in a safe context (i.e., where no aversive event has taken

435

place). Heightened fear responses in a safe environment is one of the hallmarks of fear and stress-

436

related disorders (Jovanovic, Kazama, Bachevalier, & Davis, 2012). Here, we found that such a

437

response to a potentially threatening cue in a safe context is present in a healthy population. We

438

extend previous findings of fear generalization that have shown generalized fear responses to

439

perceptually similar CSs (Dunsmoor, Mitroff, & LaBar, 2009; Lissek et al., 2008; Struyf, Zaman,

440

Hermans, & Vervliet, 2017), which were additionally shown to be accompanied by increased BOLD

441

responses in regions implicated in fear acquisition (Dunsmoor, Prince, Murty, Kragel, & LaBar, 2011).

442

We also extend a previous study that has shown fear responses to a CS associated with an aversive

443

event in a safe context (Baas et al., 2004), by showing these generalized physiological responses are

444

accompanied by increased activity in neural systems involved in fear learning.

445

In line with our hypothesis regarding the role of the vmPFC in context-dependent expression

446

of conditioned fear, we observed increased vmPFC responses to the CS+ in the safe context compared

447

to the CS+ in the threat context. The vmPFC is critically implicated in extinction of fear memory, as

448

detailed in animal models (Milad & Quirk, 2012). Human studies using neuroimaging have indicated

449

that vmPFC responses increase over the course of extinction, in response a to CS+ that no longer

450

predicts an aversive outcome (Phelps et al., 2004). Increased vmPFC responses were also found in

451

response to an extinguished CS+ compared to a non-extinguished CS+, implicating a role of the

452

vmPFC in extinction recall (Milad et al. 2007). It is thought that extinction learning does not overwrite

453

the orginal fear memory (i.e., US-CS association), but creates a new safety memory that may be

454

context-dependent (Bouton 2004). It has been suggested that the extinction-induced vmPFC

455

responses following extinction are therefore also context-dependent (Kalish et al., 2006). The

456

increased vmPFC responses we found to a cue signaling threat in a safe context suggest that context-

457

dependent safety learning involves a similar neural pathway as extinction learning. We extend

458

previous findings, however, by showing that vmPFC responses do not per se progress over time but

459

can flexibly shift across a threat and safe context. Thus, our findings indicate that the role of the

460

vmPFC extends beyond one-directional extinction and suppression of fear expression, and is better

understood as implementing the capacity to flexibly regulate context-dependent expression of fear.

462

We found above-chance classification of environment-specific represantations within a

463

virtual reality environment from multi-voxel patterns of BOLD-fMRI recorded within the

464

hippocampus. This is in line with previous studies (Hassabis et al. 2009; Kim et al., 2017; Rodriguez,

465

2010; Sulpizio et al. 2014). One question that often arises is whether neuronal representations of the

466

spatial environment, which are known to be coded across distributed neuronal ensembles within the

467

hippocampus, can truly be picked up using a relatively coarse technique such as BOLD-fMRI. Indeed,

468

it is possible that environment-specific represantations could be decoded based on other features

469

than a purely spatial code (e.g., multimodal associations reinstated by exposure to a context).

470

Notably, however, it was recently found that in addition to sinlge-neuron firing rates, local-field

471

potentials (LFP) can also be used to decode spatial location in rodents, and this measure appears as

472

reliabe as neural spikes (Agarwal et al 2014). Because LFPs are also thought to underlie the BOLD

473

signal (Magri, Schridde, Murayama, Panzeri, & Logothetis, 2012), it appears reasonable to assume

474

that similar spatial representations could be detected using BOLD as well. Indeed, human

475

neuroimaging studies using BOLD-fMRI in humans have revealed that similar mechanisms are

476

involved in coding space and location as in rodents (Doeller, Barry, Burgess 2010). Namely, using

477

virtual reality paradigms, it was shown that BOLD signal in MTL regions follows a grid-like pattern

478

for space (Doeller, Barry, Burgess 2010), but also in relation to mental stimulation (Bellmund et al.,

479

2017) and visual space (Nau et al., 2018).

480

Our finding is in line with previous studies (Hassabis et al. 2009; Kim et al., 2017; Rodriguez,

481

2010; Sulpizio et al. 2014), however, there are a few differences between our design and those of

previous studies. First, in our design, participants were able to move freely within the virtual reality

483

environment, and within the context training paradigm, trials start at random locations within the

484

environment to promote path formation (Cei et al., 2014). Second, we have performed statistical

485

testing on z-scores, based on individual permutation distrubutions, and not the individual

486

classification accuracies, because this was shown to be more valid (Haynes, 2015). Third, in our

487

design, we fully controlled for visual confounds. The two buildings were fully identical on the inside,

488

and as input for the classifier we used a seven-second fixation period during which only a fixation

489

dot was visible on the screen.

490

Finally, we hypothesized that low context representations would be associated with more

491

fear generalization. We indeed found evidence for this association, however, we also found that

492

participants for whom the classifier was able to classify in which building they were in the virtual

493

environment during the training paradigm (i.e., before fear acquisition took place) had stronger

494

differential fear responses in the threat context across all learning trials. These two findings are

495

indications of how contextual information can play a dual role in fear acquisition. We propose that,

496

on the one hand, contextual information enhancee adaptive responses to threat by increasing its

497

specificity. Impaired discrimination between threat and safe cues has been linked to high anxiety

498

(Kuhn, Mertens, & Lonsdorf, 2016), suggesting that an increased cue discrimination reflects an

499

adaptive response to threat. Our finding suggests that context representation plays a role in this

500

discrimination. On the other hand, failure to integrate cue and context information into a conjunctive

501

memory may underlie the development of maladaptive threat responses that generalize to safe

502

environments.For instance, the inability to regulate fear using context information is thought to

503

underlie the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Liberzon and Sripada, 2008;

504

Cohen et al., 2009; Acheson et al., 2011). Our findings provide empirical support for this notion by

505

linking poor spatial context representations to the inability to reguate fear responses in a safe

506

context.

507

In conclusion, we demonstrate generalized conditioned fear responses to a safe context

508

within a virtual reality environment. We found that the vmPFC is activated to threat cues in a safe

509

context, suggesting that this region uses contextual information to flexibly adjust expression of

510

conditioned fear, in a similar fashion as during recall of extinction memory. Furthermore, we

511

observed that good context representations are associated with stronger fear learning in the correct

512

context, while poor context representations were associated with stronger fear generalization (i.e.,

513

conditioned fear expression in a safe context). These experimental findings in a healthy population

open new avenues for exploring the role of spatial and contextual representations in pathologically

515

generalized fear, as observed for instance in PTSD.
