Running title: Making the
MOSTest of imaging genetics

Regional brain morphology has a complex genetic architecture, consisting of
many common polymorphisms with small individual effects, which has proven
challenging for genome-wide association studies to date, despite its high
heritability1,2. Given the distributed nature of the genetic signal across brain
regions, joint analysis of regional morphology measures in a multivariate
statistical framework provides a way to enhance discovery of genetic variants
with current sample sizes. While several multivariate approaches to GWAS have
been put forward over the past years3–5, none are optimally suited for complex,
large-scale data. Here, we applied the Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test
(MOSTest), with an efficient computational design enabling rapid and reliable
permutation-based inference, to 171 subcortical and cortical brain morphology
measures from 26,502 participants of the UK Biobank (mean age 55.5 years,
52.0% female). At the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of
a=5x10-8, MOSTest identifies 347 genetic loci associated with regional brain
morphology, more than any previous study, improving upon the discovery of
established GWAS approaches more than threefold. Our findings implicate
more than 5% of all protein-coding genes and provide evidence for gene sets
involved in neuron development and differentiation. As such, MOSTest, which
we have made publicly available, enhances our understanding of the genetic
determinants of regional brain morphology.

Regional surface area and thickness of the cerebral cortex
and volume of subcortical structures are highly heritable
brain morphological features with complex genetic
architectures, involving many common genetic variants
with small effect sizes1,2. The predominant strategy for
identifying genomic loci associated with complex traits is
through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a
mass-univariate approach whereby the association
between a single outcome measure and each of millions
of genetic variants, in isolation, is tested. This is
accompanied by a stringent multiple comparison
correction to control the family-wise error rate,
necessitating very large sample sizes to identify even
relatively strong effects. To date, the largest GWAS of
regional brain morphological features, based on brain
scans obtained from up to fifty thousand individuals,
identified almost two hundred genetic variants1, which
together explained only a fraction of the reported narrow-

sense heritability. These studies primarily investigate each
region of interest individually, compounding the multiple
comparisons correction problem.
In addition to small effect sizes across many variants, the
genetic architectures of sets of regional brain features are
likely to strongly overlap. Gene expression studies of the
human brain have shown widespread gradients across the
cortex6. Thus, genetic variants probably have distributed
effects across regions and morphological measures. While
cortical thickness and surface area have been reported to
be phenotypically and genetically only weakly correlated
to each other7, many brain-related traits, e.g. mental
disorders, share a large proportion of genetic variants,
even in the absence of an overall correlation8. The
discovery of these variants may be boosted through joint
analysis of these traits, in a multivariate framework. This
avoids the family-wise error rate penalty for studying
multiple outcome measures, or the use of strategies that
reduce phenotypic information to a single composite
score, which can cause considerable loss of statistical

power 9. Importantly, a multivariate approach is much
more consistent with the notion of the brain being an
integrated unit, with highly interconnected and
biologically similar brain regions, compared to univariate
approaches that ignore the information shared across these
component measures.
Here we implement a Multivariate Omnibus Statistical
Test (MOSTest), designed to boost the power of imaging
genetics by capitalizing on the distributed nature of
genetic influences across brain regions and pleiotropy
across imaging modalities. MOSTest is efficient and
capable of combining large-scale genome-wide analyses
of dozens of measures for tens of thousands of individuals
within hours while achieving enhanced statistical power.
Key steps of the MOSTest analysis include: 1) applying a
rank-based inverse normal transformation to the input
measures; 2) estimating the multivariate correlation
structure from the GWAS on randomly permuted
genotype data; 3) calculating the Mahalanobis norm, as
the sum of squared de-correlated z-values across
univariate GWAS summary statistics, to integrate effects
across the measures into a multivariate test statistic; and
4) employing the gamma cumulative density function to
fit an analytic form for the null distribution, enabling
extrapolation to and beyond the 5x10-8 significance
threshold. This avoids the extensive computational burden
associated with permutation-based approach which has,
until now, prohibited its application in GWAS. The
Supplementary Materials contains a detailed description
and validation of these steps through simulations.
We compare the MOSTest with an established inferential
methodology recently used by the Enhancing
NeuroImaging
Genetics
through
Meta-Analysis
(ENIGMA) consortium1, referred to as the min-P
approach; min-P takes the smallest p-value of each SNP
across the univariate GWAS, and corrects this for the
effective number of traits studied4,10, i.e. shared genetic
architecture across traits does not contribute to statistical
power. Min-P achieves its maximum power when the
genetic effects across traits are independent; conversely,
multivariate approaches have greater power when genetic
effects are distributed across traits 3.
Here, we applied MOSTest to sets of regional brain
morphology measures, hypothesizing that it will
outperform the min-P approach due to the distributed
nature of genetic effects and the presence of pleiotropy
across modalities. Our sample consisted of 26,502 healthy
White European participants of the UK Biobank (UKB),
with a mean age of 55.5 years (standard deviation (SD)
7.4 years), 52.0% female. We processed T1-weighted
structural MRI scans with the FreeSurfer v5.3 standard
“recon-all” processing pipeline, producing a subset of 35
subcortical volume estimates 11, as well as subsets of
surface area and cortical thickness estimates, both
consisting of 68 cortical regions following the DesikanKilliany parcellation12, for a total set of 171 measures. All
measures were pre-residualized for age, sex, scanner site,

2

a proxy of image quality (FreeSurfer’s Euler number), the
first twenty genetic principal components to control for
population stratification, and a global measure specific to
each set of variables: mean cortical thickness for the
regional thickness measures, total surface area for the area
measures, and intracranial volume for the subcortical
structures. Subsequently, we performed a rank-based
inverse normal transformation to the residualized
measures. We made use of the UKB v3 imputed data,
carrying out standard quality-checks and setting a minor
allele frequency threshold of .005, leaving 7.4 million
SNPs. Univariate GWAS of each measure was performed
with standard tools. The resulting summary statistics were
then tested for overall significance with MOSTest.
Independent significant SNPs and genomic loci were
identified in accordance with FUMA SNP2GENE
definition13. Details on sample composition, processing of
the data, and the analysis techniques are presented in the
Online Methods section.
The multivariate GWAS identified thousands of
independent SNPs reaching the genome-wide significance
threshold of a=5x10-8 across hundreds of independent
loci, as shown in Figure 1A. See the Extended Data
section for the list of discovered loci per feature set.
Overall, MOSTest led to a threefold higher discovery than
the min-P approach. The difference in performance is
particularly pronounced when all features are combined,
as is also evident from the Miami plots shown in Figure
1B through E. As can be seen in Figure 1F, many loci
identified with MOSTest were shared across the three
feature subsets. Further, the number of MOSTestdiscovered loci for all features combined (347) is larger
than the summation of number of unique loci found when
analyzing the feature subsets individually (301). This
illustrates how MOSTest capitalizes on the distributed and
non-sparse nature of genetic effects through the
combination of features.
We carried out replication analyses of the GWAS results
in an additional 4,884 UKB participants, whose
neuroimaging data was released after we carried out our
primary analyses. The loci discovered through MOSTest
and min-P replicated at similar levels, with approximately
40% being significant in this smaller additional sample.
Therefore, the absolute number of loci replicating is three
times higher for MOSTest compared to min-P. The full
results are shown in the Extended Data.
We performed extensive validation of MOSTest
methodology and implementation, confirming that it has
correct type-I error in simulations with synthetic data
(Figure S4) and on real data under permutations (Figure
S2). We also carried out a formal comparison between the
MOSTest and MV-PLINK5, finding that the two methods
have similar statistical power for detecting associations
(Figure S1), while the MOSTest analysis ran 10,000 times
faster. Further, we performed LD score regression and
used the intercept to validate that MOSTest results are free
of genomic inflation (Table S5).

Figure 2. MOSTest increases effective sample size. Estimated percent of genetic variance explained by SNPs surpassing
the genome-wide significance threshold, on the y-axis, as a function of sample size, depicted on the x-axis on a log10
scale, for each of the feature sets and for both approaches. Percentages of genetic variance explained by discovered
SNPs with current sample size (N=26,502) are shown in parentheses.
Using the MiXeR tool 8,14 we fitted a Gaussian mixture
model of the null and non-null effects to the GWAS
summary statistics, estimating for each feature set the
number of SNPs involved, i.e. their combined
polygenicity, and their effect size variance, or
‘discoverability’. Please see the Online Methods for more
details. The results are summarized in Figure 2, depicting
the estimated proportion of genetic variance explained by
discovered SNPs by both approaches as a function of
sample size. The horizontal shift of the curve indicates
that the effective sample size of MOSTest is generally
about twice as high as that of min-P, with the highest
discovery for MOSTest when all features are combined,
and lowest discovery for the set of cortical thickness
features.
Cortical maps, depicting the morphological associations
of the lead SNPs identified with MOSTest on all features
with regional surface area and thickness measures, made
clear that these SNPs have distributed effects, often with
mixed directions, across regions and feature sets. As an
example, Figure 3 shows the maps for the top two hits
(rs1080066 on chromosome 15, p=1.2x10-305, and
rs13107325 on chromosome 4, p=3.1x10-124), all other
maps are available in the Supplementary Material. These
maps revealed anterior-posterior gradients as well as
hemisphere-specific effects of some of the lead SNPs, in
line with reported genetic patterns of the brain 15,16.

MOSTest have distributed effects across the cortex. Zvalues from the univariate GWAS for each cortical region
for the two most significant lead SNPs from MOSTest
applied to all features combined (left two columns for
rs1080066 on chromosome 15, and right two columns for
rs13107325 on chromosome 4). The top two rows show the
effects of the SNPs on regional surface area, and the bottom
two on cortical thickness. Positive effects of carrying the
minor allele are shown in red, and negative in blue. Note:
the absolute Z-value scaling is clipped at 8 (p=1.2*10-15),

Figure 4. Functional mapping and annotation indicates high neurobiological relevance of our findings. A. Number of
whole-genome significant genes identified (on the y-axis and in the bubbles) for each set of features (on the x-axis), by
MOSTest (in darker colored circles) and by min-P (in lighter colored squares). B. Results from the gene-set analyses
following the application of the multivariate GWAS on all brain features. The fifteen most significant Gene Ontology sets
for MOSTest are listed on the y-axis and -log10(p-values) are shown on the x-axis. MOSTest Bonferroni corrected pvalues are indicated by black circles, min-P in grey squares.
Gene-level analyses, using Multi-marker Analysis of
GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) 13,17, indicated that
1034 out of all 18,775 protein coding genes (i.e. 5.5%)
were significant, with a p-value below a Bonferroni
corrected threshold of =.05/18,775. Figure 4A shows
the number of significant genes for each set of features.
Through competitive gene-set analyses we identified 136
significant Gene Ontology sets for MOSTest applied to all
features, the vast majority of which related to neuronal
development and differentiation, with Figure 4B listing
the top fifteen.
Applying the MOSTest approach to structural brain
imaging data, we discovered more loci associated with
regional cortical and subcortical morphology than any
previous GWAS of brain morphology, even those that had
nearly double the sample size1,2. Further, a direct
comparison with established methods in the same sample
revealed a threefold increase in discovery. This
improvement indicates the presence of extensive shared
genetic architecture across brain regions and across
morphological measures, attesting to the importance of
estimating levels of polygenic overlap beyond those
indicated by genetic correlations8, and arguing for
techniques that boost discovery of genetic determinants
leveraging shared signal between traits18. Indeed,
overlapping genetic determinants are to be expected given
the shared genetic control of neurodevelopment across
brain regions19, and that similar molecular mechanisms
operate across regional borders defined by gross
morphological features. This is in accordance with the
high levels of pleiotropy across many brain-related traits
and disorders20. Therefore, our multivariate strategy is
better tailored to the underlying neurobiological processes
than conventional univariate approaches, as confirmed by
our identification of highly significant links to gene sets

of neuronal development and differentiation. Further, our
extensive validation of the MOSTest methodology and
implementation show that the MOSTest is a valid
statistical test with an improved statistical power to detect
associations in a multivariate context, suitable for
applications to large-scale data.
With the large gain of power and consequently lower
required sample sizes of MOSTest, we predict that it will
be possible to uncover the majority of SNPs influencing
brain morphology in the upcoming years. The UKB
initiative, for instance, is set to release neuroimaging data
of a 100,000 individuals by 202221, which we estimate
will enable MOSTest to identify SNPs that will explain
about 40% of the additive genetic variance in regional
brain morphology. The output of MOSTest is suited for
secondary analyses and follow-up studies to investigate
the relation between the set of loci discovered and
individual features, with a much decreased multiplecomparisons burden. The MOSTest code is publicly
available, see the Supplementary Materials. In addition to
brain structure, the MOSTest approach may also be of
value in uncovering the genetic determinants of brain
function and other complex human phenotypes consisting
of correlated component measures, such as mental,
cognitive or cardiometabolic phenotypes, by taking
advantage of the rich multivariate datasets now available.

Sample
We made use of data from participants of the UKB population cohort, obtained from the data repository under accession
number 27412. The composition, set-up, and data gathering protocols of the UKB have been extensively described
elsewhere22. For this study, we selected White Europeans that had undergone the neuroimaging protocol. For the primary
analysis, making use of T1 MRI scan data released up to April 2019, we excluded 1094 individuals with a primary or
secondary ICD10 diagnosis of a neurological or mental disorder, as well as 594 individuals with bad structural scan quality
as indicated by an age and sex-adjusted Euler number23 more than three standard deviations lower than the scanner site mean.
Our sample size for this analysis was n=26502, with a mean age of 55.51 years (SD=7.42). 51.97% of the sample was female.
For the replication analyses, we made use of an additional neuroimaging batch released in September 2019. After identical
preprocessing steps as the primary sample, this sample consisted of 4,884 individuals with a mean age of 55.47 years
(SD=7.37), 52.42% was female.
Data preprocessing
T1-weighted scans were collected from three scanning sites throughout the United Kingdom, all on identically configured
Siemens Skyra 3T scanners, with 32-channel receive head coils. The UKB core neuroimaging team has published extensive
information on the applied scanning protocols and procedures, which we refer to for more details21. The T1 scans were
obtained from the UKB data repositories and stored locally at the secure computing cluster of the University of Oslo. We
applied the standard “recon-all -all” processing pipeline of Freesurfer v5.3, performing automated surface-based
morphometry and subcortical segmentation11,12. From the output, we extracted the sets of regional subcortical and cortical
morphology measures, as well as estimated intracranial volume (eICV). Table S1 contains all the regional morphology
measures, per subset, included in the current study. For each of these, we included both the left and right hemisphere measure,
if applicable.
We subsequently regressed out age, sex, scanner site, Euler number, and the first twenty genetic principal components
from each measure. We further regressed out a global measure specific to each of the feature subsets: eICV for the subcortical
volumes, mean thickness for the regional thickness measures, and total surface area for the regional surface area measures.
This was done to ensure we are studying the genetic determinants of regional brain morphology rather than global effects.

where r" is the ordinary rank of the measure for i-th individual, N gives the sample size, Φ&' denotes the standard normal
quantile, y"# is the value after transformation, and c=0.5. This leads to normally distributed input into the univariate GWAS.
See the Extended Data section below for a more in-depth discussion of the importance of this normalization procedure.
Univariate GWAS procedure
We made use of the UKB v3 imputed data, which has undergone extensive quality control procedures as described by the
UKB genetics team25. After converting the BGEN format to PLINK binary format, we additionally carried out standard
quality check procedures, including filtering out individuals with more than 10% missingness, SNPs with more than 5%
missingness, and SNPs failing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test at p=1*10-9. We further set a minor allele frequency
threshold of 0.005, leaving 7,428,630 SNPs.
The univariate GWAS on each of the 171 pre-residualized and normalized regional brain morphology measures were
carried out using the standard additive model of linear association between genotype vector, g 2, and phenotype vector, y. To

speed up calculations we implemented the association test directly in MOSTest software. Statistical significance was assessed
from Pearson’s correlation coefficient r2 = corr(y, g ⋅2 ), as implemented in MATLAB’s corr function. This is equivalent to
testing significance of the regression slope, β:2 , as both β:2 and r2 are assumed to be t-distributed and have the same t-value:
t 2 = β2 /se?β2 @ = r2 /se(r2 ) = r2 √N − 2/F1 − r2- , and therefore the same p-value, equal to Student’s t cumulative
distribution function (cdf) with N − 2 degrees of freedom: PIJK,2 = 2 tcdf(−Nt 2 N, N − 2), where N is the sample size14. Further,
we validated that the above procedure produces the same results as the association test implemented in the commonly used
PLINK’s additive model, option plink --assoc.
Independent significant SNPs and genomic loci were identified in accordance with FUMA SNP2GENE definition13. First,
we select a subset of SNPs that pass genome-wide significance threshold 5x10-8 (calculated by minP or MOSTest), and use
PLINK to perform a clumping procedure at LD r2=0.6, to identify the list of independent significant SNPs. Second, we clump
the list of independent significant SNPs at LD r2=0.1 threshold to identify lead SNPs. Third, we query the reference panel
for all candidate SNPs in LD r2 of 0.1 or higher with any lead SNPs. Further, for each lead SNP, it's corresponding genomic
loci is defined as a contiguous region of the lead SNPs's chromosome, containing all candidate SNPs in r2=0.1 or higher LD
with the lead SNP. Finally, adjacent genomic loci are merged together if they are separated by less than 250 KB. Allele LD
correlations are computed from EUR population of the 1000 genomes Phase 3 data.
MOSTest procedure
Let z"2 be the value of signed test statistic (z-score) calculated from the univariate association test between j-th SNP and i-th
phenotype. Let z2 = (z'2 , … , zQ2 ) be the vector of z-scores of j-th SNP across K phenotypes. Let Z = {z"2 } be the matrix of zscores, with rows corresponding to SNPs, and columns corresponding to phenotypes. Further, let ZU = VzW"2 X be the matrix of
z-scores, calculated from association tests on a randomly permuted genotype vector of each SNP. To preserve correlation
structure among phenotypes, the permutation was performed only once for each SNP, and the resulting genotype vector was
used in association test across all phenotypes.
\&' z2, where R
\ is the KxK
The MOSTest test statistic, X2-, for the j-th SNP is calculated as Mahalanobis norm X2- = z2Z R
correlation matrix of ZU. The null hypothesis of the MOSTest is that z2 is distributed as a multivariate normal random variable
\. To compute the theoretical (i.e., under null) p-value of the MOSTest test statistic, we
with zero mean and covariance R
calculated the tail probability that a Chi-square statistics exceeds X2-. This probability is given by chi-square distribution with
N degrees of freedom, or, equivalently, a gamma distribution, Gamma(K/2,0.5)26. Instead of using theoretical values, we fit
the two free parameters of the Gamma(a,b) distribution to the observed distribution of X2- under permutation (shown in Table
S4). The p-value of the MOSTest test statistic is then obtained from a cumulative distribution function of the gamma
\&' z2 ).
distribution, p^_`Z = CDFdJeeJ(J,f) (z2Z R
Controlling for covariates, such as genetic principal components, is done via pre-residualization of all phenotype vectors,
i.e. we replace them with the corresponding residual after multiple linear regression of the phenotype vector on the covariates.
Additionally, we perform a rank-based inverse normal transformation of the residualized phenotypes, to ensure that z-scores
forming the input to MOSTest are normally distributed.
MOSTest code will be made publicly available through GitHub upon publication of this article,
https://github.com/precimed/mostest.
MiXeR analysis
We applied a causal mixture model8,14 to estimate the percentage of variance explained by genome-wide significant SNPs as
a function of sample size. For each SNP, i, MiXeR models its additive genetic effect of allele substitution, β" , as a pointnormal mixture, β" = (1 − π' )N(0,0) + π' N(0, σ-l ), where π' represents the proportion of non-null SNPs (`polygenicity`)
and σ-l represents variance of effect sizes of non-null SNPs (`discoverability`). Then, for each SNP, j, MiXeR incorporates
LD information and allele frequencies for 9,997,231 SNPs extracted from 1000 Genomes Phase3 data to estimate the
expected probability distribution of the signed test statistic, z2 = δ2 + ϵ2 = N ∑" qH" r"2 β" + ϵ2 , where N is sample size, H"
indicates heterozygosity of i-th SNP, r"2 indicates allelic correlation between i-th and j-th SNPs, and ϵ2 ∼ N(0, σ-t ) is the
residual variance. Further, the three parameters, π' , σ-l , σ-t, are fitted by direct maximization of the likelihood function. Fitting
the univariate MiXeR model does not depend on the sign of z2 , allowing us to calculate |z2 | from MOSTest p-values. Finally,
given the estimated parameters of the model, the power curve S(N) is then calculated from the posterior distribution
p?δ2 Nz2 , N).
Gene-set analyses
We made use of the Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS (FUMA) online platform (https://fuma.ctglab.nl/) to
further process the output from MOSTest and min-P. Through FUMA, we carried out MAGMA-based gene analyses using
default settings, which entail the application of a SNP-wide mean model and use of the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 EUR reference
panel. Gene-set analyses were done in a similar manner, restricting the sets under investigation to those that are part of the
Gene Ontology biological processes subset (n=4436), as listed in the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigdB) v5.2.

Results from the replication
Table S3 lists the results from the replication attempt of the main GWAS via MOSTest and min-P. For this, we used a new
batch of neuroimaging data of 4,884 healthy White European UKB participants that was released in October 2019, after we
ran our primary analyses and made the results of this available via bioRxiv. This data was processed identically to the main
sample and then analysed through MOSTest and min-P. We subsequently calculated the percentage of loci discovered in
the main analyses, per test and per feature set, that was nominally significant in this additional sample. As can be seen in
Table S3, for each combination of test and feature set, the replication rate was approximately 40%, indicating no major
difference in the replication rates. From this it follows that the absolute number of loci replicating is threefold higher for
MOSTest than for min-P.
Table S3.
Results from the replication of the genome-wide significant loci, identified through MOSTest and min-P in an additional
sample of 4,884 individuals. The column ‘# loci replicated’ indicates the amount of discovered loci in the main analysis
that surpass a nominal significance (p=.05) in the replication sample. The ‘fraction replicated’ column divides the number
of loci discovered in the main analysis with the number of loci that replicated.

Validation and formal comparison between MOSTest and other tools
Current multivariate approaches, such as canonical correlation analysis as implemented in MV-PLINK5 and ordinal
regression as implemented in MultiPhen4, perform a multiple regression in an opposite direction: the genotype vector is used
as an outcome variable, while each phenotype is turned into an explanatory variable. The p-value is then calculated from an
F-test, which tests for an association between the genotype vector and the most predictive linear combination of phenotypes
at each SNP. Figure S1 compares the -log10(p-value), calculated by MV-PLINK and MOSTest. MV-PLINK takes 10,000x
longer to run (requiring approximately 250K CPU hours, instead of 24 CPU hours with MOSTest), it was therefore infeasible
to run the analysis on the entire set of 7.4M SNPs. Instead we tested a set of 356 LD-independent SNPs (a subset of all
genome-wide significant SNPs remaining after LD-based clumping with r2=0.6 threshold) with a p-value from min-P below
the genome-wide significance threshold. The results show very high correlation (r=0.9976) between MV-PLINK and
MOSTest -log10(p-values), with median of 14.16 (MOSTest) versus 14.40 (MV-PLINK). Another recently developed
multivariate test, aMAT27, uses the same test statistic as MOSTest, but after applying regularization (spectral filtering) to the
correlation matrix R. In our data regularization wasn’t necessary, as the conditioning number was reasonably low, see Table
S4, leading to a well-defined matrix R-1.

Rank-based inverse normal transformation
We carried out a rank-based inverse normal transformation of the measures, otherwise non-normally distributed measures
can inflate p-values and thus elevate type-I error. Extended Data Figure 2 shows the empirical distribution of MOSTest and
min-P test statistics under the null (calculated via permutations), along with p-value calculated from the test, with the rankbased INT, showing correct behaviour. Extended Data Figure 3 shows the distributions after running MOSTest without the
transformation, leading to deviations, highlighting that this transformation is important for maintaining correct type-I error.

Extended Data Figure 2. Each subplot shows an empirical distribution of the min-P (top row) and MOSTest (bottom
row) test statistics under null (calculated via permutations), along with p-value calculated from the test. Columns
correspond to different sets of phenotypes included in the analysis. OX axis show the actual value of the test statistic: log10(min-P), for the min-P test, and z' R-1 z for MOSTest. The “Observed” plot shows empirical distribution of the test
statistic; “Fitted” plot shows p-values calculated from Gamma(a,b) distribution (MOSTest) and Beta(a,b) distribution
(min-P) after fitting the two parameters to the observed data.

Simulations for validation of correct type-I error in the presence of polygenic signal
Extended Data Figure 2 shows that under permutation, i.e. in the absence of the genetic signal, MOSTest p-values are
uniformly distributed. We performed further simulations on synthetic data to validate that MOSTest has correct type-I, not
just under null, but also in the presence of a polygenic signal. We used the real genotype matrix of 26,502 individuals from
our main analysis and simulated 175 phenotypes using a simple additive genetic model 𝑦 = 𝐺𝛽 + 𝜖, with the same phenotypic
correlation as we observed in our combined set of feature (cortical area, cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, including
CSF, left and right vessel, and optic chiasm). We randomly chose a set of 10K “causal” SNPs, but constrained them to odd
chromosomes only, leaving even chromosomes free of genetic signal. 10K “causal” SNPs were shared across the 175
phenotypes, but each phenotype has its own randomly generated 𝛽 vector of genetic effects. SNP heritability of each
phenotype was h2=0.3. Applying MOSTest to test data, we observe the resulting signal was completely flat for even
chromosomes, showing that regions that are not in LD with causal variants aren’t picked by MOSTest. These results are
visualized in Extended Data Figure 4.
