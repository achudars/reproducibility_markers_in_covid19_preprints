ABSTRACT
Small molecule inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) have been explored as a treatment
strategy for leukemia and lymphoma, however, the determinants of response to this class of drugs are
incompletely understood. PNP inhibitors impair cell proliferation by preventing catabolism of the nucleoside
deoxyguanosine (dG) which induces toxic imbalances amongst intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate
(dNTP) pools following its phosphorylation and trapping by nucleoside kinases. We hypothesized that
differential nucleoside uptake or catabolism defines cancer cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to PNP
inhibition. Among cancer cell lines we found that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are uniquely
and acutely sensitive to PNP inhibition whereas the B-cell leukemia and solid tumor models are completely
resistant. We determined that although the nucleoside scavenging kinase deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was
active in all cells tested, PNP inhibitors only induced dGTP pool increases in sensitive models. By evaluating
the expression of key genes involved in nucleotide scavenging, biosynthesis, and phosphohydrolysis in a panel
of sensitive and resistant cell lines we found that the dNTP phosphohydrolase SAM histidine aspartate
containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) was exclusively expressed in resistant models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 SAMHD1
knockout cell lines, we verified that PNP inhibitor sensitivity is a function of SAMHD1 expression and
determined that the pharmacological inhibition of dCK or genetic restoration of SAMHD1 conferred resistance
to PNP inhibition. Importantly, we determined that low expression of SAMHD1 is not limited to T-ALL as subset
of established and primary solid tumors models are SAMHD1-deficient. These solid tumor models were
consistently acutely sensitive to PNP inhibitors which indicates that the utility of PNP inhibitors extends beyond
hematological malignancies. Additionally, we found that deoxycytidine (dC) can limit the anti-proliferative
effects of PNP inhibitors by competing with dG for phosphorylation by dCK but this effect can be overcome by
expression of dC-catabolizing gene cytidine deaminase (CDA). Collectively, these results indicate that
SAMHD1, dCK and CDA are critical biomarkers that must be used to stratify patients in clinical trials evaluating
pharmacological PNP inhibition.

INTRODUCTION
A sufficient supply of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) is essential for cell growth, survival and
proliferation1,2. Thus, the metabolic network that is responsible for the synthesis of dNTPs is tightly regulated
by transcriptional, post-translational and allosteric control mechanisms3,4. Cancer cells are particularly reliant
on dNTP biosynthesis and this non-oncogene addiction has been leveraged clinically by the use of small
molecule inhibitors of rate-limiting metabolic enzymes including dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH),
ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS)5. These
drugs restrict the ability of cancer cells to synthesize dNTPs and trigger cell cycle arrest: effectively preventing
cell proliferation.

Beyond insufficiency, imbalance among dNTP pools results in mutagenesis, altered cell cycle progression or
death in specific cell types and can result in developmental defects. Examples include development of
mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE) as a consequence of down-regulation
of the thymidine catabolizing gene thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) and impaired T-cell development in
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) knockout mice resulting from unchecked expansion of dTTP pools in developing
hematopoietic cells6,7. Intriguingly, this cell type specific lethality resulting from dNTP imbalance has also been
linked to the pathology of severe-combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) a hereditary genetic disorder in humans
that is characterized by compromised immune function and premature death. Giblett and colleagues were
among the first to identify that inactivating, inherited mutations in the nucleotide catabolic enzymes adenosine
deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) drive the development of SCID8,9. ADA and
PNP function sequentially in the catabolism of purine deoxyribonucleosides dA and dG and counter their
intracellular accumulation mediated by deoxycytidine kinase dCK4. For reasons not well understood defective
dG catabolism results in remarkably selective T-cell defects, and otherwise normal cellular development, in
individuals with PNP-linked SCID10. This tissue specificity is thought to be related to the expression patterns of
the nucleoside kinases dCK and differential dG uptake11.

Decades later, the observations made by Giblett and colleagues were leveraged for the treatment of cancer
with the rationale that pharmacological inhibition of ADA or PNP could be an effective strategy for patients
affected by T- and B- cell leukemias and lymphomas12. In the 1990s, Schramm and colleagues spearheaded
the effort to develop small molecule PNP inhibitors using their knowledge of the transition state substrateenzyme structure to rationally design drugs with exceptionally high potency and selectivity13,14. PNP inhibitors
prevent the catabolism of deoxyguanosine (dG) to guanine and deoxyribose-1-phosphate thereby allowing the
intracellular conversion of dG to dGTP which can prevent de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine dNTPs via
allosteric inhibition of RNR15,16. Pharmacological PNP inhibition was found to selectively eradicate T-cell
leukemias in vitro thus mimicking the SCID phenotype14. With these encouraging results, the PNP inhibitor
Forodesine (also known as BCX-1777 or Immucillin H) progressed to clinical trials for the treatment of
relapsed/refectory T- and B-cell leukemias and lymphomas and received approval for the treatment of
peripheral T-cell lymphoma in Japan in 201717,18. Despite excellent tolerability and pharmacodynamic
properties in humans (evidenced by plasma accumulation of the PNP substrate dG and depletion in the
product of dG catabolism, uric acid) efficacy was observed only in a subset of patients.

It remains an open challenge to identify biomarkers predictive of PNP inhibitor response in cancer. Multiple
markers such as ATM, p53, ZAP-70, HGPRT and various nucleoside transporters have been studied in this
context but alone do not predict sensitivity19,20. With the goal of identifying metabolic determinants of PNP
inhibitor response, we focused our investigation on heterogeneity in nucleoside uptake, accumulation and
catabolism across panels of cancer cell lines. We found that the dNTP phosphohydrolase SAM histidine
aspartate containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which catabolizes dGTP into dG and triphosphate, was expressed
exclusively in resistant cell lines. We confirmed a role for SAMHD1 in the activity of PNP inhibitors using both
loss of function and gain of function genetic models. Additionally, we identified several solid tumor cell lines,
including lung cancer and melanoma, which are SAMHD1-deficient and confirmed that these models were
sensitive to PNP inhibition. Collectively these results demonstrate that SAMHD1 activity and not disease type
per se defines PNP inhibitor sensitivity.

RESULTS
SAMHD1 mediates response to PNP inhibition in leukemia cell lines
To identify cell line models sensitive and resistant to PNP inhibition, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effects
of dG, Forodesine (PNPi), and the combination across a panel of T- and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
cell lines using Cell Titer Glo. Importantly, PNP deficiency alone does not impair cell proliferation or survival in
vitro and endogenously generated concentrations of its substrate dG must be supplemented to recapitulate the
PNP-loss of function phenotype observed in vivo. We found that the T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM, JURKAT and
MOLT4 were eradicated by the combination whereas the B-ALL models NALM6 and RS411 were unaffected
(Figure 1A). We confirmed these findings using flow cytometry cell cycle analysis in which we observed an
increase in the percentage of sub-G1 cells, a maker for cell death, following PNP inhibition only in T-ALL
models (Figure 1B). Using immunoblot analysis, we found that PNP inhibitor treatment only induced DNA
damage (evidenced by H2AXS139 phosphorylation) and apoptosis (evidenced by cleaved caspase 3
accumulation) in CCRF-CEM and not in NALM6 cells (Figure 1C).

We reasoned that heterogeneity in the sensitivity to PNP inhibition could arise from the differential expression
of key metabolic genes essential for the synthesis and accumulation of dGTP. These genes include PNP itself,
dCK, essential and non-redundant for its ability to phosphorylate dG to dGMP, and SAMHD1, a dNTP
phosphohydrolase that catabolizes dGTP to dG (Figure 1D). By probing the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) gene expression database, we found that dCK and PNP were expressed at similar levels across Tand B-ALL cell line models21. In contrast, SAMHD1 was found to be expressed at high levels exclusively in BALL cell lines and undetectable in a subset of T-ALL cell lines (Figure 1E). Using immunoblot analysis, we
confirmed at the protein level that dCK is expressed at similar levels across T- and B-ALL models but SAMHD1
is only detected in B-ALL cell lines (Figure 1F). To functionally validate the role of SAMHD1 in the response to
PNP inhibition we engineered a CCRF-CEM genetic variant that constitutively expresses human SAMHD1
(Figure 1G). We found that expression of SAMHD1 rendered CCRF-CEM cells completely resistant to the antiproliferative (Figure 1H) and cytotoxic effects of PNP (Figure 1I).

SAMHD1-deficient solid tumor models are sensitive to PNP inhibitors.
To evaluate the spectrum of SAMHD1 expression across cancers and to determine if low SAMHD1 expression
was unique to T-ALL, we extended our analysis to the complete CCLE gene expression dataset (Figure 2A).
Beyond els, we identified several additional cell lines exhibiting low expression of SAMHD1, including
melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. We hypothesized that low SAMHD1
expression, and not disease type per se, predicts response to PNP inhibitors across cancer cell line models. To
test this we evaluated the activity of PNPi in the EGFR-mutant, SAMHD1-deficient lung adenocarcinoma cell
line HCC827 and found that the combination of dG and PNPi induced cell cycle arrest in this model(Figure
2B). We determined that this associated with proliferation inhibition by performing crystal violet analysis of
HCC827 cell cultured treated for 7 d (Figure 2C).

To functionally validate the role of SAMHD1 in the response of solid tumor cell line models to PNP inhibition,
knocked out SAMHD1 in the pancreatic cancer cell line SUIT2 using CRISPR/Cas9. We found that while
parental cells were completely resistant to PNPi, SAMHD1 knockout cells exhibited DNA damage in response
to PNPi. While dCK is the only cytosolic nucleoside kinase capable of phosphorylating dG, dG is also a
substrate for the mitochondria-localized deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and SAMHD1 has been shown to
generate substrates for dGK in the mitochondria22. Furthermore, dCK inactivation has also been associated
with resistance to dG-mediated toxicity in PNP-deficient T-lymphoma cells15. We found that the lethality of PNP
inhibitors be completely prevented by supplementing with a small molecule dCK inhibitor indicating that
phosphorylation of dG by dGK does not contribute to the observed lethality at these timepoints (Figure 2D)4.
Additionally, using crystal violet analysis we found that the proliferation of only SAMHD1 knockout cells could
be prevented by PNP inhibitors and that this anti-proliferative effect could be completely blocked by a dCK
inhibitor (Figure 2E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that SAMHD1 expression predicts sensitivity to
PNP inhibitors across leukemia and solid tumor cell line models.

A subset of primary melanoma cell line models are deficient in SAMHD1 expression and are sensitive
to PNP inhibitors
To investigate the extent of SAMHD1-deficiency across solid tumor models we profiled the expression of
SAMHD1 in a panel of 51 primary melanoma cell lines derived at UCLA (Figure 3A). We found that among
these models, 2 exhibited undetectable levels of the SAMHD1 transcript (M230, M418) and we confirmed
these findings using immunoblot analysis (Figure 3B). SAMHD1 function is tightly regulated by transcriptional,
post-transcriptional and allosteric control mechanisms and SAMHD1 has been identified as an interferon (IFN)stimulated gene 23,24. To determine if SAMHD1 expression can be induced in M230 and M418 cells by IFN, we
exposed a panel of melanoma cell lines to either type I (IFNβ) or type II (IFNγ) IFN for 24 h and measured
SAMHD1 expression using immunoblot analysis (Figure 3B). We found that all models tested responded to
both type I and type II interferon by increasing the expression of a canonical interferon stimulated gene STAT1,
however, SAMHD1 expression was only induced by IFN in cell line models in which SAMHD1 is detectable at
baseline. Impaired SAMHD1 expression in M418 and M230 cells could result from mutational inactivation,
which has been described in the contested of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or aberrant promoter methylation
which as been described in the context of lung cancer25,26.
We confirmed that PNP inhibition selectively inhibited proliferation in SAMHD1-deficient primary melanoma
models using crystal violet analysis (Figure 3C). Similarly, we observed that PNPi only induced cell cycle
arrest in SAMHD1-deficient models (Figure 3D).

dC mitigates the anti-proliferative effects of PNP inhibitors
An additional factor influencing the cytotoxicity of PNP inhibitors is the competition between dG and other
deoxyribonucleosides, for dCK (Figure 4B). dCK can accept dC, dG and dA as substrates but exhibits an 15fold higher affinity for dC over the other purine deoxyribonucleosides (BRENDA:EC2.7.1.74). Furthermore,
phosphorylation of dCK by ATR further increases its ability to phosphorylate dC while not impacting dA, or dG
phosphorylation27,28. In this model, the dC catabolizing enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA) can promote the
activity of PNP inhibitors by eliminating dC and decreasing competition with dG for dCK. To test this model, we

evaluated the ability of dC to prevent the anti-proliferative effect of PNP Inhibition in CCEF-CEM YFP control
cells and CDA over-expressing cells (Figure 4B). In CCRF-CEM YFP cells, PNP inhibition decreased
proliferation to 1% of control and supplementation 1 µM dC was sufficient to counteract the effects of PNPi and
restored proliferation to 60% of control. Overexpression of CDA prevented this rescue. We have previously
reported that plasma dC various greatly across species with levels ranging from 10 nM in human plasma and
non-human primates to > 1 µM in rodents (Figure 4C; figure adapted from Kim et al. PNAS. 2016). It is
conceivable that plasma deoxycytidine can prevent the activity of PNPi and can confound the study of PNP
inhibitors in mice. Thus, high-CDA expression should be considered a requisite biomarker for PNP inhibitor
sensitivity alongside low-SAMHD1 expression.

SAMHD1 prevents the anti proliferative effects of thymidine
Having observed that SAMHD1 can protect cancer cells from dGTP pool imbalance resulting from PNP
inhibition we investigated whether SAMHD1 can prevent the anti-proliferative effects of imbalances in other
dNTP pools. Elevations in dTTP, dATP or dGTP, but not dCTP, have been linked to impaired cell proliferation
which results from allosteric inhibition of RNR4. Supplementation of cell cultures with high levels of the
pyrimidine nucleoside thymidine is a well established approach to inhibit cell proliferation and synchronize cells
in S-phase29. Thymidine induced cell cycle arrest is the result of unchecked dTTP pool expansion and
allosteric inhibition of CDP reduction by RNR. This “thymidine block” can be completely reversed by
supplementation with dC in a dCK-dependent manner. This phenotype extends in vivo and is the cause of
impaired T-cell development observed in dCK knockout mice30. We found that SAMHD1 KO cells exhibited a
200-fold lower thymidine IC50 than SAMHD1 WT controls (Figure 5A). This selectivity was unique to thymidine
and did not extend to other RNR inhibitors, including 3-AP, which function by preventing RNR tyrosyl radical
regeneration4. Similar selectivity was observed using crystal violet proliferation analysis (Figure 5B).
Additionally, we found that the induction of pCHEK1S345 and pH2A.XS139 by dT treatment was enhanced in the
SAMHD1 KO cells. Collectively these results indicate that SAMHD1 protects cancer cells from toxic
imbalances in both purine and pyrimidine dNTP pools.

Ulodesine and Forodesine exhibit comparable potency and selectivity
In addition to forodesine an additional small molecule inhibitor of PNP, Ulodesine (also known as BCX-4208)
has been developed and evaluated in humans for the treatment of gout31. To determine if ulodesine exhibits
similar potency and selectivity towards SAMHD1-deficient cancer cells we evaluated inhibition of cell
proliferation using Cell Titer Glo (Figure 6). We found that both forodesine and ulodesine impaired HCC827
proliferation selectively in the presence of dG with IC50 values of 71 and 21 nM respectively. We expanded
this analysis to a panel of cancer cells and found that ulodesine selectively impaired the proliferation of
SAMHD1 deficient cancer cell lines JURKAT, CCRF-CEM, and HCC827 while exhibiting negligible activity
against SAMHD1-proficient SUIT2 and NALM6 cells (Figure 7A). We confirmed a role for SAMHD1 by
demonstrating that overexpression of SAMHD1 in CCRF-CEM resulted in resistance and CRISPR/Cas9
knockout of SAMHD1 in SUIT2 cells rendered them sensitive to ulodesine (Figure 7B).

CDA overexpression mitigates competition between dC and dG in HCC827 cells
To determine if CDA can prevent the competition between dC and dG in HCC827 cells we generated CDA
over-expressing HCC827 cells using retroviral transduction. We found that HCC827 cells express CDA
endogenously which was enhanced with overexpression (Figure 8A). We found that dC could prevent the
lethality of the dG/ulodesine combination with an EC 50 of 1.9 µM in control cells. The dC EC 50 was increased
over 11-fold to 21 µM in the CDA over-expressing isogenic cells (Figures 8A, 8B).

DISCUSSION
Synthetic lethality refers to the scenario where impaired function of either of two genes alone is tolerated where
simultaneous loss results in cell death32. This concept has been explored extensively in the context of anticancer therapy with the goal of identifying synthetic lethal partners with cancer-associated genomic alterations.
Perhaps the most well-studied example is the acute sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient cancer cells to PARP
inhibitors33. Here we add to the library of synthetic lethal interactions in cancer and identify PNP activity as a
targetable co-dependency of cells for deficient for SAMHD1.

Mutational inactivation of PNP has been linked linked to a remarkably selective T-cell deficiency phenotype in
humans. We propose that the lack of SAMHD1 expression in developing thymocytes, and not dCK expression
alone, underlies this selectivity. Interestingly, similar tissue selectively was observed in dCK knockout mice and
has been linked to an imbalanced dTTP pool suggesting that SAMHD1 may play a role in this phenotype30.
SAMHD1 has been shown to be expressed in mature T-cells but the reasons for its inactivation in developing
hematopoietic tissues are unclear34. This altered expression may be linked to the high-rate of proliferation, and
high dNTP demand, of these developing cells. It is likely that ALL cells are progeny of this immature T-cell
population. An important corollary of our work is the finding that pharmacological dCK inhibition mitigates the
phenotypes associated with PNP inactivation which suggests that dCK inhibitors could have utility in the
treatment of PNP or ADA-linked SCID.

Interestingly, dGTP functions not only as a substrate by also as an allosteric activator of SAMHD1. SAMHD1
possesses two nucleotide-binding allosteric regulatory sites which effectively tune its function. Allosteric site 1
binds either GTP or dGTP and allosteric site 2 binds either dGTP, dATP, dCTP or dTTP. While the species of
allosteric site-bound nucleotides influences the Km of SAMHD1 for its substrate, the Km for dGTP is lowest
regardless of the combination of bound regulatory nucleotides24. Taken together, these findings suggest that a
primary function of SAMHD1 is to sense and restrict any increases in dGTP pool size.

We found that PNP inhibition triggers replication stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in SAMHD1-deficient
cells. However, the mechanistic link between dGTP pool expansion and induction of phenotypes remains
incompletely defined. The lethal effects of dGTP pool imbalance could result dNTP insufficiency resulting from
allosteric inhibition of pyrimidine nucleotide reduction by RNR15. Small molecule inhibitors of ATR, including
M6620 and AZD6738, are currently being investigated in phase I/II trials against solid tumors and may
represent rational companions for PNP inhibitors35. Furthermore, as SAMHD1-deficiency is requirement for
PNP activity in cancer cells the development of SAMHD1 inhibitors would broaden the patient population that
could be treated with forodesine or ulodesine. However, broad non-specific toxicity is a potential limitation of
this approach and it remains to be determined whether a sufficient therapeutic window exists for combinations
of PNP and SAMHD1 inhibitors.

Several nucleoside analog PET probes have been developed and are routinely used in the clinic in the
oncology setting. The purine nucleoside analog 18F-CFA may be particularly useful in identifying tumors most
likely to accumulate dGTP following PNP inhibition as it is sensitive to alterations in the expression of both
CDA and dCK36.

SAMHD1 has been shown to regulate multiple biological processes, including: retrovirus (HIV) restriction,
cGAS/STING activation and therapeutic efficacy of nucleoside-analog chemotherapies such as cytarabine in
acute myeloid leukemia37–39. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAMHD1-prevents lethal
imbalances among natural dNTP pools and identify SAMHD1 expression as a biomarker for PNP inhibitor
activity.

As PNP inhibitors have demonstrated excellent bioavailability in humans our work strongly supports reigniting
their evaluation in biomarker-driven anti-cancer trials. Collectively, our results indicate that SAMHD1, CDA and
dCK expression are requisite biomarkers that must be taken into consideration in any future clinical trials
evaluating PNP inhibitors. Additionally, our findings challenge the dogma that disease type (i.e. T-cell

in the treatment of a precisely defined subset of both hematological cancers and solid tumors.

METHODS
Experimental Model and Subject Details
Cell culture
All cell cultures were between passages 3 and 20 and maintained in antibiotic free DMEM or RPMI +10%
dialyzed FBS, at 37ºC in 5% CO2. We routinely monitored for mycoplasma contamination using the PCRbased Venor Mycoplasma kit. PDAC cell lines were acquired either from a commercial vendor (ATCC, DSMZ)
or from collaborators. Cell line identity was independently authenticated by PCR.
Drugs
Drug stocks were prepared in DMSO or H2O and diluted fresh in cell culture media for treatments.

Method Details
Propidium iodide cell cycle analysis:
Treated cells were washed with PBS and suspended in propidium iodide cell cycle staining solution (100 µg/ml
propidium iodide; 20 µg/ml Ribonuclease A). 10,000 events were collected per sample. All flow cytometry data
were acquired on five-laser BD LSRII, and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Viability analysis
For CellTiter-Glo analysis cells were plated at 1x103 cells / well in 50 µl / well in white opaque 384-well plates
and treated as described. Following incubation 50 µl of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Diluted 1:5 in dH2O) was added
to each well, plates incubated at room temperature for 5 m and luminescence was measured using a BioTek
microplate luminescence reader. Proliferation rate normalized growth inhibition was calculated using the
previously described GR metric 40.
For crystal violet staining, cells were plated in 6-well cell culture plates at 1x104 cells/well and treated as
described. Following treatment cells were fixed by incubating in 4% PFA in PBS for 15 m at room temperature.
Plates were subsequently washed with PBS and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in H2O for 15 m at room
temperature.

Immunoblot analysis
PBS-washed cell pellets were resuspended in cold RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Protein lysates were normalized using BCA assay, diluted using RIPA and 4x laemmli loading dye,
resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5%
nonfat milk in TBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), membranes were incubated overnight in primary antibodies
diluted (per manufacturers instructions) in 5% BSA in TBS-T. Membranes were washed with TBST-T and
incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibodies prepared at a 1:2500 dilution in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T.
HRP was activated by incubating membranes with a mixture of SuperSignal Pico and SuperSignal Femto ECL
reagents (100:1 ratio). Exposure of autoradiography film was used for detection.

Retroviral transduction and stable cell line generation
The pMSCV-hCDA-IRES-EYFP plasmid was described previously41. Amphotropic retroviruses were generated
by transient co-transfection of the MSCV retroviral plasmid and pCL-10A1 packaging plasmid into PhoenixAmpho packaging cells.

Generation of SAMHD1 knockout cells using CRISPR/Cas9
A SAMHD1-targeting gRNA(TCTCGGGCTGTCATCGCAAC) was cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 backbone
and used for transfection of SUIT2 cells using Lipofectamine3000. Following transfection, SUIT2 cells were
selected with 5 µg/mL puromycin for 72 h and singly cloned in 96-well plates. Knockout clones were validated
using immunoblot analysis.
