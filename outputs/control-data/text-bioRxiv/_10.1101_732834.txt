Abstract

21

Considering climate change and expected changes in temperature and precipitation, some

22

introduced timber species are prospective for growing in Germany or Europe to produce

23

valuable wood products and support sustainable forestry. The Californian tree, coast redwood

24

(Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) is one of such species due to its excellent wood

25

properties and high growth rate. It is sensitive to the freezing temperatures, but several trees of

26

unknown origin introduced to Germany decades ago demonstrated high frost tolerance, and

their propagated cuttings were planted all over German botanic gardens and arboreta. The

28

knowledge of their origin within the natural distribution range could help us identify the

potential genetic resources of frost resistant coast redwood genotypes. Therefore, both trees of

30

unknown origin in Germany (G) and two reference data sets representing the “Kuser

31

provenance test” established in 1990 in France (F) and samples collected in California (C) with

32

known origin were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers including 12 nuclear and six

33

chloroplast simple sequence repeat (cpSSR) markers. The number of haplotypes found in the

34

data sets based on six cpSSR markers was surprisingly very high. These markers were used to

35

assign the German frost resistant trees (G) to the two reference data sets (F and C). The genetic

36

structure among California samples (C) based on nSSR and cpSSR markers was very weak and

mainly due to northern and southern clusters separated by the San Francisco Bay as a

It was impossible to confidently assign frost tolerant trees (G) to single native populations, but

rather to either the northern or southern cluster. However, the existing frost tolerant genotypes

can already be used to establish commercial coast redwood plantation for future German

forestry.

Introduction

46

Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) is one of the four redwood species in

47

the world. All of them are characterized by a particular red coloured wood, an endemic narrow

48

natural distribution range and listed as threatened or endangered by the IUCN [1,2]. Coast

49

redwood stands out from the other three redwood species due to its valuable wood, high growth

50

rate and natural vegetative reproduction [3-5]. It is a very important timber species in the natural

51

range along the pacific coast in northern California and in the outside regions with similar

52

climatic conditions established for timber production in several countries, such as France [6],

53

New Zealand [7], and China [8]. The natural distribution range includes three plant hardiness

54

zones 9b, 10a, and 10b (from -4 °C to 5 °C) categorized as humid Mediterranean climate [9].

55

Therefore, coast redwood usually experiences light frost only few weeks during the year [2]

56

and is frost sensitive, especially at young age [3]. The coast redwood needles are capable to

57

uptake water directly from the atmosphere [10], and coast redwood highly depends on frequent

58

fogs that compensate the low precipitation during summer months [3,11].

59

Increased precipitation and temperature in winter are expected in central Europe [12]

60

including some regions in Germany and making its environment more suitable for some foreign

61

tree species, such as coast redwood. Meanwhile, in some regions climate change will negatively

62

affect native species [13]. Considering climate change, and the forecast for future climate,

63

Germany forestry needs new adaptive management strategies [14]. To maintain German

64

forestry and the growing demand for wood products in Europe more non-native tree species

65

should be tested for potential introduction. One of the successful examples is the North

66

American species Douglas-fir widely established in European forestry [15,16]. The predicted

67

altitudinal shift in the distribution of woody species [12,17] due to climate change would make

68

Germany more suitable also for species adapted to the Mediterranean climate, such as coast

69

redwood.

70

Coast redwood has already been introduced to Europe as an exotic species [18]. Plant

71

hardiness zones in Germany range from 7a (-17 to -15 °C) to 9a (-6 to -4 °C) [19] and present

72

currently high risk for planting coast redwood as a timber species in Germany. The hardiness

73

zones 8b (-12 to -9 °C) and 8a (-9 to -6 °C) along the Rhine valley in western Germany have

74

climate conditions most similar to the natural distribution range of coast redwood, therefore

75

most coast redwood trees were planted there. To mitigate climate change associated with

76

predicted possible extreme droughts and low temperature occurrences in central Europe,

77

German forestry needs to implement adaptive management based on frost and drought resistant

78

genotypes of major timber species including introduced species such as coast redwood [6].

79

Information on their origins helps to select such genotypes. For instance, some of the coast

80

redwood trees planted in the Rhine valley were frost resistant and survived temperatures as low

81

as -20 °C [18], but their origins are unknown. The knowledge of the climatic conditions at their

82

origins within the natural range could support this observation. Ideally, frost resistance should

83

be also verified in controlled frost experiments.

84

Coast redwood is a hexaploid species and among only a few natural polyploids in

85

gymnosperms [20-22]. It is a unique and valuable species, but its genetic structure is still

86

insufficiently studied [23-30]. The earlier published results based on a range wide sample

87

genotyped using six nuclear [31] and one chloroplast [30] microsatellite markers suggested high

88

genetic diversity and low population differentiation with a weak indication of two clusters. It

89

was demonstrated earlier that chloroplasts are strictly paternally inherited in coast redwood

90

[32]. Coast redwood is prone to vegetative clonal propagation, and clone identification was

91

possible for coast redwood with high confidence using the available microsatellite markers

92

[29,33]. Here we used available microsatellite or nuclear simple sequence repeat (nSSR)

93

[26,31,33] and newly developed chloroplast SSR (cpSSR) and expressed sequence tag-SSR

94

(EST-SSR) [34] markers to increase the resolution of population differentiation within the

95

natural distribution range intending also to discriminate populations growing under suboptimal

96

conditions.

97

The main objectives of this study were to 1) compare genetic population structure resolution

98

of nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers, 2) study chloroplast microsatellite haplotype

99

diversity based on a range-wide dataset, and 3) assign German frost resistant individuals to

100

reference populations in California using cpSSRs.

Sample collection

103

Three data sets were used in this study: French (F), Californian (C), and German (G). The

104

French data set F consisted of samples representing 153 trees from one of the international

105

provenance test coast redwood planting site established in 1990 in St. Fargeau, central France

106

by Kuser et al. [34] (so-called “Kuser provenance test”). It was established using seedlings

107

representing 90 provenances of the natural distribution range of S. sempervirens. The

108

individuals were propagated by cuttings and used to establish hedge orchards in California,

109

Oregon, Spain, Britain, France, and New Zealand. In 2014, needle or cambium material of 153

110

surviving trees was collected in St. Fargeau and frozen until DNA extraction. In 1992, after a

111

late frost occurrence in 1991, good frost tolerance was observed by the owner for 12 of the 158

112

collected trees (unpublished data). The data set F was compared with another “Kuser

113

provenance test” experiment established in 1984 at a site, close to Berkeley, California, named

114

the Russell Reserve. Douhovnikoff and Dodd [31] partitioned the Russell Reserve trees into 17

115

watersheds according to their original latitude location and the GPS coordination data (Error!

116

Reference source not found.) for population genetic structure analysis based on the six nSSR

117

markers [31]. To compare our data with their results and population based analyses [31], the

118

St. Fargeau samples were also partitioned into 17 watersheds according to the mean latitude

119

values for each watershed published in Douhovnikoff and Dodd [31] (S1 Table). Original

120

locations of the ‘Kuser’ samples placed on the map with the mean monthly temperature pattern

121

for the time period 1979-2013 are presented in S1 Fig.

125

The Californian data set C consisted of samples from 16 locations within the natural

126

distribution range in central and northern California collected during the field trip in 2017. The

127

locations were chosen according to their geographic position and the climatic conditions.

Further, the original locations of the 12 frost resistant trees in the St. Fargeau provenance test

. Unfortunately, one of the populations in southern Oregon was selected for sampling, but

144

could not be visited during the field trip in 2017 due to forest fires. The optimal climatic

145

conditions for S. sempervirens are along the coast, with high oceanic influence and humidity

146

and high ground water level [35]. The selected locations were at higher altitude, more interior,

147

and less foggy, and therefore represented drier and more extreme habitats [11,36]. Sampled

148

trees had a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least 15 cm. The collected needle material was

dried on silica gel. Number of samples, historic precipitation, and mean temperature per

The set was partitioned either into the 17 watersheds according to Douhovnikoff and Dodd

155

[31] or two groups of northern and southern (south of the Napa Valley) watersheds,

156

respectively.

157

The German data set G represented three collection sites: “Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen”,

158

“Aboretum Burgholz”, and “Weltwald in Bad Grund” (S2 Fig). The “Sequoiafarm

159

Kaldenkirchen” was established by the Martin family in the 1950’s using S. sempervirens

160

seedlings representing likely a single tree from the Californian “Schenck-Grove”, Prairie Creek

161

Redwoods State Park (Humboldt County, California, USA). Cuttings from these “best

162

performing” clones were planted all over Germany and are known as the “Martin-Clones” (M.

163

Geller, pers. communication). They were planted also at the two other sites, “Aboretum

164

Burgholz” and “Weltwald Bad Grund”, in unknown numbers and combinations. The

165

“Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen” and “Aboretum Burgholz” are both located in the Rhine-valley

166

in the plant hardiness zones 8a and 8b [19], respectively. The “Weltwald Bad Grund” is an

167

arboretum located in the western Harz Mountains near Bad Grund with relatively cold winters

168

and dry summers, typical for the plant hardiness zone 7b. Additional individual trees were

169

collected from botanic gardens in the following colder regions of Germany: Chemnitz (CH1),

170

Bayreuth (BA030549 and BA 10067), and Göttingen (GOE_B, GOE_G, GOE_K, and

171

GOE_P). Chemnitz and Bayreuth belong to the plant hardiness zone 7a, and Göttingen to zone

172

7b. Fresh needle material was collected from all these individual trees in Germany and frozen

173

at -20 °C until DNA extraction.

174

Needles from 30 approximately three years old clones, including 2-3 ramets per clone,

175

respectively, were collected in the Allerweltsgrün nusery (Köln) and frozen at -20 °C (S3 Fig).

176

DNA isolation and PCR amplification of the microsatellite (SSR) markers

177

DNA was isolated from needles using the DNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)

178

following the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated DNA was diluted in ddH2O 1:10 for

179

PCR amplification and stored at -20 °C.

180

Twelve nuclear (five nSSR and seven EST-SSR) and six chloroplast (cpSSR) microsatellite

181

markers were used in this study to genotype samples in all three data sets F, C and G (S3 Table).

182

The same touch-down PCR program was used for all 18 PCR primer pairs following the

183

protocol described in Breidenbach et al. [37]. The PCR products were separated and visualized

184

using the ABI genetic analyser 3130xl with GENSCAN ROX 500 as an internal size standard.

185

Verification of the nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) markers

186

The PCR primer nucleotide sequences for the nSSR markers were mapped to the S.

187

sempervirens draft nuclear and chloroplast genome assemblies that become very recently

188

publicly available to verify annealing sites for the microsatellite markers used in this study. The

189

primer

190

ftp://ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/Redwood/Assembly/v1.0 using the CLC Genomic Workbench

191

v11.0.1 software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the following parameters: complete match

192

for the last 15 nucleotides at 3’ end, maximum mismatch for 3 nucleotides per annealing site in

193

total, and a maximum of 400 nucleotides between annealing sites.

194

Genotyping of the nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) markers

195

GeneMapper 4.1. (Applied Biosystems) was used for visualization and fragment size calling of

196

the PCR products. S. sempervirens is a hexaploid species [38], which complicates microsatellite

197

scoring [33,39]. In this study, we used the genotyping method of Pfeiffer et al. [40] to identify

198

consistent and reproducible alleles. Following this method, all detected fluorescent peaks

199

representing different PCR amplified fragments were assigned in each sample to one of the 10

200

rank categories according to the shape and intensity of the peak and the motif of the primer. It

201

was done for all samples representing 30 clones, including 2-3 ramets per clone. To determine

202

which ranking has the highest probability to be correct, input files with different ranking

203

combinations from category 7 to 10 with all 12 primers were built. For example, for the ranking

204

combination 7, all peaks of each sample assigned to the category 7 and above (8, 9 and 10) were

205

included in the analysis, for the ranking combination 8, all peaks of each sample assigned to

206

the category 8 and above (9 and 10) were included into the analysis; etc. The R-package

207

“polysat” [41] was used for each ranking combination data set to calculate the pairwise ‘bruvo

208

genetic distance’ between individuals [42]. Using the R-package “ape” [43] and the pairwise

209

distance matrix, a Neighbour Joining (NJ) consensus tree was generated based on 1000

210

bootstraps. Since each marker characteristic differed, 25 different ranking combinations for the

211

markers were tested. The ranking combination with the highest bootstrap values and correct

212

grouping of the ramets representing the same clone was used for all further genotype scoring.

213

The NJ results were confirmed with the function “assignClones” of the R-package “polysat”

214

using the miss-matching threshold of 0.2 [44].

215

The markers were finally ranked between 7 to 10 (Error! Reference source not

216

found.Table). The NJ tree (NJT) based on the final ranking combination of the markers and

217

1000 bootstraps is presented in S3 Fig.

218

In addition, for the data sets F and C, scored genotypes were converted also into a presence-

219

absence matrix, and the Nei’s genetic distances ([45] after [46]) were calculated between

220

watersheds F and populations C using the AFLPsurv software with 1000 permutations [47].

221

The genetic distance matrix was used to generate a NJT with the PHYLIP v369 software [48],

222

respectively. The consensus tree was visualized using the FIGTREE software [49].

223

Genotyping of the chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) markers and haplotype network

224

Due to the haploid nature of chloroplasts, genotyping of the cpSSR markers was easier and

225

unambiguous. Based on all three data sets, a haplotype network was built using the Goldstein

226

distance [50] in the program EDENetwork v2.28 [51]. The program calculates a weighted

227

network based on the Goldstein distance between haplotypes with an automatically calculated

228

percolation threshold of 2.67 [52].

230

The individuals from the German data set G were assigned to the data sets F and C using the

231

GeneClass2 software [53]. To do that eight closely located sampling sites (< 1.0 km) were

232

combined into four. PUC and LPF were combined into LPF (watershed M), MtMa1 and MtMa2

233

into MtMa (watershed O), HW1 and HW2 into HW (watershed G), and JDF and CCJDF into

234

JDF (watershed J). A quality assessment was based on the self-assignment test following

235

Hintsteiner et al. [16] using the computation criteria of Rannala and Mountain [54], the

236

simulation algorithm of Paetkau et al [55] with 10 000 resampled individuals, and Type 1 error

237

of 0.01 [55,56]. NJTs were based on Nei’s genetic distance ([45] after [46]) and 1000 bootstraps

238

for the reference data sets C and F and generated using the R-packages “adegenet” [57,58] and

239

“poppr” [59,60].

240

STRUCTURE analysis

241

Based either on 12 nSSR or six cpSSR markers input files with the original allele sizes for the

242

data sets F and C were used by the STRUCTURE v2.3.4. program [61-64] to infer the most

243

likely potential number of distinct genetic clusters (K) by testing for different number of K from

244

1 to 24 with 20 iterations per run using the MCMC with 10 000 burn in’ and 100 000 final

245

iterations assuming the admixture model. The STRUCTURE HARVESTER [65] and the

246

ClumPPAK [66] programs were used to visualize the STRUCTURE results and to help

247

determining the most likely number of clusters using the ∆K approach. The STRUCTURE

248

analyses were repeated also with the “locprior” optional parameter engaged (which is used to

249

assist the clustering by specifying populations a prior), because low population differentiation

250

was expected. Following the STRUCTURE HARVESTER results, the data sets F and C were

251

divided each into two separately analysed groups - 12 northern populations and four southern

252

populations of the San Francisco Bay (south of the Napa Valley) to test for further clustering

253

within these two groups using the same STRUCTURE settings.

Results

255

Mapping of the PCR primer nucleotide sequences for the SSR markers against the draft coast

256

redwood nuclear and chloroplast genome assemblies found annealing sites facing each other in

257

a correct configuration allowing amplification for all six chloroplast markers and eight out of

258

12 nuclear markers (see S4 Table for details). Three different single scaffolds included

259

annealing sites for three markers ss36782, ss73361, and ss114481, respectively, two different

260

scaffolds included annealing sites for each of two markers RW48 and ss73307, respectively,

261

three, four, and six different scaffolds included annealing sites for ss73978, ss91170, and

262

ss74800 markers. The chloroplast markers all had only a single annealing site per each marker

263

in the chloroplast genome, but multiple scaffolds also contained annealing sites. The latter could

264

be due to either not complete removal of chloroplast sequences from the nuclear genome

265

assembly or presence of chloroplast sequences in the nuclear genome as a result of

266

misassembling or migration of chloroplast genes to the nuclear genome [67-69].

267

The NJTs for the data sets F and C had low bootstrap values below 60 % indicating weak

268

differentiation between watersheds and populations based on 12 nSSR markers (Fig 3 and 4),

269

excepts for two watershed pairs P-Q and E-G in the data set F (Fig 3) and populations AET and

270

CCJDF in the data set C (Fig 4). The NJTs based on the cpSSR markers showed higher

271

bootstrap values for most clusters, but they did not reflect their geographic relationship (S4 and

272

S5 Figs).

The STRUCTURE analysis also suggested very low differentiation with maximum two

282

clusters (K = 2) for the data sets F and C (Fig. Fig. ). Additional STRUCTURE analysis

283

performed separately within the northern and southern subpopulations did not find additional

284

clusters and confirmed that the differentiation observed in the data sets F and C was mainly due

285

to the differences between northern and southern populations. The “locprior” function did not

286

affect much the STRUCTURE results, therefore only results obtained with this function

287

engaged are presented in Fig. Fig. 6, and results obtained with the “locprior” function

288

disengaged can be found in S7 and S8 Figs.

In the data set G, 95 individual trees from the Burgholz stand were identified as likely clones

296

of the SF72 tree from the “Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen”. Other individuals from Burgholz and

297

Bad Grund were very similar to the SF76 tree, but with insufficient statistical support to assign

298

them all unambiguously to one clone.

299

Based on six cpSSR markers, 63 haplotypes in the data set F, 109 in C, and 22 in G were

300

found. All three data sets combined contained 150 different haplotypes (Fig. 7). The haplotype

301

network and its percolated clusters generated by the EDENetwork software indicated no

302

geographic structure in relationships between the haplotypes (Fig. ). More than half of all

303

haplotypes were unique - 89 haplotypes occurred only once within the three data sets. The

304

haplotypes GG and KK were the most frequent and were observed with frequency 17 % and

305

14 %, respectively.

Most of the assignments of German trees to the southern or northern populations divided by the
San Francisco Bay in the reference data set C with scores above 48 % were in agreement with
the assignments in the reference data set F (Error! Reference source not found.). While some
samples with scores below 48 % were assigned to geographically very different watersheds.
For example, B11 and SF77 were assigned to RERI south of the San Francisco Bay (watershed
O) based on the reference data set C, but to Del Norte close to the Oregon border (watershed
B) based on reference F (Table 1, Error! Reference source not found.). The individuals from
the Sequoiafarm, which were half- or full siblings according to the owner, were assigned to
various watersheds (F) and locations (C).

Discussion
The low population differentiation within the natural distribution range of S. sempervirens
based on the supposedly selectively neutral nuclear and chloroplast markers and both reference
data sets F and C, respectively, confirmed results of previous studies [24,25,31]. The NJT for
the data set F based on 12 nSSR markers in our study was in consensus with the NJT calculated
for the same 12 watersheds (A-Q) by Douhovnikoff and Dodd [31] using clones from the
Russell Reserve. To facilitate comparison between these two phylogenetic trees, the watershed
I (Mendocino County) was also used as a root of the NJT. The discrepancies between the two
trees could be explained by very low bootstrap support for most clusters in both trees and by
using the pairwise FST values for clustering in Douhovnikoff and Dodd [31] instead of the Nei’s
genetic distance used in our study. Moreover, the calculations in Douhovnikoff and Doddwere
based on less than half of nSSR markers (6 vs. 12), and only two of these markers were used in
both studies.
The STRUCTURE analyses based on 12 nSSR and six cpSSR markers confirmed the NJT
results of low differentiation, but analyses based on the cpSSR markers were able to identify
the San Francisco Bay as a border between two main clusters of populations. However, the

obtained results also had only low statistical support (S7 and S8 Figs). The STRUCTURE
analyses within each of the two areas, north and south of the Bay, did not reveal any additional
clusters, neither in the dataset F nor C. Our data confirmed the San Francisco Bay as a border
suggested already earlier by Brinegar [30] based on a single chloroplast marker. It is in
consensus also with one of two borders identified by Sawyer et al. [70] based on the soil
conditions and water availability provided by precipitation and fog.
The lack of strong population structure and low genetic differentiation can explain the
inconsistent assignment of German trees to populations in both reference data sets C and F and
the low QI for them. For reliable assignment a stronger differentiation between populations in
a reference data set and sufficient sample size of each reference population are needed
[15,71,72]. Sample sizes were possibly insufficient for some populations in the reference C and
F ranging from 4 to 47 individuals per population or watershed. However, considering the
results of the STRUCTURE analyses that suggested northern and southern clusters, all but five
German trees were assigned correctly to these clusters (Error! Reference source not found.).
The potential errors in the records on the origin of trees in the reference populations need
also to be taken into account when considering the reliability of the assignment of individuals
to an origin, because individuals with wrongly identified origin within the reference population
can decrease the assignment quality [56]. The possibility of trees with wrongly identified origin
and non-local genotypes being included in the two reference sets was quite high because coast
redwood is a heavily used timber species with a long tradition of planting, replanting, and plant
material transfer [73]. Trees from areas north of San Francisco Bay might have been planted in
the south and vice versa. This is really hard to detect and could only be verified in a
comprehensive and detailed population genetic study of natural coast redwood populations in
California and Oregon.
The reliable clone identification in the data set G (S6 Fig) confirmed results of previous
studies based on allozyme and AFLP markers [24,74].

General difficulties to accurately genotype microsatellite markers in polyploid organisms
excludes analyses based on their allele frequencies [33,75-78]. It concerns also coast redwood,
but genotyping problems could be even more aggravated due to a high probability of somatic
mutations in basal sprouting shoots in these extremely long living trees, which can result in
different genotypes of different tissues and clones originated from the same tree [33]. The
assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is also tricky due to common clonal growth in coast
redwood populations [66], where trees within 40 m distances can belong to the same clone [74].
The correct estimation of the null allele frequencies and allelic dosage are two major
difficulties associated with genotyping polyploidy organisms using microsatellite markers [79].
In our study the risk of null alleles should be reduced since null alleles are in general less
frequent in EST-SSRs due to their location in more conserved sequences [79], although they
are still possible and could affect the assignment results in this study. The Bruvo distance used
as the genetic distance measure in this study does not require same allelic dosages between
individuals [41,42]. The fragment scoring following Pfeiffer et al. [40] and confirmation of
allele scoring using multiple ramets of the same clones reduced the scoring errors due to the
stutter effects in this study. Narayan et al. [33] considered only those alleles for the multilocus
lineages (MLL) that were consistent in at least two different tissue types of the same tree, and
they found a low error rate in allelic dosage in coast redwood based on the Bruvo genetic
distance. The possible number of genotypes in highly polyploid species, such as coast redwood,
can be very high [40,72], hence, only few microsatellite primers can be sufficient for clonal
identification and population structure analysis.
The number of chloroplast haplotypes found in this study was exceptionally high (150) based
on six cpSSR markers genotyped in 579 samples in all data sets F, C and G combined. It
confirmed higher variation of cpSSR than nSSR markers usually observed in conifers [80],
although the mutation rate of chloroplast microsatellite loci is lower [81]. However, cluster
analysis did not reveal geographic differentiation other than two northern and southern groups

of populations. Similar results were observed in another conifer species, Abies nordmanniana,
which also had a similar high number of haplotypes, 111, genotyped in 361 individuals,
although the sampling range included a several times larger area than for coast redwood [82].
Meanwhile, it should be noted that haplotype differentiation usually reflected the geographic
origin of populations in other conifer species [83-85]. However, the differentiation between
populations based on the cpSSR markers is usually less than the one based on nSSRs, which
can be explained by the paternal inheritance of chloroplasts in S. sempervirens [32] and the long
distance gene flow via pollen. Ribeiro et al. [86] found similar results when compared
population differentiation based on AFLP markers with the one based on the paternally
inherited cpSSR markers in the wind pollinated conifer Pinus pinaster. In addition, Petit et al.
[87] showed that for various conifer species genetic differentiation based on bi-parentally
inherited markers correlated with differentiation based on paternally inherited markers due to
the similar gene flow vectors, but the latter one was in general lower [88].

Conclusions and future directions
Coast redwood forest used to have continuous distribution along the pacific coast in California
before intensive logging started at the beginning of the nineteenth century [89]. Therefore,
current coast redwood populations are considered as remnant and fragmented populations.
However, being long living clonal trees with high somatic mutation rate coast redwood
maintained its high genetic diversity despite multiple bottlenecks [8,32].
The combination of low sexual reproduction and local adaptation that could be insufficient
to meet the predicted future climate change will increase the pressure on coast redwood [8].
California has become drier in the last 2000 years [9], and the very important fog has been
declining in its frequency during the last century [36,90]. Considering these threats O’Hara et
al. [8] emphasized the necessity to find drought tolerant genotypes, especially for southern
populations. Genetic and physiological mechanisms behind drought resistance are similar to

those that are behind frost tolerance [91]. Geographic variation in drought tolerance in tree
species often overlaps with its variation in frost tolerance because the physiological
mechanisms of drought tolerance and frost tolerance are similar [92]. One of the mechanisms
of frost resistance is related to preventing crystal water formation via osmotic regulation of the
cells, which is also important in drought resistance [93]. The identification of water stress
resistant genotypes would benefit both Californian and German forestry. Tolerant genotypes
would not only provide Germany with a valuable timber species considering climate change,
but also presents suitable resources for ex-situ conservation programs for coast redwood, which
was already suggested for the sister species Sequoiadendron giganteum [2].
Further studies of the genetic structure of coast redwood populations and clones are needed
based on functional markers that are potentially under selection, such as non-synonymous SNPs
or SNPs in regulatory genes. The results obtained in these studies would provide important data
for sustainable timber production and improved conservation management, in situ and ex situ,
for coast redwood, especially in the context of predicted climate change.

inferred without (a) and with (b) the “locprior” function (K = 6 and K = 2 for C and K = 2 for
F, respectively). L(K) and ∆K statistics generated by the ClumPAK software are also
presented.

S8 Fig. STRUCTURE statistics for the reference data sets C and F based on 6 cpSSR
markers. Presented are the most likely number of clusters (K) and results of STRUCTURE
runs for K from 1 to 20 or 25 with 20 iterations each for the complete data set C (a), northern
subset C (b), southern subset C (c), complete data set F (d), northern subset F (e), and
southern subset F (f).
