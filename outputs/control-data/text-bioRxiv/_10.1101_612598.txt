ABSTRACT

25

Recent developments in understanding how the functional phenotype of the innate immune system

26

is programmed has led to paradigm-shifting views on immunomodulation. These advances have

27

overturned two long-held dogmas: only adaptive immunity confers immunological memory and

28

innate immunity lacks specificity. This work describes the novel observation that innate immune

29

effector cells can be recruited to specific tissues of the body where pathology is present by using

30

a microbial-based immune stimulus that consists of an inactivated pathogen that typically resides

31

or causes infection in that target tissue site. We demonstrate this principle using experimental

32

models of cancer and infection for which different subcutaneously delivered microbial-based

33

treatments were shown to induce the recruitment of immune effector cells to specific diseased

34

organs. Amelioration of disease in a given organ niche was dependent on matching the correct

35

microbial stimulus for the affected organ site but was independent of the nature of the pathology.

36

This observation intriguingly suggests that the immune system, upon pathogen recognition, tends

37

to direct its resources to the compartment in which the pathogen has previously been encountered

38

and would be the most likely source of infection. Importantly, this phenomenon provides a novel

39

means to therapeutically target innate immune effector cells to sites of specific disease localization

40

to potentially treat a wide spectrum of pathologies, including cancer, infection, and chronic

41

inflammatory disorders.

Vaccines that target adaptive immune memory have revolutionized medicine. This study

describes a novel strategy that works as a modified innate immune “vaccine” that exploits the

46

trained response of innate immune effector cells to clear pathology in a specific tissue site.

47

Unlike memory of the adaptive immune system, which functions like a lock and key, innate

48

immune memory is more akin to a reflex response – like experienced muscle or neural cells that

49

are changed by a stimulus to respond more efficiently upon re-exposure. This change in behavior

50

through experience is the definition of learning. Our study suggests that this innate immune

51

learning occurs at different levels. Emergency hematopoiesis trains new innate immune cells in

52

the bone marrow to respond quickly and effectively to a non-specific threat; whereas, pathogen-

53

specific training occurs at sites where cells making up the immunologic niche have had

54

interactions with a particular pathogen and have been trained to respond more robustly to it upon

55

re-presentation in the context of a danger signal. The speed with which new immune cells are

56

trained in the bone marrow in response to an imminent microbial threat and their subsequent

57

recruitment to the target organ site where that microbe typically resides suggests there are ways

58

the immune system communicates to coordinate this rapid response that are yet to be fully

59

delineated. These findings provide a novel highly proficient way to harness the potent effector

60

functions of the innate immune system to address a wide range of immune-based diseases.

INTRODUCTION

63

In 1899, cancer researcher D’Arcy Power noted: “Where malaria is common, cancer is rare.” [1]

64

For centuries, physicians have observed that acute infection can be associated with spontaneous

65

cancer regression, and it is now well appreciated that the potent immune response to the threat of

66

acute infection can overcome malignancy [2,3]. One of the best known early clinical applications

67

of this observation was developed in the 1890’s by Dr. William Coley who used an inactivated

68

bacterial cocktail, which came to be known as Coley’s Toxin, to treat various types of cancers and

69

achieved success rates similar to modern treatments in many cases [2]. At least 15 epidemiological

70

studies have examined the possible link between infectious disease and cancer, with all but one

71

supporting an association between infection and reduced incidence of neoplasms [2]. Yet, intra-

72

vesical administration of Bacillus Galmette-Guerin (BCG) for the treatment of high-risk non-

73

muscle invasive bladder cancer is the only microbe-based therapy that is currently part of the

74

approved standard of care [4]. The failure to realize the full potential of this immunotherapeutic

75

approach can be attributed to a number of factors, including lack of sufficient characterization of

76

the immunological mechanism(s) driving the therapeutic outcome and difficulties with obtaining

77

consistent results. However, recent pivotal developments in understanding the basis of what is now

78

coined trained innate immunity, which encompasses changes in the programming of the innate

79

immune response through experience, have far-reaching potential to improve our understanding

80

of the anti-cancer immunological response induced by acute infection [5,6]. This new deeper

81

appreciation of innate immune system adaptation and reprogramming is projected to meaningfully

82

advance the use of microbial-based treatments for not only cancer, but also for many of the

83

increasingly prevalent immune-based diseases we now contend with, including inflammatory

84

bowel disease, allergies and autoimmune disorders [5-7].

85

We recently characterized the key immune cellular and molecular pathways by which mimicking

86

an acute infection using a microbe-based stimulus markedly reduces the tumor burden in two

87

different lung cancer models [8]. The treatment used was formulated from an inactivated lung

88

pathogen, a derivative of a clinical isolate of Klebsiella, which is subcutaneously administered

89

every second day [8]. Efficacy in reducing lung tumor burden was shown to be 1) dependent on

90

the animals having had previous exposure to Klebsiella and 2) independent of adaptive immunity

91

[8]. In the work presented here, we describe a newly discovered phenomenon of organ-specific

92

trained innate immune cell recruitment and disease amelioration. We show organ specificity is

93

determined by the organ niche of the bacterial species from which the microbial stimulant is

94

derived. These findings suggest that there are levels of greater complexity of innate immune

95

training that are yet to be fully elucidated. By applying this immunological targeting

96

therapeutically, these findings provide a means to direct trained innate immune effector cells to

97

specific tissue sites of pathology.

RESULTS

100

Microbial-based immunotherapy agents demonstrate anti-cancer efficacy in an organ-

101

specific manner

102

A subcutaneously injected microbial-based immunotherapy made from an inactivated strain of

103

Klebsiella, called QBKPN, was previously tested in a Lewis Lung Carcinoma model [8]. It was

104

observed that mice without prior lung exposure to Klebsiella did not experience a reduction in

105

tumor burden with QBKPN treatment, whereas mice with prior exposure to Klebsiella did [8].

106

Here we show that when we administer a similarly formulated immunotherapy based on

107

Escherichia coli, called QBECO, there is little relative efficacy in reducing lung cancer burden in

108

the Lewis Lung Carcinoma model, despite all animals likely having exposure to E. coli (Fig. 1A).

109

We replicated the previous findings in a different lung cancer model using B16F10 melanoma cells

110

(Supplemental Fig. 1A), which suggests QBKPN’s anti-cancer efficacy is not cancer cell type

111

specific, rather it appears to be applicable to different cancer cell types growing in the lungs. We

112

hypothesized that QBECO may have a therapeutic anti-tumor effect in a compartment likely to be

113

exposed to E. coli. We first used an intraperitoneal cancer model since E. coli infection is the most

114

common cause of Gram-negative peritonitis [9]. MC-38 adenocarcinoma cells were administered

115

by intraperitoneal injection to establish the cancer [10]. In this model every second day

116

subcutaneous administration of QBECO significantly increased survival compared to vehicle

117

treatment; whereas, QBKPN treatment was less efficacious (Fig. 1B). QBECO treatment also

118

improved survival when pancreatic cancer cells were seeded intraperitoneally (Supplemental Fig.

119

1B). Thus, QBECO treatment improved survival in animals with cancer in the peritoneal region

120

independent of cancer cell type, corroborating the analogous observation with respect to QBKPN’s

121

anti-cancer efficacy in the lungs. Collectively, these findings suggest there are organ-specific

122

immune effects of these microbial treatments and that these subcutaneously administered products

123

are sampled by immune cells in the targeted organ niche. To exclude the possibility that the

124

efficacy of these microbial-based treatments was a result solely of reduced seeding of injected

125

cancer cells, we tested both QBKPN and QBECO in a chemically-induced colon cancer model in

126

which cancer develops with exposure to DSS/AOM over a 70 day period [11,12]. Because both

127

Klebsiella species and E. coli are enteric bacteria in mice, both QBKPN and QBECO treatment

128

succeeded in reducing tumor burden in the colon compared to vehicle-treated mice in this model

129

(Fig. 1C). A biodistribution study using in vivo imaging of fluorescently labelled QBKPN (Cy5.5-

130

QBKPN) confirmed that the product is systemically distributed (Supplemental Fig. 2A); peak

131

levels in blood were detected at 2 hours after administration and dropped subsequently

132

(Supplemental Fig. 2B).

133

Characterizing the lung-specific immune response induced by QBKPN compared to QBECO

134

in mice with lung cancer

135

Immuno-phenotyping was used to characterize the lung specific immune changes induced by

136

QBKPN compared to QBECO treatment using the murine B16F10 lung cancer model. QBKPN

137

administration increased the percentage of NK cells and interstitial macrophages in the lungs when

138

assessed at both days 5 and 17 after tumor inoculation (corresponding to 15 and 27 days of QBKPN

139

treatment, respectively). In contrast, QBECO treatment did not change the proportion of either NK

140

cells or interstitial macrophages in the lungs relative to vehicle treated control mice (Fig. 2A-B).

141

To account for the greater recruitment of NK cells and macrophages to the lungs by QBKPN vs.

142

QBECO treatment, lung chemokine concentrations were quantified. Relative to both vehicle

143

control and QBECO, treatment with QBKPN led to higher levels of chemokines important for the

144

recruitment and activation of NK cells and macrophages, including CCL2, CCL5, and IFNγ-

145

inducible chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, at both 5 and 17 days following tumor inoculation

146

(Fig. 2C). IFNγ gene expression was increased with QBKPN treatment compared to QBECO at

147

both timepoints measured (Fig. 2D); however, protein levels of IFNγ were measurably greater at

148

only the day 5 timepoint (Supplemental Fig. 3). QBKPN’s anti-lung cancer efficacy was

149

previously found to be dependent on the activation of the NKG2D pathway, which is fundamental

150

for the detection and elimination of transformed, damaged and infected cells by cytotoxic

151

lymphocytes [8]. QBKPN administration, but not QBECO administration, significantly

152

potentiated the expression of NKG2D ligand, Rae1, in the lungs (Fig. 3A). In parallel, QBKPN

153

treatment led to a more potent induction of molecules that mediate anti-tumor cytotoxicity

154

including, Granzyme A (GzmA), Granzyme B (GzmB) and Perforin 1 (Pfr1), in the lungs of mice

155

with cancer (Fig. 3B-E).

156

The lung-specific immune response elicited by QBKPN is enhanced by the presence of

157

pathology

158

The contribution of the presence of a lung pathology to the type and extent of the immune response

159

triggered by QBKPN vs. QBECO was investigated using cancer-free mice. Among the most

160

notable differences in the immune response in healthy animals was the proportion of NK cells

161

recruited to the lungs with QBKPN treatment, which was markedly attenuated in healthy mice

162

compared to lung cancer bearing mice (Fig. 4A vs. Fig. 2A). In contrast, the proportion of

163

interstitial macrophages increased in both healthy mice and mice with cancer (Fig. 4B, Fig. 2B).

164

Another difference in healthy vs. lung cancer bearing mice was the degree to which certain immune

165

responses were sustained. In particular, the expression of IFNγ and Rae1, which decreased or

166

remained the same over time in healthy mice (Fig. 4), increased over time in cancer-bearing mice

167

(Fig. 3). However, similar to cancer-bearing mice, there was greater lung immune stimulation with

168

QBKPN than with QBECO treatment, but this difference was generally less pronounced in healthy

169

mice. The exception to this observation was in the gene expression, but not protein levels, of

170

granzyme B, granzyme A, and perforin, which showed equal increases with 27 days of either

171

QBKPN or QBECO treatment in disease-free animals (Fig. 4G). Collectively, these findings

172

suggest that the presence of pathology dictates the extent, duration and type of lung-specific

173

immune response elicited by QBKPN vs. QBECO treatment.

174

Both microbial-based treatments, QBKPN and QBECO, stimulate an initial acute immune

175

response that results in emergency hematopoiesis

176

The nature of the initial systemic immune response elicited by QBKPN and QBECO following a

177

single subcutaneous injection was first assessed in healthy animals to exclude the impact of organ

178

pathology on their different organ-specific effects. The kinetics and magnitude of the systemic

179

acute-immune response were similar after administration of the two microbial-based products (Fig.

180

5A-C). Both treatments induced a rapid induction of systemic inflammatory cytokines that were

181

detectable in the serum within 5 hours and returned to baseline levels by 12 to 24 hours after

182

administration (Fig. 5A; Supplemental Fig.5). Similarly, both QBKPN and QBECO increased the

183

number of neutrophils and Ly6CHI monocytes in circulation within 5 hours. (Fig. 5B-C).

184

Changes in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations were investigated to assess how a single

185

injection of either QBKPN or QBECO affected hematopoiesis and the mobilization of new

186

immune cell recruitment. Twenty-four hours after treatment, both QBKPN and QBECO similarly

187

expanded the HSC progenitor population in the bone marrow, characterized as lineage negative c-

188

Kit+Sca+ (LSK+) (Fig. 5D-E). In particular, both microbial products increased the production of

189

short-term HSC (ST-HSC; characterized as LSK+CD150+CD48+) and multipotent progenitors

190

(MPPs; LSK+CD150-CD48+); Fig. 5G. Both myeloid (MPP3; LSK+CD150-CD48+CD34+Flt3-)

191

and lymphoid (MPP4; LSK+CD150-CD48+CD34+Flt3+) MPP lineages were similarly increased at

192

this time point with QBKPN and QBECO treatment.

193

In lung cancer bearing mice, QBKPN-mediated myelopoiesis induces recruitment of trained

194

innate immune cells to clear pathology

195

Microbial-based stimulation of myelopoiesis is considered to be an important component of

196

trained innate immunity required to deal with the threat of infection [13]. To determine whether

197

this process is also involved in mediating QBKPN’s ability to clear cancer in the lungs, the

198

modulation of myelopoiesis by QBKPN and QBECO was investigated in the context of cancer in

199

the lungs. Mice repeatedly treated with QBKPN, but not mice treated with QBECO, had sustained

200

increases in the number of HSC (LSK+ cells) compared to vehicle-treated control mice when the

201

bone marrow niche was assessed 18 days after B16F10 cancer cell administration seeded to the

202

lungs (Fig. 6A). This QBKPN-mediated increase in progenitors favoured MPPs and ST-HSCs

203

(Fig. 6B). Within the MPP population, repeated treatment with QBKPN in lung cancer-bearing

204

mice resulted in a shift towards MPP3 generation (Fig. 6C). In contrast, QBECO treatment had

205

little effect in modulating the HSC populations in lung-cancer bearing mice when assessed at this

206

later time point (Fig. 6A-C). Both QBKPN and QBECO treatment induced large increases in bone

207

marrow neutrophil numbers; however, only QBKPN was able to sustain an increased number of

208

bone marrow monocyte numbers (Fig. 6D). To test whether bone marrow monocytes in mice

209

treated with these microbial-based therapies were functionally different, we isolated bone marrow

210

monocytes from B16 lung tumor bearing mice treated with vehicle, QBKPN or QBECO and

211

stimulated them with LPS in vitro. Bone marrow monocytes from mice treated with QBKPN or

212

QBECO released significantly more IL-1β relative to those treated with vehicle. (Fig. 6E).

213

When we investigated systemic immune cell populations in the lung cancer model at Day 18, we

214

found QBKPN, but not QBECO, treatment resulted in an increase in Ly6CHICCR2+CD11b+

215

monocytes in circulation and lungs (Fig. 6F). These monocytes were characterized as being

216

positive for MHC class II and Sca-1 (Fig. 6G-H), markers associated with transcriptional

217

programming in the bone marrow by microbial stimulation [14]. Ly6CHI monocytes are recruited

218

to sites of infections through CCR2/CCL2 signalling [15,16]. The important contribution to anti-

219

lung cancer efficacy of QBKPN-mediated recruitment of these monocytes was demonstrated in

220

mice genetically deficient in CCR2, in which QBKPN treatment failed to recruit Ly6CHI

221

monocytes to the lungs and lost its anti-cancer efficacy (Fig. 6I-J).

222

Demonstration of the broader application of immune modulation by organ-specific

223

microbial-based therapies to treat immune-related diseases

224

The ability to target trained innate immune cells to specific organ sites of pathology by the strategic

225

selection of the correctly matched microbial-based therapy has potential to treat a broad range of

226

immune-related diseases. Adding to the evidence provided for this novel approach for cancer using

227

specific gram-negative pathogens targeting the lungs, peritoneal cavity and GI tract, we next tested

228

the ability to target the skin using a microbial-based treatment (QBSAU) made from a clinical

229

isolate of Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive organism that is a common source of skin

230

infection. Treatment with QBSAU, but not QBKPN or QBECO, was effective in reducing B16F10

231

melanoma subcutaneous tumor growth (Supplemental Fig. 6A). In contrast, QBSAU had little

232

relative efficacy in improving outcomes for animals with cancer in the lungs or peritoneal

233

compartment (Supplemental Fig. 6B-C).

234

To demonstrate the broader application of this immunotherapeutic approach, we tested the three

235

different microbial-based treatments, QBKPN, QBECO, and QBSAU, in three infection models

236

affecting the lungs, peritoneal cavity and skin. Pathogens different from those used to make the

237

microbial-based treatments were used for establishing organ-specific infections to avoid the

238

possibility that the treatments were functioning like classical vaccines through the induction of an

239

adaptive immune response to a specific pathogen. In the Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection

240

model, out of the three microbial-based treatments used, QBKPN performed the best in reducing

241

the bacterial burden in the lungs (Fig. 7A). In corollary, the intraperitoneal Salmonella enterica

242

infection model showed that QBECO treatment had the greatest efficacy in reducing the peritoneal

243

bacterial burden as assessed in the spleen (Fig. 7B). Lastly, in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin

244

infection model, QBSAU treatment was the most effective in reducing the skin bacterial burden

245

(Fig. 7C). The ability of these microbial-based therapies to ameliorate disease was independent of

246

the species of pathogen causing infection. QBKPN reduced bacterial burden in the context of both

247

S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa (Supplemental Fig. 7) infections.

248
249

DISCUSSION

250

Microbial exposure is a double-edged agent of health and disease. Infection was once the leading

251

cause of morbidity and mortality, but with significant improvements in hygiene and the advent of

252

population-based vaccination and antibiotics, the 20th Century saw a dramatic decrease in the

253

incidence of acute infection and infection mortality and a concomitant rise in allergies, chronic

254

immune-related disorders [17,18] and certain cancers [19] in developed countries. This

255

observation has become popularly known as the hygiene hypothesis, which postulates that a lack

256

of appropriate training of the immune system by microbial stimulation, particularly early in life,

257

is linked to the development of immune pathologies. This hypothesis has different variations, some

258

postulating that exposure to disease causing agents is less important than early life exposure to

259

“friendly” or symbiotic microbes [20]. The truth likely encompasses an integration of both

260

concepts. Evidence for the hygiene hypothesis has primarily come from epidemiological studies

261

(reviewed in [17,18,21,22]), but there is direct experimental evidence that immune education by

262

microbial stimulation early in life is important for setting the tone for immune regulation

263

throughout [23]. This has spurred an area of avid research focused on the use of microbes and

264

microbial components as potential new treatment modalities for the many serious immune-related

265

diseases growing in incidence and prevalence [5,24,25]. In this work, we describe what we believe

266

to be a seemingly unknown phenomenon of the existence of immunological memory contained

267

within specific regional niches for microbes that normally inhabit or infect it. We were able to

268

successfully target pathology in the lungs, peritoneal cavity, GI tract and skin via repeated

269

subcutaneous administration of microbial-based immunotherapies made from inactivated bacterial

270

species that are endogenous in each of the respective target organs. The efficacy of a Klebsiella-

271

based treatment to clear lung cancer was previously found to be dependent on animals having prior

272

lung exposure to Klebsiella and independent of adaptive immunity [8]. Our studies show that the

273

choice of microbe used to formulate the immunotherapy is critically important to appropriately

274

direct innate immune effector cells to the site of pathology. The lack of consistency and high

275

variability in outcomes with microbial-based treatments to date may partly be due to a mismatch

276

between the microbial species from which the treatment is derived and the past microbial exposure

277

or “training” of the patient’s immune system in the targeted organ. Fig. 8 summarizes the sequence

278

of events we have determined leads to the clearance of pathology in a targeted organ by

systemically administering a microbial-based stimulus derived from a pathogen that is a common

280

cause of infection in that organ niche.

281

Two long-held dogmas have recently been brought into question with paradigm-shifting advances

282

in our understanding of innate immunity: 1) immunological memory is the domain of the adaptive

283

arm of the immune system, and 2) innate immunity lacks specific memory [5,6,26,27]. The

284

treatment strategy we employed is rooted in both the trainability of the innate immune system and

285

its more nuanced organ specificity, which is intrinsically different from that of the adaptive

286

immune system [26]. We demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of our microbial-based

287

treatments resulted in myelopoiesis-associated training of monocytes in the bone marrow within

288

24 hours. Intraperitoneal administration of a prototypical agonist for innate immune training, β-

289

glucan, was first shown to act on HSC to expand myeloid cell progenitors, and this effect on HSC

290

improved the physiological response to subsequent challenge with LPS and also protected mice

291

from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression [13]. This work by Mitroulis and colleagues

292

established that microbial modulation of myelopoiesis is a fundamental component of trained

293

immunity [13]. Kaufmann and colleagues had come to a similar conclusion in parallel using BCG

294

in a series of elegant experiments that demonstrated BCG administration induced myelopoiesis at

295

the expense of lymphopoiesis and the production of epigenetically modified macrophages that

296

were better able to deal with virulent M. tuberculosis [28].

297

demonstrate the longer-term benefits of innate immune conditioning, enabling it to deal more

298

effectively with challenges it will face in the future. We have shown that this innate immune

299

training in the bone marrow can be therapeutically harnessed to deal with a broad spectrum of

300

imminent or present immunological threats by targeting the recruitment of these cells to a specific

301

organ.

302

Askenase and colleagues discovered that the priming of monocytes in the bone marrow in response

303

to infection was mediated by the production of IFNγ by NK cells, and this proactive developmental

304

education promoted their effector functions in the infected tissues [14]. Microbial-induced innate

305

immune conditioning in the bone marrow is governed by secreted inflammatory signals, including

306

IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12 and IFNγ, and largely lacks specificity [13,14]. As we demonstrated,

307

primed monocytes, once recruited to the tissues, can potently respond to a range of dangers. This

308

is consistent with studies demonstrating that BCG vaccination offers non-specific protection

309

against non-mycobacterial infections that is independent of adaptive immune function [29]. In our

310

study, we demonstrated that the signal for targeting immune cells newly released from the bone

311

marrow came from the organ where direct interaction with the microbial species occurs. This

312

organ-specific recognition of the microbial-based treatments was pivotal for the local production

313

of chemokines necessary to its recruitment of trained innate immune effector cells. This is in line

However, their intent was to

314

with the findings of Olszak et al. who demonstrated that early life microbial exposure modulated

315

the recruitment of invariant NKT cells to mucosal sites later in life [23], however, the mechanism

316

by which this microbial regulation is instituted was not defined.

317

It makes intuitive sense that there exists a means by which the innate immune system directs its

318

resources to the most likely source of infection upon detecting microbial components that are

319

presented as an acute threat. We propose this organ-specific microbial recognition reflects a more

320

sophisticated level of immunological education than the non-specific training that initially occurs

321

in the bone marrow. It is reminiscent of a similar phenomenon observed in invertebrates, which

322

lack adaptive immunity, yet show a stronger immune response to bacterial strains previously

323

encountered compared to strains to which they are naïve [26]. It was previously demonstrated that

324

a Klebsiella-based immunotherapy was effective in reducing lung cancer burden in Rag2 deficient

325

mice that are largely devoid of classical adaptive immune function [8]. The contribution of

326

adaptive immunity to the observed microbial mediated organ-specificity cannot be ruled out;

327

however, we believe it is unlikely the primary driver of this organ specific memory. Cells not

328

conventionally considered to be part of the immune system, such as epithelial and endothelial cells

329

that function as the interface between the host and its microbiota, are also capable of forming long-

330

term memories. Acute inflammation was elegantly shown to functionally change epithelial stem

331

cells to respond to such subsequent assaults with improved barrier restoration [30]. On the other

332

hand, barrier dysfunction can also develop through reprogramming of epithelial cells in response

333

to allergic inflammation [31]. This epithelial inflammatory memory, similar to innate immune

334

training [5], is mediated at the level of epigenetic programming [30]. In our study, the presence

335

of pathology in the targeted tissue further potentiated this organ specific immune response to the

336

microbial stimulus, and the nature of the pathology dictated the effector functions executed by the

337

recruited primed innate immune cells.

338

The therapeutic potential of trained innate immunity has yet to be fully realized. Recent advances

339

in understanding the basis of innate immune programming has re-ignited research into the

340

application of microbial modulation of immune function for the prevention and treatment of

341

disease. The discovery of tissue-specific microbial memory that can be therapeutically exploited

342

to direct trained innate immune effector cells to sites of pathology has the potential to change the

343

way diseases rooted in immune dysfunction are treated. In addition to treating various cancers and

344

infections, proof-of-principle experiments conducted to date show promise for this approach for

345

the treatment of asthma [32], COPD [33], and inflammatory bowel disease [34]. The clinical

346

application of this immunotherapeutic strategy has been promising thus far, based on Phase 1 and

347

2 studies in non-small cell lung cancer [8], ulcerative colitis [35], and Crohn’s disease [36]. Further

348

research is now needed to fully elucidate the detailed immunological mechanisms of the organ

349

specific innate immune response to microbial threat and its therapeutic application.

starting 10 days before tumor cell inoculation (day 0) and every second day throughout the

384

experiment except for the day of tumor inoculation, as previously described [8]. For experiments

385

performed using the DSS/AOM cancer model and naïve mice, the microbial-based treatments were

386

given every second day throughout the experiment. For the infection models, treatment started 14

387

days before bacterial challenge (day 0) and was given every second day throughout the experiment,

388

except for the day of bacterial challenge.

402

For the intraperitoneal cancer survival studies, MC-38 cells or Panc02 cells were injected

403

intraperitoneally at 2 x 105 cells in 100 µL PBS. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when

404

they reached humane endpoint criteria (i.e., appearance, posture/gait, abdominal distension,

405

behavioural and facial signs of pain).

406

For the skin cancer study, B16-F10 cells were injected subcutaneously at 1 x 105 cells in 100 µL

407

PBS. Tumor length, width, and height were measured by digital calipers and the tumor burden was

408

calculated using these measurements every second day.

DSS/AOM model

410

Mice were injected intraperitoneally on day 0 with azoxymethane (AOM; Sigma, Kawasaki,

411

Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan), at 8 mg/kg body weight, 10 days after treatment started. After AOM

412

injections, mice received 3 cycles of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana,

413

CA, USA) treatment spaced 3 weeks apart. In each cycle, DSS was administered in the drinking

414

water ad libitum for 5 days at a final concentration of 2.5% weight/volume. Mice were euthanized

415

at the experimental endpoint 70 days after AOM injection.

Figure 8: Summary of the mechanism leading to organ-specific immune activation by
systemically delivered microbial stimulus. A subcutaneously delivered microbial stimulus elicits
a systemic immune response that leads to myelopoeisis and training of new immune cells in the
bone marrow to deal with an acute threat. Recognition of the microbial components in the context
of an immunological threat in the target organ in which it is a part of the microbiome as well as a
common source of infection induces the local production of chemokines that recruit the newly
trained immune cells. The end result is an efficient immune response to the pathology present in
that tissue.

Supplemental Figure 3: Cytokine changes in the lung tissue in cancer bearing mice at day 5
and day 17. Cytokines were measured in lung homogenates in the B16F10 lung cancer model at
5 and 17 days post tumor inoculation. Cytokines were measured by 31-cytoplex. GM-CSF (day
5), IL-1α, IL-1β, Il-4, IL-9, IL-12p40, IL-17, CXCL1, M-CSF, MIP1α, MIP1β (day 5) and TNFα
were detected but no significant changes were measured. GM-CSF (day 17), Il-3, IL-5, IL12p70
and MIP-1β (day 17) were measured but were not detectable. Data represents mean ± SD. n=8-10
mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA,

Supplemental Figure 4: Cytokine changes in the lung tissue in cancer free mice after 27 days
of treatment. Cytokines were measured in lung homogenates in cancer free mice at 27 days after
start of vehicle, QBKPN or QBECO treatment. Cytokines were measured by 31-cytoplex. GMCSF (day 5), IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-9, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, MIP1α, MIP1β and VEGF were detected
but no significant changes were identified. Il-3, IL-5 and IL12p70 and MIP-1β measurement were
not detectable. Data represents mean ± SD. n=8-10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p
< 0.001; **** p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc test.

Supplemental Figure 5: Cytokine changes in the serum after a single infection of vehicle,
QBKPN and QBECO. Cytokines were measured in serum in cancer naïve mice 5, 12 and 24
hours after a single subcutaneous injection of vehicle, QBKPN or QBECO. Cytokines were
measured by 31-cytoplex. Eotaxin-1, IL-2, Il-1α, IL-7, IL-9, and VEGF were detected but no
significant changes were identified. IFNγ, IL-3, IL-4, and LIF measurement were not detectable.
Data represents mean ± SD. n=8-10 mice per group. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; ****
p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s post-hoc test. Data from 5 hours in vehicle and
QBKPN treated mice has been previously published[8].
