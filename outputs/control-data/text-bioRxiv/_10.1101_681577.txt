Abstract
EGFR-mutated non-small cells lung carcinoma are treated with Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitors (TKI). Very often, the disease is only responding for a while before relapsing.
TKI efficacy in the long run is therefore challenging to evaluate. Our objective is to
derive a new imaging biomarker that could offer better insights on the disease response
to treatment. This study includes 17 patients diagnosed as EGFR-mutated non-small
cell lung cancer and exposed to an EGFR-targeting TKI. The early response to
treatment is evaluated with 3 computed tomography (CT) scans of the primitive tumor
(one before the TKI introduction and two after). Using our knowledge of the disease, an
imaging biomarker based on the tumor heterogeneity evolution between the first and
the third exams is defined and computed using a novel mathematical model calibrated
on patient data. Defining the overall survival as the time between the introduction of
the TKI treatment and the patient death, we obtain a statistically significant
correlation between the overall survival and our imaging marker (p = 0.009). Using the
ROC curve, the patients are separated into two populations hence the comparison of the
survival curves is statistically significant (p = 0.025). Initial state of the tumor seems to
have a role for the prognosis of the response to TKI treatment. More precisely, the
imaging marker - defined using only the CT scan before the TKI introduction - allows
us to determine a first classification of the population which is refined over time using
the imaging marker as more CT scans become available. This exploratory study leads
us to think that it is possible to obtain a survival assessment using only few CT scans of
the primary tumor.

Introduction

1

Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI) were shown to be effective in the treatment of
EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [1]. They are currently used as
first-line treatment for patients of stage IV. The EGFR gene corresponds to the
Epidermal Growth Factor receptor, which belongs to the family of receptors with
tyrosine kinase activity. The alteration of the EGFR gene in lung cancer occurs in 5 to
30% of cases, depending on the patient origin ( 10% of Caucasian patients, 40% of
non-smoking Caucasian patients and up to 60% of non-smoking Asian patients), see [2].
TKI treatment may be successful for a time but their efficacy in the long run is

challenging to evaluate. For example, in [3], the authors estimate the relapse median
time at 10 months.
Latest advances in oncology and the discovery of many different sub-types of cancer,
partly because of genomic alterations, open the way to a personalized medicine [4].
There is a need of new tools combining different types of available data to help to
choose the best treatment for each patient. Medical imaging has an important role to
play in this context as these patients are routinely monitored using CT scans. The most
current used CT scan evaluation - in particular for lung cancers - is the RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) which consists in measuring the largest
diameters of target lesions [5, 6]. Most recent studies have shown the interest of the
tumor volume evaluation which is more precise and has a better reproducibility in
particular concerning the evaluation of non-small cell lung cancers [7–9]. Concerning
EGFR-mutated non-small cells lung carcinoma, previous works have studied the
correlations between the initial reduction of the primary tumor and the overall survival.
One can find contradictory results in the literature: in [10, 11], a significant correlation
has been established but more recently in [12] this correlation has not be validated
using another database. Many recent studies propose to use radiomic approaches which
consist in extracting a large number of quantitative features from medical images using
data-characterization algorithms. In non-small cell lung cancers, various tumor
heterogeneity markers may be computed, see [13] for a proposal for harmonization of
methodology. Then, they can be related for example to the distant metastasis
probability [14] ; to predict pathological response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation [15]
; to indicate tumor response to radiation therapy [16] ; to advance clinical
decision-making by analyzing standard-of-care medical images [17] and to establish
independent marker of survival time [18]. In [19], the authors even show that radiomics
may help identify a general prognostic phenotype existing in both lung and
head-and-neck cancer. These approaches have also been used for EGFR-mutated
non-small cell lung cancer. For example, radiomic approaches may predict EGFR
mutation status without requiring repeated biopsy acquisitions [20, 21] but also identify
tumor heterogeneity markers which can be related to early EGFR TKI failure [22].
In this study, instead of testing classical heterogeneity markers, we introduce a novel
imaging biomarker that quantifies the evolution of the heterogeneity of the primitive
tumor of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cells lung cancers over time. This
criterion is defined using our knowledge of the disease and can be biologically
interpreted. The objective of this work is to study the value of this novel marker to
predict overall survival in order to help clinicians to detect EGFR TKI treatment failure
earlier.

Patients

A monocentric retrospective cohort study has been conducted on patients with a
biopsy-proven non-small-cell lung carcinoma - presenting an identified or suspected
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation, (established by a TKI clinical
benefit of more than 6 months) - which are non-accessible to local treatment (stage IIIB
or IV). Patients were included in the study if 3 CT-scans were available: one before the
first introduction of TKI treatment and two after. The study was approved by Institut
Bergonié and IRB approval was obtained for use of the CT images. Informed consents
of data collection were waived for research from each patient, in accordance with the
related policy of Institut Bergonié.

Treatment

All patients were exposed to an EGFR-targeting TKI. Two molecules were used:
gefitinib (IRESSA®, Astra-Zeneca) and erlotinib (TARCEVA®, Roche). These two
therapies were given until progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal to continue
treatment or death.

corresponding respectively to the initial slope of volume decreasing (between t0 and t1 ),
to the slope of volume decreasing (between t0 and t2 ), to the initial percentage of
volume decreasing (between t0 and t1 ) and to the percentage of volume decreasing
(between t0 and t2 ).
On CT, high intensities (lighter colors on the image) correspond to high tissue
densities and therefore to high cellularity and proliferation while intensities around 0
correspond to water and necrosis. We therefore split the set of voxels of the images into
two classes. The first class contains the voxels whose values are non-negative while the
second class is formed by non-positive intensities voxels. We will refer to the first class
(with positive intensities) as being the proliferative one while the second one will be
referred as the necrotic one. We denote by P (t) the volume of the set of voxels whose
intensities are positive within the tumor on the exam at time t. We then compute the
ratio of this proliferative-like compartment with respect to the total volume
%P (t) = VP (t)
(t) . We define the following set of biomarkers (based on the heterogeneity):

corresponding respectively to the area under the curve (AUC) of the quantity %P (t)
between t0 and t2 , to the AUC of the quantity %P (t) between t1 and t2 , and to the
initial value of the quantity %P (t).
Using the first 3 CT-scans, we extract V (t0 ), V (t1 ), V (t2 ), P (t0 ), P (t1 ) and P (t2 )
Rt
and approximate the imaging marker t02 %P (t)dt with the trapezoidal rule. However,
this strategy has limitations. Indeed, the acquisition times t0 , t1 and t2 and the CT
image noise may introduce some instability in the computation, for example if t1 is too
close to t0 or t2 .
We therefore choose another strategy that consists in using a mechanistic model in
order to fit the values P (t0 ), P (t1 ) and P (t2 ) continuously on the time interval [t0 , t2 ].
This model relies on the evolutions of two populations of cells (proliferative cells and
quiescent or necrotic compartment). This model is parametrized using the values
V (t0 ), V (t1 ), V (t2 ), P (t0 ), P (t1 ) and P (t2 ) defined above. It then provides an evaluation
of P (t) and V (t) at any time between t0 and t2 , see Fig. 1. The model and its

Evaluation scans were done every 2 to 6 months. The acquisition was performed after
an injection of iodized contrast agent at portal phase on the thorax, the abdomen and
the pelvis and then at late-arterial phase on the encephalon. We consider 3 CT-scans
(given at times t0 , t1 and t2 ). The first one is acquired immediately before TKI
treatment and the second and the third ones are the 2 first ones after the first
introduction of TKI treatment. Time t0 is the baseline. Tumors were delineated using a
semi-automatic segmentation library that relies on a deformable model [23]. All the
delineations were validated by a junior and a senior radiologists.
Using these images, we derive various biomarkers. Defining by V (t) the volume of
the tumor at time t, we define the following set of biomarkers (computed from the
volume):

Statistics

Whenever appropriate, standard statistics are presented as mean±standard-deviation
and number (percentage). We define the overall survival (OS) as the time between the
introduction of the TKI treatment and the patient death. Survival curves were
computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared using Log-Rank tests. The
association of survival failure with each investigated biomarker was tested using Cox
regression. Prediction performances of the biomarkers were assessed using ROC curves.
The appropriate statistical tests were performed when required with a significance
threshold set to p = 0.05. The mechanistic model was fitted using the Monte Carlo
method. All computations were performed using Matlab-R2015a.

A population of 25 patients has been collected at Institut Bergonié (Bordeaux, France)
between 2006 and 2013. We have kept 17 patients among these 25 patients. We have
excluded 2 cases for which the CT-scan before the TKI introduction was not available
and 6 cases for which it was not possible to delineate the tumor (miliary disease,
patients without any discernable lesion e.g. with pleural effusion or atelectasis). Table 1

linear regression. The correlation between the overall survival and the imaging marker
is statistically significant (p = 0.009, r =-0.6). The population may clearly be divided
into two populations. In particular, patients with a short survival time have a large
value of the biomarker. In order to find the best threshold to classify the patients, we
need to set a survival threshold. Based on the survival histogram of the 17 patients
given in Fig. 3 and for clinical relevance, we set the survival threshold at 30 months.

Discussion

163

In this work we have studied the ability of volume-based and heterogeneity-based
imaging biomarkers to predict the survival in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients treated
with TKI.
Our first result is that there is no correlation between volume-based imaging
biomarkers and survival. This finding is consistent with the work [12] who noticed a
lack of association between tumor shrinkage and long-term survival. This illustrates
why the response to TKI treatment is difficult to estimate using only the evolution of
tumor volume (or RECIST).
Our second result is that heterogeneity-based imaging biomarkers may
R t help predict
short-term survival. More precisely, we propose an imaging biomarker t02 %P (t)dt that
is able to discriminate patients with short-time survival using only 3 successive
CT-scans (an imaging monitoring performed as standard of care for such patients). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which a mechanistic model based on

disease knowledge has been used to predict the outcome in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
patients treated with TKI. This shows that characterizing the content of the tumor and
its dynamics using mathematical models might provide valuable information to guide
clinical decisions.
The main strength of this work lies in the fact that the imaging marker is based on a
mathematical description of the alleged underlying pathophysiological processes rather
than purely empirical observations. As a consequence, the value of the biomarker may
be given a phenomenological meaning, an interpretation that would be lacking
otherwise. A large value of the biomarker means that the proportion of proliferative
cells does not decrease over time (even if the volume of the lesion is decreasing). In the
opposite case, a small value of the marker implies a decrease of the proportion of the
proliferative compartment, even if the response is modest in terms of whole tumor size.
We show that the use of the first image (CT-scan acquired before TKI introduction)
is of paramount importance for biomarker to predict the survival. More precisely, the
imaging biomarker computed using only this first image provides a first classification of
the patient that can be incrementally improved using the imaging marker as more
follow-up CT-scans become available.
In addition to biomarkers, the mathematical model (see Supplementary Materials)
offers more information on the mechanism of the response to treatment. The evolutions
of the proliferative and necrotic compartments given for each patient might also be
useful to personalize therapy, see Figure 8. In particular, it would be interesting to
study the ability of this mathematical model to detect acquired resistances to TKI
earlier, especially T790M mutation, a feature associated with bad prognostic [24].
An important limitation of this work is the small sample size and its retrospective
nature. A second limitation concerns the assumptions of the mechanistic model: tumor
heterogeneity as measured using CT-scan is assumed to be related to the proportion of
proliferative and necrotic cells. Confirming this hypothesis would require a histological
assessment of the whole tumor, which is possible only in patients who undergo surgery.

We have shown that the initial volume (or RECIST) evolution under TKI is not
sufficient to predict the survival while the tumor heterogeneity before the TKI
introduction is a major prognosis factor and provides a first classification of patients.
Furthermore, this first classification can be incrementally improved using the imaging
marker that summarizes the early evolution of the tumor heterogeneity as soon as more
CT scans are available. Short term perspectives of this work are about increasing the
size of the cohort and improving the segmentation process in order to be able to include
patients with non-delineated tumors.

We denote by P (resp. by N ) the volume of proliferative (resp. quiescent or
necrotic) cells. We have P + N = V where V corresponds to the volume of the lesion.
The evolution of the volume of proliferative cells is supposed to satisfy the following
equation:
P 0 = (J0 − K)P,
where the quantity J0 is the growth rate and we assume it constant in order to keep a
model with identifiable parameters. The quantity K corresponds to the decreasing rate
due to the TKI treatment. We assume that it follows a Gompertz-like law:

312
313
314
315

316
317
318

K = K0 e−δt ,
where δ is an unknown parameter and K0 the initial decreasing rate of P . We assume
that when exposed to the treatment, the proliferative cells die and form the necrotic
compartment. The evolution of the density N of this necrotic compartment is supposed
to satisfy the following equation:

319
320
321
322

N 0 = KP − LN.
The quantity L is the evacuation rate of the necrotic compartment. We assume that it
follows a Gompertz-like law:
L = L0 e−ηt ,
where η is an unknown parameter and L0 the initial evacuation rate of N .
This leads to the following ordinary differential system

P = (J0 − K)P,

and the quantity N can be numerically approximated. Figure 7 illustrates this model in
the formalism of compartment models.
Remark 1 Please note that this model may be derived from a spatial PDE model as
follows. Let P̂ (resp. N̂ ) be the spatial density of proliferative (resp. necrotic or
quiescent) cells and ~v , the velocity field that describes the evolution of the tumor over

Model parametrization

333

The model has 5 parameters: K0 , δ, J0 , L0 and η that we want to estimate using (the
subscript d is used to design the data):

334
335

• the volumes Vd (t1 ) and Vd (t2 ) (Vd (t0 ) is used for the initial condition),

336

• the proliferative parts Pd (t1 ) and Pd (t2 ) (Pd (t0 ) is used for the initial condition).

337

The parametrization is done into two steps. We start by estimating K0 , J0 and δ by
minimizing
sX
|Pd (ti ) − P (ti )|2 .

338
339

i=1,2

Two cases are possible:

340

• Case Pd (t0 ) > Pd (t1 ) > Pd (t2 ): we assume that the density of proliferative cells is
decreasing and we search the parameters as

341
342

K0 ∈]0, 0.1], N0 ∈]0, K0 [ and δ ∈] − t2 ln(N0 /K0 ), t2 ln(N0 /K0 )[.
• Case Pd (t0 ) > Pd (t1 ) and Pd (t1 ) < Pd (t2 ): we search the parameters as:

343

K0 ∈]0, 0.1], N0 ∈]0, K0 [ and δ ∈] − 0.1, 0.1[.
The set of parameters is not unique. However, if we consider two sets of parameters
which give small errors (∼ 10−3 ), the variations of P are very close. The second step
consists in estimating L0 and η by minimizing
sX
|Vd (ti ) − V (ti )|2 .

344
345
346

i=1,2

As we consider that the TKI treatment is still acting (for all the patients, we have
Vd (t0 ) > Vd (t1 ) > Vd (t2 )), the sets of parameters for which V is not strictly decreasing
are rejected.
