ABSTRACT

50

and rearrangement of cell-cell junctions to form a functional lumen. One important regulator of

51

cell polarity is the centrosome, which acts as a microtubule organizing center. Excess

52

centrosomes perturb aspects of endothelial cell polarity linked to migration, but whether

53

centrosome number influences apical-basal polarity and cell-cell junctions is unknown. Here,

54

we show that excess centrosomes alter the apical-basal polarity of endothelial cells in

55

angiogenic sprouts and disrupt endothelial cell-cell adherens junctions. Endothelial cells with

56

excess centrosomes had narrower lumens in a 3D sprouting angiogenesis model, and

57

zebrafish intersegmental vessels had reduced perfusion following centrosome overduplication.

58

These results indicate that endothelial cell centrosome number regulates proper lumenization

59

downstream of effects on apical-basal polarity and cell-cell junctions. Endothelial cells with

60

excess centrosomes are prevalent in tumor vessels, suggesting how centrosomes contribute

61

to the dysfunction of tumor vasculature.

Proper blood vessel formation requires coordinated changes in endothelial cell polarity

INTRODUCTION

67

Angiogenesis is the sprouting of new blood vessels from pre-existing

68

vasculature, and it is crucial during development, pregnancy, wound healing, and

69

tumorigenesis [1–3]. Endothelial cells (EC) form new sprouts that then extend,

70

lumenize, and connect with other sprouts and vessels to provide new conduits for blood

71

flow and create a functional vascular network. This process requires dynamic

72

rearrangement of endothelial cell-cell junctions and establishment of apical-basal

73

polarity, such that the apical surface of EC faces the vessel lumen and the basal

74

surface faces the tissue [4–8]. Lumen formation closely follows sprout formation and

75

extension temporally, and many sprout tips have two or more EC that are polarized in

76

the apical-basal axis [9]. However, it is not known how centrosome number contributes

77

to this process.

78
79

As tumors grow, hypoxia leads to elevated levels of pro-angiogenic factors such

80

as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) that promote neo-angiogenesis to

81

vascularize the tumor. However, the blood vessels surrounding these tumors are often

82

leaky, tortuous, and not properly lumenized [10–12], suggesting defects in EC junctions

83

and polarity. Interestingly, tumor vessels are also characterized by EC with excess

84

centrosomes [13,14]. High VEGF-A signaling in EC results in centrosome

85

overduplication, which affects interphase cells by increasing invasiveness, elevating

86

microtubule (MT) nucleations, changing aspects of polarity and migration, and altering

87

signaling dynamics [13,15–17]. However, it is unclear how excess centrosomes impact

88

cell-cell interactions and lumenogenesis, which require proper cytoskeletal dynamics

89

[18,19].

90
91

Cadherins form cell-cell adherens junctions that link to the actin cytoskeleton and

92

restrict the apical vs. basolateral domains in epithelial cells [20,21]. In EC, VE-cadherin

93

is the primary component of the vascular adherens junction and is required for

94

localization of apical markers during lumen formation in zebrafish intersegmental

95

vessels (ISVs) [7]. Depletion of VE-cadherin is embryonically lethal in zebrafish and

96

mice due to severe vascular defects, including a lack of vascular lumens [22,23]. The

97

centrosome acts as a major microtubule organizing center and determinant of cell

98

polarity [24,25]. As EC sprout and lumenize, they are not columnar, but flattened in the

99

apical-basal plane. Although more filamentous actin appears on the apical side of EC

100

[26–28], the topology of the centrosome is not well-defined, and the effects of

101

centrosome perturbation on apical-basal polarity have not been investigated.

102
103

Here, we show for the first time that excess centrosomes prevent the proper

104

polarization of interacting EC. Excess centrosomes resulted in EC with destabilized

105

adherens junctions and narrow and closed vascular lumens both in vitro and in vivo.

106

These findings reveal a novel role for the centrosome in EC apical-basal polarity, and in

107

junction and lumen formation, and suggest how excess centrosomes in the vasculature

108

may contribute to poor perfusion in tumor vessels.

RESULTS

110

Excess centrosomes perturb polarization of junctionally linked EC

111

We previously showed that excess centrosomes interfere with repolarization

112

along the forward-rearward axis in sprouting EC [15], and thus we hypothesized that

113

supernumerary centrosomes disrupt multiple EC polarity axes. We examined the

114

polarity between EC sharing junctions using an inducible system to overexpress polo-

115

like kinase 4 (Plk4) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Fig. 1a). Plk4

116

regulates centriole duplication, and its overexpression downstream of a TRE (tet-

117

responsive element) upon addition of doxycycline (DOX) results in supernumerary

118

centrosomes [13,15,29,30]. HUVEC were seeded onto H-shaped micropatterns that

119

allow for polarity assessment between two EC that form a cell-cell junction. Polarity was

120

defined based on centrosome position relative to the nucleus and cell-cell junction, with

121

a “proximal” position being near the cell-cell junction, a “central” position in the nuclear

122

region, and a “distal” position between the nucleus and the cell periphery (Fig. 1b). EC

123

with a normal centrosome number (1-2) typically had a distal centrosome polarity (Fig.

124

1c-d). In contrast, EC with excess centrosomes (>2) showed a significant increase in

125

centrosome proximal polarity, indicating that centrosome number affects EC polarization

126

relative to cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1c-d). Interestingly, when two EC with normal

127

centrosome number (N:N) formed a junction, both cells usually had centrosomes in the

128

distal position, which we termed “normal” polarity (Fig. 1e). All other polarity

129

combinations were deemed abnormal. When both EC forming a junction had excess

130

centrosomes (O:O), polarity was randomized between normal and abnormal (Fig. 1e).

131

Furthermore, N:N EC combinations were more likely to have cells with matching

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863787; this version posted December 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

132

polarity, while EC with an O:O combination were less likely to have the same polarity as

133

their neighbor (Fig. 1f). Taken together, these data indicate that excess centrosomes

134

prevent proper polarization of EC relative to cell-cell junctions.

135
136
137

EC with excess centrosomes form disorganized adherens junctions
Because interacting EC with excess centrosomes had perturbed polarity in the

138

junction axis, we asked whether EC cell-cell interactions were influenced by centrosome

139

number. Adherens junctions are required for proper apical-basal polarity in epithelial

140

cells [7,31], and the distribution of VE-cadherin at EC adherens junctions is indicative of

141

junction maturity; a linear VE-cadherin pattern is associated with mature stabilized

142

junctions, while a serrated and punctate VE-cadherin pattern is associated with

143

activated and/or disrupted junctions [32]. To determine how excess centrosomes

144

influence adherens junctions, we seeded induced tet-Plk4 HUVEC onto H-shaped

145

micropatterns. Due to the heterogeneous nature of Plk4-induced centrosome over-

146

duplication a given cell-cell junction could have contributions from two EC with a normal

147

number of centrosomes (N:N), two EC with excess centrosomes (O:O), or one of each

148

(N:O) (Fig. 2a-a”). We found that junctions with contributions from EC with normal

149

centrosome numbers had more linear and stable junctions, while junctions with

150

contributions from EC with excess centrosomes formed more chaotic and disrupted

151

junctions (Fig. 2b-b”, c-c”). These chaotic junctions had an increase in the total area of

152

VE-cadherin (Fig. 2d), and line scans across the junctions revealed a more dispersed

153

VE-cadherin distribution when one or both EC had excess centrosomes (Fig. 2e).

154

Overall, these findings indicate that EC with excess centrosomes do not maintain proper

155

endothelial cell-cell adherens junctions.

156
157
158

EC with excess centrosomes have abnormal lumens
We hypothesized that the disrupted polarity seen between EC with

159

supernumerary centrosomes had physiological consequences. To examine apical-

160

basal polarity in EC, we used a 3D sprouting angiogenesis assay in which lumenized

161

sprouts form that appropriately polarize in the apical-basal axis [9,33]. We analyzed

162

sprouts formed from DOX-treated tet-Plk4 HUVEC expressing centrin::eGFP and

163

stained for Moesin1 as an apical marker (Fig. 3a-b) and found that EC with normal

164

centrosome numbers (1-2) typically had apically positioned centrosomes, while EC with

165

excess centrosomes (>2) had randomized centrosome polarity in the apical-basal axis

166

(Fig. 3b-c). In addition, EC with excess centrosomes were more likely to have punctate

167

Moesin1, basal Moesin1, or unpolarized abnormal Moesin1 staining patterns compared

168

to normal linear and apical patterns (Fig. 3b, d), indicative of polarity defects.

169
170

Since both apical-basal polarity and proper junction formation are important for

171

lumen formation [4–8], we hypothesized that excess centrosomes in EC perturb vessel

172

lumenogenesis. To normalize for overall vessel structure, we measured the width of the

173

vessel lumen relative to the total vessel width. We found that EC with excess

174

centrosomes had narrower lumens compared to EC with normal centrosome numbers

175

in 3D sprouts (Fig 3b, e). Interestingly, there were several examples where lumens

176

were completely closed around EC with supernumerary centrosomes. These findings

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863787; this version posted December 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

177

indicate that EC centrosome number regulates proper vessel lumen diameter, likely

178

through effects on apical-basal polarity.

179
180
181

Overexpression of Plk4 in zebrafish results in fewer lumenized vessels
To determine if centrosome number affects lumen formation in vivo, we fused a

182

p2a-loxP-mCherry-STOP-loxP-Plk4 transgene to the 3’ end of the endogenous kdrl

183

gene for vascular-selective expression of Plk4 after loxP site excision (Fig. 4a). Adult

184

fish were then crossed to a Tg(fli:centrin-GFP) line, which allowed for visualization of

185

EC centrosomes. F1 embryos were injected with Cre mRNA and Plk4 overexpression

186

was determined by loss of the mCherry signal. Fish with Plk4 overexpression had an

187

increase in the percentage of EC with >2 centrosomes (Fig. 4b-c). To determine if

188

overexpression of Plk4 affected lumenogenesis, we performed microangiography at 72

189

hpf by injecting fluorescent microcarrier beads into the fish vasculature and examining

190

the intersegmental vessels (ISVs) for patency. Embryos with Plk4 overexpression had

191

fewer perfused ISVs compared to wild type controls or fish lacking Cre (Fig. 4d-e).

192

Reduced perfusion is indicative of narrower or absent lumens, suggesting that excess

193

centrosomes induced by Plk4 overexpression lead to disrupted lumenogenesis in vivo.

DISCUSSION

195

Angiogenesis involves migration and rearrangement of EC, and leads to new

196

conduits through anastomosis and lumen formation between adjacent EC [1–3]. It is

197

clear that cell-cell interactions and polarization in several axes are important for lumen

198

formation, but the role of the centrosome in these processes is poorly understood. Here,

199

we show that supernumerary centrosomes perturb EC polarity and cell adhesion and

200

disturb lumen formation in vitro and in vivo, implying that the centrosome is involved in

201

both junctional adhesion and the apical-basal polarization that precedes vascular lumen

202

formation or stabilization.

203
204

Our data highlights important roles for the centrosome in maintaining junction

205

integrity and lumen development in interphase cells. Besides overduplication,

206

centrosome function can be impacted by centriole loss or structural defects. While over-

207

duplication allows for progression through the cell-cycle, mis-localization of centrosomal

208

proteins, structural deficits, and centrosome loss all result in cell-cycle arrest during G1

209

[34]. The ability to examine effects of centrosome loss on interphase cell behavior is

210

therefore compromised, highlighting the utility of a centrosome overduplication model to

211

study centrosome function.

212
213

We show that EC cell-cell junctions are disrupted downstream of centrosome

214

perturbations. It is likely that these junctional defects contribute to poor lumenization in

215

vitro and in vivo. EC junctions are linked to vascular lumen formation during

216

anastomosis, where VE-cadherin facilitates tip cell interactions and subsequent junction

217

rearrangements necessary to form a continuous lumen [35,36]. Moreover, genetic loss

218

of VE-cadherin in mice or zebrafish leads to lumen defects, vascular dysfunction, and

219

embryonic lethality [22,23], supporting a link between disrupted adherens junctions and

220

malformed lumens in EC sprouts.

221
222

Our results reveal that lumens are perturbed following centrosome

223

overduplication in both an in vitro angiogenesis model lacking physiological flow and in

224

an in vivo zebrafish model with blood flow. These findings indicate that lumenal defects

225

resulting from excess centrosomes do not depend on shear stress exerted by blood

226

flow. During later stages of angiogenesis, high pressure from blood flow is necessary for

227

changes in cell morphology resulting in functional lumens [37]. However, lumens can

228

also form in vitro and in vivo absent blood flow [7,38]. Hultin and colleagues showed

229

that disruption of the VE-cadherin junctional complex via the scaffolding protein amotL2

230

was sufficient to prevent lumenal expansion independent of blood flow through changes

231

in cell contractility [38]. Thus, it is likely that the profound changes in VE-cadherin

232

localization at EC cell-cell junctions following centrosome over-duplication alter the

233

ability of EC to properly coordinate the cytoskeletal forces needed for polarization and

234

lumenogenesis, regardless of blood flow.

235
236

In summary, by providing the first link between centrosome perturbation and

237

adherens junction stability and lumenization, our data indicate a novel role for the

238

centrosome in EC polarity, junctions, and lumenization in blood vessels. These

239

abnormalities may contribute to tumor blood vessel dysfunction.

MATERIALS & METHODS

241

Cell culture

242

HUVEC (C2519A, Lonza) were cultured in EBM-2 (CC-3162, Lonza)

243

supplemented with the Endothelial Growth Medium (EGM-2) bullet kit (CC-3162, Lonza)

244

and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). Normal human lung fibroblasts (CC2512, Lonza)

245

were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1x antibiotic-

246

antimycotic (Gibco). All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Tetracycline-

247

inducible Plk4-overexpression HUVEC were generated as previously described

248

[13,15,30]. Viruses were produced by the UNC Lenti-shRNA Core Facility. To induce

249

centrosome overduplication, tet-Plk4 HUVEC were treated with 1µg/ml doxycycline

250

(DOX, D9891, Sigma) for 24hr followed by washout. Experiments were performed 48hr

251

following DOX addition.

252
253
254

3D sprouting angiogenesis assay
The 3D sprouting angiogenesis assay was performed as previously described

255

with the following changes [15,39]. Tet-Plk4 HUVEC were treated with 1µg/ml DOX for

256

24hr at 37°C. 13µl/ml centrin:eGFP lentivirus and 1µg/ml Polybrene were added to

257

HUVEC 16hr post DOX addition for the last 8hr of DOX treatment. Cells were washed

258

with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (MT-21-031-CV, Corning) and fresh

259

media was added to remove the virus and DOX. The following day, infected cells were

260

coated onto cytodex 3 microcarrier beads (17048501, GE Healthcare Life Sciences)

261

and embedded in a fibrin matrix as described. Z-stacks were acquired with an Olympus

262

confocal microscope (FV1200 or FV3000) and processed in Image J (National Institutes

263

of Health). Total vessel width was measured in the YZ plane by drawing a line through

264

the nucleus and across the entire vessel. Lumen width was measured in the YZ plane

265

using Moesin1 staining (1:1000, ab52490, Abcam) as a surrogate for the apical surface

266

and normalized to total vessel width. DAPI (10236276001, Sigma) was used to visualize

267

the nucleus.

268
269
270

Micropatterns
Large H-micropatterns (CYTOO) were coated with 5µg/ml fibronectin and seeded

271

with HUVEC according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were allowed to spread for

272

24hr, then fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4°C.

273
274

Immunofluorescence and quantification

275

Fixed HUVEC were blocked for 1hr at RT in blocking solution (5% FBS, 2X

276

antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco), 0.1% sodium azide (s2002-100G, Sigma) in DPBS). Cells

277

were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4°C, then washed 3X for 5 min in

278

DPBS. Secondary antibody and DRAQ7 (1:1000, ab109202, Abcam) were added for

279

1hr at RT followed by 3X washes for 10 min each in DPBS. Slides were mounted with

280

coverslips using Prolong Diamond Antifade mounting medium (P36961, Life

281

Technology) and sealed with nail polish. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted

282

in blocking solution. Images were acquired with an Olympus confocal microscope

283

(FV1200 or FV3000) and analyzed using ImageJ. Centrosome overduplication was

284

quantified by counting centrosome number in at least 500 cells per replicate. Junction

285

area on micropatterns was quantified by thresholding the VE-cadherin staining and

286

measuring total VE-cadherin area in ImageJ. VE-cadherin distribution on doublet

287

micropatterns was measured in ImageJ by drawing a line across the junction (from

288

centrosome in first cell to centrosome in second cell) and acquiring a line scan of VE-

289

cadherin intensity. Peaks were counted for each pattern and normalized to the line

290

length. Only peaks above half of the maximum VE-cadherin intensity were counted. The

291

following primary antibodies were used: anti-γ-tubulin (1:5000, T6557, Sigma-Aldrich),

292

anti-VE-cadherin (1:500, 2500S, Cell Signaling), anti-Moesin-1 (1:1000, ab52490,

293

Abcam). The following secondary antibodies from Thermo Fisher Scientific were used:

294

goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (1:500, A11029), goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594

295

(1:500, A11005), goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (1:500, A11034), goat anti-rabbit

Zebrafish
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were housed in an institutional animal care and use

300

committee (IACUC)-approved facility. Zebrafish were maintained as previously

301

described (Wiley, et al., 2011). Tg(kdrl:mCherry) was a gift from D. Stainier.

302

Tg(fli:centrin-GFP) was created by subcloning centrin:GFP into the pCR8/GW/TOPO

303

middle entry vector (Thermo Fisher) and then gateway cloning into the pDestTol2CG2

304

plasmid (REF Tol2 kit). Tol2 transposase RNA was generated using the sp6 mMessage

305

mMachine synthesis kit (AM1340, Thermo Fisher). For overexpression of Plk4, p2a-

306

Lox-mCherry-STOP-Lox-Plk4 was fused to the 3’ end of the endogenous kdrl gene. The

307

assembled construct was subcloned into the pKHR4 backbone and linearized by IsceI

embryos alongside the construct to generate double stranded breaks at the 3’ end of

the kdrl gene and induce homologous recombination as previous described [40]. F1

desired crosses and grown in E3 at 28.5°C. At 72 hpf, embryos were injected with

319

Qdot605 (Q10103MP, Thermo Fisher). Fish were fixed by incubating dechorionated

320

embryos in ice cold 4% PFA at 4°C overnight. Embryos were rinsed in PBS and

321

mounted using a fine probe to de-yolk and a small blade to separate the trunk from the

322

cephalic region and using VECTASHIELD® Hardset™ Antifade Mounting Medium. The

323

coverslip was sealed with petroleum jelly before imaging on an Olympus FV1200

324

confocal microscope. Centrosome overduplication was confirmed in Plk4-

325

overexpressing embryos based on centrin-GFP centriole labeling. ISV perfusion was

326

measured by counting the number of perfused ISVs based on Qdot605 signal as a

327

percentage of total ISV number (visualized using Tg(kdrl:mCherry)).
