Abstract Meiotic drive is the preferential transmission of a particular allele at a given locus
during sexual reproduction. The phenomenon is observed as spore killing in a variety of fungal
lineages, including Podospora. In natural populations of Podospora anserina, seven spore killers
(Psks) have been identiﬁed through classical genetic analyses. Here we show that the Spok gene
family underlie the Psk spore killers. The combination of the various Spok genes at different
chromosomal locations deﬁnes the spore killers and creates a killing hierarchy within the same
population. We identify two novel Spok homologs that are located within a complex region (the
Spok block) that reside in different chromosomal locations in given natural strains. We conﬁrm that
the individual SPOK proteins perform both the killing and resistance functions and show that these
activities are dependent on distinct domains, a nuclease and a kinase domain respectively.
Genomic data and phylogenetic analysis across ascomycetes suggest that the Spok genes disperse
via cross-species transfer, and evolve by duplication and diversiﬁcation within several lineages.

Introduction
The genomes of all Eukaryotes harbour selﬁsh genetic elements that employ a variety of mechanisms to undermine the canonical modes of DNA replication and meiosis to bias their own
transmission (Werren et al., 1988; Burt and Trivers, 2009). As the proliferation of these elements
is independent from the regulated reproduction of the host organism, they can create conﬂict
within the genome (Rice and Holland, 1997). Such intragenomic conﬂict is predicted by theory to
spur an arms race between the genome and the elements, and consequently act as a major driver
of evolutionary change (Werren, 2011). To understand the extent to which intragenomic conﬂict
has shaped the evolution of genomes and populations it is crucial to identify the selﬁsh genetic
elements which are able to impact the dynamics of natural populations.
One important class of selﬁsh genetic elements are known as meiotic drivers. These use
a variety of mechanisms to hijack meiosis in order to bias their transmission to the gametes in
proportions greater than 50% (Sandler and Novitski, 1957). This segregation distortion of alleles can
be diﬃcult to observe unless it is linked to an obvious phenotype such as sex (Sandler and Novitski,
1957; Helleu et al., 2014), thus the prevalence of meiotic drive in nature is likely underestimated.
Nevertheless, meiotic drive has been observed in many model systems, including Drosophila, Mus,

Neurospora, and Zea mays, suggesting that it is likely widespread across all major Eukaryotic groups
(Lindholm et al., 2016; Bravo Núñez et al., 2018). Meiotic drive can be classiﬁed into three broad
categories: female meiotic drive, sperm killing, and spore killing (Lindholm et al., 2016). Spore
killing is found in ascomycete fungi and represents the most direct way to observe the presence
of meiotic drive (Turner and Perkins, 1991). When a strain possessing a driving allele mates with
a compatible strain that does not carry the allele (i.e., a sensitive strain), the meiotic products
(ascospores) that carry the driving allele will induce the abortion of their sibling spores which do not
have the allele. Spore killing is apparent in the sexual structures (asci) of the fungi as it results in half
of the normal number of viable spores. Due to the haplontic life cycle of most fungi, spore killing
is unusual among meiotic drivers as it is the only system where the offspring of an organism are
killed by the drive (Lyttle, 1991). Additionally, with few exceptions (Hammond et al., 2012; Svedberg
et al., 2018), spore killer elements appear to be governed by single loci that confer both killing and
resistance (Grognet et al., 2014; Nuckolls et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017), which is in contrast to the
other well-studied drive systems that comprise genomic regions as large as entire chromosomes
(Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012; Hammer et al., 1989).
Meiotic drivers are often expected to reach ﬁxation or extinction in populations relatively rapidly
(Crow, 1991), at which point the effects of the drivers will no longer be observable. In agreement
with this expectation, most drivers which have been described exhibit large shifts in frequencies in
both time and space (Lindholm et al., 2016; Carvalho and Vaz, 1999). In the case of spore killers,
multiple drivers have been found to coexist within a given species. The evolutionary dynamics of
multiple drivers within species has not been thoroughly explored, but two contrasting examples
are known. In genomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, numerous copies of both functional and
pseudogenized versions of the wtf driver genes are found, suggesting that they duplicate readily,
drive to high frequency in populations, and then lose their ability to kill (Nuckolls et al., 2017; Hu
et al., 2017). In contrast, the two spore killers Sk-2 and Sk-3 of Neurospora intermedia have only been
described in wild strains four times and once respectively, whereas resistance to spore killing is
widespread (Turner, 2001). In neither of these cases, have the impact of multiple drivers coexisting
in a single population been characterized.
Natural populations of the ﬁlamentous fungus Podospora anserina are known to host multiple
spore killers (Grognet et al., 2014; van der Gaag et al., 2000; Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004) and
hence, provide an ideal system for the investigation of interactions among drivers at the population
level. The ﬁrst spore killer gene described in P. anserina was het-s, a gene that is also involved in
allorecognition (Dalstra et al., 2003). Another class of spore killer genes in Podospora are known as
Spok genes. Spok1 is only known from a single representative of the closely related species P. comata,
while Spok2 has been shown to exist in high frequency among strains of a French population of
P. anserina (Grognet et al., 2014). Spok1 is capable of killing in the presence of Spok2, but not vice
versa, indicating a dominant epistatic relationship between the two genes. Using visual observation
of spore killing in crosses among French and Dutch P. anserina strains, seven separate spore killers
have been identiﬁed (van der Gaag et al., 2000). These are referred to as Psk-1 through Psk-7 and
can be distinguished through classical genetic analysis, by observing the presence, absence and
frequency of killed spores when the different spore killers are crossed to each other (Box 1). At
the onset of this study, it was not known whether the Psks represent independent meiotic drive
genes, or if they may be related to the Spoks and/or allorecognition loci. The het-s gene itself is not
associated with the Psks, but allorecognition is correlated with Psk spore killing (van der Gaag et al.,
2003). On the other hand, the relationship between the Spoks is reminiscent of the hierarchy of
killing among the Psks, suggesting a possible connection between the activity of Spok genes and
Psks.
The primary goal of this study was to determine the identity of the genes that are responsible

Box 1 Figure 1. Meiosis in Podospora

The seven separate Psks are deﬁned by their spore killing percentage and mutual interactions.
To understand how the spore killing percentages relate to the genotypes of the strains, it is
necessary to ﬁrst appreciate some of the fundamental aspects of Podospora biology. Within the
fruiting body (perithecium), dikaryotic cells undergo karyogamy to produce a diploid nucleus
and immediately enter meiosis. After meiosis, one round of post-meiotic mitosis occurs,
resulting in eight daughter nuclei. The nuclei are packaged together with their non-sister
nuclei from mitosis (dashed line) to generate dikaryotic, self-compatible spores. In a cross
where the parental strains harbour two alternative alleles for a given gene of interest (one
of which is indicated by the red mark on the chromosome), spores can be produced which
are either homoallelic or heteroallelic for the gene, depending on the type of segregation.
Speciﬁcally, if there is no recombination event between the gene and the centromere, the gene
undergoes ﬁrst division segregation (FDS) and the parental alleles co-segregate during meiosis
I, generating homoallelic spores (i). FDS of a spore killing gene will thus result in a 2-spored
ascus (ii). If there is a recombination event between the gene of interest and the centromere,
second division segregation (SDS) occurs. In this case heteroallelic spores will be formed (i).
For spore killing, a 4-spored ascus will still be produced as only one copy of the spore killer is
required to provide resistance (ii). As SDS is reliant on recombination, the frequency of SDS
relates to the relative distance from the centromere and can be used for linkage mapping.
When there is spore killing, the percent of 2-spored asci is the frequency of FDS, and is referred
to as “spore killing percentage”. The Psks were described by crossing different strains and
evaluating what their spore killing percentage is in each cross. The seven unique Psks were
shown to interact in a complex hierarchy, showing either a dominance interaction, or mutual
killing. Notably, crosses of strains carrying mutually resistant spore killers can still produce
2-spore asci if the killer loci are in different chromosomal locations (See Appendix 1 for more
details and Figure 4–Figure Supplement 1 for a reproduction of the hierarchy presented in
van der Gaag et al. (2000)).

for the Psk spore killers found in P. anserina, and whether they relate to known meiotic drive genes.
We identiﬁed two novel Spok homologs (Spok3 and Spok4) and showed that these two, together
with the previously described Spok2, represent the genetic basis of the Psk spore killers. The novel
Spoks occur in large complex regions that can be found in different genomic locations in different
strains. Our results illuminate the underlying genetics of a polymorphic meiotic drive system and
expand our knowledge regarding their mechanism of action.

To investigate the genetic basis of spore killing in P. anserina, we generated high quality whole
genome assemblies using a combination of long read (PacBio and MinION Oxford Nanopore) and
short read (Illumina HiSeq) technologies. Table 1 lists strains used for investigation. First, we
selected strains from a natural population in Wageningen (Wa), the Netherlands, representing six
of the previously described Psk spore killers (van der Gaag et al., 2000) along with a strain of a
novel killing type (Wa100) that we referred to as Psk-8, and strain Wa63. Wa63 is of the same Psk
type as the reference strain S, which we refer to herein as Psk-S. Additionally, we acquired and
sequenced strains from the closely related Podospora species, P. comata (strain T) and P. pauciseta
(CBS237.71). A strain labelled T (hereafter referred as TG ) was kindly provided by Andrea Hamann
and Heinz Osiewacz from the Goethe University Frankfurt and originates from the laboratory of
Denise Marcou. However, as the genome sequence of TG did not match that reported by Silar et al.
(2018), but instead is a strain of P. anserina, we included in our dataset another strain labelled T
from the Wageningen Collection that was originally provided by the laboratory of Léon Belcour. We
refer to this strain as TD , and sequenced it using only Illumina HiSeq. The genome of TD matches
Silar et al. (2018) as the epitype of P. comata (See Appendix 2 for further discussion).
The ﬁnal assemblies (long-read technologies polished with Illumina HiSeq data) consist of 18
to 53 scaffolds, from which the majority were either mitochondrial or rDNA in origin. Amongst
the remaining scaffolds, the expected seven chromosomes were recovered in their entirety for
almost all strains with PacBio data, and in up to 15 scaffolds with those sequenced using MinION
(Figure 1–source data 1). Since the assemblies of each strain were produced from one haploid
(monokaryotic) isolate, we will refer to speciﬁc genome assemblies with their strain name followed
by their corresponding mating type, e.g. Wa63+.

Identiﬁcation of novel Spok genes
By searching our assemblies for the Spok2 sequence (presented by Grognet et al. (2014)) using
BLAST, we could conﬁrm the presence of this Spok gene in the majority of strains, in agreement
with Grognet et al. (2014). Furthermore, based on sequence similarity with Spok2, we identiﬁed two
novel homologs that we refer to as Spok3 and Spok4. Additionally, the BLAST searches recovered a
pseudogenized Spok gene (SpokΨ1). The Spok gene content of the strains investigated in this study
is reported in Table 1.
A schematic representation of the Spok homologs is shown in Figure 1A. We considered the
Spok2 sequence of S+, and the Spok3 and Spok4 sequences of Wa87+ as reference alleles for each
homolog. Overall they show a high degree of conservation, including the 3’ and 5’ UTRs. A nucleotide
alignment of the Spok genes’ CDS revealed 130/2334 variable sites among the homologs (Figure
1–Figure Supplement 1 and Figure 1–source data 1). A relatively large proportion (67%, 87/130) of
those result in amino acid changes and 74% are unique to one of the Spok homologs. There are
also six indels among all the Spok genes including one at the 5’ end of the ORF, which represents a

variable length repeat region, and one at the 3’ end of the ORF shared by Spok3 and Spok4. The 3’
end indel induces a frameshift and changes the position of the stop codon (Figure 1A). SpokΨ1 has a
missing 5’ end, multiple stop codons, and a discoglosse (Tc1/mariner-like) DNA transposon (Espagne
et al., 2008) inserted in the coding region. Of particular interest, SpokΨ1 has no deletions relative to
the other Spok homologs, suggesting the indels in the functional Spok homologs represent derived
deletions.
To aid in the identiﬁcation of the meiotic drive genes, we gathered Illumina HiSeq data from
the reference strain S together with four strains resulting from backcrossing of Psk-1, Psk-2, Psk-5,
and Psk-7 into S (Table 1). These and all other genomes sequenced with short-read data were
assembled de novo using SPAdes. The resulting assemblies consisted of between 222 and 418
scaffolds larger than 500bp, with a mean N50 of 227 kbp (Supplementary ﬁle 2). The coverage of
the publicly available reference genome of the strain S+ (Espagne et al., 2008), hereafter referred to
as Podan2, was above 98% for all of the SPAdes assemblies of P. anserina. When the ﬁltered Illumina
reads were mapped to Podan2, all samples had a depth of coverage above 75x (Supplementary ﬁle
2). Taken together, our genome assemblies, resulting from both long and short-read data, are very
comprehensive.
There is little allelic variation within the Spok homologs in the Wageningen population and the
variants of the four homologs cluster phylogenetically (Figure 1B and C). The Spok2 gene in the
Wageningen strains are identical to the two alleles described in Grognet et al. (2014), with the
exception of Spok2 from Wa58- which has a single SNP that results in a D358N substitution. The
Spok2 allele of the French strain A, which shows resistance without killing (as reported by Grognet
et al. (2014)), was not found in any of our genomes. Spok3 has ﬁve allelic variants, and the allelic
variation of Spok4 is reminiscent of Spok2 with only Wa100+ and Wa58- having a single synonymous
SNP (Figure 1C). Lastly, the three copies of SpokΨ1 are all unique (Figure 2–source data 2).
Notably, a number of the variants of Spok3 show signatures of gene conversion events (Lazzaro
and Clark, 2001). Speciﬁcally, strain Y+ has three SNPs near the start of the gene that result in
amino acid changes and match exactly those in Spok2 (Figure 1–Figure Supplement 1). The Wa53+
allele of Spok3 has a series of SNPs (a track of 205 bp) that are identical to Spok4, but different from
all other Spok3 sequences, and three additional SNPs near the 5’ end that also match Spok4 (Figure
1–Figure Supplement 1). The TG + strain possesses two identical copies of Spok3 (see Methods)
that share the aforementioned tract with Wa53+, but which extends for an additional 217 bp
(Figure 1–Figure Supplement 1). These chimeric Spoks are recovered from the ﬁnal assemblies (preand post-Pilon polishing) with high long-read coverage (>30x), suggesting that our ﬁnding is not a
bioinformatic artifact. The gene conversion events between Spok homologs are supported by the
reticulation shown in a NeighborNet split network (Figure 1B) and by a signiﬁcant recombination Phi
test (199 informative sites, p = 1.528e−12). A Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the UTR
sequences (deﬁned by conservation across homologs) suggests that Spok3 and Spok4 are closely
related (Figure 1C), which is at odds with the high structural similarity of the CDS of Spok1 and Spok4
(Figure 1A). Therefore, we cannot make any strong inference about the relationships between the
Spok homologs from the sequence data.
The Spok1 gene was previously identiﬁed from TD (Grognet et al., 2014). No other strains
investigated in this study were found to possess Spok1, indicating that it is likely not present in P.
anserina. Remarkably, BLAST searches of the Spok2 with the UTR sequences revealed the presence
of a small piece (~156 bp long) of a presumably degraded Spok gene in the TD de novo assembly and
on the chromosome 4 of the reference P. comata genome released by Silar et al. (2018). This piece
overlaps with the last amino acids of the CDS 3’ end and it is ﬂanked by an arthroleptis (solo LTR)
retrotransposon on one side and by unknown sequence on the other. Due to the small size, it is
unclear if this piece belongs to a novel Spok gene, but the location (between genes PODCO_401390

Figure 1. Relationships among the Spok homologs. A Schematic representation of the main features of the Spok genes. All homologs share an
intron within the 5’ UTR. At the start of the coding region there is a repeat region, where the number of repeats varies among the homologs. The
central portion of the coding regions has a number of indels, which appear to be independent deletions in each of Spok2, Spok3, and Spok4. There
is a frameshift mutation at the 3’ end of the coding region that shifts the stop codon of Spok3 and Spok4 into what is the 3’ UTR of Spok1 and Spok2.
The pseudogenized Spok gene contains none of the aforementioned central indels and appears to share the stop codon of Spok1 and Spok2.
However, there are numerous mutations resulting in stop codons within the CDS as well as a full DNA transposon (discoglosse). No homologous
sequence of the 5’ end of the pseudospok is present. B A NeighborNet split network of all active Spok genes from all strains sequenced in this
study. The four homologs cluster together well, however there are a number of reticulations, presumably due to gene conversion events. C
Maximum likelihood trees based of three separate regions of the Spok genes: the 5’ UTR, the CDS, and the 3’ UTR (starting from the stop codon of
Spok3 and Spok4). The trees are rooted arbitrarily using Spok2. Branches are drawn proportional to the scale bar (substitutions per site), with
bootstrap support values higher than 70 shown above.

and PODCO_401400) does not align with any other known homolog. Strain CBS237.71 was formerly
identiﬁed as P. comata and was reported to possess a Spok gene (Grognet et al., 2014). It has now
been assigned to its own species, P. pauciseta (Boucher et al., 2017) and the sequencing reveals that
the genome of this strain contains both Spok3 and Spok4 (Figure 1B).

Backcrossing conﬁrms the association of the Spok genes with the Psks
Four of the Psk spore killers were previously introgressed into the reference strain S through ﬁve
successive backcrosses (van der Gaag et al., 2000) and are referred to here as Psk1xS5 , Psk2xS5 ,
Psk5xS5 , and Psk7xS5 (Table 1). Our Illumina data recovered in total 41482 ﬁltered biallelic SNPs
from the four S5 backcrosses and the parental strains. All backcrossed strains show a few continuous
tracts of SNPs from the killer parent (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 3). For example, Psk1xS5 - has
a long tract in chromosome 1 that represents the mat- mating type, which is expected since the
published reference of S (Podan2), for which the SNPs are called, is of the opposite mating type
(mat+). Importantly, the location of the Spok genes of each parental strain has a corresponding
introgressed SNP tract in its S5 backcross, while all backcrossed strains possess the Spok2 gene
from strain S (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 3). Notably, crossing results reveal that Psk5xS5 has a
Psk-1 killing phenotype whereas all other S5 backcrossed strains maintained the parental phenotype
(Figure 4–source data 1). However as strain Y does not possess Spok2, the overall Spok content of Y
is not the same as Psk5xS5 (Table 1). These data suggest that the Spok content is responsible for
the killer phenotype of the Psks.
As the various Psk types reﬂect speciﬁc Spok gene content, we can estimate the frequency of each
Spok gene in the Wageningen population from van der Gaag et al. (2000). We have determined
the Spok gene composition for Psk-1, Psk-2, Psk-4, Psk-5, and Psk-7, as well as those previously
considered as “sensitive”, now Psk-S. These account for 92/99 strains collected from Wageningen.
The seven remaining strains were identiﬁed as either Psk-3 or Psk-6. Our representative strain of
Psk-3 (Wa21) was shown to be Psk-2, and we are unable to comment on Psk-6 as our representative
strain (Wa47) behaves as Psk-4 in test crosses (Table 1). Therefore we assume strains annotated as
Psk-4 possess no functional Spok genes (hereafter referred to as naïve) and omit all the Psk-3 strains
(except Wa21) and the Psk-6 strains (except Wa47) from the analysis. Hence, Spok2 is estimated to
be in 98% of strains, Spok3 in 17%, and Spok4 in 11% of Dutch strains.

Spok genes are found in complex regions associated with killer phenotypes
While the Spok genes are often assembled into small fragmented contigs when obtained by using
Illumina data alone, in the PacBio and MinION assemblies Spok3 and Spok4 are fully recovered
within an inserted block of novel sequence (74–167 kbp depending on the strain), hereafter referred
to as the Spok block. When present, the Spok block was never found more than once per genome
and always contains at least one Spok gene. Whole genome alignments revealed that the Spok
block has clear boundaries, and is localized at different chromosomal positions on chromosome 3
or in either arm of chromosome 5 in different strains of P. anserina (Table 1). Importantly, these
positions correspond with a single SNP tract from the S5 backcrosses. In P. pauciseta (CBS237.71)
the Spok block is found in chromosome 4. The Spok block of the different strains shares segments
and overall structure (Figure 2 and Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1), which suggests that they have a
shared ancestry. However, complex rearrangements are found when aligning the block between
the genomes. Within the Spok block, a given strain can harbour either or both of Spok3 and Spok4
and the regions containing the Spok genes appear to represent a duplication event (Figure 2). Strain
TG + shows an additional duplication which has resulted in a second copy of Spok3 (Figure 2–Figure
Supplement 1). While Spok3 and Spok4 are always found within the block, Spok2 is never associated

with a Spok block, but is found at the same location on chromosome 5 as previously described for
the reference strain S (Grognet et al., 2014). When present, SpokΨ1 was found at a single position
in the right arm of chromosome 5. It is surrounded by numerous transposable elements (TEs), and
the region does not appear to be homologous to the Spok block (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 2).
In the few strains with no copy of Spok2, analysis of the region suggests that this is a result of
a one-time deletion (Figure 3). The annotation in the original reference genomes of TD and S is
erroneous due to misassemblies and/or incomplete exon prediction, which were both corrected
using our own Illumina data, annotation pipeline, and validated with RNAseq expression data of
TD . First, the ﬂanking gene P_5_20 (marked as (1) in Figure 3) in P. pauciseta (CBS237.71) and P.
comata (TD ) is considerably longer than the P. anserina ortholog, which is truncated by a discoglosse
(Tc1/mariner-like) DNA transposon (2). In the strains without Spok2 (Wa46, Y, and TG ), this discoglosse
itself is interrupted and the sequence continues on the 3’ end of a fragmented crapaud (gypsy/Ty3)
LTR element, which can be found in full length downstream of Spok2 in the other strains. This
conﬁguration implies that the absence of Spok2 constitutes a deletion (3), rather than the ancestral
state within P. anserina. An alternative scenario would require multiple additional insertions and
deletions of TEs and Spok2.

chromosome 5 of the three sampled species. Every strain has a haplotype of different size, mainly due to differences in transposable element (TE)
content. Within P. anserina, the TE variation across all sequenced strains occurs downstream of Spok2, as exempliﬁed by strains Wa63 and S. The
strains Wa46, Y and TG all lack Spok2 and share break points. Notice that P_5_20 stands for the Pa_5_20 and PODCO_500020 in the reference
annotation of P. anserina and P. comata, respectively, while P_0_1630 stands for Pa_0_1630 and PODCO_001630. As a note, P. pauciseta has a
duplication of three genes in tandem from chromosome one (Pa_1_1080-60) between the ﬂanking genes. Hit_Pa_X_XXX genes stand for signiﬁcant

Spok3 and Spok4 function as meiotic drive genes
We constructed knock-in and knock-out strains to conﬁrm that the newly discovered Spok homologs
Spok3 and Spok4 can induce spore killing on their own (Table 2), as previously shown for Spok2
by Grognet et al. (2014). First, the Spok2 gene was deleted from the strain s to create a ΔSpok2
strain for use with the knock-ins. A cross between s and the ΔSpok2 strain resulted in about ~40%
of 2-spored asci as previously reported by Grognet et al. (2014), (80/197, 40.6%) (Figure 4–Figure
Supplement 2B). The Spok3 and Spok4 genes were inserted separately at the centromere-linked
PaPKS1 locus (a gene controlling pigmentation of spores (Coppin and Silar, 2007)). A Spok3::PaPKS1
ΔSpok2 x ΔSpok2 cross yielded almost 100% 2-spored asci with two white (unpigmented) spores
(118/119, 99.1%) (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2C). Similarly, a Spok4::PaPKS1 ΔSpok2 x ΔSpok2 cross
yielded almost 100% 2-spored asci with two white (unpigmented) spores (343/346, 99.1%) (Figure
4–Figure Supplement 2D), indicating that Spok3 and Spok4 function as spore killers when introduced
in a single copy at the PaPKS1 locus.

The P. anserina Spok homologs are functionally independent
To determine whether there are epistatic interactions among the Spok genes of P. anserina, pairwise
crosses between the strains were conducted to determine which matings resulted in spore killing
(Figure 4–source data 1). To assess any epistatic interaction between different killer types, dikaryotic
F1 progeny that are homoallelic for the killing locus (Box 1) were selected, backcrossed to both
parental strains, and were also allowed to self. Killing interactions were classiﬁed into one of the
following categories.
1. Dominance interaction - Spore killing is observed when backcrossed to only one of the parental
strains, and no spore killing is observed upon selﬁng.
2. Mutual resistance - No spore killing is observed when backcrossed to either parent nor when
selfed.
3. Mutual killing - Spore killing is observed when backcrossed to either parent and/or when F1
progeny are selfed.
As an example, in a cross between Psk-1 and Psk-7 there is spore killing. However the F1 progeny
from this cross show no killing to either parent, satisfying condition 2. Thus they are mutually
resistant, which is consistent with the fact that they carry the same three Spok genes. The reason
spore killing is observed in the original cross is because the Spok block is located at different
genomic positions. As a result, the Spok block can co-segregate during meiosis, leaving two spores
without any Spoks and making them vulnerable to killing (see Appendix 1 for a detailed explanation).
The results from these crosses are reported in Figure 4–source data 1. Note that we found
several of the Psk designations of the strains to differ from those reported previously, and these
discrepancies are shown in Table 1. From the epistatic interactions and killing percentages of the
crosses, we construct a killing hierarchy (Figure 4) that also differs from that reported in van der
Gaag et al. (2000) (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 1). In summary, our results show that Spok2, Spok3,
and Spok4 all act as spore killers and have no epistatic interactions with each other. The killing
hierarchy observed in the Wageningen population of P. anserina is an emergent property of the
presence and absence of the various Spok homologs in the different genomes. The rationale behind
these conclusions is explained in detail below.

Figure 4. Interactions among the various Psk types and the occurrence of Spok genes. A The boxes represent hierarchical levels that increase in
killing dominance from bottom to top, which correlates with the number of Spok genes that a strain possesses. Strains with three Spok genes
induce spore killing of strains with only two Spok genes and show mutual resistance to each other. Strains with two Spok genes show mutual killing
among themselves due to the different Spok genes and kill strains with only Spok2. Strains with one Spok kill strains with no Spok genes (naïve
strains). The chromosome diagrams depict the presence of the Spok genes and their location in the genome for the sequenced strains. B A
zoomed in look at Chromosome 5 of a Psk-7 strain demonstrating that Spok3 and Spok4 are present in the Spok block and Spok2 is present at the
standard location. C The closely related species P. comata and P. pauciseta also possess Spok genes, but at different locations. The Spok genes in P.
pauciseta are present in a smaller Spok block, while Spok1 is found on its own and exclusively in P. comata.

Spore killer types Psk-1 and Psk-7 reside at the top of the hierarchy, possess a Spok block with
both Spok3 and Spok4, and have Spok2 (Figure 4). Psk-2 and Psk-8 are both dominant over Psk-S,
which only has Spok2. Psk-2 has a Spok block with just Spok3 on the right arm of chromosome 5 and
Psk-8 has a Spok block with just Spok4 at the same position as Psk-7 on the left arm of chromosome
5, indicating that Spok2 does not provide resistance to either Spok3 or Spok4. Psk-1 and Psk-7 are
both dominant over Psk-2 and Psk-8, indicating that Spok3 does not provide resistance to Spok4 and
vice versa. The fact that Psk-S is capable of killing strains with no Spok genes (i.e. naïve) conﬁrms
previous results that Spok2 alone is able to induce spore killing (Figure 4; and see Grognet et al.
(2014)).
Psk-5 is a slightly more complicated case. It displays mutual killing with Psk-S and kills naïve
strains, but Psk-1 is dominant over Psk-5. Psk-1 and Psk-5 possess the same Spok block at the same
location in Chromosome 3 (Figure 4 and Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1), but Psk-5 does not possess
Spok2, suggesting that Spok2 is responsible for killing in these crosses. If Spok2 is responsible for
killing when Psk-1 is crossed with Psk-5, we expect the killing percentage to be the same as with
crosses between Psk-S and naïve strains (~40%). However, these crosses consistently show only
~25% killing. To conﬁrm that Spok2 is responsible for killing in crosses between Psk-1 and Psk-5, a
pooled sequencing approach was employed. A cross was conducted between Wa87 (Psk-1) and Y
(Psk-5), and spores from 2-spored (spore killing) and 4-spored asci (heteroallelic for killers) were
collected and sequenced in separate pools. The 2-spored pool only contains SNPs from Wa87
for a large portion of Chromosome 5, which includes the Spok2 gene, whereas the 4-spored pool
contains SNPs from both parents at this genomic location (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 3). As the
2-spored asci are the result of FDS of the killing locus (Box 1), this result strongly suggests that Spok2
is responsible for spore killing when Psk-1 is crossed to Psk-5 and thus that neither Spok3 nor Spok4
provides resistance against Spok2.
Of note, crosses between Psk-1 and Psk-5 often produce 3-spored asci and occasionally show
erratic killing, which may contribute to the lower killing percentages. This phenomenon is also
observed in crosses between Psk-S and naïve strains. We have been able to isolate a spore from a
3-spored ascus in a cross between Psk-S and a naïve strain that has no copy of Spok2 (Appendix 2).
Therefore, the 3-spored asci are likely due to incomplete penetrance of the killing factor and
supports the conclusion that the spore killing observed in these crosses is caused by the same gene,
Spok2. This result is consistent with ﬁndings presented in the study by van der Gaag (2005) that
provided independent evidence for incomplete penetrance of spore killing between S and Wa46
(Psk-S and naïve).
The spore killing interactions of Spok3 and Spok4 cannot be dissociated from the Spok block
with the use of wild or introgressed strains, so we made use of the aforementioned knock-in
strains to conﬁrm the independence of the Spok gene interactions from the Spok block. First,
to conﬁrm the killing interaction between Spok3 and Spok4, we crossed a strain bearing Spok4
at PaPKS1 with a strain bearing Spok3. Because crosses homozygous for the PaPKS1 deletion
have poor fertility, we constructed a strain in which Spok3 is inserted as a single copy at the
PaPKS1 locus but just downstream of the coding region (Spok3::PaPKS1d) in order to yield strains
with normal pigmentation and normal fertility in crosses to PaPKS1 deletion strains. In control
crosses, the Spok3::PaPKS1d strain showed killing when crossed with a strain lacking Spok3 but no
killing when crossed with Spok3::PaPKS1 (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2E and F). The cross between
Spok3::PaPKS1d and Spok4::PaPKS1 yields asci with 4 aborted spores indicating mutual killing of
Spok3 and Spok4 (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2G). To determine the killing relation between Spok2
and Spok3, a cross was conducted between Spok3::PaPKS1 and s. This cross yielded mostly 2-spored
asci with two unpigmented spores (163/165, 98.8%) (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2H) indicating
that Spok3 kills in the presence of Spok2. Similarly, to determine the killing relation between Spok2

and Spok4, a cross was conducted between Spok4::PaPKS1 and s (216/217, 99.5%) (Figure 4–Figure
Supplement 2I). While these crosses indicate that Spok2 does not confer resistance to Spok3 and
Spok4 (Spok3 and Spok4 both kill Spok2), they do not allow us to determine as such whether Spok3
or Spok4 confer resistance to Spok2. To address this point, Spok2 killing was analyzed in a cross
homozygous for Spok3 (Spok3::PaPKS1 x Spok3::PaPKS1d ΔSpok2), which yielded 46% two-spored asci
(143/310) conﬁrming that Spok2 killing occurs in the presence of Spok3 (Figure 4–Figure Supplement
2J). To determine if Spok4 is resistant to Spok2, we made a Spok4::PaPKS1 x Spok4::PaPKS1 ΔSpok2
cross (11/24 two-spored asci) (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2K). Although this genetic background is
ill suited for determining killing frequency (because of the aforementioned effect of the homozygous
PaPKS1 deletion on fertility), presence of 2-spore asci suggests that Spok4 does not confer resistance
to Spok2 killing. Overall, these results conﬁrm the ﬁndings with the wild strains that Spok2, Spok3,
and Spok4 have no epistatic interactions, and imply that the Spok block does not augment the
function of the Spok genes.
In contrast to the absence of epistatic interactions among Spok genes of P. anserina, Spok1 of
P. comata and Spok2 do interact epistatically (Grognet et al., 2014). To determine if Spok1 is also
dominant to Spok3 and Spok4, crosses were conducted between strain TD and strains of P. anserina.
Although TD shows low fertility with P. anserina (Boucher et al., 2017), we were successful in mating
TD to a number of the P. anserina strains of the different Psk spore killer types (Figure 4–source
data 1 and 2). Often only few perithecia were produced with limited numbers of asci available to
count, but despite this obstacle, the crosses clearly demonstrate that TD is dominant to Psk-S and
Psk-2, and is mutually resistant to Psk-5. This result implies that Spok1 provides resistance to all
of the Spok homologs in P. anserina and is capable of killing in the presence of Spok2 and Spok3,
but not Spok4. The mutual resistance with Psk-5 also demonstrates that Spok4 provides resistance
against Spok1. Additional crosses were also conducted with the P. pauciseta strain CBS237.71, which
conﬁrms no epistatic interactions between Spok3 and Spok4 in this strain (Figure 4–source data 1
and 2). As both TD and CBS237.71 have unique spore killing phenotypes, we assign them the labels
Psk-C1 and Psk-P1, respectively.

An intron in the 5’ UTR is not required for spore killing
To investigate if the Spok genes are expressed during spore killing, we conducted an additional nine
backcrosses of the S5 strains to S, in order to generate S14 backcrossed strains (see methods). We
produced RNAseq data of self-killing S14 cultures and mapped the reads to the ﬁnal assemblies
of the parental strains. The expression of the Spok genes is evident in this data and supports the
presence of an intron in the 5’ UTR of the Spok homologs (Figure 1 and Figure 1–Figure Supplement
2). Given its conservation across the Spok homologs and since the wtf spore killer system in S. pombe
was described to involve two alternate transcripts of the same gene (Hu et al., 2017; Nuckolls et al.,
2017), the role of this intron in the Spok3 spore killing activity was investigated. The intron was
deleted in the plasmid bearing the Spok3::PaPKS1 deletion cassette by site directed mutagenesis
and the modiﬁed plasmid was used to transform the ΔKu70 ΔSpok2 strain. Three transformants
bearing the Spok3 lacking the intron sequence (Spok3 Δi) were crossed to a ΔSpok2 strain. As in
the control cross with wild type (wt) Spok3, in which close to 100% killing was found, we observed
that 109/109 of the asci contained two unpigmented spores (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2L). Thus,
Spok3 Δi displays wt killing activity. We conclude from this experiment that the unspliced form of
Spok3 is not required for normal killing activity, nor does the killing and resistance function via an
alternatively spliced form of this intron.

Functional annotation of SPOK3 predicts three ordered domains
In order to gain insights on the molecular function of the SPOK proteins, domain identiﬁcation was
performed with HHPred and a HMM proﬁle based on an alignment of 282 Spok3 homologs from
various Ascomycota species. The SPOK3 protein was predicted to be composed of three folded
domains (located at positions ~40 – 170, 210 – 400 and 490 – 700 in the protein) separated by two
unstructured domains (~170 – 210 and 400 – 490) as shown in Figure 5. No functional identiﬁcation
was recovered for domain 1, however a coiled-coil motif was found in the N-terminal 40 amino
acids and predicted to form a parallel dimer, which corresponds to the variable length repeat of the
nucleotide sequences (Figure 1A). Domain 2 showed homology to a class of phosphodiesterase of
the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily (~214 – 325) with the catalytic residues forming the PD-(D/E)XK motif
spanning positions 219 to 240 in the SPOK3 sequence (Steczkiewicz et al., 2012). The best hit in
HHPred was to the HsdR subunit of a type-I restriction enzyme from Vibrio vulniﬁcus (Uyen et al.,
2009). The sequences align in the catalytic core region in the PD-(D/E)XK motif and also around
a QxxxY motif (294 – 298 in SPOK3) that was found to be important for nucleic acid binding and
nuclease activity (Sisáková et al., 2008) (Figure 5–Figure Supplement 2).
Domain 3 was identiﬁed as a kinase domain (~539 – 700) as predicted previously by Grognet
et al. (2014). Additionally, a motif with a cluster of three highly conserved cysteine residues and
histidine (C-x3-C-x13-C-x5-H-x7-H) reminiscent of zinc ﬁnger motifs was identiﬁed upstream of the
kinase motif (Figure 5). As previously reported for Spok2, D667 was identiﬁed as the catalytic base
residue in the catalytic loop (subdomain VIb) of the kinase domain. While kinases often use other
proteins as substrates, they may also target small molecules (Smith and King, 1995). Inspection
of the VIb and VII functional regions, which are informative regarding kinase substrate speciﬁcity,
suggests that the Spok-kinase domain might be more closely related to eukaryotic-like kinases
(ELKs) than to eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) raising the possibility that this kinase domain is not
necessarily a protein kinase domain but could phosphorylate other substrates (Steczkiewicz et al.,
2012; Kannan et al., 2007).
The SPOK proteins show a large degree of conservation among them and analyses of molecular
evolution suggest that different domains of the protein evolve under different constraints. Table 3
displays pairwise comparisons of the SPOK proteins. We tested whether any sites were evolving
under positive selection using PAML 4.8 (Yang, 2007). The model of positive selection (M2) did not
ﬁt our data signiﬁcantly better than its nested neutral model (M1). Furthermore, a likelihood test of
model M3 (heterogenous site model) against the null model M0 (Homogeneous site model) showed
no signiﬁcant difference, which is likely due to the small number of sequences used in the analysis.
In lieu of the site speciﬁc model, we calculated dN /dS ratios for the three predicted domains. The
average dN /dS ratios of Spok2, Spok3, and Spok4 are 2.70, 0.36, and 0.86 for domain 1, domain 2 and
domain 3, respectively. This result suggests that domain 1 evolves under positive selection, domain
2 under purifying selection, and domain 3 under neutral or weakly purifying selection in P. anserina.

The killing and resistance functions can be attributed to separate domains
The ability of the Spoks to perform both killer and resistance function with a single protein is
unique among meiotic drive systems (Bravo Núñez et al., 2018). To investigate the role that the
aforementioned domains may play in these two functions, we constructed a number of point
mutations and truncation variants of Spok3 and assayed their ability to kill or provide resistance
in vegetative cells. We are able to determine that domain 2 is important for killing activity while
domain 3 is important for resistance activity.
It was shown previously that the kinase domain of SPOK2 (Figure 5) is involved in the resistance
function (Grognet et al., 2014). We generated a point mutant affected for the predicted catalytic aspartic acid residue of Spok3 (D667A). The mutant allele was ﬁrst used in transformation of a ΔSpok2
recipient strain. This Spok3 D667A mutant allele leads to a drastic reduction in transformation
eﬃciency (Figure 4–source data 2) while the Spok3 wt allele only moderately affects the number
of transformants. Since this ﬁrst approach results in random integration and potential multicopy
insertion, we also attempted to introduce the mutant Spok3 D667A allele as a single copy at the
PaPKS1 locus as described above for wt Spok3. The initial transformants were heterokaryotic and
displayed sectors of abnormal growth that corresponded to unpigmented mycelium presumably
containing nuclei with Spok3 D667A that inserted at PaPKS1. Monokaryotic transformants could
be recovered and were tested in killing activity in a cross to a ΔSpok2. Four-spored asci with two
white and two black spores were observed, suggesting that the D667A mutation abolishes spore
killing. However, when the integrated Spok3 allele was ampliﬁed by PCR and sequenced, it appeared
that the allele presents a GAG to TAG mutation leading to a premature stop codon in position 282
(E282stop). This result is consistent with the observation that Spok3 D667A affects transformation
eﬃciency and is toxic. Moreover, we detected expression of Spok2 and Spok1 in monokaryotic
cultures (strains Wa63- and TD ), suggesting that Spok activity is not restricted to the sexual cycle
(Figure 1–Figure Supplement 2). No further attempts to insert the mutant allele at PaPKS1 were
made.
If toxicity of the Spok3 D667A allele in vegetative cells is mechanistically related to spore
killing, it is expected that this toxicity should be suppressed by wt Spok3. Therefore, we assessed
whether Spok3 D667A toxicity in vegetative cells is suppressed by co-expression with wt Spok3.
Co-transformation experiments were set up with Spok3 D667A used as the transformation vector in
the presence or absence of wt Spok3. As in the previous experiment, Spok3 D667A alone was found
to affect transformation eﬃciency, but this effect was suppressed in co-transformations with Spok3
(Figure 4–source data 2). This experiment conﬁrms that Spok3 D667A is only toxic in the absence of
Spok3. Therefore, the Spok-related killing and resistance activities can be recapitulated in vegetative
cells.
We also analyzed the role of the conserved cysteine cluster just upstream of the kinase domain.
Three strains with point mutations in that region were constructed (a C493A C497A double mutant
and C511A and C511S point mutants) and the mutant alleles were used in transformation assays
as previously described for Spok3 D667A. All three mutants reduced transformation eﬃciencies
as compared to the controls and this effect was suppressed in co-transformations with wt Spok3
(Figure 4–source data 2). These results suggest that the kinase domain and the cysteine-cluster
region are both required for Spok-related resistance function but not for the killing activity. To
test this, we constructed a truncated allele of Spok3 which lacks these two regions: Spok3(1–490)
(see Figure 5–Figure Supplement 1). The Spok3(1–490) allele drastically reduced transformation
eﬃciencies and this effect was suppressed in co-transformations with wt Spok3 (Figure 4–source
data 2). If, as proposed here, the toxicity and suppression activities assayed in vegetative cells are
mechanistically related to spore killing, then domain 3 appears to be required for the resistance
function but dispensable for the killing activity which can be carried out by the N-terminal region of

the SPOK3 protein (domains 1 and 2).
Next we analyzed the role of the predicted nuclease domain (domain 2) in spore killing activity. We generated a point mutant affected for the predicted catalytic core lysine residue (K240A).
Introduction of this point mutation in the Spok3(1–490) allele abolished its killing activity in transformation assays (Figure 4–source data 2) suggesting that the nuclease domain is required for
killing activity. The Spok3 K240A mutant was then inserted at the PaPKS1 locus and the resulting
knock-in strain was crossed with a ΔSpok2 strain (to assay killing) and to a Spok3::PaPKS1d strain
(to assay resistance) (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 2M and N). In the cross to ΔSpok2, no killing
was observed: the majority of the asci were four-spored with two white and two black spores
(308/379, 81.2%) indicating that the K240A mutation abolishes spore-killing activity of Spok3. In
the Spok3 K240D::PaPKS1 x Spok3::PaPKS1d cross, no killing was observed: the majority of the asci
were four-spored with two white and two black spores (268/308, 87%). These crosses indicate that
the Spok3 K240A allele has lost killing ability but it has retained resistance. Grognet et al. (2014)
reported that strain A bears a mutant allele of Spok2 affected for killing but retaining resistance.
The mutations in that allele fall in a conserved region of the nuclease domain (Figure 5) and map
on predicted structural models in close vicinity of the catalytic lysine residue (K240 in SPOK3) and
the other catalytic residues (Figure 5–Figure Supplement 2). Properties of the Spok2 allele of strain
A provide independent evidence that the nuclease domain of SPOK proteins is involved in killing
activity but dispensable for resistance.

Phylogenetic distribution of Spok genes
A search for closely related homologs of the Spoks across fungi reveals no closely related proteins
among other members of the Sordariales. However, numerous species in the Hypocreales possess
homologs, many of which have more than one putative copy per genome (Figure 6). Proteins
with high similarity can also be found across other orders of the Sordariomycetes, namely the
Xylariales and Glomerellales, as well as in one species of the Eurotiomycetes, Polytolypa hystricis
(Onygenales). A maximum likelihood analysis of these sequences produced a phylogeny that
can be robustly divided into two clades, one of which contains the NECHA_82228 sequence from
Nectria haematococca (Clade I), and the other which contains the Podospora Spok homologs (Clade
II) (Figure 6). NECHA_82228 was previously introduced into P. anserina, and the genetically modiﬁed
strain produced empty asci when mated to a naïve strain, suggesting that it has a killing action
(Grognet et al., 2014). Note that the sequences in Clade I are present in single copies per strain,
except for Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi, suggesting that they are all orthologs and hence, that
the rate of gene duplications are low in this group. In contrast, many of the sequences in Clade
II are present in multiple copies per strain. It is particularly notable how many Spok homologs
are present in F. oxysporum and the number of copies that are found in each genome. Several of
the duplicate Spok homologs are present on the lineage speciﬁc chromosomes of Fusarium that
are often associated with pathogenicity (Armitage et al., 2018). The insect pathogens Metarhizium
rileyi and Cordyceps fumosorea exhibit a number of divergent copies of Spok homologs with three
and ﬁve copies respectively. This is in stark contrast to Pseudomassariella vexata and Hirsutella
minnesotensis that have multiple, though nearly identical copies. The Clade II Spok homologs appear
to diversify within each strain/species in much the same way as the Spok genes do in Podospora,
with variable lengths of the coil-coil repeat region and frameshift mutations that relocate the stop
codon. A few of the sequences may also represent pseudogenes as evident by premature stop
codons and/or frameshifts, although this might also be the result of unidentiﬁed introns (Figure 6
and Figure 6–source data 1).

Discussion
The identiﬁcation of Spok3 and Spok4 has allowed us to explain the genomic basis for ﬁve of the
seven Psk spore killer types found in natural populations of P. anserina. By our integrative approach
of genomics, molecular biology and phenotyping, we have been able to demonstrate that the
multiple drive elements genetically identiﬁed in P. anserina are not based on different underlying
molecular mechanisms and/or speciﬁc gene interactions, but rather involve combinations of closely
related driver genes belonging to the same Spok gene family. The Spok genes thus appear to be
responsible for all identiﬁed drive elements in Podospora, with the exception of the het-s spore
killing system.

The Spok Block
The presence of the complex Spok block presents a unique feature among the known meiotic
drive systems. Often, meiotic drive elements occupy regions of suppressed recombination that
span large tracts of chromosomes (Turner and Perkins, 1979; Hammer et al., 1989; Sandler et al.,
1959) and co-occur with complex rearrangements (Harvey et al., 2014; Silver, 1993; Dyer et al.,
2007; Svedberg et al., 2018). In these well-studied cases the elements of the drive mechanisms
are encoded by separate genes within the region, and the rearrangements and suppression of
recombination is expected to have evolved to ensure that the drive machinery (eg. the toxin and
antitoxin genes) is inherited as one unit (Lyttle, 1991; Bravo Núñez et al., 2018). In Podospora, a
single Spok gene is fully capable of driving, thus no region of suppressed recombination is required.
Nevertheless, Spok3 and Spok4 are found in a large region that is not syntenic with the null allele.
Hence, had the Spok genes not been previously identiﬁed from more placid genomic regions, the
entire Spok block may have been misidentiﬁed as a driving haplotype with multiple interacting
components. Considering that single-gene meiotic drivers might be more common than anticipated,
it becomes necessary to question whether other drive systems located within complex regions and
for which the genetics are not well known may also represent single gene drivers.
The relationship among the Spoks can provide insight as to the evolutionary history of the Spok
block. The observation that Spok3 and Spok4 are both present in the Spok block in a duplicate
region suggest that these represent homologs that formed via duplication. However, this scenario is
contradicted by the ﬁnding that Spok4 shares many features with Spok1 of P. comata, yet not Spok3.
It is possible that past hybridization between P. anserina and P. comata resulted in a transfer of Spok4
to P. comata and that this gene has since diverged to become Spok1. In such a case, subsequent
gene conversion between Spok3 and Spok4 would need to be invoked to explain certain features
like the shared frameshift variant at the end of the CDS. If instead one assumes that the invasion of
Spok4 into P. comata (or of Spok1 from P. comata to P. anserina) occurred prior to the duplication
event that produced Spok3 and Spok4, Spok3 would have to mutate at a much higher rate than Spok4
to explain the current pattern of divergence. Alternatively to duplication, Spok3 and Spok4 could be
the result of divergence between different populations and ended up in their current distribution
due to the fusion of two independent Spok blocks. Yet, another possible origin of Spok3 and/or
Spok4 may be from another close relative, P. pauciseta, a scenario supported by our ﬁnding that the
P. pauciseta strain CBS237.71 possess a Spok block with copies of both Spok3 and Spok4 that are
nearly identical to the P. anserina alleles. Noteworthy, all possible scenarios outlined above invoke
the introgression of Spok genes between species, most likely via hybridizations. Such interspecies
interactions mediating the introgression of meiotic drive genes between species would not be a
unique phenomenon to Spok genes of Podospora, as meiotic drive genes in Drosophila have been
observed to cross species boundaries and erode barriers of reproduction (Meiklejohn et al., 2018).
Further analyses of the genomes of populations of multiple Podospora species is needed in order
to resolve the history of the Spok genes and the block.

At this stage, our data strongly suggest that the Spok block is moving in the genomes as a unit,
but nevertheless, the mechanism of movement remains unknown. It may be hypothesized that
movement of the block is achieved via an interaction with TEs at different genomic locations and
non-allelic homologous recombination. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the
Spok genes outside of the Spok block, including SpokΨ1, are not located at the same position in the
different species, and that they are often surrounded by similar TEs. Such movement may be under
selection as matings between strains that have the same Spok genes but in different locations will
result in spore killing. Furthermore, due to the idiosyncrasies of meiosis in Podospora, the position
of the block may be under selection as the killing frequency is dependent on the frequency of
crossing over with the centromere. Alternatively, the TEs may simply accumulate around the Spok
genes because of a reduced eﬃcacy of purifying selection at regions linked to the driver genes and
that their presence per se increases the chance of rearrangements. As such, the role that TEs play in
generating complex regions associated with meiotic drive should be investigated further in order to
determine their importance to the evolution of drive.

Molecular function of the Spoks
Spore killing systems display analogies to toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacteria and it is interesting
to note that many toxin families rely on nuclease activity (Harms et al., 2018). The contrast between
our system and TA systems, however, resides in the fact that Spok toxin and antitoxin activities
appear to be supported by the same protein molecule. While it is premature to propose a model
for the molecular basis of Spok-gene drive, it can be stated that the kinase activity is able to
counter the toxic activity of the nuclease domain of the same protein. One may hypothesize
that autophosphorylation of the SPOK proteins relieves toxicity by inhibiting the nuclease activity.
Alternatively, it could be that it is the phosphorylation of a distinct macromolecule or metabolite
that nulliﬁes toxicity. This last hypothesis is supported by the fact that the kinase domain of SPOK
proteins resemble small molecule kinases more than protein kinases. In a simple model, the
same molecule could be the target of both the kinase and nuclease activity. One can for instance
imagine that the phosphorylation of the target would make it recalcitrant to the toxic action of
the nuclease domain. All killing models have to explain why the proposed inhibitory activity of the
kinase domain occurs only in spores bearing the Spok gene, yet suicidal point mutations can be
rescued in trans (Grognet et al., 2014). The kinase and nuclease activity of the SPOK proteins might
be differentially concentration-dependent, with the kinase activity favored at high SPOK-protein
concentrations presumably occurring only in spores expressing the Spok gene. Alternatively, the
possibility for kinase activity to protect against toxic activity of the nuclease domain might be
temporally constrained during ascospore maturation so that spores exposed to SPOK proteins
later in development (those not bearing Spok genes) might not beneﬁt from the protective action.
In addition to the yet unresolved mechanistic basis of killing and resistance, the characterization
of the Spok gene function described here poses another puzzle. Since all SPOK products have an
active kinase, it is not yet known what changes in sequence confer the hierarchical interactions
among some Spok genes or why not all SPOKs are able to provide resistance to one another. One
possibility is that the cellular targets for the nuclease and kinase activity differ for the different
SPOK proteins.
The coil-coiled domain is likely involved in protein-protein interactions, based on studies of
similar protein domains (van Maldegem et al., 2015). The fact that Spok1 and Spok4 have the
same length repeat in this domain could imply that protein-protein interactions of this domain
are important for resistance, as Spok1 and Spok4 are mutually resistant. This model would agree
somewhat with the results of reporter constructs from Grognet et al. (2014) that showed an Nterminal mCherry tag on Spok2 produced empty asci. As the adjacent unknown domain has
signatures of positive selection, it is possible that the functional divergence observed between the

SPOK proteins is due to mutations in this portion of the protein. In this model, domain 1 might
be responsible for target speciﬁcity of the nuclease (and kinase) activity. The killing action itself is
expected to be universal among the Spoks and is supported by the fact that this entire domain of
Spok3 from TG is identical to Spok4, yet appears to retain Spok3 functionality. The identiﬁcation of
the role of the nuclease domain in killing and of the kinase domain in resistance provides a ﬁrst
mechanistic insight into the dual role of Spoks. However, further dissection of the molecular action
of these proteins is required to fully understand the molecular basis of Spok drive.

Absence of resistance
One of the main factors that stands out in the Podospora system as compared to the other well
studied spore killers is the lack of resistant strains. Only one strain of P. anserina (strain A) has
ever been described as resistant (Grognet et al., 2014). The point mutations of Spok3 induced
in the laboratory imply that it is trivial to create a resistant strain, since only a single nucleotide
change was required. Likewise, the resistant strain A Spok2 is different from the reference allele
only by two novel insertions. As such, the lack of resistance does not appear to be the result of a
mechanistic constraint. Potentially, the current Spok gene distribution could be a relatively young
phenomenon and resistance could evolve over time. Another possibility is that resistance itself is
somehow costly to the organism and selected against. Additionally, it is puzzling that none of the
Spoks in P. anserina show cross resistance. Intuitively, it would seem advantageous for novel Spok
homologs to evolve new killing functions while maintaining resistance to the other Spok homologs.
Again, the lack of cross-resistance does not solely appear to be the result of functional constraints,
as Spok1, which is highly similar to Spok4, is resistant to all other Spok homologs. It is possible
that it is more advantageous to combine multiple independent spore killers than to have a single
broadly resistant gene. This option is supported by two observations presented in this study: the
occurrence of the killing hierarchy and the association of Spok3 and Spok4. The fact that Spok3 and
Spok4 are present in the Spok block means that they are in tight linkage with each other. It may
be the case that the linkage was selected for because it provided strains with the ability to drive
against strains with just Spok3 or just Spok4. However, this association could also be simply the
result of a duplication without invoking selection. Whether the killing hierarchy we observe in P.
anserina is due to a complex battle among the Spok homologs or a result of the existence of the
Spok block will require further experimentation and mathematical modeling to resolve.

Evolutionary dynamics of the Spoks
Some interesting aspects of meiotic drive in Podospora identiﬁed herein bears numerous parallel
features to the wtf genes that are responsible for drive in S. pombe. There is no sequence similarity
or conserved domains between the Spok and wtf genes, and Podospora and Schizosaccharomyces
are only distantly related (~500 million years diverged) (Wang et al., 2009; Prieto and Wedin, 2013).
Yet these systems display similar evolutionary dynamics within their respective species. Both of
these systems are built of multiple members of gene families, that appear to duplicate, rapidly
diverge to the point where they no longer show cross reactions (potentially with the aid of gene
conversion), and then pseudogenize and become nonfunctional (Bravo Núñez et al., 2018; Hu
et al., 2017; Nuckolls et al., 2017). Both systems also have close associations with TEs (Bowen
et al., 2003). Hu et al. (2017) invoke LTR-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination as a
possible mechanism for wtf gene deletion in a lab strain of S. pombe. While we provide evidence for
the deletion of Spok2, it does not ﬁt with expectation for being LTR-mediated, but as TEs are still
accumulating in the region, other TE related processes may have been involved in the deletion.

species are the rates of gene duplication and loss, and time since origin. In the case of the Spok
genes, we expect a low rate of deletion as they approach ﬁxation, due to the dikaryotic nature of
Podospora. Speciﬁcally, when ﬁrst appearing, a deletion is only expected to be present in one of
the two separate nuclear genomes maintained within a dikaryon. Any selﬁng event should erase
(i.e. drive against) the deletion, meaning that in order to become homoallelic for a deletion, the
strain would have to outcross with another individual with no Spoks or different Spoks from itself.
Such outcrossing could allow deletions of Spok3 and Spok4, but as Spok2 is nearly ﬁxed in the
population, any outcrosses event should also lead to the deletion being eliminated by the driving
action of Spok2. A possible solution to the paradoxical ﬁnding that Spok2 appears to have been
lost occasionally is that the incomplete penetrance of Spok2 may have allowed spores that were
homoallelic for the deletion to survive and persist. In this sense, Spok2 ﬁts the wtf model of driver
turn over well, wherein it is beginning to lose killing function after becoming ﬁxed in the population.
SpokΨ1 is missing the portion of the gene responsible for killing and the small Spok fragment of P.
comata also corresponds to the resistance part of the gene. Both these observations suggest the
killing domain may have been lost prior to these genes becoming fully pseudogenized and hints
that they may have functioned as resistance genes.
It has been pointed out that spore killing may be a weak form of meiotic drive, since the
transmission advantage is relative to the number of spores produced in a given cross, but there
is no absolute increase at the population level (Lyttle, 1991). Hence, a spore killer requires an
additional ﬁtness advantage to reach ﬁxation in a population (Nauta and Hoekstra, 1993). It is thus
striking that Spok2 is close to ﬁxation in at least the French and Dutch populations, bringing into
question the direct ﬁtness effects of the Spok genes. On the other hand, the Spok block (and hence
Spok3 and Spok4) seems to be in relatively low frequency. It is possible that the rate at which the
Spok block switches position is higher than the rate at which the Spoks can sweep to ﬁxation. As
such, the dynamics of Spok genes within the Spok block might differ from the Spok2/wtf life-cycle
and may explain why spore killing is observed to be polymorphic in P. anserina. Additionally, P.
anserina is capable of selﬁng, which may slow down the rate of ﬁxation of the genes. Moreover, the
vegetative and/or sexual expression of Spok genes might be deleterious in itself, and hence natural
selection might be increasing or maintaining the frequency of strains without all Spok homologs.
Overall, this complex system requires population genetic modelling to resolve the factors affecting
the frequency of the Spok genes in populations of this fungus.

Evolutionary history of the Spok gene family
Looking more broadly at Spok genes across fungi for which genome sequences exist, it is rather
interesting that Spok homologs are found in closely related orders, but not in other species of
the Sordariales. This ﬁnding suggest that the Spok genes are transferred horizontally among
evolutionarily disparate groups. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the eurotiomycete
Polytolypa hystricis possesses a closely related homolog to the Podospora Spoks. However, the
phylogeny presented here shows that the homologs that group with the Podospora Spoks do
generally agree with the known relationships among Sordariomycetes (Maharachchikumbura et al.,
2015), suggesting that the Spok genes could be ancestral to the Sordariomycetes, but lost in most
groups. Such a scenario would imply that there are long term consequences of possessing spore
killer genes, even if they are ﬁxed in the population.
Previously, proteins from Nectria haematococca and Fusarium verticillioides were identiﬁed as
close homologs of the SPOK proteins, and it was demonstrated that the Necha_82228 protein
induces spore abortion in synthetic knock-ins of P. anserina (Grognet et al., 2014). Based on
diversiﬁcation patterns, the phylogeny presented here suggests that the N. haematococca and
F. verticillioides sequences may represent orthologs that are conserved among the Hypocreales,

but do not represent meiotic drive genes since only one presumably orthologous copy is typically
found. In contrast, the numerous closely related Spok homologs in F. oxysporum suggest that these
genes could potentially be driving in this species. However, no sexual cycle has been observed
in F. oxysporum. Given that we demonstrate vegetative killing with Spok3, it is possible that the
Fusarium Spoks operate in vegetative tissue to ensure the maintenance of the pathogenic associated
chromosomes. Alternatively, as F. oxysporum strains have been found with both mating type alleles
(O’Donnell et al., 2004), there may be a cryptic sexual cycle in which the Spok homologs are active.

Conclusions

737

With this study, we have provided a robust connection between phenotype and genotype of spore
killing in P. anserina. We showed that meiotic drive in Podospora spp. is governed by genes of the
Spok family, a single locus drive system that confers both killing and resistance within a single
protein, which synergize to create hierarchical dynamics by the combination of homologs at different genomic locations. The Spok genes are prone to duplication, diversiﬁcation and movement in
the genome. Furthermore, our results indicate that they likely evolved via cross-species transfer,
highlighting potential risks with the release of synthetic gene drivers for biological control invading
non-target species. Moreover, we present evidence that homologs of the Spok genes might have
similar dynamics across other groups of fungi, including pathogenic strains of Fusarium. Taken together, the Spok system provides insight into how the genome can harbour numerous independent
elements enacting their own agendas and affecting the evolution of multiple taxa.

The fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and were obtained from the collection
maintained at the Laboratory of Genetics at Wageningen University (van der Gaag et al., 2000)
and the University of Bordeaux. Strains with the “Wa” identiﬁer were collected from the area
around Wageningen between 1991 and 2000 (Hermanns et al., 1995; van der Gaag et al., 1998,
2000). Strains S, Y, and Z were collected in France in 1937 (Rizet, 1952; Belcour et al., 1997). Strain
S is commonly used as a wild type reference, and an annotated genome (Espagne et al., 2008) is
publicly available at the Joint Genome Institute MycoCosm website (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/
programs/fungi/index.jsf) as “Podan2”. It remains unclear where exactly TD and TG were collected,
given the labelling confusion.
Representative strains for the Psk spore killer types from the Wageningen collection were
phenotyped to conﬁrm the interactions described by van der Gaag et al. (2000). Strains Wa87 and
Wa53 were selected as representative of the Psk-1 type, Wa28 for Psk-2, Wa21 for Psk-3, Wa46 for
Psk-4, Y for Psk-5, Wa47 for Psk-6, and Wa58 for Psk-7. Strains S and Wa63 were used as reference
strains and are annotated as Psk-S. Strain Wa58 mated poorly in general, so strain Z was used as
a mating tester for the Psk-7 spore killer type as well. For all crossing experiments and genome
sequencing, we isolated self-sterile monokaryons (i.e., haploid strains containing only one nuclear
type) from spontaneously produced 5-spored asci (Rizet and Engelmann, 1949), identiﬁed their
mating type (mat+ or mat-) by crossing them to tester strains, and annotated them with +/- signs
accordingly.

Culture and crossing conditions

770

All crosses were performed on Petri-dishes with Henks Perfect barrage medium (HPM). This media
is a modiﬁed recipe of PASM2 agar (van Diepeningen et al. 2008), where 𝟧 𝗀 𝖫−𝟣 of dried horse dung
are added prior to autoclaving. Strains were ﬁrst grown on solid minimal medium, PASM0.2. For
each cross, a small area of mycelia of each of two monokaryons was excised from the plates and
transferred to HPM. Perithecia (fruiting bodies) form at the interface between sexually compatible
mat+ and mat- monokaryons. Mature perithecia with fully developed ascospores were harvested
after 8 – 11 days from which the percentage of 2-spored asci were evaluated to determine the killing
percentage (Box 1). All cultures were incubated at 𝟤𝟩 ◦𝖢 under 70% humidity for a 12:12 light/dark
cycle. Barrage formation was also evaluated on HPM, whereby confrontations between mycelia of
two different strains will produce a visible line of dead cells if they are vegetatively incompatible, for
details see (van der Gaag, Debets, and Hoekstra 2003).

In order to generate high molecular weight DNA suitable for sequencing using PacBio, eight strains
were grown on PASM0.2 for 5 – 7 days (Table 1). The agar with mycelium was cut into small
pieces and used as inoculum for ﬂasks containing 𝟤𝟢𝟢 𝗆𝖫 3% malt extract solution, which were
then incubated on a shaker for 10 – 14 days at 𝟤𝟩 ◦𝖢. The mycelia was ﬁltered from the ﬂasks, cut

DNA was extracted using Genomic Tip G-500 columns (Qiagen) and cleaned using the PowerClean
DNA Clean-Up kit (MoBio Labs). The cleaned DNA was sequenced at the Uppsala Genome Center
(SciLifeLab, Uppsala, Sweden) using the PacBio RSII platform (Paciﬁc Biosciences). For each sample,

We generated transcriptomic data from dikaryotic strains that undergo spore killing during selﬁng.
The S14 backcrosses (see below) were mated to the strain S in order to obtain killer heteroallelic
spores (from 4-spore asci) that were dissected from ripe fruiting bodies (see Figure 1–Figure
Supplement 2). The spores were germinated in plates of PASM2 with 𝟧 𝗀 𝖫−𝟣 ammonium acetate
added. Two days after germination, the culture was stored in PASM0.2 media at 𝟦 ◦𝖢 to arrest
growth. From that stock, we inoculated HPM plates with either a polycarbonate Track Etched 𝟩𝟨 𝗆𝗆
𝟢.𝟣 µ𝗆 membrane disk (Poretics, GVS Life Sciences, USA)(Psk1xS5 and Psk7xS5 ) or a cellophane
layer (Psk2x5 and Psk5x5 ) on top. The mycelium was grown for ~11 days and harvested for RNA
extraction when the ﬁrst spores were shot into the plate lid, ensuring several stages of fruiting
body development. Note that P. anserina starts to degrade cellophane after ~6 days, and therefore
the polycarbonate membrane allows for longer growing periods. Spore killing was independently
conﬁrmed on HPM plates inoculated without a membrane. Additionally, in order to improve gene
annotation, we grew the strains Wa63- and TD + on a cellophane layer on HPM for 11 and 7 days,
respectively, to capture transcripts occurring during the monokaryotic phase.

The harvested mycelium was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −𝟪𝟢 ◦𝖢 until
RNA extraction. Next, 𝟣𝟧𝟢 𝗆𝗀 of frozen tissue were ground under liquid nitrogen and total RNA was
extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quality of RNA was checked on
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). All RNA samples were treated with DNaseI
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library
Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). The mRNA was selected by purifying polyA+ transcripts
(NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module, New England Biolabs). Finally, paired-end
libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the SNP&SEQ Technology platform.

For both DNA and RNA Illumina HiSeq reads, adapters were identiﬁed with cutadapt v. 1.13
(Martin, 2011) and then trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) with the options
ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fasta:1:30:9 LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:30.
Only ﬁltered reads with both forward and reverse were kept for downstream analyses. For shortread mapping, we used BWA v. 0.7.17 (Li and Durbin, 2010) with PCR duplicate marking of Picard v.
2.18.11 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), followed by local indel re-aligning implemented in
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v. 3.7 (Van der Auwera et al., 2013). Mean depth of coverage
was calculated with QualiMap v.2.2 (Okonechnikov et al., 2016).
The raw PacBio reads were ﬁltered and assembled with the SMRT Analysis package and the
HGAP 3.0 assembler (Chin et al., 2013). The resulting assembly was error-corrected (polished) with
Pilon v. 1.17 (Walker et al., 2014) using the mapped ﬁltered Illumina reads of the same strain. The
samples sequenced with MinION were assembled using Minimap2 v. 2.11 (Li, 2018) and Miniasm

v. 0.2 (Li, 2016), polished twice with Racon v. 1.3.1 (Vaser et al., 2017) using theMinION reads, and
further polished for ﬁve consecutive rounds of Pilon v. 1.22 using the Illumina reads as above.
Additionally, DNA Illumina reads were assembled de novo for each sample using SPAdes v. 3.12.0
(Bankevich et al., 2012; Antipov et al., 2015) using the k-mers 21,33,55,77 and the –careful option.
Assemblies were evaluated using QUAST v. 4.6.3 (Mikheenko et al., 2016). Scaffolds were assigned
chromosome numbers based on homology with Podan2. BLAST searches of the scaffolds in the
ﬁnal assembly of the strain CBS237.71 revealed contamination by a Methylobacterium sp. in the
MinION data (but not in the Illumina data set). The scaffolds matching the bacterium were removed
from the analysis.
The assembly of the Spok block was visually inspected by mapping the long reads (using Minimap2) and the short reads (BWA) as above into the long-read polished assemblies. Since the
MinION assemblies maintain some degree of sequencing error at repetitive regions that cannot be
conﬁdentially polished, we also assembled both types of reads into a hybrid assembly using SPAdes
(same options as above) and, whenever different on short indels or SNPs but fully assembled, the
sequence of the Spok genes was taken from the (low-error) hybrid assembly. The assembly of the
Spok block of the TG + strain was particularly challenging since the recovered MinION reads were
relatively short. However, a few (<10) reads were long enough to cover the tandem duplication that
contains Spok3 (albeit with high nucleotide error rate in the assembly). The hybrid SPAdes assembly
collapsed the duplication into a single copy. We therefore mapped the short reads into the hybrid
assembly, conﬁrming that the Spok3 gene had doubled coverage and no SNPs, as expected from a
perfect duplication.

Alignments of the assembled genomes were performed with the NUCmer script of the MUMmer
package v. 4.0.0beta2 (Kurtz et al., 2004) using options -b 200 -c 2000 -p –maxmatch. The ﬁgures
showing alignments of the Spok block and the Spok2 region (Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 2–Figure
Supplement 1) were generated by extracting the regions from each de novo assembly and aligning
them in a pairwise fashion using MUMmer as described above. The MUMmer output were then
visualized using a custom Python script.

For annotation, we opted for gene prediction trained speciﬁcally on P. anserina genome features.
We used the ab initio gene prediction programs GeneMark-ES v. 4.32 (Lomsadze et al., 2005;
Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008) and SNAP release 2013-06-16 (Korf, 2004). All the training process
was done on the sample Wa28-, for which all chromosomes were assembled (see Results). The
program GeneMark-ES was self-trained with the script gmes_petap.pl and the options –fungal
–max_intron 3000 –min_gene_prediction 120. SNAP was trained as instructed in the tutorial of
the MAKER pipeline v. 2.31.8 (Holt and Yandell, 2011), in (Campbell et al., 2014), and in the SNAP
README ﬁle. First, we use the Podan2 transcripts and protein models as sole evidence to infer
genes with MAKER (option est2genome=1) and then we had a ﬁrst round of SNAP training. The
resulting HMM ﬁle was used to re-run MAKER (est2genome=0) and to re-train SNAP, obtaining the
ﬁnal HMM training ﬁles.
A library of repetitive elements was constructed by collecting the reference P. anserina transposable elements described in Espagne et al. (2008) available in Genbank, and combining them with
the fungal portion of Repbase version 20170127 (Bao et al., 2015), as well as the Neurospora library
of Gioti et al. (2013). In order to produce transcript models we used STAR v. 2.6.1b (Dobin et al.,
2013) with maximum intron length of 1000 to map the RNAseq reads of all samples, followed by
processing with Cuﬄinks v. 2.2.1 (Trapnell et al., 2010). For the ﬁnal genome annotation, we used
MAKER v. 3.01.02 along with GeneMark-ES v. 4.33, SNAP release 2013-11-29, RepeatMasker v. 4.0.7

(http://www.repeatmasker.org/), BLAST suit 2.6.0+ (Camacho et al., 2009), Exonerate v. 2.2.0 (Slater
and Birney, 2005), and tRNAscan-SE v. 1.3.1 (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). After preliminary testing, we
chose the transcripts of Psk7xS14 (mapped to the PacBio assembly of Wa58-) and Wa63- (PacBio
assembly of the same strain) as EST evidence, and the Podan2 and TD (Silar et al., 2018) models as
protein evidence. The MAKER models of relevant regions were manually curated by comparing with
RNAseq mapping and coding sequences (CDS) produced with TransDecoder v. 5.5.0 (Haas et al.,
2013) on the Cuﬄinks models.
We used blastn to localize possible copies of Spok genes in all genome assemblies. The Spok2
(Pa_5_10) gene from Grognet et al. (2014) was selected as query. We named the new Spok genes
(Spok3 and Spok4) arbitrarily based on sequence similarity, as reﬂected in the Phylogenetic analyses
(see below). Note that the existence of Spok3 had previously been hypothesised by Grognet et al.
(2014), however no DNA sequence was provided. Moreover, the strain Y, in which they identiﬁed it,
contains both Spok3 and Spok4.

Introgressions of the Spore-killing loci
Backcrossed strains of the various spore killer phenotypes were generated through ﬁve recurrent
backcrosses to the reference strain S (S5 ) by van der Gaag et al. (2000). In the original study, the
strains selected as spore killer parents were Wa53+ for Psk-1, Wa28- for Psk-2, Y+ for Psk-5, and
Wa58- for Psk-7. The S5 strains are annotated as Wa170 (Psk-1), Wa130 (Psk-2), Wa200 (Psk-5), and
Wa180 (Psk-7) in the Wageningen Collection, however for the sake of clarity we refer to them as
Psk1xS5 , Psk2xS5 , Psk5xS5 , and Psk7xS5 .
We sequenced the S5 strains along with the reported parental strains using Illumina HiSeq
2500. We mapped the reads to Podan2 as described above, followed by SNP calling using the
HaplotypeCaller pipeline of GATK (options: -ploidy 1 -newQual -stand_call_conf 20.0). We removed sites that had missing data, that overlapped with repeated elements as deﬁned by RepeatMasker, or where all samples were different from the reference genome, using VCFtools v.
0.1.16 (Danecek et al., 2011), BEDtools v. 2.27.1 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010), and BCFtools v. 1.9
(Danecek and McCarthy, 2017), respectively. We plotted the density of ﬁltered SNPs across the
genome with the R packages vcfR (Knaus and Grünwald, 2016) and poppr (Knaus and Grünwald,
2016; Kamvar et al., 2015). A full Snakemake (Köster and Rahmann, 2018) pipeline can be found at
https://github.com/johannessonlab/SpokPaper. Notice that we sequenced both monokaryons of
our strain S to account for the mutations that might have had occurred since the separation of the
reference S strain in the laboratory of Espagne et al. (2008) and our S strain from the Wageningen
Collection. These mutations should be present in the backcrosses, but they are independent from
the spore killer elements.
Inspection of the introgressed tracks revealed that the variants of the backcross Psk1xS5 do not
match perfectly Wa53+ (the reported parent). Given that the Spok content is the same as Wa53+,
the introgressed track co-occurs with the expected position of the Spok block in chromosome 3, and
the fact that the phenotype of this backcross matches a Psk-1 spore-killer type, we concluded that
Wa170 (Psk1xS5 ) in the collection actually belongs to another of the Psk-1 backcrosses described in
the doctoral thesis of van der Gaag (2005), likely backcrossed from Wa52. Puzzling, an introgressed
track in the chromosome 3 of the Psk2xS5 strain does not match the expected parent (Wa28)
either, both in SNPs and het genes alleles (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 3). However, other tracks in
different chromosomes, including that of chromosome 5 where the Psk-2 Spok block can be found,
do match Wa28. Likewise, Psk2xS5 only has Spok2 and Spok3 copies like Wa28. Hence, we concluded
that our results are not affected by these inconsistencies.

As reported by van der Gaag et al. (2000), the S5 strains were generated by selecting ascospores
from 2-spored asci of crosses between S and the spore killer parent. This procedure ensures that
the offspring will be homozygous for alleles of the spore-killer parent from the spore killing locus
to the centromere (Box 1 and Figure 2–Figure Supplement 3). To eliminate as much background
as possible from the spore killer parents in the backcrossed strains, nine additional backcrosses
were conducted where ascospores were selected from 4-spored and 2-spored asci in alternating
generations. Ascospores from the ﬁnal generation were selected from 2-spored asci to ensure
the strains would be homozygous at the spore-killing locus. These strains are the result of 14
backcrosses to S (S14 ) and are annotated as Psk1xS14 , Psk2xS14 , Psk5xS14 , and Psk7xS14 . The S5 and
S14 strains were phenotyped by crossing the strains to their parents as well as other reference spore
killer strains to conﬁrm that the killing phenotypes remained unchanged after the backcrosses.

Knock-out of Spok2
To knock-out Spok2, a 459 bp and a 495 bp fragment ﬂanking the Spok2 ORF downstream and
upstream were obtained by PCR and cloned ﬂanking the hph gene in the SKhph plasmid as blunt
end fragments in a EcoRV site and a SmaI site. The deletion cassette was then ampliﬁed by PCR
and used to transform a ΔKu70 strain (El-Khoury et al., 2008). Five transformants were screened
for integration of the hph marker at Spok2 by PCR and crossed to s. To purify the ΔSpok2 nuclei,
a heterokaryotic binucleated ΔSpok2/Spok2 spore was recovered in a 2-spored ascus and use to
fertilize the initial ΔSpok2 transformant (which may or may not be heterokaryotic). Uninucleated
hygR resistant spores were then recovered from this cross.

Construction of a disruption cassette to insert Spok3 or Spok4 in the PaPKS1 locus
To replace the ORF of the centromere-linked Pa_2_510 (PaPKS1) gene by one of the Spok3 or
Spok4 genes (see Results), a disruption cassette was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment
corresponding to the 700 bp upstream region of the PaPKS1 ORF was ampliﬁed with oligonucleotides 5’ tcgccgcggGCTAGGGGGTACTGATGGG 3’ and 5’ cacgcggccgcCTTGGAAGCCTGTTGACGG
3’ (capital letters correspond to P. anserina genomic DNA sequences) and cloned in SKpBluescript
vector (Stratagene) containing the nourseothricin-resistance gene Nat in the EcoRV site (vector
named P1) using the SacII/NotI restriction enzymes (upstream from the Nat gene) to produce
the P1UpstreamPKS1 vector. Then the 770 bp downstream of the PaPKS1 ORF was ampliﬁed
with oligonucleotides 5’ tcgaagcttACAACAGTCATACGAACATG 3’ and 5’ gcggtcgacGGTACAATACGCCCTCAGTG 3’ and cloned in the P1UpstreamPKS1 vector using the HindIII/SalI restriction enzymes
(downstream from the Nat gene) to produce the P1UpstreamDownstreamPKS1 vector. Finally the
Spok3 and Spok4 genes were ampliﬁed respectively from the Wa28 strain with oligonucleotides
5’ tcggcggccgcCACAGGAGCAGAGCTACGAC 3’ and 5’ gcgtctagaATATTTGGGTACTTGGCGGC 3’ and
from the Wa87 strain with oligonucleotides 5’ tcggcggccgcCACAGGAGCAGAGCTACGAC 3’ and 5’
gcgtctagaCAAGGTGCCCGTGGAGTAAG 3’ and cloned in the P1UpstreamDownstreamPKS1 vector
using the NotI/XbaI restriction enzymes (between PaPKS1 upstream region and Nat gene) to produce
the P1UpstreamDownstreamPKS1_Spok3 or the P1UpstreamDownstreamPKS1_Spok4 vector so
that the Spok3/Spok4 and Nat genes are ﬂanked by the upstream and downstream regions of
PaPKS1 ORF to allow PaPKS1 ORF replacement by homologous recombination. The Spok3 and
Spok4 ampliﬁed Spok genes contain the ORFs ﬂanked with 983 bp upstream the start codon and
460 bp downstream the stop codon for Spok3, and 984 bp upstream the start codon and 393
bp downstream the stop codon for Spok4, allowing expression of Spok genes using their native
promoter and terminator regions. The disruption cassette were then ampliﬁed from the ﬁnal
vectors using the most distal oligonucleotides 5’ tcgccgcggGCTAGGGGGTACTGATGGG 3’ and 5’
gcggtcgacGGTACAATACGCCCTCAGTG 3’ and named PKS1::Spok3_nat-1 and PKS1::Spok4_nat-1.

P. anserina ΔSpok2 (ΔPa_5_10) strain was obtained after disruption of the gene Pa_5_10 and
replacement of its ORF with the hygromycin-resistance gene hph in a ΔKu70 strain. This strain was
used as recipient strain for the disruption cassettes. We used 𝟧 𝗎𝗅 of the cassettes for transfection
and Nourseothricin resistant transformants were selected. As expected, most of the transformants
were unpigmented and corresponded to insertion of Spok3 or Spok4 by replacement of PaPKS1.
Gene replacement was veriﬁed by PCR.

Prediction of unstructured regions was performed in SPOK3 with PrDOS with a 2% false positive
setting (Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007). Coiled-coil prediction was performed with LOGICOIL (Vincent et al., 2012), CCHMM_PROF (Bartoli et al., 2009) and Multicoil2 (Wolf et al., 1997). Domain
prediction was performed using Gremlin (Balakrishnan et al., 2011) and RaptorX contact predict
(Ma et al., 2015). Conserved residues were identiﬁed using Weblogo 3 (Crooks et al., 2004) with a
Gremlin generated alignment as input. Domain identiﬁcation was done with HHPred (Zimmermann
et al., 2018).
In order to compare the diversity at the nucleotide level with the protein models, we calculated
the average pairwise nucleotide differences (Nei and Li, 1979) for each bi-allelic site (correcting by
the number of sites (n/(n - 1)) while ignoring sites with gaps) on a Spok alignment (see below), using
overlapping windows of 100 bp and steps of 20 bp. This was performed on a selected representative
of each Spok homolog (Spok2 of S, Spok3 and Spok4 of Wa87, and Spok1 from TD ), or for all the
alleles of each Spok within the P. anserina strains.
Values of dN /dS were calculated using the seqinr package in R (Charif and Lobry, 2007). Alignments were manually trimmed to calculate separate values for each domain. Tests of sequence
evolution were conducted with paml 4.8 (Yang, 2007) using a star phylogeny of the Spok sequences.

Phylogenetic analyses
The ﬁnal gene models of all the Spok genes in Podospora spp. were aligned along with the sequences
of Spok2 and Spok1 from Grognet et al. (2014) using MAFFT online version 7 (Katoh et al., 2017)
with default settings (only one copy of Spok3 from TG was used). The resulting alignment was
manually corrected taking into account the reading frame of the protein. Since the UTRs seem to be
conserved between paralogs, 654 (5’ end) and 250 (3’ end) bps of the ﬂanking regions with respect to
Spok2 were also included in the alignment. An unrooted split network was constructed in SplitsTree4
v. 4.14.16, build 26 Sep 2017 (Huson and Bryant, 2006) with a NeighborNet (Bryant and Moulton,
2002) distance transformation (uncorrected distances), and an EqualAngle splits transformation.
SplitsTree4 was used likewise to perform a Phi test for recombination (Bruen et al., 2006) using a
windows size of 100 and k = 6. Additionally, we used the BlackBox of RAxML-NG v. 0.6.0 (Kozlov
et al., 2018) to infer Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide alignment of the 5’
UTR, the coding sequence (CDS), and the 3’ UTR of the Spok homologs. We ran RAxML-NG with 10
parsimony and 10 random starting trees, a GTR + GAMMA (4 categories) substitution model, and
100 bootstrap pseudo-replicates for each analysis.
In order to create a phylogeny of proteins closely related to the Spok genes in Podospora (and
hence likely to be meiotic drivers), the protein sequence of Spok1 was used as a query against the
NCBI genome database. We collated all hits with e-values lower than Necha2_82228, which has
been shown to have some spore killing functionality in P. anserina previously (Grognet et al., 2014),
with hit coverage greater than 75%, and no missing data (Ns) in the sequence. The sequences were
aligned using the codon-aware program MACSE v. 2.03 (Ranwez et al., 2018), with the representative

Podospora Spoks set as “reliable” sequences (-seq), and the rest as “non reliable” (-seq_lr). Many
of the original gene models predict introns in the sequences, however no divergent regions were
apparent in the alignment and, even if present, MACSE tends to introduce compensatory frame
shifts. As such the entire gene alignment was used for the analysis. The resulting nucleotide
alignment was corrected manually, translated into amino acids, and trimmed with TrimAl v. 1.4.1
(Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009) using the -gappyout function. A Maximum likelihood tree was then
produced using IQ-TREE v. 1.6.8 (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2015) with extended
model selection (-m MFP) and 1000 standard bootstrap pseudo-replicates. The protein sequence
UV8b_5543 of Ustilaginoidea virens was selected as outgroup based on a BioNJ tree made with
SeaView v. 4.5.4 (Gouy et al., 2010) of the Gremlin alignment described above.

Pool-sequencing of Psk-1 vs Psk-5 progeny
In order to conﬁrm that Spok2 is responsible of the killing between Psk-5 and Psk-1, we conducted a
cross between the strains Wa87 and Y. When perithecia started shooting spores, we replaced the
lid of the cross plate with a water-agar plate upside-down, and let it sit for around an hour. Since
P. anserina spores from a single ascus are typically landing together, it is possible to distinguish
spores that came from an ascus with no killing (groups of four spores) from those that had killing
(groups of two). To improve germination rates, we scooped spore groups of the same ascus type
and deposited them together in a single plate of germination medium. After colonies became
visible, they were transferred into a PASM2 plate with a cellophane layer where they grew until DNA
extraction, followed by pool-sequencing with Illumina HiSeq X. In total 21 2-spore groups, and 63
4-spore groups were recovered.

1054

The resulting short reads were quality controlled and mapped to Podan2 as above. We used
GATK to call variants from the parental strains (treated as haploid) and the two pool-sequencing
databases (as diploids). We then extracted SNPs, removed sites with missing data, and attempted
to quantify the coverage frequency of the parental genotypes for each variant. The expectation
was that spore-killing (2-spore asci) would result in a long track of homozygosity (only one parental
genotype) around Spok2, as compared to the fully heterozygous 4-spore asci. A full Snakemake
pipeline is available at https://github.com/johannessonlab/SpokPaper.

Appendix 1

The biology of Podospora
The life cycle of P. anserina is an important factor to consider when discussing the meiotic
drive of the Spok genes. Although it has haploid nuclei, P. anserina maintains a dikaryotic
(n+n) state throughout its entire lifecycle. Haploid nuclei of different mating-type are shown
as white and black circles within fungal cells. The fruiting body (perithecium) is generated
from dikaryotic (n+n) mycelia, usually from a single individual strain. Within the perithecium,
the sexual cycle is completed to produce four dikaryotic ascospores per ascus. Occasionally,
atypical spore formation may occur and result in the production of ﬁve spores in an ascus, of
which two are small and monokaryotic (n). These are self-sterile and need to outcross either
with a monokaryotic individual of the opposite mating type or with a dikaryotic individual to
complete the life cycle. Note that outcrossing may occur via mating between either siblings
or unrelated individuals of the opposite mating type. The monokaryotic spores are useful
for generating self-sterile (haploid) cultures for the purposes of sequencing and laboratory
mating. This intricate lifecycle is maintained by a strict meiotic process.

Appendix 1 Figure 1. Simpliﬁed life cycle of P. anserina.

Two-locus spore killing interaction
The interaction between Psk-1 and Psk-7 provides a good example of how the meiotic drive
dynamics of P. anserina result in killing even though both Psk-1 and Psk-7 possess the same
Spok homologs. The three Spok homologs (Spok2, Spok3, and Spok4) are all present in
both Psk-1 and Psk-7. The observed mutual resistance is thus due to the fact that the Spok
block (with Spok3 and Spok4) is located on different chromosomes. Because chromosomes
segregate independently at meiosis the expected killing percentage can be calculated as:
0.5 ∗ 𝑓 𝑘1 ∗ 𝑓 𝑘2 = 𝑓 𝑠𝑘

(1)

1375
1376
1377
1378
1379

where 0.5 is due to independent assortment of chromosomes, 𝑓 𝑘1 is the killing percentage
of strain 1, 𝑓 𝑘2 is the killing percentage of strain 2, and 𝑓 𝑠𝑘 is the spore killing frequency
observed between the two strains. For Psk-1 crossed to Psk-7 this equals 0.27. This agrees
well with the observed killing percentage of 23 – 27% (Figure 4–Figure Supplement 1).

Appendix 2

History of Spore killer research in Podospora
Throughout the history of spore killing research in Podospora, a number of observations
have been made along with corresponding hypotheses. The discovery of Spok3 and Spok4
provides us with the opportunity to reinterpret these data in light of the results presented
herein. Here we will address data from four important works: ((Padieu and Bernet, 1967;
van der Gaag et al., 2000, 2003; Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004).

Inconsistencies among the Psk designations
Our phenotyping is in accordance with the results of (van der Gaag et al., 2000) for strains
Wa28, Wa53, Wa58, Wa63, Wa87, S, and Z, while contradictions were observed for Wa21,
Wa46, Wa47, and Y. Strain Wa21 was previously categorized as Psk-3 which is typiﬁed by
inconsistent spore killing with Psk-S strains. Here we observed stable percentages and thus
consider Wa21 to be representative of Psk-2. The role of Psk-3 as a spore killer has been in
doubt since its description (van der Gaag et al., 2000). This is in part due to the fact that
ascospores are not fully aborted as for the other spore killer types. Instead small transparent
ascospores can still be observed within the ascus. Here we were unable to ﬁnd support for
this spore killer type and it has no clear correlation between its phenotype and any Spok
genes. We therefore ﬁnd it likely that the effect is due to other incompatibility factors rather
than meiotic drive.

1410

We did not observe any spore killing in crosses between Wa46 (Psk-4) and Wa47 (Psk-6)
as reported in van der Gaag 2000. Two other strains had been annotated as Psk-6, Wa89
and Wa90, but no other strains were recorded as Psk-4. Unfortunately we were not able
to phenotype these strains and so we are unable to evaluate Psk-6 further in this study.
In addition, results from crosses of Psk-4 with a Psk-S strain (Wa63) reveals that there is a
dominance interaction between them with Psk-S killing Psk-4, which is the opposite of what
was proposed in van der Gaag et al. (2000), i.e. that Psk-S kills Psk-4. Potentially, the original
interpretation was hindered by poor mating of the Psk-4 strain with tester Psk-S strains.
Previously, strain Y was reported to have mutual resistance with Psk-1, be susceptible to
Psk-7, and dominant over all other types. Here we report that Y is susceptible to Psk-1 and
Psk-7, and has mutual killing with all other types, except for crosses with naïve strains where
it is dominant.

As the het-s gene is capable of causing both vegetative incompatibility and spore killing, it
was hypothesized that the Psk loci may be as well. The S5 strains all demonstrate barrage
formation (symptomatic of vegetative incompatibility) with strain S (van der Gaag et al.,
2003). However when additional backcrosses were performed to generate S14 strains, no
barrages were observed (Figure 1). This indicates that the spore killing types do not directly
affect vegetative incompatibility or vice versa, but may be linked to loci which do. Note that
the S5 strains contain multiple genomic regions that are not isogenic with S, some of which
contain known allorecognition genes (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 3).

Appendix 2 Figure 1. Barrage tests of the S14 strains. Strains Wa126, Wa76, Wa52, and Wa125 are wild
isolates of P. anserina in the Wageningen collection. The thick white lines of mycelia demonstrate a
barrage, which is indicative of heterokaryotic incompatibility in fungi. No barrages are seen among the
S14 strains.

Incomplete penetrance of Spok2
To investigate the nature of the 3-spored asci, tetrad dissections were conducted with asci
from crosses between the Psk-S strains Wa63 and Us5, and the naïve strain Wa46. If the
3-spored asci were the result of a 4-spored ascus in which one of the spores aborted, all three
spores should be heteroallelic for Spok2. If the 3-spored asci are the result of incomplete
penetrance of the killing factor, two spores should be homoallelic for Spok2 while the other
spore should have no copy of Spok2. Unfortunately, spores from the crosses had very
low germination rates (1/15 for Wa63 x Wa46 and 1/12 for Us5 x Wa46) as compared to
other crosses (generally close to 100% germination). The progeny from the successfully
germinated spores were backcrossed to the parental strains and also allowed to self to infer
their Spok2 genotype. Crosses with the Wa63/Wa46 progeny revealed it to be homoallelic for
Spok2, and crosses with the Us5/Wa46 progeny revealed it to have no copy of Spok2. Both of
these observations are consistent with the hypothesis for incomplete penetrance of Spok2.

Strain T and the original reports of spore killing in Podospora
The strain T has featured prominently in a number of important publications on spore killing
in Podospora. It was one of the two strains investigated in the original description of spore
killing by Padieu and Bernet (1967) (translated and reinterpreted by Turner and Perkins
(1991)), it was the strain in which Spok1 was described Grognet et al. (2014), and it was part
of an investigation of spore killing in German strains of Podospora (Hamann and Osiewacz,
2004). Our results clearly demonstrate that two strains labeled as T ( TG and TD herein) are
not only different strains, but are differnt species. The description of spore killing in Padieu
and Bernet (1967) matches our observations of crosses between TG and the Psk-S strain
Wa63, including incomplete penetrance as implied by the presence of 3-spored asci. Thus,
we believe TG to be representative of the original T strain. In light of this, we reinterpret
the results of both Padieu and Bernet (1967) and Hamann and Osiewacz (2004) as per the
interactions of the Spok genes.

In Padieu and Bernet (1967), they describe a cross between two strains: T and T’. They
identify two genes (one present in T and the other in T’) which cause spore killing and interact
as mutual killers. The gene from T has a killing percentage of 90%, while the one from
T’ has a killing percentage of 40% and occasionally produces 3-spored asci. This ﬁts well
with a cross of Psk-5 and Psk-S where Psk-5 kills at 90% and Spok2 of the Psk-S strain kills
at 40%, but has incomplete penetrance resulting in 3-spored asci. Unfortunately strain T’
has to our knowledge not been maintained in any collections, so this cannot be conﬁrmed
experimentally. However, Psk-S strains are the most abundant phenotype from French,
German, and Dutch populations (T’ was isolated in France along with T) (van der Gaag et al.,
2000; Grognet et al., 2014; Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004).
In Hamann and Osiewacz (2004) they present a number of interesting observations. They
report a new spore killer type, identify progeny that appear to demonstrate gene conversion
of the killer locus, and observe apparent recombinant spore killer types. The study mostly
centres around strain O, which they report to be of the same spore killer type as TG and
should thus be Psk-5 given our results. As such, we suspect that their focal cross between O
and Us5, a Psk-S strain, is the same as the Padieu and Bernet paper. We have independently
conﬁrmed that Us5 (kindly provided by A. Hamann and H. Osiewacz) is Psk-S, however strain
O has not been maintained in any collection. They also state that strain He represents a
new type of spore killer. However, with O classiﬁed as Psk-5, the interactions of He match
that of a Psk-1 strain. Furthermore, strain He exhibited no spore killing with a Psk-1 strain
from Wageningen. From the cross of O and Us5 they identify a number of progeny with
unexpected genotypes. They interpret these genotypes as evidence for both gene conversion
and recombinant spore killer types. However, under a two locus model of mutual killing,
both effects can be explained by incomplete penetrance of Spok2 (Figure 2). As the cross
with Us5 showed a particularly high degree of anomalous results, it is possible that Us5
contains a unique allele of Spok2 that is a particularly weak killer.

Appendix 2 Figure 2. Explanation of results from Hamann and Osiewacz (2004) with information
about Spok genes as described in the text. The seven asci represent the possible genotype
combinations of a cross between a Psk-5 strain and a Psk-S as illustrated in Turner and Perkins (1991).
Black ovals represent the ascospores, dashed ovals represent killed spores, and coloured circles
represent the individual nuclei, where each colour corresponds to a given genotype. Genotypes are
annotated as per Turner and Perkins (1991), wherein locus 1 corresponds to a killer locus with 90% FDS,
the Psk-5 Spok block, and locus 2 represents a killer locus with 40% FDS, Spok2. Red nuclei represent the
Psk-S parental genotype with Spok2, orange nulcei represent the Psk-5 parental genotype with Spok3 and
Spok4, green nuclei represent the recombinant genotype with no Spok genes, and blue nuclei represent
the recombinant genotype with Spok2, Spok3, and Spok4. Note that Spok3 and Spok4 are linked and do
not segregate independently. Below the asci are our interpretations of the annotations from Hamann
and Osiewacz (2004). K + K strains would correspond to a strain with the Psk-5 parental genotype of
ascus type 1. These should experience mutual killing and produce empty asci, so the fact that they are
observed from 4-spored asci suggests that when mutual killing occurs, 4-spores may be observed.
However as no S + S strains were reported we can infer that only the Psk-5 type (grey) may be viable. S,K
+S,K strains are not indicative of a recombinant killer locus as suggested in the original work, but
represent strains with all three Spok genes as produced in ascus type 2. The FDS frequencies reported
suggest that the isolated strains are indicative of the blue nuclear genotype and not the green nuclear
genotype. The S,K + K and K + S,K strains are indistinguishable from each other and are indicative of the
surviving spores of a type 3 ascus. These strains should exhibit spore killing when selfed due to the
distribution of Spok2. Spore killing may not have been observed due to the incomplete penetrance of
Spok2. In all cases, these strains should not have been isolated from 4-spored asci, indicating that either
methodological issues occurred or that spore-killing may still produced 4-spored asci, but where the
spores which should be absent are instead inviable.
