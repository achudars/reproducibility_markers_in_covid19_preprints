Abstract

12

Industrial nitrogen fertilizer is intrinsic to modern agriculture yet expensive and

13

environmentally harmful. We aim to reconstitute bacterial nitrogenase function within plant

14

mitochondria to reduce nitrogen fertilizer usage. Many nitrogen fixation (Nif) proteins are

15

required for biosynthesis and function of the mature nitrogenase enzyme, and these will need

16

to be correctly processed and soluble within mitochondria as a pre-requisite for function.

17

Here we present our workflow that assessed processing, solubility and relative abundance of

18

16 Klebsiella oxytoca Nif proteins targeted to the plant mitochondrial matrix using an

19

Arabidopsis mitochondrial targeting peptide (MTP). The functional consequence of the N-

20

terminal modifications required for mitochondrial targeting of Nif proteins was tested using

21

bacterial nitrogenase assays. We found that despite the use of the same constitutive promoter

22

and MTP, MTP::Nif processing and relative abundance in plant leaf varied considerably.

23

Assessment of solubility for all MTP::Nif proteins found NifF, M, N, S, U, W, X, Y and Z

24

were soluble, while NifB, E, H, J, K, Q and V were mostly insoluble. Although most Nif

25

proteins tolerated the N-terminal extension as a consequence of mitochondrial processing,

26

this extension in NifM reduced nitrogenase activity to 10% of controls. Using proteomics, we

27

detected a ~50-fold increase in the abundance of NifM when it contained the N-terminal

28

MTP extension, which may account for this reduction seen in nitrogenase activity. Based on

29

plant mitochondrial processing and solubility, and retention of function in a bacterial assay,

30

our workflow has identified that NifF, N, S, U, W, Y and Z satisfied all these criteria. Future

31

work can now focus on improving these parameters for the remaining Nif components to

32

assemble a complete set of plant-ready Nif proteins for reconstituting nitrogen fixation in

33

plant mitochondria.

Introduction

36

Industrial nitrogen fixation has had a major contribution towards the Green Revolution, and

37

subsequent unprecedented population growth (Smil, 1999). However, the increase in global

38

use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in environmental pollution, contributing to

39

algal blooms, greenhouse gas accumulation and the acidification of soil and water sources

40

(Glibert et al., 2014; Vitousek et al., 1997). There have been several efforts in the past 50

41

years to look for alternative, more sustainable means to deliver reduced nitrogen to crops,

42

including the use of artificial symbiosis and commensal free-living bacteria (Santi et al.,

43

2014; Oldroyd and Dixon, 2014, Curatti and Rubio, 2014). More recently, advances in

44

synthetic biology have reignited the possibility of generating transgenic crops that can fix

45

their own nitrogen via direct engineering of nitrogenase (Nif) proteins into plants.

46

Nitrogenase is the enzyme that catalyses biological nitrogen fixation, i.e. the conversion of

47

atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, and is found exclusively in bacteria and archaea. The

48

molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase consists of two proteins, which are highly oxygen-

49

sensitive: The MoFe protein, a heterotetramer of NifD and NifK, and the Fe protein, a

50

homodimer of NifH. NifDK is the catalytic centre and contains the iron-molybdenum

51

cofactor ([MoFe7S9C]:homocitrate, FeMo-co; Einsle et al., 2002; Spatzal et al., 2011) and the

52

P-cluster ([Fe8S7]; Kim and Rees, 1992). NifH is the obligate electron donor, and contains a

53

[Fe4S4]-cluster (Jang et al., 2000). In addition to the structural proteins, several other Nif

54

proteins are involved in the maturation of the enzyme and assembly of the metalloclusters.

55

These include, but may not be limited to NifB, E, M, N, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z (Ribbe et

56

al., 2014). Furthermore, nitrogenase also utilizes specific electron transport proteins, NifF and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.23.887703; this version posted December 27, 2019. The copyright holder for this

57

NifJ (Deistung et al., 1985; Shah et al., 1983). For optimum nitrogenase activity, the

58

stoichiometry of the numerous Nif proteins and their temporal expression needs to be tightly

59

regulated (Pozza-Carrion et al., 2015).

60

The mitochondrial matrix has been shown to be a suitable location to express some of the

61

most oxygen-sensitive Nif proteins in a functional form (Lopez-Torrejon et al., 2016; Buren

62

et al., 2017a, Buren et al., 2019). However, it is currently technically difficult to directly

63

introduce transgenes into the mitochondrial genome and recover stable transgenic plants

64

(Macmillan et al., 2019). In this study we rely upon the endogenous mitochondrial protein

65

transport pathway for the expression of nuclear-encoded genes within the mitochondrial

66

matrix (Fig. 1; reviewed by Murcha et al., 2014). This process involves the use of

67

mitochondrial targeting peptides (MTPs) as translational fusions at the N-terminus of each

68

Nif protein (MTP::Nif). After translation in the cytoplasm the MTP::Nif protein is actively

69

transported to the mitochondrial matrix through the outer and inner transmembrane import

70

complexes. The MTP is cleaved within the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial

71

processing peptidase (MPP) and the remaining C-terminus is folded into the mature protein.

72

The MPP-dependent processing of the MTP results in residual amino acids at the N-terminus

73

of the transgenic Nif proteins, and here we term this the ‘scar’ peptide.

74

These N-terminal modifications could potentially impact the function of Nif proteins, and it is

75

currently unknown if all Nif proteins can tolerate a scar peptide. The clearest example of scar

76

peptides being tolerated was shown by the isolation of functional NifH from yeast

77

mitochondria, a result dependent on the import, MPP processing and refolding of MTP::NifH

78

and MTP::NifM (Lopez-Torrejon et al., 2016). As an alternative approach to using

79

eukaryotic platforms that currently present numerous challenges, bacterial-based assays can

80

be used to guide modifications to Nif proteins (Yang et al., 2018).

81

Another important consideration for function is the solubility of each Nif protein in plant

82

mitochondria. Burén et al. (2017a) found that NifB from Azotobacter vinelandii was

83

insoluble when it was targeted to the mitochondrial matrix of both yeast and plants.

84

Encouragingly these authors found two variants of NifB from a thermophilic archaea that was

85

soluble within the yeast mitochondrial matrix and active in a reconstitution assay (Buren et

86

al., 2017a, 2019). Aside from NifB, the solubility of other Nif proteins has not been directly

87

assessed within plant mitochondria.

88

Previously we targeted 16 Klebsiella oxytoca Nif proteins to plant mitochondria using an

89

MTP of 77 amino acids. In this study, we design and test a shorter MTP fused to the 16 Nif

90

proteins and assess abundance, processing and solubility of the synthetic proteins when

91

targeted to the plant mitochondria. This shortened MTP is cleaved within the matrix to leave

92

a nine amino acid scar, and we use a bacterial assay to assess the functional impact of this N-

93

terminal modification to each Nif protein. Our analysis has identified a subset of MTP::Nif

94

proteins that satisfy the requirements of being soluble, correctly processed, and functional.

95

These MTP::Nif proteins are now ready for further downstream analysis and functional

96

testing in plant mitochondria.

2.1

Design and testing a 51 amino acid MTP for MPP processing of MTP::Nif

100

proteins in plant mitochondria

101

Our previous work targeting Nif proteins to the mitochondrial matrix utilised a 77 amino acid

102

(AA) peptide of the N-terminus of the ATP synthase  subunit from Arabidopsis thaliana

103

(pFAγ77, Allen et al., 2017). Processing of pFAγ77 by the MPP resulted in a 35 AA residual

104

‘scar’ on the N-terminus of the Nif protein. However, introducing long N-terminal extensions

105

to Nif proteins may impair function via steric hindrance. We therefore wanted to shorten the

106

MTP sequence to minimise the remaining scar yet retain targeting capability to the plant

107

mitochondrial matrix. Previously Lee et al. (2012) showed that residues 52 to 77 of the

108

original pFAγ77 were possibly not required for transporting and processing of green

109

fluorescent protein to the mitochondrial matrix. Based on these observations we redesigned a

110

shorter MTP with a length of 51 AA, here termed pFA51. pFAγ51 is predicted to leave a

111

nine AA N-terminal extension after MPP processing that we term scar9 (amino acid sequence

112

ISTQVVRNR; Fig. 2A; Huang et al., 2009). To confirm the site of cleavage of pFAγ51 fused

113

to Nif proteins we constructed a translational fusion of pFAγ51::NifU::Twin-Strep-tag®

114

(SN166; Twin-Strep-tag®, Schmidt et al., 2013) using a modular Golden Gate assembly

115

method (Weber et al., 2011). After infiltration of SN166 into N. benthamiana leaf this protein

116

was purified by affinity chromatography (Suppl. Fig. 1) and subjected to proteomics analysis,

117

which identified ISTQVVR as the N-terminal peptide sequence. This result confirmed that

118

the shortened MTP, pFAγ51, was functional and processed as predicted to leave a nine AA

119

scar at the N-terminus.

120

2.2

121

Most pFAγ51::Nif proteins are targeted to and processed in the plant
mitochondrial matrix

122

We next wanted to assess whether the shortened MTP, pFAγ51, was able to target other Nif

123

proteins to the plant mitochondrial matrix. We generated expression constructs for 16 Nif

124

proteins with translational fusions of pFAγ51 at the N-terminus and a HA epitope tag at the

125

C-terminus, resulting in the generic structure pFAγ51::Nif::HA (Fig. 2A, plant expression

126

constructs listed in Suppl. Table 2). NifK was the only protein for which a different construct

127

was made, where the HA-tag was included at the N-terminus, since any C-terminal fusions

128

render NifK non-functional (Yang et al., 2018). Expression of pFAγ51::NifD::HA will be

129

reported as part of a separate study (Allen et al., 2019 https://doi.org/10.1101/755116) and

130

therefore was not included in this study. We constructed control expression plasmids to

131

mimic the processed protein size for all Nif proteins by replacing pFAγ51 with 6×His. These

132

6×His::Nif::HA proteins are expected to be located to the cytoplasm. Both pFAγ51::Nif::HA

133

and 6×His::Nif::HA were infiltrated, separately, in transient N. benthamiana leaf assays and

134

the migration speeds of the expressed proteins assessed by Western blot analysis.

135

Comparison of each Nif protein targeted to either the mitochondrial matrix or cytoplasm

136

demonstrated that 15 of 16 Nif proteins targeted to the mitochondria using pFAγ51 were

137

processed by MPP, although with variable efficiency (Fig. 2B, full blot images provided in

138

Suppl. Fig. 1). We observed three general classes of processing efficiency – the first being

139

efficiently cleaved, second being partially cleaved, and the last being poorly cleaved to not

140

cleaved at all. Efficient cleavage was found for eight pFAγ51::Nif::HA (NifB, E, H, J, N, U,

141

V, W) and pFAγ51::HA::NifK proteins. Six pFAγ51::Nif::HA proteins (NifF, M, S, X, Y, Z)

142

were partially cleaved, as evidenced by the presence of two HA-dependent signals, the faster

143

band migrating at the speed of the corresponding 6×His::Nif::HA control and another slower

144

band running at a speed consistent with the size of the unprocessed pFAγ51::Nif::HA

145

(predicted unprocessed protein sizes provided in Suppl. Table 1). The only protein displaying

146

no processing was pFAγ51::NifQ::HA, with only a signal found for a protein consistent with

147

the unprocessed size (Fig. 2B). For some pFAγ51::Nif::HA proteins, e.g. NifB, E, H, S, U

148

and Z there were additional signals at a higher molecular weight, which could arise from

149

dimerization or oligomerization (Suppl. Fig. 2, 3 and 4), similar to what has been previously

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.23.887703; this version posted December 27, 2019. The copyright holder for this

150

observed (Allen et al., 2017). In some instances, e.g. NifJ, we also observed degradation

151

products (Suppl. Fig. 2).

152

Using Western blot analysis to assess MPP processing further provided an indication of the

153

relative abundance of each Nif protein in the transient leaf assay system. In general, we found

154

that most of the pFAγ51::Nif::HA and pFAγ51::HA::NifK proteins were readily detectable,

155

although their abundance varied (Fig. 2B). For instance pFAγ51::NifY::HA had a relatively

156

low signal intensity whereas NifH, F and U had the highest signal intensities. Another

157

observation worth noting was the difference in abundance between cytoplasmic- and

158

mitochondria-targeted Nif proteins. NifB, E, H, U, V and W proteins targeted to the

159

mitochondria accumulated to higher levels than when targeted to the cytoplasm, whereas the

160

level of expression of the other Nif proteins were approximately equal between the

161

mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms.

162

2.3

163

As all Nif proteins need to be soluble for function we tested solubility of the Nif proteins

164

when targeted to the plant mitochondrial matrix. Total protein extracts of N. benthamiana

165

leaf tissue individually expressing 16 pFAγ51::Nif::HA and pFAγ51::HA::NifK were

166

separated into soluble and insoluble fractions and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3, full blot

167

image provided in Suppl. Fig. 3). We found that the relative abundance of correctly

168

processed Nif proteins in the soluble fraction varied for each

169

pFAγ51::Nif::HA/pFAγ51::HA::NifK. For example NifF, M, N, Q, S, and W were

170

predominantly in the soluble fraction in both the correctly processed and unprocessed form.

171

Conversely NifB, E, H, J, and V were not found in the soluble fraction, despite being

172

correctly processed. As NifM may be required for stability and solubility of NifH in bacteria

173

(Lei et al., 1999; Howard et al., 1986) we tested coexpression of mitochondrially targeted

174

pFAγ51::NifH::HA and pFAγ51::NifM::HA in transient leaf assays but found no

175

improvement in the solubility of NifH (data not shown). We found a third band for NifF

176

between the processed and unprocessed form, which was possibly an artefact of protein

177

extraction, as it was not detected in Western blot of total protein. Interestingly,

178

pFAγ51::NifQ::HA produced a faint band approximately the size of the correctly processed

179

form in the soluble fraction, which was not detectable in the total protein Western blot. To

180

assess if atmospheric oxygen affected Nif protein solubility the same 16

181

pFAγ51::Nif::HA/pFAγ51::HA::NifK proteins were isolated from infiltrated plants under

182

anaerobic conditions and subjected to Western blot analysis. We found that anaerobic

183

conditions during protein extraction did not change their solubility (Suppl. Fig. 4).

184

2.4

185

Using a bacterial assay we tested the functional impact of adding nine AA to the N-terminus

186

of each Nif protein, which mimics the residual scar peptide that remains after MPP

187

processing of pFAγ51::Nif in plant mitochondria. We adopted the MIT v2.1 plasmid system

188

(Smanski et al., 2014) for this assay, and fused the nine AA scar9 sequence, MSTQVVRNR,

189

to the N-terminus of each Nif protein, mimicking the length and sequence of pFAγ51 after

190

MPP cleavage. An example of the process is outlined with scar9::NifH replacing NifH within

191

MIT v2.1 (Fig. 4). Each scar9::Nif was tested individually in separate MIT v2.1 plasmids in

192

the same manner (bacterial expression constructs listed in Suppl. Table 3). It is worth noting

193

that MIT v2.1 does not have NifX and therefore we did not test the impact of scar9 on this

194

protein with respect to nitrogenase function. As a negative control we removed NifH, D, K,

195

Y, E, N, and J from MIT v2.1 and made a non-functional plasmid, here termed ‘pB-ori’. As

196

further controls we made other modifications, such as adding a HA epitope tag to the C-

197

terminus of NifK, namely NifK::HA, or removing NifM from MIT v2.1 (cf. Lei et al., 1999;

198

Howard et al., 1986), both of which resulted in the expected loss of nitrogenase function

199

(Table 1). Function testing of the individual scar9::Nif proteins in E. coli by acetylene

200

reduction showed that activity was retained for all 16 scar9::Nif proteins although there was

201

variation in activity levels. Notably scar9::NifJ had three times the activity of the positive

202

control, and scar9::NifQ, H, B and F were mildly increased (130-150% activity relative to

203

MIT v2.1). In contrast, scar9::NifM only retained approximately 10% activity of the positive

204

control.

205

To assess if the scar9 peptide had any influence on the relative abundance of each Nif protein

206

in E. coli, we measured the relative protein abundance of the Nif proteins D, K, H, S and M,

207

in E. coli containing the native and modified forms of MIT v2.1 using targeted proteomics.

208

We also measured the relative abundance of a peptide specific to chloramphenicol

209

acyltransferase (CAT), the coding nucleotide sequence of which was present in all MIT v2.1

210

plasmids. We found that signals for NifS and CAT peptides were relatively consistent across

211

all the samples (Suppl. Fig. 5, Suppl. Table 1). As expected, we also found that signals

212

specific to NifM, peptides M-1 and -2, were not found in E. coli containing MIT v2.1 in

213

which NifM was deleted, and that signals specific for NifD, K, H, Y, E, and N were not

214

found in E. coli with pB-ori, where these genes were removed from MIT v2.1 (data not

215

shown). The most unexpected change was found for NifM, where the relative protein

216

abundance was approximately ~50-fold higher in E. coli expressing scar9::NifM, relative to

217

those expressing other scar9::Nifs (Suppl. Fig. 5).

Discussion

220

In this study we present a workflow to assess key functional prerequisites of MTP::Nif

221

proteins targeted to plant mitochondria. These were cleavage of the MTP by the MPP in the

222

mitochondrial matrix, solubility, relative protein abundance and tolerance of N-terminal scar

223

sequences for function. The plant- and bacterial- based assays identified seven Nif proteins,

224

namely NifF, N, S, U, W, Y and Z, that we consider ready for metabolic engineering of

225

nitrogenase into plant mitochondria using pFAγ51 as the MTP. Importantly, we also found

226

other MTP::Nif proteins to be either poorly processed and/or insoluble in plant mitochondria,

227

or impaired in functional assays. The identification of these problematic MTP::Nif proteins

228

can guide targeted improvements in the future.

229

We have found relative protein abundance, processing efficiency, and solubility of the 16

230

different MTP::Nif proteins varied, despite use of the same MTP and promoter for each plant

231

expression construct. This variation illustrates how intrinsic properties of each Nif protein

232

influence these attributes in plant mitochondria. Assuming that levels of plant expressed Nif

233

proteins will need to reflect those of diazotrophic bacteria, future studies will need to adjust

234

promoter strength and/or translation rates accordingly. For example NifY was the least

235

abundant in our experiments, and efforts are needed to improve these levels to better mimic

236

those found in naturally occurring systems (Smanski et al., 2014).

237

Similarly we found some MTP::Nif proteins were poorly cleaved by the MPP, in particular

238

MTP::NifQ. A potential reason for this may be that the preprotein is unable to enter the

239

mitochondrial matrix due to the MTP::Nif protein being resistant to unfolding (Voos et al.,

240

1993, 1996). We also found that most Nif proteins that were successfully cleaved within the

241

mitochondrial matrix tended to accumulate to higher levels relative to their cytoplasmic

242

counterparts, suggesting that mitochondrial processing may stabilize Nif proteins relative to

243

those located in the cytoplasm.

244
245

In our experiments we found several MTP::Nif proteins were insoluble in the plant

246

mitochondrial matrix. Notably the key protein NifH from K. oxytoca was among this set.

247

Interestingly A. vinelandii NifH and NifM when targeted to yeast mitochondria produced a

248

functional Fe protein (Lopez-Torrejon et al., 2016), indicating that both these proteins were

249

sufficiently soluble in yeast. In agreement with prior results, we found that K. oxytoca NifB

250

was insoluble when targeted to plant mitochondria, as was described for A. vinelandii NifB

251

when targeted to yeast and plant mitochondria (Burén et al., 2017a).

252

Overcoming these processing, solubility and abundance issues we encountered will require a

253

range of approaches. There is evidence in yeast mitochondria that the import of transgenic

254

cargoes can be improved by the use of longer MTPs (Wilcox et al., 2005). Therefore

255

screening alternate length MTPs may reveal certain MTP::Nif combinations that overcome

256

problems with recalcitrant import. Other bacterial or archaeal variants of the nitrogen fixation

257

pathway can also provide the means to improve targeting, processing and ultimately activity

258

of nitrogenase within mitochondria, as was shown for nifB (Burén et al., 2017a, 2019).

259

Although this report concentrates on attributes of Nif proteins expressed individually, there

260

may be combinations of Nif proteins that when expressed together improve abundance or

261

solubility. Functional Azotobacter Nif proteins have been successfully expressed in

262

combination within yeast mitochondria (Burén et al., 2017b, 2019; Lopez-Torrejon et al.,

263

2016), and these combinations may overcome problems that we report here. Finally,

264

physically linking Nif proteins into larger multi-domain polyproteins (Allen et al., 2019

265

https://doi.org/10.1101/755116, Yang et al., 2018) that can assist in protein assembly may

266

also overcome problems associated with solubility identified in this report.

267

The function of nitrogenase may be impacted by residual terminal scar residues remaining

268

after mitochondrial targeting. Yang et al. (2018) demonstrated that the addition of the tobacco

etch virus protease cleavage site to the C-terminus of NifK abolished activity, a result that

270

could be predicted from the close interaction of NifK with NifD (Spatzal et al., 2011). Here

271

we tested a 9 AA scar on the N-terminus of 16 Nif proteins and found both positive and

272

negative impacts on overall nitrogenase activity. Importantly we found that the key protein

273

NifH supported nitrogen fixation with the N-terminal addition. NifH has three different

274

functions, firstly, donating electrons to NifDK, secondly, maturation of the [Fe8S7] P-clusters

275

within NifDK, and thirdly as a molybdenum and homocitrate insertase to NifEN (reviewed in

276

Hu and Ribbe 2013). In a previous study, NifH isolated from yeast mitochondria was capable

277

of donating electrons to NifDK (Lopez-Torrejon et al., 2016). Our study demonstrates that

278

the additional functions of NifH can also occur despite the addition of the MTP scar

279

sequence.

280

Examples of Nif proteins that did not tolerate the N-terminal extension with the MTP that

281

was tested were NifE, N and M. In the case of NifEN these proteins form a stable

282

heterotetramer, but also interact with numerous other Nif proteins during the biogenesis of

283

FeMo-co, including NifB, NifY, NafY, NifX and NifH (Ribbe et al., 2014). The N-terminal

284

extension on NifE and NifN that was tested in our study may have reduced nitrogenase

285

function via steric hinderance within protein-protein interactions associated with NifEN. The

286

most severe impact on nitrogenase function was found for scar9::NifM (~10% of control), but

287

in that instance proteomics analysis found that the abundance of scar9::NifM was highly up-

288

regulated compared with other modified MIT v2.1 plasmids. As nitrogenase activity is highly

289

sensitive to changes in Nif protein levels (reviewed in Martinez-Argudo et al., 2004) this

290

misregulation may account for the decrease in nitrogenase activity seen with scar9::NifM,

291

rather than reflecting steric interference.

292

Although mitochondria are considered potentially suitable to support nitrogenase activity,

293

impediments remain to successfully translocating all Nif proteins to the organelle. This is not

294

surprising considering the large span of evolutionary time separating the emergence of

295

nitrogenase in bacteria from the origins of mitochondria in eukaryotes (Muller et al., 2012;

296

Poole and Gribaldo, 2014). Our testing uncovered some Nif proteins that we consider

297

compatible with translocation to plant mitochondria and other Nif proteins that require further

298

improvement. The experimental framework outlined here can be applied systematically to

299

iteratively improve each Nif protein with the eventual goal of assembling the entire pathway

300

within plant mitochondria.

304

Plasmids for transient expression in N. benthamiana leaf were constructed using a modular

305

cloning system with Golden Gate assembly (Weber et al., 2011). DNA parts as individual

306

plasmids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ENSA), each containing the 35S CaMV promoter

307

(EC51288), the gene coding for the first 51 amino acids of the Arabidopsis F1-ATPase 

308

(EC38029), nifM (EC38023), nifX (EC38028), plant codon optimised HA epitope tag

312

313

(EC47772, EC47742, EC47751, EC47761, EC47781) using Type IIS restriction cloning. The

314

plasmid ID and descriptions are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

316

N. benthamiana plants were grown in a Conviron growth chamber at 23oC under a 16:8 h

317

light:dark cycle with 90 mol/min light intensity provided by cool white fluorescent lamps.

318

Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (SN vectors) or AGLI (P19 vector) cells were

319

grown to stationary phase at 28oC in LB broth supplemented with 50 mg/mL carbenicillin or

320

50 mg/mL kanamycin, according to the selectable marker gene on the vector, and 50 mg/mL

321

rifampicin. Acetosyringone was added to the culture to a final concentration of 100 μM and

322

the culture was then incubated for another 2.5 h at 28oC with shaking. The bacteria were

323

pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was

324

discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM MES pH 5.7, 10 mM MgCl2 and

325

100 μM acetosyringone (infiltration buffer) after which the OD600 was measured. A volume

326

of each culture, including the culture containing the viral suppressor construct 35S::P19,

327

required to reach a final concentration of OD600 = 0.10 was added to a fresh tube. The final

328

volume was made up with the infiltration buffer. Leaves of five-week-old plants were then

329

infiltrated with the culture mixture and the plants were grown for five days after infiltration

330

before leaf samples were harvested for further analysis/experiments.

335

HA antibody produced in mouse (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the primary antibody and

336

Immun-Star Goat Anti-Mouse (GAM)-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary

337

antibody. The PageRuler™ Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the

338

BenchMark™ Pre-Stained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was re-

calibrated against the unstained BenchMark™ protein ladder to 146 kDa, 91 kDa, 63 kDa,

340

50 kDa, 40 kDa, 33 kDa, 22 kDa, 17 kDa, 14 kDa and 10 kDa, were used as molecular size

341

markers.

342

For solubility testing the harvested leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar

343

and pestle and transferred to a microfuge tube. Three hundred (300) μL of cold solubility

346

leupeptin and 0.5% (v/v) Tween® 20) was added and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min

347

at 16,000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the pellet was

348

resuspended in 300 μL of fresh cold solubility buffer. Both, the supernatant (sample 1) and

349

the resuspended pellet (sample 2) were centrifuged again for 5 min at 16,000 x g at 4°C.

350

From sample 1 a subsample was taken, which is referred to as the soluble fraction. This

351

subsample was mixed with an equivalent amount of 4 x SDS buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH

352

6.8, 8% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 120 mM DTT and 0.004% (w/v) bromophenol blue).

353

After the second centrifugation step, the supernatant of sample 2 was discarded. The pellet is

354

referred to as the insoluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μL 4 x SDS buffer

355

and 300 μL of solubility buffer were added. When soluble and insoluble fractions were

356

compared to the amount of total protein, the leaf piece for the total protein sample was

357

ground as described above. However, the ground sample was resuspended in 300 μL 4 x SDS

358

buffer and 300 μL of solubility buffer were added. Samples for the total, insoluble and

359

soluble fractions were heated at 95°C for 3 min and then centrifuged at 12000 x g for 2 min.

360

20 μL of the supernatant containing the extracted polypeptides was loaded on a NuPAGE Bis

361

Tris 4-12% gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis.

362

For Western blot analysis of anaerobically extracted proteins, the extractions were carried out

363

in an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory Products) filled with a H2/N2 atmosphere (2-

364

3%/97-98%). Anaerobic extraction solutions were prepared at a Schlenk line in a bottle

365

equipped with a butyl rubber septum by at least four cycles of evacuating and purging with

366

N2. Leaf disks were ground in cold solubility buffer instead of liquid nitrogen.

368

N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with SN166 and P19 were harvested 4 days post

369

infiltration. Three (3.0) g leaf tissue was ground in 30 mL of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,

370

150 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 1% (w/v) PVP (average MW 40 kDa) and

371

0.1% Tween 20 using a mortar and pestle. The extract was centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30

372

min at 10°C. The supernatant was loaded on a StrepTactinXT (IBA Lifesciences) column

373

with a column volume of 2 mL equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,

374

2 mM TCEP (wash buffer). After loading, the column was washed with 20 mL wash buffer

375

and the protein was eluted with 5 mL 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP

376

and 50 mM biotin. The eluate was concentrated using an Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter

377

(10 kDa MWCO). Samples from the supernatant, flow through and eluate were subjected to

378

SDS-PAGE on a 4-12% NuPage SDS gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes

379

with the iBlot dry blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), washed with TBST and

380

developed using the Strep-Tactin-HRp conjugate (IBA Lifesciences). The SDS gel was

Isolation of pFAy51::NifU::twin-Strep from N. benthamiana

Construction of modified MIT v2.1 plasmids for function testing in Escherichia
coli

384

First, MIT v2.1 was split into two parts for easier modification of the nif genes by PCR. The

385

first half containing nifHDKYENJ was amplified with SbfI sites on either end (with oligos

3’) and ligated into pCR Blunt II TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The second half

390

containing nifBQFUSVWZM was amplified with SbfI sites on either end (with oligos

391

MIT_v2.1_SbfInifB_FW 5’- AACCTGCAGGTACTCTAACCCCATCGGCCGTCTTA-3’, and

392

MIT_v2.1_SbfIori_RV 5’-AACCTGCAGGTACGTAGCAATCAACTCACTGGCTC-3’),

393

digested with SbfI, and ligated back together. This religated plasmid, herein termed pB-ori,

394

was used as a negative control for nitrogenase function testing. The positive control was

395

constructed by ligating SbfI digested pCR Blunt II TOPO containing nifHDKYENJ and pB-

396

ori. The scar9 extension (ATGTCAACTCAAGTGGTGCGTAACCGC coding for

397

398

sequence for each nif gene, and rv primers were designed adjacent to the 5’ end of each nif

gene that the scar9 was being added (primers listed in Suppl. Table 4). The amplified PCR

400

product containing the scar9 extension in front of a given nif gene was ligated using ligation

Acetylene reduction assays on E. coli transformed with control plasmids or modified MIT

406

v2.1, along with controller plasmid N249 (Temme et al., 2012) were carried out according to

407

Dilworth (1966) with the following modifications: Transformed JM109 cells were grown

408

aerobically overnight at 37°C in LB medium with antibiotics to OD600 = 1.0. The cultures

409

were resuspended in induction medium (25 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.25 g/L

410

MgSO4.7H2O, 1 g/L NaCl, 0.1 g/L CaCl2.2H2O, 2.9 mg/L FeCl3, 0.25 mg/L Na2MoO4.2H2O,

411

20 g/L sucrose, 0.015% serine, 0.5% casamino acids, 5 mg/L biotin, 10 mg/L para-

412

aminobenzoic acid, 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), transferred to air-

413

tight culture flasks, and headspace sparged with argon gas. After 5 h incubation at 30°C, 200

414

rpm, pure C2H2 was injected into the headspace at 10% (vol.) and incubated for a further

415

18 h. Production of ethylene was measured by gas chromatography with flame ionisation

416

detection (GC-FID) using a RT-Alumina Bond/MAPD column (30 m x 0.32 mm ID x 5 μm

417

film thickness) with a 5 m particle trap column fitted to the detector end of an Agilent 6890N

418

GC. Parameters for the GC-FID were as follows: the inlet and FID were set to 200°C, carrier

419

gas (He) velocity at 35 cm/s, and isothermal oven temperature set to 120°C.

420

4.7

421

Proteins were extracted from IPTG-induced E. coli JM109 containing modified MIT v2.1

422

plasmid as described above for the acetylene reduction assay using 8 M urea and 2% SDS in

423

100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Protein extracts were stored at -80˚C prior to processing. Protein

424

estimations were performed using the Bio-Rad microtiter Bradford protein assay (California,

425

USA) according to the instructions provided (Bio-Rad version: Lit 33 Rev C) and

426

measurements were made at 595 nm using a SpectraMax Plus. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)

427

standard was used in the linear range 0.05 mg/mL to approximately 0.5 mg/mL. The BSA

428

concentration was determined by high sensitivity amino acid analysis at Australian

429

Proteomics Analysis Facility (Sydney, Australia).

E. coli tryptic digestion

431

Protein was subjected to filter-aided sample preparation (Wiśniewski et al., 2011). In brief,

432

100 µL (~200 µg) of protein was diluted in 100 µL of 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5

433

(UA buffer) and loaded onto a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) centrifugal filter

434

(Merck Millipore, Australia) and centrifuged at 20,800 x g for 15 min at 22˚C. The filter (and

435

protein >10 kDa) was washed with 200 µL of UA buffer and centrifuged at 20,800 x g for 15

436

min at 22˚C. To reduce the protein on the filter, dithiothreitol (50 mM, 200 µL) was added

437

and the solution incubated at room temperature for 50 min with shaking. The filter was

438

washed with two 200 µL volumes of UA buffer with centrifugation (20,800 x g, 15 min). For

439

cysteine alkylation, iodoacetamide (IAM) (100 µL, 50 mM IAM in UA buffer) was added

440

and incubated in the dark for 30 min at 22˚C before centrifugation (20,800 x g, 15 min) and

441

washed with two 200 µL volumes of UA buffer with centrifugation (20,800 x g, 15 min)

442

followed by two subsequent wash/centrifugation steps with 200 µL of 50 mM ammonium

443

bicarbonate. The trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Alexandria, Australia) solution (200

444

µL, 20 µg/mL (4 µg) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 1 mM CaCl2) was loaded onto

445

the filter and incubated for 18 h at 37°C in a wet chamber. The tryptic peptides were collected

446

by centrifugation (20,800 x g, 15 min) followed by an additional wash with 200 µL of 50 mM

447

ammonium bicarbonate. The combined filtrates were lyophilized and stored at -20°C.

449

The digested peptides were reconstituted in 50 µL of 1% formic acid (FA) and

450

chromatographic separation (4 μL) on an Ekspert nanoLC415 (Eksigent, Dublin, CA, U.S.A.)

451

directly coupled to a TripleTOF 6600 liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-

452

MS/MS, SCIEX, Redwood City, CA, USA). The peptides were desalted for 5 min on a

453

ChromXP C18 (3 μm, 120 Å, 10 mm × 0.3 mm) trap column at a flow rate of 10 μL/min

454

0.1% FA, and separated on a ChromXP C18 (3 μm, 120 Å, 150 mm × 0.3 mm) column at a

455

flow rate of 5 μL/min at 30˚C. A linear gradient from 3-25% solvent B over 68 min was

456

employed followed by: 5 min from 25% B to 35% B; 2 min 35% B to 80% B; 3 min at 80%

457

B, 80-3% B, 1 min; and 8 min re-equilibration. The solvents were: (A) 5% dimethylsulfoxide

30 MS/MS, each with a 40 ms accumulation time. First stage MS analysis was performed in

463

positive ion mode, mass range m/z 400−1250 and 0.25 s accumulation time. Tandem mass

464

spectra were acquired on precursor ions >150 counts/s with charge state 2−5 and dynamic

465

exclusion for 15 s with a 100 ppm mass tolerance. Spectra were acquired over the mass range

466

of m/z 100−1500 using the manufacturer’s rolling collision energy based on the size and

467

charge of the precursor ion. Protein identification was undertaken using ProteinPilot™ 5.0

468

software (SCIEX) with searches conducted against the E. coli subset of the Uniprot-

469

SwissProt database (2018/08) appended with a custom nitrogenase (Nif+Mit2Nif) database

470

including the control chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT/P62577) and a contaminant

471

database (Common Repository of Adventitious Proteins). The total number of proteins in the

472

custom database was 5410.

473

4.10 Identification of prototypic peptides for nitrogenase proteins in E. coli

474

From the identified peptides, two NifM peptides (DAFAPLAQR and DYLWQQSQQR) that

475

were fully tryptic, contained no unusual cleavages and/or modifications and showed high

476

response in the MS (as judged by peak intensity) were selected for multiple reaction

477

480

spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS)

481

Reduced and alkylated tryptic peptides (5 μL) were chromatographically separated on a

482

Kinetex C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, Phenomenex) using a linear gradient of 5–45%

483

acetonitrile (in 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min at a flow rate of 400 μL/min. The eluent from

484

the Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC was directed to a QTRAP 6500 mass spectrometer (SCIEX)

485

equipped with a TurboV ionisation source operated in positive ion mode for data acquisition

486

and analysis. The MS parameters were as follows: ion spray voltage, 5500 V; curtain gas, 35;

487

GS1, 35; GS2, 40; source temperature, 500°C; declustering potential, 70 V; and entrance

488

potential, 10 V. Peptides were fragmented in the collision cell with nitrogen gas using rolling

494

were integrated using Skyline (MacLean, Bioinformatics 2010) wherein all transitions were

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT/P62577) enzyme is an effector of chloramphenicol

499

resistance in bacteria and is expressed in all E. coli JM109 transformed with unmodified or

500

modified MIT v2.1. This protein was selected as a control for protein expression. Three
