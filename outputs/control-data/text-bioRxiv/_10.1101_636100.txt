Abstract

12

The killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) is one of the most recent, but also most

13

damaging, aquatic invasive species in Europe, but information on how the species responds

14

to novel predation pressures in recently invaded areas is very limited. We employed an open

15

test arena to examine predator recognition and anti-predatory behaviour in killer shrimp

16

exposed to either blank water or water conditioned with fish kairomones to simulate a

17

predator threat. Within five years after their introduction, killer shrimp spent much more time

18

hiding in the presence of fish kairomones than when they were exposed to blank water.

19

However, no significant difference was found in aggregation behaviour, and killer shrimp

20

were strongly attracted to the scent of conspecifics regardless of predator threat. Given the

21

strong selective pressures that fish predators can exert on native and invasive gammarids, our

22

findings highlight the need to consider prey-predator interactions to better predict the

23

dispersal and likely impact of killer shrimp into invaded ecosystems.

Introduction

37

From a prey-predator perspective two opposing selective forces may confront invasive

38

species when they colonise a new area: the absence of former predators may facilitate their

39

establishment (the enemy release hypotheses – Colautti et al. (2004), while their different

40

appearance (the oddity effect - Almany et al. (2007) and lack of co-evolutionary history (the

41

‘naïve prey’ hypothesis - Sih et al. 2010) may curtail it. Thus, whether invasive species thrive

42

or flounder may depend on what predators they encounter, and how they respond to them.

43

This may result in ‘boom and bust’ cycles, reflecting prey-predator dynamics (Strayer et al.

44

2017). Surprisingly, very little is known about anti-predatory strategies of invasive species in

45

novel habitats.

46

The killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) is a freshwater gammarid indigenous to

47

the Ponto-Caspian region which has recently invaded Western Europe (Tricarico et al. 2010),

48

and which therefore constitutes a good system to examine anti-predatory strategies in novel

49

habitats. The species has a small size (1.8-30mm; Aldridge 2015) a flexible omnivorous diet

50

(Mayer et al. 2008), and lives in a wide variety of freshwater and brackish habitats (Devin &

51

Beisel 2008) where it faces many different potential predators. Despite its very recent

52

introduction, it is listed among the 100 most invasive species in Europe (DAISIE 2009) and

53

included in the RINSE (Reducing the Impact of Non-Native Species in Europe) black list

54

with a score of 9 out of 10 (Gallardo et al. 2016). It can displace and prey on local gammarids

55

and reduce native biodiversity (Eckmann et al. 2008; Macneil et al. 2013), and may already

56

be benefitting from a boom phase in some parts of Europe, having shed some of its former

57

parasites (Arundell et al. 2015; Grabner et al. 2015). The need for more information on this

58

aquatic invader has been flagged as a priority (Gallardo et al. 2016; Pöckl 2009), as it is

59

predicted that the species will cause major deleterious impacts on native fauna (MacNeil et

60

al. 2012).

61

Studies on the killer shrimp have focused mostly on its diet, there is very little information on

62

its predators. The species appears to be trophically very plastic (Bacela-Spychalska & van der

63

Velde 2013; Casellato et al. 2007; Platvoet et al. 2009), which would make it vulnerable to

64

many different predators. Gammarids are an important prey for many fishes (Mazzi & Bakker

65

2003; Perrot-Minnot et al. 2007) and there are reports that native brown trout and perch can

66

feed on killer shrimp in Britain (Aldridge 2015; Madgwick & Aldridge 2011). However,

67

knowledge on the predators of killer shrimp is mostly anecdotal and there is little information

68

on anti-predatory behaviour of this species in newly colonized areas, which is an important

69

aspect to consider for predicting its future spread and impact.

70

Hiding, aggregation and crypsis are three of the most common anti-predatory

71

strategies in aquatic species (Keenleyside 1979), which in the case of benthic gammarids are

72

intimately related to the nature of the substrate (Holomuzki & Hoyle 1990). Hiding behaviour

73

is particularly strong in gammarids (Goedmakers 1981; Jazdzewski et al. 2004), and

74

availability of suitable substrate to hide can be a key determinant of establishment success in

75

invasive gammarids (Devin et al. 2003), as different species may compete for shelter. For

76

example, De Gelder et al. (2016) reported that the killer shrimp’s strong tendency to hide

77

during daytime can displace the European native gammarid Gammarus roeselii from their

78

shelters, which might put them at a higher risk of predation. Another common anti-predatory

79

strategy is aggregation behaviour, as being part of a group can confuse predators (Krakauer

80

1995; Krause & Ruxton 2002) and reduce the per-capita probability of being preyed (Codella

81

& Raffa 1995). Aggregation behaviour, however, also has costs as it is influenced by

82

competition for food and mating partners, and poses a greater risk of being parasitized, which

83

may put the group at a disadvantage (Krause & Ruxton 2002).

84

85

Thus, while killer shrimp invading Europe could be benefitting from a boom phase
caused by predator release, the oddity effect and prey naïvety of novel predators might make

86

them more vulnerable to native predators in the invaded waters. To shed light on this issue,

87

we tested two anti-predatory behaviours (hiding and aggregation) in killer shrimp exposed to

88

either dechlorinated water (control) or water conditioned with kairomones (i.e. semio-

89

chemicals emitted by predators that allow eavesdropping by prey without benefitting the

90

predator - Roberts & Garcia de Leaniz (2011) from a carnivorous fish predator, the three

91

spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We wanted to test if killer shrimp from a

92

recently colonized stream in Britain were able to recognise a common native fish as a

93

predator or, on the contrary, displayed prey naïvety that might make it more difficult to

94

mount and efficient anti-predatory response and, hence, make it more difficult to become

95

established in neighbouring waters.

Materials and Methods

98

Collection and origin of samples

99

Killer shrimp (average size = 16.8 ± 0.9mm) were collected by live trapping in the Upper

100

Mother Ditch (Margam, Wales, 51°33'19.5"N 3°44'46.6"W) in May 2017, and three-spined

101

stickleback (weight range 0.9-2.0g) were hand-netted from an ornamental pond in Swansea

102

(Singleton Park, Wales 51°36'26.2 "N 3°58'52.4"W) in July 2017. We maintained the two

103

species in separate 100L recirculation aquaculture systems at CSAR facilities (Swansea

104

University) to avoid mixing their scents. Both species were fed frozen bloodworms, the

105

sticklebacks every day and the killer shrimp three times per week. Water temperature was

106

maintained at 15-16.5 ˚C with a weekly replacement of 20% volume.

107

108

Experimental design

109

We set up two experiments to examine the killer shrimp’s anti-predatory behaviour in

110

relation to the presence of stickleback’s kairomones (a fish predator that feeds on

111

gammarids). In the first experiment, we compared the hiding behaviour of individual killer

112

shrimp tested in water conditioned with stickleback kairomones compared to blank water. In

113

the second experiment, we examined the attraction of single killer shrimp to the scent of

114

conspecifics in an open-test arena scented with stickleback kairomones or with blank water.

115

We chose the three-spined stickleback as a test predator because it is a common predator of

116

gammarids (Macneil et al. 1999; Mazzi & Bakker 2003) and was present at the study site

117

(Upper Mother Ditch) where killer shrimp were first detected in 2011, having been detected

118

in a nearby reservoir one year earlier, in November 2010 (Madgwick & Aldridge 2011).

122

Water conditioning

123

To obtain the kairomones used to simulate the presence of a predator, we housed 20

124

stickleback (biomass = 2.9 g/L) in a 10L tank of dechlorinated water for 24 hours. The

125

conditioned water was prepared freshly the day before the experiments.

126

127

Experiment 1. Hiding behaviour under the threat of predation

128

To quantify hiding behaviour under the threat of predation we used a 2L plastic tank

129

(L:20cm, W:10cm, H:10cm) fitted with artificial grass patches (3cm2) glued to the bottom in

130

a staggered fashion (Figure 1a), and a release cylinder (3.5cm diameter) located in the centre

131

of the tank. At the beginning of the experiment 250ml of either dechlorinated water (control

132

test) or fish-conditioned water (treatment) was added to the tank. One killer shrimp was

133

placed inside the release cylinder and left to acclimatise for 5 min. The cylinder was then

134

slowly lifted and the behaviour of the killer shrimp (time spent swimming or hiding in the

135

artificial grass patches) was recorded for 10 minutes with a GoPro Hero camera mounted

136

above the test tank (Figure 2A). In total, 20 individuals were tested with fish conditioned

137

water and 20 individuals with blank water, the order of which was determined at random.

138

139

Experiment 2. Conspecific attraction

140

To test if killer shrimp were more attracted to conspecifics under the threat of predation, we

141

used a tank of the same size and volume (2 L) as the one used in experiment 1, but in this

142

case the bottom was left bare and did not have artificial grass patches. At the two extremes of

143

the tank we attached two tea balls (diameter 5cm) and drew two lines in the tank to notionally

144

divide it into three equal sectors, two choice zones associated with the tea balls, and a middle

145

section that served as a neutral (no choice) zone (Figure 1b). Ten killer shrimp were

146

introduced in one of the two tea balls chosen at random, while the other one was left empty.

147

As for experiment 1, 250ml of fish conditioned water or dechlorinated water were added to

148

the tank and a single individual was introduced in the acclimatization cylinder, where it was

149

left to acclimatize for 5min The cylinder was then removed, and the activity of the killer

150

shrimp was recorded for 10 minutes with an overhead GoPro camera, as above. The time

151

spent in each of the three tank zones was used to describe its behaviour: the time spent in the

152

side containing the tea ball with conspecifics was interpreted as measure of attraction for

153

group protection, the time spent in the central part was interpreted as neutral behaviour, and

154

the time spent in the side with the empty tea ball was interpreted as avoidance of

155

conspecifics. After each trial, the position of the two tea balls was alternated to control for

156

possible external disturbances. In total, 40 killer shrimp were tested, 20 with dechlorinated

157

water and 20 with fish scented water. The killer shrimp inside the tea ball were replaced

158

between sessions to reduce aggressive behaviour due to confinement.

159

160

Statistical analyses

161

We used R 3.3 (Team 2017), for analysis. For both experiments, we used a paired t-test to

162

examine if (1) killer shrimp spent more time hiding than swimming when they were exposed

163

to fish kairomones than when they were exposed to blank water (Experiment 1), and if (2)

164

attraction to conspecifics was stronger when the killer shrimp were exposed to kairomones

165

from a fish predator than when they were exposed to dechlorinated water (Experiment 2) .

Results

176

Experiment 1. Hiding behaviour

177

Killer shrimp spent significantly more time hiding when the water was conditioned with

178

kairomones from a predatory fish (mean time ± 95CI = 543.45 ± 13.7 s) than when they were

179

tested against blank water (mean time ± 95CI = 386.75 ± 18.5 s; behaviour x treatment

180

interaction F1,76 = 544.02, P < 0.001; Figure 2). Controls spent 50% of their time hiding and

181

50% swimming (t19 = 1.416, P = 0.173), whereas when they were exposed to fish kairomones

182

they spent 91% of their time hiding and only 9% swimming (t19 = 34.789, P < 0.001).

183

184

Experiment 2. Attraction to conspecifics

185

Killer shrimp spent much more time in the side of the tank scented with conspecifics (mean

186

time 477.5 ± 20.5 s) than in the opposite side (mean time 39.1 ± 12.2 s), but such preference

187

was not affected by the presence of fish kairomones (t19 = 0.245, P = 0.808; Figure 3).

Discussion

192

Our study shows that within 6 years (approximately 20 generations) of their introduction into

193

a novel area in Britain killer shrimp display a strong tendency to hide when they are exposed

194

to the chemical scent of a native predatory fish (the three spined stickleback), but not when

195

they are exposed to dechlorinated water. Given that no evidence of predator avoidance was

196

detected on the same population in relation to the scent of non-predatory Nile tilapia (Rolla et

197

al. 2019), this strongly suggests that chemical recognition of stickleback kairomones

198

constitutes an evolved, adaptive trait.

199

Much of our knowledge on the invasive killer shrimp refers to its role as a predator,

200

there is little information regarding its role as a fish prey. This is unfortunate because

201

predatory fish can exert strong selective pressures on gammarids (Åbjörnsson et al. 2004;

202

Ahlgren et al. 2011; Kinzler & Maier 2006; Kotta et al. 2010; Wudkevich et al. 1997) and

203

could play a major role in determining the killer shrimp’s invasion success. The killer shrimp

204

has been found in the diet of 17 fish species found in the introduced range (9 exotic and 8

205

native, Table 1), but predator recognition has only been reported for the European bullhead

206

Cottus gobio (Sornom et al. 2012), the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus (Jermacz et al.

207

2017), and the spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus (Hesselschwerdt et al. 2009),

208

therefore little is known about its antipredator behaviour. Amphipods can change their

209

behaviour and habitat preferences when they detect chemical cues from potential predators

210

(Baumgärtner et al. 2003; Thiel 2010), but also from injured conspecifics (Wisenden et al.

211

2001; Wudkevich et al. 1997), similar to what has been observed among teleost fishes

212

(Roberts & Garcia de Leaniz 2011). Kairomone detection by gammarids has been reported

213

previously as an anti-predatory strategy (Wudkevich et al. 1997), but seldom in the context of

214

invasion biology (Hesselschwerdt et al. 2009).

215

Predation by native species could reduce, or at least slow down, invasions by non-

216

native species (Zuharah & Lester 2010; Zuharah & Lester 2011) because they may not be

217

able to recognise native predators (Sih et al. 2010), but also because their different

218

appearance could make them easier to detect, or make them more attractive, to native

219

predators (the ‘oddity prey effect’, (Penry Williams et al. 2018). For example, killer shrimp

220

are typically larger than native freshwater gammarids (Devin et al. 2003), and this might

221

make it easier for visual predators to detect them. However, native predators may also be

222

reluctant to feed on novel prey due to neophobia (Champneys et al. 2018), and this could

223

result on lower predation pressure on invasive species (Crawley 1987; MacNeil et al. 2000;

224

Trowbridge 1995; Wells & Henderson 1993). Killer shrimp could also benefit from a

225

‘shadow of safety’ effect if their relative low abundance during the earlier stages of invasion

226

deflects predation pressure to the more abundant native prey (Trillo et al. 2016). Killer

227

shrimp can rapidly become the dominant species in invaded benthonic communities (Dick &

228

Platvoet 2000) and can become the most abundant food resource for fish feeding on

229

macroinvertebrates. For example, field studies have indicated that killer shrimp can replace

230

native Gammarus roeseli in the diet of zoo-benthivorous fish (Eckmann et al. 2008), but

231

other studies have suggested the opposite, and reported that native fish prefer to feed on

232

native gammarids (Kinzler & Maier 2006).

233

Clearly, the role of predation on invasion dynamics is difficult to predict, but

234

knowledge of the time since introduction, and of prey-predator interactions appear important

235

in determining establishment success. This is particularly complicated in the case of the killer

236

shrimp in Great Britain because although its arrival is very recent, it may have already

237

learned to chemically recognise a range of novel predators during its long invasion of Europe.

238

Killer shrimp in the British Isles are genetically similar to those in continental Europe

239

(Rewicz et al. 2015), where the invasion started in 1992 after the opening of the Main-

240

Danube canal (Dick & Platvoet 2000), suggesting that they are stepping stones direct

241

descendants from the first invaders. Stepping stones strategies drive the long distance

242

dispersal of many species (Saura et al. 2014), and it is possible that repeated residencies in

243

different habitats may have enabled the killer shrimp to learn to recognise different predators.

244

Given that the three-spined stickleback is also widespread in continental Europe, our study

245

cannot rule out that the observed predator recognition was acquired in Britain, or represents

246

an older behavioural legacy from previous invasions.

247

Two common anti-predatory strategies in amphipods are to reduce mobility and

248

become more aggregated under the risk of predation (Åbjörnsson et al. 2000; Williams &

249

Moore 1985; Williams et al. 2016). Results from Experiment 1 in our study indicate that

250

killer shrimp spend more time hiding and less time swimming when they were exposed to

251

predator kairomones, as seen in other gammarids. These findings are also in agreement with

252

those of Sornom et al. (2012) who observed a decrease in mobility and an increase in hiding

253

time in killer shrimp exposed to the scent of another fish predator, the European bullhead

254

(Cottus gobio). However, our results on aggregation behaviour (Experiment 2) are more

255

equivocal. Unlike Gammarus pulex, which become increasingly aggregated when exposed to

256

stickleback kairomones (Kullmann et al. 2008), killer shrimp in our study showed the same

257

strong preference to remain in the vicinity of conspecifics even when there was no immediate

258

threat of predation. Exposure to bullhead kairomones also failed to elicit an increase in killer

259

shrimp aggregation (Sornom et al. 2012), but in this case aggregation was low. Jermacz et al.

260

(2017) have shown that killer shrimp prefer to hide in response to predator cues, rather than

261

aggregate, when refuges are present, and that they aggregate when there are no shelters and

262

staying in a group is the only antipredator strategy possible. It is possible that aggregation

263

behaviour in the killer shrimp depends on the availability of shelters, but also on the risk of

264

intra-guild predation. Compared to native gammarids, killer shrimp display higher sociability

and lower incidence of cannibalism (Kinzler et al. 2009; Truhlar & Aldridge 2015), which

266

may explain their strong tendency to aggregate. Aggregation behaviour can provide not only

267

protection from fish predators (Åbjörnsson et al. 2004), but could also facilitate dispersal, as

268

living in a group would increase the number of founders, and propagule pressure has been

269

found to be an important factor determining invasion success (Consuegra et al. 2011;

270

Ricciardi et al. 2010)

271

272

Conclusions

273

In conclusion, prey-predator dynamics are an important, but largely neglected, determinants

274

of invasion success and our study indicates that knowledge of anti-predatory strategies might

275

be important for predicting dispersal pathways and risk of establishment in the killer shrimp,

276

and likely also on other aquatic invaders. Killer shrimp are dispersing at an alarmingly fast

277

rate in Europe (DAISIE 2009; Gallardo et al. 2016), and prevention and control measures

278

might benefit from information on prey and predators present in communities at risk. In this

279

sense, behavioural profiling of anti-predatory strategies, using perhaps some of the simple

280

assays shown in our study, could be incorporated into risk assessments. Knowledge of how

281

invasive species might respond to resident predators can inform the development of more

282

efficient management actions, as these seldom consider biotic resistance (Robinson et al.

283

2019; Robinson et al. 2018). Given its strong aggregation behaviour, we also suggest that

284

even when complete eradication is not possible, control measures that aim to reduce the

285

density of killer shrimp might be beneficial, as a lower relative abundance and a smaller

286

group size can make them more vulnerable to fish predators, potentially reducing their impact

287

on native communities.
