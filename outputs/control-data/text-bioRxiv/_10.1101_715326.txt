Abstract: Dopamine is well known to regulate movement through the differential control of direct and
indirect pathways in the striatum that express D1 and D2 receptors respectively. The spinal cord also
expresses all dopamine receptors however; how the specific receptors regulate spinal network output in
mammals is poorly understood. We explore the receptor-specific mechanisms that underlie dopaminergic
control of spinal network output of neonatal mice during changes in spinal network excitability. During
spontaneous activity, which is a characteristic of developing spinal networks operating in a low excitability
state, we found that dopamine is primarily inhibitory. We uncover an excitatory D1-mediated effect of
dopamine on motoneurons and network output that also involves co-activation with D2 receptors. Critically,
these excitatory actions require higher concentrations of dopamine; however, analysis of dopamine
concentrations of neonates indicates that endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low. Because
endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low, this excitatory dopaminergic pathway is likely
physiologically-silent at this stage in development. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of dopamine, at low
physiological concentrations is mediated by parallel activation of D2, D3, D4 and α2 receptors which is
reproduced when endogenous dopamine levels are increased by blocking dopamine reuptake and
metabolism. We provide evidence in support of dedicated spinal network components that are controlled
by excitatory D1 and inhibitory D2 receptors that is reminiscent of the classic dopaminergic indirect and
direct pathway within the striatum. These results indicate that network state is an important factor that
dictates receptor-specific and therefore dose-dependent control of neuromodulators on spinal network
output and advances our understanding of how neuromodulators regulate neural networks under
dynamically changing excitability.
Keywords: dopamine, dopamine receptors, spinal cord, rhythmicity, motor systems
Significance statement: Monoaminergic neuromodulation of neural networks is dependent not only on
target receptors but also on network state. We studied the concentration-dependent control of spinal
networks of the neonatal mouse, in vitro, during a low excitability state characterized by spontaneous
network activity. Spontaneous activity is an essential element for the development of networks. Under these
conditions, we defined converging receptor and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the diverse,
concentration-dependent control of spinal motor networks by dopamine, in vitro. These experiments
advance understanding of how monoamines modulate neuronal networks under dynamically changing
excitability conditions and provide evidence of dedicated D1 and D2 regulated network components in the
spinal cord that are consistent with those reported in the striatum.

Sharples et al., 2019 | Dopaminergic control of spinal networks

Introduction
Neuromodulators are critical for central
nervous system function and diversify circuit
outputs by altering synaptic and intrinsic
properties [1–3]. Dopamine is a monoamine
neuromodulator that is well known for action
selection in vertebrates through the control of
direct and indirect circuits of the basal ganglia
that express excitatory D1 and inhibitory D2
receptors respectively (for review, see [4] and [5–
7] for examples). Dopamine is also important for
the regulation of spinal motor networks that
control rhythmic movements including but not
limited to locomotion (for review, see [8]). In
larval zebrafish, phasic and tonic firing patterns
of descending neurons that provide the primary
source of spinal dopamine correlates with
locomotor episodes and quiescence, respectively
[9]. These different firing patterns can impact the
cellular release of dopamine and as a
consequence, the receptor subtypes it activates
[10]. For example, high levels of dopamine
released during phasic cell firing activate lower
affinity excitatory D1 receptors and promote
locomotor activity, and lower levels of dopamine
released during tonic activity activate higher
affinity inhibitory D2 receptors and suppress
motor output [11]. Similarly, dopamine has dosedependent effects on locomotor circuits in
precocial species with functional swim networks
[12].
We have recently demonstrated that
neuromodulation of developing mammalian
spinal circuits is state-dependent [13] which is
consistent with work in invertebrates [14,15].
This is important in developing spinal motor
networks which produce a wide repertoire of
patterned outputs at birth, including locomotor
activity, as a consequence of dynamically
fluctuating network excitability. That being said,
neonatal rodents rarely produce coordinated
bouts of locomotion and in vitro preparations of
isolated spinal cord require pharmacological or
electrical stimulation to drive the network into a
high excitability state to produce fictive walking
patterns. Instead, most of the movements

observed in neonatal mice are ataxic. (See
Supplementary Video 1). These movements
correlate with spontaneous network activity,
which can be observed in vitro [16–19].
Nevertheless, the vast majority of what we know
about
neuromodulation
of
developing
mammalian spinal networks has been derived
from studies on fictive locomotor activities with
dopamine being predominantly excitatory when
spinal networks are operating in this state [20–
31].
Based on our previous work, we
hypothesized that receptor actions, and therefore
concentration-dependent control of network
output by dopamine, is linked to the underlying
network excitability state [13]. As a result, more
complex receptor-dependent actions may have
been masked during high excitability states of
fictive locomotion. We therefore examined how
dopamine modulates spinal output at the network
and cellular level of neonatal mouse spinal cords
in vitro during a low excitability state
characterized by spontaneous activity [16,17].
We found that the receptor-specific effects of
dopamine are fundamentally different during a
low excitability state compared to what has been
previously reported during high excitability
states. Specifically, during a low excitability
state, dopamine has primarily inhibitory effects
on network output acting in parallel through
activation of D2, D3, D4, and α2 receptors. We
uncover an excitatory effect of dopamine that is
likely physiologically silent. This is because
endogenous dopamine levels in the spinal cord
are low at this age and the excitatory effects,
involving coactivation of both D1 and D2
receptors, require higher concentrations of
dopamine. We also found that excitatory and
inhibitory dopaminergic pathways act through
the control of dedicated network components.
Specifically, the D1 pathway acts through
excitation of motoneurons, likely recruiting
recurrent excitatory circuits [32], with the D2
pathway acting through hyperpolarization of
multiple ventral interneuron subclasses. Portions

Results
Dopaminergic modulation of spinal motor
networks is dose-dependent and bidirectional
We focused on the modulation of
perinatal spontaneous activity patterns to
investigate how dopamine modulates spinal
network output during a physiologically relevant
low excitability state. Using the same
experimental set-up as Sharples et al. [23], we
recorded spontaneous motor activity with
extracellular suction electrodes from single
ventral roots of the second or fifth lumbar
(L2/L5) segments simultaneously from two or
four spinal cord preparations sharing the same
chamber. Each preparation in this series of
experiments was naïve to dopamine exposure and
received only a single dose of its respective
concentration. This configuration ensured
consistent experimental conditions across several
preparations exposed to different concentrations
of dopamine. Low concentrations of dopamine
(1–30 µM) consistently suppressed spontaneous
motor activity, whereas higher concentrations
(100–300 µM) excited spontaneous motor
activity, evoking episodic and continuous
rhythmic patterns (Fig. 1; n = 42, F(5,36) = 10.5. p
< 0.001).

Parallel actions of D2, D3, D4, dopamine and
alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediate
dopaminergic inhibition of spontaneous
activity
To delineate receptor contributions to
dopamine’s bidirectional effects on endogenous
spontaneous activity in isolated spinal cord
preparations, we used antagonists selective for
the family of dopamine receptors. At low
concentrations of dopamine, we observed a
negative response ratio (Fig. 2A, Di), which was
due to a reduction in the number (Fig. 2Dii), but
not the amplitude, of spontaneous episodes (Fig.
2Diii). In contrast to our hypotheses, the
inhibitory effect of dopamine at low
concentrations (10 µM) was not altered by

antagonists targeting D2 (L-741,626; n = 3,
response ratio = −0.57 ± 0.26 ), D2/D3 (sulpiride;
20 µM; n = 10, response ratio = −0.36 ± 0.2),
D3 (SB-27701-A, 5 µM; n = 3; response ratio =
−0.36 ± 0.3), D4 (L-745,870; n = 3, response ratio
= −0.32 ± 0.1) or D1/D5 receptors (SCH 23390; n
= 4, response ratio = −0.43 ± 0.2). However,
when all D2-like receptors were blocked with a
cocktail of sulpiride (D2/D3, 20 µM) and L745,870 (D4, 5 µM), response ratios indicated that
the inhibitory effect of 10 µM dopamine was
attenuated, compared with dopamine alone (Fig.
2C; n = 6; one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), F(4,32) = 7.3, p < 0.001; Tukey post hoc
p = 0.09), to a level where it was not significantly
different from a time-matched vehicle control
(Fig. 2C, Di.; n = 6, F(4,32) = 7.3, p < 0.001; Tukey
post hoc, p = 0.98). Burst analysis revealed no
difference in the number or amplitude of episodes
when antagonists were present, compared with
baseline (Fig. 2Dii, Diii; two-way ANOVAs for
number, F(2,28) = 9.5, p < 0.0001; two-way
ANOVA for amplitude: F(4,28) = 3.4, p = 0.023).
Together these data suggest that the inhibitory
actions of dopamine depend on parallel action of
D2, D3 and D4 receptors.
We considered the possibility that the
inhibitory influence of low dopamine
concentrations was partly due to the activation of
non-dopamine receptors. Previous work
conducted in our laboratory showed that
dopamine inhibits cauda equina-evoked
locomotion, partially via α2-adrenergic receptors
[30]. The remaining minor inhibitory effect of
dopamine at 10 µM was blocked by antagonizing
the α2-adrenergic receptors with yohimbine (4
µM) in the presence of D2/D3 and D4 receptor
antagonists. We observed significantly different
response ratios, compared with 10 µM dopamine
alone (Fig. 2Di; n = 6, F(4,32) = 7.3, p < 0.001;
Tukey post hoc, p = 0.006). Low dopamine
concentrations did not change the number or
amplitude of episodes in the presence of these
antagonists, compared with baseline (Fig. 2Dii,

Diii) suggesting that non-dopamine receptors
also contribute to dopamine’s inhibitory effects.
D1 - D2 receptor coactivation contributes to
dopaminergic excitation of spinal network
activity
Dopamine binding to D1 and D2
heteromers can lead to depolarization via an
increase in intracellular calcium levels, mediated
by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC) [35–38].
Thus, we first tested the role of the lower affinity
D1 receptor system and then examined whether
the D2 receptor system has a cooperative role in
the control of spontaneous activity. With the
addition of dopamine at high concentrations (i.e.,
50 & 100 µM), spontaneous activity patterns
became rhythmic, often producing a slow rhythm
with episodes of high frequency rhythmic
activity. Moreover, the presence of the D1-like
receptor antagonist, SCH-23390, reduced this
effect (Fig. 3; 100 µM dopamine with 10 µM
SCH-23390; n = 5; response ratio, F(5,35) = 11.4, p
< 0.001); fast rhythm power, F(4,27) = 12.6, p <
0.001; slow rhythm power, H(4) = 12.8, p = 0.013;
Fig. 3 B & C, 50 µM dopamine with10 µM SCH23390; response ratio, F(5,35) = 11.4, p < 0.001;
fast rhythm power, F(4,27) = 12.6, p < 0.001; slow
rhythm power, H(4) = 12.8, p = 0.013, Dunn’s post
hoc: p = 0.03; one way ANOVA used in tests).
These results suggest that the excitatory effects of
dopamine are primarily mediated by the D1-like
receptor family.
If D2 receptors form heteromers with D1
receptors, we would expect that antagonists
would inhibit, rather than excite responses. We
tested this idea by administering D2-like
antagonists (sulpiride + L745,870) and found that
the power of the fast rhythm elicited by dopamine
at 100 µM was reduced (Fig. 3 Aiii, Biii, Cii; n =
4; F(4,27) = 12.6, p < 0.001) to the same extent as
the D1-antagonist, with no effect on the power of
the slow rhythm (Fig. 3Ciii; H(4) = 12.8, p =
0.013; Dunn’s post hoc, p= 1.0). This suggests
that D2 receptors may contribute to the excitatory
effects of dopamine.

(10 µM). D. Response ratio represents the root mean square of raw neurograms during a 5-minute window, 20 minutes

To explore the interaction and coactivation profile of D1 and D2 receptors in
isolated neonatal spinal cords, we performed coimmunoprecipitation for D1 and D2 receptors and
used agonists to activate both receptor subtypes.

After immunoprecipitating D2 receptors from
neonatal spinal cord lysates, we used an antibody
to probe for D1 receptors. We detected D1
receptor protein within the D2 receptor
immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4Ciii) and these bands

were blocked when pre-incubated with an
antigen-blocking peptide. This result indicates
that D1 and D2 receptors form a protein complex
in neonatal mouse spinal cords.
In support of this idea, co-application of
the D1 agonist SKF 81297 (50 µM) and the D2
agonist quinpirole (50 µM) elicited a more robust
depolarization of the ventral root DC potential,
compared with 50 µM of the D1 agonist alone
(Fig. 4A, Ci; D1, n = 8; D1/D2, n = 8; one-way
ANOVA F(2,21) = 5.2, p = 0.01; Tukey post hoc: p
= 0.02). We observed no difference in the amount
of spontaneous network activity evoked with coapplication of a D2 agonist, compared with
application of the D1 agonist alone, as indicated
by the response ratio (Fig. 4B, Cii; one-way
ANOVA, F(3,29) = 12.0, p < 0.001; Tukey post
hoc, p = 0.5). In contrast, lower concentrations of
the same agonists (10 µM) produced no effects (n
= 8 for each condition; DC potential, t(6) = 0.73, p
= 0.24; response ratio, t(6) = 0.9, p = 0.19). Thus,
consistent with previous reports for striatal
neurons [36], we found a dose-dependent effect
of dopamine agonists wherein co-applying high
doses, but not low doses, of D1 and D2 receptor
agonists, produced more robust depolarization
than a D1 agonist alone.
In addition to co-applying separate D1
and D2 agonists, we tested co-activating D1 and
D2-like receptors with the D1/D2 co-agonist SKF
83959 (50 µM) [38,39]. As predicted, the coagonist elicited a more robust depolarization of
the ventral root DC potential, compared with the
D1 agonist, when applied alone (Fig. 4A, Ci; D1,
n = 8; D1/D2, n = 8; one-way ANOVA, F(2,21 ) =
5.2, p = 0.01; Tukey post hoc, p = 0.03).
Interestingly, the co-agonist also robustly
facilitated superimposed spontaneous activity, as
indicated by a larger response ratio than coapplication of the D1 and D2 agonists produced
(Fig. 4B, Cii; one-way ANOVA, F(3,29) = 12.0, p
< 0.001; Tukey post hoc, p = 0.004). These data
suggest that under certain conditions, D2
receptors that are typically inhibitory can play an
excitatory role via D1/D2 co-activation and

contribute to lumbar motor network excitation in
the neonatal mouse spinal cord.
Low levels of endogenous spinal dopamine
inhibit spontaneous activity
We next examined how the endogenous
dopamine system regulates perinatal spinal
network function. Endogenous levels of
dopamine were increased by blocking the
dopamine transporter (DAT) with an antagonist
GBR 12909 (10 µM). Blocking DAT (n = 8
preparations) produced a modest but significant
reduction in spontaneous activity compared to
time-matched vehicle controls, reflected by a
reduced response ratio (Fig. 5A, Bi; one-way
ANOVA, F(2,19) = 18.0, p < 0.001) and a reduced
number of spontaneous episodes (Fig. 5Bii; n =
8, two-way ANOVA, F(2,20) = 11.8, p = 0.0004),
with no change in amplitude (Fig. 5Biii; n = 6,
two-way ANOVA, F(2,20) = 1.3, p = 0.3). We
questioned whether extracellular dopamine
metabolism may have dampened the effect of the
reuptake blocker, thus diminishing the predicted
increase in endogenous dopamine levels.
Therefore, we repeated this experiment in the
presence of bifemelane, a monoamine oxidase A
& B inhibitor. Under these conditions, we found
further reductions in spontaneous activity when
DAT was blocked, as indicated by a significantly
reduced response ratio (Fig. 5Bi; n = 6, one-way
ANOVA, F(2,19) = 18.0, p < 0.001). Burst analysis
revealed significantly fewer episodes (Fig. 5Bii;
n = 6, two-way ANOVA, F(2,20) = 11.8, p =
0.0004) with no change in amplitude (Fig. 5Biii;
n = 6, two-way ANOVA, F(2,20) = 1.3, p = 0.3).
We followed these experiments up with highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to
verify endogenous levels of dopamine. In P3
lumbar spinal cords (n = 11) we detected low
levels of dopamine; in P60 adults (n = 17) we
detected a threefold increase in dopamine levels
(Fig. 5Biv; Mann–Whitney U = 10.0, T = 76, p <
0.001). Thus, our in vitro experiments indicated
that low levels of endogenous dopamine play a
role in D2-mediated inhibition.

D1 receptor activation increases motoneuron
excitability by reducing
afterhyperpolarization properties
In the next set of experiments, we were
interested in determining the cellular mechanisms

that mediate dopamine’s complex modulatory
effects on spinal network output. As integrators
of premotor network activity that generate many
of the rhythmic outputs of the spinal cord,
motoneurons are ideally suited to amplify

spontaneous
activity
and
respond
to
dopaminergic modulation. Given that they not
only serve as the final output for spinal networks,
but they also participate in the generation of
rhythmic activity [40], we initially selected
motoneurons as a locus for determining the
cellular mechanisms for dopaminergic excitation
and inhibition. We made whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings from 75 motoneurons (across 42
animals). Some of these motoneurons (n = 18
across seven animals) were filled with
fluorescein-conjugated dextran amine (FITC;
Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene Oregon) and
verified post hoc using immunohistochemistry
for the presence of choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT; Fig. 6A). One hundred percent of filled
cells were ChAT positive indicating that we were
indeed recording from motoneurons. Electrical
properties measured in a group of these cells (n =
8 cells across five animals) were comparable to
cells from putative motoneurons recorded in the
remaining experiments (Table 1) indicating that
these cells are also likely motoneurons.
Motoneurons also display characteristic timedependent changes in repetitive firing frequency
during sustained depolarizing current injections
(Fig. 6 Cii) [41–43]. We found that all but two
cells demonstrated a time-dependent reduction in
firing rate throughout the duration of a 0.5 s
depolarizing current injection, as indicated by the
ratio between maximum steady-state and first
spike interval frequencies. This phenomenon is
known as spike frequency adaptation (SFA; mean
SFA ratio = 0.47 ± 0.19). In addition, doublet
firing occurred at the onset of repetitive firing in
5 cells (8%).
Consistent with previous reports from
our laboratory [44,45] and with our network
recordings in this report, 100 µM of dopamine
increased motoneuron excitability (n = 5 cells

across four animals); we reproduced this effect
with the D1 agonist SKF 81297 (20 µM; n = 8
cells across five animals). Both 100 µM
dopamine and the D1 agonist depolarized the
membrane potential (Fig. 6Bi; H(2) = 18.9, p <
0.001), increased negative holding current
(vehicle, −7.1 ± 33 pA; DA, −247 ± 78 pA; D1,
−174 ± 49 pA; H(2) = 18.9, p = 0.001) and input
resistance (Fig. 6Bii; H(2) = 16.0, p < 0.001), and
decreased rheobase (Fig. 6Bii; F(2,22) = 5.0, p =
0.016) beyond that of the time-matched vehicle
control. We found no change in spike rise time
(F(2,22) = 1.0, p = 0.4) or half width (F(2,22) = 0.8, p
= 0.5). The D1 agonist reduced the amplitude of
the afterhyperpolarization (AHP); however, 100
µM dopamine did not reduce AHP amplitude
beyond that of a time-matched vehicle control
(Fig 6Biv; F(2,22) = 7.7, p = 0.003). Frequency–
current (FI) relationships were measured for
steady state and first spike interval during a series
of depolarizing current pulses (Fig. 6Ci). Both
100 µM dopamine and the D1 agonist reduced the
latency to first spike beyond that of the timematched vehicle control (Fig. 6Cii; F(2,17) = 9.6, p
= 0.002). Dopamine (100 µM) and the D1 agonist
increased the slope of the exponential region of
the FI relationship for the first spike interval (Fig.
6Di–Dii; F(2,22) = 8.4, p = 0.002) and reduced the
slope of the steady-state FI relationship (Fig.
6Diii–Div; H(2) = 9.4, p = 0.009). The reduction
in steady-state slope was due to a leftward shift in
steady-state FI relationship (Fig. 6Diii)
characterized by a reduction in the threshold for
repetitive firing (Fig. 6Ciii; H(2) = 14, p < 0.001)
with no change in the maximum steady-state
firing rate (H(2) = 1.4, p = 0.5). These results
indicate that activation of D1 receptors elicit
consistent effects as high concentrations of
dopamine on motoneuron excitability and is a
likely mechanism contributing to dopaminergic
excitation of motor output.

Dopaminergic inhibition through D2 - receptor
hyperpolarization of distributed populations
of ventral interneurons
We next set out to determine the cellular
mechanisms that mediate the inhibitory effects of
dopamine on spinal network output with
motoneurons as our first target. In contrast to our
network recordings, low concentrations of
dopamine (1–10 µM; n = 20 cells across 14
animals; Table 1) and the D2 agonist quinpirole
(20 µM; n = 12 cells across seven animals; Table
1) did not alter any passive, spike or repetitive
firing properties of motoneurons beyond that of
the time-matched vehicle control (n = 12 cells
across six animals). A lack of responsiveness was
not due to the diversity of motoneurons as there
was no correlation between cell capacitance and
changes in membrane potential or holding current
elicited by low concentrations of dopamine (r = 0.3, p = 0.13) or quinpirole (r = -0.1, p = 0.72).
These results suggest that the inhibitory actions
of dopamine on spinal network output are not due
to D2-receptor inhibition of intrinsic motoneuron
excitability; instead, dopamine may be acting on
premotor interneurons.
Many of the premotor interneurons that
produce the rhythmic activities generated by the
spinal cord are distributed across lamina’s VII X of the ventral lumbar spinal cord. We next
recorded from ventral interneurons located in
lamina VII–X to determine a cellular locus for
D2-mediated inhibition of spinal network output
(n = 30 cells across 17 animals; Table 2).
Quinpirole
produced
a
sustained
hyperpolarization of the resting membrane
potential in 33% of interneurons (Fig. 7B, C, Di;
n = 10; dVm = −4.8 ± 2.4 mV; two-way ANOVA,
F(2,37) = 26.1, p < 0.0001) and a transient
hyperpolarization of membrane potential in 10%
of interneurons (n = 3; dVm = −5.16 ± 1.9 mV)
that persisted for 209 ± 108 s before returning to
baseline levels. The change in resting membrane
potential was greater in the responders compared
to non-responders (dVm responders = - 4.8 ± 2.4
mV; dVm non-responders = 1.6 ± 1.9 mV;
unpaired t-test t(28) = 7.8, p < 0.0001). Quinpirole

reduced the input resistance (Fig. 7Dii; two-way
ANOVA, F(2,37) = 4.1, p = 0.025) and increased
the spike rise time (Fig. 7Div; two-way ANOVA,
F(2,35) = 5.2, p = 0.01; Dunn post hoc test, p=0.02)
but not the half width (F(2,35) = 2.6, p = 0.086) in
the group of responding interneurons
(“responders”). For both responders and non responders, quinpirole did not alter rheobase (Fig.
7Diii; two-way ANOVA, F(2,37) = 0.5, p = 0.6),
action potential threshold (two-way ANOVA,
F(2,37) = 0.3, p = 0.7), AHP amplitude (two-way
ANOVA, F(2,37) = 0.04, p = 0.96), duration (twoway ANOVA, F(2,37) = 0.8, p = 0.45), threshold
for repetitive firing (two-way ANOVA, F(2,37) =
0.01, p = 0.98), maximum steady-state firing rate
(Fig. 7Dvi; two-way ANOVA, F(3,37) = 0.8, p =
0.5 ) or steady-state FI slope (Fig. 7Dv: two-way
ANOVA, F(2,37) = 0.9, p = 0.4). The capacitance
(two-way ANOVA, F(2,37) = 4.2, p = 0.02) and
holding current (two-way ANOVA, F(2,37) = 4.9,
p = 0.02) were higher in responders than in non responders (Table 2) and a greater proportion of
responders were localized to more medial regions
of spinal slices (Fig. 7B), where putative
commissural interneurons reside [46].
We next set out to determine the type of
interneurons that were hyperpolarized by
quinpirole. Given that many of the responding
cells were located medially, we next targeted
descending commissural interneurons (dCINs; n
= 10 cells across five animals; Table 2) since this
population can be identified based on anatomical
connectivity [47,48], display intrinsic burst
properties [49] and are rhythmically-active
during
neurochemically-evoked
fictive
locomotion [50]. dCINs were retrogradely
labelled with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated
dextran amine (molecular weight (MW) 3000;
Molecular Probes, Inc.) inserted into the
ventrolateral funiculus at the L4 segment (Fig.
7A). In contrast to our hypothesis, only one dCIN
responded with a sustained hyperpolarization and
two were transiently hyperpolarized (Fig. 7B) by
quinpirole. Quinpirole did not alter any passive,
spike, or repetitive firing properties of dCINs (n
= 10; Fig. 7D). These data suggest that the dCINs,

A. Single ventral root (L5) neurogram of spontaneous activity after blocking the dopamine transporter (DAT) with
the DAT antagonist GBR 12909 (purple) to increase the endogenous dopamine level. Dopamine reuptake was also

Bi illustrates the response ratio; negative and positive values indicate inhibition and excitation, respectively. The
number below each bar represents the number of preparations for each experiment. Spontaneous episode occurrences
per minute (Bii) and amplitude (Biii) were measured within the epochs where the response ratio was calculated.
Histograms present mean values ± SD and asterisks indicate a significance level of post hoc analyses (*p < 0.05, **p

liquid chromatography.

although responsive in similar proportions to our
global interneuron survey, do not exclusively
account for the 33% responding group and,
therefore, are likely, not responsible for the
observed network effects. Interestingly, when all
interneuron data were pooled (n = 40 cells),
irrespective of responsiveness as indicated by
changes in resting membrane potential,
quinpirole had the greatest effect in cells that had
a higher maximum steady-state firing rate at
baseline (Fig. 7DViii; r = −0.37, p = 0.026). There
was no correlation between baseline FI slope and
changes in FI slope in response to quinpirole (r =

−0.09, p = 0.6). While dCINs can be identified
anatomically, they are heterogeneous with
respect to their neurotransmitter phenotype [51]
and as a result have varying contributions to
network activities [46,50,52].
We therefore next targeted V3
interneurons
which
are
exclusively
glutamatergic, contribute to the stabilization of
locomotor-like rhythmicity and can be identified
genetically based on the expression of the Sim1
transcription factor [53].

Figure 6: High concentrations of dopamine and D1 agonists increase motoneuron excitability
A. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from motoneurons visualized with infrared differential

(FITC, green) and verified post hoc with immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, red). B–D. High
concentrations of dopamine (100 µM, green) and the D 1 agonist SKF 81297 (20 µM, purple) increased motoneuron
excitability by modulating various passive, spike, and repetitive firing properties. All measures were compared to that
of time-matched vehicle control (grey). Ci. A typical motoneuron trace following current injection. Di, Diii display

be a cellular locus for D2-mediated inhibition of
spinal network activity.
Consistent with our global interneuron
survey, quinpirole produced a sustained
hyperpolarization of the resting membrane
potential in a proportion of V3 interneurons (n=5
cells; 27%) that we recorded from (total V3
interneurons n=23 cells, 7 animals) and transient
hyperpolarization in 3 (13%) V3 interneurons.
The magnitude of the response in the 5 cells that
responded with a sustained hyperpolarization was
variable and approached, but did not reach,
significance (Supp Figure 1; paired t-test: t(4)=
2.5, p = 0.06); however, did reach significance
when the cells that responded with a transient
hyperpolarization were included in the analysis
(paired t-test: t(6) = 2.7, p = 0.03). Consistent with
our global interneuron survey the change in
resting membrane potential elicited by quinpirole
was significantly greater in responding (n = 5;
dVm = -1.9 ± 1.9 mV) compared to nonresponding (n = 15; dVm = -0.3 ± 1.0 mV) V3
interneurons (unpaired t-test: t(16) = 3.8, p =
0.002).

Discussion
Dopamine
is
a
monoamine
neuromodulator that is important for the control
of rhythmically active motor circuits across phyla
(reviewed by [8]) but is probably best known in
vertebrates for the control of dedicated circuits in
the basal ganglia that control action selection
(reviewed by [57]). Work in small circuits of
invertebrates has established that circuit
connectomes define the constraints on which
networks operate and that neuromodulators
diversify outputs by altering intrinsic and
synaptic properties of the neurons that compose
the circuit (for reviews see [1–3]. In line with this,
the distribution of receptors within circuits
constrain the effect of neuromodulators on circuit
output. For example, dopamine is exclusively
inhibitory in spinal circuits of Xenopus tadpoles
prior to free-swimming stages [58] due to
expression of D2 but not D1 receptors. We show

that
dopamine
has
has
bidirectional
concentration-dependent effects on spinal
network output in neonatal mice where all
dopamine receptor types are expressed which is
consistent with what has been reported in
tadpoles at free swimming-stages [12]. Our data
highlights that neuromodulator concentration is
also important because receptors have varying
ligand affinities which underlie concentrationdependent actions of modulators. Although
dopamine predominantly inhibits spinal output in
neonatal mice, similar to pre-free-swimming
tadpoles, it is primarily due to the concentration
of spinal dopamine, not the distribution of
receptors. Our previous work shows that
neuromodulation of mammalian spinal networks
is dependent on network excitability state [13]
which is consistent with findings from
invertebrates [14,15]. Our current work shows
that receptor mechanisms and concentrationdependent control of spinal network output is also
state-dependent. This is important because
receptor expression, modulator concentration and
network excitability are not fixed and fluctuate
dynamically [59,60]. Therefore, these three
factors need to be considered if we wish to
understand how networks create diverse
neuromodulator-dependent outputs (Figure 8A).
A physiologically silent excitatory D1 pathway?
Previous work has shown predominantly
excitatory D1-receptor mediated effects of
dopamine on fictive locomotion which is
characteristic of the network operating in a high
excitability state [13] - albeit in these studies,
higher concentrations of dopamine are necessary
to elicit observable effects [20–25]. Here, we
show that endogenous levels of dopamine within
the spinal cord of neonatal mice are low. Even
though HPLC suggests low concentrations of
dopamine in the neonatal spinal cord, a critical
question that we addressed is what would happen
when we manipulated endogenous dopamine?
We accomplished this by blocking dopamine
reuptake and metabolism and found that the
effects were not excitatory, but inhibitory.

Based on this, we suggest that although
present, the excitatory D1-mediated pathway is
‘physiologically silent’ during early postnatal
stages given that endogenous levels are not
sufficient to activate this pathway. A similar
phenomenon has been reported for glutamatergic
synapses in developing circuits of the
hippocampus which express NMDA but not
AMPA receptors. As a result, glutamatergic
synapses fall ‘physiologically silent’ as the
release of glutamate does not produce sufficient
depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane to
remove the magnesium block from the pore of the
NMDA channel [61,62].

Excitability state also influences the
receptor
mechanisms
and
therefore
concentration-dependent control of modulators
on network output. In the spinal cord, D1
pathways may be more important for the
regulation of spinal circuits operating in higher
excitability states. For example, fictive locomotor
rhythms are drastically impacted when D1
receptors are manipulated whereas manipulation
of D2 receptors elicit only subtle changes in
rhythm frequency, with rhythm robustness being
maintained [23] (Figure 8Bii.). In the adult
animal; however, network excitability increases,
and spinal dopamine levels are higher due to
increases in descending inputs. In line with this,

Sharples et al., 2019 | Dopaminergic control of spinal networks

optogenetic activation of the dopaminergic A11
leads to an increase in motor activity [63].
Similarly, the excitatory D1 system is more
important for the control of stepping movements
whereas the inhibitory D2 system plays less of a
role [22,64]. Instead, the inhibitory D2 pathway
may be more important in maintaining network
quiescence during periods of immobility such as
has been inferred network excitability are low,
that inhibition of motor output prevails (Figure
8Bii.).
Thus, this points to the receptor- specific
and therefore concentration-dependent control of
modulators on network output being strongly
influenced by the state of the network on which
they are acting.
Dedicated network components segregate
excitatory and inhibitory control of spinal
networks
Dedicated circuits regulated by non-overlapping
populations of neurons that express D1 and D2
receptors compose the direct and indirect
pathways of the basal ganglia in vertebrates and
have also been reported in the superior colliculus
of rodents [65]. Our work suggests dedicated
network elements within the spinal cord that are
regulated by D1 and D2 pathways (Figure 8Biii.).
Specifically, we found that D1 receptors excite
motoneurons through similar mechanisms that
have been previously reported [44,45], but are not
affected by low concentrations of dopamine or D2
agonists. This points to the possibility of a
dedicated D1-dependent circuit that could
underlie the generation of rhythmic activities
elicited by high concentrations of dopamine.
Motoneurons compose key rhythm generating
elements in invertebrate circuits [66–68] and also
participate in rhythm generation in vertebrates
[69], including rodents [32,40,56,70,71]. V3
interneurons are one subclass of geneticallydefined spinal interneuron that are important for
the generation of rhythmic activities in
mammalian spinal networks [53,55,72] and
receive recurrent excitatory collaterals from
motoneurons in rodents [32]. Motoneurons in the

rodent spinal cord also form glutamatergic
synaptic connections amongst each other [71] and
activation of D1 receptors could serve to
synchronize motor pools. Previous results
demonstrating D1- and not D2-mediated increases
in AMPA conductances on motoneurons [45]
support this possibility. We cannot rule out the
possibility that there is a degree of overlap
between D1 and D2 controlled network elements
within the spinal cord. While we did not examine
the D1 control of ventral interneurons, we did find
that D2 receptors hyperpolarize a subset of V3
interneurons. This population is therefore a
potential cellular locus where cooperative
excitatory D1-D2 interactions that we report here
could occur. D1 and D2 receptors have been
reported in the brain to become co-activated or
form heterodimeric complexes that augment
neuronal excitability through PLC-dependent
increases in intracellular calcium [35–38]. Our
pharmacological and immunoprecipitation data
indicate that this may also occur in the neonatal
mouse spinal cord. Although this pathway may be
physiologically silent during early postnatal
development,
increasing
dopamine
concentrations at later stages may activate this
pathway.
The inhibitory D2 pathway on the other
hand does not appear to act through the
modulation of motoneuron intrinsic or synaptic
properties [45] but instead hyperpolarizes a
proportion of ventral interneurons. Based on our
responsiveness criteria, a majority of cells that
responded to a D2 agonist with sustained
hyperpolarization of the membrane potential
were localized more medially in lumbar slices.
We tested the hypothesis that a subpopulation of
interneurons was D2 sensitive and tested both
dCINs
and
genetically
identified
V3
interneurons. Our hypothesis was not supported,
and similar proportions of D2 sensitive neurons
were found; however, the data suggest that there
is heterogeneity in the responsiveness to
neuromodulators within a class of genetically
defined interneurons and that D2 actions may not
be localized to a particular class of interneurons.

Figure 7: D2 agonists hyperpolarize a proportion of ventral interneurons.
Whole-cell recordings obtained from lamina VII–X interneurons. Ai. Descending commissural interneurons (dCINs)
were retrogradely labelled with rhodamine-conjugated dextran amine crystals inserted into the ventrolateral funiculus
at L4 level. Aii. Cells were visualized in transverse lumbar slices under infrared differential interference contrast (IRDIC) or epifluorescent illumination. B. Ventral interneuron location was measured relative to the central canal and XY positions normalized to the distance of ventral and lateral borders of lumbar slices. C. Whole-cell current-clamp
recordings depict responsiveness of interneuron resting membrane potential to the D2 agonist (quinpirole, 20 µM) in
responders, non - responders, and dCINs. A proportion of ventral interneurons responded to quinpirole with either a
sustained (B, red and green dots) or transient (B, blue dots) hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. A reduction
in input resistance and increase in spike rise time accompanied hyperpolarization in sustained responders ….

Figure 8: Dopamine exerts state and receptor-dependent control of spinal motor networks.
A. Neural network output is dependent on multiple factors. Circuit connectomes and intrinsic properties defining
constraints of a network output. Similarly, the distribution of neuromodulator receptors defines the constraints on
which neuromodulators can alter these properties. Varying ligand affinities of these receptors determine dosedependent effect of neuromodulators and network state dictates the dose-dependent effects of neuromodulators. Bi.
Previous work has demonstrated that tonic and phasic firing patterns of dopamine cells lead to the release of low and
high concentrations of dopamine, respectively [10]. Bii. During a low excitability state (blue part of the circle), low
concentrations of dopamine (denoted by the green gradient) acted on D2, D3, D4 and α2-adrenergic receptors in parallel
to inhibit (parallel stop lines) spinal motor output. As dopamine levels rise, activation of D1 and co-activation of D2
receptors increase (arrowheads) spinal network output. During a high excitability state (orange part of the circle), the
actions of low dopamine are not apparent and at higher concentrations, activation of D 1 receptors boost …

… spinal network output and activation of D2 receptors slows rhythmic activity [13]. Biii. Higher concentrations of
dopamine act through D1 receptors to increase motoneuron excitability by reducing A-type and SKCa-dependent
calcium conductance. D2-mediated inhibition of spinal network output is triggered by reduced excitability in a
proportion of ventral interneurons (red cells).

One possibility is that neuromodulators
elicit a robust effect on network output through
distributed control across multiple classes of
genetically-defined interneurons which would be
consistent with findings that the locomotor
rhythm generator is also distributed across
several classes of interneurons [73–75]. Our
network data suggests that low concentrations of
dopamine inhibit network output by acting in
parallel on D2, D3, D4 and ɑ2 receptors. We may
therefore have underestimated the cellular targets
that underlie dopamine’s robust inhibitory effect
on the network given that in this series of
experiments we looked at the activation of D2
receptors alone.
Developmental considerations for the
endogenous dopaminergic system
This robust inhibitory system may act as
a brake on network activity during perinatal
development when chloride-mediated synaptic
transmission still causes partial depolarization
[76]. An inhibitory brake would prevent runaway
excitation of spinal network activity during this
critical period of development. A robust
background inhibitory system mediated by the
parallel inhibitory action of D2, D3, D4, and α2adrenergic receptors activated by low levels of
endogenous dopamine would counteract
depolarizing chloride-mediated transmission.
Signalling through [76] D2-like receptors
may also play a role in driving the maturation of
spinal networks. In larval zebrafish, D4 receptors
drive the maturation of spinal locomotor network
organization [77] and function leading to changes
in locomotor behaviour [78]. Similar processes
may also occur perinatally in rodents, in that the
preferential activation of the D2 receptor system
may favour intracellular signalling that results in
network reorganization. Serotonin receptors have

been found to shape network function and
inhibitory synaptic transmission during early
postnatal days of rodents [79,80]. Dopamine
could, therefore, act analogously via the D2system during perinatal development.
Conclusions
Here we present evidence for an
inhibitory physiological role of dopamine in the
regulation of developing mammalian spinal
networks. We also demonstrate an excitatory D1mediated pathway that acts through excitation of
motoneurons, and possibly recurrent excitatory
collaterals to CPG neurons, however given that
endogenous levels of dopamine are low, propose
that this pathway is physiologically silent. These
data advance our understanding of how
neuromodulators regulate network output in light
of
dynamically
changing
modulator
concentrations and levels of network excitability.

Methods
Ethical approval & animals
Experiments were performed on male and female neonatal (P0–P4, n = 262) and adult (P50, n
= 17) C57BL/6 mice. A subset of experiments were performed on spinal cord slices obtained from
neonatal (P0-4, n=7) Sim1Cre/+; Rosafloxstop26TdTom which were used to visualize and record from V3
interneurons. All procedures performed were approved by the University of Calgary Health Sciences
Animal Care Committee University Committee on Laboratory Animals at Dalhousie University.
Tissue preparation
We anesthetized all animals by hypothermia. Pups were decapitated and eviscerated to expose
the vertebral column and rib cage. The isolated vertebrae and rib cage were transferred to a dish lined
with a silicone elastomer (Sylgard; DowDuPont, Midland, MI) and perfused with room-temperature
(21 - 23oC) carbogenated (95% O2 / 5% CO2) aCSF (in mM, 4 KCl, 128 NaCl, 1 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.5
Na2HPO4, 21 NaHCO3, 30 ᴅ-glucose; 310–315 mOsm.). We exposed the spinal cord with a ventral
laminectomy and isolated it by cutting the nerve roots that connected it to the vertebral column. The
isolated spinal cord was then transferred to a recording chamber, perfused with carbogenated aCSF, and
placed ventral side up. The bath temperature was gradually increased to 27°C [81]. We let the spinal
cords stabilize for 1 hour before performing experiments.
Spinal cord slice preparation
Following isolation, spinal cords were transected above the tenth thoracic (T10) and below the
first sacral (S1) segments and transferred to a slicing chamber. Pre-warmed liquefied 20% gelatin was
used to secure cords to an agar (3%) block that was super-glued to the base of a cutting chamber and
immersed in ice-cold, carbogenated, high-sucrose slicing aCSF (in mM, 25 NaCl, 188 sucrose, 1.9 KCl,
10 Mg SO4, 1.2 Na2HPO4, 26 NaHCO3; 25 D-Glucose; 340 mOsm). Using a vibratome (Leica,
Bussloch, Germany) we cut 250-µm-thick lumbar slices, collected and transferred them to a recovery
chamber containing regular carbogenated aCSF (see Tissue Preparation) heated to 32oC for one hour,
then maintained them at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before transferring them to a recording
chamber.
Labelling of descending commissural interneurons (dCINs)
We retrogradely labelled dCINs by inserting tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dextran amine
crystals (MW 3000; Molecular Probes, Inc.) into a cut in the ventrolateral funiculus at the L4 segment.
Spinal cords recovered for 4 hours to allow retrograde uptake of the fluorescent dye. Fluorescentlylabelled cells were visualized with epifluorescent illumination.
Electrophysiological recordings
Extracellular neurograms were recorded by drawing ventral roots of the second (L2) and fifth
(L5) lumbar segments into tight-fitting suction electrodes fashioned from polyethylene tubing (PE50).
Signals were amplified 1000× in total via 10× pre-amplification and 100× second-stage amplification
(Cornerstone EX4-400 Quad Differential Amplifier; Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN). Amplified
signals were band-pass filtered (0.1–1000 Hz) and digitized at 2.5 kHz (Digidata 1440A/1550B;
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were acquired in Clampex 10.4/10.7 software (Molecular
Devices) and saved on a Dell computer for offline analysis. All experiments were performed on spinal
cords naïve to drugs and experimental treatment.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
Spinal cord slices were gently transferred to a recording chamber perfused with roomtemperature carbogenated recording aCSF (in mM, 128 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.0 MgSO4, 0.5

Na2HPO4, 21 NaHCO3, 30 ᴅ-glucose; approximately 310 mOsm) and stabilized in the recording dish
with a stainless-steel harp. We gradually heated aCSF to 27°C. Slices were visualized (Olympus
BX51WI; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) under 5× magnification and putative motoneurons
identified using a 40× objective with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) illumination.
We identified putative motoneurons based on their location in the ventrolateral spinal cord and a soma
diameter of greater than 20 µm. A cohort of motoneurons was passively filled with fluorescein dextran
amine (FITC; MW 3000; 200μM; Molecular Probes, Inc.) added to the intracellular solution to visualize
and localize the recorded cells, for 20–60 minutes and motoneuron identity was verified post hoc by
performing immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). To verify motoneuron
identity in subsequent experiments, basal biophysical properties of putative motoneurons were
compared with the FITC-filled ChAT-positive cells. We identified no differences in basal biophysical
properties of ChAT-positive identified cells, compared with cells in other experiments identified by
position and size (Table 1). In one set of experiments, we recorded from ventral interneurons in lamina
VII–X, descending commissural interneurons (dCINs) and V3 interneurons of the lumbar spinal cord
(Table 2). We measured the distance of each interneuron from the central canal (LinLab2; Scientifica,
Uckfield, UK) and normalized position, relative to lateral and ventral borders, and plotted the
normalized positions on a template transverse spinal cord. Responsiveness was determined by the
change in resting membrane potential. All experiments were performed on one cell per slice to ensure
that all cells were naïve to treatment.
Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary tubes (O.D. = 1.5mm, I.D. = 0.86 mm)
using a Flaming/Brown Model P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Pipettes
pulled to record from motoneurons, and interneurons were within the range of 3–5 MΩ and 6–9 MΩ,
respectively. Pipettes were backfilled with intracellular solution (in mM, 130 K-gluconate, 0.1 EGTA,
10 HEPES, 7 NaCl, 0.3 MgCl2, 2 ATP, 0.5 GTP, 5 phosphocreatine; 280 mOsm). Intracellular solutions
were balanced to a pH of 7.3 with 10 M KOH and osmolality was cross-checked to fall within the range
of 275–290 mOsm. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using Clampex software (PClamp 10.4; Molecular
Devices).
We examined intrinsic properties of motoneurons and ventral interneurons and terminated
experiments if access resistance was greater than 25 MΩ for motoneurons and 35 MΩ for interneurons,
if cells had a resting membrane potential greater than −50 mV, or if action potential amplitude was less
than 60 mV at baseline. Cells were excluded from analysis if access resistance deviated by more than
20% by the end of the recording. We held all cells at a membrane potential of approximately −75 mV
during experiments, after correcting for a liquid junction potential of 14.3 mV. The liquid junction
potential was calculated in Clampfit (PClamp 10.4; Molecular Devices), using the ionic composition of
our extracellular and intracellular solutions. Protocols for the examination of intrinsic properties have
been described elsewhere [82].
Pharmacology
Dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was bath applied in separate
experiments at 1 µM, 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, and 300 µM to determine dose-dependent effects
on motor activity. The receptor-selective agonists we used included SKF 81297 for D1-like receptors
(10–50 µM; Tocris, Minneapolis, MN); quinpirole for D2-like receptors (10–50 µM; Tocris); and the
D1/D2 receptor co-agonist SKF 83959 (10–50 µM; Tocris). For dopamine receptor antagonists we used
the D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 (10 µM; Tocris); the D2-like antagonists sulpiride (20 µM) and L741,626 (12 µM); the selective D3 receptor antagonist SB 27701A (5 µM; Tocris); the selective D4
receptor antagonist L-745, 870 (5 µM; Tocris). We also used the α2 adrenergic receptor antagonist,
yohimbine (2–4 µM; Tocris). Endogenous dopamine levels were manipulated with the DAT inhibitor
GBR-12909 (10 µM; Hello Bio, Princeton, NJ) and the monoamine oxidase A & B inhibitor bifemelane
(50 µM; Tocris).

Immunoprecipitation for D1 and D2 receptors
Spinal cords were dissected in ice-cold (4–8ºC) aCSF and homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 50 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X, and 5% Glycerol. Lysis
buffer contained protease inhibitors (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitors (GBiosciences). We
homogenized three spinal cords in 100 µL of buffer and incubated them on ice for 1 hour before
centrifuging them at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4ºC. Lysates were then extracted and stored at −20
ºC.
To reduce nonspecific binding, we first incubated lysates in anti-rabbit Ig agarose beads
(Trueblot; Rockland Inc., Limerick, PA) for 30 minutes, on ice and in the absence of primary antibody.
We then removed the supernatant and incubated the lysates on ice for 1 hour with rabbit antibody to D2
receptors (1 μg per 100 μL, Millipore). Anti-rabbit Ig IP beads were added and samples were incubated
overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, heated in
loading buffer (350 mM Tris, 30% glycerol, 1.6% SDS, 1.2% bromophenol blue, 6% βmercaptoethanol) to 95°C for 10 min, electrophoresed on a precast SDS gel (4–12% Tris HCl; BioRad,
Hercules, CA), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were
incubated with guinea pig antibody to D1 receptors (1:400; Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) and rabbit
antibody to D2 receptors (1:500; Millipore, Burlington, MA), washed, incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (IRDye anti-guinea pig and Trueblot antirabbit IgG DyLight, 1:1000), and visualized via antibody fluorescence at 680 or 800 nm (Odyssey CLx;
LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
Post hoc verification of motoneurons
Following the completion of experimental protocols, we post-fixed slices overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4ºC, washed them the next morning in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
three 20-minute intervals, and stored them at 4ºC. On the day we performed immunohistochemistry, we
first washed the slices for 30 minutes (3 × 10 minutes) in PBS with 0.5% Triton-X 100 (PBST) then
incubated them at room temperature (21 -23ºC) for 6 hours in blocking solution containing 10% donkey
serum in 0.5% PBST. Primary antibodies for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (1:500; goat anti-ChAT;
Millipore Cat No. AB144) and the fluorescence marker (1:1000; rabbit anti-FITC, ThermoFisher Cat
No. 11090) were diluted in blocking solution and the slices incubated with them for at least 24 hours at
room temperature. Slices were then washed in PBST (0.5%) for 80 minutes (4 × 20 min) at room
temperature before secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 1:1000, Life Technologies
Cat No. A-21206; Donkey anti-Goat Alexa 568 1:1000; Cat No. A21447, Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) were applied for 4–8 hours at room temperature, then washed for 80 minutes in PBST (0.5%).
Slices were mounted and coverslipped with fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); coverslips were separated from slides by 500 μm spacers to prevent
crushing.
Imaging
All sections processed via immunohistochemistry were imaged on a Nikon A1R MP+
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) operating in confocal mode with a 16× water-immersion objective
lens (numerical aperture [NA] = 0.8, working distance [WD] = 3 mm). Image acquisition used a z-step
of 1 µm and averaged two frames with a resolution of 2048 × 2048. Pixel dwell time was 2.5 ms and
exposure settings were maintained for all sections. We used NIS-Elements software (Nikon) for image
acquisition and ImageJ to perform maximum intensity projections of z-stacks.
High-performance liquid chromatography
Monoamine content of neonatal and adult spinal cords was measured using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). We dissected spinal cords from neonatal (P3, n = 11) C57BL/6 mice

in aCSF as described above and extracted adult spinal cords (P60, n = 17) with a pressure ejection
method. Tissue was then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, stored at −80ºC, and analyzed for biogenic
amines with a modified version of the Parent et al. HPLC method [76]. Tissue was homogenized in icecold 0.1 M perchloric acid. We centrifuged the homogenate and used 10 μl of supernatant in the assay,
employing an Atlantis dC18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) and an electrochemical detector.
Data analysis
We determined the relative inhibitory or excitatory effects of dopamine and dopamine receptor
agonists on spontaneous motor network activity using methods similar to those in our previous work
[23]: we calculated a response ratio from single ventral root neurograms between the root mean square
of 5 minutes of basal spontaneous activity and 5 minutes of activity recorded 20 minutes after adding
the drug. We subtracted 1 from the response ratio so that positive values reflect excitation and negative
values reflect inhibition. The response ratio was used as a high throughput assay to detect global changes
in network activity. Neurogram data were analyzed with Spike2 software. Bursts of spontaneous
activity were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) to determine how episode number and
amplitude contributed to changes in response ratio. Spectral analyses were conducted using Spinalcore
software [83] whenever we detected excitatory changes or observed rhythmicity.
Patterns of rhythmic motor activity recorded from single ventral roots were analyzed with autowavelet
spectral analysis. We created and analyzed frequency–power spectrograms by selecting regions of
interest around frequency ranges that coincided with those in the raw neurogram. The spectrograms
revealed two high power regions that reflect distinct rhythms evoked by dopamine at high
concentrations: a slow 0.01–0.04 Hz rhythm and a fast 0.8–1.2 Hz rhythm. Regions of interest were
selected within these frequency ranges and analyzed over the time course of each experiment.
Frequency power within selected regions of interest that corresponded to the fast and slow rhythms
were used as a measure of rhythm robustness. Data were segmented into 30 s bins and averaged over
5-minute intervals for statistical analysis. We used tools available in Spinalcore for all analyses of
rhythmic motor activity [83], consistent with Sharples and Whelan [13].
Motoneuron and interneuron intrinsic properties measured during whole-cell patch-clamp
experiments were analyzed as in our previous work [82,84], with the exception of repetitive firing
analyses, which examined the instantaneous firing rate for the first spike interval and steady-state firing
separately.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated measures. We tested for differences in the magnitude of effects
between conditions with one-way ANOVAs, focusing on comparisons to time-matched vehicle
controls. Two-way ANOVAs compared baseline to multiple post-drug conditions. All effects
surpassing a significance threshold of p < 0.05 were further examined with post hoc analyses. We used
Holm-Sidak post hoc tests to compare all treatment conditions to the appropriate normalized timematched vehicle control. Data that violated assumptions of normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) or equal
variance (Brown–Forsythe test) were analysed via nonparametric Mann–Whitney U (if two groups) or
Kruskal–Wallis (if more than two groups) tests.
