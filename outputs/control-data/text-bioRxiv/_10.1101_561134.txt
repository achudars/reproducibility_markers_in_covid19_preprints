Abstract

27

Mitochondria have long been implicated in Parkinson’s disease, ever since the discovery that

28

inhibitors of the mitochondrial complex I can lead to dopaminergic neuron death. We report

29

here that intra‐mitochondrial protein degradation alleviates (PFF)‐induced alpha‐synuclein

30

seeding, highly relevant for the spreading of alpha‐synuclein pathology. We find that

31

interference with mitochondrial protein import as well as intra‐mitochondrial proteases

32

aggravates the aggregation profile and indeed, alpha‐synuclein shows themselves as intra‐

33

mitochondrial protein. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial protein degradation is

34

relevant for the aggregation of Abeta 42, suggesting that mitochondria are directly linked to

35

disturbances in cytosolic protein homeostasis of aggregation prone proteins. Taken together,

36

this draws a new picture of how mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in neurodegenerative

37

diseases and provokes new therapeutical approaches.

Introduction

51
52

Mitochondria have long been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD), ever since the discovery

53

that inhibitors of the mitochondrial complex I can lead to dopaminergic neuron death

54

(Langston et al, 1983; Burns et al, 1983; Betarbet et al, 2000; Greenamyre et al, 2001; Sherer

55

et al, 2003). Furthermore, mutation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)‐induced

56

kinase 1 (PINK1) or parkin, leading to failure of mitophagy, link mitochondrial dysfunction and

57

familial PD. A connection between both, alpha‐synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial

58

dysfunction, is suggested by recent studies highlighting that alpha‐synuclein aggregation is

59

increased in PINK1 and parkin mutant iPS‐cells and parkin transgenic mice (Chung et al, 2016;

60

Lu et al, 2009).

61
62

An important factor influencing PD pathophysiology is the fact that alpha‐synuclein

63

aggregates can spread from cell to cell, which has been described as prion‐like behavior

64

(Kordower & Brundin, 2009; Stopschinski & Diamond, 2017). Indeed, also in vitro small fibrillar

65

seeds, constituting misfolded alpha‐synuclein, transfer from one cell to another and induce

66

aggregation of normally folded endogenous alpha‐synuclein (Luk et al, 2009; Pinotsi et al,

67

2016). Since the seeding of alpha‐synuclein is understood as a driving force for disease

68

progression, we here aimed to investigate if mitochondrial dysfunction and which

69

mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in particular influence the alpha‐synuclein seeding

70

propensity.

71
72

Using the preformed fibril (PFF)‐induced alpha‐synuclein aggregation model we show that

73

mitochondrial dysfunction clearly aggravated PFF‐induced seeding, however an artificial

74

increase in cytosolic calcium, oxidative stress or inhibition of complex I were not able to

75

reproduce the enhanced seeding of alpha‐synuclein. We demonstrate that the seeding

76

propensity is dependent on intra‐mitochondrial proteostasis, and identified that the high

77

temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2), a mitochondrial intermembrane protease, and

78

mitochondrial protein import are crucial in determining the level of alpha‐synuclein seeding.

79

We further show that alpha‐synuclein is found in mitochondria, supporting our hypothesis

80

that mitochondria play an important role in alpha‐synuclein degradation.

Results

84
85

The preformed fibril (PFF) model mimics alpha‐synuclein seeding in disease

86
87

The seeding of alpha‐synuclein aggregation was modelled by the preformed fibril (PFF) assay

88

as initially developed by Luk et al. (Luk et al, 2009), and proved to be of substantial use in

89

studying alpha‐synuclein aggregation in vitro as well as in vivo (Pinotsi et al, 2016; Luk et al,

90

2009, 2012; Peelaerts et al, 2015; Thakur et al, 2017). Here, SH‐SY5Y cells overexpressing YFP‐

91

alpha‐synuclein were incubated for 4 hours with PFFs made from unlabeled human

92

recombinant alpha‐synuclein (Supplementary Fig. 1), and cultured for another 3 days to allow

93

seeding of alpha‐synuclein aggregation (Fig. 1A). While YFP‐alpha‐synuclein overexpressing

94

cells per se not display any Lewy‐body‐like inclusions, fine filamentous inclusions build up from

95

YFP‐alpha‐synuclein are seen by structured illumination microscopy (SIM) upon PFF

96

incubation (Fig. 1B). This model system reflects a late disease state in which the seeds for

97

aggregation are already present and thus has a particular focus on factors influencing alpha‐

synuclein seeding. YFP‐alpha‐synuclein inclusions stain positive for ubiquitin and p62, which

99

are both characteristic markers found in Lewy bodies of human disease (Luk et al, 2009) (Fig.

100

1C and D).

101
102
103

Mitochondrial dysfunction increases alpha‐synuclein seeding

104
105

From our previous study, we have seen that alpha‐synuclein strongly interacts with calcium,

106

leading to conformational changes at the calcium binding domain at the C‐terminus, but also

107

at the NAC‐region, which suggests a potential influence of calcium on the aggregation

108

propensity of alpha‐synuclein. Consistently, increased calcium significantly aggravated alpha‐

109

synuclein nucleation in vitro (Lautenschläger et al, 2018). However surprisingly, when cells

110

were treated with BAPTA‐AM, a well‐known specific calcium chelator, PFF‐induced alpha‐

111

synuclein seeding was drastically increased (Fig. 2A). This is in contrast to what has been

112

expected, since BAPTA‐AM is supposed to decrease cytosolic calcium and was reported

113

previously to alleviate KCl‐induced alpha‐synuclein aggregation (Follett et al, 2013). In our

114

study, we found that BAPTA‐AM did decrease cytosolic calcium in the SH‐SY5Y cells, but only

115

transiently. The effect was already compensated for treatments of 1 hour and 5 hours (Fig.

116

2B), suggesting that the effect on alpha‐synuclein seeding is mediated via a different pathway.

117

Both the ester form BAPTA, BAPTA‐AM, as well as the active BAPTA itself did not increase the

118

aggregation of alpha‐synuclein in vitro (t50 125.6+/‐8.6 and 122.6+/‐7.2 vs. 116.6+/‐11.1) (Fig.

119

2C), indicating that the effect of BAPTA in the PFF assay results from a cellular response. In

120

fact, we found that BAPTA‐AM had a direct impact on mitochondria, inducing organelle

121

fragmentation as determined by SIM imaging (Fig. 2D). This cellular response upon BAPTA‐AM

122

treatment is related to an increase of ER‐dependent mitochondrial fission and has been

123

reported previously (Friedman et al, 2011).

124
125

This led us to hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction per se could influence alpha‐

126

synuclein seeding. Indeed, also carbonyl cyanide 4‐(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone

127

(FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler that dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential and

128

thus leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased YFP‐alpha‐synuclein seeding (Fig. 2E).

129

Similarly, FCCP did not increase alpha‐synuclein aggregation in vitro (t50 117.0+/‐9.8 vs.

130

115.6+/‐10.1), confirming that its effect in the PFF assay was the result of a cellular response

131

rather than a direct interaction of the two (Fig.2F).

132
133

Classical downstream effectors of mitochondrial dysfunction are unable to influence alpha‐

134

synuclein seeding

135
136

Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to culminate in complex I inhibition, cytosolic calcium

137

increase and oxidative stress, therefore we artificially mimicked these downstream effectors

138

of mitochondrial dysfunction. 1‐methyl‐4‐phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of

139

1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1,2,3,6‐tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to inhibit complex I of the

140

electron transport chain, ionomycin, an ionophore, was used to increase cytosolic calcium

141

concentration via calcium influx through the plasma membrane, and menadione was used to

142

induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via redox‐cycling (Criddle et al, 2006). These

143

chemicals were applied during the incubation with PFFs, and also during the 3 day incubation

144

until seeding was evaluated. However, none of these treatments provoked increased YFP‐

145

alpha‐synuclein seeding (Fig. 3A). Measuring cytosolic ATP levels, calcium levels and ROS

146

generation we show that treatment with MPP+, menadione and ionomycin led to either higher

147

or comparable levels of ATP, calcium or ROS, respectively, than after treatment with either

148

FCCP or BAPTA‐AM, suggesting that complex I inhibition, cytosolic calcium increase and

149

oxidative stress do not aggravate alpha‐synuclein seeding per se (Fig. 3B and C).

150
151
152

Inhibition of HtrA2 increases alpha‐synuclein seeding

153
154

The effect of BAPTA‐AM on alpha‐synuclein seeding was more pronounced compared to FCCP,

155

since one hour pre‐incubation with BAPTA‐AM already aggravated alpha‐synuclein seeding,

156

however not the one hour pre‐incubation with FCCP (Fig. 2A and 2E). Though, FCCP treatment

157

led to increased mitochondrial fragmentation compared to BAPTA‐AM (Fig. 3D and E),

158

suggesting that there is no direct correlation between mitochondrial fragmentation and

159

alpha‐synuclein seeding propensity. BAPTA‐AM has been reported to inhibit proteases (Da

160

Cruz et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2001; Ray et al, 2002), which is mediated via the blocking of

161

intracellular calcium transients required to regulate protease activity (Demartino et al, 1982;

162

Mellgren, 1987). This could demonstrate a more enduring effect of BAPTA‐AM and thus led

163

us to investigate the effect of mitochondrial proteostasis on alpha‐synuclein seeding.

164
165

Mitochondria present a very unique compartment for the folding of proteins, because the vast

166

majority of proteins are imported as linear polypeptides that are folded once inside.

167

Moreover, reactive oxygen species constantly arise due to oxidative phosphorylation which

168

occurs at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus, it is not surprising that mitochondria are

169

well equipped with chaperones and also proteases to control mitochondrial protein

homeostasis (Quirós et al, 2015). Intriguingly, mitochondrial proteases have recently been

171

found to regulate the dissolution of cytosolic protein aggregates after heat shock (Ruan et al,

172

2017) indicating that they are not only responsible for the maintenance of intra‐mitochondrial

173

proteins as previously assumed. We thus aimed to test if inhibition of mitochondrial proteases

174

could influence alpha‐synuclein seeding using the PFF assay as a model system. To test the

175

role of the Lon‐protease, a protease residing in the mitochondrial matrix, cells were treated

176

with the Lon‐inhibitor CDDO‐Me (Gibellini et al, 2015). To investigate the role of high

177

temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2/Omi), a protease residing in the mitochondrial

178

intermembrane space (IMS), cells were treated with the inhibitor UCF‐101 (Cilenti et al, 2003).

179
180

Both mitochondrial protease inhibitors significantly increased PFF‐induced alpha‐synuclein

181

seeding (Fig. 4A). The effect upon inhibition of the Lon protease was lower than seen upon

182

inhibition of HtrA2, although the Lon protease had previously been found to have the highest

183

impact on the dissolution of aggregates after heat shock (Ruan et al, 2017). Interestingly,

184

HtrA2 had previously been linked to PD (Strauss et al, 2005; Bogaerts et al, 2008; Unal

185

Gulsuner et al, 2014), however genetic studies were not fully conclusive since pathological

186

mutations of HtrA2 had also been reported in control subjects. Though, HtrA2 was

187

encountered to be a constituent of protein aggregates in human alpha‐synucleinopathies

188

(Kawamoto et al, 2008; Strauss et al, 2005).

Inhibition of mitochondrial protein import enhances alpha‐synuclein seeding

positive for alpha‐synuclein, and that proteinase K digestion was not able to degrade all alpha‐

194

synuclein, indicating that some of the protein also resided within the organelle. If, however,

195

0.1% Triton X‐100 was added during the proteinase K digestion, alpha‐synuclein was fully

196

degraded as the detergent fully solubilizes mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 4B and C). This

197

result could be further supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of YFP alpha‐

198

synuclein SH‐SY5Y cells, displaying alpha‐synuclein staining inside mitochondria (Fig. 4D and

199

Supplementary Fig. 2). Mitochondrial import of alpha‐synuclein had been reported previously,

200

but had been critically debated (Devi et al, 2008). However, several recent studies

201

demonstrate that alpha‐synuclein interacts with the mitochondria import receptor Tom20 (Di

202

Maio et al, 2016; Ryan et al, 2018; Martínez et al, 2018). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition

203

of mitochondrial protein import might have a similar effect on alpha‐synuclein seeding as the

204

inhibition of proteases. Using Mitoblock‐6, a small molecule inhibitor of protein translocation

205

into mitochondria (Dabir et al, 2013), we observed increased alpha‐synuclein seeding using

206

the PFF assay (Fig. 4E), thus arguing for a direct role of mitochondrial proteostasis on alpha‐

207

synuclein homeostasis.

208
209

Mitochondrial proteostasis regulates β‐amyloid 42 aggregation

210
211

The above discussed mechanisms of mitochondrial proteostasis could have wider

212

implications, and thus may not be unique to alpha‐synuclein as suggested previously (Ruan et

213

al, 2017). Therefore, we wanted to test if our findings on alpha‐synuclein aggregation would

214

be consistent within another aggregation model. To test this, we used a stable HEK cell line

215

overexpressing Aβ42‐mCherry via a tetracycline inducible expression system. After induction,

216

these cells were treated for 24 hours with the different mitochondrial inhibitors. We found

217

that both, FCCP and BAPTA‐AM, increased the aggregation of native β‐amyloid 42 (Aβ42), with

218

BAPTA‐AM again having a more pronounced effect (Fig. 5A). In addition, inhibition of either

219

HtrA2 with UCF‐101 or of mitochondrial protein import with mitobloCK‐6 significantly

220

increased Aβ42 aggregation similar to our observations using alpha‐synuclein (Fig. 5B and C).

221

In addition, we have overexpressed HtrA2 in HEK Aβ42‐mCherry cells and show that Aβ42

222

aggregation is 50 % decreased by 50 % compared to control conditions demonstrating that

223

HtrA2 plays a significant role in regulating the proteostasis of amyloidogenic proteins (Fig. 5D).

224
225
226

In‐vitro aggregation of β‐amyloid 42 is influenced by HtrA2

227
228

To investigate the direct effect of mitochondria on protein aggregation in an isolated system,

229

we analyzed Aβ42 protein in vitro aggregation via fluorescence lifetime of fluorescently

230

labelled protein (Chan et al, 2013; Kaminski Schierle et al, 2011). For this, Aβ42 containing 50

231

% HyliteTM Fluor 488 labelled Aβ42 was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, the

232

fluorescence lifetime of HyliteTM Fluor 488 dropped from 3380 +/‐ 93 ps to 3003 +/‐ 97 ps

233

(timepoint 0 compared to timepoint 2 hrs, p = 0.0025, df 25) which is directly correlated with

234

protein aggregation (Chen et al, 2017; Schierle et al, 2014). However, in the presence of

235

isolated rat brain mitochondria, almost no drop in the fluorescence lifetime occurred

236

(timepoint 0 = 3538+/‐ 15 ps compared to timepoint 2hrs = 3502 +/‐ 5 ps, ns, Fig. 6A). Note,

237

the lifetime is also higher at timepoint 0, which is due to the immediate aggregation of Aβ42

238

in the control group. If the mitochondria were pre‐incubated with UCF‐101 which is inhibiting

239

the HtrA2 protease, the fluorescence lifetime of HyliteTM Fluor 488 decreased over the 2 hour

240

time period (timepoint 0 = 3523 +/‐ 16 ps compared to 2hrs = 3429 +/‐ 20 ps, p = 0.0009, df

242

via proteolysis, however other proteases besides HtrA2 may also be involved.

243
244
245

Discussion

246
247

This study demonstrates that a decline in mitochondria fitness, whether by loss of

248

mitochondrial integrity or by inhibiting the intramitochondrial protein homeostasis increases

249

alpha‐synuclein seeding. This is in accordance with the finding that mutations in genes

250

encoding for PINK1 and parkin enhance alpha‐synuclein aggregation, since defects in

251

mitophagy equate to decreased mitochondrial fitness (Chung et al, 2016; Lu et al, 2009).

252

However, as we have not found a direct contribution of downstream effects of mitochondrial

253

dysfunction, we propose a direct link between mitochondrial protein uptake and degradation

254

and alpha‐synuclein seeding.

255
256

So far the effect of amyloidogenic proteins on mitochondria has been interpreted as a

257

secondary pathological hallmark. It has been shown that alpha‐synuclein as well as Aβ

258

exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro as well as in vivo (Cha et al, 2012; Subramaniam

259

et al, 2014; Rui & Zheng, 2016). Alpha‐synuclein and Aβ have been reported to inhibit the

260

uptake of mitochondrial proteins and Aβ has been also shown to inhibit preprotein maturation

261

(Di Maio et al, 2016; Cenini et al, 2016; Mossmann et al, 2014). We here pose the question of

262

whether the import of amyloidogenic proteins into mitochondria is a physiological

263

phenomenon or not. On one side, proteins might be imported into mitochondria since they

264

exert a specific function as recently discussed for alpha‐synuclein (Ludtmann et al, 2016). On

265

the other side, protein degradation via mitochondrial proteases within the organelle could

266

demonstrate a general mechanism connected to cellular stress, as discussed recently for

267

cytosolic protein dissolution after heat shock (Ruan et al, 2017). We have shown that alpha‐

268

synuclein is contained within mitochondria, the prerequisite for its degradation within the

269

organelle. This is in accordance with previous papers, which have shown the uptake and

270

preferential interaction of alpha‐synuclein with mitochondria in vitro (Devi et al, 2008; Reeve

271

et al, 2015; Robotta et al, 2014). Furthermore, alpha‐synuclein has recently been found to

272

interact with the mitochondrial import machinery, especially Tom20 as reported from three

273

independent groups (Di Maio et al, 2016; Ryan et al, 2018; Martínez et al, 2018).

274
275

Interestingly, in our study inhibition of HtrA2 had the most significant effect on alpha‐

276

synuclein seeding. From the literature, we would have expected the strongest effect to occur

277

via inhibition of the Lon protease, since it was found to have the most prominent contribution

278

to the degradation of heat shock induced protein aggregation and is commonly described as

279

the “master” protease (Ruan et al, 2017; Bezawork‐Geleta et al, 2015; Gur & Sauer, 2008).

280

Furthermore, the Lon protease resides in the matrix of mitochondria, while HtrA2 is confined

281

to the intermembrane space. However, HtrA2 has previously been genetically linked to

282

Parkinson’s disease (Strauss et al, 2005; Bogaerts et al, 2008; Westerlund et al, 2011; Unal

283

Gulsuner et al, 2014; Chao et al, 2015) and a neuroprotective role of the protein has been

284

suggested, since mice with mutant HtrA2 or HtrA2 knock out suffer from neurodegeneration

285

(Jones et al, 2003; Martins et al, 2004). However, this has been puzzling so far, since HtrA2

286

has been attributed a pro‐apoptotic function in somatic cells, and thus a neuroprotective

287

effect would have be expected upon knock out (Vaux & Silke, 2003). Thus, a direct role of

288

HtrA2 via its protease function is likely and is supported by the finding that HtrA2 interacts

289

with presenilin‐1 and Aβ (Gray et al, 2000; Gupta et al, 2004; Liu et al, 2005; Park et al, 2004).

290
291

While we have not found a direct link between alpha‐synuclein seeding and mitochondrial

292

downstream effectors, such as complex I inhibition, ROS and calcium increase, this does not

293

mean that they do not play an important role during the course of the disease. We strongly

294

support the notion that calcium plays a role in PD, possibly affecting mitochondrial fitness

295

when specific neuronal subtypes are subjected to increased calcium concentrations over long

296

time periods as recently shown (Chan et al, 2007). That there has not been a direct effect of

297

calcium on alpha‐synuclein seeding was initially puzzling, since we and others have shown that

298

calcium can accelerate alpha‐synuclein aggregation in vitro (Nath et al, 2011; Lautenschläger

299

et al, 2018). However, we have shown that calcium preferentially affected the lag time of

300

alpha‐synuclein aggregation kinetics, while the elongation was only slightly increased

301

(Lautenschläger et al, 2018). Thus, if calcium only has an effect on the nucleation kinetics of

302

alpha‐synuclein aggregation we would not necessarily expect to observe an effect on alpha‐

303

synuclein seeding in cells (Buell et al, 2014).

304
305

It has been reported lately that mitochondrial heat shock proteins and proteases are

306

upregulated in patients with AD, and also in patients with mild cognitive impairment

307

(Sorrentino et al, 2017), indicating that these pathways are induced early on in disease.

308

Furthermore, the translocase of the outer membrane 40 (Tom 40), the pore forming protein

309

of the mitochondrial protein import complex, has been genetically linked to Alzheimer’s and

310

Parkinson’s disease (Gottschalk et al, 2014). This demonstrates that mechanisms of

311

mitochondrial proteostasis are extremely interesting to understand in more detail in order to

312

develop new concepts for therapeutical approaches. Taken together, our study shows that

313

mitochondrial proteostasis is an important factor influencing the aggregation of alpha‐

314

synuclein and Aβ42, extending the concept of mitochondria as guardian in cytosol (MAGIC)

315

(Ruan et al, 2017) to the degradation of amyloidogenic proteins and drawing a new picture on

316

how mitochondria contribute to neurodegeneration.

Material and Methods

320

Human cell culture

321

Human neuroblastoma cells (SH‐SY5Y) were obtained from the European Collection of Cell

322

Cultures (ECACC, Sigma‐Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and grown in a 1:1 minimal essential medium

323

(MEM) (Sigma‐Aldrich) and nutrient mixture F‐12 Ham (Sigma‐Aldrich) supplemented with 15

324

% FBS, 1 % non‐essential amino‐acids, 2 mM GlutaMAX and 1 % antibiotic‐antimycotic (all

325

Thermo Fisher Scientific, Epsom, UK). SH‐SY5Y cells stably expressing YFP‐alpha‐synuclein

326

were obtained by lentiviral transfection using 3rd generation lentiviruses (Addgene constructs:

327

12251, 12253, 12259) (Dull et al, 1998). Human wildtype alpha‐synuclein was inserted into

328

EYFP plasmid (pEYFP‐N1) using a 5 amino acid linker (sequence: GCACCGGTCGCCACC)

329

between the C‐terminus of alpha‐synuclein and N‐terminal EYFP. Alpha‐synuclein‐EYFP was

330

then cloned into the pLJM1 backbone for lentiviral expression (Addgene: 19319) (Sancak et al,

331

2008). For the preformed fibril (PFF) assay 50,000 cells were plated in MatTek dishes (P35G‐

332

1.5‐14‐C, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, US). For analysis of mitochondrial fragmentation cells

333

were plated at 20,000 per well in NuncTM Lab‐TekTM II Chambered Coverglass (8 well,

334

155409, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

335

Flp‐InTM T‐RExTM 293 cell line (Invitrogen), a derivative of HEK293 cells containing a stably

336

integrated FRT site and a TetR repressor, were used to generate stable cell lines expressing

337

either mCherry or Aβ42‐mCherry (pcDNA3.3‐mCherry, pcDNA3.3‐Ab42‐mCherry) under the

338

Flp‐InTM expression vector as described previously (Wu et al, 2014; Lu et al, 2019). Cells were

339

maintained in DMEM high glucose media (Sigma‐Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

340

serum (FBS), 2 mM glutaMAX, and 1 % antibiotic‐antimycotic (all Thermo Fisher Scientific).

341

Cells were grown at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated at 35 000 cells per

342

well in NUNC 24 well plates, and construct expression was induced for 3 days using media

343

above with 1 µg/mL tetracycline (Sigma Aldrich) added. All cell lines were tested for

344

mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlertTM PLUS mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza,

345

Walkersville). For transient transfection of HtrA2 (Plun‐Favreau et al, 2007) electroporation

346

with the NEON transfection system was used (settings: 1050 V, 30 ms, 2 pulses; Thermo Fisher

347

Scientific). pcDNA3‐HtrA2‐FLAG was a gift from L. Miguel Martins (Addgene plasmid # 15938;

348

http://n2t.net/addgene:15938; RRID:Addgene_15938).

349

Cell were imaged on a widefield microscope with IX83 frame (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan),

350

HPLS343 plasma light source (Thorlabs, Newton, US), and Clara interline CCD camera (Andor,

351

Belfast, UK), controlled by Micromanager (Edelstein et al, 2014). Respective filter cubes for

352

YFP (excitation 500 nm, dichroic mirror 515 nm, emission 535 nm), RFP (excitation 560 nm,

353

dichroic mirror 585 nm, emission 630 nm) and DAPI (excitation 350 nm, dichroic mirror 400

354

nm, emission 460 nm) were used. Images for YFP‐alpha‐synuclein aggregation and DAPI were

355

taken with an Olympus Plan Apo U 60x/1.42 oil objective lens. Imaging was done randomly by

356

automated acquisition of a grid of 7x7 images per area. Aggregates were identified by their

357

fibrillar nature, cell nuclei were counted using FIJI (Schindelin et al, 2012). For Aβ42‐mCherry

358

aggregation images were taken with an Olympus LUCPlanFLN 20x/0.45 air objective lens.

Alpha‐synuclein fibrils

363

Human wild‐type (WT) alpha‐synuclein was expressed in Escherichia coli One Shot® BL21

364

STAR™ (DE3) (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) cells using plasmid pT7‐7 and purified using

365

ion exchange on a HiPrep Q FF 16/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,

366

Sweden) (Huang et al, 2005). Alpha‐synuclein was then further purified on a HiPrep Phenyl FF

367

16/10 (High Sub) hydrophobic interaction column (GE Healthcare) (Campioni et al, 2014).

368

Purification was performed on an ÄKTA Pure (GE Healthcare). Monomeric protein was

369

dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.2, lyophilized in a LyoQuest 85 freeze‐dryer

370

(Telstar, Spain), and stored at ‐80 °C.

371

Alpha‐synuclein fibrils were produced by diluting alpha‐synuclein monomer solution to a

372

concentration of 150 µM in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples were incubated at 37°C

373

for 5 days in 0.5 mL Protein Lobind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) under continuous

374

rotation at maximum speed (UVP HB‐1000 Hybridizer, Fisher Scientific). Fibrils were diluted

375

1:1 with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 to a final volume of 200 µL and sonicated (Digital

376

Sonifier® SLPe, model 4C15, Branson, Danbury, USA) with six 10 sec pulses at 70 % amplitude

377

and 10 sec pause after each sonication pulse. Sonicated fibrils were aliquoted, exposed to UV

378

light for 30 min and frozen immediately after at ‐80C.

379

Alpha‐synuclein fibrils were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (BioScope Catalyst

Preformed fibril (PFF) assay

390

For the induction of alpha‐synuclein seeding, YFP‐alpha‐synuclein overexpressing SH‐SY5Y

391

cells were incubated with sonicated preformed alpha‐synuclein fibrils as described by Luk et

392

al. (Luk et al, 2009). Briefly, cells plated in MatTek dishes were washed with Neurobasal

393

medium and subsequently changed to 500 µL Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 %

394

B27 and 0.5 mM GlutaMAX (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were preincubated for 1 hour,

395

either using 0.2 % DMSO for control or the respective treatment (see cell treatments below).

396

8 µL of PFFs were diluted with 32 µL HBSS (HBSS minus calcium and magnesium, no phenol

397

red, 14175‐053, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and mixed briefly 5 times. Fibrils were added to the

398

bottom of the BioPORTER tube (BioPORTER® Protein Delivery agent, BP502424, Gelantis, San

399

Diego, USA), mixed 5 times and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then vortexed for

400

5 sec at 600 rpm (StuartTM Scientific SA8 vortex mixer, Sigma‐Aldrich). 460 µL OptiMEM

401

medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the BioPORTER tube plus the respective

402

treatments and mixed 5 times. The PFF mixture was added dropwise to the cells, settled and

403

then incubated for 4 hours at 37°C and 5 % CO2. Final monomer equivalent concentration of

404

preformed fibrils was 600 nM.

Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)

439

Structured illumination images were collected on a custom built Structured Illumination

440

441

water immersion lens (UPLSAPO 60XW, Olympus) focused the structured illumination pattern

442

onto the sample. This lens also captured the samples’ fluorescence emission light before

488 nm (iBEAM‐SMART‐488, Toptica), 561 nm (OBIS 561, Coherent), and 640 nm (MLD 640,

445

Cobolt). Respective emission filters were BA 510‐550 (Olympus), BrightLine FF01‐600/37, and

446

BrightLine FF01‐676/29 (Semrock, New York, US). Imaging was done in fixed cells or live cells,

447

as indicated. Images were acquired using custom SIM software (HCImage, Mamamatsu

FLIM measurements of cytosolic calcium, H2O2, and ATP

452

Fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) was carried out on a custom‐built Time‐Correlated

453

Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system using a super‐continuum laser (SC450, Fianium) with

454

a pulse repetition rate of 40 MHz, a confocal scanning unit (FluoView 300, Olympus) coupled

455

with an inverted microscope frame (IX70, Olympus), and a time‐correlated single photon

456

counting system (Becker & Hickl GmbH) as described in detail before (Chen et al, 2015). The

457

excitation wavelength was selected by using an acousto‐optic tunable filter (AOTFnC‐400.650,

458

Quanta Tech) and respective excitation filters (to improve the wavelength selection), and

459

emission fluorescence was imaged through respective emission filters. The data acquisition

460

time was 200s for each FLIM image (10 cycles, 20s per cycle). The photon detection rate was

461

kept below 2% of the laser repetition rate in order to avoid photon pile‐up.

462

For cytosolic calcium measurements SH‐SY5Y cells were incubated with Oregon GreenTM 488

463

BAPTA‐1, AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at 1 µM concentration. Excitation was set

464

to 475 nm, excitation filter BrightLine FF01‐474/27 (Semrock), and emission filter BrightLine

465

FF01‐525/39 (Semrock) were used. For measurement of H2O2 and ATP SH‐SY5Y cells were

The aggregation of alpha‐synuclein in vitro was measured by Thioflavin T (ThT) assay. Briefly,

481

50 µL of 100 µM alpha‐synuclein with 10 µM fresh ThT added, was incubated for 7 days with

482

1% DMSO as a control, 10 µM FCCP, 10 µM BAPTA‐AM, or 10 µM BAPTA. Assays were

486

read every hour at 37 °C for 170 cycles. The readings of ThT fluorescence intensity were taken

487

using excitation at 440 nm and emission at 480 nm, collected from the bottom up with 20

sodium cacodylate buffer (Paraformaldehyd from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) pH 7.4 for 2h

524

at 4oC. Cells were scraped from 6 wells and centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 g. Cells were

525

washed 5 times in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer, 3 times in deionized water, and incubated

526

with 2 % uranyl acetate in 0.05 maleate buffer pH 5.2 (both BDH Chemicals Ltd., Dorset, UK)

527

overnight at 4oC. Cells were washed again and dehydrated at increasing ethanol

529

5 min in each, Sigma‐Aldrich). Cells were resuspended in LRW resin (LR White Resin, London

530

Resin (Hard), Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) mixed 50/50 with dry 100% EtOH and incubated

531

overnight at room temperature. The following day, cells were spun down, and resuspended

532

in pure LRW for 2 days, where LRW was exchanged twice. Cells were centrifuged at 13000 g

533

to form a firm pellet, which was transferred to size 2 gelatine embedding capsules (TAAB,

534

Aldermaston, UK) containing LRW resin. Gelatine capsules were covered with a glass coverslip

535

to exclude any air and the resin was cured at 60oC for 2 days. Gelatine capsule were removed

536

and ultrathin sections were cut using a Leica Ultracut E Ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar,

537

Germany) and placed on 400 mesh nickel/formvar film grids (EM Resolutions). Sections were

538

stained with Anti‐GFP antibody (ab6556, Abcam) in blocking solution (2 % BSA (BBITM

539

540

X100 (Calbiochem, San Diego, US) and 0.001% Tween20 (Sigma‐Aldrich) at 1:100 overnight.

541

After washing, sections were incubated with goat anti rabbit 10 nm gold secondary antibody

542

(BBITM solutions) in blocking solution at 1:200 for 1 hour. Sections were washed with washing

In‐vitro measurements of Aβ42 aggregation

552

Synthetic Aβ42 and Aβ42 Hilyte™ Fluor 488 (both from Anaspec, Seraing, Belgium) were

553

prepared as previously described (Sum et al, 2016). Briefly, lyophilized Aβ42 (1 mg) was

554

dissolved in ice cold trifluroacetic acid (200 mL), sonicated at 0 °C for 60 s and then lyophilized

555

overnight. Ice cold 1,1,1,3,3,3‐hexafluro‐2‐propanol (1 mL) was added, sonicated at 0 °C for

556

60 s and aliquoted as 20 μL units. The samples were lyophilized overnight and were stored at

557

‐80 °C until use. Lyophilized Aβ42 Hilyte™ Fluor 488 peptide (0.1 mg) was dissolved in 1%

558

NH4OH (200 μL) and sonicated for 60 s at 0 °C. The sample was aliquoted into 5 μL units, snap

559

frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‐80 °C. Immediately before the experiment unlabeled

560

Aβ42 was prepared by adding first dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (5% of total solvent volume),

561

then sodium phosphate buffer (NaP buffer 50mM, pH 7.4) to reach a concentration of 20 µM.

562

The solution was sonicated at 0 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 13,400 rpm at 0 °C for 30 min.

563

Then the sample was further diluted to 5 µM concentration with NaP buffer. Also the labelled

564

Aβ42 Hilyte™ Fluor 488 was brought to 5 µM concentration in NaP buffer and both were mixed

565

in 1:1 ratio. Samples were prepared on ice adding Aβ42, 1 mg/mL of purified mitochondria

566

(preparation see above) and 20 µM UCF‐101. Mitochondria isolation buffer and DMSO were

567

added in control samples. 12 µL volume were pipetted in silicon gaskets (Thermo Fisher

The Paper Explained

615

PROBLEM: Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease put a high

616

social and economic burden on modern societies. Since the early 1990s, protein aggregation

617

is found as an overarching phenomenon of these diseases, however, we still do not

618

understand why proteins start to undergo aggregation, particularly in sporadic cases of

619

disease, which represent the majority.

620

RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the aggregation of proteins relevant to

621

neurodegenerative diseases, like alpha‐synuclein in Parkinson’s disease and Amyloid‐beta 42

622

in Alzheimer’s disease, is alleviated by mitochondrial degradation of these proteins. We show

623

that alpha‐synuclein is contained within mitochondria and that the inhibition of mitochondrial

624

uptake of proteins, as well as inhibition of protein degrading enzymes within the

625

mitochondria, aggravate the seeding of alpha‐synuclein aggregation. This implies that this

626

mechanism is relevant to late disease stages, when alpha‐synuclein aggregation is already

627

initiated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aggregation of Abeta 42 is increased upon

628

inhibition of these mechanisms and that aggregation can be decreased by overexpression of

629

a mitochondrial protease. Taken together, this shows that mitochondrial protein degradation

630

demonstrates a general mechanism influencing the homeostasis of aggregation prone

631

proteins.

632

IMPACT: It was highlighted recently that mitochondria are able to degrade cytosolic proteins,

633

however thus far it has only been speculated that this is the case for proteins relevant to

634

neurodegeneration. Our results directly link mitochondrial dysfunction to protein

635

aggregation, which could have major implication to explain the sporadic occurrence of

636

neurodegenerative diseases upon a decline in mitochondrial fitness after chronic exposure to

637

environmental toxins or aging per se.
