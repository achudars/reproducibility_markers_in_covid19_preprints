Abstract
Alternative Splicing produces multiple mRNA isoforms of genes which have important diverse
roles such as regulation of gene expression, human heritable diseases, and response to
environmental stresses. However, little has been done to assign functions at the mRNA isoform
level. Functional networks, where the interactions are quantified by their probability of being
involved in the same biological process are typically generated at the gene level. We use a diverse
array of tissue-specific RNA-seq datasets and sequence information to train random forest models
that predict the functional networks. Since there is no mRNA isoform-level gold standard, we use
single isoform genes co-annotated to Gene Ontology biological process annotations, Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, BioCyc pathways and protein-protein interactions
as functionally related (positive pair). To generate the non-functional pairs (negative pair), we use
the Gene Ontology annotations tagged with “NOT” qualifier. We describe 17 Tissue-spEcific
mrNa iSoform functIOnal Networks (TENSION) following a leave-one-tissue-out strategy in
addition to an organism level reference functional network for mouse. We validate our predictions
by comparing its performance with previous methods, randomized positive and negative class
labels, updated Gene Ontology annotations, and by literature evidence. We demonstrate the ability
of our networks to reveal tissue-specific functional differences of the isoforms of the same genes.

Introduction
Recent studies illustrate that genes can have distinct functions with different mRNA isoforms,
highlighting the importance of studying mRNA isoforms of a gene [1,2]. This diversity in mRNA
isoforms is a result of Alternative Splicing (AS). Many alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms are
variably expressed across cell and tissue types [3–10]. AS affects regulation of gene expression,
development, human heritable diseases, and response to environmental stresses. This article builds
mouse tissue-specific functional networks by integrating heterogeneous expression and sequence
datasets at the mRNA isoform level.
In higher organisms such as mouse and human, AS plays a significant role in expanding the variety
of protein species [11–14]. As an effect, a gene may produce multiple mRNA isoforms whose
protein translations differ in expression, interaction and function [1,5,14,15]. For example, there
are more than 75,000 mRNA isoforms encoded by over 20,000 genes in the Mouse genome
annotation (GRCm38.p4). The fact that a gene is a mixture of mRNA isoforms makes referencing
a gene as being “upregulated” or “downregulated”, uninformative.
Massively parallel sequencing of mRNA isoforms has led to a rapid accumulation of expression
and sequence data at the mRNA isoform level. RNA-Seq has provided evidence confirming the
production and expression of distinct mRNA isoforms under different conditions [9,16,17]. This
has led to the improvement and refinement of genome annotations. Functional networks, at the
mRNA isoform level are important for understanding gene function but are largely uninvestigated
[18,19].

Traditionally, functional experiments are performed at the gene level. Therefore, there are very
few (few hundreds) functional annotations for alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. The
functional data recorded in databases such as Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG), and UniProt Gene Ontology Annotations (UniProt-GOA) are focused on
the canonical mRNA isoform and contain only few hundred annotations describing the functions
of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. These databases do not store tissue specific information
either.
The task of mRNA isoform function prediction is a challenging problem. Some mRNA isoforms
are non-functional and introduce noise in the data. Many mRNA isoforms are tissue and condition
specific. Since a gene can produce multiple mRNA isoforms [20], the direct transfer of function
from the gene to its mRNA isoforms doesn’t work. Gene function prediction methods consider a
gene as a single entity. Therefore, these cannot be directly applied to mRNA isoform function
prediction because they ignore the distinct functions of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms.
However, important advancements have been made by recent studies towards mRNA isoform level
understanding of gene functions [18,19,21–25] such as the prediction of more immune related gene
ontology terms for the mRNA isoform ADAM15B than isoform ADAM15A of ADAM15 gene,
which is involved in B-cell-mediated immune mechanisms.
One such study developed the human isoform-isoform interactions database (IIIDB) using RNASeq datasets, domain-domain interactions and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) [19]. A logistic
regression model was built using physical interaction data from the IntAct database [26]. The
predicted human isoform-isoform physical interaction network was restricted to the gene pairs
already present in IntAct. The problem of mRNA isoform functional network prediction is
formulated as a complex multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in [18]. In MIL, a gene is
treated as a “bag” of mRNA isoforms (“instances”). A gene pair is formulated as a bag of multiple
instance pairs, each of which has different probabilities to be functionally related. The goal of MIL
is to identify the specific instance pairs which are functional and maximize the difference between
them and the instance pairs of non-functionally related bags. A Bayesian network based MIL
algorithm was developed by [18] to predict a mouse mRNA isoform level functional network using
RNA-Seq datasets, exon array, pseudo-amino acid composition and isoform-docking data.
The studies [18,19] above introduce bias in the training and testing dataset by using random mRNA
isoform pairs as non-functional pairs (negative pairs) and do not consider the tissue-specific
mRNA isoform functions. Our work is fundamentally different and improves upon the studies
[18,19] above both in terms of research content and computational approaches. First, we formulate
the problem of mRNA isoform functional network prediction as a simple supervised learning task.
Second, our goal is to develop tissue-specific functional networks for mouse. Lastly, like previous
methods, we do not introduce bias by assuming that functionally unrelated (negative pair) mRNA

isoform pairs can be selected based on the cellular localization [19] or at random [18], which is
crucial to the selection of training data in a machine learning system.
We have developed 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform level functional networks in addition to an
organism level reference functional network for mouse. Using the leave-one-tissue-out strategy
with a diverse array of tissue-specific RNA-Seq datasets and sequence information, we trained a
random forest model to predict the functional networks. Because there is no mRNA isoform-level
gold standard for testing, we have used the single mRNA isoform genes co-annotated to GO
biological process, KEGG pathways, BioCyc pathways and PPIs as functionally related (positive
pair). The non-functional pairs (negative pairs) were generated by using the GO annotations tagged
with “NOT” qualifier. We have validated our predictions by comparing its performance with
previous methods, datasets with randomized positive and negative class labels, updated GO
annotations and literature evidence.

Methods
mRNA isoform level data processing
This study considers mRNA isoforms annotated in the NCBI Mus musculus genome assembly
(GRCm38.p4) for which both mRNA and protein sequences are available. All protein (and
corresponding mRNA) sequences smaller than 30 amino acids and those containing non-standard
characters are not considered. This resulted in a filtered set of 75,826 mRNA isoforms from 21,813
genes.
To comprehensively characterize mRNA isoform pairs, we have processed 359 RNA-Seq samples
from 17 tissues and calculated protein and mRNA sequence properties as described below. Such
heterogeneous features have been shown to be useful for predicting several biological properties
[18,27,28]. All calculations and analyses were performed on the Extreme Science and Engineering
Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Comet cluster [29].
The mRNA and protein level features are summarized in Table 1 and an overview of the workflow
is presented in Fig 1.

the process of generating the mRNA isoform level labels using two dummy gene ontology
biological process terms, T1 and T2. Functional mRNA isoform pairs (positive pairs) are shown in
green and non-functional pairs (negative pairs) are shown in red.
Preprocessing of RNA-seq datasets. To capture tissue specific functions, RNA-Seq datasets from
multiple tissues are processed to extract the expression values. Starting with the ENCODE mouse
RNA-Seq datasets, the following filtering criteria are used to select the datasets: 1) Read length ≥
50; 2) Mapping percent ≥ 70%; and 3) No error or audit warning flags were generated. For the
tissue specific networks, only those tissues with at least 10 samples were used. Based on these
filters we retained 359 RNA-Seq samples from around 20 tissues, 17 of which have at least 10
samples (Table S1).
The mouse genome build GRCm38.p4 from NCBI was used to align the RNA-Seq datasets using
STAR (version 2.5.3a) [30]. Then, the relative abundance of the mRNA isoforms as fragments per
kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) is calculated using StringTie (version

during the alignment and quantification.
mRNA sequence composition. mRNA sequences can be represented as the frequencies of k
neighboring nucleic acids, jointly referred to as k-mers. For an mRNA sequence there are 𝟒𝒌
possible k-mers in a k-mer group, while there are 𝟐𝟎𝒌 possible k-mers for protein sequences. For
a sequence of length l,

where, 𝑓(𝑘𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑖) is the frequency of the ith k-mer and 𝑁𝑖 is the count of the ith k-mer. We compute
the k-mer composition for k = 3 to 6 for all mRNA isoform sequences using the rDNAse library
in R [32,33].
Protein Sequence Properties. Each protein sequence can be characterized in multiple ways by
exploiting its sequence and order composition. Like the mRNA sequence k-mer composition
described above, we compute the k-mer compositions for k = 1 and 2 for all protein sequences.
We also compute the conjoint triad descriptors [34] for all protein sequences. For this, the standard
20 amino acids are grouped into 7 classes according to the volume of the side chains and their
dipoles. Then, the k-mer composition is calculated at k = 3 for this newly represented protein
sequence. To take the sequential information of the amino acids in a protein sequence into account,
we also compute the pseudo-amino acid composition [35] and Moran autocorrelation [36] for all
protein sequences. All protein sequence properties were computed using the protr library in R
[32,37].

mRNA isoform level feature calculation
The goal is to accurately predict a functional network which represents the probability of two
mRNA isoforms belonging to the same GO biological process or pathway. Lower edge weights
correlate with mRNA isoform pairs’ involvement in the same GO biological process or pathway.
The weighted functional network is modeled as a graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸), where the set 𝑉 represents the
mRNA isoforms (nodes) and the set 𝐸 represents the mRNA isoform pairs (edges). For an mRNA
isoform pair (𝐸𝑖𝑗) in the functional network, the class label (𝐿𝑖𝑗) is assigned as following:
𝐿𝑖𝑗

{

1 𝑖𝑓 𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 𝑚𝑅𝑁𝐴 𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑗 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡, 𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑐𝑜 ‒ 𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑜 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝐺𝑂 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑟 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑤𝑎𝑦
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒

Many mRNA isoforms have zero FPKM values. The FPKM values were corrected by performing
log-transformation, i.e. log2 (𝐹𝑃𝐾𝑀 + 1). This alleviates the problem where the log of zero
FPKM value is not defined, which is not an acceptable input for machine learning methods.
For all mRNA isoform pairs, Fisher’s z-transformed Pearson correlation scores are calculated and
used as input features for machine learning.

1‒𝜌
𝑧 = log2
2
1+𝜌
Pearson correlation coefficient of 1 and -1 leads to z-score of -∞ and ∞ respectively, so these zscores are replaced with an extreme value of -100 and 100 respectively. In cases where the Pearson
correlation coefficient is not defined, we set the z-score to 0.
For every mRNA isoform pair, we calculate one z-score using the samples from one tissue and use
this as one feature. For instance, one z-score for heart, one z-score for liver, one z-score for lungs
and so on for all 17 tissues. Additionally, one z-score is also calculated using all 359 RNA-Seq
samples. This resulted in 18 features, one for each of the 17 tissues and one using all RNA-Seq
samples. Similarly, for every mRNA isoform pair, we calculate one z-score for each of
𝑘 = 3, 4, 5, and 6 for mRNA isoform sequences, 𝑘 = 1 and 2 for protein sequences, conjointtriad descriptors, pseudo-amino acid composition and Moran autocorrelation. This led to 9 further
features resulting in a total of 27 features.

mRNA isoform level functional labels
The mRNA isoform level functional labels are created by combining the information from GO
biological process annotations (downloaded on 23 October 2017), KEGG pathways (downloaded
on 25 September 2017), BioCyc pathways (downloaded on 25 September 2017) and PPIs
(downloaded on 25 September 2017). We remove all GO biological process annotations with the
evidence codes: Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA), Non-traceable Author Statement
(NAS) and No biological Data available (ND). We utilize the GO hierarchy (gene ontology
downloaded on 25 October 2017) and propagate all annotations by following the “true path rule”,
which means that all genes/proteins annotated to a GO term T will also be annotated to all ancestor
terms of T.
The PPIs were integrated from IntAct [26], Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets
(BioGRID) [38], Agile Protein Interactomes DataServer (APID) [39], Integrated Interactions
Database (IID) [40] and Mentha [41]. For APID [39], we include interactions with at least 2
experimental evidences (level 2 dataset). For IID [40], we remove all interactions for which there
is only orthologous evidence. For Mentha [41], we remove interactions with a score less than 0.2.
Finally, we consider PPIs only if both interactors are from mouse.
After propagation, we remove the GO biological process terms which are too broad (more than
1000 genes annotated) or too specific (less than 10 genes annotated). A gene is assumed to be
functional if it is annotated to a GO biological process or a pathway. Two genes are assumed to be
functionally related if both are co-annotated to the same GO biological process or pathway. The
information in GO, KEGG, BioCyc and PPI databases usually focus on the canonical form of a
gene/protein and doesn’t distinguish between the mRNA isoforms resulting from AS. So, we
construct mRNA isoform level functional labels by utilizing the information from single mRNA
producing genes and gene annotations tagged with a “NOT” qualifier. A summary of the mRNA
isoform level functional label generation is illustrated in Fig 1.
In our functional networks, if a gene 𝐺1 produces only a single mRNA 𝑀1, then 𝑀1 is assumed to
perform the functions of 𝐺1and is considered functional. Similarly, if two genes 𝐺1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐺2, both
of which produce single mRNAs, 𝑀1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑀2 respectively, are co-annotated to the same GO
biological process or pathway, the pair (edge) 𝑀1 ‒ 𝑀2 is assumed to be functionally related
(positive pair). Additionally, if 𝐺1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐺2 are involved in a PPI, the pair (edge) 𝑀1 ‒ 𝑀2 is also
assumed to be functionally related (positive pair).
We utilize a more robust way of defining functionally unrelated (negative pair) mRNA isoform
pairs by using the GO biological process annotations tagged with “NOT” qualifier. A gene/protein
tagged with “NOT” qualifier means that it is not involved in the respective GO biological process
and hence can be considered non-functional (negative) for this GO biological process. All such

annotations are propagated by the inverse of “true path rule”, which means that if a gene/protein
is explicitly ‘NOT’ annotated to a GO term T, it will also be ‘NOT’ annotated to all the children
of T. Consider a GO biological process term 𝑇1 annotated with genes 𝐺1, 𝐺2,𝐺3 and 𝐺4 which
produce mRNA isoforms 𝑀1,𝑀2, 𝑀31, 𝑀32, 𝑀41, 𝑀42, and 𝑀43. Of these genes, if 𝐺3 is tagged
with a ‘NOT’ qualifier (Fig 1), all pairs of 𝑀31and 𝑀32 with 𝑀1, 𝑀2, 𝑀41, 𝑀42, and 𝑀43 are
assumed to be functionally unrelated (negative pair). It should be noted that currently there are
only few hundred such annotations.
Genes can be annotated to multiple GO biological process terms. In Fig 1, single mRNA isoform
producing genes 𝐺1𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐺2 are annotated to GO biological process terms 𝑇1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑇2. However, the
gene 𝐺2 is tagged with a “NOT” qualifier for term 𝑇2. Consequently, the mRNA isoform pair 𝑀1 ‒
𝑀2 is functionally related for term 𝑇1but functionally unrelated for term 𝑇2. In cases where an
mRNA isoform pair (𝑀1 ‒ 𝑀2) is found to be both functionally related (positive pair) for one term
(𝑇1) but functionally unrelated (negative pair) for another term (𝑇2), we consider the mRNA
isoform pair (𝑀1 ‒ 𝑀2) as functionally related (positive pair) because 𝑀1(𝐺1) and 𝑀2(𝐺2) are
involved in at least one common GO biological process.
Predicting functional networks
Generating training and testing datasets. There are approximately 2.9 billion possible mRNA
isoform pairs resulting from the 75,826 annotated mRNA isoforms. Using the method described
above (see methods section ‘mRNA isoform level functional labels’), we labelled 2,083,679
mRNA isoform pairs as functional pairs (positive) and 818,071 mRNA isoform pairs as nonfunctional pairs (negative). All the remaining mRNA isoform pairs are considered to be
‘unknown’, i.e. neither functional nor non-functional pairs. The mRNA isoform pairs in the
functional and non-functional groups are mutually exclusive, i.e. an mRNA isoform pair can be
either functional or non-functional, but not both.
We generate two types of datasets: training and testing. The training and testing datasets are
mutually exclusive, i.e. an mRNA isoform pair can be either in a training or testing dataset, but
not both. The training dataset contains randomly selected 640,000 functional and 640,000 nonfunctional mRNA isoform pairs. The testing dataset contains randomly selected 160,000 functional
and 160,000 non-functional mRNA isoform pairs not included in the training dataset. The
functional pairs in the original testing dataset are made up of only single mRNA isoform genes.
The non-functional pairs are however not restricted to single mRNA isoform genes. All datasets
are balanced.
Random forest model for the functional networks. We formulate the task of mRNA isoform
functional network prediction as a simple supervised learning problem. In supervised learning, a
model capable of distinguishing a pre-defined set of ‘positives’ (functional mRNA isoform pairs
in our case) from a set of ‘negatives’ (non-functional mRNA isoform pairs in our case) is built

using a set of features derived from potential predictors of the property under consideration
(mRNA isoform pair function in our case).
Using all 27 features for our training dataset, we train a Scikit-learn [42] Random Forest [43]
model to predict the mRNA isoform functional network. Then we evaluate the performance of the
random forest model by making predictions on the testing dataset. Commonly used performance
evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve
(AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are calculated using the predictions for testing dataset
to assess the performance of the random forest model. The predictions are only evaluated when all
27 features are used for predictions. Finally, we use the random forest models to make predictions
on all 2.9 billion possible mRNA isoform pairs.
Building tissue-specific mRNA isoform networks. To build the tissue-specific mRNA isoform
networks, we utilize the leave-one-tissue-out strategy. First, using all 27 features, we train an
organism-level mRNA isoform functional network prediction random forest model. Then, we
generate 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform functional network prediction random forest models
by removing the tissue specific RNA-Seq features, one tissue at a time. The mRNA isoform pairs
for which the prediction is unaffected after leave-one-tissue-out are referred to as “reference pairs”.
The two tissue-specific cases are: 1) mRNA isoform pairs which are predicted to be functional in
only one tissue (tissue specific functional mRNA isoform pairs), and 2) mRNA isoform pairs
which are predicted to be non-functional in only one tissue (tissue specific non-functional mRNA
isoform pairs). These are also summarized in Fig 2.
Fig 2. Defining tissue specific functional and non-functional mRNA isoform pairs. Here we
illustrate the process of classifying the mRNA isoforms as tissue specific functional, tissue specific
non-functional or organism wide reference pairs. If the prediction is functional (positive) when
using all 27 features but changes to non-functional (negative) after removing the tissue derived
RNA-Seq feature, we assume such mRNA isoform pairs as tissue-specific functional pairs.
Contrary to tissue-specific functional pairs, if the prediction changes from non-functional
(negative) to functional (positive) after removing the tissue derived RNA-Seq feature, we assume
such pairs as tissue-specific non-functional pairs. For the reference pairs, the prediction is constant
after removing any tissue derived RNA-Seq feature.
If the prediction for an mRNA isoform pair changes from functional (positive) to non-functional
(negative) after removing a tissue derived RNA-Seq feature, we consider such mRNA isoform
pairs as tissue specific functional pairs. Similarly, if the prediction for an mRNA isoform pair
changes from non-functional (negative) to functional (positive) after removing a tissue derived
RNA-Seq feature, we consider such mRNA isoform pairs as tissue specific non-functional pairs.
For instance, consider the case of heart specific mRNA isoform functional network prediction. We

train two random forest models, 1) using all 27 features and, 2) after removing the heart derived
RNA-Seq feature. Then, the heart specific functional mRNA isoform pairs are those which are
predicted as functional by the first model but non-functional by the second model and vice-versa
for the non-functional mRNA isoform pairs.
From mRNA isoform networks to gene networks. We collapse the tissue-specific mRNA
isoform networks to gene networks as illustrated in Fig 3. All mRNA isoform nodes of the same
gene are merged into a single gene node. All direct edges from the mRNA isoforms of the same
gene are transferred to the single gene node. This resulted in 17 gene level tissues networks in
addition to the 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform networks.
Fig 3. Constructing gene level networks from mRNA isoform networks. Shown here is the
process by which we construct gene level networks using the tissue-specific functional mRNA
isoform pair networks. All edges from the mRNA isoforms of the same gene in the mRNA isoform
network are transferred to the single gene node in the gene level network. The gene and its mRNA
isoforms have the same color.
Tissue-specific network analysis
We use igraph [44] in R [32] for analyzing the graph properties of tissue-specific networks. We
calculate basic statistics like number of nodes, number of edges, density, number of components,
and size of the largest connected component for both mRNA isoform and gene level networks.
Using the largest connected component for every network, we find central nodes (top 10%) using
betweenness centrality and degree centrality. We also check the overlap between the central nodes
as found using both centrality measures. The overlapping central gene nodes are further subjected
to functional enrichment analysis.
In addition to calculating the global network properties, we also extract the mRNA isoforms, genes
and gene pairs that are specific to a tissue and those that are shared by multiple tissues.
Functional enrichment analysis. We use the tissue-specific list of overlapping central gene nodes
to perform functional enrichment analysis using the ReactomePA (version 1.26.0) and
clusterProfiler (version 3.10.0) packages in R [32,45,46]. Enrichment is performed for Reactome
pathways (version 66), KEGG pathways (release 88.2), GO biological process, GO molecular
function and GO cellular components (GO data with a time stamp from the source of 10 October
2018 used by tools). In reactome data model, the core unit is a reaction while KEGG provides
information about higher-level systemic functions of the cell and the organism. Due to the
differences in the underlying data model and how pathways are defined, we perform enrichment
analysis for both Reactome and KEGG pathways. We use a p-value cutoff of 0.05, false discovery
rate control using Benjamini-Hochberg [47] with a cutoff of 0.05, minimum term size of 10, and
maximum term size of 1000 for the enrichment analyses. We also remove redundant GO terms

with a semantic similarity greater than 0.7 using the “Wang” measure [48] and keep the terms with
most significant adjusted p-value. We further filter the GO terms to four levels [45,46] and plot
only the top 5 most significant terms for every tissue. Neural tube was removed from the functional
enrichment analysis because there was only 1 central gene.
Model evaluation
Randomization experiments. To test the effect of randomization during the generation of training
and testing datasets, we performed 1000 iterations of random training and testing dataset
generation. In each iteration, we shuffle the combined functional and non-functional pairs, select
640,000 functional pairs and non-functional pairs respectively for the training dataset, select
160,000 functional and non-functional pairs respectively for the testing dataset, train a random
forest model on the training dataset, use the trained model to make predictions on the testing
dataset, and compute performance metrics. These datasets are referred to as “randomized datasets”.
To examine whether the random forest model learns genomic and sequence features that are
predictive of functional mRNA isoform pairs, we perform a control experiment in which the
functional and non-functional class labels are randomly shuffled to destroy the feature-class
relationship in the original dataset. We perform 500 iterations of random training and testing
dataset generation in which the functional and non-functional mRNA isoform pair class labels are
shuffled. We train a random forest model on the class label shuffled training dataset, use the trained
model to make predictions on the class label shuffled testing dataset and compute performance
metrics. These datasets are referred to as the “class-label shuffled datasets”.
We also evaluate the impact of number of trees on the performance of the random forest model.
For this, we use the following number of trees: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000.
Again, we train one model with each of these number of trees using the training dataset and then
evaluate the performance using the predictions on the testing dataset.
Using stratified cross-validation. We evaluate the performance of TENSION using a Stratified
10-Fold cross-validator. In terms of bias and variance, stratification, a sampling technique without
replication and where class frequencies are preserved, is generally a better scheme as compared to
regular cross-validation [49]. We use the original training data to create the 10-fold splits using
StratifiedKFold function from Scikit-learn [42] which preserves the relative class frequency in
each training and held out test fold. We then evaluate the performance of each fold by computing
the AUROC and AUPRC using the predictions made on the held out test fold.
Validating predictions using new annotations. Because there is no gold standard dataset
available for mRNA isoform level functions, we validate our predictions using the latest
annotations from GO, KEGG pathways, BioCyc pathways, IntAct [26], BioGRID [38], APID [39],
IID [40] and Mentha [41]. The new annotations (downloaded on 5 June 2018) were also processed

as described in the “mRNA isoform level functional labels” section. Using our strategy to utilize
the single isoform gene annotations for creating functional pairs, we found 284,916 functional
pairs in the new annotations not present in our original functional pairs. Similarly, we found
112,827 non-functional pairs in the new annotations not present in our original non-functional
pairs. We refer this new set of functional and non-functional mRNA isoform pairs as the
“validation set”.
Validation of literature datasets. We also validate the predictions made by TENSION using two
datasets from the literature: 1) a list of 20 ubiquitously expressed genes [50] and, 2) a list of 5035
genes that are expressed higher (expression fold change greater than 4 relative to all other tissues)
in a specific tissue [51]. Only the tissues present in both TENSION and the transcriptomic
BodyMap of mouse are selected for validation. We merge the three brain regions used in
TENSION, forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain into a single brain entity for the analysis.
Additionally, we removed the transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse genes that were not included in
our initial 21,813 genes. This resulted in a final gene set of 1654 genes for the transcriptomic
BodyMap of mouse. It is important to note that the above gene lists are based solely on the gene
expression and do not necessarily translate to functionally enriched genes and as such we expect
to find interactions involving these genes in multiple tissues.
Comparison with existing methods. To demonstrate the utility of using a simple supervised
learning framework and improvements over previous methods for mRNA isoform functional
network prediction, we compare TENSION with the Bayesian network based multi-instance
learning model in [18]. We use our original training dataset with all 27 features to train the
Bayesian network classifier and TENSION and make predictions on our original testing dataset.
The output scores for mRNA isoform pairs in the original testing dataset from Bayesian network
classifier and TENSION were used to compare the performance of the methods. We evaluate the
performance of both the methods by computing the AUROC and AUPRC.

Results
A random forest model for functional network prediction
We use the mouse genome build GRCm38.p4 from NCBI in this study. After filtering the mRNA
isoforms containing non-standard characters, less than 30 amino acid protein products and those
missing either sequence or expression profile, we retained 2,874,753,225 mRNA isoform pairs.
We have calculated 27 heterogeneous genomic and sequence-based features for all the mRNA
isoform pairs (Table 1). Of these, we labelled 2,083,679 mRNA isoform pairs as functional pairs
(positive) using the single mRNA isoform genes (described in methods section). And 818,071
mRNA isoform pairs as non-functional pairs (negative) by using the “NOT” annotation tag in the
GO annotations (described in methods section). These functional and non-functional mRNA
isoform pairs are used to train and develop random forest models for predicting mouse mRNA

isoform level functional networks. The predictions made by random forest have an associated
probability score which measures the strength of mRNA isoform interactions.
Randomization experiments. Randomization experiments test the effect of selecting functional
and non-functional pairs when generating training and testing datasets. Fig 4 shows that there is
very little to no variance in the performance of randomized datasets. Therefore, we generate one
final training and testing dataset (“original datasets”) by randomly selecting functional and nonfunctional pairs and use it to generate the final functional network prediction models.
Fig 4. Performance evaluation on randomized datasets. A boxplot of various performance
evaluation metrics calculated using 1000 randomized datasets. The median value is shown for the
performance metrics. The width of the boxes along the x-axis represent the variability in the value
of the performance metric across 1000 randomized datasets. Higher metric value and smaller box
width is better. Abbreviations - AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve;
MCC: Matthews Correlation Coefficient
To help us identify if TENSION is actually learning from the data and not just making random
predictions, we estimate the performance of the random forest model on the class-label shuffled
datasets. The AUROC obtained on the class-label shuffled datasets is 0.5 (as compared with 0.947
on the original testing dataset) indicating that our functional network prediction model performs
significantly better than random predictions (Fig 5).
Fig 5. Performance evaluation on label shuffled datasets. A boxplot of performance evaluation
metrics calculated using 500 label shuffled datasets. The functional and non-functional labels for
mRNA isoform pairs are randomly shuffled while still maintaining the class distribution (equal
functional/non-functional pairs). The median value is shown for the performance metrics. The
width of the boxes along the x-axis represent the variability in the value of the performance metric
across 500 label shuffled datasets. Higher metric value and smaller box width is better. The
performance of a model which makes random guesses is about 0.5 (or 0 for MCC because it ranges
from -1 to 1). Abbreviations - AUROC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve;
MCC: Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
Performance evaluation. We evaluate the performance of TENSION when using all 27 features
from the predictions on the original testing dataset. We first evaluate the impact of number of trees
on the performance of random forest model. It can be seen in Fig S1 that there is very little
improvement in the performance of the model after 100 trees. To reduce computational complexity
without sacrificing the performance while making predictions for all 2.9 billion mRNA isoform
pairs, we use 100 trees in our final models. On the original testing dataset, we obtain a high
correlation as seen in Table 2 and Fig S2 suggesting a highly accurate model.

Evaluation by stratified cross-validation. In addition to evaluating the performance of our
random forest on a held-out test set, we also perform stratified 10-fold cross validation. The
AUROC and AUPRC curves for each fold are shown in Fig 6. We see that there is very little
variance in the results of each fold. The results are also very close to those obtained on the original
testing dataset (S2 Fig). The results of stratified cross-validation emphasize the robustness of
TENSION.

the performance is virtually identical for all folds suggesting the robustness of TENSION. A model
with area under the curve closer to 1 is better while a model with an area under the curve of 0.5 is
equivalent to making random guess. Abbreviations - AUC: Area Under the Curve.
Validating predictions using new annotations. After processing the new GO annotations,
pathway, and PPIs data, we learned a new set of 397,743 previously unknown mRNA isoform
pairs. Of these, we labelled 284,916 as functional and 112,827 as non-functional mRNA isoform
pairs. Using all 27 features, TENSION correctly classified 315,844 (out of 397,743) mRNA
isoforms pairs at an overall accuracy of 79.4%. The true positives, true negatives, false positives,
and false negatives collectively represented by a confusion matrix are presented in Table 3. Since
the distribution of functional and non-functional mRNA isoform pairs in the validation set is
imbalanced, we also access the performance of our classifier by computing the AUPRC and
AUROC. We observe an AUPRC of 0.926 and an AUROC of 0.855 (Fig 7). In addition to these
curves, we also calculate the Precision (0.885), Recall (0.819), F1 score (0.851) and MCC (0.524).
These are much higher than random predictions shown in Fig 5 suggesting that TENSION

Of these new mRNA isoform pairs, 8200 are predicted as tissue-specific functional mRNA isoform
pairs. However, the annotations in GO, KEGG, BioCyc, and PPI databases do not store tissue
information, so we cannot validate the tissue specificity of these predictions.
Comparison with existing methods. We compare the performance of TENSION when using all
27 features with that of the Bayesian network based MIL method [18]. The default parameters are
used for the Bayesian network-based MIL method. We use our original training dataset to train the
Bayesian network-based MIL method and TENSION and then make predictions on our original
testing dataset. We calculate the AUROC and AUPRC using these predictions for both models to
compare their performance. The functional mRNA isoform pairs are derived from single mRNA
producing genes co-annotated to GO biological process, pathways or PPIs whereas the nonfunctional mRNA isoform pairs are constructed by using the ‘NOT’ tagged GO biological process
annotations.
The Bayesian network based MIL method achieves an AUROC of 0.761 (Fig 8) which is higher
than the original AUROC value of 0.656 reported in the original study [18]. TENSION achieves
significantly higher AUROC of 0.947. Similarly, TENSION achieves significantly higher AUPRC
of 0.947 as compared to Bayesian network based MIL method’s AUPRC of 0.757 (Fig 8). The
significantly higher AUROC and AUPRC values of TENSION highlights the importance of using
a simple supervised learning framework and improvements over the more complex MIL-based
methods for mRNA isoform functional network prediction. It should be noted that the MIL-based

method was originally developed using different set of features, however, for the purpose of
comparison we have used the same training and testing datasets for both methods. The improved
performance of Bayesian network based MIL method on our dataset also highlights the
significance of mRNA isoform level functional label and feature generation in TENSION.

Tissue-specific networks
Tissue-specific functional mRNA isoform pair networks. As shown in Fig 2, to build the tissuespecific mRNA isoform level functional networks, we assume that, for a tissue 𝒊, if an mRNA
isoform pair is predicted to be functional (positive) using all 27 features, but the prediction after
removing the tissue 𝒊- specific feature is non-functional (negative), the mRNA isoform pair is only
functional under tissue 𝒊. The strength of mRNA isoform interactions is measured by the
probability score predicted by random forest. To remove noise, low confidence predictions and
organism-wide reference mRNA isoform pairs from tissue-specific functional networks, we only
consider the mRNA isoform pairs which have a random forest predicted probability score ≥ 𝟎.𝟔
when using all 27 features and a probability score ≤ 𝟎.𝟒 after removing the tissue derived RNASeq feature. For the tissue specific functional networks, a lower probability score corresponds to
higher strength of mRNA isoform pair to be involved in the same GO biological process or
pathway. A summary of all 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform functional networks as obtained after
applying the above filtering criteria is provided in Table 4.

The tissue-specific functional networks identify around 10.6 million tissue-specific functional
mRNA isoform pairs (0.37% of all possible mRNA isoform pairs). The density of tissue-specific
functional networks is in the order of 10 ‒ 2 ‒ 10 ‒ 5 and most networks are very sparse. The number
of tissue-specific functional mRNA isoform pairs vary greatly across the tissues, from few
thousands in limb and neural tube to few million in large intestine and ovary (Table 4). All these
mRNA isoform pairs are present in only one tissue. Table 4 shows the number of functional mRNA
isoform pairs identified as single tissue-specific in each of the 17 tissues.
All tissues have many connected components (Table 4). Limb, neural tube and kidney have less
than 50% mRNA isoform nodes in their largest connected component, whereas some others like
hindbrain, large intestine, ovary, and forebrain etc. have over 90%. These differences in the size
of networks, mRNA isoforms involved and the network structures highlight the differences in
tissue-level biological processes as evident by the differences in the enriched pathways and gene
ontology terms (discussed later).
To highlight the differences that arise when analyzing functional networks at the mRNA isoform
and gene level and because all functional enrichment tools are built for analyzing genes, we also
compress the mRNA isoform level networks to gene level networks. In the gene level networks,
all mRNA isoform nodes of the same gene are combined into a single gene node. Table 5 provides
a summary of the gene level networks for all 17 tissues. We identified around 7.79 million unique
gene pairs (3.27% of all possible gene pairs) using these tissue level gene functional networks. It
was recently observed in mouse and humans that testis and ovary express the highest number of
genes whereas brain and liver express the highest number of tissue enriched genes under normal
conditions [51,52]. This is also reflected in our gene level networks (Table 5) where ovary,
hindbrain and forebrain networks have the largest number of edges (gene pairs) and nodes (genes).
While the majority of gene pairs are present in only one tissue level gene functional networks (98%
of identified gene pairs; Table 5), a small fraction (2% of identified gene pairs; Table 5 and Fig 9)
is present in at least two tissue level gene functional networks. Although the gene pairs are shared
between tissues, the mRNA isoform pairs resulting from these gene pairs are specific to only one

Shared gene-pairs may indicate shared processes between tissues. The spleen and embryonic facial
prominence share the highest fraction of gene pairs (about 7.6% of gene pairs; Table 5) with other
tissues, while ovary shares the lowest fraction (3% of all ovary gene pairs; Table 5). The
composition of gene pairs shared between the tissue level functional networks is quite complex
and is shown in Fig 9. Upon further investigation, we find that the spleen network shares 4.8% of
its gene pairs with ovary network while ovary network shares only 0.1% of its gene pairs with the
spleen network. We also find that thymus shares about 3.7% of its gene pairs with ovary,
supporting the notion that thymus is necessary for normal ovarian development and function after
the neonatal period [53,54]. These findings further justify the importance of our networks in
characterizing tissue level processes.

gene pairs shared between two tissues. The numbers shown in the heatmap are not symmetric

by the total number of pairs in the tissue specified on row. For instance, spleen shares 4.8% of all
gene pairs present in the spleen network with ovary. Darker shades refer to higher fractions of
shared gene pairs. The numbers in the heatmap should be interpreted as reading a matrix rowwise.

Like the mRNA isoform networks, the gene-level neural tube network contains only 2.9% of genes
in its largest connected components (Tables 4 and 5). All other gene-level tissue networks have a
very high fraction of genes and gene pairs in the largest connected components (Table 5).
Central genes in tissue-specific functional networks have tissue related characteristics. The
central genes identified in our tissue-specific networks are enriched in tissue related GO terms and
pathways (Figs 10 and 11). The central genes in the heart specific gene network are significantly
enriched in transmembrane transporter activity, vitamin binding, complement and coagulation
cascades etc. (Figs 10 and 11). Supplementation of several vitamins such as Vitamin B6, Vitamin
D, Vitamin E, and folate etc. are linked to reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases [55–59]. The
serine proteinase cascades of the coagulation and the complement systems have been associated
with functions of the cardiovascular and immune systems [60].
Fig 10. Gene ontology functional enrichment. Since the functional annotations are at the gene
level, we use the central genes identified by both betweenness centrality (top 10%) and degree
centrality (top 10%) to perform gene ontology enrichment. Only the top 5 terms for every tissue
are shown here. The dot size represents the ratio of genes present in our central genes annotated to
a gene ontology term to genes present in our central network. The color signifies the value of

Several important renal processes such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway, cytokine signaling in
immune system, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and signaling by interleukins etc. are
enriched in the central genes of the kidney specific gene network (Figs 10 and 11). Defects in these
processes and pathways have been linked to several renal disorders and related co-morbidities [61–
64]. Genes in the kidney network are also enriched for interferon-gamma production and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Figs 10 and 11). In IBD, interferon-gamma negatively regulates
the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1) -mediated renal Ca2+ absorption contributing to IBD-associated
loss of bone mineral density and altered Ca2+ homeostasis [65].
The large intestine has specific and efficient carrier mediated transporter mechanisms for the
absorption of several water soluble vitamins (pantothenic acid, biotin, thiamin, riboflavin and
folate) [66]. These vitamins are essential for several biological processes and their enrichment in
large intestine specific gene network only seems natural (Figs 10 and 11). The brain-in-the-gut or
the enteric nervous system (ENS) is the largest component of the autonomous nervous system [67–
69]. The small intestine ENS is equipped to perform functions relating to inflammation, digestion,
secretion and motility among others [67–69]. The identification of several neuronal terms for
central genes in the small intestine network is in line with such literature findings (Figs 10 and 11)
[67–69].
Fertility and energy metabolism are reciprocally regulated and tightly linked in female animals
and this relation has been conserved throughout evolution [70–72]. Metabolic disorders such as
those of the liver can lead to changes in reproductive functions and vice-versa [70–72]. It was
recently proposed that in case of protein scarcity, the estrous cycle is blocked and the liver acts as
a critical mediator of reproductive and energetic functions [70–72]. The enrichment of several
reproduction and fertility related terms in our liver specific network also point towards such
observations (Figs 10 and 11).
We also find significantly enriched tissue related process terms for other tissues such as spleen,
ovary, adrenal glands and limb etc. (Figs 10 and 11). However, the tissue specific central genes do
not always lead to significantly enriched terms.
The identification of tissue related biological processes via the central genes highlights that
TENSION can correctly capture the tissue-specific functional mRNA isoform pairs produced by
genes involved in tissue related functions. We can identify the specific mRNA isoforms of these
genes by looking back at the mRNA isoform level tissue networks. Finding the specific mRNA
isoforms responsible for these processes should provide a significant clue towards understanding
of developmental and molecular processes of diseases and biological functions.

pair is predicted to be non-functional (negative) using all 27 features but the prediction after
removing the tissue 𝒊- specific feature changes to functional (positive), the mRNA isoform pair is
only non-functional under tissue 𝒊 (Fig 2). To remove noise and low confidence predictions in
tissue-specific non-functional mRNA isoform networks, we only consider the mRNA isoform
pairs which have a random forest predicted probability score of ≤ 𝟎.𝟒 when using all 27 features
and a probability score of ≥ 𝟎.𝟔 after removing the tissue derived RNA-Seq feature. Higher
probability score reflects stronger tissue-specific non-functional mRNA isoform pair. A summary
of all 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform level non-functional networks as obtained after applying
the above filtering criteria is provided in Tables 6.

Using these tissue-specific mRNA isoform level non-functional networks we identified around 3.5
million tissue-specific non-functional mRNA isoform pairs (0.12% of all possible mRNA isoform
pairs). The tissue-specific non-functional networks are also sparse with density in the order of
10 ‒ 3 ‒ 10 ‒ 5. The number of tissue-specific non-functional mRNA isoform pairs also vary greatly
across the tissues. For instance, forebrain has a very high number of 1.4 million (40% of all tissuespecific non-functional mRNA isoform pairs) non-functional mRNA isoform pairs. All these
mRNA isoform pairs are specifically non-functional in only one tissue.

Similar to the functional networks, we also compress the non-functional mRNA isoform networks
to gene level non-functional networks. In the gene level networks, all mRNA isoform nodes of the
same gene and their edges are combined into a single gene node. Many gene pair (but no mRNA
isoform pair) are present in at least two tissue level gene non-functional networks.

Different mRNA isoforms of the same gene are functional in different tissues and have
tissue preferred functional partners
The tissue level functional mRNA isoform networks along with the identification of gene pairs
that are shared across tissues provide us an opportunity to distinguish the tissue-specific functional
mRNA isoforms of a gene. We have identified around 164,000 functional gene pairs with different
mRNA isoform pairs that are shared by multiple tissues. This points to the tissue specific
expression and function of different mRNA isoforms of a gene.
The fraction of gene pairs shared between tissues is presented in Fig 9. We see that several pairs
of tissues such as limb and forebrain, heart and large intestine, midbrain and forebrain, thymus and
ovary, spleen and ovary etc. share a large number of gene pairs. This suggests that while these
gene pairs are functional in multiple tissues, the actual mRNA isoform pairs can differ and our

networks are capable of identifying such differential relationships between mRNA isoform pairs
of the same gene pair.
The gene pair Fundc2 (FUN14 domain containing 2) and Necab1 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium
binding protein 1) is present in both ovary and heart. The Fundc2 gene produces a single mRNA
isoform NM_026126.4 while Necab1 gene produces two mRNA isoforms, XM_006538234.1 and
NM_178617.4. The interaction between Fundc2 and Necab1 can be dissected into two interactions
corresponding to the two mRNA isoform pairs (Fig 12A). Among the two mRNA isoform pairs,
the pair involving XM_006538234.1 is heart specific functional mRNA isoform pair while the
other pair involving NM_178617.4 is functional in ovary. This reveals the tissue preferred
interaction partners of Fundc2 mRNA isoform NM_026126.4. Further investigation of all tissue
specific functional mRNA isoform pairs involving Necab1 mRNA isoform XM_006538234.1
revealed that most of its interactions are found in heart (366 out of 391). Similarly, most of the
interactions involving Necab1 mRNA isoform NM_178617.4 are found in ovary (836 out of 859).
This highlights the expression and functional preference of Necab1 mRNA isoforms.
Fig 12. mRNA isoforms of the same gene have different functional partners across tissues.
Few examples where the mRNA isoforms of the same gene have different functional/nonfunctional partners in specific tissues. The mRNA isoforms of the same gene are represented in
same shape. The node color, edge color and the edge label color are encoded based on the tissue
for part A and B. Functional pairs have green, while non-functional pairs have red node color, edge
color and edge label color in parts C and D. Lower edge weight reflects higher strength of
functional mRNA isoform pair. A. The mRNA isoform NM_026126.4 of gene Fundc2 forms a
functional pair with different mRNA isoforms of Necab1 gene in heart and ovary. B. The ovary
enriched mRNA isoform NM_001277944.1 of gene Apoc2 forms a functional pair with another
ovary enriched Nts mRNA isoform NM_024435.2 in ovary. Other Apoc2 mRNA isoform
NM_001309795.1 is preferred in forebrain. C. The Olfr1152 mRNA isoform NM_001011834.1
forms a functional pair with Agrp mRNA isoform NM_001271806.1 in hindbrain while the other
pair involving Agrp mRNA isoform NM_007427.3.1 is non-functional in hindbrain. D. The gene
pair Iqcf6 and Gstcd result in four mRNA isoform pairs of which one pair is functional and two
are non-functional in adrenal glands.
Another such gene pair involves two mRNA isoform producing genes, Apoc2 (apolipoprotein CII) and Nts (neurotensin). The gene pair involving Apoc2 and Nts is found in the networks of ovary
and forebrain and can be dissected into four interactions corresponding to the four mRNA isoform
pairs. Three of these mRNA isoform interactions are found to be tissue-specific functional mRNA
isoform pairs (Fig 12B). Interactions involving the Apoc2 mRNA isoform NM_001309795.1 are
preferred in forebrain (1310 out of 1903) and NM_001277944.1 are preferred in ovary (355 out of
586). The NM_024435.2 mRNA isoform of Nts is enriched in ovary (1314 out of 1358) and

interacts with the ovary enriched Apoc2 mRNA isoform NM_001277944.1 in ovary, suggesting a
tissue preferred interaction pattern.
TENSION is also able to distinguish the tissue-specificity of mRNA isoforms of a gene between
closely related tissues. For example, the gene Olfr994 (olfactory receptor 994) produces two
mRNA isoforms, XM_006499549.1 and NM_146433.1. The mRNA isoform NM_146433.1 is
preferred in hindbrain (223 out of 309 interactions) while XM_006499549.1 is preferred in
midbrain (57 out of 65 interactions). There are several cases in which the mRNA isoforms of the
same gene exhibit tissue preferred interactions. However, this is not true for all multi-isoform
genes. The mRNA isoforms of many multi-isoform genes are not involved in tissue preferred
interactions.
Some mRNA isoform pairs are functional while other mRNA isoform pairs of the same
gene pair are non-functional
We find about 660,000 instances where an mRNA isoform pair is functional while other mRNA
isoform pairs of the same gene pair are non-functional. Around 143,000 of such cases are within
the same tissue. For example, the mRNA isoforms of genes Agrp (agouti related neuropeptide)
and Olfr1152 (olfactory receptor 1152) result in two mRNA isoform pairs (Fig 12C). The pair
involving NM_001011834.1 (Olfr1152) and NM_001271806.1 (Agrp) is predicted to be
functional in hindbrain while the other pair involving Agrp mRNA isoform NM_007427.3.1 is
non-functional in hindbrain (Fig 12C). The NM_007427.3.1 mRNA isoform of Agrp is
functionally enriched in the forebrain but has most of its non-functional interactions in hindbrain
(362/447 functional interactions in forebrain vs 324/343 non-functional interactions in hindbrain),
but the opposite is true for the isoform NM_001271806.1. The NM_001271806.1 mRNA isoform
of Agrp contains an alternate 5’ exon, although both Agrp mRNA isoforms produce the same
protein.
Similarly, for the gene pair involving Iqcf6 (IQ motif containing F6) and Gstcd (glutathione Stransferase, C-terminal domain containing), only one mRNA isoform pair is functional in adrenal
glands while two other pairs are non-functional (Fig 12D). The remaining mRNA isoform pair
could be functional or non-functional in multiple tissues.
The remaining 520,000 instances are across tissues, i.e., one mRNA isoform pair is tissue-specific
functional in one tissue while other mRNA isoform pairs of the same gene pair are tissue-specific
non-functional in other tissue.
Validation of super-conserved and transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse tissue-specific genes
The first gene set contains 20 genes that are known to be widely expressed [50]. These genes have
tissue-specific functional interactions in most of our 17 tissue-specific networks validating their
ubiquitous expression and function (Fig. 13). The second gene set contains 1654 genes from the

transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse that have a very high expression in one tissue (relative to all
other tissues) and thus a higher propensity to have more tissue-specific functions. For every gene,
we compute the top 𝑛 = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 𝐴𝑙𝑙} tissues for its mRNA isoforms based on the number of
functional interactions in the tissue.
Fig 13. Validation of super-conserved genes. A heatmap showing the presence or absence of a
tissue-specific functional interaction for the 20 super-conserved genes. The genes are on the y-axis
and the tissues are on the x-axis. If a gene has a tissue-specific functional interaction, the
corresponding block is filled green, or orange otherwise. Abbreviations - AdGland: Adrenal
glands; EmbFacPro: Embryonic Facial Prominence; Lintestine: Large intestine; Ntube: Neural
tube; Sintestine: Small intestine.
We find that the top tissue (𝑛 = 1) among our tissue-specific networks and that in the
transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse matches for 503 genes (30%; Table 7). However, a gene can
be involved in multiple functions across multiple tissues due to different mRNA isoforms.
Therefore, when we consider the top 3 (52% match) or top 5 (68% match) tissues, we find a much
higher correlation with the transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse (Table 7). Overall, we find 1245
(75%) genes to have at least one tissue specific interaction in the same tissue as described in the
transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse.
It is interesting to note that if we consider the tissue-specificity of only the genes, ignoring the
tissue-specificity of different mRNA isoforms of the same gene, we find a weaker correlation with
the transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse (15% and 41% respectively for n = 1 and 3). Most studies
including the transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse focus only on the gene expression and function,
completely ignoring the effects of alternatively spliced mRNAs. Our study further illustrates the
importance of distinguishing the functions of different mRNA isoforms of the same gene.

Similar tissues have similar mRNA isoform expression profile
Tissues that are functionally and morphologically similar tend to have more consistent gene
expression profile than other tissues [51]. We also observe that similar tissues such as midbrain,
forebrain, hindbrain and neural tube have a very high Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ ≥ 0.97;
Fig 13) based on the median mRNA isoform expression profile. Likewise, adrenal gland is most
highly correlated with ovary (ρ = 0.87), large intestine with small intestine (ρ = 0.84) and thymus
with spleen (ρ = 0.88) among others, and are consistent with previous findings [51].

Green represents higher positive correlation between a pair of tissue while red reflects higher
negative correlation. Similar tissues can be seen being clustered together.

Discussions
We have developed tissue-level functional networks to study mRNA isoform functional
relationships, providing a higher resolution view of biological processes as compared to traditional
gene-level networks. Learning the differences in the functional connections of mRNA isoforms of
the same gene are crucial for functional genomics, and helps us in deepening our understanding of
gene functions. Determining the functional interaction patterns of mRNA-isoforms of the same
gene also provides useful information about biological regulation, diseases, and stress response
caused by AS.
It is widely believed that the fate of biological processes and pathways varies with different mRNA
isoforms of the same gene. Many pathways and molecular processes differ across cell and tissuetypes. These mechanisms are also altered by external conditions such as abiotic and biotic stress.
Understanding of such deviations in cell, tissue and condition specific functional relationships
would be of interest to understand the perturbed mechanisms.
Based on the analysis of 359 mouse tissue-specific RNA-Seq samples along with 9 diverse
sequence properties, we have constructed 17 tissue-specific mRNA isoform level functional
networks. These networks constitute ~10.6 million unique functional and ~3.5 million nonfunctional mRNA isoform interactions across 17 tissues. In addition to these tissue-specific
networks, we have also developed an organism-wide reference network. We show that TENSION
is highly accurate with very high precision and recall by comparing our predictions with class label
shuffled datasets, ten-fold stratified cross validation, previous method, and updated annotations

from gene ontology, pathway databases and PPIs. In addition to these, we also validate our
predictions by using a gene set of 20 ubiquitously expressed genes and 1654 genes with a very
high expression in one tissue from the transcriptomic BodyMap of mouse. The improvement in
the performance (compared to the original study) of Bayesian network based MIL method on our
dataset also prove the utility of TENSION in generating better mRNA isoform level datasets.
Our tissue-specific networks capture the differences in functional relationships of mRNA isoforms
of the same gene across multiple tissues highlighting the importance of tissue-specific changes in
biological processes and pathways. We are also able to distinguish the tissue-specific functional
mRNA isoforms of a gene. We also find that different mRNA isoforms of the same gene are
enriched in different tissues, suggesting differential tissue-level activity of mRNA isoforms of the
same gene. Furthermore, we also see that morphologically and functionally similar tissues tend to
have more consistent mRNA isoform expression profile.
By studying the gene level networks in conjunction with mRNA-isoform level functional
networks, we are able to gain different insights into the molecular mechanisms of biological
processes. Diving down further into the tissue-specific networks sheds more light on the tissuelevel activities of a gene and its mRNA isoforms. The central genes identified in these tissue-level
networks are enriched in tissue related processes.
In summary, we provide the research community with a comprehensive characterization of mRNA
isoform level tissue-specific functional networks for mouse. TENSION is simple and generic,
making it easily applicable to other organisms. We expect that these networks will allow further
in-depth investigations of the impact of alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms on biological
processes. We anticipate that tissue-specific mRNA-isoform functional networks will find wide
