Abstract:
Despite evidence linking the human microbiome to health and disease, the mechanistic details of how
the microbiota affects human physiology remain largely unknown. Metabolites encoded by bacteria are
expected to play an integral role in the microbiota’s effect on its human host. Assigning function to these
metabolites is therefore critical to determining the molecular underpinnings of the host-microbe
relationship and ultimately developing microbiota inspired therapies. Here we use large-scale functional
screening of small molecules produced by individual members of a simplified human microbiota to identify
bacterial metabolites that agonize G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). This analysis revealed a
complex network of metabolite host receptor interactions and guided our identification of multiple
microbiota derived agonists of GPCRs associated with diverse biological functions within the nervous
and immune systems, among others. Collectively, the metabolite-receptor pairs we uncovered indicate
that diverse aspects of human health are potentially modulated by structurally simple metabolites arising
from primary bacterial metabolism.

Statement of Significance: Bacteria residing within the human body have been shown to influence
human health. It is likely that physiological responses to the human microbiota are mediated by the
collection of small molecules encoded within these bacteria. In this study we use direct functional
screening of small molecules produced by individual members of a simplified human microbiota to identify
new G protein coupled receptor-metabolite interactions that seek to explain the molecular underpinnings
of the microbiota’s influence on its human host.

Human bodies are home to diverse and ever-changing collections of bacteria. The ability of the microbiota
to influence human health has been explored extensively. [1] The most common methods for studying
host-microbe interactions have featured “omics” based-analyses that have examined genomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolic differences between patient cohorts. [2-5] Although these
informatics-based methods have served as powerful tools for uncovering correlations between changes
in the microbiota and health and disease, they are somewhat limited in their ability to reveal the
mechanistic details of how the microbiota might alter mammalian physiology.[6] Much of the influence
the microbiota has on its human host is likely encoded in the collection of small molecules it produces or
modulates.[7] However, the number of well-defined interactions between metabolites produced by human
associated bacteria and discrete human receptors is dwarfed by the number of reports attributing
biological phenotypes to the microbiome, highlighting the need for a more systematic characterization of
microbiota encoded bioactive metabolites.
In the case of synthetic small molecules that have proved useful for therapeutically modulating human
physiology (i.e., U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs) the majority (60-70%)
function through just three classes of receptors: G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), ion channels, or
nuclear hormone receptors.[8] Many of these same proteins bind endogenous signaling molecules that
regulate a wide range of physiological responses.[9] Based on the fact that these receptors play such an
important role in how eukaryotic cells have evolved to translate external chemicals into biologic
responses, it is likely the microbiota affects host physiology by modulating these same receptors with
secreted metabolites.
Although healthy humans are colonized by hundreds, if not thousands of different bacterial species, the
metabolic diversity they generate is likely limited by a high level of biosynthetic redundancy between
bacterial species.[10] Due at least in part to this metabolic redundancy, it has been possible to use
simplified human microbiomes (SIHUMIs) to model health and disease in murine models.[11, 12] In lieu
of exploring random individual commensal species, we sought to conduct a more in-depth investigation
of GPCR active microbiota encoded metabolites using bacteria from a model SIHUMI that contained a
taxonomically diverse collection of commensal, health promoting and pathogenic bacteria. This
consortium, which is composed of seven bacteria, assembled as a tool for studying gastrointestinal
inflammation in the context of a healthy bacterial flora fulfills these general criteria and was therefore
selected for use in this study.[13] Bacteria present in the SIHUMI consortium represent the major taxa
found in the human microbiome and include beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium
longum, and Faecalibacterium prauznitzii), non-pathogenic bacteria associated with disease
(Bacteroides vulgatus and Ruminococcus gnavus), as well as clinically relevant pathogens (Escherichia
coli LF-82 and Enterococcus faecalis).
We screened the metabolites produced by individually grown members of this SIHUMI consortium for
agonism against 241 GPCRs. The resulting interaction map provides evidence, at the molecular level,
for the existence of a complex network of microbial-host interactions, many of which involve receptors
that have been modulated therapeutically with synthetic small molecules. Our characterization of
interactions predicted by this analysis led to the discovery of both previously unrecognized as well as
known microbiota encoded GPCR agonists. The structures of the active molecules we identified support
the growing notion that simple bacterial metabolites arising from primary metabolic processes are likely
to broadly impact human physiology.
Results:
Culturing bacteria and GPCR screening:
Bacteria from the SIHUMI consortium were individually fermented under anaerobic conditions in separate
large scale (20L) culture vessels (Figure 1). After 10 days of static fermentation at 37 °C, hydrophobic
resin was added directly to each culture. The resulting suspension was mixed to allow organic metabolites
present in the fermentation broth to bind to the absorbent resin. Metabolite loaded resin was then

collected by filtration, washed, and the bound metabolites were eluted with acetone. Each resulting crude
metabolite extract was partitioned into 9 metabolite-rich fractions using reversed phased flash
chromatography. A small aliquot of each fraction was arrayed for use in high-throughput GPCR
screening. The remaining material was saved for follow up assays and for use in molecule isolation and
structure elucidation studies. Although this pre-fractionation process increases the number of samples to
be screened it simplifies the complexity of the crude culture broth extracts, which improves the signal in
the primary screen thereby increasing the diversity of interactions that are identified and facilitating the
downstream isolation of bioactive compounds. In addition to the bacterial fermentations, media not
inoculated with bacteria was processed under identical conditions to control for possible bioactivity of
small molecules derived directly from the media. The resulting library of bacterial metabolites was then
screened with a cell-based assay for fractions that could agonize members of a panel of 241 GPCRs
(Table S1). Specifically, a collection of recombinant cell lines engineered to measure β-arrestin
recruitment by individual GPCR targets (β-arrestin recruitment assay) was used. For GPCRs with well
characterized endogenous ligands, a maximum value for β-arrestin recruitment (100%) was set by
exposing the recombinant cell line to a known agonist (Table S1). In the case of orphan receptors (i.e.,
receptors without well characterized endogenous ligands), normalization of β-arrestin recruitment was
performed by assigning the vehicle control to 0% activity. Hits were classified as such if a fraction induced
a GPCR response to >30% of the control ligand (>50% for orphan GPCRs) and the comparable media
control fraction showed <30% activity against the same GPCR (<50% for orphan GPCRs).
The bacterial fraction library induced β-arrestin recruitment above our hit threshold levels for 67 of the
241 individual GPCR reporter cell lines we tested (Figure 2A-B, Table S2-S3). Of these 67 GPCRs, 54
did not show a strong background signal from the corresponding media control fraction, suggesting they
were responding to bacterially encoded metabolites. Manual review of these 54 hits led us to de-prioritize
15 of these GPCR-fraction pairs due to high background of either the receptor or fraction (Table S4). The
remaining 39 GPCRs were re-assayed in replicate; 22 of these GPCRs showed reproducible β-arrestin
recruitment in response to 1 or more bacterial fractions (Figure 2C). Based on data from the Human
Protein Atlas most of the receptors that reproducibly responded to bacterial metabolites are expressed
at body sites regularly exposed to the microbiota (Figure 2C).[14] Notably, a large number of the receptors
that were reproducibly agonized by microbiota encoded metabolites are also targeted by FDA approved
drugs, indicating that receptors with proven physiological relevance are potentially modulated by bacterial
ligands (Figure 2C). To identify specific GPCR-active metabolites, we used bioassay-guided isolation to
purify metabolites from the large-scale culture broth fractions and de novo structure elucidation methods
to determine their structures.
Known and novel ligands for hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors:
A number of receptors agonized in our screen are known to respond to bacterial ligands. As an initial
validation exercise we characterized activities expected to arise from well-known bacterial GPCR
agonists. The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors, GPR81, GPR109A and GPR109B, are agonized by both
human and bacterial ligands.[15] Bioassay guided fractionation of GPR109A active fractions from
cultures of both L. plantarum and R. gnavus yielded nicotinic acid (Vitamin B3) as the active metabolite
(Figure 3A, Figure S1). Nicotinic acid, an essential nutrient acquired either through diet or gut bacteria,
is the most extensively studied non-endogenous ligand for this receptor. Its ability to regulate lipid
metabolism in hyperlipidemic patients is well established in the clinic.[16] The identification of this well
characterized and in vivo validated ligand receptor pair suggests that data generated in our screen has
the potential to uncover new biologically relevant metabolite GPCR interactions.
Fractions derived from cultures of both E. coli LF82 and L. plantarum agonized a second
hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor, GPR109B. Bioassay guided fractionation did not identify the
endogenous ligand produced in humans, 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid, but instead yielded phenylpropanoic
acid as the active metabolite (Figure 3B, Figure S1). This previously unknown GPR109B agonist, elicited
a similar GPCR response than did 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid (Figure 3B). While the EC50 values for the

known and novel ligands (304 μM and 208 μM, respectively) are higher than is often seen for endogenous
GPCR ligands (Table S1), no more potent GPR109B agonists have been identified, outside of those
derived synthetically.[17] Whether this is an inherent attribute of the receptor or represents a failure to
identify the natural human ligand for this receptor remains to be seen.
Phenylpropanoic acid is not produced natively by humans. Its presence in human fecal and sera samples
has been attributed to either de novo biosynthesis by bacteria or microbial transformation of dietary
compounds, most notably by species of Clostridium.[18-21] While we believe phenylpropanoic acid is the
first microbiota derived agonist to be identified for GPR109B, in a screen of synthetic molecules, several
aromatic D-amino acids were found to be GPR109B agonists that can trigger chemoattraction signaling
pathways in leukocytes.[22, 23] In a quantitative analysis of human fecal water, phenylpropanoic acid
was reported in healthy patients at an average concentration of 77.30 μg/mL (513 μM).[18] At this
concentration, production of phenylpropanoic acid by gut bacteria would be high enough to expect
agonism of GPR109B. An analysis of the concentration of phenylpropanoic acid in a larger number of
patient samples will be required to determine whether phenylpropanoic acid dependent agonism of
GPR109B is likely to be a common phenomenon in the gut.
Known and novel ligands for neurotransmitter receptors:
Our GPCR interaction map revealed numerous bacterial fractions that strongly agonized neurotransmitter
receptors, a key component of the gut brain axis (Figure 1C).[24] Bacterial produced aromatic amines,
most notably tryptamine, have recently been reported as agonists of neurotransmitter receptors,
particularly serotonergic GPCRs (5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, HTRs).[25] A majority of bacteria in this
SIHUMI produced fractions that agonized HTRs (Figure 3C). Isolation of the active metabolite yielded
tryptamine, which was produced in varying quantities by members of this SIHUMI (Figure S3). These
results agree with various reports that HTRs are responsive to a wide array of bacteria due to the
generality of tryptamine production across species.[26]
In fractions from multiple bacterial species we observed agonism of the D2-type dopamine receptors
(DRDs), DRD2 and DRD3 (Figure 3D). Bioassay-guided isolation led to the aromatic amine tyramine as
the major metabolite responsible for DRD agonism in these fractions. Tyramine arises from
decarboxylation of tyrosine and differs from dopamine only by the absence of a second hydroxyl on the
aromatic ring. It is reported to accumulate to μM levels in the gastrointestinal tract, a phenomenon which
has been attributed to production by human microbiota.[27] While no biological significance has been
assigned to the microbiota dependent accumulation of tyramine in animal models, it is sufficiently potent
that its observed concentration in the gastrointestinal tract is high enough to agonize D2 subtype DRDs.
In contrast to the broad activation seen for DRDs and HTRs across extracts from all of the bacteria in
this consortium, a specific response to fractions from E. coli LF82 was detected for a member of the
histamine receptor (HRH) family, HRH4. Our inability to retain HRH4-activity when using hydrophobic
chromatography during the bioassay guided purification process suggested that the active molecule was
highly polar. We did not, however, expect that the activity was due to bacterially produced histamine, as
the active fraction did not agonize other HRH family receptors and we could not detect histamine by LCMS or NMR. We ultimately found the polyamine cadaverine to be the metabolite responsible for HRH4
agonism (Figure 4A). The activity of cadaverine was confirmed using a commercial standard (EC50 1.1
μM) (Figure 4B). In addition to cadaverine, bacteria commonly produce a number of other simple
polyamines including agmatine, spermidine and putrescine.[28] To explore the promiscuity of HRH4
agonism by polyamines, we tested synthetic standards of these metabolites for the ability to induce βarrestin recruitment by each member of the HRH receptor family. Agmatine and putrescine showed
limited activity against HRH4 (Figure 4C), while spermidine did not show activity against any receptor in
the family. The inability for humans to biosynthesize cadaverine suggests that the influence of polyamines
on histamine signaling pathways is likely specific to bacterial metabolism.

Cadaverine is produced by bacteria through the decarboxylation of lysine (Figure 4A), while agmatine
and putrescine are derived from arginine. In a number of bacteria, including many associated with the
microbiota (Table S5), cadaverine is encoded by both the constitutive ldc gene cluster as well as the cad
gene cluster, which is induced at low pH (pH <6.8).[29] High level production of cadaverine by the CadA
lysine decarboxylase plays a role in protecting against acid stress.[30]. As the pH of the digestive system
varies longitudinally and features multiple acidic sections (e.g., cecum pH ~5.7), high level production of
polyamines by cad gene cluster containing bacteria is likely to occur at numerous sites in the GI tract.
The biological relevance of gastrointestinal production of polyamines remains unclear, however host
responses to polyamines have been reported in various contexts.[31, 32] Interestingly, although
histamine receptor subtypes differ in their associated functions and their distribution throughout the
human body, HRH4 is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and altered expression levels have been
linked to inflammatory responses that are related to inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer.[33]
A growing number of studies have uncovered connections between gut microbiota and the nervous
system.[34, 35] Our exploration of microbiota encoded neurotransmitter receptor agonists expands the
mechanistic evidence for simple biogenic amines serving as potentially widespread modulators of the
gut-brain axis.[14] These data imply that microbiota-dependent dopaminergic, serotonergic and
histaminergic responses likely represent general signaling events in the gastrointestinal tract with varying
activation profiles depending on the specific collection of bacteria present in an individual’s microbiome.
Structurally distinct lipids agonize diverse GPCRs:
Lipids, which represent diverse GPCR active ligands [36, 37], predominantly elute very late in our
fractionation protocol (Figure 5A). Based on the receptor interaction map we could initially classify
GPCRs as lipid responsive if they were agonized by the late lipid-enriched fractions of the extract library.
A subset of receptors, including GPR120, CNR2, GPR171, GPR132, responded broadly to the lipid
fraction from most of the consortium, whereas other responses were specific to particular species (BAI1,
NMU1R, UTR2). HPLC-charged aerosol detection analysis of the lipid fractions indicated they contained
not only mixtures of simple saturated fatty acids but also other more complex lipid species (Figure 5B).
Marrying unique receptor activity profiles with unique lipid signals guided us to previously unrecognized
bacteria encoded GPCR agonists.
The brain angiogenesis factor 1 (BAI1) receptor was agonized by lipid fractions from the Gram-negative
bacteria in the consortium: E. coli and B. vulgatus. The E. coli LF82 lipid fraction showed the most potent
agonism of BAI1 and therefore it was selected for further analysis. Bioassay guided fractionation
identified the BAI1 agonist as the cyclopropyl-containing lipid 9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid (EC50
11 μM). Synthetic 9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid, but no saturated lipids we tested agonized BAI1,
confirming the specificity of the receptor reflected in the initial GPCR activity map (Figure 5C). The
enzyme cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase (Cfa) uses the one carbon donor S-adenosyl-Lmethionine to generate cyclopropyl lipids from unsaturated fatty acids (Figure 5G). Cyclopropanecontaining fatty acids are important membrane components in Gram-negative as well as mycolic acid
bacteria.[38] Macrophages use BAI1 as a pattern recognition receptor to sense Gram-negative bacteria
and to induce selective phagocytosis and antimicrobial responses; 9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid
may represent a previously unrecognized recognition motif for innate immune responses.[39-42]
Two peptide receptors NMU1R (neuromedin receptor 1), which mediates satiety and peristalsis in the
gut [43, 44] and the vasoconstriction inducing urotensin 2 receptor (UTR2) responded specifically to lipid
fractions generated from B. vulgatus. Isolation of the active metabolite yielded the anteiso-methyl
branched-chain fatty acid 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (aiC15:0) (Figure 5D). Anteiso-fatty acids (ai)
contain an alkyl branch at the ante-penultimate carbon in contrast to iso-fatty acids (i) which branch at
the penultimate carbon. Both synthetic and natural aiC15:0, but no simple fatty acids we tested, agonized
NMU1R (EC50 125 μM) and UTR2 (EC50 191 μM). Lipid sensitivity of NMU1R and UTR2 appears specific
to aiC15:0, as fatty acids with even slightly modified branching patterns (iC15:0) or carbon chain length

(aiC17:0) displayed minimal agonist activity (Figure 5E-F). Methyl branched fatty acids arise from the use
of a branched primer in place of acetyl CoA in normal fatty acid biosynthesis. In the case of anteisomethyl-branched fatty acids, 2-methyl-butyryl-CoA, which is derived from isoleucine is used to prime fatty
acid biosynthesis (Figure 5G). The selectivity for branched primers lies with the β-ketoacyl acyl carrier
protein synthase (KAS III or FABH) that carries out the first condensation in fatty acid biosynthesis.
Anteiso-methyl fatty acids are predominantly produced by Gram-positive FABH enzymes.[45, 46]
Roughly 10% of bacteria have lipid pools enriched in branched chain fatty acids.[45] B. vulgatus, is among
those bacteria enriched in branched chain fatty acids and maintains aiC15:0 as ~30% of its total fatty
acid repertoire.[47]
Bacteria are known to produce diverse and oftentimes taxa specific, collections of lipids. The examples
described here from examining even this minimized model microbiome suggest the potential for markedly
different receptor activation profiles and hence biological consequences depending on the specific lipid
signature encoded by an individual’s microbiome. For BAI1, NMU1R and UTR2 our data suggests that
they differentially respond to lipids produced by largely Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria
indicating that their activities will fluctuate with changes in the gross taxonomic composition of a
microbiome.
Analysis of mice colonized with the seven strain SIHUMI consortium:
In parallel with our in vitro screen studies, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry-based
metabolomics to compare germ free and SIHUMI consortium colonized mice. For this analysis, cultures
of individually grown bacteria from the consortium were combined and the mixed sample was gavaged
into germ-free C57BL/6 mice. PCR based species analysis of DNA extracted from the stool of animals
three days post inoculation confirmed their colonization by the consortium. Ten days post colonization
the lumen material (cecal stool) was collected from the germ-free controls as well as the SIHUMI
colonized animals. Using targeted high-resolution mass spectrometry, we looked for differences in
metabolite accumulation in these samples (Figure 6).
Targeted MS analysis of cecum extracts revealed that all but one of the GPCR-active metabolites we
identified was enriched in these mice compared to their abiotic counterparts (Figure 6, Table S7),
suggesting a largely parallel biosynthesis in laboratory grown mono-cultures and the consortium in vivo.
The lone exception was phenylpropanoic acid. Our failure to identify phenylpropanoic acid in this specific
model study does not preclude its potential biologic relevance in other settings, especially in light of the
fact that it has been seen at μM levels in human patient samples.[18] The lack of in vivo production is
likely due to low production of this metabolite by the specific strain used in this consortium, which is
supported by the low GPR109B activity we observed in our original fraction screen.
Discussion:
Phenylpropanoic acid, cadaverine, 9-10-methylenehexadecanoic acid, and 12-methyltetradecanoic acid
add to a growing list of structurally simple molecules that are capable of modulating human signaling
pathways that underlie diverse clinically relevant areas of physiology including immune recognition,
neurotransmission, and inflammation.[35, 48] The biosynthetic simplicity of these metabolites combined
with their abundant starting materials likely drives their high titers in the gut and potential broad biological
relevance. Expanding functional screening to include not only more bacteria but also additional culture
conditions and receptor families will undoubtedly provide additional insight into the biochemical
mechanisms and small molecules underlying human-microbiome interactions. For example, a study that
was published while the work reported here was under review examined a different collection of bacteria
and identified different GPCR active metabolites.[49] Advancements in laboratory culturing techniques
now allow for a majority of gut bacteria to be cultured from fecal samples.[50, 51] Systematic functional
screening of metabolites produced by this growing collection of bacteria is likely to be a rewarding avenue
for developing mechanistic hypotheses that can be tested in specific animal models.

Materials and Methods
Media construction: LBM media: LBM media was derivative of a media recipe previously utilized
in our laboratory. For 1 L media: Bring 17 g/L brain heart infusion, 5 g/L yeast extract, 200 mg
MgSO4•7H2O, 100 mg MnCl2•4H2O up in 800 mL deionized water and autoclave for 30 minutes
liquid cycle. After coming to room temp, add supplements (final concentrations: 5 μg/L hemin, 1
g/L maltose, 1 g/L cellobiose, and 0.5g/L L-cysteine), which can be made ahead of time and
stored, protected from light, at -20 °C in aliquots, except hemin which can be stored at 4 °C and
L-cysteine which should be made fresh. Use autoclaved deionized water to bring final volume to
1 L. For culturing anaerobes: place media in anaerobic chambers for at least 48 hrs to allow
diffusion with anaerobic gas.
Cultivation of bacteria: Bacterial strains of the SIHUMI consortium used listed in Table S2.
Cultures of <1 L: Anaerobic bacteria were cultured in an incubator set to 37 °C placed inside of
vinyl anaerobic chamber (Coy) with a gas mix of 5% CO2, 5% H2, and 90% N2. Cultures of >1 L:
When cultivating bacteria for construction of bacterial extract library, bacteria were inoculated in
1 L or 2 L media bottles (Chemglass) inside anaerobic chamber, then sealed with anaerobic septa
(Chemglass) and moved into large walk-in 37 °C incubator constructed from a 6x6x12 light
protective tent (APOLLO® HORTICULTURE) outfitted with a regulator (INKBIRD®), heat source
(VORNADO®), and ventilation system (IPOWER®). Freezer stocks of the SIHUMI cohort were
generously donated by the Mucida laboratory (Rockefeller University). Freezer stocks were
thawed and bacteria were cultivated overnight in LBM media until turbid. These bacteria were
streaked onto LBM agar plates and upon growth, single colonies were picked, cultivated
overnight, and genotyped (GeneWiz). Upon confirmation of genetic identity, these same cultures
were used to generate colony 20% glycerol stocks that would be used for the entirety of the study.
Bacteria specific primers were designed to allow for PCR-based identification of each specific
strain.

used: Bacterial stocks were thawed and used to inoculate 5 mL LBM liquid cultures that were
cultivated overnight. The next day, species specific primers were used to confirm identity (as
described below) and upon passing purity check, these 5 mL cultures were used to inoculate 500
mL LBM at a ~1:100 ratio. After turbidity was reached, an aliquot of the 500 mL culture was
removed and PCR was performed with universal 16s rRNA primers 27F
(AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492R (GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT). The CR product
was subject to Sanger sequencing (GeneWiz) and upon passing inspection for the correct
species, the 500 mL culture was used to inoculate 12 L of LBM media at a 1:100 inoculation ratio.
The 20 L cultures were cultivated, protected from light at 37 °C, for 10 days without shaking.
Amerlite XAD-7HP (Sigma Aldrich) was aliquoted in 20 g increments and activated by soaking in
methanol for 10 minutes, followed by 5 washes with deionized water to remove excess methanol.
After 10 days, activated Amberlite XAD-7HP was added to the cultures (20 g dry weight/L) and
the slurries were gently shaken (90 rpm) on a tabletop shaker for 4 hrs. After incubation with the
cultures, the resin was removed via cheese-cloth filtration and the collected resin. alongside the

acetone elution was allowed to occur for 2 hrs with shaking (150 rpm), after which the organic
solvent was collected and fresh acetone, of equivalent volume, was added. This second elution
was allowed to occur overnight with light shaking at 22 °C. Both elutions were added together and
solvent was removed via rotary evaporation (Buchi) at 25 °C to afford the dry crude extract, which
was stored at -20 °C until fractionated, as detailed below.
Fractionation of bacterial extracts: Crude extracts (~1-3 g/12L) were re-suspended in ~300 mL
methanol and the soluble material was decanted into a 500 mL round bottom flask (rbf). Free C18
resin (2-3 g) was added and the slurry was evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary
evaporator with temperature set to 25 °C (Buchi). The dry material was collected from the rbf,
packed semi-tightly into a 50 g cartridge, and capped with a passive frit (Teledyne). This material
was chromatographed over a 150 g C18 Gold (Teledyne ISCO) using a solvent system of water
(Solvent A) and methanol (Solvent B), with no acid added, with the following conditions. 5 column
volumes (CV) of 5% B, 5% B to 99% B over 10 CV, flush with 10 CV 99% B. All flow-through was
collected in 50 mL tubes and combined as follows:
Solvent was evaporated using an SPD-2010 speedvac (Thermo Scientific) with a RH-19 rotor
(Thermo Scientific) and the resulting dry material was weighed and resuspended at 100 mg/mL
using ACS grade DMSO (Fisher Scientific). Of this solution, 250 µL was removed and added to
250 µL DMSO to create 500 µL 50 mg/mL solution; this solution was aliquoted into various sizes
of 96-well plates for facile thawing and biological testing at a later time. The remaining 100 mg/mL
solution was stored at -80 °C until validation studies required material for bio-assay guided
fractionation.
GPCR assays
GPCR activities were measured by Eurofins DiscoverX using the PathHunter® β-Arrestin
assay.[1] This assay uses β-galactosidase (β-Gal) that has been split into two inactive portions
as a reporter to measure the activation of a GPCR. The β-Gal fragments are called EA for Enzyme
Acceptor and ED for Enzyme Donor.(US Patent: US20090098588A1). Using these fragments, a
unique reported cell line was created for each GPCR of interest. In each unique cell line the EA
fragment is fused to β-Arrestin and the ED fragment is fused to the GPCR of interest. Upon GPCR
activation, β-Arrestin recruitment to the receptor physically colocalizes the ED and EA fragments
thereby restoring β-Gal activity. β-Gal complementation is measured using chemiluminescent
PathHunter® Detection Reagents. For our initial screen (Figure 2) all 80 culture broth extract
fractions were screened in singleton against the Eurofins DiscoverX gpcrMAX (168 GPCRs, Table
S2) and orphanMAX (73 GPCRs, Table S3) panels. All subsequent validation and bioassay
guided fraction studies were run in at least duplicate using individual reporter cell lines for specific
GPCRs of interest.
Eurofins DiscoverX generic agonist protocol:
1. Sample is added to individual GPCR reporter cell lines grown in microtiter plates. Cells are
incubated at 37 °C or room temperature for 90 or 180 minutes. 2. Assay signal is generated
through addition of 12.5 or 15 μL (50% v/v) of PathHunter Detection reagent cocktail, followed by
incubation for a one hour at room temperature. 3. Microplates are read with a PerkinElmer
EnvisionTM instrument for chemiluminescent signal detection. 4. Compound activity is analyzed
using the CBIS data analysis suite (ChemInnovation, CA). For receptors with known ligands,
percentage activity is calculated using the following formula: % Activity =100% x (mean RLU of
test sample — mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean MAX control ligand — mean RLU of vehicle
control). For orphan receptors, percentage inhibition is calculated using the following simplified
formula: % Activity =100% x (mean RLU of test sample — mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean

sensitive PathHunter Flash Kit is used.
Cadaverine biosynthesis bioinformatics
Using the annotated genome of E. coli LF-82 the Pfam protein features of CadA (Accession ID
LF82_0254) or the amino acid sequence itself were used as a query against the annotated
genome collection provided by the NIH Human Microbiome Project.[2, 3] This dataset was chosen
as it allowed us to confidently assign annotated bacterial genomes containing a cadA gene to
body sites origin. For the Pfam analysis: three Pfam motifs are found within the CadA amino acid
sequence: PF01276 constitutes the major domain of the decarboxylase, PF03711 constitutes the
C-terminal domain and PF03709 constitutes the N-terminal domain. The raw data for both BlastP
(>30% identity) and Pfam-based analyses are available in Table S5a and S5b, respectively.
High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry of purified compounds
High Resolution Mass Spectrometry was acquired on a C18 column (Thermo Acclaim 120 C18,
2.1 x 150 mM) using a Dionex U-3000 HPLC system connected to an LTQ-Orbitrap Mass
Spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher).
Murine work
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (PI Cohen IACUC-2016-0491). Germ free C57BL/6 mice were
maintained in sterile isolators with autoclaved food and water in the Gnotobiotic Facility of the
Faith Lab at Mount Sinai. 6-week-old mice were used for all experiments (3M and 3F in the
treatment group, 5M and 1F in the control group). The treatment group was colonized with the
SIHUMI whereas the control group was left germ free. For colonization studies 5 ml of an
overnight culture in LBM media of the SIHUMI (treatment group) was centrifuged at 500 x g for 2
minutes, the supernatant was decanted and the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of sterile PBS.
Germ free mice were gavaged with 100 µL of bacterial culture immediately upon removal from
sterile isolators. Colonization was confirmed by collection of fecal pellets after 3 days. Crude DNA
was extracted from fecal pellets per protocol (ZymoBIOMICS DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit) and
colonization conformed by targeted PCR of each strain using specific primers as detailed above.
After colonization mice were housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions and fed with autoclaved
water and food. After colonization for 7 days the mice were euthanized and samples were
collected for analysis. 200 mg of cecal contents were collected from each mouse and placed
immediately at -80 °C. The animal experiments were not randomized and the investigators were
not blinded to the allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. No statistical methods
were used to predetermine sample size. All mice which completed the experiments were
analyzed.
Metabolite quantitation by mass spectrometry
Cecal samples were weighed into 2 mL microtubes containing 2.8 mm ceramic beads (Omni
International) and resuspended to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL using 80:20 methanol:water
containing phenol-d7, palmitic acid-d31 and 13C,15N-amino acid internal standards (Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories). Homogenization was using a Bead Ruptor (Omni International) at 6 m/s
for 30 s for 6 cycles, at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 20,000 x g at 4 °C and
then divided for 3 analytical methods.
Method 1: GC-nCI-MS with PFB Derivatization. 100 µL of cecal extract was added to 100 µL
of 100 mM borate Buffer (pH 10), 400 µL of 100 mM pentafluorobenzyl bromide (Thermo
Scientific) in acetone (Fisher), and 400 µL of cyclohexane (Acros Organics) in a sealed
autosampler vial. Samples were heated to 65 °C for 1 hour with shaking. After cooling to room

temperature and allowing the layers to separate, 100 μL of the cyclohexane upper phase was
transferred to autosampler vial containing a glass insert and sealed. Analyzed was using an GCMS (Agilent 7890A GC system, Agilent 5975C MS detector) operating in negative chemical
ionization mode, using a DB-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25, 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies),
methane as the reagent gas and 1 μL split injection (1:5 split ratio). Raw peak areas for aromatic
analytes (tyramine and hydrocinnamic acid) were normalized to phenol-d7 internal standard and
lipid analytes (9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid and 12-methyltetradecanoic acid) were
normalized to palmitic acid-d31 internal standard. Data analysis was performed using MassHunter
Quantitative Analysis software (version B.09, Agilent Technologies).
Method 2: LC triple quadrupole with reverse phase chromatography. 200 µL of extract was
dried using a vacuum concentrator (Genevac) and resuspended in 400 µL 50:50 methanol:water,
clarified by centrifugation and analyzed suing reverse phase chromatography coupled to TSQ
Vantage triple quadupole mass spectrometer with HESI II source. LC separation was using an
HSS T3 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm particle size, Waters) and Agilent 1260 binary pump.

acquired and analyzed using TraceFinder software (version 4.1, Thermo Scientific) confirmed by
comparison with authentic standards.
Method 3: LC Q-TOF with HILIC chromatography. Samples were prepared as for Method 2 but
then resuspended in 200 μL 60:40 acetonitrile:water and analyzed by hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC) coupled to the 6545 Q-TOF mass spectrometer with Dual JetStream
source (Agilent). The LC separation was using an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column
(150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle size, Waters) and Agilent 1290 Infinity II binary pump. Mobile
phase A was 90:10 water:acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.2% acetic acid, and
mobile phase B was 10:90 wate:acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.2% acetic
acid. The gradient was 0 min, 95% B; 9 min, 70% B; 10 min, 40% B; 13 min, 30% B; 15 min, 95%
B. LC parameters were: flow rate 400 μL/min, column temperature 40 °C, and injection volume
5 μL. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode. MS parameters were:
gas temp: 325 °C; gas flow: 10 L/min; nebulizer pressure: 35 psig; sheath gas temp: 400 °C;
sheath gas flow: 12 L/min; VCap: 4,000 V; fragmentor: 125 V. Active reference mass correction
was done through a second nebulizer using masses with m/z: 12.050873 and 922.009798. Data
were acquired over m/z range 50–1700 and analyzed using MassHunter Profinder software
(version B.09, Agilent) and confirmed by comparison with a cadaverine authentic standard.
Compiling these data sets in GraphPad Prizm was then used to derive p-values. Unpaired t test
(two-tailed) were used.
Tyramine. Fraction 3 from E. coli LF82 was chosen as the pilot fraction for the dopamine
receptors. 1 mL of Fraction 3 (100 mg/mL in DMSO) was dried down resuspended in 1 mL 50/50
MeOH:H2O and injected in 50 µL increments onto a semi-preparative 250 x 10 mm Luna® Omega
2.6 uM Polar C18 LC column on an Agilent 1100 HPLC with a solvent system where Solvent A
was H2O + 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B was CH3CN + 0.1% formic acid. The chromatographic
method was as follows: 0% B for 5 CV, then up to 90% B over 15 CV, with a 5 CV hold at 90% B.

this compound was identified as 9,10-methylenehexadecanoic acid by NMR and HRMS. (LCHRMS-ESI (m/z): [M-H]- calcd for C15H30O2, 241.2245; found 241.2178). 12-methylmyristic acid:
1
