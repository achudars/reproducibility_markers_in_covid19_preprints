Abstract

13

How tumors arise from individual transformed cells within an intact epithelium is a central,

14

yet unanswered question. Here, we developed a new methodology that combines breast

15

tissue organoids, where oncogenes can be switched on in single cells, with light-sheet

16

imaging that allows us to track cell fates using a big-image-data analysis workflow. The

17

power of this integrated approach is illustrated by our finding that small local groups of

18

transformed cells form tumors while isolated transformed cells do not.

19

Main Text

20

Organoid cultures grown from cell-lines or primary cells have been successfully employed to

21

study molecular mechanisms during different stages of tumorigenesis1-3. However, they

22

usually allow oncogenic activation in all cells of the tissue and therefore cannot reproduce

23

the localized transformation at a defined part of the tissue that is seen in the patient situation.

24

Hence, stochastic tumor models need to be established wherein only a few tumorigenic cells

25

expand in a normal epithelium. It is of key importance to visualize the interactions between a

26

transformed cell and the normal neighboring epithelium in order to better understand the

27

tumor initiation process in the context of its immediate microenvironment4.

28

Long term imaging of complex primary organoids has been achieved via light-sheet

29

microscopy5, 6 and have benefited from the lower phototoxicity. However, past advancements

30

still came with trade-offs resulting in limited cellular and temporal resolution. Tracking single

31

cell dynamics necessitates high resolution imaging which in turn limits the time frame in which

32

organoids can be imaged without phototoxic effects7. Conversely, imaging primary organoids

33

for longer time periods requires an offset of temporal and cellular resolution that eventually

34

cannot allow single cell fate tracking8.

35

Here we present a novel stochastic model of breast tumorigenesis where only single cells

36

express oncogenes in primary murine organoids. We thereby overcome the above-

37

mentioned limitations of studying tumorgenesis events. Furthermore, we report long-term

38

imaging of these organoids for the first time at a temporal resolution that allows us to follow

39

single cell fates. We also integrate this approach with an image analysis pipeline capable of

40

segmenting cells in their dynamic progression towards tumorigenesis, so they can be tracked

41

individually over time.

42

For modelling tumorigenesis in breast tissue, we use an inducible model of breast cancer9-11

43

that has been shown to recapitulate hallmarks of human breast disease3, 12 (Fig.1a). In this

44

tractable transgenic mouse model, the activity of two potent oncogenes -Myc and Neu (the

45

rodent homolog for the human HER2 gene)- can be spatially limited by tissue specific

46

expression of the rtTA inducer-protein to the cells of the mammary lineage and temporally

47

controlled by the addition of doxycycline in the media or animal diet13. We adapt this tissue

48

wide tumorigenesis model (tri-transgenic (T) model) to generate a stochastic system by

49

retaining only the oncogenic constructs (bi-transgenic (B) model). The rtTA inducer gene is

50

then lentivirally delivered to single cells, preventing tissue wide transformation.

51

Primary mammary epithelial cells derived from transgenic mice were seeded in 3D matrigel

52

as single cells, to form small acini. A small number of single cells in these acini were then

53

transduced with lentiviral particles (Fig.1a, middle panel). In the tissue-wide tumorigenesis

54

model(T), organoids were transduced with the reporter virus (pLv-pGK-H2B-GFP) that marks

55

a subset of cells with H2B-GFP, while tissue wide rtTA expression is driven in all cells (Fig.1a,

56

upper panel). To achieve stochastic tumorigenesis, bi-transgenic (B) organoids were

57

transduced with the inducer-reporter virus (pLv-pGK-rtTA-p2A-H2B-GFP) that expresses

58

rtTA and reporter H2B-GFP in only these single cells within the normal epithelium (Fig.1a,

59

lower panel). Then, doxycycline was supplemented in the media to induce tumorigenic

60

growth in rtTA expressing cells. Immunofluorescent staining of 3D matrigel cultures, for both

61

sets of doxycycline-induced transduced organoids, was used to validate transgene specific

62

protein expression of the c-MYC oncogene in only the transduced cells of B organoids as

63

opposed to all cells of T organoids (Fig.1b). qPCR analysis of Myc and Neu mRNA expression

64

was performed to normalize doxycycline dosage in both systems (Supplementary Fig.1).

65

Next, we bred the nuclear reporter H2B-mCherry into the T and B mice to mark all the cells

66

in the organoids for inverted light-sheet microscopy (Luxendo InVi SPIM, Supplementary

67

Fig.2). The InVI SPIM was adjusted for non-phototoxic, long-term imaging (up to 4 days,

68

every 10 minutes with 1 µm z-spacing). The T/H2B-mCherry organoids transduced with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/617837; this version posted April 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

69

reporter virus proliferated swiftly upon doxycycline addition showing expansion of both the

70

marked and unmarked cells (Fig.1c); a sturdy tumor phenotype developed, manifested by

71

multi-cell-layered rims and pronounced proliferation-associated-apoptosis in all organoids

72

(Supplementary movie 1). In contrast, B/H2B-mCherry organoids transduced with inducer-

73

reporter virus, displayed phenotypic variation upon induction of oncogenes in the transduced

74

cells. Some organoids showed fast clonal expansion of oncogene-expressing cells that form

75

multilayer clusters in the organoid rim. This proliferative phenotype seems to stem from

76

several transduced cells in vicinity to each other at the start of time lapse imaging (Fig.1d,

77

upper panel; Supplementary movie 2). Other, more sparsely infected organoids, did not

78

sustain proliferation of the oncogene-expressing cells (Fig.1d, lower panel; Supplementary

79

movie 3). Immunofluorescent staining 3D matrigel cultures for both sets of doxycycline-

80

induced transduced organoids was performed to exclude imaging artefacts; consistent with

81

the light-sheet movies, 3D gels grown in the incubator showed a similar dual phenotype for

82

B organoids while T organoids consistently formed tumors upon oncogene induction

83

(Supplementary Fig.3).

84

To analyze the dual-color light-sheet movies (H2B-mCherry—all cells in the organoid, H2B-

85

GFP—transduced cells within the organoid) on a single cell level, we developed a big data

86

compatible image analysis pipeline, using Fiji14 (plugins Big Data Processor15and CATS16) and

87

Imaris17, for efficient visualization of longitudinal image data, cell segmentation and tracking

88

in 3D (Fig.2a, Supplementary Fig.4 and Fig.5). Cell tracking allowed us to follow the clonal

89

evolution for each transduced cell in the organoid over 3 days. Single transduced cells within

90

one organoid show a difference in proliferation and cell fate as indicated in representative

91

tracks (Fig.2b).

92

To better understand the parameters that positively affect a transduced cell in the stochastic

93

tumorigenesis model to start proliferating and establishing a tumor within a normal

94

epithelium, we extracted 9 features of the organoids (n=20) and all the transduced cells in

95

these organoids (n=150) at the start of the imaging (Fig.2c, left panel). Following observations

96

that tumors originate from groups of independently transduced oncogene expressing cells,

97

we defined clusters of cells in the stochastic model that contain both oncogene-expressing

98

cells as well as normal cells of the organoid and thereby can be used to ascertain the effect

99

of the immediate microenvironment on tumor cell proliferation. Since all the oncogene

100

expressing cells could be tracked over time, each cluster was associated with either a tumor

101

outcome, or a failure to do so. To identify which features were linked to this outcome, we

102

fitted a logistic regression model that shows that only one feature, the “number of transduced

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/617837; this version posted April 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

103

cells in the cluster”, positively drives tumor formation within an organoid. Each additional

104

transduced cell in a cluster increases the odds of this cluster forming a tumor by 9 (Fig.2c,

105

lower right panel). This is further demonstrated by representative organoids shown in Fig.2d

106

where the cells that are likely to proliferate, cluster together at the start of the time lapse

107

imaging and the non-proliferative cells are more sparsely located within the organoid, as

108

verified by the hierarchical cluster analysis.

109

Our results indicate that a proximity-controlled interaction or signaling network between

110

different transformed cells might be imperative to tumor outgrowth in a normal epithelium.

111

This might be due to the repressive effect that an intact polarized tissue layer exerts on single

112

early stage cancerous cells18 or rooted in paracrine effects (e.g.via microRNAs19). Indeed,

113

studies on loss of important polarity proteins have highlighted their function as non-canonical

114

tumor suppressors in breast tumorigenesis20, 21, however, other reports22, 23 cannot confirm

115

these observations which were all obtained from tissue wide transformed model systems.

116

Clearly, to better interrogate deficiencies in cell-cell interactions and to settle such conflicting

117

reports, there is a need for a more detailed analysis, employing a model system that does

118

not show modification of all cells in the tissue.

119

The interaction of tumor cells with the immediate microenvironment has been subject of

120

extensive studies with regards to immune cells24 and other tumor associated celltypes4,

121

however, the interaction with the normal neighboring cells has not been explored in real time

122

using an organotypic model system. Here, we have developed an integrated approach that

123

allows us to follow cell fates in the first stochastic breast tumor model of primary cells. The

124

amenability of this system to interference with small molecule inhibitors, viral shRNA vectors

125

and genomic editing has the potential to further our understanding of the mechanisms

126

important during tumor initiation. The ability to distinguish marked tumor cells from the

127

normal epithelium will now allow us to perform single cell RNA sequencing analysis on select

128

sorted cells. This will help delineate the signaling networks within the immediate tumor

129

microenvironment.

130

Taken together, we strongly believe that our integration of a true stochastic tumor model with

131

the ability to image single-cell fates will successfully bridge the gap between genetically

132

modified model systems and the clinical situation, helping gain novel insights on breast

133

cancer.

Figure 1. Characterization and imaging of stochastic tumorigenesis in mammary
organoids
(a) Schematic representation of the mouse models and the in vitro culture methods used.
Organoids are grown from single cells harvested from the mammary glands of either bitrangenic (B) or tri-trangenic (T) mice, transduced with lentiviral particles in solution and reseeded into 3D cultures. Doxycycline is added to the media to induce the expression of
oncogenes in cells expressing rtTA. B mice have the c-MYC and Neu oncogene constructs
in their genome. These oncogenes are activated in single cells infected with the Inducerreporter (pLenti-rtTA-GFP) lentiviral particles, in the presence of doxycycline — modelling
stochastic breast tumorigenesis (bottom panel). T mice have the rtTA transducer construct
along with the oncogenes and all cells in T organoids can be induced to express oncogenes
in 3D culture in the presence of doxycycline. T mice infected with Reporter (pLenti-NULLGFP) lentiviral particles are used as infection controls (top panel). Both viral particles mark
single cells in the organoids with H2B-GFP.
(b) Representative immunoflourescence staining images of fixed 3D gels with B organoids
transduced with Inducer-reporter virus or T organoids transduced with Reporter virus before
induction (top), 24 hours post induction and (middle) and 72 hours post induction (bottom)
with doxycycline. GFP expressing transduced cells (green), c-MYC oncogene (magenta),

Figure 2. Proximity of transformed cells in a normal epithelium enhances tumor
proliferation and establishment.
(a) Schematic representation of the big-image data analysis pipeline developed to analyze
the light sheet microscopy images. Images are acquired in two channels (H2B-mCherry in
magenta and H2B-GFP in green) at 10-minute intervals for 3-4 days. Big Data Processor Fiji
plugin is used to pre-process the raw images and CATS Fiji plugin is used for generation of
pixel probability maps (Supplementary Fig.4). Image pixels of the H2B-GFP images are
classified into background (black), nucleus centre (green), nucleus boundary (blue) classes
by manual training. Processed raw images along with the probability maps from the nucleus
center channel (green) are exported to Imaris for 3D visualization, nuclear segmentation and
single cell tracking.
(b) Single cell tracking results for every cell in a representative B organoid transduced with
the Inducer-reporter virus. Top panel shows the organoid at the beginning of the time-lapse
(24 hours post induction) with each transduced cell surface rendered with Imaris. The middle
panel shows the lineage trees of each individual cell over the time lapse recording. Lineage
trees of single cells are grouped into proliferative (highlighted in red, orange) and nonproliferative (highlighted in blue) cell clusters. The bottom panel shows the organoid at the
end of the time-lapse (~76 hours post induction with doxycycline). Color coding of each cell
maintained in all panels. Scale bar, 15 µm.
(c) Schematic representation of the 9 features of stochastically transformed cells extracted
at the beginning of time lapse imaging. These features were assessed for their impact on
tumor cell proliferation within B organoids transduced with the Inducer-reporter virus using
logistic regression. Lower right panel: Coefficients (represented as odds ratios) of the three
features included in the best logistic regression model, colored horizontal bars represent the
95% confidence interval of the estimate. ** indicates p-value (of having no effect) < 0.01, *
indicates p-value <0.05. The vertical grey line indicates the position of no effect.
(d) Representative B mammary organoids stochastically transduced with the Inducerreporter virus and induced with doxycycline. Left panels show organoids 24 hours post
induction. Color highlights indicate clusters of transduced cells identified from hierarchical
clustering (shown in middle panels) with proliferative clusters highlighted in orange and nonproliferative clusters highlighted in blue. Right panels show the same organoids ~72-76
hours post induction. Scale bar, 20 µm.

The mouse strains TetO-MYC/ MMTV-rtTA1 and TetO-Neu/ MMTV-rtTA2, that have been
previously described, were bred in order to establish the tri-transgenic strain TetO-MYC/TetONeu/ MMTV-rtTA (T) or bi-transgenic strain TetO-MYC/TetO-Neu (B). Reporter H2B-mCherry
was crossed into the B and T lines using a R26-H2B-mCherry line {Abe, 2011 #1294} 3(RIKEN,
CDB0239K). All ten mammary glands were harvested (from virgin female mice between 8-10
weeks old), digested and singularized for establishing organoid cultures. All mice used in this
study were housed according to the guidelines of the Federation of European Laboratory
Animal Science Associations (FELASA).
Rational for the use of these oncogenes: Her2 is overexpressed in ~20% of breast cancers4,
MYC in 15-50% of human breast cancer5 . The combination of Myc and Her2 is found in highly
aggressive human breast cancer6:and - in fact- Her2 and MYC strongly accelerate tumour
onset In the combined transgenic animals (average 45 days) as compared to single transgenic
animals (MYC 155 days, Her2 99 days), In all cases tumors regress rapidly to non-palpable
state following oncogene silencing.

The lentivirus design is based on pWPXL backbone, which was a gift from Didier Trono
(Addgene #12257). The coding region from the original plasmid was excised using ClaI and
NdeI in order to insert a new multiple cloning site (MCS). The pGK promoter was PCR
amplified from pLVPT-GDNF-rtTR-KRAB-2SM2, which was a gift from Patrick Aebischer &
Didier Trono (Addgene #11647) and cloned using XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. For the
plasmid pLenti-rtTA-GFP the synthetic region rtTA-p2A-H2B-GFP was cloned downstream of
the pGK promoter using EcoRI and NheI sites. The plasmid pLenti-Null-GFP is derived from
the pLenti-rtTA-GFP by removing the rtTA sequence, using the restriction sites EcoRI and
BamHI, and retaining H2B-GFP in the coding region. For production of lentivirus particles, we
seeded 1.6 x 107 HEK-293T cells (Lenti-X - Clontech Cat. # 632180) in 500cm2 square dishes
(Corning Cat. # 431110). After 24 hours, the cells were supplemented with media containing
25uM of chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. # C6628). After a 5-hour incubation,
using 360 µg of polyethyleneimine (4 µg for each µg of plasmid), we transfect the cells with a
mixture of endotoxin free plasmids: 20 µg pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene #8454); 30 µg psPAX2
(Addgene #12260); 40 µg transfer plasmids pLenti-rtTA-GFP or pLenti-Null-GFP. We
harvested the media after 48 hours, 72 hours and 96 hours after transfection. Concentration
of the lentivirus from the collected media was performed using an ultracentrifuge (Beckman
Sw32 rotor) at 25,000 rpm for 2h at 4oC. The lentivirus pellet was resuspended in 1000 µl of
HBBS buffer, aliquoted and stored at -80oC. The lentivirus titer was measured using FACS
analyses as described by Kutner and colleagues7.

Mammary glands harvested from mice (see above), were digested in order to prepare a single
cell solution. For this, the tissue was divided in four loosely capped 50 ml falcon, each
supplemented with 5 ml serum-free media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 25mM HEPES and
1% Pen Strep(100 U/ml Penicillin; 100 µg/ml Streptomycin; ThermoFisher Cat. # 15140122))
and 750 U of Collagenase Type 3(Worthington Biochemical Corp Cat. # LS004183), 20 µg of
Liberase (Roche Cat. # 5401020001) and incubated overnight at 37oC and 5%CO2. The
glands were then mechanically disrupted using a 5 ml pipette, and washed in PBS before
being pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA and incubated for 45 minutes at 37oC and 5%CO2. The enzymatic reaction was
then neutralized using 40 ml of serum supplemented media (DMEM/F12 with 25mM HEPES,
1% Pen Strep and 10% FBS Tetracycline Free certified (Biowest Cat. # S181T). The cells

were pelleted again, resuspended in Mammary Epithelial Cell Basal Medium (PromoCell Cat.
# C-21210) and seeded in collagen coated plates (Corning Cat. # 354400) overnight at 37oC
and 5%CO2. This allows for epithelial cells to adhere to the surface of the plates while the
other cell types float on top in the media and can be easily removed by vacuum suction. The
epithelial cells were detached from the collagen coated plates by incubating them with 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA for 5-7 minutes at 37oC and 5%CO2, following inactivation with serum
supplemented media. The single cell solution was pelleted, resuspended in MEBM and
counted. We mixed 50,000 cells with 90 µl of Matrigel Matrix basement Membrane growth
factor reduced phenol red free (Corning Cat. # 356231), and seeded this mixture into a 12 well
plate (Corning Cat. # 3336) and incubated it for 30-40 minutes until the matrigel solidified. The
gels were supplemented with 1.5 ml MEBM and allowed to grow at 37°C and 5%CO2.
For transduction, after 3 days of growth, the gels were mechanically disrupted and placed in
a 15 ml falcon. Two disrupted gels were placed in one 15 ml falcon with 2ml of MEBM
supplemented with 25U of Collagenase type I and 5 µg of Liberase. Following incubation in
this solution for 2 hours at 37°C and 5%CO2, when the matrigel was totally digested, the
organoids were washed 3 times with 15 ml of serum supplemented media and once with 15
ml of serum free media, and pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. We then supplemented the
organoid pellet (from two original gels) in 10 µl of MEBM and added 6 x 105 lentivirus particles
to the solution. We then mixed this solution with 90 µl matrigel and plated it in 35 mm dishes
(Greiner Bio-One Cat. # 627160) and placed in incubator for 30-40 minutes until the matrigel
solidified. The gels were supplemented with 3 ml MEBM and incubated for 2 days at 37°C and
5%CO2 in order to allow for organoid recovery and lentiviral gene expression.

For induction of oncogenes in the cells of the organoids, doxycycline (Sigma Cat. # D9891)
was supplemented in the media. 800 ng/ml of doxycycline was used to induce T organoids
and 600 ng/ml was used for B organoids. qPCR analysis was used to standardize the
doxycycline dosage for B organoids (see below).

The qPCR technique was performed following the MIQE guidelines, where the total RNA was
isolated from the mammary gland organoids using RNA PureLink Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Cat.
# 12183018A) and 2.5ug was reverse transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript VILO cDNA
Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Cat. # 11754050). Using Primer3 software we designed specific
primers for DNA intercalating fluorescent dye approach for the transgenes Neu (Forward:

were used. Primer efficiency was verified and established between 95% and 105% Each
sample was analyzed in duplicate and non-template controls were used in each qPCR run.
Analyses were carried out using a StepOne device (Applied Biosystems, USA). Analysis of
relative gene expression data was performed according to the 2−ΔΔCq method and the

Imaging was performed on the InVi SPIM inverted light-sheet microscope (Luxendo LightSheet, Bruker Corporation). Sample mounting for the InVi SPIM is suitable for 3D matrigel
cultures that are used to grow and transduce mammary organoids (see above). The sample
holder is made of medical grade plastic (PEEK). A 25 μm thin membrane (FEP; Luxendo) with
a refractive index matching that of water is glued to the upper surface of a groove in the sample
holder with a biocompatible silicone glue (Silpuran 4200; Wacker), forming a trough with
transparent bottom (Supplementary Fig. 2). Matrigel cultures were carefully cut with a scalpel
into rectangular slivers and transferred onto the FEP membrane’s trough. Once the gel sliver
was aligned in place, 20-30 µl of fresh matrigel drops were poured onto the gel sliver in the
sample holder until there was a thin layer of liquid matrigel on top of the gel sliver. The setup
was incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator to allow the matrigel layer on top
to solidify. Once the gel was solidified, 600-800 µl of MEBM supplemented with/without
doxycycline was added to the sample holder’s FEP sheet trough. Preferably, freshly mounted
sample gels were allowed to settle overnight in the incubator to prevent any gel drift during
imaging, when the holder is placed into the imaging chamber of the microscope. The imaging
chamber acts as an incubator with environmental control and it has a reservoir for immersion
medium, which is filled with water so that both objective lenses and the bottom of the sample
holder are below the water surface (Supplementary Figure 2).

The InVi SPIM is equipped with a Nikon CFI 10x/0.3NA water immersion lens for illumination
and a Nikon CFI-75 25x/1.1NA water immersion lens for detection. For excitation of GFP and
mCherry, 488 nm and 594 nm laser lines were used, respectively, while emission was selected
using a 497-554 nm band pass filter and a 610 nm long pass filter, respectively. 3D image
stacks were acquired with a light-sheet thickness of 4 µm, a final magnification of 62.5x,
resulting in 104 nm pixel size. The In-Vi SPIM environmental control was set to 37 °C, 5% CO2
and 95% humidity. A series of optimization experiments, involving different laser powers,
exposure times and z-step sizes yielded laser powers of 13 µW for 488 nm and 36 µW for
594 nm, 100 millisecond exposure time per frame and 1µm z-spacing between frames to be
optimal for long term imaging (96-120 hours) without photo-bleaching or photo-toxic effects
on growth.

Images were recorded as 2D planes ranging from 100-500 in number, depending on the
organoid size. Each 3D stack of planes was recorded in 2 channels - mCherry (all cells) and
GFP (transduced cells). Depending on the duration of the time lapse imaging, 450-600 image
stacks (equivalent to ~72-96 hours) were recorded per organoid at 10-minute intervals.

The oncogenic cells (H2B-GFP channel) displayed heterogeneous morphologies as well as
varying intensity textures, making it difficult to segment them using conventional thresholding
approaches. We thus used a trainable segmentation approach to convert the raw intensity
values into pixel probability maps, using the Fiji plugin CATS9 (Context Aware Trainable
Segmentation) . Using the H2B-GFP channel images as input, we trained three pixel
classes: background, nucleus center and nucleus boundary. For training we drew about
20(background), 120(nucleus center), 100(nucleus boundary) labels distributed across the
different time-frames of the movie. After feature computation and training of a Random
Forest classifier the whole dataset was processed on EMBL’s high performance computer
cluster. The segmentation of one data set -typically 100 timepoints- is distributed across few
hundred jobs, each job using 32 GB RAM, 16 cores, and running for about 30 minutes. The
nucleus center probability maps were then exported from CATS and added as an additional
channel to the converted intensity data (Supplementary Fig. 4).
The data were then loaded into Imaris10 for 3D visualization and further processing. Using the
Imaris’ Surfaces function, we segmented the nucleus center probability maps into objects. To
do so, probability maps were manually thresholded, using a surface smoothening parameter
of 0.3 µm; the minimum quality parameter for seed points was set to 0.1, and object splitting
was applied for objects larger than 5.5 µm. Objects with volumes less than 20 µm3 were
excluded. Next, all objects were tracked over time using Imaris’ Lineage tracking algorithm
with a maximum distance between objects in subsequent time-points limited to 10 µm and a
maximum gap size between identification of the object in a particular track limited to 10 time
points. Analysis of segmentation results is shown in Supplementary Figure 5. Most of the
errors in the object segmentation were false merges, where two cells were segmented as one.
This kind of error is frequently not sustained in the previous or following time-points and the
maximum gap size parameter of the tracking algorithm thus frequently provides correct tracks
nonetheless. The resulting lineage trees of proliferating tumour cells within the organoid were
corrected manually within Imaris, e.g., excluding apoptotic cells and auto-fluorescent debris.
Center of mass coordinates of each cell were measured and exported from Imaris for
subsequent feature analysis (Figure 2c).

Observations suggest that tumors in organoids originate from clusters of oncogeneexpressing cells produced by independent transduction events. To identify these clusters, we
computed the pairwise Euclidean distances between all oncogene-expressing cells in an
organoid at the start of the experiment and applied hierarchical clustering with complete
linkage. Clusters were identified automatically by cutting the branches of the trees using the
dynamic tree cut algorithm11. This defined a cluster as a group of oncogene-expressing cells
that are closer to each other than to other oncogene-expressing cells of the same organoid.
Note that a cluster can be composed of a single cell if this cell is comparatively isolated from
other transduced cells. For each cluster we identified the following features as possibly linked
to tumor formation: (1) number of cells in the organoid (2) cell density expressed as the ratio
of number of cells to organoid surface area computed by assuming the organoid is a sphere
with diameter equal to the distance between the two most distant cells (3) number of
oncogene-expressing cells in the organoid (4) number of cells (including both oncogeneexpressing and normal cells) in the cluster volume defined as the sphere centered at the
center of mass of the cluster with diameter equal to the distance between the two farthest
oncogene-expressing cells of the cluster (5) number of oncogene-expressing cells in the
cluster (6) average pairwise distance between all cells in the cluster volume (7) average
pairwise distance between oncogene-expressing cells in the cluster (8) fraction of oncogene-

Oncogene-expressing cells were tracked over time and a cluster was associated with a tumor
outcome if any of its cells lead to tumor formation. To identify which features were linked to
this outcome, we took an information-theoretic approach to model selection. We fitted a
logistic regression model for all possible linear combinations of features and selected the best
model based on the Akaike information criterion (with correction for small sample sizes)12 (Ref
9). This model included only three features: number of oncogene-expressing cells in the
cluster, number of oncogene-expressing cells in the organoid and number of cells in the cluster
of which only the first (number of oncogene-expressing cells in the cluster) contributed
significantly to tumor formation with an odds ratio of 9.1 (Figure 2c). Computing relative
variable importance across all models also indicated that the number of oncogene-expressing
cells in a cluster is the most important feature.
