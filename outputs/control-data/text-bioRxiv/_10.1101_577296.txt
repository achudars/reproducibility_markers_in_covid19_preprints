Abstract

22

Necrotrophic plant pathogens acquire nutrients from dead plant cells, which requires the

23

disintegration of the plant cell wall and tissue structures by the pathogen. Infected plants

24

lose tissue integrity and functional immunity as a result, exposing the nutrient rich,

25

decayed tissues to the environment. One challenge for the necrotrophs to successfully

26

cause secondary infection (infection spread from an initially infected plant to the nearby

27

uninfected plants) is to effectively utilize nutrients released from hosts towards building

28

up a large population before other saprophytes come. In this study, we observed that the

29

necrotrophic pathogen Dickeya dadantii exhibited heterogeneity in bacterial cell length in

30

an isogenic population during infection of potato tuber. While some cells were regular

31

rod-shape (<10μm), the rest elongated into filamentous cells (>10μm). Short cells tended

32

to occur at the interface of healthy and diseased tissues, during the early stage of infection

33

when active attacking and killing is occurring, while filamentous cells tended to form at a

34

later stage of infection. Short cells expressed all necessary virulence factors and motility,

35

whereas filamentous cells did not engage in virulence, were non-mobile and more

36

sensitive to environmental stress. However, compared to the short cells, the filamentous

37

cells displayed upregulated metabolic genes and increased growth, which may benefit the

38

pathogens to build up a large population necessary for the secondary infection. The

39

segregation of the two subpopulations was dependent on differential expression of the

40

alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). When exposed to fresh tuber tissues or

41

freestanding water, filamentous cells quickly transformed to short virulent cells. The

42

pathogen adaptation of cell length heterogeneity identified in this study presents a model

for how some necrotrophs balance virulence and vegetative growth to maximize fitness

Author Summary

46

Virulence and vegetative growth are two distinct lifestyles in pathogenic bacteria.

47

Although virulence factors are critical for pathogens to successfully cause infections,

48

producing these factors is costly and imposes growth penalty to the pathogen. Although

49

each single bacterial cell exists in one lifestyle or the other at any moment, we

50

demonstrated in this study that a bacterial population could accomplish the two functions

51

simultaneously by maintaining subpopulations of cells in each of the two lifestyles.

52

During the invasion of potato tuber, the soft rot pathogen Dickeya dadantii formed two

53

distinct subpopulations characterized by their cell morphology. The population consisting

54

of short cells actively produced virulence factors to break down host tissues, whereas the

55

other population, consisting of filamentous cells, was only engaged in vegetative growth

56

and was non-virulent. We hypothesize that his phenotypic heterogeneity allows D.

57

dadantii to break down plant tissues and release nutrients, while efficiently utilizing

58

nutrients needed to build up a large pathogen population at the same time. Our study

59

provides insights into how phenotypic heterogeneity could grant bacteria abilities to

60

“multi-task” distinct functions as a population.

Introduction

62

Based on the modes of nutrition acquisition, plant pathogens can be categorized into

63

biotrophs, necrotrophs, and hemibiotrophs [1, 2]. Obligate biotrophs acquire nutrients

64

from living plant cells, and thus have to maintain host viability. Consequently, biotrophs

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577296; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

65

generally do not produce lytic enzymes and toxins, but rely on sophisticated immune

66

suppression systems to escape host surveillance. Obligate necrotrophs, in contrast, feed

67

on nutrients released from dead or dying cells, and thus have to actively kill host cells

68

and break down host tissues through the production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes

69

(PCWDEs) and toxins. Many pathogens display both biotrophic and necrotrophic phases

70

of nutrient acquisition and are categorized as hemibiotrophs.

71

Dickeya dadantii, the causal agent of bacterial soft rot disease, is a typical necrotroph.

72

Infections caused by D. dadanntii mostly occur on nutrient-rich plant organs, such as

73

tubers, rhizomes, bulbs, and succulent stems and leaves [3]. During infection, D. dadantii

74

secretes a series of PCWDEs, mainly pectate lyases, to disintegrate the plant cell walls.

75

The type III secretion system (T3SS), a secretion apparatus that injects protein effectors

76

into the host cell, is another necessary virulence factor to elicit cell death in D. dadantii

77

[4, 5]. Pathogens consume the nutrients released from dead plant cells, and spread to

78

adjoining tubers to incite secondary infections as liquid from the rotting tubers percolates

79

onto others [6].

80

Under favorable conditions, complete decay of a potato tuber or storage roots can occur

81

within two to three days [3]. One practical challenge for D. dadantii and many other

82

obligate necrotrophs is how to efficiently consume the large amount of nutrients released

83

from the nutrient-rich organs and use them towards building up the pathogen populations

84

for secondary infection [2, 6]. Efficient nutrient consumption and energy conversion

85

seem to be more important for necrotrophs than for biotrophs and hemibiotrophs, as

86

breaking down of the host epidermis and tissue structures results in the immediate release

87

of nutrients that are available to essentially any microbes in the surrounding environment.

88

Vegetative growth and virulence expression are two distinct physiological states for

89

bacterial pathogens [7, 8]. Virulence is induced under nutrient limited or stress

90

conditions, whereas vegetative growth occurs under nutrient rich, growth favorable

91

conditions [9, 10]. For example, genes encoding the T3SS are induced when bacteria are

92

cultured under a nutrient limited hrp-inducing minimal medium condition but were

93

repressed in nutrient rich media such as Lysogeny Broth [9]. In addition to their different

94

environmental cues, a clear tradeoff has also been observed between virulence and

95

growth in bacteria, as the production of virulence factors compromised the rate of

96

metabolic processes associated with growth [7, 11]. Pathogens have developed complex

97

regulatory systems to sense environmental signals and shift between the two lifestyles

98

upon environmental changes [12]. However, the co-occurrence of both lifestyles in a

99

homogeneous population has not been clearly documented and well understood.

100

Many bacterial pathogens have been observed to exhibit variable phenotypes in an

101

isogenic population in the host. Heterogeneity is defined as a diversity of phenotypes

102

displayed by isogenic bacteria in similar environments that allow new functionality.

103

Phenotypic heterogeneity increases the flexibility and versatility of bacteria as a

104

population. Phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in many bacteria in various

105

functions such as antibiotic persistence [13], virulence [10, 14-16], motility [17], and

106

sporulation [18, 19].

107

In this study, we report that the soft rot pathogen D. dadantii displays heterogeneity in

108

cell length during infection on potato tubers. Within a clonal population, a subpopulation

109

of D. dadantii cells formed elongated filamentous cells while the rest of the cells

110

remained short. We show that the proportion of filamentous cells and short cells was

111

affected by infection organs, environmental conditions, stages of infection, and presence

112

of freestanding water. We further demonstrated that filamentous cells and short cells have

113

distinct properties: while short cells were virulent, motile, and relatively tolerant to stress,

114

the filamentous cells were non-virulent, non-motile, and highly sensitive to stress.

115

However, filamentous cells display upregulated metabolic genes and increased growth

116

compared to the short cells. When environmental conditions change, filamentous cells

117

began reverting to short cells. D. dadantii differentiation into heterogeneous cell types

118

was dependent on the differential expression of the alarmone ppGpp. These findings

119

provide insight into the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in the overall fitness of a

120

bacterial population during host-pathogen interactions.

121

Results

122

D. dadantii differentiates into filamentous cells and short cells during the infection of

123

potato tuber.

124

In our preliminary study of gene expression in single cells of D. dadantii, we noticed that

125

some D. dadantii cells presented an elongated cell morphology when inoculated on

126

potato tubers. To determine if D. dadantii displayed heterogeneity in cell morphology

127

during the infection of potato tuber, tubers inoculated with a clonal culture of wild type D.

128

dadantii strain 3937 were examined under scanning electron microscopy. A

129

heterogeneity in cell length was indeed observed within the isogenic population of D.

130

dadantii: while some cells were rod-shaped with length between 1 to 10 µm, other cells

131

were highly elongated to lengths greater than 10 µm (Fig 1). The filamentous cells were

132

plated and re-identified to rule out contamination of other non-Dickeya species.

133

Hereafter, we define cells shorter than 10 µm as short cells, and cells longer than 10 µm

134

as filamentous cells.

135

D. dadantii cell filamentation is affected by plant organ, bacterial position in the

136

infection site, time since inoculation, and presence of freestanding water.

137

Next we determined whether the formation of filamentous cells observed in potato tubers

138

also occurs in other organ types (leaves and stems). To visualize bacterial cells in vivo,

139

we introduced a green fluorescence protein (gfp) reporter constitutively expressed under

140

the control of an nptII promoter, into the wild type D. dadantii. We confirmed that

141

expression of gfp did not affect cell length (S1 Fig). No obvious cell length

142

differentiation was observed in either nutrient-limited organs such as leaves or stems

143

inoculated with D. dadantii at 24 and 48 hrs post inoculation (hpi), as observed in the

144

nutrient rich organ potato tubers (Fig 2A).

145

We next determined whether the filamentous cell formation could be affected by bacterial

146

position on a potato tuber. Cell lengths of D. dadantii at the surface edge of infection, at

147

the surface center of infection, and at the internal edge of infection of infected potatoes

148

(P1, P2, and P3 respectively, as indicated in Fig 2B) were quantified at 48 hpi. A

149

significantly higher ratio of filamentous to short cells was observed at the surface center

150

position (P2, 1:1.33), where disease was well established, compared to that observed at

151

the interfaces of healthy and diseased tissues (P1 and P3, 1:399 and 1:37.5) (Fig 2B).

152

Echoing this observation, we also observed a steady increase in the proportion of

153

filamentous cells from an early time point after inoculation (0% of the total population at

154

6 hpi) to a later time point (42.9% at 48 hpi; Fig 3, right panel). Finally, we observed that

155

the formation of filamentous cells was repressed by the presence of freestanding water on

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577296; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

156

top of the inoculated tubers, with only 3.0% of total cells filamented at 48 hpi, compared

157

with the aforementioned 42.9% of cells filamented without the presence of water (Fig 3).

158

Taken together, these results demonstrate that D. dadantii forms filamentous cells on

159

potato tubers, at later stages of infection, and at well-established infection positions on

160

the surface (P2). In contrast, the formation of filamentous cells was repressed on leafy

161

tissues, at early infection timepoints, at disease interfaces (P1 and P3), and on water-

162

covered tissues.

163

D. dadantii cell filamentation is associated with an absence of virulence gene

164

expression.

165

The observation that most filamentous cells were formed only after infection became

166

well-established i.e., after host cell lysis was underway, suggested that this subpopulation

167

may not need virulence capabilities. We first determined the level of expression of genes

168

encoding the T3SS, a critical virulence factor in D. dadantii. We introduced a dual

169

fluorescence promoter reporter PnptII-gfp-PhrpN-mCherry into the wild type D. dadantii

170

and inoculated it onto potato tuber. The reporter contains two promoter-fluorescence gene

171

fusions, PnptII-gfp and PhrpN-mCherry, which enables visualization of the total

172

population of D. dadantii (both filamentous cells and short cells) in green fluorescence,

173

while monitoring the expression of hrpN in red fluorescence in these two subpopulations.

174

At 48 hpi, a clear differentiation of filamentous cells and short cells was observed at

175

surface center position P2 in the absence of freestanding water (Fig 4A, left panel).

176

Interestingly, a strong negative correlation was observed between cell length and the

177

expression of hrpN at the P2 position (Fig 4A, correlation co-efficiency R2=0.9789). A

178

total of 88.2% of the hrpN-expressing cells had a cell length of less than 10 µm and 11.8%

9
179

of the hrpN expressing cells had a cell length between 10 µm and 20 µm. No hrpN

180

expression was detected in cells with lengths greater than 20 µm (Fig 4A indicated by

181

arrows, and 4B). At the P1 position, only short cells were observed, and 41.7% of them

182

expressed hrpN (Fig 4A and 4B). The expression of a non-T3SS gene, rsmB, was evenly

183

expressed in both filamentous and short cells (Fig 4A).

184

As we determined that the T3SS genes were not expressed in the filamentous cells, and

185

the proportion of filamentous cells increased as the infection progressed from early to

186

later stage at P2 position (Fig 3 without freestanding water), next, we determined whether

187

the increase of the filamentous cell subpopulation would result in an overall reduction of

188

the T3SS expression at P2 position. As shown in Fig 4C, filamentous cell subpopulation

189

increased from 4.0% at 18 hpi to 18.6% at 48 hpi at P2 position. At the same time, a

190

decrease in T3SS expression was also indeed observed (from 33.0% of total cells at 18

191

hpi to 6.8% of the total cells at 48 hpi, Fig 4C). No increase in filamentous cell

192

proportion nor decrease of the T3SS expressing cells in the total population was observed

193

at the disease interface P1 (Fig 4B).

194

To further confirm the differential expression of T3SS genes in filamentous cells and

195

short cells, we developed a sucrose-gradient centrifugation method to separate enriched

196

pools of filamentous cells and short cells from position P2 of the infected potato tubers

197

(S2 Fig). Expression of two T3SS marker genes, hrpN and hrpA, was analyzed in the two

198

subpopulations. As shown in Fig 5A, greater than 75% reduction of the expression of

199

both genes was observed in filamentous cells compared to short cells, further supporting

200

the hypothesis that filamentous cells express T3SS genes at a reduced level. We next

201

compared the mRNA levels of another virulence factor, the pectate lyase gene pelD, in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577296; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

10
202

the two subpopulations. Compared to the short cells, the mRNA of pelD is more than five

203

fold reduced in the filamentous cells. No significant difference in the expression of gyrA,

204

a gene encoding DNA gyrase, was detected between the two subpopulations (Fig 5A).

205

Together, our results suggest that filamentous cells, mostly formed when disease is well-

206

established, may not participate in virulence and host invasion.

207

Alarmone ppGpp biosynthesis genes relA and spoT are differentially expressed in

208

filamentous cells and short cells of D. dadantii.

209

Previous studies have suggested a role of alarmone ppGpp in determining bacterial cell

210

length; mutation of ppGpp biosynthesis genes resulted in elongated cell morphology in

211

Erwinia and Pseudomonas plant pathogens [20, 21]. However, it is unclear whether the

212

formation of naturally occurring filamentous cells could be caused by the differential

213

expression of the ppGpp biosynthesis genes. To determine the role of ppGpp in

214

filamentous cell formation in D. dadantii, we measured the mRNA levels of two putative

215

ppGpp biosynthesis genes, relA and spoT, in the separated short cells and enriched

216

filamentous cells collected from infected potato tubers. Expression of both genes was

217

significantly reduced in the filamentous cells compared to the short cells (Fig 5A). To

218

validate this differential expression, a Western blot was performed to quantify the RelA

219

and SpoT proteins in the two subpopulations. Similar to the qRT-PCR results, higher

220

levels of RelA and SpoT proteins were detected in the short cells compared to that in the

221

filamentous cells (Fig 5B). The above results conclude that the two putative ppGpp

222

biosynthesis genes are differentially expressed in filamentous cells and short cells of D.

dadantii.

224

Double deletion of relA and spoT abolishes intracellular ppGpp levels and induces

225

cell elongation in D. dadantii.

226

The reduction in relA and spoT expression in filamentous cells led us to hypothesize that

227

relA and spoT-mediated ppGpp production is essential for D. dadantii filamentation on

228

potato tubers. First, we confirmed whether relA and spoT are required for ppGpp

229

biosynthesis and degradation in D. dadantii as in other bacteria. Deletion mutants of relA

230

and spoT were generated and intracellular ppGpp levels were measured. Compared to the

231

wild type, decreased and increased ppGpp levels were observed in ΔrelA and ΔspoT

232

respectively, and could be restored through complementation (Table 1). In the

233

ΔrelAΔspoT double mutant, drastic reduction of ppGpp levels were observed (Table 1).

234

These observations suggest that as in model species of bacteria, D. dadantii RelA is

235

responsible for ppGpp synthesis, while SpoT has a major function of ppGpp hydrolysis as

236

well as a minor function of ppGpp synthesis.

We observed that filamentous cells formed under natural infection conditions exhibited

reduced expression of both relA and spoT. To determine whether these genes are

243

necessary for the filamentous cell formation in D. dadantii, we compared the cell length

244

of wild type, ΔrelAΔspoT, single deletion mutants and complementation strains in culture

245

(LB broth) and on potato tuber. Cell length was significantly increased when both ppGpp

12
246

biosynthesis genes were mutated (ΔrelAΔspoT in Fig 6A). We also observed a strong

247

negative correlation between a strain’s intracellular ppGpp levels (Table 1) and cell

248

length; cell length was increased in deletion mutants with reduced intracellular ppGpp

249

levels (ΔrelA and ΔrelAΔspoT, Fig 6A) and was decreased in a deletion mutant with

250

increased ppGpp level (ΔspoT, Fig 6A). On potato tuber, a similar correlation was also

251

observed (Fig 6B), although the cell length of ΔrelAΔspoT could not be determined, as

252

the double mutant was non-virulent. These observations further confirmed that

253

intracellular ppGpp strongly affects bacterial cell length, and abolishing ppGpp synthesis

254

through double mutation of relA and spoT results in filamentous cell formation similar to

255

that observed in potato tuber.

256

To confirm that ppGpp itself and not another function of RelA or SpoT is a signal for cell

257

elongation, we next tested the effect of adding chemically synthesized ppGpp on

258

filamentous cell formation. We hypothesized that if ppGpp causes elongation and has

259

limited permeability, adding chemically synthesized exogenous ppGpp to D. dadantii

260

would repress filamentous cell formation. To test this hypothesis, ppGpp at two different

261

concentrations was added on top of the potato tubers inoculated with wild-type D.

262

dadantii. A significant reduction in the proportion of filamentous cells was observed

263

upon addition of ppGpp (S3 Fig), which further supported the hypothesis that low ppGpp

264

triggers filamentous cell formation during D. dadantii infection.

265

Filamentous cells induced by ppGpp deficiency do not express virulence factors and

266

do not participate in pathogenicity during host-microbe interactions.

267

Having confirmed that cell length heterogeneity is dependent on the differential

268

expression of ppGpp biosynthesis genes, and that filamentous cells can be artificially

269

induced through deletion of both relA and spoT, we used the double deletion ∆relA∆spoT

270

mutant to uncover putative biological functions of the naturally occurring filamentous

271

cells. Naturally occurring filamentous cells exhibited significantly reduced expression of

272

the T3SS and pectate lyase genes, which indicates that these cells may not participate in

273

pathogenicity during the host-microbe interaction. To test this hypothesis, we compared

274

the bacterial virulence of wild type and ∆relA∆spoT, along with single mutants and

275

complementation strains, on Chinese cabbage (Brassíca campestris) leaves. Compared to

276

the wild type which caused necrotic lesions on Chinese cabbage leaves at 32 hpi,

277

∆relA∆spoT lost its virulence capability (Fig 7A). Reduced and enhanced virulence was

278

also observed in single mutants ΔrelA and ΔspoT, respectively, which further suggests

279

intracellular ppGpp promotes bacterial virulence in D. dadantii.

280

To determine whether the reduction in T3SS and pectate lyase gene expression in the

281

naturally occurring filamentous cells would also result in reduced activities of T3SS and

282

of pectate lyases, we compared the hypersensitive response (HR) and pectate lyase

283

production in wild type D. dadantii and the ∆relA∆spoT double mutant, as well as single

284

mutants and complementation strains. Compared to the wild type, ∆relA∆spoT lost its

285

ability to elicit the HR on tobacco leaves (Fig 7B). Consistent with phenotypic

286

observations, mRNA levels of the T3SS genes hrpA, hrpN, dspE, and hrpL were also

287

significantly reduced in ∆relA∆spoT as observed in naturally occurring filamentous cells

288

(Fig 7B). A significant reduction in pectate lyase production and in expression of pectate

289

lyase-encoding genes pelD and pelE was also observed in ∆relA∆spoT compared with the

290

wild type (Fig 7C). Taken together with the results from Fig 4, these results suggest that

whether environmentally or mutationally induced, filamentous cells of D. dadantii do not

292

produce two essential virulence factors and do not contribute to pathogenicity.

293

Filamentous cells are non-motile.

294

Motility is essential for D. dadantii to spread and cause secondary infections, especially

295

under wet conditions. Our observation that D. dadantii filamentous cell formation only

296

occurred in the absence of freestanding water suggests that filamentous cells may be non-

297

motile. To test this hypothesis, a mixture of filamentous and short cells collected at the

298

P2 position of potato tubers at 48 hpi were resuspended in sterile distilled water and

299

observed under the microscope for their motility (S1 Video). As expected, filamentous

300

cells showed significantly reduced motility (0.723 ± 0.6 microns per second) compared to

301

short cells (5.508 ± 2.621 microns per second). We also compared the swimming and

302

swarming motility of wild type D. dadantii with deletion mutants of the ppGpp

303

biosynthesis genes. A complete abolishment of both swimming and swarming motility

304

was observed in ∆relA∆spoT (Fig 8A and S4 Fig). These results demonstrate that

305

filamentous cells are non-motile. It also indicates that ppGpp biosynthesis is required for

306

bacterial motility in D. dadantii.

307

Filamentous cells induced by ppGpp deficiency are more sensitive to hydrogen

308

peroxide and ampicillin stress.

309

Previous studies documented that some bacteria form filamentous cells as a response to

310

stress e. i. antibiotic persistence or host immune response [22]. To determine whether

311

filamentous cells of D. dadantii serve the same purposes, we compared the survival of

312

double and single deletion mutants of ppGpp biosynthesis genes with the wild type upon

313

two stress conditions hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and antibiotic ampicillin treatment.

314

Compared to the wild type, ∆relA∆spoT displayed increased susceptibility to sub-lethal

315

dosage of both hydrogen peroxide and ampicillin (Fig 8B). These results suggest that, in

316

contrast to previous examples, mutationally induced filamentous cells of D. dadantii not

317

only do not grant the bacteria any advantage, but rather compromised their ability, in

318

tolerating H2O2 and antibiotic ampicillin.

319

Filamentous cells are associated with increased expression of growth and

320

metabolism-associated genes and faster growth compared to short cells on decayed

321

potato tubers.

322

Despite finding that filamentous cells do not participate in virulence, are non-motile, and

323

more sensitive to stress, we sought clues as to the fitness advantages of these filamentous

324

cells during the host-microbe interactions. To further elucidate the biological functions, a

325

transcriptomic analysis was performed in the separated short cells and enriched

326

filamentous cells (S2 Fig). Compared to the short cells, 27 and 38 genes were found to be

327

down-regulated and up-regulated in the filamentous cells, respectively (Fig 9 and Table

328

2). Among the down-regulated genes (p < 0.05), genes encoding the T3SS (hrpA),

329

motility (motB) and stress tolerance (RS18760 and dprA) were identified. Down

330

regulation of ppGpp biosynthesis genes relA (relative mRNA expression filamentous

331

cells/short cells=0.43) and spoT (0.85), as well as a few pectate lyase and T3SS genes

332

(pelE, hrpY and hrcV; relative mRNA expression filamentous cells/short cells = 0.23,

333

0.46, and 0.09 respectively) were also identified, although the difference was not

334

statistically significant (p >0.05), possibly due to the fact that the enriched filamentous

335

cell samples still contained mixed-in short cells (S2 Fig). Among the up-regulated genes,

surprisingly, over 60% (23/38) of them are related to bacterial growth. Specific function

categories included substrate transport (5 genes), respiration (8 genes), and metabolism

342

To determine if the higher rate of metabolism in filamentous cells would result in faster

343

growth on potato tuber, we compared the number of progenies produced by the wild type,

344

which formed both filamentous cells and short cells, and by ∆spoT, which only formed

345

short cells (Fig 6A). Forty-eight hours after inoculation, 2.51×1011 CFU of wild type

346

were recovered per 0.03 gram of potato tissue (Fig 10, 48 hpi). Although ∆spoT showed

347

no attenuation in virulence compared to the wild type, it only produced 6.23×109 CFU of

348

cells from the same amount of tissue within the same period of time, or approximately 2%

349

of the wild type (Fig 10, 48 hpi). This reduction in growth in ∆spoT could be restored to

350

the wild-type level through complementation (2.20×1011 CFU). Interestingly, such

351

growth difference between wild type and ∆spoT was not observed at earlier stage of

352

infection when filamentous cells were not formed (Fig 10, 14 hpi). These data suggest

353

that filamentous cells formed at later stage of infection granted D. dadantii faster growth

354

on potato tuber.

355

Filamentous cells can transform to short cells upon exposure to fresh potato tissues

356

and freestanding water.

357

Filamentous cells contain large amount of biomass and may have the potential to split

358

into short cells. To test this hypothesis, a mixture of filamentous cells and short cells

359

collected from the P2 position of a decayed potato after 48 hpi were transferred to a fresh

360

potato tuber. The percentage of filamentous cells and short cells were monitored after the

361

transfer. As expected, exposure to fresh potato tissue caused a drastic reduction in

362

filamentous cell percentage in the total population, from 67.9% at 0 hpi, to 18.0% at 1 hpi,

363

and only 3.9% at 4 hpi (Fig 11A). To visualize the transformation process, a time-lapse

364

movie was captured documenting long, filamentous cells dividing to form multiple

365

shorter cells upon exposure to freestanding water (S2 Video). As additional evidence, we

366

used DAPI to stain the nucleoids of the filamentous cells. Multiple segmented nucleoids

367

were observed in some of the filamentous cells, suggesting that filamentous cells have the

368

potential to divide into short cells (Fig 11B). All together, these data support that the non-

369

virulent filamentous cells may be transformed to virulent short cells when environmental

370

conditions are suitable for infection and/or spread.

371

Discussion

372

In this study, we report heterogeneity in the morphology and physiology of a genetically

373

homogeneous population of D. dadantii during host infection. We determined that D.

374

dadantii adopts a bistable state in the host in which subpopulations adopt a suite of

375

multiple coordinated phenotypes: short cells were associated with virulence gene

376

expression, slower growth, and active motility, while filamentous cells were associated

377

with lack of virulence gene expression, faster growth, reduced stress tolerance, and lack

378

of motility. Furthermore, we found that the alarmone signal molecule ppGpp is critical

379

for the differentiation of cells into the two subpopulations.

380

The phenotypic states we observed were most obviously characterized by differentiation

381

in cell morphology and in virulence. Bacterial elongation and filamentation under natural

382

conditions have been previously reported in a few bacteria [22-25], with proposed

383

biological roles mainly related to stress tolerance [22]. For example, upon detection of

384

host immune activation, subpopulations of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC)

385

become filamentous during acute infection in the oligotrophic bladder environment [24].

386

Filamentous cells are more resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis, and are thought to play a

387

role in the survival and growth of UPEC during maturation of the intracellular bacterial

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/577296; this version posted March 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

23
388

communities (IBC) [25]. In other organisms, bacterial filamentation was shown to confer

389

tolerance to protist gazing [26] and antibiotic exposure [27, 28]. Different from the

390

previous studies, here we showed that filamentous cells of D. dadantii are not involved in

391

tolerance of the two stress conditions tested. Instead, they were induced in a nutrient-rich

392

host tissue when infection was well established, possibly as a mechanism to maximize

393

pathogen growth and nutrient utilization. While we observed that filamentation may be

394

associated with increased growth capacity and expression of metabolic genes, the

395

adaptive benefit to cell elongation itself remains to be seen.

396

Heterogeneity may provide fitness advantages for a bacterial population as a whole [29,

397

30]. Heterogeneity in virulence expression has been observed in other bacterial pathogens

398

[10, 11, 16], where it was observed that expression of virulence genes imposes a penalty

399

on bacterial growth rate [11]. However, the best-studied example of physiological

400

heterogeneity is the phenomenon of antibiotic persistence. Persistence is a strategy in

401

which a subpopulation of cells (persisters) exists in a dormant state that confers increased

402

tolerance to environmental stress [31]. Here heterogeneity is thought to work as a “bet-

403

hedging” strategy, benefiting the population as a whole by increasing its adaptability to

404

changing environments. It was also observed that persister cell formation is enhanced by

405

nutrient limitation and other sources of cellular stress [32, 33]. In contrast to persistence,

406

we found evidence that a subpopulation of D. dadantii forms filaments and increases its

407

growth capacity in high-nutrient tissues, but this comes at a cost of virulence gene

408

expression and tolerance to certain stresses. We hypothesize that in D. dadantii,

409

phenotypic heterogeneity may allow the pathogen to simultaneously accomplish the two

410

conflicting goals of virulence and vegetative growth. This is has been called a “division

24
411

of labor” strategy of phenotypic heterogeneity, in which a population benefits from two

412

physiological states with different tradeoffs. A proposed model for the occurrence and

413

function of phenotypic heterogeneity during the D. dadantii infection cycle is described

414

in Fig 12.

415

Interestingly, the alarmone signal ppGpp was implicated in a positive role in the

416

induction of the persister state [34]. Evidence points to stochastic noise in ppGpp

417

fluctuation as the most likely driver in the transition between persister and nonpersister

418

states in individuals of a bistable bacterial population [35]. Here we observed a strong

419

negative relationship between ppGpp and the filamentation of D. dadantii in tubers,

420

finding that ppGpp biosynthesis genes are differentially expressed in filamentous and

421

short cells, that exogenous application of ppGpp shifts the proportion of filamentous cells,

422

and that filamentation phenotypes can be recapitulated through the deletion of ppGpp

423

biosynthesis genes. In light of these findings, we propose that ppGpp variation also

424

mediates the multi-phenotype bistable state observed in D. dadantii during host infection.

425

ppGpp regulates diverse phenotypes including virulence, growth and motility [34, 36, 37],

426

thus cell-to-cell variation in ppGpp concentration could drive the tandem expression of

427

multiple phenotypes in single cells of D. dadantii. In linking ppGpp to a second form of

428

bistable state marked by coordinated cell length, virulence, and metabolic traits, this

429

study suggests that ppGpp-mediated pathogen population heterogeneity may be more

430

diverse and significant under native infection conditions than previously recognized. This

431

bistable state we observed was specific to certain conditions of host tissues, infection

432

sites, and water availability levels; the environmental factors and additional mechanisms

433

that trigger conditional bistability is unknown. However, these findings raise the

such easily observed morphological changes during infection.

h during the incubation. Tissues from the inoculated potato tubers were collected at

457

different time points and were used directly for microscopy, staining, or cell separation

458

procedures. Each experiment consisted of 3-5 biological replicates, and experiments were

459

repeated at least three times. Leaf and stem inoculations were performed using a

460

previously described method [41].

461

Microscopy

462

For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), potato tuber tissues with typical soft rot

463

symptoms were collected and fixed in paraformaldehyde/ glutaraldehyde (2.5% of each

464

compound in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield,

465

PA) at 25°C overnight. Fixed tissues were dehydrated in 25, 50, 75, and 90% ethanol for

466

1 hour each and in 100% ethanol three times for 30 minutes. Dehydrated samples were

467

air dried at room temperature and mounted on aluminum mounting stubs. Images were

468

captured using a Zeiss Sigma VP FESEM (Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany).

469

For epifluorescence microscopy, symptomatic tissues were mounted on glass microscope

470

slides with 1-2 µl of distilled water and covered with a coverslip. If it was necessary for

471

cells to be fixed onto the slides to produce a still image, slides coated with agarose (5 µl

472

of melted agarose on a glass slide to air dry) were used. Images were observed using a

473

Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc) outfitted with

474

a Zeiss AxioCam digital camera. For bacterial cell length measurement, ImageJ software

475

[42] was used to measure at least 1,000 individual cells from at least 5 different

476

microscopic views for each sample.

477

For confocal microscopy, samples were prepared using the same way as the

478

epifluorescence microscopy. Observation was made using a Leica SP5 confocal

479

microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), equipped with four lasers, 405 nm, multi line

480

Argon, 561 nm and 633 nm, and two HyD detectors.

481

Separation of filamentous cells and short cells

482

Potato tuber was inoculated with D. dadantii in the absence of freestanding water for 48 h.

483

Infected potato tissues were collected from P2 position and was resuspended in a RNA

484

protect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)-water solution (ratio 1:2). The tubes were vortexed

485

for 30 s to break up potato tissues and the intertwined bacterial cells. The resulting

486

suspension was filtered through a 70-µm laboratory sifting mesh (Carolina Biological

487

Supply Company, Burlington, NC, U.S.A.) to remove large plant debris. The flow-

488

through containing bacterial cells was loaded on top of a prepared sucrose gradient

489

solution (20%, 30%, 40%, 45% and 50%) and was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 30 min.

490

After centrifugation, short cells were collected from the 20% and 30% sucrose layers

491

while the mixture cells containing enriched filamentous cells were collected from 45%

492

and 50% sucrose layers. The enriched filamentous cells were further purified by

493

repeating this sucrose gradient centrifugation process. Filamentous cells collected from

494

the 45% and 50% sucrose layers of the second round purification and the short cells from

495

both the first and second rounds of purification were used for RNA extraction and

496

Western blot. Cell length prior to and after the sucrose gradient centrifugation procedure

497

was visualized by microscopy. This procedure was illustrated in S2 Fig.

499

To generate the relA-HA and spoT-HA in D. dadantii, we used double crossover

500

mutagenesis to insert a HA tag in frame at the 3’ end of the open reading frame (ORF) of

501

relA and spoT right before the stop codon in the D. dadantii chromosome. The 3’ region

502

of each gene ORF without the terminator was PCR-amplified with an HA Tag and

503

terminator, and the fragment downstream the gene ORF were also amplified. The

504

kanamycin cassette was amplified from pKD4 [43], and was cloned between two

505

flanking regions using three-way cross-over PCR. The PCR construct was inserted into

506

the suicide plasmid pWM91, and the resulting plasmid (pWM-relA-HA or pWM-spoT-

507

HA) was transformed into D. dadantii 3937 by conjugation using E. coli strain S17-1 λ-

508

pir. To select strains with HA tag, the conjugated bacteria were first grown on MG

509

medium amended with kanamycin, and then plated on MG plates amended with

510

kanamycin and 5% sucrose. Sequences of target genes linked with HA tag were

511

confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

512

D. dadantii cells with respective HA tags were separated by sucrose gradient

513

centrifugation and suspended in 0.5 × PBS buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication.

514

Proteins in crude lysates were boiled and loaded onto a 10% SDS/PAGE gel. Proteins

515

were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Burlington,

516

MA, USA). Blots were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and probed with

517

an anti-HA antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The GAPDH

518

protein stained with Coomassie blue was used as a loading control. The blots were

519

incubated for 5 min in enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,

520

USA) and detected using Kodak X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).

29
522

Total RNA collected from symptomatic potato tuber tissue was isolated using an RNeasy

523

Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA harvested from pel-MM or hrp-MM was isolated

524

using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Extracted RNA was treated with Turbo DNase I

525

(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of treated total RNA

526

with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The complementary

527

cDNA level of target genes was quantified by qRT-PCR using a SsoAdvanced universal

528

SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad), as described previously [41]. Data were analyzed

529

using a relative expression software tool [44]. The expression level of rplU was used as

530

an endogenous control. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.

531

RNA-Seq analysis

532

Total RNA quality and integrity was determined by a nanodrop (Thermo Fisher

533

Scientific) and by an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)

534

respectively. RNA transcripts were enriched by selectively depleting ribosomal RNA

535

molecules using the Ribo-Zero Bacteria Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) and then

536

sheared by incubation at 94 °C. Following first-strand synthesis with random primers,

537

second strand synthesis was performed with dUTP for generating strand-specific

538

sequencing libraries. The cDNA library was then end-repaired, and A-tailed, adapters are

539

ligated and second-strand digestion was performed by Uricil-DNA-Glycosylase. Sample

540

concentrations were normalized to 10 nM and loaded onto Illumina Rapid or High-output

541

flow cells at a concentration that yields 150-250 million passing filter clusters per lane.

542

Samples were sequenced using paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500

543

according to Illumina protocols.

544

D. dadantii 3937 genome (NC_014500.1) from NCBI was indexed using HISAT2 [45]

545

and was used as the reference genome in the RNA-seq analysis. The reads obtained from

546

the machine were trimmed for quality and length using customs scripts. The trimmed

547

reads were then aligned with the indexed D. dadantii genome using HiSAT2. Annotation

548

for the reference genome was obtained from the NCBI and used in the analysis. The

549

transcript abundances were estimated using ballgown [46]. The differential gene

550

expression was calculated using DESeq2 [47], and the results were visualized using R.

551

Mutant construction and complementation

552

The relA and spoT single and double deletion mutations were generated by marker

553

exchange mutagenesis. Briefly, two fragments flanking each target gene, as well as a

554

kanamycin cassette were PCR amplified. The three fragments were linked together using

555

a three-way cross-over PCR with kanamycin cassette flanked by the upstream and

556

downstream sequences of the target gene. The fusion PCR was inserted into a suicide

557

plasmid pWM91 [5]. The resulting plasmid (pWM-relA or pWM-spoT) was transformed

558

into D. dadantii 3937 by conjugation using E. coli strain S17-1 λ-pir. To select strains

559

with chromosomal deletions, recombinants, grown on MG medium amended with

560

kanamycin, were plated on MG agar plates with 5% sucrose. To generate the ΔrelAΔspoT

561

double deletion mutant, pWM-spoT was transformed into a relA marker-less mutant via

562

conjugation. The marker-less ΔrelA was generated by transferring plasmid pFLP-1 [5]

563

into the ΔrelA strain through electroporation. Transformants were plated on LB plates

564

containing ampicillin. Colonies that lost the kanamycin resistance were selected. pFLP-1

565

was cured from the mutants by replica plating on MG sucrose plates. To generate

566

complementation strains, open reading frame regions of relA and spoT were PCR

567

amplified and cloned into a low copy number plasmid pCL1920. Marker-less deletions

568

were confirmed by PCR. All mutants and complementation strains were confirmed by

569

sequencing.

570

ppGpp quantification by UPLC/MS/MS

571

Bacterial strains were grown in 500 ml LB to OD600 = 1 (109 CFU ml-1). Cell pellet was

572

harvested and immediately suspended in 2 ml of 100% cold methanol, vortexed, frozen in

573

liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice. Cell suspensions were then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm

574

for 10 min at 4°C. The bacterial supernatants were collected and stored on ice. Same

575

extraction procedure was repeated using the remaining pellet. Methanol extracts from the

576

two extractions were combined, freeze-dried and re-suspended in 200 µl distilled water

577

for LC/MS/MS analysis. Pure ppGpp (TriLink Biotech, CA, USA) was used as a positive

578

control. Mass spectrometric quantification was performed using a XEVO_TQS (Waters

579

Corporation, MA, USA) using ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem

580

mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Samples were run through an Acquity UPLC BEH

581

C18 1.7µm column (Waters Corporation, MA, USA) maintained at 40°C. Samples were

582

processed under the electrospray -ve (ES-) ion mode with a capillary voltage of 3 kV and

583

a desolvation temperature of 400°C with a sample injection volume of 10 µL. Methanol

584

(A) and 8mM DMHA+2.8nM acetic acid (B) in water were used as the two solvents

585

under a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The linear gradient for solvent B was as follows: 0-10

586

mins, 60%; 10-15 mins, 100%. MassLynx was used as the main interface software

587

(Waters Corporation, MA, USA). Area of the corresponding peak in each sample was

588

quantified using ImageJ.

Leaf maceration assay, hypersensitive response assay, and pectate lyase production

590

assay

591

Leaf maceration assay was performed on Chinese cabbage (B. campestris) as described

592

[48]. Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were harvested and re-suspended in 0.5x PBS

593

to a final concentration of 1×108 CFU ml-1. Ten microliters of bacterial suspension was

594

added on top of the wounds punched with a sterile pipette on the leaves. Inoculated

595

Chinese cabbage leaves were kept at 28°C with 100% relative humidity for 32 h. ImageJ

596

was used to determine the leaf maceration area. Bacterial growth under in vitro growing

597

conditions was monitored in a 96-well plate by measuring the absorbance of cell

598

suspensions at 600 nm in LB medium using a Synerge Mx Microplate Reader (BioTek,

599

Winooski, VT, USA).

600

Hypersensitive response assay was conducted using four week old tobacco (Nicotiana

601

tabacum L. cv. Xanthi) as previously described [49]. Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures

602

were harvested and re-suspended in 0.5x PBS to a final concentration of 1×108 CFU ml-1,

603

and were infiltrated into leaves using needle-less syringe. Infiltrated plants were

604

maintained in greenhouse, and HR symptoms were recorded at 20 hpi.

605

Plate assay for Pel production was performed as described by Matsumoto et al. [50].

606

Briefly, D. dadantii strains were cultured in pel-MM [51]. Twenty microliters of bacterial

607

supernatant was acquired by centrifuging 1 ml of the overnight bacterial culture, and was

608

applied to each well made in the Pel plate (1% of PGA, 1% of yeast extract, 50 µM CaCl2,

609

50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.8% agarose and 0.2% sodium azide) with a No. 2 cork borer

610

(ɸ5 mm). The bottom of each well was sealed with 0.8% of molten agarose. The plates

611

were incubated at 28 °C for 20 h, and Pel production indicated by halo rings was

612

developed by incubating the plates with 5 N of H2SO4 for 5 min.

613

Motility assay

614

For quantification of bacterial motility from decayed potato, potato tissues inoculated

615

with D. dadantii (pnptII-gfp) at 48 hpi were collected and resuspended in sterile distilled

616

water. Cells were viewed and imaged at 400× magnification on a fluorescence

617

microscope. Videos were captured for at least 30 seconds using screen capture tool

618

CamStudio (https://camstudio.org/). The speed of bacterial swimming was calculated by

619

measuring the mobile distance between two time points by using Adobe Photoshop

620

(Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). At least ten cells of each sample were used for speed

621

calculation.

622

For swimming and swarming motility plate assays, cells were cultured in LB broth

623

overnight, harvested and adjusted to a final concentration of 1×108 CFU ml-1 in 0.5×PBS.

624

Bacterial suspension of 10 µl was spotted onto the center of swimming plates (0.2% MG

625

agar) and swarming plates (0.4% LB agar). The plates were incubated at 28 °C for 19 h,

626

and the diameter of the radial growth was measured [52]. Each experiment consisted of

627

three biological replicates and was been repeated at least two times.

628

Bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress and antibiotics

629

For oxidative stress assay, overnight bacterial cultures were inoculated 1:100 into fresh

630

LB broth. After 18 h, H2O2 were added to the bacterial suspension to reach a final

631

concentration of 10 mM. The cell suspensions were incubated for an additional 2 h at

632

28°C. The number of colony forming unites (CFU) was determined by serial dilution and

633

plating at time 0 h and then every 30 min over a 2-h incubation period.

634

For ampicillin persistence assay, the overnight bacterial cultures were inoculated 1:100

635

into fresh LB broth. After 18 h, the cell suspensions were serial-diluted and plated onto

636

LB plates with and without ampicillin (1 µg ml-1 or none) to determine the number of

637

CFU.

638

Progeny quantification on potato tuber

639

The wild type, ΔspoT mutant, and complementation strain of D. dadantii (with nptII-gfp)

640

were cultured in LB broth and adjusted to the same concentration (108 CFU ml-1). Two

641

hundred microliters of cell suspension were added on top of dissected potato tuber,

642

respectively. Forty-eight hours post inoculation, 30 mg of macerated potato tuber tissue

643

was collected from the surface center of infected potato tuber respectively. The tissues

644

were re-suspended and incubated in 10 ml of sterile distilled H2O in a 100 ml grass flask

645

with shaking for 1 h at 28 °C. After 1 h incubation, the bacterial suspension was serial-

646

diluted and plated on LB Amp plates to determine the number of progeny.

647

Time-lapse microscopy

648

Bacteria were inoculated onto a potato tuber slide in the absence of freestanding water to

649

induce filamentous cell formation for 24 hrs. At the end of the incubation, 2 ml of sterile

650

distilled H2O was added onto the tuber surface to induce the filamentous cell division.

651

Twenty four hours later, the remaining filamentous cells collected from the surface center

652

of the infected tuber slide was seeded and grown on the agarose pads on microscope

654

protocol described by Young et al. [53].

655

DAPI staining

656

DAPI staining was performed as described by Markus et al [54]. Briefly, a mixture of

657

filamentous cells and short cells was collected from the surface center of the infected

658

potato tuber, resuspended in 0.1 ml PBS buffer, and then fixed in 75% ethanol for 10 min.

659

The fixed cell sample was collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in 20 μl of 10

660

mM Tris-MgCl2 buffer containing 1 µg ml-1 DAPI (10 mg ml-1stock), and was incubated

661

for 15 min at 23ºC. Stained cells were then imaged using excitation/emission filters at

662

360 nm (BW 40 nm) using a Zeiss Axio Scope (Carl Zeiss Inc) outfitted with a SPOT

663

RT3 digital camera.

664

Statistic analysis

665

Means and standard deviations of experimental results were calculated using Excel

666

(Microsoft, Redmond, WA), and statistical analyses were performed using the one-way

667

analysis of variance (ANOVA) model in the ‘stats’ package in R unless specified. All

668

experiment included at least three biological replicates and was repeated at least three

669

times with similar results observed.

Fig 12. Illustration of the short cell / filamentous cell differentiation of D. dadantii

763

and their respective functions during the infection of potato tuber. At the early stage

764

of infection, the majority of D. dadantii cells are in the short cell morphology (green

765

colored). These short cells produce pectate lyases (diamonds and stars) to disintegrate

766

plant cell wall and secretes type III effector proteins (circles) to induce host cell death. As

767

infection progresses, many plant cells are killed and nutrients are released, a

768

subpopulation of filamentous cells starts to emerge (orange-colored). These filamentous

769

cells do not produce any virulence factors, do not have motility, and are relatively

770

sensitive to environmental stress. However, these cells have much faster metabolism than

771

the short cells, which enable them to more efficiently consume the nutrients released and

772

build up a large population. When environmental conditions favor infection or spread (e.g.

773

when freestanding water is present), the filamentous cells which contain multiple

774

nucleoids, convert back to short cells and cause secondary infection.
