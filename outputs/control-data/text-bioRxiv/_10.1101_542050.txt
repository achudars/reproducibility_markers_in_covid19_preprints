ABSTRACT
Nucleic acid-based antiviral innate
immunity activates a signaling cascade that induces
type I and type III interferons (IFNs), and other
cytokines. This signaling, which is highly
regulated, is initiated by pattern recognition
receptors, such as RIG-I, that sense viral RNA and
then signal to the adaptor protein, MAVS. This
adaptor protein then recruits additional signaling
proteins, including TRAF3 and TBK1, to form a
signaling complex that results in IRF3 activation
for transcriptional induction of IFN. Here, we show
that the GTPase trafficking protein RAB1B
positively regulates RIG-I signaling to promote
IFN-β induction and the antiviral response. Overexpression of RAB1B increases RIG-I-mediated
signaling to IFN-β, while deletion results in
reduced signaling of this pathway. Additionally,
this loss of RAB1B results in a dampened antiviral
response, as Zika virus infection is enhanced in the
absence of RAB1B. Importantly, we identified the
mechanism of RAB1B action by determining that it

interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate the interaction of
TRAF3 with MAVS. Thus, we identified RAB1B
as a regulator of TRAF3 to promote the formation
of innate immune signaling complexes in response
to nucleic acid sensing.
Viruses are detected in the infected cell by
the antiviral innate immune system. This system is
activated when specific pattern recognition
receptors sense pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) that are unique to viruses for selfnonself discrimination. These viral PAMPs include
cytosolic nucleic acids derived from either RNA or
DNA viruses. Specifically, RIG-I and MDA5 sense
viral RNA in the cytoplasm, while cGAS and IFI16
sense viral DNA (1,2). Upon sensing of viral
nucleic acids, these sensor proteins become
activated, allowing them to signal to their
respective adaptor proteins, MAVS and STING
(3,4). These adaptors then recruit the downstream

RAB1B positively regulates antiviral innate immunity
signaling molecules that ultimately drive the
transcriptional induction of type I and type III
interferons (IFNs) (5), leading to the production of
hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of
which have antiviral functions (6).
The antiviral innate immune response is
carefully regulated to adequately inhibit viral
infection without causing excessive inflammation
in host tissues. This regulation can occur in several
ways, including post-translational modification of
signaling
proteins,
unique
protein-protein
interactions between signaling proteins and their
regulators, and through changes in localization of
signaling proteins and regulators to different
subcellular compartments. The RNA sensor RIG-I
is regulated by all three of these mechanisms.
Before viral infection, RIG-I resides in the
cytoplasm in an inactive state (7). However, during
RNA virus infection, both Riplet and TRIM25
ubiquitinate RIG-I with K63-linked ubiquitin
chains (8-10). This ubiquitination allows RIG-I to
interact with the chaperone protein 14-3-3ε.
Subsequently, 14-3-3ε translocates RIG-I into
membranes to interact with MAVS and induce
downstream signaling (11). Besides RIG-I, other
antiviral signaling proteins are regulated by
localization changes during induction of antiviral
innate immune signaling. For example, the
serine/threonine kinase TBK1 and the E3 ubiquitin
ligase TRAF3 both have been shown to relocalize
upon nucleic acid sensing (12,13) to interact with
the MAVS signaling complex at mitochondria and
ER contact sites, otherwise known as
mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (MAMs)
(14). The mechanism(s) by which these proteins
relocalize upon nucleic acid sensing and the
consequences of this relocalization are not fully
understood.
Previously, we have found that during viral
infection many cellular proteins change their
localization to and from MAMs (15). One of these
proteins is the GTPase protein RAB1B, which is
recruited into MAMs and the MAVS signaling
complex during RIG-I pathway activation (15).
RAB1B, which is functionally distinct from the
related RAB1A protein, regulates ER-to-Golgi
trafficking by binding to effector proteins that
tether ER-derived vesicles to the cytoskeleton to
facilitate the movement of these vesicles to the
Golgi (16,17). Interestingly, a known RAB1B
effector protein called p115 has previously been

shown to interact with TRAF3 and is required for
TRAF3 trafficking from the Golgi to the MAVS
signaling complex (13), suggesting that RAB1B
may be required for TRAF3 interaction with
MAVS during RIG-I signaling.
Here, we have identified a role for RAB1B
in positively regulating RIG-I pathway signaling to
type I IFN. We show that RAB1B interacts with
TRAF3 to promote the interaction of TRAF3 with
the signaling adaptor protein MAVS. Ultimately,
this work reveals that the known cellular trafficking
protein RAB1B interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate
the assembly of innate immune signaling
complexes, providing a new example of a
trafficking protein that is repurposed to regulate the
host response to virus infection.
RESULTS
RAB1B positively regulates RIG-I pathway
signaling to IFN-β and the antiviral response.
Previously, we found that following RIG-I
signaling RAB1B localizes to the MAM and is in a
complex with MAVS (15). To determine if this
MAVS-interacting protein also regulates RIGI/MAVS pathway signaling to IFN-β, we measured
Sendai virus (SenV)-mediated signaling to the IFNβ promoter following over-expression of RAB1B in
293T cells. SenV is a negative-strand RNA virus
that potently induces RIG-I/MAVS signaling to
IFN-β (18,19). We found that while overexpression of RAB1B on its own did not
significantly induce signaling to IFN-β, it did
augment SenV-mediated signaling to IFN-β, as
measured by an IFN-β promoter luciferase assay,
and it increased IFNB1 mRNA levels, as measured
by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 1AB). Importantly, over-expression of RAB1B also
enhanced the levels of IFNB1 transcripts following
transfection of a RIG-I agonist (the hepatitis C virus
(HCV) 5’ppp-containing polyU/UC RNA) (20),
suggesting that RAB1B directly regulates RIG-I
pathway signaling (Fig. 1C). We also found that
RAB1B over-expression enhanced SenV-mediated
induction of IFNB1 transcripts in the human
monocyte THP1 cells (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these
data suggest that while RAB1B does not induce
signaling on its own, it does enhance RIG-I
pathway signaling to IFN-β.
To determine whether loss of RAB1B
decreased RIG-I pathway signaling to IFN-β, we
depleted RAB1B in 293T cells using an siRNA.

RAB1B positively regulates antiviral innate immunity
Depletion of RAB1B resulted in a decrease in the
induction of IFNB1 transcripts following SenV
infection (Fig. 2A). To confirm this result, we
generated 293T cells deficient in RAB1B by using
CRISPR/Cas9 and then measured SenV-induced
signaling to IFN-β by RT-qPCR in the parental or
RAB1B knockout (KO) 293T cells. Loss of
RAB1B resulted in decreased induction of IFNB1
transcripts following SenV infection, confirming
that RAB1B positively regulates IFN-β induction
(Fig. 2B).
Since RAB1B positively regulated
induction of IFN-β, we hypothesized that it would
also be required for antiviral responses driven by
IFN. Therefore, we tested if loss of RAB1B resulted
in higher levels of viral infection during Zika virus
(ZIKV) infection, a virus known to be susceptible
to type I IFN (21). We treated Huh7 cells with either
an siRNA to RAB1B or control, infected these cells
with ZIKV (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01),
and then 48 hours later measured the production of
infectious ZIKV particles in the supernatant using a
focus-forming assay. In RAB1B depleted cells,
ZIKV titer was increased by approximately fifty
percent as compared to the control cells (Fig. 2C).
Collectively, these data reveal that RAB1B
positively regulates the antiviral response.
RAB1B is required for phosphorylation of
IRF3 and TBK1. The induction of IFN-β in
response to viral infection requires the kinase
TBK1, which is activated by autophosphorylation.
This activated TBK1 then phosphorylates the
transcription factor IRF3 at multiple residues,
allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it
cooperates with NF-κB to transcriptionally induce
IFN-β (5,22,23). To determine if RAB1B was
required to activate this signaling cascade, we first
measured the phosphorylation of IRF3 at S396 (pIRF3) in response to SenV infection in the parental
and RAB1B KO 293T cells by immunoblot
analysis. We found that the phosphorylation of
IRF3 in response to SenV was decreased in the
RAB1B KO cells as compared to the parental cells,
revealing that RAB1B activates innate immune
signaling upstream of IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig.
3A). Next, to test whether RAB1B is required for
the activation and autophosphorylation of TBK1 in
this system, we measured phosphorylation of TBK1
at S172 (p-TBK1) after SenV infection in the
parental and RAB1B KO 293Ts by immunoblot
analysis. We found that TBK1 phosphorylation in

response to SenV was decreased in the RAB1B KO
cells as compared to the parental cells (Fig. 3B).
Taken together, these data suggest that RAB1B
promotes signaling that leads to TBK1
autophosphorylation and subsequent IRF3
phosphorylation in response to RIG-I activation.
RAB1B interacts with TRAF3. As RAB1B
is required for TBK1 activation, this suggested to
us that RAB1B may act on a protein that regulates
TBK1. The TRAF proteins, specifically TRAF2,
TRAF3, and TRAF6, are well-known regulators of
TBK1 activation (24). We decided to focused on
TRAF3 specifically because the known RAB1B
effector protein p115 has previously been shown to
regulate TRAF3 function during RIG-I signaling
(13). Therefore, to test if RAB1B interacted with
TRAF3, we over-expressed HA-RAB1B and MycTRAF3 in cells in which we activated RIG-I
signaling by over-expression of the constitutively
active form of RIG-I (RIG-I-N) (25). We found that
Myc-TRAF3 co-immunoprecipitated with HARAB1B only upon activation of the RIG-I pathway
(Fig. 4A). We have previously shown that RAB1B
is in complex with MAVS following MAVS
overexpression, which is known to activate
signaling (15). Therefore, to determine if MAVS
signaling is sufficient for RAB1B to interact with
TRAF3, we over-expressed HA-RAB1B and GFPTRAF3, as well as Flag-MAVS to activate
signaling, in cells. We found that GFP-TRAF3 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-RAB1B only in the
presence of over-expressed MAVS, which was also
detected in the complex, suggesting these proteins
form a complex in response to signaling (Fig. 4B).
RAB1B is required for TRAF3 to interact
with MAVS. As TRAF3 interaction with MAVS is
required for TBK1 activation and recruitment to the
MAVS signaling complex (26,27), we next tested if
RAB1B was required for this TRAF3-MAVS
interaction. We measured the interaction of
endogenous MAVS and TRAF3 during a time
course
of
SenV-infection
by
coimmunoprecipitation. We found that MAVS and
TRAF3 interacted at six hours post-SenV infection
in 293T cells; however, this interaction was reduced
in the RAB1B KO 293T cells (Fig. 4C). These data
demonstrate that RAB1B facilitates the interaction
of TRAF3 with MAVS in response to activation of
innate immune signaling.

RAB1B positively regulates antiviral innate immunity
Although the signaling proteins in
cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways have been
well studied, the molecular mechanisms by which
these proteins are regulated are less defined.
Previously, we identified proteins that may regulate
the assembly of the MAVS signaling complex at
membrane contact sites between ER, mitochondria,
and peroxisomes through proteomic analysis of the
proteins that relocalize into these contacts sites
during RIG-I activation (15). Some of these
proteins with differential membrane association
upon RIG-I signaling included GTPase proteins,
such as RAB1B. Here, we have shown that RAB1B
positively regulates RNA sensing by promoting
RIG-I signaling to IFN-β through interactions with
the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3. This interaction
facilitates TRAF3 recruitment to MAVS, leading to
phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3 for the
transcriptional induction of IFN-β. In summary, our
work reveals that the known cellular trafficking
protein RAB1B interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate
the assembly of the MAVS signaling complex,
providing a new example of a trafficking or
chaperone protein that is repurposed to regulate the
host response to virus infection (see model in Fig.
5).
It is unclear if RAB1B directly regulates
TRAF3 or if RAB1B effector proteins are required
for this regulation. We know that small GTPase
proteins such as RAB1B regulate intracellular
membrane trafficking by interacting with effector
proteins (16). RAB1B, similar to other GTPase
proteins, cycles between an inactive GDP-bound
state and an active GTP-bound state that associates
with intracellular membranes (16). Importantly,
this GTP-bound, membrane-associated RAB1B
facilitates COPI recruitment and cargo transport
between the ER and the Golgi by interactions with
specific effector proteins (28). These effector
proteins include tethering factors that link
organelles and vesicles prior to fusion, adaptors for
motor proteins that direct organelle trafficking, and
regulators of other GTPases that are recruited to the
specific subcellular compartments of those
GTPases (29). Therefore, RAB1B effector proteins
are critical for RAB1B trafficking functions and are
likely important for mediating the role of RAB1B
in antiviral innate immunity. Indeed, the RAB1B
effector protein p115 has previously been shown to
interact with TRAF3 and be required for TRAF3
recruitment to the MAVS signaling complex (13).

Thus, it is likely that RAB1B interacts with p115 to
facilitate the movement of TRAF3 on vesicles from
the Golgi apparatus to site of MAVS signaling.
There is evidence that Golgi and other intracellular
membranes rearrange during MAVS signaling to
bring MAVS in contact with the Golgi-associated
TRAF3 (13,14). As we were unable to detect
relocalization of RAB1B to MAVS-signaling sites
(data not shown), this suggests that only a small
proportion of RAB1B, likely the p115-bound form,
interacts with TRAF3 at any given time. Indeed,
RAB1B has multiple effector proteins (16,30),
which suggests that different pools of RAB1B in
the cell may have different functions that could be
activated by interactions with specific effector
proteins.
The mechanisms by which RAB1B would
interact with a unique set of effectors during
cytosolic nucleic acid sensing are not entirely clear.
While the overall localization of RAB1B does not
change in the cell during innate immune signaling,
it is possible that specific post-translational
modifications are altered (either added or removed)
on RAB1B, which may facilitate interactions with
a new set of effectors. Indeed, post-translation
modification of small GTPase proteins does alter
their association with effector proteins and
therefore their biological functions. For example,
the GTPase RALB is ubiquitinated by K63ubiquitin linkages to switch from its role in
autophagy to a role in innate immune signaling
(31,32). This ubiquitination prevents RALB from
binding to its autophagy effector protein EXO84
and instead allows RALB to bind to the Sec5
effector protein for interaction with TBK1 to
regulate innate immunity. Similarly, ubiquitination
of the ARF domain of TRIM23 activates the GTP
hydrolysis activity of TRIM23 to regulate the
function of TBK1 in autophagy (33). Therefore, it
is possible that changes in post-translational
modification of RAB1B allows it to interact with
TRAF3 for innate immune signaling. Other innate
immune signaling proteins are also known to be
activated
by
specific
post-translational
modifications (34). Therefore, addition and
removal of post-translational modifications on
signaling chaperone or trafficking proteins may be
a general cellular mechanism to repurpose these
proteins into innate immune signaling regulators,
and future studies will examine this possibility for
RAB1B.

RAB1B positively regulates antiviral innate immunity
Our results suggest that the interaction of
RAB1B with TRAF3 is important to induce RIGI/MAVS-mediated innate immune responses. We
do not yet know if RAB1B interacts only with
TRAF3 or if it also regulates the functions of
TRAF2 and TRAF6. As TRAF2, TRAF3, and
TRAF6 have been shown to act at different time
points after signaling induction (27), it is possible
that while RAB1B regulates TRAF3, other RAB or
GTPase proteins may regulate TRAF2 or TRAF6 to
promote innate immune signaling.
Our work adds RAB1B to a growing list of
GTPase proteins that have been shown to regulate
innate immune signaling, either by regulating
trafficking of innate immune signaling proteins or
specific effector protein interactions. For example,
cytosolic DNA-induced innate immune responses
mediated by cGAS have been shown to be regulated
by RAB2B and its effector protein GARIL5 (35).
Signaling from the bacterial LPS sensor TLR4 is
also regulated by RAB proteins (36-39).
Specifically, both RAB10 and RAB11A positively
regulate TLR4 signaling (36), with RAB10
promoting TLR4 recycling to the plasma
membrane, and RAB11B promoting TLR4
localization to the Escherichia coli phagosome
(38,39). Conversely, RAB7B negatively regulates
TLR4 signaling by promoting lysosomal
degradation of TLR4 (37). As intracellular innate
immunity is so often regulated at the cell biological
level (40), it is likely that other RAB proteins will
control specific intracellular trafficking events that
regulate nucleic acid-induced innate immunity and
viral infection.

RAB1B positively regulates antiviral innate immunity
and KpnI. To generate the CRISPR guide RNA
plasmid, sgRNA oligonucleotides were annealed
and inserted into the BbsI-digested pX330 (46). The
oligonucleotide sequences used for cloning are
listed in Table 1. The plasmid sequences were
verified by DNA sequencing and are available upon
request.
Generation of RIG-I agonist. Annealed
oligonucleotides containing the sequence of the
HCV 5’ppp poly-U/UC region (Table 1) (20) were
in vitro transcribed using the Megashortscript T7
transcription kit (Ambion) followed by ethanol
precipitation, with the resulting RNA resuspended
at 1 µg/µL for use in experiments.
Transfection. DNA transfections were
performed using FuGENE6 (Promega). RIG-I
agonist transfections were done using the TransITmRNA Transfection kit (Mirus Bio). The siRNA
transfections were done using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen). The IFN-β-promoter
luciferase assays were performed as previously
described at 12 or 16 h post Mock or SenV infection
and normalized to the Renilla luciferase
transfection control (18).
Generation of KO cells lines. RAB1B KO
293T cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9, using
a single guide targeting exon 4 designed using the
CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu).
pX330-sgRAB1B was transfected into 293T cells
along with pcDNA containing blasticidin resistance
(pcDNA-Blast) for 24 h. Cells were then replated at
limiting dilutions into 15 cm dishes with 10 µg/mL
blasticidin treatment for 3 days. Single cell colonies
were then amplified and screened for RAB1B
expression by immunoblot. Genomic DNA was
extracted from candidate RAB1B KO cells using
QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen),
as per manufacturer’s instructions. This genomic
DNA was then amplified (using primers across
exon 4, see Table 1), cloned into the pCR4-TOPO
TA vector (Invitrogen), and Sanger sequenced.
Eleven resulting genomic DNA subclones were
sequenced, and nine clones had a 27 bp deletion at
the end of exon 4 that extended into the intron and
two clones had a 1 bp insertion in exon 4 that
resulted in a frame shift that lead to a premature
stop codon within exon 5.
RNA Analysis. Total cellular RNA was
extracted using the Purelink RNA mini kit (Life
Technologies). RNA was then reverse transcribed
using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad), as

per the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting
cDNA was diluted 1:3 in ddH2O. RT-qPCR was
performed in triplicate using the Power SYBR
Green PCR master mix (Thermo-Fisher) and the
Applied Biosystems Step One Plus or QuantStudio
6 Flex RT-PCR systems. The oligonucleotide
sequences used are listed in Table 1.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in a
modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100)
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma) and Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher), and post-nuclear lysates were isolated by
centrifugation. Quantified protein (between 5-15
µg) was resolved by SDS/PAGE, transferred to
nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes in a 25 mM Tris-192 mM glycine0.01% SDS buffer and blocked in StartingBlock
(Thermo-Fisher) buffer, 5% milk in phosphatebuffered saline containing 0.01% Tween-20 (PBST), or 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.01% Tween-20 (TBS-T). After washing with
PBS-T or TBS-T (for phosphoproteins) buffer,
membranes were incubated with species-specific
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:5000) followed by
treatment of the membrane with ECL+ (GE
Healthcare) or Clarity Western ECL substrate

mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol,
and 1% Triton X-100). Quantified protein (between
200-500 µg) was incubated with protein-specific or
isotype control antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) in lysis buffer at 4°C overnight with
head over tail rotation. The lysate/antibody mixture
was then incubated with Protein G Dynabeads
(Invitrogen) for 2 h. Beads were washed 3X in PBS
or modified RIPA buffer for immunoprecipitation
and eluted in 2X Laemmli Buffer (BioRad)
supplemented with 5% 2-Mercaptoethanol at 95°C
for 10 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE
and immunoblotting, as above.
Statistical Analysis. Student’s unpaired ttest was used for statistical analysis of the data
using GraphPad Prism software. Graphed values

are presented as mean ± SD or SEM (n = 3 or as
indicated); *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, and ***p ≤
0.001.

Figure 5. Model of RAB1B regulation of IFN-β-induction. RNA viruses are sensed in the cytoplasm by
RIG-I or MDA5 (Step 1). After sensing viral RNA, RIG-I translocates to ER-mitochondrial contact sites at
mitochondrial-associated ER membranes where it interacts with MAVS (Step 2). RAB1B, normally
involved in ER-Golgi trafficking, then interacts with TRAF3 (Step 3) and facilitates TRAF3 interaction
with MAVS (Step 4). This interaction may be facilitated by re-arrangements in intracellular membranes of
the Golgi and/or ER. TRAF3-MAVS interaction results in activation and autophosphorylation of TBK1
(Step 5), which then phosphorylates IRF3 (Step 6), resulting in IRF3 dimerization and translocation to the
nucleus, where it cooperates with NF-κB to induce IFN-β transcription and the subsequent antiviral
response (Step 7).
