Abstract: (250 words)

36

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication requires remodeling of the host metabolic network,

37

including increasing central carbon metabolism, fatty acid elongation and lipid synthesis. The

38

virus-host interactions regulating HCMV metabolic hijacking are essential to infection. While

39

multiple host factors including kinases and transcription factors have been defined, little is

40

known about the viral factors required. Some host factors involved are dependent on Ca2+

41

signaling or host stress response. The viral pUL37x1 protein mobilizes Ca2+ and targets the

42

mitochondria. The Ca2+ changes induced by pUL37x1 can activate stress responses. In this

43

study, we tested the hypothesis that the viral pUL37x1 protein is required for HCMV metabolic

44

remodeling. Using a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics, and metabolic tracers, we

45

demonstrate that pUL37x1 protein is necessary for HCMV induced fatty acid elongation and

46

lipid metabolism but not required for most viral hijacking of central carbon metabolism.

47

Additionally, we show that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV to fully induce two host proteins that

48

were previously demonstrated to be important for virus induced lipid metabolism: fatty acid

49

elongase 7 and the ER-stress related kinase PERK. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that

50

HCMV replication results in the increase in phospholipids with very-long chain fatty acyl tails.

51

We conclude that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV metabolic remodeling but is not necessary to

52

for the virus to hijack metabolism on a network-wide scale.

57

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that infects most people and

58

establishes a lifelong infection. Infection is generally asymptomatic. However, HCMV can cause

59

end-organ disease that results in death in the immunosuppressed. Additionally, HCMV is the

60

leading cause of congenital infection and birth defects. Children born with congenital HCMV

61

may suffer lifelong disabilities such as hearing loss, microcephaly, and developmental

62

impairment. Although there are treatments approved for HCMV, none offer a cure. HCMV

63

infection depends on remodeling host metabolism. Blocking the virus from hijacking metabolism

64

limits HCMV replication. However, the viral mechanisms for remodeling metabolism are poorly

65

understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the viral pUL37x1 protein is required for HCMV

66

to increase fatty acid elongation and remodel lipid metabolism. Our findings define an important

67

viral player in controlling the virus-host metabolism interaction.

Introduction:

71
72

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a β-herpesvirus that established a persistent lifelong

73

infection. Infection is common, a majority of people are infected (1). HCMV is an opportunistic

74

pathogen that can cause severe and life-threatening diseases when the immune system is

75

compromised, such as in solid-organ and stem cell transplant patients or those with HIV/AIDS

76

(1, 2). HCMV is also a major cause of birth defects (2). Congenital infection can result in hearing

77

loss, microcephaly, developmental disabilities, and fetal loss (3, 4). HCMV infections have been

78

associated with cardiovascular disease (5, 6), cancers (7) and age-related immune function (8-

79

10).

80
81

Since HCMV—like all viruses—does not encode a metabolic network, it relies on the host to

82

provide the energy, metabolites, and lipids required for replication. Limiting nutrients or targeting

83

metabolic pathways inhibits HCMV replication (11-16). Virus replication results in a global

84

change in metabolism, altering the concentration of most metabolites that have been examined

85

(11, 12, 14-24). HCMV infection alters central carbon metabolism and increases the utilization of

86

glucose and glutamine (11, 20, 23, 25-27). Infection increases the flow of carbons from glucose

87

to lipid synthesis (11, 12, 17, 24, 28-30). HCMV incorporates specific lipids into its envelope (12,

88

31). Importantly, lipids synthesized during infection are required to build the virus envelope

89

membrane (12). Previously we demonstrated that carbons from glucose are used for fatty acid

90

(FA) elongation to generate very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) through the action of fatty acid

91

elongase 7 (ELOVL7) (12, 17). ELOVL7 is required for efficient virus release and virion

92

infectivity, demonstrating the fatty acid elongation is required for infection (12).

93
94

The virus-host metabolism interactions involve various host and viral factors. HCMV replication

95

depends on AMPK dependent metabolic regulation (21, 32). During infection, HCMV actives

96

AMPK through Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) activity (32). CaMKK is

97

required for HCMV hijacking of glycolysis (22). HCMV limits AMPK downregulation of FA

98

synthesis (33). HCMV induced ELOVL7 activity requires the early viral protein pUL38 (12).

99

pUL38 prevents mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inactivation and induces the

100

maturation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) transcription factors to

101

enhance FA metabolism (12, 33, 34). In addition to mTOR, other kinases are also used by

102

HCMV to hijack metabolism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress kinase, PKR-like ER kinase

103

(PERK, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3, EIF2AK3) is also

104

activated by HCMV to increase lipid synthesis (29).

105
106

Although some of the host factors that HCMV uses to modulate specific metabolic pathways

107

have been defined, little is known about the viral factors that required to coordinate the hijacking

108

of the host metabolic network beyond our initial understanding of the role of pUL38. Since

109

CaMKK activity is stimulated by Ca2+, viral stimulation of glycolysis may depend on intracellular

110

Ca2+ mobilization. HCMV infection increases intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (35). HCMV

111

pUL37x1 protein triggers the release of ER stored Ca2+ into the cytosol (36). Thus, pUL37x1

112

mediated increase of Ca2+ into the cytosol could alter metabolism (Fig. 1). In addition to Ca2+

113

release, pUL37x1 blocks apoptosis and targets the mitochondria (37-40) while increasing the

114

fragmentation of the mitochondrial network (41). Given the importance of the mitochondria to

115

metabolism, this could be an additional mechanism for HCMV metabolic control (Fig. 1).

116

pUL37x1 traffics to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it contacts the ER (42). The

117

subcellular location of pUL37x1 or stress-associated with the release of stored ER Ca2+ may

118

influence ER-related metabolism, such as FA elongation and lipid synthesis.

119
120

Given pUL37x1 function in Ca2+ mobilization and localization to membranes important for

121

metabolism, we—and others (18, 22, 43, 44)—hypothesize that HCMV metabolic remodeling

122

requires pUL37x1. We tested this hypothesis using a mutant virus that lacks the UL37x1 gene

123

(36, 45) in combination with metabolomics, lipidomics and metabolic tracing experiments. We

124

found that pUL37x1 is required for the overall robustness of HCMV metabolic remodeling;

125

however, the virus is able to induce metabolic hijacking independent of pUL37x1. Specifically,

126

pUL37x1 supports HCMV induction of FA and lipid metabolism while increasing ELOVL7 and

127

PERK protein levels. Moreover, our findings establish that HCMV infection results in a robust

128

increase in phospholipids with very long chain fatty acid (PL-VLCFA) tails. pUL37x1 is important

129

for the dramatic increase in these PL-VCFAs. Additionally, pUL37x1 suppresses the levels of

130

phosphatidylserine lipids with shorter tails that are associated with apoptotic signaling. The

131

findings reported here improve our understanding of the viral mechanisms used by HCMV to

132

remodel metabolism and further illustrates that HCMV commandeers metabolism to generate a

133

metabolic environment and lipidome that supports infection.

Results:

139
140

Active HCMV replication requires the products of various metabolic pathways including those

141

involved in energy, amino acid, nucleotides, fatty acids and lipids. HCMV pUL38 prevents

142

mTOR deactivation and stimulates SREBP maturation and fatty acid elongation (12, 33).

143

Beyond pUL38, we have a limited understanding of the viral mechanisms used to alter varied

144

metabolic pathways. We and others (43) hypothesize that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV

145

metabolic control. We directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the viral control of metabolite

146

concentrations in WT infected cells to those infected with a mutant virus that lacks the UL37x1

147

gene (36).

148
149

Global metabolome remodeling by HCMV occurs largely independent of pUL37x1

150

Our work builds on the well-defined HCMV remodeling of the metabolome of primary human

151

fibroblast cells under fully-confluent, serum-free conditions (11, 12, 14-17, 22, 23, 32, 33). Since

152

most prior characterization of pUL37x1-null viruses was done under sub- or near-full confluent

153

conditions in the presence of animal serum, we briefly characterized the mutant virus infection in

154

confluent, serum-free conditions. We confirmed that our pUL37x1-null mutant virus, subUL37x1

155

(36), expresses pUL36 and pUL38 while ablating pUL37x1 expression (Fig. 2A). The cytopathic

156

effect (CPE) characterized by WT infection—e.g. visual cytomegaly—was lessened in cells

157

infected with the subUL37x1 mutant (Fig. 2B). At the later stages of infection, a greater amount

158

of cellular debris was observed in mutant virus infected cells, consistent with an increase in cell

159

death at 3-4 days post infection (dpi) (Fig. 2B). We observed a strong loss in virus replication

160

with UL37x1 deletion (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the loss of pUL37x1 also resulted in the release of

161

fewer infectious virions per total released viral particles (Fig. 2D). Overall, these results were

162

consistent with observations of UL37x-1 null mutant viruses in sub-confluent cells grown in

163

serum (36, 38, 39).

164
165

Next, we tested if pUL37x1 is required for viral hijacking of the host metabolome using liquid-

166

chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Infection with WT

167

AD169 virus resulted in a global remodeling of metabolites that were most dramatically changed

168

at 1 dpi and later (Figure 3A). HCMV strongly increases glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites

169

along with others that have been previously described (11, 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 46). Infection with

170

the mutant subUL37x1 virus similarly altered metabolite levels starting at 1 dpi (Figure 3A). The

171

correlation between metabolic profiles of WT and subUL37x1 infected cells was low early in

172

infection (Fig. 3B, 6 hpi) but strongly correlated at later time points (Fig. 3B, 1-3 dpi).

173

Importantly, glycolytic and TCA metabolites—e.g., hexose-phosphate, pyruvate, malate, α-

174

ketoglutarate, and succinate—were increased in subUL37x1-infected cells compared to

175

uninfected cells but were slightly reduced compared to WT-infected cells (Fig. 3A) These

176

findings demonstrated that pUL37x1 may contribute to HCVM remodeling of specific metabolic

177

pathways, but is not required for the global hijacking of the host metabolism.

178
179

pUL37x1 is necessary for HCMV-induced FA elongation

180

Our metabolomic studies examined water-soluble metabolites. Hydrophobic compounds

181

including lipids and fatty acids were not included in this type of analysis. HCMV enhances FA

182

synthesis and dramatically increases FA elongation (11, 12, 17). FA synthase (FAS) forms long-

183

chain FAs up to 16 carbons in length (C16) by connecting carbons, two at time. The product of

184

FAS is 16-carbon saturated FA palmitate (C16:0, the number following the colon represents the

185

number of double bonds in the FA). Palmitate can be processed further to make longer chains

186

and/or desaturated to introduce a double bond among the carbons in the tail. In humans, longer

187

FAs are made by one or more of the seven FA elongases (ELOVL1-7), again adding one 2-

188

carbon unit per reaction cycle. We have previously shown that HCMV significantly increases the

189

concentration of saturated very-long chain FAs (VLCFA), specifically those with 24 or more

190

carbons (>C24) (12, 17).

191
192

To determine if pUL37x1 is important for HCMV induced FA metabolism, we measured FAs

193

extracted from lipids of infected and mock-infected control cells. In cells infected with WT virus,

194

saturated VLCFAs were increased by as much as 9-fold compared to uninfected cells

195

confirming our previous observations (Fig. 4) (12, 17). While subUL37x1 virus increased some

196

FAs compared to uninfected cells, the mutant virus failed to induce WT-like levels of VLCFAs at

197

2 and 3 dpi (Fig 4).

198
199

FA elongation can be monitored by measuring the incorporation of 13C from labeled glucose into

200

FAs using LC- MS, i.e., non-tandem MS1-only analysis (12, 17, 47). Following a 1h infection

201

period, we fed WT and subUL37x1 infected cells medium that contained 13C-labeled glucose at

202

positions 1 and 6 (1,6-13C-glucose). Glycolytic breakdown of this labeled form of glucose will

203

result in 1-labeled pyruvate (Fig. 5A). Pyruvate can be further metabolized generating 1-labeled

204

citrate in the mitochondria. Citrate can be exported into the cytoplasm where it is broken down

205

into 1-labeled acetyl-CoA and unlabeled oxaloacetate. Alternatively, pyruvate may breakdown

206

into acetate that can be converted to acetyl-CoA (24, 48). The conversation of acetyl-CoA to

207

malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC-1) is the rate-limiting step of fatty acid

208

synthesis and elongation. In our labeled cells this will result in 1-labeled malonyl-CoA per 2-

209

carbon unit used for FA synthesis and elongation.

210
211

Using LC-MS to measure the overall percent of FA tails that have one or more 13C atoms, we

212

observed that uninfected cells have minimal to no labeling of FAs after correcting for the natural

213

isotopic abundance of 13C. This is consistent with the cells being in a non-growing state due to

214

contact-inhibition and serum-starvation. HCMV infection, however, strongly induced FA

215

anabolism. In WT-infected cells a significantly higher proportion of FAs were labeled, and the

216

greatest labeling occurred in longer FAs (Fig. 5B). SubUL37x1 also induced FA metabolism

217

compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 5B), however the labeling rate was less than that observed in

218

WT-infected cells. For example, more than half of the C26:0 was labeled during WT-infection

219

while only a quarter was labeled in subUL37x1-infected cells. In addition to a reduction in the

220

percent of labeling, the FAs isolated from mutant virus infected cells had fewer number of 13C

221

atoms (Fig. 5D). In WT infected cells, we were able to observe up to 4-5 labeled atoms (or the

222

incorporation of 8-10 new carbons). This observation was similar to that observed in cells fed

223

uniformly labeled 13C-glucose where two 13C atoms are added per 2-carbon units (12, 17).

224

However, subUL37x-1 infection resulted in only 1-2 labeled atoms indicating that only one to

225

two 2-carbon units were added.

226
227

Our glucose labeling strategy measured the carbon contribution of both citrate and acetate that

228

is derived from glucose. Since HCMV infection increases the contribution of acetate feeding into

229

lipid synthesis (24), we measured the contribution of acetate to HCMV-induced FA elongation

230

using 13C-labeled acetate. In this case both atoms of the 2-carbon unit were labeled. Again,

231

cells were fed labeled acetate following a 1h infection period. Similar to the labeled-glucose

232

tracer, only minimal labeling from acetate was observed in uninfected cells (Fig. 5C). Infection

233

increased acetate derived atoms incorporated into VLCFAs (Fig. 5C). In WT-infected cells 30%

234

of C26:0 was labeled from 13C-acetate versus 60% labeling from glucose. Additionally, only 4

235

labeled atoms from two 2-carbon units were incorporated (Fig 5E). The subUL37x1 mutant virus

236

induced FA elongation from acetate, but to a lower level than WT (Fig. 5C and 5E). Together

237

our results reveal that pUL37x1 contributed to the ability of HCMV to induce FA elongation.

238
239

During infection, saturated VLCFAs are produced by ELOVL7 (12). HCMV increases the gene

240

and protein expression of ELOVL7 (12).We examined if HCMV-induced ELOVL7 expression

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/526228; this version posted January 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

241

requires pUL37x1. In HFF cells, WT virus induced ELOVL7 expression by 2 dpi (Fig. 6), similar

242

to our observations in MRC-5 primary fibroblasts (12). Mutant subUL37x1 virus also induced

243

ELOVL7 expression, however at a reduced level compared to WT (Fig. 6). This observation is

244

consistent with a reduced ability of the mutant virus to induced FA elongation and the production

245

of saturated VLCFAs.

246
247

The pUL37x1 dependent FA synthesis of VLCFAs was consistent with a decreased ability of the

248

subUL37x1 mutant virus to induce ELOVL7 protein expression. However, pUL37x1 may also

249

affect other aspects of FA metabolism. In addition to ELOVL7, HCMV increases the protein

250

expression of ACC-1 and its phosphorylated form that reduces its activity (33). We found that

251

subUL37x1 also induced both forms of ACC-1 over mock levels (Fig. 7). However, there was a

252

slight decrease in total ACC-1 levels compared to WT (Fig. 7), consistent with a decrease in FA

253

elongation. Since the mutant virus has a strong defect in elongation from glucose derived

254

carbons we examined if pUL37x1 influences the expression of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) that

255

converts citrate to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. At late, time points in replication ACLY protein

256

levels are slightly higher in infected cells (28). We found that ACLY levels were similar in WT

257

and subUL37x1 infected cells at 2-4 dpi (Fig. 7). Likewise, the ACSS2 enzyme that synthesizes

258

acetyl-CoA from acetate was unaffected by pUL37x1 (Fig. 8).

259
260

HCMV-induced metabolic remodeling requires AMPK. HCMV induces AMPK expression and

261

activity to increase glycolysis (21, 32). However, AMPK typically phosphorylates ACC-1 to

262

reduce its activity. We found that subUL37x1 induced the expression of the catalytic subunit of

263

AMPK, AMPKα, to WT-like levels suggesting that pUL37x1 is not acting through AMPK

264

mediated activity (Fig. 7). In conclusion, pUL37x1 is required for HCMV induced FA metabolism,

265

and induction of ACC-1 and ELOVL7 protein expression.

267

Viral remodeling of host lipidome requires pUL37x1

268

One function of FAs is to act as hydrophobic tails in lipids. Given our observations in Figs. 4-5,

269

we hypothesized that pUL37x1 is required for the synthesis of lipids with VLCFA tails. To test

270

this hypothesis, we developed LC-MS/MS lipidomic methods to examine phospholipids,

271

including those that contain C24 and C26 VLCFAs. We found that WT HCMV infection

272

dramatically increased phospholipids, especially those with VLCFA tails (PL-VLCFAs) (Fig. 9A,

273

left panel). Phosphatidylcholines (PC) were particularly increased (Fig. 9A-B). A previous

274

lipidomic study demonstrated that PC lipid species with long chain fatty acid tails were

275

increased by HCMV, while those with shorter chains decreased (31). Notably, this previous

276

analysis only examined lipids with a total of 30-42 carbons in their tail. Since the identity of any

277

individual tail was not reported it is unlikely that this analysis included >C26 VLCFAs. Using our

278

LC-MS/MS methods, we examined lipids with up to 48 total carbons in their tails. HCMV

279

induced the levels of several PC species with 44-48 carbons in their tails (Fig. 9B). Of the top

280

six PC species increased by HCMV, their levels were increased 17-32-fold (PC(48:7)) to 270-

281

14,00-fold (PC46:1)). In this case, the PC tails contain a total of 48 carbons and 7 double bonds

282

and 46 carbons and a single double bond, respectively. Since the number of carbons and

283

double bonds impart a large amount of diversity observed in lipidomes, we examined the tail

284

composition of these six PC species (Fig. 9D). All contained a >C26 tail. The greatest diversity

285

was observed in PC(44:1). We found evidence of four different PC(44:1) species: C18:1+C26:0,

286

C18:0+C26:1, C16:0+28:1, and C14:0+C30:1. The C30 tail was the longest one observed.

287
288

When we examined phospholipids from subUL37x1 infected cells, we observed a significant

289

decrease in lipid levels compared to WT-infected cells (Fig. 9A, right panel). The most notably

290

decreased lipids were the PC species that were greatly elevated by WT virus. All six of the PC

291

species discussed above were significantly decreased in mutant-virus infected cells compared

292

to WT (Fig. 9B). However, all species with the exception of PC(48:5) were elevated above the

293

uninfected level by the mutant virus (Fig. 9B). PC lipids are important for membranes, including

294

the virion envelope (31), suggesting that these lipids with VLCFA tails may be required for

295

HCMV induced membrane reorganization and for virion infectivity.

296
297

Some lipids were increased by subUL37x1 over WT levels (Fig. 9A). Several of these lipids

298

were phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. The mutant virus increased PS species by 4-fold or less

299

(Fig. 9C), which was vastly less than the increases observed for PC lipids in WT infected cells

300

(Fig. 9B). PS(36:2) was increased by only 1.5-fold. None contained a tail longer than C22 (Fig.

301

9D). Furthermore, none of these species were increased by WT virus and one—PS(36:2)—was

302

slightly reduced in WT-infected cells compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 9C). These observations

303

suggest that pUL37x1 suppresses their synthesis. Our lipidomics studies demonstrate that

304

HCMV remodels the host lipidome—increasing the abundance of phospholipids with VLCFA

305

tails—and that the magnitude of the lipidome shift requires pUL37x1.

306
307

HCMV activation of PERK is important for virus induced lipid metabolism (29). Both the level

308

and activation of PERK are induced by HCMV (29, 49-51).Given our observation that pUL37x1

309

is important for HCMV lipidome remodeling and the release of Ca2+ from the ER may induce a

310

stress response (52), we tested if pUL37x1 is required for HCMV-induced PERK protein levels.

311

At 3 dpi, PERK levels were reduced 2-fold in mutant virus infected cells compared to WT-

312

infected cells (Fig. 8). This observation suggests that pUL37x1 control of PERK may be

313

important for HCMV lipid remodeling that we observed. Overall, our data demonstrate that

314

pUL37x1 aids HCMV metabolic remodeling, particularly FA elongation and lipid metabolism.

Discussion:

317

Viral metabolic hijacking as a requirement for replication has been demonstrated in many

318

diverse viruses (reviewed in (18, 19, 43, 44, 53-56)). The virus-host metabolic interaction is

319

important to the infection of α- (13, 15), γ- (57-59), and β-herpesviruses (11, 12, 20). Like

320

HCMV, Kaposi’s sarcoma associated virus (KSHV) increases FA synthesis (60). Recently, the

321

related γ-herpesvirus—murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68)—replication was suppressed by

322

type I interferon induced limitations on fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism (61). These

323

studies, along with those for HCMV and HSV (described in (18, 43, 44)) demonstrate that virus-

324

metabolic interactions are essential to infection and can be targeted to limit replication.

325
326

HCMV globally remodeling of metabolism requires various host kinases (PERK (29), mTOR(12),

327

CaMKK (22), and AMPK(21, 32)) and transcription factors (SREBPs (12, 28, 33) and chREBP

328

(62)). Our previous observation that HCMV induced FA metabolism requires mTOR activity lead

329

to the finding that pUL38 is required for viral metabolic hijacking (12). We tested the hypothesis

330

that a second viral protein pUL37x1 is required for HCMV metabolic remodeling. The results

331

described here confirm our hypothesis that pUL37x1 also contributes to HCMV remodeling of

332

host metabolism. Similar to pUL38, we found that pUL37x1 contributes to HCMV induced FA

333

elongation and ELOVL7 expression (Fig. 4-6). Using our newly developed LC-MS/MS lipidomic

334

methods, we found that pUL37x1 is needed for HCMV alteration of lipid metabolism (Fig. 9).

335

During late stages of replication, pUL37x1 causes the accumulation of large vesicles (45).

336

These vesicles may form due to the pUL37x1 dependent FA elongation and lipid synthesis

337

described in this study. In addition to lipidome remodeling by HCMV, we found that pUL37x1 is

338

also necessary for the virus to fully induce PERK expression (Fig. 8). This observation is

339

consistent with the role of PERK in HCMV activation of lipogenesis (29). pUL37x1 may stimulate

340

PERK expression by inducing an ER-stress response triggered when ER stored Ca2+ is

341

released into the cytosol (52). Although at this time, we cannot rule out other possible

342

mechanisms for pUL37x1 to contribute to the lipidome changes we observed.

343
344

Interestingly, our lipidomic studies further revealed that pUL37x1 suppresses PS lipid levels. PS

345

lipids on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is an apoptotic signal (63, 64). Our

346

observations suggest that pUL37x1 is important in limiting the production of lipids associated

347

with apoptosis. Since the PS species that are suppressed by pUL37x1 do not contain saturated

348

VLCFAs produced by ELOVL7 (Fig. 9), it is likely that this function of pUL37x1 is independent of

349

its ability to enhance FA elongation. PS synthesis occurs at the mitochondria-associated ER

350

membrane in the same region where pUL37x1 is found (42) suggesting that it may act direction

351

on PS synthesis enzymes. However, it is currently unknown if pUL37x1 interacts directly with

352

the enzymes involved with PS synthesis. Importantly, our lipidomic observation suggest

353

pUL37x1 further blocks apoptotic limitations on infection by reducing PS synthesis.

354
355

HCMV replication increases the flow of carbons from glucose to fatty acid and lipid synthesis

356

(11, 24, 28, 29, 33, 62). We have previously shown that glucose is metabolized to support fatty

357

acid elongation (12). ELOVL7 is required for HCMV virus release and virion infectivity and

358

synthesizes saturated VLCFAs that become part of the virion lipidome. Here, we report the

359

robust increase of PL-VLCFAs by HCMV. Many of the PL-VLCFAs that were most dramatically

360

increased by HCMV were PC lipids. PC species with shorter tails are the second most abundant

361

PL in the HCMV virus envelope (31). Some of the PC-VLCFAs may be incorporated into the

362

virion. Previously, we demonstrated that the loss of saturated VLCFAs results in a disruption of

363

the infectivity per particle as measured by determining the ‘particle-to-infectious-unit ratio’ (12).

364

Viruses produced by ELOVL7-depleted cells were 4-8-fold less infectious; i.e. a particle-to-IU

365

ratio that of 400:1 to 800:1 compared to the WT ratio of 100:1 (12). SubUL37x1 viruses also

366

have a disruption in their particle-to-infectious-unit ratio (Fig. 2D). Our observations that

367

subUL37x1 virus has a disruption in FA elongation and lipid synthesis suggest that the loss of

368

infectivity in the mutant virus is due—at least in part—to disruption in the virus-host metabolism

369

interaction.

370
371

Our work establishes that pUL37x1 is an important player in virus-host metabolic interactions

372

required for HCMV infection. This work demonstrates that HCMV employs multiple

373

mechanisms—pUL37x1 as demonstrated here and pUL38 (12)—to ensure that the host

374

metabolic activity is rewired. Furthermore, our results show that HCMV infection dramatically

375

induces the accumulation of lipids with saturated VLCFAs and highlight the need to continue to

376

study the role of lipid metabolism during HCMV infection. Based on our lipidomic studies, along

377

with our metabolomic analyses (Fig. 3), we conclude that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV

378

metabolic remodeling but is not necessary to induce viral metabolic hijacking. As such pUL37x1

379

and pUL38 likely coordinate the virus-host metabolism interaction along with other viral factors.

380

Given the reliance of HCMV replication—and viruses in general—on metabolism it is important

381

to define the viral and host mechanisms required for metabolic remodeling. Our results further

382

support the critical functions of pUL37x1 in HCMV replication and provides a foundation for

383

future studies in defining virus-host metabolism interactions to build upon.

Materials and Methods.

389

Cells, Virus, and Experimental Setup

390

Human foreskin fibroblast cells (HFF) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, HEPES,

391

and pen/strep. Prior to infection cells were maintained at full confluence for 3 days in serum-

392

containing growth medium. Cells were switched to serum medium—DMEM, HEPES, and

393

pen/strep—the day before infections or mock-infection. Cells were infected with either wild-type

394

(WT) HCMV AD169 strain or subUL37x1, a UL37x1-null virus (36). Both WT and mutant viruses

395

were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Shenk. All virus stocks were made by pelleting virions from

396

the supernatant of infected cells through a 20% sorbitol. Viruses were resuspended in serum-

397

free DMEM medium and stored at -80 °C. Infectious virus titers were measured by the

398

visualizing cytopathic effect and the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) method. Since

399

subUL37x1 mutant virus shows minimal CPE, plaque identification was further confirmed by

400

immunofluorescent microscopy. In this case, cells on the TCID50 plate were fixed using

401

methanol and plaques were identified using an anti-pUL123 (IE1) monoclonal antibody (clone

402

1B12) followed by anti-mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibody. This method has similarly been

403

used to quantify a mutant HCMV virus that lacks the UL38 gene (12). Particle-to-IU ratio was

404

done using UL123-specific primers to measure viral DNA (65).

405
406

Metabolic tracer studies were done using 1,6-13C-glucose and fully labeled 1,2-13C-acetate

407

sodium salt from Cambridge Isotopes (CLM-2717 and CLM-440, respectively). Following a 1 h

408

infection period, cells were washed with warm PBS three times prior to the addition of serum-

409

free DMEM medium containing either 4.5 g/L glucose (25 mM) or 0.0035 g/L acetate (60 µM).

410

For 72 hpi samples, the labeling medium was replenished at 48 hpi.

413

Proteins were examined by Western blot from whole-cell lysates prepared in reducing SDS-

414

PAGE sample buffer (25 mM Tris pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, glycerol and

415

complete protease inhibitor [Roche]). SDS-PAGE was performed in tris-glycine SDS running

416

buffer using Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to Odyssey

417

nitrocellulose membrane (Li-COR) using a wet-transfer system at 4 ˚C. Western blots were

418

performed using 5% BSA in a Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% tween-20 (TBS-T) for blocking

419

and antibody incubation, except for anti-ELOVL7, anti-ATP citrate lyase and anti-PERK blots

420

which were performed using 3% milk in TBS-T. The following antibodies were used: mouse

421

monoclonal anti-pUL37x1 clone 4B6-B (36), mouse monoclonal anti-pUL36 clone 10C8 (66),

422

mouse monoclonal anti-pUL38 clone 8D6 (67), rabbit polyclonal anti-ELOVL7 (Sigma-Aldrich

423

SAB3500390), rabbit monoclonal anti-AMPKα (Cell Signaling 2603), rabbit polyclonal anti-ATP

424

citrate lyase (Thermo PA5-29497), rabbit polyclonal anti-ACC-1 (Cell Signaling 3662), rabbit

425

polyclonal phospho-ACC-1 Ser79 (Cell Signaling 3661), rabbit monoclonal anti-PERK (Cell

426

Signaling 3192), rabbit monoclonal anti-ACCS2 (Cell Signaling 3658), mouse monoclonal anti-

427

actin (LI-COR 929-42212), and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich T6199). Blots

428

using mouse monoclonal anti-HCMV, anti-actin and anti-tubulin antibodies were incubated for 1

429

h at room temperature. All others were done overnight at 4 ˚C. Quantification of Western blots

430

was done using a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system.

431
432

Metabolomics and Metabolite Analysis

433

All metabolite measurements were done using liquid-chromatography high resolution tandem

434

mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). At various times after infection, metabolic reactions were

435

rapidly quenched using cold 80% methanol and extracted as previously described (14, 23).

436

Extracted water-soluble metabolites were dried under nitrogen gas and resuspended in Optima

437

HPLC-grade water (Fisher Chemical) for reverse phase liquid chromatography or 50% methanol

438

for hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed

439

by four Thermo Scientific mass spectrometers: Quantum Ultra triple-quad, Quantum MAX triple-

440

quad, Exactive orbitrap and Q-Exactive Plus orbitrap. Metabolites were measured in both

441

positive and negative modes using reverse phase or HILIC separation (68, 69). Metabolites

442

were identified using mass spectral and UHPLC retention time data that were generated from

443

external standards. Peaks were examined, and metabolites identified using Compound

444

Discovery software (Thermo) and Metabolomic Analysis and Visualization Engine (MAVEN) (68,

445

70). Each metabolite was measured using two technical replicates per experiment. Each

446

metabolic experiment contained controls for determining ionization artifacts and sample

447

degradation. All chemical and solutions for metabolomics, fatty acid analysis, and lipidomics.

448

were HPCL or MS-grade.

449
450

Fatty Acid Analysis.

451

Fatty acid (FA) analyses were performed as previously described (12, 17). Briefly, lipids were

452

extracted from cells lysed using cold 50% methanol containing 0.05 M HCl. Cells were scraped

453

and transferred to glass vials. Lipids were chloroform extracted and FA tails were chemical

454

cleaved via saponification at 80 ˚C for 1h in a basic methanol buffer. The FAs were isolated

455

using hexane and dried down under nitrogen gas. Following a resuspension in 1:1:0.3

456

methanol:chloroform:water or 1:1:1 methanol:chloroform:isopropanol FAs were analyzed by

457

UHPLC and high-resolution mass spectrometry. FAs were examined using a Luna C8 reversed-

458

phase column (Phenomemex) and Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer (12) or a Q-Exactive

459

Plus mass spectrometer. In the latter case, FAs were separated using the same column but

460

utilized the same LC buffer solutions as used for lipid analysis described below. FA spectrums

461

were collected using 140,000 resolution (at 200 m/z). Experiments utilizing metabolic tracers

462

and FA labeling were additionally analyzed at 280,000 resolution. The data was analyzed and

463

FA levels quantified using MAVEN. For labeling experiments, the data were corrected for

naturally occurring carbon-13 using MATLAB (12). Each sample was measured using two

465

technical replicates per experiment.

466
467

Lipidomics and Lipid Analysis.

468

Similar to the FA analysis, lipids for lipidomics were extracted by 50% methanol and chloroform.

469

The chloroform was removed by drying the samples under nitrogen gas. Lipids were

470

resuspended in 1:1:1 methanol:chloroform:isopropanol. If needed, samples were stored under

471

nitrogen gas at -80 ˚C. Samples were normalized according to cell number: 125 µl of 1:1:1

472

resuspension solution per 100,000 cells. After resuspension, lipids were kept at 4 ˚C. Lipids

473

were separated via UHPLC using a Kinetex 2.6 µm C18 column (Phenomenex 00F-4462-AN) at

474

60 ˚C on a Vanquish system. Two solvents were used for UHPLC: solvent A (40:60

475

water:methanol plus 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (10:90

476

methanol:isopropanol plus 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid). UHPLC was

477

performed at 0.25 ml/min flow rate using the following gradient conditions: 75% solvent A / 25%

478

solvent B for 2 min; 35% A / 65% B for 2 min at curve value = 4; held at 35% A / 65% B for 1

479

min; 0% A / 100% B for 11 min at curve value = 4; and held at 0% A / 100% B for 4 mins. The

480

column was briefly washed and re-equilibrated before the next run. In total each run lasted 30

481

min. All lipids were examined using a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer operating in a data-

482

dependent Full MS/dd-MS2 TopN mode. MS1 data was collected at either 70,000 or 140,000

483

resolution at 200 m/z using AGC = 1e6 with transient times of 250 ms and 520 ms, respectively.

484

Spectrum were collected over a 200-1600 m/z mass range. MS2 spectrum were collected using

485

35,000 resoluton, AGC = 1e5 and 120 ms maximum injection time. Each sample was run twice,

486

using 10 µl for negative mode and 8 µl of sample for positive mode. In negative mode, a

487

normalized collision energy (NCE) value of 20 was used. In positive mode, the NCE value was

488

increased to 30. All lipids were ionized using a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The

489

following ESI parameters were used in negative mode: sheath gas flow rate = 44; auxiliary gas

flow rate = 14; sweep gas flow rate = 2; spray voltage = 3.3 kV; S-lens RF =76; aux gas temp

491

220 ˚C; and capillary temp = 320 ˚C. Similar settings were used in positive mode except the

492

spray voltage was increased to 3.5 kV and S-lens RF level was decreased to 65. The

493

instrument was calibrated weekly. For labeling experiments, the instrument was calibrated

494

immediately before the start of analysis. As with metabolites and FA, lipids were measured

495

using two technical replicates per experiment. Lipidomic data was analyzed using MAVEN and

496

LipidSearch (Thermo Scientific).
