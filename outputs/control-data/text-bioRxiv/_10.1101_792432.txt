Abstract

33

Background

34

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common, age-related, neurodegenerative disease that impairs a

35

person's ability to perform day to day activities. Diagnosing AD is difficult, especially in the early

36

stages, many individuals go undiagnosed partly due to the complex heterogeneity in disease

37

progression. This highlights a need for early prediction of the disease course to assist its treatment

38

and tailor therapy options to the disease progression rate. Recent developments in machine

39

learning techniques provide the potential to not only predict disease progression and trajectory of

40

AD but also to classify the disease into different etiological subtypes.

41

Methods and findings

42

The suggested work clusters participants in distinct and multifaceted progression subgroups of AD

43

and discusses an approach to predict the progression stage from baseline diagnosis. We observe

44

that the myriad of clinically reported symptoms summarized in the proposed AD progression space

45

corresponds directly to memory and cognitive measures, classically been used to monitor disease

46

onset and progression. The proposed work concludes notably accurate prediction of disease

47

progression after four years from the first 12 months of post-diagnosis clinical data (Area Under

patients respectively). Further, we explore the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks

51

to predict the trajectory of a patient’s progression.

52

Conclusion

53

The machine learning techniques presented in this study may assist providers with identifying

54

different progression rates and trajectories in the early stages of disease progression, hence

55

allowing for more efficient and unique care deliveries. With additional information about the

56

progression rate of AD at hand, providers may further individualize the treatment plans. The

57

predictive tests discussed in this study not only allow for early AD diagnosis but also facilitate the

58

characterization of distinct AD subtypes relating to trajectories of disease progression. These

59

findings are a crucial step forward to early disease detection. Additionally, models can be used to

60

design improved clinical trials for AD research.

Introduction

62

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and age-associated, chronic neurodegenerative disease

63

affecting a patient’s memory, intellectual skills, and other mental functions. It is the most common

64

form of dementia. Research has shown that AD is a clinically heterogeneous condition, showing

65

marked variations in terms of the symptoms constellations and disease progression rates. The

66

clinical signs and symptoms of AD show marked variability in terms of patients’ age, disease span,

67

progression velocity, and types of memory, cognition and depression-related features. After the

68

age of 65, the prevalence of dementia doubles every 5 years and is known to increase exponentially

69

after the age of 90 [1]. As dementia affects older people, with a growing life expectancy, it is

70

becoming a crucial medical problem [2].

71

With no preventive interventions known, AD progression is a major concern for health care

72

providers around the globe. Researchers have shown that AD pathological changes occur 20 years

73

or earlier before the actual disease symptoms manifest [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the absence of

74

any cure or disease-modifying treatment for this disabling disease, current treatment strategies are

75

limited to supportive, symptomatic care [9], [10]. Delay in the diagnosis of AD is often due to the

76

disease complexity with no clear identifying early diagnostic criteria available for providers [11].

77

A major challenge for AD prediction is the presence of inherent phenotypic diversity in the AD

78

population. Hence, the idea of personalized clinical care with individualized risk, progression, and

79

prediction related patient advice in AD is narrow. Additionally, there are ramifications in clinical

80

trial design when considering the high heterogeneity of disease manifestation and progression.

81

Predicting disease progression trajectories at an early stage is crucial for the design of clinical trials

82

and the development of disease-modifying treatment strategies.

83

For the treatments to be most effective, the AD therapy regimen must likely begin before the

84

notable downstream damage [12]. Simply put, early AD detection is a likely scenario to make the

85

greatest therapeutic gains. Patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at study

86

baseline are at a higher risk for progression to dementia, but not all patients end up developing AD

87

[13]. Research has been done to detect AD in patients with MCI or predict the early stage of AD

88

using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [14], [15], while others [16] have used psychometric and imaging

89

data for predicting the progression of dementia in patients with amnestic MCI. In an

90

implementation of a multiclass classifier using clinical and magnetic resonance (MR) brain images

91

to classify controls, MCI and AD patients, an accuracy of 79.8% was achieved [17]. Less research

92

has been done on using clinical data and predicting the AD progression rate. Faraz et. al. in [2,18]

93

used machine learning to classify Parkinson's disease (PD) patients into three different sub-

94

categories with highly predictable progression rates. They explored variations in onset and

95

progression velocity and observed clusters of the motor, cognitive and sleep disturbance related

96

features using the clinical data. We propose to extend their approach by applying it to the clinical

97

features of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. This study is in

98

continuation of the investigation regarding early AD onset and progression started in [19].

99

Goals and Contributions

100

This work was designed to cluster AD patients into distinct progression groups and to predict the

101

progression trajectory at an early baseline period. Dimensionality reduction via non-negative

102

matrix factorization (NMF) was used to define an ADNI progression space for the AD

103

summarizing myriad clinical measures across multiple time points. By applying unsupervised

104

machine learning, namely, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the extensive clinical

105

observations available in the ADNI dataset, we algorithmically parsed the progression space for

106

the AD into three clinical subtypes, defined as low, moderate (medium) and high disease

107

progressors. Our analysis found that clinically related symptoms corresponding to memory and

108

cognition make up the AD progression space. Clinical data collected at baseline (study entry), after

109

6 and 12 months is used to predict memory and sleep decline after 24 and 48 months from baseline.

110

We validated our models through five-fold cross-validation to obtain a robust prediction of

111

memberships into these progression subtypes. Along with traditional machine learning methods,

112

the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were also used to predict disease progression

113

rates (control, low, moderate, and high) after 24 and 48 months from baseline. The described

114

methodologies may lead a step forward towards the development of personalized clinical care and

115

counseling for patients, hopefully reducing AD therapy costs in the future. Also, we attempt to

116

describe the trajectory of AD progression via LSTM networks.

117

Further, we examine the reversion instances of AD captured in the constructed progression space,

118

the correlation of Apolipoprotein Eε4 (APOEε4) compound genotype with cognitive performance

119

and interactions between certain selective features associated with AD and the constructed

120

progression space later in the discussion section of the paper. These observations provide a

121

promising understanding of AD characteristics useful for devising novel disease modification

122

therapies. The proposed analysis provides a potential understanding towards restraining AD-

123

related symptoms and consequent deterioration in the life of the patients. We believe that the

124

advancement of the discussed prediction models has the potential to impact clinical decision

125

making and improve healthcare resource allocation in AD significantly.

Materials and Methods

128

The data analysis pipeline for this work was performed in Python 3.6 with the support of several

129

open-source libraries (TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, etc.). To facilitate replication and

130

expansion of this study, the Python code (including the entire data preprocessing and machine

Study design and participants

134

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database

135

(adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by

136

Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test

137

whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other

138

biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure

139

the progression of MCI and early AD. The ADNI dataset involves participants from over 50 sites

140

across North America and Canada. All participants and their study partners provided their consent

141

accepting their engagement for the data collection and the study protocols for ADNI were approved

142

by the Institutional Review Board. The ADNI study was carried out in phases; namely, ADNI 1

143

beginning in 2004, followed by ADNI GO in 2009 and ADNI 2 in 2011. These editions had

144

different participants and data collection procedures accounting for advancement in technologies.

146

The key eligibility criteria for the ADNI participants are highlighted in the supplementary section

147

S1 and further details on the protocol can be found on [20]. All participants went through

148

comprehensive functional, cognitive, and clinical assessments and provided a blood sample for

149

APOE genotyping at their baseline visit (study entry). These assessments and their status (control,

150

MCI, and AD) were then updated longitudinally at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 months. In our analysis,

151

predictions were made for each participant’s AD stage after 24 and 48 months using up to 12

152

months of clinical data. The study consisted of 247 observations (with 123 (49.79%) females, the

153

average age for all participants was 71.55 ± 6.79 years and 94.73% of them are of European

154

ancestry) for prediction at the 48th month and 453 observations (with 208 (45.92%) females, the

155

average age for all participants is 72.32 ± 7.13 years and 93.59% of them are of European ancestry)

156

for prediction at the 24th month. For observations corresponding to the 24th month, mean age is

157

72.84 ± 6.09, 71.61 ± 7.47 and 72.92 ± 8.11 for controls, MCI and dementia patients respectively

158

and for observations corresponding to the 48th month, the mean age is 72.17 ± 6.67, 71.36 ± 6.67

159

and 70.34 ± 7.42 for controls, MCI and dementia patients respectively.

We considered a total of 145 clinical variables (features) from the above-mentioned assessments

172

for our analysis. An elaborated list of features used in each test with their definition is given in the

173

supplementary materials (S2 Table).

174

Procedures and statistical analysis

175

Only the observations which had data recorded for all the considered tests were taken into account.

176

To construct the AD progression space, we used readings taken at baseline and on visits after 6

177

and 12 months from the baseline.

178

ADNI progression space and the prediction model

179

We leverage the temporal information present in the data to manage missing data recordings.

180

Missing values were imputed using linear interpolation based on the past visit readings for the

181

feature, therefore avoiding any influence of other observations during data imputations. After the

182

imputation, around 7% of the data was reduced. A descriptive plot with the number of observations

183

available for each feature before and after data imputation is given in the supplementary section

184

S4. One hot encoding was used for categorical variables whenever required. Scaling the continuous

185

features to a comparable range is necessary to avoid the influence of certain features over others.

186

Min-max normalization was used to retain the progressions since the ADNI dataset in

187

consideration is multimodal. Furthermore, min-max normalization didn’t affect categorical

188

features. Fig 1 shows our detailed workflow pipeline followed during the analysis. To reduce the

189

dimensionality of the dataset, NMF [30] (with a rank of 2) was used on 582 observations with

190

available data for baseline, visits after 6 and 12 months. We used NMF to deconstruct data into

191

two matrices, namely progression vectors and the progression indicators which correspond to the

192

latent vectors. Progression vectors were used to construct the 2-dimensional (2D) ADNI

193

progression space. This 2D space was then used to predict a participant's disease progression stage

194

after 24 and 48 months from baseline. Progression indicators map the features in the original

195

dataset to the progression space, via which we identified memory and cognitive decline as the two

196

dimensions of the modeled AD progression space. The relative position along the x- and the y-

197

axis represent worsening sleep or memory disorder.

Next, unsupervised clustering via GMM [31] was used to define the hidden subtypes within the

202

MCI and dementia patients. GMM is an expectation-maximization algorithm that maximizes the

203

likelihood of observing the data, given the underlying parameters of the distribution. Bayesian

204

information criterion (BIC) [32] was used to select the optimum number of underlying clusters for

205

the GMM. BIC is a maximum likelihood estimate which tries to select the best model among the

206

given set of candidates. In all the scenarios, three optimum number of clusters, defined as low,

207

moderate (medium) and high progression rates, were attained. After obtaining the AD progression

208

space and classifying MCI and dementia patients into different progression groups, the

209

performance of various supervised learning classifiers (namely ensemble random forest, linear

210

discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, adaptive boosting, nearest neighbors, logistic regression and

211

decision trees) were compared to predict a participant's progression stage after 24 and 48 months

212

from baseline using readings up to 12 months. Two models were built a) Model 1: predict

213

progression at 24th month after baseline by using baseline and first-year factors b) Model 2: predict

214

progression at 48th month after baseline by using baseline and first-year factors. Recurrent neural

215

network (RNN) architecture with LSTM was also used to predict the progression rates (control,

216

low, moderate and high) after 24 and 48 months from the baseline. The LSTM architecture had a

217

single LSTM bidirectional layer connected to a fully connected layer. Cross entropy loss function

218

was used at the output layer since it combines both logs of softmax and negative log-likelihood

219

loss functions. Optimal parameters for the models were found to be a single hidden layer with 128

220

hidden units with a learning rate of 0.001 and a dropout probability of 0.2. Since our dataset size

221

was limited in terms of the number of observations, 5 fold cross-validation (CV) was used to

222

evaluate the models. Among all the explored algorithms, a random forest classifier [33] gave the

223

best 5 fold CV accuracy. Hence, parameters for the random forest algorithm were fine-tuned using

224

grid search (4800 iterations) and 5 fold CV.

225

Model evaluation

226

Two different evaluation metrics were used for validating the clustering and prediction models.

227

Sensitivity and specificity are measures of the proportion of positives that are correctly identified

228

and negatives that are correctly identified respectively. The plot of sensitivity on the y-axis and 1-

229

specificity on the x-axis is called the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC of

230

ROC) curve with a greater value representing a better clustering model. AUC of ROC was used to

231

evaluate the clustering algorithms. Since this is a multiclass problem, one versus all approach was

232

used to calculate the AUC for each class. Next, 5 fold CV was used to judge the performance of

233

the proposed prediction models. The model was repeatedly trained on four parts and accuracy for

234

prediction was calculated on the fifth part with a random selection of partitions each time.

235

Trajectory prediction

236

NMF was used to project the observations in progression space. LSTM was used to predict the

237

position of patients in the progression space (trajectory prediction) at the 24th and 48th month using

238

data collected at baseline and after 6 and 12 months from baseline. For this study, five separate

239

projections were made using data until each visit and projections at the 24th and 48th month were

240

predicted. A bidirectional LSTM with 2 layers consisting of 32 hidden units was trained for 50

241

epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 10 for the same. Since the projection was

242

done in the 2D axis, the mean Euclidean distance was used to assess the performance of this model.

243

Only the features which were present for all the first three visits (baseline, m06 and m12 visits)

244

were considered for this study.

245

In the subsequent analysis, we study the share of different frequencies of APOEε4 variants for

246

each progression subtype since APOEε4 genotype is known to be closely related to AD risk [34].

247

Further, we discuss the reversion from AD to MCI and MCI to control stage captured in the

248

proposed progression space and correlation of a participant’s AD progression stage with their age,

249

educational status, APOEε4 gene, and other selective critical features.

250

Results

251

We have two progression indicator vectors in the reduced 2D ADNI progression space. The

252

features observed in the real data were correlated to the two axes of the progression space using

253

the magnitude of coefficients observed in the progression indicator vectors. A higher magnitude

254

corresponding to the first progression indicator vector will correlate the feature to the first axis and

255

similarly for the second axis.

257

The observed axis labels for the features using 2D NMF and GMM are presented in the

258

supplementary materials (S3 Table). Progression indicator i.e. coefficient matrix obtained from

259

the NMF was used to find out the hidden features that each of the two axes of the reduced space

260

represents (as depicted in section S5 of the supplementary information). Progression indicator

261

vectors represent latent features of the reduced progression space. Progression indicator

262

coefficients for each feature are plotted in Fig 2 and they are separated by drawing a line with

The progression rate of participants after the 24th and 48th months from the baseline were predicted

using the random forest classifier. It gave the best 5 fold cross-validation accuracy and area under

ROC curve results for all the cases. A comparison of different machine learning algorithms for the

296

prediction of progression after 24 and 48 months from the baseline is given in the supplementary

AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.97-0.99), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95) and 0.94

(95% CI, 0.91-0.97) for controls, high, low and moderate progression rates were observed

respectively. Prediction of progression at 48th month using baseline and 12 months of observations

301

yields AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90-0.94), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92-1.0), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92) and

320

Trajectory prediction using LSTM networks

321

Since no therapies in AD modification are known yet, predicting the trajectory of AD progression

322

at the early disease stage may offer a practical tool for refined clinical trials testing novel disease-

323

modifying strategies. Fig 7 represents the predicted and projected values in the AD progression

space for one of the participants.

NMF was used to project the data in progression space for each visit. The data from the first three

visits were used to predict the position of an observation in progression space for the next two

visits (visit at 48th and the 24th month). The mean Euclidean distance between projected and

331

predicted test observations in the projection space (quantifying the model performance) for the

332

48th and the 24th month are 0.00206 and 0.00164 respectively. The number of participants in each

333

cohort was limited, and not all the features were ascertained in all three (baseline, after 6 and 12

334

months) visits. These limitations affected the model performance.

Statistics of each progression subtype

336

The number of subjects with MCI, dementia, and controls in each subtype is shown in Table 2. Fig

337

8 shows their share percentage in each of the subtypes present after 24 months from baseline. As

338

expected the share of dementia patients is maximum in high progression rate. Low progression

339

rate has no dementia patient and contains only MCI patients. The moderate progression rate

340

subtype is dominated by MCI patients, which covers around 83% of the observation in that

341

subtype. A similar trend was observed after 48 months from baseline as well, as presented in the

342

supplementary section S8.

Percent share of APOEε4 variants for different subtypes

352

APOE has three common alleles, ε2, ε3, and ε4, of which the ε4 allele is closely associated with

353

increased risk of AD [34]. The distribution of APOEε4 alleles for each progression rate subtype is

354

shown in Fig 9 and S9 (in the supplementary material) after 24 and 48 months from the baseline,

355

respectively. This figure illustrates that the progression rate increases with the number of APOEε4

356

alleles. The absolute counts of 0, 1 and 2 occurrences of APOEε4 alleles in each progression rate

357

are listed in the supplementary section.

Discussion

364

In this section, we study the reversion of AD captured in the constructed progression space,

365

correlation between the APOEε4 genetic variants and participant’s progression state, effects of

366

aging on AD progression in controls, correlation of memory decline in AD patients with their

367

educational and occupational attainments and distribution of projected dimensions (memory

368

decline and cognitive decline) for each AD subtype, correlation between certain selective features

369

and AD progression rates in the following subsections. To conclude, we discuss some of the future

370

directions to extend the proposed study.

371

AD progression space and disease reversion

372

Since ADNI is a longitudinal study, the disease state of patients is reassessed every 12 months.

373

The clinical condition either deteriorated or stayed the same for most of the patients but in rare

374

instances, it reversed to a better state, i.e. some patients were observed moving from dementia to

375

MCI or MCI to control stage. These observations were plotted to assess the robustness of the

376

constructed progression space. Fig 10 plots these reversion cases at the 24th and 48th month. It can

377

be verified from these figures that patients moving from dementia to MCI fall in the intermediate

378

region between dementia and MCI (moderate progression rate region). Similarly, patients moving

379

from MCI to control lie in the intermediate progression region between them. Thus, the

380

progression space captures the reversion of the disease state.

386

AD progression states and APOEε4 allele counts

387

To understand the underlying biological patterns among patients in the progression space, we

388

plotted the distribution of the APOEε4 alleles. Fig 11 projects the observations with 0 and 2 counts

389

of APOEε4 variants on the AD progression space at 24th and 48th month. It is evident from these

390

figures that observations with a 0 count for the APOEε4 allele are concentrated towards the low

391

progression rate zone, whereas observations with 2 counts of APOEε4 allele are concentrated

392

towards the moderate and high progression rate zones. This observation further validates the

393

existing literature [35] and confirms a significant correlation between APOEε4 with cognitive

394

performance.

AD progression in controls and aging

400

In Fig 12, progression can also be seen in control observations at 24th and 48th month respectively,

401

attributed to a decline in normal cognition and memory with increasing age of the participants.

402

Since this decline is not severe, the observations do not lie in moderate or high progression rate

403

zones. A simple clustering of observations into two clusters shows a stark difference in the mean

404

age of the clusters. It is interesting to note that the mean age for the cluster which is relatively close

405

to the moderate progression rate zone is 74.59 years and the mean age of the cluster away from

406

this zone is 72.15 years. Similarly, for the 48th month, the mean age of the two clusters relatively

407

close and away from the moderate progression zone are 71.53 and 73.51 respectively (Fig 12).

413

Memory decline in AD patients and educational acquirements

414

To further discover a generalized trend in the AD progression rate, a polynomial curve was fitted

415

on the projected observations. BIC was used to find out the optimum degree of the fitting

416

polynomial, which was observed to be three. As seen in Fig 13 (Left), the cubic curve fits the data

417

in a linear fashion in the low progression region. However, it deviates slightly from this linear

418

behavior in high and moderate progression region. The magnitude of the slope of the linear curve

419

is 1.19 indicating a rapid memory decline as compared to cognitive. The slope of the progression

420

for 200 most and least educated observations is shown in Fig 13 (Right). The magnitude of slope

421

for the linear curve is 1.26 and 1.19 for highly educated and less educated patients respectively.

422

As the slope for highly educated patients is greater than the slope for less-educated patients, it can

423

be inferred that there is a relatively rapid decline in memory of patients with higher education. A

424

study on the links between education and memory decline in AD was carried out in [36]. The

425

research concluded that memory declined more rapidly in AD patients with higher educational and

426

occupational attainment. Thus, our results are further validated by these explorations done in the

427

previous research [36].

Distribution of memory and cognitive decline

435

Fig 14 shows the distribution of projected dimensions (memory decline and cognitive decline) for

436

each AD subtype after 24 and 48 months. In the progression space, along the positive direction of

437

the y-axis, the memory decline increases and along the negative direction of the x-axis the

438

cognitive decline increases. A low value on the x-axis indicates higher cognitive decline whereas

439

a high value on the y-axis indicates higher memory decline. High progression rate has highest

440

memory and cognitive decline, which goes on reducing with a reduction in progression rate.

(given in the supplementary section S10). Further, there is an increase in functional assessment

Limitations and future directions

460

In this work, we discussed the share of different APOEε4 genotype for each progression rate and

461

its correlation with cognitive performance. Future work should involve examining a few other

462

genes that also have been closely related to the progression of AD for studying their interactions

463

[37], [38]. As stated earlier in the paper, AD risk is associated with APOEε4 gene variants [34].

464

However, the progression space was constructed using only the time-variant clinical data.

465

Therefore, APOEε4 data were not considered during the construction of the projection space.

466

Moreover, the diagnosis of participants (control, MCI, AD) in the ADNI study is based on their

467

clinical examinations, having a sensitivity of 70.9-87.3% as compared to the neuropathologic

468

assessments, which are considered the gold standard for AD identification [39]. Hence, the

469

discussed progression models suffer from the implicit noise involved in the diagnosis of the study

470

participants. For future analysis, involving diagnosis with neuropathologic examinations may help

471

scale down the ambiguity involved in the true status of participants [38].

472

The present analysis can be continued in various directions. Since both AD and PD are

473

neurological diseases with AD primarily affecting memory advancing to influence motor functions

474

and PD impacting movement and coordination progressing to hinder memory and other cognitive

475

processes [40], [41], exploring to project ADNI with a PD dataset might explain features

476

responsible for PD progressing to AD or vice versa. Moreover, this study involved investigations

477

only considering the clinical data for exploring AD progressions. Integrating further information

478

such as neuroimaging or biomarker data may augment additional information in our analysis. Since

479

we relied on the CV to gauge the performance of our models, validating the study on separate AD

480

datasets [42], [43]. Finally, the discussed analysis only focused on predicting progression space in

26

481

AD. The proposed framework can be further adapted to study additional kinds of dementia such

482

as frontotemporal degenerations, Lewy body dementia, multi-infarct dementia, etc.

483

Conclusions

484

This work clusters participants in distinct progression stages of AD and discusses an approach to

485

predict the future rate of progression after the 24th and 48th months from baseline using longitudinal

486

clinical data. Predicting disease progression serves as a paramount challenge in the therapy and

487

cure of several elaborate diseases. This study is a step forward towards designing sophisticated

488

machine-learning paradigms to facilitate early diagnosis of AD progression. Predicting AD

489

progression rates would lead to better patient-specific attention by recognizing at an early stage

490

the patients with a swift rate of progression. The proposed disease progression and trajectory

491

prediction algorithms can help doctors and practitioners develop a methodical and organized

492

course for clinical tests, which can be much more concise and effective in detection. These

493

adaptations and modifications in clinics may help to diminish treatment and therapy costs for

494

dementia. Further, no healing treatments in AD modification exist, hence, the capability to

495

anticipate the trajectory of impending AD progression at the early stages of the disease is an

496

advancement towards uncovering novel treatments for AD modification. The proposed analysis

497

provides insights to inhibit or decelerate the progression of AD-related symptoms and subsequent

498

deterioration in the characteristics of life that are accompanied by the disease.
