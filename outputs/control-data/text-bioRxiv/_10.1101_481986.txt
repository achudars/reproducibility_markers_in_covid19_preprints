Abstract

28

By shaping gene expression profiles, small RNAs (sRNAs) enable bacteria to very

29

efficiently adapt to constant changes in their environment. To better understand how

30

Escherichia coli acclimatizes to changes in nutrient availability, we performed UV cross-

31

linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) to uncover sRNA-target interactions.

32

Strikingly, we uncovered hundreds of novel Hfq-mediated sRNA-target interactions at specific

33

growth stages, involving many novel 3’UTR-derived sRNAs and a plethora of sRNA-sRNA

34

interactions. We discovered sRNA-target interaction networks that play a role in adaptation to

35

changes in nutrient availability. We characterized a novel 3’UTR-derived sRNA (MdoR), which

36

is part of a regulatory cascade that enhances maltose uptake by (a) inactivating repressive

37

pathways that block the accumulation of maltose transporters and (b) by reducing the flux of

38

general porins to the outer membrane. Our work provides striking examples of how bacteria

39

utilize sRNAs to integrate multiple regulatory pathways to enhance nutrient stress adaptation.

40

Microorganisms are renowned for their ability to adapt to environmental changes by

41

rapidly rewiring their gene expression program. These responses are mediated through

42

integrated transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks. Control at the transcriptional level

43

dictates which genes are expressed (Balleza et al., 2009; Martínez-Antonio et al., 2008) and

44

is well-characterised in Escherichia coli. Post-transcriptional regulation is key for controlling

45

adaptive responses. By using riboregulators and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), cells can

46

efficiently integrate multiple pathways and incorporate additional signals into regulatory

47

circuits. E. coli employs many post-transcriptional regulators, including small regulatory RNAs

48

(sRNAs (Waters and Storz, 2009)), cis-acting RNAs (Kortmann and Narberhaus, 2012), and

49

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) (Holmqvist and Vogel, 2018). The sRNAs are the largest class

50

of bacterial regulators, which work in tandem with RBPs to regulate their RNA targets (Storz

51

et al., 2011; Waters and Storz, 2009). The base-pairing interactions are often mediated by

52

RNA chaperones such as Hfq and ProQ, which help to anneal or stabilize the sRNA and

53

sRNA-target duplex (Smirnov et al., 2017, 2016; Updegrove et al., 2016). Small RNAs can

54

repress or stimulate translation and transcription, as well as control mRNA stability

55

(Sedlyarova et al., 2016; Updegrove et al., 2016; Vogel and Luisi, 2011; Waters and Storz,

56

2009).

57

During growth in rich media, E. coli are exposed to continuously changing conditions,

58

such as fluctuations in nutrient availability, pH and osmolarity. Consequently, E. coli elicit

59

complex responses that result in physiological and behavioural changes such as envelope

60

composition remodelling, quorum sensing, nutrient scavenging, swarming and biofilm

61

formation. Even subtle changes in the growth conditions can trigger rapid adaptive responses.

62

Accordingly, each stage of the growth curve is characterised by different physiological states

63

driven by activation of different transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks. Moreover,

64

growth phase dependency of virulence and pathogenic behaviour has been demonstrated in

65

both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In some cases a particular growth stage is

66

non-permissive for the induction of virulence (Mäder et al., 2016; Mouali et al., 2018). Although

67

the exponential and stationary phases have been characterised in detail(Navarro Llorens et

68

al., 2010; Pletnev et al., 2015), little is known about the transition between these two phases.

69

During this transition, the cell population starts to scavenge alternative carbon sources, which

70

requires rapid remodelling of their transcriptome (Baev et al., 2006a, 2006b; Sezonov et al.,

71

2007).

72

To understand sRNA-mediated adaptive responses, detailed knowledge of the

73

underlying post-transcriptional circuits is required. In E. coli, hundreds of sRNAs have been

74

discovered, but only a fraction of these have been characterised. A key step to unravel the

75

roles of sRNAs in regulating adaptive responses is to identify their targets. To tackle this

76

globally, high-throughput methods have been developed that have uncovered a plethora of

sRNA-target interactions, many more than previously anticipated (Han et al., 2016; Hör et al.,

78

2018; Hör and Vogel, 2017; Lalaouna et al., 2015; Melamed et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2016).

79

To uncover sRNA-target RNA interaction dynamics that take place during the entry

80

into stationary phase, we applied UV cross-linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids

81

(CLASH) (Helwak et al., 2013; Kudla et al., 2011) on E. coli. First, we demonstrate that the

82

highly stringent purification steps make CLASH a robust method for direct mapping of Hfq-

83

mediated sRNA-target interactions in E. coli. This enabled us to significantly expand on the

84

sRNA-target interaction repertoire found by RNase E CLASH (Waters et al., 2016) and RIL-

85

seq (Melamed et al., 2016), and we show that Hfq CLASH can generate very reliable results.

86

Using CLASH we identified many potentially novel 3’UTR-derived sRNAs, confirming that this

87

class of sRNAs (Chao et al., 2012, 2017; Chao and Vogel, 2016; Miyakoshi et al., 2015a) is

88

highly prevalent.

89

Next, we focussed our analyses on interactions that were specifically recovered during

90

the transition phase where we identified a surprisingly large number of interactions, including

91

sRNA-sRNA interactions. Our data suggests that during the transition stage, ArcZ represses

92

CyaR levels, thereby indirectly controlling genes involving nutrient uptake during the transition

93

phase. We also characterized a novel 3’UTR-derived sRNA, which we refer to as MdoR (mal-

94

dependent OMP repressor). Unlike the majority of bacterial sRNAs, MdoR is transiently

95

expressed during the transition phase. We demonstrate that MdoR is a degradation

96

intermediate of the malG 3’UTR, the last transcript of the malEFG polycistron that encodes

97

components of the maltose transport system. We show that MdoR directly downregulates

98

several mRNAs encoding major porins and suppresses the envelope stress response

99

controlled by sE. We propose that MdoR is part of a regulatory network that, during the

100

transition phase, promotes accumulation of high affinity maltose transporters in the outer

101

membrane by repressing competing pathways.

Hfq CLASH in E. coli.

105

To unravel the post-transcriptional networks that underlie the transition between

106

exponential and stationary growth phases in E. coli, we performed CLASH (Helwak et al.,

107

2013; Kudla et al., 2011) using Hfq as bait (Figure 1A). To generate high quality Hfq CLASH

108

data made a number of improvements to the original protocol used for RNase E CLASH

(Waters et al., 2016).

Figure 1. Hfq CLASH experiments at different growth phases in E. coli.
(A) Overview of the critical experimental steps for obtaining the Hfq CLASH data. E. coli cells expressing
an HTF (His6-TEV-3xFLAG)-tagged Hfq(Jai J. Tree et al., 2014) were grown in LB and an equal number
of cells were harvested at different optical densities (OD600). Hfq binds to sRNA-target RNA duplexes,
and RNA ends that are in close proximity are ligated together. After removal of the protein, cDNA
libraries are prepared and sequenced. The single reads can be used to map Hfq-RNA interactions,
whereas the chimeric reads can be traced to sRNA-target interactions. (B) A growth curve of the
cultures used for the Hfq CLASH experiments, with OD600 at which cells were cross-linked indicated by
circles, and each growth stage is indicated above the plot. The results show the mean and standard
deviations of two biological replicates. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. (C) Cultures at
the same OD600 cross-linked and harvested by filtration were analysed by Hfq CLASH, RNA-seq and
Western blotting to detect Hfq.

Our Hfq CLASH protocol has several advantages over the related RIL-seq method

126

(see Materials and Methods and Discussion). As negative controls, replicate CLASH

127

experiments were performed on the untagged parental strain. When combined, the control

128

samples had ~10 times lower number of single-mapping reads and contained only 297 unique

129

chimeric reads, compared to the over 70.000 chimeras identified in the tagged Hfq data. This

130

demonstrates that the purification method produced very low background levels.

131

Cell samples from seven different optical densities were subjected to Hfq CLASH.

132

Based on the growth curve analysis shown in Figure 1B, we categorized OD600 densities 0.4

133

and 0.8 as exponential growth phase, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 as the transition phase from exponential to

134

stationary, and 3.0 and 4.0 as early stationary phase. To complement the CLASH data, RNA-

135

seq and Western blot analysis was performed on UV-irradiated cells to quantify steady state

136

RNA and Hfq protein levels, respectively (Figure 1C, Figure 1-figure supplement 1,

137

Supplementary Table 1). Western blot analyses revealed that Hfq levels gradually increased

138

during growth, however, when normalized to the levels of the chaperone GroEL, the increase

139

was modest (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-B). To determine the cross-linking efficiency, Hfq-

140

RNA complexes immobilized on nickel beads were radiolabelled, resolved on NuPAGE gels

141

and detected by autoradiography. The data show that the recovery of Hfq and radioactive

142

signal was comparable at each optical density studied (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C).

143

Comparison of normalized read counts of replicate CLASH and RNA-seq experiments showed

144

that the results were highly reproducible (Figure 1-figure supplement 2).

145
146

Hfq binds to the transcriptome in a growth-stage dependent manner.

147

Meta-analyses of the Hfq CLASH sequencing data revealed that the distribution of Hfq

148

binding across mRNAs was very similar at each growth stage. We observed the expected Hfq

149

enrichment at the 5’UTRs and at the 3’UTRs at each growth stage (see Figure 1-figure

150

supplement 3A and 3B for examples). After identifying significantly enriched Hfq binding peaks

151

(FDR <= 0.05; see Methods for details) we used the genomic coordinates of these peaks to

152

search for Hfq binding motifs in mRNAs. The most enriched k-mer included poly-U stretches

153

(Figure 1-figure supplement 3C) that resemble the poly-U tracts characteristic to Rho-

154

independent terminators found at the end of many bacterial transcripts (Wilson and Hippel,

155

1995), and confirms the motif uncovered in CLIP-seq studies in Salmonella (Holmqvist et al.,

156

2016).

highly.
(A) Heatmaps showing the changes in sRNA steady-states (Left) and Hfq cross-linking (Right) relative
to OD600 0.4. The clustered RNA-seq data were generated by k-means clustering using the foldchanges of normalized counts (log2 of transcripts per million (TPM)) relative to OD600 0.4. A blue shade
indicates a reduction in levels compared to OD600 0.4, whereas a dark orange shade indicates an
increase. The cluster assignment is indicated at the left, and the growth stage is indicated as OD600

increases at higher cell densities. The heatmap shows the changes in Pearson R correlation between
Hfq binding and RNA expression (normalised as in (a)), for sRNAs (top) and all transcripts (bottom).
(C) Assessment of correlation between changes in expression and Hfq binding profiles for individual
sRNAs. The y-axis shows the gene name of the sRNAs and the Pearson coefficient indicating the

174
175

Given the established role of Hfq in sRNA stabilization and mediating sRNA-target

176

interactions, it was logical to assume that changes in Hfq binding would also be reflected in

177

changes in sRNA steady-state levels. This would imply that the Hfq binding data would show

178

a strong correlation with the RNA-seq data. To test this, we compared the Hfq cross-linking

179

data to the RNA-seq data. K-means clustering of the normalized data revealed 7 different

180

patterns of changes in normalised read counts in the Hfq cross-linking and total RNA-seq data

181

(Figure 2A). Reminiscent of recent work performed in Salmonella (Chao et al., 2012), most

182

sRNAs in E. coli appear to be preferentially expressed when the cells reach the transition and

183

stationary phase (Figure 2A). However, much to our surprise, the Hfq cross-linking profile did

184

not always follow the same trend (Figure 2A-C, Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). Globally,

185

changes in sRNA expression did not correlate strongly with the Hfq-binding profile (and vice

186

versa) (Fig 2B-C). The correlation between changes in sRNA expression levels versus

187

changes in Hfq cross-linking was particularly poor at lower cell density (OD600 0.8: r = 0.10)

188

but gradually improved as the cells approach stationary phase (OD600 4.0 r =0.54; Figure 2B

189

and Figure 2-figure supplement 1A). A very similar result was obtained when comparing all

190

Hfq-bound RNAs, including mRNAs (Figure 2B and Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). Striking

191

examples are MgrR and PsrD, which showed a strong anti-correlation between Hfq CLASH

192

and RNA-seq counts (Figure 2C) In the case of PsrD, Hfq binding showed a modest increase

193

during the growth phase (Figure 2A; right heat map, cluster 6), whereas sRNA levels steadily

194

decreased (Figure 2A; left heat map; cluster 2). PsrD/SraB has also been shown to bind ProQ

195

(Smirnov et al., 2017), which may explain why its accumulation does not correlate with Hfq

196

binding. On the other side of the spectrum, SdsR showed a very high positive Pearson

197

correlation (Figure 2), suggesting that its accumulation heavily relies on Hfq binding.

198
199

We conclude that the dynamics of sRNA expression and binding to Hfq are not always
highly correlated.

originating from different coding regions were removed. (B) Venn diagram showing the intersection
between interactions from statistically filtered CLASH data from two biological replicates, recovered at
three main growth stages: exponential (OD600 0.4 and 0.8), transition (OD600 1.2, 1.8, 2.4) and early

data and Hfq CLASH data. (D) Same as in (B) but for sRNA-mRNA interactions. (E) (Top) Distribution
of chimeras representing statistically filtered interactions, which uniquely map to mRNA genes.
Overlapping fragments of the two individual parts of the chimeras were collapsed into single clusters
followed by generation of distribution plots. Each gene was divided in 100 bins the number of clusters
that map to each bin (hit density; y-axis) was calculated; (Bottom) For the distribution plot around the
AUG, the gene length was normalized in 601 bins (x-axis) 5’-end overlap (-300) before the start of the
coding sequence, and 300 bins downstream AUG (+300); the bins corresponding to the start codon are
indicated with a pink line. (F) Enriched motifs in chimeras that uniquely overlap 5’UTRs and 3’UTRs;

222
223

reads were identified using the hyb pipeline (Travis et al., 2013). To select RNA-RNA

224

interactions for further analysis, we applied a probabilistic analysis pipeline previously used

225

for the analysis of RNA-RNA interactions in human cells (Sharma et al., 2016) and adapted it

226

for the analyses of RNase E CLASH data (Waters et al., 2016). This pipeline tests the

227

likelihood that observed interactions could have formed spuriously. Strikingly, 87% of the

228

chimeric reads had a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of 0.05 or less, indicating that it is

229

highly unlikely that these interactions were generated by random ligation of RNA molecules.

230

These analyses demonstrate the robustness of Hfq CLASH protocol. A complete overview of

231

statistically significantly enriched chimeras is provided in Supplementary Table 2.2.

232

The distribution of combinations of transcript classes found in the statistically filtered

233

chimeric reads indicates the sRNA-mRNA interactions as the most frequent recovered Hfq-

234

mediated interaction type (~25%; Figure 3A). We suspect that this number might be higher,

235

as about 16% of the chimeras contained sRNA and fragments that mapped to intergenic

236

regions (Figure 3A). Manual inspection of several of these indicated that some of the intergenic

237

sequences were located near genes for which the UTRs were unannotated or short. The vast

238

majority of these interactions were growth stage-specific (Figure 3B). Hfq CLASH identified

239

almost 2000 sRNA-mRNA interactions (Figure 3C; Supplementary Table 2). Around 20% of

240

the interactions found with RIL-seq and ~21% (27 out of 126) of the experimentally verified

241

interactions present in sRNATarbase3 (Supplementary Table 2.7) were recovered. These

242

results suggest that while the CLASH data contained known and many novel interactions, the

243

analyses clearly were not exhaustive.

244

Meta-analysis revealed that the majority of interactions were identified in the transition

245

phase (Figure 3D) and that the mRNA fragments found in chimeric reads were strongly

246

enriched in 5’UTRs peaking near the translational start codon (Figure 3E). The latter is

247

consistent with the canonical mode of translational inhibition by sRNAs (Bouvier et al., 2008)

248

and demonstrates the robustness of the data. Enrichment was also found in 3’UTRs of mRNAs

249

(Figure 3F). Motif analyses revealed a distinct sequence preference in 5’UTR and 3’UTR

250

binding sites (Figure 3G, Supplementary Table 3). The motifs enriched in the 5’UTRs chimeric

251

fragments are more consistent with Hfq binding to Shine Dalgarno-like (ARN)n sequences (Jai

252

J. Tree et al., 2014) and U-tracts, whereas the 3’UTR-containing chimera consensus motif

corresponds to poly-U transcription termination sites (Figure 3F and Supplementary Table 3).

transcriptional regulation.

Hfq CLASH predicts sRNA-sRNA interactions as a widespread layer of post-

257

We also uncovered a surprisingly large number of sRNA-sRNA interactions

258

(Supplementary Table 2.4), many of which were uniquely found in our Hfq CLASH data (Figure

259

4A). Many interactions were growth-stage specific and the sRNA-sRNA networks show

260

extensive rewiring across the exponential, transition and stationary phases (Figure 4-figure

261

supplement 1). The sRNA-sRNA network is dominated by several abundant sRNAs that

262

appear to act as hubs that have many interacting partners: ChiX, Spot42 (spf), ArcZ and GcvB.

263

In many cases the experimentally-validated sRNA seed sequences were found in the chimeric

264

reads, for both established and novel interactions. For example, the vast majority of ArcZ

265

sRNA-sRNA chimeras contained the known and well conserved seed sequence (Figure 4B,

266

Figure 4-figure supplement 2).

267

The sRNA-sRNA chimeras containing CyaR fragments were of particular interest, as

268

the sRNA is primarily expressed during the transition from late exponential to stationary phase

269

(De Lay and Gottesman, 2009). In the case of CyaR, the known seed sequence (De Lay and

270

Gottesman, 2009; Papenfort et al., 2008) as well as a conserved ~25 nt fragment in the 5’

271

region was found in chimeras (Figure 4-C; Figure 4-figure supplement 2). Similar seed

272

sequences were identified in CLASH experiments using RNase E as a bait (Waters et al.,

273

2016), suggesting that this region represents a bona fide interaction site. Notably, we identified

274

ArcZ-CyaR chimeras containing the seed sequence from both sRNAs (Figure 4-figure

275

supplement 2) and these were detected specifically in the transition phase (Figure 4B-C),

276

suggesting that these sRNAs could influence each other’s activity. To validate these findings,

277

we used an E. coli plasmid-based assay that is routinely used to monitor sRNA-sRNA

278

interactions and expression of their target mRNAs (Melamed et al., 2016; Miyakoshi et al.,

279

2015b; Jai J. Tree et al., 2014). An advantage of this system is that each sRNA would be

280

uncoupled from the chromosomally encoded regulatory networks (that were thought to act

281

largely in a 1:1 stoichiometry) and to allow the specific effects of the sRNA-target RNA to be

282

assessed (Miyakoshi et al., 2015b). Importantly, these sRNAs were induced during early

283

exponential growth phase when the endogenous (processed) ArcZ and CyaR sRNAs are

284

detectable at only very low levels (Figure 4-figure supplement 3B, lanes 1, 2, 5, 7). The qPCR

285

data were subsequently normalized to the results obtained with a control scrambled sRNA to

286

calculate fold changes in expression levels. Since it is difficult to predict directly from the

287

CLASH data which sRNA in each pair acts as the decoy/sponge, we tested both directions.

288

ArcZ overexpression not only decreased the expression of its mRNA targets (tpx, sdaC) by

289

more than 50% but also that of CyaR (Figure 5D, panel I). Concomitantly, we observed a

290

substantial increase in CyaR targets nadE and yqaE (Figure 4D, panel I). CyaR

291

overexpression reduced the level of a direct mRNA target (nadE) by ~40% but it did not

292

significantly alter the level of ArcZ or ArcZ mRNA targets (tpx and sdaC; Figure 4D, panel II).

293

Notably, in this two-plasmid assay CyaR was not expressed at levels higher than ArcZ (Figure

294

4-figure supplement 3A, panel II). Therefore, it is possible that under the tested conditions the

295

CyaR overexpression was not sufficient to see an effect on ArcZ. We find this unlikely as

296

overexpression of CyaR also did not significantly affect endogenous ArcZ levels, which was

297

~80-fold less abundant than CyaR in this experiment (Figure 4-figure supplement 3A, panel

298

III). The qPCR results were also confirmed by Northern blot analyses (Figure 4-figure

299

supplement 3B, lanes 1-8), which also demonstrate that ArcZ processing was not affected

300

upon CyaR overexpression. These results suggest that the regulation is unidirectional,

301

reminiscent of what has been described Qrr3 in Vibrio harveyi (Feng et al., 2015). We

302

conclude that ArcZ acts as a CyaR anti-sRNA and can trigger its degradation.

303

To provide additional support for direct interactions between these sRNAs, we

304

generated mutations in the seed sequences of the sRNAs analysed here (Figure 4C). We

305

found that two G to C nucleotide substitutions in ArcZ was sufficient to disrupt ArcZ

306

downregulation of CyaR (Figure 4C-D; ArcZ 70-71 + CyaR). This regulation, however, was

307

almost fully restored when complementary mutations were introduced in the CyaR region

308

(Figure 5C-D; ArcZ 70-71 + CyaR 38-39). These data also demonstrate that it is very unlikely

309

that the observed changes in CyaR levels were be the result of Hfq redistribution due to over-

310

expression of ArcZ over-expression (Moon and Gottesman, 2011; Papenfort et al., 2009), as

311

the ArcZ seed mutant stably accumulated (and therefore effectively binds Hfq), but did not

312

affect CyaR levels. Unexpectedly, the wild-type ArcZ was also able to effectively suppress the

313

CyaR seed mutant (Figure 5D; ArcZ + CyaR 38-39), possibly because ArcZ can still form

314

stable base-pairing interactions with the CyaR mutant.

315
316

These results, together with the CLASH data, strongly support the notion that ArcZ and
CyaR base-pair in vivo, resulting in degradation of CyaR but not vice versa.

were ectopically co-expressed in E. coli and CyaR and CyaR 38-39 levels were quantified by RT-qPCR.

340

Two lines of evidence from our data indicate that many more mRNAs may be

341

harbouring sRNAs in their UTRs or be involved in base-pairing among themselves. First,

342

around 11% of the intermolecular chimeras mapped to mRNA-mRNA interactions (Figure 3A).

343

Secondly, we observed extensive binding of Hfq in 3’UTRs near transcriptional terminators

344

(Figure 1-figure supplement 3A, C), indicating that like in Salmonella, E. coli 3’UTRs may

345

harbour many functional sRNAs (Chao et al., 2017). We identified 122 3’UTR-containing

346

mRNA fragments that were involved in 550 interactions. Sixty-five of these interactions were

347

also identified in the RIL-seq S-chimeras data (Melamed et al., 2016). Eighteen of the 3’UTRs

348

were found as part of chimeras in the RIL-seq data, while 10 appeared stabilised upon

349

transient inactivation of RNase E performed in Salmonella (TIER-seq data (Chao et al., 2017));

350

Figure 6A, Supplementary Tables 2.5 and 2.6). Out of the 550 3’UTR-mRNA chimeric reads,

351

79 were 3’UTRs fused to 5’UTRs of mRNAs, suggesting that these may represent 3’UTR-

352

derived sRNAs that base-pair with 5’UTRs of mRNAs, a region frequently targeted by sRNAs

353

(Supplementary Table 2.6). Strikingly, 223 interactions contained 3’UTR fragment of cpxP, 51

354

of which were also found in the RIL-Seq data (Supplementary Table 2.6). In Salmonella cpxP

355

harbours the CpxQ sRNA (Chao and Vogel, 2016). Our analyses greatly increased the

356

number of potential CpxQ mRNA targets and show that the vast majority of CpxQ interactions

357

take place during the transition and stationary phases (Supplementary Table 2.6).

Figure 5. Hfq CLASH uncovers novel 3’UTR-derived sRNAs.
(A) Genes of which the 3’UTRs were found fused to mRNAs, were selected from the statistically filtered
CLASH data and RIL-seq S-chimera data. The RIL-seq RNA-RNA interaction set (Melamed et al., 2016)
S-chimeras for Log and Stationary phases of growth was filtered for the 3’UTR/EST3UTR annotations
on either orientation of the mRNA-mRNA pairs. Both were intersected with the set of mRNAs that were
predicted by TIER-seq studies (Chao et al., 2017) to harbour sRNAs that get released from 3’UTRs by
RNase E processing. Known (CpxQ, SdhX, MicL, GadF and SroC) and novel 3’UTR derived sRNAs
(MdoR, figL 3’UTR and YgaN) are indicated. (B) MdoR is transiently expressed during the transition
from exponential to stationary phase. RybB was probed as a sRNA positive control and 5S rRNA as
the loading control. See Figure 6-figure supplement 1 for full-size blots. Source data are provided as a
Source Data file. (C) Genome-browser snapshots of several regions containing candidate sRNAs for
optical densities at which the RNA steady-state was maximal for each candidate; the candidate names
and OD600 are indicated at the left side of the y-axes; the y-axis shows the normalized reads (RPM:
reads per million); red: RPM of RNA steady-states from an RNA-seq experiment, blue: Hfq cross-linking
from a CLASH experiment; black: unique chimeric reads found in this region.

375
376

We identified six mRNA 3’UTRs that were uncovered in all three (Hfq CLASH, RIL-seq

377

and TIER-seq) datasets (Figure 5A), suggesting these likely contain sRNAs released from

378

3’UTRs by RNase E processing. Northern blot analyses confirmed the presence of sRNAs in

379

malG and gadE 3’UTRs (Figure 5B, Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). The latter was also

380

recently experimentally confirmed in the RIL-seq data and was annotated as GadF (Melamed

381

et al., 2016). Furthermore, significant Hfq cross-linking could be detected in the 3’UTRs of

382

these transcripts (Figure 5C). In addition, we could show that the 3’UTR of ygaM, which was

383

found in chimeric reads in our data, also likely harbours a ~100 nt sRNA (hereafter referred to

384

as YgaN; Figure 5-figure supplement 1A) and robust Hfq cross-linking could be detected in

385

this region (Figure 5B-C).

386

To substantiate these results, we analysed RNA-seq data from a study that used

387

Terminator 5’-Phosphate Dependent Exonuclease (TEX) to map transcription start sites

388

(TSS) of coding and non-coding RNAs in E. coli (Thomason et al., 2015). TEX degrades

389

processed transcripts that have 5’ monophosphates, but not primary transcripts with 5’

390

triphosphates. Therefore, these data enabled us to determine whether (a) a TSS was detected

391

in the 3’UTR and whether these were generated by RNase-dependent processing (TEX

392

sensitive) or originated from an independent promoter (TEX insensitive). For 47 of the 122

393

predicted 3’UTR-derived sRNAs TEX data provided strong evidence for the presence of

394

sRNAs (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B-C, Supplementary Table 2.5 and see Data and Code

395

availability). The TEX data indicate that ygaM has (at least) two promoters, one of which is

396

located near the 3’ end of the gene that we predict is the TSS for YgaN (Figure 5-figure

397

supplement 1B). Furthermore, we speculate that YgaN is processed by RNases. This is based

398

on the observation that multiple YgaN species were detected in the Northern blot analyses

399

(Figure 5-figure supplement 1A) and the TEX data indicate that shorter YgaN RNAs are

400

sensitive to TEX treatment (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B).

401

The majority of the sRNAs we analysed are more abundant at higher cell densities

402

(including GadF, YgaN and RybB; see Figure 5B, 2A). In sharp contrast, 3’ UTR malG sRNA

403

was expressed very transiently and peaked at an OD600 of 1.8 (Figure 5B). We envisage that

404

the particularly transient expression of this sRNA may be correlated with a role in the adaptive

405

responses triggered during transition from exponential to stationary phases of growth. We

406

named it MdoR (mal-dependent OMP repressor) and characterized it in detail.

407

The steady state levels of malG and malEFG transcripts recapitulate the same

408

expression profile: both peak at OD600 of 1.8 and drop to very low levels at OD600 2.4 (Figure

409

6A). Additionally, we identified shorter malG 3’UTR-containing fragments of intermediate

410

length between malG and MdoR that could be degradation intermediates (Figure 6B). The

411

detection of these intermediate species suggests that the malEFG primary transcript is

412

undergoing serial ribonucleolytic cleavage steps.

413

MdoR is a 104 nt sRNA that contains part of the malG coding sequence, including the

414

stop codon and the Rho-independent terminator (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-B). Two lines

415

of evidence suggest that MdoR is generated via endonucleolytic cleavage: RNase E cleavage

416

was detected in the 3’UTR of malG in the Salmonella TIER-seq data (Chao et al., 2017).

417

Secondly, the TEX RNA-seq data supported the existence of a short RNA in the same region

418

that has a 5’ monophosphate (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B-C). We verified the MdoR TEX

419

data by Northern blot analyses (Figure 6C). Consistent with the TEX RNA-seq data, MdoR

420

could not be detected in our RNA samples treated with TEX (Figure 6C, lanes 2 and 4),

421

confirming it bears a 5’ monophosphate. Like MdoR, the positive control CpxQ (Chao and

422

Vogel, 2016) was degraded in the presence of TEX (Figure 6C). In contrast, RybB, an sRNA

423

with a 5’ triphosphate transcribed from an independent promoter (Johansen et al., 2006;

424

Papenfort et al., 2006) was a poor substrate for the exonuclease (Figure 6C).

The text on the right of the blot indicates the phosphorylation state of the 5’-termini for each sRNA.

439
440

TEX treatment of the total RNA also reduced the levels of the longer intermediate

441

species as well as the full-length malG. These data support a mechanism by which the full-

442

length polycistronic RNA undergoes decay that is initiated at a site in the upstream malEFG

443

region. The distal gene malE is clipped off by the degradosome and selectively stabilized,

444

allowing it to be expressed at higher levels than other members of the operon (Newbury et al.,

445

1987). The malG 3’UTR, however, would be less susceptible to degradation as it is stabilized

446

by Hfq binding.

447
448

MdoR directly regulates the expression of major outer membrane porins and represses

449

the envelope stress response pathway

450

The MdoR chimeras frequently contained 5’UTR fragments of two mRNAs encoding

451

major porins, ompC and ompA (Figure 7A-C), which were also significantly enriched in the

452

RIL-seq data (Figure 8B). The Hfq CLASH data, however, also contained MdoR fragments

453

fused to a cis-encoded sRNA, OhsC (Figure 7B-C), suggesting that either MdoR controls its

454

expression by sponging/degradation, or vice versa). The most abundant and favourable

455

interactions of MdoR with mRNAs (ompC and ompA) appear to be utilizing roughly the same

456

region of the malG 3’UTR for base-pairing (Figure 7C), suggesting that the corresponding site

457

on the predicted sRNA may be a main, functional seed. The predicted interaction between

458

MdoR and ompC is unusually long and consists of two stems interrupted by a bulge,

459

suggesting that these two RNAs form a stable complex. Conservation analyses and in silico

460

target predictions (CopraRNA (Wright et al., 2014, 2013)) indicate that the seed sequence

461

predicted by CLASH is relatively well-conserved (Figure 7-figure supplement 1A), and could

462

be utilized for the regulation of multiple targets (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B).

463

To verify the MdoR CLASH data we pulse-overexpressed the sRNA from a plasmid-

464

borne arabinose inducible promoter followed by RNA sequencing (Figure 7D-E). To minimize

465

secondary changes in gene expression, cells were harvested after only 15 minutes of MdoR

466

induction. Note that induction was performed at OD600 = 0.4, when endogenous levels of MdoR

467

are very low. As a control we used cells harbouring an empty vector. Differential gene

468

expression analysis (DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014)), identified ~20 transcripts that were

469

significantly enriched in the control data compared to the MdoR overexpression data (Figure

470

7E-F; Supplementary Table 4). Thus, these transcripts are likely downregulated by MdoR in

471

vivo. This set of transcripts included the sigma factor rpoE (sE), which plays an important role

472

in controlling gene expression during stress responses, including envelope stress (Alba and

473

Gross, 2004; Bossi et al., 2008; De Las Peñas et al., 1997; Rhodius et al., 2006). The

observed reduction in mRNA levels of the anti-sE protein RseA can be explained by the fact

499
500

Intriguingly, MdoR overexpression also reduced the levels of sRNAs RyeA and MicA,

501

the latter of which depends on sE for its expression (Udekwu and Wagner, 2007). In

502

Salmonella, MicA downregulates LamB, a high affinity maltose/maltodextrin transporter (Bossi

503

and Figueroa-Bossi, 2007). Fragments of three mRNAs (ompC, ompA and ptsH) that were

504

found in MdoR chimeric reads were also differentially expressed in the MdoR overexpression

505

RNA-seq data, providing strong evidence that these are direct MdoR targets.

506

All the available data suggest that MdoR is part of a mixed coherent feed forward

507

regulatory network (FFL) that enhances the uptake of maltose/maltodextrin by maltose

508

transporters (see Discussion). By base-pairing with the 5’UTRs of the mRNAs it firstly reduces

509

the flux of the more general porins such as OmpC and OmpA to the outer membrane.

510

Secondly, we propose that MdoR stimulates the accumulation of the high-affinity maltose porin

511

LamB in the OMP by suppressing the inhibitory sE pathway and MicA. To further test this

512

model, we performed additional validation experiments. First, we confirmed the DESeq2

513

results for a number of the regulated genes (ompC, rpoE, micA and ryeA) by RT-qPCR (Figure

514

7F). We included an MdoR mutant in which seed sequence in stem 1 was changed into its

515

complementary sequence (Figure 8-figure supplement 1A). As control we also included the

516

regulatory effect on target expression (Figure 7F).

519

To demonstrate direct target regulation in vivo, we employed a well-established

520

reporter system where an sRNA is co-expressed with a construct containing the mRNA target

521

region fused to the coding sequence of superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP)

522

(Corcoran et al., 2012; Urban and Vogel, 2007) (Figure 8-figure supplement 1B). Fusions for

523

ompC, ompA and σE were constructed, but only the OmpC and OmpA-sfGFP reporters

524

produced stable fusions that could be analysed. We also included an MdoR sRNA seed

525

sequence mutant (MdoR SM) and an ompC mutant containing compensatory mutations

526

(OmpC SM; Figure 8-figure supplement 1A). Unfortunately, our OmpA-GFP reporter construct

527

that contained compensatory mutations in the target region did not generate a stable fusion.

528

Therefore, we were unable to use this reporter system to verify the MdoR-ompA interaction.

529

As positive controls we used the MicC and RybB sRNAs as they both regulate E. coli ompC

530

expression (Chen et al., 2004; Gogol et al., 2011). Fluorescence measurements confirmed

531

that levels of OmpC-sfGFP and OmpA-sfGFP fusions were significantly lower in cells

532

expressing MdoR (Figure 8-figure supplement 1C). Importantly, MdoR overexpression did not

533

change the expression of the GFP reporter itself (Figure 8-figure supplement 1C). Mutating

534

the MdoR seed region largely restored OmpA- and OmpC-sfGFP reporter levels to the levels

535

of the no sRNA negative control. The MdoR SM mutant was still able to partially suppress the

536

expression of the OmpC SM-sfGFP mutant, suggesting that base-pairing interactions between

537

these two mutants is less stable compared to the wild-type (Figure 8-figure supplement 1C).

538

The wild-type MdoR was also able to partially suppress the expression of the ompC SM

539

mutant. We suggest that the predicted base-pairing interactions between MdoR and ompC in

540

the second stem (Figure 8-figure supplement 1A) might be sufficient to partially suppress

541

ompC expression. Regardless, the data strongly imply that MdoR directly regulates ompC

542

expression.

543

To determine whether the changes in fluorescence signal correlate with changes in

544

reporter mRNA levels, we measured the expression of the GFP reporters by RT-qPCR. The

545

results were essentially identical to the GFP fluorescence measurements (Figure 8A);

546

Overexpression of the wild-type MdoR, but not seed mutant, reduced ompC-sfGFP mRNA

547

levels. The ompC seed mutation (SM) did not fully disrupt regulation by wild-type MdoR.

548

However, the MdoR mutant containing compensatory mutations (SM mutant) was able to

549

much better suppress the ompC SM mRNA levels, consistent with the idea that base-pairing

550

was (largely) restored. Next, we performed polysome profiling experiments to assess the level

551

of ompC translation upon overexpression of MdoR. Although MdoR overexpression did not

552

noticeably affect 70S and polysome levels (Figure 8-figure supplement 2A), we observed a

553

significant (~37%) reduction of ompC mRNA in the polysomal fractions, relative to the upper

554

fractions (Figure 8-figure supplement 2B). We conclude that MdoR can regulate ompC

Endogenous MdoR and malG expression is induced during growth on maltose, and ompC levels are

MdoR enhances maltoporin expression during maltose fermentation

580

To further substantiate these results, we next switched to a more controlled system to

581

investigate the effect of endogenous MdoR on its targets. To determine whether MdoR has a

582

role in adaptation to maltose-metabolising conditions, single overnight cultures grown in

583

glucose were split and (re)inoculated in fresh medium containing either glucose or maltose as

584

the sole carbon sources, and expression of several mal regulon genes and MdoR targets were

585

quantified. We show that MdoR and its parental transcript malG are almost undetectable

586

during growth in glucose, and highly expressed during growth in maltose (~35-fold increase,

587

Figure 8B). This is consistent with catabolite repression of the mal regulon by glucose, and its

588

induction my maltose (Boos and Shuman, 1998). Intriguingly, we observed that ompC mRNA

589

levels are overall significantly lower during growth in maltose, compared to glucose (Figure

590

8B). This suggests that porin expression is also regulated by nutrient source in E. coli.

591

Similarly, MicA, a repressor of LamB synthesis, has reduced levels in maltose compared to

592

glucose (Figure 8B). We next mutated the entire seed sequence of the chromosomal copy of

593

MdoR (both stem 1 and 2; Figure 8-figure supplement 1A) in the chromosomal context, to

594

completely disrupt base-pairing with ompC mRNA. Notably, the fully-processed mutant MdoR

595

sRNA is less abundant than the wild-type (Figure 9C) and longer (unprocessed) fragments

596

that contain upstream malG regions could be readily detected (Figure 9E). We speculate that

597

the mutation in the upstream MdoR sequence might have affected RNase E recruitment or

598

cleavage, impairing MdoR processing. The MdoR mutant strain also accumulated significantly

599

higher levels of MicA (Figure 8D) and less lamB. Levels of ompC mRNA levels were also

a similar increase was also observed in glucose.

Collectively, the data suggest a role for MdoR in enhancing the uptake of maltose when
more favourable carbon sources become limiting.

Discussion
Microorganisms need to constantly adapt their transcriptional program to counteract

608

changes in their environment, such as changes in temperature, cell density and nutrient

609

availability. In bacteria, small RNAs (sRNAs) and their associated RNA-binding proteins are

610

believed to play a key role in this process. By controlling translation and degradation rates of

611

mRNAs upon stress imposition (Holmqvist and Wagner, 2017; Nitzan et al., 2017; Shimoni et

612

al., 2007), they can regulate the kinetics of gene expression as well as suppress noisy signals

613

(Beisel and Storz, 2011), enabling organisms to more efficiently adapt to environmental

614

changes. A major challenge for bacteria is the transition from exponential growth to stationary

615

phase, when the most favourable nutrients become limiting. To counteract this challenge, cells

616

need to rapidly remodel their transcriptome to be able to efficiently metabolize alternative

617

carbon sources. This transition is very dynamic and involves activation and repression of

618

diverse metabolic pathways. However, it is unclear to what degree sRNAs contribute to this

619

transition. The most useful piece of information would be to know what sRNAs are upregulated

620

during this transition phase and to identify their RNA targets. This would help to uncover the

621

regulatory networks that govern this adaptation, as well as provide a starting point for more

622

detailed functional analyses on sRNAs predicted to play a key role in this process. For this

623

purpose, we performed UV cross-linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH (Kudla

624

et al., 2011)) to unravel the sRNA-target interactions during this transition. Using Hfq as a bait

625

we uncovered thousands of unique sRNA-target interactions. Our data are consistent with

626

previously published work (Melamed et al., 2016; Waters et al., 2016) but we also identified

627

almost 1700 novel sRNA-mRNA interactions and over 100 novel sRNA-sRNA interactions.

628

We experimentally validated several of the interactions found in our CLASH findings. We

629

identified functional sRNA-sRNA interactions and describe a novel 3’UTR derived sRNA that

630

plays a role in enhancing uptake of an alternative carbon source during the transition to

631

stationary phase.

Increased production of LamB exerts additional pressure on the OM assembly machinery. This
extracytoplasmic stress, is suppressed by sE activation, that controls the expression of stressthese conditions for two reasons: its unbalanced activation has precarious effects on the cell, and would
produce high amounts of MicA, that would ultimately repress LamB production. For these reasons,
MdoR regulation includes a regulatory arm that mitigates excessive sE response through MdoR
of omp mRNAs, which indirectly relieves envelope stress. (B) sRNA-target networks regulating
peptide/amino acids and maltose/maltodextrin uptake. Boxed are the key transcription factors, sRNAs
are in bold and italicized names are mRNA targets. CRP-cAMP induces expression of CyaR, which is
repressed by ArcZ, specifically during the transition phase, a regulatory circuit that connects multiple
pathways related to the onset of stationary phase and biofilm formation to quorum sensing, cellular
adherence and the nutritional state of the cell. MalT transcribes lamB and, via malEFG transcription,
promotes MdoR accumulation. MdoR indirectly promotes LamB synthesis by repressing the opposing
sE pathway and its sRNA, MicA. Thus, MalT and MdoR jointly promote lamB expression, forming a
mixed coherent FFL.

Hfq CLASH

663

Our S. cerevisiae Cross-linking and cDNA analysis data (CRAC; (Granneman et al.,

664

2009)) showed that a percentage of the cDNAs were formed by intermolecular ligations of two

665

RNA fragments (chimeras) known to base pair in vivo (Kudla et al., 2011). These findings

666

prompted us to develop a refined protocol to enrich for sRNA-target chimeric reads using Hfq

667

as an obvious bait. The initial Hfq UV cross-linking data (CRAC; (Tree et al., 2014)) did not

668

yield sufficiently high numbers of chimeric reads to extract new biological insights. In line with

669

observations from other groups (Bandyra et al., 2012; Bruce et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2005),

670

it was proposed that duplexes formed by Hfq are rapidly transferred to the RNA degradosome

671

(Bandyra et al., 2012; Bruce et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2005). This can cause an extensive

672

reduction in the likelihood of capturing sRNA-target interactions with Hfq using CLASH

673

(Waters et al., 2016). However, a recent study demonstrated that Hfq can be used effectively

674

as a bait to enrich for sRNA-target duplexes under lower-stringency purification conditions

675

suggesting that sRNA-mRNA duplexes are sufficiently stable on Hfq during purification

676

(Melamed et al., 2016). This encouraged us to further optimize the CLASH method. We made

677

a number changes to the protocol that, when combined, enabled us to recover a large number

678

of sRNA-target chimeric reads (detailed in Materials and Methods). We shortened various

679

incubation steps to minimize RNA degradation and performed very long and stringent washes

680

after bead incubation steps to remove background binding of non-specific proteins and RNAs.

681

Crucially, we very carefully controlled the RNase digestion step that is used to trim the cross-

682

linked RNAs prior to making cDNA libraries, ensuring the recovery of longer chimeric RNA

683

fragments. The resulting cDNA libraries were paired-end sequenced to increase the recovery

684

of chimeric reads with high mapping scores from the raw sequencing data. These

685

modifications led to a substantial improvement in the recovery of chimeric reads (9.5%

686

compared to 0.001%. 0.71% were intermolecular chimeras).

687

Both RIL-seq and Hfq CLASH have advantages and disadvantages, but they are highly

688

complementary approaches. A major strength of CLASH, however, is that the purification

689

steps are performed under highly stringent and denaturing conditions. During the first FLAG

690

affinity purification steps the beads are extensively washed with high salt buffers and the

691

second Nickel affinity purification step is done under completely denaturing conditions (6M

692

guanidium hydrochloride). These stringent purification steps enable can significantly reduce

693

noise by strongly enriching for RNAs covalently cross-linked to the bait protein (Granneman

694

et al., 2009). Indeed, we show that Hfq CLASH can generate high quality RNA-RNA interaction

695

data with very low background: Only a few hundred chimeric reads were found in control

696

datasets, compared to the over 70.000 that co-purified with Hfq. The RIL-seq library

697

preparation protocol uses an rRNA depletion step to remove contaminating ribosomal RNA,

698

whereas for Hfq CLASH this is not necessary. Our library preparation protocol also includes

699

the use of random nucleotides in adapter sequences to remove potential PCR duplicates

700

(“collapsing”) from the data.

701

The very stringent purification conditions used in CLASH could, in some cases also be

702

a disadvantage as it completely relies on UV cross-linking to isolate directly bound RNAs. In

703

cases where protein-RNA cross-linking efficiencies are low (for example proteins that only

704

recognize double-stranded RNA), RIL-seq may be a better approach as it does not completely

705

rely on UV cross-linking (Melamed et al., 2016).

706

A large number of interactions were unique to both RIL-seq and Hfq CLASH datasets,

707

which we believe can be explained by a number of technical and experimental factors. The

708

denaturing purification conditions used with CLASH completely disrupts the Hfq hexamer

709

((Tree et al., 2014) and this work) and therefore during the adapter ligation reactions the RNA

710

ends are likely more accessible for ligation. In support of this, in the RIL-Seq data, the sRNAs

711

are mostly found in the second half of the chimeras (Melamed et al., 2016), in the Hfq CLASH

712

data we see sRNAs fragments roughly equally distributed in both sides (45% in left fragment

713

and 55% in right fragment). Indeed, it was proposed that in RIL-seq the 3’ end of the sRNA is

714

buried in the hexamer and therefore not always accessible for ligation (Melamed et al., 2016).

715

For the RIL-seq experiments, the authors harvested the cells at 4ºC and they

716

resuspend the cells in ice-cold PBS prior to UV irradiation (Melamed et al., 2018, 2016), which

717

results in a cold-shock that can affect the sRNA-interactome as well as sRNA stability. We

several seconds using the Vari-X-linker we recently developed (van Nues et al., 2017). We

720

use filtration devices to rapidly harvest our cells (less than 30 seconds) and the filtered cells

721

are subsequently stored at -80ºC. We previously showed that filtration combined with short

722

UV cross-linking times dramatically reduces noise introduced by the activation of the DNA

723

damage response and significantly increased the recovery of short-lived RNA species (van

724

Nues et al., 2017). We speculate that many of the interactions that are unique to our Hfq

725

CLASH data represent short-lived RNA duplexes that are preferentially captured with our UV

726

cross-linking and rapid cell filtration setup.

727
728

The 3’UTR derived sRNA MdoR functions in a mixed feed forward loop by suppressing

729

opposing pathways

730

We found a large number of chimeras that represent over a hundred distinct

731

intermolecular interactions between 3’UTRs and other mRNA regions, which implicate direct

732

mRNA-mRNA communication. These interactions could have been formed by 3’UTR

733

fragments that have been processed by RNase E (or other RNases) or by an sRNA located

734

within the 3’UTR that transcribed from an internal promoter. These 3’UTR fragments are

735

primarily described as decoys or sponges for other sRNAs (Miyakoshi et al., 2015b), but could

736

act as trans-acting sRNAs as well (Chao and Vogel, 2016). Among the interactions in our data

737

we found 79 interactions between 3’UTRs and 5’UTRs (Supplementary Table 2.6). We

738

speculate that many of these represent novel 3’UTR-derived sRNAs that target 5’UTRs of

739

mRNAs. Reanalysis of RNA-seq data from a study that globally mapped E. coli transcription

740

start sites (TSS) (Thomason et al., 2015) identified 47 TSS in these 3’UTR, strongly

741

suggesting that these 3’UTRs host sRNAs. The majority of these 3’UTR fragments appear to

742

have 5’ monophosphates. We also verified some of our findings by Northern blot analyses.

743

Thus, we have potentially uncovered many novel 3’UTR-derived sRNAs.

744

Some of these predictions were validated by our follow up work (discussed below) and,

745

while this work was in progress, also by others (Melamed et al., 2016). One of the 3’UTR-

746

derived sRNAs we uncovered (MdoR) was of particular interest as it is only detected during

747

the transition from late exponential to early stationary phase. A model of how MdoR

748

contributes to maltose uptake is shown in Figure 9A.

749

The genetic structure and transcriptional regulation of the mal regulon are well

750

understood. However, its post-transcriptional regulation has remained largely unexplored. Our

751

work uncovered new links between the maltose uptake (mal) regulon, envelope stress-

752

responses and membrane composition/assembly pathways. While initially cells metabolize

753

more favourable carbon sources such as glucose, these are generally rapidly depleted and

754

bacteria need to quickly switch to alternative carbon sources, such as maltose and

755

maltodextrins. During maltose utilisation, the malEFG operon is transcribed by the MalT

756

transcription factor and the transcript is processed by RNase E as well as other degradosome

757

components (Khemici and Carpousis, 2004). Here we show that the MdoR sRNA is a product

758

of malEFG processing, which is protected from further degradation by Hfq.

759

MdoR is unique in a sense that it not only a 3’UTR derived sRNA that targets multiple

760

pathways, but also because it is part of a mixed coherent feed forward loop (FFL) that we

761

predict promotes maltose uptake via LamB. Efficient uptake of maltose/maltodextrin not only

762

requires the inner membrane transporters encoded by the malEFG operon, but also the high-

763

affinity maltose transporter LamB (Figure 9A), which cooperates with the inner membrane

764

proteins to import these carbon sources. lamB is significantly upregulated when cells start to

765

utilize alternative carbon sources. A major advantage of a coherent FFL is that it can

766

accelerate or delay responses to stimuli, such as changes in carbon source availability. In this

767

FFL, the key activator is the MalT transcription factor, which induces the expression of both

768

malEFG and lamB when cells start to consume maltose (Figure 9B). Expression of new OMPs,

769

however, needs to be carefully coordinated as any changes in the protein composition of the

770

OM, such as increased levels of LamB (or accumulation of misfolded LamB in the periplasm),

771

can lead to induction of the sE envelope stress response caused by the reorganisation of the

772

membrane when maltodextrins are utilised (Figure 9A)(Kenyon et al., 2005). We propose that

773

malEFG indirectly promotes LamB accumulation via the MdoR sRNA that (a) reduces the

774

levels of general porins (OmpC and OmpA) and (b), likely indirectly, dampens the sE stress

775

response as a result of OMP level reduction. Dampening sE expression important during

776

maltose uptake as it induces the expression of MicA, which directly downregulates lamB

777

translation (Bossi and Figueroa-Bossi, 2007). When ectopically expressed at high levels,

778

MdoR reduces mRNA levels of ompC and ompA, which may free up the resources enabling

779

efficient accumulation of LamB in the outer membrane. At physiological levels MdoR

780

significantly reduces MicA expression and we observed a ~20% increase in lamB mRNA

781

levels. OmpC mRNA levels were not substantially affected. While these changes appear

782

modest, it is important to take into consideration the very high abundance and intrinsic stability

783

of lamB and ompC mRNAs (minute-long half-lives). It is therefore expected that even a mild

784

reduction in their mRNA levels can profoundly relieve the pressure on the OMP translation

785

and assembly pathways (Guo et al., 2014). The net outcome of mal regulon transcription,

786

MdoR biogenesis and regulatory activity, is increased expression of high-affinity components

787

of maltose-specific transport (MalE and LamB).

788

MdoR is reminiscent of the Vibrio cholerae MicX sRNA that also mapped to the 3’

789

region of malG and regulates levels of outer membrane proteins (Davis and Waldor, 2007).

790

However, the MicX targets are different from MdoR. Furthermore, unlike MdoR, MicX is

792

upstream Mal operon in V. cholerae do not affect accumulation of MicX (Davis and Waldor,

793

2007), whereas the levels of MdoR strongly correlate with malEFG mRNA levels.

794

Nevertheless, both studies demonstrate that an sRNA resides in the 3’UTR of the malG

795

transcript and pinpoint a mechanism where the expression of multiple porins is regulated by

796

sRNAs encoded within transporter mRNAs.

798

CLASH reveals large sRNA-sRNA interaction networks.

799

Our analyses unearthed an unexpectedly large number (>100) of sRNA-sRNA

800

interactions. The majority of these interactions involved known sRNA seed sequences,

801

suggesting that these could represent bona fide interactions that prevent sRNAs from base-

802

pairing with their targets or result in the degradation of the sRNAs. About 40 sRNA-sRNA

803

interactions involving sRNAs from the core genome were detected in the RNase E CLASH

804

dataset, about a quarter of which were also detected in our Hfq data. The relatively low overlap

805

between the datasets is not surprising, given the differences in the growth conditions

806

(virulence inducing conditions for enterohaemorrhagic E. coli vs growth transitions for

807

commensal E. coli MG1655). Moreover, many of the sRNA-sRNA interactions recovered in

808

association with RNase E are likely duplexes in the process of being degraded. Many of the

809

sRNA-sRNA interactions unique to our Hfq data may represent interactions between anti-

810

sRNAs and seed sequences of sRNAs which may not necessarily involve recruitment/activity

811

of RNase E.

812

The chimeras containing CyaR fragments were of particular interest as CyaR is

813

preferentially expressed during the transition from late exponential to stationary phase (De

814

Lay and Gottesman, 2009; Wassarman et al., 2001) and may therefore play an important role

815

in adaptation to nutrient availability. We could show that overexpression of ArcZ, which base-

816

pairs with CyaR in our CLASH data, significantly reduced CyaR levels (Figure 9B). Using seed

817

mutants and compensatory mutations, we confirmed direct interactions between ArcZ and

818

CyaR and our data suggests that this interaction specifically takes place during the transition

819

phase. Interestingly in Salmonella, overexpression of ArcZ showed a dramatic reduction in

820

CyaR bound to Hfq and upregulation of CyaR targets, such as nadE (Papenfort et al., 2009),

821

suggesting that this activity is conserved between these two Gram-negative bacteria. A similar

822

type of asymmetric regulation has also been elegantly demonstrated for the Qrr3 sRNA of

823

Vibrio cholera (Feng et al., 2015). The fate of these sRNA-sRNA duplexes may depend on the

824

position of the interaction; It was shown that if sRNA-target RNA base-pair within a stabilizing

825

5’ stem, the sRNA will be preferentially degraded (Feng et al., 2015). Consistent with this,

826

folding of the chimeric reads suggests that ArcZ preferentially base-pairs with CyaR at the 5’

827

end (Figure 4), which may alter secondary structures that normally help to stabilize the sRNA.

828

The biological role of ArcZ targeting CyaR is unclear, however, a possible function could be

829

to reduce noise in CyaR expression by preventing CyaR levels from overshooting during the

830

transition phase.

831

ArcZ and CyaR target mRNAs are associated with many different processes. Thus,

832

these interactions are expected to connect multiple pathways. For example, ArcZ regulation

833

of CyaR may connect adaptation to stationary phase/biofilm development (De Lay and

834

Gottesman, 2009; Monteiro et al., 2012) to quorum sensing and cellular adherence (De Lay

835

and Gottesman, 2009). CyaR expression is controlled by the global regulator Crp. Most of the

836

genes controlled by Crp are involved in transport and/or catabolism of amino acids or sugar.

837

Interestingly, ArcZ downregulates the sdaCB dicistron which encodes for proteins involved in

838

serine uptake and metabolism (Papenfort et al., 2009). This operon has been shown to be

839

regulated by Crp as well, suggesting that ArcZ can counteract the activity of Crp.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions

844

An overview of the bacterial strains used in this study is provided in Supplementary

845

Table 5. The E. coli MG1655, TOP10 or TOP10F’ strains served as parental strains. The E.

846

coli K12 strain used for CLASH experiments, MG1655 hfq::HTF was previously reported (Tree

847

et al., 2014). Cells were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) or minimal medium with supplements

848

(1xM9 salts, 2 mM MgSO4,0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.03 mM thiamine, 0.2% carbon-source) at 37°C

849

under aerobic conditions with shaking at 200 rpm. The media were supplemented with

850

antibiotics where required at the following concentrations: ampicillin (Sigma, UK, A9518) - 100

851

µg/ml, chloramphenicol (Corning, US, C239RI) - 25 µg/ml, kanamycin (Gibco, US, 11815-024)

852

- 50 µg/ml. Where indicated, 0.2% glucose or maltose were used. For induction of sRNA

853

expression from plasmids, 1 mM IPTG, 200 nM anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride (Sigma,

854

1035708-25MG) or 0.2% L-arabinose (Sigma, A3256) were used.

Construction of sRNA expression plasmids

857

For the pulse-overexpression constructs, the sRNA gene of interest was cloned at the

858

transcriptional +1 site under Para control by amplifying the pBAD+1 plasmid (Supplementary

859

Table 5) by inverse PCR using Q5 DNA Polymerase (NEB). The pBAD+1 template is derived

860

from pBADmycHisA (Tree et al., 2014). The sRNA genes and seed mutants (SM) were

861

synthesized as ultramers (IDT; Supplementary Table 5), which served as the forward primers,

862

as described (Tree et al., 2014). The reverse primer (oligo pBAD+1_5P_rev) bears a

863

monophosphorylated 5’-end to allow blunt-end self-ligation. The PCR reaction was digested

864

with 10U DpnI (NEB) for 1h at 37°C and purified by ethanol precipitation. The sRNA-pBAD

865

linear PCR product was circularized by self-ligation, performed as above. Ligations were

866

transformed in DH5α competent cells. Positive transformants were screened by sequencing.

867

The control plasmid pBAD+1 was constructed similarly by self-ligation of the PCR product

868

generated from oligonucleotides pBAD+1_XbaI_fwd and pBAD+1_5P_rev. Small RNA

869

overexpression constructs derived from the pZA21MCS and pZE12luc (Expressys) were

870

generated identically, using the indicated ultramers in Supplementary Table 5 as forward

871

primers, and oligos pZA21MCS_5P_rev and pZE12_5P_rev as reverse primers, respectively,

872

and transformed in E. coli TOP10F’.

Construction of mRNA-superfolder GFP fusions

875

Supplementary Table 5 lists all the plasmids, gene fragments and primers used for

876

cloning procedures in this work. To construct constitutively expressed, in-frame mRNA-sfGFP

877

fusions for the fluorescence reporter studies, the 5’UTR, start codon and first ~5 codons of

878

target genes were cloned under the control of PLtetO-1 promoter in a pXG10-SF backbone

879

as previously described (Corcoran et al., 2012; Urban and Vogel, 2007). Derivatives of the

880

target–GFP fusion plasmids harbouring seed mutations (SM) were generated using synthetic

881

mutated gene-fragments (IDT, Belgium, Supplementary Table 5). To prepare the inserts, the

882

target region of mRNA of interest was either amplified by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA or

883

synthesized as g-blocks (IDT, Belgium) and cloned using NheI and NsiI restriction sites.

884

Transformants were screened by restriction digest analysis and verified by Sanger sequencing

(Edinburgh Genomics, Edinburgh, UK).

Hfq UV Cross-linking, Ligation and Analysis of Hybrids (Hfq-CLASH)

888

CLASH was performed essentially as described(Waters et al., 2016), with a number

889

of modifications including changes in incubation steps, cDNA library preparation, reaction

890

volumes and UV cross-linking. E. coli expressing the chromosomal Hfq-HTF were grown

891

overnight in LB at 37°C with shaking (200 rpm), diluted to starter OD600 0.05 in fresh LB, and

892

re-grown with shaking at 37°C in 750 ml LB. A volume of culture equivalent to 80 OD600 per

893

ml was removed at the following cell-densities (OD600): 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0 and 4.0, and

894

immediately subjected to UV (254 nm) irradiation for 22 seconds (~500 mJ/cm2) in the Vari-

895

X-linker (van Nues et al., 2017) (https://www.vari-x-link.com). Cells were harvested using a

896

rapid filtration device (van Nues et al., 2017) (https://www.vari-x-link.com) onto 0.45 μM

897

nitrocellulose filters (Sigma, UK, HAWP14250) and flash-frozen on the membrane in liquid

898

nitrogen. Membranes were washed with ~15 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),

899

and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed by bead-beating in 1

mm Zirconia beads (Thistle Scientific, 11079101z), by performing 5 cycles of 1 minute

903

vortexing followed by 1-minute incubation on ice. One additional volume of TN150 buffer was

904

added. To reduce the viscosity of the lysate and remove contaminating DNA the lysate was

905

incubated with RQ1 DNase I (10U/ml Promega, M6101) for 30 minutes on ice. Two-additional

906

volumes of TN150 were added and mixed with the lysates by vortexing. The lysates were

907

centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm at 4°C and subsequently clarified by a second

908

centrifugation step at 13.4 krpm, for 20 min at 4°C. Purification of the UV cross-linked Hfq-

909

HTF-RNA complexes and cDNA library preparation was performed as described (Granneman

910

et al., 2009). Cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of pre-equilibrated M2 anti-FLAG beads

911

(Sigma, M8823-5ML) for 1-2 hours at 4°C. The anti-FLAG beads were washed three times 10

912

minutes with 2 ml TN1000 (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 1M NaCl) and three times 10

913

minutes with TN150 without protease inhibitors (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 150mM

914

NaCl). For TEV cleavage, the beads were resuspended in 250 μl of TN150 buffer (without

915

protease inhibitors) and incubated with home-made GST-TEV protease at room temperature

916

for 1.5 hours. The TEV eluates were then incubated with a fresh 1:100 dilution preparation of

917

RNaceIt (RNase A and T1 mixture; Agilent, 400720) for exactly 5 minutes at 37ºC, after which

918

they were mixed with 0.4g GuHCl (6M, Sigma, G3272-100G), NaCl (300mM), and Imidazole

919

(10mM, I202-25G). Note this needs to be carefully optimized to obtain high-quality cDNA

920

libraries. The samples were then transferred to 50 μl Nickel-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen,

921

30210), equilibrated with wash buffer 1 (6 M GuHCl, 0.1% NP-40, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris

922

pH 7.8, 10 mM Imidazole, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol). Binding was performed at 4ºC

923

overnight with rotation. The following day, the beads were transferred to Pierce SnapCap spin

924

columns (Thermo Fisher, 69725), washed 3 times with wash buffer 1 and 3 times with 1xPNK

925

buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 50mM Tris pH 7.8, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol). The

926

washes were followed by on-column TSAP incubation (Thermosensitive alkaline

927

phosphatase, Promega, M9910) treatment for 1h at 37°C with 8 U of phosphatase in 60 μl of

928

1xPNK, in the presence of 80U RNasin (Promega, N2115). The beads were washed once

929

with 500 μl wash buffer 1 and three times with 500 μl 1xPNK buffer. To add 3’-linkers (App-

930

PE – Supplementary Table 5), the Nickel-NTA beads were incubated in 80 μl 3’-linker ligation

931

mix with (1 X PNK buffer, 1 µM 3’-adapter, 10% PEG8000, 30U Truncated T4 RNA ligase 2

932

K227Q (NEB, M0351L), 60U RNasin). The samples were incubated for 4 hours at 25°C. The

RNA ligase I (NEB, M0204L), and 1 μl 100 μM L5 adapter (Supplementary Table 5), in the

940

presence of 1mM ATP and 60U RNasin. The Nickel-NTA beads were washed three times with

941

wash buffer 1 and three times with buffer 2 (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.8, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM

942

imidazole, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The protein-RNA complexes were eluted

943

in two steps in new tubes with 200 μl of elution buffer (wash buffer 2 with 250 mM imidazole).

944

The protein-RNA complexes were precipitated on ice by adding TCA (T0699-100ML) to a final

945

concentration of 20%, followed by a 20-minute centrifugation at 4°C at 13.4 krpm. Pellets were

946

washed with 800 μl acetone, and air dried for a few minutes in the hood. The protein pellet

947

was resuspended and incubated at 65°C in 20 μl 1x NuPage loading buffer (Thermo Scientific,

948

NP0007), resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Thermo Scientific, NP0323PK2) and visualised

949

by autoradiography. The cross-linked proteins-RNA were cut directly from the gel and

incubated with 160 μg of Proteinase K (Roche, 3115801001) in 600 μl wash buffer 2

951

supplemented with 1% SDS and 5 mM EDTA at 55°C for 2-3 hours with mixing. The RNA was

subsequently extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitated. The RNA

pellet was directly resuspended in RT buffer and was transcribed in a single reaction with the

954

SuperScript IV system (Invitrogen, 18090010) according to manufacturer’s instructions using

955

the PE_reverse oligo as primer. The cDNA was purified with the DNA Clean and Concentrator

957

by PCR using Pfu Polymerase (Promega, M7745) with the cycling conditions (95°C for 2 min;

958

20-24 cycles: 95°C for 20s, 52°C for 30s and 72°C for 1 min; final extension of 72°C for 5 min).

(Corcoran et al., 2012; Urban and Vogel, 2007) with modifications. The sRNA and sfGFP-

1026

fusion plasmids were co-transformed in E. coli TOP10 cells by electroporation and cells were

1027

maintained on dual selection with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. In TOP10 cells, the mRNA-

1028

sfGFP constructs are constitutively expressed, whereas sRNA expression requires L-

1029

arabinose induction. The expression of sfGFP-fused targets in the presence or absence of

1030

sRNAs was quantified at the protein level, by plate reader experiments and at the RNA level,

1031

by RT-qPCR.

1032

For the plate reader experiments, a single colony of bacterial strain harbouring a

1033

sRNA-target-sfGFP combination was inoculated in a 96-well Flat Bottom Transparent

1034

Polystyrene plate with lid (Thermo Scientific, 152038) and cultured overnight at 37°C in 100

1035

μl LB supplemented with antibiotics and L-arabinose (Sigma, A3256) to induce expression of

1036

sRNAs. Next day, each overnight inoculum was diluted 1:100 by serial dilution, in triplicate, in

1037

LB with freshly prepared L-arabinose to a final volume of 100 μl. Cultures were grown in a 96-

1038

well plate in an Infinite 200 Pro plate reader (Tecan) controlled by i-control software (Tecan)

1039

for 192 cycles at 37°C with 1 min orbital shaking (4 mm amplitude) every 5th minute. To

1040

monitor optical density over time, the following parameters were used: wavelength 600 nm,

1041

bandwidth 9 nm. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation wavelength 480 nm, bandwidth

1042

9 nm and emission wavelength 520 nm, bandwidth 20 nm. Measurements were recorded at

1043

5-minute intervals, by top reading. Raw data was processed following guidance from previous

1044

reports (Urban and Vogel, 2007). First, the range of linearity of increase of fluorescence with

1045

OD600 was identified for all individual triplicates. Only the linearity range common to all

1046

triplicates was considered for further analysis. For each set of triplicates, the mean

1047

fluorescence was calculated at each OD600. To correct for background and cell

1048

autofluorescence, the mean fluorescence of a strain with plasmid pXG-0 was subtracted from

1049

all strains with GFP plasmids at the equivalent OD600. Ultimately, a curve was generated for

1050

each sample, plotting the background-corrected fluorescence (GFP) versus OD600. The

1051

experiments were performed for three biological replicates, and mean values and standard

1052

error of the means calculated for each strain.

1054

RT-qPCR

1055

Total RNA (12.5µg) was treated with 2U of Turbo DNase (Thermo Scientific, AM2238)

1056

for 1 hour at 37°C in a 10 μl reaction in the presence of 2U SuperaseIn RNase inhibitor

1057

(Thermo Scientific, AM2694). The DNase was inactivated by 10 minutes incubation at 75°C.

1058

Reverse transcription (RT) was performed in a single reaction for all target genes of interest

1059

using a mix of gene-specific RT primers at 3.5 μM concentration each. After addition of 2.5 μl

1060

RT primer mix, the RNA and primers were denatured at 70°C for 3 min, then snap chilled and

1061

incubated on ice for 5 min. RT was performed for 1 hour at 55°C with SuperScript III (Thermo

1062

Scientific, 18080051) using 5 μl of RNA-RT primers mix in 10 μl final volume (100 U

1063

Superscript III, 2.5 mM DTT, 1xFS Buffer, 0.75 mM dNTPs) in the presence of 1U RNasin

1064

(Promega, N2115). RT was followed by treatment with 5U RNase H for 30 min at 37°C to

1065

remove the RNA from the RNA-cDNA duplexes. The cDNA was diluted 10-fold with DEPC

1066

water. Quantitative PCR was performed on 50ng of DNAse I-treated total RNA using the

1067

Brilliant III UltraFast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent, #600883) and the Luna

1068

Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB, E3005E) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

1069

The qPCRs were run on a LightCycler 480 (Roche), and the specificity of the product was

1070

assessed by generating melting curves, as follows: 65°C-60s, 95°C (0.11 ramp rate with 5

1071

acquisitions per °C, continuous). The data analyses were performed with the IDEAS2.0

1072

software, at default settings: Absolute Quantification/Fit Points for Cp determination and Melt

1073

Curve Genotyping.

1074

The qPCR efficiency of primer pairs was assessed by performing standard curves by serial

1075

dilution of template RNA or genomic DNA. Negative controls such as -RT or no template

1076

control were used throughout, and the qPCR for all samples was performed in technical

1077

triplicate. Outliers from the samples with technical triplicate standard deviations of Cp > 0.3

1078

were discarded from the analyses. To calculate the fold-change relative to the control, the 2-

1079

ddCp

1080

indicated. Experiments were performed for minimum two biological replicates, and the mean

1081

fold-change and standard error of the mean were computed. Unless otherwise stated,

Northern Blot analysis

1086

Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates by GTC-Phenol extraction. For large RNA

1087

fragments, 10 μg of total RNA was resolved on a 1.25% BPTE- gel (pH 7) and transferred to

1088

a nylon membrane (HyBond N+, GEHealthcare, RPN1210B) by capillarity. For short RNA

1089

fragments, 10 μg total RNA was separated on an 8% polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel and

1090

transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting for four hours at 50 V. Membranes

1091

were pre-hybridised in 10 ml of UltraHyb Oligo Hyb (Thermo Scientific, AM8663) for one hour

1092

and probed with

1093

sequences of the probes used for Northern blot detection are detailed in Supplementary Table

in PBST (1X phosphate saline buffer, 0.1% Tween-20). To detect Hfq-HTF protein, the

1104

membrane was probed overnight at 4°C with the Rabbit anti-TAP polyclonal primary antibody

1105

(Thermo Fisher, 1:5000 dilution in blocking solution), which recognizes an epitope at the

1106

region between the TEV-cleavage site and His6. For the loading control we used a rabbit

1107

polyclonal to GroEL primary antibody (Abcam, 1:150000 dilution, ab82592), for 2 hours at

1108

room temperature. After 3x10 min PBST washes, the membranes were blotted for one hour

1109

with a Goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (IRDye 800) secondary antibody (Abcam, ab216773, 1:10000

1111

blot was rinsed in PBS, and the proteins were visualised with a LI-COR (Odyssey CLx) using

(NEB M0293L and M0243S) (0.5 μl each) treatment for 30 minutes at 37°C. Reactions were

Construction of the MdoR seed-mutant strain

1128

To mutate the chromosomal copy of MdoR, we used the λRed system (Datsenko and

1129

Wanner, 2000). We amplified the integration cassette from plasmid pKD4 with ultramers 895

1130

and 896, containing homology regions to the coding sequence of malG, the desired MdoR

1131

sequence and to the region immediately downstream of the Rho-independent terminator,

1132

respectively. With this design, the scar after removal of the Kanr cassette was expected at a

1133

site outside the MdoR/malG sequence. The PCR product was electroporated in E. coli

1134

MG1566 strains carrying the pKD46 plasmid from which λRed recombinase was induced with

1135

10 mM L-arabinose. Correct replacement of the MdoR seed sequence was screened by

1136

colony PCR using primer pairs: 725 & 909 and 726 & 910 (Supplementary Table 5). The

1137

antibiotic resistance cassette was removed from substitution mutants by FLP-recombinase

1138

expressed constitutively from pE-FLP (St-Pierre et al., 2013). Successful allele replacement

1139

was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

1141

Polysome profiling analyses

1142

Wild-type E. coli MG1655 containing empty pBAD plasmid and an isogenic strain

1143

containing pBAD::MdoR were grown in LB until OD600 0.4, then treated for 15 minutes with L-

1144

arabinose (Sigma, A3256) to induce overexpression of MdoR, and cycloheximide (Sigma,

1145

C4859-1ML) at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml for 3 minutes. 200 ml of cells were harvested

1146

by rapid filtration and flash frozen. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS supplemented with

1147

100µg/ml cycloheximide.

1148

Polysomal profiling was performed according to previously described protocols

1149

(Bernabò et al., 2017; Lunelli et al., 2016) with minor changes in the lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl,

1150

Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from cell-samples at OD600 1.2 and 1.8 were

1162

treated with 5’-Terminator Dependent Exonuclease (Lucigen, TER51020) as per manufacturer

1163

instructions using Buffer A. The reaction was terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol

1164

precipitation, and the RNA was loaded on 8% polyacrylamide-urea gels and transferred to

1165

Seed mutant studies

1169

Wild-type MG1655 and seed mutant strains were grown overnight in minimal medium

1170

with glucose. Next day, each starter culture was split and inoculated at OD600 0.05 in fresh M9

1171

medium with glucose or maltose as the sole carbon source. Growth was monitored and cells

1172

were harvested at OD600 0.5. Total RNA was extracted, and gene expression was quantified

1173

by RT-qPCR or Northern Blot.

1174
1175

Computational analysis

1176

Pre-processing of the raw sequencing data.

1177

Raw sequencing reads in fastq files were processed using a pipeline developed by

1178

Sander Granneman, which uses tools from the pyCRAC package (Webb et al., 2014). The

1179

entire pipeline is available at https://bitbucket.org/sgrann/). The CRAC_pipeline_PE.py

1180

pipeline first demultiplexes the data using pyBarcodeFilter.py and the in-read barcode

1181

sequences found in the L5 5’ adapters. Flexbar then trims the reads to remove 3’-adapter

1182

sequences and poor-quality nucleotides (Phred score <23). Using the random nucleotide

1183

information present in the L5 5’-adaptor sequences, the reads are then collapsed to remove

1184

potential PCR duplicates. The reads were then mapped to the E. coli MG1655 genome using

1185

Novoalign (www.novocraft.com). To determine to which genes the reads mapped to, we

1186

generated an annotation file in the Gene Transfer Format (GTF). This file contains the start

1187

and end positions of each gene on the chromosome as well as what genomic features (i.e.

1188

sRNA, protein- coding, tRNA) it belongs to. To generate this file, we used the Rockhopper

1189

software (Tjaden, 2015) on E. coli rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq data (generated by Christel

1190

Sirocchi), a minimal GTF file obtained from ENSEMBL (without UTR information). The

1191

resulting GTF file contained information not only on the coding sequences, but also complete

1192

5’ and 3’ UTR coordinates. We then used pyReadCounters.py with Novoalign output files as

1193

input and the GTF annotation file to count the total number of unique cDNAs that mapped to

1194

each gene.

1195
1196

Normalization steps.

1197

To normalise the read count data generated with pyReadCounters.py and to correct

1198

for differences in library depth between time-points, we calculated Transcripts Per Million

1199

reads (TPM) for each gene. Briefly, for each time-point the raw counts for each gene was first

1200

divided by the gene length and then divided by the sum of all the values for the genes in that

1201

time-point to normalize for differences in library depth. The TPM values for each OD600 studied

1202

were divided by the TPM values of the first sample (OD600 0.4) and were then log2-normalized.

1203

The log2-normalized fold-changes were used to compare RNA-seq and Hfq-cross-linking

1204

profiles among samples, and to perform k-means clustering with the python sklearn.

1205

cluster.KMeans class.

1206
1207

Hfq-binding coverage plots.

1208

For the analysis of the Hfq binding sites the pyCRAC package (Webb et al., 2014) was

1209

used (versions. 1.3.2-1.4.4). The pyBinCollector tool was used to generate Hfq cross-linking

1210

distribution plots over genomic features. First, PyCalculateFDRs.py was used to identify the

1211

significantly enriched Hfq-binding peaks (minimum 10 reads, minimum 20 nucleotide

1212

intervals). Next, pyBinCollector was used to normalize gene lengths by dividing their

1213

sequences into 100 bins and calculate nucleotide densities for each bin. To generate the

1214

distribution profile for all genes individually, we normalized the total number of read clusters

1215

(assemblies of overlapping cDNA sequences) covering each nucleotide position by the total

1216

number of clusters that cover the gene. Motif searches were performed with pyMotif.py using

1217

the significantly enriched Hfq-binding peaks (FDR intervals). The 4-8 nucleotide k-mers with

1218

Z-scores above the indicated threshold were used for making the motif logo with the k-mer

1219

probability logo tool (Wu and Bartel, 2017) with the -ranked option (http://kplogo.wi.mit.edu/).

1220
1221

Analysis of chimeric reads.

1222

Chimeric reads were identified using the hyb package using default settings (Travis et

1223

al., 2013) and further analysed using the pyCRAC package (Webb et al., 2014). To apply this

1224

single-end specific pipeline to our paired-end sequencing data, we joined forward and reverse

1225

reads using FLASH (Magoč and Salzberg, 2011), which merges overlapping paired reads into

1226

a single read. These, as well as any remaining single reads, were then analysed using hyb.

1227

The -anti option for the hyb pipeline was used to be able to use a genomic E. coli hyb database,

1228

rather than a transcript database. Uniquely annotated hybrids (.ua.hyb) were used in

1229

subsequent analyses. To visualise the hybrids in the genome browser, the .ua.hyb output files

1230

were converted to the GTF format. To generate distribution plots for the genes to which the

1231

chimeric reads mapped, the parts of the chimeras were clustered with pyClusterReads.py and

1232

BEDtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) (intersectBed) was used to remove clusters that map to

1233

multiple regions. To produce the coverage plots with pyBinCollector, each cluster was counted

1234

only once, and the number of reads belonging to each cluster was ignored.

1235
1236

sRNA density plots.

1237

To visualize the nucleotide read density of sRNA-target pairs for a given sRNA, we

1238

first merged the hyb datasets for all OD600 and biological replicates and filtered the interactions

1239

that were found statistically significant in the unified dataset. For each sRNA-target pair in the

1240

filtered dataset, the hit counts at each nucleotide position for all chimeras were summed. The

1241

count data was log2-normalised (actually log2(Chimera count +1) to avoid NaN for nucleotide

1242

positions with 0 hits when log-transforming the data).

1243
1244

sRNA-sRNA network visualization.

1245

Only the sRNA-sRNA chimeric reads representing statistically significant interactions

1246

in the merged CLASH dataset were considered. For each such interaction, chimera counts

1247

corresponding in either orientation were summed, log2-transformed and visualized with the

1248

igraph Python package.

1249
1250

Differential expression analyses.

1251

For the differential expression analyses DESeq2 was used (Love et al., 2014). Three

1252

MdoR pulse-overexpression datasets were compared to three pBAD Control overexpression

1253

datasets. Only differentially expressed genes that had an adjusted p-value of 0.05 or lower

1254

were considered significant.

1255
1256

Multiple sequence alignments and conservation analyses.

1257

The homologous sequences of MdoR in other enterobacteria were retrieved by

1258

BLAST. JalView was used for the multiple sequence alignments, using the MAFFT algorithm

1259

(Waterhouse et al., 2009).

Figure 1–figure supplement 1. Hfq expression and Hfq binding to RNAs at different cell
densities in UV-irradiated E. coli.
(A) Western blot analyses of Hfq levels during various growth stages. Hfq-HTF was detected
using an anti-TAP primary antibody, and a fluorescent secondary antibody. GroEL was used
as a loading control.
(B) Quantification of Hfq levels from the Western blot result. The fluorescent signal for HfqHTF and GroEL was measured with the LI-COR from biological replicate experiments. The
levels of Hfq were normalised to GroEL and expressed as fold-change relative to OD600 0.4.
(C) Hfq crosslinking to RNA is similar at each optical density. Autoradiogram showing the
purified radioactively labelled Hfq-RNA complexes for each OD600 after elution from the nickel
beads. Source data for (A-C) are provided as a Source Data file.

correlated.
(A, B) Scatter plots showing the distribution of log2 Transcripts Per Million (TPM) normalised

Figure 1–figure supplement 3. Transcriptome-wide maps of Hfq binding to mRNA
genes.
(A) Heatmaps showing the distribution of Hfq binding sites across all mRNA genes at OD600
0.8 and 4.0. The genes are sorted by their sequence length (x-axis); the darker a nucleotide
is, the more Hfq is crosslinked to it. To generate the heatmap, Hfq binding clusters were
generated. A 5’-and 3’UTR length of 200bp was used.

(B) Hfq binds to poly-U tracks. Significant k-mers (4-8 nt in length) were identified using the
pyMotif tool of the pyCRAC package(Webb et al., 2014) and the motif logo was generated
using all k-mers with a Z-score > 3, with kpLogo(Wu and Bartel, 2017). (C) A more stringent
selection of the genes used to generate the distribution of Hfq binding to the transcriptome: all
genes with overlapping 5’ or 3’UTRs were removed from the analysis to avoid ‘duplicate’
counting. For all remaining cDNAs, FDR intervals of minimum 20 nt were considered for
distribution plotting. The interval length (with UTR flanks as in the GTF annotation file) for each
gene was normalized over 100 bins (x-axis), and the fraction of hits in each bin was calculated
(y-axis).

Figure 2–figure supplement 1. The sRNA and mRNA levels are not always strongly
correlated with Hfq binding during the various stages of growth.
Scatter plots comparing changes in Hfq binding (x-axis) to RNA levels (y-axis) for the indicated
OD600 for sRNAs (A) and all transcript classes (B) show that the correlation improves at higher
OD600. For each OD600, the Transcripts Per Million (TPM) normalised read counts at each

interactions from two biological replicates, recovered at three main growth stages: exponential
(OD600 0.4 and 0.8), transition (OD600 1.2, 1.8, 2.4) and early stationary (OD600 3.0 and 4.0).
The thickness of the edges is proportional to the log2(unique chimera count for each
interaction). Only sRNAs transcribed from independent promoters were included in the
analysis.

Figure 4–figure supplement 2. Interactions between ArcZ, CyaR and GcvB are
conserved. Alignments of ArcZ, CyaR and GcvB were compiled as previously described(van
Nues et al., 2016). Names of the enteric bacteria from which the sequence was retrieved are
given on the left. Indicated are possible stem-loops (brackets), seed regions (boxed in dashed
lines) and their interactions with various sections of ArcZ, CyaR or GcvB (blue and purple
bars) or with other sRNAs and mRNAs (black bars). The CyaR sequence indicated with a blue
bar is predicted to interact with two regions in GcvB (see blue bars in GcvB alignment),
including the second seed sequence. A second interaction (pink bars) involves the seed
sequence regions of CyaR and GcvB.

Figure 4–figure supplement 3. ArcZ downregulates CyaR expression.
(A) ArcZ and CyaR were overexpressed from a plasmid-borne IPTG inducible promoter (pZEArcZ and pZE-CyaR) and the data were compared to data from cells carrying a scrambled
RNA plasmid (pJV300). The co-expressed candidate target sRNAs (expressed from pZAderived backbone) were induced with anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride (panels I and II). The
bars indicate the mean fold-change in expression relative to the level of 5S rRNA (rrfD) in cells
with the indicated vector. In panel III endogenous ArcZ levels were measured upon overexpression of CyaR. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean from three biological
replicates and three technical replicates per experiment.
(B) Northern blot analysis of ArcZ and CyaR. The cells containing both the empty pZA and
pJV300 plasmids (lanes 1, 5, 9) do not express ArcZ and CyaR at detectable levels.

Figure 5–figure supplement 1. YgaM, gadE and malG contain sRNAs in their 3’UTRs.
(A) Validation of malG 3’UTR (MdoR), ygaM 3’UTR (YgaN) and gadE 3’UTR (GadF) sRNAs
by Northern blot. Total RNA extracted from cells at the indicated optical densities (OD600) was
resolved on 8% PAA-UREA gels and subjected to Northern blotting using oligos that hybridize
with the 3’UTR of the respective transcripts. The asterisk indicates cross-reactivity of the probe
with the 5S rRNA. The locations of the 3’UTR-derived fragments are indicated. MdoR and
YgaN are ~110nt, whereas GadF fragment is ~ 90nt.
(B, C) Analysis of (Terminator 5’-Phosphate Dependent Exonuclease (TEX) RNA-seq
datasets(Thomason et al., 2015) indicates that YgaN has an independent promoter, while
MdoR is a degradation product of the malEFG operon. Genome browser tracks showing the
location and normalised reads of ygaM and malG fragments in the absence of TEX (–TEX)
and in the presence of TEX (+TEX). The ygaM and putative YgaN promoters are indicated.
Independently transcribed YgaN could be further processed by RNases, at the site marked

Figure 8–figure supplement 1. Validation of MdoR-ompC interaction using GFP
reporters.
(A) Design of the wild-type and mutant ompC constructs. The panel indicates the base-pairing
region within the MdoR-ompC duplex that was mutated. We created an MdoR seed mutant
(SM) and an ompC mutant in which base pairing with MdoR SM was restored.
(B) Plasmid system used for the reporter assay: in E. coli TOP10 cells, low-copy plasmids
constitutively overexpress target 5’UTRs fused to sfGFP and medium-copy plasmids
overexpress the full-length sRNAs upon induction with L-arabinose.
(C) MdoR downregulates expression of OmpC and OmpA sfGFP fusions. In vivo fluorescence
measurements of OmpC, OmpC SM and OmpA sfGFP fusion proteins was measured using
a Tecan plate reader system. As a negative control we included sfGFP alone in the presence
or absence of sRNAs. The ‘no sRNA’ expressing strains contain the empty pBAD plasmid.
The y-axis indicates fluorescence units (F.U.) reported by the plate reader. Experiments were
performed in technical and biological triplicates; the fluorescence means and SEM of three
biological replicates are reported. Source data for are provided as a Source Data file.

Figure 8–figure supplement 2. MdoR regulates ompC mRNA translation in E. coli.
(A) Cultures at OD600 0.4 overexpressing MdoR or no sRNA for 15 minutes were subjected to
polysome profiling. Profiles of the polysomal (2x70S) and subpolysomal fractions obtained for
the empty plasmid control and MdoR overexpression samples.
(B) RT-qPCR analysis of the polysomal fractions: A ‘total’ fraction was obtained by mixing
equal amounts/volumes of the polysomal and subpolysomal fractions and is representative of
the cytosol/cell lysate content. Total RNA was extracted from all fractions (polysomal,
subpolysomal and total). Expression of ompC in the polysomal fractions was quantified relative
to the amount in ‘total’ fraction, normalized to recA, and calculated as fold-change relative to
the control sample (y-axis). The experiments were performed in technical triplicates; the
standard error of the mean (SEM) of three biological replicates fold changes are reported as
error bars. Significance of the difference in ompC mRNA level in polysomes was assessed
with a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Source data for are provided as a Source Data file.
