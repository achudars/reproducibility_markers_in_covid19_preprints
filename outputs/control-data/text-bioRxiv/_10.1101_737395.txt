1. Abstract
Bone fragility is the product of defects in bone mass and bone quality, both of which show sex-specific
differences. Despite this, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the sexually dimorphic
control of bone quality remain unclear, limiting our ability to effectively prevent fractures, especially in
postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recently, using male mice, we found that systemic or osteocyte-intrinsic
inhibition of TGFβ signaling, achieved using the 9.6-kb DMP1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase
(TβRIIocy-/- mice), suppresses osteocyte perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR) and compromises bone
quality. Since systemic TGFβ inhibition more robustly increases bone mass in female than male mice,
we postulated that sex-specific differences in bone quality could likewise result, in part, from dimorphic
regulation of PLR by TGFβ. Moreover, since lactation induces PLR, we examined the effect of TGFβ
inhibition on the female skeleton during lactation. In contrast to males, female mice that possess an
osteocyte-intrinsic defect in TGFβ signaling were protected from TGFβ-dependent defects in PLR and
bone quality. The expression of requisite PLR enzymes, the lacuno-canalicular network, and the flexural
strength of female TβRIIocy-/- bone was intact. With lactation, however, bone loss, and induction in PLR
and osteocytic parathyroid hormone type I receptor (PTHR1) expression, were suppressed in TβRIIocy-/bone, relative to wild-type. Indeed, differential control of PTHR1 expression, by TGFβ and other factors,
may contribute to dimorphism in PLR regulation in male and female TβRIIocy-/- mice. These findings
provide key insights into the sex-based differences in osteocyte PLR that underlie bone quality and
highlight TGFβ signaling as a crucial regulator of lactation-induced PLR.

2. Introduction
Evolution selects for skeletal adaptations that improve survival and reproductive fitness. A prime example
is the ability of female mammals to release stored calcium from bone to support lactation. In spite of a
sharp drop in bone mass during lactation, the female skeleton mechanically adapts to accommodate these
metabolic demands(1–5). Changes in bone quality, including trabecular microarchitecture and cortical bone
geometry, compensate for the loss of bone mass. Other aspects of bone quality, including the material
properties of bone extracellular matrix (ECM), show sexual dimorphism(6,7). Through mechanisms that
remain unclear, the protective advantage of such skeletal adaptations for reproductive females is lost later
in life. Women over 50 have a 4-fold higher rate of osteoporosis relative to men of the same age(8,9).
Furthermore, about half of osteoporotic fractures cannot be explained by clinically low bone mass(10,11).
Therefore, understanding the sexually dimorphic regulation of bone quality will elucidate mechanisms of
bone fragility in post-menopausal osteoporosis, which affects over 200 million people worldwide(12,13).

Skeletal variation in men and women arises in part from endocrine differences in hormones such as
androgens, estrogens, and inhibin(14). These hormones act in concert with paracrine growth factors to
control bone cell function(15,16). Osteoblasts and osteoclasts also exhibit sexual dimorphism at the cellintrinsic level(17–20). Osteocytes respond to high levels of PTH/PTHrP during lactation by inducing
perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR)(21,22). In PLR, osteocytes resorb, and later replace, bone matrix
surrounding their intricate lacuno-canalicular network(21,23–25). Originally termed osteocyte osteolysis,
PLR supports the metabolic demand for calcium during lactation through coordinated induction of several
key genes, including matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps; namely Mmp2, Mmp13, and Mmp14), cathepsin
K (Ctsk), carbonic anhydrase 2, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5/TRAP) to mediate
resorption(23,24,26–28). After weaning, osteocytes replace the bone lost during lactation by inducing soluble

cytosolic phosphatase (Phospho1) and dentin matrix protein (Dmp1)(29–31). Until recently, PLR was
primarily considered a response to metabolic stress or disease. Work from our group and others reveals
PLR to be crucial in homeostasis as well, where it regulates bone quality through TGFβ signaling(32).
However, the extent to which the sexually dimorphic control of PLR extends dimorphism in bone quality
remains unknown.

TGFβ is a key driver of bone mass and quality that dictates activities of all of the cells of the bone
remodeling unit. Indeed, dysregulated TGFβ signaling plays a causal role in several skeletal diseases,
including Camurati Engelman disease and osteogenesis imperfecta(33,34). This key cytokine, which is
largely produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes, is embedded within the bone ECM in a latent form(35–37).
Upon osteoclastic resorption, TGFβ is released and activated to promote recruitment and commitment of
osteoblast progenitors to the resorption site, while inhibiting their terminal differentiation. TGFβ also
promotes osteoclast formation and survival and couples bone resorption with formation(38). In osteocytes,
we found that TGFβ signaling is indispensable for PLR(32,39). Using pharmacologic TGFβ antagonists and
a novel mouse model, we demonstrated that osteocyte-intrinsic ablation of TGFβ signaling is sufficient to
suppress PLR and cause bone fragility due to severely compromised bone quality(32). Although female
mice accrue more bone mass in response to pharmacologic TGFβ antagonists than males(36), the sexually
dimorphic regulation of PLR or bone quality by TGFβ has not been evaluated.

Therefore, we used mice with an osteocyte-specific deletion of TGFβ receptor II (TβRII) to investigate
the sexually dimorphic regulation of PLR in mice at homeostasis and during the metabolic stress of
lactation. Our findings reveal a dual role for TGFβ in the control of PLR in female bone. While TGFβ is
required for lactation-induced PLR, at homeostasis, female bone is insensitive to loss of osteocytic TGFβ

signaling. Here we elucidate a cellular mechanism that contributes to the dimorphic control of PLR in
males and females, a mechanism that protects bone quality in reproductive age females.

3. Material and Methods
3.1 Mice
The generation of viable osteocyte specific TβRIIocy-/- mice was described previously31. In brief,
homozygous TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII)-floxed mice were bred with the hemizygous 9.6-kb DMP1Cre mice39,40. Half of the mice resulting from the cross were DMP1-Cre+/-; TβRIIfl/fl (named TβRIIocy-/- mice)
and half were DMP1-Cre-/-; TβRIIfl/fl littermate controls (named Wild-type (WT) mice). For genotyping
PCR, 50 ng of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies were used as a template. The presence of a
Dmp1-Cre coding sequence was confirmed using forward 5’- TTG CCT TTC TCT CCA CAG GT-3’,
reverse 5’- CAT GTC CAT CAG GTT CTT GC-3’ primers; the presence of a TβRII floxed allele was
confirmed using the following primers, forward 5’- TAT GGA CTG GCT GCT TTT GTA TTC-3’, reverse,
5’- TGG GGA TAG AGG TAG AAA GAC ATA-3’. All the transgenic mouse lines were backcrossed for 8
generations into a congenic C57BL/6 background. In all the experiments 15-week old male and female
TβRIIocy-/- and WT mice were used.

For lactation studies, TβRIIocy-/- mice and WT control littermates were time-mated at 10 weeks of age.
Females that did not become pregnant after 1 week were removed from the study to minimize age-related
differences in the bone phenotype. Following delivery, for each lactating mother the litter size was
adjusted to 8 pups in order to normalize for breast milk requirements. Mice were sacrificed after 7 days
of lactation. Baseline measurements were performed on age-matched virgin cohorts. Like males, female
TβRIIocy-/- and WT mice at 15-weeks of age were utilized in the study.

Mice, housed in a pathogen-free facility at 22°C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle, were supplied with
standard irradiated mouse chow and water ad libitum. All studies were conducted with the approval of
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California San Francisco.

3.2 Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT)
For skeletal phenotyping, 15-week-old male and female mouse bones were harvested by cleaning off the
surrounding soft tissue. Cleaned bones were subsequently fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
stored in 70% ethanol. A 2 mm region of the femoral metaphysis and a 1 mm region of the femoral middiaphysis were scanned using a Scanco µCT50 specimen scanner to assess trabecular and cortical
parameters, respectively. Scanning was performed with an X-ray potential of 55 kVp and current of 109
µA and at a resolution of 10 µm. After scanning, scan projections were reconstructed to generate crosssectional images using a cone-beam reconstruction algorithm. Density equivalent values are measured
by calibrating the scanner to a hydroxyapatite phantom provided by the manufacturer. The trabecular
bone compartment (300 µm proximal to epiphyseal plate) was segregated using manual delineation of
the endosteal surface and morphometry was characterized by measuring the bone volume fraction
(BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.), trabecular number (Tb. N.), and trabecular spacing (Tb. Sp.).
Cortical morphometry was quantified within a 500 µm mid-diaphyseal span (50 serial sections) centered
at the mid-point between proximal and distal epiphyses. Cross-sectional measurements included cortical
bone area (Ct. Ar.), thickness (Ct. Th) and mineralization (Ct. Min). Table 1 shows standard parameters
for n≥8 mice per group41.

3.3 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
As previously described, RNA was extracted and purified from bones using the miRNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA)31. Briefly, soft tissue was cleaned off of bones (humeri) and marrow was flushed
before RNA extraction. Following quantification, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using specific primers

(iQ SYBR Green Supermix, BioRad) and Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems Taqman Assays, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s protocol. Results are shown as relative gene expression, using
expression of the 18s ribosomal RNA as an internal reference gene. Sequences of the primers have
been provided in a table in the Supplemental data (Table S1).

3.4 Histology
Femurs from the TβRIIocy-/- and WT male and female virgin and lactating mice (15 weeks old) were
dissected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in 10% di- and tetra-sodium EDTA for
28 days. Bone were then processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning using a microtome. 7μm thick
sections were used for immunohistochemistry and Ploton silver stain.
For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP13 antibody (1:100;
Abcam ab39012); rabbit polyclonal monoclonal anti-MMP14 antibody (1:100; Abcam ab53712); rabbit
polyclonal anti-Cathepsin K (CTSK) antibody (1:75; Abcam ab19027), or mouse monoclonal anti-TβRII
antibody (1:500; Abcam ab186838) and mouse monoclonal anti-PTHR1 antibody (1:25, NBP1-40067:
Novus Biologicals). Subsequently, sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
and developed with a DAB-substrate chromogen system (Innovex Universal Animal IHC kit). Cells
expressing the protein of interest are stained brown. Corresponding mouse or rabbit negative control
sera was used to verify the specificity of primary antibodies.
Ploton silver staining was performed to visualize the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network in bones and
the osteocyte network area was determined and normalized to total bone area, as previously
described31,42. Osteocyte number was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Images were
acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E800 bright-field microscope. The number of osteocytes that stained
positive in a given bone area were assessed using ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The quantitative average represents data from 45 high-powered fields for each bone. Sections were evaluated for one femur from each of n≥3 mice per
group, as indicated in the figure legends.

3.5 Synchrotron radiation Micro-Tomography (SRµCT)
SRµCT studies were used to assess the degree of mineralization of the bone as well as the volume and
degree of anisotropy of the lacunae. The mid-diaphysis of 15-week-old virgin and lactating female mouse
femora were scanned with a 20 keV x-ray energy, a 300 ms exposure time and a 5x magnifying lens for
a spatial resolution of 1.3 µm (n = 4 bones/group). Imaging was performed at the Advanced Light Source
on Beamline 8.3.2 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by obtaining two-dimensional
radiographs as the specimens were rotated from 0° to 180°. The radiographs were reconstructed in 3D
Fourier-filtered back projection using Octopus software (Octopus v8; IIC UGent, Zwijnaarde). The
attenuation coefficient or gray values for each voxel is divided by the mass attenuation coefficient of bone
(4.001 cm2/g at 20 keV) to directly calculate bone mineral density. Avizo (VSG, Visualization Sciences
Group) visualization and analysis software was used to filter, segment, and quantify the lacunar features.

3.6 Flexural strength tests
Whole bone flexural strength of femora was determined by macromechanical testing of intact, hydrated
femurs isolated from TβRIIocy-/- and WT mice. 15-week old males and female virgin and lactating mice of
each genotype were used for macromechanical testing as previously described31. Intact femurs were
loaded in three-point bending on a 6 mm span with the posterior side in tension using a Bose Electroforce
3200 test frame. For all tests, load-displacement data were recorded at 10 Hz. Bone cross sections were
subsequently imaged in a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Sigma 500 VP FE-SEM) for calculation
of moment of inertia. Bending modulus was calculated from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve
using standard beam theory equations, and yield stress was calculated using the 0.2% offset method.

3.7 Serum Analysis
Blood was isolated from male and virgin and lactating female mice using a cardiac puncture protocol and
processed for serum. Serum calcium and phosphorus were measured with colorimetric assays (Abcam).

PTH in serum was analyzed by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Quidel Corporation,
Catalog no. 60-2305).

3.8 Statistical Analysis
Sample size was determined based on a power calculation that provides an 80% chance of detecting a
significant difference (p<0.05). Technical replicates and biological replicates (n) used for all experiments
are described in the figure legends. Where technical replicates are used, data are expressed as mean
± S.E.M. Otherwise, data are reported as mean ± S.D. Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Comparisons between two groups were evaluated by an
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. For comparing between more than two groups, we used one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons.

4. Results
4.1. Loss of osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling impacts bone mass and quality in male but not female
mice.
Recent studies from our group implicate osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling to be key for controlling
perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR) and bone quality, however it is unclear if this regulatory
function of TGFβ is subject to sex-specific differences. Indeed, we previously observed sexual
dimorphism in the effect of TGFβ inhibition on bone mass and osteoblast and osteoclast numbers(36). To
address this question, we used a previously developed mouse model for osteocyte-intrinsic inhibition of
TGFβ signaling to assess the bone phenotype in both sexes. Using the 9.6-kb Dmp1-Cre transgene, the
floxed TβRII allele was preferentially excised from odontoblasts and osteocytes of TβRIIocy-/- mice(32,41,42).
The efficiency of this mouse model was confirmed by observing reduction in TβRII mRNA and protein
levels in the long bone osteocytes of TβRIIocy-/- male and female mice (Figure 1A-D, Fig S1A, Fig 3D).

To assess the skeletal phenotype of TβRIIocy-/- male and female mice, micro-computed tomography (μCT)
was used. These analyses revealed an increase in trabecular thickness and trabecular bone volume in male
TβRIIocy-/- mice compared to the WT littermates (Figure 1E-G, table 1). Although cortical bone mass was
unchanged, the cortical bone mineralization of TβRIIocy-/- male mice was reduced by 3.5% relative to WT
controls (Figure 1E, H-I). Flexural strength tests showed that both yield stress and bending modulus of
TβRIIocy-/- male bones was decreased by 20%, thereby indicating a reduction in the bone material quality
of TβRIIocy-/- males compared to WT mice (Figure 1J-K). As expected, based on our prior work on 8-week
old TβRIIocy-/- males, the current findings confirm the critical role of osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling
in maintaining bone quality in 15-week old male mice.
None of these bone quality defects in TβRIIocy-/- males were present in female TβRIIocy-/- mice. In
particular, the trabecular and cortical bone mass and geometry of TβRIIocy-/- females remained intact, and
the flexural strength of TβRIIocy-/- female bones was identical to that of the WT group (Figure 1E-I, J-K,
Table 2). These observations suggest that female mouse bones do not depend on osteocytic TGFβ
signaling for maintaining bone mass and quality, and that osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ impacts bone in a
sexually dimorphic manner.
4.2 TGFβ signaling regulates osteocyte-mediated PLR in sex-specific manner.
Bone quality is in part regulated by PLR, and our prior evidence from 8-week-old TβRIIocy-/- male mice
ascribes their defects in bone quality to PLR suppression(32). Therefore, we hypothesized that the distinct
bone quality phenotype of male and female TβRIIocy-/- mice is driven by differences in osteocytic PLR.
Since an intact lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) is a hallmark of functional PLR, we first examined the
LCN in femora from 15-week old male and female TβRIIocy-/- mice. Compared to WT males, the LCN of
15-week old TβRIIocy-/- male bone was severely deteriorated, with a 50% reduction in LCN area and

blunted canalicular length (Figure 2A-B, D). In addition, the male TβRIIocy-/- bones also displayed a strong
coordinated decrease in the expression of genes encoding factors involved in bone resorption during PLR,
namely, Mmp2, Mmp13, Mmp14 (matrix metalloproteinases), Ctsk (Cathepsin K), Acp5 (tartrateresistant acid phosphatase), Atp6v0d2 (AtpD2), and Atp6v1g1 (AtpG1) (vacuolar ATPase pump encoding
genes) (Figure 2F and H). Moreover, osteocyte-intrinsic protein expression of MMP13, MMP14 and
CTSK was reduced in TβRIIocy-/- male mouse bones (Figure 2J).
Female TβRIIocy-/- mice responded differently to osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ ablation. In the female TβRIIocy/-

mice, the osteocyte LCN was intact with no changes observed in LCN area or canalicular length (Figure

2A, C and E). Consistent with these results, the expression of PLR genes in the bone of female TβRIIocy/-

mice did not differ from that in WT controls (Figure 2G, I and K). Thus, the homeostatic regulation of

PLR and bone quality in female mice occurs independently of TGFβ signaling. Since the absence of
osteocytic TGFβ signaling in males adversely affects these outcomes, our data show a sexually dimorphic
role for TGFβ in the control of PLR and bone quality.
4.3 Osteocytic deletion of TβRII prevents lactation induced PLR.
Although the homeostatic regulation of PLR in females is TGFβ-independent, we hypothesized that intact
TGFβ signaling may be required to induce PLR in response to the metabolic stress of lactation. Using an
established murine model of lactation, we assessed PLR outcomes in 15-week old lactating TβRIIocy-/- and
WT mice. These results were compared to those in the 15-week old female TβRIIocy-/- and WT virgin
controls, described above. Upon validation of targeted TβRII deletion at the mRNA and protein levels in
the lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice (Figure 3A, C and D), we monitored the effect of lactation on the expression
of PLR genes. WT mice showed a 2.5 to 4-fold induction in the expression of the Mmp14, Ctsk, Acp5
and Atp6v0d2 genes (Figure 3A-B) during lactation. The increased expression of PLR enzymes was also
apparent at the protein level, with a 3 to 5-fold increase in the percentage of MMP13, MMP14 and CTSK-

positive osteocytes in the lactating WT group (Figure 3C-D). Consistent with these observations, WT
lactating mice undergo a 50% increase in the LCN area and a corresponding 40% increase in the mean
lacunar volume relative to WT virgin controls (Figure 3E-H).
On the contrary, lactation failed to induce PLR in TβRIIocy-/- mice. In particular, lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice
did not exhibit a significant induction in PLR genes, LCN area, lacunar volume and canalicular length
(Figure 3 A-H). Similar to resorptive genes, the lactation-induced expression of bone formation genes,
Dmp1 and Runx2, was absent in TβRIIocy-/- mice (Figure S2A-B). Therefore, distinct from the TGFβindependent regulation of PLR in female bone at homeostasis, osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling is
required for the induction of PLR during lactation.
4.4 Targeted deletion of osteocytic TβRII mitigates lactation-induced bone loss
µCT analyses revealed that during lactation, WT mice lose more than 52% of trabecular bone volume
fraction (BV/TV, Table 1). This decrease in BV/TV is reflected by the corresponding reduction in
trabecular number (28%) and thickness (32%) and increase in trabecular spacing (45%) during lactation
in WT mice (Table 1, Figure 4A-B). The trabecular bone mineralization is also reduced by 9% with
lactation in WT mice. A decrease in cortical bone thickness (27% reduction) and mass (25% reduction)
was observed in lactating WT mice, but the cortical mineralization remained intact (Table 1, Figure 4AC). In contrast to WT mice, TβRIIocy-/- mice did not lose trabecular bone mass during lactation, and their
trabecular number and spacing remained unaltered. TβRIIocy-/- mice lost some cortical thickness and bone
mass during lactation, however the magnitude of change was significantly lower in lactating TβRIIocy-/mice than WT mice (i.e. 14% vs. 25%, p<0.05) (Figure 4A-C).
The high-resolution quantitative imaging available through synchrotron SRµCT further revealed a
comparable trend towards increased mineralization around osteocyte lacunae with lactation that was
apparent in both genotypes (Figure S3). However, µCT data did not show significant differences in overall

cortical bone mineralization during lactation in either genotype (Table 1). Accordingly, bone bending
modulus, yield stress, and ultimate stress were unaffected by lactation in either genotype (Table 2).
Collectively, these data establish the role of osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling in lactation, such that
absence of this mechanism alleviates lactation-induced bone remodeling by osteocytes and surface cells.
4.5 PTH involvement in the sexually dimorphic effects of osteocytic TGFβ
As we previously reported, the elevated bone mass in 8-week old TβRIIocy-/- male mice is accompanied
by reduced Rankl (Tnfsf11) expression and decreased osteoclast numbers(32). Therefore, we hypothesized
that the sex-specific differences in bone mass in TβRIIocy-/- male and female mice were driven by
dimorphic regulation of Rankl. Here we find that 15-week old male TβRIIocy-/- mice also express low
levels of Rankl mRNA, with a stark reduction in the Rankl/Opg ratio, compared to WT males. Female
TβRIIocy-/- mice, on the other hand, showed intact Rankl and Rankl/Opg ratios during homeostasis (Figure
5A-B). During lactation, the high demand for calcium drives bone resorption, in part, through robust Rankl
expression(43). Indeed, lactating WT mice increase Rankl mRNA expression with a resulting 7-fold
increase in the Rankl/Opg ratio (Figure 5C and S2C). Lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice, however, fail to stimulate
Rankl mRNA expression. Instead Opg mRNA levels are suppressed in the lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice,
through an apparent compensatory mechanism to increase the Rankl/Opg ratio 2-fold to release calcium
for lactation (Figure 5C and S2C).
These differences in Rankl/Opg expression led us to focus on the role of PTH signaling in the sexually
dimorphic effects of TGFβ in osteocytes. Several lines of evidence motivated our focus: First, PTH
signaling directly regulates Rankl gene expression in osteocytes(44,45). Second, PTH and parathyroid
hormone related peptide (PTHrP), key regulators of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, induce PLR
during lactation(5,21,46–48). Third, PTH and PTHrP signal through a common parathyroid hormone receptor
(PTHR1) in osteocytes; and PTHR1 ablation in osteocytes blocks lactation-inducible PLR(21). Fourth, as

in PTHR1ocy-/- mice, TβRIIocy-/- mice are unable to induce PLR or bone loss during lactation(21). Fifth,
TβRII and PTHR1 interact in osteoblasts to augment PTH signaling and increase bone formation(49). Based
on these findings, we hypothesized that TGFβ and PTH signaling utilize a common molecular mechanism
to regulate PLR.
To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of TβRII ablation on the expression of PTHR1 in the
osteocytes. Both immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR revealed a stark reduction (>70%) in the
expression of PTHR1 in osteocytes of TβRIIocy-/- male mice compared to WT (Figure 5D, G, H). This was
consistent with the low Rankl mRNA and Rankl/ Opg ratios seen in the TβRIIocy-/- males. In females during
homeostasis, no changes were detected in the expression of PTHR1 at the mRNA or protein level between
WT and TβRIIocy-/- mice, which agrees with the lack of changes in Rankl/Opg in TβRIIocy-/- females (Figure
5E, G, I). During lactation, PTHR1 expression is robustly increased in WT females, but loss of osteocytic
TβRII mitigates this response in lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice (Figure 5F, G, J), consistent with the lower
overall Rankl/Opg ratio in lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice compared to lactating WT mice.
Lastly, we evaluated serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and PTH in each group (Table 3). Phosphate
levels did not differ in any condition. The two groups that had reduced PTHR1 expression, male and
lactating female TβRIIocy-/- mice, had elevated levels of serum calcium relative to WT controls. In male
TβRIIocy-/- mice, the hypercalcemia may result from increased serum PTH levels. Importantly, in nonlactating female mice, none of these parameters differed between TβRIIocy-/- mice and WT controls, which
is consistent with the insensitivity of these mice to osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ ablation in all the other
outcomes we analyzed. Taken together these findings suggest a key role of TβRII in regulating PTHR1
expression in osteocytes, and that this coordination between TGFβ and PTH signaling dictates the PLR
response in osteocytes during homeostasis and metabolic stress.

5. Discussion
This study provides insight into sex-specific variation in bone fragility by revealing dimorphism in the
regulation of osteocyte perilacunar/ canalicular remodeling (PLR). Using a genetic model of osteocytespecific deletion of TGFβ receptor II (TβRII), we show that loss of osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling
affects the skeleton of male, but not female, mice in homeostatic conditions. Male TβRIIocy-/- mice have
defective bone quality, despite normal bone mass, resulting from impaired osteocytic PLR with
deteriorated canalicular networks and reduced expression of requisite PLR enzymes. On the contrary,
female TβRIIocy-/- mice are protected from these deficits in both PLR and bone quality. Osteocytic TGFβ
signaling is necessary for PLR induction in female mice during lactation. Lactation-induced PLR is
mitigated in TβRIIocy-/- females, as is lactation-induced bone loss. These findings highlight distinct roles
for TGFβ signaling in regulating PLR in males and females to maintain bone homeostasis and implicate
TGFβ as an essential regulator of PLR in females principally during the metabolic stress of lactation.
Gender disparity in fracture risk stems from differences in peak bone mass accrual, bone size, and
geometry(50). Sex steroids that essentially drive skeletal variations in men and women integrate systemic
cues such as that from vitamin D, IGF/GH, and PTH to dictate dimorphism at the cellular level(19,51–53).
Indeed, sex differences in the cellular function of osteoblasts and osteoclasts have been attributed to
differences in the bone phenotype of male and female mice(17–20). Differences in bone quality also
contribute to the gender disparities in fracture risk. Osteocyte PLR is one cellular mechanism that plays a
pivotal role in maintaining bone quality. Although the contribution of PLR to sex differences in bone
quality was unknown, osteocytes clearly have a dimorphic response to aging(54,55). The osteocyte lacunocanalicular network, which is maintained by PLR, deteriorates more rapidly in aging females than in aging
males(54,55). Here we describe sexually dimorphic regulation of osteocytes in the control of PLR and bone
quality by TGFβ signaling. Whereas in males, loss of osteocytic TGFβ signaling suppresses PLR and

increases bone fragility, female TβRIIocy-/- mice demonstrate a complete lack of this regulatory
mechanism. Such skeletal adaptations in females could be one of the mechanisms by which the female
skeleton compensates to meet the skeletal demands of pregnancy and lactation. The extent to which this
‘protective mechanism’ in reproductive age females is lost following menopause, or if it contributes to the
increased risk of post-menopausal bone fragility remains unknown. Nevertheless, our study shows that
sex specific differences in osteocyte sensitivity to TGFβ signaling contribute to the sexual dimorphism in
PLR and bone quality.
TGFβ signaling has previously been implicated as one of the mechanisms recruited to confer sex specific
differences in bone. An intricate crosstalk exists between TGFβ signaling and estrogen in bone. Estrogen
promotes de novo synthesis and activation of TGFβ ligand in bone. Conversely, the loss of estrogen in
ovariectomized rats leads to reduced TGFβ expression in bone(56–60). TGFβ, in turn, mediates bone
protective effects of estrogen by increasing osteoclast apoptosis(57,61). With systemic inhibition of TGFβ
signaling using a pharmacologic TGFβ receptor I kinase inhibitor (TβRI-I), we observed increased
sensitivity of the female skeleton to TGFβ inhibition, with increased osteoblast proliferation and bone
mass accrual in female mice than males(36). Here, in osteocytes of female mice with ablated TβRII, we
observed that loss of osteocytic TGFβ signaling has no impact on PLR gene expression, the osteocyte
lacuno-canalicular network, and bone quality. The extent to which these sex specific differences in
osteocyte TGFβ signaling are related to estrogen levels remains to be determined. The remarkably distinct
regulation of TGFβ signaling by sex-specific factors in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes could afford
independent, yet coordinated, regulation of bone quantity and quality to maintain mineral homeostasis and
bone strength during hormonal and reproductive cycles in females.

Systemic calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by the parathyroid gland that controls the interplay
between the calciotropic hormones like, parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid hormone related protein
(PTHrP), calcitonin, and calciferol (1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, vitamin D3). Together these
hormones establish an equilibrium between dietary calcium absorption through the intestines, calcium
reabsorption and excretion through kidneys, and its storage and release from bones(62). In bone, osteocytes
show particularly high sensitivity to calcium fluctuations and are a target of PTH action(21,63,64). PTHR1,
the receptor that binds both PTH and PTHrP, is highly expressed in bone and kidney and mediates the
PTH-dependent regulation of calcium homeostasis. Although, little is known about the crosstalk of PTH
and PTHrP with TGFβ signaling in bone, PTHR1 interacts directly with TβRII. In osteoblasts, PTHR1
and TβRII coordinately modulate bone formation(49). In osteocytes, however, we observed that ablation
of TβRII causes a marked reduction in PTHR1 expression and Rankl/ Opg ratios only in male mice. Given
that PTHR1 is a key regulator of PLR, the PLR and bone quality defects observed in the male TβRIIocy-/may result from reduced PTHR1-dependent signaling. The reduced PTHR1-dependent signaling in
TβRIIocy-/- male mice appears to be compensated by increased systemic PTH levels, which in turn increase
systemic calcium levels, likely by targeting tissues other than bone.
In female mice, the role of TGFβ in osteocytes differs dramatically between homeostatic conditions and
the metabolic stress of lactation. In homeostatic conditions, female TβRIIocy-/- mice differ from TβRIIocy/-

males, in that they show intact osteocytic PTHR1 expression and PLR. Other pathways that are active

in females, but not in males, may converge on PTHR1 to sustain its expression in female mice at
homeostasis. This capacity of female TβRIIocy-/- osteocytes to normalize PTHR1 levels at homeostasis may
contribute to the intact bone quality of female TβRIIocy-/- mice. This capacity is challenged by the metabolic
stress of lactation, which normally induces PLR to meet the high calcium demands for breastmilk
production. PLR induction during lactation occurs in a hormonal milieu with low PTH and estradiol, but

with high PTHrP levels. While we demonstrated reduction in circulating PTH with lactation in both
genotypes, the circulating level of PTHrP was not significantly increased in either genotypes, most likely
due to insufficient sensitivity of our assay. PLR induction during lactation also requires osteocytic PTHR1.
Although PTHR1 mRNA is induced in lactation in both genotypes, the induction of PTHR1 protein in
osteocytes is abrogated in lactating TβRIIocy-/- mice relative to WT littermates. Accordingly, with reduced
osteocytic PTHR1 protein levels, PLR induction in female TβRIIocy-/- mice during lactation is blocked.
Our results point to the possibility that the level of PTHR1 is a pivotal determinant of the effect of TGFβ
on PLR. Thus, the differential PLR response of osteocytes in the TβRIIocy-/- mice in males vs. females,
and in homeostasis vs. metabolic stress, may result from differences in the ability to stimulate PTHR1mediated bone resorption by osteocytes. It is likely that such molecular mechanisms are in place to
compensate for reproductive bone loss and protect the female skeleton from higher fracture risk. Another
such compensatory mechanism that was recently suggested includes accrual of higher trabecular bone
mass than mechanically necessary by female rats compared to males(1,65).
In conclusion, our study highlights sexual dimorphism in TGFβ’s regulation of osteocyte
perilacunar/canalicular remodeling activity.

With implication of PLR in both physiological and

pathological conditions, including renal osteodystrophy, glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis,
osteoarthritis, and hyperparathyroidism(21,66–71), defining the sex differences in these cell-intrinsic cues
and molecular networks in osteocytes will be critical to address sexual dimorphism in the prevalence and
manifestation of bone fragility, as well as refining therapeutics for reducing fracture risk.

Figure 1. Loss of osteocyte-intrinsic TGFβ signaling impacts bone mass and quality in male mice
but does not affect female mice.
In male and female TβRIIocy−/− mice, knockdown of TβRII at mRNA (A, B) (n=6-9 mice/ group) and
protein (C, D) (n=4-6 mice/ group) level was assessed. μCT analysis was conducted on femurs from WT
and TβRIIocy−/− male and female mice (15-week-old). Representative μCT reconstructions of trabecular
(left) and cortical (right) bone (E) from mice are shown. Trabecular bone thickness (Tb. Th.) (F) and bone
volume fraction (BV/TV) (G), and cortical bone area (BA/TA) (H) and mineralization (Ct. Min) (I) were
assessed (n=7-8 mice/group). Flexural testing of femurs from male and female WT and TβRIIocy-/- mice
shows bone quality parameters yield stress (J) and bending modulus (K) (n = 7 mice/group). Data for A-

Figure 2. Osteocyte-specific disruption of TβRII reduces PLR genes in male but not female mice.
Bones from 15-week-old male and female WT and TβRIIocy-/- mice were harvested and processed for
mRNA and protein analysis. Osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) in the femoral cortical bones
was assessed by silver nitrate staining. Representative images (A) and quantification of LCN area (B, C)
and canalicular length (D, E) are shown. Scale bar, 20 μm; n=4-6 mice/group and 4 ROI/mouse.
Expression of PLR genes Mmp2, Mmp13 and Mmp14 (F, G) and Ctsk, Acp5, Atp6v0d2 (AtpD2) and
Atp6v1g1 (AtpG1) are shown (H-I) (n=6-9 mice/ group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMP13,
MMP14, and CTSK was conducted on femoral cortical bones of male and female WT and TβRIIocy-/- mice
and percent positively stained osteocytes was quantified (J- K) (n = 3-4 mice/group and 4 ROI/mouse).
Scale bar, 30 μm. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM, ∗p < 0.05 different from WT group from Student’s
t test.

Figure 3. Lactation induced PLR blocked by osteocyte-specific disruption of TβRII gene.
Bones from 15-week-old virgin and lactating WT and TβRIIocy-/- female mice were harvested and
processed for gene expression (A-B) and immunohistochemistry (C-D). qPCR analysis of TβRII and PLR
genes Mmp2, Mmp13, Mmp14, Acp5, Ctsk, Atp6v0d2 and Atp6v1g1 (A-B) in virgin and lactating WT
and TβRIIocy-/- mouse bones was compared (n=6-9 mice/ group). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for
MMP13, MMP14, and CTSK was conducted on femoral cortical bones of virgin and lactating WT and
TβRIIocy-/- mice. Arrows in the representative images indicate positively stained osteocytes (D) that were
quantified and normalized to total bone area (C) (n = 3-4 mice/group and 4 ROI/mouse). Change in

osteocyte lacunar area (E, F) and canalicular length (H) of virgin and lactating WT and TβRIIocy-/- mice
were measured from Ploton silver stained cortical bone. Lacunar volume (G) was examined by SRμT
(n=4-5 mice/group). Scale bar for D is 50 μm and 20 μm for E. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM, *p<0.05
compared to WT virgins, #p<0.05 compared to WT lactation group, and $ p<0.05 compared to TβRIIocy/-

virgin, as calculated from one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test.

Figure 4. Lactation induced trabecular bone mass in lactating TβRIIocy-/- is mitigated.
μCT analysis of femurs from 15-week old WT and TβRIIocy-/- lactating female mice. Representative μCT
reconstructions show trabecular (top) and cortical (bottom) bones (A). Decline in trabecular bone
parameters: trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.), mineralization (Tb. BMD) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV)
(B), and cortical bone parameters: cortical thickness (Ct. Th), and cortical bone volume (C) with lactation
is represented as percent change compared to the respective virgin groups for both genotypes. Scale bar,
100 μm (n = 6-10 mice/group). Error bars indicate mean ± SD, *p<0.05 compared to WT lactation as
calculated from Student’s t-test.

Figure 5. PTHR1 dependent signaling is reduced in TβRIIocy-/- males and lactating females.
qPCR analysis for Rankl and Opg in WT and TβRIIocy-/- males (A) and virgin (B) and lactating (C) females
is presented as a ratio of Rankl/Opg mRNA, with lactating groups shown relative to corresponding virgin
groups. Pthr1 mRNA was also quantified by qPCR(D-F) and by immunohistochemistry (G-J). Percentage
of osteocytes that stained positive for PTHR1 in bones of WT and TβRIIocy-/- male and virgin and lactating
female mice were quantified and normalized against total bone area as shown (H-J) (n=3-4 mice/group, 4
ROI/mouse). Error bars indicate mean ± SEM, *p<0.05 compared to respective WT group as calculated
from Student’s t-test.
