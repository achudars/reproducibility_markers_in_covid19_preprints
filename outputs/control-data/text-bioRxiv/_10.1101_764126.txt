ABSTRACT
Skp1 is an adapter that links F-box proteins to cullin-1 in the Skp1/cullin-1/F-box (SCF) protein
family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets specific proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent protein
degradation. Skp1 from the amoebozoan Dictyostelium forms a stable homodimer in vitro with a Kd of 2.5
µM as determined by sedimentation velocity studies, yet is monomeric in crystal complexes with F-box
proteins. To investigate the molecular basis for the difference, the solution NMR structure of a doublytruncated Skp1 homodimer was determined. The dimer interface was mapped by intermolecular NOEs
which identified ten contact amino acids. The resulting structure of the Skp1ΔΔ dimer has semi-parallel
2-fold symmetry with an interface that buries ~700 Å2 of predominantly hydrophobic surface that
partially overlaps with subsite-1 of the F-box interaction interface, explaining why only the Skp1
monomer binds FBPs. To confirm the model, Rosetta was used to identify amino acid substitutions that
might disrupt that dimer, and the F97E substitution was chosen to potentially minimize interference with
F-box interactions. Skp1ΔF97E behaved as a monomer at concentrations up to 500 µM and actively
bound a model F-box protein, mammalian Fbs1. Therefore, the dimeric state is not required for Skp1 to
carry out a basic biochemical function, and access to the monomeric state is expected to facilitate
structural studies of the mechanism of regulation of protist Skp1 by posttranslational prolyl hydroxylation
and glycosylation.

INTRODUCTION
The Skp1/cullin-1/F-box (SCF) protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases is an important mediator of
protein turnover in yeast/fungi, higher plants, and animals, owing to the role of polyubiquitination in
serving as a signal for recognition and degradation in the 26S-proteasome. Evidence supports the
importance of the SCF complex in the protist kingdom as well (West and Blader, 2015), where a novel
posttranslational modification has been discovered in Skp1s from groups as diverse as amoebozoa
[Dictyostelium discoideum], apicomplexans [Toxoplasma gondii], and oomycetes [Pythium ultimum] (van
der Wel et al., 2019). Protist Skp1 is subject, in the presence of sufficient O2-tension and a-ketoglutarate
concentration, to hydroxylation of a Pro-residue that lies on the backside of subsite-2 of the F-box binding
domain of Skp1. Once Skp1 is hydroxylated, the Hyp residue is recognized and glycosylated by a series
of glycosyltransferases, resulting in the assembly of a stereotyped pentasaccharide. Mutational studies
show that both hydroxylation and full glycosylation are required for optimal O2-sensing in Dictyostelium
and Toxoplasma (West and Blader, 2015; Mandalasi et al., 2019). Biophysical and computational studies
have generated a model by which the relatively organized structure of the pentasaccharide glycan
organizes the surrounding intrinsically disordered region of Dictyostelium Skp1 in such a way as to be
more conducive to recognizing the F-box domain of FBPs (Sheikh et al., 2017), and recent studies
indicate that this model is also relevant to Skp1 from Toxoplasma (Mandalasi et al., 2019). Confirmatory
studies are hampered by the dimeric state of glycosylated Skp1 (GGFGGn-Skp1) at concentrations used
for biophysical studies, because its relatively large size, 324 amino acids.
Recombinant guinea pig Skp1, whose sequence is identical across mammals, was previously reported

to dimerize with a Kd of 1.1 µM (Henzl et al., 1998). This value is substantially below the estimated
concentration of Skp1 (a.k.a. OCP2) in the inner ear tissues where Skp1/OCP-2 was initially
characterized, suggesting that dimerization might influence Skp1 activity in cells. Studies of
Dictyostelium Skp1, where small angle X-ray scattering, gel filtration, and NMR studies confirmed its
dimeric status at higher concentrations, indicate that glycosylation modestly inhibits dimerization (Sheikh
et al., 2014). We sought to investigate the significance of Skp1 dimerization by mapping its dimer
interface. The structure of Skp1 from mammals, yeast and higher plants is known when it is bound to Fbox proteins (Schulman et al., 2000; Zimmerman et al., 2010), and despite the broad sequence variations
in F-box domains, the sequence and structure of Skp1 in these complexes is highly though not absolutely
conserved. However, free Skp1 has defied structural characterization, potentially because of intrinsically
disordered regions (including its C-terminal region that contributes to F-box domain recognition) that
preclude the formation of high-quality crystals for X-ray crystallography. At the same time, the Skp1
homodimer is too large for solution NMR studies without resorting 2H-isotope labeling. We have found
that Dictyostelium Skp1A remains a dimer in the absence of an internal disordered region that was
originally removed to allow crystallization with F-box proteins (Schulman et al., 2000). In addition,
truncation of the intrinsically disordered region that comprises the C-terminal subsite-2 of the F-box
binding region is also not required for dimerization. The doubly truncated Skp1ΔΔ dimer variant (2 × 118
aa) was sufficiently small to pursue high-resolution solution NMR structure determination using uniform
15
N- and 13C-isotope labeling. We found that the homodimer interface overlaps with F-box binding and
confirmed the finding by Rosetta-guided mutagenesis, and discuss the implications for Skp1 function and
future studies on its regulation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Expression Plasmids. Dictyostelium Skp1∆∆ was generated from pET19b-Skp1A (Xu et al., 2018)
by site-directed mutagenesis, in which primers designed to bridge the deleted sequence as described in
Figure S1C were used in a PCR reaction with Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England
Biolabs) to amplify the desired modified vector. After treatment with DpnI to destroy the original vector
template, the sample was cloned into E. coli strain BL21-Gold(DE3).
For improved recovery and purification, the Dictyostelium Skp1A coding sequence was codon
optimized for expression in E. coli, and appended with an N-terminal His6-tag which, when excised by
treatment with TEV protease, yielded the native sequence with an N-terminal extension of SMSL-,
compared to the N-terminal SL- that occurs natively after removal of the start Met (West et al., 1997).
The cDNA (Figure S1A) was synthesized and provided in pUC57 by GenScript, excised using NcoI and
BamHI, and ligated into the restriction sites for NcoI and BamHI of pET19b, yielding pET19bHis6DdSkp1A-optim. A second cDNA in which 12 internal amino acids (SPQGDDKKDEKR) were
replaced with GGSG (Figure S1B) was synthesized and similarly ligated into pET19B yielding pET19bHis6DdSkp1A∆Loop-optim. This plasmid was modified to generate an F97E point mutation by sitedirected mutagenesis, in which the indicated primers were used in a PCR reaction to amplify the modified
vector as above.
Expression and Purification of Skp1 constructs. Skp1 proteins without an affinity tag were purified
from E. coli to near homogeneity under non-denaturing conditions (DEAE, phenyl, Q and S200 Superdex
columns) as described previously (Sheikh et al., 2014). Sample was assessed by SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie blue staining to be >90%.
E. coli cells expressing His6Skp1Δ or His6Skp1ΔF97E were incubated at 37 ºC in 2 × 1 L of Terrific
Broth medium in the presence of 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Once the cell growth reached an OD600 of 0.6,
protein expression was induced with 125 µM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20ºC.
After 12-16 h, cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 50 mM
Na+/K+ phosphate (pH 7.8), 300 mM NaCl, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin at 4ºC. Cells were lysed
using a probe sonicator (model 500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for a total sonication time of 5 min. The

lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 45 min at 4ºC, and the supernatant was immediately applied to a
1.5 ml column of Co2+ Talon resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated at 4ºC in the buffer described above. The
column was washed successively with buffers supplemented with either 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, or 5
mM Imidazole. Protein was eluted with buffer containing 300 mM imidazole, and dialyzed against 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM TCEP. The
sample was incubated overnight at 20°C with His6TEV protease to cleave the His6-tag from Skp1, and the
sample was re-applied to the Talon resin. The flow-through was concentrated to 1.5 ml using a spin
concentrator (Amicon) with a 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off. The concentrated sample was further
purified over a Superdex 200 Hi-load 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with
20 mM K+/phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM TCEP. The sample was estimated to be >95%
pure by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue.
Stable isotope labeled Skp1∆∆ and His6Skp1ΔF97E proteins for NMR studies were prepared via
expression in E. coli using isotope enriched minimal media as previously described (Xu et al., 2018) and
purified using methods described above. His6Skp1ΔF97E was uniformly enriched with 15N isotope only,
and Skp1∆∆ was labeled with 15N and 13C. The final Skp1∆∆ NMR sample (105 µl in a 3-mm Shigemi
tube) contained a 1:1 mixture of 15N,13C-Skp1ΔΔ and natural abundance Skp1ΔΔ at ~1.0 mM
concentration in 20 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% NaN3. 15Nlabeled Skp1ΔF97E NMR samples (300 µl in 5-mm Shigemi tubes) were prepared at concentrations of
100 µM and 500 µM in the same buffer. All NMR samples contained 10% D2O for spectrometer lock.
Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Protein was quantified based on molar absorptivity calculated from
the protein sequence using ProtParam (Gastiger et al., 2005). Samples were loaded into 12-mm doublesector Epon centerpieces equipped with quartz windows and equilibrated for 2 h at 20°C in an An60 Ti
rotor. Sedimentation velocity data were collected using an Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge
(Beckman Coulter) at 50,000 rpm at 20°C. Data were recorded with absorbance optics at 280 nm, 230 nm
or 215 nm in radial step sizes of 0.003 cm. SEDNTERP (Laue et al., 1992) was used to model the partial
specific volume as well as the density and viscosity of the buffer. SEDFIT (Schuck, 2000) was used to
analyze sedimentation data. All data were modeled as continuous c(s) distributions and were fit using
baseline, meniscus, frictional coefficient, and systematic time-invariant and radial-invariant noise.
Predicted sedimentation coefficient (s) values for Skp1 monomer and dimer were calculated using
HYDROPRO (Ortega et al., 2011) with a homology model generated on the ROBETTA server (Kim &
Chivian et al., 2004). Data fit and c(s) plots were generated using GUSSI (Brautigam, 2015). Weightaveraged S values (Sw) at each concentration were determined by integrating c(s) distributions.
Constructed Sw isotherms were fitted with A+A<-->AA reversible self-association model using
SEDPHAT (Schuck, 2003).
NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination of Skp1ΔΔ. NMR spectra for Skp1ΔΔ were
acquired at 35°C using a Bruker AVANCE NEO 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm cryogenic
TCI 1H{13C,15N} probe, and an Agilent VNMRS 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 3-mm cryogenic
1
H{13C,15N} probe. NMR spectra for 100 µM and 500 µM Skp1ΔF97E samples were acquired using a
Bruker AVANCE NEO 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm cryogenic TXO 13C,15N{1H}
probe, and the 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm cryogenic 1H{13C,15N} probe. The acquired
NMR spectra are summarized in Table S1. NOE mixing times were 70 ms for 13C/15N-edited [1H,1H]NOESY and 120 ms for 13C/15N-filtered 13C/15N-edited [1H,1H]-NOESY experiments. Fourier transform
was performed with TopSpin (Bruker BioSpin) for Bruker NMR data, and NMRPipe (Delaglio et al.,
1995) for Varian NMR data. 1H chemical shifts were referenced relative to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1sulfonic acid (DSS), and 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly via gyromagnetic ratios.
2D and 3D NMR spectra were analyzed using CARA (Keller, 2004).
Relaxation delays were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 seconds in 1D 15N T1 experiment, and
10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150 and 170 ms in 1D 15N T1 experiment acquired for 500 uM Skp1ΔF97E
sample. 1D T1/T2 relaxation data were processed and analyzed with VnmrJ v4.2 (Agilent Inc). Macro “tc”

(wiki.nesg.org) was used to integrate the regions between 1H chemical shifts of 8.8 and 9.9 ppm,
determine T1 and T2 relaxation times via exponential fitting and calculate global rotational correlation
time τc.
Sequence-specific backbone and side-chain resonance assignments for Skp1ΔΔ were derived using
CARA based on existing resonance assignments of full-length Skp1 (Xu et al., 2018). Structure
calculation of the Skp1ΔΔ homodimer was performed using CYANA (Güntert et al., 2015) based on
1
H-1H upper distance constraints derived from 13C/15N-edited [1H,1H]-NOESY, as well as backbone ϕ and
ψ and side-chain χ1 dihedral angle restraints from TALOS-N (Shen et al., 2013). Automated NOESY
peak assignment was performed initially with CYANA, with manually assigned intermolecular 1H-1H
upper distance constraints applied after cycle 2 of simulated annealing. These intermolecular 1H-1H upper
distance constraints were derived from ten selected strong peaks in a 13C/15N-filtered 13C/15N-edited
[1H,1H]-NOESY spectrum, that could be unambiguously assigned and could not be explained by
intramolecular contacts. After several rounds of interactive refinement of NOE peak assignments and
calibration of distance constraints, the final structure calculation was performed with CYANA. Out of 100
calculated conformers, 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were selected for subsequent
refinement in explicit water bath using the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with upper distance
constraints relaxed by 5%.
Dimer Interface Studies. Computational analyses were performed using the conformer with lowest
CYANA target function of the initial NMR structure of Skp1ΔΔ. To prevent inaccurate predictions due to
small clashes in the structure, the protein was prepared using the standard Rosetta optimization protocol,
“FastRelax” (Tyka et al., 2011; Das and Baker, 2008). Briefly, five cycles of rotamer packing and
minimization were carried out, ramping up the repulsive weight in the scoring function within each cycle.
After three rounds of symmetrical FastRelax with atom-atom pair distance constraints, the quality of the
generated models was validated with the Molprobity web service (Chen et al., 2010). The lowest scoring
structure based on the Rosetta energy score and the Molprobity score was selected for mutational
analysis.
To identify mutations that could disrupt the Skp1 dimerization, an all amino acids-scanning
mutagenesis was carried out across the homodimer interface in silico. The “flex ddG” protocol
implemented in RosettaScripts (Barlow et al., 2018; Fleishman et al., 2011) was used to model and
predict the effect of the mutations on the binding free energy of the complex. All parameters in the
protocol were set up according to the default values described previously (Barlow et al., 2018). Overall,
the flex ddG method takes advantage of the Rosetta backrub approach (Smith and Kortemme, 2008) to
sample side-chain and backbone conformational changes around the mutated position. Once the backrub
ensembles are generated, the structures are optimized by sidechain repacking and torsion minimization.
The interface ΔΔG score corresponds to the average difference in binding free energy between the mutant
structure and the wild-type complex. Stabilizing mutations are defined as those with interface ΔΔG scores
< −1.0 Rosetta energy units (REU), while destabilizing mutations are assigned to interface ΔΔG scores >
1.0 (Barlow et al., 2018).
To determine which dimer-destabilizing substitutions do not perturb the stability of the individual
monomers, the change in the total free energy of the monomer was estimated for all mutations. This
analysis was performed with the current state-of-the-art Rosetta ΔΔG protocol, “cartesian_ddg” (Park et
al., 2016). Prior to the simulations, the refined wild-type monomer was relaxed in Cartesian space,
constraining backbone and sidechain coordinates. The model with the lowest Rosetta score was then used
as input for the cartesian_ddg protocol. Within the cartesian_ddg application, the protein was relaxed
again in the Cartesian space, allowing movement of only the backbone and sidechains around the mutated
position (Park et al., 2016). All parameters in the method were configured as previously described (Park
et al., 2016). The total ΔΔG score was finally considered as the difference in the total ∆∆G between the
mutant and the wild-type monomer, multiplied by an energy scaling factor of 1.0/2.94. As above,
stabilizing mutations correspond to total ∆∆G scores < -1.0, and destabilizing mutations refer to total

∆∆G scores > 1.0.
All Rosetta commands for this report were run with the same Rosetta static executable
(RosettaCommons/main.git2019-03-07, version 4ab48a76160c888257155619edb9817845bd8a67). The
protocols previously described can be found at Supplementary information- Scripts.
Analytical Gel Filtration. Skp1Δ and Skp1ΔF97E with or without Fbs1 at a limiting concentration
were subjected to Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration analysis using Pharmacia SMARTSystem HPLC
as previously described (Sheikh et al., 2014).

RESULTS
Characterization of the Skp1 Dimer by Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Analytical centrifugation
was used to characterize Skp1 (native sequence) in solution at various concentrations (Figure 1A).
Sedimentation velocity experiments revealed peaks at 1.8 S and 2.7 S, which is consistent with predicted
S-value for monomer and dimer at 1.9 S and 2.8 S. Skp1 monomer and dimer peaks are independent of
loading concentrations suggesting that Skp1 dimerization undergoes a slow equilibrium on the time-scale
of sedimentation. The smaller S-values indicate that the homology model used for predicting S-values
were less compact. In the homology model, C-terminal region of Skp1 is modeled as a helix, as it is in
complex with F-box proteins. However, the C-terminal region of free Skp1 is, as suggested by previous
NMR studies, extended and unstructured having a predominantly disordered characteristic (Xu et al.,
2018). A Skp1 dimer binding isotherm was constructed using weighted s-values across protein
concentrations covering almost three orders of magnitude (0.5 – 45 µM), which yielded a dissociation
constant for the Skp1 dimer of 2.5 µM (Figure 1B).
Characterization of Skp1ΔΔ by NMR and solution NMR structure. To reduce spectral
complexity and avoid using perdeuterated samples, we utilized a truncated Skp1 variant, Skp1ΔΔ, which
lacks the mainly disordered C-terminal F-box binding domain and an internal disordered loop that is
frequently removed for Skp1/FBP crystallization (Figure 2A). We demonstrated that Skp1ΔΔ (118 x 2
amino acids) still forms a stable homodimer based on sedimentation velocity studies, which yielded an Svalue of 1.92 compared to the 1.90 value for a dimer predicted by Hydropro (Figure S2). Also, a 2D
[15N,1H] HSQC spectrum of Skp1ΔΔ correlated well with 2D [15N,1H] TROSY of full-length Skp1 (data
not shown), indicating that truncations in Skp1ΔΔ do not perturb the overall structure. Using a suite of
standard NMR experiments (wiki.nesg.org, Table S1) we obtained complete sequence-specific
assignments of backbone and side-chain 1H, 15N and 13C resonances.
Structure calculations were based on NOE peaks from 3D 15N- and 13C-edited [1H,1H] NOESY
spectra. Intermolecular NOE peaks were identified in a separate 13C/15N-filtered and 13C-edited [1H,1H]
NOESY spectrum recorded with a sample of mixed U-15N,13C-labeled and natural abundance Skp1. An
example of the NOE data is given in Figure S3. Not all intra-chain cross-peaks are filtered from the strip
on the right (13C/15N-filtered) because the isotope incorporation (~85%) was not as high as possible.
However, comparison to a strip from a more conventional set of 13C-edited data (strip on the left) shows
that certain peaks are of comparable intensity (inter-chain) and certain peaks are drastically reduced in the
filtered set (intra-chain). Ten intermolecular NOE peaks, which could be unambiguously assigned and
could not arise from intramolecular contacts, were converted to distance constraints and used to bootstrap
the structure calculation with the program CYANA. Using PISA (Krissenel, 2015), ten residues involved
in the packing of the interface were identified from calculated structures (Figure 2D). Cα traces of the 20
best models are shown in Figure 2B. The resulting structure of the Skp1ΔΔ dimer has a semi-parallel 2fold symmetry. The dimer interface is organized as a four-helix bundle, with symmetrical packing
contributions from residues of helices 5 & 6 of each chain, with a total surface area that buries ~700 Å2 of
predominantly hydrophobic surface (Figure 2C). A single dimer subunit was superimposed with that of
human Skp1 from a crystal structure in complex with an F-box protein (βTRCP, PDB ID: 6M90),
revealing a Cα atom RMSD of 1.4 Å (Figure S5). This suggests that the core structure of Skp1 in solution

is similarly folded to the functional state in a heterocomplex with an F-box protein.
The Skp1 homodimer was compared to a Skp1/FBP heterodimer complex to assess physical overlap
(Figures 2E, F). An F-box domain from a crystal structure (PDB ID: 5V4B) was modeled over Skp1∆∆
which revealed a ~600 Å overlap of interfaces in the region of helices 5 and 6. This explains why only the
Skp1 monomer is found in complexes with FBPs.
Conservation of the Dimer Interface. L96 to I123 is highly conserved throughout phylogeny. Each
of the dimer contact residues except K117 is almost perfectly conserved from stramenopiles to humans
(Figure S7), and region is immediately surrounded by Gly or Pro residues and length variations (indels),
indicating that this region represents a functional unit under selective pressure to remain intact. This is
consistent with the finding that human Skp1 also dimerizes in this concentration range (Henzl et al.,
2008).
Computationally-Guided Selection of a Skp1 Monomer Mutant F97E. To test the model, we
searched for point mutations to destabilize the dimer. To identify residues critical for Skp1 homodimer
stability, the Skp1 protein-protein interface was studied by computational scanning mutagenesis. An
initial exploration conducted by alanine-scanning led to the recognition of the residues Phe97, Leu101,
and Ile123, as potential destabilizing positions, as their substitution weakened the binding free energy of
the complex (interface ΔΔG score > 2) (Figure 3A). To further investigate the contribution of different
amino acids to this stability disruption, all 20 amino acids were mutated at each interface position. In
concordance with the alanine-scanning results, the positions 97, 101, and 123 represented energetically
susceptible positions, as different residue replacements impaired the binding free energy of the dimer
(Figure 3C). In particular, 85% of the variations at position 97 promoted interface ∆∆G scores greater
than 1.5. Overall, the mutations F97G, F97D and F97E showed the highest dimer-destabilizing effect,
with interface ∆∆G scores of 5.41, 5.23 and 4.87, respectively (Figure 3C).
To determine whether the dimer-destabilizing mutations would affect monomer stability, the total
monomer ∆∆G was estimated for each substitution. Remarkably, most of the mutations at positions 97,
101, and 123 presented total ∆∆G scores between 1 and -1 (Figure S6). Specifically, F97E, which could
destabilize dimerization, might have a neutral effect on the monomer stability with its ∆∆G score at 0.15.
Skp1ΔF97E is a Stable Monomer in Solution. Based on the above analysis, and to allow for
flexibility of the carboxyl group to avoid clashes when binding FBPs, the conserved Phe97 was changed
to Glu in Skp1Δ. Skp1ΔF97E eluted as a monomer based on gel filtration and was predominantly a
monomer by AUC at 100 µM (Figure 4A), which supports the interface model. A preliminary 2D
[1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum recorded for a 15N-labeled Skp1ΔF97E sample exhibited peak dispersion
consistent with a well-folded protein (Figure 4B), and the peak pattern was comparable to that of wildtype Skp1 considering that there are a number of differences including an N-terminal SM- extension,
replacement of 12 amino acids with 4 different amino acids in the internal loop, and truncation after
amino acid 125 (not shown). Based on average 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times measured for all 1H amide
resonances between 8.8 and 9.9 ppm in a 500 µM sample of Skp1ΔF97E, the effective rotational
correlation time (τc) was estimated at 9 ns. This number is consistent with Skp1ΔF97E remaining
monomeric even at high concentrations typical for solution NMR.
Skp1ΔF97E is Binding Competent with a Model FBP. Phe97 is conserved as a Phe or Tyr in
known Skp1s. Analysis of Skp1 in crystal structures of complexes with 3 FBPs (Tir1, βTRCP1, Fbs1)
shows that, compared to the homodimer, Phe (or Tyr) resides in a different rotamer state with solvent
exposure (not shown). This suggests that the F97E replacement will, though removing a peripheral
hydrophobic contact, not directly disrupt the FBP interaction. To test the functionality of Skp1ΔF97E, we
used a Superdex200 gel filtration column to examine the elution profile of Skp1 in the absence and
presence of Fbs1. As previously described (Sheikh et al., 2014) and replicated in Figure 4C, a mixture of

Skp1ΔF97E exhibited similar behavior. In addition, Skp1ΔF97E clearly eluted later than native Skp1,
consistent with its monomeric character as described by AUC and its rotational correlation time.

DISCUSSION
Our findings confirm that dimerization is a highly conserved property of Skp1, based on similar
dissociation constant values from organisms as phylogenetically distant as Dictyostelium and humans.
Their calculated Kd values range from 1.1 to 2.5 µM under in vitro conditions, though actual affinities in
the cell may vary. These values are similar to the predicted total monomer Skp1 concentration in a
mammalian cell line, ~2 µM (Reitsma et al., 2018). The significance of dimerization is suggested by the
exceptionally high degree of conservation of the contact residues (labeled D in Fig. S7), and its ability to
mask the hydrophobic character of interface.
The Skp1 dimer interface occupies ~700 Å2 of predominantly hydrophobic surface, a substantial area
that overlaps subsite-1 of its FBP binding site (Figure 2E). The corresponding region 99-130 in human
Skp1 (aa 93-124 in Dictyostelium Skp1, Figure S7) exhibited a paucity of NMR resonance assignments in
a recent study of human Skp1 (Kachariya et al., 2016), indicating potential effects of dimerization in
human Skp1. Our dimerization model for Skp1was supported by the predicted effect of an amino acid
substitution within the interface, F97E, to destabilize the interaction (Figure 4A) without unfolding the
protein (Figure 4B). Indeed, monomeric Skp1 maintained its ability to bind a model FBP, Fbs1 (Figure
4C, D), and was also competent to be hydroxylated and glycosylated (unpublished data). A further
contribution of the region beyond the dimer interface, which previous studies showed to possess intrinsic
disorder in the free dimer (Xu et al., 2018) but becomes ordered into a stereotypical triple-helical bundle
when complexed with any of several F-box proteins, seems unlikely.
Based on the new structure, the dimer interface also contributes to subsite-1 of the F-box binding
region of Skp1, which explains why Skp1 is a monomer in complexes with FBPs (Zimmerman et al.,
2010). Interestingly, 8 of the 13 alleles of Skp1 known to affect its function in budding and fission yeast
have point mutations located on this region (Bai et al., 1996; Connelly and Heiter, 1996; Beltrao et al.,
2012; Leber et al., 2018; Lehmann et al., 2004). However, the available evidence indicates that the Kd for
binding to Fbs1/OCP1 is at least two orders of magnitude smaller (Tan et al., 2008), and this, together
with evidence that the Skp1/FBP interaction is generally of very high affinity and indications that Skp1 is
not in great excess of FBPs in cells (Reitsma et al., 2018), does not support the idea that Skp1
dimerization is regulatory in cells. Our ability to selectively perturb dimerization relative to Fbs1 binding
using the F97E mutation might allow an investigation of this question in vivo; however, it is unclear
whether interaction with other FBPs, whose sequences are distinctive, will be similarly minimally
affected.
Chemical shift index analysis of assigned residues in human Skp1 (Kachariya et al., 2016) and
Dictyostelium Skp1 (Xu et al., 2018) indicated that the overall secondary structure elements of free Skp1
in dimer state were similar to one another and to human Skp1 in complexes with FBPs, except for the Cterminal F-box subsite-2 region which was predominantly disordered in free Skp1’s. The current study
demonstrates, for Dictyostelium Skp1 up through the dimer interface (through residue 125), that the
monomeric state assumes essentially the same structure as for human Skp1 bound to βTRCP with an
RMSD for the Cα atoms of 1.4Å (Figure S5). Thus interactions with proteins including Cul1
(Zimmerman et al., 2010) and Sgt1 (Willhoft et al., 2017), whose crystallographically defined binding
interfaces lie N-terminal to the dimer interface, might be unaffected by the dimer status of Skp1.
The two C-termini of the Skp1ΔΔ dimer lie close enough to one another in the semi-parallel
arrangement of the monomers that the missing C-terminal regions might influence each other’s
organization in the native protein. The availability of a stable monomeric form of Skp1 will allow a direct
NMR analysis of full length Skp1 and the consequences of its glycosylation, which is postulated to
influence the organization of F-box subsite-2 that was deleted in the form analyzed here.

in green and magenta. A 2-fold axis of rotational symmetry lies vertically between the subunits. (D)
Ribbon representation of a single Skp1ΔΔ with the side chains of selected residues involved in close (<5
