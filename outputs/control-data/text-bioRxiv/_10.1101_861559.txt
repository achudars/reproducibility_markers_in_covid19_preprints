Abstract Animals exhibit behavioral and neural responses that persist on longer time scales
than transient or ﬂuctuating stimulus inputs. Here, we report that C. elegans uses corollary
discharge to sustain motor responses during thermotactic navigation. By imaging circuit activity in
behaving animals, we show that a principal postsynaptic partner of the AFD thermosensory neuron,
the AIY interneuron, encodes both temperature and motor state information. By optogenetic and
genetic manipulation of this circuit, we demonstrate that the motor state representation in AIY is a
corollary discharge signal. RIM, an interneuron that is connected with premotor interneurons, is
required for corollary discharge. Ablation of RIM eliminates the motor representation in AIY, allows
thermosensory representations to reach downstream premotor interneurons, and reduces the
animal’s ability to sustain forward movements during thermotaxis. We propose that corollary
discharge underlies a positive feedback mechanism to generate persistent neural activity and
sustained behavioral patterns in a sensorimotor transformation.

Introduction
Behavioral states often persist over longer timescales than their initiating sensory stimuli (Bidaye
et al., 2014; Hoopfer et al., 2015). For example, ﬁsh continue to ﬁxate their gaze on light after the
onset of darkness (Seung, 1996; Aksay et al., 2007). A brief aversive stimulus evokes prolonged
escape responses in many species (Li et al., 2006; Herberholz et al., 2002). Lasting behavioral
states require circuit mechanisms to turn a transient stimulus into persistent neuronal activity
(Lee and Dan, 2012; Major and Tank, 2004). One circuit topology that can produce persistent
neural activity is positive feedback (Seung, 1996). However, establishing causality between positive
feedback, persistent neural activity, and sustained behavior states has been challenging because of
the technical diﬃculties in experimentally dissecting neural activities across entire sensorimotor
pathways.
The compact nervous system and optical accessibility of C. elegans make it possible to explore
molecular and circuit mechanisms that underlie persistent neural activities and sustained behavioral
states in intact animals (Gao et al., 2015). C. elegans requires persistent motor states to navigate
variable sensory environments. During locomotion, the animal alternates between sustained
forward movements and short reversals. When navigating through a chemical or thermal gradient,

C. elegans exhibits biased random walks, extending forward runs towards preferred environments
(Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999; Ryu and Samuel, 2002; Ino and Yoshida, 2009). C. elegans can also
exhibit klinotaxis, the gradual steering of heading angles during forward movements towards
preferred directions (Ward, 1973; Ino and Yoshida, 2009). C. elegans employs both biased random
walk and head steering (Hedgecock and Russell, 1975; Mori and Ohshima, 1995; Luo et al., 2014a)
to actively move up or down a temperature gradient towards preferred temperatures – positive or
negative thermotaxis, respectively.
The C. elegans wiring diagram has a layered organization (White et al., 1986) (Figure 2B). Sensory
neurons communicate with ﬁrst layer interneurons. Second layer interneurons communicate
with head motor neurons and premotor interneurons that regulate body undulation. AFD is
the thermosensory neuron that mediates both positive and negative thermotaxis (Luo et al.,
2014a; Hawk et al., 2018). Its principal chemical synaptic partner, AIY, is the ﬁrst layer interneuron
speciﬁcally required for positive thermotaxis. Inactivation or ablation of AIY causes animals to
exhibit negative thermotaxis at all temperatures (Mori and Ohshima, 1995; Hobert et al., 1997).
AIY responds to temperature variations due to signaling from AFD (Clark et al., 2006; Narayan
et al., 2011; Hawk et al., 2018). Excitatory synapses from AFD to AIY reliably transmit AFD’s activity
pattern into scaled AIY dynamics (Narayan et al., 2011). AIY is postsynaptic to multiple sensory
neurons, and is thought to play a role in navigation across different sensory modalities by controlling
the duration of forward runs (Gray et al., 2005; Wakabayashi et al., 2004; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).
AIY has also been shown to regulate the speed and direction of locomotion (Li et al., 2014; Kocabas
et al., 2012).
We probed mechanisms by which AIY biases random walks during positive thermotaxis. Our
calcium imaging of AIY in moving animals reveals that AIY encodes both temperature and motor
information. Consistent with a previous report (Luo et al., 2014b), we show that AIY activity rises at
the onset of forward runs and falls at the onset of reversals. But we further reveal that whether AIY
encodes the thermosensory input from the AFD neuron depends on motor state. During forward
runs, AIY activity follows AFD activity, rising during warming and falling during cooling. During
reversals, AIY does not encode AFD thermosensory input. We demonstrate that the motor state
representation in AIY reﬂects corollary discharge (CD), a copy of the motor command. Corollary
discharge to AIY requires RIM, an interneuron that is connected with both the forward and reversal
premotor circuit. In the absence of RIM, AIY encodes thermosensory input from AFD regardless
of motor state. Moreover, weak thermosensory representations appeared in some premotor
interneurons. At the behavioral level, absence of RIM causes positive thermotaxis to be disrupted
by reduced ability to sustain forward movement up temperature gradients. These experimental
results support a minimal phenomenological model where both warming and corollary discharge
reinforce and sustain the forward motor state in a biased random walk. Therefore, in C. elegans,
motor state shapes sensory processing by feedback from premotor interneurons to ﬁrst layer
interneurons. Our results establish a role for corollary discharge in sustaining a motor state despite
variable or ﬂuctuating sensory environments.

Sustained forward movements across thermal ﬂuctuations in positive thermotaxis
C. elegans navigates towards temperatures that correspond to prior thermal experience. To evoke
positive thermotaxis, we placed young adults cultivated at 25°C on a linear thermal gradient spanning 19 to 23°C (Figure 1). Consistent with earlier reports, these animals exhibited biased random
walk and klinotaxis towards warmer temperatures (Figure 1B) ((Luo et al., 2014a; Yamaguchi et al.,
2018)): runs that pointed in favorable directions were lengthened (Figure 1B; forward heading
angles gradually reoriented towards temperatures that correspond to prior experience (Figure 1B).
Without a temperature gradient, there was no evident modulation of either run length or heading
angle (Figure 1B).

Individual trajectories during positive thermotaxis revealed periods of forward movement that
carry the animal up the temperature gradient. Although these periods of forward movement are
persistent in duration, they are not always persistent in direction (Figure 1C). C. elegans experiences
temporal changes in temperature on spatial gradients because of its own movements. Because of
changes in movement direction, most runs – even those that orient the animal towards warmer
temperatures – will typically involve detection of both warming and cooling stimuli (Figure 1D). Thus,
C. elegans has an ability to sustain forward movement up temperature gradients across transient
cooling ﬂuctuations.

We sought circuit mechanisms for sustaining forward movement up temperature gradients despite
thermal ﬂuctuations.
First, we measured the activity of the AFD thermosensory neuron and AIY, its principle postsynaptic partner, by calcium imaging in moving animals. Subjected to oscillating temperatures below
the preferred temperature, C. elegans exhibits positive thermotaxis. As previously reported (Clark
et al., 2006, 2007), AFD’s activity phase locks to periodic variations in temperatures, rising upon
warming and falling upon cooling (Figure 2A). The power spectrum of AFD activity shows a strong
peak corresponding to the frequency of thermal oscillation (Figure 2A). AFD activity showed no
strong correlation with the motor state (Figure 2) (Spearman’s 𝜌<0.1, N = 6), indicating that motor
commands arise downstream of the thermosensory neuron.
To understand the activity patterns of AIY, we simultaneously monitored AIY calcium dynamics
along with components of the motor circuit known to code forward and reversal motor states
(Figure 2B,C). We found that AIY encodes both motor and temperature information. During forward
movements, AIY’s calcium activity phase locked to temperature changes, increasing upon warming
and decreasing upon cooling (Figure 2D). This response was attenuated during reversals (Figure 2D).
As a result, the frequency of temperature oscillations is less well represented in the power spectrum
of AIY activity than that of AFD (p<0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; N = 6) (Figure 2D).
Unlike AFD and AIY, all motor circuit neurons that we examined strictly encode motor information
during thermosensory stimulation. The AVA premotor interneuron is active during and regulates
backward movement (Chalﬁe et al., 1985; Kawano et al., 2011; McCormick et al., 2011; Kato et al.,
2015) (Figure 2B). In animals subjected to oscillating thermosensory stimulation, AVA calcium
activity exhibited high and low states that correlated with backward and forward movement,
respectively (Figure 2D). We detected no representation of the stimulus frequency in the power
spectrum of AVA’s activity pattern (p>0.1, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, N = 5, Figure 2D). Similarly, during
thermosensory stimulation, the RME and SMD head motor neurons exhibited both high and low
states that coincided with animal’s directional movements (Figure 2D), as reported in previous
studies (Hendricks, 2012). The power spectra of RME and SMD activity patterns also revealed no
representation of thermosensory input (Figure 2D).
For positive thermotaxis, the sensorimotor transformation progresses through three layers
(Figure 2B): the ﬁrst layer encodes only thermal stimuli; the ﬁrst layer interneuron encodes both
thermal stimuli and motor states; the premotor and motor layer encode only motor states.

Motor coding in AIY is a corollary discharge signal that requires the RIM interneuron
Our ﬁnding that AIY encodes thermal information in a manner that depends on motor state suggests
a critical role in sensorimotor transformations during positive thermotaxis. In animals exposed
to either constant or oscillating temperatures, AIY activity consistently rises at the beginning of
forward runs and decays at the onset of reversals (Figure 3). How does AIY, a ﬁrst order interneuron,
acquire a motor signal?
We explored the possibility that proprioception, elicited by movement itself, underlies the
calcium response in AIY. We imaged the thermosensory circuit activity in immobilized animals

subjected to constant temperature. As in moving animals, AIY’s activity remained anti-correlated
with neurons active during reversals (AVA) and correlated with neurons active during forward
movement (RME and SMDD/V) (Figure 2–Figure Supplement 1). C. elegans movement is not required
for AIY activity to reﬂect motor state, arguing against proprioception.
We also tested whether motor commands are generated by AIY and transmitted to the premotor
and motor circuits. We imaged AIY’s activity upon blocking its chemical synaptic transmission by
AIY-speciﬁc expression of tetanus toxin (TeTx) (Figure 3B). Without chemical synaptic output, AIY
activity remained strongly coupled to the motor state, implying that AIY must receive the motor
state signal.
We asked whether AIY receives corollary discharge from neurons that encode the motor command. We imaged AIY activity in moving animals upon ablation of AIY’s downstream interneurons
and premotor interneurons (Figure 4A). For interneurons, we focused on AIB and RIM. AIB shares
electrical synapses with RIM and the AFD thermosensory neuron (White et al., 1986). In the context
of chemotaxis, AIB and RIM have been shown to regulate variability in the neuronal and behavioral response to olfactory inputs (Gordus et al., 2015). We also tested AVA and AVB, premotor
interneurons that regulate reversal and forward movement, respectively. Ablations were performed
by expressing ﬂavoprotein miniSOG, which induces acute functional loss and neuronal death by
photoactivation (Qi et al., 2012).
We found that ablating AIB did not remove the motor state representation in AIY (Figure 4B, D).
Neither did the removal of the premotor interneurons AVA or AVB alone (Figure 4B). However, AIY
lost its motor state representation when we ablated RIM, either by itself or in combination with
other premotor interneurons (Figure 4B, C).
RIM activity has been shown to be correlated with the AVA premotor interneuron that promotes
reversals and anti-correlated with the AVB premotor interneuron that promotes forward movement
(Kawano et al., 2011). To further probe whether RIM is required for the motor state signal to appear
in AIY, we optogenetically activated either AVA or AVB while simultaneously measuring AIY calcium
activity in immobilized animals. Activation of AVA using the light-gated opsin chrimson (Klapoetke
et al., 2014) triggered a decrease in AIY calcium levels. Activation of AVB triggered an increase in
AIY calcium levels Figure 4E). When RIM was ablated, AIY calcium signals no longer responded to
optogenetic activation of either AVA or AVB, suggesting that RIM is part of the CD pathway from the
motor circuit to AIY. Without RIM, AIY activity no longer reﬂected or depended on the motor state,
but the premotor interneurons AVA and head motor neurons RME and RMD continued to encode
for the backward and forward movement, albeit with reduced bimodal activity (Figure 5A,B). Thus,
RIM is not essential for generating motor commands, but is necessary to relay motor information
to AIY, a ﬁrst layer interneuron.

RIM-mediated corollary discharge does not depend on chemical synaptic transmission
We sought synaptic mechanisms by which RIM may contribute to the CD pathway. RIM expresses
VGLUT3/EAT-4, indicating the potential involvement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. RIM
also synthesizes tyramine (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013), a monoamine neuromodulator (Alkema et al.,
2005). We imaged AIY activity in loss-of-function mutants for glutamatergic signaling (VGLUT3/eat4), tyramine synthesis (TDC/tdc-1), vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT/cat-1) and peptidergic
signaling (CAPS/unc-31). We found that AIY activity remained coupled to motor state in all mutants,
but the difference in AIY activity between the backward and forward states was less distinct in
mutants defective for vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT/cat-1) or tyramine synthesis (TDC/tdc-1)
(Figure 5C,D). This effect was similar to when we blocked RIM neurotransmitter release by TeTx
(Ptdc-1::TeTx) (Figure 5C,D).
Since perturbation of chemical synaptic transmission did not abolish motor-related activity in
AIY, neuronal communication that is independent of classic chemical synaptic transmission plays
roles in relying corollary discharge to AIY. As previously reported (Kawano et al., 2011; Kato et al.,

2015; Gordus et al., 2015), RIM activity is strongly correlated with the AVA premotor interneuron,
higher during reversals and lower during forward movement. AIY, on the other hand, exhibits
increased activity during forward movement (Figure 3). Therefore, the corollary discharge signal
must undergo sign reversal when propagated from RIM to AIY. Our observations suggest that the
joint representation of sensory and motor signals in AIY arises from separate sources: feedforward
input from AFD and feedback from the motor circuit that is conveyed through RIM.

A role for RIM-dependent corollary discharge during positive thermotaxis
RIM plays a critical role in the motor state dependent modulation of AIY calcium activity. This
prompted us to examine the effect of disrupting the CD signal on sensorimotor transformations
in behaving animals. When RIM-ablated animals were subjected to oscillating temperatures,
AIY activity was no longer coupled to the motor state, but instead reliably tracked temperature
ﬂuctuations during both forward and backward movements (Figure 6). The stronger representation
of an oscillating temperature in AIY activity was evident in its power spectrum (Figure 6A, B; p<0.001
Wilcoxon rank sum test). When RIM was ablated, we were also able to detect the representation
of thermosensory oscillations in the activity pattern of the AVA premotor interneuron and the
SMDD head motor neuron (Figure 6). This observation suggests that the loss of the RIM-dependent
CD signal resulted in a sensorimotor circuit that becomes more susceptible to ﬂuctuations in
thermosensory input. Without RIM and the CD signal to AIY, thermosensory representations of
ﬂuctuating inputs can reach the motor circuit. The CD signal may thus play an important role in
sustaining motor outputs across rapidly varying sensory inputs.
We tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of RIM ablation on positive thermotaxis
(Figure 6D). These animals were speciﬁcally defective in their ability to sustain forward locomotion
when moving up the thermal gradient (Figure 6E). The gradual heading angle reorientation during a
forward run remained intact (Figure 6F). Thus, the thermotaxis defect of RIM ablated animals is a
disruption in the ability to sustain forward runs up temperature gradients.

Agent-based simulations driven by a reduced model recapitulate the role of CD
feedback in positive thermotaxis
To illustrate how corollary discharge could contribute to sustained motor states during thermotaxis,
we built a minimal phenomenological model of the thermotaxis circuit (Figure 7). In this model,
temperature ﬂuctuations encoded by a thermosensory neuron is conveyed to a downstream
interneuron. The interneuron outputs to a motor command circuit that determines the motor state.
A copy of the motor command is relayed back to the interneuron in a manner that reinforces the
ongoing motor state, effectively forming a positive feedback loop. When exposed to ﬂuctuating
inputs, this circuit transitioned between two stable states at time scales much longer than the input
signal (Figure 7B).
We used this circuit model to simulate animal locomotion along linear thermal gradients (Figure 7C). The model with strong corollary discharge most effectively drove migration up the temperature gradient. In this case, forward runs up the temperature gradient were substantially longer than
those down the gradient (Figure 7D,E). Decreasing the strength of corollary discharge lessened the
dependence of run length on run direction, and led to less eﬃcient and less reliable thermotaxis
(Figure 7C, D, E).

Discussion
Positive feedback as a circuit topology has been proposed to sustain neural activity patterns (Seung,
1996; Major and Tank, 2004). Here, we uncovered a role for corollary discharge, a feedback signal
from the motor circuit, in sustaining a neural state for forward locomotion. By relaying a motor
command to a ﬁrst layer interneuron in the sensorimotor pathway, this circuitry couples warming
signals with forward motor state signals. These signals reinforce each another, leading to sustained

periods of forward movement up temperature gradients. Sustained neural activity states allow the
animal to ﬁlter rapid ﬂuctuations in sensory input from affecting motor behavior, thereby enabling
persistent behavioral outputs.
Emerging evidence from across species indicates that motor states can signiﬁcantly impact
sensory processing (Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015; Fu et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2014; Zagha et al.,
2013; Petreanu et al., 2009; Ouellette et al., 2018). An explicit dependence of sensory encoding on
behavioral states may contribute to observed variability in stimulus-evoked behavioral responses.
In C. elegans chemotaxis, variability in neuronal and behavioral responses has been linked to the RIM
interneuron. The AWC olfactory neuron reliably responds to olfactory inputs, but its downstream
partner, the AIB interneuron, responds less reliably. Ablation of RIM reduces the variability in the
AIB response. One interpretation of the role of RIM in the olfactory circuit is that it enhances the
variability of a probabilistic sensorimotor transformation during the biased random walk towards
chemoattractants (Gordus et al., 2015). By studying the circuit in moving animals, our results
favor the interpretation for a different role for RIM. During thermotaxis, RIM allows AIY, a ﬁrst-layer
interneuron, to generate response variability that is not stochastic but directly correlated with motor
state. This observation underscores the importance of measuring sensorimotor transformations in
behaving animals where feedback loops are active.
The motor state signal in the AIY interneuron requires the RIM interneuron. We do not know
the synaptic mechanism by which the corollary discharge reaches AIY. One possibility is that it
employs synaptic transmission-independent mechanisms and/or indirect feedback circuits from
RIM to AIY. More extensive molecular and cellular dissection is needed to understand how the
corollary discharge signal reaches AIY (Figure 2). Ablation of RIM not only eliminates the motor
state representation in AIY, but also leads to increased thermosensory representation in the
activity patterns of downstream neurons. Thus, the positive feedback provided to the ﬁrst layer
interneuron contributes to the separation of sensory input patterns in sensory neurons from motor
output patterns in premotor interneurons. Behaviorally, it enhances the stability of a motor state
that carries the animal up temperature gradients during positive thermotaxis, an interpretation
supported by agent-based modeling (Figure 7).
In conclusion, our ﬁndings reveal a new role for corollary discharge. In C. elegans thermotaxis,
corollary discharge promotes sustained neural responses to thermal stimuli and stabilizes a motor
state, enhancing the eﬃciency of thermotactic navigation.

Molecular biology and transgenic strain construction
Promoters
The following promoters were used to allow neuron-speciﬁc expression of a calcium sensor, chrimson, and miniSOG. Most were generated from genomic DNA isolated from mixed stage N2 animals.
Promoters include 4.8 kb (Prig-3), 0.9 kb (Pinx-1), 5.3 kb (Pglr-1), 2.9 kb (Pcex-1), 0.86 kb (Plgc-55B),
3.1 kb (Pnmr-1) genomic sequence. All promoters except Pnmr-1 and Plgc-55B used the genomic
sequence of the respective length starting immediately upstream of the predicted ATG start codon
of the respective genes. For Pnmr-1, a 2 kb internal fragment which reduces the 5.1kb nmr-1
reporter expression was removed (Kawano et al., 2011). Details on Plgc-55B can be found in (Gao
et al., 2015).

Calcium imaging
For AIY calcium imaging, aeaIs003 was generated by integrating olaEx1621 [Pmod-1::GCaMP6s; Pttx3::RFP; Punc-122::mCherry]). The integrant was outcrossed against N2 for 4 times to generate strain
ADS003, and crossed into lite-1 to generate QW1410.
For AFD calcium imaging, aeaIs004 was generated by integrating an existing Ex line [Pgcy8::GCaMP6s; Pgcy-8::RFP; Punc-122::mCherry]. The integrant was outcrossed against N2 for 4 times to
generate strain ADS004.

For premotor interneuron and motor neuron calcium imaging, pJH3338 was constructed for
calcium imaging for premotor interneurons and head motor neurons. The GCaMP6s reporter
was optimized for C. elegans and contained three C. elegans introns (Lim et al., 2016; Chen et al.,
2013). GCaMP6s was fused with codon-optimized mCherry (wCherry) at the C-terminus to facilitate
ratiometric measurement via simultaneous imaging of GFP and RFP. The reporter expression was
driven by Pglr-1 as described above. This construct was co-injected with lin-15(+) marker to lin15(n765) animals to generate extrachromosomal transgenic array hpEx3550, and subsequently
integrated to generate hpIs471. The integrated array was outcrossed against N2 wild-type 4 times to
generate ZM8558. For simultaneous AIY and premoter/interneuron imaging, hpIs471 was crossed
with aeaIs003 to generate ADS027.

Neuron ablation
pJH2829, pJH3311, pJH2931, pJH2890, and pJH2827 were constructed for LED-based neuronal
ablation for RIM, AIB, AVA (plus other neurons), AVB (plus other neurons), and AVA/AVE/AVD/RIM/PVC
(plus other neurons), respectively. miniSOG fused with an outer mitochondrial membrane tag
TOMM20 (tomm20-miniSOG or mito-miniSOG) (Qi et al., 2012; Shu et al., 2011). An inter-cistronic
sequence splice leader (SL2) was inserted between the coding sequence of tomm20-miniSOG and
codon-optimized mCherry (wCherry; a gift of A. Desai, UCSD) to visualize neurons that express
miniSOG, and to examine the eﬃcacy of ablation. SL2 sequence was PCR ampliﬁed off the splice
leader sequence (SL2) between gpd-2 and gpd-3. These constructs were co-injected with the lin-15(+)
marker in lin-15(n765) animals to generate extrachromosomal arrays hpEx2997, hpEx3464, hpEx3072,
hpEx3064, and hpEx2940, respectively. With the exception of hpEx3072, other arrays were integrated
to generate hpIs327, hpIs465, hpIs331, and hpIs321. All integrated transgenic arrays were outcrossed
4 times against N2, except hpIs327, which was outcrossed 7 times against N2, before being used for
behavioral analyses or to be combined with AIY calcium imaging analyses, or, behavioral analyses.

AIY imaging upon neuronal ablation
aeaIs003 was crossed with hpIs327, hpIs321, hpEx3072, hpIs331, and hpIs465, respectively, to generate
ADS010, ADS014, ADS026, ADS036 and ADS046. They were used for AIY calcium imaging upon
ablation of RIM, premotor interneurons (with a few other neurons), and AIB, respectively.

AIY calcium imaging upon genetic manipulation of synaptic transmission and optogenetic
stimulation
For AIY imaging in genetic synaptic transmission mutants, QW1408, QW1409, QW1411, QW1175,
and QW1415 were generated by crossing aeaIs003 into the corresponding mutant backgrounds
listed in Supplemental Table 1.
For AIY imaging upon cell-type speciﬁc manipulation of synaptic transmission, aeaIs003 was
crossed with yxIs25, xuEx1414, and kyEx4962 to generate ADS043, ADS042, and ADS013, respectively
(Li et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2005; Gordus et al., 2015).
Chrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014) was codon-optimized and fused at C-terminus with wCherry
as described (Lim et al., 2016). Chrimson expression was driven by Plgc-55B and Prig-3 to generate
pHR2 and pHR6. These constructs were co-injected with Pges-1::GFP into QW1410 to generate
aeaEx003 (ADS29) and aeaEx005 (ADS31), for AIY imaging upon optogenetic stimulation of AVB and
AVA, respectively.
aeaEx003 and aeaEx005 were then crossed into hpIs327;aeaIs003;lite-1 to generate ADS033 and
ADS035 for AIY calcium imaging in RIM ablated animals, upon AVB and AVA stimulation, respectively.

Behavioral assays

L4 animals were cultivated at 25°C the night before the assay. On the day of the experiment, the
behavioral arena was allowed to equilibrate until a stable linear thermal gradient spanning 19°C to

23°C was established. Before each assay session, a thin layer of NGM agar sized 20 cm on each side
was placed on the arena and allowed to equilibrate to the temperature of the arena. Twenty young
adults were collected from their cultivation plates and brieﬂy washed in NGM buffer before they
were transferred onto the thin agar. These animals were allowed to explore the assay environment
for 5 minutes before behavioral recording starts. Afterwards, a CMOS camera positioned above
the arena recorded continuously every 500 milliseconds for 20 minutes. Animal trajectories were
extracted from the raw behavioral recordings using custom-written LABVIEW software. Subsequent
analyses were performed in MATLAB.

Spontaneous locomotion assay
Animals were cultivated and prepared for behavioral assay in identical manners as for the positive
thermotaxis assay. The same behavioral arena, equilibrate to room temperature (22°C), was used
to assay spontaneous locomotion. Behavioral recordings were conducted the same way as in
the positive thermotaxis assay. Subsequent analyses were performed using the same LABVIEW
software as above and subsequently in MATLAB.

Calculation of thermotactic bias
For each animal, the instantaneous velocity (𝑣) and speed (|𝑣|) were calculated from the animal’s
centroid positions. The velocity vector was then projected onto direction of the thermal gradient,
which in this case was parallel to the negative direction of the x-axis of the behavior arena. The
thermotactic bias as the ratio between the velocity projection along the thermal gradient and the
instantaneous speed of the animal:

Calcium imaging
Sample preparation and imaging setup
L4 larval animals expressing cytosolic GCaMP6s::wCherry were cultivated at 25°C the night before
the imaging experiment. Immediately before the imaging session, animals were transferred to a
microscope slide with a 5% agarose pad ( 2 mm thick). A small drop of NGM buffer was added
to the agarose pad and a # 1 coverslip was lowered onto the pad where animals could execute
forward runs and reversals in a restricted area. Calcium imaging was performed on an upright
spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse LV100 and Yokogawa CSU22) and iXon3 DU-897
EMCCD camera (Andor). High resolution images were collected through a 40x, 0.95 NA Nikon Plan
Apo lambda objective. 3D volumetric stacks were acquired in both the green (GCaMP6s) and red
(wCherry) channels with an exposure of 30 ms at approximately 1.2 volumes per second.

Control of thermal stimulation
Animals were imaged on a custom-built temperature control stage where a PID controller and
H-bridge ampliﬁer (Accuthermo) drove a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) (Newark) that pumped heat
into and out of a thin copper plate with a liquid-cooled water block (Swiftech) acting as a thermal reservoir. A type-T thermocouple microprobe (Physitemp) was placed on the copper plate
underneath a thin steel tab. A custom written Labview program was used to specify the desired
temperature waveform.

Extraction of calcium transient levels
To extract ﬂuorescence intensities for individual neurons, we identiﬁed connected regions above a
predeﬁned intensity threshold and registered these regions of interest across a movie based on
spatial proximity across frames. The activity level of each neuron was deﬁned by Δ𝑅(𝑡)∕𝑅0 where
𝑅(𝑡) is the ratio between the GCaMP6s intensity and the wCherry intensity at time point 𝑡, and 𝑅0 is
deﬁned as the median of the lowest ten 𝑅(𝑡) values in the time series.

Optogenetic stimulation and simultaneous calcium imaging

385

Experimental animals expressing Chrimson were grown on NGM plates supplied with 5 µM all-trans
retinal (ATR) mixed with OP50 bacteria. Control animals of the same genotypes were grown on
NGM plates seeded with OP50 without ATR. The day before the experiment, L4 animals were picked
onto fresh plates (with ATR for the experimental groups and without ATR for the control groups). On
the day of the experiment, young adult animals were prepared for imaging in the semi-constrained
preparation as described above. During imaging, pulses of red light were delivered from a ﬁltered
white LED lamp. Pulse timing was controlled by MATLAB scripts. For calcium imaging, animals were
illuminated with only the blue laser (488 nm) to avoid strong activation of Chrimson.

Transgenic animals expressing miniSOG were collected from late L1 to L2 stage onto a small NGM
plate (3.5 cm diameter). The plate was placed under a blue LED spotlight (Mightex, peak wavelength
617 nm) for 40 minutes. Following illumination, the animals were allowed to recover for overnight at
15°C to examine the disappearance of cells. All ablation was performed using animals that carried
integrated miniSOG transgens, with the exception for AVA ablation. Ablation of AVA was carried out
in animals that carried an extrachromsomal array for Prig-3-miniSOG-SL2-RFP, which was subjected
to random loss during somatic division. Animals used for ablation were selected for those that did
not show expression (hence ablation) in a pharyngeal neuron that affects the survival of ablated
animals.

Statistical analysis
Statistical tests
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used in the following comparisons: 1) comparing calcium activity
upon the initiation of forward runs or reversals between wild type animals and various neuronablation experiments, 2) comparing the probability of change in AIY activity upon the initiation of
forward run or reversals between wild type and AIY::TeTX animals, 3) comparing the thermotactic
bias between wild type and RIM ablated animals. To control for multiple comparison, p values were
adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. 95% conﬁdence intervals were determined by
bootstrapping.
Power spectral density for each calcium activity time series was estimated by ﬁrst subtracting
the mean of the time series, then applying Fourier transform using the fft function in MATLAB, and
taking the square of the resulting values.
The bimodality coeﬃcient (BC) was calculated as:

where 𝑚3 is the skewness of the distribution, 𝑚4 is the excess kurtosis, and 𝑛 the sample size.

Modeling of circuit activity and behavior
Neural circuit model
We use a reduced model to capture the interaction between the three key components of the
thermotaxis circuit: 𝑉1 (𝑡), the activity of the AFD thermosensory neuron; 𝑉2 (𝑡), the activity of the AIY
interneuron; 𝑉3 (𝑡), motor circuit activity. A leaky integrator model that captures the dynamics of
these interconnected circuits (Figure 7A) is given by a set of coupled equations:

Previous studies have shown that, at temperatures close to the prior cultivation temperature,
AFD activity reliably reports the temporal derivative of the ambient temperature. To simplify the
model and focus on the role of positive feedback in the circuit, we approximated AFD activity by its

Simulation of thermotaxis behavior
To simulate behavior, we model the locomotory state of the animal, 𝑆, as a function of the net
activity of the motor circuit:
(

𝑆(𝑡) = 𝑠𝑔𝑛 𝑉3 (𝑡)

433
434
435

where 𝑆(𝑡) ≥ 0 is deﬁned as the forward run state and 𝑆(𝑡) < 0 is deﬁned as the reversal state.
During an ongoing forward run or reversal, the heading direction, 𝜃(𝑡), remains constant. At the
start of each forward run, the new heading direction is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution
with range 0 − ±180°. When a forward run ends and a reversal state starts, the heading direction
changes by 180°:

𝑆(𝑡) = 1 and 𝑆(𝑡 − 𝑑𝑡) = −1
𝑆(𝑡) = −1 and 𝑆(𝑡 − 𝑑𝑡) = 1

To isolate the effect of corollary discharge on the duration of behavioral states, all animals are
simulated to move at constant speed (1 unit length per time step).
The stimulus environment is also chosen to simulate experimental conditions. A linear thermal
gradient along the 𝑥 direction is set by 𝑇 (𝑥) = 𝑐𝑇 𝑥.

Each simulation is initialized by setting an starting position of (0,0), an initial heading angle
drawn from the uniform distribution from 0 − ±180 °, and by setting the animal in a forward run
state, 𝑉2 (𝑡0 ) = 1 and 𝑉3 (𝑡0 ) = 1. Upon numerical integration, simulated worms move autonomously
in their environment for a predetermined duration (𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 ).
In the behavior simulations used to generate the data shown in Figure 7, we have assumed that
the animal’s direction of locomotion does not change during the forward run. This simpliﬁcation
is motivated by the observation that RIM ablation speciﬁcally disrupts the modulation of run
duration, while leaving the modulation of run direction intact. Since the latter is likely controlled
by neural circuitry not modeled here, we chose to focus on the modulation of run duration during
thermotaxis.
