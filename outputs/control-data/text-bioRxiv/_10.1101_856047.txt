Abstract

26

Pyocin S5 (PyoS5) is a potent protein bacteriocin that eradicates the human pathogen P.

27

aeruginosa in animal infection models, but its import mechanism is poorly understood. Here,

28

using crystallography, biophysical and biochemical analysis and live-cell imaging, we define

29

the entry process of PyoS5 and reveal links to the transport mechanisms of other

30

bacteriocins. In addition to its C-terminal pore-forming domain, elongated PyoS5 comprises

31

two novel tandemly repeated kinked three helix bundle domains that structure-based

32

alignments identify as key import domains in other pyocins. The central domain binds the

33

lipid-bound common polysaccharide antigen, allowing the pyocin to accumulate on the cell

34

surface.

35

associated disordered region binds the inner membrane protein TonB1, which together drive

36

import of the bacteriocin across the outer membrane. Finally, we identify the minimal

37

requirements for sensitizing Escherichia coli towards PyoS5, as well as other pyocins, and

38

suggest that a generic pathway likely underpins the import of all TonB-dependent

39

bacteriocins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

The N-terminal domain binds the ferric pyochelin transporter FptA while its

Introduction

44

Bacteria living within communities do so through cooperation and antagonism. Forms of

45

antagonism involving one bacterium killing another are important for maintaining the stable

46

co-existence of bacteria within microbiomes deployed by pathogens and commensals alike

47

to kill competitors (Granato et al, 2019). Antagonism occurs via several routes, the most

48

common being bacteriocins, contact-dependent inhibition or type VI secretion. Of these,

49

only the release of bacteriocins does not rely on physical contact between bacterial cells.

50

Bacteriocin production generally occurs following a stress signal, such as DNA damage,

51

inducing expression and release of the bacteriocin from auto-lysed cells (Kleanthous, 2010).

52

The bacteriocin then diffuses through the medium to kill a neighbouring cell. Bacteriocins

53

range in size, from small peptides to large proteins with both types currently being

54

evaluated/developed as antimicrobials against multidrug resistant bacteria (Rios et al, 2016;

55

Behrens et al, 2017). In many instances, however, developments are hindered by a lack of

56

understanding as to how these molecules work.

57

extensive sequence diversification and homologous recombination further hamper efforts to

58

find generic mechanisms of uptake. Here, we focus on the uptake mechanism of PyoS5, a

59

protein bacteriocin that specifically targets the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa

60

and shown recently in animal models to be more effective at clearing lung infections than

61

tobramycin, the antibiotic generally used to treat P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients

62

(McCaughey et al, 2016b). Through a structure-led approach, we deconstruct the energised

63

uptake pathway of PyoS5 and show that its transport across the outer membrane likely

64

represents the default pathway for all TonB-dependent bacteriocins.

In the case of protein bacteriocins,

65

There is a pressing need for new antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria but in

66

particular P. aeruginosa which has been designated a priority pathogen (WHO, 2017). The

67

intrinsic low permeability of its outer membrane renders P. aeruginosa insensitive to many

68

classes of antibiotics.

Many strains also express multiple drug efflux pumps and

carbapenemases making P. aeruginosa one of the major causes of nosocomial infections

70

in the developed and developing world. One class of molecule that readily translocate

71

across the impervious outer membrane of P. aeruginosa to deliver a cytotoxin are S-type

72

pyocins, which are 40-90 kDa protein bacteriocins made by P. aeruginosa. Indeed, a recent

73

survey showed that >85% of P. aeruginosa strains encode nuclease-type pyocins within

74

their genomes (Sharp et al, 2017) hinting at the importance of these protein antibiotics to

75

inter-strain competition.

76

PyoS5 delivers a pore-forming domain across the outer membrane to depolarize the

77

cell while PyoS5-producing cells are protected against the action of the toxin by ImS5, a

78

small membrane localized immunity protein (Ling et al, 2010). Previous work has shown

79

that PyoS5 binds the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-anchored common polysaccharide antigen

80

(CPA), which is identical across P. aeruginosa strains (McCaughey et al, 2016a) and is a

81

major surface antigen in cystic fibrosis isolates (Lam et al, 1989), and that PyoS5

82

susceptibility depends on the ferric pyochelin transporter FptA (Elfarash et al, 2014). Here,

83

we delineate how PyoS5, by parasitizing FptA and CPA in the outer membrane and in

84

conjunction with proton motive force (PMF)-linked TonB1 in the inner membrane, delivers

85

its cytotoxic domain into P. aeruginosa.

Results and Discussion

90

The structure of PyoS5 reveals a novel domain architecture underpins outer

91

membrane transport in P. aeruginosa

92

S-type pyocins (which we simply refer to as pyocins) belong to a broad group of

93

protein bacteriocins that includes colicins which kill E. coli as well as bacteriocins that target

94

other Gram-negative bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and

95

Yersinia pestis. Colicins, like pyocins, exploit the PMF to translocate through the cell

96

envelope to deliver a cytotoxic domain, typically a pore-forming domain or a nuclease that

97

cleaves DNA, rRNA or tRNA (Papadakos et al, 2012). Also like colicins, pyocins are

98

multidomain toxins, their constituent domains associated with binding outer membrane

99

receptors and the import process itself. There are currently several structures for intact

100

colicins in the protein data bank (PDB) but only two for pyocins, pyocin PaeM and L1

101

(McCaughey et al, 2014; Barreteau et al, 2012). However, pyocins PaeM and L1 are atypical

102

amongst the bacteriocins due to their small sizes (14 kDa for PaeM and 28 kDa for L1

103

compared to >50 kDa for most pyocins). Consequently, we know very little about the

104

structural biology of typical pyocins found in P. aeruginosa genomes. Structural data are

105

important to understanding bacteriocin uptake mechanisms, especially since the domain

106

arrangement of pyocins is different to that of colicins. The receptor-binding domains are

107

centrally located in colicins and their membrane translocation domains are at the N-terminus

108

whereas in pyocins the order is reported to be reversed (Sano et al, 1993). This change in

109

relative domain orientation would mean a fundamental difference in how these molecules

110

transport across the outer membrane.

structure of PyoS5 and to define the functionality of its constituent domains.

We therefore set out to determine the crystal

PyoS5 was expressed and purified from E. coli cells (see Materials & Methods). The

113

57-kDa toxin was monomeric in solution and active against P. aeruginosa strains at sub-

114

nanomolar concentrations (Figure S1). The protein crystallized in the P21 space group and

115

the structure was solved by a combination of single wavelength anomalous diffraction and

116

molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.2 Å (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table S1 and

117

Materials and Methods). The first 39 residues were absent from the final model, presumed

118

unstructured which we refer to below as the disordered region. Otherwise, continuous

119

electron density was observed for the entirety of the remaining protein sequence (residues

120

40-498). The structure shows that PyoS5 is an elongated, α-helical protein measuring 36 Å

121

on the short axis and 195 Å on the long axis. Colicins are similarly long proteins and have

122

disordered N-termini (Soelaiman et al, 2001; Wiener et al, 1997; Johnson et al, 2017). The

123

extended conformation was confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data; 93% of

124

the modelled PyoS5 residues were within the SAXS envelope (Figure S2). Also similar to

125

colicins is the prevalence of α-helical structure in PyoS5. PyoS5 contains 17 helices, the

126

high preponderance of helical structure likely reflecting the need to forcibly unfold the toxin

127

during transport into a cell and the lower forces known to be required for unfolding helices

128

relative to β-sheets (reviewed in (Brockwell et al, 2005)).

129

The structure of PyoS5 is comprised of three ordered domains (Figure 1A). The C-

130

terminal domain (domain 3; residues 315-498) has the canonical ten-helical bundle fold of

131

a pore-forming domain found in colicins (Cascales et al, 2007), which is consistent with the

132

killing activity of PyoS5 (Ling et al, 2010). Previous studies have highlighted that the

133

protective immunity proteins of pore-forming domains within colicins fall into two sub-groups

134

although the functional significance of this is unclear. Immunity proteins against colicins A,

135

B and N – the so-called A-Type - have four transmembrane helices while those against E1,

136

Ia and K – the so-called E1-type – have three (Cascales et al, 2007). Based on the predicted

137

number of transmembrane helices of its immunity protein the pore-forming domain of PyoS5

138

belongs to the E1-type (Parret & De Mot, 2000). Through detailed structural comparisons

139

of all pore-former domains with that of PyoS5 we identified a clear structural difference

140

between the pore-forming domains of the A- and E1-groups (Figure S3). Specifically, this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856047; this version posted November 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

141

difference relates to the positioning of helices 1 and 5 of the domain with respect to each

142

other; in A-type structures, helix 1 is positioned close to the centre of the domain, pushing

143

out helix 5, while in E1-type structures, helix 5 is located closer to the centre of the domain.

144

These pore-forming domain structures represent the ground state of the ionophore before

145

depolarization of the inner membrane. We speculate the structural alterations evident in the

146

A and E1-groups may reflect differences in the way each class of pore-forming domain is

147

recognised by its particular type of immunity protein before insertion in the bacterial inner

148

membrane.

149

The other structured domains of PyoS5 are also helical bundles but of a novel fold.

150

Domain 1 comprises residues 40-194 while domain 2 comprises 195-315.

The core

151

structural motif of each domain is a kinked three-helix bundle (kTHB). The two kTHB

152

domains are structurally similar to each other (superposition root-mean-square deviation

153

(RMSD), 2.5 Å) but share little sequence identity (~12%) (Figure 1B). Each kTHB domain

154

is composed of a kinked helix I connected to a straight helix II by a loop. Helix II packs

155

against both helix I and a third straight helix, helix III. The connection between helices II

156

and III varies between the two copies of the fold. In domain 1, this connection is composed

157

of three short helical turns while in domain 2 it is a loop. The other striking feature of the

158

kTHB structural motif is that the third helix from each domain extends into the next domain

159

of the pyocin; helix III of domain 1 extends over 90 Å into domain 2, where it forms helix I,

160

while helix III of domain 2 extends over 90 Å to the pore-forming domain of the toxin. The

161

kTHB fold is stabilised predominantly by hydrophobic interactions mediated by aliphatic

162

amino acid side chains and, in one instance, aromatic stacking (Tyr207-Tyr280, domain 2)

163

(Figure 1D). None of these stabilising interactions are conserved.

164

Recently, White et al reported the structure of the N-terminal domain of the nuclease

165

pyocin PyoS2 bound to the outer membrane protein FpvAI (White et al, 2017). We found

166

by structural superposition that the kTHB domain 1 of PyoS5 is structurally similar to this

167

domain of PyoS2 (Figure 1C) and sequence similarity of 75% between the second domains

168

of PyoS5 and PyoS2 suggest similar structures here as well (Figure S4).

169

similarities of domains in pyocins S1, SD1, SD2, S3, SD3 and S4 to the kTHB domain also

170

suggest these are common among pyocins (Figure S4). The structural superposition of the

171

PyoS5 and PyoS2 kTHB domains, without the small helices connecting helix II and helix III

172

in PyoS5, has an RMSD of 4.1 Å over 128 residues (Figure 1C).

Sequence

173

We conclude that PyoS5 is an elongated bacteriocin comprising a disordered region

174

at its N-terminus, two kTHB domains, which is a common structural platform for protein

175

bacteriocins targeting P. aeruginosa, and a C-terminal pore-forming domain. We next set

176

out to ascribe functions to each of the domains/regions of PyoS5 that transport the pore-

177

forming domain into P. aeruginosa cells.

178
179
180

Functional annotation of PyoS5 domains
We expressed and purified truncations of PyoS5 that removed one or more

181

domains/regions.

These included PyoS51-315, in which the pore-forming domain was

182

removed, PyoS51-196, in which both domain 2 and the pore-forming domain were deleted,

183

and PyoS5194-315, which only contained domain 2.

184

determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and their thermal melting temperatures

185

largely recapitulated those found in intact PyoS5 (Figure S5).

The constructs were folded, as

186

We first analysed the capacity of PyoS5 and the various deletion constructs to bind

187

CPA in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. Heats of binding were observed

188

for PyoS51-315 and PyoS5194-315 but not PyoS51-196 (in 0.2 M Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.5)

189

(Figure 2A-C, Supplementary Table S2). From these experiments, equilibrium dissociation

190

constants (Kds) of 0.6 μM for PyoS51-315 and 0.3 μM for PyoS5194-315 were obtained, similar

191

to that reported previously for intact PyoS5 binding CPA (McCaughey et al, 2016a). When

192

polysaccharides derived from P. aeruginosa PAO1 Δrmd were used (that do not contain

193

CPA) no binding to PyoS5194-315 was detected (Figure 2C). These results demonstrate that

194

the CPA binding activity of PyoS5 resides within domain 2, and that the CPA-binding

195

function is not a conserved feature of the kTHB fold. Pyocins S2 and SD3 have also been

196

shown previously to bind P. aeruginosa CPA sugars (McCaughey et al, 2016a). Sequence

197

alignments show that each has a domain equivalent to that of domain 2 of PyoS5. Indeed,

198

the level of sequence identity across this region (39 %) is far greater than that between the

199

two kTHB domains of PyoS5. Moreover, over half of the 45 identical residues shared

200

between pyocins S2, SD3 and S5 form a grooved surface that runs perpendicular to the long

201

axis of PyoS5 (Figure S4+S6). We infer that this conserved groove is the CPA binding site

202

in these different pyocins, each of which nevertheless delivers a different cytotoxic domain

203

into P. aeruginosa.

204

PyoS5-mediated killing of P. aeruginosa cells requires the ferric pyochelin transporter

205

FptA, and the central region of the toxin (residues 151-300) has been implicated in defining

206

this specificity (Elfarash et al, 2014). This region corresponds largely to domain 2 in the

207

PyoS5 crystal structure, which, as the work above indicates, is involved in CPA binding. We

208

therefore investigated PyoS5 binding to FptA and identified the region involved. Initially, we

209

used native mass spectrometry (MS) to verify that PyoS5 binds FptA (Supplementary Table

210

S3). We then determined the affinity for the complex using surface plasmon resonance

211

(SPR) where the pyocin, and various deletion constructs, were immobilized on the chip

212

(Figure 2D, Supplementary Table S4). These experiments determined the Kd for the PyoS5-

213

FptA complex as 6.5 μM (in 25 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-octyl-

214

β-D-glucoside (β-OG). Upon addition of ferric pyochelin to our SPR experiments, binding of

215

PyoS5 to FptA reduced significantly (Figure S7B), suggesting the binding sites for the pyocin

216

and pyochelin overlap.

217

experiments where PyoS5 dissociated pre-formed complexes of ferric pyochelin bound to

218

FptA (Figure S7A). We next delineated the FptA binding site in PyoS5. Deletion of domain

219

2 had a marginal effect on FptA binding while domain 2 alone showed no FptA binding

220

(Figure 2D, Supplementary Table S4). Deletion of the disordered region at the N-terminus

221

of PyoS5 (residues 2-39) had a large effect on the amount of FptA that could bind to the

222

chip (Figure 2E), suggesting this was affecting binding. However, closer examination

223

indicated binding was affected only two-fold (Supplementary Table S4) and that the impact

224

of the truncation was likely due to restricted access of FptA to its binding site on domain 1

225

in this construct (Figure 2E, Supplementary Table S4). By contrast, when the first 13

226

residues of this region were deleted (PyoS51-315 Δ2-9 and PyoS51-315 Δ10-13) binding to FptA

227

remained unaffected (Supplementary Table S4). We conclude that the FptA binding site in

228

PyoS5 is predominantly localised to kTHB domain 1 with a minor contribution from its

229

associated disorder region at the N-terminus.

230

All protein bacteriocins access the PMF via either the Tol or Ton systems of Gram-

231

negative bacteria (generally referred to as group A and B toxins in the colicin literature),

232

which they use to drive translocation across the outer membrane (Kleanthous, 2010). It has

233

yet to be established which of these systems is contacted by PyoS5. Typically, Tol/Ton

234

dependence is evaluated using deletion strains. We focused initially on Ton dependence

235

since deletion strains in P. aeruginosa PAO6609 are available (Tol is essential in P.

236

aeruginosa). P. aeruginosa harbours three tonB genes, tonB1, tonB2 and tonB3 (Zhao &

237

Poole, 2000; Takase et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2004). PAO6609 is a derivative of P.

238

aeruginosa PAO1 and so is naturally immune to PyoS5 because it harbours the ImS5

239

immunity gene (Hohnadel et al, 1986). We therefore generated a PyoS5-ColIa chimera in

240

which the pore-forming domain of PyoS5 was substituted for that of colicin Ia to overcome

241

this immunity. PyoS5-ColIa was active against P. aeruginosa PAO6609 and strains with

242

tonB2 and tonB3 deleted (Figure S8). It was not possible to test the susceptibility of a tonB1

243

deletion strain because the high levels of iron needed for growth of this strain diminished

245

to iron-dependent down-regulation of FptA expression (Ankenbauer & Quan, 1994). We

246

therefore resorted to direct SPR binding assays to determine if PyoS5 bound purified TonB1

247

in vitro (see Materials and Methods for further details). We found that TonB1 binds PyoS51-

248

315

249

Moreover, a putative 9-residue TonB box, found in TonB1-dependent transporters and

250

bacteriocins utilizing TonB1, is also found in the N-terminal disordered region of PyoS5

251

(residues 6-14). Deletion of residues 10-13 abolished binding to TonB1, confirming this

252

region as the TonB1 binding site (Figure 2F, Supplementary Table S4).

with an affinity of 230 nM in SPR experiments (Figure 2F, Supplementary Table S4).

253

In summary, through a combination of biophysical and structural approaches we have

254

delineated the major binding interactions of PyoS5 with the P. aeruginosa cell envelope. Of

255

the two kTHB domains, domain 2 binds CPA while domain 1 binds the ferric pyochelin

256

transporter FptA with a minor contribution by the disordered region, which in addition binds

257

the inner membrane protein TonB1.

of import could be established. We replaced the pore-forming domain of PyoS5 with a C-

264

terminal cysteine residue and labelled this residue with AlexaFluor488 (PyoS51-315-AF488).

265

P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells were used in these experiments since cytotoxic activity was not

266

being monitored. PyoS51-315-AF488 readily labelled P. aeruginosa PAO1 cells (Figure 3A).

267

Trypsin treatment of these labelled cells, to remove surface bound PyoS5, reduced

fluorescence intensity significantly (~eight-fold), but fluorescence was still associated with

cells (Figure 3A+B).

internalised fluorescence (Figure 3C). PyoS5194-315-AF488 (domain 2 construct) on the other

277

hand labelled cells much less efficiently (likely due to its weak binding of CPA on the surface)

280

Δ10-13-AF488, in which part of the TonB1 binding site (residues 10-13) was deleted, showed

281

that trypsin-protected fluorophores (i.e. imported molecules) were no longer detected,

282

consistent with PMF/TonB1-dependent import of PyoS5 across the outer membrane via

283

FptA (Figure 3D and S9). Finally, import assays were conducted using P. aeruginosa PAO1

284

Δrmd cells, which lack CPA. Surface-associated fluorescence of PyoS51-315-AF488 and

285

susceptibility to PyoS5ColIa was much reduced in these cells, consistent with CPA being

286

required for surface accumulation of PyoS5, but imported fluorescence in a domain 2

287

deletion was unaffected (Figure 3E and S10).

288

In summary, our fluorescence assays suggest that import of PyoS5 occurs in two

289

stages. Initial binding to CPA via the central kTHB domain leads to accumulation on the

290

surface of P. aeruginosa. Thereafter, the first kTHB domain of the pyocin binds FptA in the

291

outer membrane, which also likely acts as the translocation channel, allowing contact

292

between the disordered TonB1 binding site of PyoS5 with TonB1 in the inner membrane

293

and PMF-driven import of the toxin (model presented below).

Engineering pyocin susceptibility in E. coli

13
296

As with most bacteriocins, pyocins are specific for a subset of strains, in this case

297

from P. aeruginosa, which reflects the array of cell envelope interactions required for import.

298

Yet common principles are beginning to emerge suggesting generic import mechanisms

299

may apply for all Gram-negative bacteria that exploit protein bacteriocins. We therefore

300

devised a test of this hypothesis by engineering E. coli susceptibility towards PyoS5 utilising

301

our current understanding of its import pathway.

302

Our strategy was based on first determining if the pore-forming domain of PyoS5, if

303

imported, could kill E. coli cells and then engineering the minimal requirements into E. coli

304

in order for PyoS5 to be recognised and transported. A similar strategy was reported by

305

Bosak et al (2012) where E. coli was engineered to be susceptible to a bacteriocin specific

306

for Yersinia kristensenii (Bosák et al, 2012). In the present work, we first showed that a

307

chimera of the PyoS5 pore-forming domain fused to the C-terminus of the colicin B

308

translocation and receptor-binding region (replacing colicin B’s own pore-forming domain)

309

was cytotoxic against E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. We next challenged E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells

310

expressing P. aeruginosa FptA but saw no PyoS5 killing (Figure 4). Rationalising that E.

311

coli TonB may not be recognising the TonB1 binding sites (Ton boxes) of FptA and/or

312

PyoS5, we also expressed, in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells expressing FptA along with a chimera

313

of E. coli TonB (TonB1-102) fused to P. aeruginosa TonB1201-342. In this chimera, TonB-B1,

314

the C-terminal domain and periplasmic regions of TonB are those from P. aeruginosa but

315

the transmembrane domain that associates with TonB’s partner proteins ExbB and ExbD

316

are those from E. coli.

317

mediated killing (Figure 4). To determine the generality of this cross-species killing, we

318

expressed the fpvAI gene, which is recognised by PyoS2 and PyoS4, in E. coli cells

319

expressing the E. coli-P. aeruginosa TonB-B1 hybrid. This strain was sensitive to both

320

PyoS2 and PyoS4 but not to PyoS5 (Figure S11).

Under these conditions, E. coli became sensitized to PyoS5-

321

We conclude that our engineered system is a simple means by which the import

322

apparatus required for bacteriocins can be readily defined. Indeed, through this work we

323

showed for the first time that PyoS4 is a TonB1-dependent bacteriocin. Importantly, our

324

complete functional characterisation of PyoS5 demonstrates that the prevailing view of

325

receptor-binding and translocation domains being inverted in pyocins relative to colicins is

326

not correct. Instead, pyocins and colicins are organised in the same way, which likely

327

explains how a pyocin can be made to work in E. coli. They have central receptor-binding

328

domains (kTHB domain 2 in PyoS5) and N-terminally-located translocation domains (kTHB

329

domain 1 and its associated disordered region). The confusion that has emerged in the

330

field, that N-terminal domains of pyocins represent their receptor-binding domains, has

331

arisen because pyocin interactions with their translocation channels (e.g. PyoS2 with FpvAI;

332

(White et al, 2017)) can be much higher affinity than the interaction of the pyocin with its

333

initial CPA receptor. In summary, our results suggest that the underlying mechanism by

334

which Ton-dependent bacteriocins cross the outer membranes of the Enterobacteriales and

335

Pseudomonadales, long thought to be unrelated, are fundamentally the same.

336
337

Model for pyocin transport across the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa

338

White et al demonstrated recently that the N-terminal domain of PyoS2 translocates

339

directly through FpvAI (White et al, 2017). The mechanism of import is analogous to that of

340

FpvAI’s cognate siderophore ligand, ferripyoverdine; a labile portion of the transporter plug

341

domain is removed by TonB1, allowing the TonB1 binding site (TonB box) of PyoS2 to enter

342

the periplasm and activate import of the pyocin. Binding of PyoS2 to FpvAI is primarily

343

through a short polyproline region that lacks regular secondary structure and mimics

344

pyoverdine. The principal binding site of PyoS5 for FptA is domain 1 and its associated

345

disordered region, which does not however have an equivalent polyproline sequence. Its

346

binding to FptA is also significantly weaker than that of PyoS2 for FpvAI. For both PyoS2

347

and PyoS5, however, initial association with P. aeruginosa is by their central kTHB domains

348

(domain 2 in PyoS5) which binds CPA embedded in the outer membrane and allows the

349

toxin to decorate the cell surface (McCaughey et al, 2016a).

350

In Figure 5, we present a unifying model for TonB1-dependent pyocin import based

351

on our data for PyoS5 and that presented by White et al for PyoS2 (White et al, 2017). CPA

352

binding likely orients the pyocin horizontally with respect to the membrane since the

353

predicted CPA-binding groove in PyoS5 is perpendicular to the long axis of PyoS5. This

354

orientation assumes CPA molecules are projected vertically from the surface from their LPS

355

anchors. After this initial surface association, we postulate that pyocins use their disordered

356

N-terminus to find their transporter, the binding of which causes the pyocin to reorient,

357

allowing the N-terminal kTHB domain to engage the transporter (as found in the PyoS2-

358

FpvAI complex). Similar ‘fishing pole’ models have been proposed for receptor-bound

359

colicins finding translocator proteins, but in these instances the receptor is generally an outer

360

membrane protein (Zakharov et al, 2004). Following opening of the transporter channel by

361

TonB1, the pyocin’s own TonB1 binding site enters the periplasm.

362

dependent step then occurs in which TonB1 in conjunction with the PMF unfolds the kTHB

363

domain of the pyocin and pulls it through the transporter. Whether this energized interaction

364

is responsible for the entire pyocin entering the periplasm (as shown in Figure 5) or whether

365

domain refolding in the periplasm contributes to the entry process remains to be established.

FptA purification was modelled after a previous BtuB purification protocol (Housden et al,

414

2005). FptA was expressed heterologously from E. coli TNE012 at 37 °C while shaking at

415

120 rpm in LB, and upon reaching OD600 0.6 induced with 0.15% (w/v) arabinose and

supplemented with 0.15% w/v glucose. The bacteria were harvested as described for PyoS5

417

and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.25% (w/v) lithium diiodosalicylic acid (LIS),

418

sonicated as described for PyoS5 and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The

419

supernatant was collected, the pellet resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged again.

420

Both supernatants were ultra-centrifuged at 200 000 g for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was

421

homogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.25% (w/v) LIS, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and ultra-

422

centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and

ultra-centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 +

424

2% (w/v) β-OG, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ultra-centrifuged again.

425

FptA was purified from the supernatant by anion exchange chromatography. A 5 mL HiTrap

LPS-derived polysaccharide isolation

447

LPS-derived polysaccharides were isolated as described previously (McCaughey et al,

resuspended in 10 mL 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mg/mL lyosozyme, 0.5 mg/mL DNAse I. Cells

450

were lysed by sonication, as described for PyoS5 isolation, the lysate incubated for 30 min

at RT and then 0.2 mM EDTA added. An equal volume of aqueous phenol was then added

and the mixture heated for 20 min at 70 °C with mixing. The solution was incubated on ice

Biophysical methods

462

Native mass spectrometry was performed in 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer with

463

exception of TonB1 which was analysed in 200 mM ammonium acetate buffer.

464

SPR was performed on a Biacore T200 instrument. A Series S Sensor Chip CM5 (GE

465

LifeScience) was docked and primed into HBS-OG buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM

466

NaCl, 1% (w/v) β-OG). This buffer was used as a running buffer for all SPR experiments.

467

For amine coupling using the Amine Coupling kit (GE Healthcare), ligand proteins were

468

desalted into immobilization buffer (25 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl) and

469

diluted 10-fold in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 (GE LifeScience).

470

For thiol coupling using the Thiol Coupling kit (GE Healthcare), ligand proteins were

471

incubated with 10 mM (dithiothreitol) DTT for 2 h, then desalted into immobilization buffer

472

diluted 10-fold in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 (GE LifeScience) immediately before

473

immobilization.

474

Analyte proteins were desalted into HBS-OG buffer before application. The contact time for

475

SPR was set to 120 s, the dissociation time to 600 s and the flow rate to 30 µL/min. Lower

476

analyte concentrations were applied first.

477

ITC was performed using a MicroCal iTC200 instrument at 25 °C in 0.2 M sodium phosphate

478

buffer pH 7.5. Proteins in the syringe were at 150 µM, polysaccharides in the cell at 7 mg/mL

479

which estimated to be 30 µM based on a molecular weight of 10 kDa and the assumption

480

that CPA constitutes 5% of the LPS polysaccharides. The data were fitted to a one binding

481

site model in Microcal LLC Origin software. As the CPA concentration is estimated, the

482

observed stoichiometry is unlikely to be correct, while ΔH, ΔS and Kd are unaffected by the

483

analyte concentration. Errors reported in the text are standard deviations of the average of

484

two experiments.

weight, molar concentration and pathlength in mm. Thermal melting curves for proteins were

screens Index (Hampton Research) and PACT, JCSG+ and Morpheus (Molecular

511

Dimensions) were used to screen for crystals. Crystals were grown in a vapour diffusion

512

sitting drop set up in JCSG+ screen (Molecular Dimensions) condition C7 (10% (w/v) PEG

513

3000, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M zinc acetate, pH 4.5) at 18 °C. Drops contained 100 nL

514

protein and 100 nL buffer. The cryoprotectant solution was 25 % glycerol, 10% w/v PEG

515

3000, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M zinc acetate, pH 4.5 for cooling the crystals in liquid

516

nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline ID30A-3 at ESRF at a wavelength of

517

0.9679 Å using an EIGER detector. We collected 225 degrees of data with 0.15-degree

518

oscillation. Transmission was 20% and exposure time was 0.010 s.

519

The raw data were analysed in Dials, revealing a P21 space group and yielding a 98.8%

520

complete set of indexed diffraction spots but no anomalous signal. Molecular replacement

521

was carried out using ColIa residues 450-624 in Phaser and yielded electron density for the

522

pore-forming domain of PyoS5. Lack of density for the remainder of the protein indicated

523

that the phases, obtained from ColIa, were not sufficient to build a model for the whole

524

protein.

525

Improved phases were obtained from anisotropy correction of the same data set using

526

Staraniso in AutoProc (Vonrhein et al, 2011; Tickle et al, 2019), which allowed a weak

527

anomalous signal to be detected. The partial model from molecular replacement from Dials

528

and the anomalous data from AutoProc were combined for MR-SAD phasing using Phaser

529

(McCoy et al, 2007). An anomalous substructure containing eight metal ions was identified.

530

Based on the type of metal present in the crystallization condition, these were assumed to

531

be Zn+2. The result was additional, visible helical density beyond the pore-forming domain.

532

Iterations of model building into the visible helical density in Coot and refinement against the

533

complete Dials data set in Buster version 2.10.3, resulted in a model of PyoS5. The model

534

was optimized in Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004), followed by one crystallographic

535

refinement in Buster, followed by model optimization in Coot and one refinement in Phenix

536

1.12 (Adams et al, 2010). Up to then the whole model was treated as one TLS group. At this

537

point four new TLS groups were created based on similar B-factors as determined in Phenix,

538

comprising residues 40 to 212, 213 to 338, 339 to 395 and 395 to 505, respectively. This

539

increased the Rwork and Rfree upon refinement indicating that the use of multiple TLS groups

540

made the model worse. The refinement process was therefore continued with the whole

541

model treated as one TLS group.

542

At the end of the model optimization and refinement the Rwork was 0.212 and the Rfree 0.272.

543

MolProbitiy, (Chen et al, 2010), was used to validate the structure and assess its quality,

544

resulting in a Molprobity score of 1.57. At the end of this validation process the R work was

545

0.225 and the Rfree 0.275. Figures of the crystal structure were created using CCP4MG

546

(Winn et al, 2011) and PyMOL (Delano, 2002).

Fluorescence microscopy

549

Fluorescent labelling of proteins

550

Bacteriocins were fluorescently labelled using maleimide AF488 labels via an engineered

551

C-terminal cysteine. To reduce the cysteine, the protein was mixed in a 1 to 9 ratio with DTT

552

to yield a concentration of 10 mM DTT and incubated for 2 h at RT. To remove aggregates,

553

the protein was centrifuged at 16000 g for 1.5 min and the supernatant transferred to a new

554

tube. The supernatant was then applied to a 5 mL HiTrap desalting column and desalted

555

into 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) β-OG. The protein concentration was

556

measured and immediately maleimide AF488 was added in 3-fold excess. The reaction was

557

allowed to proceed for 1 h while mixing by rotary inversion in the dark at RT. Then the

558

reaction was quenched by adding DTT to a final concentration of 5 mM. The solution was

559

centrifuged and desalted as before. The absorbance was measured at 280 nm and 494 nm

using a V-550 UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (Jasco). Labelling efficiency was determined

561

as described in the manufacturers protocol (Molecular Probes Inc, 2006). All fluorescently

562

labelled proteins used for microscopy were labelled with more than 95% efficiency.

563
564

Fluorescent labelling of bacteria

565

Coverslips were cleaned by water bath sonication at 50 °C for 15 min in 2% Neutracon

566

(Decon) solution, washed in ddH2O and air dried.

567

Bacteria were grown over night in LB medium. 1 mL of this overnight culture were pelleted

568

and resuspended in 10 mL supplemented M9 medium and grown until an OD 600 of 0.6. 600

569

µL of this culture were used per condition. All pelleting steps were performed at 7000 g for

570

3 min at RT.

571

For CCCP treatment, CCCP was added to a final concentration of 100 µM from a 10 mM

572

stock in DMSO to the bacteria before addition of the fluorescently labelled protein. The

573

bacteria were incubated with CCCP while mixing by rotary inversion at RT for 5 min, while

574

all other samples were incubated without CCCP for the same time. Fluorescently labelled

575

protein was then added to a concentration of 1 µM and the sample incubated in the dark

576

while mixing by rotary inversion for 20 min at RT.

577

For trypsin treatment, trypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL immediately

578

after the incubation with the fluorophore-labelled pyocin. The bacteria were incubated with

579

or without trypsin at 30 °C for 1 hour at 120 rpm.

580

Subsequently, bacteria were washed three times in supplemented M9, where each wash

581

consisted of pelleting the bacteria, removing the supernatant, resuspending the pellet in 50

582

µL by repeated pipetting (10 times) with a P20 pipette, transferring the 50 µL to a new tube

583

with 450 µL supplemented M9, and vortexing. The bacteria were resuspended in a final

volume of 30 µL. 3 µL were applied to an agar pad for microscopic analysis. Agar pads were

585

prepared using Geneframes (Thermo Scientific) as follows. 1% (w/v) supplemented M9 agar

586

was prepared and 190 µL pipetted into the Geneframe. Using a coverslip, the surface was

587

flattened and excess agar removed. Once the agar was solidified the cover slip was

588

removed, the bacterial suspension added and a new coverslip attached to the adhesive side

589

of the Geneframe.

590
591

Image collection

592

All images were collected on an Oxford Nanoimager S microscope at 100 ms exposure. For

593

every image, 200 frames were collected and averaged. Green fluorescence (excitation: 473

594

nm, emission 425/50 nm) was measured at 35% laser power.

595
596

Data analysis

597

In ImageJ the 200 collected frames per image were merged using the command “Z project”.

598

Bacterial cells and background were identified in trans-illumination images using “Trainable

599

Weka Classifier”. Regions of interest were transferred to green fluorescence images and the

600

mean fluorescence of cells, “signal”, and background “noise” quantified. Each image

601

contained a minimum of 15 bacterial cells. For each repeat a minimum of six images were

602

collected per sample and three independent experiments were performed for each

603

experiment. As a result, a minimum of 270 bacterial cells were quantified for each sample.

604

Students t-tests were performed to determine p-values.

Figure 4: FptA and TonB1 constitute the minimal system for PyoS5-susceptibility in

E. coli.

852

(A) Susceptibility to PyoS5 (3 and 60 μM) was assessed for P. aeruginosa YHP17, (B) for

853

E. coli BL21 (DE3) expressing FptA, (C) for E. coli BL21 (DE3) expressing TonB-B1, and

854

(D) for E. coli BL21 (DE3) expressing FptA and TonB-B1. Zones of clearance are observed

855

in all E. coli samples for the ColBPyoS5 (13 μM) control (B-D) and for both concentrations

856

of PyoS5 in E. coli expressing FptA and TonB-B1 (D). In the P. aeruginosa control clearance

857

zones were observed for PyoS5 (A).

Figure 6: Model of PyoS5 import.

860

(A) PyoS5 accumulates on the cell surface by binding to CPA through kTHB domain 2. (B)

861

PyoS5 then contacts its outer membrane translocator, FptA, initially with its disordered N-

862

terminus, and then through binding of kTHB domain 1. (C) Interactions between FptA and

863

TonB1 possibly act to induce movement of the receptor plug domain, allowing for the

864

unstructured N-terminus of PyoS5 to thread through the receptor and access the periplasm.

865

Following entry to the periplasm the N-terminus of PyoS5 binds toTonB1 though the TonB-

866

box motif. The formation of the PyoS5-TonB1 complex enables coupling to inner membrane

867

protein targets of TonB1. (D) This coupling provides energy transduction from the PMF that

868

facilitates translocation of PyoS5 through the outer membrane. (E) Finally, this results in

869

PyoS5 translocation into the periplasm.

921

(grey), FptA-Pch complex (red), FptA-PyoS51-299 complex (blue) and dissociated FptA

922

(yellow). No complex of FptA, PyoS51-299 and Pch is detected. (B) SPR shows 3.4 μM FptA
