Abstract
Mobile EEG allows the investigation of brain activity outside of the lab and in increasingly
complex environments. In this study, EEG equipment was adapted for use and transportation in a
backpack while cycling. Participants performed an auditory oddball task while cycling outside
either in a quiet park or near a noisy roadway. In both conditions, we were able to accurately
measure reliable event related potentials (ERP). The P2 and P3 were similar in topography, and
morphology, with no differences in amplitude between conditions. When biking near the
roadway, an increased N1 amplitude was observed when evoked by both standards and targets
compared with biking in the quiet park. This may be due to attentional processes filtering the
overlapping sounds between the tones used and similar environmental frequencies. No
behavioural differences were found. This study established methods for mobile recording of ERP
signals. Future directions include investigating auditory ERPs in more realistic studies outside of
laboratory.

1. Introduction
Cognitive neuroscience traditionally requires subjects to sit in highly controlled
environments, and avoid any kind of natural light, sound, and movement during recording. This
is because all uncontrolled sensations have the possibility of introducing noise into the EEG
signal (Schl√∂gl, Anderer, Roberts, Pregenzer, & Pfurtscheller, 1999; White & Van Cott, 2010),
and this noise can be what determines the statistical power when analyzing EEG and ERP data
(Luck, 2014). New technologies are beginning to make it easier to record laboratory-quality EEG
data outside of the lab while subjects are mobile (Debener et al., 2012; Kuziek, Sheinh, &
Mathewson, 2017; Scanlon et al. 2017b). While the effects of movement on EEG data are
beginning to be understood, few studies have attempted to investigate the effect that different
environments may have on the way the brain functions. The present study was conducted in an
attempt to go beyond the limitations of measuring EEG on a mobile participant, while also
investigating the ways in which different environments may affect the ERP.
In mobile EEG literature, the oddball task is commonly used due to its high signal to
noise ratio in the detection of the P3, as well as for the ability to infer changes in attentional
resources due to a concurrent task (Polich, 1987; Polich & Kok., 1995). Debener et al. (2012)
recorded brain activity using a small consumer passive electrode wireless EEG mounted to a
typical laboratory electrode cap, and had participants perform an auditory oddball task while
either walking outdoors or sitting indoors. The authors demonstrated that the P3 was
significantly larger when generated while sitting indoor than during outdoor walking. Using a
similar wireless EEG system, de Vos, Kroesen, Emkes, & Debener (2014) found a significantly
larger P3 response to a three-stimulus oddball paradigm while participants were sitting compared
to walking outside. Zink, Hunyadi, Van Huffel, and de Vos (2016) used a passive wireless

mobile EEG system and asked participants to perform an auditory oddball paradigm during
mobile cycling, stationary pedaling and sitting in a natural outdoor environment. The authors
found no difference in RMS data noise or P3 amplitude between sitting and pedaling, but
demonstrated a significant increase in noise and near-significant decrease in P3 amplitude while
participants were cycling. Scanlon, Townsend, Cormier, Kuziek, & Mathewson (2017b) had
participants perform an oddball task both while cycling outside and sitting inside, using a regular
non-mobile EEG system with active electrodes and optimized for mobility using a tablet
computer. Consistent with other mobile EEG studies mentioned, we found a significantly
decreased P3 amplitude while cycling outside. Altogether these studies indicate that the P3 is
reduced during purposeful movement.
Several studies have investigated how EEG can be optimized for mobile tasks. De Vos
and Debener (2014) recommended that new technologies for mobile EEG be lightweight, small,
and able to avoid cable motion (ideally wireless). Similarly, Makeig, Gramann, Jung,
Sejnowski, Poizner (2010) recommended that ideal mobile EEG systems use small and
lightweight EEG sensors to avoid hindering movement and with wireless data recording
capabilities. Following these recommendations, Debener, Emkes, Gandras, de Vos and Bleichner
(2015) demonstrated reliable P3 effects while using a cEEGrid electrode array, composed of a
flexible sheet of electrodes, which were placed around the ear, and using a smartphone for
stimulus presentation. Another study by Bleichner, Lundbeck, Selisky, Minow, et al. (2015) used
a BCI speller to obtain significant P3 effects during a spelling task, with a device small enough
to be concealed under a baseball cap. De Vos, Kroesen, Emkes, and Debener (2014) used a
similar approach with a BCI speller task, and demonstrated equivalent results between a wireless
mobile amplifier and a wired laboratory EEG system. With these new technologies, mobile EEG

can be used to ask increasingly complex questions about the way individuals process their
environments.
In addition to ERPs, some studies have used oscillations measured during mobile EEG to
answer novel questions about the body in motion. Storzer et al. (2016) recorded EEG in the
motor cortex during walking and cycling tasks of comparable speed, to investigate cortical
oscillations during these tasks. The authors showed that both walking and cycling were
associated with a decrease in the power of alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations. Similar to this, Scanlon
et al. (2017b) demonstrated lower alpha power while participants cycled outside compared to
sitting inside during an oddball task. Another study by Jain, Gourab, Schindler-Ivens, and Schmit
(2013) used EEG to measure motor cortex oscillations during active and passive (low effort)
pedaling stationary cycling. The authors demonstrated significantly more beta desynchronization
during active compared to passive pedaling. These studies demonstrate the potential for
measuring oscillations during mobile tasks.
Our research group at the University of Alberta has recently found cycling to be an ideal
task for mobile EEG research, due to the ability for smooth, straightforward movement while
navigating the environment. Our first cycling study looked at the effects of cycling on EEG data,
and had participants perform an auditory oddball task before, during and after a sub-aerobic
stationary cycling task (Scanlon et al., 2017a). We found increased EEG data noise during the
stationary cycling task, however despite this noise, ERP signals were reliably recorded, with no
ERP component differences between the cycling conditions. In a follow-up to this study
(Scanlon et al., 2017b) we used compact technologies that could be fit inside a backpack, in
order to have participants perform the auditory oddball task while cycling outside. Participants
were asked to listen to the oddball task through headphones both while cycling outside and while

sitting in the laboratory. Baseline data noise was increased during the cycling condition;
however, we were able to collect laboratory quality ERPs in both conditions. We demonstrated
significantly decreased P3 amplitude and alpha band oscillations while participants cycled
outside. This study also found an unexpected increase in the N1 component and decrease in the
P2 component of the ERP, during both standard and target tones while participants were cycling
outside. In a follow-up study (Scanlon et al., Under review) we investigated this effect further by
having participants perform the same headphone auditory oddball task inside the lab with
different sounds playing in the background of the task. Here, we found that we were able to
replicate the N1 and P2 effects while playing outdoor noises in the background of the auditory
oddball task, indicating that the effect may have been due to a selective attention process of
filtering background noises in order to perform the task. These studies indicate that bringing
EEG into ecologically valid environments opens up the possibility of demonstrating the way
mechanisms such as auditory selective attention can be observed in real world environments.
The current study builds on the findings of Scanlon et al., (2017b), and Scanlon, et al.,
(Under review), using methods and analysis established in these studies. It is of particular
interest to examine variations in ERP components between path cycling in quiet and noisy
outdoor areas, as well as how these conditions differ in statistical power and noise. If the N1 and
P2 are in fact related to a selective attention process of filtering background noises in order to
pay attention to task-relevant sounds, we would expect to see an increased N1 and decreased P2
while participants perform the same task in a noisier environment. For this experiment, each
participant completed four 6-minute blocks in an auditory oddball task while both subaerobically cycling near a noisy roadway and in a quiet city park. Similar to Scanlon, et al.
(2017b), active low-impedance electrodes were used. Levels of data noise and power spectra

were analyzed, as well as ERP magnitude, morphology and topography for the P3, P2, N1 and
MMN/N2b. Our first hypothesis is that even with the noise created during movement in both
conditions, we will be able to accurately record ERPs in both cycling conditions, with enough
accuracy to detect possible ERP differences between the conditions. Our second hypothesis is
that due to increased ambient noise in the roadway condition, there will be an increased N1 and
decreased P2 while participants cycle near the roadway.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Participants
10 people who were part of the university community participated in the experiment
(mean age = 23.4; Age range= 20-31; 4 female). Each participant received an honorarium of $20.
All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision with no history of neurological
problems. Experimental procedures used were approved by the Internal Research Ethics Board
of the University of Alberta.
2.2 Materials
Prior to the experiment, participants selected one of two bicycles (Kona Mahuna), which
differed only in frame size (17 or 19 inches) based on the participant‚Äôs height. Seat height was
adjusted according to the participants‚Äô comfort level. Bicycle gears were set to the 2nd gear in
both the front and back derailleurs, in order to allow participants to pedal constantly and evenly
throughout the trials at a sub-aerobic level. Data was collected using a Microsoft Surface Pro 3
running Brain Vision recorder (Brain Products), and powered by an Anker Astro Pro2
20000mAh Multi-Voltage External Battery or or Tzumi Extreme PocketJuice 6000mAh battery.
Due to technical problems with the Anker astro battery, the Tzumi battery was used for 8

subjects. The various technologies mentioned were connected using a Vantec 4-Port USB 3.0
Hub.
To run the oddball task and mark the EEG data for ERP averaging, we used a Raspberry
Pi 2 model B computer, running version 3.18 of the Raspian Wheezy operating system, using
version 0.24.7 of the OpenSesame software (Math»èt, Schreij, & Theeuwes, 2012; see Kuziek,
Sheinh, & Mathewson, 2017 for validation study). A 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU
was connected through a 3.5 audio connector for audio output. To mark the data for EEG
averaging, 8-bit TTL pulses were sent to the amplifier through a parallel port connected to the
General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. A button connected to the Raspberry Pi was affixed
to the handlebar of the bike, which was used both as a start button for each block, and a response
button to the target tones. Participants wore a two-pocket backpack (Lululemon; Figure 1A, C)
containing all of the stimulus generating and recording materials. In the roadway condition,
participants rode along approximately 0.65 km of a shared use path next to River Valley Road in
Edmonton, Canada (Figure 1B green). During the park condition on the same day, participants
rode along approximately 0.65 km of a shared use path in MacKinnon Ravine Park, also in
Edmonton, Canada (Figure 1B, blue). The conditions order was randomly varied across
participants.

Hz). Each tone played for 16 ms with a 2 ms ramp-up and down. Tones were spaced 1-1.5
seconds apart.

2.4 EEG Recording
Active wet electrodes were selected for EEG recording in this study based on previous
studies by Laszlo et al. (2014) comparing active and passive amplification electrodes at differing
levels of impedance, as well as by Oliviera et al. (2016) who compared active wet, passive wet
and passive dry electrodes during a mobile task. Both of these studies demonstrated that active
wet electrodes afford cleaner and better quality signals in non-ideal recording conditions. Fifteen
Ag/AgCl pin electrodes were arranged in 10-20 positions (Fp2, F3, Fz, F4, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8,
P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, and Oz). Additionally, a ground electrode was embedded in the cap at the Fpz
position, along with two reference electrodes clipped to the right and left ears. To lower
electrode impedance, SuperVisc electrolyte gel was used, followed by mild abrading of the skin
with a blunted syringe tip. The aforementioned techniques and gel application continued until all
the electrodes had impedance levels lower than 10 kŒ©, as measured using an impedance
measurement box (BrainProducts) and until the raw data appeared to be clean and free of
excessive noise. In addition to the 15 EEG electrodes, two reference electrodes and one ground
electrode, horizontal and vertical bipolar electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded through passive
Ag/AgCl easycap disk electrodes placed above and below the left eye, as well as 1 cm from the
outer canthus of each eye. These passive electrodes were used for the EOG because the AUX
ports of our amplifier do not support active electrodes and we did not see a benefit to giving up 4
EEG channels for active-wet EOG sensors. These EOG electrodes can nonetheless record
reliable signals due to their placement on the face, where there is generally less hair to impede

the signal. Dirt and oils at the EOG electrode sites are removed using NuPrep preparation gel,
followed by cleaning the skin with an antibacterial sanitizing wipe prior to electrode placement
in order to reduce impedance levels of the EOG electrodes based on visual inspection of the raw
data. These bipolar channels were recorded using a pair of BIP2AUX converters plugged into the
AUX ports of the V-amp amplifier, along with a separate ground electrode placed on the central
forehead. EEG and EOG was recorded using a V-amp 16 channel amplifier (Brain Products)
through a laptop USB port. Data were digitized at 500 Hz with a 24 bit resolution. The data were
filtered using an online bandpass with 0.1 and 30 Hz cutoffs, along with a 60 Hz notch filter.
These narrow filters were recommended in the actiCap Xpress manual in order to increase signal
quality and reliability in mobile settings (Brain Products, 2014).
2.5 EEG Analysis
Analyses of EEG data were completed using MATLAB 2016b with EEGLAB (Delorme
& Makeig, 2004), with custom scripts. Following data recording, the EEG data was rereferenced to an average of the left and right ear lobe electrodes. TTL pulses time-locked to the
onset of target and standard tones were marked in the EEG data during recording, and were then
used to construct epochs 1200-ms long (including a 200-ms pretrial baseline). Average voltage in
the first 200-ms baseline was subtracted from the data for each trial and each electrode. To
remove artifacts caused by movement, amplifier blocking, and any other non-physiological
factors, any trials in either of the conditions with a voltage difference from baseline larger than
¬±1000 ŒºV on any channel (including eye channels) were removed from further analysis.
Following eye correction, a second threshold was applied to remove any trials with a voltage
difference from baseline of ¬±200uV. Following this procedure, over 88% of trials were retained
in each condition. Overall, artifact rejection left approximately equal trial numbers per

participant in the park (Mtarg = 183.1; rangetarg = 127-200; Mstand = 722.4; rangestand = 457-800;
SD = Standard Deviation) and roadway (Mtarg = 178.6; rangetarg = 124-200; Mstand = 707.9;
rangestand = 498-800) conditions, which we then used for the remaining analysis.
A regression-based procedure was used to estimate and remove variance due to EEG
artifacts caused by blinks, as well as horizontal and vertical eye movements (Gratton, Coles, &
Donchin, 1983). This technique uses a template-based approach to identify blinks, then computes
propagation factors such as regression coefficients, and predicts the vertical and horizontal eye
channel data from each electrode‚Äôs signal. Then, weighted by these propagation factors, this eye
channel data is then subtracted from each channel, allowing us to remove most variance in the
EEG data that can be predicted by movements from the eyes. In order to keep as many trials as
possible for both conditions, no further filtering or rejection was done on the data.
Data collection was completed between the months of August and November. When
outside, participants sometimes wore a toque (knitted cap) over the EEG cap to prevent the
electrolyte gel from drying out, goggles to prevent excessive eye blinking during the trials, and
gloves, if desires due to the weather (Temperature range = -4 - 17¬∞C; Mean temperature = 11¬∞C).
During each 6 minute block the participant would follow a research assistant on a leading bike,
and travel approximately 650 meters from the starting point until the tones stopped. After which
they would turn around, have the data visually inspected for noise and electrode problems by the
research assistant, and complete another 6 minute block going in the opposite direction.
Participants were instructed to stare straight ahead as much as possible and pedal at a slow, even
pace.

3. Results
3.1 Behavioural analysis
In order to assess behavioural effects in this task, we tested for condition differences in
response rate and average reaction time to the target stimuli in the task, depicted in Figure 2. A
two-tailed paired samples t-test indicated a marginal difference in response rate between the two
conditions, with participants responding to a higher percentage of targets in the roadway than
park condition (Mdiff=-1.6; SDdiff=2.4922; t(9) =-2.0302; p=0.07291). The same test was used to
test for differences in average reaction time, finding no differences between conditions
(Mdiff=4.1037; SDdiff=26.2207; t(9) =0.4949; p=0.6325).

3.2 Data Noise
Figure 3A depicts raw data for a representative participant at the Pz electrode location.
We used two separate methods to estimate the data noise on individual trials. First, we took an
average of the spectra over each EEG epoch in the Fz and Pz electrode locations. Each
participant‚Äôs data was randomly sampled for 290 of their artefact-removed standard trials. A fast
Fourier transform (FFT) was then calculated through a procedure of symmetrically padding the
600 time point epochs with zeros, making for each epoch a 1,024-point time series, which
provided frequency bins of .488 Hz. Because the data were collected online with a low-pass filter
of 30Hz, only frequencies measuring up to 30 Hz were plotted. We then calculated the spectra
for each participant by computing the average of the 290 spectra for each participant, and then
combining these into the grand average spectra, as shown in Figure 3B for the Fz and Pz
channels. Shaded regions depict the standard error of the mean across participants. Evident in the
plots, both conditions depict the expected 1/frequency structure in the data. Also evident is a
significant increase in beta oscillations (15-30Hz) at the Fz electrode location (M diff=0.06410;
SDdiff=0.07322; t(9)= 2.7685; p=0.02181) during the park compared to the roadway condition,
as tested with a two-tailed paired samples t-test.
3.3 Single-Trial Noise
As an additional estimate of the single-trial EEG noise, we computed the RMS value for
a baseline period of each standard trial (de Vos & Debener, 2014). To avoid any interference
from the evoked ERP activity while measuring RMS, the baseline period consisted of the 200 ms
(100 time points) prior to each tone‚Äôs onset. RMS is a good estimate of single trial noise in EEG
data, as it is equivalent to the average absolute voltage difference around the baseline. To

estimate an RMS distribution for each subject in the dataset, we used a permutation test that
selects a different set of 290 epochs without replacement for each participant on each of 10,000
permutations before running second order statistics (Laszlo et al., 2014; Mathewson et al., 2017).
For each condition and each permutation, a grand average single-trial RMS was calculated and
recorded. Figure 3C depicts a histogram of these grand averaged single-trial RMS values
computed for each permutation and each condition. Below this is a bar graph of the mean and
standard deviation of the grand average distributions of RMS permutations. These plots
demonstrate a clear distinction in single-trial noise for the two conditions. The park condition
(MRMS-EEG = 7.9101; SDRMS-EEG = 0.028742) clearly demonstrated larger single-trial noise levels
compared to the roadway condition (MRMS-EEG = 7.4782; SDRMS-EEG = 0.027245; Wilcoxon
signed rank test; z = 86.6047; p < 0.001).
3.4 ERP Baseline Analysis
We ran a similar permutation analysis to test for noise that was not effectively averaged
out across trials on noise levels within trial averaged ERPs. We again used a permutation test of
the baseline RMS values to quantify the amount of noise in the participant average ERPs. This
analysis is complementary to the above single-trial analysis, as the computation estimates the
amount of phase-locked EEG data noise which is not averaged out over the trial with respect to
tone onset. The computation randomly selected and averaged 290 of each participant‚Äôs standard
artefact-removed trials without replacement. The obtained RMS values were then averaged over
EEG electrode channels to create a grand average of all participants. This made 10,000
permutations after averaging each participant‚Äôs data together to compute second-order statistics.
Figure 3F shows a bar graph of the means of these distributions, with error bars to indicate the
standard deviation of the permutation mean distributions. The histogram in Figure 3E depicts the

grand average RMS values calculated from these 10,000 permutations in each condition. The
park condition (MRMS-ERP = 0.52253; SDRMS-ERP = 0.020995) had a higher RMS value compared
to the roadway conditions (MRMS-ERP = 0.48798; SDRMS-ERP = 0.019317; Wilcoxon signed rank
test: z = 79.3401; p <0.001).

3.5 ERP Morphology and Topography
Grand average ERPs calculated from each participant‚Äôs corrected and artefact-removed
standard and target tones at electrode Pz are depicted in Figure 4A. Similar error levels can be
observed within the two conditions. Evident from the plots is the expected P3 amplitude increase
during target trials in the posterior topographical locations (Pz; Figure 4B). The expected oddball
difference in the P3 is shown with an increased positive voltage between 300 and 430 ms
following the infrequent target tones, compared with the common standard tones. We used this
time window for all further analysis of the P3. Additionally evident in the Figure 4A plots is a
target-standard difference in the MMN/N2b time window, with increased negative voltage from
175-275 ms following infrequent targets tones compared to common standard tones. This time
window was used for any further MMN/N2b analysis, using the Fz electrode, as the effect is
visibly maximal in frontal regions (Figure 4B).
Figure 4B shows topographies of these target-standard differences within the MMN/N2b
and P3 time windows. The MMN/N2b time window topography demonstrates the expected
frontal scalp activation distribution for both conditions, while the P3 topographies reveal the

expected activation distribution toward the back of the head. Figure 4C plots the ERP difference
waves at electrode Pz, which are created by subtracting the standard tone ERPs from target tone
ERPs for each subject. The shaded bars represent the standard-error of the difference, and
estimation of error is therefore an equivalent to that used in the t-test of the target-standard
difference from zero (Loftus & Masson, 1994).
Both conditions demonstrated a clear negative peak at approximately 230 ms at the Fz
electrode. To test for the MMN/N2b effect, we ran a one-tailed, paired samples t-test comparing
the MMN/N2b averaged over the 175-275 ms time window centered around this peak at
electrode Fz to zero. This test revealed a significant MMN/N2b effect for both the park condition
(Mdiff=-2.4188; SDpark=2.3427; t(9) =-3.2649; p=0.0048811) and roadway condition (M diff=2.2506; SDtraffic=1.9142; t(9) =-3.718; p=0.0023928). Additionally, a clear positive peak was
observed as expected at approximately 380 ms at electrode Pz. A one-tailed paired samples t-test
was used to compare this P3 difference averaged over the 300-430ms time window at electrode
Pz to zero revealed a significant P3 effect in both the park (Mdiff=2.8799; SD park=3.37; t(9)
=2.7024; p=0.012148) and roadway (Mdiff=2.8932; SDroadway=3.3644; t(9) =2.7194; p=0.011815)

3.6 ERP Differences and Statistical Power
Figure 5A shows differences waves plotted for both conditions at electrodes Pz and Fz.
Evident from the graphs is no significant MMN/N2b or P3 differences between the two
conditions at Fz and Pz, respectively. A two-tailed t-test between the park and roadway
conditions was performed to test for differences in the targets-standards P3 difference between
conditions at electrode Pz, finding no significant difference (Mdiff=-0.013282; SDdiff=1.5997; t(9)
=-0.026255; p=0.97963). The same test was performed to test for any differences between
conditions in targets-standards difference waves within the averaged 175-275 ms time-window at
electrode Fz, and found no significant differences (Mdiff=-0.16821; SDdiff=1.3555; t(9) =0.39241; p=0.70389).
As there is a possibility that the MMN and N2b contribute differentially to the
MMN/N2b effect (Scanlon et al., 2017), we separated this window in order to analyze averages
of the early MMN time period (100-200 ms) and the later N2b time period (200-300 ms). We
found no significant differences between conditions in the targets-standards difference when the
t-test was applied to either the MMN (at Fz: Mdiff=0.021454; SDdiff=0.80884; t(9) =0.083877;
p=0.93499; at Pz: Mdiff=0.21574; SDdiff=0.75063; t(9) =0.90885; p=0.38712) or N2b time
window (at Pz: Mdiff=0.19951; SDdiff=1.487; t(9) =0.42427; p=0.68133; at Fz: Mdiff=-0.2088;
SDdiff=1.4541; t(9) =-0.45407; p=0.66053). It is likely that both the MMN and N2b were elicited
within this time window, however with the current design we were unable to disentangle these
components from each other. Therefore from here on, we will focus on the combined MMN/N2b
time window between 175 and 275 ms.
Following the evidence of increased trial-averaged and single-trial noise during the park
conditions, one may expect this to result in lower statistical power in the park condition. In order

to test this prediction, we used an analysis procedure similar to those used by Kappenman &
Luck (2010), Laszlo et al. (2014) and Mathewson et al. (2017). a permutation procedure was
used in which the 4:1 ratio of standard to target trials was kept constant while increasing the
number of these trials that are able to contribute to the ERP average. Number of trials increased
from 4 standard and 1 target trial, by 20 standard trials, up to 280 standard and 70 target trials.
We then chose a random selection of this number of trials from each participant‚Äôs data with
replacement, and averaged over subjects to obtain grand averages. This random replacement
procedure was used for both the MMN/N2b analysis at Fz and P3 analysis at Pz, and separately
for each condition. For each number of trials, 10,000 permutations of this procedure was done.
Note that this procedure cannot be used to examine changes in ERP morphology over time on the
task due to habituation or attention, and assumes that these influences would be observed equally
across conditions and stimuli (Scanlon et al., 2017).
The selected single trials for each permutation were averaged together to create separate
participant ERPs for target and standard tones. Target-standard differences were computed
between 175 and 275 ms at electrode Fz and between 300 and 430 ms at electrode Pz in order to
measure average MMN/N2b and P3 values, respectively. We then used a one tailed paired
samples t-test to test for differences between targets and standards (df = 9, ùõº=0.05). Figure 5B
demonstrates plots of the proportion of the 10,000 permutations in which the obtained p-value
was passed the significance threshold as a function of the number of standards and targets
selected in each permutation. Evident from this plot, the MMN/N2b for roadway condition
required fewer trials (120 standard/30 target trials) to reach significance in 80% of permutations
(gray line depicts 80% power) than the park condition (140 standard/35 target trials). The
opposite effect is shown for the P3, in which the park condition appears to require fewer trials

graph plots the proportions of the 10,000 permutations in which an uncorrected significant
difference was obtained. The dashed horizontal line at 0.8 indicates the threshold to achieve 80%
power to find an existing effect. The gray line represents a square root of the number of standard
trials, scaled to a range between 0 and 1 on the vertical axis by dividing by the square root of the
maximum number of trials.

3.7 N1 and P2 Amplitudes
In order to observe the effects of two different environments on general stimulus
processing, grand averaged ERPs with a comparison of park vs. roadway at the Fz and Pz
electrode locations are plotted in Figure 6A and B, respectively. A visual inspection of these
plots shows increased amplitude in the N1 component (100-175 ms) in the roadway condition,
both in targets and standards and at electrodes Fz and Pz. Two-tailed paired t-tests of these
differences indicated significantly larger N1 amplitude during the roadway compared to the park
condition at Fz (standards: Mdiff=0.92109; SDdiff=1.1408; t(9) =2.5533; p=0.031024; targets:
Mdiff=1.0752; SDdiff=1.433; t(9) =2.3727; p=0.041723) and Pz (standards: Mdiff=0.87623;
SDdiff=1.0001; t(9) =2.7706; p=0.021733; targets: Mdiff=1.0437; SDdiff=1.1443; t(9) =2.8844;
p=0.018049). Figure 6C plots topographies of these differences, indicating a frontocentral
distribution.
Additionally, as previous studies have shown increased background noise to decrease the
amplitude of the P2 component between 175 and 275 ms, one may expect to observe a similar
effect in which the roadway condition shows a lower P2 amplitude. However, evident from the
plots in Figure 6A and B, no difference in P2 amplitude exists between the two conditions. Twotailed paired samples t-tests revealed no significant P2 amplitude differences between conditions

3.8 Combined experimental analyses
Figure 7A, B and C shows three bar graphs of N1 amplitude, P2 amplitude and alpha
power, respectively, compared across 5 experiments which all used the oddball task (Scanlon et
al., 2017a; Scanlon et al., 2017b; Scanlon et al., under review; Scanlon et al., In preparation;
Current study). Four of these experiments used the same auditory oddball task, while the fifth
used a visual oddball task, and is therefore only included on the plot of alpha power. All of these
experiments were performed on different participants. Experiment 1 is a previous study in which
participants performed an auditory oddball task on a stationary bicycle (Scanlon et al., 2017a).
While performing the oddball task, participants were asked to sit still (pre), pedal sub-aerobically
(bike) and sit still again (post). Experiment 2 is a previous study in which participants performed
the oddball task both while sitting inside a laboratory faraday cage (inside) and cycling outside
the lab (outside; Scanlon et al., 2017b). In experiment 3, participants performed the auditory
oddball task with four different background noise and volume conditions (Scanlon et al., under
review). The task was performed with the presence of background outdoor sounds recorded near
a roadway (sound), with the presence of background white noise (white), with a silent
background and the tones played at reduced volume (silent low), and with a silent background
and regular tone volume (silent). In experiment 4 participants performed a visual oddball task
with two visual backgrounds. The backgrounds were a static or ‚Äòsnowstorm‚Äô screen and a pointof-view video of someone cycling through traffic (Scanlon et al., In preparation). Experiment 5
is the current study, with the oddball task performed in the quiet park (park) and next to the noisy

roadway (roadway). Figure 7A shows the N1 amplitudes to standard tones in 11 conditions from
four experiments using the same auditory oddball task. Evident from the graph is that
experimental conditions in which the participant performed the task in non-ideal auditory
conditions (e.g. with background noise or low volume; shades of green and yellow) show
generally larger N1 amplitudes than when the task was performed in ideal situations (silent
background, normal volume; shades of grey). Figure 7B depicts the P2 amplitudes to standard
tones in 11 conditions from four experiments using the same auditory oddball task. The graph
shows that experimental conditions in which the participant performed the task with background
noise (shades of green) have generally lower P2 amplitude than those in which the task was
performed in silence (shades of grey and yellow). Figure 7C demonstrates the alpha power for
standard tones in 13 conditions within five experiments using either auditory or visual oddball
tasks. Evident from the plot is that experimental conditions in which the participant viewed
visually rich stimuli had generally lower alpha power than those conditions in which the
participant viewed a blank screen during the experiment.

4. Discussion
The present study directly examined the effectiveness of recording ERPs during mobile
cycling in two different outdoor environments, using a backpack to contain and carry the EEG
system outside of the lab. We implemented new compact methods for stimulus presentation
(Kuziek et al., 2017) through the use of a Raspberry Pi computer to present the auditory oddball
task through headphones and to mark stimulus events within the EEG data for analysis. We also
used a tablet computer to store the marked EEG data via Brain Products v-AMP 16-channel
amplifier as the EEG system. We used active electrodes based on previous findings which
showed favorable results for active electrodes compared to other electrode types in mobile EEG
(Oliviera et al., 2016) and high impedance levels (Lazlo et al. 2014; see also Mathewson et al.
2017). Active electrodes have also been used to effectively record mobile EEG in previous
studies within our lab (Scanlon et al. 2017a; Scanlon et al., 2017b). During the experiment
participants were asked to avoid moving their heads from side to side or looking around the
scenery to mitigate data noise due to movement. However in future studies we will aim to reduce
the need for movement constraints to allow for free observation of the environment while
cycling. This has been shown to be possible in previous ERP studies during video game play

(Maclin et al., 2011; Mathewson et al., 2012). We hope to combine this mobile EEG recording
with first person video recordings in the future.
4.1 Behavioural differences
As in previous studies (Scanlon et al., 2017a; Scanlon et al., 2017b; Scanlon et al., under
review; Scanlon et al., In preparation), the ERP differences between conditions did not appear to
contribute to behavioural differences in the oddball task, as there were no significant differences
in reaction time between conditions. This indicates that the N1 may reflect a compensatory
process, allowing the mind to put greater focus on a target when distractions are present.
However, a marginal increase in response rate in the roadway condition may indicate an increase
in attention to the task tones in that condition, which can also be related to the increased N1
component amplitude in that condition.
4.2 Data noise
As expected, we were able to overcome noise created by mobile cycling and collect
laboratory quality ERPs (Figure 3A), however it appears that the park condition had a larger
amount of baseline noise than the roadway condition (Figure 3), with higher RMS in the baseline
EEG period for both trial averaged ERP and single-trial data. This may have possibly been due
to slightly higher levels of elevation change within the park. While we were careful to find two
environments that were similar in elevation, real world studies often have the constraint of being
unable to change what the current study can access in the real world. However, the increases in
single-trial noise were less than half the magnitude of the increases in noise observed between
sitting still and cycling outside in a previous study (Scanlon et al., 2017b), in which the ERPs
recorded appeared largely unaffected by this difference. Additionally, the ERP trial averaged
RMS was increased in the park condition to a much smaller degree than the single trial RMS.

This indicates that a great deal of the noise added was not stimulus locked and was mitigated by
trial averaging. This effect can also be seen in increased beta power (15-30Hz) at Fz in the park
condition, possibly also due to this increase in mechanical noise, similar to increased highfrequency oscillations in the beta range found in previous studies during stationary pedaling
(Scanlon et al., 2017a) and outdoor biking (Scanlon et al., 2017b) compared to rest.
Following this observation of increased single-trial and trial-averaged noise in the park
condition, one may expect to also see decreased statistical power in the park condition. However
this was not the case, as when we analyzed ERP power as a function of the number of resampled
trials required to achieve 80% significance, we observed that neither condition was better at both
components we analyzed. While the MMN/N2b required 20 more standard and 5 more target
trials to reach significance in the park condition, the P3 required 40 fewer standard and 10 fewer
target trials in this condition. This pattern was opposite, with respect to noise, to what was
previously observed in the comparison between laboratory and outdoor mobile environments, as
the condition with more data noise observed more statistical power for the MMN/N2b and less
for the P3. This implies that the statistical power may be more affected by ERP differences than
RMS baseline noise.
4.3 MMN and P3 morphology
As expected there were no significant differences observed between the two conditions
for the P3 and MMN/N2b components. As the participants were performing the same dual task
in both conditions, it appears that the P3 component was equally reduced between the two
conditions. This is evident because the peak amplitude for the P3 for both conditions was
approximately 2 ùúáV lower than those observed in previous studies done by this lab in which
there was no concurrent task (Scanlon et al., 2017a; Scanlon et al., 2017b). Given the well-

established observation that performing a secondary task during an auditory oddball task will
reduce cognitive resources available for the task, therefore decreasing target-standard P3
amplitude (Wicken et al., 1983; Polich, 1987; Kramer & Strayer, 1988; Polich & Kok, 1995),
this observation was not unexpected.
4.4 N1 and P2 morphology
Previous studies indicated that ambient noise during an oddball task decreased the P2 and
increase N1 amplitude for both standards and targets during the auditory oddball task due to a
process of filtering out irrelevant sounds in order to perform the task (Scanlon et al., 2017b;
Scanlon et al., Under review). We initially expected that we would find a similar difference in
this study, with a reduced P2 and increased N1 while participants were cycling next to noisy
roadway compared to the quiet park. However this was not the case, as no significant differences
were found for the P2 component. This may indicate that the excess noise of the roadway did not
sufficiently create the necessity to filter out ambient noise, or, that this noise filtering process
was present during both conditions. If one compares the current study to Scanlon et al. (2017a)
or Scanlon et al. (2017b), the P2 amplitude in both current conditions appears to be at least 2 ùúáV
smaller than the indoor conditions of the previous studies. This leads us to deduce that the lower
amount of ambient noise in the park condition was sufficient for the P2 to be reduced to an equal
degree as the roadway condition, and therefore this effect was observed equally in both
conditions. In contrast to this however, there was a significant difference in the N1 between the
two conditions with a larger N1 amplitude while participants performed the task near the
roadway. This is consistent with the increase in ambient noise shown in previous studies. This
deviation indicates that while the N1 and P2 had previously been assumed to be modulated
simultaneously to represent the same process, this may not be the case. Here, it appears that the

level of ambient background noise had the ability to augment the N1, but any amount of ambient
noise is sufficient to reduce the P2.
The N1-P2 complex is believed to be reflective of pre-attentive sound processing within
the auditory cortex (N√§√§t√§nen & Picton, 1987). The components of this complex, including the
P1, N1 and P2 have been demonstrated to relate to several temporally overlapping processes
which originate near or within the primary auditory cortex (N√§√§t√§nen & Picton, 1987; Wolpaw
and Penry, 1975; Wood & Wolpaw, 1982). P2 in particular has been shown to relate to cognitive
functions such as working memory, memory performance and semantic processing during
contextually based tasks (Dunn et al., 1998; Federmeier & Kutas, 2002; Lefebvre et al., 2005).
The P2 is also thought to reflect a component of top-down cognition and perceptual processing,
and may represent a process of inhibiting one‚Äôs perception of unimportant or repetitive stimuli in
order to perform a task (Luck & Hillyard, 1994; Freunberger et al., 2007). Additionally, the P2
has been hypothesized to reflect a process of suppressing the perception of irrelevant stimuli to
allow stimulus discrimination within a primary task (Potts et al., 1996; Potts, 2004; Kim et al.,
2008; Getzmann et al., 2016). The auditory P2 appears to relate to the subjective difficulty of
stimulus discrimination, as both the auditory P2 and N1-P2 complex have been reliably found to
have increased amplitude following discrimination training (Atienza et al., 2002; Hayes et al.,
2003; Reinke et al., 2003; Trainor et al., 2003; Tremblay et al., 1997, 2002, 2001). More
specifically to our task, one study showed a decrease in auditory P2 amplitude during a speech
discrimination task while participants had to ignore irrelevant background speech in a ‚Äòcocktail
party‚Äô scenario, compared to a condition with no background distractions (Getzmann et al.,
2016). This could explain why the P2 appears to have been reduced in both conditions, as the

auditory P2 appears to be reduced any time stimulus discrimination in the task is more difficult,
and therefore any amount of ambient noise could have this effect.
While the N1 and P2 are clearly related in a cluster of processes that take place within the
N1-P2 complex, they appear here to serve similar but distinct functions. Previous research has
proposed that the N1 itself appears to reflect several different auditory processes, with up to six
distinct components (N√§√§t√§nen & Picton, 1987). The most alterable of these being influenced by
several contextual factors including a ‚Äòsensory acceptance-rejection‚Äô factor, which appears to
attenuate all responses to uninteresting, irrelevant or unpleasant sensory inputs while enhancing
responses to pleasant, interesting or important stimuli. The N1 tends to appear with shorter
latency and larger amplitude when the attended and unattended sounds can be easily
distinguished by physical cues such as pitch or location (N√§√§t√§nen, 1982, 1992). For example,
the N1 has been shown to increase when an auditory stimulus occurs in the location where an
individual is attending, (Teder-S√§lej√§rvi, et al. 1998) to allow an individual to enhance the
auditory perception of this stimuli. This effect is increased in individuals who are blind (Roder et
al., 1999). Overall, N1 amplitude is said to increase as a function of increased attentional
allocation to a particular auditory input channel, which correlates to increased behavioural
accuracy for targets in that channel (Hink, Voorhis, Hillyard, & Smith, 1977). Functionally, the
amplitude and latency of the N1 is believed to represent the quantity of sensory information
moving through an early auditory channel selection mechanism selection (Hillyard. Hink,
Schwent, & Picton, 1973), greater processing of attended channel information (Okita, 1981;
N√§√§t√§nen, 1982), as well as how well-matched the eliciting stimulus and cue characteristics are
within the attended auditory input channel (N√§√§t√§nen, 1992). In this study, it appears that while
participants had to filter out noise in both conditions, the roadway condition required a larger

amount of attention and processing of the task tones in order to perform the task, and therefore
the N1 was increased and response rate was marginally increased in this condition.
4.5 Experimental set-up
In this study participants were asked to cycle as slow as they could comfortably go in
order to minimize movement noise in both conditions. Therefore we believe that none of the
effects on ERP's or data noise were due to the effect of exercise on the brain. The purpose of
cycling in this study, similar to our previous work with stationary cycling (Scanlon et al., 2017a)
and outdoor cycling (Scanlon et al., 2017b), was to allow a type of movement during tasks which
minimizes data noise created by wire movements. For example, during walking and running, an
individual's head will often move up and down with each step, allowing wire movements and
artifacts to be created, while cycling allows one to move in a relatively smooth straight-forward
motion. However cycling is commonly used activity which requires steering control, balance,
situational awareness to be done properly, which makes this a unique and rich activity to be
explored within cognitive neuroscience.
This experimental setup also has some drawbacks in terms of the amount of equipment
required to be carried around with the participant in the backpack. A large tablet computer was
used for EEG data acquisition, while a small Raspberry Pi was used for stimulus presentation.
We have recently started testing the use of miniature computer systems, such as the Latte Panda,
and plan to use this in future studies. Further, the amplifier used was bulky and required long
electrode wires to reach from the head to the backpack. Recent advances with EEG systems
which are wireless and made specifically for mobile EEG (Debener et al., 2015; Zink et al.,
2016; Hashemi et al., 2016; Krigolson et al., 2017) would greatly improve the portability of our
system.

4.6 Combined Experimental comparisons
Figure 7 depicts the main measures (i.e. the N1, P2 and alpha power) from all four
studies in this thesis as well as another previous study using the same task. Figure 7A
demonstrates that experimental conditions in which the participant performed the task in nonideal conditions (i.e., with background noise or low volume) had a higher N1 amplitude than
conditions in which the task was performed in ideal conditions (i.e. silent background with
normal volume). This demonstrates the effect of attention on N1 amplitude, as non-ideal
conditions require the participant to 'tune in' to the stimulus more than they might have to in ideal
conditions. Figure 7B shows that experimental conditions in which the participant performed the
task in the presence of background sounds had generally lower P2 amplitude than conditions in
which the task was performed in silence. This helps to demonstrate the way the P2 represents
'tuning out' distracting sounds in auditory tasks. The dichotomy between the functions of the N1
and P2 can especially be seen in the silent-low condition of experiment 2, as this condition had
an enhanced N1 with a non-affected P2, demonstrating that the low-volume task required
enhanced attention, with no requirement to tune out irrelevant information. The two conditions
of experiment 4 also demonstrate this dichotomy, as both of these conditions have a larger N1
amplitude than any of the conditions performed in an ideal auditory situation, and the roadway
condition has a significantly higher N1 than the park condition. However the P2 amplitude for
both of these outdoor conditions is near zero and much lower than any condition in which the
task was performed in silence, demonstrating that while there was no P2 difference within this
experiment, the P2 was likely reduced in both conditions due to background sounds in the
outdoor environment.

Figure 7C demonstrates that conditions in which the participants performed the task
while viewing a visually rich stimulus had generally lower alpha power than those in which the
task was performed while viewing a blank computer screen. This demonstrates the way alpha
relates to visual attention and ecologically valid environments, as alpha has been shown to
increase with decreasing attentional focus, with especially high power when an individual's eyes
are closed (Berger, 1929; Adrian & Matthews, 1934; Mathewson et al., 2011). Here it appears
that when participants are drawn to pay attention to the visual aspects of their environment, alpha
is reduced. In comparison, when tasks are performed in visually impoverished environments,
alpha appears to be high because there is nothing to draw their visual attention.
4.7 Future directions
This research program had the ultimate goal of measuring ERPs which naturally occur in
the real world, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the brain functions in during
everyday life. We have recently begun testing EEG set-up which uses video capture and coding
to identify moments in the EEG data when interesting events happen in an individual's
environment. We have also started to test the use of virtual reality (VR) to create environments
and allow stimulus presentation, which also opens up the possibility of testing the brain in any
unlimited number of simulated environments.
4.8 Conclusion
In this study we showed that we were able to carry out a fully mobile cycling ERP study
in which the environment itself is the independent variable. We also demonstrated that the
environment in which one performs a task is enough to alter brain activity, and that the N1 and
P2, while functionally related, clearly represent two separate processed in the early auditory
system. It appears that the N1 increases when a situation requires increased attentiveness to a

stimulus, while the P2 is altered any time the auditory task is more difficult to discriminate. As
shown in previous studies, this effect appears to be independent of movement, alpha power and
behavioural measures.
