Abstract
The Estrogen Receptor (ER) drives 75% of breast cancers. On activation,
the ER recruits specific co-factors to form a transcriptionally active complex.
These co-factors can modulate tumour growth and understanding their roles
can help to identify new therapeutic targets.
We applied a quantitative proteomics method, qPLEX-RIME , to analyse
the ER protein complex and characterise changes in protein-protein interactions on activation. Our analysis identified ZMIZ1 as novel co-factor within
the ER chromatin-bound complex, extending its known role as a co-factor of
the Androgen Receptor. We find further evidence for an ER–ZMIZ1 interaction by showing that both proteins are co-expressed in biopsy samples. We
characterise ZMIZ1 function by showing that targeting ZMIZ1 results in the
reduction of ER transcriptional activity and significantly reduces the proliferation of ER-positive cell lines. We validated these results genome-wide by
RNA-seq and identified that targeting ZMIZ1 resulted in a specific reduction
of estradiol-induced cell cycle genes.
These results establish ZMIZ1 as a having a key role in the ability of the
ER to activate key genes that drive the proliferation of breast cancer, and
its biological importance in patient tumours.

1. Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide.
Stratification of the disease into multiple sub-types improved patient outcomes by targeting subtype-specific drivers [11].
ER positive breast cancer. Approximately 75% of breast cancers are classified as Estrogen Receptor (ER) positive. In these cancers, the ER is no
longer correctly regulated, subverts cell division regulation, and becomes the
driving transcription factor in the tumour [16]. Only a few primary breast
cancers have mutations in the ER [19], yet the transcriptional activity is
frequently abnormal [3]. In many metastatic tumours the ER is still active
and drives the growth of the tumour with a reduced dependence on estrogen
or in a ligand-independent manner [25, 31]. This critical role for the ER in
disease progression has therefore made the protein a key target for therapeutics like Fulvestrant [20] and Tamoxifen [10]. More recently, Tamoxifen
has been prescribed as a preventive treatment in high-risk healthy patients
to successfully reduce their chances of developing breast cancer [6]. Most
women benefit from endocrine therapy with 50-70% of cases responding to
treatment. However, relapse is very common with the risk ranging from 10
to 41% [21].
Co-factors of the ER. One strategy to overcome relapse focusses on co-factors
of the ER. The majority of ER binding sites are at distal enhancer elements [4]. On binding to these sites the receptor catalyses the formation of
chromatin loops and recruits several co-activators along with the mediator
complex. It is through these interactions that the ER is able to facilitate the
activation of RNA Pol II at the promoters of target genes [17]. Without the
coordination of the ER and these co-factors it therefore is not possible for
the efficient transcription of target genes to occur.
Further characterisation of ER co-factors could therefore be essential to
identify targets for novel treatment strategies. Successful examples of cofactor based approaches include studies demonstrating that the GREB1-EREZH2 transcriptional axis is directly involved in tamoxifen resistance [35]
or identifying the pioneer-factor FOXA1 as a key opportunity for future
interventions [18, 2]. This study aims to lay the ground work for future cofactor based therapies by presenting proteomic and genomic evidence that

ZMIZ1 is co-expressed with ER in patient tumours and that the inhibition
in ZMIZ1 reduces the ability of the ER to promote the cell cycle within ER+
breast cancer tumour cells.

2.1. qPLEX-RIME of ER activation identifies novel co-factor ZMIZ1
We used qPLEX-RIME, a state-of-the-art method for quantifying proteinprotein interactions within nuclear receptor complexes [22], to quantitatively
monitor the changes in protein-protein interactions in the ER complex after
activating it with estradiol at 0 and 45 minutes across four isogenic replicates
(Figure 1A).
Detected protein-ER interactions that were both found to significantly
change on stimulation with estradiol (p < 0.05) and had a two-fold change
in protein intensity were reviewed for known biology. We found several previously identified ER co-factors including RARA, CBP, EP300, NRIP1 and
GATA3. We also detected SUMO1-3 within the ER complex, most likely as
a result of the covalent modification of the estrogen receptor or another protein within the ER chromatin-bound complex, in agreement with previous
ChIP-seq experiments [32]. In addition, we also found putative novel protein
partners of ER (Figure 1B).
The list of potential new ER cofactors includes ZMIZ1 (Figure 1C), which
had previously been identified as a co-activator of the Androgen Receptor
(AR) [15, 28]. However, despite activating AR, transfection of ZMIZ1 into
CV-1 cells was not able to enhance GR, PR, ER, and VDR-mediated transcription [28]. This result has since been incorporated in the GeneCards
and Uniprot databases [33]. Unpublished yeast data, discussed by [28], supports the conclusion that there is no interaction between ZMIZ1 and non-AR
nuclear receptors.
Given that our qPLEX-RIME data shows a significant interaction between ER and ZMIZ1 in the breast cancer setting, and that we did not
detect the presence of AR, we considered the breast cancer specific function
of ZMIZ1 to be of key interest for follow-up studies.
2.2. ZMIZ1 knock-down reduces ER transcriptional activity
We hypothesised that as our breast cancer model was able to support the
ER-ZMIZ1 interaction that ZMIZ1 may have a transcriptional role, in the
ER complex.

To determine if ZMIZ1’s role within the ER complex regulated transcriptional activity we monitored the changes in ER activity on knockdown of
ZMIZ1 with siRNA using a Cignal Reporter Assay. The activity of the ER
was monitored in two models of ER-positive breast cancer, MCF7 and T47D,
along with MDA-MB-231, a model of Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Estrogen receptor activity was measured by a luciferase activity assay relative to
a constitutive active positive control. Renilla luciferase activity was used to
control for transaction efficiency.
Both MCF7 and T47D (Figure 2A) cell lines showed significantly reduced
ER activity (P < 0.044 and P < 0.0045 respectively, paired t-test, onetailed, n = 4). As expected, MDA-BM-231 showed no detectable ER activity,
and therefore no significant difference between the siZMIZ1 and siCTRL
conditions or between the experimental conditions and the negative control.
These results confirm that ZMIZ1’s role is specific to the ER+ breast cancer
sub-types and that expression of the ER was essential for the effect seen.
2.3. ZMIZ1 knock-down delays response to E2 in ER regulated genes
Since knockdown of ZMIZ1 leads to a significant reduction in ER transcriptional activity we hypothesised that knockdown of ZMIZ1 would also
result in a reduced response to E2 at downstream targets of the ER.
To test this hypothesis we set up a paired RNA-seq experiment treating
MCF7 cells with either siZMIZ1 or siCTRL. In both cases we undertook four
isogenic replicates, measuring transcriptional levels at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours
after stimulation with estradiol.
Between the siZMIZ1 and control condition, the largest number of differentially expressed genes occurred at 6 hours after stimulation with E2
(30 hours after initial knockdown). In contrast, by 24 hours (48 hours after
knockdown of ZMIZ1) only 14 genes were detected as differentially expressed.
Analysis of the 6 hour time-point (siZMIZ1 vs siCTRL) by Gene Set Enrichment Analyis (GSEA)[29] for enrichment of ER responsive genes gave
conflicting results. We identified three published gene sets relevant to the
cell culture models used: STEIN_ESR1_TARGETS and BHAT_ESR1_TARGETS_
NOT_VIA_AKT1_UP described the genes regulated by the ER in the MCF7
cell line, while WILLIAMS_ESR1_TARGETS_UP reflected genes activated on the
stimulation of the ER with estradiol in the T47D cell line. GSEA analysis of the differential expression at 6 hours of stimulation with E2 in MCF7
for STEIN_ESR1_TARGETS gave a non-significant reduction (p = 0.07), BHAT_
ESR1_TARGETS_NOT_VIA_AKT1_UP gave a significant increase (p = 0.003), and

Figure 2: (A) Lucierase Assay monitoring ER activity. ER activity in MCF7, T47D and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines was monitored by Cignal ERE Reporter Assay. Both MCF7 and
T47D cells showed a significant reduction in ER activity in response to ZMIZ1 knockdown.
As expected, MDA-MB-231 cells showed no activity in all conditions but the positive, constitutively active, control.(B) Knockdown of ZMIZ1 in three cell lines, T47D, MCF7 and
MDA-MB-231 all showed reduced proliferation. The effect was largest in the ER-postive
cell lines, T47D and MCF7. We inferred the increased response to ZMIZ1 knockdown to
imply that as ER singalling is the main driver in these two cell lines that ZMIZ1 expression
levers had the greatest effect. In contrast the response in MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative
breast cancer model, implies that ZMIZ1 has additional functionality independent of the
estrogen receptor transcriptional complex, but this has a lesser effect on cell growth than
its role in ER positive breast cancer.

WILLIAMS_ESR1_TARGETS_UP showed a significant reduction in ER transcriptional response (p = 0.047). Overall overlap of all 3 gene sets is low with
3 genes in common. The STEIN_ESR1_TARGETS gene set has 25% overlap
with the other two sets, while the WILLIAMS_ESR1_TARGETS_UP gene set,
and BHAT_ESR1_TARGETS_NOT_VIA_AKT1_UP have 46% and 9% overlap respectively with the rest of the genes sets Given the ER’s role in regulating cell
cycle [9], we undertook GSEA against three MSigDB gene sets [29] focused
on cell cycle: GO CELL CYCLE, KEGG CELL CYCLE, and REACTOME CELL CYCLE.
All three gene sets gave a significant results (p = 2.3 ×10−6 ,0.0001 & 3.5
×10−7 respectively).
On the basis of these results, we hypothesised that ZMIZ1 regulated a
subset of ER-regulated genes focused on cell cycle. The varied results for
GSEA of ER specific sets could then be explained as a result in variation in
genes represented in each of MSigDB gene sets and a lack of specificity to ERZMIZ1 signalling axis. To test our hypothesis were undertook GSEA against
the intersection of the REACTOME CELL CYCLE and the previously tested ER
specific gene sets (p = 0.0006). Repeating the analysis in T47D cell gave p
= 0.005 (Figure S1).
2.4. ZMIZ1 knock-down reduces proliferation of breast cancer cell lines
On the basis of these results, we tested the hypothesis that knockdown
of the ZMIZ1 protein would result in reduced proliferation of ER-positive
cancer cell line models.
Analysis of two ER-positive (MCF7 and T47D) and one triple negative
breast cancer model (MDA-MB-231) showed that knockdown of ZMIZ1 reduced cell proliferation in all three cell lines. The effect was greatest in
the ER positive cell-lines, T47D and MCF7, with T47D growth reaching a
maximum at a reduced confluence compared to the control experiments. In
contrast, the magnitude of the reduction in growth was more modest in the
MDA-MB-231 cell line and the rate of recovery was much higher. The susceptibility of T47D and MCF7 to ZMIZ1 knockdown is likely due to the specific
reliance of these cells on ER for cell growth, while in the MDA-MB-231 cell
line ZMIZ1 likely regulates a second ER-independent pathway (Figure 2B).
2.5. ZMIZ1 and ER activities correlate in patient samples
If ZMIZ1 is a key component of the ER complex, we would expect its
activity to be higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative breast cancer. To
test this hypothesis, we used two large gene expression collections, TCGA [34]

and METABRIC [5], to assess co-expression of ER and ZMIZ1 in a patient
setting. In both data sets, ZMIZ1 had significantly increased expression in
luminal over basal sub-types (TCGA: p=1.34 × 10−23 , Wilcoxon test, n=962;
METABRIC: p=1.18 × 10−10 , Wilcoxon text, n=961).
To address if both ZMIZ1 and ER proteins were transcriptionally active
within patient samples we then generated regulatory network models for both
the TCGA and METABRIC data sets using ARACNe-AP[12]. Using these
networks, we applied the VIPER algorithm[1] to calculate the activity of ER
and ZMIZ1 proteins in both patient sample data-sets (Figure 3B). For both
TCGA and METABRIC we saw a significant correlation (p=4.77×10−85 and
p=1.02 × 10−139 , respectively) between the activity of the two transcription
factors, with greatest activity of both TF networks in the luminal sub-type.
2.6. ZMIZ1 and ER are co-localised in patient samples
To further validate the link between ER and ZMIZ1, we checked if ZMIZ1
expression was co-localised with that of the ER in clinical material. Visual
inspection of ER-positive breast cancer tumours from three patients showed
strong nuclear staining of both proteins in adjacent sections. Comparison of
the localisation of staining between ER and ZMIZ1 demonstrated that both
proteins were found within the nucleus of epithelial cells, and that infiltrating
cells were absent for both of the proteins. Further, the distribution of ER
and ZMIZ1 staining correlated, suggesting the ER and ZMIZ1 are expressed
within the same cells of the patient tumours (Figure 4).
2.7. High ZMIZ1 expression correlates with low survival in ER+ patients
To explore if the role of ZMIZ1 activity held clinical importance we investigated if ZMIZ1 expression was a predictor of patient survival in the context
of both ER-positive and ER-negative tumours using KMplot[13].
Stratifying ER-positive patients by median ZMIZ1 expression showed
that ER-positive patients with higher levels of ZMIZ1 expression had significantly poorer outcome (P = 0.0023, Logrank test). In contrast, the same
analysis of ER-negative patients demonstrated no significant difference in
patient outcome (P = 0.49, Logrank test, Figure 3A).
These results were consistent with the ZMIZ1 functioning as a co-factor
of the ER in ER-positive breast cancer and that ZMIZ1 played a role in
disease progression in ER-positive breast cancer.

3. Discussion
ZMIZ1 is a known co-activator of the androgen receptor (AR) [28] and
interacts with numerous transcription factors and DNA binding proteins,
including NOTCH1 [24], and p53 [14]. ZMIZ1 is related to Protein Inhibitor
of Activated STAT (PIAS) proteins and contains a highly conserved MIZ/SPRING zinc finger domain (Figure 1C) [24, 28], which is involved in mediating
protein-protein interactions. Knockdown of ZMIZ1 in a prostate cancer cell
line has been shown to reduce proliferation [23] with ZMIZ1-mediated coactivation of AR by either direct or indirect SUMOylation of the receptor [28].
The similarities in the roles of AR in prostate and ER in breast cancer, along
with evidence that SUMOylation plays an import role in ER biology [32],
suggest that a similar mechanism could exist in ER-postive breast cancer
Our analysis in both the MCF7 and T47D cell lines (ER-positive breast
cancer models) shows a significant change in ER-mediated transcriptional
activity on ZMIZ1 knockdown. We therefore present evidence that ZMIZ1
has a role in modulating ER activated transcription that has not previously
been seen in other models. Further, we were able to show that within patient

co-localised with in the nuclei of tumour cells.
In this study, we demonstrate that ZMIZ1 is able to interact with the
ER complex and that loss of ZMIZ1 results in lower transcriptional activity.
Previously it has been shown that ZMIZ1 has a very strong trans-activation
domain (TAD) [28] and our study that is consistent with this mechanism,
suggesting that ZMIZ1 is a co-activator within the ER complex. Alternatively, ZMIZ1 may activate the ER by promoting the SUMOylation of either
the ER or its co-factors. A similar role has been seen for the AR, increasing SUMOylation by about 40% [28], and our own qPLEX-RIME analysis
of the ER shows increase identified SUMO protein modifications on stimulation estradiol. However, the mechanism by which ZMIZ1 can promote
SUMOylation remains unclear.
All nuclear receptors orchestrate their response on activation by interactions with large numbers of co-regulators [26]. Loss or gain of function
mutations that effect these co-factors may then result in a selective advantage for the tumour, or even lead to resistance to treatment [35]. In this
context, ZMIZ1’s role in mediating AR driven cell growth [28] has led to
suggestions that the protein holds an interesting opportunity for targeting
prostate cancer disease progression during androgen deprivation therapy[15].
In breast cancer the ER’s role in driving cell growth and proliferation is a key
factor in patient survival and levels of ZMIZ1 are a significant predictor of
patient outcome. These features of ZMIZ1 suggest similar potential for targeting the protein as a therapeutic opportunity limiting ER-positive breast
cancer growth. This hypothesis is further supported that our analysis of the
transcriptome after knockdown of ZMIZ1 showed a specific and significant
reduction in estrogen-mediated cell cycle gene activation.
In conclusion, further studies into the molecular basis by which ZMIZ1
regulates both ER and AR mediated transcription may provide new insight
into the biological role of ZMIZ1 in hormone driven cancers along with novel
opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

ERE activity Assay
Four biological replicates of MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 were assayed
using Cignal ERE Reporter Assay Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacture protocol. Estrogen-free culture was established as previously reported[7].
SMARTpool ZMIZ1 and control siRNA (Dharmacon) were transfected with
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
following the manufactures protocol.
Cell Growth Assay
MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell growth was monitored by incucyte.
siRNA knockdown was undertaken with SMARTpool on-target siZMIZ1 along
with the matched siCTRL (Dharmacon) and was transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufactures protocol. Cells were reverse transected, media was refreshed after 24
hours. Knockdown was confirmed by RT-qPCR.
Immunohistochemistry
De-waxing and re-hydration prior to IHC automated on the Leica ST5020,
along with the post-IHC de-hydration and clearing. Sections mounted using
Leicas coverslipper CV5030. Samples were run on Leicas Polymer Refine
Detection System (DS9800) using their standard template on the automated
Bond-III platform. The specific antibody targeting ZMIZ1 was purchased
from R&D Systems (AF8107) and used at a concentration of 2 µg/ml. The
sodium citrate pre-treatment is run at 100 ◦ C. The secondary (post primary)
was rabbit anti-sheep from Jackson ImmunoResearch (r313-005-003), diluted
1:500. DAB Enhancer is included as an ancillary reagent (Leica, AR9432).
All samples are from the PIONEER trial, REC number 17/NE/0113.
RNA-Seq
Estrogen-free culture was established as previously reported[7]. SMARTpool ZMIZ1 and control siRNA (Dharmacon) were purchased and transfected
with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufactures protocol 24 hours prior to stimulation with
100nM E2 or ethanol control. Media was refreshed before stimulation with
E2 to minimise toxicity of the transaction reagent. RNA-seq samples were
prepared using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (illumina) according to the
manufactures protocol. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq
4000 platform, and aligned with Hisat v 2.1.0. The GSEA implementation
used was from the VULCAN R-package [8].
