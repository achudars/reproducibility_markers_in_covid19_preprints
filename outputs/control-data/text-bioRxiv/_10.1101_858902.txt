Abstract
Recreational and competitive slalom waterskiing is popular among those with spinal

24

cord injuries. People with paraplegia can practice on the slalom course using a sit-ski. A

25

slalom run consists of a boat towing the sit-skier through a set of buoys and normally begins

26

with a deep-water start. Despite its popularity, very little is known about the physiological

27

aspects of the sit-skier's preparation. We examined the internal training load (TL) experienced

28

by a sit-skier with paraplegia while learning and improving the slalom deep-water starts,

29

executed with both the traditional technique and an alternative method. The TL was

30

determined by means of heart rate (HR) and session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE)

31

methods. The percentage of maximal heart rate values ranged from from 63.2% to 81.3%

32

during deep-water starts. Training sessions were performed most of the time below the

33

ventilatory threshold and tended to be qualitatively described as hard. A moderate but non-

34

significant correlation existed between HR and sRPE-based methods. We also found a

35

significant decrement in handgrip strength after practice. These findings indicate that the

36

intensity of training experienced by our sit-skier was moderate in terms of physiological

37

internal load during an adaptive slalom waterskiing training program.

TRAINING LOAD IN ADAPTIVE WATER SKIING

Introduction
In recent years, adaptive athletes have become more active and their participation

40

exponentially has increased in minor and major events. Accordingly, there is increasing

41

concern that a high level of physical conditioning and knowledge of training methodology are

42

required when preparing athletes with motor disabilities for peaking [1]. However, a limited

43

number of studies has examined adaptive sports performance training, the vast majority have

44

been specifically focused on wheelchair sports [2,3]. In contrast, much uncertainty still exists

45

about the Paralympic sporting disciplines outside the Paralympic Games. This is the case of

46

adaptive waterskiing, a sport that offers recreational opportunities for individuals with spinal

47

cord injuries (SCI) and varying degrees of abilities who are unable to stand [4].

48

The main event within sit-skiing is the discipline of slalom, in which developing a

49

repeatable technique that creates the minimum load during deep-water starts (DWSs), and the

50

ability to perform accurate DWSs, are crucial for the sit-skier’s success [5]. Deep-water

51

starting can be characterized as a static exercise where the athlete resists high tow rope loads

52

of ~2.0 – 2.5 times body weight, as reported in standing slalom waterskiers [6,7]. The

53

conventional DWS maneuver not only presents complex technical aspects but may also be

54

physically exhausting for individuals who are dependent on upper-body muscular strength

55

and endurance due to the large isometric component. Thus, various DWS methods are taught,

56

but whether a sit-skier is starting from the water independently, using an instructor-assisted

57

start technique (e.g., arm-lock, straddle or side-skier methods), or using learning aids (e.g.,

58

“deep V” handle, “Edge Triple Bar”, “boom”) [8], there is always the need to reduce the

59

required grip force and lessen the impact of fatigue [9]. Up to now, most studies in the field of

60

standing waterskiing have focused on the biomechanical characteristics and physiological

61

demands of slalom [5,7,10-13] and have adequately described a strength and conditioning

62

program [14]. Despite its relevance from a performance point of view, the nature of the

TRAINING LOAD IN ADAPTIVE WATER SKIING
63

internal training load (TL) when starting and performing the repeated movements of slalom

64

waterskiing remains unclear.

4

65

If coaches could have access to information regarding the TL that sit-skiers experience

66

while learning and improving the slalom DWS and the several repeated movements for skiing

67

to and around each of the 6 turn buoys, the training process of these skills could be improved,

68

and specific training considering the characteristics of each athlete could be carried out. This

69

goal could be achieved by registering data from parameters usually monitored in adaptive

70

sports such as heart rate (HR) or rate of perceived exertion (RPE) [3]. Also, training zones are

71

particularly useful in the case of individual sports to guide the training process [15,16]. These

72

HR and RPE-based methods could provide a point of reference for coaches to compare the

73

performance of their athletes with the data of participants in other studies, as well as to

74

monitor the skiers themselves at different times of the season.

75

Finally, handgrip strength has been previously characterized in diverse adaptive

76

athletes as a measure of physical performance [17-20], and it would be of interest to observe

77

the workload intensity-related decline in handgrip strength during adaptive waterskiing

78

practice. In this regard, athletes with SCI have been shown to commonly face overuse injuries

79

to their upper limbs [21], and considering the stress levels imposed on skiers' upper bodies

80

during the DWS [14] and its association with increased risk of injury [22], there is a need to

81

address the isometric strength testing of hand and forearm muscles of sit-skiers before and

82

immediately after a training session.

83

Under these circumstances, this case study aims to inform about the physiological

84

laboratory evaluation and the TL experienced by a sit-skier during adaptive slalom

85

waterskiing training sessions aimed at improving the DWS technique. A secondary objective

86

is to assess the effects of these training sessions on handgrip strength.

Participant

90

The athlete who took part in this case study was a 28-year-old male (height: 1.77 m,

91

body mass: 55.0 kg) with paraplegia (complete injury at T5, ASIA Impairment Scale A) [23]

92

as a result of a motor vehicle accident that occurred 7 years ago. He had 3 years of adaptive

93

waterskiing experience. He mostly practiced this sport at a cable park and during open

94

waterskiing on a reservoir, adopting a sitting position with the knees higher than the hips at a

95

tow rope length of 18.2 m. He was considered an intermediate-advanced skier [5,7], and

96

typically struggled to get out of the water without assistance, resulting in a failed or

97

thoroughly exhausting attempt. He decided to undergo training sessions to be able to get on

98

top of the water independently by learning a new DWS technique. He received a detailed

99

explanation of the study and signed the informed consent procedure. The study was approved

100

by the Ethics Committee of the University of León, Spain and conducted in accordance with

101

the Declaration of Helsinki.

102

Pretraining laboratory test

103

Cardiorespiratory fitness

104

The participant’s cardiorespiratory fitness was identified through a series of laboratory

105

tests completed two days before the training program started. An incremental test was

106

performed on an arm-crank ergometer with frictional load (Monark Rehab Trainer 881 E,

107

Monark Exercise AB, Varberg, Sweden). The test started at 5 W and the power output was

108

manually increased by 5 W every 1 min until the participant could not maintain a pedaling

109

frequency ≥ 50 rev·min-1. The HR response was measured telemetrically every 5 s (Polar

110

Team System 2, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), ECG and respiratory gas exchange

were continuously measured (Medisoft Ergocard, Medisoft Group, Sorinnes, Belgium). End

112

criteria for reaching maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were achieved: VO2 plateau (≤ 150

113

mL·min-1 with increasing workload), maximal HR equivalent to ± 10 beats·min-1 of age-

114

predicted maximal HR for upper body exercise (200 - age) [24] and a RER ≥ 1.10 [25]. The

115

ventilatory thresholds were identified separately by two researchers [26], and both researchers

116

agreed.

117

Pulmonary function

118

Pulmonary function tests were conducted following standard protocols published by

119

the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [27]. The participant performed

120

the tests in his own wheelchair and wearing a nose clip. The forced vital capacity (FVC), the

121

forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and slow vital capacity (SVC) were

122

measured using the MIR Spirobank I® portable electronic spirometer coupled to a laptop

123

computer with spirometry software WinspiroPRO® 1.3 (Medical International Research,

124

Rome, Italy).

125

Training sessions

126

The training program consisted of six sessions (3 daily sessions per week during two

127

consecutive weeks) aimed at learning, practicing, and improving two DWS techniques. The

128

traditional technique implies that the skier is sitting in the water and lets the towboat pull him

129

up on top of the water without assistance [5]. The alternative assisted technique uses “the

130

boom” (training bar) placed on the port side of the towboat9, and a short rope attached to it

131

that is eventually extended so that the sit-skier becomes aligned in the centre of the wakes and

132

behind the towboat.

133

The session started with a standardized 5 min warm up consisting of mobility

134

exercises in the towboat. After that, the alternative technique was introduced to begin the

135

training session on water. Once a successful DWS was achieved, the sit-skier practiced

typical activities, mainly a series of slalom runs splitting his time between open water (out of

137

the slalom course) and the inner slalom, an adapted course with buoys at 6.4 m from the axis

138

of the slalom course [28]. If the sit-skier fell during a run, he had to complete a DWS and

139

restart the practice with a rest period between, allowing coaching feedback. The training

140

program was carried out at a reservoir in the north of Spain.

141

7

Special considerations were applied for the participant since spinal cord lesion at T5

142

situated him at increased risk for hypothermia and autonomic dysreflexia: a) he was asked to

143

empty the bladder or the urine collection bag before each practice; b) the use of a wetsuit was

144

used as preventative measure during practices; c) hydration ad libitum was provided; d) and

145

prolonged rest periods in the towboat with wet clothes were avoided [29]. Weather conditions

146

were variable across training sessions, with air temperatures between 20–32ºC, wind speeds

147

between 12.0–37.0 km·h-1, and reservoir water temperatures between 14–16ºC. Skiing was

148

performed in sheltered parts of the reservoir to reduce wind exposure and use flatter water,

149

away from another boat's wakes, with the sit-skier wearing a waterskiing vest [30]. To help

150

minimize the variables that might influence the outcomes, all of the training sessions were

151

done at similar times throughout the study period (from 11:45 a.m. to 2:15 p.m.), using the

152

same towboat and with the same experienced towboat driver setting the towboat speed with

153

PerfectPass speed control (PerfectPass Control Systems Inc., Dartmouth, NS, Canada), on the

154

same inner-slalom course, and without change in length of the tow rope.

155

Internal training load

156

The exercise demands were quantified on the basis of HR and RPE [15,16]. HR was

157

recorded every 5 s during each training session (Polar Team System 2, Polar Electro Oy,

158

Kempele, Finland). After the training sessions, HR data was downloaded to a computer

159

through a specific software (Polar Pro Trainer 5, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). The

160

HR response was categorized into 3 intensity zones according to the HR values corresponding

161

to the ventilatory (VT) and respiratory compensation (RCT) thresholds [16]: zone 1 (low-

162

intensity exercise), below VT; zone 2 (moderate-intensity exercise), between VT and RCT;

163

and zone 3 (high-intensity exercise), above RCT. These zones were used to calculate the TL

164

by multiplying the time spent in zone 1, 2 and 3 by the constants 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and

165

the TL score being obtained by summating the results of the 3 phases [16]. The participant’s

166

session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) was obtained using the modified Borg (0–10)

167

scale collected ~30 min after each training session [15]. The participant was already familiar

168

with this scale since it was routinely used to control the training intensity during the year

169

before starting the study. Training sessions were divided into 3 intensity levels according to

170

the sRPE: moderate (sRPE < 5), hard (sRPE 5–6), and fairly hard (sRPE > 6) [31]. Training

171

load was calculated by multiplying the sRPE value by the duration of the training session

172

[15].

173

Handgrip strength

174

Handgrip strength was measured with a digital dynamometer (Takei TKK 5401 Grip-

175

D, Tokyo, Japan), immediately before and after the training sessions. A standardized testing

176

position was adopted following the procedure of the American Society of Hand Therapists

177

(ASHT), with the participant in a sitting position in the towboat and the elbow bent at 90º

178

[32]. The participant was able to self-select the handgrip position on the dynamometer with

179

which he could exert the highest force [33]. Peak force was measured in kg during a 5 s

180

period; a force of 3 consecutive maximal repetitions was recorded for the dominant hand.

181

There were 60 s rest intervals between repetitions. The greatest value produced during the

182

three repetitions was used for analysis. The strength decrement index was calculated on each

183

training session: 100% × (Initial Max–Final Max) × Initial Max [34].

184

All measurements were conducted by the same researcher. He had sufficient

185

experience as a coach of athletes with physical disabilities and was familiar with the

186

procedures conducted to evaluate physical conditions in this population. To quantify

187

characteristics and events during training sessions, all activities were observed by this expert

188

who made written recordings about their nature and duration, as well as towboat speeds

189

(Traceable manual digital chronometer VWR, Pennsylvania, USA). Activities were

190

categorized into four broad groups depending on their nature: deep-water start, included

191

proper position of the body while sitting in the water to start from a resting position until the

192

skier planed on top of the water and began a run; open-water practice, recorded from the time

193

the skier started to being pulled behind the towboat, immediately after the DWS, to the

194

moment the skier fell, released the tow rope handle, and sank into the water, or effectively

195

entered the inner-slalom course; inner-slalom course practice, recorded from the time the

196

skier began waterskiing through the course to right before he either fell or went back to open

197

waterskiing; and rest period, considered all situations in which the skier was stationary on the

198

water receiving coaching feedback or recovering and getting back on the sit-ski after falling.

199

Within the deep-water start category, further differentiation was made to identify between

200

alternative (ADWS) and traditional (TDWS). The number of completed DWSs where the

201

skier was successful, as well as the variation range of skier’s speed, were registered.

202

Statistical analyses

203

Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The assumption of normality

204

was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The relationship between HR-based TL method and

205

RPE-based TL method was determined by means of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The

206

magnitude of the correlation (r) was defined as: trivial (< 0.1), small (0.1–0.3), moderate

207

(0.3–0.5), large (0.5–0.7), very large (0.7–0.9) and nearly perfect (> 0.9) [35]. Values of p <

208

.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. A paired student's t‐test was used to compare pre-

209

and post-training handgrip strength values. The statistical analyses were performed using the

210

Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 24.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA).

Internal training load
Physiological demands experienced by the sit skier are shown in Table 2. When HR

235

data were analyzed using percentages of maximal HR (%HRmax), ADWS phases were

236

performed at an average HR of 70.8 ± 6.3% HRmax. During TDWS phases, HR reached an

237

average of 69.6 ± 4.5% HRmax. The average intensity during all sessions was 71.8 ± 4.4%

238

HRmax. The participant spent 76.7 ± 15.3, 21.7 ± 14.2, and 1.7 ± 1.6% of total time in zone 1,

239

2 and 3, respectively. Mean sRPE across training sessions was 4.7 ± 1.6. The mean TL

240

assessed according to the HR and sRPE was 39.6 ± 3.1 arbitrary units (AU) and 151.6 ± 61.1

241

AU, respectively. A non-significant moderate positive correlation of r = .45 (p = .37) was

242

observed between HR-based TL and sRPE-based TL.

243

Handgrip strength

244

The pre- and post-training handgrip strength values of the participant are also shown

245

in Table 2. The mean post-training value (43.7 ± 4.9 kg) was significantly lower (p = .024)

246

than pre-training value (49.8 ± 2.0 kg). Strength decrement index mean values, calculated as

247

the deterioration of strength as a proportion of pretraining values, were 12.2 ± 9.2 %. Strength

248

decrement index values were over 20% for the first and the fourth session.

Discussion

258

This study aimed to provide data about the physiological laboratory evaluation and the TL

259

experienced by a sit-skier with paraplegia while practicing slalom training sessions, with a

260

direct measurement of the cardiovascular, perceptual, and handgrip strength imposed on

261

skiers during DWS and subsequent phases of slalom waterskiing.

262

There is little published data on the physiological evaluation of adaptive waterskiers,

263

or indeed able-bodied waterskiers. Peak oxygen uptake for our participant was similar to that

264

observed for a female waterskier of the sitting class (25 mlꞏkg-1ꞏmin-1) [36]. The lower

265

values compared to those reported for a group of male standing elite waterskiers (54.5 ± 6.2

266

ml·kg-1·min-1) have been very likely caused by reduced active muscle mass during exercise in

a laboratory [37]. Additionally, the pulmonary function values observed for the sit-skier were

268

slightly below those values reported in sixteen highly trained wheelchair basketball players

269

experiencing mostly SCI (13 out of 16) [38]. We believe this occurs because our sit-skier may

270

experience loss of pulmonary function due to the high level of paraplegia, with 81% of

271

predicted FVC at the T5 level [39].

272

Very few studies have investigated the use of HR in athletes with paraplegia as a

273

means of monitoring exercise intensity [3]. According to the data registered, our participant

274

spent most of his training practice in zone 1 or zone 2 in all recorded sessions. This finding

275

suggests the predominance of aerobic metabolism when practicing adaptive waterskiing in a

276

sitting position, in accordance with standing slalom waterskiing being described as dependent

277

on aerobic metabolism [14]. This has also been the case for other sport modalities such as

278

Paralympic alpine sit-ski [40], where it appears that sit-skiing athletes experience a moderate

279

strain even under repeated race-like situations. In this regard, it has been suggested that

280

compared to standing alpine skiers, endurance capacities play a smaller role for sit-skiers [40].

281

It is to be expected, therefore, that the same applies to standing and sitting slalom waterskiing,

282

since moderate-to-high levels of both anaerobic and aerobic power among elite standing

283

waterskiers have been found [11,12].

284

In addition, our research observed for the first time HR values expressed as %HRmax

285

during DWS, ranging from 63.2% to 81.3%. These results are likely to be related to the high

286

static (related to blood pressure) and low dynamic demands (in terms of cardiac output) of

287

waterskiing [41]. The participant’s %HRmax values during DWS are comparable to previous

288

reports of Paralympic alpine skiing sitting athletes (from 67.0% to 83.0%) [40]. A possible

289

explanation for this might be that the duration of the giant slalom competition-like runs were

290

approximately 55 s, showing a nature of short duration similar to that found for the DWS in

291

our participant. Similar HR values have also been observed in sports such as wheelchair

292

tennis or wheelchair basketball during practice or match play [42-45]. These similarities may

293

partly be explained by the fact that both adaptive slalom waterskiing and the aforementioned

294

wheelchair sports present an intermittent nature.

295

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the sRPE in both

296

standing and sitting slalom waterskiing. For TL monitoring in the population with SCI, sRPE

297

is one of the most practical methods [3]. The adaptive slalom waterskiing training sessions in

298

this study ranged from moderate to fairly hard intensity according to sRPE values. It must be

299

noted that the perceptual response to training sessions offered values greater than 5 on four

300

occasions, suggesting that our participant was experiencing slalom sit-skiing as a hard activity

301

in general. The yields in this investigation were slightly higher compared to those of four

302

highly trained international WT players during singles matches, where the mean of the sRPE

303

value was described as somewhat hard [46]. This discrepancy could be attributed to

304

differences in the levels of ability and experience between our sit-skier and these WT players.

305

Previous research has demonstrated that individuals’ RPE may be influenced by skiing skills,

306

where recreational alpine skiers with advanced skiing ability report lower RPE values [47].

307

It is now well established that monitoring of TL can provide both valuable information

308

about an athlete’s adaptation to a training program and support for coaches in the design of

309

appropriate training programs [48]. The current study found that HR and sRPE-based

310

methods of TL showed different scores. The obtained TL values were lower than those

311

observed in highly trained WB players (55.3–67.5 AU) during a small-sided games session

312

[49]. Also, greater values of TL using the same HR-based method that we used in this study

313

have been provided during court-based training in elite wheelchair rugby (WR) athletes (247

314

± 74 AU) [50]. A note of caution is due here since these greater values could be due to the

315

differences between sport modalities (WB and WR present typically high intensity

316

intermittent activities involving a wheelchair) and the different injury characteristics in

317

participants (WB includes heterogeneous disabilities, and WR is performed by athletes with

318

cervical SCI). Regarding the sRPE-based method for quantifying TL, our values are far above

319

those observed in wheelchair basketball for a small-sided games session (99.3 ± 26.9 AU)

320

[49]. On the other hand, higher sRPE-based TL values (934 ± 359 AU) during WR practice

321

were documented [50]. Again, these comparisons must be interpreted with caution because

322

the aforementioned studies were different in terms of participants, activities, and duration of

323

training sessions.

324

The limited availability of athletes with a SCI participating in research studies explain

325

why various training recommendations are given on an individual basis or according to

326

coaches’, athletes’ and scientist’s personal experiences [51]. In this context, little is known

327

with respect to the relationship between objective and subjective TL on athletes with

328

disabilities. In our study, we identified a moderate but not significant correlation between the

329

HR and sRPE-based TL (r = .45; p = .37). These results are likely to be related to the large

330

static component of waterskiing activities. It has been shown that during fatiguing isometric

331

exercise, for paraplegic patients there is only a modest increase in HR since this index appears

332

to be centrally mediated [52]. With regard to RPE, it might be that both the repetition of DWS

333

and the longer duration of training sessions when compared to regular individual ski time of

334

~15 min in slalom courses [14] could lead to a greater accumulation of muscle fatigue. The

335

small alterations in force at the precise moment along with the extremely large forces to react

336

to sudden external disturbances when performing highly skilled and well‐rehearsed moves,

337

typical in slalom waterskiing [14], could also contribute to peripheral fatigue [53]. Therefore,

338

the sRPE score as an indicator of exercise intensity may be affected due to its

339

psychobiological nature that integrates various information including the signals produced by

340

the peripheral working muscles [54]. The findings of the current study are in line with

341

previous research reporting only small or trivial non-significant correlations between HR and

342

sRPE-based TL in relation to WB small-sided games (range r = − .30; ± .27 to .26; ± .28; p >

343

.05) [49]. Moderate but significant relationships between HR-based and RPE-based methods

344

have been also found to quantify match load in WB (r = .63 – .65, p < .001) [55]. In contrast,

345

a very large correlation was found between variables (r = .81) in WR training sessions [50]. It

346

may be the case, therefore, that these variations are caused by the differences in the studies

347

concerning levels of functional ability among participants or the variability in the conditions

348

recorded (small-sided games, conventional training sessions and matches).

349

In the present study, we found a statistically significant reduction in the handgrip

350

strength of the participant once the sessions were finished. This could be due to the fact that

351

intrinsic and extrinsic finger flexors, as well as forearm extensors, are very active while

352

gripping the tow rope handle during most of the practice time [14]. In this regard, in other

353

adaptive sports modalities where this musculature is heavily involved, such as judo, similar

354

reductions on handgrip strength were observed [56]. These results support previous research

355

indicating that waterskiing is a high-demand sport in terms of grip strength [22]. It should be

356

noted that waterskiing technique can have an impact on forearm muscle loading during

357

gripping [22]. Bearing all of the above in mind, to maintain optimum levels of neuromuscular

358

performance during adaptive slalom waterskiing, we recommend that coaches focus on

359

optimizing the position of upper limbs during practice to minimize handgrip force.

360

In spite of its originality, there are two important limitations that should be taken into

361

account when interpreting the obtained results. In the first place, the data comes from one

362

participant. Thus, extrapolation to other adaptive athletes is limited. Secondly, the registered

363

data is somehow incomplete since we did not perform a time-motion analysis addressing the

364

waterskier’s external load (i.e. distance, speed, duration). This fact prevents carrying out a

365

more thorough analysis regarding the TL experienced by the participant.

Conclusions
In conclusion, performing adaptive slalom waterskiing training by a sit-skier with

369

paraplegia involved in the present study a moderate physiological internal load, which was

370

perceived as a hard effort. Moreover, the significant decrement in handgrip strength offers

371

valuable data about the extent of the grip-strength contribution required in a sitting position.

372

These findings provide novel information regarding the TL that can be experienced while

373

practicing this sport modality.
