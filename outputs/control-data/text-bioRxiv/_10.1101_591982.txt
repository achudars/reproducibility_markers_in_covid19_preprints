Abstract

27

Milk microbiomes impose a significant influence on the pathophysiology of bovine mastitis. To

28

assess the association, we compared the microbiome of clinical mastitis (CM) and healthy (H)

29

milk samples through whole metagenomic deep sequencing. A total of 483.38 million reads

30

generated from both metagenomes were analyzed through PathoScope and MG-RAST, and

31

mapped to 380 bacterial, 56 archaeal, and 39 viral genomes. We observed distinct shifts and

32

differences in abundance between the microbiome of CM and H milk in phyla Proteobacteria,

33

Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with an inclusion of 68.04% unreported and/or

34

opportunistic species in CM milk. Additionally, 14 archaeal and 14 viral genera were found to be

35

solely associated with CM. The functional metagenomics identified several pathways related to

36

bacterial proliferation and colonization such as metabolism, chemotaxis and invasion, immune-

37

diseases, oxidative stress, regulation and cell signaling, phage and prophases, antibiotic and

38

heavy metal resistance to be associated with CM. Therefore, the present study provides

39

conclusive data on milk microbiome diversity associated with bovine CM and its role in udder

40

health.

Introduction

51

Mastitis is one of the most prevalent diseases in the dairy industry with the highest clinical and

52

economic significance worldwide1. The condition usually happens when pathogenic microbes

53

enter the germ-free environment of the mammary gland, mostly by the disruption of the physical

54

barriers of the mammary quarters, requiring prompt and appropriate host defenses to prevent

55

colonization and subsequent disease pathology2. Diverse groups of microbes are known to

56

colonize the mammary quarters of cows, and have evolved novel mechanisms that facilitate their

57

proliferation, leading to clinical mastitis (CM). Despite knowledge of a few of these invading

58

microbial groups, the etiology of bovine mastitis is continuously changing, with new microbial

59

species identified as causing disease frequently. Additionally, although bacteria are the main

60

cause of mastitis3, other microbes like archaea, viruses and fungi might be associated with the

61

disease process4 and should therefore be investigated as well. During the progression of the

62

mastitis, dysbiosis of the milk microbiome can occur with the increase of opportunistic

63

pathogenic bacteria and reduction of healthy commensal bacteria5. Until recently, investigations

64

of microbiome associated with bovine mastitis have been mostly restricted to individual

65

pathogen isolation and characterization.

66

The disease is caused by epidemiologically diverse groups of microorganisms and categorized

67

into contagious and environmental mastitis6. The udder of the dairy cows is the primary reservoir

68

of contagious pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae,

69

Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Mycoplasma spp. and Corynebacterium bovis1,6. The involvement of

70

the bovine mammary gland microbiota in the host-pathogen interaction has little investigated

71

except during the infectious episode7. Environmental pathogens such as Escherichia coli,

72

Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae

73

and Streptococcus uberis1,6 can also be implicated in disease. Rapid advances in high-throughput

74

NGS technology and bioinformatics tools8 during the last decade have initiated a transition from

75

clinical microbiology to genomic characterization of the microbiome associated with infection,

76

including mastitis in lactating women5and animals9. Shotgun whole metagenome sequencing

77

(WMS) produces a metagenome reflecting the total microbial makeup of a sample (pathogenic,

78

environmental, bacterial, fungal, viral) and has been used successfully to gain insights into the

79

phylogenetic composition and species diversity of a variety of microbiomes10, including profiling

80

of their functional attributes11. Thus, data can be generated regarding the identity and abundance

81

of genes related to microbial metabolism, virulence and antibiotic resistance enabling

82

identification of unknown etiological agents that play a role in mammary gland pathogenesis.

83

Overexpression of putative genes encoding immune suppression12, systemic oxidative stress3,

84

and inflammatory processes13 are the crucial factors affecting the progression of CM.

85

Indiscriminate and overuse of antibiotics to treat mastitis is main cause of multidrug resistant

86

bacteria14. Therefore, summarizing the variation in biota and protein functional diversity in

87

clinical and healthy milk microbiomes using cutting-edge genomic technologies like WMS15 and

88

associated bioinformatic tools is essential to understanding the pathophysiological conditions of

89

bovine CM. Here we report the first study of its kind where high-throughput sequencing data (on

90

an average 23.01 million reads per sample) were generated to investigate the microbiome of

91

bovine CM and H milk16. The results revealed that cows suffering from CM milk had a distinct

92

microbial community with reduced diversity, higher relative abundance of opportunistic

93

pathogens, and altered protein functions compared to their healthy counterparts.

Results

97

Structure and composition of the bovine milk microbiome. Compared to healthy (H)

98

microbiomes, clinical mastitis (CM) milk microbiomes showed significantly reduced Shannon-

99

estimated microbial richness (H; p=0.005, CM; p=0.007, U test). Species richness in both

100

metagenomes also differed significantly between two bioinformatics tools (PS; p=0.039, MR;

101

p=0.001, U test) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Beta diversity (PCoA) revealed significant microbial

102

disparity (p=0.001) between CM and H sample groups (Supplementary Fig. 2). At phylum level,

103

NMDS showed distinct diversity differences between the sample categories (Supplementary Fig.

104

3).

105

At the domain level, bacteria were the most abundant community, with an average abundance of

106

98.00%, followed by eukaryotes (1.80%), archaea (0.02%), viruses (0.04%), and unassigned

107

sequences (0.002%) (Supplementary Data 1). Though the relative abundance of microbes was

108

higher in CM compared to H milk, the abundance fluctuated more (CV=886.90 vs 511.80; PS,

109

CV= 1521.41 vs 1221.92; MR). The unique and shared distribution of microbial taxa found in

110

CM and H samples by two analytic tools is represented in Venn diagrams (Fig.1). A total of 363

111

bacterial species in CM, and 146 species in H metagenomes were detected in PS analysis, of

112

which 116 (29.51%) species shared in the both conditions (Fig. 1a). However, through MR

113

pipeline, 356 and 251 bacterial genera were detected in CM and H samples respectively, whereas

114

227 (63.8%) genera were common in both metagenomes (Fig. 1b). By comparing the detected

115

bacterial genera between two analytic tools, 98 unique genera were identified, of them 62.24%

116

genera were solely associated with the onset of bovine CM (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Data 2). In

117

addition, MR detected 54 and 42 archaeal, and 35 and 25 viral genera, respectively in CM and H

118

samples, and among them 25.00% and 35.00% archaeal and viral genera respectively had sole

119

association with CM (Fig. 1d, e). Unlike MR, PS detected only one archaeal genera

120

(Methanobrevibacter) in CM and none in H samples.

121
122

CM-associated bacteria changes at the genus level. The current microbiome study

123

demonstrated notable differences among the microbial community in CM and H milk in both

124

bioinformatics tools. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (contributing

125

to 96.51% of the total sequences, U test, p=0.001) were the four most abundant phyla in PS and

126

MR analyses. The relative abundance of the top 40 bacterial genera was compared between CM

127

and H cohort through PS (Fig. 2) analyses. Among the predominating phyla, Proteobacteria was

128

among the most diverse, and included a wide variety of genera including Acinetobacter,

129

Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Vibrio, Erwinia, Pantoea. The phylum Firmicutes was dominated by

130

Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus genera while Chryseobacterium,

131

Porphyromonas and Prevotella genera were predominating in Bacteroidetes phylum, and

132

Corynebacterium was the most abundant genus in phylum Actinobacteria. Among the detected

133

genera either of the tool, Acinetobacter (60.14%), Campylobacter (10.93%), Pantoea (0.66%),

134

Klebsiella (0.63%), Kluyvera (0.42%), Salmonella (0.31%), Enterobacter (0.30%), Shewanella

135

(0.30%), Escherichia (0.28%), Citrobacter (0.15%) and Bacillus (0.10%) had higher mean

136

relative abundance in CM samples in both analytic tools, while rest of the genera had relatively

137

lower mean abundance (<0.10%). In contrast, the H milk metagenomes also had higher mean

138

relative abundance of genus Acinetobacter (52.90%) in PS and MR followed by Pseudomonas

139

(22.81%), Micromonospora (10.57%), Eubacterium (5.37%), Catenibacterium (2.12%) and

140

Ralstonia (0.12%)genera, and rest of the genera had much lower abundance (<0.10%). In

141

general, MR detected higher number of microbial genera than PS (Supplementary Tables 2&3),

142

however results from the both tools were concordant, with 98.00% of the total microbial

143

abundance composed of shared genera (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Data 2).

144

CM-associated bacteria changes at the strain level. We further investigated whether strain

145

level relative abundances of the bacteria differed between CM and H samples (Fig. 3, 4). The

146

CM milk metagenome had significantly (p=0.001) higher number of bacterial species than the

147

H milk, and among the detected species 62.85% had unique association with bovine CM, and

148

7.63% were solely found in H milk (Fig. 1a). The presence of few predominating bacterial

149

species in both categories of samples suggests that the crucial differences might be occurring at

150

the strain level, and most of the species identified in each sample were represented by a single

151

strain. The CM milk metagenome was dominated by 26 strains (7.16%) of Acinetobacter

152

species while Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus,

153

Bacillus, and Escherichia species were represented respectively by 22, 16, 12, 11, 8, 7 and 6

154

different strains. However, in both metagenomes, Acinetobacter johnsonii XBB1 remained as the

155

most abundant strain with a relative abundance of 39.03% and 31.23% respectively in CM and H

156

samples. The other predominant strains in CM metagenome were Campylobacter mucosalis,

167

most of these strains were previously unreported and possibly played an opportunistic role in the

168

mammary gland pathogenesis (Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Table 5).

169
170

CM-associated changes of archaea and viruses at the genus level. Archaea and viruses were

171

detected in the samples of the both metagenomic groups; CM and H milk. The CM metagenome

172

was dominated by Methanosarcina (41.94%), Methanococcoides (19.58%), Methanococcus

173

(12.30%), Methanocaldococcus (2.59%), Methanobrevibacter (1.85%), Thermococcus (1.79%),

174

and Methanosphaera (1.53%) archaeal genera with a lower relative abundance (<0.05%) of the

175

rest of the genera (Fig. 5 a, Supplementary Data 2). Interestingly, none of the archaeal genus was

176

detected in one CM sample (Ctg3C2). In contrast, Methanoplanus (14.69%), Methanoculleus

177

(12.85%), Euryarchaeota (4.67%), and Haloarcula (1.50%) were the most abundant archaeal

178

genera in H samples. The viral fraction of the current bovine milk microbiome was largely

179

dominated by the members of the Caudovirales order, represented by the Podoviridae,

180

Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae families. The predominating viral genera found in CM were

181

Epsilon15-like viruses (15.78%), P2-like viruses (10.12%), Myovirus (8.18%), Lambda-like

182

viruses (8.06%), Bpp-1-like viruses (7.12%), phiKZ-like viruses (4.35%), Betaretrovirus

183

(2.01%), P1-like viruses (1.79%) and T4-like viruses (1.79%). The H milk however had

184

relatively higher abundance of Siphovirus (55.85%), Podovirus (12.49%), T1-like viruses

185

(3.44%) and P22-like viruses (1.71%) (Fig. 5 b, Supplementary Data 2).

187

Microbial metabolic functions associated with CM. MR simultaneously analyzed and

188

compared the taxonomic compositions and functional profile in our metagenomic sequences in

189

several ways. On average, the putative genes with known predicted protein and known functions

190

were 3.94% and 5.51%, respectively suggesting that a large proportion of the genes encoding for

191

different functional properties are yet unknown (Supplementary Data 1). By comparing the

192

number of genes assigned to each KEGG pathway between the groups, we found a series of

193

significant differences (p=0.001) that lead to the functional divergence among CM and H milk

194

microbiotas. The PCoA analysis at level 3 subsystems showed that CM metagenome separately

195

distributed from H milk metagenome indicating significant functional differences (p=0.035)

196

(Supplementary Fig. 4). In the comparative analysis, we found that genes associated with

197

metabolism (central carbohydrate, amino acids, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and

198

pigment), substrate dependence, clustering-based subsystems, cell motility (bacterial

199

chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, invasion of epithelial cells), phases, prophages, transposable

200

elements and plasmids, regulation and cell signaling, stress response, virulence, disease and

201

defense, immune and infectious diseases, cancer pathways were significantly (p< 0.05) over

202

represented and positively correlated with bovine CM (Fig. 6, 7, Supplementary Data 3).

203

Genes associated with citrate synthase (CS, gltA), fumarate hydratase class I (fumA, fumB),

204

oxidative phosphorylation, bacterial translation, ribosome biogenesis and tRNA amino-

205

acylation were significantly enriched in the metabolic pathways of CM associated

206

microbiomes. The CM associated microbiotas had significantly (p<0.001) higher relative

207

abundance (50.51%) of genes coding for benzoate degradation than the H milk biomes

208

(36.41%). The CM milk microbes had upregulation of genes for energy metabolism including

209

one carbon metabolism, sulfur and methane metabolism than H milk microorganisms. The

210

relative abundance of genes encoding ABC transporter (38.97%) and bacterial chemotaxis

211

(68.61%) remained significantly higher in CM microbes than those detected in H milk biomes

212

(p<0.005). Among the pathways in infectious diseases, genes coding for epithelial cell signaling,

213

epithelial cells invasion, Legionellosis, Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle, Staphylococcus

214

aureus, Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection were mostly abundant in CM

215

metagenome. Likewise, there was a predominant abundance of genes responsible for glutathione

216

S-transferase (GST), breakpoint cluster region protein (BCR1), fumarate hydratase class II

217

(fumC), and pyruvate kinase (pk) in different pathways causing mammary gland cancer. We

218

observed significantly higher abundance of genes encoding apoptosis in CM microbiomes, and

219

in contrast, the relative abundance of proteins that are involved in various cellular functions (cell

220

growth and differentiation) through the p53 signaling pathway remained higher in H milk

221

(p<0.05). The CM milk microbiomes had significantly (p< 0.001) higher number of reads

222

(64.29%) coding for severely combined immune deficient gene adenosine deaminase (ADA)

223

than H milk microbes (28.58%) (Supplementary Fig. 5). Furthermore, sporulation related

224

hypotheticals and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas1, Cas2, and Cas3) remained higher in CM

225

metagenomes than H milk microbes (Supplementary Data 3).

226

We found that the CM microbiotas had significantly higher abundance of genes encoding for

227

oxidative stress (36.46%), pathogenicity islands (10.13%), phage related transposable elements

228

(19.48%), phage packaging machinery (6.37%), phage replication (6.70%) and phage

229

regulatory gene expression (7.10%) than those of H milk biomes (p< 0.003). However, the

230

phage lysogenic conversion related genes remained higher in abundance among the healthy

231

milk microbes. A deeper look at microbial genes associated with regulation and cell signaling

232

revealed that CM microbes had significantly higher expression of this gene compared to

233

healthy milk microbiotas (p=0.001). Within this subsystem, genes coding for two-component

234

regulatory system BarA-UvrY (SirA; CM= 85.78% vs H= 67.41%), pericellular trafficking and

235

cell invasion- the membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP; CM= 86.59% vs

236

H= 73.80%), programmed cell death (CM= 55.00% vs H= 28.57%), and intra-membrane

237

regulatory proteolytic pathway- endoplasmic reticulum chaperon grp78 (BiP; CM= 92.85% vs

238

H= 71.42%) were predominantly found to be associated with the onset of bovine CM. We also

239

identified novel associations of biofilm formation (BF) properties among the microbes

240

identified in both metagenomes. The relative abundance of genes coding for protein YjgK cluster

241

linked to biofilm formation, biofilm PGA synthesis, deacetylase PgaB, N-glycosyltransferase

242

PgaC, and auxiliary protein PgaD had statistically over expression among mastitis causing

243

pathogens (p=0.035). In contrast, the genes coding for quorum sensing (QS) in particular to QS

244

in Yersinia, Pseudomonas and Vibrio remained over expressed in H milk metagenomes.

245

Moreover, of the assigned reads to different levels SEED subsystems (6.45 million), 2.63%

246

mapped against 30 and 28 different resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC) genes

247

respectively in CM and H milk metagenomes (Fig. 8, Supplementary Data 3). Among them,

248

genes encoding multidrug resistance to efflux pumps, cluster (mdtABCD), operon (CmeABC)

249

and MAR locus, methicillin resistance in Staphylococci, vancomycin resistance, arsenic and

250

chromium compounds resistance had two-fold higher relative abundances in CM microbiotas

251

than H milk biomes. There was 5 to 7-fold over expression of multidrug resistance to MAR locus

252

and mercury resistance genes in CM microbes than H milk organisms. In addition, CM causing

253

microorganisms harbored two additional resistance genes; multidrug resistance to operon

254

(mdtRP) and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase (Supplementary Data 3).

Discussion

258

During the last decade metagenomics has helped to shed some light onto the ‘‘known unknown’’

259

component of the milk microbiome and to enable insights into its taxonomic composition,

260

dynamics, and importance to cows udder health homeostasis. Metagenomic deep sequencing

261

(WMS) of bovine milk has uncovered previously overlooked microbial populations of high

262

complexity with potential roles in regulation of overall microbiome composition and their

263

functional attributes, and in the onset, progression, and treatment strategies of bovine CM. Yet

264

today, 16SrRNA gene sequencing remained as the key approach for studying milk microbiomes,

265

and findings are mostly limited to bacterial identification at the genus level5,9,17, though this

266

method has serious inherent limitations18. However, little is known about the association of other

267

microbes (archaea and viruses), microbiome shift, and particular functional changes during the

268

progression of the disease. The noteworthy findings of the present WMS study are the taxonomic

269

profiling of bacteria at both the species and/or strain-level, the possible association of the

270

archaeal and viral fractions with bacterial mastitis, and the crosstalk between the identified

271

microbiomes and their functional genomics in the association of bovine CM.

272

The findings generated by PS and MR are much higher in taxonomic resolution and predicted

273

proteins functions, and are consistent with previous 16SrRNA gene based studies1,9,17. The core

274

bacteria associated with bovine CM such Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Escherichia,

275

Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Pantoea, Shewanella, Ralstonia etc.

276

remained consistent in both analytic tools although their relative abundances varied even within

277

same sample group. The study demonstrated that in spite of having relatively higher taxonomic

278

abundance, the CM associated microbiomes fluctuate more within the samples than those

279

identified in H milk metagenome corroborating several recent findings5,17,18,19. To date, around

280

50 bacterial genera have been reported in bovine milk through 16SrRNA-based

281

metagenomics1,9,17,20, while our current WMS study detected 356 and 251 bacterial genera in CM

282

and H milk, respectively indicating the increased discriminatory power of this cutting-edge

283

technology in identifying microbiomes10,15. The observed increase in phylum-level signature of

284

Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in CM milk independent of quarter,

285

parity, and breeds of the cows is almost consistent with many of the previous studies5,9,17,26.

286

Furthermore, the CM milk metagenome had an inclusion of 68.04% previously unreported

287

bacterial species, most of which are opportunistic in nature. Before now, no substantial

288

information is available regarding the association of different strains of Acinetobacter with

289

bovine mastitis, which are opportunistic pathogen to causing CM by acquiring exogenous DNA

290

from other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer, and concomitantly becomes a reservoir of

291

resistant genes23. In a recent study, highest association of Acinetobacter causing bubaline CM7

292

has been reported supporting our present findings. The H milk metagenome had higher relative

293

abundance of soil or environment (Micromonospora) and animal skin (Pseudomonas) associated

294

bacteria, which can act as potential opportunist by attacking weak or injured tissues of teats or

295

mammary glands25,26, and can cause acute and/or chronic mastitis27. Furthermore, the

296

predominantly identified CM associated bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic

297

environmental pathogen, and transmission of this bacterium might occur from contaminated

298

feces and bedding materials28 to help in causing CM in healthy mammary glands and/or quarters.

Gut microbiome plays a key role in maintenance of nutrition, host defense and immune

300

development29, and we revealed a close association between gut microbiota and milk microbes in

301

the pathogenesis of bovine CM30. Additional support for this finding includes, the potential

302

existence of an endogenous entero-mammary pathway, through which gut bacteria migrate to the

303

mammary gland, and this could explain the predominating presence of gut bacteria such as phyla

304

Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes, with

305

Acinetobacter, Campylobacter, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Kocuria

306

genera in CM milk30-32. These pathogens use very efficient strategies to evade host defenses in

307

order to colonize and invade mammary tissues through adhesion33, thereby damage host cells and

308

fight with cows immune systems to producing clinical and/or chronic mastitis33-35. Despite

309

relatively lower abundance, the rest of the bacterial genera, species/strains detected across the

310

clinical milk metagenome had symbiotic network, and positive correlation with CM. Our study

311

marks an additional step towards identifying the significant co-occurrence of archaea and viruses

312

with bacterial population in bovine milk. Unlike bacteria, the relative abundance and diversity of

313

archaea36 and viruses37 remained substantially lower. Currently there is no extensive evidence

314

supporting the role of archaea and viruses in the pathogenesis of bovine mastitis, however these

315

microbes mostly cease the opportunity during the pathophysiological changes in the mammary

316

glands created by bacteria38. The full spectrum of outcomes from these archaea-cows

317

interactions, whether it altered host mammary gland physiology remained as a mystery. Thus, it

318

is hypothesized that archaea might follow the exact mechanisms of bacterial pathogens

319

producing bovine CM36. Most of the detected viral genera belonged to the order Caudovirales

320

which consists of the three families of tailed bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) infecting bacteria

321

and archaea. The host range of Caudovirales is very broad and includes all major bacterial phyla

322

found in both metagenomes: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. This

323

corresponded with an increase relative abundance of these bacterial taxa in CM milk samples

324

together with an over presentation of Caudovirales taxa compared with H milk metagenome39. In

325

addition, we revealed the association of Herpesvirales (Macavirus and Rhadinovirus genera)

326

with bovine CM39,40. Our current findings demonstrated that viruses neither cause bovine

327

mastitis directly nor play role in the initiation of the disease process, but later, when bacterial

328

infection of the udder occurs, they replicate in the immune and epithelial cells of the udder

329

and/or milk ducts, and may act as predisposing factor as well as primary etiological agent for

330

more severe and prolonged mastitis41.

331

The KEGG pathways and SEED subsystems of MR pipeline uncovered significant differences

332

in microbial metabolic functions in both metagenomes5,42 as supported by several previous

333

reports on mastitis in lactating cows9 and women5. The CM microbiota had significantly higher

334

abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which are well-known bacteria to utilizing

335

milk oligosaccharides; one carbon metabolism43. Genes associated TCA cycle (gltA, fumA)

336

and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) remained over expressed in CM

337

microbiomes, which might be associated with host-pathogen interactions during the

338

progression of bovine mastitis44,45. Increased benzoate degradation by different strains of

339

Acinetobacter and Klebsiella in CM metagenome through TCA cycle is thought to promote

340

bacterial growth and virulence factors expression during pathogenesis46,47. To elucidate the

341

role of bacterial chemotaxis in bovine mastitis, we found that genes coding for bacterial

342

chemotaxis is predominantly abundant in CM milk microbiomes suggesting their role in early

343

phase of mastitis for attachment to or entry into the udder tissues and virulence regulation48.

344

The p38 signaling pathway exerts its biological effects in the pathophysiology of bovine CM

345

through several complex biologic processes including expression of many cytokines,

346

transcription factors, cell surface receptors, enzymes and oxidative stress mediators49. The p38

347

mediated transcriptional regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)50 and pro-

348

inflammatory mediator cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)49 can potentially contribute to mammary

349

gland cancer and/or glandular mastitis. The up-regulation of genes coding for programmed-cell

350

death during host–pathogen interactions in CM is associated with increased secretion of

351

bacterial toxins, or pro-inflammatory mediators51. Diverse groups of microbiomes (bacteria

352

and viruses) causing bovine CM might induce cell death with their apoptotic features51. The

353

predominantly identified membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) across the

354

CM metagenome is a pro-invasive protease regulating various cellular functions, macrophage

355

migration to the inflamed mammary tissues, and causes adenocarcinoma in cows udder52. We

356

demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum chaperon (GRP78/BiP) associated gene signatures

357

are highly expressed in CM microbiotas, which can promote tumor proliferation and metastasis

358

in mammary tissues53. Biofilm formation can be a strain specific or genetically linked trait,

359

representing a selective advantage in pathogenesis of mastitis. The relatively over expression

360

of genes encoding protein YjgK cluster linked to biofilm formation, and biofilm PGA synthesis

361

in CM microbiomes is in accordance with several earlier reports54. Moreover, biofilm

362

formation can also be harmful to host tissues since they can promote the phagocyte release of

363

lysosomal enzymes, proliferation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and transfer of

364

antibiotic resistance55. The observed increase abundance of genes for primary immune

365

diseases; adenosine deaminase (ADA) in CM pathogens is responsible for inhibition of T cell

366

maturation

367

communication58, and therefore could be used as a selective marker for bovine CM diagnosis.

bovine milk, and play critical roles during the pathogenesis of mastitis by evading the hosts

370

defense system particularly under stress condition59. The type III and IV secretion systems

371

found on the pathogenicity islands of CM associated microbes are capable of producing

372

immunosuppression in cows by delivering effector proteins960. Phages, which are the regulators

373

of bacterial population, play important and diverse roles in all bacterial ecosystems61, but their

374

precise impact on the milk microbiota is far from being understood. The relatively over

375

presentation of genes coding for phage related transposable elements, phage packaging

376

machinery, phage replication and phage regulatory gene expression in CM microbes may

377

suggests that bacteriophages participate in the horizontal gene transfer among the members of

378

bovine milk microbiomes, and ultimately to mammary gland pathogens39. We propose that as

379

obligate parasites bacteriophages naturally found in raw milk, replicate in bacterial host, follow

380

the lysogenic cycle, disrupt host metabolism and, ultimately, causing death of bacterial cell

381

during the immunosuppression states of the cows, and finally release new phage particles39,40.

382

Bovine milk microbiomes are a wide source of resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds

383

(RATC) genes and the pathogenic bacteria within this potential reservoir are becoming more

384

resistant. The current metagenomic deep sequencing provides a wealth of information not only

385

on RATC genes, but on the entire gene content thereby enabling the identification of the

386

community composition and metabolic profile. We found that all of the samples in both

387

metagenomes harbored RATC genes (2.63%) indicating their wide and indiscriminate use in

388

Bangladeshi dairy farms. However, most of the resistant genes in RATC functional groups

389

remained predominantly higher in CM milk microbes. Although the knowledge on uncontrolled

390

spread of antibiotics resistant genes in bovine mastitis pathogens62 are increasing, but

391

information on heavy metal resistance is yet unavailable. This worrisome trend in increasing

392

RATC against mastitis pathogens has become a major concern for the dairy holders of

393

Bangladesh, given the seriousness of such problems; effective therapies using alternative

394

medicines are needed for successful prevention and control of bovine mastitis.

395

The novel WMS technology in combination with improved bioinformatic analysis of milk

396

microbiome identifies the comparative microbial communities associated with bovine CM and

397

H quarters. The significant differences in the microbiome compositions and protein functional

398

diversities in two groups implicated the association in the progression of the

399

pathophysiological conditions of the disease.

Methods

402

Study population and sampling. Details of study population and collected samples are

403

presented in Supplementary Table 1. A total of 21 milk samples (14, CM and 7, H) from 21

404

lactating crossbred cows at their early stage of lactation (within 10-40 days of calving) were

405

collected from three districts of Bangladesh (Chattagram= 12, Dhaka= 3, Gazipur=6). The

406

sampling patterns followed collection of two CM and one H milk samples from the same farm.

407

Approximately 15-20 ml of milk from each cow was collected in a sterile falcon tube during the

408

morning milking (8.0-10.0 am) with emphasis on pre-sampling disinfection of teat-ends and

409

hygiene during sampling1,63. The milk samples were then transported to the laboratory, and

410

stored at -20°C until DNA extraction.

411

DNA extraction and sequencing. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted by an automated DNA

412

extraction platform (Promega, UK) following previously described protocols5,16. DNA quantity

413

and purity was determined with NanoDrop (ThermoFisher, USA) by measuring 260/280

414

absorbance ratios. Sequencing libraries were prepared with Nextera XT DNA Library

415

Preparation Kit64 according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and paired-end (2×150 bp)

416

sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 500 machine (Illumina Inc., USA) at the Genomics

417

Core facility at The George Washington University. Our metagenomic DNA yielded 483.38

418

million reads with an average of 23.01 million (maximum=35.10 million, minimum=6.77

419

million) reads per sample (Supplementary Data 1).

420

Sequence reads preprocessing. The resulting FASTQ files were concatenated and filtered

421

through BBDuk13 (with options k=21, mink=6, ktrim=r, ftm=5, qtrim=rl, trimq=20, minlen=30,

422

overwrite=true) to remove Illumina adapters, known Illumina artifacts and phiX. Any sequence

423

below these thresholds or reads containing more than one ‘N’ were discarded. On an average,

424

20.16 million reads per sample (maximum=32.33 million, minimum=4.71 million) passed

425

quality control step (Supplementary Data 1).

426

Microbiome community analysis. We analyzed the WMS data using mapping-based and

427

assembly-based hybrid methods PathoScope 2.0 (PS)65 and MG-RAST 4.0 (MR)8. In PS

428

analysis, a ‘target’ genome library was constructed containing all bacterial and archaeal

429

sequences

430

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information)

431

PathoLib module. The reads were then aligned against the target libraries using the very sensitive

432

Bowtie2 algorithm15-16 and filtered to remove the reads aligned with the cattle genome (bosTau8)

433

and human genome (hg38) as implemented in PathoMap (−very-sensitive-local -k 100 --score-

434

min L,20,1.0). Finally, the PathoID66 module was applied to obtain accurate read counts for

435

downstream analysis. In these samples, an average of 12.90 million aligned reads per sample

436

mapped to the target reference genome libraries (96.24 %) after filtering the cow and human

437

genome (Supplementary Data 1). The raw sequences were simultaneously uploaded in MR

from

the

438

server (release 4.0) with proper embedded metadata and were subjected to the quality filter

439

containing dereplication and removal of host DNA by screening67 for taxonomical and functional

440

assignment.

441

Diversity analysis. Alpha diversity (diversity within samples) was estimated using the Shannon

442

index for both PS and MR reads output. To test beta diversity (differences in the organismal

443

structure) of the milk microbiome, a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed based

444

on weighted-UniFrac distances (for PS data) through Phyloseq R68, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity

445

matrix (for MR data)69. In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) on PS data

446

was also used for beta diversity analysis between the sample groups70. Taxonomic abundance

447

was determined by applying the ‘‘Best Hit Classification’’ option using the NCBI database as a

448

reference with the following settings: maximum e-value of 1x10-30; minimum identity of 95% for

449

bacteria, 60% for archaea and viruses, and a minimum alignment length of 20 as the set

450

parameters. The phylogenetic origin of the metagenomic sequences was projected against the

451

NCBI taxonomic tree and determined by the lowest common ancestor (LCA) with the same

452

cutoff mentioned above. Two phylogenetic trees consisting of 363 and 146 bacterial strains

453

respectively in CM and H metagenomes with >80% taxonomic identity were constructed using

454

the neighbor-joining method in Clustal W (version 2.1)71, and FigTree (version 1.5.1)13.

455

Statistical analysis. The characteristics of cows with and without CM were compared using

456

Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for quantitative

457

variables21. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check normality of the data, and the non-

458

parametric test Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to evaluate differences in the relative

459

percent abundance of taxa in CM and H groups. For the functional abundance profiling, the

460

statistical tests were applied at different KEGG and SEED subsystems levels in MR pipeline.

461

Differences between the pipelines were evaluated using ANOVA and the Friedman rank sum

462

test. A significance level of alpha=0.05 was used for all tests8.

Fig. 2 Taxonomic profile of 40 most abundant bacterial genera in bovine clinical mastitis (CM)
and healthy (H) milk samples. a Top Left: abundance through PathoScope (PS) and b Bottom
Left: through MG-RAST (MR) analyses. The 39 most abundant genera are sorted by descending
order of the relative abundance in 21samples, with the remaining genera grouped into the ‘Other
genera’. Each stacked bar plot represents the abundance of bacteria in each sample of the
corresponding category, where the last two bar plots depict overall relative abundance of
bacterial genera between CM and H samples, respectively. c Middle Right: The circular plot
illustrates the relative abundance of top 40 bacterial genera in CM and H milk samples analysed
through PS and MR. Taxa in both metagenomes are represented by different colored ribbons
both tools. The relative abundancies are illustrated by the sizes of each color segment in the outer
circle and the inner blue colored bars. Part of the microbiome is shared by both sample
categories (CM-H milk), and part is analytic tool specific (PS-MR). Notable differences between
the bacterial populations are those where the taxon is abundant in CM samples and effectively
undetected in the H milk. Sample names: suffix ends with C refers to clinical (CM) and that ends
with H refers to healthy (H) milk samples.
