Neural computation relies on the integration of synaptic inputs across a neuron’s dendritic arbour.
However, the fundamental rules that govern dendritic integration are far from understood. In
particular, it is still unclear how cell type-specific differences in dendritic integration arise from general
features of neural morphology and membrane properties. Here, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which
relay the visual system’s first computations to the brain, represent an exquisite model. They are
functionally and morphologically diverse yet defined, and they allow studying dendritic integration in
a functionally relevant context. Here, we show how four morphologically distinct types of mouse RGC
with shared excitatory synaptic input (transient Off alpha, transient Off mini, sustained Off, and FminiOff) exhibit distinct dendritic integration rules. Using two-photon imaging of dendritic calcium
signals and biophysical modelling, we demonstrate that these RGC types strongly differ in their spatiotemporal dendritic integration: In transient Off alpha cells, dendritic receptive fields displayed little
spatial overlap, indicative of a dendritic arbour that is partitioned in largely isolated regions. In contrast,
dendritic receptive fields in the other three RGCs overlapped greatly and were offset to the soma,
suggesting strong synchronization of dendritic signals likely due to backpropagation of somatic signals.
Also temporal correlation of dendritic signals varied extensively among these types, with transient Off
mini cells displaying the highest correlation across their dendritic arbour. Modelling suggests that
morphology alone cannot explain these differences in dendritic integration, but instead specific
combinations of dendritic morphology and ion channel densities are required. Together, our results
reveal how neurons exhibit distinct dendritic integration profiles tuned towards their type-specific
computations in their circuits, with the interplay between morphology and ion channel complement
as a key contributor.

Across the nervous system, the output signal of a neuron is determined by how it integrates the often
thousands of synaptic inputs it receives across its dendritic arbour (Guo et al., 2014; Koch et al., 1982).
However, still little is known about how dendritic integration is shaped by differences between neuron
types, such as specific dendritic morphology and ion channel complement and density. To investigate
type-specific dendritic integration and the key factors driving it, we here use the vertebrate retina, a
model system with a clear input-output relationship that can be recorded in a dish (Ames and Nesbett,
1981). The retina decomposes the visual signal into ~40 feature-specific parallel channels (reviewed in
(Baden et al., 2018)), relayed to the brain by a matching number of retinal ganglion cell types (Baden
et al., 2016; Sanes and Masland, 2015). Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) receive their main excitatory drive
from the bipolar cells (BCs), which pick up the photoreceptor signal in the outer retina. In addition,
RGCs (and BCs) receive inhibitory input from amacrine cells (ACs) (reviewed in (Diamond, 2017)),
completing the canonical RGC input circuit. Different RGC types differ in morphology (Bae et al., 2018;
Helmstaedter et al., 2013; Sümbül et al., 2014), synaptic connectivity (Field et al., 2010; Helmstaedter
et al., 2013), and expression of ion channels (Rheaume et al., 2018; Siegert et al., 2012).

To explain the emergence of diverse RGC functions, many previous studies have focused on the
selective connectivity with presynaptic neurons in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (e.g. (Helmstaedter
et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2018)). Different RGC types arborize in specific layers of the IPL
and, hence, receive synaptic inputs from distinct combinations of BC and AC types (Helmstaedter et
al., 2013). This spatiotemporally heterogeneous input provides the basis of type-specific feature
extraction (Roska and Werblin, 2001). In addition, RGC dendrites may themselves perform complex
computations and therefore contribute to the generation of specific output channels, e.g. through
their dendritic geometry, and the complement, distribution and density of passive and active ion
channels (Branco and Hausser, 2010; Goldstein and Rall, 1974; Koch et al., 1982; Lai and Jan, 2006;
Stuart and Spruston, 2015). So far, dendritic processing in the retina has been studied mainly in
interneurons (e.g. (Chapot et al., 2017; Grimes et al., 2010; Hausselt et al., 2007; Koren et al., 2017)).
Despite some theoretical work in this direction (reviewed in (Guo et al., 2014)), experimental evidence
for type-specific dendritic computation and their biophysical mechanisms in RGCs remains limited and
is restricted to a few specific types (i.e. direction-selective RGCs, (Dorostkar et al., 2010; Oesch et al.,
2005; Sivyer and Williams, 2013); On alpha RGCs, (Schwartz et al., 2012)).

Here, we exploit the unique structure of the IPL to isolate the contributions of type-specific synaptic
input profiles from intrinsic cellular mechanisms to elucidate whether RGC types sampling from a
similar input space use specific dendritic integration profiles to generate functionally diverse outputs.
To this end, we studied in mouse retina the dendritic integration properties of four Off RGC types that
receive excitatory input from a highly overlapping set of presynaptic neurons. To record light stimulusevoked signals across the dendritic arbour of individual RGCs, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging. We
found that these morphologically diverse RGC types differed strongly in their spatio-temporal dendritic
integration properties. A biophysical model suggests that the differential dendritic integration in these
RGC types arises from the type-specific combination of dendritic morphology and ion channel
complement.

To study dendritic integration in different RGC types, we recorded Ca2+ signals in response to visual
stimulation across the dendritic arbour of individual cells in the ex-vivo, whole-mounted mouse retina
using two-photon imaging. For that, we injected individual RGCs with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator
dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) using sharp electrodes (Methods), resulting in completely labelled
individual cells (Fig. 1a). After recording dendritic activity, the cells were 3D-reconstructed (Fig. 1b),
allowing us to extract morphological parameters such as dendritic arbour area, branching order and
asymmetry. To determine the cell’s dendritic stratification profile across the IPL relative to the ChAT
bands, blood vessels labelled with Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) were used as landmarks (Fig. 1a, b;
Methods).

To map dendritic receptive fields (RFs) of RGCs (Fig. 1c, d), we used a binary dense noise stimulus
(20x15 pixels, 30 µm/pixel) that was centred on the recording field. For each recording field (32x16
pixels @31.25 Hz), we extracted regions-of-interest (ROIs) along the dendrites using local image
correlations (Supplementary Fig. S1a; Methods). Next, we registered the position and distance of each
dendritic segment relative to the soma and extracted each ROI’s Ca2+ signal. To mitigate the effect of
low signal-to-noise ratio in some dendritic recordings, we used routinely automatic smoothness
determination (Methods; (Sahani and Linden, 2003)) to obtain reliable estimates of each ROI´s RF.
Then, we overlaid the RF contours with the cell´s morphology (Fig. 1e-g). For each cell, we recorded
different dendritic regions at various distances from the soma yielding between 40 and 232 ROIs per
cell (Fig. 1h, i; Supplementary Fig. S1c). This enabled us to systematically probe dendritic integration
across an RGC’s dendritic arbour and link the properties of local dendritic RFs to overall cell
morphology.

To compare dendritic integration profiles across RGC types with highly overlapping excitatory inputs,
we focussed on Off RGCs that stratify close to the Off ChAT band (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. S2). We
recorded n=31 cells and clustered them into four morphological groups, using four morphological
criteria: soma size, arbour asymmetry, arbour density difference and arbour area following Bae et al.
(2018) (Fig. 2; Methods). One group likely corresponded to transient Off alpha (tOff alpha) RGCs, as
indicated by a large soma and dendritic area (for statistics, see Table 1) and their characteristic
stratification profile (compare to “4 ow” RGCs in the EyeWire database of reconstructed cells of the
mouse retina, http://museum.eyewire.org). The second group likely represented the Off “mini” alpha
transient type (tOff mini; (Baden et al., 2016)): Cells assigned to this group exhibited an IPL
stratification profile very similar to tOff alpha cells, but had smaller somata and dendritic areas. The
third group resembled the morphology of F-miniOff cells (Rousso et al., 2016), exhibiting an IPL
stratification profile peaking between the Off ChAT band and the outer IPL border and a small, highly
asymmetrical dendritic arbour. Finally, the forth group displayed a similar IPL stratification profile as
sustained Off alpha RGCs (“1wt” cells in (Bae et al., 2018)), but had smaller somata and arbour areas.
These cells may correspond to the Off sustained (G7) RGCs identified by Baden et al (2016). Here, we
refer to them as sustained Off (sOff). In the following, for simplicity, we will refer to these
morphological groups as RGC types.

Dendrites can process incoming synaptic inputs on a local and a global scale, resulting in rather
compartmentalized and synchronized dendrites, respectively (Behabadi and Mel, 2014; Bernander et
al., 1991; Koch et al., 1982; Magee, 2000; Polsky et al., 2004; Williams, 2004). To investigate whether
the four Off RGC types differ with respect to their integration mode, we first assessed how the RF size
changed as a function of dendritic distance to the soma. In tOff alpha cells, local RF area systematically
decreased as a function of ROI distance from the soma (Fig. 3a-c; cf. Fig. 1g, i), suggesting that signals
in distal dendrites of tOff alpha cells are more isolated and local than those in proximal dendrites. This
was not the case in the three remaining RGC types, where RF size remained relatively constant across
different positions of the dendritic arbour (Fig. 3a-c). In fact, proximal RFs were significantly larger in
tOff alpha cells than in the other RGC types (Fig. 3d; for statistical analysis, see Supplementary
Information), which did not differ significantly in their RF size along their dendrite. Together, among
the recorded RGC types, dendritic signals in tOff alpha cells are the least spatially synchronized,
suggesting that they process dendritic input more locally than the other types.

Synchronization of dendrites can originate from strong backpropagation of somatic spikes to the
dendrites (reviewed in (Stuart and Spruston, 2015)). This is not only expected to increase dendritic RF
size but should also shift the RF´s centre closer towards the soma. In contrast, for a more isolated
dendrite without backpropagation, the RF centre should roughly correspond to the respective ROI
position. Therefore, we next measured ROI-to-RF-centre offsets for the four RGC types (Fig. 3e, f). We
found that tOff alpha cells displayed small offsets that did not change much as a function of dendritic
distance from the soma. In contrast, the other three RGC types displayed large offsets, with the RF
centre strongly shifted towards the centre of the dendritic arbour, which in tOff mini and sOff cells also

coincided with the soma (Fig. 3e). Moreover, in tOff mini and sOff cells, offsets increased with dendritic
distance from the soma (Fig. 3f). In F-miniOff cells, due to their asymmetrical dendritic arbours, offsets
increased with dendritic distance from the arbour centre (Fig. 3f), resulting in an inverted-bell shaped
curve. For large dendritic distances, the offsets were significantly different between all pairs of RGC
types (Fig. 3g). These results confirm that dendrites of tOff mini, sOff and F-miniOff cells are more
synchronized than those of tOff alpha cells, possibly due to backpropagation.

Strongly isolated dendrites, as observed in tOff alpha cells, could allow dendritic computations at a
finer spatial scale than the whole cell’s RF. Such isolated dendrites are expected to be spatially more
independent than the better synchronized dendrites of tOff mini, sOff and F-miniOff cells. To test this
prediction, we determined the overlap of RFs for every ROI pair recorded in a single cell (Fig. 4a, b).
We then assessed how the overlap changed with dendritic distance and angle between ROIs (Fig. 4b, c;
Supplementary Fig. S3). We found localized and spatially independent RFs only in tOff alpha RGCs (Fig.
4a, c). Here, RF overlap decreased substantially with increasing dendritic and angular distance between
ROIs, in line with our previous results. In tOff mini cells, RFs showed partial overlap even when the
ROIs were located at opposite sides of the dendritic arbour (Fig. 4a, c). For sOff and F-miniOff cells, RFs
overlapped substantially, independent of dendritic and angular distance between ROIs. As a result, the
RF overlap maps significantly differed between tOff alpha and the other three RGC types, and partially
between tOff mini and the remaining two RGC types (Fig. 4d), supporting significant differences in
dendritic processing – from more local in tOff alpha to more global in F-miniOff.

Together, these results suggest that different RGC types with similar input profiles apply vastly
different dendritic integration rules. For example, the dendrites of tOff alpha cells seem to exhibit little
backpropagation but reasonably strong forward propagation, integrating RFs from all dendrites
symmetrically. This leads to larger proximal than distal RFs and distal RFs with little overlap and
displacement. In contrast, the other three RGC types show strong indication for backpropagation
across their dendritic arbour, causing distal RFs to be highly overlapping and displaced towards the
centre of the dendritic arbour.

Dendritic inputs are not only integrated across space, but also over time. To relate spatial to temporal
dendritic integration, we next probed the temporal synchronisation of light responses across the
dendritic arbour of the four RGC types. For that, we used a “chirp” stimulus that consisted of a light
step followed by frequency and contrast modulations (Methods) and was presented as local (100 µm
in diameters) and full-field (500 µm) version. Notably, F-miniOff RGCs did not show any reliable dendritic
chirp responses, despite the same ROIs passing our RF quality threshold (Methods). This finding is
consistent with earlier observations in this RGC type (cf. “x2 cell” of Extended Data Fig. 5 in (Baden et
al., 2016)). Therefore, we focussed the following analysis on the remaining three RGC types.

We found that dendritic responses to the local chirp in tOff alpha and tOff mini RGCs were quite similar
but differed from those in sOff RGCs (Fig. 5a-c). In the latter, local chirp responses were more sustained
than those in the other two types (Supplemental Fig. S4c); this difference resonates with sOff cells
stratifying slightly more distally (cf. Fig. 2a) and, hence, presumably receiving more input from
sustained BC types (Franke et al., 2017; Roska and Werblin, 2001; Yu et al., 2018). When presented
with the full-field chirp, tOff alpha and tOff mini RGC responses became somewhat more distinct (i.e.
to the frequency modulation). This difference was not found in an earlier study (Baden et al., 2016)
but may be related to the fact that in the present study, light stimuli could be precisely centred on the
recorded cell. In addition, all three RGC types often showed On events that were much less frequent
for the local chirp (Fig. 5a-c; Supplemental Fig. S4b, d). Similar On-events in Off-cells have also been
observed in BC responses (Franke et al., 2017). In general, differences between full-field and local chirp
responses were more pronounced in sOff RGCs (Supplemental Fig. S4e), suggesting that stimulus size
had a larger effect on sOff cells compared to the other two types. This could be due to a stronger
inhibitory surround or connections to BCs that are more strongly influenced by surround stimulation
(Franke et al., 2017).

To analyse the temporal properties of dendritic integration in these cells, we quantified the correlation
of local or full-field chirp responses between ROI pairs across the dendritic arbour (Fig. 5d). In all three
RGC types, correlations between ROIs were higher for responses to local than to full-field chirps (Fig.
5d, e). The decorrelation observed for full-field chirps was especially pronounced in sOff cells (Fig. 5e).
In tOff alpha and sOff RGCs, correlation decreased with dendritic and angular distance (Fig. 5d). While
in tOff alpha cells, lower correlation coincided with smaller and less overlapping RFs, sOff RGCs
displayed low correlation in their distal dendrites while at the same time featuring highly overlapping
RFs across the whole dendritic arbour. In contrast to the other two RGCs, temporal correlation in tOff
mini cells was largely independent of dendritic and angular distance (Fig. 5d). In addition, correlation
was overall much higher, indicating that dendritic segments in tOff mini cells are temporally more
synchronized (cf. Fig. 5c). Because differences in temporal correlation between RGC types persisted
when applying a more stringent quality criterion (Supplemental Fig. S6; Methods), it is unlikely that
they were due to systematic differences in recording quality (i.e. signal-to-noise-ratio).

Taken together, our data suggest that spatio-temporal integration is tuned across the RGC dendritic
arbour in a highly type-specific manner (Fig. 5f, g). The studied RGC types ranged between two main
dendritic integration profiles: The first profile featured strongly isolated dendrites (e.g. in tOff alpha)
and may render the cell sensitive to fine visual stimulus structures within the cell’s RF. In contrast, the
second profile featured strongly synchronised dendrites with highly overlapping RFs (e.g. in tOff mini
RGCs) and may tune the cell towards robustly detecting a stimulus independent of its location within
the RF.

ion channels (Koch et al., 1982; Rall and Rinzel, 1973). To understand which of these properties may
explain the dendritic integration profiles we observed, we built a simple, morphology-inspired
biophysical model and focussed on the effects of the type-specific morphology and dendritic channel
densities in tOff alpha and tOff mini cells (Fig. 6a).

To capture the morphological differences between the cell types, we first extracted morphological
parameters from a published EM dataset (Bae et al., 2018). We found that for tOff alpha cells, dendritic
radius decreased systematically with increasing branch order; this decrease was less pronounced in
tOff mini cells (Fig. 6b). In addition, dendritic segment length increased with branch order for tOff alpha
cells, while it remained constant for tOff mini cells. Based on these differences, we built a ball-andstick model for each cell type (Fig. 6c). For our simulations, we provided either a proximal or distal

input, with readout positions at the dendritic tip and close to the soma (Methods). Based on the
dendritic integration profiles of tOff alpha and tOff mini cells (cf. Figs. 3-5), we hypothesize that (i) in
tOff alpha cells, forward propagation (from distal to proximal dendrites) should be stronger than
backward propagation and (ii) that backpropagation should be strong in tOff mini cells (Fig. 6c).

To investigate the role of ion channel distribution on dendritic signal propagation, we systematically
varied the dendritic density of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (𝑔̅𝐾,𝐶𝑎 ) and voltage-gated K+, Na+ and Ca2+
channels (𝑔̅𝐾 , 𝑔̅𝑁𝑎 and 𝑔̅𝐶𝑎 ). Notably, the same combination of channel densities had quite different
effects when applied to the two RGC morphologies (compare columns in Fig. 6d and Supplemental Fig.
7), highlighting how strongly the interplay between morphology and channel complement affects a
cell’s dendritic signal propagation. Notably, we found that distinct, cell-type specific sets of ion channel
densities were compatible with the experimentally derived hypotheses (Fig. 6d): For the tOff alpha cell
model, intermediate 𝑔̅𝐾,𝐶𝑎 and high 𝑔̅𝑁𝑎 and 𝑔̅𝐶𝑎 channel densities were required to generate
stronger forward propagation compared to backward propagation (Fig. 6d, e). For the same channel
densities, forward propagation in modelled tOff mini cell was so low that distal inputs were almost
completely extinguished before reaching the proximal dendrite. In contrast, with higher 𝑔̅𝐾 and lower
𝑔̅𝑁𝑎 densities, tOff mini cells showed strong backward and substantial forward propagation, in line
with our hypothesis (Fig. 6d, e).

311
312
313

Together, these results suggest that morphology alone does not explain the experimentally observed
differences between the two cell types. Instead, our model indicates that differences in dendritic
channel densities may be responsible for the distinct dendritic integration profiles in RGCs.

DISCUSSION

319

Here, we studied dendritic integration in four types of mouse Off RGC (tOff alpha, tOff mini, sOff, and
F-miniOff), which have their dendrites in overlapping strata of the IPL and, hence, receive highly
overlapping sets of synaptic input. Recordings of local, light-evoked dendritic activity and compartmental modelling revealed surprising differences between the cells’ spatio-temporal dendritic integration. What could these distinct integration rules be good for in terms of visual computations?

In tOff alpha RGCs (Deny et al., 2017; Krieger et al., 2017; Pang et al., 2003; Van Wyk et al., 2009), as
the distance from the soma increased, RF area decreased and dendritic RFs became increasingly nonoverlapping, with minimal offset between recording site and respective RF centre. In addition, activity
on different dendritic branches was only moderately correlated. The more isolated, independent
dendritic segments in tOff alpha cells may help them to detect fine structures of visual stimuli and
support visual computations relying on spatial resolution below the RF of the entire cell. This is
reminiscent of what has been reported about On alpha cells, which possess nonlinear RFs and respond
to patterns that contain local structures finer than the cell’s RF centre (Schwartz et al., 2012). In
contrast, in tOff mini and sOff RGCs (Baden et al., 2016), RFs overlapped extensively and changed little
in area, while their centres were systematically shifted towards the soma. In addition, the timing of
responses was highly correlated across tOff mini dendrites, suggesting they may reliably detect stimuli
independent of their location within the RF. For sOff RGCs, the temporal correlation between the
activity of different dendritic branches decreased strongly for larger stimuli, suggesting that the cell’s
computational properties change for extended visual stimuli, likely due to lateral amacrine cell circuits
kicking in. F-miniOff cells (Rousso et al., 2016) were similar to tOff mini and sOff RGCs with some
particularities related to the high asymmetry of their dendritic arbour. Our morphologically inspired
biophysical model revealed that morphological difference alone cannot explain these experimentally
observed dendritic integration profiles; instead, distinct combinations of morphology, ion channel
complements and densities are required.

Dendritic integration rules have been studied extensively in the cortex (e.g. (Schmidt-Hieber et al.,
2017; Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2016; Vetter et al., 2001)). In the retina, mainly interneurons have been at
the centre of interest: For example, it has been suggested that horizontal cells (Chapot et al., 2017)
and A17 amacrine cells (Grimes et al., 2010) provide locally computed feedback by confining signals
within single varicosities. Likewise, starburst amacrine cell dendrites compute the direction of motion
“dendrite-wise” by dividing their dendritic arbour into isolated sectors which contain 15-20 varicosities
each (Euler et al., 2002; Koren et al., 2017; Poleg-Polsky et al., 2018). In RGCs, dendritic integration has
been studied in direction-selective (DS) RGCs, where intrinsic properties of their dendritic arbour
(Schachter et al., 2010; Sivyer and Williams, 2013) and partially their asymmetry (Trenholm et al., 2011)
contribute to the generation of DS output. Reminiscent of our findings in tOff alpha cell, the dendritic
arbour of DS RGCs is functionally partitioned, with the “DS mechanism” replicated across the dendritic
arbour, such that local motion within the cell’s RF can cause a robust spiking response (Barlow and
Levick, 1965; Oesch et al., 2005).

We chose to focus on four types of Off RGCs because they are expected to receive similar excitatory
synaptic inputs. Nevertheless, due to small differences in dendritic stratification depth, they make
connections with partially different sets of BCs: tOff alpha cells contact mainly transient type 3a and 4
BCs, while sOff cells likely contact mainly the more sustained type 1 and 2 BCs (Bae et al., 2018;
Helmstaedter et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2018). In line with this, we found that the dendrites of tOff alpha
cells exhibited more transient responses than those from sOff cells. Since tOff mini RGCs co-stratify
with tOff alpha RGCs, they likely receive excitatory inputs from the same BC types and thus should

exhibit similar response properties. Indeed, these two RGC types showed similar responses to local
chirps. Nevertheless, they may be differentially modulated by type-specific connectivity to ACs. In line
with this, the two cell types showed more distinct responses to full-field chirps. In principle, the
interaction of excitation from BCs and inhibition from ACs may attenuate the excitatory inputs and
affect dendritic integration (Roska et al., 2006), raising the possibility that the observed type-specific
differences could at least partially result from type-specific microcircuit connectivity rather than mainly
from cell intrinsic properties as suggested above. While we cannot exclude this possibility, our
simulation results suggest a more parsimonious explanation for the observed differences in these
dendritic integration profiles, relying on cell-intrinsic mechanisms only.

Apart from contributions of the microcircuit connectivity, dendritic integration is mainly determined
by a combination of morphological features and passive and active membrane properties, which can
differ significantly between RGC types (reviewed in (Stuart and Spruston, 2015)). In some RGC types
like the tOff alpha, for instance, the dendritic diameter becomes smaller and dendritic segment length
gets longer with increasing branch order. This, in turn, results in a higher axial resistance and shorter
propagation distance for more distal dendritic signals. In other RGC types like tOff mini, however,
dendritic diameter and segment length does not systematically change with increasing branch order.
In addition, a variety of ion channels, including Ca2+-activated K+ channels, hyperpolarization-activated
cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and voltage-gated K+, Na+ and Ca2+ channels, have been found
in RGC dendrites, differing in density and dendritic locations between cell types (Van Hook et al., 2019).

An earlier theoretical study suggested that alpha RGCs – with their large dendritic arbours, thick and
short proximal but thin and long distal branches (Wässle et al., 1981) – feature independent dendritic
regions (Koch et al., 1982). In contrast, RGCs with constant dendritic diameter and branch length across
their dendritic arbour are thought to produce densely coupled dendritic regions. In these RGCs, their
morphology could enable more efficient dendritic backpropagation and therefore lead to the
synchronization of dendritic signals (Tran-Van-Minh et al., 2015). Indeed, we observed more
independent dendritic regions in tOff alpha cells, but more spatially synchronized dendritic regions in
tOff mini, sOff and F-miniOff cells. In tOff mini and tOff alpha cells, their forward and backward
propagation were differentially modulated by the same combinations of ion channel densities,
confirming that dendritic morphology is a key determinant of dendritic signal propagation efficiency.
However, our simulation results suggest that the dendritic integration properties of tOff alpha and tOff
mini RGCs could not be explained by dendritic morphology alone but require dendritic ion channels in
agreement with earlier simulation studies (Maturana et al., 2014). One possible reason might be that
for most RGCs, action potentials generated in the soma can back propagate to the dendritic arbour
(Velte and Masland, 1999), which needs dendritic ion channels to enable the efficient backpropagation
(van Rossum et al., 2003; Velte and Masland, 1999).

Our simulation results are based on highly simplified ball-and-stick models of RGC dendrites, as these
allowed us to focus on the principles of dendritic integration. Obviously, these models come with
several caveats and possibilities for future extensions: First, the morphological parameters we used
were extracted from EM data (Bae et al., 2018), where tissue can shrink due to chemical fixation, such
that we may have underestimated the axial conductance based on dendrite diameter. Second, it has
been reported that the branching pattern is an important variable for determining propagation
efficiency of dendritic signals, mainly because of the diameter changes at branch-points (Ferrante et
al., 2013). Third, the density and complement of ion channels can vary along the dendrite (Hausser et
al., 2000; Van Hook et al., 2019), raising the possibility that spatially varying ion channel densities
would allow for more refined control over dendritic computations. Finally, dendritic signalling is driven
by the complex interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs (as already mentioned above) and the

types and microcircuits in question. A more realistic model incorporating these aspects could allow
additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the observed spatio-temporal dendritic integration
rules.

Mice used in this study were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and housed under a standard 12 hour
day/night cycle. For all experiments, mice aged 5-8 weeks of either sex were used. We used the
transgenic mouse line B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J (“PV”, JAX 008069, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Habor,
ME; (Hippenmeyer et al., 2005)) cross-bred with the red florescence Cre-dependent reporter line
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze (“Ai9tdTomato“, JAX 007905) for all recordings of tOff mini, sOff and FminiOff cells (n=25 animals). For alpha RGC recordings, we also used the wild-type line (C57Bl/6J, JAX
000664, n=3 animals), as alpha RGCs can be easily targeted due to their large soma size. All animal
procedures followed the laws governing animal experimentation issued by the German federal
government and were approved by the institutional animal welfare committee of the University of
Tübingen.

Mice were dark adapted ≥ 2 hours before tissue preparation, then anaesthetized with isoflurane
(Baxter, Hechingen Germany) and killed with cervical dislocation. The eyes were quickly enucleated in
carboxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 125
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, and 0.5 L-glutamine (pH 7.4).
After removing cornea, sclera and vitreous body, the retina was flattened on an Anodisc (0.2 µm pore
size, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) with the ganglion cell side facing up and then transferred to the
recording chamber of the microscope, where it was continuously perfused with carboxygenated ACSF
(at 35°C and 4 ml/min). All experimental procedures were carried out under very dim red light.

To visualize blood vessels and avoiding them when filling individual RGCs, 5 µl of a 50 mM sulforhodamine-101 (SR101, Invitrogen /Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) stock solution was added
per litre ACSF solution. Sharp electrodes for single-cell injection were pulled on a P-1000 micropipette
puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) with resistances ranging between 70 and 130 MΩ. Oregon
Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1, hexapotassium salt; Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany; 15 mM in water)
was loaded into individual RGCs using the single-pulse function (500 ms, -10 nA) of a MultiClamp 900A
amplifier (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK). To allow the cells to completely fill
and recover, we started recordings 1 h post-injection.

A MOM-type two-photon microscope (designed by W. Denk, MPI, Martinsried; purchased from Sutter
Instruments/Science Products) as described previously (Euler et al., 2009) was used for this study.
Briefly, the system was equipped with a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai-HP DeepSee, Newport
Spectra-Physics, Darmstadt, Germany), green and red fluorescence detection channels for OGB-1 (HQ
510/84, AHF, Tübingen, Germany) and SR101/tdTomato (HQ 630/60, AHF), and a water immersion
objective (W Plan-Apochromat 20x/1,0 DIC M27, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For all scans, we tuned
the laser to 927 nm, and used a custom-made software (ScanM, by M. Müller, MPI, Martinsried, and
T.E.) running under IGOR Pro 6.3 for Windows (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). Time-elapsed dendritic
signals were recorded with 64×16 pixel image sequences (31.25 Hz). High-resolution morphology
stacks were acquired using 512×512 pixel image stacks with 0.8 or 1.0 µm z steps.

Light stimuli were projected through the objective lens (Euler et al., 2009). We used two alternative

MKII (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX; modified by EKB Technologies Ltd., Israel). Both were equipped
with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) – “green” (575 nm) and UV (390 nm) that match the spectral
sensitivities of mouse M- and S-opsins (for details, see (Baden et al., 2016; Franke et al., 2019)). Both
LEDs were intensity-calibrated to range from 0.1 x103 (“black“ background) to 20.0 x103 (“white“ full
field) photoisomerisations P*/s/cone. The light stimulus was centred before every experiment,
ensuring that its centre corresponded to the centre of the microscope’s scan field. For all experiments,
the tissue was kept at a constant mean stimulator intensity level for ≥ 15 s after the laser scanning
started and before light stimuli were presented.

459
460

Light stimuli were generated and presented using the Python-based software package QDSpy (see
Table 4). Three types of light stimuli were used:

461
462

(1) binary dense noise (20x15 matrix of 30 μm/pixel; each pixel displayed an independent, balanced
random sequence at 5 Hz for 5 minutes) for spatio-temporal receptive field (RF) mapping;

463
464

(2) full-field (800x600 µm) “chirp”, consisting of a bright step and two sinusoidal intensity
modulations, one with increasing frequency (0.5-8 Hz) and one with increasing contrast.

465

(3) local “chirp”; like (2) but with a diameter of 100 µm.

Directly after the recording, the complete dendritic morphology of the RGC was captured by acquiring
a high-resolution stack. In case the cell was not bright enough to see all branches in detail, a second
dye-injection was performed. Using semi-automatic neurite tracing (Longair et al., 2011) , we obtained
cell skeletons of the recorded RGCs. If necessary, we de-warped image stack and traced cell, as
described earlier (Baden et al., 2016). All further analysis, such as the extraction of morphological
parameters (see below), was done using custom Python scripts.

As the full dendritic morphology could not be imaged during calcium recordings, recorded dendrites
(i.e. ROIs, see below) were not necessarily well-aligned with the cell morphology reconstructed later.
Based on the relative position of each recording field, a region 9 times larger than this recording field
was cropped from the reconstructed morphology and z-projected. Next, the recording field was
automatically aligned to this cropped region using match_templates from scikit-image (Table 4).
The centre coordinates of all ROIs in that recording field were then calibrated to the closest dendritic
branch based on their Euclidean distance. In rare cases, when automatic matching failed, the matching
was done manually.

Morphological parameters and hierarchical clustering

To morphologically cluster the RGCs as described by Bae et al. (2018), we had to determine the relative
position of the two ChAT bands, the dendritic plexi of the starburst amacrine cells (Vaney, 1984). For
this, the blood vessel plexi in GCL and INL served as landmarks. With their positions defined as 0 and
1, the relative IPL depth of the On and Off ChAT bands is 0.48 and 0.77, respectively, as shown earlier
(Baden et al., 2016; Franke et al., 2017). The following parameters were extracted for each cell:

To determine the marginal-central arbour density difference, we defined the central IPL as the
portion between the ChAT bands and the remainder (On ChAT band to GCL, Off ChAT band to INL)
as marginal IPL (cf. Fig. 2b, inset). The marginal-central arbour density difference was calculated

using the sum of the dendritic length in central IPL minus the sum of the dendritic length located in
marginal IPL.

Dendritic arbour area was calculated as the area of the tightest convex hull containing the zprojected dendritic arbour.

Asymmetry of the dendritic arbour was calculated as the distance between the centre of mass of
dendritic density and the soma position.

largest was used.

two ROIs.

Hierarchical clustering was performed with 1D k-means clustering with k=2 for all splits, using KMeans
from the Python package scikit-learn (Table 4). First, cells were split into two clusters based on arbour
density difference (cf. Fig. 2b). Next, the group with lower arbour density difference was separated by
soma size, while the group with the higher arbour density difference was further split based on their
asymmetry index. Here, we refrained from further splitting, because the cells in each group displayed
highly consistent light responses. Thus, these four groups were used for further analysis.

Data analysis

All data were analysed using custom scripts: For data preprocessing, we used IGOR Pro; further analysis
and modelling was done using Python and R. Upon publication, all data, scripts and models will become
available (see links in Table 4).

Regions of interest (ROIs) – We used dense noise recordings to extract ROIs. First, for each recorded
field, the standard deviation (s.d.) of the fluorescence intensity for each pixel over time was calculated,
generating an s.d. image of the time-lapsed image stack. Pixels brighter than the mean of the s.d. image
plus 1 s.d. were considered dendritic pixels. Then, in each recorded field, the time traces of the 100
most responsive dendritic pixels (=100 brightest dendritic pixels in the s.d. image) were extracted and
cross-correlated. The mean of the resulting cross-correlation coefficients (𝜌) served as correlation
threshold (𝜌𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 ) for each field. Next, we grouped neighbouring pixels (within a distance of 3 µm)
with 𝜌 > 𝜌𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 into one ROI. Finally, each ROI’s Ca2+ trace was extracted using the image analysis
toolbox SARFIA for IGOR Pro (Dorostkar et al., 2010). A time marker embedded in the recorded data
served to align the traces relative to the visual stimulus with 2 ms precision. All stimulus-aligned traces

Dendritic receptive fields – Dendritic RFs were estimated using Automatic Smoothness Determination
(ASD, (Sahani and Linden, 2003)), a linear-Gaussian encoding model within the empirical Bayes
framework. The relationship between stimulus and response was modelled as a linear function plus
Gaussian noise:

531

yi = 𝑘 𝑇 xi + 𝜀i , 𝜀i ~ 𝑁(0, δ2 )

(1)

532
533
534

where x is the binary dense noise stimulus (20x15 matrix of 30 µm/pixel), y is the gradient of the Ca2+
response, 𝑘 is the spatio-temporal RF (STRF) with a time lag ranging from -1,000 ms to 0 ms, and 𝜀 is
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise with zero mean and δ2 variance.

535
536
537
538
539
540

The STRF was then calculated in two steps (Sahani and Linden, 2003): First, the ASD prior covariance
( 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = exp(-ρ-Δ𝑖𝑗 /2δ ) , where Δ𝑖𝑗 is the squared distance between any two filter coefficients),
controlled by the spatial and temporal smoothness (δ) and scale (ρ), was optimized using evidence
optimization. Then, the STRF was estimated by maximum a posteriori linear regression between
response and stimulus using the optimized prior. The spatial RF maps shown represent the spatial
component of the singular value decomposition of the STRF.

541
542
543

To quantify the quality of spatial RFs, contours were drawn on up-sampled and normalized RF maps
with different thresholds (0.60, 0.65 and 0.70). The quality was then determined from the number of
contours, their sizes and their degree of irregularity. The irregularity index was defined as

544

𝐼𝑖 = 1 − 𝐴

𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑟

𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑥 ℎ𝑢𝑙𝑙

(2)

545
546
547

with 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑟 corresponding the area of the RF contour, and 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑥 ℎ𝑢𝑙𝑙 the 2D morphology’s convex
hull. Only data with a good RF (a single contour with 𝐼𝑖 < 0.1, 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑟 > 1.8 ∙ 1,000 µm2, at a
contour threshold of 0.60; see Suppl. Fig. S1) were used for further analyses.

548
549

Offset between ROI centre and its RF centre – RF offset was calculated as the linear distance between
ROI centre and the geometrical centre of its RF contour.

550

Dendritic RF overlap index – An RF overlap index (𝑂𝑖) was calculated as follows:

551

Ao

𝑂𝑖 = Amin[A

1 ,A2 ]

(3)

552
553

where 𝐴1 and 𝐴2 are the RF areas of the ROI pair, Ao is the overlap area between 𝐴1 and 𝐴2 , and
𝐴𝑚𝑖𝑛[𝐴1 , 𝐴2 ] corresponds to the smaller area (𝐴1 or 𝐴2 ).

554
555
556
557
558

Full-field chirp and local chirp – Ca2+ traces for full-field and local chirp stimuli were linearly up-sampled
(interpolated) to 500 Hz, baseline-subtracted (using the mean of 2,500 samples before light stimulus
onset) and normalized by the s.d. of this baseline. To estimate the signal-to-noise ratio, we calculated
the response quality index (𝑄𝑖) for both full-field and local chirps as described before (Franke et al.,
2017):

559
560
561
562
563
564

Var[〈𝐶〉 ]

𝑄𝑖 = Var[〈𝐶〉r] t
t r

(4)

where 𝐶 is the T-by-R response matrix (time samples by stimulus repetitions) and 〈〉x and Var[]x
denote the mean and variance across the indicated dimension, respectively. If all trials were identical,
such that the mean response is a perfect representative of the response, 𝑄𝑖 = 1. If all trials were
completely random with fixed variance, such that the mean response is not informative about the
individual trials, 𝑄𝑖 ∝ 1/𝑅.

565
566
567
568

Signal correlation – To quantify temporal signal correlation, we cross-correlated the mean Ca2+
responses. We noticed that some ROIs with good spatial RFs (see above) displayed a low signal-tonoise chirp responses. Hence, we repeated the analysis for 𝑄𝑖 > 0.4 or 0.5 with comparable result
(Supplemental Fig. S6).

569
570
571
572
573
574

Further temporal analysis – Using the responses to the step part of the chirp stimulus, we calculated a
transience index (𝑇𝑖, for local chirp) and a polarity index (𝑃𝑂𝑖, for both local and full-field chirps). Here,
only ROIs with 𝑄𝑖 > 0.4 were used for the analysis. Before the computation of these indices, the mean
traces were binomially smoothed (with 3,000 repetitions). Then, 2 s.d. of the baseline (2,500 samples
of the smoothed trace before light stimulus onset) were used to determine the time of response onset
(𝑇𝑅_𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 ) and offset (𝑇𝑅_𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 ).

575

𝑇𝑖 was calculated as

576

𝑇𝑖 = 1 −

𝑇𝑅_𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 −𝑇𝑅_𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡
𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠

(5)

577

where 𝑇𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠 is the stimulus duration.

578

For 𝑃𝑂𝑖, data points before and after the response (see above) were set to zero, before calculating:

579

POI =

𝑏
∑𝑏
𝑡=0 𝑟(𝑡+𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑛 )− ∑𝑡=0 𝑟(𝑡+𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑓𝑓 )
𝑏
∑𝑏
𝑡=0 𝑟(𝑡+𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑛 )+∑𝑡=0 𝑟 (𝑡+𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑓𝑓 )

(6)

580
581
582

Where 𝑏 = 3 s, 𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑛 and 𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 𝑜𝑓𝑓 are the time points of light stimulus onset and offset, 𝑟(𝑡) is the
mean response at time 𝑡. For ROIs responding only to the light-onset, 𝑃𝑂𝑖 = 1, whereas for ROIs only
responding during the light-offset, 𝑃𝑂𝑖 = −1.

583

Statistical analysis

584
585
586
587
588

We used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to analyse the relationships of RF size vs. dendritic
distance; RF offset vs. dendritic distance; RF overlap vs. dendritic distance and dendritic angle;
temporal correlation vs. dendritic distance and dendritic angle (for details, see Supplemental
Information). GAMs extend the generalized linear model by allowing the linear predictors to depend
on arbitrary smooth functions of the underlying variables (Wood, 2006):

589

𝑔(𝜇) = 𝛽0 + 𝑓1 (𝑥1 ) + ⋯ + 𝑓𝑛 (𝑥𝑛 )

(7)

590
591

Here, 𝑥𝑖 are the predictor variables, 𝑔 is a link function, and the 𝑓𝑖 are smooth functions of the
predictor variables. These smooth functions can also depend on more than one predictor variable.

592
593
594
595
596
597
598
599
600

To implement GAMs and perform statistical testing, we employed the mgcv package for R (Table 4).
Here, for smooth terms we used penalized regression splines. We modelled the dependence of our
variable of interest as a single smooth term per cell type for univariate dependencies and a tensor
product smooth for bivariate dependencies. The dimension of the basis was set high enough such that
the estimated degrees of freedom stayed sufficiently below the possible maximum. Smoothing
parameters were selected via the default methods of the package. All models also included a random
effect term for cell identity. Typically, we used models from the Gaussian family; for the dependence
of RF overlap on dendritic distance and dendritic angle, we instead used a scaled t-distribution, as this
improved BIC (Bayesian information criterion) and diagnostic plots.

601
602
603
604

Statistical significance for differences in the obtained smooths between cell types were performed
using plot_diff or plot_diff2 of the itsadug package for R (Table 4). 95% confidence intervals
were calculated using the simultaneous confidence intervals (CI) option, excluding the random effect
of cell identity.

To explore the mechanisms underlying dendritic integration in different RGC types, we built a multicompartmental 1D model. To get precise measurements of dendrite thickness and segment length for
tOff alpha and tOff mini cells, we extracted these information from published morphologies of “4ow”
and “4i” RGCs (cf. Fig. 6b), respectively, reconstructed from EM data (http://museum.eyewire.org).
Then we mapped the medium values of these parameters to the respective branch order of the model
(cf. Fig. 6c). The model was implemented in the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale,
1997). Here, each dendritic portion (between two branch points) was represented as a “section” in the
simulator, which was further divided into multiple “segments” (compartments) with a maximal length
of 7 µm. The 1D model can be characterized by the cable equation,

where 𝑉 is the voltage across the cell membrane, 𝑥 is the distance along the cable, 𝑑 is the dendritic
diameter, 𝑟̃𝑎 is the intracellular resistivity, and 𝐶𝑚 is the specific membrane capacitance. 𝐼𝑖𝑜𝑛
represents the sum of four voltage-gated cation currents (sodium, 𝐼𝑁𝑎 ; calcium, 𝐼𝐶𝑎 ; delayed rectifier
potassium, 𝐼𝐾 ; A-type potassium, 𝐼𝐾,𝐴 ), one calcium-activated potassium current (𝐼𝐾,𝐶𝑎 ), and one leak
current (𝐼𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘 ). The current dynamics are described following Fohlmeister and Miller (1997) as:

621

𝐼𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐼𝑁𝑎 + 𝐼𝐶𝑎 + 𝐼𝐾 + 𝐼𝐾,𝐴 + 𝐼𝐾,𝐶𝑎 + 𝐼𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑘

622

= 𝑔̅𝑁𝑎 𝑚3 ℎ(𝑉 − 𝑉𝑁𝑎 ) + 𝑔̅𝐶𝑎 𝑐 3 (𝑉 − 𝑉𝐶𝑎 )

The intracellular stimulation current (𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 in Eq. 8) was the product of a 5,000 ms x 200 µm 1D
Gaussian noise stimulus and a BC’s spatial RF with a Gaussian shape (with the width set by σ=6 and the
centre depends on the current injection location). The stimulation current was injected either at the
proximal (at 25 µm from soma) or distal dendrite (at 85% of the total dendrite length from soma), then
filtered by a soft rectification function. The magnitude of 𝐼𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚 was scaled between 0 and 15 nA with a
mean of 6.17 nA and an s.d. of 1.88 nA to ensure that the input stimulus would elicit spikes in the soma
for all parameter combinations.

Model parameters (Table 2) and channel conductances (Table 3) were taken from Fohlmeister and
Miller (1997). To identify parameters that explain the experimental data, we grid-searched
combinations of ion channel densities by multiplying the reference parameters with different scaling
factors (for 𝑔̅𝐾 and 𝑔̅𝐶𝑎 , the scaling factors ranged from 0 to 2, and were incremented by 0.25 each
step; for 𝑔̅𝑁𝑎 , we used [0.1, 1, 2], for 𝑔̅𝐾,𝐶𝑎 , [10, 100, 1000, 5000, 9000]).

Voltage changes in the dendrites were read out at the centre of each dendritic “section” and used to
estimate the local dendritic RF with a maximum likelihood method, then smoothed by a Savitzky-Golay
filter (window length of 31; 3rd degree polynomial). The peak amplitudes of dendritic RFs were
measured and normalized to the RF at the position closest to the current input.
