Abstract

2

Reaction-diffusion (RD) based clock and wavefront model has long been proposed as the

3

mechanism underlying biological pattern formation of repeated and segmented structures

4

including somitogenesis. However, systematic molecular level understanding of the

5

mechanism remains elusive, largely due to the lack of suitable experimental systems to

6

probe RD quantitatively in vivo. Here we design a synthetic gene circuit that couples gene

7

expression regulation (reaction) with quorum sensing (diffusion) to guide bacterial cells

8

self-organizing into stripe patterns at both microscopic and colony scales. An

9

experimentally verified mathematical model confirms that these periodic spatial structures

10

are emerged from the integration of oscillatory gene expression as the molecular clock and

11

the outward expanding diffusions as the propagating wavefront. Furthermore, our paired

12

model-experiment data illustrate that the RD-based patterning is sensitive to initial

13

conditions and can be modulated by external inducers to generate diverse patterns,

14

including multiple-stripe pattern, target-like pattern and ring patterns with reversed

15

fluorescence. Powered by our synthetic biology setup, we also test different topologies of

16

gene networks and show that network motifs enabling robust oscillations are foundations

17

of sequential stripe pattern formation. These results verified close connections between

18

gene network topology and resulting RD driven pattern formation, offering an engineering

19

approach to help understand biological development.

Main text

24

Turing's seminal work first proposed reaction-diffusion (RD) as the "chemical basis of

25

morphogenesis" over six decades ago 1. It provides a general theoretical foundation of

26

pattern formation via RD mechanisms. Two decades later, RD driven clock and wavefront

27

(CW) mechanism was hypothesized as the mechanism underlying formation of repeated

28

and segmented structures such as somites in development 2. Since then, although RD driven

29

pattern formation has been demonstrated or identified in chemical, physical, and ecological

30

systems 3–10, its much-hypothesized role in multicellular pattern formation hasn't been fully

31

studied biologically. This is largely due to the lack of suitable model systems to test such

32

hypotheses. For example, somite development requires precise temporal and spatial

33

coordination between a heterogeneous web of intracellular responses and intercellular

Past studies have suggested that nonlinear multistable systems could also direct

12

spatiotemporal pattern formation when coupled with external diffusion process

13

Following this strategy to achieve a multicellular pattern formation, we designed and

and

19

Specifically, the MINPAC topology is built upon two hybrid promoters Plas/tet and Plux/lac,

20

which harbor high nonlinearity and inducibility (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Plas/tet drives LasR,

21

LuxI and LacI expression, representing the node X in Fig. 1B, whereas Plux/lac regulates

22

transcription of LuxR, LasI, and TetR, representing the node Y. LasI and LuxI are synthases

23

that catalyze the synthesis of autoinducer 3-oxo-C12-HSL (C12) and 3-oxo-C6-HSL (C6),

24

respectively. The two small autoinducers can diffuse out of and into cells to mediate cell-cell

25

communication and coordinate population behaviors on a spatial domain. LasR and LuxR

26

activate Plas/tet and Plux/lac in the presence of C12 and C6, respectively, forming positive

27

autoregulations. IPTG inhibits the repressive effect of LacI on Plux/lac, and aTc counteracts

28

TetR inhibition on Plas/tet, forming the mutual inhibitions. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)

29

and mCherry protein serve as the corresponding reporters of Plux/lac and Plas/tet activities

30

in living cells (Fig. 1A).

23
24

To investigate whether MINPAC could direct single cells to self-organize into spatial

25

patterns, we transformed the circuit into E. coli cells and serially diluted cell cultures into

26

single cells before seeding on a semi-solid minimal M9 medium (Fig. 1C). Using live single-

27

cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed the early stage of pattern formation

28

(Fig. 1D). After an initial phase of uniform fluorescence (4 & 8 hours), we observed that cells

29

differentiated into equivalent numbers of green and red fluorescence in a disordered,

30

seemingly-random, spatial distribution (12 & 14 hours). As microcolonies grew to ~100 μm

31

in diameter (between 14 and 21 hours of growth), a red-center green out-circle

32

fluorescence pattern starts to emerge (Fig. 1D). These results illustrate that our engineered

33

pattern formation is scale-dependent at the early stage and the pattern starts to emerge

34

only after cell number reaches a certain threshold. We reason that as the stochastic growth

35

progresses through time, while outcomes of cell-cell variability are hard to predict initially

1

or at microscopic scale, the population starts to synchronize and converge to a collective

2

behavior and become more predictable as time progress or at macroscopic scale.

3
4

To further investigate the circuit’s capability in directing pattern formation at macroscopic

5

scale, we carried out long term experiment by culturing single cell initiated colonies on agar

6

plates up to 96 hours. Time-lapse colony imaging results show that the single colony has no

7

obvious pattern at 15 hr and exhibits a weak yellow flat disk, suggesting cells express either

8

GFP or mCherry are distributed without order (Fig. S2). This is consistent with our

9

microscopic observations. After 24 hr, cells in the colony started to differentially and

10

orderly express GFP and mCherry and self-organize into a stable double-ring pattern of an

11

outer GFP-ring and inner mCherry disk at 48 hr (Fig. 1E and S2), with a small temporary

12

yellow ring between these two rings (Fig. S2). The double-ring pattern is stable with time.

13

Fluorescence quantification also confirms higher GFP expression for cells on the edge of the

14

colony and higher mCherry expression for cells in the center (Fig. 1F).

15
16

To rule out the possibility that circuit-independent factors such as nutrition or growth are

17

responsible for the pattern, we tested two control circuits: one with GFP and mCherry

18

expressed from constitutive promoters, and the other one with GFP and mCherry expressed

19

from hybrid promoters Plas/tet and Plux/lac. No obvious ring patterns were observed at 24

20

or 48 hrs (Fig. S3). Therefore, we conclude that MINPAC circuit is responsible for the self-

21

organized ring pattern in single colonies.

22
23

Toward a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the ring patterning process, we

24

next built a partial differential equation (PDE) model to mathematically describe the

25

production, regulation, transport, and diffusion of autoinducers C6 and C12. LuxI and LasI’s

26

expression in MINPAC governs the synthesis of C6 and C12, which can diffuse out of and

27

back into cells to further regulate the intrinsic transcriptional network MINPAC and

28

determine cells’ fate spatially. Thus, the extracellular C6 and C12 kinetics serve as a

29

predictive snapshot of the spatial pattern and could represent the differential expression of

30

mCherry and GFP, respectively (see Supplemental materials for more details). Fitted with

31

biologically feasible parameters, our model shows the two autoinducers harbor similar

32

dynamics to experimental fluorescence intensities across the colony and can reproduce

33

experimentally observed ring pattern in two-dimensional geometry (Fig. 1G). Such

6

1

corroboration between the RD-based PDE model and experimental results further verified

2

that observed ring pattern is the result of MINPAC regulated RD process.

19
20
21

To further investigate how MINPAC directs the generation of ring pattern, we carried out

22

deterministic analysis for the reaction term of the RD model (i.e. the ODE part). Time series

23

shows that MINPAC has an oscillating reaction part (Fig. S4A), suggesting the temporal

24

oscillation could drive an organized pattern formation across the expanding colony. From a

25

network topology point of view, MINPAC is composed of two topologically equivalent motifs

26

where a self-activating node activates the other node and it in turn inhibits the self-

27

activating node (Fig. 2A), each forming a robust positive-plus-negative oscillator topology

28

27–29.

29

oscillation, but little asymmetry between the two motifs would lead to a robust oscillation

30

(Fig. S5). Our model-comparison results show that oscillation from one-motif topology is, as

31

previously reported, highly dependent on the strength of its negative feedback (τ), which is

32

vital for cyclic gene expression27,30,31 (Fig. 2B). However, the two-motif MINPAC harbors a

33

greater robustness and amplitude against parameter perturbations to generate temporal

34

oscillation (Fig. 2C). Such robustness enhances the likelihood of observing our desired

35

phenotypic outputs from the synthetic gene circuit.

A fully symmetric MINPAC topology would rapidly go to stable steady states without

In our MINPAC circuit, promoter functionality tests show LacI is less efficient to inhibit

2

promoter Plux/lac (Fig. S1A) compared to tetR to Plas/tet (Fig. S1B), supporting that the

3

asymmetric MINPAC could maintain an oscillatory gene expression profile as the molecular

4

clock. Moreover, the autoinducers’ physical diffusion on the agar medium and colony

5

outward expansion (represented as one diffusion term in the PDE model) constitute the

6

propagating wavefront. Finally, the integration of clock and wavefront gates the engineered

7

bacterial cells into subgroups and segment spatially, generating periodic structures. This

8

reaction-diffusion based pattern formation is widely used to explain somitogenesis in

development 2,20,21.

10
11

One interesting phenomenon among vertebrate species is the variations of somite numbers,

12

which is determined by the axis growth and presomitic mesoderm lifetime during

13

embryogenesis 32,33. Analogously, we would expect multiple or even indefinite number of

14

stripes for a continuously growing colony (illustrated in Fig. 2D), and colonies with different

15

sizes would have different number of stripes when the oscillation frequency and colony-

16

expanding rates were constant across colonies. With our PDE model, we simulated the

17

temporal dynamics of C12 on the spatial scale and new peaks emerged periodically at the

18

wavefront (Fig. 2E, S4B). Experimentally, ring patterns with multiple stripes were also

19

observed sequentially by time lapse imaging of large colonies (Fig. 2F-G), as model

20

predicted. Collectively, these results suggest that the ring patterns we observed are the

21

outcomes of the spatiotemporal interaction of oscillatory dynamics owing to the network

22

topology and the movement stemming from the diffusion process.

23
24

However, even a macroscopic RD system could still be highly sensitive to initial conditions

25

due to the nonlinearity of the network interactions, evidenced by diverse patterns shown in

26

Fig. 3A, some colonies self-organize into a reversed double-ring pattern with GFP

27

accumulating in the inner ring and mCherry on the outer ring (top). A more complicated

28

pattern is also observed, in which two GFP rings alternating with two mCherry rings,

29

forming a multiple GFP-mCherry ring pattern (Fig. 2F and 3A, bottom). Given that these

30

different patterns emerge from the same MINPAC circuit operating in the same cells and

31

under the same conditions, we hypothesize that it is due to random variations of the initial

32

concentrations of intracellular proteins and autoinducers. To computationally test this

33

hypothesis, we tested various initial conditions of the PDE but kept all the parameters the

10

1

same. The model indeed reproduces the experimental patterns (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,

2

these differences of the patterns suggest the system is not at steady state and, instead, is

3

evolving towards the steady state. The initial condition determines the starting point of the

4

MINPAC system, which will go through a temporal “non-oscillating” spiral (blue line in Fig.

5

3C) and finally approach oscillation periods (starting from red curve in Fig. 3C).

6

Quantitative simulations show that the oscillatory system, with different initial points, could

7

require significantly different times, so called Poincare return time, to approach the first

8

stable limit cycle (Fig. 3D). Thus, the initial condition and resulting approach-time variances

9

lead to diverse patterns with different stripes (besides colony size). These results illustrate

10

that initial conditions play an important role in shaping the formation of biological patterns,

11

which is consistent with recent theoretical analysis

12

model consistency entices us to use this model to analyze and predict newly emerged

13

patterns under different contexts.

16,34.

Furthermore, the experiment-

14
15

To further examine the pattern’s controllability, we next sought to apply external inducers

16

to perturb the regulations of MINPAC and hence pattern formation. C6, when applied

17

externally, would promote GFP expression and also LasI and TetR production, which could

18

both activate and inhibit mCherry expression. So the net impact of C6 induction is nonlinear

19

and nontrivial. Using the PDE model to simulate C6 application, it is predicted that we can

20

expect a multiple GFP-mCherry ring pattern when MINPAC is induced with external C6 (Fig.

21

4A, top). Experimentally, we supplemented the medium with 1*10-8 M C6 and grow the

22

colony following the same protocol. Results show that the colony first formed an outer GFP

23

ring and a reddish yellow core at 24 hr, which became a red core at 60 hr (Fig. S6A).

24

Strikingly, two GFP rings emerged at 77 hr whereas mCherry mostly accumulated in the

25

center (Fig. 4B top, and Fig. S6A). Quantified fluorescence intensities also illustrate there are

26

four peaks for GFP and one significant peak for mCherry, which is in line with model

27

predictions (Fig. 4B). We noticed the inconsistent dynamics between predicted C6

28

concentrations and measured mCherry intensities, which is probably because of the slow

29

degradation rate of mCherry protein in living cells. Similarly, external C12 induction results

30

in two GFP rings with unbalanced intensities (Fig. S6B).

IPTG and aTc induction, on the other hand, can modulate the strength of mutual inhibition

7

in the circuit. IPTG counteracts LacI’s inhibition on Plux/lac, leading to more LasI expression

8

and intracellular C12 production. Simulating these changes by perturbing corresponding

9

parameters, the model predicts a target-like mCherry ring with an outer GFP ring pattern

10

(Fig. 4A, bottom), which is further verified by our experimental data (Fig. 4B, bottom). Time

11

course shows that cells in the inner side of the GFP ring started to express mCherry,

12

showing as a yellow ring, at ~60 hr and was stable till 124 hr (Fig. S6A). Inducer aTc’s

13

impacts are similarly predicted and experimentally confirmed (Fig. S6C). Taken together,

14

these results illustrated the controllability of the MINPAC circuit and its directed patterns

15

formation. It is noteworthy that these patterns generated in single colonies autonomously

16

without any predefined spatial cues and the regular structures are robust and stable once

17

formed.

18
19

Since the synthetic circuit directed cell-cell communication is established as a viable

20

strategy to generate RD-based and tunable patterns, we employ this method to study the

21

fundamental question of relationship between gene network topology and resulting

22

multicellular pattern. We first designed a perturbed MINPAC topology, where the

23

intercellular X-Y communication modules are replaced by intercellular auto-activations of X

24

and Y (Fig. 4C, top, specific experimental design can be found in Fig. S7). Although there is

25

still autoinducer diffusion, this circuit mitigates the interactions and dependency between X

26

and Y and would remarkably change the intrinsic dynamics. Both experimental observation

27

and model simulation showed no specific pattern but a reddish colony (Fig. 4C, top row).

28

Starting from this topology, we further removed the mutual inhibition module to construct

29

a circuit with two positive feedback motifs (Fig. 4C, middle row), reinforced by intercellular

30

activations. A yellow fluorescent colony with strong GFP and mCherry expression was

31

observed, which is consistent with the model analysis. Lastly, we engineered a sub-network

32

of MINPAC, where the mutual inhibition is removed but keeping the other regulatory edges

33

(Fig. 4C, bottom row). Interestingly, this mutual-activation topology drives a weak yellow

34

target-like ring pattern with low GFP and mCherry expression (Fig. 4C, bottom row).

Previous

demonstrated

that

mutual-activation

with

autoregulations is multistable, and harbors a big parameter space for low-low state 35,36. Our

3

model analysis also confirms the low-GFP and low-mCherry expression in this sub-network

4

(Fig. 4C, bottom row). Taken together, each control circuit with different topology has

5

different fluorescence patterns but none of them show the alternating ring patterns,

6

indicating that the multiple-ring pattern is unique to MINPAC circuit.

7
8

Biological pattern formation requires complex gene regulation networks and accurate cell-

9

cell coordination. Indeed, coordinated cell population behavior in response to self-regulated

10

morphogen kinetics is a common phenomenon in development

8,37,38.

Here, we present the

11

design and assembly of a synthetic gene network MINPAC, capable of directing engineered

12

single cells to form self-organized tunable patterns with multiple rings. The PDE model

13

simulations and experimental measurements strongly support that the observed ring

14

patterns are driven by a RD based oscillatory gene network with propagating wavefront, the

15

so-called clock and wavefront mechanism. It is noteworthy to point out that we used one

16

single PDE model to recapitulate and predict all the MINPAC-directed biological patterns.

17

Furthermore, we verified the close connections between gene network topology (circuit

18

architecture) and its induced spatial pattern formation.

19
20

MINPAC is a complete motif composed of intracellular transcriptional network and

21

intercellular communication modules, both of which cross-regulate each other to direct

22

spatial pattern formation involving the coordination of molecular gene expression, cellular

23

population response, and positional information interpretation. In this view, the MINPAC

24

represents a paradigm for future design of pattern-forming circuits. Moreover, similar

25

natural counterparts of MINPAC design can be found in the interaction networks of gap

26

genes for the anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila

27

provides a bottom-up synthetic biology approach to generate complex spatial patterns

28

arising from well-designed reaction-diffusion circuit motif, and integrates experimental

29

data with analytical framework across time and spatial scales to shed lights on the

30

molecular mechanisms of somitogenesis and biological pattern formation, which would

31

contribute to a better understanding of the natural developmental processes, and facilitate

32

the engineering of synthetic tissues in the future.
