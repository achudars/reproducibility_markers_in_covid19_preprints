Abstract Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein aggregation is associated with several

22

neurodegenerative disorders collectively referred to as synucleinopathies, including

23

Parkinson’s disease. We used protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to study α-syn

24

aggregation in brain homogenates of wild-type or transgenic mice expressing normal (D line)

25

or A53T mutant (M83 line) human α-syn. We found that sonication-incubation cycles of M83

26

mouse brain gradually produce large quantities of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates, involving

27

both human and mouse proteins. These PMCA products, containing partially proteinase K

28

resistant α-syn species, are competent to accelerate the onset of neurological symptoms after

29

intracerebral inoculation to young M83 mice and to seed aggregate formation of α-syn

30

following PMCA, including in D and wild-type mouse brain substrates. Our data indicate that

31

similar to prions, PMCA can reproduce some characteristics of α-syn aggregation and seeded-

32

propagation in vitro in a complex milieu. This opens new opportunities for the molecular

33

study of synucleinopathies.

Introduction

38

Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a neuronal protein critically involved in a group of human

39

neurodegenerative diseases, called synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD),

40

dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). These diseases are

41

characterized by α-syn intracellular inclusions, in neurons in PD and DLB, presenting as

42

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, or in oligodendrocytes in MSA, presenting as glial

43

cytoplasmic inclusions. Most cases of these diseases are considered as sporadic, but some

44

cases can be genetically triggered by duplication or triplication of the α-syn encoding SNCA

45

gene, leading to constitutive overexpression of the protein, or by mutations in the N-terminal

46

region of the protein, which favor its oligomerization and aggregation (A30P, E46K or A53T

47

for instance)(Lazaro et al., 2014). Evidence of somatic SNCA gains in brain, more commonly

48

in nigral dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson’s disease than in controls, and possibly

49

commonest in some multiple system atrophy cases, was also recently described, suggesting

50

that this may be a risk factor for sporadic synucleinopathies, or alternatively a result of the

51

disease process (Mokretar et al., 2018).

52

The detailed molecular pathways leading to α-syn aggregation still remain poorly

53

understood. However, a primary event leading to α-syn oligomers would involve α-syn self-

54

interactions in a rate-limiting step of α-syn dimers formation (Krishnan et al., 2003; Roostaee

55

et al., 2013). The initiation and amplification steps of α-syn aggregation can be dramatically

56

changed by mutations associated with familial forms of PD (Flagmeier et al., 2016), and the

57

dimer formation was notably shown to be accelerated by the A30P and A53T mutations

58

(Krishnan et al., 2003).

59

The pathogenesis of synucleinopathies is characterized by a progressive spreading of α-

60

syn lesions in the patient body, and a number of recent studies suggested that it could involve

61

molecular mechanisms similar to those occurring in prion diseases (for a recent review Steiner

62

et al., , 2018)). In this paradigm, pathological α-syn (α-synP) species act as seeds that self-

63

propagate at the expense of the normal protein and spread through interconnected brain

64

regions. Previously, we and others have used a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the

65

human mutated A53T α-syn on a non-knockout mouse α-syn background (called M83)

66

(Giasson et al., 2002) to show that a synucleinopathy can be experimentally accelerated in

67

vivo following inoculation of both M83+/+ and M83+/- young mice with pathological α-syn

68

assemblies of different origin (from old M83 mice, humans with MSA or recombinant fibrils)

69

and inoculated via different routes, including intracerebral and peripheral (intramuscular,

70

intra-peritoneal, intrasciatic) routes (Ayers et al., 2017; Ayers et al., 2018; Breid et al., 2016;

71

Luk et al., 2012; Mougenot et al., 2012; Prusiner et al., 2015; Rutherford et al., 2017; Sacino

72

et al., 2014a; Sacino et al., 2014b; Sargent et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2013; Woerman et al.,

73

2018).

74

We recently showed that the spreading of pathological α-syn in the M83 mouse brain

75

can be monitored using an ELISA test, which specifically recognizes α-synP in some brain

76

regions (mainly brain stem and midbrain), and in the spinal cords of sick M83 mice, which

77

are characterized by neuronal α-syn inclusions (Betemps et al., 2014; Giasson et al., 2002;

78

Sargent et al., 2017). The precise molecular species recognized by this ELISA test remain to

79

be determined, but immunoreactivity is observed with antibodies against epitopes in the C- or,

80

to a lesser extent, N-terminal ends of the protein that are known to represent less structured

81

regions of the protein compared to the central region, which is involved in the formation of β-

82

sheet structural motifs in amyloid fibrils (Riek & Eisenberg, 2016).

83

Protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) provides faithful replication of

84

mammalian prions in vitro. Presumably because it operates in a crude brain milieu containing

85

potential cellular co-factors necessary for prions to multiply, PMCA has the unique ability to

86

generate bona fide infectious prions (Castilla et al., 2005). The method, conceptually based on

87

the nucleation-dependent polymerization model of prion replication, allows conversion of the

88

cellular prion protein from a normal brain substrate into an aggregated form, using repeated

89

cycles of sonication and incubation, after seeding with a small quantity of a sample containing

90

the pathological prion protein (Saborio et al., 2001). In the last few years, our laboratory has

91

developed a highly efficient PMCA methodology, which allowed for the first time the

92

preclinical detection of prions in the plasma of patients incubating variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob

93

disease (Bougard et al., 2016).

94

Regarding the α-syn protein, the use of PMCA has been reported on α-syn of

95

recombinant origin (Fairfoul et al., 2016; Herva et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2017; Roostaee et al.,

96

2013; Shahnawaz et al., 2017) but not to our knowledge on brain α-syn (Paciotti et al., 2018).

97

In this study we developed α-syn PMCA in mouse brain homogenates, including M83

98

(Giasson et al., 2002) and D (Masliah et al., 2000) transgenic mice expressing A53T-mutant

99

and wild-type human α-syn respectively, as well as C57Bl/6 wild-type mice. We demonstrate

100

for the first time the in vitro generation and seeded-propagation of α-syn aggregates in mouse

101

brain tissue, with subsequent transmission of an experimental synucleinopathy in M83 mice

102

by intracerebral inoculation.

Results

105

To determine the effects of PMCA on the α-syn protein in mouse brain, we prepared brain

106

homogenates (10% wt/vol) in conversion buffer from different mouse lines, including: (i)

107

M83 mice expressing A53T-mutated human α-syn (homozygous (M83+/+) or hemizygous

108

(M83+/-) for the transgene), (ii) D (+/+) mice expressing human wild-type α-syn, (iii) C57Bl/6

109

wild-type mice (C57Bl/6-WT) and (iv) C57Bl/6 mice presenting a deletion of the α-syn gene

110

(C57Bl/6-KO) (Specht & Schoepfer, 2001). These brain homogenates were then submitted to

111

a 72h (144 cycles) PMCA procedure using a microplate sonicator (Figure 1A). In the

112

meantime, the same brain homogenates were either only incubated at 37°C (“standing”

113

condition) or under constant shaking at 1000 rpm (“shaking” condition). Unexpectedly, after

114

144 cycles of sonication-incubation, we observed the abundant formation of, at least partially,

115

SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates, specifically in brain homogenates from M83 mice, as shown

116

by Western blot detection using the C-20R antibody (Figure 1A). This showed bands

117

consistent with α-syn dimers and trimers, as well as higher molecular weight species, some of

118

which were retained in the stacking of the gels. By contrast, a single band corresponding to

119

monomeric α-syn was detected in D or C57Bl/6-WT mouse brains following the same PMCA

120

procedure. The “de novo” aggregation of α-syn from M83 brain required the sonication

121

process, as only monomeric α-syn was detected in the standing and shaking conditions and in

122

the initial “frozen” brain samples (Figure 1A). The sonication-induced formation of α-syn

123

aggregates was enhanced by increased α-syn levels, as shown by comparisons of brain

124

homogenates from M83+/+ and M83+/- mice, as well as of 10% versus 5% wt/vol

125

concentrations (Figure 1B). This also showed an increase of α-syn aggregation with

126

increasing numbers of cycles of sonication-incubation and this required the addition of Teflon

127

beads into the test tube (data not shown). We did not observe α-syn aggregation from M83+/-

128

5% wt/vol homogenates after up to 96 cycles of sonication-incubation, which enabled us to

129

apply these experimental conditions in the following experiments when using the M83+/-

130

mouse brain as a substrate in seeding experiments. Using an antibody specifically recognizing

131

β-synuclein did not reveal any aggregation of this protein in the four mouse brain substrates

132

following PMCA (Figure 1C). To further characterize α-syn species in the PMCA products,

133

we performed limited in vitro proteolysis of the samples using proteinase K (PK) digestion

134

(Figure 2). After PMCA, α-syn from M83+/- brain resists PK treatment at up to 5 µg/ml for 30

135

min, whereas without PMCA it is fully degraded even at a 0.5 µg/ml PK concentration. In D

136

and C57Bl/6-WT brain homogenates, either before or after PMCA, α-syn is similarly fully

137

degraded at 0.5 µg/ml PK concentration. Thus, repeated cycles of sonication-incubation

138

specifically induce the formation of partially PK-resistant α-syn aggregates in M83 mouse

139

brain.

140

We next investigated whether the de novo PMCA-generated α-syn aggregates from M83

141

mice would act as seeds for the aggregation of α-syn when introduced in PMCA reactions

142

(Figure 3). To test this hypothesis, we serially diluted 10-fold (from 10-3 to 10-6) a 144 cycle

143

PMCA product from M83+/- mice harboring abundant α-syn aggregates. These dilutions were

144

then used to seed M83+/-, D, C57Bl/6-WT and C57Bl/6-KO brain substrates and the resulting

145

mixtures were subjected to PMCA. As shown in the C57Bl/6-KO substrate, α-syn aggregates

146

attributable to the seed were detected in the 10-3 and to a lesser extent in the 10-4 dilutions

147

after PMCA. However, in all other substrates, abundant α-syn aggregates were still detected at

148

the 10-6 dilution, whereas no signal was observed in unseeded PMCA reactions (NBH lanes)

149

or in control PMCA reactions seeded with a 10-3 dilution from a M83+/+ brain that was not

150

previously subjected to PMCA (CTL lanes) (Figure 3A,B). To rule out the possibility that

151

this seeding effect could be attributable to other factors than aggregated α-syn itself, some of

152

which could have been generated during the process of sonication-incubation of brain

153

homogenates to generate the seed, we similarly seeded PMCA reactions with the products of

154

144 PMCA cycles from D, C57Bl/6-WT or C57Bl/6-KO brain substrates that were previously

155

shown to be free of detectable α-syn aggregates. We were unable to detect any α-syn

156

aggregation in M83+/- substrate following PMCA after seeding with these samples (data not

157

shown). Altogether, these experiments clearly showed that the addition of α-syn aggregates

158

produced by PMCA from M83 brain was able to seed α-syn aggregation, including in D and

159

C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates, which otherwise do not show detectable de novo α-syn

160

aggregation in the absence of seeding. Next, we examined the PMCA samples using an

161

ELISA test, as previously described for the specific identification of the pathological α-syn in

162

sick M83 mice (Betemps et al., 2014; Sargent et al., 2017), using the same C-20R antibody

163

for α-syn detection (Figure 3C,D). Overall, we found a good correlation between ELISA and

164

Western blot results consistent with the detection of PMCA-generated α-syn aggregates.

165

These results emphasize the fact that this ELISA test likely identifies at least in part

166

aggregated α-syn species in the mouse brain, offering an additional and convenient method

167

for measuring α-syn aggregates in a PMCA sample.

168

To examine the respective contributions of human and mouse α-syn proteins in the

169

formation of the α-syn aggregates after seeding with de novo M83 PMCA products, we

170

performed Western blot analyses using antibodies specific to either human (MJFR1) or mouse

171

(D37A6) α-syn (Figure 4A-C). We found a major difference in the composition of α-syn

172

aggregates in D and M83+/- substrates. In D substrate, detection of human α-syn with the

173

MJFR1 antibody showed a strong labeling for the α-syn monomer, whereas α-syn dimers and

174

trimers were labeled as in C57Bl/6-KO and C57Bl/6-WT substrate, which correspond to the

175

human α-syn seed input from M83 mice. Using the D37A6 antibody against mouse α-syn

176

showed similar results in C57Bl/6-WT and D substrates, whereas no signal was detected in

177

C57Bl/6-KO brain substrate. The reverse situation was observed in the M83+/- substrate, in

178

which both human α-syn aggregates and monomers were strongly labeled by the MJFR1

179

antibody, whereas, unexpectedly, mouse α-syn detection with D37A6 was very low in

180

comparison to C57Bl/6-WT and D substrates, including for the mouse α-syn monomer.

181

Because similar amounts of mouse α-syn monomer were detected with D37A6 in M83+/-, D

182

and C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates before PMCA (data not shown), this points to a strong

183

effect of PMCA on this decreased detection of mouse α-syn in these Western blot conditions,

184

specifically in the M83 brain substrate. These samples were also examined by ELISA with α-

185

syn detection using MJFR1, D37A6 or C-20R antibodies (Figure 4D). The results showed

186

that the human protein is recognized much better from the M83 than from the D brain

187

substrate, although increased immunoreactivity is clearly detected in the D substrate (but only

188

after seeding); in contrast, the levels of mouse α-syn species recognized by D37A6 are

189

roughly comparable in the three brain substrates (M83, D and C57Bl/6-WT), including in the

190

M83 samples that show decreased detection in Western blot after the PMCA reaction.

191

Immunoreactivity is extremely low in samples that do not show α-syn aggregates by Western

192

blot (NBH). Altogether, these data suggest a higher aggregation of human α-syn in the M83

193

brain substrate compared to the D brain substrate and a similar aggregation of mouse α-syn in

194

M83, D or C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates.

195

Having shown that PMCA can propagate α-syn aggregation after in vitro seeding of

196

mouse brain substrates, including that of C57Bl/6-WT mice, we examined the seeding

197

capacities of M83 mouse brain following development of the characteristic M83 clinical

198

disease. Serial 10-fold dilutions of a 10% whole brain homogenate were prepared from a sick

199

M83+/+ mouse at the terminal stage of the disease before seeding in the different substrates

200

(M83+/-, D, C57Bl/6-WT and C57Bl/6-KO) (Figure 5A). Following PMCA, SDS-resistant α-

201

syn dimers and trimers were detected by Western blot in all substrates except for the C57Bl/6-

202

KO control, which shows that these α-syn species are derived from the substrate and not from

203

the seed. However, compared to previous experiments using a de novo PMCA-generated seed

204

from M83+/- substrate, the detection sensitivity achieved with this endogenous seed from sick

205

M83 brain was lower. To increase the detection limit, we performed an additional PMCA

206

round in the non-transgenic C57Bl/6-WT substrate, a procedure generally used in PMCA

207

studies for prions that can achieve a very high level of sensitivity. Aliquots of each dilution

208

from the first PMCA round were mixed with fresh substrate and submitted to a new PMCA

209

round. As shown in Figure 5B, we could detect a seeding activity up to the 10-4 and 10-6

210

dilutions at the first and second PMCA round respectively from a sick M83+/+ mouse brain

211

homogenate. Importantly, no α-syn aggregates were detected after two PMCA rounds of 144

212

cycles in either the unseeded C57Bl/6-WT brain substrate (Figure 5B) or in the C57Bl/6-KO

213

brain substrate seeded by M83 brain tissue (data not shown).

214

We next tested the capacity of this PMCA assay to distinguish between healthy and sick

215

M83 mice in a panel of samples from healthy (uninoculated ≤ 180 days old) (n=13) or sick

216

(n=9) M83+/+ mice. The different origins, clinical and pathological status and ages of these

217

mice are summarized in Table 1. These experiments, performed from whole brain

218

homogenates at dilutions 10-3 and 10-4 and using M83+/- or C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates,

219

readily discriminated sick and healthy M83 mice (Table 1 and Figure 6A,B). All the brains of

220

the sick mice were shown to contain high levels of Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn by ELISA

221

(Figure 6C). From unchallenged and healthy M83 mice below the age of 6 months, no α-syn

222

aggregates were observed after a single PMCA round on either brain substrate; however,

223

some of these samples (from mice 110-146 days old) showed a seeding activity which was

224

identified by a second PMCA round performed with the C57Bl/6-WT brain substrate (Table 1

225

and Figure 6A). Very low levels of immunoreactivity were detected by ELISA with the

226

antibody against Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn, in some of these mice and at the lower

227

dilution tested (Figure 6C).

228

Because α-syn neuropathology is much more pronounced in the caudal brain regions

229

(brain stem and midbrain) of sick M83 mice, we compared the PMCA seeding activities in

230

different brain regions of two M83 mice at the terminal stage of the disease (573 or 670 days

231

old)(Figure 7A). The highest PMCA seeding activities were detected in the brain stem and

232

midbrain of these mice. Intermediate results were obtained in the cerebral cortex, striatum and

233

cerebellum, whereas the lowest seeding activities were found in the hippocampus and

234

olfactory bulb, although α-syn aggregates could be detected after two PMCA rounds at the

235

10-3 dilution in these regions (data not shown). These PMCA results are in good agreement

236

with the results of direct detection of Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn by ELISA in these same

237

brain regions, as illustrated in Figure 7B. Thus, we found a positive correlation between the

238

known degree of α-syn neuropathology and the PMCA seeding activity in different regions of

239

the brain of sick M83 mice.

240

We finally addressed the question as to whether the PMCA products can seed α-syn

241

pathology in vivo. For this, young M83+/+ mice were inoculated intracerebrally with samples

242

obtained after a procedure involving 144 PMCA cycles in the M83+/+, M83+/- or C57Bl/6-KO

243

(2 months old) brain substrates. As additional controls, we inoculated the M83+/+ mouse brain

244

substrate without sonication (i.e. standing or shaking conditions). Individual survival data

245

during a one-year follow up after stereotaxic intracerebral challenge are shown in Figure 8. In

246

M83 mice, the disease was strikingly accelerated by the inoculation of the sonicated M83 (+/+

247

or

248

(Giasson et al., 2002; Sargent et al., 2017), before the age of 6 months. The disease was

249

confirmed by ELISA analysis showing detection of Ser129 phosphorylated pathological α-

250

syn in the spinal cords of these mice, as previously described (Betemps et al., 2014; Sargent et

251

al., 2017). In contrast, the inocula prepared from M83 brain in shaking or in standing

252

conditions, or from sonicated C57Bl/6-KO brain homogenate, failed to accelerate the disease

253

in M83 mice, which only began to develop the disease after the age of 9 months, as has been

254

described for this model (Giasson et al., 2002; Mougenot et al., 2012). Thus, the M83-derived

255

PMCA samples that contained α-syn aggregates strikingly accelerated the M83 disease, as

Discussion

260

During the last decade, studies in cellular and animal experimental models have suggested

261

that prion-like behavior of α-syn is involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies (Ayers

262

et al., 2018; Betemps et al., 2014; Luk et al., 2012; Luk et al., 2009; Mougenot et al., 2012;

263

Prusiner et al., 2015). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the sonication-based

264

version of the PMCA technology, developed by Claudio Soto’s group in the early 2000s for

265

the sensitive amplification of the prion protein aggregation (Saborio et al., 2001), could be

266

used to study α-syn prion-like properties. This PMCA version operates in a crude brain milieu

267

containing all potential cellular cofactors that may be involved in the α-syn aggregation

268

process in vivo. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, the in vitro generation and seeded-

269

propagation of α-syn aggregates in a biological complex matrix of brain homogenate.

270

Furthermore, this is the first report showing efficient PMCA in a brain substrate of a protein

271

distinct from the prion protein. This key finding thus adds to the growing list of arguments

272

supporting the idea that α-syn can act in the same way as a prion. Furthermore, our bioassay

273

experiments revealed that the PMCA-generated α-syn aggregates were biologically competent

274

to seed α-syn neuropathology in vivo.

275

Our study first revealed that repetition of PMCA sonication-incubation cycles provokes

276

the spontaneous formation of partially PK-resistant α-syn aggregates in the M83 mouse brain

277

substrate, identified by Western blotting in denaturing conditions. This de novo α-syn

278

aggregation was not observed in the other D or C57Bl/6-WT substrates in our experimental

279

conditions, suggesting the involvement of mutant human α-syn expressed by M83 mice.

280

Consistently, PMCA α-syn aggregation kinetics in the M83 substrate were correlated to the

281

amount of A53T-mutated human protein, as evidenced by the comparisons of M83+/+ and

282

M83+/- substrates. We confirmed the crucial effects of sonication in this phenomenon as we

283

could not observe any α-syn aggregation in control experiments where M83 substrates were

284

maintained at 37°C, with or without vigorous shaking. It is known that, compared to its wild-

285

type counterpart, human mutated A53T α-syn has an intrinsic tendency to aggregation

286

(Flagmeier et al., 2016). Thus conceivably, de novo α-syn aggregation in the M83 substrate

287

triggered by sonication-incubation cycles is favored by A53T-mutant human α-syn, similarly

288

to what is observed naturally in this mouse model during aging of the animals, but here in a

289

strongly accelerated manner and in a test tube.

290

Strikingly, we next demonstrate a PMCA seed-dependent aggregation of the

291

endogenous mouse α-syn in both D and C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates. This seed-induced α-

292

syn aggregation was obtained with seeds either generated de novo after PMCA of M83 brain,

293

or derived from the brain of sick M83 mice. These results thus illustrate that PMCA allowed

294

α-syn aggregates from M83 mice to replicate in C57Bl/6-WT mouse brain by crossing a

295

transmission barrier between α-syn of different sequences in brain tissue. Immunoblot

296

analysis using antibodies against human or mouse α-syn showed a preferential aggregation of

297

human α-syn in the M83 brain substrate after PMCA, whereas human α-syn was poorly

298

aggregated in the D brain substrate. Mouse α-syn however showed strong aggregation in the

299

D and C57Bl/6-WT brain substrates after seeding with aggregated α-syn from M83 brain.

300

One explanation for the preferential aggregation of mouse α-syn over human α-syn in the D

301

substrate would be that mouse α-syn has a threonine residue at position 53, making it a more

302

aggregation-prone substrate, similar to mutations in familial Parkinson’s disease. An in vitro

303

study examining why the aggregation of human α-syn was remarkably much slower than that

304

of mouse α-syn indeed suggested that the presence of the A53 sequence in humans was

305

crucial and could even represent an evolutionary adaptation to minimize risk of Parkinson’s

306

disease (Kang et al., 2011).

307

Our observations of α-syn aggregation after a sonication-based PMCA procedure are

308

not unprecedented (Fairfoul et al., 2016; Herva et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2017; Paciotti et al.,

309

2018; Shahnawaz et al., 2017). Notwithstanding, recombinant α-syn diluted in saline solution

310

was constantly used as a PMCA substrate in those previous PMCA studies, and α-syn

311

aggregation was generally monitored using thioflavine-T fluorescence. A recent study

312

however used Western blot detection and interestingly reported efficient seeding of PMCA

313

reactions with brain or spinal cord extracts from two other transgenic mouse models

314

expressing A53T mutant human α-syn (Jung et al., 2017), concurring with our current

315

observations of a PMCA seeding activity in brain extracts of M83 mice. Our study also shows

316

that this PMCA-induced α-syn aggregation could be easily monitored and quantified using an

317

ELISA test that we previously described for the specific detection of pathological α-syn in

318

M83 mice (Betemps et al., 2014; Sargent et al., 2017). Whereas ELISA immunoreactivity was

319

overall found to be linked to the presence of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates identified by

320

Western blot in the PMCA samples, this was similarly found from C57Bl/6-WT brain, but

321

only after seeding with seeds containing aggregated α-syn from M83 mice. This seeding was

322

also required to identify SDS-resistant species by Western blot from C57Bl/6-WT brain

323

substrate.

324

The precise nature of the M83-associated PMCA seeding activity in our experiments

325

remains uncertain, but some lines of evidence suggest it is associated with the presence of α-

326

syn aggregates. We consistently detected robust seeding activity in brains of sick M83 mice

327

compared to healthy M83 mice. Importantly, this was equally seen in spontaneous versus

328

accelerated illness of M83 mice, arguing against an age-dependent effect of brain material on

329

PMCA seeding activity. Finally, we observed that PMCA seeding activity within the same

330

M83 brain is higher in regions mostly targeted by the α-syn pathology in this model.

331

Using serial PMCA rounds to increase our assay sensitivity led to the preclinical

332

detection of α-syn seeding activity in some of the healthy (< 6 months old) M83 mouse brains

333

analyzed. At these ages, our previous immunohistochemistry studies only showed

334

cytoplasmic labelling of Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn in enteric neurons, but not in the brain

335

(Bencsik et al., 2014). α-syn inclusions start to accumulate late in the M83 model, in which

336

mice ultimately develop a clinical disease at very variable ages (Emmer et al., 2011; Giasson

337

et al., 2002). In future studies it will be possible to examine the evolution of α-syn seeding

338

activity at preclinical stages during the disease progression in M83 mice. It has been reported

339

that all brain regions of M83 mice, including histologically unaffected regions, contained

340

equivalent amounts of detergent-soluble SDS-resistant oligomers that delayed the formation

341

of α-syn fibrils after seeding in vitro recombinant α-syn, contrary to oligomers derived from

342

histologically affected brain regions (Tsika et al., 2010). This study also suggested that

343

oligomers are formed at 4–6 months, before the formation of α-syn inclusions and onset of

344

symptoms, consistent with the finding of a seeding activity in the brain of some of the healthy

345

3.5-5 month-old M83 mice in our study.

346

The bioassays for PMCA samples described here support the idea that de novo

347

aggregated α-syn was a major contributor in the acceleration of the M83 disease after

348

intracerebral inoculation. In control bioassays, we used inocula prepared from M83+/+ young

349

brain substrate in standing and shaking conditions, as well as from PMCA-sonicated C57Bl/6-

350

KO mice brain substrate. We found no evidence of disease acceleration after intracerebral

351

inoculation of these samples to young M83+/+ mice. In contrast, mice inoculated with PMCA-

352

sonicated M83 samples containing de novo α-syn aggregates developed characteristic clinical

353

signs of experimental synucleinopathy after incubation periods of <120 days, which was

354

accompanied by accumulation of pathological α-syn within the brain. This prion-like

355

acceleration of M83 disease was thus as efficient as previously described following

356

intracerebral inoculations of brain homogenates from sick M83 mice or aggregated

357

recombinant α-syn (Betemps et al., 2014; Luk et al., 2012; Mougenot et al., 2012).

358

Interestingly, PMCA samples from hemizygous M83 mice also led to efficient transmission

359

despite the fact that these mice are largely resistant to the development of spontaneous illness

360

during normal aging in the absence of any additional challenge (Giasson et al., 2002; Prusiner

361

et al., 2015). Also of note, α-syn from PMCA-sonicated M83 inocula was partially resistant to

362

PK digestion, reminding the tight association of protease resistance with infectivity which is

363

well known for the prion protein during prion diseases. Our bioassays of α-syn PMCA

364

products were however limited to the examination of sonicated and unseeded brain

365

homogenates in M83 mice. Whether these PMCA products can also transmit α-syn pathology

366

to other hosts, including after seeded PMCA adaptation in different brain substrates, remains

367

to be established.

368

The molecular events underlying the efficiency of PMCA are still uncertain. Since its

369

initial description in 2001, the PMCA technology has been constantly evolving.

370

Reproducibility and amplification performances of the technique have benefited considerably

371

from a number of key modifications, including notably the addition of beads or polyanionic

372

co-factors in PMCA reactions (Gonzalez-Montalban et al., 2011). In the present study, we

373

similarly observed that Teflon beads strongly promote PMCA α-syn aggregation. It is

374

generally believed that, through strong agitation, the sonication process fragments the

375

growing polymers into smaller pieces, exposing more “free ends” of misfolded prion protein.

376

Sonication also produces very high local temperature and pressure and involves a cavitation

377

process, a repeated expansion and collapse of microbubbles splitting entrapped gaseous water

378

molecules (sonolysis), resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and

379

O2- causing protein oxidation (Haigh & Drew, 2015). Sonication was already shown to

380

promote formation of amyloid aggregates of a variety of structurally diverse proteins, with

381

high stability against solubilization upon treatment by heat, detergent or reducing agent, and

382

with the ability to further seed the aggregation of soluble protein (Stathopulos et al., 2004).

383

Regarding α-syn specifically, its ultrasonication-induced fibrillation was reported some years

384

ago using recombinant α-syn (Kim et al., 2007), and it was shown that after additional

385

extensive ultrasonication in the absence of monomeric α-syn, the resulting fragments could

386

serve as nucleation centers for the subsequent seed-dependent accelerated fibrillation under a

387

quiescent incubation condition (Kim et al., 2007).

388

In conclusion, we have shown that a sonication-based PMCA procedure can be used as

389

a new in vitro model of α-syn aggregation and seeded-propagation in a brain tissue matrix

390

(Figure 9). A practical benefit of this system is the possibility to generate high amounts of

391

brain-derived aggregated α-syn rapidly, and more generally, PMCA may offer unique

392

opportunities of research, as in the field of prion diseases. A number of recent studies

393

emphasized that a non-sonicated version of PMCA (called RT-QuIC) was promising for the

394

diagnosis of synucleinopathies in humans (Fairfoul et al., 2016; Paciotti et al., 2018;

395

Shahnawaz et al., 2017). The sonication-based PMCA approach for synucleinopathies in brain

396

substrates may now help in deciphering the molecular basis of α-syn aggregation in a

397

physiologically relevant environment, including the assessment of aggregation-inhibitory

398

molecules with potential therapeutic applications (Ferreira & Caughey, 2018) or more

399

basically, to better understand major unresolved questions in the field such as the possible

400

existence of α-syn “strains” (Peelaerts et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2018; Prusiner et al., 2015;

401

Watts et al., 2013).

Materials and Methods

405
406

Brain samples

407

PMCA substrates were prepared by homogenization of whole brains using a mechanical

408

homogenizer (grinding balls, Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux,

409

France) to obtain a 5 to 10% homogenate (w/v) in converting buffer (PBS pH=7,2, 150 mM

410

NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail). They were prepared from 2-month-

411

old i) transgenic mice bred in our laboratory, overexpressing either the human A53T mutated

412

α-syn under the prion promoter (M83 line)(Giasson et al., 2002) or the normal human α-syn

413

under the PDGF-β promoter (D line)(Masliah et al., 2000) and ii) C57Bl/6 mice expressing

414

(C57Bl/6-WT) or not (C57Bl/6-KO) mouse α-syn purchased from Janvier labs (Saint-

415

Berthevin, France) and Envigo (Gannat, France) respectively (Specht & Schoepfer, 2001).

416

M83 brain substrates were derived from homozygous (+/+) or hemizygous (+/-) mice

417

obtained after breeding M83 homozygous mice with Bl/6;C3H mice, corresponding to the

418

genetic background of the M83 mouse line (Giasson et al., 2002). In some experiments, brain

419

homogenates obtained in High Salt Buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7,5, 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM

420

EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails) were used as seeds in

421

PMCA reactions. These seeds were prepared from whole brains of healthy (≤ 6-month-old) or

422

sick M83 mice, or from dissected brain regions. Sick M83 mice had developed the typical

423

M83 disease either after normal aging (≥1 year old)(n=3) or after intracerebral inoculations of

424

brain homogenates from sick M83 mice or of fibrillar recombinant α-syn (Bousset et al.,

425

2013), as previously described (Betemps et al., 2014). In one experiment PMCA was

426

performed using seeds prepared from dissected brain regions of sick M83 mice, as previously

427

described (Betemps et al., 2015).

429

Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA)

430

PMCA procedure was previously described (Bougard et al., 2016). Briefly, 100µl of brain

431

homogenates from healthy mice (M83+/+, M83+/-, D, C57Bl/6-WT and C57Bl/6-KO) were

432

used directly in PMCA reactions at 5% or 10% in comparison with shaking (1000 rpm at

433

37°C) and standing at 37°C. The same brain homogenates were also used as substrate either at

434

5% (M83+/-) or 10% (D, C57Bl/6-WT and C57Bl/6-KO) after mixing with 10µL of serially

435

diluted brain homogenates (from 10-3 to 10-6) used as seeds. PMCA reactions were performed

436

in PCR tubes containing three Teflon beads and submitted to amplification in a microplate

437

sonicator (Q700; Qsonica). Each cycle is composed of an incubation step (29 min 40 s at

438

37°C) and a sonication step (20 s at 140 W) for cycles ranging from 48 to 144 (1 round). For

439

serial PMCA, amplified materials were diluted 1:10 in fresh PMCA substrate and submitted

440

to a new PMCA round. To avoid any cross-contamination, experiments were carried out

441

under strict quality-controlled PCR conditions.

442
443

Western blot

444

PMCA samples (10 µl) were mixed with 2 µl of TD4215 denaturing buffer (final

445

concentration: 4% SDS, 2% β mercaptoethanol, 192 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 5% sucrose).

446

Proteins were separated after heat denaturation (5 min at 100°C) on 12% TGX Stain Free

447

FastCast acrylamide gels (#1610185, Biorad) loaded with 2 µl of the denatured PMCA

448

samples per lane, then blotted onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After

449

migration, gels were activated for 1 min on Chemidoc MP apparatus (BioRad) and image

450

analysis was done using ImageLab software (BioRad), to control the protein loads per lane

451

(data not shown). α-syn was cross-linked to membranes using 0,4% paraformaldehyde diluted

452

in PBS for 30 minutes and unspecific binding sites were saturated by adding 5% milk for 1 h.

453

α-syn was detected by either C-20R (1:10 000)(Cat #sc-7011-R Santa Cruz Biotechnology)

454

rabbit polyclonal antibody, MJFR1 (1:1000) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cat #ab138501,

455

Abcam) or D37A6 (1:1000) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cat #4179, Cell Signaling

456

technology), diluted in PBST overnight at +4°C. Membranes were then incubated with

457

stabilized goat anti rabbit HRP (1:1000) (Cat #32460, Interchim), incubated for 1 h at room

458

temperature. HRP was then visualized with chemiluminescent substrate (Cat #34076,

459

Supersignal WestDura, Thermo) and analyzed using the ChemiDoc system and ImageLab

460

software (Bio-Rad). For some experiments, we performed pK digestion on PMCA samples,

461

with pK concentration from 0,5 to 10 µg/ml (final concentration). In the same manner, prior

462

to migration on 12% TGX Stain Free FastCast acrylamide gels (#1610185, Biorad), PMCA

463

digested products were mixed with 2 µl of TD4215 denaturing buffer.

464
465

ELISA

466

For the analyses of the PMCA samples, 200 µl of Superblock T20 (Thermo Scientific,

467

Rockford, IL, USA) were loaded in each well of MaxiSorp™ plates (Thermo Scientific Nunc,

468

Roskilde, Denmark) for 1 h at 25°C, under agitation at 150 rpm. After rinsing 5 times with

469

PBST, the PMCA samples (2 µl per well, adjusted to 100 µl in PBST + 1% BSA) were then

470

loaded and incubated for 2 h at 25°C, under agitation at 150 rpm. The plates were washed 5

471

times with PBST and primary antibodies C-20R (1:10 000) / MJFR1 (1:1000) / D37A6

472

(1:1000) in PBST + 1% BSA (Cat #15260037, Gibco, Thermo Fisher) were then incubated

473

for 1 h at 25°C under agitation at 150rpm. The plates were washed another 5 times with

474

PBST, and anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate (Cat #4010-05, Southern Biotech) was added

(1:2000 dilution) in PBST + 1% BSA for 1h at 25°C. After washing the plates 5 times with

476

PBST, 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Cat #T0440, Sigma) were added to

477

each well and plates were incubated for 15 min with shaking. The enzymatic reaction was

478

stopped by adding 100 µl of HCl 1M. Optical densities (ODs) were read at 450 nm by a

479

microplate reader (CLARIOstar, BMG Labtech). OD values of blank wells, performed in

480

parallel but without adding brain homogenates, were subtracted from OD values for each

481

well. Following bioassays, the disease of M83 mice was confirmed by ELISA detection of

482

Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn as previously described (Sargent et al., 2017), after α-syn

483

capture with Syn303 antibody (1µg/ml)(Cat# 824301, BioLegend, Ozyme, St-Quentin-en-

484

Yvelines, France) and detection with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against PSer129 α-syn

485

(1/3000)(Cat# ab59264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

486
487

Bioassays

488

Bioassays were performed by stereotactic injection into the left striatum (anteroposterior

489

(AP): +0.14, mediolateral (ML): +2, dorsoventral (DV): - 2.75) of 2 µl of inoculum in 2

490

month-old M83+/+ mice. When such M83 mice are not inoculated, they develop characteristic

491

motor symptoms between 8 and 16 months of life, beginning with reduced ambulation,

492

balance disorders, partial paralysis of a hind leg and then progressing to prostration, difficulty

493

in feeding, weight loss, hunched back and general paralysis (Giasson et al., 2002). In our

494

experiments, the inoculated M83 mice were housed per group in enriched cages in a

495

temperature-controlled room on a 12h light/dark cycle, and received water and food ad

496

libitum, in our approved facilities (N° C69 387 0801), in accordance with EEC Directive

497

86/609/EEC and French decree No. 2013-118. The experimental protocol was authorized (N°

498

16-039) by the Comité d’éthique ComEth ANSES/ENVA/UPEC. Daily monitoring of the

499

mice took place to detect any symptom of the M83 disease as described (Sargent et al., 2017),

including slow ambulation, balance disorders and partial paralysis of a hind limb. When mice

501

develop these first symptoms or any inter-current disease not associated with M83 disease, we

proceed to euthanasia by lethal intraperitoneal injection of dolethal. In the 3 experiments in

which mice did not show clinical signs before the age of 9 months, corresponding to the

surviving healthy mice were sacrificed at the age of ∼ 14 months old.

Table 1. α-syn PMCA seeding activities in a panel of brain samples from sick or healthy M83
mice. One or two PMCA rounds were performed in M83+/- (5%, 96 cycles) or C57Bl/6-WT
(10%, 144 cycles) brain substrate after seeding with whole brain homogenates of M83+/+ mice
diluted at 10-4 or 10-3 for sick or healthy mice respectively. The sick M83+/+ mice were either
old unchallenged mice (≥ 1 year old) or 3-6 months old mice after intracerebral inoculations
of brain extracts of sick M83+/+ mice or of recombinant fibrils. The Western blot detection
results represent the presence (+) or absence (-) of SDS-resistant α-syn aggregates detected
with C-20R antibody, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 3. De novo PMCA-generated α-syn aggregates from M83 mice seed the aggregation of α-syn
in PMCA reactions. (A-B) Immunoblots of α-syn (C-20R antibody) in PMCA samples after seeding with
serial 10-fold dilutions (10-3 to 10-6) of a 144 cycle PMCA product from M83+/- mice containing de novo
α-syn aggregates, in comparison with unseeded normal brain homogenate substrate treated by PMCA
(NBH) or after seeding with unsonicated M83+/+ brain at dilution 10-3 (CTL). 144 PMCA cycles in 10%
brain homogenates were performed for the C57Bl/6-KO, C57Bl/6-WT and D substrates, or 96 PMCA
cycles in 5% brain homogenates for the M83+/- substrate. Rec: human recombinant α-syn control. Bars
to the left of each panel indicate the ~ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kDa molecular weight markers. (C-D)
ELISA immunoreactivity after loading of the same PMCA samples on MaxiSorpTM plates, followed by
detection of captured -syn using C-20R antibody. Three repetitions of the ELISA test were performed.

Figure 4. Distinct aggregation behavior of human and mouse α-syn proteins after seeded-PMCA in the
different brain substrates. (A-C) Immunoblots of α-syn in PMCA samples obtained after seeding the
four mouse brain substrates with a PMCA product (dilutions 10-3 and 10-4) produced in M83+/- brain as
shown in Figure 1A. 144 PMCA cycles in 10% brain homogenates were performed for the C57Bl/6-KO,
C57Bl/6-WT and D substrates, or 96 PMCA cycles in 5% brain homogenates for the M83+/- substrate.
The immunoblot membranes were revealed by MJFR1 or D37A6 antibodies specific for the human or
mouse α-syn respectively, or by C-20R antibody which recognizes both human and mouse α-syn. Rec:
human recombinant α-syn control. Bars to the left of each panel indicate the ~ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60

Figure 5. Detection of α-syn PMCA seeding activity in the brain of sick M83 mice. (A) Western blot
analysis of PMCA products obtained after seeding with serial 10-fold dilutions (10-3 to 10-6) of a brain
homogenate from a sick M83+/+ mouse, in comparison with unseeded normal brain homogenate
substrate treated by PMCA (NBH) or after seeding with unsonicated healthy M83+/+ brain at dilution 103 (CTL). 144 PMCA cycles in 10% brain homogenates were performed for the C57Bl/6-KO, C57Bl/6WT and D substrates, or 96 PMCA cycles in 5% brain homogenates for the M83+/- substrate. The sick
M83 mouse was a 170 days old mice that had been intracerebrally inoculated at 8 weeks old with brain
homogenate of sick M83 mouse and the healthy mouse was a 60 days old unchallenged mouse. (B)
Immunoblots of α-syn (C-20R antibody) in PMCA samples obtained after seeding the C57Bl/6-WT
brain substrate (10%, 144 cycles) with a whole brain homogenate (dilutions 10-3 to 10-10) from a sick
M83 mouse that died with typical clinical signs of the disease, in comparison with unseeded normal
brain homogenate (NBH). One or two PMCA rounds were performed. Rec: human recombinant α-syn

phosphorylated α-syn in the same panel of brain samples from healthy or sick M83+/+ mice. ELISA
detection was performed using Syn303 as a capture antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibody against
Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn (Abcam Cat# ab59264) for detection. Two quantities of brain
homogenates were examined, including 0.2% (as described by Sargent et al., 2017) and 0.01%
homogenates, this last concentration corresponding to a 10-4 dilution of seeds as examined in PMCA
experiments.

Figure 7. PMCA seeding activity within the same M83 brain is higher in regions mostly targeted by the
α-syn pathology. (A) Comparison of PMCA seeding activities in different brain regions of two sick
M83+/+ mice sacrificed with typical clinical signs, at the age of 573 (sick M83 #1) or 670 (sick M83 #2)
days old. PMCA was performed using the C57Bl/6-WT brain substrate (10%, 144 cycles) after seeding
with a 10-4 dilution of each of the following brain regions: olfactory bulb (OB), cerebral cortex (CTX),
hippocampus (HIP), striatum (STR), midbrain (MB), cerebellum (CB) and brain stem (BS). Bars to the
left of each panel indicate the ~ 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 kDa molecular weight markers. (B) ELISA
detection of Ser129 phosphorylated α-syn in the same dissected brain regions from sick M83 #1 and
#2 mice. Two quantities of brain homogenates were examined, including 0.2% (as described by
Sargent et al., 2017) and 0.01% homogenates, this last concentration corresponding to the 10-4 dilution
of seeds as examined by PMCA.

Figure 8. Survival of M83+/+ mice after intracerebral inoculation of PMCA products. The age at death is
indicated by the vertical axis for the 5 experiments with inocula prepared from M83+/-, M83+/+ or
C57Bl/6-KO brain homogenates (10%) which had been treated by PMCA for a single round (144
cycles) or, in the case of the M83+/+ brain substrate, incubated without sonication in shaking or in
standing conditions. The mean and standard deviations of the ages at death are indicated within the
graph for the two groups from which all the mice had died before the end of the protocol at 400 days.
Mice with the typical clinical signs of M83 disease are illustrated as circles and mice that were found
dead without previously observing clinical signs as triangles; mice that were sacrificed after the end of
the protocol, without detectable clinical signs are shown as squares. Mice from which brain samples
were found positive by ELISA for Ser129 phosphorylated -syn are shown in red and those that are
negative in green; those that could not be analyzed because of unavailable frozen samples are shown
in black.

Figure 9. Schematic representation of PMCA generation and seeded propagation of lethal -syn
aggregates. PMCA provokes spontaneous, sonication-dependant, -syn aggregation from young M83
brain homogenate. De novo generated -syn aggregation from M83 brain propagates in a wild-type
mouse brain substrate after seeded-PMCA and accelerates -syn neuropathology and disease after
intracerebral inoculation to young M83 mice. These findings corroborate the prion-like character of
aggregated -syn. PMCA emerges as a potential in vitro model of -syn aggregation phenomenon in a
biological complex matrix.
