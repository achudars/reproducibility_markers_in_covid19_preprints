Abstract
This report developed a novel method to observe the anti-tumor effect of HA
nanoparticle carrier-mediated HepG2 cell vaccine transfected with hGM-CSF gene in
vitro, and provide evidence for the clinical application of hGM-CSF gene-modified
HepG2 cell vaccine. HA nanoparticle-mediated hGM-CSF gene transfection of HepG2
cells was used to prepare HepG2 cell vaccine transfected with GMCSF gene. Human
PBMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and human PBMC were induced
in vitro. The proliferative activity of PBMC and the killing effect on HepG2 cells were
determined by WST-1 method. The positive expression rates of CD4+ and CD8+ were
analyzed by flow cytometry, and the secretion of INF-γ was determined by ELISA. WST1 results showed that the transgenic HepG2 vaccine induced PBMC proliferation, and
its proliferation rate was better than that of wild-type vaccine. The induced PBMC had a
higher killing rate against HepG2 than the wild-type vaccine group and each blank. In
the control group, FCM results showed that the positive expression rates of CD4+ and
CD8+ in the transgenic HepG2 vaccine group were higher than those in the wild-type
vaccine group and each blank control group. The ELISA results showed that the IFN-γ
content in the transgenic PBMC culture supernatant was 1989.76. +/- 254.21 pg/ml,
higher than the wild-type vaccine group and each blank control group.

Introduction
Primary liver cancer (PLC) is one of the common and refractory malignant tumors in
China, 90% of which are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for the second
highest mortality rate of malignant tumors in China. Surgical resection is the preferred
method for the treatment of liver cancer, but its efficacy is still not satisfactory. The
recurrence rate is as high as 60%-70% or even higher after 5 years [1]. Recurrence and
metastasis of tumor remains a difficult problem to be solved. With the in-depth study of
tumor immunity, tumor vaccines prepared by transferring cytokine genes with extensive
regulatory functions to tumor cells have achieved encouraging results in many clinical
and experimental studies [2] -4]. In this experiment, HepG2 cells were transfected with
GM-CSF gene in HA nanocarriers and inactivated by 60Co intermittent irradiation to
prepare HepG2 cell vaccine with hGM-CSF gene. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell

(PBMC) was isolated, and the transgenic vaccine was co-cultured with PBMC to induce
PBMC in vitro, and the proliferation, differentiation and killing effects of PBMC after
induction were observed to evaluate its effect on immune function. To provide a basis
for the clinical application of HepG2 cell vaccine transfected with hGMCSF gene.

The HA nanoparticle carrier mediates HepG2 cells transfected with hGM-CSF gene [5],
and then combined with wild-type HepG2 cells by sublethal dose of radiation to prepare
HepG2 vaccine and wild-type HepG2 vaccine transfected with GMCSF gene. . RT-PCR
was used to identify the expression and integration of hGMCSF-mRNA after irradiation,
and the secretion and duration of hGMCSF in culture medium were determined by
ELISA.
Peripheral venous blood of healthy volunteers was taken under aseptic conditions, and
human PBMC was isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Cell suspension was
prepared by adding 1640 complete medium containing 10% FBS, and the cell density
was adjusted to 1×10E6/ml. Place in a CO2 cell culture incubator (37 ° C, 5% CO 2 , 95%
humidity) for use.
The irradiated transgenic HepG2 vaccine and the irradiated wild-type HepG2 vaccine
were adjusted with 1640 medium containing 15% FBS to adjust the cell concentration in
1640 medium to 2 × 10E5 / ml, 1 × 10E5 / ml, 5 × 10E4 / Ml, 2.5 × 10E4/ml. Add
1×10E6/ml PBMC to a 96-well plate at 100 μl per well. 100 μl of each of the abovementioned stimulator cells was added to each well, and the ratio of the stimulating cells

for 3 days, add WST-1 20ul/well 4 hours before the end of culture, continue culture for
4h, stop the culture, shake the 96-well plate on a shaker for one minute, to fully mix The
test system is conditioned. The absorbance (A) value of each well was measured at an
ED 450 nm enzyme-linked immunosorbent detector. Based on the absorbance (A)
values, the PBMC proliferation rate was calculated as the stimulation index (SI), SI =
stimulating the cell hole A450 value / without stimulating the cell hole A450 value.

Results and Discussion
The hGM-CSF gene HepG2 vaccine and the wild-type HepG2 vaccine were
successfully prepared. RT-PCR results can amplify a band of about 410 bp, which is an
internal reference. Both transgenic HepG2 cells irradiated with 60Co and unirradiated
transgenic HepG2 cells amplified a specific band of about 260 bp, indicating that hGMCSF mRNA was transcribed. There was no specific 260 bp band in wild-type HepG2
cells intermittently irradiated with 60Co and without 60Co intermittent irradiation (Fig. 1).
The results of ELISA showed that HepG2 cells transfected with hCo-SF gene by 60Co

Figure 1. Gel electrophoresis analysis
At the end of the 3-day culture period, the A values of the two blank control PBMCs
were 0.398±0.008 and 0.375±0.010, respectively, and the difference was not
statistically significant (P>0.05), indicating that 20 U/mL of IL-2 could not be separated.
Induction of PBMC proliferation. When the ratio of induced cells (Inducer, I) and effector
cells (Effector, E) (I: E) were 1:40, 1:10, 1:20, 1:5, respectively, IL-2 (20 U/) was added.
Under the conditions of mL), the results of transgenic HepG2 vaccine and wild-type
HepG2 vaccine-stimulated cells to induce PBMC proliferation were as follows (Table 1)
(Fig. 2).
From the above, we can see that the proliferation of PBMC cells in the transgenic
HepG2 vaccine group was higher than that in the wild-type vaccine group A, and the
proliferation rate was statistically significant (P<0.05). It indicates that the HepG2

vaccine has enhanced immunogenicity after transduction into the hGMCSF gene, and
its ability to induce PBMC proliferation is enhanced. When the I:E value is 1:20, the
ability of the transgenic HepG2 vaccine and the wild-type HepG2 vaccine to induce
PBMC proliferation has the greatest effect, so the concentration ratio of PBMC induced
by the following groups of vaccines was selected.
At the end of the 3-day culture period, the percentage of CD4+ cells in the blank control
group A and the blank control group B were (32.07±2.53)%, (30.44±2.02)%, and the
percentage of CD8+ cells were respectively (by flow cytometry analysis). 23.25± 2.11)%,
(23.03±2.48)%, both P>0.05, indicating that 20 U/mL IL-2 could not induce the
percentage change of CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells in PBMC alone. The percentages of
CD4+ cells in PBMC of transgenic vaccine group, wild type vaccine group A and wild
type vaccine group B were (58.72±2.55)%, (43.43±2.29)%, (50.07±3.20)%, respectively,
and the percentage of CD8+ cells were ( 35.14±2.05)%, (29.41±1.73)%, (32.17±1.58)%,
the percentages were higher than the corresponding cells in the blank control group A,
all P<0.05. Moreover, the ratio of CD4+ cell positive ratio and CD8+ cell positive ratio in
PBMC of transgenic vaccine group was higher than that of wild type vaccine group A
and wild type vaccine group B, P<0.05 (Table 2) (Fig. 3).

At the end of the 3-day culture period, the levels of IFN-γ in the supernatant of PBMC
cultures of the two blank control groups were 757.25 ± 131.91 pg/ml and 692.87 ±
129.24 pg/ml, P>0.05, and the difference was not statistically significant. It was shown
that 20 U/mL of IL-2 could not induce PBMC to secrete IFN-γ alone. The contents of
IFN-γ in the supernatant of PBMC in transgenic vaccine group, wild type vaccine group
A and wild type vaccine group B were 1947.10 ± 133.69 pg/ml, 1032.66 ± 104.79 pg/ml,
and 1334.41 ± 159.03 pg/ml, respectively. The IFN-γ content in the supernatant of the
vaccine group PBMC was higher than that of the blank control group A, the wild type
vaccine group A and the wild type vaccine group B, both P < 0.05 (Table 3) (Fig. 4).

At the end of the 5-day culture period, the killing rates of PBMCs in the transgenic
vaccine group to HepG2 cells were 56.26±4.56, 62.74±, respectively, when the ratio of
target to target (E:T) was 12.5: 1,25:1 and 50:1, respectively. 4.82,79.29±4.68, its killing
ability was positively correlated with the number of effector cells, higher than the killing
rate of blank control group, wild type vaccine group A and wild type vaccine group B, all
P<0.05, the difference was statistically significant. The killing rate of HepG2 cells in wildtype vaccine group B was higher than that in wild-type vaccine group A, but P>0.05, the
difference was not statistically significant (Table 4) (Fig. 5).

Tumor vaccine is a new type of tumor treatment method that uses tumor cells, tumor
cell lysates or tumor antigens to stimulate the body's immune system to produce
specific anti-tumor immune effects. However, autologous and allogeneic whole-cell
vaccines stimulate the immune response to a very limited extent, and improve tumors.
The exemptive preparation of highly efficient tumor vaccines is the key to
immunotherapy. Tumor genetic engineering vaccines use genetic recombination
technology to introduce different target genes such as cytokines, helper stimulating
molecules, and MHC class I antigen molecules into cells [7], thereby changing the local
immune environment and enhancing antigen-presenting cells and tumor specificity. T
cell activity. GM-CSF is one of the 33 most potent products evaluated so far [8]. GMCSF is a cytokine with multiple immunoregulatory functions. Cells modified by GM-CSF
gene can express GMCSF for a long time, which can attract a large number of antigen
presenting cells to the injection site. These cells capture "tumor cells" here. The tumor
antigen, which differentiates, activates, and matures under the action of GM-CSF,
presents the decomposed antigen to T lymphocytes, and finally produces activated T
lymphocytes capable of killing tumor cells [9]. GM-CSF gene-modified tumor vaccines
have shown potential clinical value in experimental and clinical studies of melanoma
[10], prostate cancer [11], lung cancer [12], and renal cancer [13]1-14. However, GMCSF gene-modified liver cancer vaccine has not been reported15.

On the basis of previous experiments, we successfully prepared transgenic HepG2 cell
vaccine by transfecting hGM-CSF gene with HA nanoparticle carrier, and induced
PBMC in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro to observe the proliferation,
differentiation and HepG2 cells of PBMC after induction. The killing effect. From the
experimental results, the transgenic HepG2 cell vaccine can promote the proliferation of
PBMC, up-regulate the expression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, increase the secretion of
INF-γ, and increase its killing effect on HepG2 cells. The immune effect is not only
stronger than that of wild-type HepG216-20. The vaccine group and the blank control
group were superior to the wild-type vaccine and the equivalent dose of the hGM-CSF
mixed group, suggesting that the HepG2 cell vaccine transfected with the hGM-CSF
gene induces an increase in antitumor effect in addition to the local effect of GM-CSF
secretion. It is also possible that changes in the structure of the antigen after transfer
into the hGM-CSF gene are associated with an increase in its immunogenicity. We also
noticed the presence of immunodeficiency in patients with liver cancer [14], but due to
the difficulty in collecting blood samples, this experiment failed to use peripheral blood
in patients after liver cancer surgery; at the same time, the in vitro environment and the
in vivo environment are also different. Therefore, further clinical and experimental
observations of the vaccine are required after assessing its safety. In conclusion, the
HA nanocarrier-mediated HepG2 cell vaccine transfected with the hGM-CSF gene
showed a good immune effect in vitro and is expected to be a new approach for the
treatment and prevention of HCC metastasis.

Conclusion
HA nanoparticle-mediated transfection of hGM-CSF gene can increase the
immunogenicity of HepG2 cell vaccine, transfecting hGM-CSF gene HepG2 cells The
vaccine can effectively induce PBMC proliferation, differentiation, increase the secretion
of INF-γ, and enhance its killing effect on HepG2 cells. Key words: liver neoplasms;
