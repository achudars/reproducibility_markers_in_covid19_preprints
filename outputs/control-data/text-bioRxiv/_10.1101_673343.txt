ABSTRACT Inter-subjects‚Äô variability in functional brain networks has been extensively investigated in the
last few years. In this context, unveiling subject-specific characteristics of EEG features may play an
important role for both clinical (e.g., biomarkers) and bio-engineering purposes (e.g., biometric systems and
brain computer interfaces). Nevertheless, the effects induced by multi-sessions and task-switching are not
completely understood and considered. In this work, we aimed to investigate how the variability due to
subject, session and task affects EEG power, connectivity and network features estimated using sourcereconstructed EEG time-series. Our results point out a remarkable ability to identify subject-specific EEG
traits within a given task together with striking independence from the session. The results also show a
relevant effect of task-switching, which is comparable to individual variability. This study suggests that
power and connectivity EEG features may be adequate to detect stable (over-time) individual properties
within predefined and controlled tasks.
Keywords: EEG, individuality, connectivity, task-switching

I. INTRODUCTION

Despite most neuroimaging studies still tend to treat human
brain features as stable and homogeneous characteristics
within a group, it is important to highlight that, in contrast,
individual variability may play a relevant role in this context
[1], [2]. The way in which each brain is unique and could be
distinguished amidst a myriad of other brains is fascinating,
but unveiling the underlying subject-specific characteristics
is crucial for both clinical (e.g., biomarkers) and bioengineering purposes (e.g., biometric systems and brain
computer interfaces). Recent studies have already
highlighted the implications of individual variation for
personalized approaches to mental illness [3], ADHD [4] and
in the developing brain [5]. It has been also reported that
these functional traits are familial, heritable and stable over
a long time interval [6], [7]. Electroencephalographic (EEG)
time-frequency [8] and connectivity-based [9], [10] features
have shown subject-specific characteristics comparable in

terms of performance to other more common fingerprints.
Nevertheless, the performance of EEG-based biometric
systems seems to be not independent from the specific
connectivity metric, scarcely investigated in terms of
permanence and tend to decrease in a between-tasks
scenario [11]. From this new perspective, with the clear
evidence that functional brain networks vary across
individuals, few studies investigated to what extent these
subject-specific traits are stable over time and over different
states. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI), Gratton et al. [12] reported that functional networks
are suited to detect stable individual characteristics with a
limited contribution from task-state and day-to-day
variability, thus suggesting their possible utility in the
personalized medicine approach. Similarly, Cox et al. [13],
using EEG scalp level analysis, have reported that, despite a
shared structure is still discernible across individuals, welldefined subject-specific and stable over-time network

profiles were clearly detectable. In this study we aim to
investigate if these subject-specific traits are still detectable,
stable over time and consistent among different tasks using
an EEG source level approach. This approach should provide
a more accurate description of the underlying network [14]
since the connectivity estimates should be less prone to
volume conduction and signal leakage problems. In order to
investigate this question we analyzed source-reconstructed
EEG time-series using three different and widely used
analyses: Power Spectral Density (PSD), Phase Locking
Value (PLV) [15] and nodal centrality network approaches,
namely Eigenvector Centrality (EC). PSD has been shown to
capture relevant subject-specific information [8] and
represents one of the more simple and interpretable EEG
features. PLV, in combination with weighted Minimum
Norm Estimator (wMNE) [16], provides a good estimate of
the functional brain organization in EEG [17] and, despite
the PLV is not completely independent from the PSD [18],
is known to be affected by volume conduction and signal
leakage, it still performs better than other common
connectivity metrics in terms of subject authentication [11].
Moreover, as previously stated, the PLV was recently used
at scalp-level to investigate variability and stability of largescale cortical oscillation patterns [13]. Finally, it was
reported that the EC, which captures more information about
the network topology then straightforward measure such as
the degree, represents a promising measure to design of
EEG-based biometric systems [9]. The analysis was
performed on a novel EEG dataset consisting of fourteen
healthy subjects, recorded over two different sessions (after
four weeks) and performing four different tasks. All the code
is freely available in a Github repository at the following
link: https://github.com/matteogithub/individuality.

II. METHOD
A. EEG PREPROCESSING

All the preprocessing steps were performed using the freely
available toolbox EEGLAB (version 13_6_5b) [19]. The raw
EEG signals were re-reference to common average reference
and band-pass filtered (with fir1 filter type) between 1 and
70 Hz and a notch filter set to 50 Hz was also applied. All the
recordings were visually inspected and segments with clear
artifacts were rejected and not further analyzed.
B. SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION

In order to obtain the source-reconstructed time-series, the
Brainstorm software (version 3.4) [20] was used to compute
the head model with a symmetric boundary element method
in Open-MEEG [21] based on the anatomy derived from the
ICBM152 brain. EEG time-series at source level were
reconstructed using whitened and depth-weighted linear L2
minimum norm estimate (wMNE) [16], [22] and projected
onto 68 regions of interest (ROIs) as defined by the DesikanKilliany atlas [23].

C. FEATURES EXTRACTION

After the EEG time-series were reconstructed at source level,
in order to increase the quality of the analysis, for each subject,
each task and each session, we selected the best (less
contaminated) 10 EEG epochs (segments of 5 seconds)
ordering all the available epochs on the basis of the threesigma rule (consequently discarding segments presenting
values over than 3 standard deviations from the mean) [24].
Successively, for each selected epoch we have extracted three
different features vectors, respectively for PSD, PLV and EC,
representing the individual profiles or subject fingerprints. For
the PSD analysis, the features vector, for each single epoch,
was composed of the 272 entries representing the relative
power (extracted using the Welch method) of four frequency
bands (delta [1 - 4 Hz], theta [4 - 8 Hz], alpha [8 - 13 Hz] and
beta [13 - 30 Hz]), separately for each of the 68 regions of
interest. For the PLV analysis, the features vector, for each
single epoch and for each frequency band, was composed of
2.278 entries representing the connectivity profile (upper
triangular of the connectivity matrix), where each entry was
computed as:
2

1
ùëÉùêøùëâ$% = )* ùëí ,-(/$(0),/%(0)) )
ùëá
034

where T is the epoch length and j is the instantaneous phase.
For the network analysis, in order to keep a nodal resolution,
we have computed the EC, a centrality measure based on the
spectral decomposition of the weighted connectivity matrix
[25]. In this latter case the features vector, for each single
epoch and separately for each frequency band, was
composed of 68 entries, each representing the centrality
value of the corresponding ROI. As a final step, in order to
estimate the similarity among each pairs of possible
observations (between-epochs), we computed the Euclidian
distance between features vectors (individual profiles)
independently for PSD, PLV and EC analysis, thus
obtaining, for each analysis, a square and symmetric matrix
of distances, with the dimension equals to (number of
subjects) * (number of sessions) * (number of tasks) *
(number of epochs) as shown in Figure 1. From this distances
matrix, we have computed the average distances across
epochs for each of the following six scenarios: (i) withintask, within-session and within-subject; (ii) between-tasks,
within-session and within-subject; (iii) between-sessions,
within-task and within-subject; (iv) between-sessions,
between-tasks and within-subject; (v) within-task, withinsession and between-subjects; (vi) all-between. All the code,
developed in Matlab, reporting the extraction of the profiles
and their comparison, is freely available at the following link
in Github: https://github.com/matteogithub/individuality.

FIGURE 1. A schematic representation of the first block (one subject)
of the matrix containing the distances. The main diagonal contains
zeros.

Fifteen healthy volunteers (7 females, mean age 31.9 ¬± 3.1
years, range 28 ‚Äì 38) were enrolled in the present study.
Informed consent was obtained prior to the recordings and the
study was approved by the local ethics committee. EEG
signals were recorded using a 61 channels EEG system (Brain
QuickSystem, Micromed, Italy) during four different tasks
and repeated over two different session (the second acquired
four weeks later from the first). Recordings were acquired in a
sitting position in a normal daylight room; a dimly lit and
sound attenuated room and supine position were avoided to
prevent drowsiness. Signals were digitized with a sampling
frequency of 1024 Hz with the reference electrode placed in
close approximation of the electrode POz. The four tasks
consisted of: (i) five minutes eyes-closed resting-state, (ii) five
minutes eyes-open resting-state, (iii) two minutes eyes-closed
simple mathematical task and (iv) two minutes eyes-closed
complex mathematical task. During the simple mathematical
task, the subjects were asked to perform multiple subtractions,
while during the complex mathematical task, subjects were
asked to perform a series two digits multiplications. Three
subjects were excluded from the analysis due to low quality of
the EEG recordings and another one missed the second
session.

further increased for the between-subjects‚Äô scenarios, both for

(7.25 ¬± 0.87).

C. NETWORK CENTRALITY

Results derived from the application of EC on PLV based
analysis (in the beta band) are still consistent with the
previously reports, as shown in Figure 5 and the corresponding
statistics summarized in Table 4. Again, the lower distances
were observed for the within-task, within-session, withinsubject scenario (0.12 ¬± 0.01) and for the between-sessions,
within-task, within-subject scenario (0.11 ¬± 0.01). The
distances increased for the between-tasks scenarios, both for
within-session (0.14 ¬± 0.02) and for between-sessions (0.14 ¬±
0.02). Finally, the distances further increased for the between-

In summary, in this work we aimed to investigate how the
variability due to subject, session and task affects EEG power,
connectivity and network features estimated using sourcereconstructed EEG time-series. Despite this question was
extensively investigated using fMRI [2], [6], [12], high density
EEG, which still represents a very important and useful
clinical tool, have received less attention in this context.
Although, numerous studies have investigated the possibility
to use EEG signals to develop biometric systems, only
recently more attention was devoted to the study of subject
variability and stability over-time and states [13]. The results
of this study show three main relevant points. First, as
expected, for all the different analyses, PSD, PLV and EC
based approaches, the lower distances were observed in the
scenario corresponding to a simple between epochs scheme,
within the same subject, the same session and the same task. It
should be highlighted that this also represents the more
common scenario in which studies do not consider the
variance induced by subject-specific traits, multi-sessions
and/or by multi-tasks setup. Second, probably the more
interesting finding, the distances obtained using the betweensessions, within-task, within-subject scenario are comparable
with the previous one (namely, within-session scenario) for all
the performed analyses. This finding clearly indicates that the
variance due to the session is therefore negligible. Third,
conversely, the effect due to the task (task-switching) is
substantial, as also highlighted by the statistics and consistent
for all the different analyses (i.e., PSD, PLV in beta and alpha
bands and EC analysis). Moreover, the second point is further
confirmed by the between-sessions and between-tasks
scenario, where again it is still evident the low effect due to
the session switching. Finally, as expected, the distances
strongly increase in the between-subjects scenario, showing a
clear effect due to specific subject, thus confirming the
importance to address the issue related with the variance
within a group. The reported results support, as recently
reported using a scalp-level EEG analysis [13], the existence
of well-defined subject-specific profiles and that these features
may be considered stable over a defined and limited time
range. These results are also in line with the fact that taskinvariant subject-specific features are stronger than taskdependent group profiles. Finally, the reported findings also
represent an important confirmation obtained at source level,
of the results reported using scalp EEG based biometric
systems [10], [11], never explored with this spatial resolution,
further suggesting that these systems, other than show a very
high uniqueness, may provide very good permanence
properties. On the other hand, these results also confirm what
is generally observable by designing a brain computer
interface system. In fact, even though it is still remarkable a
strong effect of task-switching, it is still evident that the

individual traits may strongly hinder the generalization of the
approach (failing to keep a good performance across different
subjects).
V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown that source-level EEG analysis
confirms that PSD, PLV and PLV derived functional brain
network, as measured by nodal centrality (namely, eigenvector
centrality), are stable over-time, dominated by individual
properties but largely dependent from the specific task. These
findings may have important implications for both clinical
(e.g., biomarkers) and bio-engineering applications (e.g.,
biometric systems and brain computer interfaces).
