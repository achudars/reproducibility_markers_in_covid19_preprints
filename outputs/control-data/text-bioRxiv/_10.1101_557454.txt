Abstract

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) selectively deliver highly toxic chemotherapeutic agents to
target antigen-expressing cells and have become an important cancer treatment in recent years.
However, the molecular mechanisms by which ADCs are internalized and activated within cells
remain unclear. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify genes that control the toxicity of
ADCs. Our results demonstrate critical roles for a range of known and novel endolysosomal
trafficking regulators in ADC toxicity. We identify and characterize C18orf8/RMC1 as a regulator
of ADC toxicity through its role in endosomal maturation. Through comparative analysis of
CRISPR screens with ADCs bearing a noncleavable linker versus a cleavable valine-citrulline
(VC) linker, we show that a subset of late endosomal and lysosomal regulators are selectively
essential for toxicity of noncleavable linker ADCs. We further show that cleavable VC linkers are
rapidly processed upon internalization and therefore surprisingly appear to bypass the
requirement of lysosomal delivery. Lastly, we show that inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis
sensitizes cells to ADC treatment by increasing the rate of ADC internalization. This sensitization
was observed using several ADCs targeting different antigens in diverse cancer cell types,
including the FDA-approved ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in Her2-positive breast
cancer cells. Together, these results reveal novel regulators of endolysosomal trafficking,
provide important insights to guide future ADC design, and identify candidate combination
therapy targets as well as potential mechanisms of ADC resistance.

Introduction

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of targeted cancer therapeutics with
immense promise and demonstrated clinical success1–6. ADCs combine monoclonal antibodies
with highly toxic small molecules to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to antigenexpressing tumor cells. Currently, four ADCs have been approved by the FDA since 2013 and
more than 80 distinct ADCs are currently being tested in clinical trials for a range of cancers6.
Despite intense clinical interest, the mechanisms by which ADCs enter and kill the cell – a
process comprising many steps including internalization, intracellular trafficking, catalytic
processing, and lysosomal escape – remain incompletely understood.

Our current understanding of ADC uptake and trafficking is largely based on classical studies of
endogenous ligands and their receptors. ADCs are thought to bind their target antigen on the
cell surface, undergo internalization, and traffic to the lysosome. In the lysosome, ADCs are
processed by proteolytic and other enzymes that cleave the conjugated drug from the antibody,
triggering “payload” release and toxicity. However, antibody binding may alter receptor
internalization and trafficking pathways, leading to a decrease in delivery to the lysosome and
increased delivery to other cellular compartments7–9, resulting in suboptimal killing. Altered
trafficking routes have also been implicated in resistance to ADC treatments9–11, highlighting the
need for a comprehensive understanding of how ADC trafficking is controlled.

The chemical linkage between the antibody and the conjugate drug is a critical feature that
ensures stability of ADCs in circulation while allowing their toxic payload to be released within
target cells. Linkers used for ADCs are often classified as either “cleavable” or “noncleavable”,
and both designs are being used in the clinic2. Cleavable linkers have been engineered to be
sensitive to enzymes, acidic, or reductive conditions, thereby releasing the ADC payload upon
exposure to these intracellular stimuli2. However, some cleavable linkers have been associated
with non-specific, extracellular release and off-target killing12–14. In contrast, noncleavable linkers
are more stable in circulation as they require antibody degradation to become cytotoxic 2,12. A
significant complication for noncleavable linkers is that their payload remains attached to the

linker and the conjugated amino acids, assemblies that tend to be membrane-impermeable and
require the activity of lysosomal transporters to escape into the cytosol4.

The optimal linker type remains an open question, as existing clinical and preclinical data have
been decidedly mixed. For example, preclinical studies of ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1/
Kadcyla®) showed that the noncleavable thioether linker (SMCC) was more effective than
cleavable versions in vivo15. However, noncleavable linkers are ineffective when used in
targeting certain cancer antigens16. While further trials and optimization could improve linker
efficacy, it is likely that these results depend on intracellular trafficking of the ADC and the genetic
landscape of the tumors.

Here, we use genome-wide CRISPR-knock out screens to identify modulators of ADC toxicity in
an unbiased fashion, and secondary screens to identify genes with differential roles in
processing of ADCs with noncleavable linkers versus cleavable valine-citrulline (VC) linkers. We
uncovered many known and novel endolysosomal regulators that influence ADC trafficking and
processing, revealing potential resistance mechanisms. We identified C18orf8/RMC1 as a novel
modulator of ADC toxicity and further characterized its role in general endolysosomal trafficking.
Lastly, we found that inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis sensitizes cells to anti-CD22 ADC
treatment by boosting rate of ADC internalization, a finding which generalized to the FDAapproved Her2-targeting ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Together, our results elucidate
mechanisms controlling ADC trafficking and toxicity, and provide insight for future ADC
development.

Results

Genome-wide CRISPR screen uncovers diverse endolysosomal regulators of ADC
toxicity

To identify genes regulating ADC toxicity, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-deletion
screen using a potent CD22-targeting ADC (anti-CD22-Asparagine-PEG2-maytansine,
hereinafter referred to as anti-CD22-maytansine). The ADC was synthesized using a sitespecific conjugation technology based upon the aldehyde tag 17 and HIPS chemistry 18 to attach
a microtubule inhibitor (maytansine19) payload coupled through a noncleavable linker to the
antibody heavy chain C-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Maytansine is a highly toxic
microtubule inhibitor used in many ADCs2. We first tested that the anti-CD22-maytansine ADC
inhibits growth of a CD22-positive B-lymphocyte Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line (Ramos) in a doseand antibody-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Then we lentivirally transduced a
previously validated sgRNA knock-out library into Cas9-expressing Ramos cells targeting all
protein coding genes with 10 sgRNAs/gene and ~10,000 negative controls20. We then split the
cells into two conditions in duplicate, one treated with 2 nM anti-CD22-maytansine for three
rounds treatment (each killing ~50% of cells) and the other left untreated. During the 2-week
course of the screen, cells with sgRNAs targeting genes required for ADC toxicity are enriched
in the ADC treated conditions relative to the untreated conditions while cells with sgRNAs
targeting genes that when knocked out sensitize cells to ADC are depleted. The proportion of
each sgRNA in the two conditions was measured by deep sequencing and significant regulators
of ADC toxicity were identified using casTLE (Fig. 1a)21.

This initial screen identified 168 known and novel regulators of ADC toxicity at a 10% false
discovery rate (FDR) (Fig. 1b and 1d; see Supplementary Table 1 for full list). Top hits were then
validated with individual sgRNA-expressing knockout cell lines in competitive-growth assays
(Fig. 1c). Among the strongest hits was CD22, the target antigen of the ADC, as well as
SLC46A3, a previously reported lysosomal transporter that is required for maytansineconjugates with noncleavable linkers to enter the cytosol after proteolytic processing 22. These
positive controls indicated the screening strategy could robustly identify genes critical for ADC

biology. Moreover, we identified a number of endolysosomal genes as modifiers of ADC toxicity,
including RAB7A (a key regulator of late endolysosomal trafficking23–25), MON1 and CCZ1 (both
activators of RAB7A activity26–28). The screen revealed that WDR81 and WDR91, two recently
characterized regulators of endosomal maturation29,30, are essential for ADC toxicity, suggesting
that they also play roles in mediating ADC lysosomal delivery. Deletion of lysosomal cathepsins
A, C, and S were highly protective against ADC killing; these enzymes are likely important for
proteolytic degradation of the antibody. We also identified many nuclear genes such as
chromatin modifiers MEN131,32 and DOT1L33, which may be required for the anti-mitotic activity
of maytansine or are indirectly influencing ADC trafficking and processing.

Targeted screens reveal critical role of lysosomal delivery in toxicity of noncleavable
linker ADC but not cleavable linker ADC
We next aimed to evaluate whether the genetic modifiers identified in our genome-wide screen
play roles in ADC trafficking, processing, or the anti-mitotic activity of maytansine. To do this, we
performed parallel high cell coverage targeted screens using an ADC with a noncleavable linker
(anti-CD22-maytansine used above), an ADC with a cleavable linker (anti-CD22-GlutamatePEG2-valine-citrulline-maytansine, hereinafter referred to as anti-CD22-VC-maytansine, see
supplementary Fig. 1b for structure), and free maytansine. These three treatments were
screened in parallel in Ramos cells (Fig. 2a), using a targeted sublibrary of sgRNAs targeting (1)
the hits identified in the genome-widescreen, (2) manually curated endolysosomal regulators,
and (3) lysosomal-localized genes34 (Fig. 2a, see Supplementary Table 5 for list of genes and
sgRNAs). In contrast to noncleavable linkers, valine-citrulline (VC) linkers are designed to be
cleaved by the cysteine protease cathepsin B35,36 (Supplementary Fig. 1c)., but were recently
shown to be also sensitive to other cathepsins37. Proteolytic processing of anti-CD22-VCmaytansine releases a maytansine payload that is expected to freely diffuse across endosomal
membranes. Similar to the genome-wide screens, screens for each condition were performed in
duplicate and either left untreated, or treated for three rounds of selection with ADCs or free
maytansine at concentrations that killed ~50% of the cells. Hits were identified using casTLE21
by comparing each treated condition to the untreated control (see Supplementary Table 2 for
complete list of hits).

To distinguish genes involved in the activity of maytansine from those influencing ADC trafficking
and processing, we compared hits identified in the free maytansine condition to hits obtained
using noncleavable anti-CD22-maytansine (Fig. 2b, supplementary Fig. 2). Genes identified in
both conditions, which includes most nuclear genes hits, are likely to mediate the killing activity
of maytansine. On the other hand, hits unique to the ADC are likely to influence mechanisms of
ADC trafficking, processing, or lysosomal escape. These include the target-antigen CD22,
intracellular trafficking regulators (RAB7A, WDR81, and WDR91), lysosomal cathepsins (CTSS
and CTSA), and lysosomal transporters (SLC46A3 and MFSD12), highlighting the importance
of lysosomal delivery and processing in ADC toxicity.

To investigate how particular linkers influence ADC toxicity, we compared the hits obtained using
the noncleavable linker ADC vs. the cleavable VC linker ADC (Fig 2C, supplementary Fig. 2).
As expected, CD22 along with hits identified in the free maytansine condition were common hits
for both ADCs. We did not identify specific proteases that are essential for toxicity of anti-CD22VC-maytansine, likely due to redundancy as the VC linker can be cleaved by multiple
cathepsins37. Strikingly, a subset of endolysosomal trafficking regulators were identified only to
be critical for toxicity of the noncleavable linker ADC but were dispensable for the cleavable
linker ADC, suggesting that lysosomal delivery may not be required for processing of VC linkers.

Lysosomal delivery is not required for processing of cleavable valine-citrulline-linked
ADCs
Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanistic differences of proteolytic processing and payload
release of noncleavable linker ADC and cleavable linker ADC. We first validated that the subset
of endosomal and lysosomal genes identified in our targeted screen are indeed specific to the
noncleavable linker ADC (SLC46A3, MFSD12, WDR81, WDR91, CTSA, CTSS and
C18orf8/RMC1) and have little effect on toxicity of the VC cleavable linker ADC in competitive
growth assays (Fig. 3a).

Because we find that toxicity of ADCs with cleavable VC linkers is not dependent on genes
regulating endosomal maturation or specific lysosomal proteases, we hypothesize that the VC
cleavable linker can be processed in earlier endosomal compartments, and may be able to

bypass defects in lysosomal delivery. To monitor ADC intracellular trafficking, we stably
expressed CD22 in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and monitored trafficking of a
fluorescently-labeled CD22 antibody. We found the ADC colocalized with an early endosomal
marker EEA1 at 15 minutes after treatment and began to colocalize with lysosomal marker
LAMP1 in approximately 1 hour (Fig. 3b). To detect cleavage and release of the payload, we
used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to detect
intracellular levels of the maytansinol cleavage product38 (Supplementary Fig. 3b and 3c). The
cleaved maytansinol product began to appear as early as 15 minutes post-treatment (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Fig. 3d, coinciding with the accumulation of anti-CD22 antibody in early
endosomes as assayed by microscopy, but prior to accumulation in the lysosome (Fig3b and
3c). The maytansinol product continued to accumulate over the course of the experiment
(Supplementary Fig. 3d). Notably, inhibition of V-ATPase using bafilomycin A139 prevents
maytansinol payload release, indicating that cleavage of the VC linker is dependent on proteases
that require proper acidification of endosomes and lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 3e).
Together, these results highlight the differences in processing of ADCs with noncleavable linker
and VC linker, and provide evidence that lysosomal delivery is not critical for toxicity of ADC with
a cleavable VC linkers.

C18orf8/RMC1 is required for endosomal trafficking and lysosomal delivery of ADCs
A top maytansine-independent hit in our screen was C18orf8/RMC1 (hereinafter referred to as
RMC1), a gene recently identified as an autophagy regulator acting in concert with MON1 and
CCZ1 to activate Rab740. As knockout of either RAB7A or RMC1 protects cells from ADCmediated toxicity (Fig. 3a), we hypothesized that RMC1 plays a role in endosomal maturation
through regulation of RAB7A activity, and that loss of RMC1 activity would prevent lysosomal
delivery of ADCs and cell death. To investigate the role of RMC1 in endolysosomal trafficking,
we first examined the localization of a C-terminal GFP-fused RMC1 in HeLa cells and found it
colocalizes with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. 4a), as previously reported. Next, we
knocked down RMC1 or RAB7A using CRISPR interference41 (CRISPRi) in HeLa cells. Loss of
RMC1 or RAB7A function both led to enlarged early endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4b),
accompanied by increased EEA1 and LAMP1 staining (Supplementary Fig. 4a). To determine
whether these changes in morphology affect cargo transport to the lysosomes, we monitored

trafficking of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a canonical endocytic cargo that traffics to the
lysosome using confocal microscopy. Indeed, in RMC1-knock down cells EGF trafficking to the
lysosome is markedly delayed and EGF accumulated in early endosomes (Fig. 4c). Consistently,
lysosomal degradation of EGFR upon EGF treatment was also impaired (Fig. 4d), confirming
the role of RMC1 in lysosomal delivery of endosomal substrates. Finally, to determine how
RAB7A activity influences the role of RMC1 in ADC toxicity, we tested whether overexpression
of constitutively active RAB7-Q67L re-sensitizes RMC1-deleted cells to noncleavable linker
ADCs. Indeed, RMC1-deleted cells overexpressing RAB7-Q67L were more sensitive to ADC
treatment than cells expressing GFP control (Fig. 4f). Together, these results support the
hypothesis that RMC1 is essential for ADC delivery and toxicity in a RAB7-dependent manner,
and more generally demonstrate a role for RMC1 in delivery of endocytic substrates to the
lysosome.

Inhibition of sialic acid synthesis sensitizes cells to CD22 ADC toxicity
Genes whose deletion sensitizes cancer cells to ADCs could potentially serve as targets for
combination therapies to increase ADC efficacy in the clinic. Although the genome-wide and
follow-up screens identified many genes and pathways required for ADC toxicity, we identified
relatively few genes whose deletion robustly sensitized cells to ADC treatment. We hypothesized
that this was due to either insufficient cell coverage (~1000 cells per sgRNA) or the high dose of
ADC used in the screens, both of which could limit the dynamic range of sensitization. We thus
repeated the screen at a higher cell coverage (~5000 cells per sgRNA) and with lower dose of
the noncleavable linker ADC (0.5 nM) to specifically search for sensitizing targets (Fig. 5a). To
prioritize identification of candidate combination therapy targets, we screened in a targeted
sublibrary highly enriched in known drug targets, kinases, and phosphatases. As we were most
interested in finding genes that influence ADC trafficking and processing, a free maytansine
treatment was also used as a counter-screen to filter out maytansine-dependent genes. As
expected, this design identified a number of strong sensitizing hits that were missed in the
genome-wide screen (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c; see Supplementary Table 3 for complete list of
hits).

Interestingly, the top two maytansine-independent sensitizing hits, GNE and CMAS, are both
members of the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Using
competitive growth assays, we validated that disruption of sialylation by knocking out GNE,
CMAS, or NANS (an additional pathway member not represented in the sublibrary) sensitizes
Ramos cells to the ADC treatment (Fig. 5c). In addition, chemical inhibition of sialylation with a
fluorinated sialic acid analog, peracetylated 3Fax-NeuAc42 (3F-NeuAc) also sensitized Ramos
cells to ADC killing (Fig. 5e). We confirmed the depletion of cell surface sialic acids in GNE,
CMAS and NANS-deleted cell (Fig. 5d), and also after treatment with 3F-NeuAc, by labelling
with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), a lectin that preferentially binds to sialic acid attached to
galactose through an α-2,6 linkage42(Supplementary Fig. 5e). Notably, the knockout cells are
also more sensitive to treatment with the cleavable linker ADC anti-CD22-VC-maytansine
(Supplementary Fig. 5f), suggesting that sensitization by inhibiting sialic acid synthesis may be
broadly useful for ADCs with both non-cleavable linkers and cleavable VC linkers.

To investigate whether the sensitizing effects of sialic acid depletion can be generalized to ADCs
with different targets and in different cell types, we tested whether pre-treatment with 3F-NeuAc
also sensitizes Her2-positive cancer cell lines to Her2-targeted ADC ado trastuzumab emtansine
(T-DM1). The combination of 3F-NeuAc and T-DM1 was more toxic than ADC alone in the Her2positive breast cancer lines SKBR3 and ZR-75-1 (Fig. 5f and 5g), and the gastric carcinoma line
NCI-C87 (Fig. 5h), indicating that the strategy of combining 3F-NeuAc and ADC may be useful
for multiple cancer antigen targets.

Depletion of sialic acid enhances ADC internalization rate
To identify which steps of ADC internalization and processing are modulated by sialylation, we
considered a number of models by which the cells could be sensitized. Inhibition of sialic acid
synthesis may: (1) increase ADC target antigen cell surface expression and/or ADC binding, (2)
enhance complement-mediated killing activity, or (3) increase the rate of ADC internalization.
First, we measured CD22 expression and antibody accessibility in Ramos cells, but 3F-NeuAc
treatment did not alter cell surface binding of anti-CD22 ADCs or whole cell CD22 protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6b). Second, we tested whether the increased killing is dependent
on complement activity, but the sensitizing effect of 3F-NeuAc was not abolished in media

depleted of active complement factors (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Using T-DM1, we observed
similar sensitization when the Her2-positive cell lines SKBR3 and ZR-75-1 were treated with 3FNeuAc in media depleted of active complement factors (Supplementary Fig. 6f and 6g).

Lastly, we tested was whether inhibiting sialylation alters the rate of ADC uptake. We assayed
ADC internalization by pHrodo-labeled anti-CD22 ADC. Cells depleted of sialic acids via either
genetic deletion of GNE (Supplementary Fig. 6c) or by 48-hour pre-treatment with 3F-NeuAc
(Fig. 6a) demonstrated increased rates of ADC uptake. In addition, pre-treatment of Ramos cells
with 3F-NeuAc for 48 hours increased the rate of maytansinol payload release from the CD22targeted ADC with VC cleavable linker as measured by LC/MS-MS (Supplementary Fig. 6d). To
determine whether the increased uptake rate is specific to CD22, we measured the rate of
internalization for an antibody targeting a different cell surface protein, CD79b, which has also
been shown to be an effective ADC target (Polson et al., 2007). As a control, we measured
uptake of pHrodo-labeled dextran, which is used as a marker of general fluid phase
endocytosis43. Interestingly, treatment of Ramos cells with 3F-NeuAc increased the rate of antiCD79 antibody uptake (Fig. 6b) but not dextran uptake (Supplementary Fig. 6g), suggesting that
inhibition of sialylation may influence antibody-mediated endocytosis specifically.

Finally, to determine whether the effects of 3F-NeuAc on ADC internalization rate can be
generalized to other ADCs and cancer cell types, we measured the rate of T-DM1 uptake and
payload release using LC/MS-MS44 in SKBR3 cells. Indeed, T-DM1 internalization rate is
enhanced in 3F-NeuAc pre-treated SKBR3 cells (Fig. 6c). In addition, increased accumulation
of T-DM1’s catabolite Lys-MCC-DM1 is also observed in 3F-NeuAc pre-treated SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 6d). Together, these results show that inhibition of sialylation is a generalizable strategy for
increasing ADC uptake, and provide rationale for combining ADCs and inhibition of sialic acid
biosynthesis to enhance the efficacy of ADC treatment.

Discussion
Here, we used CRISPR-knockout screens to evaluate the mechanism of toxicity for antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs) bearing non-cleavable and cleavable valine-citrulline (VC) linkers,
which are known to have critically different efficacies toward different tumors 4,12,15,16,45. We
identified many known and novel genetic modifiers of ADC toxicity, and uncovered critical roles
for a number of endolysosomal regulators in mediating the toxicity of ADCs. We identified
C18orf8/RMC1 as a gene required for endosomal maturation and lysosomal delivery of ADC.
Surprisingly, only a subset of the identified endolysosomal regulators are required for toxicity of
ADCs with cleavable VC linkers. We showed that this is because lysosomal delivery is not
required for payload cleavage from VC-linked ADCs, which contrasts with the prevailing wisdom
in the field. Finally, our studies revealed a role for sialic acids in regulating ADC uptake, and we
propose a novel combination therapy strategy that combines ADC with inhibition of sialic acid
biosynthesis to increase ADC delivery. In proof-of-principle studies, this strategy was effective
in increasing in vitro killing with both CD22- and Her2-targeting ADCs in multiple cancer cell
lines, including lymphoma, breast, and gastric cancer.

Although ADCs with noncleavable linkers are more stable and thus elicit less off-target toxicity
when used in vivo2,45, they are not effective against all ADC targets, and some tumors show
marked resistance to these agents4,16,45. Our work shows that noncleavable-linker ADCs show
greater reliance on late endosomal trafficking regulators (RAB7, RMC1, WDR81, and WDR91)
and lysosomal cathepsins (Cathepsins A, C, and S) for toxicity, whereas surprisingly ADCs with
VC-cleavable linkers (designed to be cleaved by cathepsin B), do not. Indeed, payload release
from VC-linked ADCs occurs within tens of minutes after ADC internalization, suggesting that
resistance to noncleavable ADCs due to impaired lysosomal delivery may be circumvented by
ADCs bearing cleavable VC linkers. These results may help explain why ADCs with cleavable
linkers are efficacious in a broader range of target cancers12,16 and remain toxic to cell lines
resistant to noncleavable linker ADCs46–49. Importantly, these genes regulating late endosomal
trafficking and processing of ADCs may serve as potential predictive biomarkers for resistance
against noncleavable linker ADCs.

Our work also identified a number of new regulators of endolysosomal trafficking, as well as new
roles for previously characterized genes. For example, we find that WDR81 and WDR91, genes
previously shown to be involved in endosomal maturation and autophagy29,30,50,51, are also
selectively required for trafficking of ADCs to the lysosome. In addition, we demonstrate a new
role for C18orf8/RMC1 in intracellular trafficking. This gene was recently identified to play a role
in autophagy, and was found in a complex with CCZ1 and MON140, which we also identify in our
screen. Here, we show that RMC1 is required for proper endolysosomal trafficking and
degradation of EGFR. Additionally, RMC1 mediates ADC delivery and toxicity in a RAB7Adependent manner, which is consistent with the reported role of RMC1 in RAB7A activation
during autophagic flux40.

Many of the hits identified in our study are required for ADC toxicity; therefore loss-of-function of
these genes may be potential resistance mechanisms for ADCs used in the clinic. For example,
decreased expression of SLC46A3, a lysosomal transporter we identified as critical for
cytotoxicity of the anti-CD22 noncleavable ADC, has been shown to be a mechanism of innate
and acquired resistance to other noncleavable ADCs targeting a wide range of antigenic targets
in patient-derived xenografts and primary multiple myeloma bone marrow samples 22,47,52.
Moreover, a major mechanism of acquired resistance to ADCs shown in in vitro models is altered
ADC trafficking and lysosomal function47,53,54, a signature that is also identified in our screens.

We found that inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis renders cells more sensitive to ADCs due to
an increased rate of ADC uptake in a wide range of cancer cell types. Previous studies have
shown that altering cell surface sialic acid levels can influence receptor uptake through disrupting
Siglec receptor clustering55, membrane fluidity56, or binding of cell surface glycans to the
extracellular galectin lattice57,58. Further research will be required to determine whether these
mechanisms play a role in influencing the rate of ADC uptake.

Because hypersialylation in malignant cells has been shown to be a mechanism of immune
evasion59–61, preclinical studies focusing on depleting tumor sialylation have developed several
promising therapeutic strategies62. One such example is the fluorinated sialic acid analogue we
used in our study, 3F-NeuAc. Our data show that combining 3F-NeuAc with either anti-CD22

ADCs or anti-Her2 ADC T-DM1 resulted in increased killing. Notably, 3F-NeuAc is effective in
reducing global glycan sialylation in mice but has deleterious “on-target” effects such as
impairing liver and kidney function 63. This systemic toxicity can be circumvented by intratumoral
injections of 3F-NeuAc, resulting in decreased tumor sialylation levels64. Another possible means
to implement this strategy would be to utilize targeted-glycan modification, in which sialidases
conjugated to antibodies are recruited to target cells to remove cell surface sialic acids 65. Our
work suggests that combining ADCs with these and other existing methods to deplete sialylation
in cancer cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy to increase ADC efficacy that warrants
further exploration. Together, our studies reveal mechanisms underlying ADC trafficking and
toxicity, provide insight for ADC design and a generalizable method to investigate the biology of
diverse ADCs, and identify candidate combination strategies that may improve therapeutic
efficacy.

Online Methods

Cell Culture
Ramos cells, SKBR3, ZR-75-1, and NCI-N87 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 Medium (11875093, Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Fisher, Cat# SH30910), 2 mM L-glutamine (Fisher,
Cat# SH3003401) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Fisher, Cat#SV30010). HeLa cells (ATCC)
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Life Technologies, Cat# 11995073)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were
cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in Ramos cells
Our previously established genome-wide, 10sgRNA/gene CRISPR-deletion library20 was
synthesized, cloned, and infected into Cas9 expressing Ramos cells as previously described 20.
Briefly, ~300 million Ramos cells stably expressing SFFV-Cas9-BFP were infected with the
CRISPR-knockout library at an MOI of 0.3-0.4. Cells expressing sgRNAs were selected for using
puromycin (1 µg/mL) for 3 to 4 days such that >90% of cells were mCherry positive as measured
by flow-cytometry. Selected cells are then allowed to recover and expand in puromycin-free
media for up to 7 days. Deep sequencing was used to confirm sufficient sgRNA representation
in the library.
For the screen, cells were split into two conditions, each in duplicate: an untreated control group
and ADC-treated group (2 nM anti-CD22-Asp-PEG2-maytansine). Cells are incubated with 2 nM
ADC for 48 hours for each round of treatment, after which the ADC was removed from media by
pelleting cells and re-suspending in fresh ADC-free media. This treatment occurred four times
over three weeks, with cells recovering to ~90% viability after each round of selection. Over the
course of the screen, cells were maintained at 500,000 cells/mL. At the end of the screen, 200
million cells were recovered from each condition and pelleted by centrifugation. Genomic DNA
of each condition was extracted using Qiagen DNA Blood Maxi kit (Cat#51194). The sgRNA
sequences were amplified and prepared for sequencing as previously described21. These
libraries were then sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq with ~40 million reads per condition;
~200X coverage per library element). Analysis and comparison of guide composition of ADC

treated versus untreated conditions were performed using casTLE as previously described20,21.
See Supplementary Table 1 for complete genome-wide screen result.

Targeted screens in Ramos cells
The secondary screen library targets a total of 850 genes (10 sgRNA per gene): all genes that
passed 10% FDR from the Ramos genome-wide screen (168 genes), genes previously
implicated in endolysosomal trafficking, and genes found to localize to lysosomes in a
proteomics study34, along with 1500 negative control sgRNAs (see Supplementary Table 5 for
complete list of genes and sgRNA). The library oligos were synthesized by Agilent Technologies
and cloned into pMCB320 using BstXI/BlpI overhangs after PCR amplification. The Cas9expressing Ramos cells were lentivirally infected with the secondary screen library at an MOI of
0.3-0.4 as previously described. After puromycin selection (1µg/mL for 3 days) and expansion,
cells were treated with either 2 nM anti-CD22-maytansine, 0.5 nM anti-CD22-VC-Maytansine,
0.2 nM free maytansine, or left untreated as control, each in duplicate at ~3000X coverage per
library element. Each treatment lasted 48 hours and was repeated four times over three weeks,
with cells recovering to ~90% viability after each round of selection. As with the genome-wide
screen, cells were maintained at 500,000 cells/mL throughout the screen. At the end of the
screen, 30 million cells were used for genomic extraction for each condition, sequenced (5-10
million reads per condition) and analyzed using casTLE. See Supplementary Table 2 for
complete sublibrary screen results.

Targeted screen for uncovering sensitizing hits
To uncover additional sensitizing hits, we used a library of ~2000 genes targeting known drug
targets, kinases and phosphatase in the human genome 20. The library was lentivirally infected
into Cas9-expressing Ramos cells at an MOI of 0.3-0.4 as previously described. After puromycin
selection (1 µg/mL for 3 days) and expansion, cells were treated with either 0.5 nM anti-CD22
noncleavable linker ADC, 0.1 nM free maytansine, or left untreated, each in duplicate at ~5000X
coverage per library element. Each treatment lasted 24 hours, killing 20-30% of cells. Cells were
allowed to recover to 90% survival after each treatment. The treatment was repeated three times
over two weeks. Cells were maintained at 500,000 cells/mL throughout the screen. At the end
of the screen, 50 million cells were used for genomic extraction for each condition and

sequenced with 10 million reads per condition. Hits were identified using casTLE. See
Supplementary Table 3 for complete screen result.

Competitive growth assays in Ramos cells
To validate results of genome-wide and secondary screens, we infected Cas9-expressing
Ramos cells with plasmids expressing both a single specific sgRNA and mCherry, as previously
described66 (See Supplementary Information for sgRNA sequences). The infected cells were
puromycin-selected for 3 days and allowed to recover for 2 days. Equal numbers of sgRNA/
mCherry-positive cells were cocultured with wildtype/ mCherry-negative cells, and were
subsequently treated with different ADCs at the same concentration used in the screens. The
percentage of mCherry-positive cells was quantified using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer after
72 hours. All results are normalized to ratio of control sgRNA/ mCherry-positive : wildtype/
mCherry-negative cells.

Western Blotting
Cells were lysed for 30min at 4C using protein extraction buffer (300mM NaCl, 100mL Tris pH
8, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1X cOmplete protease
inhibitor (Roche Cat#11697498001) and centrifuged to collect the supernatant lysate. Protein
concentration was measured by DC Protein Assay Kit (BioRad Cat# 5000111EDU), separated
on SDS-PAGE gels (Life Technologies Cat#NP0322BOX) and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (BioRad Cat#1620146). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit
monoclonal anti-EGFR (1:2000, Abcam ab52894) and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH
(1:10000, Fisher AM4300). Secondary antibodies used were: goat polyclonal anti-mouse IRDye
680RD (1:10000, Li-COR 925-68070) and goat-polyclonal anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW (1:10000,
Li-COR 925-32211). Images were acquired using the Li-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system.

Confocal microscopy
Cells were grown on glass coverslips or glass-well plates and were stained using standard
immunocytochemistry techniques. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin, and stained with the following
antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1 (1:1000, BD 610457) and rabbit

monoclonal anti-LAMP1 (1:1000, CST 9091S). Coverslips were mounted using VectaShield.
Images were acquired using Nikon Eclipse microscope with a 100x oil immersion objective.

Sample preparation and measurement of ADC catabolite by Liquid chromatography/ Mass
spectrometry (LC/MS-MS)
For each condition, 10 million Ramos cell, or 5 million HeLa cells were plated in 10cm dishes
and allowed to grow for 24 hours prior to addition of 10 nM anti-CD22-VC-maytansine or T-DM1.
At appropriate time points, cells were collected (trypsinized in the case of HeLa cells) and
pelleted. The cell pellets were washed 2x with PBS and extracted with 50% acetonitrile in water
containing 10 nM MMAE as internal standard. The cell/acetonitrile mixture was vortexed for 30
seconds, and allowed to rest on ice for 1 minute, and this vortex / rest step was repeated two
more times. The mixture was then left to shake at 4 °C for 15 minutes, incubated at -20 °C for 2
hours, and centrifuged at 10000g. The clarified supernatant was transferred to a new tube and
dried under N2 gas flow. The dried extract was reconstituted in 100uL 50% acetonitrile in water
prior to analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), which was
performed using an Agilent 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an Agilent Jet Stream
(AJS) electrospray ionization source. Analytes were separated on a ZORBAX RRHD Extend
C18 column (1.8 μm particle size x 2.1 mm diameter x 50 mm length) with by gradient elution at
a flow of 0.6 mL/min. The mobile phases were A: 0.1% formic acid in water and B: 0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile. Gradient conditions were: isocratic at 95% A for 0.2 min, followed by a linear
gradient from 5% to 95% B from 0.2 to 4 minutes, followed by an isocratic hold at 95% B for one
minute (4.2-5.2min), followed by immediate return to 5% A (5.2-5.3 min). The total run time was
6 min. The ion source conditions were: gas temperature at 250°C, gas flow at 12l/min, nebulizer
at 25psi, and sheath gas temperature and flow rate were at 300°C and 12l/min respectively.

Multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to monitor the analytes and internal standard. The
mass transition monitored for quantification were m/z 749.4 → 547.2 for maytansinol payload
released from VC linker, m/z 1103.6 → 547.2 for Lys-MCC-DM1, and m/z 718.5 → 686.5 for
MMAE. For Lys-MCC-DM1 and MMAE, we confirmed that observed chromatographic peaks
eluted at the same time as authentic standards. For the maytansinol payload released from the
VC linker, no authentic standard was available. During methods development, we used

additional MRMs m/z 749.4 → 485.2, 1103.6 → 485.2, and 718.5 → 152.1 to confirm the identity
of the released maytansinol payload, Lys-MCC-DM1, and MMAE respectively. Peak detection
and integration were performed with Agilent MassHunter software. For Fig. 3c, 6d, and
Supplementary Fig 3d, 3e, and 6d, the obtained ion counts in biological samples were
normalized to ion counts for the MMAE internal standard, and this ratio was normalized to cell
number.

ADC uptake assays in IncuCyte
For uptake assays with Ramos cells, cells were seeded at 10000 cells per well in poly-L-lysine
(0.1% w/v) coated 96-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Anti-CD22 ADC were labeled
with IncuCyte Human FabFluor-pH Red antibody labeling reagent (IncuCyte Cat#4722) by
mixing ADC and FabFluor reagent at molar ratio of 1:3 in RPMI media and incubating for 15 min.
The antibody-FabFluor mixture was added to cells to a final concentration of 4 µg/mL. The cell
plate is then transferred into an IncuCyte s3 and images were obtained with a 20x objective
every hour for 24 hours. Analysis were performed with IncuCyte s3 integrated software.

placed on ice and treated with EGF for 10 minutes. Cells were then washed with once with cold PBS and
internalization was initiated by pre-warmed media. Cells were fixed at indicated time and visualized by
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Scale bars, 10 μm.
d.
EGFR degradation in RMC1-knock down HeLa cells. Cells were treated with EGF for 10 min, and then EGFR
levels were examined at indicated time point by Western blot. EGFR levels were quantified with ImageJ software
(n=3; error bars, ± SEM).
e.
Overexpression of constitutively active RAB7A-Q67L restores sensitivity towards anti-CD22-maytansine
(noncleavable) in RMC1-knockout Ramos cells. Cells were treated with 1 nM anti-CD22 noncleavable linker ADC
and cell viability was analyzed after three days of ADC treatment by flow cytometry. Viability was as determined
by forward and side scatter of live gating of Ramos cells (n=3; Two-tailed t test, *P<0.05; error bars, ± SEM).

Figure 5: Inhibition of sialic acid synthesis sensitizes cells to CD22 ADC toxicity.
a.
Schematic for targeted screen for identifying sensitizing hits. Ramos cells expressing Cas9 were infected
with a lentiviral, sgRNA sublibrary targeting drug targets, kinases and phosphatases. Cells were then treated with
either 0.5 nM anti-CD22-maytansine, 0.1 nM free maytansine, or left untreated. The resulting populations were
subjected to deep sequencing and analysis. The screen was performed in duplicate and at 5000x coverage.
b.
Comparative analysis of results from anti-CD22 noncleavable linker ADC (0.5 nM) and free maytansine (0.1
nM) sublibrary screens performed at 5000X coverage.
c.
Validation of hits in Ramos cells using competitive-growth assays. Cells expressing sgRNAs for KO of
indicated genes (mCherry+) and control (mCherry-) were co-cultured in 1:1 ratio. Cells were either treated with
anti-CD22 noncleavable ADC or left untreated for three days. Resulting ratio of KO:control was determined using
flow cytometry (n=3; error bars, ± SEM).
d.
Levels of α-2,6 sialic acid on KO Ramos cells as measured by labeling with SNA, a lectin that preferentially
binds to α-2,6 sialic acid residues on N- and O-glycans (schematic illustrated in figure; red diamond: sialic acid/Sia,
yellow square: N-acetylglucosamine/GalNAc, yellow circle: galactose/Gal). SNA conjugated to AF488 was incubated
with cells on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed 3x with cold PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (n=3;
error bars, ± SEM).
e.
Cell viability Ramos cells treated with noncleavable ADC and 3F-NeuAc at different concentration. Cells
were first treated with 3F-NeuAc at indicated concentrations for 48 hours, then ADCs at indicated concentrations
were added. Cell viability, determined by forward and side scatter gating for live cells, was assayed 72 hours
post-ADC addition by flow cytometry (n=3; error bars, ± SEM).

Cell growth (normalized confluency %) of SKBR3 (f ), ZR-75-1 (g), and NCI-N87 (h) treated with 100 μM
3F-NeuAc, 2 nM T-DM1, or combination of both. Cells were pre-treated with 100 μM 3F-NeuAc for 48 hours,
followed by 72-hour incubation with 2 nM T-DM1. Confluency was determined by IncuCyte s3 Live cells analysis
system and normalized to maximum confluency of the untreated condition at the end of the 5-day experiment
(n=3; error bars, ± SEM).
