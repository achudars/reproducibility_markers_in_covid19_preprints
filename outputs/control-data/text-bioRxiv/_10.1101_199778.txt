Abstract
The plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal cortex constitute active platforms for a variety of
cellular processes. Recent work has shown that the remodeling acto-myosin network modifies local
membrane organization, but the molecular details are only partly understood due to difficulties with
experimentally accessing the relevant time and length scales. Here, we use interferometric scattering
(iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer
membrane. Using the magnitude of the interferometric contrast, which is proportional to molecular
mass, and fast acquisition rates we detect and image individual membrane attached actin filaments
diffusing within the acto-myosin network and follow individual myosin II filament dynamics. We quantify

myosin II filament dwell times and processivity as a function of ATP concentration, providing evidence
for the predicted ensemble behavior of myosin head domains. Our results show how decreasing ATP
concentrations lead to both increasing dwell times of individual myosin II filaments and a global change
from a remodeling to a contractile state of the acto-myosin network.

Introduction
The acto-myosin cortex is critical for the mechanical stability of the cell and the organization of the
adjacent plasma membrane. Several studies have shown that the cell cortex affects the dynamics and
mobility of membrane components (1–3) and there is increasing evidence that dynamic remodeling of
the acto-myosin network drives local flow and clustering of membrane molecules (4–7). The complexity
of the acto-myosin cortex and plasma membrane in live cells, however, makes it difficult to study the
molecular details of cortex-membrane interactions and to uncover the underlying mechanisms.
Reconstituted minimal systems, where fluorescently labeled proteins are visualized using confocal or
total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, provide a tractable way to study the dynamics of
two-dimensional, membrane-bound acto-myosin networks (8–11). These systems can adopt a range of
active states depending on ATP concentration, actin to myosin ratio, actin filament length distribution
and concentration (10, 11). Despite extensive theoretical and experimental analysis on the molecular
and macroscopic level, the processes that lead from a remodeling, fluid-like acto-myosin network at high
ATP concentrations to a contractile, solid-like network at low ATP concentrations remain poorly
understood.
Most experimental and theoretical studies of myosin motor properties rely on experiments with single
motor head domains. Recent advances in the theoretical understanding of myosin II filaments formed of
multiple head domains indicate that small changes in the single-head duty ratio can lead to a switch from
non-processive to processive behavior due to cooperative effects (12–15). To experimentally test the

dynamics and properties of multi-headed myosin II filaments, it is necessary to visualize the network
components with a sub-second time-resolution over timescales of tens of minutes, which has been
challenging to achieve with fluorescent probes due to photo-bleaching and photo-toxicity.
Here, we employed interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy (16, 17), a label-free imaging
technique that relies on the interference between reflected and scattered light from nano-objects near
an interface. The key advantages of light scattering over fluorescence detection in this context are the
lack of an upper limit to fluorescence emission rate and the absence of photobleaching and thus
photobleaching, enabling long observation times at high acquisition rates (> 1kHz). We quantify
microscopic quantities, such as actin filament diffusion rates, myosin filament dwell times and
processivity, while simultaneously monitoring mesoscopic phenomena such as network flows and
clustering. This allows us to link changes in the mechanochemical properties of myosin II filaments to
transitions in the acto-myosin network, namely from the remodeling to the contractile state.

Results
Detection and characterization of actin and myosin filaments
The critical step to use label-free imaging to the study of acto-myosin dynamics on a membrane requires
detection and distinguishing actin from myosin II filaments. Due to the absence of crowding factors or
excess proteins in our experiments, the actin and myosin II filaments were the principal sources of light
scattering after subtraction of background signatures originating from cover glass roughness (Fig. 1A, Fig.
S1A) (see methods). Actin and myosin II filaments landing on bare glass slides exhibited contrasts of 0.058 ± 0.015 and -0.12 ± 0.013, respectively (Fig. 1B-D). This difference in interferometric contrasts
reflects the lower mass of actin compared to myosin II filaments per unit length (mF-actin / mmyoII = 0.42)
(18–20) and the scaling of the interferometric signal with molecular mass (21). Myosin II filaments

exhibited an apparent average length of 520 ± 130 nm (N=269) (Fig. S1B) as reported earlier (10). The
clear difference in interferometric contrast and the characteristic, uniform shape of myosin II filaments
provided a good basis to distinguish them reliably from actin filaments.
Turning to supported lipid bilayers (SLB), we characterized the formation of actin networks. After directly
observing successful SLB formation (Video 1), incubation with an actin-membrane linking protein (decahistidine tagged Ezrin-actin binding domain) (22) and addition of actin filaments (see methods), we
observed, that the SLB did not alter the contrast of actin filaments and that regions exhibiting
consecutive deposition of multiple actin filaments within a diffraction-limited spot displayed a step-wise
increase in the interferometric signal (Fig. S1C-D; Video 2). Based on the local contrast, we estimated
that, under the conditions used here ([G-actin] = 100-350 nM), the actin layers are 1 to 6 filaments thick,
with 2 filaments per diffraction-limited spot being most frequent (Fig. S1E). Evaporation was below 5%
during a period of 60 minutes, so that salt and protein concentrations can be considered to be constant
over the time course of a typical experiment (Fig. S1F)
The mobility of actin filaments depends strongly on the number of tethering points to the SLB and on its
fluidity. As a result, actin filaments longer than 5 µm are essentially static in the absence of external
forces (e.g. by myosin motors), whereas short actin filaments exhibited higher mobility (23) (see
supplementary information). Offline background subtraction to remove static actin network components
revealed the mobile filament fraction, with free diffusion for actin filaments shorter than 1.5 µm (Fig. 1E,
F; S1G, Video 3) and confined diffusion for filaments longer than 1.5 µm (Fig. 1G-H, S1H, Video 4). To
compare the mobility of different actin filaments, we measured the slope of the mean-squared
displacement over time for time-intervals longer than 5s. The reduced mobility of longer filaments
especially in their displacement perpendicular to the filament orientation (see Fig. 1G,

MSD٣) indicates

confinement by static components of the actin network and is typical for reptation of a flexible polymer
within a meshwork in 2D (24).

Binding dynamics of myosin II filaments to actin
We then characterized myosin II filament binding to membrane-bound actin networks at 100 µM ATP (t=
1 min), which fuels continuous network remodeling, and at t = 16 min, when ATP concentration dropped
below 10 µM ATP leading to network contraction, as described previously (11, 25, 26) (Fig. S2A, B; Video
5). It is to note, that the change in network contractility was due to changes in the available ATP, and
addition of fresh ATP could reverse the strong binding of myosin II filaments (Video 6). By creating
kymographs along the tracks of myosin II filaments (Fig. S2C, D; Video 7), we found that the distribution
of myosin II dwell times on F-actin followed a double-exponential decay function. At t = 1 min, the
computed time constants were τoff1 = 1.23 s ([1.36 s - 1.12 s]95%) and τoff2 = 12.6 s ([14 s - 11.3 s]95%) with
66% - 71% of the events being described by τoff1 (Fig. 2A). At t = 16 min, the myosin II filament dwell time
constants were τoff1 = 3.7 s ([3.1 s - 4.2 s]95%) and τoff2 = 11.9 s ([9.4 s - 15.5 s]95%) with 63 % - 87 % of the
events being described by τoff1 (Fig. 2B). The observation that the dwell time distributions seem to follow
a double exponential function might be due to the separate or simultaneous binding of the two ends of
myosin filaments to actin (see discussion)(28).
We went on to analyze the motion of myosin II filaments. At t = 1min, the mobile myosin II filaments
exhibited a velocity distribution that can be described by a sum of two Gaussians with >60 % of myosin II

filaments travelling at vmyoII,1 = 0.04 (±0.03) μm s and the remaining at vmyoII,2 = 0.20 (±0.13) μm s (Fig.
2C). The corresponding run length distribution decays exponentially with a characteristic run length of λ
= 0.23 (±0.03) μm (Fig. 2D). Plotting run length versus dwell time (i.e. total time of attachment during
which the run happened) shows a moderate positive correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.38) for dwell
times < 3 s and a weak negative correlation (Pearson coefficient -0.17) for longer binding times (Fig. 2E,
Fig. S2E). This implies that the population corresponding to short dwell times is mobile while the
population with long dwell times exhibits slow, reduced motion and eventually becomes immobilized.

At t = 16 min, mobile myosin II filaments travelled with an average velocity of vmyoII = 0.46 (±0.20) μm s

-1

(Fig. 2F, single Gaussian distribution) and the characteristic run length is λ = 1.03 (±0.05) μm (Fig. 2G).
The correlation between run length and dwell time is stronger compared to t = 1 min with most myosin II
filaments exhibiting persistent motion for up to 6 s (Pearson coefficient 0.57) and a loss of this
correlation at longer dwell times (Pearson coefficient -0.18) (Fig. 2H, Fig. S2F).
To assess whether the measured velocities were a combination of myosin and actin network motion, we
applied a 50 frames median filter (corresponding to 10s) filtering out the fast-moving myosin II filaments
and highlighting actin filament motion. The largest actin network displacements that we could observe
-1

occurred only locally and sporadically and did not exceed 50 nm s in the contractile state (t = 16 min)
-1

and 15 nm s in the remodeling state at t = 1 min (Fig. S2G). These observations are in agreement with
earlier studies (8, 11) and underline that myosin II filament velocities result directly from motor activity
on actin.

Myosin II filament tracking reveals links between binding mode, orientation and mobility
Given the characteristic shape of myosin filaments and the signal-to-noise ratio achievable with iSCAT
microscopy, we performed single-particle tracking (SPT) to corroborate the above measurements and to
analyze the dynamics of individual myosin II filaments as a function of time. By analyzing the intensity
distribution of pixels belonging to each myosin II filament, we could extract the particle location and
orientation for each time point. Tracks were generated based on criteria including the particle size and
the maximum step size between frames (see supplementary text for details of the SPT routine). In
addition, quantifying the MSD of particles and computing the correlation in displacements between
adjacent timesteps, individual myosin II filament tracks could be divided into periods of diffusive and
processive motion (Fig. S3A-E, Video 8). We used the average MSD and correlation data at t = 1 min (100
µM ATP) as a threshold to classify individual tracks. The motion we classify as diffusive most likely

represents a weakly interacting state of myosin II filaments with actin filaments with increased angular
orientation fluctuations and little displacement, as fully detached myosin II filaments would escape the
imaging plane rapidly.
This automated detection method provided a more comprehensive picture of myosin II filament
dynamics in the remodeling state at t = 1 min (100 µM ATP) and at the contractile state (t = 16 min) (Fig.
3A, B) as well as increased the sensitivity for short binding. At t = 1 min (100 µM ATP), we found
characteristic binding times of τoff1 = 0.34 s (0.33 s- 0.35 s), τoff2 = 2.26 s (2.13 s - 2.41 s) and τoff3 = 10.9 s (9
s – 12.8 s) and at t = 16 min τoff1 = 0.41 s (0.39 s - 0.43 s), τoff2 = 2.46 s (2.33 s - 2.63 s) and τoff3 = 11 s (10 s
– 12.5 s) (Fig. 3C). As observed above, the characteristic binding times were slightly longer, and the
number of events with binding times longer than 3 s increased 1.6-fold and more when comparing the
remodeling state to the contractile state (Fig. S3F). The increase in long duration binding events in the
contractile state could be an underestimate as only binding-unbinding cycles occurring within the
recording time were considered and myosin II filaments traveling into clusters or out of the field of view
were discarded.
Interestingly, we observed a larger increase in the fraction of processively moving myosin II (Nproc/N =
221/35644 at t = 1 min; Nproc/N = 640/35358 at t = 16 min). Concomitantly, analyzing individual tracks of
myosin II filaments revealed that the fraction of total bound time spent performing processive motion
increased from 0.3 (±0.2) at t = 1 min to 0.5 (±0.3) at t = 16 min (Fig. 3D, S3G). These results indicate that
the contractile state is driven by both an increased total number of processively moving myosin II
filaments and a higher persistence of each myosin II filament. To assess, whether the properties of
individual myosin motors changed during the course of the experiment, we analyzed the step size
distribution of all recorded tracks. However, there were no detectable changes over the course of the
transition from remodeling to contractile state (Fig. S3H). By computing the angle α between myosin II
filament orientation and its velocity direction for each myosin II filament step, we found that α varied

significantly (± 45° FWHM) at t = 1 min, whereas it narrowed with increasing time to ±25° (FWHM) at t =
16 min (Fig. 3E, S3I). Importantly, at t = 16 min, the majority of processively moving myosin II filaments
are aligned with their direction of propagation (Fig. 3F, S3J). This indicates that the increased processivity
is not linked to changes in the step size or rate of myosin II filaments but is due to improved alignment
with the actin tracks supporting long range transport and buildup of persistent material flows and
directed forces that can drive network contraction. A decrease in α at t = 16 min could be due to higher
numbers of myosin head domains binding to actin filaments, however, the high rotational flexibility of
individual head domains provides enough flexibility to allow the myosin filament to connect multiple
actin filaments important to generate network contraction. We only considered tracks of myosin II
filaments that were moving individually and that any events including the merging of multiple myosin II
filaments or moving of myosin II filaments into clusters were disregarded which might result in a slight
underestimation of the number of processive myosin II filaments.

Myosin II filament flows generate transiently stable contractile zones
In acto-myosin networks that reached their contracted state, we observed the formation of contractile
zones, into which myosin II filaments moved continuously from multiple directions. These contractile
zones were characterized by a cluster of myosin II filaments in their center holding multiple actin
filaments together. Interestingly, despite the steady flow of myosin II filaments into the clusters, they did
not seem to grow significantly. After subtracting the median image of the image sequence showing a
cluster region, it became evident that myosin II filaments detached once they reached the core of the
cluster preventing overall growth of the myosin II filament cluster (Fig. 4A, B; Video 9). This could be due
to the lack of free actin filaments and mechanical tension inside the clusters forcing excess myosin
filaments to leave the zone.

Simulations indicate a connection between increased fraction of myosin II filaments with long
attachment times and the transition to a contractile network state
To test whether the observed changes in myosin II filament fractions with longer dwell times are indeed
driving the acto-myosin network contraction, we ran simulations using Cytosim (cytosim.org), an open
source simulation engine that models acto-myosin network dynamics based on Brownian dynamics (29).
Following published simulation templates (30), actin filaments were represented by a set of equidistant
points with a characteristic bending rigidity of 7.3 10

domains connected by a short, stiff rod (50 nm, 300 Nm/rad rotational stiffness). The motors followed a
linear force-speed dependency (30) and two types of motors were introduced to match our experimental
observations (Cytosim cannot model multiheaded muscular myosin II filaments): type 1 with a short

nm s and Fmax, 2 = 6 pN . Simulations were computed for a circular field of 12 µm radius containing 400
actin filaments of 4 µm length and a combination of type 1 and type 2 motors reflecting the
experimental conditions in terms of actin filament and motor protein density. Starting with 1200 type 1
motors and increasing the number of type 2 motors, we found that the network shifted from a
remodeling to a more contractile state when the ratio of type 2 to type 1 motors reached 1:20 or higher
(Fig. 4C, Video 10, 11). Using higher numbers of type 2 motors accelerates the contraction process,
which implies that the long binding motors are better crosslinkers than the short binding motors. To test,
whether this effect was simply due to the increase in motors, we ran the simulations with 1500 type 1
motors and 0, 50 or 80 type 2 motors and did not observe network contraction with type 1 motors only
but observed again a clear tendency to clustering at motor ratios above 20:1 (Fig. S4A, Video 12). The
simulations were in agreement with our experimental observations of actomyosin networks first
displaying remodeling behavior followed by contractions into multiple small asters converging finally into
one cluster (Video 5). Taken together, this suggests that the dual behavior of myosin II filaments acting

as motors and crosslinkers is important to drive clustering of acto-myosin networks and that crossing a
critical threshold of a relatively small number of long binding, cross-linking myosin II filaments mediates
the transition from the remodeling to the contractile state (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Studying myosin II filament dynamics inside a membrane-bound, dynamic actin network provides
insights on how mesoscale network dynamics are related to minute changes of the physico-chemical
properties of motor head domains in myosin II filaments. Our approach demonstrates that a change in
myosin II filament dwell times is related to a change of the acto-myosin network from a remodeling to a
contractile state. This is underlined by the observation that myosin II filaments move faster and more
processively in the contractile state than in the remodeling state at 100 µM ATP. Myosin II filaments can
be under mechanical load depending on the actin network organization and our observations of myosin
II filament dynamics corroborate predictions made by theoretical studies (15, 32).
Given the large number of myosin head domains within a single myosin II filament, we would expect
complex binding behavior with multiple characteristic attachment times. Our data, however, shows that
myosin II filament binding is determined by 3 major time scales: τoff0 in the range of 0.3-0.4 s, τoff1 in the
2-3 s range and τoff2 in the 10 s range. The shortest time scale likely corresponds to the binding unbinding of a single myosin head domain (33). Considering the dumbbell structure of myosin II
filaments, we attribute τoff1 to the binding of myosin head domains at one side of the dumbbell, whereas
τoff2 would represent the simultaneous binding of myosin heads from both sides. This model explains the
behavior of myosin filaments at low [ATP] concentrations, where they are better aligned along the
direction of processive motion. As the trailing end of a myosin filament wanders off axis less than at high
[ATP], it is less likely to encounter another actin filament and form a crosslink. Therefore, at low ATP
concentrations, we observe a reduction of long dwells with short run lengths. Once the myosin filaments

reach the plus end of an actin filament, however, the increased processivity will contribute to the
condensation of actin filaments by the motors’ free end catching and pulling adjacent actin filaments.
This promotes the formation of contractile zones in more crowded regions of the actin filament network.
The effect of myosin II filaments cross-bridging multiple actin filaments on network contractility and
entropy production was also reported by the Murrell group (34).
The large temporal dynamic range of iSCAT microscopy allowed us to reveal the dynamics within actomyosin clusters. Interestingly, at low but not limiting ATP concentrations, myosin II filaments
continuously moved into the clusters, probably detaching upon reaching the clusters’ center. From
single-molecule studies on different myosin isoforms it is known that mechanical load increases the
dwell times of myosin heads on actin filaments (35, 36). For processive motor ensembles such as myosin
II filaments it was predicted that this would lead to increased run lengths on actin (15, 32). Due to actomyosin network dynamics and contraction of actin filaments into asters, myosin filaments that crosslink
actin filaments between two asters might experience high mechanical load, which increases their dwell
times and promotes processive motion. Once a myosin II filament reaches the center of a cluster,
however, it will experience a sudden drop in mechanical load due to a lack of available actin filaments for
interfilament crosslinks leading to detachment. This intrinsic mechano-regulation may contribute in the
formation of constituently contractile zones, which could drive the clustering of actin-binding membrane
proteins as observed in cells (4). A detailed comparison of our data with theoretical models (15, 32) is in
preparation. This will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to extended
dwell times as well as the effect of mechanical load at different ATP concentrations.
Together with the Cytosim based simulations, our experimental observations indicate that a combination
of motors with different dwell times, promoting different modes of myosin interaction with the actin
network, could provide a simple and biologically feasible strategy for a biological system to switch
between a remodeling (fluid-like) and a contractile (solid-like) state. Short dwell times of myosin

filaments limit the interaction with actin filaments leading to weak interaction and lack of persistent
motion with little effect on the actin network. Intermediate binding times lead to processive motion
along single actin filaments at high velocities, generating advective flows of myosin filaments, but with
only occasional binding to other actin filaments and hence only local remodeling of the actin network. In
contrast, long dwell times increase the chance of myosin filaments to crosslink multiple actin filaments,
rendering myosin filaments immobile, but causing large-scale network contractions and actin filament
flows through persistent motor action (Fig. 4D). The importance of the control of network crosslinking as
a way to change network contractility can be understood in terms of percolation theory (37), and its
relevance for the understanding of diseases was for example shown for the actin crosslinker α-actinin
(38).

Materials and Methods
Purified Proteins
Actin was purified from chicken breast following the protocol from Spudich and Watt (39) and kept on
ice in monomeric form in G-buffer (2 mM Tris Base, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM TCEP-HCl, 0.04% NaN3, 0.1 mM
CaCl2, pH 7.0) (11). The experiments using iSCAT microscopy were performed with myosin II obtained
from chicken breast following a modified protocol from Pollard (40) and kept in monomeric form in myobuffer (500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0). The day prior to experiments,
functional myosin II proteins were separated from proteins containing dead head domains by a round of
binding and unbinding to F-actin at a 5:1 actin to myosin ratio (switch from no ATP to 3 mM ATP)
followed by a spin at 60,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 ⁰C in a TLA100.3 rotor. The supernatant containing
functional myosin II is dialyzed against myo-buffer overnight and used for experiments for up to three
days.

To control the length of actin filaments, we titrated purified murine capping protein to the actin
polymerization mix. The purification of capping protein was described earlier (11). To link actin to the
SLB, we used a construct containing 10x His domains followed by a linker (KCK) and the actin binding
domain of Ezrin (HKE) as described earlier (11).

Supported Lipid Bilayer and Experimental Chamber Preparation
Glass coverslips (#1.5 borosilicate, Menzel, Germany) for SLB formation were cleaned with Hellmanex III
(Hellma Analytics, Mühlheim, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions followed by thorough
rinses with EtOH and MilliQ water, blow dried with N2 and finally passed briefly over a Bunsen burner
flame. For the experimental chamber, 0.2 ml PCR tubes (Tarsons Products, Kolkata, India) were cut to

(NOA88, Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ) and three minutes curing by intense UV light at 365 nm (PSDUV8T, Novascan, Ames, IA). Freshly cleaned and assembled chambers were directly used for
experiments.

Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) containing 98% DOPC and 2% DGS-NTA(Ni ) lipids were formed by fusion
of small uni-lamellar vesicles (SUV) as described earlier (11). Prior to experiments with F-actin we formed
SLBs in chambers filled with 100 µl KMEH (50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2).
SLB formation was observed live using ISCAT microscopy, to ensure that sufficient SUVs fused to form a
uniform, fluid lipid bilayer without holes (Video 1).

Formation of Acto-Myosin Network
In a typical experiment, SLBs were formed, incubated with 10 nM HKE for 40 min and washed three
times with KMEH. During this incubation time, F-actin was polymerized. First 10%vol of 10x ME buffer

ions with Mg . Addition of 2x KMEH buffer supplemented with 2 mM Mg-

ATP induced F-actin polymerization at a final G-actin concentration of 5 µM. After 20-30 min incubation,
the desired amount of F-actin was added to the SLBs using blunt-cut 200 µl pipette tips. An incubation of
30 min allowed the F-actin layer to reach an equilibrium state of binding to the SLB. For the addition of
myosin II filaments to the sample, intermediate dilutions of myosin II proteins were prepared in milliQ
water at 10 times the final concentration from fresh myosin II stock (4 mM, 500mM KCl) in a test tube
and incubated for 5 min to allow the myosin II filament formation. Then, 1/10 of the sample buffer was
replaced with the myosin II filament solution and supplemented with Mg-ATP (100 mM) at 0.1 mM final
concentration. Afterwards, the dynamics of the acto-myosin system were observed for up to 60 min. The
system usually showed a remodeling behavior for the first 10-15 min before contraction and aster
formation started (due to ATP concentrations below 10 µM as estimated from the activity of myosin II
and earlier reports (25)). Once, the system reached a static, jammed state and no myosin activity could
be observed, the system could be reset into a remodeling state by addition of Mg-ATP (100 mM) to a
final concentration of 0.1 mM (Video 10). Each step of this procedure was performed on the microscope
stage, which allowed us to check its state continuously. The open chamber design allowed the addition
of each component from the top without induction of flows that would perturb the actin network. All
experiments were performed at room temperature (22° C
Details about the actin, myosin and ATP concentrations used in each experiment can be found in table
(S1).

iSCAT microscopes
Interferometric scattering microscopy was performed on two different home-built setups similar to
those detailed in (41, 42). Briefly, a weakly focused laser beam was scanned across the sample over an

area of 24 x 24 µm (445 nm laser) or 32.6 x 32.6 µm (635 nm laser). The light reflected from the glasswater interface together with the scattered light from the sample was imaged onto a CMOS camera (445
nm laser: Point Grey GS3-U3-23S6M-C, Flir, Canada; 635 nm laser: MV-D1024-160-CL-8, Photonfocus,
Switzerland). The cameras were controlled using home-written LabVIEW software. The setup with the
445 nm laser had a 3.5 mm partially reflective mirror placed in the re-imaged back focal plane of the
objective for enhanced scattering contrast as described in (42). The videos were recorded at 50 fps (445
nm laser) and 25 fps (635 nm laser), and pre-averaged by a factor of 5 to reduce noise. The illumination

intensity on the sample (445 nm laser: 250 W/cm ; 635 nm laser: 1.9 kW/cm ) was set to nearly saturate
the camera with the returning light. The pixel sizes were 23.4 nm/pixel (445 nm laser) and 31.8 nm/pixel
(635 nm laser).

Image processing
Non-sample specific illumination inhomogeneities, fixed-pattern noise and constant background were
removed from the raw images by dividing each of them with a flat field image that contained only these
features. The flat field image was computed by recording 2000 frames of the sample while moving the
stage. For each pixel, a temporal median was calculated resulting in a flat field image that only contained
static features.

Median filtering
Movies were median filtered using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). For each image sequence,
the median is computed for each pixel, subtracted from the original image sequence and the median
filtered image sequence as well as the computed median filter are saved.

Actin filament tracking
Actin filaments that became visible after median filtering and that did not cross other actin filaments for
at least 1000 frames were tracked using image J (http://imagej.nih.gov) and the plugin JFilament (43,
44). The obtained tracking traces were analyzed using MATLAB to compute the position of the center of
mass (CM) and the filament orientation for each time point and to generate plots of the CMs total mean
square displacement as well as the parallel and perpendicular components of the mean square
displacement with respect to the filament orientation.

Actin filament length measurements
Image stacks of actin filaments landing on the HKE decorated SLBs were taken at 10 Hz immediately after
addition of actin filaments to the sample. Theses image stacks were split in segments of 10 s and the
median of each segment was subtracted from its last frame, to visualize freshly landed, isolated actin
filaments. The images were then converted from the 32-bit interferometric contrast values to 8-bit (by
the formula f(x) = 1000*(-x) + 1000), bandpass filtered (low pass: 3 pixel, high pass: 20 pixel) and
analyzed with the image J plugin Neuron J (45). Images of fluorescent actin filaments landing on HSE
decorated SLBs shortly after their addition to the sample were directly converted to 8-bit and analyzed
with Neuron J

Myosin II filament length measurements
Intensity line-scans along the long axis of single myosin filaments were taken and the distance between
the half maximum points at both ends were taken as the length of the myosin II filament.

Myosin binding dynamics

Imaging with 5-10 Hz for several minutes was sufficient to capture a broad range of myosin filament
dynamics with high accuracy. To remove any signal originating from static structures such as immobile
actin filaments or small impurities in the SLB, the image sequences were median filtered (46). In a second
step, a maximum projection of the time series was used to visualize the tracks occupied by myosin II
filaments during the experiment. Lines following these tracks were then used to compute kymographs
depicting the myosin II filament binding times and their motion along actin filaments (kymograph tool in
Image J, line width 3). Dwell time, run length and velocity distributions were plotted and further
analyzed using OriginPro 2018 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) and MATLAB. Best fitting
functions for the myosin II filament dwell times were selected using MEMLET, which estimates the
maximum likelihood of a fitting function to describe a data point distribution (47).

Detection and Tracking
Image analysis and single particle tracking (SPT) was carried out using ImageJ and Python code
developed for this work (more detailed descriptions of the computational
methods are provided in the Supplementary Information, code is available upon request).

(t = 1 min: green; t = 16 min: purple); best fits for the distributions were computed with the MEMLET
fitting routine: triple exponential decay with tmin = 0.3s (solid line), boundaries depict 95% confidence
level. D) Box plot depicting the ratio of processive time versus total dwell time for each processively
moving myosin II filament (N(1min) = 221; N(16min) = 640). E) Radial histogram depicting the angular
difference α between myosin II filament orientation and its velocity vector for all detected myosin II
filament steps. F) Radial histogram plot depicting the ratio of processive steps versus all detected steps
for each angular difference α, indicating that there is a clear increase of filaments that are aligned along
their axis of propagation in the contractile state.

Figure 4, dynamics within acto-myosin clusters: A) Image sequence depicting the dynamics of myosin II
filaments within an acto-myosin cluster; to make the dynamics in the cluster visible, the time median of
the image sequence was subtracted from each frame; 635nm iSCAT setup, scale bar 2 µm. B) Graph
depicting the change of interferometric contrast from the time median of the regions depicted in (A)
inside (green) and outside (magenta) the cluster. C) Snapshots at t = 60 s of simulations of acto-myosin
networks using Cytosim with two types of myosin motors with dwell times at τ1 = 2.4 s (green) and at τ2 =
10.9 s (red) at ratios indicated in the right top corner mimicking protein concentrations used in

D) Schematic summarizing the different observed binding modes of myosin II filaments and their
assumed effect on the acto-myosin network dynamics and organization.

Table 1, experimental conditions: List of the experimental conditions used in the examples depicted in
Figs. 1–5. The table contains the concentration of G-actin, capping protein (CP), myosin II proteins and
ATP as well as the average length of actin filaments attached to SLBs, which was measured before the
addition of myosin II. Sample size for filament length measurements: N = 505 (Fig.1E-H), N = 151 (Fig 2, 3,
4), N = 255 (Fig S1B), N = 255 (Fig S2A, B).
