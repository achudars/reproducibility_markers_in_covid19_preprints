Abstract
Purpose The LipidCardio Study was established for in-depth analyses of
cardiovascular risk factors, providing well-defined cardiovascular and metabolic
phenotypes. Particularly the role of lipoproteins in the pathobiological process and
treatment of cardiovascular disease will be a main focus.
Participants 1.005 individuals aged 21 years and older undergoing cardiac
catheterization during 17 months at a tertiary academic cardiology center were
enrolled. The baseline data set contains detailed phenotyping, broad biochemical
parameters, genetic data, but also standardized personal and family history, a
screening test for cognitive impairment, pulse wave analysis and measurements of
hand grip strength, amongst others. Blood samples were stored in a biobank for future
analyses.
Findings to date The mean age of the participants at enrolment was 70.9±11.1
years (70% male). Coronary angiography provided evidence of obstructive coronary
artery disease (CAD) in 69.9% of participants. Those with evidence of CAD were
significantly more likely to be male, inactive, diabetic and with a family history of
cardiovascular disease than participants without CAD.
20% of patients had lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations above 106.9 nmol/L (fifth
quintile). These patients had significantly increased odds of obstructive CAD compared
to participants in quintiles 1-4 (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.48, p=0.005). There was
reasonable evidence that with increasing severity of CAD the odds of having elevated
Lp(a) increased. We were able to replicate the established strong association between
specified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LPA gene (rs10455872,
rs3798220 and rs186696265) and the APOE gene (rs7412), and the concentration of
Lp(a), validating our phenotype database and biobank.

Introduction
Ischemic heart disease accounts for > 20% of all deaths in Europe. [1] Although ageadjusted mortality rates from coronary artery disease (CAD) have declined
substantially in the past decades throughout Europe and the US, the incidence and
prevalence of CAD remain high. [2, 3] Accordingly, 27% of all disability-adjusted life
years (DALYs) in Germany are due to coronary artery disease.[1]
It is well established that traditional modifiable risk factors for CAD (hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, sedentary lifestyle, obesity smoking, and diabetes) predict the
risk of developing CAD, and targeting them decreases cardiovascular risk in a dosedependent manner.[4] However, among patients with prevalent CAD, it has been
shown that there is substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of outcomes, with a
large proportion of individuals with a 10-year risk <10%, but also a considerable
proportion with very high residual risk despite optimally controlled risk factors.[5]
Therefore, the identification and consideration of additional modifiable risk factors to
reduce (residual) cardiovascular risk is crucial, and novel biomarkers, and assessment
of the individual genetic profile bear the potential of improving risk assessment for
primary and secondary prevention. Since patients with prevalent CAD are a very
heterogeneous group, discrimination is likely to be advantageous over a one fits all
disease management strategy.
Dyslipidemia is a major cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition to
low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] has emerged as an
independent risk factor for CAD. [6] Whereas the causal role of LDL-C is well
established, Lp(a) is less well understood and still a subject of controversy. [6, 7]
The underlying physiological function of this lipoprotein is still unknown. Several
studies have indicated that serum/plasma Lp(a) is largely genetically determined, and
there is strong suggestion that Lp(a) is causally associated with CAD.[8] Prospective

observational studies have shown that Lp(a) was an independent risk factor for major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), i.e. the progression of CAD in patients with
stable CAD who received optimal medical therapy, and that Lp(a) levels were positively
associated with coronary lesion severity as well.[7, 9]

Screening for elevated Lp(a) presently is recommended in those at intermediate or
high CV risk, in particular as an additional risk indicator.[7, 10, 11] Moreover, Lp(a) has
been suggested as a potential therapeutic target.[12] To note, an antisense
oligonucleotide specific to apo(a) has been recently shown to lead to dose-dependent
reductions in average Lp(a) levels of >80%.[13]

Overall, substantial progress has been made in the field of CAD in the last decades.
However, further improvements will presuppose careful characterization of different
phenotypes and subsequent joint application of genetics, epigenetics and
metabolomics. For this purpose we established the LipidCardio Study in 2016. We
sought to implement detailed phenotyping and follow-up of patients with different
severity of CAD and also without obstructive CAD to examine factors associated with
the pathobiological process and progression of CVD. There will be a strong focus on
lipoproteins and genetics. In particular, we seek to gain further insight into the role of
Lp(a) in cardiovascular pathogenesis and to investigate the implications of a screening
for Lp(a) in a high risk cohort of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and
coronary angiography. Combining phenotype factors with genetic factors, we desire to
elaborate the particular cardiovascular risk profile of patients with high Lp(a).
As another integral part of this study we collected ample blood specimens to hold highquality, well-characterized biomaterials along with their clinical, genetic, and

demographic information for future biomedical research projects in store in a highquality biobank.

Cohort description
Patients aged 18 years and older undergoing cardiac catheterization at a single large
academic center (Department of Cardiology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, CharitéUniversitätsmedizin Berlin), except those with troponin-positive acute coronary
syndromes (ACS), were eligible for inclusion. Participation rate was particularly high
(>95%). Between October 2016 and March 2018 1,005 consecutive patients were
enrolled. All participants gave written informed consent at the time of enrolment.
Patients unable to provide informed consent were excluded from the study. The study
was approved by the ethics committee at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (approval
number: EA1/135/16).
The main study variables are shown in Supplementary Table 1. A comprehensive
data collection was performed, with a strong focus on cardiovascular health. Blood
specimens were collected at the time of cardiac catheterization (after administration of
heparin), either as arterial blood sample directly from the radial or femoral artery sheath
or as a venous blood sample from a peripheral intravenous access. At enrolment,
patients were interviewed to collect information on demographic characteristics, overthe-counter (OTC) medication usage, health behaviors (alcohol/drug use, smoking,
physical activity), a detailed standardized family history was obtained, and a screening
test for cognitive impairment (the mini-mental state examination, (MMSE) was
performed. Information on regular prescription medications were obtained from the
patients’ medication plan. In addition, electronic medical records were reviewed by
study personnel to obtain previous diagnoses of chronic conditions, as well as to
document previous angiographic findings and coronary revascularization history.

Portions of the blood specimens were used to determine a basic panel of laboratory
tests essential to this study. Lp(a) was determined using a turbidimetric assay (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim). Lp(a) is given in nmol/L, correctly reflecting the
number of Lp(a) particles.[14] A range of other parameters were taken over from the
hospital information system (HIS), provided that they were ordered as part of the
clinical routine. Importantly, all tests were done in one central, accredited laboratory.
Specimens
EDTA blood samples were frozen immediately following collection at -80°C until DNA
was isolated using the sbeadex livestock kit (LGC Genomics GmbH, Germany).
Selected SNPs were genotyped using KASP chemistry (LGC, Hoddesdon, UK).
Additional blood samples were drawn and stored in the Central Biomaterial Bank
Charité (ZeBanC) [15], providing the opportunity for additional measurements at a
later date.
Coronary angiography
Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography were performed according to the
standard protocols of the Interventional Cardiology Unit and by discretion of the
interventional cardiologist. The interventional cardiologist routinely documented
diagnostic findings. Comprehensive angiographic results at the time of enrolment were
recorded in the study database.
Echocardiography, blood pressure measurement, pulse wave analysis
Echocardiography was performed as a part of the clinical routine, and selected
parameters were taken over into the study database.
Blood pressure was measured once on each arm, in a sitting position and at rest with
a boso medicus uno device with an adequate cuff size.

Central blood pressure, pulse wave reflection, and pulse wave velocity were measured
with the Mobil-O-Graph PWA device, according to the operating instructions of the
manufacturer.
Other measurements
Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lower margin of the
least palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured
around the widest portion of the buttocks, with the tape parallel to the floor. For both
measurements, the subjects were standing and wore little clothing. [16]
Hand grip strength was measured with a Smedley Dynamometer (Saehan, Type
SH5002).
Questionnaires
The Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity
(RAPA) questionnaire were administered. Folstein’s Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) for screening of cognitive impairment was administered in face-to-face
interviews by trained study personnel.
Planned follow-up measures
Mortality information will be obtained from the obligatory registry office in two-year
intervals. Follow-up phone interviews will be conducted by trained study personnel,
and the calls are planned to be made at 3, and 6 years after initial enrolment. Adverse
CVD events, including non-fatal MI, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure,
hospitalizations, cardiac procedures (e.g., revascularization), strokes and peripheral
arterial disease events will be recorded. Additional information will be collected on
follow-up coronary angiogram data, development of comorbidities (hypertension,

diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, obstructive sleep apnoea and
cancer) and changes in medications.

Findings to date
The cohort
Baseline characteristics of the 1,005 patients are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The
mean age at enrolment was 70.9±11.1 years. Approximately 70% of the participants
were male, 97.6 were of white Caucasian ancestry. Coronary angiography provided
evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD, defined as >50% luminal
narrowing in a major epicardial vessel) in 69.9% of participants at enrolment, 11.2%
had non-obstructive CAD and 18.8% had normal coronary angiograms without
evidence of atherosclerosis (no apparent CAD). In 509 patients (50.6%) obstructive
CAD had been previously known, and angiography was performed for evaluation of
disease progression or planned intervention of residual stenosis.
Those with evidence of obstructive CAD were significantly more likely to have a
positive family history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR) 1.48, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 1.06 to 2.06, p=0.019), compared to participants with no apparent CAD.
Likewise, participants with obstructive CAD were significantly more likely to be
physically inactive (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16, p=0.014).
Lipoprotein(a) – clinical and genetic associations
The median serum concentration of Lp(a) at baseline was 19.3 nmol/L
(interquartile range IQR <7.0 to 77.1 nmol/L). Lp(a) levels were positively associated
with age among women, whereas in men Lp(a) levels were consistent across the age

spectrum. Referring to this, whereas overall there was no evidence of a significant sex
difference in Lp(a) levels, in patients aged over 60 years the median Lp(a)
concentration was significantly higher in women (26.4; IQR 8.2 to 109.6) than in men
(18.2; IQR <7.0 to 71.4, p=0.038).
Accounting for the right-skewed distribution of Lp(a) in the general population
and also in cardiovascular high-risk populations, it has become current practice to
examine the distribution of Lp(a) by quintiles, particularly individuals in the fifth quintile
being at increased risk of CV disease. Also, the commonly referenced threshold of
100-125 nmol/L (equals 50 mg/dL), usually corresponds approximately to the cut-off
point defining the fifth quintile. [6, 17] Of total 968 patients with available Lp(a)
measurements 193 patients (19.9%) had Lp(a) values above 106.9 nmol/L (fifth
quintile).
Participants in the highest quintile of Lp(a) ( 107 nmol/L) had significantly increased
odds of obstructive CAD compared to participants in the lowest quintile (OR 1.58, 1.02
to 2.45, p=0.039) or in quintiles 1-4

(OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.48, p=0.005),

respectively. Moreover, there was reasonable evidence that with increasing severity of
CAD (non obstructive CAD, 1-vessel, 2-vessel, and 3-vessel obstructive CAD) the
odds of having a significantly elevated Lp(a) increased (test for trend p=0.015).
Genetic associations
In order to assess if our cohort data are suitable for genetic association analyses, we
genotyped and examined LPA-SNPs rs10455872, rs3798220 and rs186696265, which
have been previously reported to be strongly associated with Lp(a) serum levels. [1821] Overall 179 patients (18.8%) were carriers of at least one minor allele. All three
SNPs were significantly associated with Lp(a) levels in the LipidCardio cohort (Table

3). The strongest evidence of an association with Lp(a) serum levels was found for
rs10455872 (β=0.794; p= 5.1×10-52, Table 3 and Figure 1). Our data were compatible
with an overall positive association (OR 1.35; 95 % CI 0.93-1.99, p=0.118) between
carrying a minor LPA variant and CAD; even though the evidence was week. However,
when stratified by sex there was reasonable evidence to suggest an association
between the LPA-SNPs tested and obstructive CAD in women (OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.023.35, p=0.04), while in men there was no evidence for such an association. The
association in women was stable even after adjusting for age, type 2 diabetes, LDL-C,
and statin therapy.
Furthermore, we genotyped the two SNPs rs429358 and rs7412 constituting the three
APOE isoforms apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. Rs7412 was recently confirmed in a large
GWAS (meta-analysis) to be associated with Lp(a) serum levels with genome wide
significance. [18] Indeed, we found rs7412 to be significantly associated with Lp(a)
concentration (β=0.15; p= 0.008), i.e. we could replicate the previous finding. Similar
to the earlier study, there was no evidence that rs429358 was also associated with
Lp(a) serum levels in the LipidCardio cohort (data not shown), while there was
reasonable evidence of an association between the inferred APOE isoforms
(Supplementary Table 2) and Lp(a) serum levels (β=0.015; p= 0.006, N=893) (see
Supplementary Table 2).

Strengths and limitations of this study

-

Most importantly, this cohort has coronary angiographic information on all included
subjects. Thus, while the majority has confirmed obstructive CAD, we can ensure that
the unaffected “comparison group” effectively has no apparent CAD.

-

In addition we are able to differentiate a group with non-obstructive CAD, constituting
an interesting intermediate group. This differentiation is particularly important in terms
of distinct phenotypes.

-

A potential weakness is that patients are only recruited from one tertiary care hospital.
Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other patients with CAD.

Collaboration
We are interested to share data and biobank samples with other researchers in joint
collaborative projects, e.g. for replication of phenotypic and/or genetic findings or metaanalyzes of study results. Interested groups should contact the study coordinating PI
Ilja Demuth at ilja.demuth@charite.de for the data-sharing application form. Each
application will be reviewed by the LipidCardio PIs (currently I.D., U.L. and E.S-T.) and
the decision communicated to the applicants usually within 6 weeks of submission.

Funding
The LipidCardio Study was partially funded by the Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH.
This funder did not play a role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision
to publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial support.
