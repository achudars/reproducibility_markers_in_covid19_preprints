A new class of gene drive in plant populations with herbicide resistance is described; a

7

conditional gene drive that operates following herbicide application. Screening progeny

8

from controlled crosses of Brassica napus heterozygous for a dominant allele conferring

9

chlorsulfuron resistance, demonstrated that the herbicide imposes in planta gametic

10

selection against pollen and ovules with the recessive allele for herbicide susceptibility,

11

as well as embryonic selection against embryos homozygous for the susceptible allele.

12

We postulate that natural gene drives are common in plant populations and can operate

13

in a conditional manner resulting in non-Mendelian inheritance in response to abiotic

14

and biotic stresses.

15

Gene drives involve biased inheritance of genetic elements or specific alleles from parents to

16

offspring through sexual reproduction1,2. A consequence of gene drives is an increased

17

frequency of specific genetic elements or alleles and their accelerated spread throughout

18

populations over successive generations1-4. Here we describe a conditional gene drive active

19

in plant populations with herbicide resistance. Plants heterozygous for an allele conferring

20

herbicide resistance at a single locus exhibit normal Mendelian inheritance. However,

21

following application of the herbicide, highly distorted segregation of herbicide resistance

22

occurs among progeny. This represents a new class of gene drive that helps to explain the

23

rapid emergence of herbicide resistance in plant populations5,6.

24

Herbicide resistance has become wide-spread in populations of weeds and is commonly the

25

result of point mutations inherited as single dominant mutations5,7. The Brassica napus

26

mutant line 30a, derived from seed mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), is

27

homozygous at a single locus for a dominant allele conferring resistance to the sulfonylurea

28

herbicide chlorsulfuron8. Crossing to a wild-type near-isogenic line susceptible to the

29

herbicide generated progeny heterozygous for sulfonylurea resistance. Upon self-pollination

30

of these heterozygous plants, all progeny segregated in a 3:1 ratio for herbicide-resistant and

31

herbicide-sensitive progeny (Supplementary Table 1) as expected. However, when plants of

32

the same heterozygous status were sprayed with chlorsulfuron, virtually all of the progeny of

33

all plants were herbicide-resistant, irrespective of whether plants were sprayed once

34

(Supplementary Table 2) or repeatedly (Supplementary Table 3). We conclude that the

35

application of chlorsulfuron to B. napus plants heterozygous for a chlorsulfuron-resistant

36

allele at a single locus results in a markedly distorted segregation toward chlorsulfuron-

37

resistant progeny (Table 1).

38

To explore the underlying reason for the skewed segregation, we applied chlorsulfuron at

39

specific times during development of the heterozygous plants, then assessed the self-

40

pollinated and reciprocal backcross progeny for chlorsulfuron resistance. In the absence of

41

herbicide treatment, the segregation of herbicide-resistant and herbicide-sensitive progeny

42

occurred in the expected 3:1 (self-pollinated) and 1:1 (backcrossed) ratios for standard

43

Mendelian genetics (Table 2). Highly skewed segregation among self-pollinated and

44

reciprocal backcrossed progeny occurred following a single application of chlorsulfuron at

45

any time between young seedlings with 2-3 true leaves up until two weeks after the first

46

siliques (seed pods) had reached full size (Table 2). A reduction in seed number per silique

47

following chlorsulfuron application is indicative of the in planta elimination of herbicide-

48

sensitive ovules or abortion of herbicide-sensitive embryos. The skewed segregation when

49

the herbicide was applied after siliques had reached full size (i.e. well after embryo

50

formation) signifies an in planta effect on embryo abortion. The application of chlorsulfuron

51

to heterozygous pollen parents in the rosette phase prior to flowering, followed by

52

backcrossing to wild-type plants also resulted in distorted segregation in favour of herbicide-

53

resistant progeny (Table 2). However, the skewed segregation selecting against herbicide-

54

sensitive pollen was not as dramatic as when applying the herbicide to the heterozygous

55

ovule parent (Table 2).

56

To distinguish between the elimination of embryos homozygous for herbicide-sensitivity

57

and/or herbicide-sensitive ovules, plants heterozygous for herbicide resistance (wt x 30a)

58

were backcrossed using pollen from non-sprayed plants homozygous for herbicide resistance.

59

As expected, given the homozygous status of the pollen parent, all progeny ((wt x 30a) x 30a)

60

exhibited herbicide resistance irrespective of whether the heterozygous ovule parent was

61

sprayed with chlorsulfuron (n= 111 progeny) or not (n= 223 progeny). However, when

62

chlorsulfuron was applied to the heterozygous ovule parent in the rosette phase prior to

63

flowering the number of seeds per silique was reduced to 3.4, compared with 6.4 when the

64

heterozygous ovule parent was not sprayed. Since all progeny are expected to be herbicide-

65

resistant, no embryo effects are expected. Therefore, the approximate halving of seeds per

66

silique establishes that the in planta elimination of the segregating herbicide-sensitive ovules

67

is a major effect contributing to the skewed segregation.

68

The application of herbicides to plants heterozygous for a herbicide-resistant allele results in

69

a highly biased segregation toward herbicide-resistant progeny (Tables 1 and 2). A series of

70

controlled crosses using pollen and/or ovules from herbicide-treated plants allowed the biased

71

segregation to be attributed to the elimination of segregating herbicide-sensitive gametes and

72

embryos. This will be a consequence of herbicide uptake and translocation throughout the

73

plants, thereby effecting toxicity to pollen, ovule and embryos susceptible to the herbicide.

74

Chlorsulfuron is well known to be rapidly translocated throughout plants in an acropetal

75

manner9 and is therefore capable of targeting pollen, ovules and embryos in planta. This is

76

supported by sub-lethal foliar applications of sulfonylurea herbicides inducing male sterility

77

in B. napus and other cruciferous plants10-11. Plants heterozygous for resistance to any

78

systemic herbicide are therefore likely to exhibit similar distorted segregation for herbicide

79

resistance among their progeny following herbicide application. The degree of segregation

80

distortion will be dependent upon the extent of herbicide translocation to segregating pollen,

81

ovules and embryos. Furthermore, the herbicide-resistant alleles need to be expressed in the

82

vegetative tissue, as well as within the reproductive tissue involving gametes and embryos.

83

This study has described a new class of gene drive active in plant populations with herbicide

84

resistance; a conditional gene drive that only operates upon application of the herbicide. The

85

in planta elimination of gametes with a recessive allele for herbicide susceptibility and

86

embryos homozygous for the recessive allele enriches the next generation with individuals

87

homozygous or heterozygous for dominant alleles conferring herbicide resistance. As a

88

consequence the frequency of herbicide-resistant alleles in subsequent generations is

89

increased.

90

Gene drives have been described and developed in animal systems. Engineered gene drive

91

systems offer approaches to control invertebrate and vertebrate pests1,3,12,13, with some

92

theoretical opportunities also proposed for plants1,13. Ironically, these proposed gene drives

93

for plants involve scenarios for the elimination of herbicide-resistant biotypes in plant

94

populations, whereas this study clearly demonstrates that natural gene drives can account for

95

the rapid increase of the frequency of herbicide-resistant alleles in natural plant populations.

96

Gene drives are poorly documented and not well understood in plants. Distorted segregation

97

in plants is commonly recognised and is often associated with cytological abnormalities or

98

genetic curiosities14. These particular events generally have poor transmission from parents to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/519884; this version posted January 17, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

99

offspring relative to the wild-type and are usually maintained as genetic stocks with limited

100

occurrence in natural populations. Two examples recognised as gene drives in plants involve

101

sex expression associated with gynodioecy in Silene acaulis15 and a centromere-associated

102

locus in Mimulus interspecific hybrids16.

103

This study has illustrated a simple conditional gene drive likely to operate as a natural

104

process in environments where herbicides are commonly used and where herbicide resistance

105

alleles are present in weed populations. It represents a new class of gene drive that helps to

106

explain the rapid emergence of herbicide resistance in plant populations5,6. We postulate that

107

natural gene drives are common in plant populations and can operate in a conditional manner

108

during sexual reproduction to effect a biased inheritance for specific alleles conferring

109

resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, including xenobiotic chemicals, acid soil, metal

110

toxicity, temperature stress and possibly pathotoxins, viruses and viroids. Effecting a

111

conditional gene drive through herbicide treatments provides an eloquent example to target

112

the induction of biased segregation in favour of a specific allele. This is due to the potent

113

nature of systemic herbicides to translocate acropetally and effectively eliminate herbicide

114

sensitive gametes and embryos in planta. Conditional gene drives for other forms of abiotic

115

and biotic stress may exhibit less penetrance and a reduced bias of segregation ratios, but can

116

be still effective at increasing the frequency of specific alleles in subsequent generations.

117

This new concept of conditional gene drives has important implications for interpreting

118

inheritance of traits in plants. The environmental conditions imposed upon the growth of

119

parental plants can establish a gene drive that effects selection against recessive alleles during

120

sexual reproduction of heterozygous individuals. Screening of subsequent progeny may result

121

in an over-representation of dominant alleles conferring resistance to abiotic and biotic

122

stresses, with some traits being more simply inherited than otherwise apparent. Further

123

development of conditional gene drives may offer mitigation for the concerns raised about

124

unintended impacts associated with the introduction of engineered gene drive systems to

125

control pests, weeds and diseases1,2,4,13,17,18. Most importantly, this form of gene drive

126

provides a fundamental mechanism for the interpretation of rapid natural selection in

127

adaption of plants to abiotic and biotic stresses in changing environments.

128

Methods

129

Two near-isogenic Brassica napus lines were used in this study; a wild-type herbicide-

130

susceptible line (wt) and 30a, an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant homozygous for

131

single dominant allele conferring resistance to the sulfonylurea herbicides8. These were

132

derived from a rapid cycling B. napus line CrGC#5, originally obtained from the Crucifer

133

Genetics Cooperative, University of Wisconsin. The two lines were hybridised to generate a

134

population heterozygous for herbicide resistance (wt x 30a). Some experiments involved

135

backcrosses of the heterozygous plants to either wt or 30a. Plants were grown individually in

136

1.8-litre plastic pots (15 cm diameter at top tapering to 10 cm diameter at base, 15 cm high)

137

with a standard potting mix and maintained in a greenhouse as previously described19.

138

When required, plants were sprayed with chlorsulfuron (a sulfonylurea herbicide) at a rate of

139

3 mg/litre until runoff. This treatment was lethal to the wild-type plants, but had no growth

140

impact on the plants heterozygous or homozygous for chlorsulfuron resistance. Following

141

self-pollination or backcrossing, all seeds were harvested at maturity. Progeny were screened

142

for chlorsulfuron resistance as previously described20. Segregation among progeny was

143

assessed by chi-square goodness of fit tests to determine whether the observed segregation

144

deviated from the expected 3:1 or 1:1 ratios for Mendelian genetics.
