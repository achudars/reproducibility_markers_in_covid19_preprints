Abstract

31

Studies of the intestinal microbiome commonly utilize stool samples to measure microbial

32

composition in the distal gut. However, collection of stool can be difficult from some subjects

33

under certain experimental conditions. In this study we validate the use of swabs of fecal matter

34

to approximate measurements of microbiota in stool using 16S rRNA gene Illumina amplicon

35

sequencing, and evaluate the effects of shipping time at ambient temperatures on accuracy.

36

Results indicate that swab samples reliably replicate stool microbiota bacterial composition,

37

alpha diversity, and beta diversity when swabs are processed quickly (< 2 days), but sample

38

quality quickly degrades after this period, accompanied by increased abundances of

39

Enterobacteriaceae. Fresh swabs appear to be a viable alternative to stool sampling when

40

standard collection methods are challenging, but extended exposure to ambient temperatures

41

prior to processing threatens sample integrity.

Introduction

44

The microbial communities inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract play important roles in

45

digestion, immune and metabolic regulation, and disease (1). Monitoring the gut microbiota is

46

often performed to assess the impact of disease or other disturbances (2), therapeutic

47

interventions (3), or host development (4). Measurements of microbiota composition in the distal

48

gut commonly utilize stool samples.

49

Collection and transport of stool may be difficult or impossible, however, under certain

50

conditions, e.g., due to stool consistency or if subjects are unable or unwilling to provide stool.

51

In a study by Sinha et al., the microbial compositions of stool swabs correlated closely with stool

52

(5); however, this study only assessed the similarity of swab microbiota to stool at two different

53

storage times (fresh and after 4 days at room temperature). With a similar approach, Bassis and

54

coworkers showed that collecting and immediately processing rectal swabs also approximated

55

stool microbiota composition (6). Rectal swabs are collected by insertion of a sterile swab into

56

the rectum; fecal swabs are collected by applying a sterile swab to freshly passed stool or toilet

57

paper. Collection of fecal swabs represents a simpler and less disruptive approach than either

58

stool collection or rectal swabbing, permitting its use with sensitive patients. Swab collection

59

also simplifies sample handling and processing during collection, archiving, and DNA extraction.

60

This facilitates sampling under busy clinical settings or by individual subjects at home.

61

To validate stool swabs for measurements of intestinal microbiota, stool swabs and stool

62

samples were collected from subjects in the autism MTT study from identical stool samples, and

63

microbiota composition and diversity were compared between sample pairs using 16S rRNA

gene amplicon sequencing and analysis in the QIIME 2 software package (7). We show that

65

swab and stool samples exhibit highly similar microbiota profiles, provided that the swabs were

66

received and processed within two days of collection.

67

Results

68

An accurate measurement of intestinal microbiota composition should demonstrate a high

69

degree of similarity to stool composition, the current gold standard method. We measured

70

phylogenetic similarity between samples using abundance-weighted and unweighted pairwise

71

UniFrac distance (8). We also measured paired differences in observed richness of sequence

72

variants, phylogenetic diversity (PD) (9), and Shannon diversity and evenness to assess alpha

73

diversity differences between swab and stool samples.

74

Fresh swab microbiota resemble stool

75

Freshly processed (≤ 2 days) pairs of stool and swab samples collected from the same

76

individual at the same time (paired samples) were significantly more similar to each other than

77

to stool or swab samples collected from the same individual but collected at different times

78

(within-subject pairs), suggesting that stool and swab samples yield similar community

79

structures when swabs are processed quickly (Figure 1) (weighted UniFrac Mann-Whitney U =

80

294.5, P = 0.007; unweighted UniFrac U = 342.5, P = 0.024). Swabs experiencing longer

81

transport times were not significantly more similar to their stool pairs than they were to within-

82

subject pairs (P > 0.05), suggesting that shipping times longer than 2 days do not reliably

83

represent the microbiome of stool samples frozen at the time of collection.

Both unweighted and weighted UniFrac paired sample distances increase as swab shipping

time increases (Figure 1), becoming significantly more dissimilar than within-subject pairs by 6

days of shipping (Wilcoxon P < 0.05); transport time is positively correlated with paired sample

dissimilarity for both weighted (Spearman R = 0.88, P = 0.004) and unweighted UniFrac (R =

swab compositional accuracy, similar to the negative effects of room-temperature storage on

101

stool compositional accuracy (10).

102

Pairwise differences in alpha diversity between paired samples (swab – stool observed

103

diversity) indicates that swab richness decreases as transport time increases (Spearman R = -

104

0.86, P = 0.006) and PD (R = -0.88, P = 0.004). Shannon diversity (R = -0.64, P = 0.086) and

105

evenness (R = -0.57, P = 0.139) also decrease with increasing transport time, but the

106

correlations are not significant (Figure 2). After 4 days of transport time, swab richness,

107

Shannon diversity, and evenness, but not PD, are significantly lower than stool (Wilcoxon P <

108

0.05), but transport time under 4 days does not significantly impact these alpha diversity

109

metrics. This decrease in richness and evenness likely indicates that growth of one or more

110

bacterial species (facultatively aerobic enterobacteria, as results below suggest) numerically

111

overshadows the abundance of other bacteria (e.g., strict anaerobes and slower-growing

112

organisms). The latter organisms do not disappear from this closed system, but become less

113

likely to detect.

121

Supervised learning classification confirms accuracy of fresh swabs

122

To confirm the similarity of swab microbiota compared to stool microbiota, we used random

123

forest (11) classification models to predict sample type (stool or swab) based on microbiota

124

composition (16S rRNA gene sequence variants). Stool samples were compared to swab

125

samples exposed to between 3-8 days of transport time (highly dissimilar from stool) or only 1-2

126

day of transport time (more similar to stool). Swabs exposed to 3-8 days of transport time could

127

be accurately classified 94.6% of the time, and stool samples 90.1% of the time. However,

128

swabs exposed to ≤ 2 days of transport time could not be reliably distinguished from stool

129

samples: swab samples were correctly classified only 47.1% of the time (random chance is

130

50%). Notably, the most important features identified in each model were members of family

131

Enterobacteriaceae.

132

133

Swabs are characterized by overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae

134

compared to stool samples

135

Next we determined the impact of transport time on swab bacterial taxonomic composition

136

compared to stool to identify taxa responsible for altered diversity patterns. The taxonomic

137

compositions of swab samples became dominated by Enterobacteriaceae as transport time

138

increased, leading to a notable disparity compared to stool samples collected from the same

139

subject at the same time (Figure 3). Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance was positively

140

correlated with transport time (R = 0.88, P = 0.004) (Figure 4). Paired ANCOM tests (12)

141

between all paired samples (regardless of transport time) indicates that bacterial species in the

142

families Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae were overrepresented in swab samples (P < 0.05)

143

and a broad range of Clostridiales were overrepresented in stool (Table 1). While phylum

144

Proteobacteria (represented mostly by family Enterobacteriaceae) was overrepresented in swab

145

samples compared to their matching stool samples (slope > 1), most other phyla exhibited slight

146

overrepresentation in stool (slope < 1) (Figure 5). Nevertheless, the abundances of all phyla are

147

significantly correlated between swabs and their matching stool samples (Spearman R = 0.67, P

148

< 0.0001) (Figure 5). This most likely indicates cellular growth of Enterobacteriaceae while other

149

populations remain largely static and are supplanted at an approximately even rate. This could

150

also indicate death and DNA degradation of these other populations, but that scenario seems

151

much less likely given the short time frame of this experiment; however, we cannot discern

152

changes to absolute abundance based on our compositional (relative abundance) sequence

153

data.

Discussion

180

This study has demonstrated the accuracy of swabs for approximating the composition of stool

181

samples, and evaluated the effect of transport time. Previous authors have examined the

182

reproducibility and accuracy of fresh swabs for approximating stool microbiota measurements

183

(5). We extend these prior studies by demonstrating the impact of storage time on swab

184

similarity to stool. This corroborates earlier findings that swab and stool samples yield similar

185

biological conclusions (3, 5).

186

We show that swabs provide an accurate approximation of stool microbiota diversity,

187

composition, and structure, provided that the swabs are processed as freshly as possible (≤ 2

188

days). Stool samples and swabs could not be reliably distinguished by supervised learning

189

classification, indicating close resemblance between these collection methods. Long transport

190

times are associated with overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae (probably due to growth

191

under aerobic conditions), decreasing accuracy of microbiota profiles. Prospectively, this finding

192

could be used to further enhance the use of swabs for fecal microbiota profiling. Except in

193

scenarios where high levels of Enterobacteriaceae are a normal constituent of the intestinal

194

microbiota, such as following gastric bypass surgery (13, 14), Enterobacteriaceae could be used

195

as a marker for validating swab integrity, e.g., to reject outliers that may have experienced

196

inadequate shipping or storage; modeling compositional changes over time could also support

197

development of algorithms to correct for biases arising from collection and storage issues.

198

Stool collection is not always easy or convenient. This may be due to logistical constraints (e.g.,

199

at-home collection or busy clinical settings), sample characteristics (e.g., fecal incontinence), or

200

subject comfort. Stool swabs represent a viable alternative for measurement of distal gut

201

microbial composition and diversity. Swabs are also considerably easier to handle and process

202

than stool samples, streamlining collection and DNA extraction protocols. Although we find that

203

stool and fresh swab samples could not be reliably distinguished by supervised learning

204

classification, we do not recommend mixing stool and swab collection methods within the same

205

study, in order to avoid introduction of experimental variation and potential sampling biases. For

206

example, contamination and other artifactual biases could differ between collection methods

207

and different brands of swabs, and variation should be minimized as much as possible. In

208

studies where different collection methods become necessary, investigators should test to

209

ensure that collection methods do not covary with other sample characteristics or metadata.

Data availability

212

This study re-analyzed a previously published 16S rRNA gene sequence dataset (3), which is

214

number 10532.

215

Sample collection and processing

216

Stool samples and swabs were collected and processed as previously described in a study of

217

autistic children receiving microbiota transfer therapy (3). Stool samples and fecal swabs were

218

collected by subjects’ parents. Fecal samples were stored in dry ice and collected by a driver,

219

and frozen at -80˚C immediately upon arrival at the laboratory. Swabs were shipped to the lab

220

by standard postal mail. After defecation, fecal matter was collected from toilet paper using a

221

sterile swab (Fisher Scientific BD Culture Swab item number B4320135), taking care not to

222

contact the paper or overload the swab. Samples were shipped at room temperature and frozen

223

at -80˚C immediately upon arrival at the laboratory. Swab samples were primarily shipped within

224

Arizona at different times of year, so temperatures (and hence shipping effects) may be slightly

225

greater than other regions. The time between shipping and receipt was logged as “days in

226

transit”, as used to perform statistical analyses described below. DNA extraction and

227

sequencing were performed as previously described, following the earth microbiome project

228

standard protocol for 16S V4 rRNA gene sequencing with 515f-806r primers (15). A total of 123

229

stools and 355 swabs were collected and analyzed in the current study, including 98 pairs of

230

stool and swab samples that were collected from the same source stool. Swab transport times

231

varied from 0 to 68 days; however, only days 1-8 contained sufficient sample size (minimum N =

233

composition accuracy compared to paired stools.

234

Microbiome analysis

235

Sequence data were processed and analyzed using QIIME 2 (7). Raw sequences were quality-

236

filtered using DADA2 (16) to remove PhiX, chimeric, and erroneous reads. Sequence variants

237

were aligned using mafft (17) and used to construct a phylogenetic tree using fasttree2 (18).

238

Taxonomy was assigned to sequence variants using q2-feature-classifier (19) against the

239

GreenGenes 16S rRNA reference database 13_8 release (20).

240

Statistical analysis

241

QIIME 2 was used to measure the following microbiota alpha diversity metrics: richness (as

242

observed sequence variants), Shannon diversity and evenness, and Phylogenetic Diversity (9).

Microbiome beta diversity was estimated in QIIME 2 using weighted and unweighted UniFrac

244

distance (8). Feature tables were evenly subsampled at 5,000 sequences per sample prior to

245

alpha or beta diversity analyses.

246
247

Alpha diversity differences and UniFrac distances between paired stool and swab samples from

248

identical source samples (paired samples) were calculated using q2-longitudinal (21). ANCOM

249

(12) was used to test whether the abundances of individual taxa differed between paired

250

samples. Balance trees analysis and ordinary least squares regression on balances was

251

performed using the q2-gneiss plugin (22). Spearman correlation coefficients were computed

252

between transport time and median alpha diversity metrics, UniFrac distance, and

253

Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test whether

254

relative abundances of family Enterobacteriaceae were significantly different between stool
