SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Phytoplasmas are bacterial plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases in crops and
ornamental plants by the secretion of effector proteins such as SAP54, which leads to the
degradation of some floral homeotic proteins. Our study clarifies the structural requirements of
SAP54 function and illuminates the molecular mode of interaction and thus may ultimately help
to develop treatments against some devastating plant diseases.

Summary
Phytoplasmas are intracellular bacterial plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases in crops
and ornamental plants by the secretion of effector proteins. One of these effector proteins,
termed SECRETED ASTER YELLOWS-WITCHES’ BROOM PROTEIN 54 (SAP54), leads
to the degradation of a specific subset of floral homeotic proteins of the MIKC-type MADSdomain family via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In consequence, the developing flowers
show the homeotic transformation of floral organs into vegetative leaf-like structures. The
molecular mechanism of SAP54 action involves physical binding to the keratin-like K-domain
of MIKC-type proteins, and to some RAD23 proteins, which translocate ubiquitylated
substrates to the proteasome. The structural requirements and specificity of SAP54 function are
poorly understood, however. Here we report, based on biophysical and molecular biological
analyses, that SAP54 folds into α-helical structures. We also show that the insertion of helixbreaking mutations disrupts correct folding of SAP54, which interferes with the ability of
SAP54 to bind to its target proteins and to cause disease phenotypes in vivo. Surprisingly,
dynamic light scattering data together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that
SAP54 preferentially binds to multimeric complexes of MIKC-type proteins rather than to
dimers or monomers of these proteins. Together with literature data this finding suggests that
MIKC-type proteins and SAP54 constitute multimeric α-helical coiled-coils, possibly also
involving other partners such as RAD23 proteins. Our investigations clarify the structurefunction relationship of an important phytoplasma effector protein and thus may ultimately help
to develop treatments against some devastating plant diseases.

Introduction
Phytoplasmas (genus ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’) are mycoplasma-like bacterial symbionts of
plants belonging to the class Mollicutes. Among pathogens they have a unique life cycle, as
they invade and replicate in organisms of two different kingdoms, namely plants and animals
(specifically, insects belonging to plant hoppers, leaf hoppers and Psyllids) (Sugio et al.,
2011b). Inside plants, phytoplasmas live almost exclusively within the phloem, whereas in
insects they colonize most major organs including the salivary glands from which the bacteria
are transmitted to new plant hosts during feeding (Hogenhout et al., 2008; Sugio et al., 2011b).
Phytoplasmas are highly derived organisms, in that they have lost their cell wall and went
through massive genome reduction (reviewed by Christensen et al., 2005; Firrao et al., 2007;
Hogenhout et al., 2008). A phytoplasma infection may induce severe changes in plant
morphology via modification of developmental processes. Morphological changes include the
induction of witches’ brooms (tight clustering of branches), phyllody (full or partial homeotic
transformation of floral organs into leaf-like structures), virescence (green coloration of floral
organs), purple top (reddening of leaves and stems), phloem necrosis, stunting of growth habit,
and general yellowing of plants (Lee et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2004). Since the plant hosts of
phytoplasmas include many economically important crops, including fruit trees, and
ornamental plants, these symptoms lead to economically devastating damages each year
worldwide (reviewed by Bertaccini, 2007; Lee et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2017). Since infected
plants allow the replication of phytoplasmas but are frequently not able to reproduce themselves
anymore they were termed ‘zombie plants’ (Du Toit, 2014).
There is evidence that phytoplasmas induce most of the developmental and morphological
changes by secreting virulence factors, termed effector proteins, into the phloem of the host
plant via the bacterial Sec secretion system (Bai et al., 2009; Kakizawa et al., 2001). Effectors
are small peptides characterized by the presence of a signal peptide required for secretion that
have been shown to reprogram plant development in several ways (Bendtsen et al., 2004; Hoshi
et al., 2009; Sugio et al., 2011a). Owing to their small size, the effectors are able to travel
systemically through the plant and reach tissues distant to the phloem (Bai et al., 2009; Hoshi
et al., 2009; Sugio et al., 2011b).
An particularly intriguing example is the interaction of the effector protein SECRETED ASTER
YELLOWS-WITCHES’ BROOM PROTEIN 54 (SAP54) from Candidatus Phytoplasma
asteris strain Aster Yellows Witches’ Broom (AY-WB), with MIKC-type MADS-domain
transcription factors (MIKC-type MTFs) of the host plants (MacLean et al., 2014; MacLean et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/772699; this version posted September 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

al., 2011; Maejima et al., 2014). MTFs control a plethora of plant developmental processes, in
angiosperms ranging from root to flower and fruit development (reviewed by Smaczniak et al.,
2012a; Theißen et al., 2016). Among the 45 different MIKC-type MTFs being present in the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, only a subset is specifically bound by SAP54, most of which
are involved in the control of floral meristem and organ identity (MacLean et al., 2014). SAP54
mediates the degradation of the targeted proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP)
of the host plant (MacLean et al., 2014; Maejima et al., 2014; Maejima et al., 2015). According
to one model, SAP54 binds the MIKC-type MTFs in a complex together with some
RADIATION SENSITIVE 23 (RAD23) proteins, which play a central role in targeting
ubiquitylated proteins for proteasomal degradation (MacLean et al., 2014; Maejima et al., 2014;
Maejima et al., 2015). Since the degraded MTFs are required for the specification of organ
identity during flower development, the resulting floral structures show the development of
vegetative leaf-like structures rather than floral organs proper.
Within MIKC-type MTFs, SAP54 has been shown to specifically bind to the so called keratinlike domain (K-domain) (MacLean et al., 2014). The K-domain is shared by all MIKC-type
MTFs and mediates protein-protein interactions that allow these proteins to form different
homo- and heteromeric dimers and tetramers (Kaufmann et al., 2005; Melzer and Theißen,
2009; Melzer et al., 2009; Puranik et al., 2014; Smaczniak et al., 2012b). The amino acid
sequence within the K-domain follows a characteristic pattern of regularly spaced hydrophobic
and charged residues that repeats every seven amino acids (Ma et al., 1991; Riechmann et al.,
1996). Such heptad repeat patterns, of the form [abcdefg]n with ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions being
mainly occupied by hydrophobic amino acids, are typical for protein α-helices that are able to
form coiled-coil structures, a common and well-studied class of protein-protein interaction
domains (reviewed by Lupas and Gruber, 2005; Mason and Arndt, 2004). According to X-ray
crystallographic data of the MIKC-type MTF SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) from A. thaliana, which
is a target of SAP54, the K-domain folds into two coiled-coils separated by a short kink (Puranik
et al., 2014). As the amino acid sequence within the K-domain is highly conserved among
MIKC-type MTFs it appears very likely that the K-domains of most MIKC-type MTFs fold in
a structure very similar to that determined for SEP3 (Rümpler et al., 2018).
Based on in silico structure prediction we previously hypothesized that SAP54 folds into a
structure that is very similar to that of the K-domain of MIKC-type MTFs; we also suggested
that the mode of interaction between SAP54 and targeted MIKC-type MTFs resembles and
mimics the one mediating protein-protein interactions among MIKC-type MTFs itself
(Rümpler et al., 2015). Here, we experimentally tested these hypotheses in vitro, in vivo (yeast)

and in planta using biophysical and mutational analyses, as well as protein-protein interaction
studies. Our present data here strongly corroborate the view that SAP54 indeed folds into two
α-helices that are capable of forming coiled-coils and that are separated by a short interhelical
region - a structure remarkably similar to that of the K-domain of MIKC-type MTFs. Dynamic
light scattering data and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) suggest that this structure
allows SAP54 to target MIKC-type MTFs via forming multimeric α-helical coiled-coils.

RESULTS
In silico predictions suggest that SAP54 folds into α-helices capable of forming coiled-coils
To get a first impression of the structural properties of SAP54 of phytoplasma AY-WB and its
homologs we compiled a sequence collection of 28 SAP54-like proteins from a diverse set of
phytoplasma strains based on BLAST searches in the non-redundant NCBI nucleotide and
protein collections, and in whole genome data. The vast majority of sequences aligned without
any gaps (i.e. without potential insertions or deletions). With an average sequence identity of
~76 % the sequences appeared to be overall very similar (Figure 1a). Merely sequences from
phytoplasma strains belonging to the 16SrII and the 16SrXII group deviate from the majority
of sequences, especially within the first 15 amino acids of the secreted part and within the centre
of the protein. In addition, six of the sequences appear truncated at their C-termini. Inspection
of the coding sequences of the respective genes revealed that either a nonsense mutation (strains
284/09 and NJAY), single or double nucleotide insertions resulting in a frame shift and a
premature stop codon (strains NTU2011, PYR, and WBD), or an incomplete genomic DNA
sequence (strain MA1) caused the truncated sequences. Based on the aligned SAP54-like
sequences we performed secondary structure predictions applying different programs. All
secondary structure prediction programs consistently predicted a high α-helical content
spanning almost the entire protein (Figure 1b). Only the first 20 amino acids at the N-terminus
are presumably unstructured. The (at least) two putative helices were predicted to be separated
by a turn or bend located in the centre of the protein. According to PCOILS the predicted helices
show a continuous heptad repeat pattern and consequently a high probability to form coiledcoils. We further investigated the structure of SAP54 by conducting different 3D structure
predictions. QUARK Online, PSIPRED, and SWISS-MODEL produced very similar 3D
structures according to which SAP54 folds into at least two coiled-coils that are separated by
an interhelical region (Figure 1c).
SAP54 shows high α-helical content
In order to experimentally address the presence of the predicted α-helical elements of SAP54
we heterologously expressed SAP54 in Escherichia coli, purified it and recorded circular
dichroism (CD) spectra. The CD spectrum recorded for SAP54 exhibited two minima at 222
and 208 nm, respectively, as well a distinct maximum near 195 nm. Both features constitute
hallmark spectral properties of α-helical proteins (Figure 2a) (Kelly et al., 2005; Ranjbar and
Gill, 2009). Estimated from the residual ellipticity at 222 nm, SAP54 showed an α-helical
content of ~71 % at the applied conditions (Table 1). In contrast, no obvious β-strand content

and only minor irregular structure features were determined, likely to indicate presence of loops
or disordered regions. In order to monitor the temperature dependence of the folding state of
SAP54, its molar ellipticity at 200 nm and 222 nm was determined beginning with 20°C in 5°C
intervals up to 90°C and depicted according to Uverksy (Uversky, 2002). This allows
assessment of the folding state of a protein for the chosen temperatures. At 20°C, SAP54
appears in the region for folded proteins (Figure S1) with gradual loss of secondary structure
content as the temperature is increased. At 80°C to 90°C, SAP54 appears to adopt a ‘molten
globule’ state, which would suggest, that it does not entirely denature even at 90°C (Figure S1,
Table S1). Reducing subsequently the temperature back to 20°C, SAP54 renatures to a certain
degree, albeit not to its initial folded state (Figure S1).
Truncation of putative helices results in a loss of SAP54 interaction ability
Our in silico analyses suggest that the high α-helical content of SAP54 probably involves two
helices that are separated by a turn or bend located near the center of the protein (Figures 1b
and c). Thus we investigated whether deletions of either of the putative helices interferes with
the interaction capabilities of SAP54 with its known MIKC-type MTF targets. We generated
truncated versions of SAP54 in which the first predicted helix (amino acids 1-48 of the mature
SAP54, Figure 3a), the putative turn region (amino acids 49-58), or the second predicted helix
(amino acids 59-91) were missing, and tested the interaction capabilities of SAP54 wildtype
(SAP54-wt) and the truncated proteins in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments. In accordance
with previous results (MacLean et al., 2014), SAP54-wt specifically interacted with the MIKCtype MTFs SEP3, APETALA1 (AP1), and AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) from A. thaliana, but
not with their paralogs APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA (PI) and AGAMOUS (AG) (Figures
3b and c). Deletion of either one of the two putative helices resulted in SAP54 completely losing
its interaction capability (Figures 3b and c). In contrast, deletion of the predicted turn in the
center of the protein did not change its interaction behavior, which would be consistent with
the hypothesized modular domain architecture of SAP54 (Figures 3b and c). In addition to the
deletions mentioned above, we also truncated the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the second
α-helix (amino acids 81-91). Interestingly, this SAP54∆81-91 exhibited failure to interact,
suggesting the presence of an essential interaction site for MIKC-type MTFs in this region.
Immunoblotting analyses (western blot) revealed that the truncated SAP54 proteins are
expressed in yeast (Figure S2), indicating that the absence of yeast growth in the
abovementioned Y2H studies can be attributed to the failure of the respective SAP54
derivatives to interact with MIKC-type MTFs, rather than to their absence.

Helix breaking point mutations impair the interaction ability of SAP54
To further analyze the importance of the α-helical elements of SAP54 for supporting interaction
with MIKC-type MTFs, single amino acids at positions ‘a’ and ‘d’ of the heptad repeat of the
proposed helices were substituted by proline residues. Proline was chosen because it carries
helix-breaking properties due to its cyclic side chain structure, which causes steric conflicts in
a helical chain conformation (Nilsson et al., 1998; Richardson, 1981). We created four
individual proline substitution mutants for L27, I45, L65 and I69, respectively. Whereas L27,
L65, and I69 are located close to the center of putative helix one and two, respectively, the
substitution I45 is located at the C-terminus of the first putative helix and close to the predicted
turn region (Figure 1a). CD spectra were recorded for purified SAP54-L27P, -I45P, and -L65P
as described above to determine their respective secondary structure content. As expected,
mutants SAP54-L27P and -L65P presented with a significant reduction of α-helical content
(Figure 2a and Table 1). In case of the L65P substitution the formation of helical structures was
almost completely abolished and analysis of SAP54-L65P in the ‘Uversky plot’ indicated that
the protein was probably entirely unfolded (Figure 2b). Interestingly, the substitution of
isoleucine by proline at position I45 (I45P) showed the mildest reduction of α-helical content
(Table 1). Y2H analyses revealed that SAP54-L27P, -L65P, and -I69P, all expressed well in
yeast, were unable to interact with any of the investigated MIKC-type MTFs (Figures 4a and
b). In contrast, SAP54-I45P was still able to interact with SEP3 and AP1, whereas the
interaction with AGL6 was lost.
In order to distinguish whether the altered interaction behavior of the proline substitution
mutants was indeed related to the helix breaking properties of proline or if the substitution sites
simply constitute crucial interaction sites, we additionally substituted all investigated amino
acid positions by alanine (L27A, I45A, L65A and I69A). Similar to leucine and isoleucine,
alanine has a high helical propensity and would thus not be expected to interfere with helix
formation (Kukenshoner et al., 2014; Mason et al., 2009; Moitra et al., 1997). However, due to
its small side chain, substitutions to alanine would abrogate specific residue-residue interactions
at the respective sites (Cunningham and Wells, 1989; Morrison and Weiss, 2001). In contrast
to the respective proline substitutions, all alanine substitution mutants were still able to interact
with the known MIKC-type MTF targets of SAP54 (Figures 4a and b). Solely SAP54-L27A
lost the ability to interact with AGL6 (Figure 4b). Western blot analyses revealed that all SAP54
mutant proteins had been produced in full-length in yeast (Figure S2), demonstrating that
absence of yeast growth in Y2H studies was due to the inability of respective SAP54 derivatives
to interact with MIKC-type MTFs, not due to their absence.

SAP54 mutants with disturbed helix formation are unable to cause disease phenotypes
To investigate the importance of the α-helical structure of SAP54 for its ability to cause disease
phenotypes, we overexpressed SAP54-wt and mutant versions under the control of the
Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in A. thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0). In
accordance with previous results (MacLean et al., 2014) overexpression of SAP54-wt caused
phyllody, i.e. the homeotic transformation of floral organs into vegetative leaf-like structures,
and a partial loss of floral determinacy (Figure 4c). Furthermore, we observed clusters of
undifferentiated cells arising from inflorescence meristems - a phenotype partially resembling
the cauliflower-like appearance of a cauliflower (cal), ap1 double mutant (Kempin et al., 1995).
When SAP54-L27P, SAP54-L65P, and SAP54-I69P were overexpressed, which encode for
proline substitutions close to the center of the putative helices, no phenotypic alterations were
observed (Figures 4d, f, and g). In contrast, floral abnormalities were observed when
overexpressing SAP54-I45P that encodes for a proline substitution close to the putative turn
region, although the phenotypic alterations were weaker than those for SAP54-wt (Figure 4e).
Plants overexpressing SAP54-I45P developed flowers in which most floral organs were
replaced by leaf-like structures; however, some flowers developed a few petals and stamens
(Figure 4e). Overexpression of the alanine substitution mutants SAP54-L27A, SAP54-L65A,
and SAP54-I69A resulted in mutant phenotypes similar to those observed for plants
overexpressing SAP54-wt (Figures 4h - j). To ensure that absence of phenotypic alterations was
due to the inability of respective SAP54 derivatives to interact with MIKC-type MTFs, not due
to their absence, expression of SAP54 proteins in planta was confirmed by western blot analysis
(Figure S2).
SAP54 preferentially targets multimers of MIKC-type MTFs
Knowing about the high structural similarity between SAP54 and the K-domain of MIKC-type
MTFs we aimed to investigate the stoichiometry of a SAP54/K-domain complex. Therefore,
we performed dynamic light scattering analyses for purified SAP54 in presence of purified Kdomain of SEP3 (SEP375-178) for different molar ratios. SAP54 in absence of SEP3 K-domain
produces single peaks at an average hydrodynamic radius of 2.17 ± 0.12 nm, resulting in an
average molecular mass estimate of ~20 ± 2 kDa, which suggests that SAP54 forms
homodimers at a concentration of 50 μM under the given phosphate buffer conditions
(Figure 5a, Table 2).
SEP375-178 alone shows one peak that corresponds to a single protein population with a
hydrodynamic radius of 3.32 nm resulting in an estimated molecular mass of ~56 kDa.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/772699; this version posted September 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

According to previous results (Puranik et al., 2014) the observed peak very likely represents a
SEP375-178 homotetramer, although the expected mass of a tetramer would be slightly lower
(~48 kDa). If SAP54 and SEP375-178 were mixed in molar ratios of 1:5, 1:2, and 1:1, single
peaks at 3.35, 3.43, and 3.38 nm, respectively, were observed corresponding to almost identical
molecular masses of ~58, ~61, and ~59 kDa (Figure 5a and Table 2). If the amount of SAP54
was increased further to molar ratios of 2:1 and 5:1, single peaks at 3.01 nm (corresponding to
~45 kDa) and 2.53 nm (~30 kDa) were observed (Figure 5a and Table 2). The potential
influence of complex shape on the mass estimate together with the similar size of SAP54 and
SEP375-178 and thus the potential co-existence of complexes of very similar mass, do not allow
to determine the exact stoichiometry of the observed complexes. However, according to our
data it appears likely that up to a molar ratio of 1:1, SAP54 and SEP375-178 form complexes that
consist of 4 to 5 proteins, whereby the ratio of SAP54 and SEP375-178 proteins within these
complexes are probably variable. Higher concentrations of SAP54 seem to break up these
complexes and instead apparently favor the formation of heterotrimers of varying composition.
To test whether SAP54 indeed tends to bind to multimers of MIKC-type MTFs, at least at low
ratios of SAP54 to MIKC-MTFs, we modified a previously established electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA) in order to conduct supershift experiments. If in vitro translated SEP3 full
length protein was co-incubated with a radioactively labeled DNA probe that carries two
MIKC-type MTF DNA-binding sites (so called CArG-boxes), a single retarded fraction
appeared close to the 1 kb fragment of the DNA marker (Figure 5b, lane 1). As has been
demonstrated in several previous studies, this fraction constitutes a SEP3 tetramer bound to
both DNA-binding sites via looping the DNA in between both binding sites (Jetha et al., 2014;
Melzer et al., 2009; Rümpler et al., 2018). When purified SAP54 was added to the binding
reaction a supershift was observed (Figure 5b, lane 2). Since SAP54 does not bind to DNA
alone (Figure 5b, lanes 10 and 12), this demonstrates that SAP54 interacts with DNA bound
SEP3. Additional EMSA experiments with variable amounts of SEP3 and SAP54 indicate that
SEP3 still binds cooperatively to both CArG-boxes even in a complex with SAP54 (Figure S3).
Thus, it appears likely that the observed supershift fraction constitutes a DNA-bound SEP3
tetramer bound by at least one SAP54 protein. A SAP54 induced supershift could also be
observed if SEP3∆C (amino acids 1-188), which lags the C-terminal domain of SEP3, was used
for the binding reaction (Figure 5b, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, no supershift was observed if in
addition to the C-terminal domain also the K3-subdomain (SEP3∆K3C, amino acids 1-152) or
the complete K-domain of SEP3 had been removed (SEP3∆KC, amino acids 1-92), indicating

that the K3-subdomain of SEP3 is necessary for the interaction with SAP54 (Figure 5b, lanes
5-8).
If SEP3 was co-incubated with a DNA probe that carries only one CArG-box a retarded fraction
appeared close to the 600 bp fragment of the DNA marker (Figure 5c, lane 1). Based on previous
experiments this fraction constitutes a DNA-bound SEP3 dimer (Jetha et al., 2014; Melzer et
al., 2009). Interestingly, neither for DNA bound dimers of SEP3 full length protein nor for any
of the truncated versions a SAP54 induced supershift was observed (Figure 5c, lanes 2-8). This
strongly supports the observations made by dynamic light scattering experiments and suggests
that SAP54 indeed preferentially binds to multimers of SEP3 rather than monomers or dimers.
Similar results were obtained for the known SAP54 target AP1 (Figures 5d and e, lanes 3 and
4), whereas no SAP54 induced supershifts were observed for AG and AP3/PI (Figures 5d and
e, lanes 5-8).

Discussion
Employing sequence-based computer predictions and educated guesses we have previously
suggested a structure for the phytoplasma effector protein SAP54. It comprises two α-helices
connected by a short interhelical region in which a conserved proline breaks the α-helix
(Rümpler et al., 2015). The work reported here strongly corroborates our prediction. More
comprehensive and detailed in silico secondary structure predictions confirmed that SAP54 is
composed of (at least) two putative α-helices that are separated by a turn or bend located in the
centre of the protein. According to 3D structure predictions SAP54 folds into at least two coiledcoils that are separated by an interhelical region (Figure 1), very similar to the structure that
had been previously hypothesized (Rümpler et al., 2015). In line with this, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy of purified protein revealed that SAP54 has an α-helical content of ~71 %
under our standard condition (Table 1). Only minor irregular structure features were found,
most likely representing the internal turn and possibly the N-terminal end of the protein.
When either of the two putative α-helices was removed, SAP54 completely lost its ability to
interact with its specific MIKC-type MTF interaction partners in Y2H experiments (Figure 3).
In case of the C-terminal α-helix even deletion of only the last 11 amino acids sufficed to
abolish the interaction capability completely (Figure 3). In contrast, deletion of the predicted
turn in the center of the protein did not result in an altered interaction behavior (Figure 3). These
findings reveal that the two putative α-helical regions are required for the interaction of SAP54
with MIKC-type MTFs, but that the internal turn is not; they also suggest that the distance
between the helices does obviously not matter. The last 11 amino acids of SAP54 may comprise
an essential binding motif for MIKC-type MTFs, but its exact role remains unclear.

To further test the functional relevance of the predicted structure we introduced single amino
acid substitutions to proline and alanine at different heptad repeat ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions of the
proposed helices of SAP54. When leucine or isoleucine residues near the center of the first
(L27) or second (L65, I69) α-helix were substituted by the helix-breaking proline, α-helical
content of the mutant proteins was indeed massively reduced (Figure 2). Y2H analyses revealed
that the mutant proteins were unable to interact with any of the investigated MIKC-type MTFs
(Figure 4). Most importantly, in contrast to the wild-type SAP54 these mutant proteins were
not able anymore to cause disease phenotypes such as phyllody when expressed in A. thaliana
(Figure 4). To demonstrate that changes in SAP54 features of the proline substitution mutants

was due to the helix-breaking property of proline rather than simply the mutation of crucial
interaction sites, we substituted the same residues also with alanines, which do not break helices
but may interfere with the interaction of SAP54 with other proteins. However, the respective
mutant SAP54 proteins were still able to interact with almost all the tested MIKC-type MTF
targets of the wild-type protein in Y2H experiments, and were still capable to cause disease
symptoms when expressed in A. thaliana (Figure 4). Interestingly, a substitution of isoleucine
to proline at position near the C-terminal end of the first putative helix (I45P) showed only a
moderate reduction of α-helical content (Figure 2). In line with this mild effect the interaction
with only one of the investigated MIKC-type MTF was abolished (Figure 4), and, accordingly,
also some ability of the mutant protein in causing phyllody was retained, even though compared
to the wild-type protein its activity was clearly reduced (Figure 4).
Taken together, our findings suggest a strong causal link between the α-helical structure of
major parts of SAP54, its ability to interact with some MIKC-type MTFs in Y2H analyses, and
its function as an effector protein that causes homeotic transformation of floral organs in planta.
All in all we consider our data as a strong support for our previous hypothesis on the structure
of the SAP54 protein and its functional relevance (Rümpler et al., 2015).
While this manuscript was in preparation, Iwabuchi et al. (2019) published the crystal structure
of PHYLLOGEN1OY (PHYL1OY), a homolog of SAP54 from Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris
strain Onion Yellows (OY), by X-ray diffraction. Likewise, Liao et al. (2019) published the
crystal structure PHYL1PnWB from Candidatus Phytoplasma strain Peanut Witches’ Broom.
PHYL1OY shares about 87 % sequence identity with SAP54 (Figure 1a) and generates similar
symptoms in planta, suggesting that both proteins work in very similar ways (Maejima et al.,
2014). In contrast, PHYL1PnWB shares only about 53% sequence identity with SAP54 and is
hence probably more distantly related than PHYL1OY (Figure 1a; Liao et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, the crystal structures of both proteins are very similar, comprising two α-helices
connected by a central linker; they thus corroborate all our conclusions about SAP54 outlined
here.
Moreover, Iwabuchi et al. (2019) also reported that mutational changes in the α-helices resulted
in the loss of phyllody-inducing activity. In contrast to the effects of single amino acid
substitutions studied by us, Iwabuchi et al. (2019) investigated the consequences of the insertion
of two amino acids in a row in order to gain rotational shifts in the axes of the α-helices. While
insertions in either the first or second helix abolished the interaction with some MIKC-type
MTFs (SEP1 – SEP4), the degradation of SEP3, and the ability to induce disease symptoms

(phyllody), insertion in the linker region had no such effects. Likewise, Liao et al. (2019)
reported that some double amino acid substitutions in both either the first or second helix of
PHYL1PnWB abolished the interaction with the K-domain of SEP3 in Y2H experiments. These
findings, summarized in Figure 6 strongly corroborate all structure-function relationships
involving SAP54 outlined above.
Taken all three studies together, and considering the high sequence similarity also to other
homologous proteins (Figure 1), we have now a pretty good impression about the structure of
SAP54-like proteins: it comprises about 90 amino acids that fold into two α-helices connected
by a small, unstructured loop. SAP54-like proteins may not have a rigid structure, however; to
a certain degree it may depend on environmental conditions, and it may undergo conformational
changes upon binding to and release from K-domain (Liao et al. 2019). Also the functional
relevance of the structure for interaction with target proteins and for causing disease phenotypes
is now well documented (this study; Iwabuchi et al., 2019). These findings will help to better
understand the mode of action of SAP54-like proteins in plants.
In fact, our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of SAP54 activity is still quite limited.
This applies even to the basic facts of protein-protein interactions. What, to start with, is the
composite structure of SAP54 alone? Iwabuchi et al. (2019) found tetramers of SAP54 in the
crystals they investigated, but since SAP54 did not interact with itself in Y2H experiments, they
concluded that SAP54 exists as monomer. It is well known, however, that Y2H experiments
are biased against the detection of homodimer formation (Newman et al., 2000; Smirnova et
al., 1999), so this conclusion does not appear to be cogent. Liao et al. (2019) concluded from
sedimentation rates during analytical ultracentrifugation that native PHYL1PnWB exist as a
monomer. However, in their kind of experiment they also found monomers (and tetramers) of
K-domain fragments of SEP3, whereas in other experiments only dimers and tetramers had
been detected (Puranik et al., 2014). The conditions during analytical ultracentrifugation thus
may have promoted the dissociation of protein complexes. In line with this view, dimers seemed
to be present in the crystals assessed by Liao et al. (2019). In fact, employing dynamic light
scattering, we found complexes with an apparent molecular mass of ~20 kDa, suggesting that
SAP54 predominantly formed homodimers under our experimental conditions (Figure 5a,
Table 2). However, since the primary sequence of PHYL1PnWB is quite different from that of
SAP54 and PHYL1OY (Figure 1a) it currently cannot be completely ruled out that PHYL1PnWB
has a deviant interaction behavior, despite the high structural similarity of all three proteins.

Little is also known about heteromeric interactions of SAP54. It appears well established, at
least in A. thaliana, that binding of SAP54 to the K-domain of a specific subset of MIKC-type
MTFs is a prerequisite for the degradation of these proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway (UPP) (MacLean et al., 2014; Maejima et al., 2014). This binding likely depends on
sequence and structural similarity between SAP54 and the K-domain, which both fold into αhelices and contain heptad repeats facilitating the formation of coiled-coils, as previously
suggested (Rümpler et al., 2015). The similarity between SAP54 and the K-domain of MIKCtype MTFs may have originated by convergent evolution during which SAP54 achieved
molecular mimicry of the K-domain (Rümpler et al., 2015). More studies on the sequence and
structure of SAP54-like proteins in a phylogenetic context are required in the future to clarify
the case, but are potentially hampered by frequent horizontal transfer of SAP54 genes (Rümpler
et al., 2015).
For the sake of simplicity we have previously suggested that SAP54 may form heterodimeric
coiled-coils with the K-domain of MIKC-type MTFs (Rümpler et al., 2015). In line with this
are data obtained by cross-linking coupled mass spectrometry suggesting that PHYL1PnWB and
the K-domain of SEP3 dimerize via a quadruple-stranded coiled-coil interaction (Liao et al.,
2019). However, according to the dynamic light scattering and EMSA results reported here, it
now seems more likely that SAP54 preferentially targets multimers of MIKC-type MTFs rather
than monomers or dimers (Figures 5 and S4). This observation could probably even help to
explain the target specificity of SAP54. For several known targets of SAP54 (SEP1, SEP2,
SEP3, and SEP4) it has been shown that they are capable of forming DNA-bound
homotetramers (Jetha et al., 2014; Melzer et al., 2009; Rümpler et al., 2018), whereas AP3 and
PI that are unable to form homotetramers (Melzer and Theißen, 2009; Rümpler et al., 2018) are
not bound by SAP54 (MacLean et al., 2014). Furthermore, there is evidence that SAP54 binds
not only to MIKC-type MTFs, but also to RAD23C and RAD23D, i.e. a subset of the RAD23
proteins in A. thaliana (Iwabuchi et al., 2019; MacLean et al., 2014). RAD23 is known to
transfer ubiquitylated substrates to the 26S proteasome (Farmer et al., 2010), so SAP54 may
just function as an adapter that connects MIKC-type MTFs with RAD23 proteins to deliver
them to the proteasome (MacLean et al., 2014). The exact place and mode of RAD23 binding
to SAP54 is unknown, however several models have been proposed in which MIKC-type MTFs
and RAD23 bind simultaneously, or alternatively, to SAP54 (MacLean et al., 2014). α-helical
coiled coils are versatile protein domains that can contain more than two α-helices in parallel
or antiparallel direction (Lupas and Gruber, 2005), and RAD23 proteins have a high content of
α-helical structure (Farmer et al., 2010; Hurley et al., 2006). Thus, it is conceivable that not

only SAP54 and MIKC-type MTFs may form a multimeric coiled-coil structure, but probably
even RAD23 can be incorporated in such a complex. Future analyses of complexes of SAP54
with K-domains and/or RAD23 proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or X-ray
diffraction may clarify the case.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Sequence collection, multiple sequence alignment, and structure predictions
The sequence collection of SAP54 orthologues was compiled via nucleotide BLAST searches
(Altschul et al., 1990) against the NCBI nucleotide collection and whole as well as partial
genome sequences of diverse phytoplasma strains (Table S2) using the CDS of SAP54 from
AY-WB as query sequence. The nucleotide sequences were translated into the encoded amino
acid sequences using EXPASY translate (Gasteiger et al., 2003) and subsequently aligned with
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) applying L-INS-I mode. Secondary structure and 3D
structure predictions were performed using PCOILS (Lupas et al., 1991), PSIPRED (McGuffin
et al., 2000), Jpred4 (Drozdetskiy et al., 2015), SCRATCH Protein Predictor (Cheng et al.,
2005), QUARK Online (Xu and Zhang, 2012), and SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018).
Cloning of SAP54 and SEP375-178
The coding sequences of the secreted part of SAP54 from Aster Yellows-Witches’ Broom
phytoplasma (CP000061.1, AYWB_224) and SEP3 (NM_102272.4) K-domain (amino acids
75-178) were codon optimized for expression in E. coli strain K12 with JCAT (Grote et al.,
2005) (http://www.jcat.de/) and synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Table S3).
Restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI were introduced at the beginning and end of the coding
sequences. The synthesized sequences were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pET-15b
expression vector (Novagen, www.merckmillipore.com) using NdeI and BamHI restriction
sites to create expression constructs with an N-terminal 6-His-Tag followed by a thrombin
cleavage site (pET-15b-SAP54, pET-15b-SEP375-178). Mutated versions of SAP54 were
constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Zheng et al., 2004).
Expression and purification of SAP54 and SEP375-178
For protein expression E. coli Tuner (DE3) cells (Novagen, www.merckmillipore.com) were
transformed with pET-15b-SAP54 and pET-15b-SEP375-178 using heat-shock transformation.
Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C and
180 rpm. An overnight culture was used to inoculate pre-warmed medium (1:10) which was
then grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5. The culture was centrifuged,
resuspended and added to new medium until an OD600 of 0.8. Protein expression was induced
by addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested
3h after induction by centrifugation at 5000 x g at 4°C for 20 min. For purification, cells were
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) and one

tablet “cOmplete” protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, www.sigmaaldrich.com). The cells were
lysed and homogenized by ultrasonification and French Press® disintegration. The debris was
centrifuged at 15.400 x g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant was applied twice to a column
containing a gel bed of 2 ml nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, www.quiagen.com)
equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with one column volume of lysis
buffer, washing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and finally with
high salt buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). Elution of the His-tagged proteins was
performed using 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Fractions with
addition of thrombin protease (5 Units/mg protein, Merck, www.merckmillipore.com) were
pooled and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) over night at
4 °C. Success of the thrombin cleavage was verified via SDS-PAGE gel. The protein without
His-Tag was concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 Ultrafiltration Unit (3 kDa molecular weight
cutoff, Sartorius, www.sartorius.de). An appropriate volume was applied to a 1 ml loop of a gel
filtration column (Superdex75 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare, www.gehealthcare.com) of an Äkta
Avant System (GE Healthcare, www.gehealthcare.com). Protein fractions were assessed by
SDS-PAGE and fractions of interest were pooled and concentrated to 100 µM.
CD spectra collection
The purified protein was diluted to 20 µM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0,
determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm with extinction coefficients calculated by
ProtParam (ε SAP54 and ε SEP375-178= 4470, https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). Five accumulated
slow scan (20 nm per minute with a 1 nm slid width and a response time of 2 sec) CD spectra
of freshly prepared protein solutions were recorded in the range of 190 nm to 260 nm using a
JASCO J-710 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco, www.jasco.de) at 20 °C in a 1 mm quartz cuvette.
Background subtraction using a blank CD spectrum of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH
8.0, was carried out. The raw spectra were processed using the CAPITO web server application
(Wiedemann et al., 2013) (www.capito.nmr.leibniz-fli.de). For melting curves, the temperature
was increased stepwise by 5°C from 20°C to 90°C. Temperature increase was with a slope of
1°C/ min, the sample was kept at target temperature for 5 min before the CD spectra were
recorded using the same parameters as described above.
Dynamic light scattering
Dynamic light scattering of SAP54 and SEP375-178 were carried out in a Viscotek 802 DLS
device (Malvern Panalytical, www.malvernpanalytical.com) equipped with a 50 mW fiber
coupled 830 nm diode laser. For each protein solution, 50 simulated experiments (5s each) were

recorded at 20°C in 50 µl volume. Protein concentrations were in the range of 8-50 µM in 20
mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Mass weighted distribution of hydrodynamic radii and
a model of globular proteins were utilized to convert hydrodynamic radii to molecular weights.
Data acquisition and processing was carried out using the OmniSIZE 3.0 software (Malvern
Panalytical, www.malvernpanalytical.com).
Yeast two-hybrid screen
The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen was performed as described by (Wang et al., 2010) with
the following deviations: one additional -Leu/-Trp/-His plate was incubated at 28 °C for each
interaction series and interaction was scored after 5-7 days of incubation. Additionally, the
β-galactosidase assay was performed on -Leu/-Trp plates. An interaction was scored when
growth on both interaction plates (at 22 °C and 28 °C) and blue coloration of the colonies in the
β-galactosidase assay was observed. For in-detail procedures consult experimental
supplementary.
Yeast protein extraction and western blot
The expression of SAP54-wt and mutant versions as well as MIKC-type MTFs in yeast cells
was confirmed by protein extraction according to the protocol of Kushnirov (Kushnirov, 2000)
followed by SDS-PAGE, western blot and immuno-detection using monoclonal antibodies
raised in mouse against the GAL4 activation or binding domain (1:10000 dilution, Clontech,
www.clontech.com) following the Matchmaker Monoclonal Antibodies User Manuel from
Clontech. An antibody against α-tubulin (1:10000 dilution, abcam, www.abcam.com) was used
as a loading control for protein extracts. Proteins were detected using the Roti-Lumin Kit (CarlRoth, www.carlroth.com) and visualized in the ImageQuant LAS 4000mini (GE Healthcare,
www.gehealthcare.com).
Plant transformation and phenotyping
For SAP54 overexpression studies in A. thaliana Col-0 plants, the CDS of the secreted part of
SAP54-wt and mutant versions were cloned into the pGreen0229 vector under control of the
CaMV 35S promoter. The vectors were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101
cells (carrying the helper plasmid pSOUP) via electroporation at 1800 V using the
Electroporator 2510 (Eppendorf). Agrobacteria were screened via colony PCR using primers
flanking the 35S promoter region and the terminator region of the T-DNA. Correct clones were
used for “floral-dipping” following the protocol of Clough and Bent (Clough and Bent, 1998).
Plants were covered with plastic bags to retain moisture for 24 h. After maturity seeds were

collected and sown on soil. BASTA (0,001%, Bayer, www.bayer.com) was applied via spraying
to select transformed T1 seedlings. T1 plants were grown under long day conditions at 22 °C
and phenotyped using the z-stack function of a Leica M205 FA microscope (Leica,
www.leica.de).
Plant Protein extraction and western blot
For protein extraction from transformed plants, 80 mg of leaf and inflorescence material were
ground to a fine powder over 40 sec at 30 Hertz at 4°C using the Retsch MM 400 Mill (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, www.thermofisher.com) and were then resuspended in 200 µl
homogenization buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 2
mM PMSF, 40 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin). The solution
was centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 x g at 4°C and supernatant was used for western blot as
described above. Primary antibody against SAP54 (raised in rabbit, kindly provided by Saskia
Hogenhout, John-Innes Centre, Norwich) was used in a 1:2000 dilution.
In vitro transcription/translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
In vitro transcription/translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were
performed essentially as described by Melzer et al. (2009). The plasmids for in vitro
transcription/translation of A. thaliana SEP3, SEP3∆C (amino acids 1-188), SEP3∆K3C (amino
acids 1-152), SEP3∆KC (amino acids 1-92), AP1, AP3, PI, and AG, namely pTNT-SEP3,
pTNT-SEP3∆C,

pTNT-SEP3∆K3C,

pTNT-SEP3∆KC,

pSPUTK-AP1,

pSPUTK-AP3,

pSPUTK-PI, and pSPUTK-AG had been generated and described previously (Melzer et al.,
2009; Riechmann et al., 1996). DNA probe preparation and labelling had been described
previously (Melzer et al., 2009). The CArG-box sequence (5´-CCAAATAAGG-3´) used for
probe preparation was derived from the regulatory intron of A. thaliana AG. To test for binding
of SAP54 to DNA-bound MIKC-type MTF tetramers a 151-bp DNA probe was used that
contained two CArG-box sequences in a distance of 63 bp, i.e. six helical turns (sequence:

G-3´; CArG-box sequences are in italics). To test for binding of SAP54 to DNA-bound MIKCtype MTF dimers a DNA probe was used in which one of the two CArG-boxes and its flanking
regions were exchanged by a random sequence of the same base composition (sequence:

G-3´). The composition and final concentrations of the protein-DNA binding reaction buffer
were 1.6 mM EDTA, 10.3 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 1.3 mM Spermidine hydrochloride, 33.3
ng/μl Poly dI/dC, 2.5 % CHAPS, 4.3 % glycerol, and 3.72 μg/μl BSA. For each binding reaction
0.1 ng labelled DNA probe were co-incubated with 3 μl of in vitro translated MIKC-type
protein and either 1 μl purified SAP54 (13.3 μM) or 1 μl BSA (10 μg/μl) over night at 4 °C.
The co-operative DNA-binding assay shown in Figure S3 was performed essentially as
described by Melzer et al. (2009). A constant amount of 0.1 ng labelled DNA probe containing
two CArG-boxes was co-incubated with variable amounts of in vitro translated SEP3∆C,
ranging from 0.05 - 2 μl. After measuring the relative signal intensities of all fractions for each
lane using Multi Gauge 3.1 (Fujifilm), the ability of SEP3∆C to co-operatively bind to two
DNA-binding sites was quantified using equations as previously described (Melzer et al., 2009;
Senear and Brenowitz, 1991). To examine whether SEP3∆C still binds co-operatively to DNA
in the presence of SAP54, the same assay was performed while adding 1 μl purified SAP54
(13.3 μM) to each binding reaction.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Sequences and predicted structural features of SAP54-like proteins (phyllogens).
(a) Amino acid alignment of the secreted part of SAP54-like sequences from different
phytoplasma strains. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT applying L-INS-I mode. Black
triangles on top of the alignment highlight the amino acid positions of SAP54 from AY-WB
that were substituted by site directed mutagenesis. SAP54 homologues PHYL1OY from Onion
Yellows phytoplasma and PHYL1PnWB from Peanut witches’ broom phytoplasma, that have
been recently crystallized can be found under the synonyms “OY-W” and “NTU2011 (1)”,
respectively. (b) Secondary structure predictions based on the amino acid sequence of SAP54
from AY-WB (using Jpred4 and SCRATCH Protein Predictor) and the multiple sequence
alignment shown in (a) (using PCOILS, PSIPRED). PCOILS: Dotted, dashed, and solid lines
show the coiled-coil probability of the amino acid alignment in (a) for a sliding window size of
14, 21, and 28 amino acids, respectively. PSIPRED, Jpred4, and SCRATCH: Colored boxes
indicate high probability for the formation of an α-helix (blue), extended strand (orange), turn
(red), or bend (yellow), respectively. The green bar plot depicts the confidence of the PSIPRED
prediction. (c) 3D structure predictions for SAP54 from AY-WB using QUARK Online,
PSIPRED, SWISS-MODEL and SCRATCH Protein Predictor. The SWISS-MODEL
prediction only comprises the C-terminal part of SAP54 (residues 43-91).
Figure 2. CD spectra of SAP54-wt, its mutated versions and the K-domain of SEP3.
(a) CD spectra recorded on JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter for SAP54-wt, SAP54-L27P,
SAP54-I45P and SAP54-L65P and the K-domain of SEP3 at 20°C in 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 8.0, wavelength range of 190-280 nm at 1 nm intervals and a speed of 20 nm/min
using a cuvette of 1 mm path length. Protein concentrations were: SAP54-wt: 20.7 µM; SAP54L27P: 6.5 µM, SAP54-I45P: 10.6 µM; SAP54-L65P: 9.9 µM. Each spectrum represents an
accumulation of five background corrected spectra. (b) Placement of the examined proteins in
the Uversky plot, which allows a categorization of the folding state of the different proteins.

dark green, blue and light green, respectively. (b) Y2H interaction screen of SAP54-wt and
truncation mutants fused to the activation domain (AD) against SEP3 fused to the binding
domain (BD). Normal growth of yeast was controlled on SD-Leu-Trp plates (-L/-W).
Interactions were tested on SD-Leu-Trp-His plates with 3 mM 3-amino1, 2, 4-triazole
(-L/-W/-H) at two different temperatures (28 °C and 22 °C) and in four dilutions (1:10, 1:100,
1:1000, and 1:10000). (c) Summary of Y2H results for SAP54-wt and truncation mutants
against SEP3, AP1, AGL6, AG, AP3, and PI. Each interaction was tested twice in both
directions. A combination was scored as ‘interacting’ (green) if yeast growth was observed for
at least one direction.

Figure 5. Dynamic light scattering and EMSA experiments to investigate the stoichiometry of
SAP54/MIKC-type MTF complexes.
(a) Dynamic light scattering plot (mass-weighted scattering intensity distribution plotted
against the size of the hydrodynamic radius in nm) of SAP54, SEP375-178 and mixtures of both
proteins at different molar ratios. Molarities are based on the monomeric state of the proteins
and were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm with extinction coefficients calculated
using ProtParam (www.expasy.org/protparam/). For SAP54 three biological replicates were
measured. (b) EMSA in which in vitro translated SEP3 full length protein and truncated
versions were co-incubated with a radioactively labeled DNA probe carrying two MIKC-type
MTF binding sites (CArG-boxes). In lanes labeled with ‘+’ 1 μl purified SAP54 (13.3 μM) was
added to the binding reaction. In lanes labeled with ‘-’ 1 μl BSA (10 mg/ml) were added instead.
As negative controls, the empty pTNT vector was used as template for the in vitro
transcription/translation (lanes ‘pTNT e.v.’) or 30 μg BSA were added instead of in vitro
translated protein (lanes ‘BSA’). For size comparison, a radioactively labeled DNA ladder (100
bp DNA Ladder, New England BioLabs) was applied (lane M). (c) Same setup as in (b) using
a DNA probe that carries only one CArG-box sequence. (d) Same setup as in (b) using the
MIKC-type MTFs SEP3∆C, AP1, AG and the obligate heterodimer AP3/PI together with a
DNA probe carrying two CArG-box sequences. (e) Same setup as in (d) using a DNA probe
that carries only one CArG-box sequence. Asterisks (*) depict supershifts caused by addition
of SAP54.

Figure 6. Comparison of the results of this study, Iwabuchi et al. (2019) and Liao et al. (2019).
Aligned amino acid sequences of SAP54 from Candidatus phytoplasma asteris strain Aster
Yellows Witches’ Broom, PHYL1OY from Candidatus phytoplasma asteris strain Onion
Yellows and PHYL1PnWB from Candidatus phytoplasma Peanut witches’-broom phytoplasma.
Conserved amino acid positions are marked by blue background color. Single amino acid
substitutions to proline of SAP54 performed in this study, double alanine insertions of
PHYL1QY performed in Iwabuchi et al. (2019) and double amino acid substitutions of
PHYL1PnWB performed in Liao et al. (2019) are depicted by black triangles. SAP54/PHYL1OY
mutants that did not interact with known MIKC-type MTF targets in Y2H and that were unable
to induce phyllody symptoms when overexpressed in A. thaliana are color coded in red,
whereas mutants that were still able to induce phyllody are shown in green. Both PHYL1PnWB
double amino acid substitution mutants are color coded in red as they showed no interaction
with the K-domain of SEP3 in a His-pulldown assay, although PHYL1PnWB-I25KY32K to a
certain extent was still able to mediate degradation of SEP3, if both proteins were co-expressed
in Nicotiana benthamiana.
