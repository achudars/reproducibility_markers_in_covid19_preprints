Abstract

17

Background

18

Brucella spp. is a zoonotic bacterial agent of high public health and socio-economic importance. It

19

infects many species of animals including wildlife, and people may get exposed through direct

20

contact with an infected animal or consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. We

21

implemented a linked livestock-human cross-sectional study to determine seroprevalences and risk

22

factors of Brucella spp. in livestock and humans. We also estimated intra-cluster correlation

23

coefficients (ICCs) for these observations at the household and village levels.

24

Methodology

25

The study was implemented in Garissa County (specifically Ijara and Sangailu areas) and Tana River

26

(Bura and Hola) counties. A household was the unit of analysis and the sample size was derived

27

using the standard procedures. Serum samples were obtained from selected livestock and people

28

from randomly selected households. Humans were sampled in both counties while livestock could be

sampled only in Tana River County. Samples obtained were screened for anti-Brucella IgG

30

antibodies using ELISA kits. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects logistic

31

regression models with the household (herd) and village being used as random effects.

32

Results

33

The overall seroprevalences were 3.47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.72 – 4.36%) and 35.81%

34

(95% CI: 32.87 – 38.84) in livestock and humans, respectively. In livestock, older animals and those

35

sampled in Hola had significantly higher seroprevalences that younger ones or those sampled in

36

Bura. Herd and village random effects were significant and ICC estimates associated with these

37

variables were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22 – 0.60) and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.08 – 0.52), respectively. For human

38

data, older people, males, and people who lived in pastoral areas had significantly higher Brucella

39

spp. seroprevalences than younger ones, females or those who lived in irrigated or riverine areas.

40

People from households that had at least one seropositive animal were 3.35 (95% CI: 1.51 – 7.41)

41

times more likely to be seropositive compared to those that did not. Human exposures significantly

42

clustered at the household level; the ICC estimate obtained was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06 – 0.52).

43

Conclusion

44

The presence of a seropositive animal in a household significantly increased the risk of exposure in

45

people in that household. Brucella spp. exposures in both livestock and humans clustered

46

significantly at the household level. This suggests that risk-based surveillance measures, guided by

47

locations of primary cases reported, either in humans or livestock, can be used to detect Brucella

48

spp. infections livestock or humans, respectively.

51

Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease that primarily affects livestock and wildlife. In humans,

52

the disease is characterized by prolonged fever, body aches, joint pains and weakness while in

53

livestock, the disease causes abortions and infertility. We carried out a study in northeastern Kenya

54

(Garissa and Tana River Counties) to identify factors that affect the distribution of the disease in

55

people and livestock. Livestock and people from randomly selected households were recruited and

56

serum samples obtained for screening using anti-Brucella IgG ELISA kits to determine their

57

Brucella spp. exposure. Data obtained were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regression models.

58

Results obtained show that human and animal Brucella spp. seroprevalences cluster at the household

59

level. The odds of exposure in humans were at least three times higher in households that had at least

60

one seropositive animal compared to those that did not. These results can be used to design risk-

61

based surveillance systems where each Brucella infection identified in livestock or humans could

62

signal potential locations of other secondary infections.

Introduction

65
66

Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by gram-negative intracellular coccobacilli of the family

67

Brucellaceae. It is an economically important disease characterized by prolonged fever, night

68

sweats, body aches, arthralgia and weakness in humans and by abortions and infertility in livestock

69

[1]. There are at least ten Brucella spp.; six of these, i.e., B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. canis,

70

B. ovis and B. neotomae are considered classical species [2], with the first four being pathogenic to

71

man [3]. Brucella melitensis and B. аbortus are associated with most of the reported infections in

72

humans in the sub-Saharan Africa. Brucella spp. are naturally host-specific but in some

73

circumstances, some strains cause multi-host infections. B. melitensis and B. suis, for example, cause

74

caprine/ovine and porcine brucellosis and can also infect cattle. Its economic impacts are associated

75

with livestock productivity losses (longer calving intervals, reduced growth, increased incidences of

76

abortion, infertility, and calf mortality) and restrictions on livestock trade [4]. Human infections also

77

prevent infected individuals from engaging in productive occupations.

78
79

In livestock, Brucella transmission primarily occurs via contact with infected aborted material and

80

ingestion of contaminated feed [5]. Other modes of transmission include natural mating or artificial

81

insemination. Nomadic pastoralism [6] and large herd sizes [7] have been identified as key

82

predictors for exposure in livestock. Humans get exposed to the Brucella spp. from animal reservoirs

83

through consumption of unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked meat products, inhalation of

84

contaminated dust and contact with infected animal body fluids or tissues [5]. Person-to-person

85

transmission of the disease is rare; a few such cases have occurred through breastfeeding, trans-

86

placental transmission, blood transfusion and bone marrow transplantation [8]. Herders, livestock

87

owners, and abattoir workers have the highest risk of exposure [9].

88
89

The epidemiology of Brucella spp. is poorly known. It is generally thought that the disease is

90

endemic among the nomadic communities but the degree of association between livestock and

91

human exposure levels has rarely been determined. A study conducted in Marsabit County, Kenya

92

reported a 6-fold increase in the odds of human seropositivity in household that had a seropositive

93

animal compared to those that did not [10]. This estimate, though, was based on univariable analyses

94

and potential confounding was not accounted for. Another similar study conducted in Togo

95

established that brucellosis was not a major human health problem in the area as very few

96

seropositive individuals were found [11]. The disease was recently ranked among the top five most

97

important zoonotic diseases in the country based on its human health impacts [12]. Part of the

98

challenge arises from the fact that livestock cases, unlike those of humans, often do not manifest any

99

signs apart from initial abortions which occur before immunity is attained, yet infected animals

100

continue to shed the pathogen through milk or genital secretions. It will be difficult therefore to

101

identify carrier animals unless more sensitive and intensive risk-based surveillance measures are

102

deployed.

103
104

In this study, we determined patterns of occurrence of Brucella spp. seroprevalences in livestock and

105

humans at the household and village levels in Tana River and Garissa Counties, Kenya to obtain data

106

that can inform the development of One Health surveillance measures. The key focus was to

107

determine the strength of association between livestock and human exposures in the rural areas, and

108

to investigate patterns of clustering of the disease at the household and village levels.

Methods

111

Study area

112

This study was carried out in 2013 – 2014 in Bura and Hola irrigation schemes in Tana River

113

County, and Ijara and Sangailu, Garissa County (Figure 1). The study sites have been described by

114

Bett et al. [13]. Briefly, Bura irrigation and settlement scheme covered 2,100 ha with a tenant

115

population of slightly over 2,000 households settled in 10 villages while Hola irrigation and

116

settlement scheme covered 1,011 ha and had 700 farming households settled in 6 villages. Long-

117

term annual rainfall averaged 460mm and had a trimodal distribution with a major peak in October–

118

December, subsidiary peak in March-May, and minor peak in August-September. The average

119

temperature was 34ºC. Ijara and Sangailu fell under Ijara sub-County which borders Lamu County

and Boni forest to the East and Tana River County to the West. Its annual rainfall ranged between

121

750mm – 1000 mm while the mean temperature ranged between 15°C - 38°C.

122
123

Study design

124

A cross-sectional study design was used in the study with the primary sampling units being

125

individual livestock and people within selected households. The study aimed to estimate brucella

126

seroprevalence in the target area.

127
128

The sample size required was determined using the algorithm described by Humphry et al. [14].

129

Limited surveys had been done in the area to determine seroprevalences of the disease in livestock

130

and humans, and so a priori seroprevalences of 50% were used to obtain the highest possible sample

131

size. Other inputs included desired precision of the test, assumed to be 5%, a confidence level of

132

95%. The sensitivity and specificity of the SVANOVIR® Brucella-Ab C-ELISA that had been

133

identified for use in livestock at the design stage of the study is estimated to be 99.5% and 99.6%,

134

respectively in cattle [15]. A naïve sample size of 400 animals/humans was estimated based on these

135

parameters. Livestock and humans from the same households were however expected to have similar

136

exposure factors and hence their brucella exposures were likely to be correlated. The estimated

137

sample sizes were therefore adjusted for the design effect assuming an intra-household correlation

138

coefficient of 0.20 and that each household had 20 livestock and 5 people. No studies have been

139

done to estimate ICC for brucella but recommendations given by Otte and Gumm [16] suggest that,

140

for most infectious diseases, ICC values range between 0.04 – 0.42, with most values being less than

141

0.2. Adjusted sample sizes determined were 1920 animals and 720 people. This indicated that 144

142

households with both livestock and people were required for the study.

143
144

A sampling frame comprising a list of households in the study sites was drawn up with the help of

145

the village headmen and the managers of the Bura and Hola irrigation schemes and used in the

146

random selection of households and herds. A household was defined as a group of people who lived

147

together and shared common livelihood activities under a common household head while a herd

148

defined a group of animals owned by a household.

149
150

Animal sampling

151

Animal sampling was implemented by experienced technicians from the Department of

152

Veterinary Services. Data collected from each animal during blood sampling included age

153

(described as calf, weaner or adult), sex, breed and body condition score. These data were

154

collected using electronic forms designed using Open Data Kit (ODK) application and

155

downloaded to smart phones.

156
157

Up to 20 animals were randomly selected in each household/herd for sampling. Selected animals

158

were manually restrained, and blood collected by jugular venipuncture using a vacutainer needle.

159

Plain and EDTA-coated bar-coded vacutainer tubes were each used to collect 5-10ml of blood.

160

Serum was extracted from the plain vacutainer tube at the end of each day at the local livestock

161

office by centrifuging clotted blood at 3,000 rotations per minute for 5 minutes. Extracted serum

162

sample was transferred using sterile Pasteur pipettes into 2ml sterile bar-coded cryovials. Whole

163

blood from EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes was also transferred to 2ml sterile bar-coded

164

cryovials. These samples were stored and transported in dry ice to ILRI Biorepository Unit in

165

Nairobi. Serum and blood samples for each animal were prepared in duplicates.

Human sampling

168
169

A short questionnaire was administered to each subject after the consent process to collect data on

170

age, sex, occupation (farmer, pastoralist, herder, or student) and highest level of education attained.

171

To define occupation, farmers included individuals who grew crops or kept livestock under

172

sedentary production system particularly in the irrigated areas; pastoralists included individuals who

173

kept livestock as a the main source of livelihood and grazed them in communal grazing sites; herders

174

included people that were employed to look after other people’s livestock; and students included

175

household members who were in school or college at the time of sampling. These questionnaires

176

were also administered using ODK forms downloaded to smart phones.

177
178

Subjects were prepared for blood sampling by being seated in a comfortable position. The hand

179

used for blood collection was supported and a tourniquet applied above the elbow to distend the

180

veins. The blood collection site was then disinfected using alcohol swabs and an appropriate

181

vacutainer needle (21G for adults and 23G for children) used together with 10ml bar-coded plain

182

and EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes used to collect blood. Each tube was used to collect 5 ml of

183

blood. When adequate blood samples had been obtained, the tourniquet then the needle were

184

removed gently and carefully disposed in the sharps container without recapping and gentle

185

pressure applied to the puncture site for 30 seconds using a cotton swab. The swab was later

186

disposed of and elastoplast® applied to the punctured site. Whole blood from EDTA-coated

187

tubes and serum extracted from plain vacutainer tubes were each transferred to 2ml sterile bar-

188

coded cryovials at the local health centres. These samples were kept and transported in dry ice to

samples for each subject were prepared in duplicates.

191
192

Questionnaire survey

193

Semi-structured questionnaires (also designed using the ODK application) were administered to the

194

household heads. This collected information on participants’ demographics, knowledge, attitudes

195

and practices of the communities in relation to brucellosis transmission and control as well as

196

information on possible risk factors. Sampling forms were used to collect further information on

197

livestock ownership, herd size, type of livestock owned, age, sex and occupation.

198
199

Laboratory screening

200

Human samples were tested using anti-Brucella IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

201

(Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH Kiel, Germany) while animal samples were tested using Brucella

202

competitive ELISA kit (SVANOVIR® Brucella-Ab C-ELISA). The anti-Brucella IgG ELISA is

203

designed for qualitative measurement of IgG class of antibodies in human plasma or serum. It has a

204

high sensitivity (>99%) but it is vulnerable to non-specific reactions particularly to cross-reactions

205

with bacteria having lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The C-ELISA kit is based on S-LPS antigen and it

206

can detect B. abortus, B. melitensis and B. suis. This kit is more specific but less sensitive compared

207

to the anti-Brucella IgG ELISA since it targets specific epitopes of the Brucella LPS not shared with

208

other pathogens. All assays were performed as stipulated in the manufacturer’s standard operating

209

procedures.

212

Data collected were uploaded to the ILRI server at the end of each day using internet-enabled smart

213

phones. Each data file was saved as a comma delimited file (.csv). They were exported to Microsoft

214

Access 2010 for cleaning and merging, and finally to STATA version 13 for analysis.

215
216

Both livestock and human data were subjected to similar descriptive and inferential statistics.

217

Descriptive analyses commenced with the determination of the overall frequencies and prevalence

218

(with 95% confidence interval) of seropositive subjects in animals and humans. These estimates

219

were further stratified by all the categorical variables. For livestock data, categorical variables

220

included species (cattle, sheep or goats), sex, age (calf/lamb/kid, weaner or adult), area (Bura or

221

Hola) and land use (pastoralism or irrigation), while for human data these were sex, age (<17 years,

222

18-40 years or >40 years), occupation (pastoralism, farmer, student, other [e.g. business, housewife,

223

chief, etc.]), location (Ijara, Sangailu, Bura and Hola) and land use (pastoralism or irrigation).

224

Occupation was collapsed into the four levels defined above because the original form of the

225

variable had up to 13 levels with some of them having sparse data. Age (from the human data) was

226

also recoded into a 3-level categorical variable because the original form, which was captured as a

227

continuous variable, did not satisfy the linearity assumption during modelling (described below). To

228

determine the relationship between seropositivity in livestock and humans at the household level, a

229

dummy variable was created from livestock seropositivity data (from Tana River County) to indicate

230

whether there was at least one seropositive animal in a given household (value = 1) or not (value =

231

0). This was then merged with the human data using the household ID as the primary key.

232
233

Univariable logistic regression models were fitted to each dataset to identify unconditional

234

association between each of these variables with their respective outcomes (Brucella spp. exposure

235

status in animals and humans). Multivariable random effects logistic regression models were fitted to

236

these data through a combination of backward-forward variable selection technique with α=0.05.

237

The analysis used melogit command in STATA, with the default integration method and points (i.e.,

238

mean-variance adaptive Gauss–Hermite quadrature and 7, respectively). The analyses commenced

239

with a saturated model that was systematically reduced by removing variables (both fixed and

240

random effects) that had a p value > 0.05 based on likelihood ratio test (lrtest). The ICCs were

241

generated using the command estat icc. Deviance residuals and fitted values were generated and

242

used to evaluate the final models developed.

Ethics statement

249

Protocols used for human sampling were reviewed and approved by AMREF Ethics and Scientific

250

Review Committee (with a reference number: P65/2013). On the day of sampling, selected subjects

251

were taken through the consent process by a local clinician before being sampled in presence of a

252

witness identified by the subject. They also gave a written consent – one copy of the signed consent

253

form was kept by the clinician while another was kept by the subject. If the subject was a child aged

254

5-12 years, only the parent’s consent was obtained. If the selected individual was a child between

255

13-17 years of age, the subject’s assent was taken together with that of the parent or guardian. For

256

adults (18 years or more), personal consents were required. All these processes required the presence

260

For the livestock component, protocols were reviewed and approved by the International Livestock

261

Research Institute’s (ILRI) Institutional Animal Care and Uses Committee (IACUC) (reference

262

number 2014.02). ILRI IACUC is registered in Kenya and complies with the UK's Animals

(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/animal-research/)

264

that contains guidelines and codes of practice for the housing and care of animals used in scientific

265

procedures. The study adhered to the IACUC’s 3R principles of (i) replacement of animal with non-

266

animal techniques, (ii) reduction in the number of animals used, and (iii) refinement of techniques

267

and procedures that reduce pain and distress. Animal owners provided oral consent for animal

Results

271

Descriptive analyses

272

A total of 2,025 animals comprising 441 cattle, 961 goats and 623 sheep were sampled from 143

273

households in 20 villages in Tana River County. Most of these animals (76.59%, n = 1,551) were

274

from villages in the irrigated areas both in Bura and Hola while the rest were from the neighboring

275

pastoral areas. Overall, 71.11% (n = 1,440) of the animals were from Hola. Regarding species

276

distribution, all the sheep and cattle sampled in Bura were black head Persian and Orma Boran

277

breeds, respectively, while a majority (over 99%) the goats were Galla or Galla crosses. A similar

278

pattern was observed in Hola where 91.83% (n = 674) of the goats sampled were Galla breed or their

279

crosses and a large proportion of cattle and sheep sampled were Orma Boran and black head Persian

Hola) were sampled. The number sampled per household ranged from one to six with a mean of 2.81

287

(SE 0.07). A higher percentage of these subjects, 59.55% (n = 608), were females. Common

288

occupations included pastoralism (35.57%, n = 234), farmers (29.57%, n = 194), and student

289

(19.51%, n = 128). Others were formal employment, herdsman and housewife. The distribution of

290

the subjects by sites was balanced; 30.14% (n=308) were from Bura, 21.82% (n = 223) were from

291

Hola, 23.68% (n = 242) were from Sangailu and the rest 24.36% (n = 249) were from Ijara. In the

292

irrigated area, the source of water was mainly from canals while in the non-irrigated/pastoral area,

293

the main source of water was boreholes and dams.

antibodies. The overall seroprevalence in Hola (2.64%, 95% CI: 1.81 – 3.47%) was significantly

299

lower than that in Bura (5.29%, 95% CI: 3.48 – 7.12). The seroprevalences in cattle, goats and sheep

300

were 6.35% (95% CI: 4.06 – 8.63%), 3.33% (2.19 – 4.47%) and 1.44% (0.51 – 2.38%). These

301

estimates were stratified by sex, age, area and land use (pastoral verses irrigation and the results are

Humans

305

Using all the data from the four sites, 366 subjects (35.81%, 95% CI: 32.87 – 38.84%) were

306

seropositive for Brucella spp. Table 2 gives the distribution of these cases by the five independent

307

factors considered. The table also show similar results with reduced data set from two sites in Tana

308

River County. In both cases, males had higher prevalence than females and age was also positively

309

associated with increased levels of exposure. Regarding occupation, pastoralists had higher

310

seroprevalence than farmers, students or other occupations (including business, formal employment,

311

etc). The results further show that of the four areas sampled, Sangailu had the highest seroprevalence

312

of 54.13%, followed by Ijara, Hola and Bura with 47.39%, 26.46 and 18.83% seroprevalences,

313

respectively.

Risk factor analysis

Univariable analysis

322

Univariable analyses on the livestock data identified five out of six variables as being significant in

323

the naïve logistic regression model used. Age of an animal, species (cattle, sheep, goats), area from

324

which it came from (Hola verses Bura), and land use type in the area (irrigation verses pastoralism)

325

were significant as fixed effects while household ID and village ID were significant as random

326

effects. Sex was not significant (p= 0.23) and so this variable was not used in the subsequent

327

multivariable analyses. Herd size at the household level was also significant. This variable was used

328

as a continuous variable since it satisfied conditions for the linearity assumption.

329
330

Regarding human data, all the independent variables listed in Table 2 were significant in univariable

331

analyses. An additional variable (family size) was included in this analysis but it was found to be

332

non-significant. It was therefore not considered for the subsequent multivariable analyses.

333

Comparable results were obtained for the two sets of data described in Table 2 (i.e., with all the data

334

from Garissa and Tana River counties versus those from Tana River County alone where livestock

335

sampling was done). Multivariable analysis on human data therefore used data from Tana River only

336

since these allowed analyses on the association between livestock and human seroprevalences to be

337

evaluated.

Multivariable analysis

339

Table 3 gives the results of final mixed effects logistic regression model fitted to the livestock data.

340

Two significant fixed effects variables were age of the animal and area (though this is barely

341

significant at 95% confidence). We found an ordinal increase in the risk of exposure with age, while

342

for area, an animal from Bura was 3.73 times more likely to be exposed to Brucella spp. than that

343

from Hola. Land use and herd size were not significant in this model. A model used to investigate

344

interactions between age and area did not converge.

345
346

Village and herd IDs (with herd IDs nested within village) were used in the model as random effects

347

variables and both were significant (p = 0.00) in the model. The variances (SE) associated with

348

observations within a household and village were 1.30 (SE 0.81) and 0.87 (SE 0.45), respectively.

349

The internal correlation coefficient of exposures between animal within households was 0.40 (95%

Outputs from the model fitted to the human data (Tana River county) is presented in Table 4. Four

358

variables – age, gender, land use and exposure status of livestock in the household were significant.

359

There was an ordinal increase in the odds of seropositivity with age, and males had higher odds of

360

exposure than females. Similarly, people who lived in pastoral areas had higher odd of exposure.

361

The main finding was that the odds of exposure were 3.35 times higher in people from households

362

that had at least one seropositive animal compared to those that did not. The inclusion of herd

363

exposure at the household level rendered the village random effects variable to be insignificant (p =

364

0.13). The final model therefore had only one random effects variable – household, with an ICC

365

estimates of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06 – 0.52).

375

The overall herd level Brucella spp. seroprevalence was 25.87% (95% CI: 18.61 – 33.14%). This

376

was positively associated with herd size, and herds from Hola had higher odds of exposure than

377

those from Bura (Table 5). Herd size was kept in the model as a continuous variable since it met the

378

linearity assumption. The internal correlation coefficient indicating the correlation of observations

379

between herds from the same village was estimated to be 0.34 (95% CI: 0.10 – 0.69).

380

The overall household-level seroprevalences was 60.16 (95% CI: 54.93 – 65.23%). This varied

381

significantly by location. Sangailu and Ijara had the highest household-level seroprevalences of

382

81.72% (95% CI: 72.35 – 88.98) and 68.67% (95% CI: 58.59 – 77.64%), respectively. Those for

Hola and Bura were 51.39% (95% CI: 39.31 – 63.35%) and 38.00% (95% CI: 28.48 – 48.25%),

Discussion

389
390

We determined Brucella spp. seroprevalences and their risk factors in livestock and humans in two

391

contrasting ecological regions that practiced contrasting livelihood practices (i.e., pastoralism and

392

crop irrigation). The subject-level seroprevalences observed (ranging between 2.67 – 5.39% in

393

livestock and 18.83 – 54.13% in humans) are similar to those that have been reported previously in

394

other parts of Kenya. A study conducted by Osoro et al. [10] in Kiambu, Kajiado and Marsabit

395

Counties provided Brucella spp. seroprevalences in livestock of 1.2 – 13.5% and in people of 2.4% -

396

46.5%. The herd and household level seroprevalences obtained in the current study were also similar

397

to those reported earlier by Osoro et al.[10]. In this study, however, the household seroprevalences

398

(of 81.72% (95% CI: 72.35 – 88.98) observed in Sangailu where were exceptionally higher than any

399

of those reported earlier. This area (with Ijara) had a large population of livestock and wildlife and

400

the local people practiced pastoralism (discussed below) which could have promoted frequent

401

exposure to Brucella spp. and other zoonotic pathogens.

402
403

The multivariable models we used identified three factors – age, area and herd size – as being

404

significant predictors of Brucella spp. exposure in livestock. Older animals were generally

405

associated with increased risk of Brucella spp. exposure compared to younger ones. This is a

406

common finding with several possible explanations. First, compared to the young, older animals

407

have had more chances of encountering infectious hosts, and given that Brucella spp. antibodies can

408

persist in body tissues for a long time, seropositivity in adults might be representing past cumulative

409

exposures. Secondly, the communities involved in the study kept breeding herds for many years

410

unlike young animals that could be sold whenever there was need for money. We therefore expect a

411

higher replacement rate of the younger, non-breeding animals in a herd which might result in the

412

replacement of the few exposed subjects.

413
414

We observed a positive association between herd size and Brucella spp. seroprevalence. This

415

relationship has been reported in Ethiopia [17], Zambia [18], and Pakistan [19] and many other

416

areas. Large herds, especially those that comprise mixed species allow more efficient transmission of

417

Brucella spp. [20]. This is because large herds have a high number of susceptible hosts and higher

418

numbers of effective contacts, permitting endemic circulation of the pathogen over time. In pastoral

419

areas, large herds are often raised under traditional management practices that further contribute to

420

Brucella spp. transmission. These include communal grazing, natural breeding, and confinement in

421

small enclosures that encourage close contact, especially in the night. Brucella spp. transmission

422

models show that the disease is persistent in pastoral areas and its interventions should include those

423

that manage ecosystems such as land reform, maintenance of adequate stocking rates, and an

424

integrated social and economic development [20].

425
426

The intra-herd correlation coefficient of Brucella spp seropositivity estimated in the study (of 0.39)

427

was about two times higher than that between herds (0.18), an indication that livestock cases

428

clustered more at the herd than at the village level. This finding suggests that within-herd exposures

429

played a stronger role than those between herds. Pasture contamination is considered as one of the

430

main modes of transmission of the pathogen in livestock but the duration over which the pathogen

431

remains viable in the environment in this area, given the high day-time temperatures, is not known.

432

At the same time, livestock share grazing and watering areas which further increases chances of

433

pathogen transmission. Based on observations made by Otte and Gumm [16] that most infectious

434

diseases have ICC values of less than 0.2, it is apparent that brucellosis is one of the diseases with

435

the highest inter-herd correlation coefficient.

436
437

Many studies have identified risk factors for Brucella spp exposure in humans. This study identified

438

age, gender and land use as being important determinants of Brucella spp. exposure. Older people

439

had higher odds of exposure than younger, and men had higher odds of exposure than women. A

440

study conducted in the northern Kenya indicated that regular ingestion of raw milk, herding, milking

441

and feeding goats and handling of hides were associated with increased of exposure to Brucella spp.

442

[10]. In Northern Tanzania, Kunda et al [21] also confirmed that assisting animals give birth

443

enhances the risk of exposure to Brucella spp. In general, any livelihood practices that encourages

444

intense contact with infected animals, or consumption of its products would increase the risk of

445

brucellosis.

446
447

On the relationship between human and animal Brucella spp. seroprevalences, this study established

448

that controlling for the other covariates, the odds of a person being exposed to Brucella spp. was

449

3.34 times higher in households that had at least one seropositive animal compared to people in

450

households that did not. Osoro et al. [10] conducted a similar analysis in northern Kenya but they

451

used univariable models which can be more sensitive to confounding than those used here. Our

452

observations on high degree of clustering at the household/herd level and a strong association

453

between human and livestock exposures suggest an important opportunity for the deployment of One

454

Health surveillance and control for the disease. It is possible to use initial cases identified in animals

455

or humans to identify households where additional cases are likely to be occur. This requires

456

exchange of surveillance data between public and animal health institutions, and the implementation

457

of coordinated responses to manage the existing cases and prevent further exposures. Public health

458

workers, for example, should be able to advice animal health workers to trace infected animals in

459

households where a patient diagnosed with brucellosis comes from to reduce chances of re-infection,

460

and to protect other members of the household. For those cases where the animal health workers

461

cannot access screening materials, participatory techniques that include using case definitions that

462

includes history of abortion should be used to detect and remove infected animals.

463
464

The study had a few limitations. First, it was designed as a cross sectional survey which can’t

465

investigate dynamic changes in Brucella spp seroprevalence. Secondly, samples were screened using

466

serological tests which do not (i) allow for the characterization of the pathogen by species as it

467

targets immunodormant Brucella antigens associated with the smooth LPS that is shared by multiple

468

naturally occurring biovars of B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. suis and others [19], (ii) allow for

469

confirmation of a subject’s infection status as the presence of antibodies does not necessarily suggest

470

current infection. Humoral IgG responses remain detectable for a long time (and might last for years)

471

and the excretion of Brucella spp. occurs occasionally, more so during abortions [19]. The isolation

472

of the bacteria and the detection of its DNA by PCR, and to some extent the detection of IgM

473

antibodies, remain the most reliable means of detecting active infections.

474

Conclusions

475
476

Our study gives evidence of a strong association between human and animal seropositivity at

477

household level. The other important risk factors are occupation, age, sex, and land use; these should

478

be taken into consideration when designing interventions against the disease. There is also high

479

prevalence of brucellosis in human and livestock, and it is higher in the predominantly pastoralist

480

communities. We recommend further research to characterize Brucella spp. strains that are

481

circulating in these areas to understand how these pathogens are shared between wildlife, livestock

482

and people.
