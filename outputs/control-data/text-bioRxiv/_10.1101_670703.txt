32

Bifunctional Rel stringent factors, the most broadly distributed class of RSHs, are

33

ribosome-associated enzymes that transfer a pyrophosphate group from ATP onto the

34

3′ of GTP or GDP to synthesize (p)ppGpp and also catalyse the 3′ pyrophosphate

35

hydrolysis of the alarmone to degrade it. The precise regulation of these enzymes seems

36

to be a complex allosteric mechanism, and despite decades of research, it is unclear how

37

the two opposing activities of Rel are controlled at the molecular level. Here we show

38

that a stretch/recoil guanosine-switch mechanism controls the catalytic cycle of T.

39

thermophilus Rel (RelTf). The binding of GDP/ATP stretches apart the NTD catalytic

40

domains of RelTf (RelTtNTD) activating the synthetase domain and allosterically blocking

41

the hydrolase active site. Conversely, binding of ppGpp unlocks the hydrolase domain

42

and triggers recoil of both NTDs, which partially buries the synthetase active site and

43

precludes the binding of synthesis precursors. This allosteric mechanism acts as an

44

activity switch preventing futile cycles of alarmone synthesis and degradation.

45

The cellular level of the bacterial alarmone (p)ppGpp1,2 – a key regulator of virulence and

46

antibiotic tolerance – is controlled by the action of RelA/SpoT Homologue (RSH) enzymes3-

47

5

48

of GDP or GTP, and these molecules are degraded by removal of the 3 pyrophosphate

49

moiety. The paradigm of RSH catalysis is based on the structure of S. dysgalactiae Rel

50

(RelSeqNTD) solved more than a decade ago. RelSeqNTD is formed by two catalytic domains with

51

opposing activities – ppGpp hydrolase (HD) and ppGpp synthetase (SYN)6. Serendipitously,

52

the two RelSeqNTD molecules observed in the same crystal lattice were locked in contrasting

53

conformations leading to the hypothesis of reciprocal regulation of SYN and HD domains in

54

archetypical RSH enzymes. However, the enzyme contained a nucleotide bound in each

55

active site in one of the conformations and only one active site occupied in the other one.

56

This contradicts earlier observations that suggested catalysis was incompatible with the

57

simultaneous activation of synthetase and hydrolase function7,8. Thus, to directly test this

58

hypothesis it is essential to solve the structures of Rel enzymes with catalytically engaged

59

SYN or HD domains. To understand how nucleotide binding stimulates the enzymatic

60

capacity of RSH enzymes, we took advantage of T. thermophilus Rel NTD (RelTtNTD, amino

61

acid positions 1-355) as an experimental system. RelTtNTD hydrolysis activity is virtually

62

undetectable at 4°C (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1), which is not

63

surprising given that T. thermophilus has an optimal growth temperature of about 65°C. This

64

enabled co-crystallization in the presence of the native ppGpp substrate. To generate the

65

structure of RelTtNTD engaged in ppGpp synthesis, we used APPNP, a - phosphate non-

. The synthesis of (p)ppGpp involves transfer of the pyrophosphate group of ATP onto the 3

66

hydrolysable ATP analogue, that reacts exceedingly slowly with GDP in the active center of

67

RelTtNTD yielding ppGpNp (Supplementary Fig. 1b-c and Supplementary Table 1).

68

The structure of unbound RelTtNTD (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a-d) recapitulates the

69

structures of RelSeqNTD, M. tuberculosis Rel9 (RelAMtbNTD) as well as the mono-functional

70

synthetase-only E. coli RSH RelA (RelAEc). Only the conformation of -helices 6, 7 and

71

loop 6- 7 are noticeably different (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d). In RelAEc the 6- 7 loop is

72

projected towards the pseudo-hydrolase site of RelAEc, effectively blocking the site, whereas

73

in RelTtNTD, RelAMtbNTD and RelSeqNTD 6- 7 is partially disordered and pointing in an

74

opposite direction6,10-12 (Supplementary Fig. 2e-f). Nucleotide-free RelTtNTD contains two

75

different conformations in the same crystal lattice with a similar arrangement of both

76

catalytic domains. The major difference between both conformations is that the 6- 7 motif

77

of the hydrolase domain is observed projected completely away from the active site with -

78

helix 6 largely unwound in an extended conformation (Supplementary Fig. 2c-d and 2f).

79

Although this extreme conformation is primarily stabilized by the lattice contacts and likely

80

to be a result of the crystallization process, it underscores the highly dynamic nature of the

81

hydrolase domain, in particular the 6- 7 motif and its importance for catalysis.

82

From the structure of the RelTtNTD-ppGpp complex (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3), it is

83

immediately apparent that the complex is in a more compacted conformation than the resting

84

state of RelTtNTD diverging from all other known conformation of Rel and RelA enzymes

85

(Fig. 1a and 1b). In the complex, ppGpp makes a large number of contacts with the enzyme

86

(Fig. 1c) and is bound in a conformation reminiscent of that of ppG2 :3 p in the active site of

87

RelSeqNTD and NADP bound to a single-domain small alarmone hydrolase (SAH) RSH

88

hMesh113 (PDBID 5VXA) (Supplementary Fig. 4a-b). The guanosine base is stacked

89

between R43, R44 and M157 and makes hydrogen-bonds with S45, N150 and T153, while

90

the ribose makes a van der Waals interaction with N150 and a hydrogen bond with Y49. The

91

2 - and 3 oxygen atoms from the ribose are held very close (within 4.5 Å) to the Mn2+ ion

92

and N150, which suggests an essential role for the metal ion in the deprotonation of the

93

scissile bond and subsequent stabilization of a nucleophilic water molecule (Fig. 1c).

94

The hydrolase active site has a remarkable distribution of surface electrostatics. The site

95

consists of a deep and wide cavity with one half of the site positively charged and involved in

96

the stabilization of the 5 poly-phosphate groups of the substrate and the other predominately

97

acidic and more directly involved in the 3 -pyrophosphate hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig.

98

4c). The 3 -pyrophosphate group of ppGpp is bound in nearly the same position as that of

99

ppG2 :3 p (Supplementary Fig. 4a) in the acidic half of the active site formed by D77, E80,

100

D81, E104 and D146 which is crucial for catalysis. This acidic section of the active site has

101

already been highlighted as a functional hot-spot6. Substitutions in the conserved HDX3ED

102

motif14 (GD or EV) completely abrogate hydrolysis in RelSeqNTD6 and the motif has diverged

103

to 82FPLADA87 in the inactive hydrolase domain of E. coli RelA suggesting this could be one

104

of the factors contributing to the lack of activity of the specialised E. coli synthetase. Indeed,

105

conservative substitutions of E80 (E80Q) and D81 (D81N) or even changes in the distance of

106

the carboxylate group relative to ppGpp in the HD domain (as in D81E) have a strong effect

107

on the activity of the enzyme (Fig. 1d).

108

The 5 - pyrophosphate group of ppGpp is stabilized by the damping effect of K112, K143,

109

R147 and K161 and projects towards the -helix 6 (Fig. 1c). From this binding mode we

110

propose that the relative spatial arrangement between 6 and 9 would determine the

111

specificity of the hydrolase function. Indeed, as observed in the RelSeqNTD-ppG2 :3 p and

112

hMesh1-NADP complexes, it is the local disposition of 6 and 9 what allows

113

accommodation of the 5 -pyrophosphate and nicotinamide riboside groups (Supplementary

114

Fig 4a-b). As with the case of the acidic patch, substitutions at this positive site (R147G),

115

towards the phosphate binding region also strongly affect hydrolysis (Fig 1d).

116

The other crucial observation from the RelTtNTD-ppGpp complex is that the entire SYN

117

domain moves 6 Å closer to the HD domain compared to the resting state, sterically

118

occluding and switching off the synthetase active site (Fig. 1a-b Supplementary Fig 5a-b).

119

In addition, the 6- 7 loop becomes fully structured and moves around 85° away from the

120

position occupied by 6- 7 in RelAEc in the pseudo-active site of the HD domain. This

121

movement of 6- 7 aligns together all the residues that constitute the aforementioned

122

positive patch and allows the binding ppGpp in the active site. As a result, the hydrolase site

123

of the enzyme becomes fully accessible in contrast with the synthetase site that is even more

124

confined (Supplementary Fig. 5a-b).

125

To understand how substrates control the ppGpp synthesis by the SYN domain, we solved the

126

structure of RelTtNTD in a post-catalytic (PC) state (Fig. 1e) in complex with the reaction

127

products AMP and ppGpNp (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 6). The structure of RelTtNTD in

128

this PC conformation (Fig. 1e) shows a remarkably contrasting picture with the RelTtNTD-

129

ppGpp complex (Fig. 1b). The presence of two nucleotides in the synthetase site is

130

accompanied by major rearrangements that stretch both domains almost 45 Å apart (Fig. 1e).

131

The comparison of the two opposing conformations of the two active catalytic states suggest

132

a potential allosteric signal transduction route (Fig. 1g). The central 3- -helix bundle (C3HB)

134

that connects both catalytic domains 6. The wedging effect of the nucleotides is thus spread

135

towards the HD domain via the 13-C3HB ‘transmission’ core that has swivelled

136

orthogonally to the 9 dipole approximately 60° (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 6b-c).

137

This fractures 11 in two ( 11’ and 11’’), exposing the SYN domain active site and

138

stretching the HD domain away. This conformational rearrangement portrays a much bigger

139

allosteric effect associated with the switch to an active synthetase state than that expected

140

from the two conformations of RelSeqNTD which involved a rotation of 10° stretching both

141

domains around 2.4 Å apart6. Considering the lattice constraints and the partial occupancy of

142

nucleotides in both active sites of RelSeqNTD, it is not surprising that the enzyme is observed in

143

an intermediate state closer to the resting state than to either active catalytic conformation.

144

In the HD domain, these rearrangements are accompanied by a conformational change in

145

loop 6- 7 that approaches towards the catalytic residues of the hydrolase centre (Fig. 1h).

146

These structural changes effectively close the hydrolase site, reducing its radius to almost

147

half its size and expanding the radius and dimensions of synthetase active site in order to

148

accommodate both nucleotide substrates (Supplementary Fig. 6b-c). From the structure of

149

the free RelTtNTD and RelSeqNTD bound to GDP, it is clear that only the presence of both

150

nucleotides in the active site of the synthetase domain can trigger such large domain

151

rearrangements.

152

The PC active site of RelTtNTD resembles the pre-catalytic state observed in the structure of

153

the RelP SAS enzyme from S. aureus, a single-domain (p)ppGpp synthetase-only RSH

154

enzyme that lacks additional catalytic or regulatory domains. The overall interactions of

155

ppGpNp with the synthetase active site are similar to those observed in the RelP-GTP-APCPP

156

(PDBID 6EWZ) and RelP-pppGpp (PDBID 6EX0) complexes15 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary

157

Fig. 7a-b). Only small differences in the orientation of the G-loop16 and the accommodation

158

of the ligand are observed due to the lack of the additional phosphate group that is present in

159

both RelP complexes (Supplementary Fig. 7b). The coordination of the adenosine group of

160

AMP in the active site also resembles that of the pre-catalytic RelP with the adenosine base

161

stacked between R249 and R277 and the -phosphate of AMP coordinated in the same

162

manner as that observed in the RelP-GTP-APCPP complex by R249 and K215

163

(Supplementary Fig. 7b). In addition, the 1- 13 loop and 13 contribute a patch of positive

164

residues that stabilize the pyrophosphate group transferred to ppGpNp, which is around 2.0 Å

165

away from the site it would occupy in a pre-catalytic state, similar to that of RelP, as part of

166

APCPP. These two active site elements are observed in a similar orientation to that of the 1-

168

Fig 7b). Indeed mutations that destabilize ATP binding and affect the interaction of

169

GDP/GTP with the G-loop (R249A, D272, R277A and Y329A) have a strong impact on the

170

activity of the native full length RelTt when it is assayed by itself or when the enzyme is

171

activated by either T. thermophilus 70S ribosome initiation complex (70S IC) or the 70S IC

172

with deacylated tRNAVal in the A-site, the ultimate natural activator of ppGpp synthesis by

173

RelTt (Fig 1i).

174

Our structural data suggest that the presence of nucleotides in either the hydrolase or the

175

synthetase domain would prime the enzyme for that particular function, switching off the

176

other catalytic site. Such an allosteric effect would manifest itself in the form of changes in

177

the width of the conformational landscape that would tilt the dynamic equilibrium of the

178

population ensemble towards the favoured state as a function of the concentration of the

179

nucleotides in solution. We directly challenge this hypothesis using single-molecule

180

fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). For this, we constructed RelTtNTD6/287, a

181

variant of RelTtNTD that allows fluorescent labels to be attached at cysteine residues

182

introduced at positions 6 and 287 (Fig. 2a). The FRET-averaged inter-dye distance ⟨RDA⟩E

183

predicted for RelTtNTD6/287 based on our crystal structures is 75 Å for the open form (RelTtNTD-

184

AMP-ppGpNp complex) and 57 Å for the closed form (RelTtNTD-ppGpNp complex).

185

While in the presence of ppGpp, RelTtNTD6/287 shows a homogenous population with ⟨RDA⟩E of

186

64 Å (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig 8a), when incubated with GDP combined with the

187

non-hydrolysable ATP analogue – APCPP – the RelTtNTD6/287 population shifted to a ⟨RDA⟩E

188

of 72 Å consistent with the opening of the enzyme (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig 8b).

189

These clearly different conformational states matched the theoretical states expected from the

190

aforementioned crystal structures (Fig. 1b and Fig. 1e). In the presence of APCPP alone,

191

RelTtNTD6/287 remained in the closed conformation (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig 8c).

192

Conversely, GDP triggered the opening of the enzyme (⟨RDA⟩E of 70 Å) (Fig. 2e and

193

Supplementary Fig 8d). Interestingly, when ATP was added after pre-incubating the

194

enzyme with GDP, the ppGpp produced as a result of the reaction returned the equilibrium to

195

the closed state (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig 8e). This suggests the reaction occurs in a

196

sequential manner with the guanosine substrates binding first in the active site.

197

To directly address the sequential binding hypothesis, we monitored the binding of these

198

nucleotides using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). GDP binds RelTtNTD with an

199

affinity of 23 M (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 2) and in excellent agreement with the

200

smFRET data APCPP alone does not bind RelTtNTD (Supplementary Fig. 9a and

201

Supplementary Table 2). However, once the RelTtNTD-GDP complex is formed, APCPP

202

binds with an affinity of around 50 M (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 2). The

203

incorporation of both GDP and APCPP is entropically driven (Supplementary Fig 9b and

204

Supplementary Table 2). In the case of the binding of GDP to the SYN-domain, the release

205

of ordered water molecules from the GDP binding cleft is accompanied by the movement of

206

α

207

observed in the crystal structure. All these structural changes are consistent with entropically

208

driven binding events. The smFRET data shows that GDP binding is also coupled to the

209

opening of the enzyme which reveals the otherwise buried ATP biding site. In addition, it

210

creates an ‘entropy reservoir’ that drives the binding of APCPP with the the release of water

211

molecules from the now exposed binding cleft. This supports the notion that GDP must

212

‘open’ the enzyme to reveal the ATP binding site, as predicted from the analysis of the

213

crystallographic data.

214

We hypothesized that the motions of the 6- 7 loop were coupled to the allosteric switching

215

of the enzyme, constituting a crucial element of the intramolecular crosstalk between

216

domains. In the hydrolase-ON (RelTtNTD-ppGpp complex, close state), this loop was projected

217

away from the hydrolase active site allowing the binding of ppGpp whereas in the synthetase-

218

ON state (RelTtNTD post-catalytic open state) 6- 7 moved towards the hydrolase active site

219

precluding the binding of ppGpp, effectively switching off the hydrolase function. We used

220

RelTtNTD6/124, a RelTtNTD variant fluorescently labelled via cysteine residues introduced at

221

residue positions 6 and 124 (Fig. 2i). In the presence of ppGpp, RelTtNTD 6/124 is observed in a

222

low FRET state of ⟨RDA⟩E 62 Å, indicating displacement of the loop away from the active site

223

(Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 8f). Conversely, when bound to GDP and APCPP, the

224

enzyme switched to a high FRET state (⟨RDA⟩E of 55 Å) indicative of the loop movement

225

towards the active site (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig. 8g). These smFRET data are in

226

good agreement with ⟨RDA⟩E estimates based on the structural data that predicts a distance

227

between dyes of 51 Å for the open state and 60 Å for the closed. The removal of the Mn2+ ion

228

from the hydrolase site by incubation with EDTA, precluded the close conformation even in

229

the presence of ppGpp (Fig. 2l and Supplementary Fig 8h). These observations support the

230

role of 6- 7 as an allosteric ‘snaplock’. When the snaplock is stabilized away from the

231

hydrolase active site, the enzyme is predominantly in the closed state and in the hydrolase-

232

ON conformation. By contrast, releasing the snaplock leads to closure of the hydrolase active

μ

6- 7 that partially occludes the HD active center and an increase in the enzyme flexibility as

site and the ‘snap’-opening of the enzyme exposing the synthetase active site

234

(Supplementary Fig 6b-c).

235

The dynamic modulation of the cellular alarmone levels is paramount to maintenance of

236

cellular homeostasis. Here we showed that Rel enzymes possessing active hydrolase and

237

synthetase domains rely on additional levels of allosteric regulation besides the control that

238

the C-terminal regulatory domains exert, which prevent the occurrence of futile catalytic

239

cycles. The activation of one of the catalytic domains entails the physical blockade and active

240

site misalignment of the other. Our results support the view that the allosteric motion of -

241

helices 6 and 7 is coupled to the catalytic cycle precluding or allowing the access of

242

substrate to the hydrolase active site whereas the relative conformational state between

243

domains regulates the synthetase function, hindering access to the synthetase site in the close

244

state. This allosteric control provides a bona fide on/off switch that renders one domain

245

completely blocked while the other is active (Fig. 3). In addition, our results suggest that the

246

allosteric control of long RSH enzymes may differ from that of SASs such RelP or RelQ that

247

also bind their substrates in an ordered sequence but incorporate first with ATP and then

248

GDP or GTP17. We show that in long RSH enzymes this sequence is reversed. This

249

divergence in the catalytic mechanism is most likely due to the loss of the hydrolase domain

250

and with it the requirement of triggering an open state in SASs to bind ATP.

251

The current view of the role of nucleotides in the control of Rel enzymes, based on known

252

structures, does not provide a conclusive explanation as to how the conformational interplay

253

between the two catalytic domains is linked to the activation of one site to the detriment of

254

the other. Moreover in all known structures of different RSH enzymes the two catalytic

255

domains are observed in similar conformations that are incompatible with an active

256

synthetase state6,9-12.

257

The regulation of catalysis of bifunctional enzymes is usually dominated by allosteric

258

transitions preventing the occurrence of futile cycles18. The stretch/recoil mechanism we

259

propose provides the basis for the macromolecular control of the enzyme by its opposing

260

substrates. The synchronous action of this additional regulatory layer, together with the

261

spatial control of the ribosome as the docking platform of the enzyme for (p)ppGpp

262

synthesis10-12 or the PTS for ppGpp hydrolysis19, denote a tightly regulated mechanism that

263

prevents the occurrence of futile catalytic cycles and facilitates the action of the alarmone as

264

a bacterial phenotypic switch.

(c), APCPP (d), GDP (e) and GDP+ATP (f). The analysis of the smFRET data suggest that the high FRET
state of the enzyme in the presence of ppGpp and APCPP is consistent with the closed form observed in the
crystal structure of the complex with ppGpp. By contrast the low FRET state of the enzyme observed in the
presence of GDP and GDP+APCPP is consistent with the open state of the enzyme observed in the structure
of RelTtNTD-ppGpNp-AMP. (g) Titration of GDP into RelTtNTD. (h) Titration of APCPP into RelTtNTD in the

associated with the nucleotides allosteric control). 1D projection histograms of the FRET efficiency of the
RelTtNTD6/124 in the presence of ppGpp (j), GDP+APCPP (k) and ppGpp+EDTA (l). The lower FRET state of
the hydrolase domain in the presence of ppGpp is consistent with the movement of α-helices α6 and α7
which allow the binding of the substrate into the active site. By contrast the higher FRET state observed in
the presence of GDP+APCPP is compatible with the snaplock switch that closes the hydrolase state coupled
to the activation of the synthetase domain and the overall stretching of both catalytic domains.

catalysis as a function of nucleotides. In absence of ligands the resting state of the
enzyme is consistent with the conformations observed in RelAMtbNTD and RelAEc with the
catalytic site of the SYN-domain is partially occluded (the ATP binding site completely buried in
the resting state). The ppGpp synthesis cycle is initiated by GDP binding which triggers an open
form that allows the consequent binding of ATP, followed by the synthesis of ppGpp. Moreover,
the stabilization of this open state is coupled to changes in the active site of the HD-domain, that
preclude hydrolysis. Conversely, ppGpp binding to the HD-domain triggers the overall closing of
the enzyme resulting in the complete occlusion of the active site of the SYN-domain safeguarding against non-productive ppGpp synthesis and the alignment of the active site residues in
the HD-domain to accommodate ppGpp and catalyze the hydrolysis of the 3′-pyrophosphate
group of the molecule.
