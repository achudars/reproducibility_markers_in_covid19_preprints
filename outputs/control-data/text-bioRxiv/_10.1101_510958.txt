Abstract
Molecular evolution is believed to proceed in small steps. The step size can be defined by a distance
reflecting physico-chemical disparities between amino acid (AA) pairs that can be exchanged by single 1 bp
mutations. We show that AA substitution rates are strongly and negatively correlated with this distance but
only when positive selection is relatively weak. We use the McDonald and Kreitman (MK) test to separate
the influences of positive and negative selection. While negative selection is indeed stronger on AA
substitutions generating larger changes in chemical properties of amino acids, positive selection operates by
different rules. For 65 of the 75 possible pairs, positive selection is comparable in strength regardless of AA
distance. However, the 10 pairs under the strongest positive selection all exhibit large leaps in chemical
properties. Five of the 10 pairs are shared between hominoids and Drosophila, thus hinting at a common but
modest biochemical basis of adaptation across taxa. The hypothesis that adaptive changes often take large
functional steps will need to be extensively tested. If validated, molecular models will need to better
integrate positive and negative selection in the search for adaptive signal.

Introduction
It is generally accepted that natural selection favors incremental small-step changes. In the
accompanying paper (Chen and Wu), we use physico-chemical distances between amino acids (AAs) as a
measure of step size in evolution. When negative selection is the main driving force, similar AAs are indeed
more likely to be exchanged. After all, a mutant must not be too different from the wild type in order to
avoid elimination. This intuition is a key rule of neutral molecular evolution (Kimura 1983).
On the other hand, it is not obvious that positive selection should also favor small-step changes. The
most common reference is Fisher’s geometric model (FGM) (Fisher 1930), whereby small-step changes
would have a better chance of being advantageous than large-step ones. Nevertheless, a key element of
FGM is still the avoidance of negative selection. In FGM, each mutation is assumed to be highly pleiotropic
and large-step changes are likely to be deleterious for some phenotypes (Wagner and Zhang 2011).
An opposite argument for large-step evolution can be stated as follows: Natural selection, either
positive or negative, can “discern” large-step changes better than small-step ones. For example, replacing
isoleucine (Ile) with the chemically similar Valine (Val) would not alter the protein structure as much as its
replacement by Arginine (Arg), which is very different chemically. In this view, an Ile à Arg replacement
may be either much worse, or much better, than the Ile à Val replacement. Therefore, while negative
selection would accept small-step changes (e.g., Ile à Val), positive selection might in fact favor large-step
ones (e.g., Ile à Arg). The conventional wisdom is a postulate, not a fact.
Clearly, the arguments must be resolved by empirical means. The companion study (Chen and Wu) has
shown that AA substitutions start to deviate from the small-step rule when negative selection becomes
weaker and/or positive selection becomes stronger. In the same vein, this study aims to separate the two
effects on the rate of AA substitutions.

Results
I. Amino acid distance in relation to the action of negative selection
We partitioned the conventional Ka (or Dn) measurement (number of non-synonymous substitutions
per site) into 75 classes of substitutions, denoted Ki (i = 1, 75; (Tang, et al. 2004)). These 75 classes are AA
substitutions that require only a 1 bp change. Ks (or Ds), the number of synonymous substitutions per site, is
a separate class. It is reported that the rank order of Ki is highly correlated (R > 0.9) across taxa ranging
from plants and invertebrates to mammals and primates (Chen and Wu). The main reason for this nearly
universal correlation is that Ki is strongly dependent on the physicochemical properties of AAs. We hence
define evolutionary AA distance of the i-th pair by DU (i) = (U1-Ui)/(U1-U75) where Ui is the “universal
exchangeability” given in Tang et al. (2004) (Tang, et al. 2004) (see Chen et al. (Chen and Wu) for an
update). By this measure, DU(1) is 0 for the closest pair of AAs (Ser-Thr) and DU (75) is 1 for the most
distant pair (Asp-Tyr).
Fig. 1 here
To see how well DU may account for evolutionary rates, we separated genes into two groups:
the slow group consists of the top 3 gene groups in Table 1 (0% - 60%) and the fast group consists of the last
gene group (80% - 100%). Drosophila (D. melanogaster vs. D. simulans) and Hominoids (human vs.
chimpanzee) were chosen to represent the slowest and fastest evolving taxa in our collection (Fig. 1). We
found that Ki of the slow group is highly correlated with DU: the R2 is 0.904 in Drosophila and 0.706 in
Hominoids (green lines in Fig. 1A-B). The R2 values in all other taxa are also > 0.75 (Chen and Wu). Hence,
for 60% of the genes, there is a nearly universal relationship between DU (i) and Ki (Fig. 1D-E). For the
fastest evolving 20% of genes, the correlation decreases sharply. R2 among these loci is 0.798 in Drosophila
and 0.262 in Hominoids (red lines in Fig. 1A-B).
To further understand the underlying processes, we developed a model with variable negative selection,
but without positive selection (see Methods). Fig. 1C shows simulated patterns for the relaxation of negative
selection. Note that the correlation remains quite high (R2 > 0.8) as Ka/Ks exceeds 0.5. It is only when
Ka/Ks approaches 1 with negative selection becoming fully relaxed, does the correlation breaks down (blue
points of Fig. 1C). The observed pattern in Fig. 1A appears reasonably close to the simulated pattern in Fig.
1C, which shows the reduction in R when Ka/Ks increases. The pattern in Fig. 1B between human and
chimpanzee, however, is very different from the corresponding simulations in Fig. 1C. The main reason
appears to be that, in the fast group of genes, the points are often > 1 and scattered widely.
The correlations in all sampled taxa are given in Fig. 1D-F, where genes are separated into five bins by
the rank order of Ka/Ks values with equal number of non-synonymous changes. The X-axis shows mean
Ka/Ks ratios of each bin and the Y-axis is the R2 value of their Ki against DU. Simulated R2 values are
depicted by solid lines (Fig. 1D-E; see Methods). Note that the simulations assume only negative selection
in the absence of positive selection. While the simulated R2 agree reasonably well with the observed values
in Fig. 1D (in Drosophila and Arabidopsis), the agreements in other taxa in Fig. 1E-F are much worse. Fig.
1E, which presents the five comparisons between vertebrate species (a pair of reptiles, a pair of birds, and
three pairs of mammals), shows lower than expected correlations as Ka/Ks increases. Fig. 1F on the humanchimpanzee comparison shows the weakest correlations of all taxa.
Overall, the high correlation between the observed Ki and DU starts to break down when the Ka/Ks ratio
rises above 0.3 and especially above 0.5 (Fig. 1D-F). Loci with high Ka/Ks ratios are presumably less
influenced by negative selection, but also possibly undergo adaptive evolution. In the next section, we
attempt to separate the two effects in order to analyze the action of positive selection.
II. Separating positive and negative selection on AA substitutions
A commonly used approach to separating positive and negative selection is the McDonald and
Kreitman (MK) test (McDonald and Kreitman 1991). The MK test compares the Ka/Ks ratio for betweenspecies divergence with the Pa/Ps ratio for within-species polymorphism (McDonald and Kreitman 1991;

Sawyer and Hartl 1992; Fay, et al. 2002; Smith and Eyre-Walker 2002; Bustamante, et al. 2005; Shapiro, et
al. 2007). The fitness advantage of nonsynonymous substitutions, FA, is defined as

𝐹" =

$%&[()/(+]
-./0123456 [()/(+]

~

$%& ()/(+
$%& 9)/9+

Eq. (1.1)

FA is the observed nonsynonymous substitution relative to the expected, calibrated by Ks. Exp=>?@A)B [𝐾𝑎/
𝐾𝑠] can then be replaced by Obs[Pa/Ps] in Eq. (1.1) if there are few advantageous variants within species.
Thus, FA = 1 means that nonsynonymous substitutions are not driven by positive selection. When FA > 1,
we interpret FA as the selective advantage averaged across nonsynonymous substitutions. FA < 1, which is
occasionally recorded, implies weaker negative selection in the polymorphism than in the divergence data
(see Discussion).
Table 1 here
We applied the MK test to Drosophila and hominoids (see Fig. 1A and B). The results (Table 1) show
FA = 1.98 and 1.02 for the two taxa (see also Table S1, with a different frequency cutoff). When the genes
are divided into five bins according to the Ka/Ks ratio, FA increases steadily as Ka/Ks gets larger. Although
the classification by Ka/Ks can bias the calculation of FA (see Eq. 1.1), simulations show that the observed
increase is faster than the expectation accounting for bias. The trend supports, albeit only indirectly, the
suggestion that these fast-evolving genes are under positive selection, reducing the high correlation between
Ki and DU.
We then used the MK test on each individual class of AA substitutions that differ by only one bp. As
there are 75 such classes, we conducted 75 separate MK tests. For each test, Ka, Pa, and FA are replaced by
Ki, Pi, and Fi for i = 1, 75 (see Methods). The fitness advantage of the i-th type of AA substitution, Fi, is
Fi ~ Obs[Ki/Ks] / Obs[Pi/Ps]

Eq.(1.2)

In parallel, we define the intensity of negative selection on the i-th class of AA changes as
Gi = 1 – Obs[Pi/Ps].

Eq.(1.3)

Gi is the proportion of the i-th class of codon mutations eliminated by negative selection. Because low
frequency polymorphisms may contain deleterious mutations not yet eliminated (Shapiro, et al. 2007) and
the high frequency portion of the spectrum may harbor advantageous variants (Fay and Wu 2000; Wang, et
al. 2017), we followed the common practice of eliminating loci with low- and high-frequency derived alleles
(see Fig. S2 and Methods for details).
Fig. 2 and Table 2 here
With the intensity of positive and negative selection defined by Fi and Gi, we first corroborate the
expectation that negative selection tolerates small-step changes. The plots of Gi against DU in Fig. 2A-B
indeed show a strong correlation with step size (see also Fig. S1 A-B). In Drosophila, R2 = 0.89. The R2 is
lower in hominoids, but still highly significant at 0.56. The two taxa differ substantially in the strength of
negative selection as can be seen on the Y-axis: Gi ranges between 0.8 and 0.99 with a mean of 0.93 in
Drosophila but is much weaker between hominoids (as low as 0.2, with a mean of 0.68). Since the strength
of negative selection determines the correlation with DU, the smaller R2 in hominoids is not surprising.
We now address the strength of positive selection in relation to step size, DU. In Fig. 2C-D (see also Fig.
S1 C-D), the correlation can be seen as the composite of two groups of dots: Group I consists of the red dots
representing the 10 highest Fi values and Group II consists of the remaining 65 green dots. The regression
line for the 65 green dots is nearly flat for both Drosophila and hominoids. The small slopes suggest that the
strength of positive selection does not depend strongly on DU. Any of the 65 AA substitutions can have a
similar likelihood of being advantageous. Red dots, on the other hand, are much often favored by positive

selection and represent AA substitutions with large DU. The analysis suggests that positive selection does not
favor small-step changes and the strongest adaptive signals almost always come from large-distance
substitutions.
In summary, both positive and negative selection can distinguish, and act on, big-step changes better
than small-step modifications. Nevertheless, there is an important difference. While negative selection
appears to follow a nearly universal rule (Chen and Wu ; Tang, et al. 2004), such consistency across taxa is
not expected of positive selection because adaptive changes should be highly dependent on the organisms
and their environments. For that reason, the similarity between Fig. 2C and D is somewhat surprising. Table
2 (and Dataset S1, see also Table S2) shows the highest 10 pairs in the Fi ranking. Five of the top 10 pairs
are shared between the two taxa (p = 0.0027 with the overlap of 1.33 expected from the hypergeometric
distribution). It will require extensive analyses beyond Drosophila and hominoids to determine if positive
selection indeed favors the small subset of AAs given in Table 2.
III. Molecular evolution in small vs. large steps – A model
We have shown that the correlation between the observed Ki/Ks and DU (i) becomes progressively
weaker as the overall Ka/Ks gets higher (Fig. 1A-B). Obviously, the many Ki/Ks values above 1 require
incorporation of positive selection (cf. Fig. 1B and C). An expanded model that considers the opposing
dynamics of positive and negative selection is necessary. Negative selection works against large DU (i)
changes and positive selection tends to favor them. The model starts with Ka, expressed as
𝐾𝑎 =

HI
GJK 𝑤G 𝐾G

Eq. (2.1)

where wi is the weight reflecting the number of sites available for AA exchanges of the i-th pair. The
distribution of wi in the Drosophila genome is given in Fig. 3A (top panel) where i is shown as DU (i).
Fig. 3 here
We now formulate Ki (i= 1, 75) of Eq. (2.1), which is the average rate across all sites of a gene or genes.
𝑅G = 𝐾G /𝐾𝑠 = 1 − 𝑝G − 𝑞G + 𝑝G 𝑁𝜇𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠KG /𝜇 + 𝑞G 𝑁𝜇𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠VG /𝜇
= 1 + 𝑝G 𝑁𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠KG − 1 − 𝑞G 1 − 𝑁𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠VG
= 1 + 𝐴G − 𝐵G
Eq. (2.2)
where 𝑝G and 𝑞G are the proportion of advantageous and deleterious mutations, respectively (Ohta and
Gillespie 1996; Hartl and Clark 1997; Li 1997; Chen, et al. 2018). 𝜇 is the mutation rate and will be
canceled out. In the presentation, we drop the subscript i to 𝑠K and 𝑠V . We also use s for 𝑠K and 𝑠V when
they are interchangeable. Then, f (N, s) = (1-e-2s)/ (1-e-2Ns) is the fixation probability of a mutation
with a selective coefficient s, where s can be > 0 (denoted by 𝑠K ) or < 0 (𝑠V ) and N is the effective
population size. 𝐴G = 𝑝G 𝑁𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠K − 1 is the positive selection term and 𝐵G = 𝑞G 1 − 𝑁𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠V is the
negative selection term. The fixation probability of an advantageous mutation is approximately 2𝑠K (>
1/N) and that of a deleterious mutation is 𝑓 𝑁, 𝑠V = e ~ 0. Hence, 𝑅G can be simplified as
𝑅G = 𝐾G /𝐾𝑠 ~1 + 𝑝G 2𝑁𝑠K − 1 − 𝑞G = 1 + 𝐴G − 𝐵G
and
𝑅𝑎 = 𝐾𝑎/𝐾𝑠 = HI
GJK 𝑤G 𝑅G

Eq. (2.3).
Eq. (2.4).

Given 𝑝G 2𝑁𝑠K − 1 > 0, it is obvious that 𝑞G > 1- 𝑅G and 𝑝G < 𝑅G . Note that Ra = 0.3 is almost at the top of
Ra values seen across sequenced genomes (Jordan, et al. 2002; Drosophila 12 Genomes, et al. 2007; Chen,
et al. 2018) and, for Ra < 0.3, q > 0.7. This means that at least 70% of mutations are deleterious, allowing
negative selection to dominate the overall molecular evolution.

Using Eqs. (2.3-2.4), we then quantified the relationship between 𝑅G and DU(i) for any given Ra
(=Ka/Ks). In Fig. 3B-C, the Y-axis shows the strength of positive selection (𝐴G term of Eq. 2.3; red dots
above the dashed neutral line, taken from the Drosophila data in Fig. 2C) and negative selection (𝐵G
term; green dots below the dashed line [see the legend]). 𝑅G is the joint product, 1 + 𝐴G – 𝐵G , shown by
blue dots. The X-axis shows the step size of evolution (DU).
Fig. 3B with Ra = 0.3 portrays the observed limit of a fast-evolving eukaryotic genome. Although the
effects of positive and negative selection are opposite, the overall trend of 𝑅G resembles that of negative
selection (blue vs. green dots). It can thus be concluded that the signature of negative selection overwhelms
that of adaptive evolution in most eukaryotic genomes. For that reason, the conventional view of small-step
evolution (blue dots) is hardly surprising because positive selection fails to offset the impact of negative
selection. In rare cases when the strength of both selection regimes is approximately equal Ra = 1 (Fig. 3C),
the overall pattern still tilts toward small-step changes. Only in the extreme case of Ra = 2 (Fig. 3D), where
𝐴G > 𝐵G , does the overall 𝑅G begin to show a weak positive correlation with step size.
IV. Rate of adaptive evolution as a function of step size
So far we have established the efficacy of positive selection on mutations of different step sizes. The
rate of adaptive evolution, however, is the product of the mutation rate and the efficacy of positive selection.
Since estimation of this rate of adaptive evolution demands accounting for the influence of negative
selection, it is rarely attempted (see below). The available mutational inputs of all DU (i) in Drosophila are
shown in the top panel of Fig. 3A, as discussed above. Large DU changes indeed occur much less frequently
than small-step mutations, a well-known property of the code table itself. In the code table, neighboring
amino acids tend to be physico-chemically similar (Haig and Hurst 1999). The middle panel in Fig. 3A
reproduces the effect of positive selection from Fig. 2C. Combining the top and middle panels of Fig. 3A,
the rate of evolution in the bottom panel appears to tilt toward small-step changes. Clearly, mutational input
outweighs selection efficacy in determining the overall rate. A recent study (Bergman and Eyre-Walker
2018) on the rate of adaptive evolution presents a pattern that is similar to (but not identical with) the bottom
panel of Fig. 3A. In comparison, this study aims to show the effect of selection (middle panel), independent
of the mutational input (top panel).

Discussion
The conclusion that sets our study apart from the convention is that positive selection does not favor
small-step changes (Fig. 2C-D). Although we use DU(i) as a proxy for functional changes, the analysis
should have broader implications since any measure of phenotypic change can be adopted as the step size.
For example, we may consider the evolved level of gene expression as the step size when studying
mutations occurring in enhancers or promoters. In this sense, the small-step hypothesis for positive selection
is a curious concept. When the environment changes (say, woody plants invading the intertidal zone (Xu, et
al. 2017; He, Li, et al. 2018), it may require large jumps in the expression of many genes. The genome has to
respond adaptively and, importantly, small-effect mutations may not be the best solution. Similarly, if the
environmental changes demand modifications in the functionally important part of a protein, mutations have
to fall in that part even if such alternations would have a large phenotypic effect.
In short, large- vs. small- step adaption is dictated by the environment. Small-step changes can be a
good strategy for fine-tuning the phenotype, especially in an unchanging environment where the avoidance
of deleterious effects is paramount. Positive selection in a new or changing environment would operate very
differently. It has indeed been reported that in extreme environments or under artificial selection there is
often an excess of radical amino acid substitutions (Lu, et al. 2006; Luo, et al. 2017; Xu, et al. 2017).
The view of small-step evolution prevails mainly because the signature of negative selection almost
always dominates (see Fig. 3). Detection of the less-frequent positive selection would require filtering out
the effects of negative selection. To that end, we applied the MK test to the 75 classes of AA substitutions. It
should be noted that this study focuses on the relative Fi among the 75 classes. Hence, factors affecting the

absolute magnitude of Fi’s are of a lesser concern (Fay, et al. 2002; Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2008;
Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009; He, Chen, et al. 2018).
The prevalence of negative over positive selection may often have a confounding effect on the
interpretation of results (Wang, et al. 2017). For example, previous studies have compared radical (Kr, or
large-step changes) with conservative (Kc; small-step changes) AA substitutions. Kr/Kc has been shown to
be higher than the overall Ka/Ks ratios (Hughes, et al. 1990; Zhang 2000; Hanada, et al. 2007). The trend,
however, can reflect either positive selection elevating Kr or negative selection reducing Kc. In this context,
Tang et al.’s two-fold rule (Tang and Wu 2006) is another attempt at resolving this issue. They noted that
the average of the top 10 Ki classes is nearly twice the value of Ka. The accompanying study shows that the
rule is correct only when Ka/Ks < 0.5 (Chen and Wu). This rule is hence not applicable for interpreting
positive selection, which requires Ka/Ks > 1.
The concept that “nature abhors big changes” has been part of both selectionism and neutralism (Fisher
1930; Kimura 1983). This concept is only half right since it only applies to negative selection. While
negative selection follows tractable common rules, the pattern of positive selection is much more taxon- and
environment- dependent. The interpretation of positive selection will remain uncertain until negative
selection is fully and rigorously analyzed (He, Chen, et al. 2018). The latter will be an immediate challenge
for the study of molecular evolution.

Materials and Methods
The definition of ΔU
Functional distances between AA pairs are always based on the physicochemical properties, such as the
Miyata distance (Miyata, et al. 1979). However, AA distances based on some physicochemical properties
cannot account for all of the evolutionary exchangeability (EE) variance among amino acids. For example,
AA volume differences has a prominent effect on AA properties but only accounts for 27% of the EE
variance. Even the first principal component, a composite of 48 physicochemical properties, can only
account for 60% of the exchangeability variance among amino acids (Chen and Wu).
A simple way to define a distance between AA pairs is directly based on their EE difference from genome
data. These EE differences are highly conserved across a wide taxonomic range. We hence define an AA
distance based on Ui, where Ui is the “universal exchangeability” given by Tang et al. (2004) (Tang, et al.
2004). Here Ui is the evolutionary exchangeability between each AA pair based on genome data. The
evolutionary AA distance DU is defined by DU (i) =(U1-Ui)/(U1-U75), where U1 is the most exchangeable AA
pair (Ser-Thr) and U75 is the least exchangeable (Asp-Tyr). Hence DU (1) = 0 for the most similar pair (SerThr) and DU (75)=1 for the most dissimilar pair (Asp-Tyr). The DU (i) is positively correlated with the
functional distance.
The definition of negative and positive selection.
A widely-used method for detecting positive selection in coding regions is the MK test, which compares
Ka/Ks relative to Pa/Ps (McDonald and Kreitman 1991). The strength of positive selection is defined as FA=
Obs[Ka/Ks] / Obs[Pa/Ps]. FA >1 indicates the existence of positive selection. In contrast, FA <1 means there
is a relaxation of negative selection in polymorphism relative to divergence. Here, we do the MK test for
each 75 amino acid pairs by dividing non-synonymous changes into 75 parts.
Fi ~ Obs[Ki/Ks] / Obs[Pi/Ps]
Strength of negative selection for each DU is estimated from the polymorphism data. In the polymorphism,
deleterious mutations come into the population at lower allele frequency and are then removed by negative
selection. The A/S ratios of polymorphism are very high at lower allele frequencies and drop at allele
prevalence increases (see Fig. S2). This drop tapers off at a certain point. We use the frequency range that
has uniform Pa/Ps values in our analyses. Negative selection is then defined by
Gi =1-Pi/Ps.
Gi is the proportion of mutations that are eliminated by negative selection.
Multiple-alignment Data
There are eight pairs of species in Fig. 1D-E, including a pair of Arabidopsis, Drosophila, reptile, birds, and
four pairs of mammals. Details about how to deal with the genome data can be found in our accompanying
paper (Chen and Wu). The Mus-Rattus comparison was removed out as the Ui values were deduced from
the comparison between Mus-Rattus and a pair of yeasts (Tang, et al. 2004).
Polymorphism Data
Sequences of 334 Drosophila melanogaster lines were collected from the Drosophila Genome Nexus (Lack,
et al. 2015), including 137 lines from the Drosophila Population Genomics Project Phase 2 (DPGP2) (Pool,
et al. 2012) and 197 lines from DPGP3 (Lack, et al. 2015). After masking identical by descent and admixed
regions, we assembled 1,360,772 SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster. Human SNPs were downloaded from
the 1000 Genomes Project (Consortium, et al. 2015).

To estimate derived allele frequencies, adjacent species were assigned as the ancestral state. The
chimpanzee and Drosophila simulans genomes were used as the ancestor state for human and Drosophila
melanogaster. If the states were unknown in the adjacent species, the higher frequency alleles were assigned
as ancestral states. Divergence comparisons were based on D. melanogaster vs. D. similans and human vs.
chimpanzee. The divergence data of the two paired species were extracted from multiple alignment data
above. There are 9,710 orthologous genes in D. melanogaster vs. D. similans comparison and and 11,571 in
the human vs. chimpanzee comparison. Polymorphic mutations that were outside the orthologous genes
above were removed. Especially, we masked CpG related mutations in both human polymorphism and
divergence (CG => TG, CG => CA were removed).
Populations can tolerate deleterious mutations at a relatively low frequency. We removed deleterious
mutations by setting a cutoff so that the A/S ratios were stable at the higher frequencies (see Fig. S2)
(Shapiro, et al. 2007). We set two different frequency cutoff to test the influence of this choice on the results.
One group is 0.2-0.8 for Hominoids and 0.15-0.85 for Drosophila (Results in main text). The other group is
0.2-0.95 for Hominoids and 0.15-0.95 for Drosophila (Results in the Supplementary Materials). Very high
frequency mutations (0.95-1) were removed from further analyses because there were too many such
mutations, hitting at possible positive selection in this class (Fay and Wu 2000; Wang, et al. 2017).
Relaxation of negative selection models.
Fitness effects of new deleterious mutations were drawn from the exponential distribution. Most deleterious
mutations are under strong negative selection, thus the fitness is nearly 0. A small fraction of mutations are
under weak negative selection with fitness far greater than 0.
𝑓 𝑥 = 𝜆𝑒 ]^_
Here, f(x) is the frequency of mutations. The x is the fitness of new deleterious mutations. The fixation
probability of such mutations is the cumulative fitness from the least fit to current fitness, thus
𝐹(𝑥) =

𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = 1 − 𝑒 ]d.

Ka/Ks is the fixation probability of new non-neutral relative to neutral mutations. Thus F(x) = Ka/Ks in the
case where only deleterious mutations are under consideration.
𝐾𝑎/𝐾𝑠 = 1 − 𝑒 ]d.

Here, we connect the relationship between the fitness of a mutation x and the Ka/Ks ratio. As the fitness of a
new mutation is in the inverse relationship with the strength of negative selection, mutations under strong
negative selection undergo significant fitness reduction. The equation above thus links the strength of
negative selection and the Ka/Ks ratio. When mutations are under strong negative selection, x ~0 and Ka/Ks
is nearly 0. When constraint is absent, x ~ infinite and Ka/Ks is 1.
Thus we define the fitness of new deleterious mutations x and Ki/Ks for different DU(i=1:75) as follows:
𝐾𝑖/𝐾𝑠 = 1 − 𝑒 ]λg .

Eq.(3.1)

We simulated relaxation of negative selection based on Eq. (3.1) . First, we set x as a constant value and
obtained λi (i=1:75) for each DU, under the lowest total Ka/Ks ratio situation from the real data. We get the
Ki/Ks values for each DU of the slowest evolving genes accounting for 20% of all non-synonymous changes
and calculate the corresponding λi (i=1:75) from Eq. (3.1). Relaxation of negative selection was simulated
by predicting Ki/Ks changes as the total Ka/Ks ratio increased. We simply increased the fitness x and
calculated the corresponding theoretical Ki/Ks values (i= 1:75) based on Eq. (3.1). By changing the
magnitude of x, the theoretical Ki/Ks values under every possible total Ka/Ks ratio were calculated. In the

Figure 1 | Ki/Ks vs. DU and their correlations. (A-B) The relationship between DU and Ki/Ks from rapidly
and slowly evolving genes for Drosophila and homo-pan. Here, genes are first divided into five groups in
the ascending order of their Ka/Ks ratios with equal number of non-synonymous changes in each group.
Rapidly evolving genes account for the top 20% of non-synonymous changes (red points). Slowly evolving
genes account for bottom 0%-60% (green points). The Ka/Ks rate ratios in the legend are the average Ka/Ks
ratio for each gene group. (C) The theoretical changes of Ki/Ks and DU under a model with negative
selection only. As the Ka/Ks ratio increases, some AA pairs ascend to their upper limit, with Ki/Ks values
nearly 1(blue points). (D-F) The theoretical (solid lines) and observed changes (box-shape points) of total
Ka/Ks ratio and R2 values of their Ki against DU. Genes were again divided into five groups as above. The
theoretical changes are based on a model with varying levels of negative selection only.

Figure 2 | The relationship between evolutionary AA distance (DU) and selection intensity. (A-B) The
intensity of negative selection in Drosophila and Hominoids. (C-D) positive selection intensity in
Drosophila and Hominoids. The highest 10 Fi values are labeled by red, and the rests are green. The allele
frequency cutoffs are 0.15-0.85 for Drosophila and 0.2-0.8 for Hominoids. In the supplementary Figure S1,
different cutoffs are applied.

Figure 3 | A model of selection intensity in relation to functional differences (DU). (A) A model with
positive selection. The relative frequencies of available number of sites for each DU (wi) are given in the top
panel. The strength of positive selection (Ai) relative to DU is based on Drosophila data in Figure 2 (middle
panel), but the adaptive evolutionary rate (the bottom panel) still depends on small-step changes due to the
difference of available number of sites (wi) among AAs (top panel). The blue lines are the linear regression
lines. (B-D) A model of positive selection, negative selection, and their confounding effect. There are three
Ka/Ks ratios, where Ka/Ks= 0.3 (Panel B), Ka/Ks =1 (Panel C), and Ka/Ks =2 (Panel D). The dashed line
denotes complete neutrality, with Ka/Ks=1. Above the dashed neutral line is the strength of positive
selection (Ai) (red points) and below the line is negative selection (Bi, green points). The strength of
negative selection (Bi) changes linearly with functional difference (DU). The strength of positive selection
(Ai) shown in Panel A is also shared between Panel B-C, but the relative strength is increased in Panel D to
achieve a higher Ka/Ks ratio. The changes of Ki/Ks relative to DU are the result of a confounding effect
between negative and positive selection (Ri = 1 + Ai - Bi)(blue points).
