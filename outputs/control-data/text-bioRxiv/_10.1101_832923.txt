Abstract
Metalloporphyrins play important roles in areas ranging from biology to nanoscience.
Biology uses a narrow set of metal centres comprising mainly of iron and
magnesium. Here, we convert metalloporphyrin specificity of cytochrome b562 from
iron (haem) to fluorogenic zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP). Through a computationally
guided iterative design process, a variant with a near total preference for ZnPP was
generated representing a switch in specificity. The new variant greatly enhanced
(≥60 fold) the negligible aqueous fluorescence of free ZnPP in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
Here, we describe how an iterative design process can change the metalloporphyrin
specificity of cytochrome b562 (cyt b562), a b-type haem binding protein unit, from iron
to fluorogenic and photochemically active zinc. Metalloporphyrins 1 represent an
important class of organometallic compounds and play a major role in biology as
essential supplements to enable protein function in processes ranging from light
harvesting to electron transport to enzyme catalysis to O2 transport 2. Binding to a
protein tunes and modulates the metalloporphyrin physiochemical properties. The
metal centres used in biology are Fe (e.g. haem), Mg (e.g. chlorophyll) and, to a
much lesser extent Co (Vitamin B12) and Ni (F430). This does not however represent
the full metal repertoire available to porphyrins (e.g. Cu, Pt, Ag, Cd, Ir, Zn) 1. There is
currently great interest in incorporating new metal cofactors into proteins. Such
abiotic cofactors have recently been shown to confer new enzymatic catalytic routes
3-4

. Zinc porphyrins such as zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP, Figure 1a) are one such

class, playing important roles in clinical (including cancer therapy) and nanoscience
settings. While ZnPP is not naturally utilised in biology as a protein cofactor, its
aberrant presence in blood is commonly used to diagnose haem metabolism
disorders 5. The photo-induced electron and energy transfer properties of zinc
porphyrins make them particularly attractive for nanoscale applications, ranging from
photosensitizers in solar cells to molecular optoelectronic components 6-9. ZnPP is
inherently fluorescent but substantially quenched in aqueous solution 10-11. Designer
protein components have the potential to further enhance ZnPP use through: (i)
activation of fluorogenic properties 12 in aqueous conditions as an aid to clinical
sensing and cell imaging; (ii) providing an organised, defined and tunable selfassembling scaffold for nanodevice construction 6, 13-17.
ZnPP incorporation within a protein scaffold has classically been achieved by either:
(i) metal centre exchange (in the case of covalently attached porphyrins) that require
harsh conditions unsuitable for most biological settings 13, 18-19; (ii) facile exchange in
the case of non-covalent porphyrin-protein complexes 11, 20. With regards to the
latter, affinity for ZnPP is inherently low (Table S1), with preference for the original
haem cofactor; little attention is paid to optimising the protein interaction despite the
structural and physicochemical variations on exchanging the porphyrin metal centre
(Fig 1a). Here we show how computational design can be used to switch cyt b562

Results and discussion
Cyt b562 (Figure S1) is a small, helical bundle protein that binds haem non-covalently
22-24

. It is an important model for electron transfer 25-28, engineering novel

components 29-34 and assembling supramolecular structures 6, 14, 35. ZnPP can
replace haem through passive exchange 20, 33, 36 but the environment is non-ideal
resulting in relatively low affinity binding (404 nM ±11 KD; Table S1) and a significant
background haem binding in vivo (Figure 1). Factors include non-optimal metal
coordination ligands and change in tetrapyrole structure and planarity due to the
larger ionic radius of Zn2+(Fig 1a) 37-38.
The first stage in the design process was to optimise Zn coordination. Zn
coordination is normally through soft ligands such as the cysteine thiol group and the
imidazole group of histidine, or base ligands from the carboxylate groups of
aspartate and glutamate; the native M7 S-methyl thioether group is not an ideal axial
ligand. This was confirmed through computational analysis with cysteine considered

the best, albeit still relatively poor, alternative (the M7C mutation). The second native
axial ligand, the imidazole group of H102, was considered optimal so was not
changed. The M7C variant was generated and the measured ZnPP and haem
affinity (dissociation constant, KD) were comparable (181 ±11 nM for ZnPP and 206
±2 nM for haem; Table S1) so generating a starting mutant with slightly improved
ZnPP binding and lower haem affinity. Replacement of Met7 with either His (a
second potential coordinating ligand) or Gly lowered ZnPP binding affinity to that of
wild-type cyt b562 with the bis-His mutant retaining specificity for haem (Table S2).
The absorbance spectrum of cyt b562M7C (Fig S4) confirms ZnPP binding to the
protein as indicated by the red shift in the Soret peak at 418nm for free ZnPP to a
sharper peak at 431nm. The Soret and α/β band peaks of cyt b562M7C are slightly blue
shifted (8-10 nm) compared to the ZnPP bound to wild-type cyt b562. The Soret peak
is also broader for wt cyt b562 suggesting a mixed binding population compared to cyt
b562M7C. The ZnPP α/β peaks ratio also switches on cyt b562 binding.
To further optimise ZnPP binding, a more systematic in silico mutagenesis approach
was adopted. Using the wt holo cyt b562 crystal structure 39 as a starting point, every
residue from 1 to 20 was replaced to every possible residue and energy minimised to
avoid clashes. The structures derived from the energy minimisation were used as the
starting point for docking simulations using AutoDock 40 and Rosetta LigandDock 41.
As a test for the accuracy, the in silico derived binding energy of the wt cyt was
compared with the measured KD. The measured binding energy for wt cyt b562
(where ∆G=RT lnKD) is -8.7 kcalmol-1 for ZnPP, and -11 kcalmol-1 and for haem.
These are close to the binding energies predicted from our modelling approach
(Table S1). The in silico design process identified a variant with improved ZnPP
binding energies termed cyt b562ZnPP. In addition to the M7C mutation, four other
mutations were identified (L3K, E4D, T9C, L10R). The affinity of variant for ZnPP
was much lower (<10 nM) compared to wt cyt b562 (Table S1 and Figure S3) with
minimal haem binding observed both in vivo (Figure 1d) and in vitro (Figure S3a).
This represents a near total switch in specificity from haem to ZnPP. The lowest
scoring models were chosen for verification with Rosetta LigandDock, followed by
molecular dynamics for 2 ns to ensure that the shape of the binding pocket was
accurate. There was no significant change in the shape of the binding pocket when
comparing before and after the molecular dynamics run. Residue 10 lies arose in the

later stages of the design and buried in the holo form of the protein (Fig 1c) so it was
surprising that not only was the L10R mutation tolerated but improved binding.
Mutating residue 10 to either alanine or serine reduced affinity to >100 nM. Analysis
of the model suggests that the guanidinium group of R10 lies within 2-3 Å of the C7
thiol group (Fig 1c and S4); proton abstraction by R10 may generate a thiolate
group, which is a better ligand for Zn binding than the C7 thiol. Cyt b562ZnPP was
analysed in more detail.
Cyt b562ZnPP had a characteristic absorbance spectrum indicative of formation of
ZnPP holo protein (Fig 2a), with an extinction coefficient of 158 mM cm-1 at 424 nm,
5 nm blue shifted compared to wt cyt b562. On binding cyt b562ZnPP, ZnPP
fluorescence intensity increased >60 fold (Fig 2b). Excitation at 431 nm gave the
expected dual peak emission characteristic of ZnPP 19 (λEM 590 and 640 nm) with a
Stoke’s shift of 160 nm and 210 nm (Fig 2b). The peak ratio of the two emission
peaks was circa 2:1 (590:640 nm). Protein-bound ZnPP could be excited at 431 nm,
550nm and 590 nm (Fig S5). While the brightest emission originated from excitation
at 431 nm the ability to excite at multiple and longer wavelengths has obvious
benefits for biological imaging. These fluorescence characteristics were observed for
wt cyt b562 and cyt b562M7C (Fig S6) suggesting that the mutations affected only
binding affinity. The quantum yield for the combined emission peaks was measured
to be ~92% generating a protein with a brightness of 146 mM-1cm-1, higher than
many autofluorescent proteins 42-44. ZnPP fluorescence is quenched in aqueous
solutions to the extent that the quantum yield could not be accurately measured

incubated with ZnPP with cells containing (black line) or without (red line) plasmid-based cyt
b562ZnPP. Inset is the fluorescence emission spectra after 1 hr.

Coupled with the fluorogenic properties, cyt b562ZnPP could make a useful genetically
encoded imaging agent. A prerequisite for cell imaging is that ZnPP should pass
through membranes and have no significant fluorescence in the cell until it binds
specifically to cyt b562ZnPP. E. coli cells expressing cyt b562ZnPP were colourless in
comparison to those expressing wt cyt b562 (Figure 1d), which are a pink-red hue due
to binding available haem with high affinity 31. This confirms cyt b562ZnPP reduced
affinity for haem and thus a decreased capacity to bind endogenous haem compared
to the wt cyt b562. On addition of ZnPP to E. coli cells expressing cyt b562ZnPP50,
fluorescence increased over time until plateauing after ~40-50 min (Fig 2c). Cells
with no plasmid-encoded cyt b562 exhibited low baseline fluorescence on addition of
ZnPP, which remained steady over the course of the incubation.

Red edge excitation shift (REES) analysis was performed to ascertain the effect of
ZnPP binding to cyt b562ZnPP (Fig 3a). REES is an optical phenomenon where
decreasing the excitation energy (increasing the excitation wavelength, 𝜆EX) gives
rise to a red shift in the maximum of the fluorescence emission (𝜆EM). Such shifts can
arise where the fluorophore exists in a range of discrete solvation environments that
are sampled as part of an equilibrium of solvent-solute interaction energies 45. In
some cases, decreasing the energy of excitation allows for photo-selection of the
discrete states that are red shifted (lower energy). We have recently demonstrated
that for a single fluorophore (tryptophan) containing protein, the REES effect can

inform on the equilibrium of conformational states accessible to the fluorophore 46.
The REES data for free and protein-bound ZnPP are shown in Figure 3a and have
been extracted for the α/β emission maximum shown in Figure 2b, 𝜆EM-1 and 𝜆EM-2,
respectively. Free ZnPP exhibits a significant REES effect that is reduced on binding
to cyt b562ZnPP; the change in 𝜆EM-1 and 𝜆EM-2 respectively being 0.56 ± 0.02 nm-1 and
0.21 ± 0.02 nm-1 for free ZnPP, which reduces to 0.12 ± 0.01 nm-1 and -0.04 ± 0.03
nm-1 on binding cyt b562ZnPP50. These data therefore suggest that the free ZnPP exists
in an equilibrium of discrete solvation states and that this equilibrium collapses to
essentially a single state on binding to the protein. These data therefore suggest
tight ZnPP binding within the core of the protein, with limited solvent access, akin to
haem binding. To further confirm ZnPP binding to cyt b562ZnPP, CD spectroscopy was
used to monitor the expected transition from a partially folded helical structure to a
folded 4-helix bundle on co-factor binding. On addition of ZnPP to cyt b562ZnPP, the
deepening of troughs at ~208 nm and 222 nm was observed confirming the increase
in helical character, with the spectra of holo-cyt b562ZnPP50 similar to that observed for
wt holo-cyt b562 (Fig 3b).
Using systematic computationally guided engineering, the metalloporphyrin
specificity of cyt b562 can be switched to ZnPP; the affinity is on a par with the natural
haem cofactor and represented a near total switch in specificity. A fluorogenic effect
was observed generating a protein complex with high brightness that exceeds that of
many autofluorescent proteins. Higher affinity and thus more stable binding make
holo-cyt b562ZnPP50 a more useful photo-electronic nanodevice 15, 33; a protein scaffold
can also tune facets such as electronic excitation and emission. More generally, it
provides a route for improving affinity of various different haemoproteins for ZnPP
and other metalloporphyrins, in which the haem can be replaced by the
photosensitizer effect of ZnPP 13, 47 or the catalytic properties of Ir and Cu porphyrins
3-4

. The design process has shown changing metal coordinating ligands is not the

defining step but that optimising residues adjacent to the metal coordination site is
critical to success.

In silico design.
ZincExplorer
In silico protein design was performed by initially using the native wild-type cyt b562
sequence with the ZincExplorer web server
48
(http://protein.cau.edu.cn/ZincExplorer). Successive mutations were assessed by
selecting existing residues, replacing them and resubmitting them to the server. The
relative scores returned from the server were used to determine if a mutation was
likely to improve Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) binding (see Figure S1). The first
design phase focused on replacing the M7 co-ordinating residue with alternatives to
identify a better potential axial ligand residue. The second design round built on the
best scoring variant from the first round introduced secondary mutations around
residue 7.
Mutant Modelling
Using the published crystal structure of wild type cyt b562 (PDB:256B 24) as a
starting point, in silico mutagenesis was performed using the mutagenesis
application within MacPyMol 49 to change a single residue to another. This process
was automated using shell scripts to allow for the creation of a library of structure
files that replaced residue 1-20 with every other possible residue. Each initial model
was used as the starting point and energy minimised to avoid any clashes caused by
the mutation introduction. The starting structure was then placed within a triclinic box
with dimension of 6.4x6.1x7.8 nm. This was populated using the Simple Point
Charge (SPC) water model 50 to solvate the system to a total number of 16986
solvent molecules. The system was first energy minimised by performing 500 steps
of steepest descent method followed by 500 steps of conjugant gradient method.
The lowest energy state of the system was used as the starting conformation for the
docking simulations.
Ligand Docking with AutoDock
Structure files for ZnPP were made using Avogadro 51. Geometry optimization
calculations were performed using GAMESS-US 21 at the HF/6-31G* level in order to
be consistent with the AMBER99sb force field 52. The optimised structure was used
as the ligand file during docking simulations. The standard AutoDock4 40 protocol
was used as described in the software documentation. The scripts
prepare_receptor4, prepare_ligand4, prepare_gpf4, prepare_dpf42 and
prepare_flexreceptor4 (distributed with the software) were used to prepare the
energy minimised mutated structure files for docking. For each variant 50 models

were made and the lowest 5% of the predicted free binding energies were taken and
averaged to give an approximate score for each mutation, these were then ranked
and the lowest scoring mutant was chosen as the starting point for another round of
mutations.
Ligand Docking with Rosetta LigandDock
The five lowest scoring variants from the AutoDock docking simulations for each
round were chosen to be confirmed using the Rosetta LigandDock program 41.
Docking was carried out using the Automatic RosettaLigand Setup script supplied
with the program. The predicted binding energies and Rosetta score were compared
with the results from the AutoDock docking analysis to inform the choice of which
mutation would be used as the starting point of the next round of mutations.
Cyt b562 mutagenesis and protein production.
Construction of cyt b562ZnPP variants described in this paper was performed using
site directed mutagenesis, essentially as outlined previously 30. Cyt b562 and its
variants were expressed and purified as outlined previously 30.
When required, purified cyt b562 was converted to apo-form before ZnPP
replacement by using organic solvent extraction approach 31. The proteins were
buffer exchanged into water and the pH lowered to 1.5 before mixing with ice-cold 2butanone. The mixture was then centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13,000x rpm in a bench
top microfuge. The organic phase was removed and the preceding steps were
repeated 5 times. The pH was returned to pH 6 before buffer exchanging back into
10mM Tris buffer.
ZnPP and hemin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The molecules were
dissolved in 1 M NaOH prior to use to a final ZnPP concentration of 1 mM. ZnPP
was stored in the dark at 4 C and centrifuged prior to use in experiments to prevent
molecular aggregation and photodegradation. The ZnPP solution was then added to
10 mM Tris buffer to a final concentration of 200 µM. This was then added to a
solution of 100 µM apo- cyt b562 in 10 mM Tris buffer and incubated for 12 hours at
25°C to form holo cyt b562 ZnPP.
Biophysical analysis of cyt b562 variants
UV-Vis Spectrophotometry and porphyrin titration
The absorbance spectra were monitored using Cary UV-Vis Spectrophotometer.
The porphyrin titration experiments were performed using 20 μM apo-cyt b562 in 1ml
of 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.2 with either 10 μM ferricyanide (for oxidised
spectra) or 10 μM ascorbic acid (for reduced spectra). Either hemin (20 µM stock) or
ZnPP (20 µM stock) were titrated against the protein solution. Apo-cyt b562
concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (molar
absorbance coefficient 2.98 mM-1 cm-1) and the holo-cyt b562 concentration was
determined by monitoring 430 nm for ZnPP titration and 418 nm for oxidised hemin
or 428 nm for reduced hemin. The resultant titration curves were then fitted to
determine dissociation constant (see Figure S3 for examples), as described
previously 20.
Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Excitation and emission spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse
spectrophotometer and the corresponding Cary Eclipse software. Samples of 750 μL
comprising of 2.5-10 μΜ protein/porphyrin were analysed in a 5 × 5 mm QS quartz
cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany). Spectra were recorded at a scan rate of either

120 or 600 nm/min with a slit width of 5 nm. Emission spectra were recorded up to
700 nm from a fixed excitation wavelength (corresponding to lMAX from the
absorbance spectrum [~430 nm and ~590 nm] with an associated emission peak) for
each variant. Quantum Yield studies were carried out using Alexa Fluor 431,
essentially as described previously 53-54. For the in vivo analysis, liquid cell cultures
were grown at 37℃ to an A600 of 0.6. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation in a
microfuge for 20 min at 4°C. ZnPP (20 μM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was used to
resuspended the cell pellet. A cell culture without the plasmid encoding the cyt b562
variants was used as a control. Fluorescence readings were taken periodically to
determine rate of ZnPP uptake and incorporation.
Red edge excitation spectra (REES) analysis
All fluorescence measurements were performed using a Varian Cary Eclipse
fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) with a 5×5mm QS quartz
cuvette (Hellma UK). The fluorimeter was baselined with 10mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH6.2) and all measurements were taken at 20°C. Excitation and emission
slit widths were 5 nm and a scan rate of 600 or 120nm/min was used. Samples were
incubated for 30 minutes at the given conditions prior to recording measurements.
The red edge excitation scans were monitored from 413 to 437 nm with increments
of 2 nm in the excitation wavelength. The wavelength of maximum emission, was
extracted from the emission spectra by fitting to a sum (two) of skewed Gaussians of
the form:
Eq 1
Where FI is the measured fluorescence intensity at an emission wavelength, λEM.
The spectra are then characterised by the amplitude, A of the spectrum at the
maximum of fluorescence intensity, λEMmax, spectral width at half maximal, w and the
minimum of the fluorescence emission, FI0, which was ~ zero for the buffer
subtracted spectra.
CD spectroscopy
Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco J-710 as described
previously 20.
