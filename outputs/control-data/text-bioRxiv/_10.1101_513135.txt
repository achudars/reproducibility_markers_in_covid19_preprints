Abstract

2
3

Mitophagy is an important quality control mechanism in eukaryotic cells, and defects in

4

mitophagy correlate with aging phenomena and neurodegenerative disorders. It is known that

5

different mitochondrial matrix proteins undergo mitophagy with very different rates, but to date the

6

mechanism underlying this selectivity at the individual protein level has remained obscure. We now

7

present evidence indicating that protein phosphorylation within the mitochondrial matrix plays a

8

mechanistic role in regulating selective mitophagic degradation in yeast, via involvement of the Aup1

9

mitochondrial protein phosphatase, as well as two known matrix-localized protein kinases, Pkp1 and

10

Pkp2. By focusing on a specific matrix phosphoprotein reporter, we also demonstrate that phospho-

11

mimetic and non-phosphorylatable point mutations at known phosphosites in the reporter increased

12

or decreased its tendency to undergo mitophagy. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of the

13

reporter protein is dynamically regulated during mitophagy, in an Aup1-dependent manner. Our

14

results indicate that structural determinants on a mitochondrial matrix protein can govern its

15

mitophagic fate, and that protein phosphorylation regulates these determinants.

Significance statement

2
3

Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies many age-related human pathologies. In normal cells, defective

4

mitochondria are often degraded by mitophagy, a process in which these mitochondria are engulfed

5

in autophagosomes and sent for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole. Surprisingly, studies on

6

mitophagy in diverse eukaryotic organisms reveal an unexpected dimension of protein-level

7

selectivity, wherein individual protein species exhibit divergent rates of mitophagic degradation. In

8

this manuscript, we show that this surprising intra-mitochondrial selectivity can be generated by

9

differential phosphorylation of individual mitochondrial protein species, and we identify

10

mitochondrial phosphatases and kinases which contribute to this regulation. By identifying a

11

mechanism which regulates the intra-mitochondrial selectivity of mitophagic degradation, our

12

findings open the door to potential manipulation of the quality control process in the future.

Introduction

2

Mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, is considered an important quality control

3

mechanism in eukaryotic cells (1–3). Defects in mitophagic clearance of malfunctioning

4

mitochondria have been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as

5

Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (4–8) and may be associated with additional

6

aging-related pathologies (9). As with other forms of selective autophagy, mitophagy is induced by

7

the activation of a receptor protein, or by its recruitment to the organellar surface. The receptor

8

interacts with the autophagic machinery to mediate the engulfment of specific mitochondria which

9

are designated for degradation (10, 11). In many mammalian cell types, loss of mitochondrial

10

membrane potential stabilizes the PINK1 protein kinase on the outer mitochondrial membrane (12).

11

This leads to the PINK1-dependent recruitment and phosphorylation of Parkin, a ubiquitin E3 ligase

12

(13–15), as well as to the local production of phospho-ubiquitin (16–19). Phospho-ubiquitylation of

13

mitochondrial outer membrane proteins recruits the soluble mitophagy receptors NDP52 and

14

optineurin, which link the defective mitochondrial compartment with the autophagic machinery and

15

mediate its degradation (20). Mitophagy has also been implicated in specific developmental

16

transitions in mammals, such as muscle, neuron, and erythrocyte differentiation (21–25). In yeast

17

cells, the Atg32 mitophagy receptor is a type 2 mitochondrial outer membrane protein which is found

18

on all mitochondria (26, 27), but undergoes post-translational modifications which activate it,

19

presumably on specific mitochondria which are thus marked for degradation (28–30).

20

An important question is whether the representation of matrix proteins in mitochondria

21

destined for degradation is identical to the average representation in the general mitochondrial

22

network. We previously determined that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, different mitochondrial matrix

23

protein reporters undergo mitophagy at drastically different rates, indicating the existence of a pre-

24

engulfment sorting mechanism (31). We were also able to show that altering mitochondrial

25

dynamics, through deletion of the DNM1 gene, affected the selectivity that is observed, even though

26

mitochondrial dynamics is not absolutely essential for mitophagy per se, as also confirmed by others

27

(32). These results led us to speculate that mitochondrial dynamics, through repeated mitochondrial

28

fission and fusion cycles, can distill defective components from the network, while sparing other

29

molecular species (31, 33). However, while fission and fusion can ‘shake up’ the network by mixing

30

components, a distillation process would also require some kind of physical segregation principle. A

31

hint into the nature of the putative segregation principle could be related to the function of the

32

mitochondrial phosphatase Aup1 (also known as Ptc6). Aup1 was originally identified by virtue of a

1

synthetic genetic interaction with the Atg1 protein kinase (34). Loss of this gene leads to defects in

2

mitophagy when assayed by some methods, but not by other methods (34, 35). The finding that

3

mitophagy could be protein-specific at the intra-mitochondrial level suggests the possibility that

4

Aup1 could be involved in generating and maintaining mitophagic selectivity, as this would explain

5

the different experimental outcomes obtained using different reporters and conditions. In the present

6

work, we demonstrate that perturbations of mitochondrial protein phosphorylation caused by

7

mutating AUP1 and additional genes encoding mitochondrial kinases, affect the selectivity of

8

mitophagy. We also show that point mutations at specific phosphosites in a known mitochondrial

9

matrix phosphoprotein, Mdh1, affect the mitophagic efficiency of the protein, and that mitophagic

10

efficiency of Mdh1-GFP is determined downstream of Aup1 function. Thus, our data indicate that

11

targeting of individual protein molecules for mitophagy depends on specific structural determinants

12

and can be further regulated by protein phosphorylation.

Results

2
3

A role for mitochondrial phosphatases and kinases in regulating the intra-mitochondrial

4

selectivity of stationary phase mitophagy

5

Aup1, a conserved PP2C- type mitochondrial phosphatase, was previously shown to be

6

required for efficient stationary phase mitophagy, using a simplistic assay which follows the levels of

7

Aco1 (one of two mitochondrial aconitase isoforms in yeast) over the time course of stationary phase

8

mitophagy (34). To test the involvement of Aup1 in mitophagy using more up-to-date methods, we

9

followed the effects of deleting AUP1 in yeast expressing a chimeric Mdh1-GFP fusion protein. As

10

previously shown for other reporter proteins, delivery of the GFP chimera to the vacuole results in

11

degradation of the native Mdh1 moiety while the residual GFP portion is resistant to vacuolar

12

proteases, generating the appearance of free GFP in immunoblots (36). This can then be used as a

13

semi-quantitative readout of the efficiency of mitophagy (Figure 1). We find that Aup1 is required

14

for mitophagic degradation of Mdh1-GFP, and that this phenotype is complemented by expression of

15

the AUP1 gene from a plasmid (Figure 1A). Complementation depends on the 34 amino terminal

16

amino acid residues of the protein, which are predicted to contain the mitochondrial targeting

17

sequence. Deletion of the ATG32 gene completely abrogates the appearance of free GFP (Figure 1B),

18

validating that the free GFP appears specifically as a result of mitophagic trafficking, and not due to

19

another autophagic pathway or other degradation mechanisms (this control was repeated for all

20

mitochondrial GFP fusion proteins used in this study, with identical results; see SI appendix Figure

21

S1).

22

The defect in mitophagic trafficking of Mdh1 in aup1cells can be overcome by

23

overexpressing Mdh1-GFP from a plasmid (Figure 1C-D, and see also SI appendix Figure S12 for a

24

comparison of reporter protein levels in endogenously expressing vs Mdh1-GFP overexpressing

25

strains), suggesting the existence of a saturable selectivity mechanism. This saturation is not a

26

specific property of Mdh1, as the same observation was made when using an Idp1-GFP fusion

27

protein as a reporter (Figure 1E-F). In addition, we tested the effects of deleting Aup1 on the

28

mitophagic trafficking of Aco1, Aco2, and Qcr2, which also localize to the mitochondrial matrix. We

29

find that while Aco1, Mdh1 and Idp1 are affected by knocking out AUP1, Aco2 and Qcr2 are less

30

significantly impacted by this mutation (Figure 1G). Yeast mitochondria are known to contain at least

31

two kinases (Pkp1 and Pkp2) and at least two phosphatases (Ptc5 and Aup1). To determine whether

32

the role of Aup1 reflects a broader involvement of protein phosphorylation in determining selectivity,

we tested the same 5 reporter proteins for their ability to undergo mitophagy in wild-type, aup1Δ,

2

ptc5Δ, pkp1Δ, and pkp2Δ cells (Figure 1G). As previously shown, WT cells exhibit different

3

efficiencies of generation of free GFP for different mitochondrial reporters, under mitophagy-

4

inducing conditions. We then compared the mitophagic selectivity of the different genotypes by

5

calculating pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients, followed by a clustering analysis of the

6

respective data vectors representing each genotype (Figure 1H). We find that, while Ptc5 does not

7

play an appreciable role in regulating mitophagic selectivity (at least with respect to the reporters

8

assayed here), the deletion of either PKP1 or PKP2 led to selectivity profiles that were similar to

9

those observed for the deletion of AUP1 (Figure 1G). This result is consistent with mitochondrial

10

protein phosphorylation playing a general role in determining the intra-mitochondrial selectivity of

11

mitophagic trafficking, not restricted to Aup1. In fact, the double deletion mutant pkp1Δ pkp2Δ

12

effectively shuts down mitophagy for most of the endogenous reporters we have tested here (Figure

13

1G), except for Aco1-GFP, which is inhibited by about 40% in this genetic background. Consistent

14

with this observation, the double mutant exhibited enhanced loss of viability in long incubations on

15

lactate-based medium relative to wild-type (SI appendix Figure S13), reminiscent of data previously

16

published for aup1 cells (34). In addition, we could show that all of the genotypes tested here

17

showed normal mitophagic trafficking of a totally artificial chimeric mitophagy reporter (mtDHFR-

18

GFP, utilizing mouse DHFR) implying that matrix protein phosphorylation affects the selectivity of

19

mitophagy, as opposed to the process itself, and that the effects of the kinase and phosphatase

20

deletions do not arise from indirect physiological effects which prevent mitophagy or autophagy in

21

general (Figure 1I).

22
23

Mdh1, a mitochondrial matrix protein, is phosphorylated on serine 196, threonine 199 and

24

serine 240 during growth on lactate under mitophagy-inducing conditions

25

Many mitochondrial matrix proteins are known to undergo phosphorylation (37), although the

26

precise role of these modifications is generally unclear. The apparent involvement of mitochondrial

27

kinases and phosphatases in regulating mitophagic specificity suggests that, at least in some cases,

28

protein phosphorylation affects mitophagic fate. We therefore tested whether Mdh1-GFP, a reporter

29

which shows a high sensitivity to deletion of Aup1, is indeed phosphorylated under our working

30

conditions. Mdh1 contains 5 known phosphosites, at positions 59, 177, 196, 199, and 240 (37–39).

31

As shown in Figure 2, we found by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of denatured protein extracts

32

that S196, T199 and S240 in Mdh1 are phosphorylated, under these conditions.

Structural determinants on Mdh1 regulate mitophagic efficiency ‘in cis’

3

If Mdh1 phosphorylation plays a role in determining mitophagic selectivity, we should expect

4

that mutagenesis of phosphosites on the protein would affect its rate of mitophagy. We carried out

5

site-directed mutagenesis of the sites identified by us (Figure 2), as well as additional reported Mdh1

6

phosphosites, to the respective alanine and aspartate variants. As shown in SI appendix Figure S11,

7

mutation at these sites did not affect complementation of the growth defect of mdh1 cells on lactate

8

medium. We find that the T59A, S196A and T199A mutants were unable to undergo mitophagy,

9

while the S240A variant reproducibly showed increased mitophagic efficiency relative to wild-type

10

(Figure 3A). The inability of the T59A, S196A and T199A mutants to undergo mitophagy does not

11

reflect a general block of mitophagy in these cells: a co-expressed mtRFP showed clear induction of

12

mitophagy, as judged by the appearance of red fluorescence in the vacuole, while the T59A and

13

T199A variants maintained a mostly mitochondrial localization (Figure 3B). As an independent

14

verification, we also tested the effect of expressing the T199A variant on the mitophagic trafficking

15

of a co-expressed Qcr2-RFP construct (SI appendix Figure S10): while the T199A mutant is reaching

16

the vacuole less efficiently relative to WT, its expression does not significantly affect mitophagy of

17

the Qcr2-RFP construct in the same cell. The fact that T199A is defective in reaching the vacuole

18

(Figure 3B) makes it unlikely that the point mutants are delivered to the vacuole, but for some reason

19

are recalcitrant to degradation by vacuolar proteases. To further rule out the possibility that

20

differences in sensitivity to vacuolar proteases underlie the difference in release of free GFP from

21

Mdh1-GFP between WT and the T199A mutant, we deleted the mitochondrial targeting sequence in

22

these constructs. The resultant Mdh1-GFP molecules are cytoplasmic, and can be directly targeted to

23

the

24

mitochondria (40). If the difference observed between WT Mdh1-GFP and the T199A mutant is due

25

to differential sensitivity to vacuolar proteases, then we expect it to persist in constructs lacking the

26

MTS under general macroautophagy-inducing conditions, as the path taken en route to the vacuole

27

should not affect the sensitivity to proteolysis within the vacuole. However, in the experiment shown

28

in Figure 3C, we can see that both MTSΔ constructs generate very similar amounts of free GFP upon

29

nitrogen starvation, in stark contrast with the respective mitochondrially-targeted constructs. The free

30

GFP which is formed from the MTS constructs is indeed due to direct macroautophagic transport

31

from the cytosol to the vacuole, as it is independent of Atg32, but totally dependent on Atg1. Finally,

32

the point mutations used in Figure 3A had no effect on cell growth (SI appendix Figure S11),

indicating that these proteins are enzymatically active. Thus, we can conclude that discrete changes

2

to a protein’s structure can have a clear effect on its mitophagic targeting without affecting

3

mitophagic targeting of other mitochondrial proteins.

4

Consistent with these findings, some of the corresponding aspartate mutations showed a

5

reciprocal effect. Thus, mitophagic targeting of the S240D mutant is strongly attenuated relative to

6

the wild type, and the mitophagic targeting of the T199D mutant is increased, relative to wild-type

7

(see Figure 3D).

10

Time and Aup1-dependent changes in the phosphorylation state of Mdh1-GFP occur during
mitophagy

11

To further understand the role of matrix phosphorylation in mitophagic selectivity, we

12

analyzed time- and genotype- dependent changes in the phosphorylation state of Mdh1-GFP during

13

mitophagy. Native immunoprecipitation of Mdh1-GFP from cell extracts, followed by

14

immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibody (anti pSer/pThr) identifies a -

15

phosphatase sensitive signal which increases in WT cells over the incubation period, but decreases

16

over time in the isogenic aup1 strain, and is undetectable by day 2-3 of the incubation, when

17

mitophagy is normally induced (Figure 4A). We also managed to quantify peptides containing

18

phospho-Ser196 and phospho-Thr199 by SILAC-based MS analysis, comparing WT to aup1Δ cells.

19

At day 2, phosphoSer196 appears to be stable, whereas phosphoThr199 is significantly less abundant

20

in aup1Δ cells relative to AUP1 expressing cells (Figure 4B). Thus, we conclude that the reduced

21

phosphorylation of Thr199 contributes to the decrease of phosphoSer/Thr signal observed by western

22

blot analysis of anti-GFP immunoprecipitates in aup1Δ cells.

23
24

Expression of a hyper-mitophagy variant of Mdh1-GFP can suppress mitophagy defects in

25

aup1Δ and pkp2Δ cells.

26

If phosphorylation of Mdh1 at T199 is important for mitophagic trafficking of the protein, and

27

if Aup1 directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation state at this residue, then we expect the

28

T199D mutant to be able, at least partially, to bypass the phenotype of the aup1Δ or pkp2Δ mutations.

29

As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, the T199D mutation shows reproducible suppression of both the

30

aup1Δ and pkp2Δ mutants. However, neither of the position 240 mutants was able to bypass the

31

aup1Δ mutation. These results clearly indicate that modification of Mdh1 at position 199 can regulate

mitophagic trafficking of Mdh1-GFP downstream of Aup1 and Pkp2. For the effects of expressing

2

these constructs in WT cells, see SI appendix Figure S9.

Overexpression of Pkp2, but not Pkp1, can bypass the mitophagic defect of Mdh1-GFP in

5

aup1Δ cells

6

Deletion of AUP1 leads to hypo-phosphorylation of Mdh1-GFP, as judged by anti-

7

phosphoamino acid immunoblot (Figure 4A). This makes it implausible that the effects of Aup1 are

8

due to direct dephosphorylation of Mdh1 by the phosphatase. Alternatively, AUP1 could regulate

9

Pkp1 and/or Pkp2 which will, in turn, regulate the phosphorylation state of Mdh1. To test this second

10

possibility, we overexpressed either Pkp1 or Pkp2 in aup1Δ cells, and assayed delivery of Mdh1-GFP

11

to the vacuole under mitophagy inducing conditions through release of free GFP. As shown in Figure

12

4E, the overexpression of Pkp2, but not Pkp1, allowed free GFP release from Mdh1-GFP in aup1Δ

13

cells. This result is consistent with Pkp2 functioning downstream of Aup1, in regulating the

14

mitophagic clearance of Mdh1-GFP. In further support of this interpretation, overexpression of Pkp2

15

rescues the hypophosphorylation of Mdh1-GFP in aup1Δ cells (Figure 4F): While aup1Δ cells

16

harboring empty vector show hypophosphorylation of Mdh1-GFP, aup1Δ cells overexpressing Pkp2

17

show a clear recovery of the anti-phosphoamino acid immunoblot signal. This result strongly

18

indicates that Aup1 regulates Pkp2 activity, which in turn regulates the phosphorylation state of

19

Mdh1-GFP.

20
21

Deletion of AUP1 leads to changes in the protein interaction network of Mdh1-GFP

22

To probe the mechanism by which changes in phosphorylation pattern affect mitophagic

23

trafficking of Mdh1-GFP, we compared its interactomes in WT and aup1 cells by quantitative

24

proteomics. Anti-GFP immunoprecipitations from SILAC-labeled WT and aup1Δ cells grown on

25

lactate were performed in the presence or absence of Mdh1-GFP expression, followed by MS

26

analysis. The raw MS data are shown in supplemental table V. As shown in Figure 5A, most of the

27

significant interactors of Mdh1-GFP appear above the diagonal, indicating that generally, Mdh1-GFP

28

interacts more strongly with these proteins in the aup1 background, at least on day 1. We further

29

validated individual interactions by tagging putative interaction partners with the HA epitope, and

30

assaying native co-immunoprecipitation with Mdh1-GFP. The individual interactions tested included

31

the previously known interactor Cit1-HA, the newly identified interactor Idh1-HA, and Mic60-HA, a

32

known Mdh1 interactor which did not come up in our SILAC screen (41, 42). In all three cases, we

1

were able to recapitulate the general interactome data, as all interactions (in day 1 samples) were

2

stronger in the mutant, relative to WT (Figure 5B-D). The Cit1-Mdh1 interaction was far stronger on

3

day 1 in the aup1Δ mutant than in WT, and increased on day 4 in the mutant, relative to day 1 (Figure

4

5B). Idh1-HA also showed stronger interaction with Mdh1-GFP in the day 1 samples (Figure 5C) but

5

this reversed on day 4. Finally, the Mic60 interaction showed increased interaction in the mutant, but

6

weakened considerably between days 1 and 4 of the incubation (Figure 5D) such that the interaction

7

in WT cells became undetectable in the day 4 sample. Thus, deletion of AUP1 appears to have

8

dynamic and divergent effects on the Mdh1 interactome, which may underlie its effects on

9

mitophagic targeting of the protein.

10
11

Deletion of AUP1, and point mutations which abrogate mitophagic trafficking of Mdh1, alter

12

the distribution of the Mdh1-GFP reporter protein within the mitochondrial network

13

We previously published that GFP chimeras of protein species which undergo inefficient

14

mitophagy appear to be segregated within the network, relative to a generic mitochondrial RFP

15

reporter (31). We therefore wanted to test whether the molecular perturbations which were found to

16

affect mitophagic trafficking in the present study, also affect the distribution of the Mdh1-GFP

17

reporter protein within the mitochondrial network. As shown in Figure 6A, there is a clear difference

18

in the distribution of Mdh1-GFP between WT cells and aup1Δ cells at day 2 of the incubation, with

19

aup1Δ cells exhibiting apparent clumping of the GFP signal to discrete dots within the mitochondrial

20

network as defined by the mtRFP signal. Consistent with this, Figure 6B illustrates that wild-type

21

Mdh1-GFP, and a point mutant which does not reduce mitophagic trafficking, (S240A), show a

22

statistically significant increase in the signal overlap of the red and the green channels between day 1

23

and day 2 of the incubation, as determined using the JACoP plugin (43). In contrast, we observed that

24

mutants which do show a significant block in mitophagic trafficking display a statistically significant

25

decrease in signal overlap (relative to mtRFP) from day 1 to day 2, similar to that observed in the

26

aup1Δ strains. It is important to note that none of the mutations tested had any effect on the general

27

fractionation properties of Mdh1-GFP (see SI appendix Figure S8) making it unlikely that they affect

28

targeting of the protein into mitochondria. Rather, the data is consistent with some degree of

29

segregation of these mutants, relative to the overall available space in the mitochondrial matrix as

30

defined by the mtRFP fluorescence signal. In addition, we were able to directly follow segregation of

31

Discussion

5

The finding that within an individual protein species, differentially modified forms of

6

individual protein species can have different mitophagic fates constitutes an important advance in our

7

mechanistic understanding of protein-level mitophagic selectivity. It suggests that specific ‘degron-

8

like elements’ on mitochondrial matrix proteins are regulating selectivity, and this now allows further

9

analysis of the molecular mechanism. While individual mitochondrial phosphatases and kinases each

10

affect a subset of mitochondrial proteins, sometimes incompletely, we found that knockout of both

11

mitochondrial kinases (Pkp1 and Pkp2) completely blocked mitophagic trafficking of nearly all the

12

reporters tested in this study. Therefore, we can conclude that matrix protein phosphorylation is a

13

widespread determinant of mitophagic selectivity.

14

We further demonstrate that a novel protein phosphorylation cascade plays a role in the

15

regulation of selectivity. The Aup1 phosphatase functions upstream of the Pkp2 kinase in this

16

cascade, as (1) the Mdh1

17

Aup1 and Pkp2 (Figure 4, panels C and D); (2) it is unlikely that direct dephosphorylation of

18

threonine 199 by Aup1 is responsible, since the phosphomimetic mutations point to the

19

phosphorylated form of T199 as being ‘mitophagy competent’ (Figures 3A, 3D, 4C, and 4D). It is

20

much more likely that Aup1 is required, directly or indirectly, for the activation of a kinase such as

21

Pkp2. Indeed, we found that overexpression of Pkp2, but not Pkp1, can suppress both the Mdh1

22

mitophagy defect (Figure 4E) and the hypophosphorylation of Mdh1 (Fig. 4F), which are observed in

23

aup1Δ cells. This strongly suggests that Aup1 activity is required for activation of Pkp2, and that

24

Pkp2 directly phosphorylates Mdh1 at position 199. The fact that the S240D mutation is able to

25

prevent rescue of the aup1Δ phenotype by T199D in the context of the S240D T199D double mutant

26

(Figure 4C) may suggest that the two sites represent a combinatorial output, not a strictly hierarchical

27

one where position 240 affects the phosphorylation state of threonine 199.

mutant was able to partially bypass the specific requirements for both

28

The two known yeast mitochondrial kinases (Pkp1 and Pkp2) have been identified as

29

orthologs of mammalian PDKs (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases), which exist as a family of

30

paralogs with different tissue distribution in metazoans (44). Reports in the literature (45, 46) also

31

link the two phosphatases, Ptc5 and Aup1 (Ptc6) to Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Alpha subunit (Pda1)

1

dephosphorylation in yeast. We were unable to test for a direct role of Pda1 in mitophagy, as the

2

deletion mutant shows severely impaired growth in our liquid SL medium. Nonetheless, our data are

3

not consistent with Pda1 phosphorylation being the determinant of mitophagic selectivity and

4

efficiency in our experiments, for the following reasons. First of all, yeast Pda1 has only one verified

5

phosphosite which is regulated by these enzymes: serine 313. Thus, if all of these mitochondrial

6

kinases and phosphatases in yeast converge exclusively on the regulation of Pda1, then we expect

7

Aup1 and Ptc5 to have opposite phenotypes relative to Pkp1 and Pkp2. However, our results are

8

inconsistent with this prediction, and indicate that Aup1 functions to regulate and activate Pkp2 in

9

our readouts. In addition, the apparent lack of involvement of Ptc5 and the non-redundant role of

10

Aup1 in the phenotypes observed also argue against an interpretation which converges on Pda1

11

phosphorylation. Finally, one should note that there are hundreds of documented phosphorylation

12

sites in yeast mitochondrial proteins (37, 47) and it is therefore unlikely that the only role of Aup1,

13

Ptc5, Pkp1 and Pkp2 is to regulate phosphorylation of serine 313 on Pda1. While Pkp1 and Pkp2 are

14

separately and non-redundantly required for mitophagic trafficking of Mdh1-GFP (see Figure 1G),

15

only Pkp2 overexpression can partially bypass the aup1 block (Figure 4E). This either implies that

16

Pkp1 functions in a separate Aup1-independent pathway, or that Pkp1 is under additional regulation

17

such that its overexpression per se does not lead to sufficiently high activity levels.

18

Yeast cells are not the only system in which protein-level specificity was observed during

19

mitophagy. Hämäläinen et al (48) showed that in differentiation of MELAS patient-derived iPSCs

20

into neurons, mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) complex I (CI) underwent a selective mitophagic

21

degradation process which spared other RC components. In addition, they could show that the

22

remaining CI in these cells was segregated into distinct patches within the mitochondrial network,

23

while other RC components were evenly distributed. Their results demonstrate that intra-

24

mitochondrial selectivity of mitophagic degradation also occurs in mammalian cells, and is not

25

restricted to yeast. Interestingly, phosphorylation of complex I components has been reported in

26

mammalian cells (49). In cultured mammalian cells, Burman et al demonstrated selective mitophagic

27

clearance of a mutant ornithine transcarbamoylase (50). Finally, Vincow et al (51, 52), using

28

Drosophila, found that mitophagy is protein selective in a whole animal system.

29

The combined loss of Pkp1and Pkp2 has a reproducible effect on yeast survival in mitophagy-

30

inducing conditions (SI appendix Figure 13) which is consistent with previously published data for

31

aup1 cells (34). The precise mechanism by which defects in mitophagic selectivity affect cell

1

survival will be determined in future studies, and may hypothetically involve a toxic accumulation of

2

defective proteins or other molecular species.

3

How can we envision the effects of posttranslational matrix protein modification on

4

mitophagic selectivity of individual protein molecules? We previously proposed that phase separation

5

within the mitochondrial matrix, coupled with repeated fission and fusion cycles, would lead to a

6

distillation effect where the “minority” phase would be segregated and restricted to homogeneous

7

mitochondrial compartments (31, 33). If phosphorylation, or any other modification, affects the

8

partitioning of a given protein molecule between these phases, then it would also affect the protein’s

9

segregation tendencies. We then need to postulate that the accumulation of proteostatic load in a

10

given mitochondrial compartment leads to localized activation of mitophagy receptors, leading to

11

selective degradation of mitochondrial compartments enriched in specific protein species. This

12

outlines a model in which protein lesions lead to changes in posttranslational modifications of the

13

damaged molecules, which lead in turn to these proteins being concentrated into discrete

14

compartments that are targeted for mitophagic degradation (Figure 7). Regulation of phase

15

partitioning of proteins by phosphorylation has precedents: the regulation of RNA granule formation

16

in the cytosol (53–55) and milk globule formation (56) are two well-studied examples.

17

Such a model, where fission and fusion play an indirect role in mitophagy, would reconcile a

18

number of apparently contradictory results in the literature. Many publications have claimed that

19

mitochondrial fission is essential for mitophagy (57–60). However, most of these posit a direct

20

mechanistic role, either in generating ‘bite sized’ engulfable fragments and some even imply a

21

molecular interaction between the autophagic machinery and the fission machinery (61). In contrast,

22

a recent publication claimed that mitochondrial fission mediated by Drp1/Dnm1 is completely

23

unnecessary for mitophagy (32), and that the autophagic machinery itself mediates fission during

24

engulfment. A model in which mitochondrial dynamics has no role whatsoever does not explain the

25

reproducible slowdown of mitophagy in dnm1Δ cells, which was repeatedly observed in multiple

26

publications from different groups (31, 32, 62). However it is perfectly consistent with a ‘percolation’

27

or ‘distillation’ role of mitochondrial dynamics, in determining the selectivity and rate of mitophagy,

28

as we have proposed (31, 33).

29

An alternative hypothesis would be to postulate that specific protein-protein interactions

30

regulate the segregation of proteins into mitophagy-bound compartments. This type of model must

31

address several difficult questions. Are all mitochondrial proteins interacting with a small subset of

32

proteins which function promiscuously to mediate mitophagic selectivity? Surely one cannot have

1

each mitochondrial matrix protein surveilled by a different and unique mitophagy regulator? We

2

currently favor the nonspecific, phase separation model, as it imposes fewer constraints on the system

3

and requires fewer assumptions. However, further studies must be carried out before one of these

4

hypotheses is ruled out.

5

In summary, our results suggest a potential mechanism for generating mitophagic selectivity

6

at the molecular level, and indicate a role for protein phosphorylation in regulating mitophagic

7

trafficking of individual mitochondrial matrix protein molecules.

protein-level mitophagic selectivity. (A) deletion of AUP1 blocks mitophagic trafficking of

5

Mdh1-GFP. WT (PKY17)

6

plasmids as indicated, were grown on SL medium for the indicated times, as described in SI appendix

7

“Supplementary Materials and Methods”. The cells were then harvested and the corresponding

8

protein extracts (20 g/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-GFP

antibody. Note that truncation of the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (aup134) of Aup1

10

prevents the rescue. (B) Control demonstrating that mitophagic trafficking of integrated Mdh1-

11

GFP is absolutely dependent on the Atg32 receptor protein. PKY17 cells (WT) and PKY334 cells

PKY37, PKY61, PKY70 and PKY629) expressing mtDHFR-GFP from plasmid pPKB115 were

from the endogenous MDH1 promoter were incubated in SL medium for 1 or 5 days as indicated, and

immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. For quantification, the % free GFP was normalized to WT,

18

for each variant. Error bars indicate S.E. (N=3). (B) Point mutations in Mdh1-GFP prevent

19

mitophagic trafficking of the specific reporter, but do not affect mitophagic trafficking of a co-

20

expressed mtRFP reporter. Cells (PKY365) expressing WT Mdh1-GFP and the indicated variants

21

from the native MDH1 promoter as well as a mitochondrially targeted mtRFP were incubated in SL

22

medium for 5 days and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. WT Mdh1-GFP shows mitophagic

23

targeting (white arrows) by day 5, which co-localizes with the mtRFP signal in these cells. In

24

contrast, the mutants show defective routing to the vacuole, while the RFP signal in the vacuole is not

25

affected (white arrows). Scale bar = 1 m. (C) The difference between point mutants of Mdh1

26

cannot be explained by differential sensitivity to vacuolar proteases, and depends on

27

mitochondrial targeting. WT (HAY75), atg32Δ (HAY1239), and atg1Δ (HAY339) cells expressing

28

truncated versions of Mdh1 which lack the mitochondrial targeting sequence were subjected to

29

nitrogen starvation for 12 h to induce macroautophagy, and protein extracts were analyzed by

Mdh1-GFP, were grown in SL medium. At the indicated time points, protein extracts were generated

14

under native conditions and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies as detailed in “Materials

16

acid antibody (top) and anti-GFP antibody (bottom). Where noted (right panel), anti-GFP

17

Immunoprecipitates were treated with lambda phosphatase for 2 h. All data represent a minimum of 3

18

independent biological replicates. (B) SILAC analysis of relative phosphorylation levels at

20

collected from AUP1 (strain PKY520, heavy) and aup1 (strain PKY661, light) cells as described in

21

“Methods”, and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the ratio of

immunoisolated from PKY392 (AUP1 WT control) and PKY415 (aup1) cells after 1 day of

10

growth in synthetic lactate medium. Prior to protein extraction, the cells were mixed with an equal

11

amounts of isogenic untagged cells (light isotope labeling) as described in “Materials and

12

Methods”. Specifically interacting proteins were identified by comparing MDH1-GFP affinity

13

purifications to cells not expressing GFP-tagged MDH1 (ctrl; n=2). Significantly interacting

14

mitochondrial matrix proteins are highlighted in red (p<0.05, outlier test). All other identified

15

proteins are marked in grey. Significantly enriched matrix proteins that change their interaction by

Figure 7. A model for the role of protein phosphorylation in regulating mitophagic selectivity.

6

We suggest that phosphorylation of mitochondrial matrix proteins such as Mdh1 can regulate their

7

tendency to undergo mitophagy, within the matrix. (1) Increased phosphorylation of T199 and

8

decreased phosphorylation at S240 bring about a change in protein-protein interactions that leads to

9

segregation of this species. (2) multiple fusion and fission events lead to a ‘distillation’ like process

10

that enriches this species in a single mitochondrial compartment, along with other protein species

11

with similar properties. (3) A final fission event generates a mitochondrion sufficiently enriched in

12

‘degradation-bound’ species. We hypothesize that the proteostatic load in this compartment

13

generates a signal which activates the Atg32 receptor, possibly through Yme2-dependent clipping

14

of the Atg32 C-terminus, leading to engulfment of this compartment- with its enclosed protein

15

components- by autophagic sequestering membranes.
