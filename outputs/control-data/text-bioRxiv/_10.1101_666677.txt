Abstract

30

Ion beams are physical mutagens and used for plant and microbe breeding. They

31

are thought to cause mutations via a distinct mechanism from chemical mutagens or

32

gamma rays. Characteristics of ion-beam-induced mutations have been analyzed using

33

marker genes; however, little is known about the extent of the mutations induced by ion

34

beams at a genomic level. To understand the properties of ion beam-induced mutations at

35

a genomic level, we conducted whole-exome sequencing of rice DNA. DNA extracted

36

from carbon-ion-beam-induced rice mutants were fragmented and captured with a custom

37

probe library covering 66.3 M bases of all exons and miRNAs. A total of 56 mutations,

38

including 24 single nucleotide variations, 23 deletions, and 5 insertions, were detected in

39

5 mutant rice lines (2 dwarf and 3 early-heading-date mutants). The mutations were

40

distributed among all 12 chromosomes, and the average mutation frequency in the M1

41

generation was estimated to be 2.6 × 10-7 per base. Many single base insertions and

42

deletions were associated with homopolymeric repeats, whereas larger deletions up to 7

43

base pairs were more linked to polynucleotide repeats in the DNA sequences of the

44

mutation sites. Among 56 mutations, 6 (1.2 mutations per line on average) were classified

45

as high-impact mutations that caused a frame shift or loss of exons. A gene that was

46

functionally related to the phenotype of the mutant was disrupted by a high-impact

47

mutation in 4 of the 5 lines, suggesting that whole-exome sequencing of an ion-beam-

48

irradiated mutant could facilitate detection of a candidate gene responsible for the mutant

49

phenotype.

Introduction

52

Ion beams are charged particles that are derived from particle accelerators using

53

electromagnetic fields. As with other ionizing radiations, ion beams cause damage to

54

DNA molecules in living organisms and have been used as physical mutagens for plant

55

and microbe breeding [1–3]. Ion beams are characterized by the deposition of a high

56

energy transfer per unit length (linear energy transfer, LET) and are believed to induce

57

mutations as a consequence of distinct biological effects from low LET radiation such as

58

gamma-rays and electrons. In fact, during the screening of mutants from irradiated

59

explants of carnations, ion beams induced a wider variety of mutants in terms of flower

60

color and shape than gamma-rays and X-rays [4]. The appearance of more flower color

61

variations in the ion-beam-irradiated population has also been observed in

62

chrysanthemums [1]. In contrast, no remarkable difference in the mutation spectrum

63

between ion-beam and gamma-ray irradiation has also been observed [5].

64

Characterization of ion beam-induced mutations in plant DNA was conducted via

65

several approaches using Arabidopsis, a model plant for plant molecular genetics. The

66

most common approach for characterizing germline mutations is the isolation of mutants

67

deficient in well-characterized marker genes responsible for visible phenotypes such as

68

seed color (tt) and leaf trichome morphology (gl), followed by analysis of the DNA

69

sequence of the marker gene [6–9]. The isolation of mutants or tissue sectors of well-

70

characterized marker genes is also useful for characterizing ion-beam-induced

71

somaclonal mutations by detecting the loss of heterozygosity [10–12]. An alternative

72

method that can eliminate the isolation of mutant plants is the use of the rpsL (Escherichia

73

coli ribosomal protein small subunit S12) mutation detection system [13,14]. In this

74

system, plants containing the rpsL transgene are irradiated, followed by genomic DNA

75

extraction from irradiated transgenic plants and introduction into E. coli. Mutated

76

nonfunctional rpsL DNA fragments can be recovered from drug-resistant E. coli colonies.

77

The results of these experiments using marker genes suggested that 1) ion beams induce

78

various types of mutations in plant DNA, such as base(s) substitutions, DNA insertions

79

and deletions (InDels), inversions (INVs), and chromosomal translocations, 2) regarding

80

germline mutations, ion beams induce a higher ratio of rearrangement [InDels (> 100 bp),

81

inversions, translocations, and total deletions of the marker gene] than electron beams,

82

which induce mostly point-like mutations [base substitutions and InDels (< 100 bp)] [7],

83

3) the size of deletion induced by ion beams correlates positively with the degree of LET

84

[11,15,16], and 4) most mutants obtained by the pollen-irradiation method carried large

85

deletions reaching up to > 6 Mb, most of which are not transmissible to the next

86

generation [10].

87

Recent advances in genome analysis technologies have allowed us to analyze mutations

88

more quantitatively at the genomic level without bias arising from genomic positioning

89

and the functional significance of the DNA sequences of a specific marker gene. The

90

mutation-accumulating experiment combined with whole genome analysis of next-

91

generation sequencing revealed the estimated spontaneous mutation rate in Arabidopsis

92

to be 7 × 10−9 base substitutions per site per generation [17]. Whole genome sequencing

93

of ion beam-irradiated Arabidopsis DNA suggested that 200-Gy carbon ion beams

94

increased the mutation rate by nearly 47-fold compared with the spontaneous mutations

95

[18]. In addition, Arabidopsis whole genome sequencing has demonstrated that the

96

frequency and type of mutations induced by ion beams are affected by the LET of ion

97

beams [19] and the physiological status of irradiated tissues [20].

98

Rice is one of the most important crops for humans and is a major target crop for ion-

99

beam breeding [21–25]. Several genes that cause mutant phenotypes were successfully

100

cloned by map-based cloning from ion-beam-induced rice mutants, and the mutation sites

101

in the genes were characterized [22,25]. However, due to a relatively large genome size

102

compared with the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis, the characterization of ion

103

beam-induced mutations at the genomic level was not achieved in rice until Ichida et al.

104

[26] recently established a multiplexed and cost-efficient whole-exome sequencing

105

procedure in rice. In the present work, we employed the whole-exome sequencing

106

procedure to analyze the properties of induced mutations in selected rice mutants

107

generated with carbon ion beams accelerated using the Azimuthally Varying Field (AVF)

108

cyclotron of the Takasaki Ion Accelerators for Advanced Radiation Application (TIARA)

109

at TARRI, QST. We also demonstrated that the limited number of induced mutations with

110

a potentially high impact on protein function quickly narrowed down the candidate genes

111

responsible for the mutant phenotypes.

116

Rice seeds (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare, NPB) harvested in RBD, NARO (Hitachi-

117

118

12~13% by keeping the rice seeds in a plant growth chamber (BIOTRON LPH200, NK

119

system, Japan) set at 24 °C and 60% RH for 4 days just before irradiation. Then, the seeds

120

were irradiated with 10 to 150 Gy of 25.9 MeV/u 12C6+ ions (LET on surface: 76 keV/μm)

accelerated by an AVF cyclotron in TIARA, TARRI, QST (Takasaki, Japan). The

122

irradiated seeds were sown on soil to grow plants (M1 plants) in a greenhouse at TARRI,

123

QST. The dose response for the survival rate and plant height at one month after sowing

124

were measured. The seeds treated with 40 Gy of

125

screening of mutants. M2 or M3 seeds were harvested from every individual mature M1

126

or M2 plant, respectively. For selection of mutant candidates, M2 and M3 plants were

127

grown in the greenhouse at TARRI, QST or in an experimental paddy field at RBD,

128

NARO (36°52'45"N 140°39'81"E). Some mutant lines were backcrossed to NPB. The

129

resulting seeds (F1) were germinated and grown in the greenhouse to generate seeds of

130

F2 plants, which were used for linkage analysis between the mutations and the mutant

DNA extraction, whole exome capturing, and sequencing

134

Genomic DNA for whole exome capturing was extracted from rice leaves using

135

MagExtractor –Plant Genome– (Toyobo, Japan) according to a protocol supplied by the

136

manufacturer. One microgram of genomic DNA from individual samples was fragmented

137

using a Covaris S220 instrument (Covaris inc, USA). The resulting DNA fragments were

138

purified with AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter, USA). Barcoded sequencing

139

libraries were prepared using NextFlex Rapid DNA-Seq Kits (Bioo Scientific, USA)

140

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After double-sided size-selection with AMPure

141

XP, pre-capture amplification was performed for 12 cycles with the supplied primers 1

142

and 2. The Os-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 sequences and annotations were used

148

was designed and synthesized as a SeqCap EZ Developer Library (Roche Diagnostics,

149

USA). After 16–20 h of hybridization at 47 °C, the hybridized DNA fragments were

150

captured using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin,

151

Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), washed, and amplified by PCR using KAPA HiFi

152

Hotstart Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems) with the same primers described above. The

153

whole exon-enriched libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina,

154

USA) in PE100 mode.

155

Data analysis was performed with the bioinformatics pipeline described elsewhere [26].

156

Briefly, the resulting sequencing reads were mapped to the reference sequences using the

157

BWA-MEM program version 0.7.15 (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) with default

parameters,

as the line-specific (real) mutations. For the GATK and Pindel results, the detected line-

170

specific mutations were further filtered out by the following criterion: 1) a mutation that

Estimation of the genome-wide mutation frequency

195

Mutation frequencies (MFs) were calculated by dividing the total number of mutations

196

detected in individual plant DNA by the total number of nucleotides in the captured target

197

region (66,258,908 bases). Assuming all mutations arise as heterozygotes in the M1

198

generation and are simply inherited according to Mendelian characteristics, all

199

homozygous mutations in M2 and later generations are transmitted to the next generation,

200

but a quarter of the heterozygous mutations are not transmitted, the number of mutations

201

occurred in M1 plants (N1) is estimated as

202

N1 = 2n / (2n-1 +1) × Nn

203

where n is the generation and Nn is the number of mutations in the Mn diploid genome.

204

For comparison with the whole genome sequencing results of other researchers in the

205

referenced articles, the number of mutations was divided by the size (number of bases) of

206

the reference genome described in the articles.

212

We chose the rice cultivar Nipponbare (NPB) in this work because its high-quality whole

213

genome sequence is publicly available [28]. Since the water content of a seed affects its

214

radiation sensitivity [29], we adjusted the water contents of the seeds to 12 ~ 13% before

215

irradiation. To estimate the biological effectiveness of the carbon ion beam on the seeds

216

of NPB, dose response curves for the survival rate and plant height were generated (Fig

217

1A). Because a shoulder dose or slightly lower dose in the survival curve is empirically

218

considered as the optimum for obtaining a large number of mutants [1,5,21], the absorbed

219

dose chosen for the genetic screen in this work was 40 Gy, approximately 2/3 of the

220

shoulder dose (approximately 60 Gy) for the survival curve and slightly over the shoulder

221

dose for the dose response curve of plant height.

232

To estimate the mutagenic effect of 40 Gy irradiation of carbon ion beams, the M2

233

seeds (4 ~ 10 seeds / M1 line) from 2,039 individual M1 plants were sown on soil, and

234

chlorophyll mutants were searched at the seedling stage. In this pilot study, several types

235

of chlorophyll mutants, showing a pale or white leaf color, were identified (Fig 1B). The

236

appearance rate of the chlorophyll mutants was 6.6% (134 / 2,039 M1 lines), suggesting

237

that the carbon-ion-beam irradiation effectively induced mutations in the rice genome as

238

expected. We also screened other types of mutants with an altered phenotype from this

239

M2 population in the green house and paddy field. In this work, we focused on two dwarf

241

generation (Fig 2) for further experiments. The mutant lines “885” and “3098” were

243

identified in the greenhouse, whereas lines “IRB3517-3”, and “IRB3790-2” were found

in the paddy field. Line “786-5” was initially found in the green house as a mutant with

Homozygosity of the mutant phenotypes was confirmed in the M3 generation of all the

in the M4 generation. Leaf tissues excised from an M3 plant of each line except “3098”,

for which the leaf was from an M2 plant, were subjected to genomic DNA extraction for

whole-exome sequencing analysis.

Results of the whole-exome captured sequencing in rice

270

We subjected all five mutants to whole-exome capture and massively parallel

271

sequencing analysis to comprehensively identify the mutations introduced by the carbon-

272

ion beam irradiation. By whole-exome capture followed by Illumina sequencing, we

273

obtained the sequence data for 61.0 ~ 69.9 million unique reads with 6.08 ~ 6.96 billion

274

unique bases aligned to the reference genome (Table 1). The number of bases mapped on

275

the target region was 2.38 ~ 2.78 billion. The mean target coverage was 36 ~ 42, and the

276

percentage of all target bases achieving 10 times or greater coverage was 95.4 ~ 96.0%

Through the pipeline described in Materials and Methods, GATK, Pindel and Bedtools programs initially called 61 line-specific
mutations in the target regions. By manual verification of VCF files, two or three mutations that were overlapped or located adjacent to
one another were considered as one mutation and categorized as a replacement (RPL) (mutation #12, 13, 37 in Table 2, S2 Table and Fig
3). In the Bedtools program, one large deletion was suggested on chromosome 3 of the “IRB3517-3” genome. This large deletion was also
called by the Pindel program (mutation # 38). Consequently, the number of mutations was reduced to 56 (Table 2 and 3). To verify the
accuracy of the mutation calling in the pipeline, DNA fragments corresponding to the 25 selected mutations (Table 2), including the
junction sites of the large deletion (mutation #38) and the inversion (mutation #52), were amplified by PCR and reanalyzed by Sanger
sequencing. The sequences of all the selected mutations were confirmed as they were called by the pipeline, except the 3-bp shift at one
of the junction sites of the #52 inversion, suggesting that the results of our exome analysis were reliable, at least in regard to false positives.

Fig 3. Nucleotide sequences in the mutation site of 3 RPLs (#12, 13, and #37) and
junction sites of the 535-kb INV (#52).
Sequences in the NPB control and mutants are shown at the top and bottom, respectively.
The underlined regions indicate the nucleotides of “Reference” and “Alternatives” in S2
Table. For mutations #12 and #37, altered nucleotides between the NPB control and
mutants are shown in red. The dinucleotide repeats in control DNA of #12 and #37
mutation sites are indicated by top-opened brackets. For #52, green and blue letters are
overlapped and deleted nucleotides in junction sites. Inverted sequences, excluding the
overlapped nucleotides, are shown in red.

The 56 mutations consisted of 24 single nucleotide variations (SNV), 23 deletions
(DELs), 5 insertions (INSs), 1 inversion (INV), and 3 RPLs (Table 2 and 3). The average
number of mutations per line was 11.2 ± 3.3 for all five mutant lines and 11.5 ± 3.7 for
the four M3 lines. The mutations were distributed among all 12 chromosomes (Fig 4).
The 1 bp DEL (mutation #40) of ”IRB 3517-3” and the 535 kb-large INV (mutation #52)
of “IRB 3790-2” were located at the same region on the upper arm of chromosome 6. The
mutation frequencies (MFs) were calculated to be 1.2 × 10-7 to 2.4 × 10-7 per base, and
the MFs in the M1 generation were estimated to be 1.9 × 10-7 to 3.9 × 10-7 per base and,
on average, 2.6 × 10-7 per base (Table 3).

the deletion or insertion. The green box in the upper arm of chromosome 6 shows the
535-kb inverted region of mutation #52. The position of centromeres are based on the OsNipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 database (RAP-DB https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/).

We compared the estimated MFs to previous genome-wide mutation studies in rice. The
whole-exome sequencing of unselected M2 plants obtained from dry rice seeds irradiated
with 150 Gy of carbon ions (135 MeV/u, LET: 30 keV/μm) reported that the number of
mutations was 9.06±0.37 (average ± standard error) per plant [26]. MF were estimated as
2.2 ×10-7 per base by dividing the number of mutations with 41.75-Mb of the targeted
exon region. These values are comparable to the values of the present study. In another
case, the exome analysis of rice EMS-mutagenized DNA with 39-Mb target probes
detected an average of 70 to 508 mutations per individual M2 plant of 4 independent
capture experiments [30]. MFs in M2 plants can be calculated as 1.7 × 10-6 to 1.3 × 10-5
per base. In contrast, whole genome sequencing of 3 independent regenerated rice plants
by tissue culture suggested that 2,492, 1,039, and 450 SNVs occurred in the M1
generation, indicating that the average of MF for base substitution in M1 was 3.5 × 10-6
per base [31]. Another whole genome sequencing of regenerated rice plants that were
selfed for 8 consecutive generations detected 54,268 DNA polymorphisms, including
37,332 SNPs and 16,936 small INSs and DELs, indicated that the MF was 1.5×10−4 per
site for total polymorphisms [32]. Conversely, large-scale whole genome sequencing of
a mixed population of M2 and M3 of fast neutron (FN) rice mutant correction identified

91,513 mutations in 1,504 lines [33], estimating the MF in this population to be 1.6 × 107

per base. The number of detectable mutations by genome sequencing is highly

dependent on the experimental conditions of mutagenesis, quality and quantity of
massively parallel sequencing, and bioinformatics pipeline for sequence analysis. It
should also be noted that the number of mutations per genome estimated by wholegenome sequencing might be larger than that estimated by whole-exome sequencing
because most genomic regions are intergenic regions, and a mutation occurring in the
intergenic region does not have a direct impact on the function of a protein that may affect
the viability of cells and individual rice lines. Although an accurate comparison is difficult
for the above reasons, the data published to date along with our results suggest that carbon
ion irradiation seems to induce a reduced number of mutations in rice DNA than EMSand tissue culture-based mutagenesis and a similar number to FN mutagenesis.
The values of MF were also reported in carbon ion-mutagenized Arabidopsis: 3.4 × 10−7
single base mutation per base of an M1 plant with seeds exposed to 200Gy of 12C6+ ions
(43 MeV/u; average LET within samples, 50 keV/μm) [18]. Another report using 17.3
MeV/u carbon ions (surface LET, 107 keV/μm) at TIARA also showed MFs of 2.7 × 10−7
and 3.2 × 10−7 per base in M2 plants generated by dry seed irradiation (125 and 175 Gy,
respectively), and 1.8 × 10−7 and 1.6 × 10−7 per base in M2 plants generated by seedling
irradiation (20 and 30 Gy, respectively) [20]. Kazama et al. [19] reported 307 and 473
mutations (sum of rearrangements, single base substitutions, and small INSs and DELs)
in 8 lines of argon ion- (290 keV/μm, 50 Gy) and carbon (30.0 keV/μm, 400 Gy) ionmutagenized M3 populations obtained by dry seed irradiation, implying MFs of 3.2 ×
10−7 and 5.0 × 10−7 per base, respectively. Therefore, MFs caused by ion-beam irradiation
seem to be the same in order of magnitude between Arabidopsis and rice.

Among 56 mutations detected, 24 (43%), 23 (41%) and 5 (9%) mutations were SNVs,
DELs, and INSs. Although it is difficult to perform a direct comparison because the
absorbed dose for irradiation causing the same biological effect was not adjusted, the ratio
of SNVs in this work was similar but slightly lower than the irradiation results of a lower
level of LET carbon ion (135 MeV/u; LET 30 keV/μm) reported by Ichida et al. [26], in
which more than half (58%) of the detected mutation were SNVs, followed by DELs
(37%) and INSs (4%), in 110 independent M2 lines from dry rice seeds irradiated with
150 Gy of carbon ions. The FN mutagenesis of rice seeds also induced SNVs most
frequently (48%) and DELs accounting for 35% [33].
The most frequent (38% of the total SNVs) base changes were G to A and C to T (GC
→ AT) transitions (Fig 5A). Another major base change was the AT → GC transition,

which accounts for 33% of the total SNVs. This result is in contrast to the EMSmutagenized rice DNA, in which most of the mutations were SNVs of GC → AT
transitions [30]. Regarding to size of the 28 INSs and DELs (InDels), 14 InDels (50%)
were 1 bp in size, and most of the InDels (89%) were less than 10 bp in length, excluding
3 relatively large DELs (mutation #7, #23, and #38), which were 128, 46, and 33.6 kb in
length, respectively (Fig 5B).

Of the 28 InDels, 16 (57%) occurred within nucleotide repeats such as homopolymers
that consisted of 3 or more repeats of the same nucleotides, or polynucleotide repeats that
consisted of either partial or full repetitive sequences (Table 4). Many of the single-base
InDels (8 of the 14 events; 57%) were associated with homopolymers, but none of them
were associated with a polynucleotide repeat. In contrast, InDels that were more than 2
bp in length showed a greater linkage to polynucleotide repeats (7 of the 14 events; 50%)
than homopolymers (1 of the 14 events; 7.1%). No such repeat was observed in the DEL
site that were more than 7 bp in length. A similar trend was observed in the presence of
homopolymers or polynucleotide repeats at flanking sequences of small InDels in the
genome of carbon ion-beam-irradiated Arabidopsis [18,20]. Hase et al. [34] inferred that
distinct mechanisms are involved in between the generation of the single base deletion
and larger-sized deletions in carbon ion-irradiated Arabidopsis. They also suggested that
much larger size deletions (≧ 50 bp) are generated via another distinct mechanism. The
presence or absence of characteristic repeats in the InDel site in our data may also suggest
that InDel generation mechanisms are different depending on the InDel size in the
irradiated rice genome.

The primary structure of the three mutations (#12, 13, and 37) classified as RPL are
shown in Fig 3. In two RPLs, #12 and #37, 3 and 8 nucleotides were replaced with single
bases accompanied by 2- and 7-bp deletions, respectively. In contrast, mutation #13 was
a dinucleotide substitution, in which GG was substituted with TA. No homopolymer, but
a dinucleotide repeat, was observed in the mutation site of #12 and #37 RPLs. In the 535kb INV (mutation #52), 2-bp overlapped nucleotides in one of the two junction sites along
with a 3-bp deletion on both sides were present (Fig 3). Although such a tendency was

observed in RPLs, it was difficult to determine whether these features in primary
sequences were related to the process during DNA repair and mutation generation since
the number of observed events was too small.
The effect of mutations on gene function was assessed by SnpEff [27]. The results
indicated that 5 and 13 mutations caused putatively high (frameshift_variant and
exon_loss_variant) and moderate (missense_variant and disruptive_inframe_deletion)
impacts on protein function classified according to the SnpEff output (Table 2 and S2
Table). In addition, by manually confirming the break points of an inversion (mutation
#52), we noticed that one of the two breakpoints of the inversion was located in a coding
region of a gene, Os06g0275000. Thus, this inversion was categorized as a high impact
mutation. In total, 6 mutations were classified as high impact mutations (an average of
1.2 such high-impact mutations per line) (Table 3). Among them, an exon_loss_variant
(mutation #38) consisted of a deletion of a 33.6 kb-DNA region and caused a loss of 5
genes located within this region. Thus, the number of affected genes by 6 potentially high
impact mutations was 10 (only 2 genes per line on average). Because high impact
mutations cause a probable change in protein function, it is highly possible that they are
causal mutations for the phonotypes of mutants. In fact, we found strong candidate
mutations possibly having a major role on the mutant phenotype in 4 out of 5 lines, as
demonstrated below.

Candidate genes that are responsible for mutant phenotypes
As described above, we isolated two dwarf mutants (lines “3098” and “885”) and three
early-heading-date mutants (lines “786-5”, “IRB3517-3”, and “IRB3790-2”) in the

present study (Fig. 2). Through whole-exome sequencing analysis, we successfully
identified candidate genes that might be responsible for the phenotypes of the mutants.
The mutant line “3098” was isolated as a dwarf mutant in the M2 population grown
in the green house. Homozygosity of the dwarf phenotype was confirmed in M3
progenies grown in the green house as well as in the paddy field (Fig 2A and B). The
seeds of line “3098” were small and rounded compared with those of NPB. The wholeexome sequencing analysis of DNA extracted from an M2 plant of line “3098” identified
10 mutations, mutations #1~10 in Table 2, including a 128-bp DEL (mutation #7)
spanning the 3rd intron and 4th exon of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-1
subunit (GPA1, also called RGA1, and D1) gene, which was predicted to cause a
truncated protein (Fig 6A). The functional disruption of this gene (Os05g0333200) is
known to cause the Daikoku dwarf (d1), which is characterized by broad, dark green
leaves, compact panicles, and short, round grains [35,36]. These phenotypes were
apparent and quite similar in line “3098”. Although the initial analysis of whole-exome
sequences suggested that this mutation (mutation #7) was present as a heterozygote in
the M2 plant, PCR analysis using a specific primer set indicated that the mutation was
present as a homozygote in the same M2 plant. PCR analysis of 12 F2 plants (6 dwarf
and 6 normal-look plants) from a backcross between line “3098” and NPB and
subsequent self-crossing showed that all 6 dwarf plants harbored the 128-bp DEL
(mutation #7) in homozygotes, whereas the remaining 6 were heterozygotes or wild type.
Therefore, the 128-bp DEL in the D1 gene was thought to be a strong candidate
responsible for the dwarf phenotype of line “3098”. The discrepancy in zygosity in the
results of the initial bioinformatics call (heterozygous) and PCR (homozygous), as well

DNA sequence encoding the D1–like gene (Os05g0341300), which is likely a
pseudogene, in the same chromosome in the NPB genome [37]. A BLAST search of the
350-bp DNA sequence of the D1 gene, including the 128 bp-deleted region and ~100bp upstream/downstream sequences (positions 15612701-15613050 on chromosome 5),
indicated 99% identity (3 nucleotide difference in 350 bp) with the region from
16009580 to 16009929 on chromosome 5, in which the D1–like gene is located (Fig 7).
The nucleotide sequences were completely identical between the D1 and D1-like genes
in the 100-base upstream region of the deletion. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish
the right origin of short sequence reads in these regions, and some sequencing reads
originating from the D1–like gene region were mapped to the deleted region in the D1
gene. Consequently, the mutation was predicted to be heterozygous.

The line “885”, a dwarf mutant, was isolated from the M2 population grown in the
greenhouse, and its homozygosity was confirmed in the M3 population in both the green
house and paddy field (Fig. 2A). Sixteen mutations were identified by whole-exome
sequencing (Table 2). Although 4 of them (mutations #28, 30, 34, and 35) were
homozygous nonsynonymous mutations (S2 Table), the analysis of F2 lines suggested
that none of these four mutations were linked to the dwarf phenotype of the “885” line.
It is possible that mutations located outside of the exon regions, presumably promoter
regions, could be responsible for the dwarf phenotype observed in this line.
The mutant line “786-5” was initially identified as a mutant with wide leaves in our
greenhouse (Fig 2C). The mutant also showed increased leaf blade declination (Fig 2C).
The homozygous phenotype was confirmed in the M3 generation. In the paddy field, all

M4 plants (n = 45) started heading 15 to 17 days earlier than the NPB control and showed
broken flag leaves (Fig 2D). The whole-exome sequencing analysis of DNA extracted
from an M3 plant identified 9 mutations: #11 to #19 in Table 2. Among them, the 5-bp
DEL (mutation #15) in the first exon of the PHYTOCHROME B gene (PHYB;
Os03g0309200) caused a frameshift and was present in the homozygote (Fig 6B and
Table 2). We considered this mutation to be the most likely candidate causing the
characteristic morphology and early heading date phenotype in line “786-5” because
similar phenotypes have also been reported in a rice phyB mutant [38].
The early-heading-date mutant “IRB3517-3” was identified in the M2 population. All
M3 plants (n = 45) grown in the patty field showed earlier heading than the NPB control
(Fig 2D), indicating that the genotype in the M2 plant was homozygous. The wholeexome sequencing analysis of DNA extracted from an M3 plants revealed 13 mutations
(#36 to #48), including 8 homozygous mutations (Table 2). The only high impact
mutation identified was a 33.6-kb large deletion on chromosome 3 (mutation #38). The
deleted region contained 5 genes, namely, Os03g0793000, Os03g0793100,
Os03g0793300, Os03g0793450, and Os03g0793500 (Fig 6C). Among the 5 genes, the
HEDAING DATE 16 (HD16; Os03g0793500) gene was the most likely candidate for the
early heading phenotype in the “IRB3517-3” mutant. The HD16 gene encodes a casein
kinase I protein and is known to act as an inhibitor of rice flowering by phosphorylating
and activating the GHD7 protein, one of the major players in the photoperiodic control
of rice flowering [39]. It has been reported that a near-isogenic line with decreased
kinase activity of the HD16 protein shows early flowering under a natural day length
[39].

Another early-heading-date mutant line is “IRB3790-2”. DNA from one of the M3
plants obtained from an M2 plant that exhibited an early heading date (Fig 2D) was
subjected to whole-exome sequencing analysis. However, this M2 plant was not a
homozygote regarding the early-heading-date phenotype because plants with early and
normal heading date phenotype were segregated in the M3 population derived from this
M2 plant. We failed to establish a homozygous population even in the M4 generation
and had to wait until M5 to obtain a homozygous population for the early heading date.
The sequencing results indicated that there were 8 mutations (#49 to #56), including one
high impact mutation (mutation #52), which was a 543-kb INV on chromosome 6 (Table
2). As demonstrated above, one of the break points of this INV was located in the second
exon of the HEADING DATE 1 (HD1; Os06g0275000) gene (Fig 6D), which encodes a
zinc-finger type transcription factor and regulates the expression of HEADING DATE
3, a mobile flowering signal [40,41]. Although the position of the break point (R347) is
near the C-terminal region of the encoded protein, the truncated HD1 protein generated
by the INV lacks the CCT motif (amino acid position from 326 to 369), a conserved
domain that is widely present in flowering-related proteins and essential for the protein
function of HD1 [42], implying that the truncated HD1 protein produced in “IRB37902” was a loss-of-function protein. PCR analysis of selected 8 early and 12 non earlyheading-date individuals (scored on August 10, 2018) in the M4 population using
primers detecting #52 INV showed that all 8 early heading date plants possesses this
INV in homozygous but not other plants, suggesting that this inversion was likely the
cause of the early heading date. We did not determine why homozygous hd1 plants were
not obtained until the M4 generation, even though we chose a plant that exhibited the
earliest heading date phenotype in the population to obtain seeds for the next generation.

Heterozygous plants (HD1 / hd1) are thought to show an intermediate phenotype
between wild type and hd1 homozygous plants [43]. One possibility is that another
mutated gene that affects the heading date or viability may be present in the genome of
the selected plants for propagation. Further genetic analysis may reveal additional
factors that contribute to a minor extent to heading date determination in this mutant line.
In summary, we have identified likely candidate genes responsible for the mutant
phenotypes in 4 of the 5 mutant lines examined. Although further analyses, such as
genetic complementation, RNA inactivation, and/or genome editing, are required to
confirm the relationship between the candidate genes and mutants’ phenotypes, this
work showed that the combination of ion-beam mutagenesis and whole-exome
sequencing enabled us to quickly narrow down probable candidate genes. In this work,
we isolated mutants with remarkable phenotypes that could be very easily identified in
a greenhouse or a paddy field. This finding could explain why the candidate genes were
largely previously reported genes. Because the average number of high impact mutations
per line was very low, it would be quite easy to narrow down candidate genes for the
mutant phenotype, even if the responsible gene was an uncharacterized gene, by
examining the genetic linkage between the identified mutation and the phenotype.
Although a recent fulfillment of genetic resources in rice enabled us to take a reverse
genetic approach, such as the use of transposon- and T-DNA-tagged mutant libraries
[44] as well as genome editing techniques [45], to understand the genetic bases of gene
function and improve economically important traits in rice, a forward genetics approach
with induced mutagenesis is still important to identify genes that cause uncharacterized
mutant phenotypes or uncharacterized genes that cause mutant phenotypes. Induced
mutagenesis can be applied not only in rice but also in other non-model plants that do

not fulfil genetic information and resources. It would be particularly useful to introduce
new phenotypic variations into plants with a specific genetic background or to improve
traits of already established varieties used in agricultural production. Unlike tagged
mutations, such as transposon- or T-DNA tagging, induced mutagenesis has not been
thought to be advantageous to isolate a casual gene because it requires large efforts such
as positional cloning. However, recent “mapping by sequencing” techniques that
combine mutagenesis techniques and massively parallel sequencing have been
employed and promoted for the rapid detection of casual genes in mutants isolated by
forward genetics [46]. For example, in the MutMap method [47], one of the mapping by
sequencing techniques developed to identify rice genes, the selected mutants generated
by EMS mutagenesis were back-crossed, and the F2 generation was obtained. DNA from
F2 individuals who expressed mutant phenotype was pooled and subjected to NGS. Then,
SNPs that were commonly present in mutant F2 DNA were detected by scoring the SNP
index. This technique can secure an accurate evaluation of mutant phenotype because
the work produces mutants and their parental lines in almost identical genetic
backgrounds and can eliminate the generation of new polymorphic DNA markers for
mapping because massively parallel sequencing can detect many SNPs in the F2
population generated by EMS, dramatically shortening the time required to clone a gene.
As discussed earlier, ion beams induce a reduced number of mutations than EMS and
more effectively cause InDels that often lead to complete inactivation of gene function.
Therefore, it can be expected that a reduced number of candidate gene responsible for
the mutation phenotype will be produced by ion beam irradiation compared with EMS.
Indeed, in this work, we successfully identified candidate genes from 4 mutants in a very
efficient manner by evaluating mutation catalogues generated by whole-exome

sequencing. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis, the combination of ion-beam mutagenesis,
whole genome sequence, and rough mapping also successfully identified a casual gene
of a variegated leaf mutant [48]. Therefore, characterization of ion beam-induced
mutants by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing will enable promotion of the
effective isolation of causal genes for mutants. Further efforts to isolate useful mutants
by ion-beam irradiation and to detect useful genes from mutants by genome sequencing
will facilitate improvement of agronomically important traits in rice as well as in other
plants.

Conclusions
The properties of ion beam-induced mutations in rice were revealed by whole-exome
sequencing. The average mutation frequency in the M1 generation of ion beam-irradiated
rice was estimated to be 2.6 × 10-7 per base. The results suggest that carbon ion irradiation
seems to induce a reduced number of mutations in rice DNA than EMS- and tissue
culture-based mutagenesis and a similar number to FN mutagenesis. The identification of
a small number of high-impact mutation would facilitate detection of candidate genes
responsible for the phenotypes of mutants.
