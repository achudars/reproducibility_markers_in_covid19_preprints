ABSTRACT

11
12

Associations with gut microbes play a crucial role in the physiology, immune function, development, and

13

behavior of many insects. However, butterflies may be an exception to this pattern since butterfly

14

microbiomes do not show the host-specific and developmental shifts that are expected to evolve under

15

strong host-microbial associations. Here, we present the first experimental test of this hypothesis by

16

disrupting gut microbial communities of two butterfly species, Danaus chrysippus and Ariadne merione.

17

Larvae of both the species fed on host plant leaves that were either chemically sterilized or treated with

18

antibiotics had significantly reduced bacterial loads and disrupted gut bacterial communities substantially.

19

However, neither host species treated this way suffered a significant fitness cost. We did not find significant

20

variation in survival, growth and development between test larvae and control larvae. This suggested that

21

butterflies do not rely on their gut bacteria for digestion, detoxification, resource accumulation and

22

metamorphosis. Thus, our results provide empirical support for the growing realization that dependence on

23

gut bacteria for growth and survival is not a universal phenomenon across insects.

INTRODUCTION

27
28

Inter-specific interactions are crucial in shaping the ecology and evolution of organisms. This is perhaps

29

best understood in insects, which often have specific and intimate associations with gut microbes (bacteria

30

and fungi) that influence host biology [1–3]. The most obvious benefit provided by gut microbes is the

31

ability to digest and survive on specific foods, potentially facilitating the use of new dietary niches. For

32

example, termites [4,5], mosquitoes [6] and honeybees [7] rely on their gut bacteria for digestion of their

33

typical diet. The gut bacteria of coffee bean borers [8], oriental fruit flies [9] and diamondback moths [10]

34

detoxify the host diet, allowing survival on otherwise inedible food sources. In the western corn rootworm,

35

gut bacteria also allow the host to make a rapid dietary shift from corn to soybean within a few generations

36

[11]. Thus, insects have often evolved specific associations with their gut microbes that allow them to

37

occupy a diverse range of dietary resources. It is therefore not surprising that many groups of insects have

38

also evolved specific strategies to transmit such beneficial gut microbes across generations [12].

39
40

Butterflies present a contrast to this general pattern because they do not seem to have consistent diet-specific

41

or stage-specific associations with gut bacterial communities. For example, multiple species of wild-caught

42

butterflies harbor similar bacterial communities across the dramatic dietary and developmental transitions

43

that occur during metamorphosis [13]. In addition, butterfly larvae largely mirror the bacterial communities

44

of their diet, suggesting passive dietary acquisition of gut flora and relatively weak host-imposed selection

45

[13,14]. Carnivorous and herbivorous larvae of lycaenid butterflies do not harbor distinct bacterial

46

communities [15], suggesting that larvae do not depend on specific gut bacteria to consume different dietary

47

resources. Finally, recent experimental work in the butterfly Lycaeides melissa showed that diet-induced

48

variation in larval bacterial communities did not affect larval fitness [16]. These diverse studies suggest that

49

gut bacterial communities of butterflies are mostly transient and do not have a functional association with

50

their hosts. Here, we present a systematic experimental test of this hypothesis.

51
52

We measured the impact of gut microbes on two wild-caught butterfly species, Danaus chrysippus and

53

Ariadne merione (figure 1). Both species belong to the family Nymphalidae and their larvae feed on toxic

54

host plants that produce potent anti-herbivory compounds (figure 1). Danaus chrysippus larvae feed on a

55

group of plants called milkweeds (family Apocynacae) [17] whereas A. merione larvae specialize on two

56

plants from the family Euphorbiaceae: Ricinus communis (castor oil plant) and Tragia involucrata (Indian

57

stringing nettle) [17]. At our study site we found that D. chrysippus larvae largely fed on the locally

58

abundant milkweed, Calotropis gigantea. This plant produces white latex that contains cardiac glycosides

59

– mainly Calotropin that blocks the activity of the Na+/K+ pump of herbivores [18–21]. These cardiac

60

glycosdies are not only present in the latex, but also the foliage. Hence, the plant is poisonous to insects

61

[18,22–24]. Similarly, R. communis leaves and other tissues contain the alkaloid Ricinine [25–28] that also

62

kills insects, although the exact mode of action is unknown. Apart from such toxins, consuming plants

63

generally poses various challenges: leaves are typically difficult to digest, and have low nitrogen content

64

[1,29,30]. Thus, we tested whether the gut bacteria of D. chrysippus and A. merione aid in digestion and

65

dietary detoxification, as observed in other insects that feed on toxic food sources [31].

66
67

We eliminated gut microbes from D. chrysippus and A. merione larvae using two independent methods: a)

68

chemically sterilizing the larval diet, and b) administering antibiotics through the larval diet. Importantly,

69

we conducted these experiments with wild-caught insects and naturally available larval host plants to

70

maximize the relevance of our results to natural insect populations. We tested whether eliminating gut

71

microbes affected the development and survival of D. chrysippus and A. merione. We found that disrupting

72

gut bacteria did not affect butterfly growth and survival, suggesting the general absence of strong

73

associations between butterflies and their gut bacterial communities.

74
75

MATERIALS AND METHODS

76
77

Insect collection and rearing

78

To test the impact of removing or disrupting the bacterial community from larval guts, we conducted

79

experiments in multiple blocks for each host species. In each block, we split butterfly eggs into the

80

following broad treatments: (a) control, with no external treatment of leaves, (b) larvae fed with antibiotics

81

or chemically sterilized leaves, and (c) re-introduction of microbes from the larval gut or from leaf surfaces

82

on previously sterilized leaves. We collected D. chrysippus males and females on the campus of the

83

National Centre for Biological Science (NCBS) (13.0716° N, 77.5794° E). We kept adult butterflies in

84

cages (height ~2ft, length ~1ft and width ~1ft) along with their host plant C. gigantea in a climate-controlled

85

greenhouse maintained at 27-31°C. In each cage, we kept 1 female and ~1-2 males (in case the female had

86

not mated in the wild), along with nectaries containing artificial nectar solution (Birds Choice #NP1005,

87

USA). From each female, we obtained ~20–80 eggs, which we distributed equally into different treatment

88

groups. We obtained D. chrysippus eggs in the greenhouse because we found very few eggs on larval host

89

plants in nature. On the other hand, we found relatively large numbers of A. merione eggs on R. communis

90

plants around NCBS, which we used directly. For each block, we collected A. merione eggs from 5–10 host

91

plants. Note that the number of replicate larvae in each block and treatment was variable, and depended on

92

the number of eggs that were available. For each host species, we placed individual eggs in small plastic

93

containers (height ~ 5cm and diameter ~ 5cm) that were maintained in a larger plastic box (height ~12cm,

94

length ~ 1ft and width ~20cm). Every 24–48 hours, we supplied larvae with fresh leaves collected from the

95

natural habitat. We used leaves from 3–7 different host plants to include variation across plants and

96

associated microbial communities.

97
98

Chemical sterilization of diet

99

We carried out all experimental procedures in a laminar hood to minimize contamination by environmental

100

microbes. To eliminate microbes from C. gigantea leaves, we dipped them in 70% ethanol for 60 seconds

101

and 10% bleach for 30 seconds, followed by three washes with sterile distilled water. We dried leaves

102

completely and cut them into smaller pieces before feeding the larvae. To disentangle the effects of

103

sterilizing agents and microbial elimination, we re-introduced larval gut flora and leaf flora on pre-sterilized

104

leaves using two additional treatments. In one treatment, we created a frass (larval excreta) solution by

105

suspending ~500 mg frass from control group larvae in 5 ml of sterile Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

106

Control group larvae fed on untreated leaves that were expected to harbor the natural microbial community.

107

In the second treatment, we swabbed leaf surfaces of wild C. gigantea leaves and suspended the swabs in

108

5 ml sterile PBS. We painted frass or leaf swab solutions on one side of chemically sterilized leaves, and

109

allowed the leaf surface to dry before feeding larvae. We did not chemically sterilize R. communis leaves

110

because they became limp and permanently lost form when dipped in ethanol and bleach. Hence, we only

111

used antibiotic treatment for A. merione larvae, as described below.

112
113

Antibiotic treatment

114

We administered two doses of antibiotics to D. chrysippus and A. merione larvae. The low dose treatment

115

consisted of a mixture of Ampicillin (500 µg/ml), Tetracycline (50 µg/ml) and Streptomycin (100 µg/ml)

116

in sterile water, and the high dose treatment contained twice as much of each antibiotic. We selected

117

antibiotic concentrations based on previous studies with other insects that reported a significant reduction

118

in gut bacteria [6,8,32,33]. We applied the antibiotic cocktail on both sides of leaves. For D. chrysippus, in

119

two out of four experimental blocks, we painted the antibiotic solution on the leaves using a sterile

120

paintbrush; for the other two blocks, we sprayed the antibiotic solution on leaves. For A. merione, we

121

sprayed the antibiotic solution on leaves in all blocks. Each spray delivered 150-200 µl antibiotic solution;

122

we sprayed each side of each leaf 4-6 times. As a solvent control, we painted or sprayed leaves with sterile

123

double-distilled water. We let leaf surfaces dry before feeding larvae, administering antibiotics with every

124

feeding (every 24-48 hrs.) until pupation.

128

Determining larval gut flora

129

To quantify the degree of disturbance in bacterial communities of larvae fed with antibiotics and sterile

130

diet, we sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene on an Illumina MiSeq platform, at our in-house sequencing

131

facility. We extracted DNA from larvae from control and treated groups (n=2-3) using a Wizard genomic

132

DNA extraction kit (Promega) and amplified the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene using

133

300 bp paired-end sequencing as per the standard Illumina MiSeq protocol [34]. We tested for, but did not

134

find evidence of, contamination from DNA extraction kits (see supplementary methods). We analyzed de-

135

multiplexed sequences using QIIME (version 1.9.1; see supplementary methods) [35]. We filtered reads for

136

quality using a minimum quality score of q30 and removed chimeric sequences using USEARCH (version

137

6.1) [36]. We assembled filtered reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with 97% sequence

138

similarity using UCLUST, with the ‘open-reference OTU picking’ method in QIIME. To determine

139

taxonomy, we compared one representative sequence from each OTU against the Green Genes 16S

140

ribosomal gene database (Greengenes Database Consortium, version gg_13_5) using default QIIME

141

parameters. We used Permutational multivariate ANOVA (permanova, Adonis, package “Vegan”) [37] in

142

R [38] to compare bacterial communities of treated and untreated larvae.

143
144

To visualize the differences in bacterial communities across larvae with intact (control) vs. perturbed

145

(treated) gut flora, we carried out ordination analysis of bacterial communities based on bacterial abundance

146

and composition. We tested whether control and treated samples clustered differently using both

147

constrained and unconstrained ordination analysis. Unconstrained ordination analyzes samples without any

148

a priori information about groups (e.g. control vs. treated), whereas in constrained ordination, sample

149

groups are pre-defined. We performed Principle Component Analysis as unconstrained ordination using

150

the package “pca3d” in R [39]. For constrained ordination we performed Canonical Analysis of Principal

151

Coordinates based on discriminant analysis (CAPdiscrim) using the R package “BiodiversityR” [40].

152
153

To validate MiSeq results, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) to compare the amplification of bacterial

154

16S rRNA genes from dominant bacterial groups across control and treated samples. For qPCR, we used

155

the same DNA samples that we used for MiSeq analysis, quantifying the abundance of

156

Gammaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria relative to an internal control (18S rRNA gene of the host

157

butterfly; see supplementary methods).

158
159

Measuring host fitness and statistical analysis

160

For each host species, we conducted experiments in 3-4 blocks and measured 4-7 fitness proxies in each

161

case (see supplementary tables S1-S3 and supplementary methods), from the time eggs hatched until adults

162

eclosed. We measured larval length (throughout development), larval weight, pupal weight, time taken from

163

hatching until pupation, time taken from pupation until eclosion, and the weight of freshly eclosed adults.

164

For some experimental blocks, we also estimated larval digestion efficiency by measuring the gain in larval

165

weight per unit time and per gram of leaf consumed, and the amount of excreta produced by larvae per

166

gram of leaf consumed. We tested whether each fitness parameter differed significantly across different

167

treatments using generalized linear models (GLM), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple

168

comparisons in R, package “multcomp” [41]. For comparisons that were significant after performing

169

Tukey’s multiple comparison test, we report p values and log odds – “estimate (E)”. Finally, we tested

170

whether larval survival varies across treatments using Fisher’s exact test in R. We carried out pairwise

171

comparisons of larval mortality across control and treated groups (for instance, untreated leaves vs.

172

sterilized leaves) in each block to test whether bacterial elimination affected larval survival.

173
174

Overall, we tested whether removing gut bacteria altered larval growth, resource use, time required for

175

metamorphosis and larval survival. We could not test the impact of removing bacteria on adult fitness

176

because logistically it was very challenging to maintain large numbers of adults in sterile conditions during

177

mating and oviposition. Furthermore, since prior work shows that pupal and adult weights are good

178

predictors of fecundity in lepidopterans [42–46], we could obtain indirect estimates of adult fitness from

179

these measures.

180
181

RESULTS

182
183

Antibiotic treatment and dietary sterilization effectively disrupted larval microbiomes

184

Both dietary sterilization and antibiotic treatment significantly altered bacterial communities across treated

185

and untreated groups (Permutational multivariate ANOVA, p<0.05, 10000 permutations, figure 2, panels

186

A1-C1 and A2-C2; also see figures S1 & S2). Treated larvae also had lower bacterial loads, reflected in the

187

increased relative abundance of chloroplast and mitochondrial reads compared to untreated larvae (figure

188

2, panels A3-C3; a reduction in the number of bacterial 16S gene copies allows higher amplification of leaf-

189

derived chloroplast and leaf or host-derived mitochondria). Finally, quantitative PCR confirmed that

190

bacterial load reduced dramatically after antibiotic administration and dietary sterilization (figure S3).

191
192

Dietary sterilization does not impact the fitness of D. chrysippus

193

We started our manipulative experiments with D. chrysippus, feeding larvae with surface sterilized C.

194

gigantea leaves. In our first experimental block (block 1) we found that larvae fed on sterile diet grew more

195

slowly than the control group and pupated ~48 hours later (figure 3A-C; GLM, model: fitness ~ treatment;

196

Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, p < 0.05; table S1). However, we did not observe any larval

197

mortality (table 1); and pupal weight, adult weight and time taken for eclosion (pupal span) remained

198

unaffected (figure 3D-F). To confirm that slow larval growth occurred due to bacterial elimination and not

199

due to toxicity from sterilizing chemicals, in two subsequent blocks (block 2 and block 3) we re-introduced

200

natural microflora on sterilized C. gigantea leaves (see methods), for a total of four treatment groups – 1)

201

non-sterile (untreated) leaves 2) sterile leaves, 3) sterile leaves with frass flora and 4) sterile leaves with

202

leaf flora. In block 2 and block 3, for most fitness measurements, we did not find significant differences

203

across treatments (figure 4 and figure S4; GLM model: fitness ~ treatment, Tukey’s post hoc test for

204

multiple comparisons, p > 0.05; table S1). However in a few cases, fitness of treated individuals (fed with

205

sterile leaves) was lower than control (fed with untreated leaves). For instance, adult weight in block 2

206

(figure 4, panel E) and larval span in block 3 (figure S4, panel B) were significantly affected in treated

207

individuals (GLM, model: fitness ~ treatment, Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, p <0.05).

208

However, these effects were neither consistent across blocks nor across fitness measurements (table S1).

209

Moreover, in these cases, there was no significant variation in fitness across treated individuals (fed with

210

sterile leaves) and individuals with re-introduced microbiota (figure 4 and S4, table S1). Adding bacteria

211

from frass or leaf surfaces also did not affect larval growth, except in one case (larval span, block 3, figure

212

S4, panel B). Similarly, larval mortality was not significantly different across treatment groups (Fisher’s

213

exact test, p>0.05, table 1). Together, these results show that feeding surface-sterilized diet to D. chrysippus

214

larvae had weak and variable impacts on host fitness.

215
216

Antibiotic treatment does not impact the fitness of D. chrysippus and A. merione

217

Though surface sterilization of diet effectively eliminates leaf surface microbes, it may not eliminate

218

bacteria that reside within plant tissues or on the egg casing (which is sometimes consumed by larvae; [47]).

219

To eliminate bacteria from these sources, we fed larvae of D. chrysippus and A. merione with a cocktail of

220

broad-spectrum antibiotics, and tested the impact on their growth. For both host species, we did not observe

221

a significant difference in fitness proxies across control (leaves + water) and treated (leaves + antibiotics)

222

individuals (figures 5 & 6; figures S5-S8; GLM, model: fitness ~ treatment, Tukey’s post hoc test for

223

multiple comparisons, p > 0.05; tables S2 & S3), except in a few cases (see figures 5,6,S5-S8 and tables S2

224

& S3). Again, the observed effect was neither consistent across different fitness measurements nor across

225

experimental blocks (see figures S5-S8 and tables S2 & S3). Fitness did not vary across individuals fed

226

with untreated leaves and leaves sprayed with water, except for two fitness measures (pupal and adult

227

weight) in block 2 for A. merione (figure S8, panels D and F, see table S3). However, for one of these

228

measurements (adult weight), fitness was not significantly different across leaves sprayed with water and

229

leaves sprayed with antibiotics (see table S3), again suggesting that bacterial elimination does not affect

230

host fitness strongly. Finally, we did not find a significant difference in larval mortality across control and

231

antibiotic treated groups (Fisher’s exact test, p>0.05, Table 1), except in A. merione block 3 (p<0.05).

232

However, mortality was only observed in larvae that were fed with high dose of antibiotics but not with a

233

low dose (table1), suggesting that larval death was not consistently associated with antibiotic treatment (and

234

its impact on the larval microbiome).

235
236

Overall, we observed that neither dietary sterilization nor antibiotic treatment affected the development and

237

survival of butterfly larvae (summarized in tables 1 and 2). Notably, we observed that adult weight at

238

eclosion – an important predictor of reproductive fitness – was not affected by the reduction in bacterial

239

loads and disruption of gut bacterial communities. Together, these results suggest that gut bacterial

240

communities have generally weak and negligible impacts on the fitness of D. chrysippus and A. merione

241

larvae.

242
243

DISCUSSION

244
245

Associations with bacteria impact the fitness of many insects, suggesting that such relationships represent

246

a general phenomenon [1]. Our study contradicts this general pattern, showing that various aspects of

247

butterfly fitness (early growth and survival) are not affected despite a substantial disturbance and reduction

248

in their gut microbial communities. An extensive review on insect-microbe interactions [1] reports

249

numerous cases where microbes significantly impacted insect fitness, with only two cases where microbes

250

had no negative impact on their insect hosts. In this context, our study is one of very few experimental

251

reports showing that some insects do not depend on their gut microbes (also see a recent report on neutrally

252

assembled microbiomes in dragonflies [48]. In conjunction with recent work [13,14] on butterfly-associated

253

bacterial communities (discussed in the Introduction), our experiments strongly support the idea that

254

butterflies have not established key bacterial mutualisms during their evolution. As suggested previously,

255

this lack of host-bacterial mutualism may arise because butterfly gut morphology and physiology may

256

prevent the growth and establishment of microbes [14]. Additionally, butterflies may have evolved a highly

257

efficient and diverse set of digestive enzymes in conjunction with dietary diversification, allowing larvae

258

to digest diverse host plants without relying on their gut microbes [49]. Finally, butterflies might have

259

evolved microbe-independent mechanisms to deal with the challenges of detoxifying poisonous plants. For

260

instance, D. chrysippus has evolved resistance to cardiac glycosides found in milkweeds, via mutations in

261

the Na+/K+ pump [50], potentially weakening any selection favoring detoxification by gut bacteria.

262

However, the relative timescales for the evolution of such host-specific, microbe-independent mechanisms

263

is not clear. It is also possible that butterflies have evolved functional associations with microbes in a

264

different, non-dietary context. For instance, butterfly gut bacteria may play an important role in butterfly

265

immune function, as observed in a few other insects [1,51,52]. Alternatively, as demonstrated earlier in

266

diamondback moths, gut bacteria could assist in insecticide resistance [10]. More generally, it is also

267

possible that dependence on the microbiome may have evolved in the context of environmental fluctuations

268

(which would be dampened in greenhouse and laboratory experiments such as ours), or for adult foraging,

269

fecundity and lifespan (which we could not measure here). Nonetheless, our results pose interesting open

270

questions: how did butterflies occupy vastly different dietary niches without recourse to bacterial

271

mutualists, in contrast to the predominant dependence on microbes observed in other insects with similarly

272

diverse diets?

273
274

In conclusion, we suggest that the impact of gut microbes on their hosts may range along a continuum from

275

strong to weak dependence or no association. To predict the impact of gut bacteria on insect diversification

276

and evolution, it is important to know how different insects are distributed across this spectrum. Current

277

literature largely represents only one end of the scale, where gut microbes seem to strongly affect their

278

hosts. In this context, our study on wild butterflies presents an interesting contrast to the general trend. It

279

may be interesting to experimentally explore the trends revealed by our work in natural populations of a

280

larger number of butterfly species with contrasting life histories. Hopefully, we can then begin to understand

281

why some insects depend on gut microbes for survival whereas others remain unaffected.

Figure 2 - Effect of antibiotic treatment and dietary sterilization on bacterial communities of D.
chrysippus and A. merione larvae. Panels (A1-C1): Stacked bar plots show the mean relative abundance
of the five most abundant bacterial taxa (OTUs, identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible) in each
treatment group (see supplementary methods). Panels (A2-C2): Boxplots (median with quartiles; whiskers
show data range) show the relative abundance of reads assigned to chloroplasts and mitochondria
(combined) in control and treated larvae. Panels (A3-C3): Principle component analysis (PCA) of full
bacterial communities from control and treated larvae. Axes show the first two principle components (PC)
that explain maximum variation in the data; values in parenthesis show the percent variation explained by
each PC. For microbiome analysis, we used D. chrysippus larvae from block 2 (dietary sterilization) and
block 3 (antibiotic treatment), and A. merione larvae from block 1 (antibiotic treatment) (see supplementary
tables S1-S3 and figures 4-6).

We tested for pairwise differences between survival of control (untreated leaves or leaves + water) and
treatment groups separately for each block using a Fisher’s exact test. DC and AM represent D. chrysippus
and A. merione respectively. The only significant difference was found in A. merione block 3 (p=0.02*),
where mortality in (Leaves + Water) < (Leaves +High Dose antibiotic).
