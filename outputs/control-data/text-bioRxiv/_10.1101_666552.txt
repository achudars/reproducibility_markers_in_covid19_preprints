Abstract
In the cell, proteins are synthesized from N- to C-terminus and begin to fold during
translation. Co-translational folding mechanisms are therefore linked to elongation rate, which
varies as a function of synonymous codon usage. However, synonymous codon substitutions
can affect many distinct cellular processes, which has complicated attempts to deconvolve the
extent to which synonymous codon usage can promote or frustrate proper protein folding in
vivo. Although previous studies have shown that some synonymous changes can lead to
different final structures, other substitutions will likely be more subtle, perturbing predominantly
the protein folding pathway without radically altering the final structure. Here we show that
synonymous codon substitutions encoding a single essential enzyme lead to dramatically
slower cell growth. These mutations do not prevent active enzyme formation; instead, they
predominantly alter the protein folding mechanism, leading to enhanced degradation in vivo.
These results support a model where synonymous codon substitutions can impair cell fitness by
significantly perturbing co-translational protein folding mechanisms, despite the chaperoning
provided by the cellular protein homeostasis network.
Significance
Many proteins that are incapable of refolding in vitro nevertheless fold efficiently to their
native state in the cell. This suggests that more information than the amino acid sequence is
required to properly fold these proteins. Here we show that synonymous mRNA mutations can
alter a protein folding mechanism in vivo, leading to changes in cellular fitness. This work
demonstrates that synonymous codon selection can play an important role in supporting
efficient protein production in vivo.

Introduction
Synonymous codon substitutions alter the mRNA coding sequence but preserve the
encoded amino acid sequence. For this reason, these substitutions were historically considered
to be phenotypically silent and often disregarded in studies of human genetic variation (1, 2). In
recent years, however, it has become clear that synonymous substitutions can significantly alter
protein function in vivo through a wide variety of mechanisms that can change protein level (35), translational accuracy (6, 7), secretion efficiency (8, 9), the final folded structure (1, 10-12)
and post-translational modifications (13). The full range of synonymous codon effects on protein
production is, however, still emerging and much remains to be learned regarding the precise
mechanisms that regulate these effects.
One effect of synonymous codon substitutions long proposed but with scant evidence to
support its significance in vivo is perturbations to co-translational folding mechanisms. In
general, rare synonymous codons tend to be translated more slowly than their common
counterparts (14-17). Moreover, rare synonymous codons tend to appear in clusters, creating
broader patterns of codon usage (18), many of which are conserved through evolution (19-21).
The folding rates of many protein secondary and tertiary structural elements are similar to their
rate of synthesis (22, 23), lending conceptual support to the hypothesis that even subtle
changes in elongation rate could alter folding mechanisms (24). In theory, reducing the rate of
translation elongation by synonymous common-to-rare codon substitutions could provide the Nterminal portion of a nascent protein with more time to adopt a stable tertiary structure before Cterminal portions are synthesized and emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel (25-27). Depending
on the specific native structure of the encoded protein, such extra time could be either
advantageous or detrimental to efficient folding (28). However, cells contain an extensive
network of molecular chaperones to facilitate the folding of challenging protein structures,
including several that associate with nascent polypeptide chains during translation (29-33).
Thus, it remains unclear whether a synonymous codon-derived alteration to elongation rate and
co-translational folding mechanism could be sufficiently perturbative to rise above the buffering
provided by the cellular chaperone network.
Here we show that synonymous codon changes in the coding sequence of an enzyme
essential for E. coli growth can have a dramatic impact on cell growth. We tested a variety of
mechanistic origins for this growth defect, including changes to the folded protein structure,
expression level, enzymatic activity, mRNA abundance and/or activation of a cell stress
response. Our results are consistent with synonymous substitutions altering the pattern of
translation elongation, which alters the co-translational folding mechanism and leads to the
formation of a folded, active structure that is more susceptible to degradation. These results
demonstrate that changes to synonymous codon usage can significantly affect protein folding in
vivo, rising above the chaperoning capacity provided by the cellular protein homeostasis
network. Synonymous codon usage may therefore have broad implications for effective protein
design and the interpretation of disease-associated synonymous mutations.
Results
Synonymous codon substitutions impair E. coli growth rate
To develop a system to test connections between synonymous codon usage, cotranslational folding and cell fitness, we used chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), a watersoluble, homotrimeric E. coli enzyme with a complex tertiary structure (34) (Fig. 1). A landmark
early study showed that synonymous codon substitutions near the middle of the coding

sequence (Fig. 2a, S1) led to lower specific activity for CAT synthesized by in vitro translation
(11). CAT is essential for E. coli growth in the presence of chloramphenicol (cam) (35), which
enabled us to use growth rate with cam as a convenient fitness assay. Furthermore, because
CAT is not part of an operon or regulatory network, we hypothesized that it would be unlikely for
feedback regulation of other genes to mask the effects of CAT synonymous codon changes on
enzyme function (36). Crucially, although CAT cannot be refolded to its native structure after
dilution from chemical denaturants, the native structure is resistant to unfolding up to 80ºC (Fig.
S2), suggesting that folding intermediates populated during and after protein synthesis are
crucial for efficient folding, as once the native structure has been attained it is not likely to
populate the unfolded state over a typical bacterial lifespan.
We transformed E. coli with a plasmid encoding the previously described synonymous
CAT coding sequence variant (11) under a titratable promoter but detected no discernable
difference in growth versus E. coli producing CAT from the wild type (WT) coding sequence
(Fig. 2b, S3a). However, compared to WT-CAT, this synonymous construct contains a larger
number of common codons (Fig. 2a), which leads to increased protein accumulation due to an
overall faster translation elongation rate (11, 16, 25). Consistent with this, we detected more
CAT in E. coli transformed with this coding sequence enriched in common codons (Fig. 2c). We
hypothesized that this higher intracellular CAT concentration could mask a defect in specific
activity. To test this, we used a Monte Carlo simulation method (18, 37) (see Supplemental
Methods) to design and select an alternative synonymous CAT coding sequence, Shuf1. In
Shuf1, the local synonymous codon usage patterns are very different from the WT coding
sequence but the global codon usage frequencies are very similar (Fig. 2a, S1), which we
predicted would lead to the synthesis of a WT-like amount of CAT. To avoid known effects of 5’
synonymous codon substitutions on translation initiation (5, 38-41), the first 46 codons of Shuf1
are identical to the WT coding sequence. Consistent with our prediction, E. coli produced CAT
from the Shuf1 coding sequence at levels indistinguishable from WT-CAT (Fig. 2c). However,
cells expressing Shuf1-CAT grew more slowly than cells expressing WT-CAT (Fig. S3a).
We hypothesized that we could further exacerbate the observed Shuf1-CAT growth
defect by adapting a strategy developed by Hilvert and coworkers to couple subtle changes in
enzyme function to E. coli growth rate (42). This strategy involves encoding a ClpXP recognition
tag (ssrA) at the C-terminus of the protein of interest, selectively enhancing its degradation by
the E. coli AAA+ protease ClpXP and leading to correspondingly lower intracellular protein
concentrations. Addition of the ssrA tag did not affect CAT structure, stability or specific activity
(Fig. S3b-d) but did lead to a dramatic growth defect for E. coli expressing Shuf1-CAT, versus
ssrA-tagged WT-CAT, in the presence of cam (Fig. 2b). This defect also led to a lower minimum
inhibitory concentration for E. coli expressing Shuf1- versus WT-CAT (Fig. S3e).
Neither the Shuf1-CAT mRNA nor protein is inherently toxic
A major challenge of all in vivo experiments is discerning the precise origin of an
observed effect. For example, a recent study indicated that synonymous codon substitutions
can lead to toxicity at the mRNA level even in the absence of protein production (43). To test
whether production of the Shuf1-CATssrA mRNA and/or protein is inherently toxic, we
compared the growth of E. coli expressing WT or Shuf1-CATssrA in the absence of cam. These
growth curves were indistinguishable (Fig. 2d), indicating that the Shuf1 defect is specifically
related to impaired CAT enzyme function. Moreover, in the presence of cam the growth defect
was partially suppressed at higher inducer concentrations (Fig. 2b), contrary to the larger
growth defect expected if the Shuf1-CATssrA mRNA and/or protein were inherently toxic.

To test whether Shuf1-CAT expression induces a general cell stress response, we used
mass spectrometry to compare the abundances of 1277 proteins in E. coli expressing ssrAtagged CAT from either the WT or Shuf1 coding sequence. There was no significant difference
detected in the level of most proteins, including known stress-associated molecular chaperones
and proteases (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results support a model where the Shuf1-CAT
growth defect is due to a direct defect in active CAT protein production, rather than an indirect
effect on other cell functions.
Shuf1 coding sequence does not adversely affect mRNA concentration
We noticed that addition of the ssrA tag led to a larger reduction in intracellular
accumulation for CAT produced from the Shuf1 versus WT coding sequence (Fig. 2c, hatched
bars). To determine whether this decrease in Shuf1-CAT was due to a defect arising from Shuf1
transcription and/or mRNA half-life, versus a translation-related defect, we quantified the levels
of WT and Shuf1 mRNA. These levels were indistinguishable (Fig. S4a). Together with the
indistinguishable levels of WT- and Shuf1-CAT protein accumulation in the absence of the ssrA
tag (Fig. 2c, filled bars), these results suggest a model where the Shuf1 synonymous codon
changes affect intracellular CAT concentration at the translational level, likely due to a greater
susceptibility of the Shuf1-CAT protein to degradation (Fig. 4).
ClpX deletion indicates ClpXP is major source of Shuf1-CATssrA growth defect
If the Shuf1 codon-dependent growth defect is due to more efficient degradation of ssrAtagged Shuf1-CAT by cellular proteases, specifically ClpXP, deleting ClpX would be expected to
ameliorate the growth defect in vivo. ClpXP is the major E. coli protease responsible for
degrading ssrA-tagged polypeptides under log-phase growth (44, 45). In general, less stablyfolded proteins are more susceptible to degradation by ClpXP than more stable substrates (4648), presumably because less energy is required for ClpX to unfold unstable protein structures
and expose the polypeptide chains to the ClpP protease active sites (49). To test whether
ClpXP degradation is the key mechanism impairing growth when E. coli expresses CAT from
the Shuf1 coding sequence, we induced expression of WT and Shuf1 CAT in an E. coli W3110
derivative that lacks ClpX (46, 50) and compared growth in this background to the parent strain
W3110, in the presence of cam. ClpX deletion enhanced growth only of cells expressing ssrAtagged CAT from the Shuf1 coding sequence (Fig. 5a). Likewise, omission of the ssrA tag
enhanced growth only for E. coli expressing ClpX; there was no effect on cells lacking ClpX
(Fig. 5b). These results confirm that the major effect of the Shuf1 synonymous codon
substitutions is enhanced degradation of ssrA-tagged CAT by ClpXP.
Native WT- and Shuf1-CAT proteins are subtly different
Synonymous codon substitutions can lead to a wide range of effects on the encoded
protein, including changes to translational fidelity (decoding accuracy) (6) and the native
structure (1, 10, 12, 17). As a next test of the mechanism by which Shuf1 codon changes alter
cell growth rate, we compared the CAT proteins produced from the WT and Shuf1 coding
sequences. In both cases, CAT was detected only in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate (Fig.
S4b), indicating the Shuf1 growth defect is not due to CAT aggregation. Likewise, the
secondary and tertiary structure (Fig. S4c), resistance to chemical and thermal denaturation
(Fig. 5c, S4d) and specific activity (Fig. 5d) of purified CAT produced from the Shuf1 mRNA
sequence were indistinguishable from CAT translated from the WT coding sequence. We also
used mass spectrometry to compare the molecular weights of CAT translated from these coding
sequences. These masses were indistinguishable to within one mass unit and matched the

expected molecular weight of 25,953 Da. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CAT
production from the Shuf1 coding sequence does not prohibit formation of a stable, active CAT
protein structure.
Despite the native CAT structural similarities reported above, it is important to note that
digestion by ClpXP requires force-mediated unfolding of a substrate protein from its C-terminus,
driven by ATP hydrolysis (51-53). Resistance to mechanical force reports on a distinct aspect of
protein stability from resistance to chemical or thermal denaturation (54-57). To directly test
whether the Shuf1 synonymous codon substitutions lead to a native CAT structure that is more
susceptible to force-mediated unfolding and degradation, we subjected native, purified ssrAtagged CAT produced in vivo from the WT or Shuf1 coding sequences to an in vitro ClpXP
degradation assay (44, 58). Although both proteins exhibit resistance to ClpXP degradation,
CAT synthesized from the Shuf1 coding sequence was degraded more rapidly than WT-CAT
(Fig. 5e, S5), in direct contrast to the indistinguishable behavior observed in our other analyses
(above). This result demonstrates that CAT produced from the Shuf1 mRNA sequence is more
susceptible to degradation by ClpXP, perhaps both prior to as well as after acquiring its native
structure. Crucially, the differential susceptibility to ClpXP degradation provides direct evidence
of the impact of the Shuf1 codon substitutions on CAT folding, as proteins with identical amino
acid sequences would arrive at different native structures only via distinct folding mechanisms.
Because the ssrA tag is located at the CAT C-terminus, we expect that degradation by ClpXP is
predominantly post-translational, occurring after release of the nascent chain from the ribosome.
mRNA secondary structural stability does not explain Shuf1 growth defect
The results above suggest the Shuf1 synonymous codon substitutions impair CAT cotranslational folding by altering local patterns of translation elongation. In vitro, synonymous
codons have been shown to alter elongation rate either by altering the rate of decoding (59) or
by altering downstream mRNA stability, which can impede ribosome translocation (60). In vivo,
there is some evidence that stable mRNA stem-loop structures can alter the elongation rate of
the ribosome (61-63), although other studies have detected no difference (38, 64, 65), likely due
to destabilization of mRNA structure by polysomes and/or the helicase activity of the ribosome.
Although the overall predicted mRNA stability of the WT and Shuf1 genes are similar, a
predicted stable 3’ stem-loop structure in Shuf1 is not present in the WT coding sequence (Fig.
S6a). To test whether this structure is responsible for the Shuf1 growth defect, we created
chimeric mRNA sequences with only the 5’, middle or 3’ portion of the wild type sequence
substituted with the Shuf1 sequence (Fig. S6b) but observed no growth defect for the chimera
bearing the 3’ portion of Shuf1 had no impact on growth rate (Fig. S6c). Moreover, growth rates
for these chimeras correlated more closely with the difference in relative codon usage
frequencies than measures of mRNA stability (Fig. S6d). Taken together, these results indicate
that translation elongation rate differences arising from changes in codon usage frequencies is a
more likely origin of the Shuf1 growth defect than changes in mRNA secondary structure.
Discussion
Most of our current understanding of protein folding mechanisms is derived from studies
of small proteins that refold reversibly when diluted from chemical denaturants. However, only a
small number of proteins can refold robustly in vitro, even though many more can be maintained
in a stable state once extracted from the cell (24, 66, 67). This suggests that (i) the
conformations adopted early during the folding process are crucial to successful folding and (ii)
the cellular environment supports the formation of early folding intermediates that are distinct
from the conformations populated upon dilution from denaturant. Indeed, there is substantial

evidence that molecular chaperones are crucial to the successful folding of many complex
proteins in vivo (29-33). Although it has been hypothesized that synonymous codon changes
could alter elongation rate and modify folding mechanisms in vivo, it has thus far been
challenging to find evidence to support this hypothesis from experiments performed in vivo,
possibly due to buffering provided by molecular chaperones.
Results presented here indicate that, during synthesis, the folding of nascent CAT
polypeptide chains is sensitive to synonymous codon-induced changes to translation elongation
rate. Although the nascent chains produced using different synonymous codon patterns remain
broadly capable of achieving a stable, active CAT trimer structure, translation using the
synonymous Shuf1 mRNA sequence leads to CAT proteins that are more susceptible to
degradation by the cellular protease ClpXP than WT-CAT, leading to a dramatic cell growth
defect. Given that the ClpXP ssrA degradation tag is attached to the very C-terminus of CAT, it
is likely that the majority of this digestion occurs only post-translationally, after the CAT nascent
chain is released from the ribosome (Fig. 4). Remarkably, even native Shuf1-CATssrA protein is
more susceptible to degradation than native CATssrA translated using the WT coding
sequence, demonstrating that the impact of the codon-induced perturbations persists long after
translation and folding is complete. Buffering by the cellular protein homeostasis network is
therefore not sufficient to mask the impact of the Shuf1-CAT folding defect on cell growth.
These results are consistent with a small but growing number of studies indicating that
synonymous codon substitutions can perturb protein folding mechanisms (1, 10, 12, 68). The
ssrA tagging approach developed here provides a general strategy to uncover such
perturbations in other coding sequences, even when they do not lead to dramatic remodeling of
the final protein structure. In contrast to the translation rate-sensitive effects we observed for
CAT folding, recent in vitro single molecule force-unfolding experiments have shown that some
small, ribosome-bound natively-folded domains can fold via similar mechanisms on and off the
ribosome (69, 70). However, as these studies noted, forced unfolding measured by molecular
tweezers cannot capture the transient folding of a nascent chain during its synthesis (33), and
hence what is measured in these experiments is the effect of close proximity of the ribosome
surface, rather than co-translational folding. The very robust folding behavior of these wellcharacterized, reversible folding models may indeed lead to indistinguishable folding behavior
during translation, a model supported by recent force-feedback folding measurements (71).
However, the model proteins selected for these studies are smaller than >75% of proteins in the
E. coli proteome (24), whereas all known examples of synonymous codon-derived alterations to
co-translational folding are much larger (e.g., (1, 9, 10, 72)). We are not aware of an in vitro
folding mechanism for a protein >175 aa long that is preserved during co-translational folding.
Synonymous codon-derived modulation of elongation rate may therefore play a broad role in the
efficient folding of larger, more complex proteins.
Our CAT results demonstrate that synonymous changes to mRNA coding sequences
can significantly perturb folding of the wild type protein sequence even in the presence of the
cellular repertoire of molecular chaperones. This result suggests that mRNA sequences have
likely evolved alongside molecular chaperones to most efficiently support folding of the broad
repertoire of protein structures produced in vivo. Although our understanding of co-translational
folding mechanisms is still in its infancy, these results imply that it should ultimately be possible
to rationally design mRNA coding sequences to enhance in vivo folding yield and to identify
disease-associated synonymous codon substitutions most likely to adversely affect protein cotranslational folding, particularly for large or otherwise complex proteins.

Methods
Cell growth assays
A single colony of E. coli KA12 (73) or W3110 (50) transformed with a pKT-CAT plasmid
from a freshly streaked LB-amp plate was used to inoculate 20 mL of LB plus 100 μg/mL
ampicillin (LB-amp) and grown overnight with shaking at 37°C. Unless otherwise specified, all
cultures contained 100 μg/mL ampicillin and no tetracycline. Overnight cultures were used to
innoculate fresh LB-amp to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.05, to which was added 35
μg/mL chloramphenicol (unless otherwise specified) and the indicated concentration of
tetracycline inducer (0-1600 ng/mL), transferred to one well of a 12-well plate and incubated at
37°C with continuous shaking in a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). Growth was
measured as the increase in OD600. The linear portion of the growth curve was fit to a straight
line and the slope was taken as the growth rate.

Figure 4. Proposed model for the effects of synonymous CAT codon substitutions on ssrAtagged CAT folding and cell fitness. Synonymous changes in the Shuf1 coding sequence alter
the local rate of translation, affecting the conformation of CAT co-translationally and persisting
after release of the nascent protein from the ribosome. These altered Shuf1 folding
intermediates are more susceptible to degradation by ClpXP than intermediates populated
during and after translation of the WT coding sequence. Some Shuf1-CATssrA proteins evade
degradation and eventually fold to an active conformation that is also more susceptible to
degradation than WT-CATssrA.

Supplemental Methods
Synonymous CAT coding sequence design
The Shuf1 synonymous mutant sequence was designed using a Monte Carlo algorithm.
The first 46 codons (excluding the His tag) were left unchanged to avoid altering translation
initiation (5, 38-41). For remaining amino acid positions, a synonymous codon was chosen at
random. After each random sequence was designed, its codon usage frequencies were
analyzed using the %MinMax algorithm (18, 37), which compares the codon usage frequency of
a coding sequence to hypothetical sequences that encode the identical amino acid sequence
using either the most common (+100%) or most rare (-100%) codons possible. This simple
algorithm has been shown to accurately predict the relative effects of synonymous codon
changes on elongation rate (10, 19). The %MinMax codon usage profile of each synonymous
sequence was compared to the WT profile. Profiles were filtered to select those with the same
number of 17-codon windows of rarer-than-average codon usage, a sequence-wide average
codon usage very similar to the wild type mRNA sequence (%MinMax within +/- 3% of WT), and
likewise very similar extreme codon usage values (maximum and minimum %MinMax values
within +/- 5% of WT). Out of one million sequences generated, three fulfilled these criteria. The
coding sequence with the lowest Pearson correlation coefficient compared to WT was chosen
as Shuf1.
Molecular biology
All CAT constructs were synthesized by GeneArt (Invitrogen). The pKT and pKTS
plasmids were a generous gift from Donald Hilvert (ETH, Zurich). CAT constructs were cloned
into pKT and pKTS using FastCloning (74). All primers were ordered from IDT as standard
desalting primers and resuspended to 1 mg/mL in ddH2O. pKT and pKTS were amplified using
primers pKT F (ACTAGTGCGGCCGCTTGATAAA) and pKT R (ATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAA
AGTTAAACAAAATTATTTCTAGAGGGAAA) and pKTS F (GCGGCGAACGATGAAAACTATG
C) and pKT R, respectively. The CAT F primer (AGAAGGAGATATACATATGCATCACC
ATCACCATCACCATAACTATACAAAATTTG) was used to amplify all CAT constructs. Unique
primers were required for the reverse direction. WT R pKT
(AAGCGGCCGCACTAGTTTATTTTAATTTA CTGTTACACAACTCTTGTAG) was used to clone
WT and the common variant of CAT (11) into pKT, WT R pKTS (TTTCA
TCGTTCGCCGCTTTTAATTTACTGTTACACAACTCTTGTAGCCGATTAATAAAGC) for pKTS,
Shuf1 R pKT (AAGCGGCCGCACTAGTTTACTTCAATTTAGAATTACATAACT CCTGTAAT)
was used to clone Shuf1 CAT into pKT, and Shuf1 R pKTS
(TTTCATCGTTCGCCGCCTTCAATTTAGAATTACATAACTCCT GTAATCTGTTAATGAAGC)
for pKTS.
To make the chimeric CAT constructs, the 5’, center or 3’ region of the Shuf1 coding
sequence were amplified and cloned into the WT CAT sequence. All hybrid CAT constructs
were cloned into pKTS. Primers were ordered from IDT as standard desalting primers. To make
the 5’ chimera, the WT plasmid was amplified using the primers WTsN F (GCTATCCTGCCCC
TATTCATCCGATATTGATCAATTTATGGTGAATTATTTATCGGT) and WTsN R (ATATCATCA
CGGGGTAAAACTTATACGCTGAATCATCCAATGACTTTTTTAACGTC) and codons 58-111 of
Shuf1 using the primers Shuf1 N F (TACCCCGTGATGATATACTTAATTGCCCA) and Shuf1 N
R (ATAGGGGCAGGATAGCGCAC). To make the middle chimera, the WT plasmid was
amplified using the primers WTsM F (TGACTATTTTGCGCCGATTATAACAATGGCAAAATAT
CAGCAAGAAGGG) and WTsM R (GATCGATGTCCGAGCTGTATGGGCAACTCAGTGCTGAA
AA) and codons 112-172 of Shuf1 using the primers Shuf1 M F (AGCTCGGACATCGATCAAT

TTATGG) and Shuf1 M R (CGGCGCAAAATAGTCAGTAAAGTTAGCTA). To make the 3’
chimera, the WT plasmid was amplified using the primers WTsC F (TAATTCTAAATTGAAGG
CGGCGAACGATGAAAACTATGC) and WTsC R (TGGCCATGGTTATGATGGGTGCAAAATA
ATCGGTAAAATTAGCAA) and codons 173-220 of Shuf1 using the primers Shuf1 C F (ATCAT
AACCATGGCCAAATACCAACAG) and Shuf1 C R (CTTCAATTTAGAATTACATAACTCCTGT
AATCTGTTAATGAAGC).
PCR reactions were prepared using 5 μL of supplied 10x PfuUltra II buffer (Agilent), 2.5
mM dNTPs (AMRESCO), 2 ng/μL of forward and reverse primer, 0-3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 ng/μL
DNA, and 1 μL PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent). The total reaction volume was
50 μL. The PCR protocol started with 2 min at 95°C followed by 18 cycles of: 95°C for 30 sec,
Tm-5°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2.5 min, then a final step of 72°C for 10 min.
PCR products were treated with 1 μL DpnI for 1.5 hours at 37°C. The insert and vector
were then mixed together in 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:1, and 4:1 ratios and 10 μL were incubated with 100
μL chemically competent E. coli DH5α for 30 min on ice. Cells were heat shocked at 42°C for 45
sec, incubated on ice for 2 min, and recovered at 37°C with 500 μL of SOC media (2% tryptone,
0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose)
for 1 hr. The entire transformation reaction was spread on an LB-agar plate with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Single colonies were grown in liquid culture and
DNA was extracted (Wizard Plus minipreps, Promega) using the manufacturer’s directions. The
entire gene along with its promoter and transcription terminator was sequenced.
CAT protein purification
To purify CAT for in vitro analyses, 1 L cultures were inoculated as above with 1600
ng/mL tetracycline. Cultures were grown at 37°C with continuous shaking for 6.5 hours. Cells
were pelleted at 4,000xg for 15 min and resuspended in nickel affinity binding buffer (500 mM
NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8). Cells were lysed by repeated cycles
of freezing at -80°C for 30 min followed by thawing at room temperature. Lysozyme (final
concentration 1 mg/mL) was added after the first freezing cycle. Thawed lysates were incubated
for 30 min at 4°C with frequent inversions to facilitate lysis. In total, cells were frozen and
thawed four times. After lysis, cells were homogenized with 25 mM MgCl2 and 80 μL DNase I
(Invitrogen). The lysates were again incubated at 4°C for 30 min with frequent inversions.
Alternatively, lysates were homogenized by sonication for 12 min using 30 sec on 30 sec off.
After lysis, the lysate was pelleted at 14,000xg for 15 min and CAT was purified from the
supernatant using nickel affinity chromatography (His Spin Trap (small volumes), HisTrap HP
(large volumes); GE Healthcare). After addition of the cell supernatant, columns were washed
with binding buffer and eluted with elution buffer (500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 20 mM
sodium phosphate pH 8). CAT protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm,
using a calculated CAT extinction coefficient of 30,350 (for His-CAT) or 31,630 M-1 cm-1 (for HisCAT-ssrA) (75).
Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy
Far-UV CD spectra were collected using a J-815 CD Spectropolarimeter (JASCO). CAT
protein samples were diluted to a concentration of 4 μM in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 8. Three
spectra were collected from 190-250 nm with a 1 second integration time and a 2 nm
bandwidth, averaged and from this an averaged spectrum of the blank buffer solution (collected
under identical conditions) was subtracted. The effect of increasing temperature on the far-UV
CD spectrum was recorded every 2°C from 4-95°C. Samples were equilibrated for 2 min at each

temperature prior to data collection. To normalize the spectra, the average signal prior to and
after the unfolding transition were set to 100% and 0% folded, respectively.
Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy
Purified CAT protein was diluted to 2 μM and incubated overnight in 100 mM Tris buffer
pH 7.5 with 0-4 M guanidinium HCl at 4°C. Tryptophan emission spectra were collected using a
PTI QM-6 fluorimeter (Birmingham, NJ). An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used (2 nm
slit widths) and emission was measured from 300-380 nm (4 nm slit widths; 3 sec integration
time). To normalize the spectra, the average fluorescence emission intensity prior to and after
the unfolding transition were set to 100% and 0% folded, respectively. The resulting curves
were then fit to a sigmoidal function.
Acetyltransferase activity assay
CAT enzymatic activity was measured as described previously (76). Briefly, CAT was
diluted to a concentration of 6.25 μg/mL in 1 mL of reaction mix (94 mM Tris pH 7.8, 83 μM
DTNB, 190 μM acetyl-CoA and 155 μM chloramphenicol). Free CoA-SH produced by the CAT
reaction subsequently reacts with DTNB to make TNB, which absorbs at 412 nm. Absorbance
at 412 nm was monitored for 5 min in a DU 530 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter).
To determine the specific activity from these curves, the initial velocity of the reaction was
calculated by fitting data points from 0.25-1 min to a straight line. The initial velocity was divided
by the extinction coefficient for TNB (0.0136 μM-1 cm-1) to convert to units of enzyme activity and
the amount of CAT to calculate activity in units per microgram. One unit of activity converts 1
nmol of chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA to chloramphenicol-3-acetate and CoA per min. The
average activity of WT His-CAT was set to 100%; results for other CAT proteins were
normalized to this value.
Mass spectrometry
The molecular weight of CAT was measured using HPLC-ESI-MS as described
previously (77, 78), with minor modifications. Briefly, purified CAT was diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 and 5 µg was injected per sample. A 20 min gradient
from 10-80% A-B (A: H2O, 0.1% formic acid; B: acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with the first 3 min
diverted to waste was performed. Positive mode electron spray ionization was acquired on a
micro TOF-QII (Bruker, Billerica, MA) mass spectrometer with 2 sec spectral averaging. The
MaxEnt software package (Bruker) was used for deconvolution. The deconvoluted mass
measured for each CAT variant was 25,953 Da, identical to the predicted mass.
E. coli expressing WT or Shuf1 His-CAT-ssrA were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 at 37°C in
LB with amp and induced with 1000 ng/mL tc for 3 hr. Cells (from 10 mL cultures) were pelleted
at 4,000xg for 15 min and stored at -80°C. Cell pellets were lysed using a bead mill (BioSpec
OK, USA) 3 x 30 sec in 1% SDS 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and clarified by
centrifugation at 12,000xg for 10 min. Whole cell protein lysates were quantified by BCA assay
(Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Whole cell lysates were prepared for proteomics as previously described (79), with minor
modifications. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise described. First, 50 µg of each
lysate was suspended in 5% SDS 100mM ABC and reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol
and iodoacetamide. Samples were then digested with trypsin using Strap columns (Protifi, NY)

according to manufacturer’s instructions, with the following alterations. Mass-spectrometry
grade trypsin (Promega, WI) was added at 1:40 (m/m) and digested overnight at 37°C. Peptides
were eluted from the digestion column and desalted using a 10 mg HLB SPE column (Waters,
MA) following the manufacturer’s recommended conditions. Desalted peptide digests were dried
and stored at -20°C until LC/MS/MS analysis.
Each digested sample (1 µg) was analyzed in triplicate using LC-MS/MS with a Waters
nanoUHPLC Acquity (Billerica, MA) and a Q-Exactive Oribitrap (Thermo, San Jose, CA). RAW
files from the Nano UHPLC-MS/MS acquisition were subjected to tandem spectral match and
quantification using label free quantification (80). The current KA12 E. coli proteome
(UP000000625) concatenated with the WT/Shuf1 His-CAT-ssrA sequences and common
contaminants was used to assign peptides. Data were normalized using median fold change.
Calculation of local mRNA secondary structure
A sliding window analysis was used to predict local stable structure in overlapping 30 ntlong segments of the CAT coding sequence, using the Quikfold algorithm to calculate the free
energy of mRNA folding (81). All predicted stable structures were plotted.
Correlation between growth and mRNA properties
Growth was calculated as the %WT OD600 after 4 hours of growth in cam. The change in
%MinMax was calculated by summing the absolute value of the differences between a given
construct and WT. This number was divided by the average %MinMax of the gene as a proxy
for protein production. The strongest local mRNA secondary structure element per gene was
calculated as above. These data were fit to a line using Prism.
Western blotting
Cultures were inoculated as described above and induced for 6.5 hours. Aliquots were
pelleted at 14,000xg for 15 min and the cell pellets were resuspended to an OD600 of 15 in 100
mM Tris pH 7.5. To this was added one half-volume of 3x SDS gel loading buffer and βmercaptoethanol (BME) to 5 mM. Samples were boiled for 40 min, separated using denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed using a
mouse anti-His antibody (Promega) and goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to
alkaline phosphatase. In some experiments, the 7x-His tag was replaced with an HA tag
(YPYDVPDYA) and the primary antibody used was rabbit α-HA (Sigma). Intensities of CAT
protein bands were quantified using ImageJ.
mRNA quantification
Cultures were inoculated as described above and grown for 2.5 hr until the cells
achieved an OD600 of about 0.3. RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to
manufacturer protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Purified
RNA was stored at -80°C.
RNA samples were treated with DNase to remove genomic DNA or plasmid
contaminants. To 10 μL of RNA (about 0.2 μg) 10 μL of DNase buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2.5
mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2) was added with 2 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion/Invitrogen).

Samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, then 1 μL of 100 mM EDTA was added and
samples were incubated at 65°C for 10 min to denature the DNase. Reverse transcription (RT)
was performed using the iScript RT kit (BioRad). RNA was diluted to about 100 ng/μL into RT
reaction mix (20 μL total, 4 μL 5x buffer, 2 μL random hexamer primers, 1 μL reverse
transcriptase). Control reactions lacking RT were used to ensure the PCR amplification was
specific for mRNA. To perform the RT, the following protocol was used on a MyCycler (BioRad):
5 min at 25°C, 30 min at 42°C, 5 min at 85°C. The resulting cDNA was diluted fivefold for
quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a 96 well plate using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection
System (BioRad). The reaction volume was 5 μL and included 1 μL of cDNA, 60 nM primers
(IDT) and 2.5 μL SsoAdvanced SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). To amplify all CAT constructs
the primers CAT qPCR F (CCATCACCATAACTATACAAAATTTGATGTAAAAAATT) and CAT
qPCR R (AAACTTATACGCTGAATCATCCAATGA) were used. To amplify E. coli GAPDH, the
primers GAPDH qPCR F (CGGTACCGTTGAAGTGAAAGAC) and GAPDH qPCR R
(ACCAGTTGCTTCAGCGAC) were used. ΔCT values were calculated by taking the difference in
CT values for each CAT construct with its corresponding GAPDH CT. ΔΔCT values were
calculated by taking the difference in ΔCT from WT CAT. This was converted to fold change in
RNA level by raising 2 to the power of –ΔΔCT.
Growth rate as function of induction time
Cultures were inoculated as described above in 20 mL of LB with amp and grown in
shake flasks at 37°C. Cultures were grown to an OD600 of ~0.35 at 37°C and induced with 1600
ng/mL tc. Cells were induced from 0-60 min. Then a 1 mL aliquot was pelleted at 21,000xg for 5
min and resuspended in LB with amp and cam. These were diluted twofold into a 24 well plate.
Growth was monitored with double orbital shaking for 5 hours. Growth from 1-3 hours after
chloramphenicol addition was fit to a line and the slope was used as the growth rate. Growth
rates were normalized to the average growth rate of both constructs after 60 min induction.
ClpX knockout effect on growth
The ClpX knockout was in the E. coli W3110 background. Knockout and parent strain
were cultured as described above. These strains were induced with 50 ng/mL tc. The effect of
ClpX or ssrA tag on growth was calculated by dividing the endpoint OD600. No effect of deletion
would render a value of 1.
Contact maps
Contact maps were generated using VMD software support and the crystal structure of
CATIII (PDBID: 3CLA) (34). VMD was developed with by the Theoretical and Computational
Biophysics group at the Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
ClpXP degradation assay
ClpXDN3 or ClpP were overexpressed in E. coli and purified using Ni2+ affinity and size
exclusion chromatography, as described previously (82). ClpXP degradation were performed in
PD buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mM BME at
30°C. CATssrA purified as above (2 µM) was incubated with 300 nM ClpX6 (as 600 nM
ClpXDN3), 900 nM ClpP14, 5 mM ATP (Sigma), 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (CPK,
Sigma), and 1.6 mM creatine phosphate (Sigma). At indicated timepoints, an aliquot of the
degradation reaction mix was removed and combined with SDS-PAGE loading dye. The
degradation reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE.
