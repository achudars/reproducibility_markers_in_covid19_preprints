Abstract
As the first step towards the evolution of selfing from obligate outcrossing, identifying the key mutations
underlying the loss of self-incompatibility is of particular interest. However, our current knowledge is
primarily based on sequence-based comparisons between selfing species and their self-incompatible
relatives, which makes it hard to distinguish causal from secondary mutations. To by-pass this problem,
we inferred the genetic basis of the loss of self-incompatibility by intercrossing plants from twelve
geographically interspersed outcrossing and selfing populations of North-American Arabidopsis lyrata
and determining the breeding system of 1,580 progeny. Self-incompatibility was not restored after crosses
between different self-compatible populations. Equal frequencies of self-compatible and selfincompatible progeny emerged from crosses between parents with different breeding systems. We
propose a two-locus genetic model for the loss of self-incompatibility in which specific S-locus
haplotypes (S1 and S19) are associated with loss of self-incompatibility through their interaction with an
unlinked modifier.

Introduction
To avoid the negative consequences of self-fertilization, about half of the angiosperms have some form of
self-incompatibility1, 2. For example, Brassicaceae have a sporophytic self-incompatibility system, which
renders plants self-incompatible through recognition and rejection of self-pollen. Two tightly linked
recognition genes (the “female” gene S-locus Receptor Kinase – SRK, and the “male” gene S-locus
Cystein Rich – SCR) encode stigma- and pollen proteins respectively, together forming what is commonly
referred to as the S-locus. If stigma- and pollen proteins have matching specificities (as would be the case
with self-pollination), pollen tubes cannot grow and preclude fertilization3,

4, 5

. Self-incompatibility

frequently breaks down6, 7, and many extant self-compatible and selfing species have evolved from selfincompatible ancestors8,

9, 10, 11, 12

. Since the loss of self-incompatibility is the first step towards the

evolution of selfing, it is of particular interest to understand its underlying genetic basis.
Given the pivotal role of self-recognition in self-incompatibility, a loss-of-function mutation at
the S-locus could represent the primary cause of the loss of self-incompatibility. However, mutations at
any of the other genes (unlinked to the S-locus) involved in modifying self-recognition or encoding
downstream components would also render plants self-compatible13. Direct evidence for a primary role of
the S-locus was obtained by a gain-of-function study that transferred a functional S-locus from
Arabidopsis lyrata into A. thaliana, which led to complete restoration of self-incompatibility in a few
accessions14,

15, 16

. In other accessions, transformation had no effect or only led to transient self-

incompatibility, indicating that these accessions must have carried loss-of-function mutations both at the
S-locus and for additional genetic elements required for functional self-incompatibility15. This makes it
impossible to distinguish primary from secondary mutations, because after the initial loss of selfincompatibility, relaxed selection is expected to cause pseudogenization of any locus with an exclusive
function in self-incompatibility. Therefore, the finding that extant selfing species with a fully developed
selfing syndrome tend to have a non-functional S-locus (e.g., Capsella rubella17); and A. thaliana18 does
not necessarily provide evidence that mutations at the S-locus caused the loss of self-incompatibility. The

likelihood of secondary mutations obviously increases with divergence time, which makes study systems
with more recent transitions to self-compatibility more suitable to identify the mutations underlying the
transitions.
Here, we make use of the intraspecific breeding- and mating system variation in North American
A. lyrata. Since only a few A. lyrata populations have lost self-incompatibility and transitioned to high
selfing rates19,

20

, without evolution of a selfing syndrome21 or purging of genetic load22,

23

, self-

compatibility and selfing are likely of relatively recent origin. Joint clustering of selfing and outcrossing
populations in multiple genetic backgrounds20 and an association of self-compatibility with homozygosity
for two different S-haplotypes, S1 and S1924, have provided indirect evidence for multiple origins of selfing
in this species. However, direct evidence is still lacking, and it is unknown whether there is a functional
link between the S1 and S19 haplotypes and self-compatibility. Absence of non-synonymous mutations in
SRK and SCR for haplotype S1 in selfing populations25 suggests that loss-of-function mutations at selfrecognition genes cannot explain the loss of self-incompatibility. Based on segregation patterns in an F2
family derived from a single cross between a self-incompatible plant and a self-compatible S1S1 plant, it
was hypothesized that a recessive modifier-locus unlinked to the S-locus causes self-compatibility in S1homozygotes of A. lyrata24. However, besides the single cross, there is still little empirical data to support
this “modifier-hypothesis”. Moreover, it has remained unclear whether the putative modifier is specific to
S1, or could also explain self-compatibility in backgrounds with other S-haplotypes such as S19.
To address this, we did intra- and inter-population crosses using self-incompatible plants from six
predominantly outcrossing populations and self-compatible plants from six predominantly selfing
populations of North-American A. lyrata. First, we tested whether self-incompatibility was restored in
progeny resulting from crosses between self-compatible parents from different selfing populations
through genetic complementation. This would be expected if two different recessive loss-of-function
mutations caused the loss of self-incompatibility in different selfing populations. Second, we tested
whether progeny resulting from crosses between parents with different breeding systems were always SI

through functional dominance. This would be expected if a loss-of-function mutation underlies selfcompatibility. Alternatively, mixtures of self-incompatible and self-compatible progeny would indicate a
multigenic genetic basis of self-compatibility, for example through interaction of S-haplotypes and
unlinked modifiers, such as proposed for the S1-haplotype24. Crosses within and between outcrossing
populations served as controls for crosses between breeding systems, and also to test the prediction of the
modifier-hypothesis that crosses between self-incompatible partners can give rise to a low frequency of
self-compatible progeny, matching previous observations of a low frequency of self-compatible
individuals in otherwise self-incompatible populations24.

Material and methods

Source plant material and crossing design
To study the inheritance of self-compatibility, we used seed material from 12 North American
Arabidopsis lyrata populations (kindly provided by Barbara Mable, University of Glasgow) with
contrasting breeding- and mating systems. According to genotyping of progeny arrays and selfpollinations for these 12 populations (Table S1), six populations (hereafter SI populations) mainly consist
of self-incompatible (SI) plants, and have multi-locus outcrossing rates over 80%. The remaining six
populations (hereafter SC populations, either S19S19 homozygotes or S1S1 homozygotes) have high
frequencies of self-compatible (SC) plants (four populations 100%, one 88% and one 50%), and much
lower outcrossing rates (five of them less than 30%, one population [TSSA] 41%; see Table S1)20, 24.
In March 2013, to test whether self-incompatibility could be restored through complementation,
we randomly selected 18 focal plants (three plants labelled A, B and C from each of the six SC
populations; Fig. 1). We used the selected parental “SC” plants to produce progeny through betweenpopulation crosses (BP♀SC × ♂SC) among all plants labelled A, and the same for all plants labelled B and C.
As controls, we made crosses within SC populations (WP♀SC × ♂SC) among the A, B and C plants,

respectively. To test whether self-compatibility as a trait behaves recessively, we also randomly selected
18 focal plants (three plants labelled A, B and C from each of the six SI populations; Fig. 1). We used
these to produce progeny through crosses between breeding systems (BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI)
among all plants labelled A, and the same for the plants labelled B, and C. As controls for SI populations,
we made crosses within SI populations (WP♀SI × ♂SI) among the A, B and C plants. To test whether SC
plants can arise when crossing more distantly related SI plants, we also made crosses between SI
populations (BP♀SI × ♂SI) among all plants labelled A, and the same for the plants labelled B, and C (Fig. 1).
In August 2014, we replicated the complete crossing design (as summarized in Fig. 1 for the A, B, and C
parental plants) with 36 different parental focal plants (three plants labelled D, E and F from each of the
12 populations).
In principle, our design would have generated 13 seed families per parental focal plant: 5 from
crosses with plants from populations with the same breeding system (BP♀SC × ♂SC or BP♀SI × ♂SI), 6 from
crosses with plants from populations with a different breeding system (BBS♀SI × ♂SC or BBS♀SC × ♂SI) and 2
from crosses with plants from the same population (WP♀SC × ♂SC or WP♀SI × ♂SI). In total, for the 72 (36+36)
parental plants, the complete design would thus have yielded 936 (468+468) seed families. However, not
all crosses resulted in seeds, so that we obtained 898 seed families (446+452).
As not all populations are completely fixed for one or the other breeding system, we assessed the
breeding system for all parental plants by performing at least six self-pollinations per plant on at least
three different days. For the “SC populations”, this confirmed that all 36 plants but one (genotype D of
population TSSA) were indeed SC (Table S2). For the “SI populations”, plants were either completely SI
or leaky SI. Following criteria set in Refs

19, 20

, the phenotype leaky SI is used for cases where self-

pollination led to fruits with seeds, often a variable number among replicates, but fewer seeds per fruit
than after cross-pollination with a compatible pollen donor.
To avoid accidental self-pollination when making crosses, we had emasculated potential recipient
flowers of SC plants in the bud-stage before anther dehiscence. As a control, we left at least one
emasculated flower without cross-pollen. In rare cases where this control led to fruit development (which

would indicate accidental self-pollination), we discarded any fruits from flowers on the same plant crosspollinated on the same day. To obtain at least one developed fruit for each recipient-donor combination,
we did up to three cross pollinations per combination. If all three cross-pollinations did not result in fruit
set, we considered the parents to be cross-incompatible. All fruits were collected when mature (4–7 weeks
after pollination) and stored under dry and cool conditions until further use.

Growth of progeny
To determine their breeding system, we sowed progeny from all 898 seed families in a growth chamber
with a light period of 16 h per day, keeping temperature between 17°C and 21°C (day) and at 15°C (night)
and humidity above 50%. For practical reasons, we sowed in five batches such that one seed per seed
family was sown at one time, either for the 446 families derived from the A, B and C parents (batch 1, 2
and 5), or for the 452 families from the D, E and F parents (batch 3 and 4). Additionally, to increase the
sample size for between-breeding-system crosses (BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI), for this particular crosstype, we sowed seeds from all parental plants (A-F) in a sixth batch, and from parental plants A-C in a
seventh and eighth batch. Batches were sown between July 2015 and February 2018 (Table S3), by
placing single seeds on moistened peat-based nutrient-poor substrate (Einheitserde und Humuswerke
Gebr. Patzer GmbH & Co., Sinntal, Germany) randomly assigned to a 2.5×3.2×11.0 cm cell in 54-cell
QuickPot trays (QP 54 T/11, Herkuplast Kubern GmbH, Ering/Inn, Germany). Seedlings were
transplanted into individual square polypropylene pots (7×7×6.5 cm, Pöppelmann, Germany) filled with
the same substrate as for germination. We watered twice a week and fertilized weekly with 50 ml of 0.1%
Scotts Universol® blue solution (Everris International B. V., Waardenburg, Netherlands).

Determination of the breeding system
Although not all seeds in each batch germinated and some plants did not flower within a few months from
sowing, we could perform self-pollinations on a total of 1607 progeny (Table S3) from 653 out of 898

seed families representing all 144 (12×12) population combinations. On each plant that flowered, we
performed ten self-pollinations on at least five different days by rubbing a ripe anther from a donor plant
on the stigma of the recipient flower.
After pollination, fruits elongate to accommodate the developing seeds, and attain their final
length one to two weeks after pollination19, 26. Fruit length is a good proxy of seed number (Fig. S1).
Therefore, as seeds can only be counted reliably at least four weeks after pollination, we used fruit length
at two weeks as a proxy of seed set to enable a higher throughput and allow screening of more plants.
Fruits without any developing seeds do not elongate and thus roughly maintain the length of the ovary
(FLzero), whereas fruits with full seed set elongate to a maximum fruit length (FLmax). Values of FLzero and
FLmax might vary among individual plants. Therefore, after pollination and fertilization, we measured the
fruit lengths at least two weeks after self-pollination, and subsequently expressed the degree of selfcompatibility relative to FLzero and FLmax. As it was logistically not feasible to perform control
emasculations (to obtain FLzero directly) and reference outcrosses (to obtain FLmax directly) for each
progeny in the design, we used the available information from the parental plants to calculate expected
FLzero and FLmax values for each progeny. As there is considerable within and among population variation
in the maximum fruit lengths, we first calculated FLmax for each parent individually by taking the median
fruit length resulting from the four used pollen donor types (self, within population, between population,
between breeding system), and taking the maximum of these medians:

There is limited variation for the length of fruits without developing seeds within populations, but there
are differences between populations21. To account for this, we calculated a population specific FLzero as
twice the mean pistil length in non-pollinated flowers for each population reported in21. Then, again

assuming an additive contribution of the maternal and paternal parent of each progeny, we calculated the

Based on these and the average fruit length resulting from self-pollination, we calculated an index
of self-compatibility (SC) for each progeny:
SC-index =

   

In principle, this index ranges from 0 (complete self-incompatibility) to 1 (complete selfcompatibility), but is not mathematically bound by 0 and 1 due to variation in the estimates of the
different component parameters.
Progeny that do not produce any elongated fruits (SC-index = 0) after self-pollination are
considered to be SI, although in principle female or male sterility would give a similar outcome. To
discern truly SI progeny from ones with sterility, the female and male fertility of all apparent SI progeny
was tested by using them as donor (to test male fertility) and recipient (to test female fertility) in crosses
with up to two haphazardly chosen unrelated progeny (only SI progeny were used if testing male fertility
of the progeny). This was done for all 356 progeny that appeared SI in the first four batches. Twentyseven out of the 356 tested progeny did not produce seeds with either partner. Although such progeny are
not necessarily sterile, as cross-incompatibility could also explain lack of seed formation after crossing
crosses, we conservatively excluded the 27 potentially sterile progeny from further analyses (see Table
S3).

Statistical analyses
To test for differences in SC-index between cross-types, we used linear mixed effects models
implemented in the lme function of the ‘nlme’ package27 in R 3.4.328. With the SC-index as the
dependent variable, the model fixed part included cross-type (WP ♀SI × ♂SI, WP ♀SC × ♂SC, BP ♀SI × ♂SI,
BP ♀SC × ♂SC, BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI), and the model random part included maternal population,

maternal individual (nested in maternal population), paternal population, paternal individual (nested in
parental population) and batch number. To enable using a Gaussian error distribution and ensure an
appropriate normality and homogeneity of model residuals, we transformed the SC-index, which
ranged from -0.39 to 2.71, by adding 1.39 to all values and subsequent natural log-transformation. To
account for heterogeneity of variance (i.e. differences in variance between the different cross-types),
the model included a VarIdent variance structure that allowed each level of the factor cross type to have
a different variance29.
To compare the mean SC-index among the different cross-types, we specified a matrix defining a
series of 13 custom linear comparisons between different cross-type combinations (contrasts C1 to C13)
and used the glht function in the multcomp package30 to perform z-tests corrected for multiple
comparisons (Table 1). First, we tested whether progeny from between- and within-population crosses
had a different SC-index, both for SI populations (C1: BP♀SI × ♂SI vs WP ♀SI × ♂SI) and for SC populations
(C2: BP ♀SC × ♂SC vs WP ♀SC × ♂SC). Second, we tested whether the SC-index of progeny from betweenpopulation crosses differed between SC and SI populations (C3: BP ♀SI × ♂SI vs BP ♀SC × ♂SC). Third, we
tested whether the SC-index of progeny from between-breeding-system crosses depended on the
direction of the cross (C4: BBS♀SI × ♂SC vs BBS♀SC × ♂SI). When C4 was not significant, we merged
BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI, and did further contrasts to test for phenotypic additivity (C5:
BBS vs BP), complete phenotypic dominance of self-incompatibility (C6: BBS vs BP♀SI × ♂SI) or
complete phenotypic dominance of self-compatibility (C7: BBS vs BP ♀SC × ♂SC). When C4 was
significant, we did not merge BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI and used separate tests for phenotypic
additivity (C8: BBS♀SI × ♂SC vs BP and C9: BBS♀SC × ♂SI vs BP), phenotypic dominance of selfincompatibility (C10: BBS♀SI × ♂SC vs BP♀SI × ♂SI and C11: BBS♀SC × ♂SI vs BP ♀SI × ♂SI,), and phenotypic
dominance of self-compatibility (C12: BBS♀SI × ♂SC vs BP ♀SC × ♂SC and C13:BBS♀ SC × ♂SI vs BP♀SC × ♂SC).
The SC-index values were bimodally distributed with peaks around 0 (corresponding to selfincompatibility) and 1 (corresponding to self-compatibility) (Fig. 2). Based on this, we assigned a
phenotype to individual plants based on their SC-index value. Conservatively, we assigned the

phenotype “SC” to all progeny with an SC-index>0.75 and “SI” to all progeny with an SC-index<0.25.
Progeny with intermediate values (SC-index between 0.25 and 0.75) were thus not phenotyped, and
excluded from the analyses below. To test whether self-compatibility could be explained by one or two
loci, we formulated one- and two-locus models in which each locus had a single allele required for selfcompatibility. Alleles required for self-compatibility could either be recessive or dominant to other
allelic states, and were assumed to be fixed in SC populations (i.e., the SC cross partner was always
assumed to be homozygous for the involved allele or alleles). For outcrossing populations, we used
exact binomial goodness-of-fit tests to evaluate extreme scenarios in which the alleles were completely
absent or completely fixed, and a “best-fit” scenario. The latter corresponds to the allele-frequency
scenario that, following Hardy-Weinberg principles, best predicted the observed frequencies of SC and
SI progeny from between-breeding-system crosses. For these scenarios, we also assessed the goodnessof-fit for SC and SI frequencies in progeny from crosses between SI plants within populations
(WP ♀SI × ♂SI) and between populations (BP♀SI × ♂SI).

Results
Crosses within the self-compatible breeding system (♀SC × ♂SC crosses)
For crosses within SC populations (WP♀SC × ♂SC), the SC-index of progeny had a unimodal
distribution with a median of 1.16. The vast majority of progeny (80 out of 86) had an SC-index above
the conservative threshold of 0.75, and was thus phenotyped as SC (Fig. 2, Table S5). The same pattern
emerged for crosses between SC populations (BP♀SC × ♂SC), with an even higher SC-index median of 1.30
(significant effect of C2 in Table 1, Fig. 2), and with 233 out of 242 progeny phenotyped as SC (Table
S5). Thus, overall, most progeny from crosses between SC parents showed no evidence for restoration of
self-incompatibility (Fig. 3). Of the 15 cases with an SC-index below the 0.75 threshold, 14 had values
above the 0.25 threshold for self-incompatibility, and could thus not be phenotyped unambiguously. Only
one had an SC-index below 0.25 and was thus phenotyped as SI (Fig. 3C, Table S5). This single
exception involved parents from the SC populations PTP and TSSA, which otherwise produced
unambiguously SC progeny (Fig. S2).

Crosses within the self-incompatible breeding system (♀SI × ♂SI crosses)
For crosses within SI populations (WP♀SI × ♂SI), the SC-index of progeny had a unimodal
distribution with a median of 0.04. The majority of progeny (51 out of 79) had an SC-index below the
threshold of 0.25, and was thus phenotyped as SI (Fig. 2, Table S5). However, a considerable number of
progeny (9 out of 79) had an SC-index above 0.75 and was thus phenotyped as SC. The remaining 19
progeny had intermediate SC-index values and could thus not be phenotyped unambiguously according to
our (conservative) thresholds (Table S5). Similar patterns emerged for crosses between SI populations
(BP♀SI × ♂SI, no significant effect of C1 in Table 1). With a median SC-index of -0.03 (Fig. 2), 171 out of
215 progeny was phenotyped as SI, 8 as SC and the remaining 36 intermediate (Table S5). Thus, overall,
most progeny from crosses between SI parents were SI (Fig. 3). However, SC progeny emerged in crosses
within four out of six SI populations (MAN, PCR, PIN, SBD), and in several crosses between SI
populations (eight different population-combinations; Fig. 3D).

Crosses between plants with a different breeding system (♀SC × ♂SI and ♀SI × ♂SC crosses)
The range of SC-index values of progeny from between-breeding-system crosses (BBS ♀SI × ♂SC
and BBS♀SC × ♂SI) included the complete spectrum from completely SI to completely SC. Although on
average intermediate to the SC-index of progeny from crosses within breeding systems (BP♀SC × ♂SC and
BP♀SI × ♂SI; no significant effect of C5 in Table 1), most between-breeding-system progeny could be
phenotyped as either SC (477 out of 958) or SI (382 out of 958) (Table S5). Consequently, the SC-index
showed a bimodal distribution with a median of 0.74 and peaks at c. 0 and c. 1.2 (Fig. 2B). The remaining
99 progeny had intermediate SC-index values and could thus not be phenotyped unambiguously
according to our (conservative) thresholds (Table S5). The cross direction did not have a significant effect
on the average SC-index value of progeny from between-breeding-system crosses (no significant effect of
C4 in Table 1; Fig. 2), although the proportion of SC plants was higher when the mother was SC (Table
S5). The patterns were not specific to any cross-combination, as the vast majority of populationcombinations (31 out of 36) resulted in both SI and SC progeny (Fig. 3C; Fig. 3D). At the seed family
level, 103 out of 266 families segregated for breeding system, i.e., they contained both SI progeny (SCindex<0.25) and SC progeny (SC-index>0.75) (Fig S2).

Evaluation of one and two-locus models to explain the loss of self-incompatibility
The observed relatively equal frequencies of SC and SI plants strongly speak against a single-locus
genetic basis with completely additively interacting alleles, as this should have resulted in a unimodal
distribution of SC-index values after between-breeding-system crosses. Similarly, single-locus models
with allelic dominance of the allele conferring self-compatibility are unlikely, as these should have
resulted in phenotypic dominance of self-compatibility, which could be statistically rejected (significant
contrasts C6 and C7 in Table 1; significant deviation from single-locus dominant model in Table 2). The
only single-locus model that could fit our observations would be one where the mutation acts recessively
and has a relatively high frequency of 0.555 in SI populations (Table 2). However, for that scenario to

work, crosses between SI parents should have yielded a much higher frequency (30.8%) of SC individuals
than observed both within and between populations (15% and 4.5%, respectively; Table 2).
Based on the overall observed frequencies of SC and SI plants after between-breeding-system
crosses, two-locus models with dominance of both alleles required for self-compatibility could be rejected
regardless of the assumed allele frequencies in outcrossing populations. Two-locus models in which one
or both alleles act recessively could predict our data if the product of the frequency of the alleles required
for SC equaled 0.555 (for the recessive-recessive models), or if the frequency of the recessive allele
equaled 0.555 (for the dominant-recessive models).
Based on the observed frequencies of SC and SI plants after crosses between SI plants, the
recessive-recessive model could be rejected, because the frequency of SC individuals (15% for within
population crosses; 4.5% for between population crosses) did not fit the prediction of 30.8% SC progeny
(Table 2). The dominant-recessive model could predict our data at the inferred recessive allele-frequency
of 0.555, if the required dominant allele had a frequency of 0.284 (for crosses within populations) or
0.076 (for crosses between populations).

Discussion

By determining the breeding system of 1,580 progeny from crosses within and between selfing and
outcrossing populations of North American Arabidopsis lyrata, we obtained unique insights in the genetic
basis of the loss of self-incompatibility in a species with a relatively recent (intraspecific) transition to
selfing. Our first main finding is that most progeny from crosses between SC parents from six different
selfing populations were also SC. This shows that the loss of self-incompatibility in the different selfing
populations of A. lyrata cannot be explained by different recessive loss-of-function mutations. Our second
main finding is that crosses between parents with different breeding systems yielded an even segregation
ratio of breeding-system phenotypes (i.e., equal frequencies of SC and SI progeny). Taken together, our
findings show that single-locus models cannot explain the genetic basis of the breakdown of self14

incompatibility in North American A. lyrata. Instead, we propose that at least two loci are involved in
self-compatibility: the S-locus and one or more modifier-loci. More specifically, we propose that plants
carrying the dominant S-haplotype S19 are rendered SC if they are homozygous for a recessive modifierallele, and that plants homozygous for the recessive S-haplotype S1 are rendered SC if they carry a
dominant modifier-allele.

A single loss-of-function mutation in any of the genes required for self-incompatibility provides
the simplest potential genetic mechanism that would explain the breakdown of self-incompatibility13. As
it is improbable for the same mutation to happen twice, under a scenario of multiple origins of selfcompatibility, one would then expect that different loss-of-function mutations underlie self-compatibility
in different selfing populations. Indeed, different loss-of-function mutations at the S-locus have been
found in different A. thaliana haplogroups31. Since loss-of-function mutations are usually recessive32, one
would thus expect restoration of self-incompatibility through genetic complementation when the genomes
of two SC plants with different recessive loss-of-function mutations are combined. Our results, however,
do not support this scenario for A. lyrata. When crossing SC plants from six selfing populations with
three different population genetic backgrounds20, self-incompatibility was never restored. This lack of
genetic complementation could either imply that one and the same recessive loss-of-function mutation
causes self-compatibility in the different selfing backgrounds, or that the loss of self-incompatibility has a
more complex genetic basis involving more loci.

Our finding of roughly equal frequencies of SI and SC progeny from between-breeding-system
crosses (BBS♀SI × ♂SC and BBS♀SC × ♂SI) and the emergence of some SC progeny from crosses between SI
plants (WP♀SI × ♂SI, BP♀SI × ♂SI) supports the involvement of at least two loci in conferring selfcompatibility in A. lyrata. This could reflect that a genetic interaction underlies the loss of selfincompatibility, but could also be explained by secondary mutations accumulating after a single primary

16
causal mutation. Such accumulation is expected due to relaxed purifying selection on genes involved in
self-incompatibility after a transition to selfing, especially in selfing species that have diverged from their
outcrossing ancestors sufficiently long ago for a selfing syndrome to evolve33. The resulting molecular
signatures of secondary mutations in A. thaliana18 and C. rubella17 make it difficult to distinguish primary
from secondary mutations in such species13. However, in the case of A. lyrata, secondary mutations are
much less likely given the recent intraspecific origin of selfing in this species. Therefore, the involvement
of two loci in A. lyrata more likely reflects a genetic interaction in which an allele of one locus confers
self-compatibility by interacting with one or more alleles of another locus.
Interactions of modifiers with the S-locus are common features of homomorphic selfincompatibility systems34, 35, 36. Modifiers are particularly important in regulation of the sporophytic selfincompatibility of the Brassicaceae13, 37, 38. Based on this idea, it was proposed that in A. lyrata, an allele
for a modifier-locus confers self-compatibility in plants homozygous for the S-locus haplotype S124.
However, the empirical support for this model was thin, as it was only based on segregation ratios in a
single F2 family derived from one ♀SI × ♂SC cross. Moreover, although two selfing populations are fixed
for the S1 haplotype, four of the selfing populations are fixed for the S19 haplotype24. Our comprehensive
crossing design, involving pairwise crosses between representatives from all six known selfing
populations and six outcrossing populations, provides the first rigorous test of the modifier-hypothesis.
The observed segregation of SC and SI cross-progeny in the first generation after between-breedingsystem crosses, and the emergence of SC progeny after crosses between SI plants can all be explained by
the hypothesis. Together, this provides strong support that self-compatibility in all selfing populations of
North American of A. lyrata is conferred by a genetic interaction between modifier-alleles and the S-locus
haplotypes S1 and S19.
The appearance of SC progeny in crosses between SI parents from different populations suggests
that one or more of the modifier-alleles segregate in outcrossing populations. Maintenance of modifieralleles conferring partial or complete self-compatibility is expected as a means to provide reproductive
assurance under conditions where costs of complete self-incompatibility are high39, 40, 41. As the S1916

haplotype is dominant and thus relatively rare (10%) in our six SI populations24, the modifier allele
interacting with S19 should act recessively, and have a relatively high frequency in outcrossing
populations (>50%) to explain the observed equal frequencies of SI and SC phenotypes in betweenbreeding-system crosses. Unlike the dominant S19, S1 is recessive to any other S-haplotype42, and thus
generally has a high frequency (79%) in outcrossing populations (e.g., Refs

24, 43

). Thus, unless there is

segregation distortion against S144, this would mean that about 60% of the plants in outcrossing
populations are homozygous for S1. Since SC plants are relatively rare in outcrossing populations, this
implies that the modifier-allele conferring self-compatibility in S1 homozygotes should have a relatively
low frequency in outcrossing populations (much lower than the inferred frequency of the modifier
conferring self-compatibility in plants carrying S19). Based on this, we propose that S1 and S19 do not
interact with the same modifier-allele. This would also explain why between-breeding-system crosses
yielded different frequencies of SC phenotypes depending on whether the SC parent came from a selfing
population fixed for S1 or from a population fixed for S19 (Fig. S3; Table S5). It remains to be tested
whether the two modifier-alleles are variants of the same locus, or belong to independent loci, and
whether they can also interact with other S-locus haplotypes.

Fig. 2 SC-index values for progeny from crosses within and between breeding systems
A) Box-and whisker plot. Boxes delimit the interquartile range (IQR) with the median indicated as a solid line.
ne.
Whiskers extend to 1.5×IQR or to the lowest/highest data point within 1.5×IQR. Points beyond the whiskers’ limits
its
represent outliers. B) Density plot. Color scheme used: grey for within-population (WP) crosses; orange for
between-population (BP) crosses; red for between-breeding-system (BBS) crosses (by design also between
en
populations). Solid borders and lines are used for cross-types with self-incompatible maternal parents (♀SI) and
nd

dashed borders and lines for cross-types with self-compatible maternal parents (♀SC). Note the bimodal shape for
the BBS cross-type with peaks matching those observed for the cross-types from between-SI-populations crosses
ses
and between-SC-populations crosses.

Fig. 3 Summary statistics for the SC-index for within and between population crosses
A) Cell-specific number of progeny for which the breeding system phenotype was determined; B) Heat-map of
median SC-index; C) Heat-map of minimum SC-index; D) Heat-map of maximum SC-index. Population codes
es
correspond to the ones in Table S1. Diagonal cells marked with an extra outline represent progeny from within-population crosses. Other squares represent each possible combination of populations in two directions (with the
maternal population shown at the top). The 36-cell top-left quadrat and 36-cell bottom-right quadrat represent
ent
crosses between plants with the same breeding system (♀SI × ♂SI and ♀SC × ♂SC, respectively). The 36-cell top-right quadrat and 36-cell bottom-left quadrat represent crosses between plants with different breeding systemss
(♀SC × ♂SI and ♀SI × ♂SC, respectively).

Notes: We tested the significance of the fixed effects by comparing models with and without the tested term
using likelihood-ratio tests. Significant effects are indicated in bold. We individually calculated fruit length of
progeny plants and parental plants based on the median fruit length of multiple fruits per plant prior to analysis.

Fig. S1 Relationship between fruit length (mm) and seed number per fruit by maternal population.
For the subset of the fourth and fifth two batches, we counted seeds per fruit for self-pollinated fruits,
to test whether fruit length was a good predictor of seed set. Population codes correspond to those in
Table S1). Best-fit regression lines are shown along with their equation and proportion of explained
variance R2.

Fig. S2 SC-index values for individual cross-progeny by seed family.
Crosses between populations were always done between parents with the same plant code (i.e. plants
coded A were always crossed with another plant coded A, plants coded B with other plants coded B,
et cetera, cf. crossing design in Fig. 1). Population coding corresponds to the coding in Table S1.
Diagonal cells marked with an extra outline represent progeny from within-population crosses which
resulted from crosses among plants coded A, B and C and among plants coded D, E and F.

Fig. S3 SC-index values for progeny from crosses between breeding systems for the six SC
populations grouped by S-haplotype.
Box plots (A, C) show the interquartile range (IQR) around the median (black horizontal line), with
whiskers extending to 1.5×IQR or to the lowest/highest data point within 1.5×IQR. Points beyond
whiskers’ limits represent outliers. Density plots (B, D). The S-haplotypes of SC parents from PTP
and RON are S1S1 homozygotes, and from the other four populations S19S19.
