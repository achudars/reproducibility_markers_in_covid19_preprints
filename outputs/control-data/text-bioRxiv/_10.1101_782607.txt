Abstract
Photoreceptor death is the ultimate cause of vision loss in many retinal degenerative

18

conditions. Identifying novel therapeutic avenues for prolonging photoreceptor health and

19

function has the potential to improve vision and quality of life for patients suffering from

20

degenerative retinal disorders. Photoreceptors are metabolically unique among other neurons in

21

that they process the majority of their glucose via aerobic glycolysis. One of the main regulators

22

of aerobic glycolysis is hexokinase 2 (HK2). Beyond its enzymatic function of phosphorylating

23

glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, HK2 has additional non-enzymatic roles, including the

24

regulation of apoptotic signaling via AKT signaling. Determining the role of HK2 in photoreceptor

25

homeostasis may identify novel signaling pathways that can be targeted with neuroprotective

26

agents to boost photoreceptor survival during metabolic stress. Here we show that following

27

experimental retinal detachment, p-AKT is upregulated and HK2 translocates to mitochondria.

28

Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in 661W photoreceptor-like cells results in translocation of

29

mitochondrial HK2 to the cytoplasm, increased caspase activity, and decreased cell viability.

30

Rod-photoreceptors lacking HK2 upregulate HK1 and appear to develop normally. Interestingly,

31

we found that HK2-deficient photoreceptors are more susceptible to acute nutrient deprivation in

32

the experimental retinal detachment model. Additionally, HK2 appears to be important for

33

preserving photoreceptors during aging. We show that retinal glucose metabolism is largely

34

unchanged after HK2 deletion, suggesting that the non-enzymatic role of HK2 is important for

35

maintaining photoreceptor health. These results suggest that HK2 expression is critical for

36

preserving photoreceptors during acute nutrient stress and aging. More specifically, p-AKT

37

mediated translocation of HK2 to the mitochondrial surface may be critical for protecting

38

photoreceptors from acute and chronic stress.

Introduction
Nearly 10 million individuals in the US alone are affected with either diabetic retinopathy,

41

age-related macular degeneration, or retinitis pigmentosa, and the number of affected adults is

42

only predicted to increase due to the aging population of the United States.1 Although the

43

pathological mechanisms underlying these various retinal degenerations are complex, the

44

ultimate cause of blindness is the death of photoreceptor cells. Therefore, identifying a common

45

mechanism for promoting photoreceptor cell survival agnostic of the upstream pathological

46

signaling has immense potential for preserving vision in many types of retinal diseases.

47

Photoreceptors require a tremendous amount of macromolecules to replenish their outer

48

segments, which are shed daily.2 In addition, photoreceptors seem to possess little reserve

49

capacity for energy production and are extremely sensitive to metabolic dysfunction as

50

evidenced by mutations in common metabolism genes leading to isolated inherited retinal

51

degenerations. For example, the enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1

52

(IMPDH1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 beta (IDH3B) are expressed

53

throughout most tissues in the body; however, mutations affecting the genes encoding for these

54

proteins result in isolated retinal degeneration.3-5 These data suggest that the metabolism of

55

photoreceptors is tightly regulated and small perturbations may lead to deficiencies which

56

cannot be compensated for, resulting in cell death.6 Therefore, identifying pathways important

57

for cell survival during metabolic stress may prove useful for delaying or preventing

58

photoreceptor cell death in many types of retinal degenerations.7-10 These and other data have

59

led to a hypothesis suggesting that disruption of metabolism and nutrient availability may be a

60

unifying mechanism for photoreceptor cell death in many degenerative retinal diseases.10,11

61

Photoreceptors utilize a type of metabolism unique among all other terminally

62

differentiated neurons, called aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect, to process the majority of

63

glucose that enters the cell.12 Photoreceptors may employ this unique metabolic adaptation to

64

meet their high demand for energy and biosynthetic intermediates.13 Aerobic glycolysis tightly

65

regulates substrate utilization, either allowing the shuttling of glycolytic intermediates to other

66

biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide, amino acid, and lipid synthesis or to energy production via

67

the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, depending on the physiologic needs of the cell.14 Three

68

enzymes are key for performing aerobic glycolysis: hexokinase 2 (HK2), pyruvate kinase muscle

69

isozyme 2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). We have recently shown that

70

genetically switching PKM2 for PKM1 protects photoreceptors from acute outer retinal stress

71

induced by experimental retinal detachment.7 Interestingly, HK2 has been shown to play a role

72

in mediating apoptotic cell processes after nutrient stress.15,16 This identifies HK2 as another

73

attractive target for developing novel neuroprotective interventions in the retina.

74

Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is one of four main isozymes responsible for the first step in

75

glycolysis. HK2 normally resides on the mitochondria, bound to voltage dependent anion

76

channel (VDAC), where it receives preferential access to ATP for the phosphorylation of

77

glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. While bound to VDAC, HK2 can also prevent the binding of

78

pro-apoptotic factors to the mitochondria and the opening of the mitochondria permeability

79

transition pore (mPTP), which blocks the release of cytochrome c.16,17 Protein kinase B (AKT)

80

has been shown to modulate the ability of HK2 to bind to VDAC through direct

81

phosphorylation.18,19

82

In this report, we show that HK2 preferentially localizes to the mitochondrial enriched

83

fraction after outer retinal stress as produced by experimental retinal detachment. Disrupting the

84

association between HK2 and mitochondria can be partially blocked by inhibiting AKT

85

phosphorylation in vitro, which leads to decreased cell viability and increased caspase activity.

86

We also demonstrate that rod photoreceptor-specific, Hk2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice are

87

more susceptible to acute outer retinal metabolic stress, suggesting an anti-apoptotic role for

88

HK2 during metabolic stress. Additionally, we show that the loss of Hk2 in rod photoreceptors

does not reprogram metabolism to primarily oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, the rod

90

photoreceptor-specific, Hk2 cKO mice show significant outer retinal thinning and photoreceptor

91

loss at advanced age. Collectively, these findings indicate that HK2 is critical for regulating

92

photoreceptor survival during acute metabolic stress and normal aging.

Results

94

HK2 localizes to mitochondria following retinal detachment

95

One of the non-enzymatic roles of HK2 is to inhibit apoptosis by preventing opening of the

96

mPTP.15,16,18 This non-enzymatic function can only be done while HK2 is physically bound to

97

VDAC on the outer mitochondrial membrane. AKT has been shown to phosphorylate HK2,

98

which promotes binding to VDAC.18 In order to determine if HK2 binding to VDAC is important

99

for photoreceptor protection after retinal detachment, the levels of HK2 and the ratio of p-

100

AKT/total AKT were assessed following experimental retinal detachment (RD) in rats (Fig. 1).

101

Three and seven days following RD, total HK2 protein expression assessed by Western blot

102

analysis was decreased significantly (Fig. 1a). Total AKT expression was unchanged, but p-AKT

103

(S473) and the ratio of p-AKT/total AKT was significantly increased (Fig. 1b). To determine if

104

this increase in p-AKT is associated with changes in HK2 sub-cellular localization, rat retinas

105

were detached and harvested at 1-, 3- and 7-days post-RD. After fractionation, HK2 was found

106

to be enriched in the post-cytosolic, mitochondrial enriched fraction (hereafter referred to as

107

“mitochondrial fraction”) 3- and 7-days after retinal detachment (Fig. 1c&d), suggesting that

108

increased p-AKT may be enhancing HK2 association with mitochondria.

109

LY294002 treatment induces HK2 translocation to the cytosol and caspase activation

110

To better define the relationship between AKT and HK2 localization, the 661W photoreceptor-

111

like cell model was used.20,21 Nearly all of the HK2 present in 661W cell extracts localizes to the

112

mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1e). When treated with LY294002 for 1.5 hours, a significant

113

enrichment of HK2 in the cytosolic fraction was observed (Fig. 1f) and phosphorylation of AKT is

114

nearly abolished as demonstrated on Western blot (Fig. 1g). After 6 hours of exposure to

115

LY294002, both caspase 3/7 and 8 were significantly activated (Fig. 1h&i) with a corresponding

116

significant decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1j). These data agree with previous studies

117

demonstrating a neuroprotective effect of activated AKT on photoreceptors and suggest that at

118

least part of this neuroprotective effect may be mediated by the regulation of HK2 localization in

119

the cell.19,22,23

120

Deletion of Hk2 from rod photoreceptors leads to Hk1 upregulation

121

Since the previous data suggest that HK2 may be important for preserving photoreceptor health

122

during apoptotic stress, a rod photoreceptor-specific, Hk2 conditional knockout mouse model

123

was constructed to study the effects of Hk2 deficiency in photoreceptors. Mice harboring a

124

floxed Hk2 gene were crossed with Rho-Cre mice, where Cre-recombinase is expressed

125

specifically in rod photoreceptors.24,25 Mice with both Hk2 alleles present in photoreceptors

126

(Hk2wt/wt;Rho-Cre+: WT), and animals lacking both Hk2 alleles in photoreceptors (Hk2fl/fl;Rho-

127

Cre+: cKO) were produced. Consistent with other reports, immunofluorescence of retinal

128

sections from WT mice showed that HK2 is almost exclusively expressed in photoreceptors (Fig.

129

2a). In cKO animals, the HK2 signal was only present in cone photoreceptors as shown by

130

cone arrestin (ARR3) staining (Fig. 2b).26,27 Additionally, WT retinas express low levels of HK1 in

131

photoreceptor inner segments (Fig. 2c) with the vast majority of HK1 expressed in other cells

132

within the retina. Immunofluorescent staining of retinas from cKO mice demonstrated that

133

photoreceptors upregulate HK1, and this increased HK1 expression is predominantly localized

134

to rod inner segments (Fig. 2c). Western blotting confirmed these results by showing that HK2 is

135

nearly absent from the retina of cKO animals while total HK1 levels are statistically significantly

136

increased (Fig. 2d and 2e).

137

HK2 promotes photoreceptor survival during acute outer retinal stress

138

As discussed above, one of the main non-enzymatic roles of HK2 is to inhibit apoptosis via its

139

interaction with the mitochondria. The experimental model of retinal detachment utilized here

140

results in increased apoptosis of photoreceptors.28-33 Furthermore, it was observed that HK2

141

was enriched in the mitochondria fraction after experimental retinal detachment in rats (Fig. 1d).

142

Therefore, we sought to determine the role of HK2 in photoreceptor survival under acute outer

143

retinal metabolic stress as produced by this experimental model of retinal detachment. The

144

retinas of WT and cKO mice were detached and harvested 3 days later as this has been shown

145

to be the peak of TUNEL staining in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) after retinal detachment and

146

correlates with long-term photoreceptor survival.7,34 cKO mice had significantly more TUNEL

147

positive cells in the ONL as compared to WT mice (Fig 3a&b). As in our rat model of retinal

148

detachment (Fig. 1a), HK2 levels are significantly down regulated in WT mice 3 days post retinal

149

detachment, and as expected, since cKO animals have significantly reduced levels of HK2 in

150

the retina (Fig. 2), no change was detected following retinal detachment (Fig 3c). Surprisingly,

151

HK1 protein levels were significantly down regulated in the retinas of cKO mice 3 days after

152

retinal detachment, but not in the retinas of WT mice (Fig 3d).

153
154

HK2 affects photoreceptor survival and retinal function in aging

155

To assess the phenotype resulting from rod photoreceptor-specific, Hk2 deletion, in vivo retinal

156

morphology was assessed via optical coherence tomography (OCT). A small but significant

157

decrease in OSEL (outer segment equivalent length) was observed at 1 month but was not

158

present at 5 months of age (Fig. 4a&b). By 10 months of age, a significant decrease in total

159

retinal thickness was observed in cKO mice as compared to WT mice (Fig. 4a&b). This thinning

160

is driven by a reduction in ONL and OSEL thickness (Fig. 4b). Eyes from 10-month-old cKO and

161

WT mice were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess total ONL cell

162

counts. The percent of ONL nuclei was statistically significantly less in cKO compared to WT

163

mice (Fig. 4c&d), consistent with in vivo morphologic assessment. In accordance with these

164

anatomic changes, visual function, as evaluated by electroretinography (ERG), showed no

165

significant changes in any amplitudes at 2 and 5 months of age. Yet, at 10 months of age,

166

statistically significant decreases were noted in the scotopic a-and b-wave amplitudes as well as

167

in the photopic b-wave amplitude of cKO animals (Fig 4e-h).

168

Deletion of HK2 does not significantly alter retinal metabolism

169

Rod photoreceptors have been reported to reprogram their energy metabolism from aerobic

170

glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation when Hk2 is deleted.26 To investigate this potential

171

metabolic reprogramming in our rod-specific Hk2 cKO model, the transcriptional profile of

172

central glucose metabolism genes was determined in the retina. We conducted real-time PCR

173

using the Mouse Glucose Metabolism RT2 ProfilerTM PCR array (Qiagen), which assesses

174

genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose phosphate

175

pathway, glycogen synthesis, glycogen degradation, and regulation of glucose and glycogen

176

metabolism. Of the 84 genes examined, only seven showed significant (p<0.05) expression

177

differences between the Hk2 cKO mice and WT mice (supplemental table 1, Fig. 5a). Of these,

178

only Fbp2 demonstrated a statistically significant fold change greater than 2. FBP2 (fructose

179

1,6-bisphosphatase, 2.9 fold change) is the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis and catalyzes

180

the conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. Conversion of glucose to

181

lactate is a hallmark of aerobic glycolysis. Photoreceptors process 80-96% of all glucose into

182

lactate; therefore, a decrease in the total steady-state lactate levels would suggest significant

183

perturbations to aerobic glycolysis.35 No significant differences in total retinal lactate levels

184

between cKO and WT animals were observed at 2 months of age (Fig. 5b). Similarly, PKM2 and

185

LDHA, the two other main regulators of aerobic glycolysis, were assayed by Western blotting.

186

No significant differences in the expression levels of either enzyme was detected between cKO

187

and WT mice (Fig. 5c-f). Collectively, these data demonstrate the lack of any major retinal

188

metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism when Hk2 is genetically deleted in rod

189

photoreceptors.

191

Discussion

192

In this study, we show that HK2 translocates to mitochondria following retinal

193

detachment and at the same time is significantly downregulated. This subcellular localization

194

following nutrient deprivation stress in the retina may be mediated by increased HK2

195

phosphorylation via activated retinal AKT. We also show that inhibiting AKT phosphorylation

196

using a broad PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) results in accumulation of HK2 in the cytosol.

197

Treatment with LY294002 activates caspase 3, 7, and 8, and reduces cell viability, possibly due

198

to reduced HK2 fraction in the mitochondria. Rod-specific Hk2 deletion results in the

199

upregulation of Hk1 expression in the photoreceptor inner segments. Under acute outer retinal

200

stress induced by experimental retinal detachment, HK2-to-HK1 isoform switching increases rod

201

photoreceptor susceptibility to cell death. This HK isoform switch also leads to degenerative

202

changes in the outer retina with aging, as shown by the decrease in both ERG amplitudes and

203

concurrent decline in retinal thickness measurements. Interestingly, only a single central

204

metabolic gene, Fbp2, exhibited a significant change in expression and no significant changes

205

in aerobic glycolysis were observed in the retinas of the rod photoreceptor-specific, Hk2 cKO

206

mice. These data suggest that increased HK1 expression in rods functionally replaces HK2 at

207

the metabolic level. Under the experimental conditions used in these studies, the

208

neuroprotective effect of HK2 during acute outer retinal stress and aging may be due to its non-

209

enzymatic activities.15,16,18

210

Deletion of HK2 from rod-photoreceptors led to an increase in total HK1 levels in the

211

retina, specifically in the rod photoreceptor inner segments. Despite HK2 expression being

212

associated with increased aerobic glycolysis, we were unable to detect any significant

213

perturbations to aerobic glycolysis in photoreceptors lacking HK2.36,37 For example, lactate is

214

almost exclusively produced by photoreceptors in the retina through aerobic glycolysis, however

215

no significant changes in steady-state lactate production were observed in the Hk2 cKO

216

retinas.35 Furthermore, very few changes were observed in the expression of genes involved in

217

central glucose metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that HK1 can metabolically

218

replace HK2. It will be important to both determine the steady-state levels of the metabolites

219

during glucose metabolism as well as the flux of 13C-glucose as it is broken down through

220

glycolysis and branching pathways to examine the exact metabolic effects of HK2-to-HK1

221

substitution in photoreceptors.

222

As glucose is the primary fuel source for photoreceptors, an isoform of hexokinase is

223

likely required to initiate the glycolytic cascade. All isoforms of hexokinase perform the same

224

enzymatic reaction, phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Yet, each isoform has

225

differing enzymatic rates to account for varying responsibilities depending on cell type.38

226

Interestingly, HK1 and HK2 have similar enzymatic constants and even though HK2 is believed

227

to be critical for aerobic glycolysis, this enzymatic similarity may allow HK1 to maintain

228

metabolic homeostasis and ultimately, to prevent significant transcriptional response to

229

compensate for the absence of HK2. The only gene which was significantly altered in Hk2 cKO

230

retinas was Fbp2. Enhanced fructose bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity and decreased fructose

231

2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P) levels secondary to increased Fbp2 expression would be expected to

232

decrease glycolytic flux and may maintain photoreceptor glucose homeostasis in Hk2 cKO

233

retinas via opposing PFK1 activity, the critical enzyme for committing glucose-derived

234

metabolites to glycolytic flux.39,40

235

The data presented here suggest that the non-enzymatic functions of HK2 may be more

236

important for preserving photoreceptors during acute stress than its enzymatic roles. We found

237

that the distribution of HK2 is nearly equal between cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions in the

238

normal rat retina. It has been shown that both HK1 and HK2 are maximally enzymatically active

239

and preferentially use mitochondrial produced ATP to phosphorylate glucose.41 Since not all of

240

HK2 is found in the mitochondrial fraction, HK2 may be regulated to fine tune the amount of

11

241

glucose entering glycolysis. Alternatively, HK2 may be performing a critical, non-enzymatic

242

function in the cytosol unrelated to glycolysis. Further studies are needed to investigate the

243

potentially distinct roles of HK2 in the cytosol, which may explain why HK2 is preferentially

244

expressed in photoreceptors. One of the major non-enzymatic roles of HK2 is to inhibit binding

245

of pro-apoptotic factors and prevent opening of the mPTP, which may explain why HK2

246

translocates to the mitochondrial fraction following retinal detachment. Experimental retinal

247

detachment induces acute apoptotic stress on photoreceptors mediated by the Fas signaling

248

cascade.29,33 When HK2 translocation is partially blocked using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002,

249

661W cells activate caspases and undergo cell death. While inhibiting the PI3K signaling

250

cascade alters numerous intracellular pathways that may be important in cell survival, our data

251

suggests that HK2 binding to mitochondria is at least partially responsible for inhibiting

252

apoptosis, similar to what was shown in other experimental models.19

253

Photoreceptors lacking HK2 are more susceptible to acute nutrient deprivation caused

254

by retinal detachment. Since HK1 replaces HK2 in cKO photoreceptors and has a similar affinity

255

for glucose when compared to HK2, this susceptibility to nutrient deprivation is likely not related

256

to metabolizing the limited amount of glucose in the detached retina.41 Interestingly, HK2 levels

257

drop precipitously 3 days after retinal detachment in WT animals. Likewise, when HK2 is

258

replaced by HK1 in Hk2 cKO retinas, a robust decrease of HK1 expression was also observed

259

after retinal detachment, in contrast to stable HK1 levels in WT retinas. These findings indicate

260

that HK levels are regulated in rod photoreceptors during stress. The exact mechanisms of how

261

HK2 production or degradation is regulated need to be explored further to fully understand its

262

role for neuroprotection. Regardless of what is precipitating HK2 loss, it may be an attempt to

263

catabolize intracellular proteins through autophagy to produce additional energy substrates and

264

prolong survival in a nutrient deficient state. The degradation of HK2 during metabolic stress

265

may disturb the intricate balance of apoptotic inhibition and energy production, uncoupling

metabolic stress from cell death signaling and increasing the sensitivity of photoreceptors to

268

beneficial for boosting photoreceptor survival during nutrient deprivation.

retinas still developed an age-related phenotype. Similar to a previous report, we observed rod

271

dysfunction in older Hk2 cKO mice as measured by ERG.26 The functional phenotype identified

272

by Petit and colleagues was not associated with any morphological change in retinal structure.

273

In contrast, we show that rod ERG dysfunction was associated with significant outer retinal

274

abnormalities anatomically. This difference may be due to variations in genetic background

275

between the two Hk2 cKO strains. We screened our animals for the rd8 mutation to rule out the

276

possibility of background degeneration and found that our Hk2 cKO animals lack the rd8 allele.

277

In addition, the phenotype of the rd8 mutation has a very rapid onset, around 6 weeks of age,

278

and is characterized by focal retinal folds, pseudorosettes, and retinal degeneration.42 The

279

phenotype observed in the HK2 cKO mice here was a slowly progressing degeneration and is

280

not characteristic of the rd8 mutation or other common background degenerative retinal

281

diseases in mice.42

282

Our results suggest that HK2 has an essential function in preserving photoreceptors

283

during aging. The time points we examined demonstrate that the onset of retinal degeneration in

284

HK2 cKO animals is delayed. Our functional analysis by ERG and in vivo anatomic analysis by

285

OCT at 5 months of age show that the overall retinal health is normal at this time. Thus, any

286

potential degeneration was below the threshold of detection or had not begun yet. Yet, by 10

287

months of age there was a dramatic decrease in ONL and OSEL thickness. Interestingly, others

288

have shown that the transcriptional profile of rod photoreceptors begins to change by 5 months

289

of age.43 Parapuram and colleagues found differential regulation of genes belonging to many

290

different signaling cascades, including apoptosis, as animals age. At the same time,

291

photoreceptors begin to accumulate significant oxidative damage with age, which may become

292

toxic and increase apoptotic signaling.44 The combination of a loss of HK2, changes in gene

293

regulation, and the accumulation of oxidative injury may result in an imbalance in apoptotic

294

signaling leading to delayed photoreceptor degeneration in our mouse model. Further studies

295

are needed to determine the time course of photoreceptor degeneration in the Hk2 cKO animals

296

with age and investigate the enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of HK2 in aging

297

photoreceptor cells.

298

Based on our data, we propose the following model for HK2 function in photoreceptors

299

(Fig. 6). During nutrient homeostasis, HK2 is equally distributed between the cytosolic and

300

mitochondrial compartments. After retinal detachment, glucose levels drop precipitously. This

301

results in a redistribution of HK2 to the mitochondrial fraction. At the same time, AKT is

302

activated, phosphorylating HK2 and enhancing its binding to VDAC. This then serves to prevent

303

the binding of pro-apoptotic factors to the mitochondria and prevent apoptotic signaling. Since

304

the total amount of HK2 drops significantly after retinal detachment, the neuroprotective effect of

305

HK2 mediated by mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis may be limited. Determining the

306

interactions between AKT/VDAC/HK2 in the retina will be important for verifying this model.

307

These experiments will enhance our understanding of the role of HK2 in both anti-apoptotic and

308

pro-survival functions in photoreceptors.

309

We previously showed that reprogramming photoreceptor metabolism via modulating a

310

key regulatory enzyme of aerobic glycolysis, PKM2, is a novel therapeutic strategy. Data

311

presented in this study demonstrate that modulating the other critical regulator of aerobic

312

glycolysis, HK2, may also increase photoreceptor survival during metabolic stress, potentially

313

secondary to its non-enzymatic functions. Determining the exact role of HK2 during nutrient

314

stress has the potential to reveal novel molecular pathways that can be targeted for

315

photoreceptor neuroprotection.

Methods

317

Animals

318

All animals were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and

319

Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

320

The protocol was approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the

321

University of Michigan (Protocol number: PRO00007463). All animals were maintained at room

322

temperature in a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice harboring a floxed Hk2 gene were a gift from

323

Dr. Mohanish Deshmukh and Dr. Timothy Gershon.25 These mice were crossed to mice carrying

324

a Cre-recombinase gene under the control of the rhodopsin promoter.24 The mice were

325

maintained on a C57BL/6 background and were confirmed to not carry the rd8 mutation.

326

Hk2wt/wt;Rho-Cre+(Wildtype, WT) and Hk2fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ (conditional knockout, cKO) mice were

327

generated.

328

Sub-cellular Fractionation

329

Rodent retinas were isolated from euthanized animals using the “Cut and Pick” (or Winkling)

330

method while being careful to avoid collecting RPE.45 The retinas were fractionated into

331

cytosolic and post-cytosolic fractions using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Tissues

332

(Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA; Cat# 87790) following a modified manufacturer’s

333

protocol. Two retinas were pooled for each sample and homogenized in cytoplasmic extraction

334

buffer (CEB) supplemented with protease (Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Fisher

335

Scientific, Cat# 87787) and phosphatase (Halt™ Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo Fisher

336

Scientific, Cat# 78420) inhibitors using 30-40 strokes with the “B” pestle of a Dounce

337

homogenizer. Lysate was then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 10,000 relative centrifugal

338

force (RCF). The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was saved and the pellet was sonicated at

339

20% amplitude with 1 second on/off pulse for 10 seconds in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher

341

then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 10,000RCF. The supernatant (mitochondrial enriched

342

fraction) was saved and the pellet was discarded.

343
344

The 661 W photoreceptor cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Muayyad Al-Ubaidi.46 2x106

345

661W cells were seeded 24 hours prior to treatment. Cells were fractionated using the

346

Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 78840)

347

as above except cells were trypsinized, pelleted, rinsed with 1X phosphate buffered saline

348

(PBS), re-pelleted before being resuspended in CEB for a 10-minute incubation at 4°C. The

349

remaining steps were identical. Cells were cultured as described previously and treated with

350

DMSO or LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology; Denver, MA, USA, Cat# 9901, 150µM, 5mL) in

351

glucose-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat # 11966025) supplemented with 5.5mM

352

Glucose for 1.5 hours prior to fractionation.47 Whole cell lysates were also collected to verify

353

loss of p-AKT after 1.5 hours of LY294002 treatment.

354

Caspase Activation and Cell Viability Assays

355

661W cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in each well of a 96-well plate then

356

treated 24 hours later with DMSO, 50µM LY294002, or media alone for 6 hours. Caspase

357

activity was assayed using the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 or 8 Assay System (Promega; Madison, WI,

358

USA, Cat# G8090 or G8200) and cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo®

359

Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Cat# G7570) following the manufacturer’s supplied

360

instructions. Briefly, cells were treated for the desired length of time and then prepared reagent

361

was added directly to each assay well, including blank wells containing media alone or media

362

containing either DMSO or LY294002. The reaction was allowed to incubate for 15 minutes

363

before assaying using a luminometer.

364

Western Blotting

365

After harvest, retinas were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and

366

phosphatase inhibitors. Homogenization was performed using a sonicator set at 20% amplitude

367

with 1 second on/off pulse for 10 seconds followed by centrifugation at 10,000RCF at 4°C for 10

368

minutes. Clarified lysates had protein content estimated using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay

369

Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 23225). 15µg of total protein was diluted in Laemmli buffer

370

(Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA USA, Cat# 1610747) supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (Millipore-

371

Sigma; St. Louis, MO USA, Cat# M6250). Denatured protein samples were run on 4–20% or

372

10% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gel (Bio-Rad, Cat# 4561094). Protein was

373

transferred using either a wet-transfer (100V for 1 hour at 4°C) or the Trans-Blot® Turbo™

374

Transfer System (25V for 30 minutes) (Bio-Rad, Cat# 1704150). After transfer, the PVDF

375

membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered Saline (Bio-Rad,

376

Cat# 1706435) supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 28320)).

377

Primary antibodies were diluted according to Table 1 in 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA;

378

(Millipore-Sigma, Cat# A9647)) in TBS-T and blocked membranes were incubated overnight at

379

4°C with gentle agitation. Membranes were then washed and incubated with appropriate

380

secondary antibody diluted in 5% BSA in TBST for 1 hour at room temperature. Protein bands

381

were detected using the SuperSignal™ West Dura/Femto Extended Duration Substrate

382

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 34075 and 34094) with an Azure c500 imaging system (Azure

383

Biosystems; Dublin, CA USA). Densitometry was performed using the Azure Spot program

384

(Azure Biosystems; Dublin, CA USA).

385

Immunofluorescence

386

Mouse eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences; Warrington, PA,

387

USA, Cat# 18814) overnight at 4°C. Fixed eyes were embedded in paraffin and sectioned 6µm

procedures. Blocking was performed with 1% BSA in PBST supplemented with 10% Normal

390

Goat Serum (NGS) for 1 hour before adding primary antibody (Table 1) diluted in 1% BSA

391

supplemented with 1% NGS overnight at 4°C. Slides were then washed in PBS and then with

392

1% BSA in PBST supplemented with 1% NGS before appropriate secondary antibody was

393

added (Table 1) and slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, slides were

394

washed with PBS and counterstained with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI

395

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# P36930). Slides were imaged using a Leica DM6000

396

microscope with a 40X objective.

397

qRT-PCR

398

Retinas were extracted as described above and immediately immersed in RNAlater (Qiagen;

399

Hilden, Germany, Cat# 76104). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,

400

Cat# 74104) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality were assessed

401

with a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 400 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed

402

using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, Cat# 330401). Transcriptional changes in metabolic

403

pathways was assessed using the RT2 Profiler PCR Array for Mouse Glucose Metabolism

404

(Qiagen, Cat# 330231 PAMM-006ZA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 102uL of cDNA

405

was pre-mixed with 650uL of 2X SYBR Green master mix (Qiagen, Cat# 330503) and 548uL of

406

ddH2O. 10uL of each pre-mix was added to each well of the 384 well plate following the

407

manufacturer’s instructions. The plates were thermocycled using a CFX384 thermocycler (Bio-

408

Rad) following the provided cycling parameters. The geometric mean of the Ct values for Actb,

409

Gapdh, and Hsp90ab1 was used for relative quantitation using the 2^-ΔΔCt method.

410

Functional Assessment

411

Functional assessment of mouse vision was performed as described previously.7 Total retinal

412

function was measured using electroretinography (ERG). Mice were anesthetized and the ERG

413

response was measured using the Diagnosys Celeris ERG system (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell,

414

MA, USA). In vivo retinal thickness was assessed using the Envisu-R SD-OCT imager (Leica

415

Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Average thickness of various retinal layers was

416

assessed using Diver 1.0 (Leica Microsystems Inc). Four points 200µm from the optic nerve

417

head were used to measure layer thickness and the results were averaged. Total retinal

418

thickness (TRT), outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and outer segment equivalent length

419

(OSEL) were determined. OSEL is defined as the length from the ends of the inner segment

420

boundary to the surface of the RPE.7,48

421

Retinal Detachment, TUNEL Staining, and ONL Counts

422

Experimental neurosensory retinal detachment was induced in mice as described previously.7

423

Briefly, animals were anesthetized and a sclerotomy was performed using a 25G micro-

424

vitrealretinal blade. A 35G beveled cannula (World Precision Instruments; Sarasota, FL, USA,

425

Cat# NF35BV-2), attached to a NanoFil-100 syringe (World Precision Instruments, Cat#

426

NANOFIL-100) was used to inject 2-3µL of Healon (1% Hyaluronic Acid) (Abbott Medical Optics;

427

Santa Ana, CA, USA, Cat# 05047450842) between the photoreceptor and RPE layers. Care

428

was taken to detach approximately half of the retina in each animal. Only the sclerotomy was

429

performed on the fellow eye as a control. After 3 days, animals were sacrificed and whole eyes

430

were extracted and embedded in paraffin for sectioning as described above. TUNEL staining

431

was performed using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega Cat# G3250) and

432

sections were counterstained using ProLong Gold Mountant with DAPI. Stained sections were

433

imaged with a Leica DM6000 microscope using a 40X objective. TUNEL positive cells were

434

manually counted across the detached portion of the retina. Counts were normalized to the total

435

number of nuclei in the outer nuclear layer in the detached region, counted manually or with an

436

automated cell counting macro using ImageJ.7,47

438

Total Retinal Lactate was quantified using the Lactate Assay Kit (Millipore-Sigma, Cat #

439

MAK064) following the manufacturer’s supplied protocol. Animals were euthanized and neural

440

retina was extracted as described above and briefly washed in PBS to remove any adhered

441

vitreous. The retinas from both eyes of each animal were pooled and homogenized using the

442

provided Lactate Assay Buffer. A sample of homogenate was retained for total protein

443

quantification to normalize samples before de-proteinization using the Amicon Ultra-0.5

444

Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore-Sigma, Cat # UFC501024), which has a molecular weight cut-off

445

of 10kDa. 10µL of sample was loaded in duplicate for both the colorimetric and fluorometric

446

assay. A standard lactate concentration curve was plotted for each assay and the concentration

447

of each sample was determined from this curve. The concentration of lactate (ng/µL) was

448

normalized by the total sample protein concentration.

449

Statistical Analysis

450

Statistical analysis was performed comparing WT to cKO samples using a two-tailed student’s t-

451

test with either Excel or Prism 7.0. Results with a p-value < 0.05 were considered significant.
