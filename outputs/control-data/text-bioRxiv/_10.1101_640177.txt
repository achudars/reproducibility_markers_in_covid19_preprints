Abstract
Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with
photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are
sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality.
Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor
NF-κB as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have
further investigated a possible role for NF-κB in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various
strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results
show that NF-κB expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae
strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming
growth factor β, also led to decreased NF-κB expression. We also show that aposymbiotic
Aiptasia (with high NF-κB expression) have increased survival following infection with the
pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-κB
expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly
clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-κB expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as
compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly,
genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-

κB target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or
immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that
modulation of NF-κB and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarianSymbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.

Introduction
Many corals and anemones in the phylum Cnidaria engage in mutualistic symbioses with
photosynthetic intracellular dinoflagellate algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae (Muscatine and
Porter, 1977; LaJeunesse et al., 2018). Different cnidarians preferentially form symbioses with
distinct algal strains (Rodriguez-Lanetty et al., 2004; LaJeunesse, 2005; Coffroth et al., 2010;
Hambleton et al., 2014; Wolfowicz et al., 2016), although the mechanisms determining this
selectivity remain poorly understood. Disruption of coral-algal symbioses (i.e., “bleaching”), as
caused by a variety of environmental factors including ocean warming, can lead to extensive
coral mortality (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Weis, 2008; Weis, 2010; Hughes et al., 2018).
Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the molecular and cellular processes
controlling the establishment, maintenance, and loss of algal symbiosis in cnidarians.
Corals show variable sensitivities to thermal stress based on a variety of factors including
coral host genotype (Bay and Palumbi 2014; Dixon et al., 2015), symbiotic algal partner
(Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006; Oliver and Palumbi, 2011; Barshis et al., 2013), and
location/thermal history (Barshis et al., 2013; Davies et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the molecular
mechanisms regulating both host-symbiont selection and thermal sensitivity are not well
understood. That said, the immunosuppressive host cytokine transforming growth factor β
(TGFβ) has been proposed to play a role in facilitating the establishment of symbiosis in
cnidarians, based on experiments with both the sea anemone Aiptasia and the coral Fungia
scutaria (Detournay et al., 2012; Berthelier at al., 2017).
We have had an ongoing interest in immune signaling in cnidarians, specifically in the
study of immune transcription factor NF-κB and its roles in pathogen infection, embryonic
development, and symbiosis (Gilmore and Wolenski, 2012; Wolenski et al., 2013; Brennan et al.,

2017; Mansfield et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2018). We and others have shown that the
expression and activity of NF-κB are modulated during the onset of symbiosis and after loss of
symbiosis in both Aiptasia (Wolfowicz et al., 2016; Mansfield et al., 2017) and the coral
Acropora palmata (DeSalvo et al., 2010). For example, Mansfield et al. (2017) demonstrated that
the establishment of algal symbiosis in naïve Aiptasia larvae is associated with a reduction in
NF-κB expression and that heat-induced loss of symbiosis in adult Aiptasia is associated with
increased NF-κB expression and DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, genomic analyses have
shown that symbiotic cnidarians, such as the coral Pocillopora damicornis (Cunning et al.,
2018), have extensive repertoires of immune signaling genes.

Based on these data, we

hypothesized that algal symbionts can modulate host NF-κB expression to effect a decrease in
host immunity to allow for the establishment of symbiosis (Mansfield et al., 2017; Mansfield and
Gilmore, 2019).
Herein, we have used Aiptasia and P. damicornis to further investigate Symbiodiniaceaeinduced downregulation of NF-κB, as well as the implications of decreased NF-κB levels and
symbiont type for cnidarian immunity and susceptibility to heat-induced bleaching. Our results
provide further evidence for a role of NF-κB in immunity and stress responses in some, but not
all, cnidarian-symbiont interactions, and further suggest that different algal types affect distinct
host pathways for the establishment of stable symbioses.

Materials and Methods
Cnidarians and strains of Symbiodiniaceae
Adult Aiptasia used in these studies include the clonal CC7 (Sunagawa et al., 2009), H2
(Xiang et al., 2013), and PLF3 (Pringle lab stock) strains, as well as strain VW9 (a gift from V.

Weis, Oregon State University) and anemones purchased from Carolina Biological. CC7 harbors
clade A (genus Symbiodinium) algae from which the clonal, axenic strain SSA01 was derived
(Bieri et al., 2016). H2 harbors a homogenous or nearly homogenous population of clade B
(genus Breviolum) algae from which the clonal, axenic strain SSB01 was derived (Xiang et al.,
2013). Other algae used include the clonal, axenic Symbiodinium SSA03 and clade E (genus
Effrenium) SSE01 strains (Xiang et al., 2013; Hambleton et al., 2014), and the clade D (genus
Durusdinium) strains Mf2.2b, A001, and Ap2 (all obtained from Mary Alice Coffroth). For
routine maintenance, adult Aiptasia were kept in approximately 150 ml of 32 ppt artificial
seawater (ASW) in glass or polycarbonate bowls at ~22°C with light provided by Sylvania GroLux (GRO/Aq/RP) fluorescent bulbs at 20 μmol photons/m2/sec with a 12-h light:12-h dark
cycle. Long-term aposymbiotic CC7 anemones (used in Western blots and EMSAs) had been
maintained aposymbiotic for >3 years in light-proof tanks. Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic
anemones were fed Artemia three times per week with water changes after feeding.
To generate adult Aiptasia lines harboring different algal strains, aposymbiotic CC7
anemones were infected with strain SSB01, Mf2.2b, A001, or Ap2. Infections were monitored
by fluorescence microscopy for the presence and persistence of algal cells (detected by their
chlorophyll fluorescence) within anemone tissue. The various symbiotic anemones were reared
long-term (>1 year) under 25 μmol photons/m2/sec with a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle.
Quantification of algal densities in these stable anemones was performed as described previously
(Krediet et al., 2014) using a Guava Flow Cytometer (Millipore) to count algal cells and
normalizing algal numbers to total protein measured using a Thermo Scientific Pierce BCA
assay (ThermoFisher).

For experiments comparing sensitivity to bacterial infection, aposymbiotic anemones
were generated by treatment of symbiotic anemones with 0.58 mM menthol as described
previously (Mansfield et al., 2017). Briefly, anemones were incubated in the dark with daily
changes of menthol-containing ASW for three 24-h treatment periods. After menthol treatment,
anemones were placed into fresh aerated ASW and acclimated for at least two weeks before
being used in assays.
To generate naturally aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae, adult CC7 (male) and PLF3 (female)
were spawned essentially as described previously (Grawunder et al., 2015). Larvae were reared
in glass finger bowls in ASW until 3–4 days post-fertilization under 25 µmol photons m−2 s−1 on
a 12-h light:12-h dark schedule at 27°C. Prior to infections, cultured algal cells (of strain SSA01,
SSB01, SSA03, SSE01, or Mf2.2b) were rinsed three times with ASW followed by
centrifugation at 3000 × g, resuspension, and counting using the Guava Flow Cytometer.
Infections were performed at 50,000 algal cells/ml for 5 d in 50 ml of ASW.
The three Pocillopora damicornis colonies used in these studies had been maintained in
common garden conditions (>5 years) at Boston University under an 8 h:16 h light/dark
schedule.

Determining NF-κB expression levels in Aiptasia larvae
For experiments assessing the ability of different algal strains to infect Aiptasia larvae
and affect host NF-κB expression, larvae were infected and analyzed by fluorescence confocal
microscopy, essentially as described previously (Mansfield et al., 2017). That is, larvae were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 4 h at room temperature (RT), and after washing, samples were
processed for antigen retrieval by incubating at 80°C for 30 min in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 8.5

containing 0.05% Tween. Fixed larval samples were blocked with PBS containing 0.3% Triton,
5% goat serum, and 1% BSA for 1 h at RT. Samples were then incubated overnight at RT with
primary rabbit anti-Aiptasia-NF-κB antiserum (1:10,000) and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin
(Cell Signaling; 1:600) antiserum. Samples were next incubated with Alexa Fluor 488conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antiserum (Invitrogen; 1:600) and Alexa Fluor 649conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antiserum (Invitrogen; 1:600) for 1.5 h at RT.
Samples were then stained with 5µM Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Stained larvae were
imaged using channels for Alexa Flour 488 (for NF-κB), Alexa Fluor 649 (for α-tubulin), DAPI
(nuclei), and mCherry (algal cell autofluorescence). Algal cells in the larvae (either in the gastric
cavity or in gastrodermal cells) were counted manually by scanning through the z-planes.
Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) of NF-κB was quantified using ImageJ. For each
image, larvae were outlined using the circle tool and then area, integrated density, and mean gray
value were measured; for background fluorescence, the mean gray value of an area outside the
larvae was measured. CTCF was calculated by the formula (CTCF = Integrated Density – [Area
× Mean gray value of background]). Statistical significance was assessed using an unpaired, twotailed t-test.

Analysis of Aiptasia larvae treated with Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ)
Approximately 300 naïve, aposymbiotic larvae were treated with 200 ng/ml of human
TGFβ1 (Sigma, T7039) in 500 µl of ASW at RT for approximately 18 h. Larvae were then
either fixed for immunohistochemical staining (as above) or pooled (200 larvae per treatment
group) for mRNA extraction using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) protocol with 10 µl of
TRIzol. For qPCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 µg of RNA for each sample. RNA was combined

with nuclease-free water to a final volume of 17.4 µl. cDNA synthesis was initiated by adding
the following reaction components to the RNA: 5 µl of 10x RT Buffer (Applied Biosystems), 11
µl 25 mM MgCl2, 10 µl dNTP, 2.5 µl random hexamers, 3.1 µl

MultiScribe Reverse

Transcriptase (ThermoFisher), and 1 µl RNAse inhibitor (Applied Biosystems). Samples were
incubated for 10 min at 25°C, 60 min at 37°C, and 5 min at 95°C. cDNA samples were used as
templates for qPCR with each reaction having 2.5 µl PowerUP SYBR Green (Applied
Biosystems), 0.5 µl (final concentration 200 nM) forward primer, 0.5 µl (200 nM) reverse
primer, 1.25 µl dH2O, 0.25 µl cDNA. qPCR primers are listed in Table S1. Reactions were
performed in triplicate and each primer pair included a no-template control. Reactions were
carried out in standard mode on a 7900-HT Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using
the following conditions: 2 min activation at 50°C, 2 min Dual-Lock DNA polymerase activation
at 95°C, and 40 cycles of denaturation and annealing/extension at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1
min, respectively. Dissociation curves were generated by 15 sec incubation at 95°C, 15 sec
incubation at 60°C, and then ramping from 60°C to 95°C at a 2% ramp rate.
Expression data were analyzed by the ∆∆Ct method (Livak and Schmitgen, 2001). For
each pooled-larvae sample performed in triplicate, average Ct values for the target gene (Aiptasia
NF-κB) and reference gene (60S Ribosomal protein L10; RPL10) were calculated. The average
Ct value for RPL10 was then subtracted from the value for NF-κB to obtain ∆Ct for control and
treated groups. ∆Ct values for controls were then subtracted from ∆Ct for treated larvae to obtain

∆∆Ct. Fold change in NF-κB mRNA was determined by 2−∆∆Ct. Average fold change was
quantified from two experimental trials and statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired
two-tailed t-test (p<0.05 for significance).

Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)
Lysates from adult Aiptasia used for EMSAs and from P. damicornis coral branches used
for Western Blotting were prepared in AT lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20
mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 20% v/v glycerol, 1% w/v Triton X-100, 20
mM NaF, 1 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Specifically, individual
Aiptasia polyps that had been flash-frozen on dry ice/ethanol and stored at -80ºC were
homogenized with a plastic pestle on ice in 100 µl of AT lysis buffer, and samples were then
incubated on ice for 20 min. P. damicornis branches were incubated in 1 ml of the buffer for 1 h
at 4 °C on a rotator. In both cases, samples were next passed up and down through a 27.5-gauge
needle to further disrupt tissue, and then supplemented with 4 M NaCl to a final concentration of
150 mM. Algal cells and debris were removed from samples by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for
30 min at 4°C. Lysates containing equalized amounts of protein were then used for Western
blotting or EMSA as described below.
Lysates of adult Aiptasia used for Western blotting were prepared by homogenizing
whole anemones in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with a pestle in 2x SDS sample buffer (0.125
M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 4.6% w/v SDS, 20% w/v glycerol, 10% v/v β-mercaptoethanol). For
Western blotting with P. damicornis, lysates prepared as described above were adjusted to a final
concentration of 1x SDS buffer. In both cases, samples were heated at ~95°C for 10 min
followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at RT for 10 min to remove insoluble material.
Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose overnight to ensure full transfer of high molecular weight proteins.
Nitrocellulose filters were probed with our rabbit anti-Aiptasia-NF-κB antiserum (1:10,000

dilution; Mansfield et al., 2017) overnight at 4°C. (The antiserum cross-reacts with the highly
similar NF-κB from P. damicornis: Fig. S2.) After washing, filters were incubated with antirabbit IgG horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum at 1:4,000 dilution for 1 h at RT,
and immunoreactive bands were detected using X-ray film. To control for protein loading, filters
were then stripped and probed with mouse anti-α-tubulin antiserum (Cell Signaling #3873) at
1:5,000 for 30 min at RT and then anti-mouse IgG horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary
antiserum. NF-κB bands were normalized to α-tubulin bands, and normalized values for
biological replicates were averaged. Unpaired t-tests were used to test for significant differences
between control and treatment groups.
EMSAs were performed as described by Mansfield et al. (2017). Briefly, a doublestranded NF-κB-site probe (GGGAATTCCC) was end labeled with [γ-32P]-ATP (Perkin Elmer)
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). For binding reactions using Aiptasia
lysates in AT lysis buffer (see above), approximately 20-30 μg of total protein and 200,000 cpm
of radiolabeled NF-κB-site probe were used. Reactions were carried out in binding buffer (10
mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 4% w/v glycerol) for 30 min at
30°C. Samples were then electrophoresed on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and dried
gels were subjected to autoradiography.

Survival of Aiptasia following infection with the bacterium Serratia marcescens
An S. marcescens culture was obtained from Kim Ritchie (University of South Carolina
Beaufort). Single bacterial colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml portions of Luria Broth (LB),
and cultures were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking. The next day, the bacterial cells were
pelleted, washed three times in ASW, resuspended in fresh ASW, and diluted to a visible light

absorbance of ~0.25. Ten-ml portions of diluted bacterial cells (~1.9 x 108 cells/ml) were used to
infect individual anemones in single wells of a six-well tissue culture plate. Infected anemones
were observed daily for 7 d, and anemones were then moved to new six-well plates containing
10 ml of fresh ASW for a two-week recovery period. Anemones were then scored as alive or
dead based on tentacle regrowth and anemone movement when touched. Statistical significance
of survival vs. lethality was assessed using an unpaired t-test.

Quantification of bleaching susceptibility in Aiptasia and P. damicornis
For the bleaching experiments with Aiptasia, CC7 anemones–-harboring either their
native symbiont or an introduced algal strain (see above)–-were heat stressed at 34oC for 6 d.
Heat stress was initiated by placing tanks containing the anemones in 1 L of ASW at 27ºC
directly into a 34oC incubator (25 μmol photons/m2/sec with a 12-h light:12-h dark cycle) and
allowing the water temperature to rise (over several hours) to 34ºC. In each of several replicate
experiments, five to eight anemones per strain were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 d, and algal cells
were counted and normalized to total protein for each animal, as described above. To identify
differences in bleaching rate among the strains, we used a generalized linear model identifying
effects of anemone strain, time at 34oC, and the interaction between anemone strain and time at
34oC with these normalized algal counts. Significant pair-wise P-values from the interaction
term indicate differences in bleaching rate between strains.
For P. damicornis, we first confirmed the species identification and characterized the
Symbiodiniaceae communities. Fragments (~1 cm3) were collected from each of the three
colonies, placed in DNA-isolation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM
EDTA, 0.5 % SDS, 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K), and DNA was isolated as described previously

(Davies et al., 2013). 20 ng of DNA was then used to amplify the ITS2 locus (Baumann et al.
2018) and the 18S rRNA gene (Stoeck et al., 2010). Samples were cleaned using GeneJET PCR
Purification Kit (ThermoFisher), barcoded via 6 bp dual-indexing, and then pooled and
sequenced at Tuft’s TUCF Genomics on an Illumina MiSeq (2 x 250 bp).
ITS2 analyses of the Symbiodiniaceae communities used the R package dada2 (Callahan
et al., 2016, with modifications outlined by Kenkel and Bay, 2018). Raw read counts ranged
between 88,964 and 154,975, and after dada2 processing, the ASV table resulted in per-sample
counts ranging from 68,616 to 91,051 (File S2). Symbiodiniaceae taxonomy was assigned using
the ITS2 GeoSymbio reference database (Franklin et al., 2012) using the R package Phyloseq
(McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). The 30 most abundant ITS2 types were plotted for visualization,
but all ASV counts are presented in File S2. To confirm the coral species, 18S sequences were
merged and de-replicated using usearch (Edgar, 2010) and were assigned to taxonomic genus
based on BLAST matches (Altschul et al., 1997) against nonredundant (nr) NCBI database
sequences (Geer et al., 2010). All scripts are available at Github.com/NicolaKriefall/Pdam.
For the coral bleaching experiments, six 6-cm3 fragments were collected from each of the
three colonies (18 fragments, n=9 per treatment). Fragments were randomly assigned to one of
two treatments (control: 28°C; thermal stress: 32°C) such that each colony was represented in
each replicate tank (n=3 per treatment). Fragments were acclimated for two days at 28°C after
which thermal stress treatment (32°C) was achieved by two days of ramping at 2°C per day.
Corals were maintained in 20 gallon aquaria with ASW (Instant Ocean) at 35 ppt, and light
levels were standardized at 200 µmol photons m-2 s-1 using AquaIllumination Hydra TwentySix
HD LED aquarium lights. Temperature and salinity were measured daily.

Two experimental trials were conducted: one for five and one for seven days, until two
colonies exhibited strongly bleached phenotypes (Fig. 4A). Final photos were then obtained and
fragments were immediately subsampled for RNA (200 proof ethanol) and protein (AT lysis
buffer), and the remaining fragment was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for algal density
quantification. To assess bleaching, the color intensity of coral tissue was quantified from
photographs of control and heated corals at the final time point of the experiment (Winters et al.,
2009). Photographs contained a Coral Health Chart (CoralWatch) as a color standard. After
white standardization, red, green, and blue color channel values (arbitrary units [au]) were
obtained at 10 randomly placed points on each fragment. To obtain algal cell densities, ~1 cm3
branches were collected from each coral fragment, and tissue was extracted using an airbrush
and ASW. Following tissue homogenization, algae in three 10-µl replicates were counted using a
hemocytometer, and algal counts were normalized to fragment surface area using the aluminum
foil method (Marsh, 1970). All statistical analyses were implemented in R (R Core Team, 2017)
using the ANOVA function based on the sum of all color channels and normalized symbiont
densities. Differences in colony responses across experimental treatments were evaluated for
significance using post-hoc Tukey’s HSD tests.

Gene expression profiling and differential expression analyses
For gene expression analyses, total RNA from corals under control conditions from the
first experimental bleaching trial (n=9) was isolated and treated with DNase using an
RNAqueous kit protocol (Ambion, Life Technologies). Approximately 1 µg of RNA per sample
was then prepared for tag-based RNA-seq as described by Meyer et al. (2011), with several
modifications to account for the transition to the Illumina sequencing platform (Dixon et al.,

2015; Lohman et al., 2016). Eight of nine libraries were successfully prepared and sequenced on
the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at Tuft’s TUCF Genomics yielding single-end (SE) 50 bp reads.
62.1 million raw reads were generated, with individual library counts of 5.7 to 10 million
reads (mean = 7.8 million reads). Fastx toolkit was used to remove 5’-Illumina leader sequences
and poly(A)+ tails, and sequences <20 bp in length and with <90% of bases having quality cutoff
scores <20 were also trimmed. In addition, because degenerate bases were incorporated during
cDNA synthesis, PCR duplicates were identified and removed from all libraries as described by
Dixon et al. (2015). After quality filtering, the resulting quality filtered reads were mapped to the
P. damicornis genome (Cunning et al., 2018) using Bowtie2.2.0 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012),
which yielded a counts file (File S1). Sample counts ranged from 1.0 to 2.1 million (mean = 1.5
million counts).
Differential gene expression analyses were performed with DESeq2 v. 1.6.3 (Love et al.,
2014) using the model: design = ~ colony. Counts were normalized, and then independent
pairwise contrasts were computed across all three colony comparisons (1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 3).
Genes identified as differentially expressed were corrected for false positives using the
Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) false discovery rate (FDR) correction (adjusted P-value < 0.05)
and genes that were consistently up- or down-regulated in each coral colony across both pairwise
comparisons were determined (Files S3-8). Gene expression results for genes consistently
overexpressed in colony 3 were then visualized using the R package pheatmap. Expression data
were then rlog-normalized to broadly characterize differences in gene expression across colonies
using a principal component analysis and a multivariate analysis of variance function (Adonis)
using the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2016).

Analysis of genes upregulated in P. damicornis heat-resistant colony 3
Genes significantly upregulated (FDR p<0.05) in colony 3 were analyzed for
upregulation in heat and other stress conditions by a literature search (see Table S2). To identify
potential NF-κB binding sites in P. damicornis genomic sequences, the 500 bp upstream of the
transcription start sites in genes of interest in the P. damicornis genome (Cunning et al., 2018)
were examined for the presence of predicted NF-κB binding sites using Aiptasia NF-κB’s DNAbinding site preference (based on protein binding microarray (PBM) analyses in Mansfield et al.,
(2017) (sequences in File S9).

Results
Downregulation of NF-κB expression in Aiptasia larvae by Symbiodiniaceae strain SSB01 but
not by several other strains
In a survey of wild anemones, Aiptasia was found to be symbiotic with Symbiodiniaceae
strains in several genera (Thornhill et al., 2013; LaJeunesse et al., 2018). The clonal CC7
anemone line contains largely or entirely algae of strain SSA01 (Symbiodinium sp.) (Sunagawa
et al., 2009; Bieri et al., 2016), but can also be readily populated to high levels by strain SSB01
(Breviolum minutum) (Xiang et al., 2013; Hambleton et al., 2014; Baumgarten et al., 2015). It
cannot be stably populated with either the Symbiodinium strain SSA03 or the Effrenium voratum
(clade E) strain SSE01 (Hambleton et al., 2014; Wolfowicz et al., 2016). The clonal anemone
line PLF3 appears to contain a mixture of algal strains SSA01 and SSB01 (our unpublished
results). To determine whether algal strains with differing abilities to establish stable symbiosis
also have different effects on host NF-κB expression, we incubated Aiptasia larvae (from a cross
of strains CC7 and PLF3) for 5 d with strain SSA01, SSB01, SSA03, SSE01, or the previously

unexamined clade D (Durusdinium sp.) strain Mf2.2b. Larvae were then fixed, stained, and
imaged for NF-κB expression levels.
As an initial comparison, we also counted the number of algal cells within infected
larvae, based on their autofluorescence. As expected, strains SSA01 and SSB01 were found in
~90% of the larvae after a 5 d incubation, while strains SSE01 and SSA03 were found less
frequently (~57% and ~5%, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Although wild Aiptasia have not been found
to harbor Durusdinium algae, strain Mf2.2b was found in ~75% of the larvae (Fig. 1A). No algae
were detected in larvae prior to exposure to the cultured algae.
As compared to aposymbiotic larvae, NF-κB expression was reduced by 52% in larvae
hosting SSB01 (n=16, P<0.0001) (Figs. 1B, C). In contrast, larvae hosting native SSA01 or nonnative SSE01 or Mf2.2 showed no significant difference in NF-κB staining as compared to
aposymbiotic controls. NF-κB expression was also not significantly reduced in larvae incubated
with SSA03 algae, which were only rarely (<5%) observed in the larvae (Figs. 1B, C).

Downregulation of NF-κB expression in Aiptasia larvae by exogenous TGFβ
Previous data have suggested that the cytokine TGFβ can suppress immunity in adult
Aiptasia (Detournay et al., 2012), and therefore, we were interested in whether TGFβ could also
affect NF-κB in Aiptasia. Indeed, treatment of aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae with human TGFβ1
reduced NF-κB mRNA by 64% as compared to control larvae (p<0.05; Fig. 1D). Similarly,
human TGFβ1 treatment of Aiptasia larvae reduced NF-κB protein staining by 31% (n=40,
P<0.0001; Figs. 1E, F).

Downregulation of NF-κB expression in Aiptasia adults by Symbiodiniaceae strains SSB01 and
SSA01 but not by several Durusdinium (clade D) strains
To determine whether NF-κB expression is also affected in adult Aiptasia in an algal
strain-dependent manner, we compared NF-κB expression levels in CC7 anemones containing
their endogenous algae (largely or entirely strain SSA01) to anemones that had been fully
bleached (aposymbiotic) or had been bleached and then infected with strain SSB01 or with one
of three Durusdinium strains (Mf2.2b, A001, and Ap2).. These symbionts were chosen because
adult Aiptasia infected with SSB01 have reduced NF-κB levels (Mansfield et al., 2017); strains
SSA01 and SSB01 can be hosted at high levels in Aiptasia (Hambleton et al., 2014; Grawunder
et al., 2015; Wolfowicz et al., 2016; Fig. 2B); and non-native strains Mf2.2b, A001, and Ap2 can
establish stable symbioses, albeit at reduced population densities (Figs. 1B, C). By Western
blotting, we found that CC7-SSB01 and CC7-SSA01 had reduced levels of NF-κB as compared
to aposymbiotic Aiptasia (Fig. 2A). In contrast, CC7 infected with Mf2.2b, A001, or Ap2 had
NF-κB levels that were similar to those in aposymbiotic anemones (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether thermal tolerance correlates with pre-stress NF-κB or symbiont
levels across our Aiptasia strains, we subjected these five symbiotic Aiptasia strains to heat stress
at 34oC (Fig. 2C). We found that CC7-SSB01, with low levels of NF-κB and high levels of algae,
bleached faster than all other strains tested (each pair-wise GLM interaction P < 1 x 10-16). In
contrast, CC7 with its endogenous algae (SSA01) or harboring any of the Durusdinium strains
they bleached at similar rates (Fig. 2C), even though they differed markedly in both steady-state
algal population levels and NF-κB levels (Figs. 2A, B). Thus, neither steady-state algal
population densities nor NF-κB levels appeared to correlate with susceptibility to thermal
bleaching in Aiptasia.

Increased resistance to a bacterial pathogen of aposymbiotic (high NF-κB) relative to symbiotic
(low NF-κB) Aiptasia
Due to the broad role of NF-κB in immunity in higher metazoans (Gilmore et al., 2016),
we hypothesized that NF-κB activity would be positively correlated with immune competence in
Aiptasia. To test this, we first compared NF-κB DNA-binding activity by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) in lysates of adult CC7 Aiptasia that were either aposymbiotic or
symbiotic with algal strain SSB01. Consistent with our measurement of NF-κB protein levels
(Fig. 2A), the aposymbiotic anemones had approximately three-fold more NF-κB DNA-binding
activity than symbiotic anemones (Figs. 3A, B). This result is similar to the reduced NF-κB
DNA-binding activity that we previously found with H2-SSBO1 anemones (Mansfield et al.,
2017).
We next compared the sensitivities to bacterial infection of four strains of symbiotic
Aiptasia relative to their aposymbiotic counterparts (generated by menthol treatment; see
Materials and Methods). All anemones were challenged with. S. marcescens, a bacterial
pathogen that causes white pox disease in wild coral (Sutherland et al., 2011) and lethality in
Aiptasia (Krediet et al., 2014). Anemone survival was assessed by observing the presence of
extended tentacles (Fig. 3C) and movement in response to touch by a plastic pipette. For each
anemone strain, the aposymbiotic animals showed better survival than the symbiotic animals
(Fig. 3D). When aggregated over all anemone strains, the difference in survival of anemones was
statistically significant: ~95% of aposymbiotic Aiptasia survived infection with S. marcescens,
whereas only ~17% of symbiotic Aiptasia survived (n=18, P<0.0001; Fig. 3D). These results

demonstrate a positive correlation between increased NF-κB levels and an increased ability to
survive pathogen challenge across several strains of Aiptasia.

Higher NF-κB levels and greater thermotolerance in a Pocillopora damicornis colony hosting
Durusdinium as compared to colonies hosting Cladocopium symbionts
We next investigated whether a thermosensitive coral also exhibits differences in NF-κB
levels when hosting different genera of Symbiodiniaceae. For these experiments, three
independent colonies of P. damicornis that had been maintained in common garden laboratory
conditions for >5 years, were used (Fig. 4A). 18S amplicon sequencing confirmed that all three
colonies belonged to the same Pocillopora species, as the top BLAST hit for all three colonies
was “Pocillopora damicornis partial 18S rRNA gene”, with a 100% query cover, sourced from
Arrigoni et al. (2017) (accession number: LT631138). Nevertheless, these colonies exhibited
distinct gene expression profiles as demonstrated by principal component analysis of all
transcripts (Fig. 5), suggesting that these colonies are genetically distinct. Algal cell counts
showed that the levels of symbionts in the three colonies were not significantly different (Fig.
4B). Metabarcoding of the ITS2 locus showed that colonies 1 and 2 were dominated by
Cladocopium (previously clade C) species, whereas colony 3 hosted primarily Durusdinium
species (Fig. 4C).
NF-κB expression was quantified by Western blotting of lysates from the three P.
damicornis colonies. Colony 3 (n=6) (hosting Durusdinium spp.) showed approximately 30-fold
more NF-κB as compared to colonies 1 (n=5, P=0.015) and 2 (n=6, P<0.005; Figs. 4D, E)
(hosting Cladocopium sp.).

We then asked if these distinct P. damicornis individuals showed differences in thermal
tolerance by raising the temperature from 28ºC to 32ºC for ~1 week. Colony 3 showed much less
bleaching than colonies 1 and 2 (Figs. 4A, F). Thus, the type of algal symbiont, the NF-κB
levels, or both may influence the levels of resistance to bleaching under heat stress in this coral
species.

Genes possibly involved in thermotolerance in P. damicornis
The data above suggested a correlation between high levels of NF-κB and resistance of P.
damicornis to heat-induced bleaching. To explore whether and how NF-κB might be involved in
thermotolerance, we used RNA-seq to identify transcripts that were differentially expressed in
colony 3 (thermotolerant, high NF-κB) vs. colonies 1 and 2 (thermosensitive, low NF-κB). We
identified 466 genes whose expression was increased and 441 genes whose expression was
decreased specifically in colony 3 (Files S6 and S7).
Because cnidarian NF-κB proteins can act as transcriptional activators (Wolenksi et al.,
2011; Mansfield et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2018), we focused on the 116 annotated transcripts
that were uniquely upregulated in colony 3 (Fig. 6). A GO enrichment analysis of these genes did
not identify any over-represented biological processes, cellular components, or molecular
functions. However, a literature-based search using the 116 annotated genes upregulated in
colony 3 revealed that 15 (13%) have previously been reported to be upregulated during heat
stress in some biological system, and 53 (46%) have been reported to be upregulated by some
form of cellular stress (Table S2).
Others have proposed that stress-response genes may be “frontloaded” in thermoresistant
corals, thus providing protection upon the onset of stress (Barshis et al., 2013; Brener-Raffalli et

al., 2018). Among the 116 annotated genes showing increased expression in colony 3, two
(creld2, "cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2", and von Willebrand factor A domaincontaining 8) were reported previously to be frontloaded in wild populations of Pocillopora
(Brener-Raffalli et al., 2018). Each of these genes has one predicted NF-κB binding site within
500 bp of its transcriptional start site (Fig. S3). Two additional genes (Pd-cyst-rich and PdDPP7) were previously reported to be substantially downregulated by heat-induced bleaching in
P. damicornis (Vidal-Dupoil et al., 2009). Namely, in two-week bleaching experiments, Pd-cystrich was down-regulated by approximately 100-fold and Pd-DPP7 was less robustly downregulated (Vidal-Dupoil et al., 2009). Within 500 bp upstream of their transcriptional start sites,
Pd-cyst-rich has two predicted NF-κB binding sites, and Pd-DPP7 has three such sites (Fig. S3).

Discussion
In this study, we have characterized the expression and activity of transcription factor
NF-κB in two cnidarians for its possible role in symbiosis, immunity, and thermal tolerance.
Although NF-κB has well-documented roles in immune- and stress-related processes in
triploblasts, this is the first study to provide experimental evidence suggesting a role of NF-κB in
resistance to bacterially induced disease and thermal stress-induced bleaching in cnidarians.
Overall, our results suggest that the relationship between suppression of NF-κB during the
establishment of symbiosis in Aiptasia larvae or the maintenance of symbiosis in adult Aiptasia
is the result of a complex interaction between the symbiont and the host.
We previously showed that hosting of the algal symbiont SSB01 by Aiptasia larvae and
adults results in reduced NF-κB expression as compared to the corresponding aposymbiotic
anemones (Mansfield et al., 2017). In this report, we find that incubation of Aiptasia larvae with

other Symbiodiniaceae genera (SSA01, SSA03, SSE01, Mf2.2b) does not reduce NF-κB
expression (Figs. 1B, C). The failure of SSA03 and SSE01 to reduce NF-κB in larvae could be
due to their inability to efficiently populate Aiptasia (Fig. 1A), but whether their inability to
establish residency in Aiptasia larvae is due, at least in part, to their inability to downregulate
NF-κB remains unclear. On the other hand, SSB01, SSA01, and Mf2.2b can all populate
Aiptasia larvae (Hambleton et al., 2014; Wolfowicz et al., 2016; Fig. 1A), and yet only SSB01
downregulates NF-κB expression (Figs. 1B, C). Thus, it seems clear that suppression of NF-κB
is not required by all Symbiodiniaceae genera in order to populate Aiptasia larvae.
How the presence of SSB01 in Aiptasia larvae leads to reduced NF-κB expression is not
known. Our finding that incubation of aposymbiotic larvae with the human cytokine TGFβ1 also
caused a reduction in NF-κB mRNA and protein staining (Fig. 1D-F) suggests that SSB01
reduces NF-κB by affecting a host factor(s) such as TGFβ. Consistent with that hypothesis,
TGFβ has previously been shown to promote symbiosis in Aiptasia (Detournay et al., 2012) and
in the coral Fungia scutaria (Berthelier at al., 2017). TGFβ comprises a superfamily of cytokines
that induce anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive effects in vertebrate systems (Travis and
Sheppard, 2013; Chen and Ten Dijke, 2016), and the predicted Aiptasia TGFβ homologue is
51% identical to human TGFβ1 (Detournay et al., 2012). Taken together, these results support a
model in which a host factor can suppress NF-κB which, in turn, facilitates the efficient
establishment of symbiosis by certain algal symbionts, including SSB01 in Aiptasia.
Even though short-term infection of Aiptasia larvae with SSA01 does not reduce NF-κB
expression, adult anemones that are stably populated by their endogenous algal symbionts
(largely or entirely algae of strain SSA01) show low levels of NF-κB that are similar to the
reduced levels seen in adults stably hosting SSB01. Furthermore, three Durusdinium isolates

populate adult Aiptasia at a reduced level as compared to symbionts SSB01 and SSA01 (Fig. 2B;
Matthews et al., 2018), and in no case did we find that Durusdinium sp. downregulated NF-κB.
Thus, there are both native (SSA01) and non-native (Durusdinium spp.) Symbiodiniaceae that
can establish symbioses with adult Aiptasia that do not appear to be able to reduce NF-κB
expression or activity in short-term infections with Aiptasia larvae. It is notable that the three
Durusdinium isolates that can form symbiosis with Aiptasia adults without reducing NF-κB
levels (Fig. 2A) are maintained at lower levels than algal strains SSB01 and SSA01, which do
reduce NF-κB levels in adults (Fig. 2B). It is not clear whether the inability of Durusdinium (a
non-native symbiont) to reduce NF-κB causes it to be propagated at reduced levels in Aiptasia.
Overall, our results show that different Symbiodiniaceae can have multiple and varying effects
on the NF-κB signaling pathway, and suggest that different Symbiodiniaceae have different
strategies for affecting host pathways in the establishment and maintenance of symbiosis.
Symbiotic Aiptasia hosting SSB01 have reduced NF-κB protein levels (Fig. 2A) and
DNA-binding activity (Fig. 3A, B) as compared to the corresponding aposymbiotic Aiptasia.
Moreover, after infection of Aiptasia with the bacterial pathogen S. marcescens, approximately
95% of aposymbiotic anemones (high NF-κB) survived whereas only 17% of symbiotic
anemones (low NF-κB) survived (Fig. 3D). These results suggest a trade-off during symbiosis
with adult Aiptasia hosting certain algal strains wherein NF-κB is reduced to facilitate the
symbiotic partnership, but this reduction in NF-κB also results in increased susceptibility to
pathogen-induced disease. Other host-microbe relationships that lead to reduced host NF-κB
activity include Drosophila-gut microbiota (Chu and Mazmanian, 2013), salamander-algae
(Burns et al., 2017), honeybee-deformed wing virus (Nazzi et al., 2012; Di Prisco et al., 2016),
and bobtail squid-V. fischeri (Chun et al., 2008).

We have also found that three colonies of the coral P. damicornis that have been
maintained in common garden conditions for >5 years can 1) have differential bleaching
susceptibilities in response to increased water temperature, 2) harbor different Symbiodiniaceae
genera, and 3) have different basal levels of NF-κB (Figs. 4A-F). The most thermoresistant
colony (#3) had constitutively higher NF-κB levels and hosted a variety of Durusdinium
symbionts as compared to thermosensitive colonies 1 and 2, which had lower NF-κB levels and
hosted primarily Cladocopium symbionts. Several studies have reported that hosting
Durusdinium is associated with increased thermotolerance in corals (e.g., Barshis et al., 2013;
Silverstein et al., 2017; Stat and Gates, 2011, Davies et al., 2018). Whether host factors, such as
increased NF-κB levels, also contribute to the bleaching resistance in our P. damicironis colony
3 is not clear at this time. However, it is notable that the stable hosting of Durusdinium species
does not reduce NF-κB levels during symbiosis in both Aiptasia (Fig. 2A) or P. damicornis (Fig.
4D, E). Therefore, cnidarians that naturally host Durusdinium may have increased
thermoresistance to bleaching due to the following: 1) an intrinsic thermoresistance of
Durusdinium symbionts; 2) effects of Durusdinium on host physiology (e.g., by maintaining high
NF-κB levels); or 3) a combination of both. Relevant to these three possibilities, Durusdinium
does not appear to be inherently more thermoresistant than other Symbiodiniaceae genera when
grown in vitro in the absence of a cnidarian host (Chakravarti and van Oppen, 2018), suggesting
that effects of Durusdinium on host physiology are important for thermotolerance.
We identified 116 annotated genes with significantly higher expression levels in
thermoresistant P. damicornis colony 3 as compared to thermosensitive colonies 1 and 2. Several
groups (e.g., Barshis et al., 2013; Brener-Raffalli et al., 2018) have proposed that higher basal
expression of certain host stress response genes, i.e. “frontloaded genes”, is associated with

protection against thermally induced bleaching in reef-building corals. Thus, the upregulation of
certain genes in our P. damicornis colony 3 could be indicative of frontloaded stress-response
genes. Consistent with that, we found that approximately 46% of the 116 colony 3-specific
upregulated genes have been reported to be upregulated by stress in other organisms (Table S2).
Moreover, two of the colony 3-specific upregulated genes (creld2 [cysteine-rich with EGF-like
domain 2-like] and von Willebrand factor A domain-containing 8) were also reported as
frontloaded genes in wild populations of bleached Pocillopora (Brener-Raffalli et al., 2018). Of
note, the creld2 and von Willebrand factor A domain-containing 8 genes both have predicted
NF-κB binding sites near their transcriptional start sites (Fig. S3).
It is likely that many of the genes that show differences in basal expression in colony 3
vs. colonies 1 and 2 are not a consequence of increased NF-κB expression or increased
thermoresistance in colony 3. For example, Granados-Cifuentes et al. (2013) have shown that
there are extensive differences in gene expression among genetically distinct Acropora millepora
nubbins, even when these coral are raised in common garden lab conditions for four weeks. In
addition, colony 3 harbors a different genera of symbiont (i.e., Durusdinium) than colonies 1 and
2 (i.e., Cladocopium), and algal symbiont type has been shown to affect host gene expression
patterns (DeSalvo et al., 2010; Barshis et al., 2013). Others have proposed that higher plasticity
in gene expression (rather than frontloading or symbiont type) can also enable coral to more
effectively resist thermal stress (Granados-Cifuentes et al., 2013; Seneca and Palumbi, 2015;
Davies et al., 2016; Kenkel and Matz, 2016).
The frontloading and plasticity gene expression models of thermoresistance in corals both
consider only genes that respond to or protect against the stress of increased temperature.
However, others (Dixon et al., 2015) have seen a negative correlation of certain heat tolerance-

associated genes with bleaching susceptibility. Thus, we propose that there is another class of
genes that are involved in bleaching susceptibility: namely, genes whose upregulation or
downregulation is required for thermal bleaching. In this scenario, one might predict that
bleaching effector genes that are normally upregulated during thermal stress would be basally
lower in thermoresistant corals, and that bleaching effector genes that are downregulated during
thermal stress would be basally higher in thermoresistant corals. Thus, in thermoresistant colony
3, NF-κB could be transcriptionally activating some genes that must be sufficiently
downregulated by heat in order for bleaching to ensue. Related to this hypothesis, we find that
the basal levels of two genes (Pd-cyst-rich and Pd-DPP7), which have been reported as highly
downregulated in bleached P. damicornis (Vidal-Dupoil et al., 2009), are overexpressed in
thermoresistant colony 3 as compared to thermosensitive colonies 1 and 2, and both genes have
multiple predicted NF-κB binding sites within 500 bp of their transcriptional start sites. Although
there has been an amazing lack of consistency among gene expression studies that have
compared mRNA levels in control vs. bleached corals, genes encoding cysteine-rich proteins
have been identified as being downregulated in at least two other studies that have looked at
genes affected by bleaching in the corals P. damicornis (Vidal-Dupoil et al., 2009) and Orbicella
faveolata (DeSalvo et al., 2008).
Many studies that have looked at gene expression changes that occur during bleaching or
that are associated with thermoresistance have used GO (Gene Ontology) analysis in an attempt
to identify biological processes that are affected by bleaching or heat. Nevertheless, such studies
provide correlations with mRNA expression levels, and not with protein activity. Furthermore,
such studies are inherently compromised by a lack of proven gene homologues among the
datasets analyzed, as has been suggested by others (Djordevic et al., 2016). Therefore, we

propose that studies, such as ours and a recent study of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK
(Courtial et al., 2017), that are investigating induced or inherent differences in transcription
factor activity will ultimately be required to identify cell networks and pathways that contribute
to biological processes related to symbiosis and thermal sensitivity.

Figure 1. Downregulation of NF-κB expression in Aiptasia larvae by Symbiodiniaceae
strain SSB01 and by treatment with exogenous TGFβ. (A) After incubation of larvae for 5 d
with the indicated algal strains, the percentages of larvae containing algal cells were determined
by manual counting during scans though the z-planes using confocal imaging. Each data point
represents one experimental trial. (B) NF-κB protein levels were measured by quantitative
immunohistochemistry of larvae exposed to the indicated algal symbionts. NF-κB fluorescence
in larvae was quantified using Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) of confocal images as
measured using ImageJ. Values represent the averages of 13 larvae for each group and are
relative to the CTCF value of aposymbiotic larvae (set at 100). *= P<0.0001. (C) Representative
immunofluorescence images of infected larvae. Green (NF-κB), red (algal cells), and white (αtubulin) images were merged. (D-F) Aposymbiotic Aiptasia larvae were held as controls or
incubated with 200 ng/ml human TGFβ ligand in ASW overnight at room temperature. (D) NF-

κB and RPL10 transcript levels were measured by qPCR of cDNA from control and TGFβtreated larvae, using RNA from 200 pooled larvae per group. Each data point is an experimental
trial. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired t-test. (E and F) Control and TGFβtreated larvae were fixed and NF-κB fluorescence was quantified as described for (B) and (C).
(E) Values are relative to the CTCF value of control uninfected larvae (set at 100). Statistical
significance was determined by an unpaired t-test (n=40, P<0.0001). (F) Representative
immunofluorescence images of control and TGFβ-treated larvae. Green (NF-κB) yellow (αtubulin), and blue (DAPI) were merged.

Figure 2. Downregulation of NF-κB expression in Aiptasia adults by Symbiodiniaceae
strains SSB01 and SSA01, but not by three Durusdinium strains. (A) Western blotting using
anti-NF-κB and anti-α-tubulin antisera of whole-animal extracts from aposymbiotic CC7
Aiptasia (Apo), CC7 animals hosting their endogenous algal symbionts (CC7), or CC7 that had
been rendered aposymbiotic and then populated to steady-state levels with the Breviolum strain
SSB01 or one of the Durusdinium strains (A001, Mf2.2b, and Ap2). (B) Algal population
densities were determined in the same anemone strains as in (A). Box-and-whiskers plots are
shown for three (CC7, CC7-Ap2) or four (CC7-SSB01, CC7-Mf2.2b, CC7-A001) replicate
experiments with five to eight animals per experiment. ANOVA Tukey post-hoc tests were used
to evaluate the differences between populations; those marked by the same letter were not
significantly different. For each comparison of CC7 to one of the Durusdinium-containing
strains, P<0.05; for each comparison of CC7-SSB01 to one of the Durusdinium-containing
strains, P<0.0001. (C) Rates of bleaching under thermal stress at 34ºC were evaluated for the
same anemone populations as in (A) and (B). Means +/- SEMs are shown for replicates as in (B).
(Note that the data for time 0 are the same as those shown in B.) ENDO, CC7 animals hosting
their endogenous algal symbionts.

Figure 3. Increased resistance to a bacterial pathogen of aposymbiotic (high NF-κB)
relative to symbiotic (low NF-κB) Aiptasia. (A) NF-κB DNA-binding activity was assessed by
EMSA using lysates of three adult symbiotic CC7-SSB01 (Sym) or aposymbiotic CC7 (Apo)
anemones. DNA-binding reactions were performed with equal amounts of protein for all
biological replicates. The NF-κB DNA-binding complex is indicated by the arrow. (B) Bands
corresponding to the NF-κB DNA-binding complexes in (A) were quantified using ImageJ.

Values were averaged per group and then normalized to the mean value (set at 1.0) for the three
bands detected with symbiotic animal extracts. (C) CC7-SSB01 (Sym) and aposymbiotic (Apo)
Aiptasia were incubated with Serratia marcescens for one week and were then allowed to
recover in ASW for two weeks at which time viability was assessed (see Materials and
Methods). Representative images are shown of control, non-infected anemones (left) and
infected anemones after the two-week recovery period (right); an anemone that did not survive
infection (top, right), and an anemone that did survive (bottom, right) are shown. (D) Percent
survival of S. marcescens-infected anemones for the indicated symbiotic/aposymbiotic pairs.
Each data point is an experimental trial (as in C) with three anemones. The statistical
significance of the cumulative Sym versus Apo data (n=18 for each group) was evaluated using
an unpaired t-test (P<0.0001).

Figure 4. Higher NF-κB levels and greater thermotolerance in a Pocillopora damicornis
colony hosting Durusdinium than in colonies hosting Cladocopium symbionts. Three colonies
of P. damicornis that had been kept in laboratory-based common-garden conditions were
characterized for their algal symbionts, NF-κB levels, and sensitivities to bleaching under heat
Total algal population densities in the colonies at 28ºC were determined as described in
Materials and Methods. (C) Algal symbiont communities were characterized by metabarcoding
of ITS2, and the relative abundance of each ITS2 type was plotted as the proportion of reads per
sample. (D) Samples from the colonies held at 28°C for 5 days were lysed, and samples were
subjected to Western blotting for NF-κB (top) and α-tubulin (bottom). ). (E) NF-κB bands (as in
D) were quantified in ImageJ, and intensities were normalized to α-tubulin band intensity values.
Values are averages of three biological replicates from each of two experimental trials (thus n=6,

except for colony 1, which had one NF-κB band below the detection limit) and are expressed
relative to that for colony 2 (set at 1.0). Statistical significance was evaluated using an unpaired
t-test (colony 1 vs. colony 3, P=0.005). (F) Tests of sensitivity to thermal bleaching. In each of
two trials, six fragments from each colony were randomly assigned to one of two treatments,
either continued incubation at 28ºC (control) or incubation at 32ºC after two days of ramping at
2°C per day. After 5 d (trial 1) or 7 d (trial 2), when the fragments at 32ºC showed bleaching,
images were captured (as in A, for trial 1) and colors quantified as described in Materials and
Methods. Y-axis, arbitrary units (au) of final color intensities.

Figure 5. Unique gene expression profiles in P. damicornis colonies. Principal component
analysis (PCA) of all r-log transformed isogroups clustered by P. damicornis colony (1, 2, or 3,
as in Fig. 4A) demonstrating significantly different transcriptomic profiles during growth under
control conditions.

Figure 6. Genes upregulated in a thermoresistant P. damicornis colony 3. Heatmap for
differentially expressed genes that were significantly upregulated in colony 3 relative to colonies
1 and 2. Only the 116 annotated genes (of 466 total – see File S6) were analyzed. Each row is a
gene and each column is from an independent gene-expression library. The color scale is in log2
(fold change relative to a given gene’s mean expression), and genes and samples are clustered
hierarchically based on Pearson’s correlation of their expression across samples. Block colors at
the base of the heatmap indicate the colony of origin for each library. Hierarchical clustering of
libraries (columns) showed statistically significant differences in gene expression across
colonies.
