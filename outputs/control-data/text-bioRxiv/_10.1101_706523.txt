Abstract

24

The drivers of community coexistence are known to vary with environment, but their consistency across

25

latitudes and scales, and resulting conservation implications, remain little understood. Here, we

26

combine functional and phylogenetic evidence along elevations to document strong biotic constraints

27

on coexistence in avian communities in both benign (tropical low elevations) and severely harsh

28

(temperate/polar highlands) environments. Assemblages in both are marked by high assemblage

29

functional uniqueness, whereas in tropical highlands and temperate/polar low elevations there is strong

30

functionally redundancy and pronounced environmental constraints. Only in harsh environments is

31

phylogeny an effective surrogate for functional assemblage structure, reflecting nuanced shifts in the

32

position, shape, and composition of measured multivariate trait space along gradients. Independent of

33

scale and latitude, high elevation assemblages emerge as exceptionally susceptible to functional change.

34
35

Introduction

36

Species, and the communities they form, convey a range of functions to ecosystems and humans that

37

are now under increasing threat from global change (1). Drivers, presumed mechanisms, and evidence

38

of community change are non-uniform among latitudes and elevations (2–4). This raises fundamental

39

questions about the processes and relative roles of biotic and abiotic drivers underpinning community

40

coexistence along large-scale spatial and environmental gradients and their implications for the

41

maintenance of community functions (5–8). While biotic constraints such as competitive constraints on

42

trait equivalencies, i.e., limiting similarity (9), or certain facilitative intercations involving unique species

43

(10–12) are expected to increase divergence (i.e., overdispersion) of trait characteristics among

44

community members, particularly for closely related species, environmental constraints (or filters) that

45

select for common phenotypes might decrease trait divergence and enhance trait similarity (i.e.,

46

clustering) (13). The latter are expected to dominate toward harsh and less stable environments (13,

47

14), whereas biotic constraints, particularly competitive exclusion, should be more prominent in

48

productive and stable settings (15, 16). Despite their key role for gauging the functional consequences of

49

climate change, whether and how these processes and resulting patterns hold from local to

50

regional/global scales, where macroevolutionary constraints and contingencies on clade functional

51

space emerge, remains largely unclear (17–19) or reliant on phylogenetic proxies of uncertain surrogacy

52

value (20–22).

53
54

Here, we use the natural experiment provided by elevational gradients of the world’s main mountain

55

regions replicated along latitude (23, 24), a time-calibrated phylogeny (25), comprehensive trait data

56

(26), and elevational distributions (24) addressing nearly all extant bird species, to test how functional

57

structure varies from benign to harsh conditions across local, regional, and global scales. For 8,410

58

assemblages along elevations from sea level to 7,340 meters, we estimate prevalence of assembly

59

mechanisms using dendrogram-based functional diversity (FD), hypervolume-based functional diversity

60

(FDH; Supplementary Material), and species’ local functional distinctness (FDI) which captures the

61

distinct contribution species make to the total functional diversity of a local assemblage (27). We use

62

their species richness-controlled values, cFD and cFDI (standardized effect sizes), supported by quantile

63

scores and associated p-values, to distinguish overdispersion from clustering. To investigate the

64

evolutionary underpinnings of species coexistence and perform a widely called for test of phylogenetic

65

and functional structure surrogacy (20, 22, 28) we use comprehensive phylogenetic information for all

66

assemblages. Finally, we assess the shape, position, and turnover in assemblage’s multivariate trait

67

volume and decompose it into its constituent elements (single traits) to gain a more mechanistic

68

understanding of assemblage functional structure (29, 30).

Results

72

Functional structure. Globally, absolute FD and FDH peak at ca. 1,500-2,000m (Fig. 1A, Figs. S1-S2, Table

73

S1). Both low and high elevations exhibit functional overdispersion with higher levels of FD and mean

74

FDI (FDIavg) than their species richness would suggest (cFD and cFDI patterns, Fig. 1B,E). In contrast, mid

75

elevations are generally more functionally clustered (Fig. 1B,E). But a strong latitudinal variation in this

76

pattern is evident (Fig. 1, Figs. S1-S3, Table S1). cFD, cFDH, and cFDIavg decline along elevation in the

77

tropics (<23.5°) and sub-tropics (23.5-35°), but increase toward high elevations in temperate and polar

78

regions (>35°; Fig. 1B,E, Figs. S1-S2, Table S1). Accordingly, cFD, cFDH, and cFDIavg decrease with latitude

79

in low to mid elevations, but this trend reverses for high elevations (Fig. 1C,F, Figs. S1-S2, Table S1).

80

Species’ local functional role is highly uneven along elevation and latitude, with a small number of

81

species contributing much more functional uniqueness than the rest in regions with strong

82

environmental constraints (Fig. 1G-I, Figs. S1-S2, Table S1). While the species richness-controlled

83

skewness of species FDI values, cFDIskew, increases toward higher elevations in the tropics and sub-

84

tropics, the opposite applies to temperate and polar regions (Fig. 1H, Figs. S1-S2, Table S1).

85

Consequently, cFDIskew increases from the tropics to the arctic at low to mid elevations (Fig. 1I, Figs. S1-

86

S2, Table S1), but declines at high elevations.

87
88

Phylogenetic and functional structure surrogacy. Absolute (PD) and richness-controlled (cPD)

89

phylogenetic diversity follow elevational and latitudinal trends broadly similar to those of function (Fig.

90

1J,K,L, Fig. S1, Table S1). The phylogenetic structure of an assemblage provides a reasonable proxy for

91

the functional structure, but in a strongly latitude-dependent way (Fig. 2C,D, Table S2). In the tropics,

92

the phylogenetic structure offers reasonable, but not strong, surrogacy for functionally overdispersed

93

(frequency, Fr, with which cPD>0 sites are also cFD>0; Fr=0.63) and clustered (frequency with which

94

cPD<0 sites are also cFD<0; Fr=0.62) assemblages (Fig. 2D, Table S2). Toward higher latitudes, the

95

predictive power of phylogenetic structure diverges strongly (Fig. 2D, Table S2), reaching respectively

96

Fr=0.21 and Fr=0.81 for functionally overdispersed and clustered assemblages in temperate and polar

97

regions. This general latitudinal pattern of the predictive ability of the phylogeny is upheld by quantile

98

scores and associated estimated p-values (two-tailed test, a=0.05; Fig S5, Table S2).

99
100

Turnover and decomposition of the multivariate trait volume. Globally, the volume of assemblage

101

traits and its relative (centroid) location vary little up to ca. 3,500m elevation, but both shift drastically

102

above that (Fig. 3A,B), suggesting strong across elevation assemblage trait volume redundancy from low

103

to mid elevations and increasing uniqueness above. This is confirmed by the global pattern of overlap in

104

assemblage trait volume (as Sørensen similarity), FDO, whose rapid decline toward high elevations (Fig.

105

3C) coincides with the global peak in functional clustering (at ca. 2,000m; Fig. 1). This global pattern

106

mirrors those in tropical mountain systems, but not those in temperate and polar regions where FDO

107

slightly increases toward higher elevations (Fig. 3C). Simpson’s similarity, FDT, remains high and

108

relatively constant along elevation both globally and in the tropics, but increases slightly in higher

109

latitude regions (Fig. 3D). Fraction of trait volume unique to lower elevation assemblages (FDUl)

110

increases strongly toward higher elevations globally and in the tropics, but this increase is less

111

pronounced for temperate and polar regions (Fig. 3E). Fraction of trait volume unique to higher

112

elevation assemblages (FDUh) declines slightly along the elevational gradient globally and for high

113

latitude regions, but shows a slight humped pattern in the tropics (Fig. 3F).

114
115

The variation in avian trait volume along elevation and latitude we uncover is underpinned by a strongly

116

expected (Fig. S6) change in the prevalence of select traits (Fig. 4, Figs. S7,S8). Certain functional

117

components—e.g., mid- and upper-canopy and open-water foragers—generally decline drastically with

118

increasing elevation (Fig. 4B, Figs. S7,S8). Nocturnal species also disappear toward higher elevations (Fig.

119

4E), which we attribute to harsher night-time temperatures and decreased daytime competition. The

120

prevalence of birds of prey, granivorous, and ground foraging birds increases steeply linearly with

121

elevation in temperate and arctic regions, but closer to the equator shows a mid-elevation peak and a

122

steep decline thereafter (Fig. 4D, Figs. S7,S8). The proportion of insectivorous species increases with

123

elevation in the tropics, but not in temperate and arctic regions, suggestive of lower insect abundance at

124

high elevations there (Fig. 4C). Average assemblage body mass declines from lower to mid elevations

125

and then, at least in higher latitudes, strongly increases toward high elevations (Fig. 4F), consistent with

126

Bergmann’s rule type pattern (31).

127
128

Discussion

129

Our results confirm our expectation around a prominence of biotic interactions (as suggested by

130

overdispersion) in more productive and stable environments (i.e., tropical low elevations).

131

Correspondingly, environmental filtering dominates in less benign tropical highlands as well as across

132

most of the elevational gradient in temperate and polar regions, characterized by the strong selective

133

force of their harsher winters. This mirrors earlier findings on the increasing role of abiotic contraints

134

leading to phylogenetic clustering (32–34) and faster rates of speciation (24) at high elevations. Contrary

135

to our predictions, however, we find increasing functional overdispersion toward the highlands in

136

temperate and arctic regions. This is consistent with findings of functional overdispersion at both ends

137

of the resource availability spectrum (35). We suggest that in the already harsh conditions of higher

138

latitudes inhabited by a restricted pool of clades, higher elevations impose severe limitations where

139

facilitative interactions (35), potentially paired with competitive exclusion, becomes predominant. We

140

elucidate more of the mechanisms of community assembly by showing that local functional redundancy

141

drives the centers of functional clustering (tropical highlands and temperate low to mid elevations),

142

while overdispersion (the tropical low to mid elevations and temperate highlands) is driven

143

predominantly by functionally unique species. The predominance of functionally unique species in

144

temperate and polar highlands is indeed consistent with increased facilitation as facilitative interactions

145

in stressful environments tend to involve primarily functionally distinct species (5, 10, 11, 36).

146
147

A time-calibrated species-level phylogeny allowed us to investigate the evolutionary underpinnings of

148

species coexistence. High joint phylogenetic and functional overdispersion, i.e., when assemblages are

149

comprised of distantly related species with significant trait differences, suggests that only distantly

150

related lineages can evolve sufficient niche differences to overcome competitive dynamics and attain

151

coexistence. In contrast, functional overdispersion coupled with phylogenetic clustering indicates that

152

closely related species readily evolve trait dissimilarities to avoid competition. Functional and

153

phylogenetic clustering, on the other hand, means that closely related species share adaptations that

154

allow them to persist in local environmental conditions. Finally, functional clustering in hand with

155

phylogenetic overdispersion implies that distantly related species adapt convergently to the local

156

environment. Our results suggest that the interplay of these ecological and evolutionary processes of

157

community assembly shows strong elevational and latitudinal variation.

158
159

Specifically, in tropical low to mid elevations, where phylogenetic overdispersion offers reasonable

160

surrogacy for functional overdispersion, distantly related species might often coexist thanks to having

161

evolved significant trait dissimilarities. As elevation in the tropics increases, phylogeny remains a

162

reasonable predictor of the functional structure, suggesting that close relatives often share trait

163

combinations conferring the ability to tolerate increasingly harsh environmental conditions of the

164

highlands. With increasing latitude, phylogeny provides a reliable proxy only for clustered assemblages,

165

again suggesting that closely related species that occur in low and mid elevations share phylogenetically

166

conserved adaptations allowing them to persist in stressful environmental conditions of temperate and

167

polar regions. In contrast, functional overdispersion that predominantly characterizes temperate and

168

polar highlands cannot be inferred from the phylogenetic structure, implying that close relatives in the

169

highlands of high latitude regions evolve niche differences to avoid competition. These results suggest

170

that phylogeny might be a reasonable substitute for assemblage functional composition in places where

171

harsh environmental conditions constrain assemblages to a few, functionally similar species. However,

172

the relationship is inconsistent or weak for assemblages where highly functionally unique species

173

prevail. In such settings, it is ill-suited for identifying biotic constraints as a dominant assembly

174

mechanism and for recognizing regions with particularly distinct ecosystem-relevant functions.

175
176

The inconsistent predictive power of phylogeny highlights how the mechanistic interpretation of

177

assemblage functional structure across scales benefits from an assessement of its composition and

178

turnover, down to the level of single traits and their respective drivers (29, 30). Globally, we find a

179

strong among-assemblage trait volume redundancy from low to mid elevations and increasing

180

uniqueness above. We attribute the escalating dissimilarity in trait volumes along elevation to decreases

181

in species richness and its associated functional diversity (i.e., nestedness sensu (37)) rather than

182

turnover in actual species identities or their functions. As elevation increases, species holding functions

183

reflecting elevational, treeline or terrain, dependencies of associated habitats drop out from

184

assemblages. However, strong latitudinal variation in functional dissimilarity patterns and select

185

underlying traits exists. In the tropics, increasingly depauperate assemblages are functionally nested

186

along elevation as environmental filtering becomes predominant toward higher elevations. In temperate

187

and arctic regions, ubiquitous strong environmental filtering results in relatively stable among-

188

assemblage functional similarity along elevation.

190

Inferring mechanisms of community assembly from observational data is admittedly challenging in the

191

absence of additional evidence from experimental manipulation (14, 38). Nonetheless, afforded by the

192

concurrent examination of the functional and phylogenetic structure, our analysis provides a powerful

193

test of assembly processes across scales. The additional assessement of the compositional turnover in

194

trait space paired with detailed examination of change in multiple traits along a demonstrable

195

environmental gradient (14) further allows disentangling the mechanisms that might otherwise be

196

masked by multivariate patterns (35).

197
198

The uncovered patterns of functional community assembly and turnover have important conservation

199

implications. At local scales, high assemblage functional uniqueness paired with low species richness

200

makes temperate and polar highlands disproportionately susceptible to the loss of critical ecological

201

functions. At larger scales, sustaining the regional multi-functionality of ecosystems requires high

202

dissimilarity among assemblages (39, 40) because no single, local assemblage can support all ecosystem

203

processes (41). We find such high among-assemblage functional uniqueness for tropical and sub-tropical

204

highland ecosystems, causing them to be exceedingly susceptible to disruption of their large-scale

205

functioning. Globally, different processes and scales combine to make high elevation ecosystems

206

exceptionally prone to future ecological perturbations and loss of functions.

Materials and Methods

209

Mountain systems. To delineate mountain regions, we used the inventory of the World’s mountain

210

regions based on expert delineation and terrain ruggedness provided by the Global Mountain

211

Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA, http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org). The GMBA inventory identified

212

46 broad-scale mountain regions across the five continents. (24) evaluated the biological independence

213

of the GMBA delineation and found that only a small proportion of species is shared among the 46

214

regions (median similarity of 0.47% +- 10.37% (sd)).

215
216

Distributions and elevational ranges and biodiversity sampling. Data on breeding distributions were

217

compiled from the best available sources for a given broad geographical region or taxonomic group and

218

totaled 9993 species (for individual maps, see https://mol.org). The database of bird elevational ranges

219

was compiled by (24) and is available at https://mol.org. Using these distributional and elevational

220

ranges, we then followed the protocol established by (24) to sample biodiversity data. The sampling

221

procedure returned a total of 21,655 assemblages across the world and 8,410 assemblages within our

222

delimited mountain systems with a median of 71 per mountain region (minimum 3 in the Central

223

Australian mountains, maximum 1,816 in the Himalayas). While admittedly coarse-scale and solely

224

presence-absence, the distributional data used here comprise the best current understanding of bird

225

distributions at the global scale.

226
227

Avian phylogenetic and functional diversity, and trait space. For each assemblage, we calculated avian

228

dendrogram-based functional diversity (FD) (42). We based estimates of FD on a compilation of

229

function-relevant traits in (26). Four trait categories were included: body mass, nocturnality, diet, and

230

foraging niche. The diet and foraging niche categories included seven axes each: proportions of

231

invertebrates, vertebrates, carrion, fresh fruits, nectar and pollen, seeds, and other plant materials in

232

species’ diet (diet category); proportional use of water below surface, water around surface, terrestrial

233

ground level, understory, mid canopy, upper canopy and aerial (foraging niche category). Following

234

existing practice (2, 43) we calculated multivariate trait dissimilarity using Gower’s distance for each

235

pairwise combination of all 9,993 species in the dataset. Equal weights were given to each of the trait

236

categories and to each axis within the trait categories (i.e., each diet and foraging niche variable was

237

given a 1/7 weight, whereas the weights of body mass and nocturnality was 1). We used Gower’s

238

distance as distance metric because this index can handle quantitative, semi-quantitative, and

239

qualitative variables and assign different weights to individual traits (43).

240
241

The functional dendrogram was built using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic

242

Mean) clustering. UPGMA clustering has the highest cophenetic correlation coefficient among most

243

popular clustering methods (Ward, Single, Complete, WPGMA, WPGMC, and UPGMC clustering

244

methods) and the lowest 2-norm index (44), ensuring most faithful preservation of the original distances

245

in the dissimilarity matrix. At each of the point locations, the functional dendrogram was pruned of the

246

branches for species that did not occur at that location to reflect that location’s species composition.

247

FDD was calculated as a sum of branch lengths of such local functional dendrogram.

248
249

The calculation of dendrogram-based phylogenetic diversity (PD) followed the same procedure (45), but

250

instead of a functional dendrogram, we used 20 dendrograms sampled from full pseudo-posterior

251

distribution of phylogenetic trees assembled by (25) (http://birdtree.org/). PD was calculated as the

252

total branch length of tree branches averaged over the 20 phylogenetic trees, with 20 trees thought to

253

provide a sufficiently strong initial estimate (46).

254
255

We used the same local functional dendrogram to quantify the assemblage mean (FDIavg) and skewness

256

(FDIskew) of species’ local functional distinctness (FDI). FDI was calculated as the fair proportion branch

257

length of the branches in a local functional dendrogram leading to a species tip and measures the

258

uniqueness of a species functional characteristics in the context of all other species in the same

259

assemblage. As such, FDI decomposes overall FD into individual species contributions. When averaged

260

across the entire assemblage, FDIavg informs on how the average distinct functional position of single

261

species changes along gradients (FDIavg). High FDIavg indicate on average a given assemblage is comprised

262

of functionally unique species. Skewness of the distribution of FDI values further informs on whether

263

individual species contribute uniformly or unevenly to overall FD (low and high FDIskew, respectively).

264
265

The clustering algorithm can affect the shape of the functional dendrogram and, consequently, the

266

estimate of the dendrogram-based functional diversity (47). To ensure that our choice of the clustering

267

algorithm did not significantly alter the inferences, we further quantified functional diversity directly

268

with the multidimensional functional space. Specifically, we calculated functional diversity as the

269

assemblage trait volume (FDH), quantified using the hypervolume metric (48). To obtain FDH, we first

270

conducted the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) using the multivariate trait dissimilarity matrix based

271

on Gower’s distance for each pairwise combination of all species in the dataset. We then used the first

272

two principal coordinates to quantify the hypervolume of each point location using the minimal convex

273

hull method in the package hypervolume (48). Using more than two principal coordinates was

274

computationally unfeasible because the algorithm becomes exponentially inefficient in high

275

dimensionalities. Hypervolumes quantified in this manner reflected positions of all species present at a

276

given assemblage. Results for FDH are provided in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S2).

277
278

To further evaluate how assemblage trait volume changes with elevation, we quantified an overlap in

279

trait volume (FDO) among the point locations falling along the elevational gradient using package

280

hypervolume (48). For each point at an elevation a, we selected the geographically closest point that lies

281

within (a+500m, a+1000m) elevational region. Because we wanted to evaluate changes in trait volume

282

along elevation rather than changes that might arise from geographic distance, we excluded all pairs of

283

points that were geographically farther apart than 500km. For each pair of points we quantified niche

volume for points at lower (FDUl) and higher (FDUh) elevation (Blonder et al., 2014). To obtain these

286

indices, we first conducted the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) using the multivariate trait

287

dissimilarity matrix based on Gower’s distance for each pairwise combination of all species in the

288

dataset. We then used the first two principal coordinates to quantify the hypervolume of each point

289

location using the minimal convex hull method in the package hypervolume (48). Sørensen similarity

290

was then given as twice the intersection of trait volumes of the assemblage at lower elevation and that

291

at upper elevation divided by volume of both assemblages. Unique fractions were calculated as the

292

unique component of the trait volume of, respectively, lower and higher elevation assemblage divided

293

by the entire trait volume of that assemblage. Simpson’s similarity (not provided by the hypervolume

294

package) was derived from unique fractions indices and equaled to the intersection of trait volume of

295

assemblage at lower elevation and that at higher elevation divided by trait volume of the assemblages

296

with a smaller unique fraction (37). We conducted sensitivity analysis by repeating the above steps for

297

points falling within (a+250m, a+750m) and (a+750m, a+1250m), and for pairs of points located

298

geographically not farther than 100km and 250km, and present these results in the Supplementary

299

Material (Fig. S9).

300
301

We also assessed individual components of avian trait volume. To separate trait axes, or guilds, we used

302

dietary niche (i.e., proportions of different types of food in species’ diet—invertebrates, vertebrates,

303

carrion, fresh fruits, nectar and pollen, seeds, and other plant materials), foraging niche (i.e., the

304

proportional use of each of seven niches—water below surface, water around surface, terrestrial ground

305

level, understory, mid canopy, upper canopy, and aerial), nocturnality, and log-transformed body mass.

306

For dietary and foraging niche, we quantified the relative proportion (i.e., prevalence) of each diet and

307

foraging niche for each assemblage. To account for the effect of separate mountain ranges, we first

308

assessed individual components of avian trait volume for each mountain range and then averaged those

309

values to obtain a global estimate.

310
311

Richness-controlled avian phylogenetic and functional diversity, and trait space. Multivariate

312

components of phylogenetic and functional diversity are often closely associated with species richness

313

(SR), and interpretations of assemblage structure benefit from statistically controlling for this

314

association. To evaluate whether elevational gradients in phylogenetic, functional, and trait diversity

315

deviate from the expectation given SR, we generated null model for PD, FD, FDIavg, FDIskew, FDH, and

316

individual components of avian assemblage trait volume. Even though FDI values provide estimates of

317

individual species contributions to FD, their assemblage-level means (FDIavg) and skewness (FDIskew) are

318

often closely associated with SR (27). Consequently, species richness-controlled equivalents of FDIavg and

319

FDIskew allow more in-depth interpretations of the mechanisms behind the patterns of assemblage

320

structure.

321
322

First, we developed the expected values of all metrics by randomly selecting species from a regional

323

species pool (i.e., species that occur in a given mountain region), keeping point-level SR constant (49).

324

The random selection of species for null models was performed 100 times. We calculated the

325

standardized effect sizes as the difference between observed values and those expected from the null

326

model, expressed in units standard deviation. The standardized effect sizes were considered the species

327

richness-controlled equivalents of biodiversity metrics and were denoted as cPD, cFD, cFDIavg, cFDIskew,

328

and cFDH. Negative and positive values of standardized effect sizes indicated that an observed value was

329

lower and higher, respectively, than the average expected value. Negative and positive values of cPD,

330

cFD, cFDIavg, and cFDH suggested clustering and overdispersion, respectively. Negative and positive

331

values of cFDIskew suggested less and more, respectively, even distribution of species functional

332

distinctness values.

333
334

Because standardized effect sizes might be affected by the shape of the null distribution, it is

335

recommended to additionally calculate quantile values (49). We thus futher calculated quantile scores

336

for the observed values of PD, FD, FDIavg, FDIskew, and FDH, and estimated their associated p-values (i.e.,

337

two-tailed test, a=0.05). The observed values falling outside the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the null

338

distribution were considered statistically significantly lower (clustering) and higher (overdispersion),

339

respectively, than expected given SR. While the calculation of quantile scores and the associated p-

340

values removes some of the biases potentially resulting from the the shape of the null distribution, they

341

also remove information regarding the size of the effect itself (49). We thus report both the

342

standardized effect sizes (i.e., cPD, cFD, cFDIavg, cFDIskew, and cFDH) and the quantile scores with

343

associated p-values.

344
345

We then quantified frequency (Fr) with which phylogenetic structure predicted functional structure of

346

an assemblage. Fr of successful predictions was calculated separately for overdispersed and clustered

347

assemblages and was given by the proportion of phylogenetically overdispersed (clustered) assemblages

348

that were also functionally overdispersed (clustered). We quantified Fr for both designations of

349

overdispersion and clustering: (a) all positive and negative values of standardized effect sizes were

350

considered to be overdispersed and clustered and (b) observed values outside the 2.5% and 97.5%

351

quantiles of the null distribution were considered to be overdispersed and clustered, respectively. To

352

account for the effect of separate mountain ranges, Fr was averaged per mountain region, and

353

mountain region’s central latitude was used to evaluate the latitudinal gradient in Fr .

355

Global elevational gradients of avian functional, phylogenetic, and trait diversity. To explore how PD,

356

cPD, FD, cFD, FDIavg, cFDIavg, FDIskew, cFDIskew, FDH, and cFDH, FDO, FDT, FDUl, FDUh, and individual

357

components of assemblage trait volume vary with elevation, we used two different models: following a

358

linear relationship,

359
360

𝜇" = 𝛽& + 𝛽( 𝑥" (Eq. 1)

361
362

and a quadratic relationship,

363
364

𝜇" = 𝛽& + 𝛽( 𝑥" + 𝛽* 𝑥"* (Eq. 2)

365
366
367

To estimate a global pattern, we used two-level generalized hierarchical model, in which the parameters

368

for each mountain system came from a multivariate normal distribution (for model details, see (24)).

369

Log-transformed PD, FD, FDistavg , and FDistskew, FDH, as well as cPD, cFD, cFDIavg, and cFDIskew, cFDH

370

followed a Gaussian distribution 𝑁(𝜇" , 𝜎"* ). FDO, FDT, FDUl, FDUh, and each component of avian trait space

371

followed a beta distribution 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎(𝛼" , 𝛽" ); with exception of log-transformed body mass, which followed

372

a Gaussian distribution. All predictors were standardized by rescaling the distribution to have mean of 0

373

and standard deviation of 1. Each model was fitted in a Bayesian framework using INLA (50) through the

374

R-INLA package for R v.3.4.3 (https://www.r-project.org/). To select the best fitting model (quadratic or

375

linear), we estimated the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion (WAIC), which is preferable to similar

376

alternatives because it averages over the posterior distribution rather than using only point estimates

377

(51). We did not use the coefficient of determination, R2, to evaluate goodness-of-fit of each model

because R2 does not integrate across the full posterior probability and thus does not account for

379

uncertainty in parameter estimates.

381

Latitudinal influences on elevational gradients of avian functional, phylogenetic, and trait diversity. In

382

order to explore influences of latitudinal position on the elevational gradients in PD, FD, FDistavg,

383

FDistskew, FDH, cPD, cFD, cFDIavg, cFDIskew, cFDH, FDO, FDT, FDUl, FDUu, and individual components of

384

assemblage trait volume, we expanded the global hierarchical model to include average absolute

385

latitude of the mountain system following (24). Average latitude was fitted as interaction terms with

386

linear and quadratic effects of elevation. All models were run using R-INLA. WAIC was used to select best

387

fitting model.

388
389

Lastly, we used the expanded best fitting global model (i.e., one including average latitude as the

390

interaction term) to predict the latitudinal gradients in PD, cPD, FD, cFD, FDIavg, cFDIavg, FDIskew, cFDIskew,

391

FDH, and cFDH at different elevational bands.

Fig. 2. Interaction of phylogenetic and functional structure of all 8,410 analyzed assemblages in

520

mountain regions worldwide across the latitude. Structure is given as species richness-controlled

521

phylogenetic (cPD) and functional (cFD) diversity (standardized effect sizes). Statistically significant

522

deviations in (A) and (B) are denoted by + (overdispersion), - (clustering); ns denotes non-significance;

523

numbers in the contingency table show the number of sites with a statistically significant deviation. (C)

524

illustrates the interaction of central latitude of mountain regions with the relationship between cPD and

525

cFD, with fitted aggregate global pattern shown in dashed red line. (D) illustrates the latitudinal gradient

526

of the frequency with which functional structure is accurately predicted from phylogenetic structure

527

alone. For highlighted regions see Fig. 1.

Fig. 3. Elevational gradients of assemblage trait space. (A,B) provide the two-dimensional global trait

533

space resulting from Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA); points are the centroids of the trait space

534

specific to each consecutive elevational band of 500m intervals averaged over all mountain regions, with

535

75% confidence ellipses encompassing assemblages at each elevational band (A) and their trajectory

536

toward higher elevations (B). Size of points in (B) illustrates the number of mountain regions informing

537

each elevational band, decreasing with elevation from 42 at 500m to 19 at 4,000m to 1 at 6,000m. (C-F)

538

show the interaction of central latitude of mountain regions with elevational gradients of the overlap in

539

trait volume (FDO, Sørensen similarity; C), turnover (FDT, Simpson’s similarity; D), and fractions of trait

540

volume unique to assemblages located at lower (FDUl; E) and higher (FDUh; F) elevations. In (C-F), fitted

541

aggregate global patterns are shown in dashed red line. For highlighted regions see Fig. 1.

Fig. 4. Elevational gradients in the specific aspects of trait space. Shown are all components of the (A)

546

dietary and (B) foraging stratum axes, (C-F) selected individual traits—proportions of insectivorous diet

547

(C), ground foragers (D), nocturnality (E), and average body mass (F). (C-F) illustrate the interaction of

548

central latitude of mountain regions with elevational gradients of the given functional attribute. In (C-F),

549

fitted aggregate global patterns are shown in dashed red line. For highlighted regions see Fig. 1.
