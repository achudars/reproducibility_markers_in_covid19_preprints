Abstract

2
3

The zebrafish is a powerful model to explore the molecular genetics and expression of the vertebrate

4

genome. The gene break transposon (GBT) is a unique insertional mutagen that reports the expression of

5

the tagged member of the proteome while generating Cre-revertible genetic alleles. This 1000+ locus

6

collection represents novel codex expression data from the illuminated mRFP protein trap, with 36%

7

and 87% of the cloned lines showcasing to our knowledge the first described expression of these genes

8

at day 2 and day 4 of development, respectively. Analyses of 183 molecularly characterized loci indicate

9

a rich mix of genes involved in diverse cellular processes from cell signaling to DNA repair. The

10

mutagenicity of the GBT cassette is very high as assessed using both forward and reverse genetic

11

approaches. Sampling over 150 lines for visible phenotypes after 5dpf shows a similar rate of discovery

12

of embryonic phenotypes as ENU and retroviral mutagenesis. Furthermore, five cloned insertions were

13

in loci with previously described phenotypes; embryos homozygous for each of the corresponding GBT

14

alleles displayed strong loss of function phenotypes comparable to published mutants using other

15

mutagenesis strategies (ryr1b, fras1, tnnt2a, edar and hmcn1). Using molecular assessment after

16

positional cloning, to date nearly all alleles cause at least a 99+% knockdown of the tagged gene.

17

Interestingly, over 35% of the cloned loci represent 68 mutants in zebrafish orthologs of human disease

18

loci, including nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive, musculoskeletal, immune and integument

19

systems. The GBT protein trapping system enabled the construction of a comprehensive protein codex

20

including novel expression annotation, identifying new functional roles of the vertebrate genome and

21

generating a diverse collection of potential models of human disease.

Introduction

2

With the generation of more than 100 sequenced vertebrate genomes (Meadows & Lindblad-Toh, 2017),

3

the current key question is how to determine the role(s) of uncharacterized gene products in specific

4

biological and pathological processes. For example, genes associated with human disease are being

5

discovered at a rapid rate. However, the biological functions underlying this linkage is often unclear

6

(Kettleborough et al., 2013). Model system science using loss of function approaches has been essential

7

to the annotation of the genome to date including the discovery of novel processes and the biological

8

mechanisms underlying disease (Stoeger, Gerlach, Morimoto, & Nunes Amaral, 2018).

9

Among vertebrates, Danio rerio (zebrafish) has emerged as an outstanding model organism

10

amenable to both forward and reverse genetic approaches. In addition, the natural transparency of the

11

zebrafish embryo and larvae enables the unprecedented ability to non-invasively collect a rich set of

12

expression data for the proteome and in the context of an entire living vertebrate. We describe here a

13

1000+ collection of zebrafish lines made using the Protein Trap Gene- Breaking Transposon

14

(GBT;(Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011)to develop such a codex for the comparative vertebrate genomics

15

field (Meadows & Lindblad-Toh, 2017), (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011).

16

The initial pGBT-RP 2.1 (RP2.1) vector has several features that efficiency cooperate to report

17

gene sequence, expression and function (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011). Two main reporter components

18

include a 5’ protein trap and a 3’ exon trap, with the entire cassette flanked by inverted terminal repeats

19

(ITR) of the miniTol2 transposon to effectively deliver the transgene as single copy integrations into the

20

zebrafish genome. In cases where RP2 integrates in the sense orientation of a transcription unit, the

21

protein trap’s splice acceptor overrides normal splicing of the transcription unit, creating a fusion

22

between endogenous upstream exons and the monomeric RFP (mRFP) reporter sequences. The protein-

23

trap domain in RP2.1 generates the expression profile, including subsequent protein localization and

accumulation when a functional in-frame fusion between the start codon-deficient mRFP reporter and

2

the tagged protein. Mutagenesis is accomplished by the strong internal polyadenylation and putative

3

border element, effectively truncating the endogenously tagged protein. The GBT mutagenesis system

4

represented the first step toward a ‘codex’ of protein expression and functional annotation of the

5

vertebrate genome (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011).

6

We report here the development of a series of GBT protein trap vectors including versions to trap

7

expression in each of the three potential reading frames. In addition, we modified the 3’ exon trap to use

8

a localized BFP rather than the more commonly used GFP to more effectively use these lines in

9

conjunction with other transgenic fish. We deployed these vectors at scale, generating over 1000 protein

10

trap lines with visible mRFP expression at either 2dpf (end of embryogenesis) or 4dpf (larval stage),

11

with 36% and 87% of the cloned lines showcasing to our knowledge the first described expression of

12

these genes at these stages, respectively. We used forward and reverse genetic tests to assess the

13

mutagenicity of these vectors, noting similar rates of visible phenotypes at 5dpf as ENU and retroviral

14

screening tools. We re-isolated five previously described loci, and embryos homozygous for each of the

15

corresponding GBT alleles displayed strong loss of function phenotypes comparable to these previously

16

published mutants generated using other mutagenesis strategies (ryr1b, fras1, tnnt2a, edar and hmcn1).

17

Molecular assessment after positional cloning shows that nearly all alleles cause at least a 99+%

18

knockdown of the tagged gene. Interestingly, over 35% of the cloned loci represent 68 mutants in

19

zebrafish orthologs of human disease loci, including nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive,

20

musculoskeletal, immune and integument systems. The GBT protein trapping system enabled the

21

construction of a comprehensive protein codex including novel expression annotation, identifying new

22

functional roles of the vertebrate genome and generating a diverse collection of potential models of

23

human disease.

pGBT-RP8.1 was made by cloning a mini-intron derived from carp beta actin intron 1 into pGBT-RP7.1.

3

The 234bp SalI to XhoI mini-intron fragment was isolated from pCR4-bactmIntron following digestion.

4

The pGBT-RP7.1 plasmid was digested with XhoI so that the SalI to XhoI fragment was cloned between

5

the gamma-crystallin promoter and nls tagBFP.

6
7

pCR4-bactmIntron was made by removing a 1.1kb internal portion of the carp beta actin intron 1 by

8

digestion of pCR4-bact_I1 with BstBI and BssHII, followed by filling in 5’ overhangs and ligating

9

remaining vector fragment.

10
11

pCR4-bact_I1 was cloning a PCR product containing the carp beta-actin intron into pCR4-TOPO

12

(Invitrogen). The intron was amplified from pGBT-RP2.1 (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011) using MISC-

13

bact_exon-F1 [CAGCTAGTGCGGAATATCATCTGCC] and MISC-bact_intron-R1

14

[CTTCTCGAGGTGAATTCCGGCTGAACTGTA] primers.

16

pGBT-RP7.1 was made by replacing a 501bp PstI to PstI fragment of pGBT-RP6.1 with a 480bp PstI to

17

PstI fragment of pRP2.1. This changed the nucleotide sequence between the carp beta-actin splice

18

acceptor to replicate the sequences in pGBT-RP2.1. pGBT-RP7.1 was never directly tested in zebrafish.

19
20

pGBT-RP6.1 was made by flipping the internal trap cassette relative the Tol2 inverted terminal repeats

21

in pGBT-RP5.1. To do this, pGBT-RP5.1 was cut with EcoRV and SmaI. The 2.27kb EcoRV to SmaI

22

vector backbone fragment, which included the ITRs, was ligated to the 3.51kb EcoRV to SmaI trap

fragment. pGBT-RP6.1 was then selected based on the right ITR of Tol2 being in front of the RFP trap,

2

which is the same orientation of pGBT-RP2.1.

3
4

pGBT-RP5.1 was made by cloning a PCR product with the AUG-less mRFP into pre(-1)GBT-RP5.1.

5

The 698bp mRFP* PCR product was obtained by amplification of pGBT-R15 (Clark, Balciunas, et al.,

6

2011) with CDS-mRFP*-F1 [AAGAATTCGAAGGTGCCTCCTCCGAGGATGTCATCAAGG] and

7

CDS-mRFP-R1 [AAACTAGTCTTAGGCTCCGGTGGAGTGGCGG]. Prior to cloning the PCR

8

mRFP* product was digested with EcoRI and SpeI to prepare the ends for subcloning into pre(-1)GBT-

9

RP5.1 that was opened between the carp beta actin splice acceptor and the ocean pout terminator.

10
11

pre(-1)GBT-RP5.1 was made by cloning 1.2kb SpeI to AvrII fragment from pGBT-PX (Sivasubbu et al.,

12

2006) that contained the ocean pout terminator into the SpeI site of pre(-2)GBT-RP5.1. The resulting

13

products were screened for the proper orientation of the ocean pout terminator relative to the carp beta

14

actin splice acceptor.

15
16

pre(-2)GBT-RP5.1 was made by inserting an expression cassette to make a 3’ poly(A) trap that makes

17

blue lenses. A 1.15kb SpeI to BglII fragment from pKTol2gC-nlsTagBFP was cloned into pre(-3)GBT-

18

RP5.1 that had been cut with AvrII and BglII. This moved the Xenopus gamma crystallin promoter

19

driving a nuclear-localized TagBFP in front of the carp beta actin splice donor within pre(-3)GBT-RP5.1

20

to create a localized BFP poly(A) trap signal replacing the ubiquitous GFP signal that was in pGBT-

21

RP2.1.

Fluorescent microscopy of mRFP reporter protein expression

17

Larvae were treated with 0.2 mM phenylthiocarbamide at 1 dpf to inhibit pigment formation. The

18

anesthetized fish were mounted in 1.5% agarose (Fisher Scientific BP1360) prepared with 0.017mg/ml

19

tricaine solution in an agarose column in the imaging chamber. The protocol of ApoTome microscopy

20

was described in previous publication. (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011) For Lightsheet microscopy, larval

21

zebrafish were anesthetized with 0.017g/ml tricaine (Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt) in

22

embryo water during imaging procedure. To capture RFP expression patterns of 2 dpf and 4 dpf larval

23

zebrafish, LP 560 nm filter as excitation and LP 585nm as emission was used for Lightsheet microscopy.

5’ and 3’ RACE PCRs: The protocol used was designed to use cDNA to amplify and clone junction

2

fragments of Tol2-based gene-break transposons (GBT) in the zebrafish genome. 5' RACE allows PCR

3

amplification of unknown sequence at the 5' end of a cDNA as long as there is enough known sequence

4

within the cDNA to design two antisense primers. Although modified, it is based on the protocol in

5

described in (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011). The following primer mixtures were prepared: for primary

6

PCR: 0.20 μM GBT specific primer (5R-mRFP-P1), and a mix of universal 5’ RACE primers 2.5 μM

7

5R-UP-S and 0.5 μM 5R-UP-L . Secondary reaction: 25 μM GSP (5R-mRFP-P2), and 25 μM universal

Forward genetic screening with next-generation sequencing

2

Isolated genomic DNA (300-500ng) was digested with MseI, and BfaI in parallel for 3h at 37°C and

3

heat inactivated for 10 min at 80°C. The digested samples from each enzyme were pooled with

4

prealiquoted barcoded linker in individual wells. The T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) was

5

added, and the reaction mix was incubated for 2 h at 16°C. The linker-mediated PCR was performed in

6

two steps. In the first step, PCR was done with one primer specific to the 3’- ITR (5’-

7

GACTTGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGG-3’) and the other primer specific to linker sequences (5’-

8

GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC- 3’) using the following conditions: 2 min at 95°C, 25 cycles of 15

9

sec at 95°C, 30 seconds at 55°C and 30 seconds at 72°C. The PCR products were diluted to 1:50 in

10

dH2O, and a second round of PCR was performed using ITR (5’-

11

TCACTTGAGTAAAATTTTTGAGTACTTTTTACACCTC-3’) and linker specific (5’ -

12

GCGTGGTCGACTGCGCAT-3’) nested primers to increase sensitivity and avoid non- specific

13

amplification using the following conditions: 2 min at 95°C, 20 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 30 seconds at

14

58°C and 30 seconds at 72°C. The nested PCR products from each 96-well plate are pooled and

Results

The features of GBT constructs RP2 and RP8 – capturing all three proteomic reading frames

3

In our previous study, we reported the intronic-based gene-breaking transposons (GBTs) as effective and

4

revertible loss-of function tools for zebrafish (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011). The main features of the

5

RP2.1 vector system are as follows (Fig1A): 1) Genetically engineered cargo is flanked by miniTol2

6

sequences necessary and sufficient for Tol2 transposase-mediated transposition, an efficient transgenesis

7

vector in zebrafish (Kawakami et al., 2004); (Balciunas et al., 2006); (Urasaki, Morvan, & Kawakami,

8

2006); 2) protein trap that enables in vivo expression selection of the vertebrate proteome. The addition

9

of the AUG-free mRFP reporter has yielded an effective protein trap for both organ-specific and

10

subcellular localization of the tagged locus (Petzold et al., 2009); (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011); (Liao

11

et al., 2012);(Xu et al., 2012);(Ding et al., 2013); (Westcot et al., 2015); 3) Mutagenic transcriptional

12

terminator. The 5’ cassette is a combination of a strong splice-acceptor (SA), poly adenylation signal

13

(pA), and putative border element (red octagon) in conjunction with a start codon (AUG)-free

14

monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) reporter. These elements have been shown to be effective as

15

a transcriptional stop in zebrafish by hijacking endogenous splicing (Sivasubbu et al., 2006). These

16

elements are very effective at inducing a quantitative knockdown in all 26 lines assessed to date using

17

qRT-PCR; 97% or higher knockdown in all lines (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011); (Ding et al., 2013);

18

(Ding et al., 2016), this manuscript). The GBT mutagenesis system is thus an effective first step to

19

creating a gene codex simultaneously combining expression and loss of function genetics.

20

However, some limitations were noted with the initial RP2.1 vector – notably the effective trapping of

21

transcripts without detectable expression of the mRFP reporter. Molecular cloning of these GFP+/RFP-

22

lines demonstrated the fidelity of expression requiring the capture of an appropriate reading frame.

23

RP2.1 was designed to use one main reading frame, and some lines with expression were noted to

include the use of a secondary splice acceptor (data not shown). To maximize genome coverage of this

2

insertional mutagen, we created all three reading frames of the RP2 and RP8 vector series (Fig. 1). 4) 3’

3

exon trap. These vectors also encodes a 3’ exon trap with preferential expression following intragenic

4

insertions in zebrafish (Sivasubbu et al., 2006); (Petzold et al., 2009); (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011).

5

The function of this cassette complements the obligate, in-frame protein trapping effect and is used for

6

both quality control during mutagenesis and for genotyping of more weakly expressing protein trap

7

alleles (Fig.1A). In the RP2 vector series, the nearly ubiquitous b-actin promoter drives expression of

8

GFP. Expression of integrated GFP becomes detectable between early developmental stages such as

9

seven- to eight-somite-stage and provides bright expression with a good signal-to-noise ratio at 25 hpf

10

(Davidson AE et al., 2003). However, the ubiquitous GFP expression from the 3’ exon trap cassettes

11

could interfere with another fluorescent marker system based on GFP labeling in further studies. The

12

RP8 vector series includes all reading frames for the AUG-free mRFP reporter and a new 3’ exon trap

13

cassette with expression of tagBFP driven by the lens-specific gamma-crystalline promoter (Fig. 1B).

14

Using the tissue-specific reporter system with BFP is helpful to easily detect F1 founder with weak

15

mRFP expression and to avoid interference with GFP-based multi-labeling purposes when crossed with

16

other GFP-labeled transgenic fish lines. 5) Revertible mutagenic cassette. The flanking loxP sites enable

17

reversion of the tagged locus by Cre – mediated recombination. This facilitates both somatic (Clark,

18

Balciunas, et al., 2011); (Ding et al., 2013) and germline approaches (Petzold et al., 2009).

19

We generated more than eleven hundred independent lines by using all six constructs of the GBT system

20

(Supplemental Table 1). We conducted an initial screening expression of the mRFP fusion protein and

21

showed that RP2 and RP8 vector series with all reading frames of mRFP reporter protein readily detects

22

the distribution of the fusion proteins expressed from their own promoter in zebrafish (Supplemental

23

Figure 1).

Annotation of protein localization and trafficking of the GBT strain collection

3

The ability to non-invasively obtain temporal and spatial expression pattern information is a key feature

4

of these protein trap strains. Pilot data from our first RFP lines rapidly demonstrated this step was going

5

to be a major bottleneck for our pipeline if we used standard documentation methods. Consequently, we

6

established a capillary-based confinement and imaging protocol (SCORE imaging; (Petzold et al., 2010)

7

for quickly capturing and holding living zebrafish for rapid, high quality fluorescent expression in

8

precise longitudinal imaging angles. The animals are easily inserted into a capillary of the correct

9

diameter for the particular fish stage, then placed on the microscope and covered with a matched

10

solution to remove the optical distortion from the capillary housing. The capillary is simply rotated for

11

precise 0 degree (dorsal), 90 degree (lateral), and 180 degree (ventral) images on standard fluorescent

12

microscopes, such as the Apotome. The technical bottleneck of standard microscopy to scan a whole

13

embryo and larva is also labor-intensive and time-consuming. For instance, fluorescent scanning of a

14

quarter of a 2dpf or 4dpf larvae required about 15 min exposure using a Zeiss Apotome microscope, one

15

imaging modality deployed for this collection. To accelerate the expression profiling of these GBT lines,

16

we subsequently utilized a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 SPIM microscope. The Lightsheet enabled high speed

17

scanning of a whole embryo or larva, resulting in a nearly 20x faster image acquisition rate than the

18

primary imaging process utilizing the Apotome. We prioritized and cataloged lines with robust

19

expression at 2 and 4 days post fertilization (dpf). All zebrafish lines are freely available now through

20

zfishbook (Clark et al., 2012) and are partially accessible from the Zebrafish International Resource

21

Center. Consequently, we have generated 1138 lines by using each vector system showing in

22

Supplemental Table 1), and updated results are posted at zfishbook.

1

Our throughput for cloning the GBT lines using traditional molecular methods was clearly an initial

2

bottleneck. To help address this, we deployed a rapid cloning process based on methods used to isolate

3

retroviral integrations (Varshney, Huang, et al., 2013; Varshney, Lu, et al., 2013). This method

4

leverages the massive parallel sequencing technology of the Illumina MiSeq, yielding 101 bp

5

sequencing reads, followed by a custom bioinformatics pipeline that involves both mapping and

6

annotation. Fin-clips from four male animals per GBT locus are obtained during sperm cryopreservation

7

and are used as a source of DNA. Shared inserts in multiple individuals from a single GBT line are

8

considered candidate loci. This information is subsequently used to generate gene-specific primers to

9

manually confirm linkage using 5‘ or 3’RACE, inverse PCR, or TAIL PCR to generate locus-specific

10

primers for downstream molecular genotyping applications. 212 of the lines met the highest stringency

11

of confirmed expression linkage and are classified as confirmed GBT integrations. An additional 143

12

lines have been initially tagged using this high throughput method, yielding candidate integration

13

annotation as listed in zfishbook. The ability to complete the annotation status from candidate to

14

confirmed for any given GBT locus with a desired expression profile is enhanced by the continued

15

refinement of the zebrafish genome.

17

mRFP Expression profiling reveals overlap with known annotation at 2dpf and substantive new

18

expression data at both 2dpf and 4dpf

19

GBT lines are currently imaged to capture mRFP expression at both 2 and 4 dpf, including dorsal,

20

sagittal and ventral views using the SCORE imaging method. (Petzold et al., 2010) In an openly

21

accessible database of GBT lines, zfishbook, the images of mRFP expression pattern were stored within

22

the media gallery associated with each line (Clark et al., 2012). We summarized published expression

23

data of the tagged genes in both zfishbook and ZFIN in Table 1. Imaging the localization of transcripts

and proteins at 4dpf is more difficult than those at 2 dpf, because accessibility of antisense RNA probes

2

and antibodies into the larva’s body is technically limited for in the methods of both in situ hybridization

3

and immunohistochemistry. Compared with the published data of gene expression in ZFIN, zfishbook

4

currently provides almost the double number of genes with expression data at 2 dpf and 14 times the

5

number of genes with expression data at 4 dpf (Table 1). In addition, zfishbook also provides novel

6

expression data for 61 genes at any developmental stage (Fig.2).

8

High knockdown efficiency of endogenous transcripts induced by RP2

9

We directly compared published transposon insertional mutant vector systems (Fig. 3). The range and

10

average knockdown levels in the FlipTrap system (Trinh le et al., 2011) produced a range of 4-30% (70-

11

96% knockdown capacity) in six tested fish alleles, a similar range to our initial R-series protein trap

12

vectors (R14-R15) that used a simple transcriptional terminator (Liao et al., 2012; Petzold et al., 2009)

13

The pFT1 appears to be an improvement over these systems, in which the overall range and average

14

read-through is reduced to 6-11% (89-94% knockdown) from four tested fish alleles (T. T. Ni et al.,

15

2012). In contrast, the RP2.1 vector (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011), (Ding et al., 2013), (Ding et al.,

16

2016) and this manuscript) maintains a strong knockdown (1% or less read-through) in 26 lines tested.

17

Though deployed here using a nearly random, transposon-based delivery platform, the GBT vector

18

system is an effective insertional mutagen suitable for an array of other – including targeted integration -

19

genome-wide applications.

We conducted an initial forward genetic screen on embryos and early larvae of 179 RFP-positive GBT

2

lines, identifying 12 recessive phenotypes, such as ryr1b, fras1, tnnt2a, edar and hmcn1,(Clark,

3

Balciunas, et al., 2011; Westcot et al., 2015) visible during the first five days of development including

4

lethality, heart, muscle, skin and other phenotypes. This 7% recovery of visible early developmental

5

mutants is very similar to the 5% recovered visible mutants from the Sanger TILLING consortium

6

analysis of truncated zebrafish genes (Kettleborough et al., 2013). This 7% is also comparable to prior

7

retroviral (Amsterdam & Hopkins, 2004) and ENU(Haffter et al., 1996) zebrafish mutagenesis work that

8

estimated between 1400 and 2400 genes (~5-9% of the genome) would result in a visible embryonic

9

phenotype when mutated.

10
11

GBT alleles phenocopy known embryonic mutations

12

We tested the first five GBT lines in genes with known loss of function mutant phenotypes (ryr1b;

13

fras1; tnnt2a; edar; hmcn1). All five of these alleles in genes with described loss of function defects are

14

phenocopied by these GBT insertional alleles (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011); (Westcot et al., 2015); this

15

manuscript). These loci represent a critical internal methods reference further validating the

16

mutagenicity of these novel insertional vectors.

18

Gene ontology analysis of GBT-tagged loci

19

To assess the diversity of GBT loci molecularly characterized to date, we utilized the PANTHER

20

classification system (v.14.0, pantherdb.org , (Mi et al., 2013) and generated a table of protein class

21

ontology tags in the molecularly isolated GBT lines. The PANTHER Protein Class ontology was

22

adapted from the PANTHER INDEX (PANTHER/X) ontology that comprises two types of

23

classifications: molecular function and biological process and includes commonly used classes of

protein families. The molecular function schema classifies a protein based on its biochemical properties,

2

such as receptor, cell adhesion molecule, or kinase. The biological process schema classifies a protein

3

based on the cellular role or process in which it is involved, for example, carbohydrate metabolism

4

(cellular role), TCA cycle (pathway), neuronal activities (process), or developmental processes (process)

5

(Thomas PD et al, 2013). As of April 2018, almost half of known zebrafish genes (10626/25289 genes)

6

were tagged in the PANTHER Protein Class ontology. 168 of our cloned GBT alleles mapped in the

7

PANTHER system with 21 types of Protein Classes (Table 2). 18% and 16 % of the mapped GBT

8

alleles are classified to nucleic acid binding (PC00171) and transcription factor (PC00218), respectively

9

(Fig. 4). This result reveals that a quarter of the mapped genes possibly play a role in regulatory

10

processes. Overall, however, the rich diversity of protein classes observed in our cloned traps suggests a

11

large diversity will be represented by the overall collection and consistent with the random nature of

12

genome integration events by the Tol2 transposon (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011).

Disease-causing human orthologues of GBT-tagged genes

15

Of 183 GBT-tagged genes, 171 human orthologues were annotated in at least one public database such

16

as ZFIN, Ensembl, Homologene, and InParanoid (Table 3). Several human orthologues were

17

provisionally annotated using BLASTP and a synteny analysis tool, SynFind. In a previous study

18

comparing the list of human genes possessing at least one zebrafish orthologue with the 3,176 genes

19

bearing morbidity descriptions that are listed in the OMIM database, 82 % morbid genes 2,601 genes)

20

can be related to at least one zebrafish orthologue (Howe et al., 2013). Surprisingly, 67 genes (about

Novel Expression Annotation Revealed By Protein Trapping of Endogenous Genes

3

The RP2 and RP8 vectors of GBT system were assembled to capture all three reading frames of fusion

4

protein of the trapped gene with the mRFP reporter. This GBT system reveals that mRFP-truncated

5

fusion proteins exhibit distinct subcellular localization. This is particularly noteworthy for the 4dpf

6

stages because published gene expression data at late developmental stages have been limited by the

7

technical difficulties in conducting such analyses using traditional techniques such as whole mount in

8

situ hybridization (WISH) at these larval and later time points. We note that the mRFP-truncated fusion

9

protein may localize ectopically in cases where the protein localization signal is contained in the C-

10

terminal domain (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011; Trinh le & Fraser, 2013). Although the extent that

11

subcellular localization recapitulates the endogenous protein is dependent on each insertion locus

12

specifics, the visualizing and illuminating spatiotemporal expression patterns of trapped protein may

13

facilitate dynamic studies of specific cell types and molecular functions in a living vertebrate. The novel

14

expression description at 4dpf in nearly five of six cloned loci demonstrates the dearth of 3D expression

15

annotation for the overwhelming number of genes, even in one of the most studied model system such as

16

the zebrafish. With ever-improving microscope-based imaging tools (Liu et al., 2018), these lines have

17

the potential to help annotate at diverse developmental and adult stages, while also potentially imaging

18

subcellular expression for a subset of protein trap fusions.

Gene-Break Protein Trap in an Effective Insertional Mutagen with High Knockdown Efficiency

21

and Cre-Reversion to WT allele

1

Transposons offer several unique features over and above traditional static mutational approaches,

2

including high quality expression tools and new regulated mutagenesis methodologies. From the

3

perspective of genome engineering development, GBT technology was the first method for revertible

4

allele generation of vertebrates outside of the mouse (Clark, Balciunas, et al., 2011); (Ding et al., 2013).

5

We know two major potential biases that may yield non-random trapping coverage of the genome. First,

6

the RP2.1 protein trap was initially designed around a single reading frame. Upon molecular analysis of

7

our first lines, however, we discovered that RP2.1 encodes a second, alternative splice acceptor yielding

8

protein trap expression from a second reading frame due to this alternative splicing event in a significant

9

number of our lines. The deliberate development of RP2 and RP8 vectors for each reading frame

10

obviates this potential limitation when used in other delivery modalities besides the Tol2 transposon. For

11

example, these vectors would be suitable for gene editing-based targeted knockin methods.

12

The GBT system deployed here has been joined by two new and complementary transposon

13

mutagenesis systems. The FlipTrap system by Dr. Fraser’s group(Trinh le et al., 2011), which can be

14

mutagenic when provided Cre recombinase, is primarily focused on imaging fusion proteins in vivo and

15

addressing cellular dynamics and related questions. The FT1 system by the Chen lab is a complementary

16

flipping trap that can use either Cre or Flp recombinases to regulate alleles depend on the original

17

orientation of the insertion (T. T. Ni et al., 2012). GBT-based zebrafish alleles are highly

18

complementary and non-redundant to those generated by other mutagenesis methods, including these

19

other transposons and demonstrated higher knockdown efficiency of the WT transcripts than those

20

mutagens because of the use of an enhanced polyadenylation signal and a putative boundary element

21

between 5’ protein trap and 3’ exon trap cassettes. Importantly, since the initiation of this project to

22

generate a collection of Cre-revertible mutant alleles, several groups have now reported collections of

23

tissue-specific Cre driver lines including the Brand lab (Jungke et al., 2013; http://crezoo.crt26

The GBT system described here is a two-component, molecularly regulatable mutagenesis approach that

3

offers the ability to test for the sufficiency of protein-encoding loci in regulated, tissue- and cell- specific

Functional Diversity of the Trapped Proteins by the GBT system

7

To analyze distribution of protein functions of the trapped genes by GBT system, we performed GO

8

analysis using the PANTHER protein classification. Although the protein functions related in

9

transcriptional regulatory process, such as nucleic acid binding and transcription factors represented one

10

relatively common class of isolated genes, the protein GO analysis indicated that the GBT protein trap

11

was a useful tool for capturing a wide range of protein functions in addition to cell fate regulators and

12

related nuclear genes.

Cloned GBT Loci Represent a Rich Collection of Potential Human Disease Models

15

More than 7,000 human diseases have already been described, and 80% of those are thought to have a

16

genetic origin (Varga et al., 2018). Model organism studies can be a pivotal resource for understanding

17

gene function which possibly provides additional insight into the cause of particular disease, thereby

18

contributing to understanding of the pathogenic process and discovery of the therapeutic strategy

19

(Wangler et al., 2017). Annotation of human orthologues of 160 tagged genes revealed that GBT

20

technology yield a high frequency potential human disease models with loss of gene function, tracking

21

expression of the truncated protein and Cre-revertible mutated allele to rescue the phenotype.

Furthermore, the modeling human genetic diseases using the GBT system has advantages compared

2

with reverse genetic approaches such as TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9 systems. In initial phenotype

3

screening, PR2.1 mutagenesis demonstrated 7% phenotype appearance as much as the other ENU- and

4

retroviral forward genetic screenings (Amsterdam & Hopkins, 2004; Haffter et al., 1996; Kettleborough

5

et al., 2013). For example, the annotation of disease-causing human orthologues of the tagged genes also

6

revealed that the GBT system comprehensively developed mutants in zebrafish orthologues of human

7

disease loci, including nervous, cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive, musculoskeletal, immune, and

8

integument systems. Surprisingly, this system generated 68 of pioneering mutants in orthologs of human

9

disease loci (Supplemental Table 2).

11

Discovery of Novel Transcripts by Trapping Unpredicted Genes

12

Since the completion of the zebrafish reference genome sequencing, it has enabled many new

13

discoveries to be made, in particular the positional cloning of hundreds genes from mutation affecting

14

embryogenesis behavior, physiology, and health and disease. However, a few poorly assembled regions

15

remain (Howe et al., 2013). In molecular cloning of GBT lines generated, we found that a surprising

16

proportion of the sequenced insertions does not correspond to any predicted genes. Although we have

17

not formally excluded that mRFP expression might, in some case, be an artifact, the data of gene

18

prediction provided in genome databases reveals some prediction errors. These results suggest that the

19

algorithms used to predict genes from genome databases have missed a significant number of genes. The

20

protein trapping by using GBT system may useful in identifying unsuspected novel genes, expressions

21

and functions in vivo in real time.

New Genomic Insights Using the GBT Random Insertion Mutagen

2

The ready ease of these mRFP-based protein traps for basic expression analyses demonstrates how much

3

we do not know about our overall proteome and the codex that is our genome. Nearly forty percent and

4

five of six of the cloned genes show no expression at 2dpf and 4dpf, respectively, in ZFIN. At the

5

subcellular level, such protein traps in conjunction with new microscopy techniques represent just

6

another method for cellular and mechanistic analyses in an in vivo cellular context. Although these were

7

made using random insertional approaches, new targeted integration tools using gene editing such as

8

GeneWeld(Wierson et al., 2018) should readily empower labs to build their custom GBT lines in the

9

future for genes not in this collection. Together, this initial 1100+ GBT collection is a new contribution

10

to the use of the zebrafish to annotate the vertebrate genome.
