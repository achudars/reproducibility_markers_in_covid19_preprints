ABSTRACT
Mediator is an essential, multisubunit complex that functions as a transcriptional
coactivator in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms. Mediator has four conserved
modules, Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase, and has been implicated in nearly all aspects of
gene regulation. The Tail module has been shown to recruit the Mediator complex to the
enhancer or UAS regions of genes via interactions with transcription factors, and the
Kinase domain facilitates the transition of Mediator from the UAS/enhancer to the
preinitiation complex via protein phosphorylation. Here we analyze expression of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene using a sin4 Mediator Tail mutation that separates
the Tail module from the rest of the complex; the sin4 mutation permits independent
recruitment of the Tail module to promoters without the rest of Mediator. Significant
increases in recruitment of the SWI/SNF and SAGA coactivators to the HO promoter
UAS were observed in a sin4 mutant, along with increased gene activation. These results
are consistent with recent studies that have suggested the Kinase module functions
negatively to inhibit activation by the Tail. However, we found that Kinase module
mutations did not mimic the effect of a sin4 mutation on HO expression. This suggests
that at HO the core Mediator complex (Middle and Head modules) must play a role in
limiting Tail binding to the promoter UAS and gene activation. We propose that the core
Mediator complex helps modulate Mediator binding to the UAS regions of genes to limit
coactivator recruitment and ensure proper regulation of gene transcription.

INTRODUCTION
Mediator is a large multisubunit transcriptional coactivator complex that is conserved
throughout eukaryotes. Mediator was first identified in budding yeast as a bridge between
general transcription factors (GTFs) and RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII; Thompson et al.
1993; Kim et al. 1994; Koleske and Young 1994). Currently, Mediator has been
implicated in nearly all facets of gene regulation: transcriptional initiation and elongation

(reviewed in Malik and Roeder 2000; Poss et al. 2013; Soutourina 2018), chromatin
architecture (Allen and Taatjes 2015; Hsieh et al. 2015), mRNA processing and export
(Huang et al. 2012; Schneider et al. 2015), and transcriptional memory (Zhang et al.
2013a; D'urso et al. 2016). Together these activities allow Mediator to modulate
activation and expression required for proper gene regulation.
In yeast, mediator contains 25 subunits that are organized into four conserved
modules: Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase. The Head and Middle domains are essential for
viability and thus make up the ‘core’ Mediator (Jeronimo and Robert 2017). Both of
these modules interact with RNAPII as well as with GTFs required for transcriptional
initiation and elongation. The Tail module attaches to the core Mediator through the
Med14 (Rgr1) scaffold subunit (Tsai et al. 2014) and interacts with sequence-specific
transcription factors that recruit the Mediator complex to the UAS or enhancers of genes
(Bhoite et al. 2001; Kagey et al. 2010; Jeronimo and Robert 2014). The tail module is
required for efficient recruitment of Mediator and Pol II to promoters (Knoll et al. 2018).
The Kinase module is freely dissociable and attaches to the Middle module of Mediator
via an interaction with its Med13 subunit. As part of the Mediator complex, the
Kinase/CDK8 module antagonizes the function of the Tail module (Van De Peppel et al.
2005; Jeronimo and Robert 2017) and facilitates the transition of Mediator from the UAS
to the preinitiation complex (PIC; Jeronimo et al. 2016; Petrenko et al. 2016).
Distinct forms of Mediator have been identified with and without the dissociable
Kinase module (Poss et al. 2013), and additional stable forms have been identified
through mutations of specific Mediator subunits. Deletion of the SIN4 (MED16) gene or a
C-terminal truncation of the Med14 scaffold subunit each results in a stable tail-less
Mediator complex and an independent Tail subcomplex composed of Med2, Pgd1
(Med3) and Gal11 (Med15) (Li et al. 1995). Yeast cells lacking the Mediator tail
complex are viable but have pronounced defects in regulating a large subset of genes (Li
et al. 1995; Larsson et al. 2013). This is likely due to the inability to recruit core

Mediator and the CDK8/Kinase module to the UAS of these genes (Jeronimo et al. 2016;
Petrenko et al. 2016). Changes in global chromatin structure (Macatee et al. 1997) and
increased long-distance transcription factor activation (Dobi and Winston 2007) have also
been reported during separation of the Tail subcomplex via disruption of SIN4.
Disruption of SIN4 has been studied extensively at the HO promoter (Stillman et al.
1994; Tabtiang and Herskowitz 1998; Yu et al. 2000; Li et al. 2005). HO expression is
under substantial regulation (Stillman 2013) and typically requires sequential activation
at two distinct upstream regulatory regions, URS1 and URS2 (Nasmyth 1985; Cosma et
al. 1999; Bhoite et al. 2001). Sequence-specific transcription factors Swi5 and SBF
(Swi4/6 complex) bind to URS1 and URS2, respectively, and recruit the SWI/SNF,
SAGA, and Mediator coactivator complexes. Loss of any of these factors results in
defective HO activation. Disruption of SIN4, however, suppresses the requirement for
SBF binding to URS2, and allows robust HO expression even when the Gcn5 catalytic
subunit of SAGA is mutated (Yu et al. 2000). Mediator is initially recruited to the HO
promoter via an interaction between Swi5 and the Gal11 Tail subunit (Bhoite et al. 2001),
and it is likely that disruption of SIN4 results in failure to recruit the ‘core’ Mediator
and/or the Kinase/CDK8 and/or tail-less ‘core’ Mediator to the URS regions.
In this study, we further investigated the effects of disrupting SIN4 at the HO
promoter, and we explored the mechanism behind the resulting suppression of key
regulatory events. We found that disrupting SIN4 resulted in significant increases in both
transcription factor and coactivator binding at the HO promoter, and that these increases
are mostly due to prolonged persistence of these factors at the promoter. In agreement
with this result, we also observed elevated and persistent nucleosome eviction during HO
promoter activation. These results likely explain the suppression of multiple HO
promoter mutants by sin4Δ. Surprisingly, we were unable to reproduce these results by
mutating the catalytic subunit of the Kinase module, ruling out the simple model that the
observed effects were due to loss of antagonistic effects of the Kinase module on Tail

function. Rather, we found that elevated coactivator binding and suppression of promoter
mutants were completely dependent on the presence of the Mediator Tail subcomplex. As
we do not observe these effects with whole Mediator, we propose that the core Mediator
must restrict the binding of either the Tail subcomplex or other transcription
factors/coactivators to limit promoter activation and ensure proper regulation of gene
transcription.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 and are isogenic in the W303
background (Thomas and Rothstein 1989). Standard genetic methods were used for strain
construction (Rothstein 1991; Sherman 1991). The 5X-sbf, +700, and +1300 HO
promoter mutants were described in (Yarrington et al. 2015), and the ho(m-2700)
mutation was described in (Yu et al. 2016). C-terminal epitope tags were added as
described (Knop et al. 1999), using plasmids pZC03 (pFA6a-TEV-6xGly-V5-HIS3MX;
Addgene plasmid #44073) and pZC13 (pFA6a-TEV-6xGly-V5-HphMX; Addgene
plasmid #44085), provided by Zaily Connell and Tim Formosa, and plasmid pYM6
(Knop et al. 1999), provided by Elmar Schiebel. Strain YTT1722 with a
SWI2:FLAG(3):KanMX tag (Kim et al. 2006) was provided by David Clark, and the
Marker Swap method (Voth et al. 2003) was used to convert it to SWI2:FLAG(3):Nat MX
using plasmid pAG25 (Goldstein and Mccusker 1999) provided by John McCusker.
Oligos used in strain construction are available upon request.
Cell cycle synchronization was performed by galactose withdrawal and re-addition
with a GALp::CDC20 strain grown at 25°C in YP medium containing 2% galactose and
2% raffinose (Bhoite et al. 2001). A high degree of synchrony was confirmed by
examination of budding indices and analysis of cycle-regulated mRNAs. In all other
experiments, cells were grown at 30°C in YPAD medium (Sherman 1991).

ChIPs were performed as described (Bhoite et al. 2001; Voth et al. 2007) using
mouse monoclonal antibody to the V5 epitope (SV5-Pk1, Abcam) or anti-histone H3 (07690, Upstate), and antibody-coated magnetic beads (Rabbit and Pan Mouse IgG beads,
Life Technologies). Samples prepared for ChIPs were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde
overnight on ice. ChIP assays were analyzed by real time qPCR as described (Eriksson et
al. 2004). ChIP qPCR primers are available upon request. H3 samples were first
normalized to the ChIP signal at the IGR-I gene-free reference region on chromosome I
(Mason and Struhl 2005), while Swi4-V5 ChIP samples were first normalized to the
CLN1 promoter, and then both types of ChIPs were normalized to their respective input
DNA sample. Unless otherwise noted, error bars reflect the standard deviation of at least
three biological samples. P-values were calculated by paired t-tests.
RNA was isolated from either synchronized or logarithmically growing cells, and HO
mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR as described (Voth et al. 2007). For all
logarithmically grown strains, RNA expression was normalized to RPR1 expression and
graphed relative to wild-type expression. For the synchrony experiment, RNA expression
was normalized to RPR1 expression and graphed relative to the peak WT expression.
Unless otherwise noted, error bars reflect the standard deviation of at least three
biological samples. P-values were calculated by paired t-tests. RT-qPCR primers are
available upon request.
Single cell analysis of HO expression was performed by time-lapse fluorescence
microscopy as described (Zhang et al., 2013).

We have previously demonstrated that sin4Δ can rescue HO expression when the
Swi6 subunit of SBF is also disrupted (Yu et al. 2000). The SBF complex, however, is an
important transcriptional regulator with numerous binding sites at genes controlling the
G1/S transition (Andrews and Herskowitz 1989), and our previous suppression result
could have been impacted by alterations to the yeast cell cycle. To demonstrate the
impact of sin4Δ specifically at the HO gene, we made use of HO promoter mutants that
either eliminated SBF sites at the left-half of URS2 (URS2L) or increased the distance
between URS1 and URS2 (Fig 1; Yarrington et al. 2015). Both of these mutation classes
drastically reduce SBF binding to the entire URS2 region with corresponding decreases
in HO expression (Yarrington et al. 2015).
HO expression results confirmed previous findings that SBF is essential for WTlevels of HO expression and that sin4Δ is capable of suppressing a SWI6 disruption (Fig
1B). Interestingly, we observed that sin4Δ alone resulted in elevated HO expression
compared to WT. Additionally, mutation of the five SBF sites at the left-half of URS2
(the 5x-sbf construct, Fig 1B) or inserting 700bp of CDC39 exon sequence between
URS1 and URS2 (+700, Fig 1C) resulted in deceases in HO expression similar to that
seen in a swi6 mutant. In both cases, however, disruption of SIN4 rescued HO expression
to levels similar to that of WT. As mutating the HO promoter does not affect cell cycle
progression, these results indicate that suppression of swi6Δ by sin4Δ is not an artifact of
cell cycle impairment. Furthermore, as SBF binding to the right half of URS2 (URS2R) is
essential for HO expression (Yarrington et al. 2015), these results suggest that sin4Δ or
Mediator Tail separation allows SBF binding to URS2R under circumstances when it is
normally prohibited, such as mutation of SBF sites at URS2L or insertion of 700bp
between URS1 and URS2. This suppression is not without limits as the reduced HO
expression caused by a 1300bp insertion between URS1 and URS2 (+1300) was not
suppressed by sin4Δ (Fig 1C).

We next wanted to test the hypothesis that disruption of SIN4 rescues SBF binding to
URS2 in our HO promoter mutants. We have previously shown that mutation of SBF
sites at URS2L or increasing the distance between URS1 and URS2 inhibits binding of
SBF to the entire URS2 region (Yarrington et al. 2015). To test whether sin4Δ can rescue
SBF binding, we performed a Swi4-V5 ChIP in strains with these HO promoter
mutations and probed SBF binding at both URS2L and URS2R (Fig 2).
As expected, SBF enrichment at URS2L is over 2-fold higher than at URS2R in WT
cells, despite similar numbers of SBF sites (Fig 2). Preferential enrichment to URS2L has
been observed previously (Takahata et al. 2011; Yarrington et al. 2015) and is due to
closer proximity to remodeling events initiated at the upstream URS1 region.
Interestingly, a sin4Δ mutation results in ~3-fold increase in SBF binding compared to
WT, at both URS2L and URS2R, and this elevated SBF binding likely explains the
similar increase in HO expression of this mutant. In the +700 and 5X-sbf HO promoter
mutants, disruption of SIN4 resulted in similar increases in SBF binding to URS2R to
levels around two-thirds that of WT and approximately 4-fold higher than that of the
single mutants without sin4Δ (Fig 2). In cell cycle synchrony experiments, we also see
prolonged SBF binding to HO in the sin4Δ mutant, compared to wild type (Supplemental
Fig S1). These results support the model that sin4Δ or separation of the Mediator Tail
subcomplex enhances SBF binding to URS2 even when combined with mutations that
normally block SBF binding.
sin4Δ-mediated suppression of HO is dependent on Swi5 and Gal11
We have shown that separation of the Mediator Tail subcomplex enhances SBF
binding to URS2 and suppresses defects in HO expression in certain promoter mutants,
but the mechanism behind this suppression remains largely unknown. To investigate this
mechanism further, we combined sin4Δ with other mutations known to affect HO
expression.

We first focused on the approximately 2 to 3-fold increase in both HO expression and
SBF binding observed in sin4Δ relative to WT. Similar increases occur when the gene for
the daughter-specific inhibitor Ash1 factor is disrupted (Takahata et al. 2011; Stillman
2013). Combining sin4Δ with an ASH1 disruption, however, revealed that these two
mutations are additive for HO expression (Supplemental Fig S2) and are therefore not
working together in the same pathway.
We next investigated the Swi5 transcription factor that recruits Mediator to URS1 to
initiate HO activation (Bhoite et al. 2001). Combining sin4Δ with a SWI5 disruption
blocked promoter activation similarly to that of swi5Δ alone, and swi5Δ sin4Δ failed to
activate expression from the 5X-sbf HO promoter mutant with five SBF site mutations
(Fig 3A). This result indicates that sin4Δ-mediatied suppression does not bypass normal
activation of the HO promoter. We further probed the relationship between sin4Δ and
Swi5 by examining Swi5-V5 enrichment levels during logarithmic growth by ChIP at its
two binding sites in URS1, site A and B (Tebb et al. 1993). Comparing Swi5-V5
enrichment in WT and sin4Δ revealed an ~50% increase in Swi5 binding at both sites
when SIN4 is disrupted (Fig 3B). Swi5 binding normally peaks 20 minutes after release
from a G2/M arrest and quickly dissipates as the cell cycle progresses (Takahata et al.,
2009). To determine whether the increase in Swi5-V5 enrichment in sin4Δ was due to
greater peak binding at 20 minutes after release or to a change in binding kinetics, we
synchronized cells using GALp:CDC20 arrest and examined Swi5-V5 binding after
release. Total Swi5 binding at 20 minutes post release was largely similar between WT
and sin4Δ with the major difference being significant persistence of the Swi5 factor at
URS1 in the sin4 mutant (Fig 3C).
It has also been shown previously that Swi5 directly interacts with the Gal11 subunit
of the Tail subcomplex, and that Mediator fails to bind when GAL11 is disrupted (Bhoite
et al. 2001). Disruption of SIN4, however, separates the Tail subcomplex from the rest of
Mediator and it remains capable of binding independently of the rest of Mediator (Zhang

et al. 2004; Ansari and Morse 2012). We performed a ChIP experiment to determine
whether Tail and Core Mediator binding are also independent at HO. Srb4(Med17) is a
subunit of the Head module of Mediator, and we have previously shown that Srb4 binds
to both URS1 and URS2 of HO (Bhoite et al. 2001). Here we show that Srb4-V5 binding
to HO is eliminated by a sin4Δ mutation (Supplemental Fig S3), consistent with
separation of the Tail module from the rest of Mediator in a sin4Δ mutant. To determine
whether the Tail subcomplex was required for sin4Δ-mediated suppression, we next
examined HO expression when SIN4 and GAL11 were disrupted either independently or
together. The double mutant did not have elevated HO expression in the WT promoter
and failed to rescue expression of the 5x-sbf site mutant HO promoter, indicating that
sin4Δ-mediated suppression is dependent on functional Gal11 (Fig 3D). Furthermore,
disruptions of other Tail subunits, PGD1 and MED2, also blocked sin4Δ-mediated
suppression (Supplemental Fig S4). These results suggest that it is the independent
recruitment of the Tail subcomplex, rather than the loss of core Mediator or its associated
Kinase module, that is responsible for the observed suppression.
sin4Δ-mediated suppression is not dependent on the Mediator CDK module
The current model for Mediator-mediated promoter regulation proposes that the
Kinase module antagonizes the function of the Tail module (Van De Peppel et al. 2005;
Jeronimo and Robert 2017). Disruption of SIN4 leads to independent recruitment of the
Tail subcomplex and loss of the Kinase/CDK8 module (Jeronimo et al. 2016; Petrenko et
al. 2016), and our data is consistent with hyperactivation due to the loss of an inhibitor of
promoter activation. Furthermore, the Srb10 catalytic subunit of the Kinase module has
been shown to target Swi5 for degradation (Kishi et al. 2008), and failure to recruit the
Kinase module might cause Swi5 protein levels to persist in a way congruent with our
findings. This model, however, is not consistent with the requirement of a functional Tail
subcomplex for suppression. To better understand the role of the Kinase module in
sin4Δ-mediated hyperactivation of the HO promoter and suppression of promoter

mutants, we examined HO expression when SIN4 and SRB10 were disrupted either
independently or together. As expected, disruption of SIN4 resulted in elevated
expression of the native promoter and suppression of 5X-sbf promoter to WT levels (Fig
4). Loss of Srb10, however, failed to show an appreciable effect on either the native or
the mutant promoter, and sin4Δ srb10Δ double mutants produced expression results only
modestly different from those of sin4Δ single mutants (Fig 4). These results indicate that
loss of Kinase module activity has a minimal impact on HO expression. Additionally,
these results further support the interpretation that sin4Δ-mediated hyperactivation of the
HO promoter is due to independent recruitment of the Tail subcomplex rather than loss of
the Kinase module associated with Mediator.
Disruption of SIN4 results in elevated coactivator enrichment at the HO promoter
Swi5 recruits the SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Mediator coactivator complexes to URS1,
and SBF recruits these same complexes to URS2 (Takahata et al. 2009). Disruption of
SIN4 causes increased enrichment of both of these DNA-binding factors and may
similarly affect their ability to recruit coactivators to the HO promoter. Elevated and/or
persistent recruitment of coactivators to the HO promoter could explain the
hyperactivation observed with disrupting SIN4. To examine this possibility, we
performed ChIP to measure recruitment of Swi2-V5 of the SWI/SNF complex, Gcn5-V5
of the SAGA complex, and Gal11-V5 of the Mediator complex. As Gal11 is part of the
Mediator Tail module, in the sin4Δ mutant we were only examining recruitment of the
Tail subcomplex.
We first examined binding of the coactivator complexes to HO URS1 during
logarithmic growth and found that disrupting SIN4 caused coactivator enrichment to
increase for all three complexes, ranging from 1.6 to 2-fold enhanced enrichment (Fig
5A). A functional Tail module was required for the hyperactivation and suppression by
sin4Δ (Fig 3D), and we next investigated whether this Tail-dependence held true for
coactivator complex recruitment. To test this possibility, we examined Swi2-V5 binding

when SIN4 and GAL11 were disrupted either independently or together. Coactivator
binding is interdependent (Takahata et al. 2011), and we observed an expected small
decrease in Swi2-V5 enrichment in the gal11Δ single mutant. In the gal11Δ sin4Δ double
mutant, however, we saw complete loss of the near 4-fold enrichment observed with the
sin4Δ single mutant (Fig 5B). These results suggest that independent recruitment of the
Tail subcomplex is necessary and sufficient to increase recruitment of SWI/SNF to the
HO promoter.
Additionally, the Swi5 factor persists at the HO promoter in a SIN4 disruption (Fig
3C), and this persistence may affect the binding kinetics of recruited coactivators. To
examine this possibility, we synchronized cells using GALp:CDC20 arrest and release,
and performed ChIP on the V5-tagged coactivator subunits. For all three coactivator
complexes, we observed greater and prolonged enrichment to URS1 (Fig 5C).
Interestingly, coactivator enrichment at URS1 continues well past Swi5 binding at URS1
(compare Fig 3C and 5C). We also found enhanced and persistent coactivator enrichment
at URS2, and this recruitment appears to be in good agreement with altered SBF binding
in sin4Δ (Supplemental Fig S1).
Disruption of SIN4 enhances nucleosome eviction at the HO promoter
HO experiences waves of nucleosome eviction along the length of its promoter during
normal activation (Takahata et al. 2009). These waves of nucleosome eviction, however,
are dependent on transient recruitment of transcription factors and coactivators whose
binding kinetics are altered in a SIN4 disruption. To determine whether sin4Δ affects
nucleosome eviction at HO, we performed a H3 histone ChIP, examining H3 occupancy
every 100 to 200 bp between URS1 and URS2R, after GALp:CDC20 arrest and release.
Nucleosome eviction at URS1 was nearly identical between WT and sin4Δ for the
first 20 minutes after release (Fig 6A). In agreement with altered coactivator recruitment
(Fig 5C), however, nucleosome eviction appeared to continue beyond 20 minutes in
sin4Δ leading to greater and more persistent eviction of nucleosomes. Typically,

nucleosome occupancy at URS1 is mostly repopulated after 60 minutes post release
(Takahata et al. 2009) but repopulation in sin4Δ was significantly delayed (Fig 6B,
compare Wild Type and sin4Δ -1208 and -1109). Nucleosome eviction at URS2 was also
affected, with much greater nucleosome depletion observed after 30 minutes post release
in sin4Δ (Fig 6A and B). For example, the H3 occupancy data clearly shows that at 50
min the sin4 mutant has marked delay in nucleosome repopulation along the HO
promoter (Fig 6C). These results indicate that independent recruitment of the Tail
subcomplex leads to enhanced nucleosome eviction at the HO promoter, presumably due
to increased and persistent recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex.
Disruption of SIN4 alters coactivator interdependence and increases the probability
of HO promoter activation
Mutations in the catalytic subunits of SWI/SNF and SAGA greatly reduce HO
expression and recruitment of other coactivators (Cosma et al. 1999; Mitra et al. 2006;
Takahata et al. 2011). As sin4Δ leads to HO hyperactivation and enhanced coactivator
binding, we next wanted to investigate whether disrupting SIN4 could also rescue swi2
and gcn5 coactivator mutants. To test this possibility, we examined Swi2-V5 and Gcn5V5 binding when SIN4 and either GCN5 or SWI2 were mutated, respectively.
As expected, disrupting GCN5 alone resulted in a small decrease in Swi2-V5 at
URS1, while disrupting SIN4 alone resulted in a 3-fold increase in Swi2-V5 binding (Fig
7A). Disrupting SIN4 and GCN5 together yielded an ~3-fold increase in Swi2-V5
enrichment similar to that of the sin4 single mutant. This result suggests that SWI/SNF
binding at the HO promoter is no longer dependent on functional SAGA when SIN4 is
also disrupted. As a control, Swi2-V5 binding was similarly measured when GAL11 was
disrupted instead of GCN5 and binding was found to be Tail-dependent (Fig 7A). We
next examined Gcn5-V5 binding in a swi2-314 (E843K) mutant that encodes a partially
functional Swi2 protein (Mitra et al. 2006). Mutating swi2 resulted in a large decrease in
Gcn5-V5 enrichment, while disrupting SIN4 resulted in a 50% increase in Gcn5-V5

binding over WT (Fig 7B). Combining swi2-314 with sin4Δ rescued Gcn5-V5 binding to
levels 20% higher than WT and nearly 2-fold higher than that found in the swi2-314
strain alone. Taken together, these results indicate that recruitment of SWI/SNF and
SAGA to the HO promoter are not required for each other when the Tail subcomplex is
separated from the rest of Mediator.
The defect in HO activation observed in gcn5 and swi2-314 cells could be due to WT
or near-WT levels of activity from a subset of cells or to low levels of promoter activity
from a larger fraction of cells. Examining these two options and how sin4Δ suppresses
these mutants at the single cell level could provide additional information on the
mechanism of its suppression. To address these possibilities, we combined gcn5 and
swi2-314 mutations with an HO-GFP reporter and analyzed expression using single cell
time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (Zhang et al., 2013). Single cell analysis revealed a
significant reduction in the number of mother cells expressing at HO-GFP WT levels in
both the swi2 and gcn5 single mutants, and this fraction increased significantly when a
sin4 mutation was introduced (Fig 7C). Disrupting SIN4 did not result in cells expressing
HO at levels surpassing WT, but rather increased the percentage of cells expressing HO.
Independent recruitment of the Tail subcomplex therefore increases the probability of
promoter activation within a population of cells. HO is normally expressed only in
mother cells, and not in daughters (Jensen et al. 1983; Nasmyth 1983). Interestingly, the
sin4Δ gcn5Δ double mutant displayed expression in a significant fraction of daughter
cells, a property not found in either of the single mutants. Mechanistically, it is not at all
clear why HO is expressed in the sin4Δ gcn5Δ double mutant, and this bears further
investigation.
Disruption of SIN4 enables SWI/SNF binding under arrest conditions
A possible explanation for the loss of coactivator interdependence in sin4Δ is that the
entire Mediator complex has both positive and negative roles in the binding of other
coactivators. A similar argument has been proposed for SAGA, which is capable of

stimulating SWI/SNF binding to chromatin via histone acetylation, but also facilitating
SWI/SNF dissociation by direct Snf2 acetylation (Kim et al. 2010). By this model, the
inhibitory roles of Mediator are limited to the core Mediator and the Kinase module, and
are therefore absent when an independent Tail module alone is recruited to the promoter,
thereby creating a permissive environment for other coactivators to bind. Elevated and
persistent coactivator binding observed in sin4Δ (Fig 5C) supports this model.
To further explore this proposed model of inhibition by the complete Mediator
complex, we next examined HO under arrest conditions in which only SBF and Mediator
are bound to the promoter (Zhang et al. 2013b; Yu et al. 2016). If our model is correct,
the lack of SWI/SNF binding under arrest conditions is at least partly due to inhibitory
pressure from the kinase module and core Mediator complex that would be absent in
sin4Δ. To test this theory, we examined Swi2 enrichment by Swi2-V5 ChIP under αfactor arrest in WT and sin4Δ cells. Since α-factor arrest induces expression of a lncRNA
that disrupts factor binding (Yu et al. 2016), the cells used in this experiment have an HO
promoter mutation at the Ste12 binding site required for inducing this lncRNA.
Interestingly, while WT cells had Swi2-V5 levels comparable to no tag controls, sin4Δ
had elevated Swi2-V5 binding to URS2L with 2.5-fold enrichment over background (Fig
8A). Although it is possible that this persistent Swi2 binding is due to the 3 to 4-fold
greater binding that was observed during logarithmic growth, we saw nearly identical
levels of Gal11 binding in WT and sin4Δ cells when we probed similarly for Gal11-V5
instead of Swi2-V5 (Fig 8B). These results support a model in which Mediator can both
positively and negatively regulate SWI/SNF binding to promoters, and, furthermore, that
these two regulatory effects can be separated from one another by independent
recruitment of only the Tail module to promoters.

DISCUSSION

Mediator consists of four conserved modules (Head, Middle, Kinase and Tail), and
previous work has implicated the Kinase module as the primary antagonist to Tail
binding at the UAS elements of genes (Van De Peppel et al. 2005; Jeronimo and Robert
2017). In this study, we probed the antagonist model at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO
gene by utilizing a SIN4 disruption that separates the Tail module from the Kinase
module and core Mediator. In sin4Δ mutant cells we observed a significant increase in
Tail module recruitment, elevated SWI/SNF and SAGA coactivator binding, persistent
nucleosome eviction, and hyperactivation of the HO gene. These results are consistent
with the Kinase module as the primary Tail antagonist, as the Kinase module would not
be present at the UAS in the sin4Δ mutant to limit Tail module recruitment to the HO
promoter. However, mutation of the catalytic subunit of the Kinase module failed to
reproduce the hyperactivation of HO observed here with independent Tail recruitment.
These results suggest that the activity and binding of the Tail is limited by other factors.
One intriguing possibility is the core Mediator, which is also not present at the UAS
during independent Tail module recruitment in the sin4Δ mutant, and thus core Mediator
might function to limit Tail binding.
Our results suggest that the core Mediator may also limit the binding of the SWI/SNF
and SAGA coactivators. At the HO promoter, coactivator binding is typically
interdependent (Takahata et al. 2011), and impairment or loss of any one coactivator
leads to diminished recruitment of the other coactivators and failure to express HO at
significant levels. When the Tail module was recruited independently of the rest of
Mediator, we observed greater than WT levels of SWI/SNF and SAGA coactivators, even
when the other coactivator or its activity was disrupted. Additionally, when core
Mediator was absent, we were able to observe considerable enrichment of SWI/SNF at
HO URS2 even under α-factor arrest conditions in which coactivators are typically
evicted by transcribing RNA polymerase (Yu et al. 2016). These results suggest that
Mediator has both positive and negative roles in the recruitment of other coactivators,

similar to those of SWI/SNF in the recruitment of the SAGA complex (Kim et al. 2010).
We propose that core Mediator limits the ability of other coactivators to bind while the
Tail module facilitates their binding.
An alternative explanation for the increased coactivator recruitment in sin4Δ is that
the Tail subcomplex stimulates the recruitment of other coactivators, while core
Mediator, along with the Kinase module, simply limits Tail occupancy at promoters.
When SIN4 was disrupted, we saw an ~50% increase in the enrichment of the Gal11 Tail
subunit to HO. As coactivator binding is typically interdependent, this increase in Tail
occupancy could be responsible for stimulating elevated recruitment of the SWI/SNF and
SAGA coactivator complexes and rescuing recruitment of either of these coactivators
when the other is impaired or disrupted. In this model, core Mediator would regulate
coactivator binding by limiting the availability of the Tail module to the UAS or
enhancers of genes.
Why would Mediator limit its own recruitment and the binding of other coactivators?
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is very compact with inter-ORF distances ranging
from 150 to 400 bp (Pelechano et al. 2006). The increased coactivator recruitment and
nucleosome eviction that we observe at HO when the Tail module is recruited
independently has profound effects on HO transcriptional regulation, and it is possible
that these effects are occurring genome wide. Although microarray analysis of sin4Δ does
not reveal drastic changes in global transcript levels (Van De Peppel et al. 2005), changes
in global chromatin structure and hypersensitivity to micrococcal nuclease have been
reported (Macatee et al. 1997). We have shown previously that nucleosomes act as gates
to regulate both activation and timing of expression (Yarrington et al. 2016), and
coactivator recruitment and nucleosome eviction must be precise to limit promoter
activation and ensure proper regulation of gene transcription.
Disruption of SIN4 has been previously implicated in the long-range activation of
genes (Dobi and Winston 2007). In this report, the authors identified sin4Δ as capable of

enabling transcriptional activation at normally non-permissive distances of 800 bp or
greater in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, this effect was specific to sin4Δ as the authors were
unable to reproduce long-range activation with other Mediator mutations affecting all
four modules. These results are therefore consistent with the effect being due to an
independent Tail subcomplex. Although the authors were unable to provide a mechanism
for this altered activation by sin4Δ, based on our results with HO, it is likely that the
observed long-range activation is due to independent Tail recruitment with associated
elevated and persistent transcription factor and coactivator binding.
Lastly, it is important to note that we find no evidence that disrupting SIN4 has
altered the function of Mediator, only the recruitment of its four modules. Binding of the
Tail subcomplex to HO still requires both the Gal11 Tail subunit and the Swi5
transcription factor, and HO expression requires SBF bound to URS2R. Furthermore,
single cell analysis demonstrates that independent recruitment of the Tail subcomplex has
not altered the mechanism of HO activation but rather the probability of activation. These
results are consistent with whole Mediator working in concert with and regulating the
recruitment of other coactivators for proper gene regulation.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig 1. A sin4 mutation rescues expression of HO promoter mutants.
A. The diagram shows the structure of the HO promoter, including the two Swi5 binding
sites at URS1 and the nine SBF binding sites in URS2.
B. HO mRNA levels were measured for the various mutant HO promoters indicated on
the left, in either wild type, sin4, swi6, or swi6 sin4 mutants. The error bars reflect the
standard deviation of three biological samples. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
C. HO mRNA levels were measured for the various mutant HO promoters indicated on
the left, in either wild type or sin4 mutants. The error bars reflect the standard deviation
of three biological samples. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

Fig 2. A sin4 mutation rescues SBF binding in HO promoter mutations.
SBF binding was measured by ChIP assays of the Swi4-V5 subunit of SBF to the various
mutant HO promoters indicated on the left, in either wild type or sin4 mutants. SBF
binding was measured to the left (blue) or the right (red) parts of URS2, using the primers
indicated on the diagram. The first column on the right displays enrichment values
relative to the native URS2L part of the promoter, and the second column on the right
displays enrichment values relative to the native URS2R part of the promoter. The error
bars reflect the standard deviation of three biological samples. **p < 0.01.

Fig 3. The sin4 suppression of HO expression is dependent on Swi5 and Gal11.
A. The sin4 suppression of HO expression is dependent on Swi5. HO mRNA levels were
measured for the wild type HO promoter (left four columns) or the 5X-sbf HO promoter
mutant (right four columns), in either wild type, sin4, swi5, or sin4 swi5 strains. The error
bars reflect the standard deviation of two biological samples.

B. Swi5-V5 binding by ChIP is higher in sin4 mutants in log phase cells at both Site A (1819) and Site B (-1308); see diagram in Fig 1A. The error bars reflect the standard
deviation of three biological samples.
C. Swi5-V5 binding by ChIP at Site B is higher in sin4 mutants in cells synchronized
with a GALp:CDC20 arrest and release. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of
PCR replicates.
D. The sin4 suppression of HO expression is dependent on Gal11. HO mRNA levels
were measured for the wild type HO promoter (left four columns) or the 5X-sbf HO
promoter mutant (right four columns), in either wild type, sin4, gal11, or sin4 gal11
strains. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of two biological samples.

Fig 4. Loss of the Kinase module with an srb10 mutation does not affect HO
expression.
HO mRNA levels were measured for the wild type HO promoter (left four columns) or
the 5X-sbf HO promoter mutant (right four columns), in either wild type, sin4, srb10, or
sin4 srb10 strains. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of four biological
samples. **p < 0.01.

Fig 5. A sin4 mutation increases coactivator binding to the HO promoter.
A. The sin4 mutation increases Swi2-V5, Gcn5-V5, and Gal11-V5 binding to the HO
promoter as measured by ChIP. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of three
biological samples. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
B. The increase in SWI/SNF binding measured by ChIP assays with Swi2-V5 are
dependent upon Gal11. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of three biological
samples. **p < 0.01.
C. The increased coactivator binding in a sin4 mutant persists during the cell cycle. Wild

Swi2-V5, or a Gcn5-V5 epitope tag were synchronized by galactose withdrawal and readdition, and factor binding was measured by ChIP during the cell cycle. The ChIP signal
is plotted as a function of time after release from the G2/M arrest. The left and right
panels show binding at URS1 and URS2, respectively, with the positions of the PCR
primers shown by green arrows. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of PCR
replicates.

Fig 6. A sin4 mutation prolongs nucleosome eviction at the HO promoter
Wild type (left) and sin4 (right) cells with a GALp:CDC20 arrest allele were
synchronized by galactose withdrawal and re-addition, and H3 occupancy at the HO
promoter was measured by ChIP during the cell cycle using primers spaced along the HO
promoter. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of PCR replicates.
A. The H3 ChIP is plotted as a function of time after release from the G2/M arrest, with
the centers of the PCR intervals amplified listed on the right. The positions of the PCR
amplicons are shown on the promoter map below.
B. The data from panel A is plotted as a function of the distance along the promoter, with
the time points listed on the right.
C. The 50 min time points for wild type and sin4 are plotted as a function of the distance
along the promoter.

Fig 7. A sin4 mutation suppresses defects at HO caused by coactivator mutations.
A. A sin4 mutation enhances SWI/SNF binding to HO despite a gcn5 mutation.
SWI/SNF binding to HO was measured by ChIP assays with Swi2-V5 in wild type, sin4,
gcn5, sin4 gcn5, gal11, and sin4 gal11 strains. The error bars reflect the standard
deviation of three biological samples. **p < 0.01.

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.
C. A sin4 mutation enhances HO expression despite coactivator mutations. Expression of
an HO-GFP reporter was measured by single cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, in
both mother and daughter cells. The table lists the number of cells counted, the
percentage of cells in which HO-GFP was expressed, and the relative level of expression.
Expression levels were normalized so that the average expression level in wild type
mother cells is 1. The data for the wild type and gcn5 mutants are from (Zhang et al.
2013b).

Fig8. A sin4 mutation facilitates SWI/SNF binding at HO during G1 arrest.
A. SWI/SNF is normally not present at HO URS2 during a G1 arrest (Zhang et al.
2013b). A ChIP experiment shows that a sin4 mutation allows Swi2-FLAG to bind to HO
URS2 during a G1 arrest. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of two biological
samples. *p < 0.05.
B. A ChIP experiment shows that a sin4 mutation does not result in an increase in Gal11V5 binding to HO URS2 during a G1 arrest. The error bars reflect the standard deviation
of two biological samples.

Supplemental Fig S1. The increased SBF binding in a sin4 mutant persists during
the cell cycle.
Wild type (solid lines) and sin4 (dotted lines) cells with a GALp:CDC20 allele and a
Swi4-V5 epitope tag were synchronized by galactose withdrawal and re-addition, and
factor binding was measured by ChIP during the cell cycle. The ChIP signal is plotted as
a function of time after release from the G2/M arrest. SBF binding was measured to the
left (blue) or the right (red) parts of URS2, using the primers indicated on the diagram.

Supplemental Fig S2. sin4 and ash1 mutations additively increase HO expression.
HO mRNA levels were measured for the various mutant HO promoters indicated on the
left, in either wild type or sin4 mutants. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of
two biological samples.

Supplemental Fig S3. The Srb4 subunit of the Head module of Mediator is not
recruited to HO in a sin4 mutant.
Srb4-V5 binding to HO URS1 and URS2 was measured by ChIP in wild type and a sin4
mutant. The error bars reflect the standard deviation of three biological samples. *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01.
