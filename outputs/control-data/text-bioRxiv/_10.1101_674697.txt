Abstract
Serotonin neurons of the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei (DR and MR) collectively innervate the entire
forebrain and midbrain, modulating diverse physiology and behavior. To gain a fundamental
understanding of their molecular heterogeneity, we used plate-based single-cell RNA-sequencing to
generate a comprehensive dataset comprising eleven transcriptomically distinct serotonin neuron
clusters. Systematic in situ hybridization mapped specific clusters to the principal DR, caudal DR, or
MR. These transcriptomic clusters differentially express a rich repertoire of neuropeptides, receptors,
ion channels, and transcription factors. We generated novel intersectional viral-genetic tools to access
specific subpopulations. Whole-brain axonal projection mapping revealed that DR serotonin neurons
co-expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-3 preferentially innervate the cortex, whereas those coexpressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone innervate subcortical regions in particular the hypothalamus.
Reconstruction of 50 individual DR serotonin neurons revealed segregated axonal projection patterns
at the single-cell level. Together, these results provide a molecular foundation of the heterogenous
serotonin neuronal phenotypes.

Serotonin is a phylogenetically ancient signaling molecule (Hay-Schmidt, 2000) and the most widely
distributed neuromodulator in the brain (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, 1964; Steinbusch, 1981). The serotonin
system innervates nearly every region of the brain (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992), even though it only
constitutes ~ 1/200000 of all CNS neurons in humans. It is critically involved in a broad range of brain
functions and is the most frequently targeted neural system pharmacologically for treating psychiatric
disorders (Belmaker and Agam, 2008; Ravindran and Stein, 2010).

Serotonin neurons in the central nervous system are spatially clustered in the brainstem,
originally designated as groups B1–B9 (Dahlstrom and Fuxe, 1964). Groups B1–B3 are located in the
medulla and provide descending serotonergic innervation to the spinal cord and other parts of the
medulla. The rest of the groups are located in the pons and midbrain, including the dorsal raphe (DR;

groups B6 and B7) and median raphe (MR; groups B5 and B8) nucleus, and provide ascending
innervation to the forebrain and midbrain. The DR and MR serotonin systems have been linked with
the regulation of many mental states and processes, including anxiety, mood, impulsivity, aggression,
learning, reward, social interaction, and hence remain the focus of intense research.

Evidence has suggested that the DR and MR serotonin systems differ in developmental origin,
connectivity, physiology, and behavioral function (Calizo et al., 2011; Okaty et al., 2019). DR
serotonin neurons derive entirely from rhombomere 1 of the developing mouse brain, whereas MR
serotonin neurons derive predominantly from rhombomeres 1, 2, and 3 (Bang et al., 2012; Jensen et
al., 2008). Although the DR and MR receive similar inputs globally from specific brain regions
(Ogawa et al., 2014; Pollak Dorocic et al., 2014; Weissbourd et al., 2014), they project to largely
complementary forebrain targets. The MR serotonin neurons project to structures near the midline,
whereas the DR serotonin neurons target more lateral regions (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992). Slice
physiology recording showed that the serotonin neurons in the MR and DR have
different electrophysiological characteristics, such as resting potential, resistance, and reaction to
serotonin receptor-1A agonist (Calizo et al., 2011). Finally, activation of these two raphe nuclei has
been suggested to mediate opposing roles in emotional regulation (Teissier et al., 2015).

Even within the MR or DR, there is considerable heterogeneity of serotonin neurons in multiple
aspects. Although MR serotonin neurons arising from different cell lineages are anatomically mixed
in the adult, they have distinct electrophysiological properties (Okaty et al., 2015) and potentially
distinct behavioral functions (Kim et al., 2009; Okaty et al., 2015). Diversity of serotonin neurons in
the DR has received particular attention in recent years. Accumulating evidence indicates that there
are subgroup-specific projection patterns within the DR serotonin system (Niederkofler et al., 2016;
Ren et al., 2018). The electrophysiological properties of DR serotonin neurons vary according to the
projection patterns (Fernandez et al., 2016). Physiological recordings as well as optogenetic and
chemogenetic manipulations suggest heterogeneity of DR serotonin neurons in their behavioral
functions (Cohen et al., 2015; Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016; Niederkofler et al., 2016). As a specific
example, we recently found that DR serotonin neurons that project to frontal cortex and amygdala
constitute two sub-systems with distinct cell body locations, axonal collateralization patterns, biased
inputs, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions (Ren et al., 2018). Our
collateralization analyses also imply that there must be additional parallel sub-systems of DR serotonin
neurons that project to brain regions not visited by the frontal cortex- and amygdala-projecting subsystems.

Ultimately, the heterogeneity of DR and MR serotonin neurons must be reflected at the
molecular level. Pioneering work has introduced the molecular diversity of serotonin neurons across
the midbrain and hindbrain (Okaty et al., 2015; Spaethling et al., 2014; Wylie et al., 2010), yet
systematic analysis and integration of multiple cellular characteristics at the single-cell resolution
within each raphe nucleus is still lacking. The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) technology in recent years has provided a powerful tool for unbiased identification of
transcriptomic cell types in the brain (Darmanis et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017a; Mickelsen et al., 2019;
Rosenberg et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016; Tasic et al., 2018; Welch et al., 2019;
Zeisel et al., 2018; Zeisel et al., 2015). In neural circuits where cell types have been well studied by
anatomical and physiological methods, there is an excellent correspondence between cell types defined
by transcriptomes and the classical methods (Li et al., 2017a; Shekhar et al., 2016). Here, we combine
scRNA-seq, fluorescence in situ hybridization, intersectional labeling of genetic defined cell types,
whole-brain axonal projection mapping, and single neuron reconstruction to investigate the
relationship between molecular architecture of serotonin neurons, the spatial location of their cell
bodies in the DR and MR, and their axonal arborization patterns in the brain.

We performed a comprehensive survey of DR and MR serotonin neurons in the adult mouse brain by
scRNA-seq (Figure 1A). To specifically label serotonin neurons, we crossed Sert-Cre mice (Gong et
al., 2007) with the tdTomato Cre reporter mouse, Ai14 (Madisen et al., 2010). (Serotonin transporter,
or Sert, is a marker for serotonin neurons; see more details below.) We collected serotonin neurons
acutely dissociated from brain slices by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and used Smartseq2 (Picelli et al., 2013) to generate scRNA-seq libraries. We used both male and female adult mice
(postnatal day 40–45) and applied two dissection strategies to separate the serotonin neurons
originating from anatomically-distinct brain regions: 1) in the first set of experiments, we dissected
the brainstem region that contain the entire MR and DR; 2) in the second set of experiments, we
focused on the principal DR (pDR, corresponding to the traditional B7 group) region by dissecting
specifically the DR but excluding its caudal extension (cDR, corresponding to the traditional group
B6) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). After quality control (Materials and methods), we
determined the transcriptomes of 709 cells from eight samples that include MR, pDR, and cDR, and
290 cells from six pDR-only samples (999 cells in total). We sequenced to a depth of ∼1 million reads
per cell and detected ~10,000 genes per cell (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, Supplemental Table
1). The data quality and serotonin identity were validated by the fact that all 999 neurons expressed:
1) tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), a key enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis; 2) transcription factor
Pet1 (Fev) known to express in raphe serotonin neurons (Hendricks et al., 1999); 3) the plasma
membrane serotonin transporter (Sert), which recycles released serotonin back to presynaptic
terminals of serotonin neurons, and 4) vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2), which transports
serotonin (and other monoamines) from presynaptic cytoplasm to synaptic vesicles (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1C).

To define distinct serotonin neuron populations based on single-cell transcriptome, we
performed principal component analysis (PCA) on all the genes expressed in the assayed neurons,
followed by nearest-neighbor graph-based clustering. These 999 MR and DR serotonin neurons
comprised 11 clusters (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Materials and methods).
Each cluster contained cells from both sexes after removing genes located on the Y chromosome,
indicating that there were few sex-specific differences (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). No
substantial batch effect was observed (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Each of the 11 clusters
expressed a set of cluster-discriminatory genes, including markers for specific neurotransmitter
systems, such as Vglut3, Gad1, and Gad2 (Figure 1C,D; Figure 1—figures supplement 3–6).

Of the 11 transcriptomic clusters, six (Cluster 1–6) consisted of only serotonin neurons dissected from
the pDR. We hypothesized that these six clusters represent serotonin neurons from the pDR, and the
remaining five clusters represent cells from MR and cDR. To test this hypothesis and to obtain
information about the anatomical organization of transcriptomically defined serotonin cell clusters
within the DR and MR, we chose 16 cluster marker genes and performed hybridization-chain reaction
(HCR)-based single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (Choi et al., 2018). To
restrict our analysis within the serotonin neuron population, we simultaneously double-labeled Tph2,
a marker for serotonin neurons, for all the HCR-smFISH experiments.

derived from counting Tph2/cluster marker double-labeled cells from confocal sections of the HCRsmFISH experiments (Figure 2B and Figure 2—supplement figures 1–2). Specifically, we found that
the distribution of markers for Clusters 1–6, Ret, Trh, Gad1, Npas1, Syt2, and C1ql2 (Figure 1D),
were mostly restricted to the pDR. The two common Cluster 7 markers Tacr3 and Met were both
highly concentrated in serotonin neurons under the aqueduct in the cDR. Dlk1 should be expressed in
the DR clusters as well as Cluster 8 (Figure 1D), and its expression was found in both the DR and
MR, suggesting Custer 8 serotonin neurons are located in the MR. Clusters 9–11 markers Irx2 and
Piezo2 were mostly found in the MR. Thus, these observations support the anatomical breakdown
suggested by the dissection of primary tissue, and additionally provide a more granular and detailed
description about finer boundaries.

Within the DR, Trh+, Gad1+, and Gad2+ serotonin neurons were mainly located in the dorsal
DR, whereas Vglut3+ and Syt2+ serotonin neurons were mainly located in the ventral DR and cDR.
These data suggest that Clusters 1–3 correspond to the dorsal DR and Cluster 4–6 to the ventral DR.
Cluster 6 marker Npas1+ was largely excluded from the densest portion of Tph2 expression at the
midline and instead was found scattered in the more rostral and ventral portion of the lateral wings.
On the other hand, Crhr2, which should be expressed in all DR serotonin neuron clusters except
Cluster 1 and 6 (Figure 1D), was localized preferentially near the midline and was absent from the
lateral wing. Thus, Cluster 6 likely corresponds to serotonin neurons located preferentially in the
lateral wings. In contrast to DR, the anatomical organization of the molecular features that define MR
clusters is less obvious and different clusters appear more intermingled.

In summary, our HCR-smFISH experiments support the notion that Clusters 1–6 correspond
to pDR serotonin neurons, Cluster 7 corresponds to cDR serotonin neurons, and Clusters 8–11
correspond to MR serotonin neurons. We thus rename hereafter Clusters 1–6 as DR-1–6, Cluster 7 as
cDR, and Clusters 8–11 as MR-1–4 (Figure 3). Detailed expression levels of marker genes across all
11 clusters can be found in Figure 3—figure supplement 1–3.

Having determined the spatial locations of transcriptomically defined serotonin cell types, we next
analyzed key groups of differentially expressed genes crucial for neuronal function, including markers
for neurotransmitter systems, neuropeptides, ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein-coupled)
neurotransmitter receptors, wiring specificity molecules, and transcription factors (Figure 4; Figure
4—figure supplement 1).

Genes related to neurotransmitters other than serotonin. The majority of the clusters
express Slc17a8, which encodes vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (Vglut3). These include almost all
serotonin neurons from the cDR and the majority from MR clusters, and DR-3–6 clusters (Figure 1D).
These observations suggest that glutamate is the most prevalent co-transmitter for serotonin neurons.
Glutamate co-release from Vglut3+ serotonin terminals has indeed been reported at the orbital
prefrontal cortex (Ren et al., 2018), nucleus accumbens (Liu et al., 2014), ventral tegmental area
(Wang et al., 2019), and basolateral amygdala (Sengupta et al., 2017).

Three DR clusters express Gad1 and Gad2, which encode biosynthetic enzymes for the
neurotransmitter GABA. Two MR clusters express Gad2 but not Gad1, and cDR expresses neither.
Interestingly, few of the Gad1+ or Gad2+ neurons express vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat, Figure
4A left), which is responsible for transporting GABA into synaptic vesicles for synaptic transmission.
However, it has been reported that vesicular monoamine transporters (Slc8a1 for Vmat1; Slc8a2 for
Vmat2) can transport GABA into synaptic vesicles (Stensrud et al., 2014), and virtually all serotonin
neurons expressed Vmat2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, Figure 4A left). Nevertheless, it remains
to be determined if these serotonin neurons can actually release GABA. At the single cell level, 15%

of serotonin neurons do not express any of the gene markers for glutamate or GABA transmission. 50%
of serotonin neurons express Vglut3, 21% express either Gad1, Gad2, or both, and 13% express
markers for Vglut3 and Gad1 or Gad2 (Figure 4A left).

In addition to small-molecule transmitters, the majority of serotonin neurons also co-express
neuropeptides (Figure 4A right). Expression of several neuropeptides served as excellent cluster
markers. For example, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) is highly expressed in DR-1–3 (14%
serotonin neurons, Figure 1C). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) is highly expressed in the DR3
cluster but much less everywhere else (7% serotonin neurons). Neuropeptide B (Npb) is highly
expressed in cDR and MR4 but much less in pDR serotonin neurons. Many serotonin neurons express
multiple neuropeptides (Figure 4A,B).

Small-molecule neurotransmitter receptors. Each cluster has a distinct expression pattern
of neurotransmitter (including neuropeptide) receptors (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1).
Multiple subunits of glutamate and GABA receptors are differentially expressed across the clusters.
For example, Grin3a, encoding subunit 3A of ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor, is mainly
expressed in pDR but not MR or cDR clusters. By contrast, Grik1, encoding subunit 1 of the kainate
glutamate receptor, is more highly expressed in MR clusters. Chrna3 and Chrna4, encoding subunit
α3 and α4 of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, are also more enriched in MR clusters. Clusters MR4 and cDR have the highest expression level of expression for Chrm1 and Chrm2, encoding muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors. Finally, all serotonin neurons express at least one type of serotonin receptors,
with the Gi-coupled Htr1 subfamily in particular Htr1a being the most widely expressed. Htr1a is
highly expressed in the MR-4 cluster, which does not express other serotonin receptors. Of all the
genes encoding serotonin receptors, Htr5b has the strongest cluster specificity (Figure 4B).

Neuropeptide receptors: Multiple neuropeptide receptors have rich expression in distinct
clusters. Notably, cDR preferentially expresses at least five neuropeptide receptors: gastric inhibitory
polypeptide receptor (Gipr), tachykinin receptor 3 (Tacr3), relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (Rxfp1),
calcitonin receptor (Calcr), and opioid receptor mu-1 (Oprm1). Meanwhile, opioid receptor kappa 1
(Oprk1) is expressed specifically in MR-2. Another neuropeptide receptor enriched cluster is MR-3,
expressing Tacr3, cannabinoid receptor 1(Cnr1), somatostatin receptor-1 (Sstr1), prolactin-releasing
hormone (Prlhr), and neuromedin B receptor (Nmbr). Neuropeptide receptors like oxytocin receptor
(Oxtr), prokineticin receptor-1 and -2 (Prokr1, Prokr2), hypocretin receptor-2 (Hcrtr2), corticotropinreleasing hormone receptor-2 (Crhr2), cholecystokinin-A (Cckar), neuropeptide Y receptor Y2
(Npy2r), and parathyroid hormone-2 receptor (Pth2r) all have distinct expression pattern across
different clusters.

221
222
223

In summary, the DR and MR serotonin neurons have diverse expression pattern of
neuropeptide receptors, indicating that they are subject to complex modulation by a host of
neuropeptides.

Other notable genes: the DR and MR serotonin clusters are also distinguished by differential
expression of ion channels as well as axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules (Figure 4—figure
supplement 1), which can contribute to their differences in physiological properties and wiring
specificity. Notably, genes encoding a voltage-gated K+ channel (Kchn8) and mechanosensitive
channel (Piezo2) are highly expressed in the MR-4 cluster but exhibit little expression in all other
clusters. The chemokine ligand-12 (Cxcl12) and cadherin-6 (Cdh6) are preferentially expressed in
MR-1 and DR-4 clusters, respectively.

231
232
233

Transcription factors: Transcription factors (TFs) have been shown to be the best molecular
feature for cell type definition (Tabula Muris et al., 2018). Within our data, we observed robust clusterspecific expression of multiple TF genes (Figure 4B; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Importantly,

among the genes we identified are those previously reported to be involved in neuronal function. For
example, Nfix and Nfib (Bedford et al., 1998) are preferentially expressed in DR-3. Irx2 (Wylie et al.,
2010) is specific to MR-2 and MR-3. Sox13 is highly enriched in cDR. Zeb2 (Okaty et al., 2015) is
uniquely expressed in cDR and MR-4. TFs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
Npas1 and Npas3 (Erbel-Sieler et al., 2004), are preferentially expressed in DR-6, and Aff2 (Mondal
et al., 2012) is enriched within DR-3.

Transcriptional networks: To understand the relationship between cluster-specific genes and
to gain new insights on transcriptional regulatory programs orchestrating the maintenance of serotonin
neuron subtype identity, we next performed a pairwise correlation analysis of gene expression across
all 999 neurons (Supplemental File 1). We used Pearson correlation coefficient (rp) as a measure of
gene co-expression and focused on the genes with average expression > 10 counts per million. We
found multiple genes to co-expressed (defined as rp> 0.5) in serotonin neurons, forming co-expression
modules among each other as well as around various TFs (Supplemental File 1). Focusing further on
cluster markers, we identified three transcriptional “hubs” that putatively govern molecular programs
within respective neurons. Interestingly, two of these hubs were centered around pDR-specific TFs,
and, independently, comprised of dorsal (DR-1, DR-2, DR-3) and ventral (DR-4, DR-5, DR-6) pDR
markers (Figure 4C). Among dorsal pDR markers we identified Pax5 and Sox14 to strongly correlate
(rp>0.5) with Gad1, Gad2, and Trh, among other genes. Among ventral pDR markers, we found Crhr2
to be highly correlated with several TFs, receptors, and neurotransmitter-related genes, most notably
Vglut3 (Slc17a8) and Hcrtr2. These Crhr2+ serotonin neurons could use TFs Esr2 and Sox1 to
maintain their subtype identity. Npas3 is specifically expressed in the DR-6 cluster and is highly
correlated with Htr1d, suggesting a critical role of maintaining the characteristics of DR-6 serotonin
neurons. Similarly, we found several MR and cDR-specific TFs to be the hubs of co-expression
modules. Particularly, the expression of a large number of cell adhesion molecules, receptors, ion
channel proteins and neuropeptides strongly correlate with the expression of TFs Zeb2, Pou3f1, Irx2,
and Zfp536. Based on the identified correlation among gene expression of multiple marker genes
across all the cells, we speculate that the identified genes are linked by one or multiple transcriptional
regulatory programs, which, in turn, drive cell type-specific functions of distinct serotonin neuron
populations.

Sexually dimorphic gene expression: Finally, even though there were no apparent sexspecific difference at the cluster level Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), we did detect several genes,
such as Sod1, Snx10, Inpp4a, Zscan26, Ncam1, showing sexual dimorphism across the majority of cell
subtypes (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).

The gene expression patterns of specific serotonin neuron clusters can in principle allow genetic access
to these specific subpopulations for anatomical tracing, physiological recording, and functional
perturbation (Luo et al., 2018). However, DR and MR contain not only serotonin neurons but also
GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that do not express Tph2 (and hence do not release serotonin),
some of which may project to the same target regions (McDevitt et al., 2014). To precisely investigate
the function of transcriptome-based serotonin neuronal types, we need to use an intersectional strategy
to target serotonin neurons that express specific additional markers (Jensen et al., 2008). To this end,
we generated Sert-Flp mice through homologous recombination-based knock-in in embryonic stem
cells (Materials and methods), and used Sert-Flp mice to intersect with transgenic Cre mice that
allow expression of a fluorescent reporter only in Flp +/Cre+ (AND gate), so as to genetically label only
specific Cre-positive clusters (Figure 5A).

pDR showed that 98.5% GFP+ neurons are Tph2+ and 100% Tph2+ neurons are GFP+ (Figure 5B). To
further verify the intersectional strategy and to label the serotonin neurons co-expressing markers for
glutamate or GABA transmission, we crossed Sert-Flp with the IS reporter mice (Rosa-CAG-loxPstop-loxP-FRT-tdTomato-FRT-EGFP) (He et al., 2016) and either Vglut3-Cre or Gad2-Cre. AntiTph2 staining showed that all GFP-labeled neurons are Tph2+ (Figure 5C,D). In the pDR, Vglut3+
serotonin neurons were mainly located ventrally, whereas Gad2 + serotonin neurons were mainly
located dorsally, consistent with our previous study (Ren et al., 2018) and the HCR-smFISH results
(Figure 2).

To map the axonal projection pattern of serotonin subtypes defined by intersection of Flp and
Cre expression, we developed a new AAV vector (AAV-CreON/FlpON-mGFP) that expressed
membrane-targeted GFP under the dual gates of Flp and Cre (Figure 6A). Based on our scRNA-seq
and HCR-smFISH results, the Vglut3+ and Trh+ pDR serotonin neurons consist of largely
complementary cell types at the transcriptomic level and have a distinct distribution along the dorsal–
ventral axis in the pDR. To visualize these two subpopulations of serotonin neurons, we injected AAVCreON/FlpON-mGFP into pDR of either Vglut3-Cre;Sert-flp (n = 3, Figure 6B) or Trh-Cre;Sert-flp
mice (n = 3, Figure 6C). Anti-Tph2 staining showed that 98.2% GFP+ neurons were Tph2+. As
predicted, Vglut3+Sert+ GFP cells were mostly located in the ventral pDR (Figure 6B), whereas
Trh+Sert+ cells were located in the dorsal pDR (Figure 6C). As negative controls, we injected the
same virus into mice carrying only the Sert-flp transgene or only the Vglut3-Cre transgene and did not
find any mGFP+ cell bodies or fibers (n = 3 for each; data not shown).

The intersectional strategy allowed us to trace the projection of GFP + axons from these two
groups of serotonin neurons across the brain. We next examined their projections by staining every
four coronal sections across the brain with anti-GFP antibody. We found that serotonin axons from
Vglut3+ population preferentially targeted cortical regions (Figure 6D), consistent with our previous
results (Ren et al., 2018). By contrast, no GFP-labeled axons were observed in the cortical regions
from Trh-Cre:Sert-flp mice. Instead, Trh+ serotonin axons project to the anterior and medial
hypothalamus, posterior amygdala, and the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, none of which
were targeted by Vglut3+ axons (Figure 6D).

While suggestive of an anatomical division in targets, assessing the full extent to which projections of
Vglut3+ or Trh+ pDR serotonin neuron populations segregate requires quantifying axonal innervation
at the whole-brain level. We used the iDISCO-based brain clearing technique AdipoClear (Chi et al.,
2018) to visualize, align, and summarize whole-brain projectomes (Figure 7A). Individual
hemispheres of either Vglut3-Cre;Sert-flp (n = 3) or Trh-Cre;Sert-flp mice (n = 3) injected with AAVCreON/FlpON-mGFP at pDR were imaged by light-sheet microscopy. We developed deep learning
models to automatically trace whole-brain axonal projections by segmenting volumes with a 3D UNetbased convolutional neural network we developed (Materials and methods). The resulting
volumetric probability maps were thinned and thresholded before aligning to the Allen Institute’s 2017
common coordinate framework as previously described (Ren et al., 2018; Figure 7A).

We visualized the axon terminals in brain regions targeted by either the Trh+ or the Vglut3+
population of serotonin neurons. Initial assessment of selected target regions suggested a strong
segregation of axonal projection patterns between these two populations (Figure 7B,C), consistent
with data from tissue sections (Figure 6D). Axons from both populations followed similar initial
trajectories and were observed in shared structures along the length of the median forebrain bundle
(Figure 7C,D; Figure 7—figure supplement 1–3; Video 1). However, as was seen in tissue sections,
there were extensive differences in innervation patterns of terminal axon fields between the Vglut3+
and Trh+ populations. Whole-brain quantitative and statistical analyses showed Vglut3+ axons

preferentially in anterolateral cortical regions and adjacent structures such as olfactory bulb, agranular
insular cortex, endopiriform, piriform, and claustrum as well as other cortical regions such as
entorhinal, primary motor, and barrel cortices. By contrast, Trh+ axons were largely absent from these
structures. Conversely, subcortical regions primarily in thalamus (zona incerta and medial geniculate)
and hypothalamus (anterior and dorsomedial nuclei) were preferentially targeted by Trh+ axons and
largely avoided by the Vglut3+ population (Figure 7E; Video 1).

Given the variability of locations and amount of viral transduction, individual brains from the
same genotype exhibit considerable variation in total axons labeled (Figure 7E top) and in detailed
projection patterns (Figure 7—figure supplement 1–2). These variabilities further highlighted regions
that were targeted densely but exclusively in one or two individual brains Notable examples include
anterior bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), posterior amygdala, and globus pallidus external
segment (GPe) in Trh+ projections and the lateral central amygdala (CeA) and dentate nucleus of the
cerebellum for Vglut3+ projections. While we did identify large-scale patterns of collateralization for
these two subtypes of serotonin neurons, one possible contribution to this inter-individual variability
in projection patterns is heterogeneity within molecularly defined subpopulations of serotonin neurons.

Our whole-brain projection analyses indicate that axonal arborization patterns of molecularly defined
serotonin neuron subpopulations are still very complex (Figure 7). To examine the extent to which
this reflects projection patterns of individual serotonin neurons, we combined the cell-type-specific
sparse labeling strategy we recently developed (Lin et al., 2018) (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A)
and the fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) platform (Gong et al., 2016). We
fully reconstructed whole-brain arborization patterns of 50 DR serotonin neurons from 19 Sert-Cre
mice. All reconstructed neurons and their process were registered to the Allen Reference Atlas (Figure
8A) (Gilbert, 2018). The cell bodies of these 50 serotonin neurons covered large regions of the DR
(Figure 8—figure supplement 1B), and their projections collectively innervated the majority of the
brain regions (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C), suggesting their broad coverage of DR serotonin
neuron types. Complete morphological reconstruction revealed that the projection pattern of individual
DR serotonin neurons was highly diverse yet follow some general patterns (Figure 8—figure
supplement 1C). We categorized them into six groups based on their projection patterns. The groups
were named after the destination innervated by the highest proportion of their terminals (Figure 8B–
G; Figure 8—figure supplement 2–3; Video 2; Materials and methods). We highlight some of
features below.

Cortex-projecting. This group of DR serotonin neurons (n = 17) all dedicated more than 50%
their total axonal length to innervate cortical regions. In general, they had the most complex branching
pattern, with various combinations of target regions (Figure 8B, G; Figure 8—figure supplement
2A). This group could be further divided into four subgroups: olfactory area-projecting
(containing >50% of the axon length within in olfactory cortex, n = 7), prefrontal cortex-projecting
(>30% of the axon length, n = 4), entorhinal cortex-projecting (>30% of the axon length, n = 3), and
dorsal cortex-projecting (including motor, somatosensory, retrosplenial, and visual cortex; n = 3). In
the olfactory area-projecting subgroup, three brains had branches in the olfactory bulb (OB). Axons
of the three dorsal cortex-projecting neurons traveled the largest distance, entering the cortex
anteriorly and extending to the posterior end. Interestingly, seven cortex-projecting serotonin neurons
also sent substantial branches to non-cortical regions (>10% of axon length), including three that
innervated the cerebellum.

372

Hypothalamus-projecting. Each cell of this group (n = 11) dedicated more than 33% axon
length to innervate the hypothalamus (Figure 8B; Figure 8—figure supplement 2B). None of them

Amygdala-projecting. The axons of all amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons (n = 7;
Figure 8C; Figure 8—figure supplement 3A) followed either or both of the two distinct routes to
reach the amygdala (Figure 8—figure supplement 4A1, A2). Six cells had collateralized axonal
terminals in the hypothalamus (>10% axon length). One cell sent a branch to the contralateral cortex.
Two cells had branches that were almost equally distributed in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis
(BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and medial amygdala (MeA). Interestingly, the axon arbors at the
CeA or MeA were highly restricted and dense (Figure 8—figure supplement 4A3).

Other groups. The rest of the DR serotonin neurons were divided into thalamus-projecting,
striatum-projecting, and caudal brainstem-projecting groups based on the highest density of axons
(Figure 8—figure supplement 3B–D), even though most also innervated other regions including the
medulla and spinal cord (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C). While most projections of the DR
serotonin neurons were unilateral (37/50), one of the thalamus-projecting neurons had symmetrical
bilateral projections in the thalamic target (Figure 8—figure supplement 4B). For the two DR
serotonin neurons that innervated ventral striatum (also called nucleus accumbens, or NAc),
arborization appeared to be restricted to either the core or the shell (Figure 8—figure supplement 4C).

In summary, these results revealed remarkable complexity and heterogeneity of serotonin
neuron projections at the single-cell level. They nevertheless followed certain patterns. For example,
the cell body locations of these traced neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B) were consistent
with our previous results (Ren et al., 2018) as well as single-cell transcriptome, HCR-smFISH, and
whole-brain bulk tracing data. Specifically, cortex-projecting serotonin neurons were biased towards
ventral pDR (14 out of 17 cells), whereas amygdala-projecting ones were preferentially distributed in
the dorsal pDR (5 out of 7 cells).

Forebrain-projecting serotonin neurons have been estimated to have very long axons based on
the total serotonin fiber density and number of serotonin neurons (Wu et al., 2014). With single-cell
tracing, we could now directly quantify the total length of axons of the 50 DR serotonin neurons. We
found that the total axon length of these DR serotonin neurons exhibited considerable heterogeneity,
from 1.2 cm to 22.7 cm. When examined across the six groups, cortex-projecting serotonin neurons
indeed had the longest axons (Figure 8H). The longest serotonin neuron has 22.7 cm total axon length,
or >10 times the length of a mouse brain in the longest dimension from rostral olfactory bulb to caudal
brainstem.

Collectively, ~12000 serotonin neurons from the DR and MR in mice (~0.015% of all CNS neurons)
innervate the entire forebrain (Ishimura et al., 1988) and modulate diverse physiological and
behavioral functions. A fundamental question is how these serotonin neurons are organized to manage
such a broad range of modulation. Single-cell transcriptomics have emerged in recent years as a
powerful means to classify neuronal types, supplementing traditional criteria based on developmental
history, morphology, projection patterns, and physiological properties (Luo et al., 2018). Using highdepth single-cell RNAseq in combination with systematic fluorescence in situ hybridization, whole
brain projection mapping via intersectional methods and single-axon tracing, we begin to shed light
on the relationship between transcriptomic clusters, the spatial location of their cell bodies, and brainwide projection patterns of serotonin neurons.

Our single-cell transcriptome analysis identified 11 molecularly distinct types of serotonin neurons in
the DR and MR (Figure 1). Based on tissue source from which scRNA-seq data was collected and
fluorescent in situ hybridization using transcriptomic cluster markers, we were able to assign six types
to principal DR (pDR), one type to caudal DR (cDR), and four types to MR (Figure 3). The fact that
we can assign specific transcriptomic clusters to specific groups of raphe nuclei indicate that
molecularly defined serotonin populations are spatially segregated at least at this coarse level. Our
results are broadly consistent with previous findings that utilized developmental origin to differentiate
raphe serotonin neurons (Okaty et al., 2015).

The six types of serotonin neurons within principal DR exhibit further specificity in spatial
distributions. Specifically, serotonin neurons from DR-1–3 clusters are preferentially localized in
dorsal pDR, whereas those from DR-4–6 in ventral pDR, with DR-6 neurons preferentially localized
to the ventral lateral wings. These data support and extend our previous finding (Ren et al., 2018) for
the preferential ventral pDR location of Vglut3+ serotonin neurons, which is highly expressed in DR4 and DR-5 clusters. Together, these findings revealed the molecular basis for the differentiation of
dorsal/ventral DR sub-systems (Figure 2 and 3).

cDR has been suggested to be more similar to the MR than to pDR in their connectivity
(Commons, 2015; Kast et al., 2017). Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicated that serotonin
neurons in the cDR are strikingly homogenous and profoundly different from both pDR and MR at
the molecular level (Figure 1, Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). All cDR serotonin neurons
co-express Vglut3, and express several unique markers (Figure3—figure supplement 2). By contrast,
we could not discern obvious difference in spatial distributions among the four MR types, despite the
fact that MR serotonin neurons have heterogenous developmental origin (Jensen et al., 2008). It will
be interesting to examine in the future whether molecularly defined MR serotonin neurons have
specific axonal projection patterns.

We note that in a recent high-quality comprehensive whole-brain scRNA-seq study, Zeisel et
al. (2018) grouped 437 brainstem serotonin neurons in the dataset (presumably containing the entire
B1–B9 groups) into just five clusters. Compared to droplet-based platform of Zeisel et al., our FACSbased scRNA-seq platform allowed more sequencing depth per cell (Figure 1—supplement 1B) and
sequencing larger number of cells, accounting for our finer classification of transcriptomic types of
serotonin neurons. This illustrates the value of using genetically targeted strategies to characterize
important but rare types of cells in the brain.

In our previous study, we characterized two projection-defined parallel DR serotonin sub-systems. We
found that serotonin neurons that project to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and central amygdala (CeA)
differ in input and output patterns, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions (Ren
et al., 2018). Whole-brain collateralization patterns of these two sub-systems indicate that there must
be additional sub-systems projecting to regions not visited by either of these two sub-systems projects
to, including much of the thalamus and hypothalamus. What is the relationship between molecularly
defined serotonin neurons and projection-defined sub-systems?

Using viral-genetic intersectional approaches to access specifically Vglut3+ pDR serotonin
neurons in combination with staining in histological sections (Figure 6) and iDISCO-based whole
brain imaging (Figure 7), we found that these neurons project profusely to cover much of the
neocortex, as well as the olfactory bulb, cortical amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus. Comparisons of
the projection patterns of Vglut3+ (this study) with OFC-projecting DR serotonin neurons (Ren et al.,
2018) suggest that the latter is a large subset of the former. Brain regions that are innervated by Vglut3+
but not by OFC-projecting serotonin neurons include the somatosensory barrel cortex, ventral striatum,

and a specific subset of CeA. Interestingly, our previous study indicated that ~23% of CeA-projecting
DR serotonin neurons are Vglut3+ (Ren et al., 2018), so it is possible that even within a refined nucleus
like CeA, molecularly distinct serotonin projections are confined to sub-regions with a finer resolution.

We also assessed the whole-brain projection patterns of a largely complementary population
of DR serotonin neurons, namely those that express Trh and thus belong to DR-1–3 clusters. We found
that Trh+ serotonin neurons predominantly project to subcortical regions, most notably anterior and
medial nuclei of the hypothalamus and several thalamic nuclei, a pattern mostly complementary to the
Vglut3+ population (Figures 6–7, Video S1). Given that our previous CeA-projecting DR serotonin
neurons do not innervate most of the hypothalamus, and Trh+ serotonin neurons only partially
innervate CeA, these two populations are at most partially overlapping.

These comparisons support a broad correspondence between molecular identity and axonal
projection patterns at the level of DR serotonin neuronal populations that include multiple
transcriptomic clusters. These results will enable future testing of whether a more precise
correspondence exists at the level of single transcriptomic clusters that we have defined here. Our
transcriptome data suggest that each DR/MR serotonin neuron type can be distinguished from others
by the expression of two marker genes (Figure 1D; Figure3—figure supplement 1–3), supporting
the view that neuronal subtypes are generally specified by unique combination of genes rather than
single genes (Li et al., 2017b). With the generation of drivers based on these marker genes,
intersectional methods in combination with location-specific viral targeting can be used in the future
to dissect the projection patterns of the individual transcriptomic clusters.

The complexity of whole-brain projection patterns of Vglut3+ and Trh+ populations discussed above
can be driven by: 1) heterogeneity of projection patterns of different transcriptomic clusters within the
Vglut3+ or Trh+ population; 2) heterogeneity of projection patterns of serotonin neurons within the
same transcriptomic cluster; 3) complex collateralization patterns of individual serotonin neurons; and
4) a combination of some or all of the above. If scenario 1 were the only contributing factor, then there
would be only six different projection patterns for the pDR serotonin neurons. However, our singlecell reconstruction of DR serotonin neurons revealed many more than 6 branching patterns (e.g.,
Figure 8G), indicating that there must be diverse collateralization patterns even within the same
transcriptomic cluster, and highlighting the complexity of individual serotonin neuron projections.
Despite the complexity, these single-cell tracing data nevertheless suggest certain rules obeyed by
serotonin neurons.

First, there is a general segregation of cortical- and subcortical-projecting serotonin neurons.
Of the 46 forebrain-projecting DR serotonin neurons, 31 have a strong preference (>90% total axon
length) for innervating either cortical or subcortical regions. This is likely an underestimate of the
preference, especially for cortical-projecting ones, as their axons necessarily need to travel through
the subcortical regions to reach the cortex. (As a specific example, most forebrain-projecting DR
serotonin neurons pass through the lateral hypothalamus to reach their targets; it is thus difficult to
determine whether axons in the lateral hypothalamus play a local function.) Second, most of the
serotonin neurons tend to focus a majority of their arborization within one brain region (e.g., prefrontal
vs entorhinal cortex, Figure 8B; CeA vs MeA, Figure 8—figure supplement 4A3). The subcorticalprojecting serotonin neurons appear to have more specificity, with most neurons exhibiting dense
arborization in one or two nuclei. The cortical-projecting serotonin neurons can have elaborate
arborization patterns across multiple cortical areas (e.g., Figure 8—figure supplement 1C) and the
longest axon lengths per cell (Figure 8H).

Together with our study on the projection-defined serotonin sub-systems (Ren et al., 2018), we
believe it is unlikely that the major function of the forebrain-projecting serotonin system is to broadcast
information non-discriminately. Our study is limited by the scope (50 reconstructed cells out of 9000
DR serotonin neurons). To fully reveal the organizational logic of the serotonin system, efforts should
be put into larger scale single-cell reconstruction integrated with molecular identity and functional
studies of individual transcriptomic clusters of serotonin neurons.

The molecular features of different serotonin cell types suggest their functional properties. For
example, several studies have reported that subgroups of serotonin neurons in the MR and DR
express Vglut3 and indeed, subsequent slice recording confirmed that serotonin terminals can corelease glutamate and serotonin. In addition to neurochemical properties, each serotonin neuron
population reveals a specific combination of distinct genes responsible for electrophysiological (ion
channels), connectivity (wiring molecules), and functional (neurotransmitter/peptide receptors)
properties (Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). For example, most Crhr2+ neurons coexpress Vglut3 and Npy2r, which suggests that these serotonin neurons use glutamate as cotransmitter in their cortical targets, and are in turn modulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone and
neuropeptide Y. Meanwhile, most Trh+ serotonin neurons co-expression Gad1, Kcns1, and α1A
adrenergic receptors (Adra1a) specifically. We can speculate that these serotonin neurons use Trh
(and perhaps GABA) as co-transmitters to regulate the physiology of their subcortical targets, and
are in turn modulated by locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons.
Our previous study suggests that DR serotonin sub-systems have biased input but segregated
output (Ren et al., 2018). Here we found that each of the transcriptomic clusters of serotonin neurons
have distinct combination of axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules (Figure 4—figure
supplement 1A). These differentially expressed wiring molecules might be used during development
to set up distinct projection patterns of different serotonin neuron types (Deneris and Gaspar, 2018;
Kiyasova and Gaspar, 2011; Maddaloni et al., 2017), and/or used in adults to maintain wiring
connectivity or contribute to the remarkable ability of serotonergic axons to regenerate after injury
(Jin et al., 2016).

In conclusion, our comprehensive transcriptomic dataset and its 11 distinct groups of the DR
and MR serotonin neurons reveals the molecular heterogeneity of the forebrain-projecting serotonin
system. We have shown that the molecular features of these distinct serotonin groups reflect their
anatomical organization and provide tools for future exploration of the full projection map of
molecularly defined serotonin groups. The molecular architecture of serotonin system lays the
foundation to integrate connectivity, neurochemical, physiological, and behavioral functions. This
integrated understanding of serotonin can in turn provide novel therapeutic strategies to treat brain
disorders involving this important neuromodulator.

Generation of Sert-Flp mice. Sert-Flp was generated by the Gene Targeting and Transgenics core at
Janelia Research Campus. It was generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells
using standard procedures. A cassette of IRES-FlpO-loxP2272-ACE-Cre POII NeoR-loxp2272 was
inserted after the TAA stop codon of Sert. Targeting was verified in embryonic stem cells by longarm PCR. After microinjection, chimaeras were bred with CD-1 females and F1 offspring were
screened by long-arm PCR to identify mice with germline transmission of the correctly targeted
construct.

Generation of H11-CAG-FRT-stop-FRT-EGFP mice. H11-CAG-FRT-stop-FRT-EGFP was
generated using site-specific integrase-mediated transgenesis via pronuclear injection (Tasic et al.,
2011) by Stanford transgenic facility. The CAG-FRT-stop-FRT-EGFP cassette was inserted as a
single-copy transgene at the H11 locus (Tasic et al., 2011).

Single-cell isolation and sequencing. Lysis plates were prepared by dispensing 4 μl lysis buffer
as described in (Tabula Muris et al., 2018). After dissociation, single tdTomato+ cells were sorted
in 96-well plates using SH800S (Sony). Immediately after sorting, plates were sealed with a prelabelled aluminum seal, centrifuged, and flash frozen on dry ice. cDNA synthesis and library
preparation were performed using the Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014). Wells of each
library plate were pooled using a Mosquito liquid handler (TTP Labtech). Pooling was followed by
two purifications using 0.7x AMPure beads (Fisher, A63881). Library quality was assessed using
capillary electrophoresis on a Fragment Analyzer (AATI), and libraries were quantified by qPCR
(Kapa Biosystems, KK4923) on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
Libraries were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 Sequencing System (Illumina) using 2 × 75-bp
paired-end reads and 2 × 8-bp index reads.

Data processing. Sequences from the NextSeq were de-multiplexed using bcl2fastq version
2.19.0.316. Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using STAR version 2.6.1a (Dobin et al.,
2013). Gene counts were produced using HTseq version 0.11.2 (Anders et al., 2015) with default
parameters, except ‘stranded’ was set to ‘false’, and ‘mode’ was set to ‘intersection-nonempty’.
Genes located on Y chromosome were removed from the count table to exclude sex bias.

Clustering. Standard procedures for filtering, variable gene selection, dimensionality reduction
and clustering were performed using the Seurat package version 3.0 (Butler et al., 2018; Stuart et
al., 2019). Specifically, cells with fewer than 300 detected genes were excluded. A gene was
counted as expressed if it has at least one read mapping to it and is detected in at least 3 cells. Cells
with fewer than 50,000 reads were excluded. Counts were log-normalized for each cell using the
natural logarithm of 1 + counts per million [ln(CPM+1)]. All genes were projected onto a lowdimensional subspace using principal component analysis. Cells were clustered using a variant of
the Louvain method that includes a resolution parameter in the modularity function (Tabula Muris
et al., 2018) and visualized using a 2-dimensional t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding
(tSNE) of the PC-projected data. Molecularly distinct cell populations were assigned to each cluster

Gene co-expression networks. The relationship between gene expression was measured using rank
correlation statistics. Pearson correlations were computed across all cells. We first removed low
expressed genes by selecting genes with mean expression CPM>2, leaving ~8000 genes in the dataset.
Pearson correlation coefficients (rp) were computed for each gene and significance was tested by
bootstrapping (1,000 iterations). A correlation table containing rp above 0.3 and below –0.3 can be
found in Supplemental Table 3. Reported values are mean from the bootstrapped values. Gene
functional categories were retrieved from HGNC resource (https://www.genenames.org). Genes
assigned to more than one functional category were re-assigned a single category in the following
priority order : SNAREs, Secreted Ligands, ACh and Monoamine Receptors, Glutamate Receptors,
Axon Guidance and Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs), GABA Receptors, GPCRs, Ion Channel
Proteins, Transcription Factors, a full list of genes assigned to each category can be found in
Supplemental Table 2. Gene pairs for which rp<0.4 were removed and remaining pairs were
visualized as a network using igraph and visNetwork R packages. To further refine the final list of coexpressed genes and generate Figure 4D we focused on gene pairs for which:1) rp>0.5; 2) at least one
gene of the pair is found among cluster markers; 3) both genes of the correlating pair belong to one of
the above listed functional categories.

Mice were anesthetized either with 1.5%–2.0% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf
Instruments). For virus injection in to the DR, the following coordinates (in mm) were used: –4.3AP,
1.10 ML, –2.85 DV; –4.3AP, 1.10 ML, –2.70 DV, with 20° ML angle. (AP is relative to bregma; DV
is relative to the brain surface when AP is –1.0). After surgery, mice recovered on a heated pad until
ambulatory and then returned to their homecage.

The full design of Ef1a-CreON/FlpON-mGFP is Ef1a-fDIO-[membrane tag]-Kozak-loxP-STOPx3loxP-∆GFP. The AAV vector backbones that contained the Ef1a-fDIO were derived from pAAV-Ef1afDIO-EYFP (Addgene, 27437) (Fenno et al., 2014). The [membrane tag]-Kozak-loxP sequence was
synthesized by GenScript. The sequence of loxP-∆GFP were cloned by PCR. And then these two
pieces together with STOPx3 were ligated into the AAV-Ef1a-fDIO backbone in the antisense
orientation by Gibson assembly. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals
Inc and GenScript.

For whole brain tracing, the AAV vector carrying Ef1a-CreON/FlpON-mGFP were packaged into
AAV2/8 serotype with 1 x 1012 gc/ml by Gene Vector and Virus Core, Stanford University. 500 nl of
AAV-CreON/FlpON-mGFP was injected into the DR for each mouse. For single cell reconstruction,
AAV vectors carrying the TRE-DIO-FlpO, TRE-fDIO-GFP-IRES-tTA construct were packaged into
AAV2/9 serotype with titres 109–1010 gc/ml in Dr. Minmin Luo’s lab as described before (Lin et al.,
2018). AAV-TRE-DIO-FLPo (107 gc/ml) virus and AAV- TRE-fDIO-GFP-IRES-tTA (109 gc/ml) virus
were mixed with the ratio of 1:9. 200nL mixed virus was injected into the DR for each mouse.

Animals were perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were dissected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 12–24 hours in 4 ºC, then
placed in 30% sucrose for 24–48 hours. They were then embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature
(OCT, Tissue Tek) and stored at–80ºC until sectioning. For the antibody staining in Figure 1, 50-µm
sections containing DR were collected onto Superfrost Plus slides to maintain the anterior to posterior
sequence. All working solutions listed below included 0.2% NaN3 to prevent microbial growth. Slides
were then washed 3x10 min in PBS and pretreated overnight with 0.5 mM SDS at 37ºC. Slides were
then blocked for 4 hours at room temperature in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in PBS with 0.3%
Triton-X100 (PBST), followed by incubation in primary antibody (Novus, rabbit anti-Tph2) diluted
1:1000 in 5% NDS in PBST for 24 hours at RT. After 3x10 min washes in PBS, secondary antibody
was applied for 6 hours at room temperature (donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa-647 or Alexa-488, Jackson
ImmunoResearch), followed by 3x10 min washes in PBST. Slides were then stained for NeuroTrace
Blue (NTB, Invitrogen). For NTB staining, slides were washed 1x5 min in PBS, 2x10 min in PBST,
incubated for 2–3 hours at room temperature in (1:500) NTB in PBST, washed 1x20 min with PBST,
and 1x5 min with PBS. Sections were additionally stained with DAPI (1:10,000 of 5 mg/mL, SigmaAldrich) in PBS for 10–15 min and washed once more with PBS. Slides were mounted and coversliped
with Fluorogel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After that, the slides were then imaged either using a
Zeiss 780 confocal microscope or a 3i spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-W1 SoRa), and
images were processed using NIH ImageJ software. After that, whole slides were then imaged with a
5x objective using a Leica Ariol slide scanner with the SL200 slide loader.

After 8-10 weeks of virus expression, mice were transcardially perfused with 20 ml 1x PBS containing
10 µg/ml heparin followed by 20 ml of 4% PFA before removing each brain and allowing them to
postfix overnight at 4 C. The clearing protocol largely follows the steps outlined in (Chi et al., 2018).
Brains were washed at room temperature with motion at least 30 minutes each step: 3x in 1x PBS
before switching to 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.3 M glycine (B1N buffer) and being stepwise
(20/40/60/80%) dehydrated into 100% methanol. Delipidation was carried out by an overnight
incubation in 2:1 mixture of DCM:methanol and a 1 hour incubation in 100% DCM the following day.
After 3x washes in 100% methanol, brains were bleached for 4 hours in a 5:1 mix of methanol: 30%
H2O2 and then stepwise (80/60/40/20%) restored into B1N buffer. Samples were permeabilized with
2 washes of PTxwH buffer containing 5% DMSO and 0.3M glycine for 3 hours before being washed
in PTxwH overnight. Antibody labeling was carried out in PTxwH buffer at 37 C with motion.
Primary antibody (Aves 1020; chicken anti-GFP, 1:1000) was added and samples were incubated for
11 days. After 3 days of washes, secondary antibody (Thermo A-31573, AlexaFluor 647 donkey antichicken, 1:1000) was added for 8 days, followed by another 3 days of washes. One final day of
washing in 1x PBS preceded clearing. Samples were again dehydrated stepwise into methanol, using
water as the alternative fraction. Delipidation proceeded as before with a DCM/methanol mixture
overnight and 2x 1 hour DCM-only incubations the next day. Brains were finally cleared for 4 hours
in dibenzyl ether and then stored in a fresh tube of dibenzyl ether at least 24 hours before imaging.

Samples were imaged with a LaVision Ultramicroscope II lightsheet using a 2x objective and
3 µm z-step size. Antibody fluorescense was collected from a 640 nm laser and autofluorescense
captured from 488 nm illumination. Image volumes were processed and analyzed with custom Python
and MATLAB scripts. In short, we trained a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network (Çiçek, et al.,
2016) to identify axons in volumes and post-processed the resulting probability-based volumes as
previously described (Ren et al., 2018). Using the autofluorescent channel, we aligned samples to the
Allen Institute’s Common Coordinate Framework (Renier et al., 2016), applied the same
transformation vectors to the volumetric projection of axons, and quantified total axon content in each
brain region listed in Supplemental Table 4.

Probes were generated for use with HCR v3.0 (Molecular Technologies) (Choi et al., 2018). Wildtype
8 week old mice were perfused and brains were removed and fixed as described above. Following an
overnight postfix, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose until they sank and subsequently frozen
at -80 C. The midbrain raphe nuclei were sectioned coronally at either 16 or 20 µm directly onto a
glass slide, and dried at room temperature for 4-6 hours before storing at -20 C overnight. Sections
were re-fixed again in 4% PFA, washed in 1x PBS, treated with a solution containing 50ml H2O,
0.5ml 1M Tris ph7.4, 100ul 0.5M EDTA, 35ul ProK for 6 minutes at 37 C before another round of
PFA fixation and PBS washing. Hybridization and amplification steps were carried out as
recommended by Molecular Technologies. Imaging was performed with a Zeiss 780 LSM confocal
using a 20x objective. Double labeled cells were counted manually using the CellCounter plugin for
FIJI software.

fMOST imaging and image preprocessing. 4–6 weeks after virus injection, brains were dissected and
post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr at 4 °C. The brains were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS (SigmaAldrich) three times (for 2 h each) and embedded in Lowicryl HM20 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
14340). We use a fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) system to acquire the
brain-wide image dataset at high resolutions (0.23 × 0.23×1 μm for 10 brains and 0.35 × 0.35×1 μm for
the other 9 brains). Embedded brain samples were mounted on a 3D translation stage in a water bath with
propidium iodide (PI). The fMOST system automatically performs the coronal sectioning with 1um steps
and imaging with 2 color channels in 16-bit depth. The green channel of GFP is for visualization of
neurons and the red channel of PI counterstaining is for visualization the whole brain cytoarchitecture.

Image annotation and skeletonization. Amira software (v 5.4.1, Visage imaging, Inc) were used for
semi-automatically reconstruction of single neurons. First, we use Amira to load a relatively large volume
but low-resolution data and find the position of soma or major axon as a start position. Then, one by one,
we load each small volume (800× 800×400 voxels) of highest resolution data along the axons and
dendrites to label the full structure of each neuron. We have totally reconstructed 50 high quality neurons
with complete and clear axon terminals. The reconstructed neurons were checked by one another person.

Image registration and visualization. Reconstructed neurons were aligned to the Allen Common
Coordinate Framework (CCF). Elastix (Klein 2010) were used to register the manually segmented outline
of a downsampled version of the PI-staining vloume (25 x 25 x 25 μm voxel size) to the outline of CCF
(25 x 25 x 25μm voxel size). An initial affine registration was applied for align the sample to CCF,
followed by an iterative non-rigid b-spline transformation for more precise registration. The generated
parameters were used for coordinate transformation of reconstructed neurons to align them to the CCF.
Cinema 4d (MAXON Computer GmbH, Germany) and customized python scripts were used to generate
3D rendered images and movies.

reaction-based single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR-smFISH) of 16 cluster
markers. (A) Positions of double-positive neurons (Tph2 and each of 16 marker genes color-coded on
the top) are shown on 4 schematics representing coronal slices 250 µm apart. Red line around the
aqueduct represents the average boundary drawn from raw data for each slice. Scale bar, 500 µm. (B)
Representative images for each of the genes schematized in (A). All green cells are Tph2-positive, red
cells express the indicated marker gene. Each image corresponds to one of the four numbered
schematics in (A) and is located immediately ventral to the aqueduct unless otherwise noted as MR,
lateral wing (lw), or cDR. Cyan box highlights the individual color zoom region at right. White

Figure 3. Summary of spatial distribution of transcriptomic clusters of serotonin neurons. (A) Purple
dots represent distribution of Clusters 1–6 markers listed in panel (B); green dots represent the
distribution Irx2 and Piezo2 cells that are Cluster 9–11 markers; and cyan dots present distribution of
Met+ and Tacr3+ cells, which are co-expressed in Cluster 7, but is additionally expressed in Cluster
10 (Met) or Cluster 11 (Tacr3). (B) Collectively, scRNA-seq and HCR-smFISH experiments support
the model that Clusters 1–6 from Figure 1B correspond to pDR serotonin neurons (renamed DR-1–6),
Cluster 7 corresponds to cDR serotonin neurons, and Clusters 8–11 correspond to MR serotonin
neurons.

diagram showing the number of cells co-expressing genes associated with markers for different
neurotransmitter systems: Gad1/2, Vmat2, Vgat, and Vglut3 (left) and neuropeptides: Trh, Crh, Sst,
Pdyn (right). We consider a gene to be expressed if it has at least one read mapping to it and is
detected in at least 3 cells (Materials and methods). (B) Expression of the most variable
neuropeptides, receptors, and transcription factors across molecularly distinct serotonin neuron
clusters. (C) Network representation of co-expressed genes that belong to one of the functional gene
categories that organize transcriptional regulation, synaptic connectivity, and neuronal
communications. Networks were constructed based on Pearson correlation coefficient (rp) of gene
expression across all cells and centered on pDR- and MR+cDR-specific genes. Genes appear
connected if rp >0.4. Line width represents rp. Nodes are colored according to functional gene
categories.

performed on consecutive coronal sections containing DR. 98.5% GFP + neurons are Tph2+ and 100%
Tph2+ neurons are GFP+ (n = 3 mice). (C) In mice triple transgenic for Vglut3-Cre, Sert-Flp, and the
IS reporter (Rosa-CAG-loxP-stop-loxP-FRT-tdTomato-FRT-EGFP), EGFP+ (Flp+Cre+) cells are
referentially found in ventral pDR and in cDR (arrowheads). Coronal sections containing DR are
shown, counterstained with Anti-Tph2 (red). (D) In mice triple transgenic for Gad2-Cre, Sert-Flp, and
