ABSTRACT

25

Formycin A (FOR-A) and pyrazofurin A (PRF-A) are purine-related C-nucleoside

26

antibiotics, in which ribose and a pyrazole-derived base are linked by a C-glycosidic

27

bond, however, the logic underlying the biosynthesis of these molecules has

28

remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of the pathways for

29

FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis from diverse actinobacteria, and demonstrate that

30

their biosynthesis is initiated by a lysine N6-monooxygenase. Moreover, we show

31

that the forT and prfE (individually related to FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis)

enzymatic basis of ForT/PrfE for the C-glycosidic bond formation in FOR-A/PRF-A

biosynthesis. To our knowledge, ForT/PrfE represents the first example of β-RFA-P

INTRODUCTION

69

Naturally-occurring C-nucleosides, e.g. formycin A (FOR-A) and pyrazofurin A

70

(PRF-A) (Fig. 1) of microbial origin, are widely-distributed biological molecules in

71

which the base and ribosyl moieties are linked via a structurally conserved

72

C-glycosidic bond (1, 2). Pseudouridine, the first discovered C-nucleoside, is the most

73

prevalent of the over one hundred different modified nucleosides found in

74

eukaryotic RNA (3). Moreover, a pseudouridine metabolic pathway from E. coli has

75

been previously reported and well-characterized (4). Also an important part of this

76

group is the potent C-nucleoside antibiotics, which include the purine-related FOR-A

77

and PRF-A (2), and the pyrimidine-derived showdomycin (5) and pseudouridimycin

78

(Fig. 1) (6). The pathway for showdomycin biosynthesis was discovered relying on

79

the enzyme pair AlnA (C-glycosyltransferase) and AlnB (phosphatase) as a probe,

80

which catalyzes the formation of the C-ribosylated aromatic polyketide alnumycin C

81

in a two-step process (5). Recently, Sosio et al, identified the pseudouridimycin

82

biosynthetic gene cluster by searching for the gene (contained in a gene cluster)

83

encoding pseudouridine synthase (6).

84

FOR-A was originally isolated from the broth of Nocardia interforma in the process

85

of screening for antitumor compounds (7), and later, this antibiotic, accompanied by

86

FOR-B (a deaminated product of FOR-A) (Fig. 1), was discovered to be produced by

87

Streptomyces lavendulae (8). FOR-A and FOR-B (particularly the latter) show

88

bioactivities against Xanthomonas oryzae, a pathogen incurring a rice plant disease,

89

and the influenza A virus, while only FOR-A shows antitumor and antiviral activities

90

(9). Subsequently, FOR-A and coformycin (COF, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor

91

harboring a 1,3-diazepine ring) were found to be concomitantly produced by

92

Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072 and Streptomyces kaniharaensis SF-557 (ATCC

93

21070) (Fig. 1) (10). This intriguing co-biosynthetic phenomenon was also

94

documented for other purine nucleoside antibiotics pairs, including pentostatin (PTN)

95

and arabinofuranosyl adenine (Ara-A) (produced by Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL

96

3238) (11), 2’-Cl PTN and 2’-amino-2’-deoxyadenosine (produced by Actinomadura

97

sp. ATCC 39365) (12), and fungus-produced PTN and cordycepin (13), which all

98

employ an unusual but general protector-protégé strategy, i.e. PTN may protect

99

Ara-A (taking this antibiotic-pair as example) from deamination by the housekeeping

100

adenosine deaminase (11-13).

101

PRF-A, produced by Streptomyces candidus NRRL 3601, possesses prominent

102

antiviral and antitumor activities, but interestingly, PRF-B (Fig. 1), the α-anomer of

103

PRF-A co-produced by this strain at a less amount, shows little bioactivity (14).

104

Previous elegant studies indicated that PRF-A blocks de novo biosynthesis of

105

pyrimidine and purine by independently targeting orotidylate decarboxylase (15)

106

and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) formyltransferase (16).

107

Earlier isotope feeding experiments have demonstrated that glutamate and ribose

108

play key roles in C-glycosidic bond formation of FOR-A, and indicated that the C-3 to

109

C-6 unit of PRF-A (C-9, C-4, C-5, and C-6 of FOR-A) is derived from C-4 to C-1 of

110

glutamate and/or α-ketoglutarate (17). Moreover, Ochi et al, confirmed that N-3, N-7,

111

and N-8 of FOR-A originate from the ε-amino nitrogen of lysine (18). More recently,

112

Wang et al, identified the FOR-A biosynthetic gene cluster on the basis of previous

113

studies (19), and deciphered the tailoring steps to FOR-A biosynthesis, by which they

114

have established that FOR-A biosynthesis shares a crosstalk with the de novo purine

115

pathway (19). Although a pathway for FOR-A biosynthesis was tentatively proposed,

116

several important aspects have still remained unveiled.

In the present work, we report the identification and comparative analysis of the

118

FOR-A/PRF-A biosynthetic gene clusters from diverse actinobacteria, and further

RESULTS

125

Identification of the FOR-A gene clusters from diverse actinobacteria

126

FOR-A and COF were formerly reported to be co-produced by the actinobacteria,

127

Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072 and S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070 (7, 10),

128

implicating that the genes for their biosyntheses, as those of other purine nucleoside

129

antibiotic pairs, should also constitute a gene cluster (11, 12), Additionally, COF and

130

PTN, featuring significant structural resemblance, were recently revealed to share

131

highly-similar biosynthetic pathways (20).

132

To identify the target gene clusters for FOR-A biosynthesis, we sequenced the

133

genomes of both strains using the Illumina method, which rendered ca. 9.3-Mb

134

(Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072) and ca. 8.6-Mb (S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070) of

135

non-redundant bases after assembly of clean reads. We then utilize PenB

136

(short-chain dehydrogenase) and PenC (SAICAR synthetase), the key enzymes for

137

PTN biosynthesis, as probes (11), and the target gene clusters encoding the enzymes

138

denoted as FocJ/CofA (66%/49% identity to PenB), and FocI1/CofB (69%/62%

139

identity to PenC) (Fig. 2A, Table S1), respectively, were detected by genome mining

140

of Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072 and S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070. To correlate

141

the foc gene cluster to FOR-A biosynthesis, we deleted a 1.8-kb region (containing

142

focH, focI1, and focJ) (Fig. S1A). After confirmation by PCR analysis (Fig. S1B), the

143

resultant mutant was fermented for metabolite analysis, and the HPLC and LC-HRMS

144

analyses indicated that the production of FOR-A and COF was abolished in the PC1

145

mutant (Fig. 2B, C, Fig. S1C), confirming the identity of the foc gene cluster for the

146

biosynthesis of the COF-FOR-A pair.

147

Further bioinformatic analysis led to the discovery of several potential FOR-A

148

gene clusters with organizational diversities from other actinobacteria strains,

149

including Streptomyces resistomycificus NRRL 2290 and Salinispora arenicola

150

CNS-205 (Fig. S2A). We then fermented both of the strains for metabolites analysis,

151

and the HPLC and LC-MS results indicated that S. resistomycificus NRRL 2290, but

152

not Salinispora arenicola CNS-205, is capable of synthesizing FOR-A under the

153

chosen fermentation conditions (Fig. S2B-D). These data suggested that the FOR-A

154

gene clusters highlighting organizational diversities are widely-distributed among

155

actinobacteria, but only partial strains are conferred with the capability of FOR-A

156

production.

157
158

Discovery of the PRF-A gene cluster from S. candidus NRRL 3601

159

The PRF-A molecule is structurally similar to FOR-A, implicating that both of them

160

should employ identical or similar enzymatic logic for the construction of the

161

pyrazole ring. To search for the candidate gene cluster for PRF-A biosynthesis, we

162

sequenced the genome of S. candidus NRRL 3601, generating ca. 8.3-Mb

163

non-redundant bases after assembly of orderly data, and then we used FocG

164

(methionine-tRNA ligase) as an enzyme probe to perform BlastP analysis. This

165

approach leads to the location of a candidate gene cluster from the genome of S.

166

candidus NRRL 3601, encoding PrfO (86%/58% identities to FocG/ForJ), and

167

neighboring genes PrfN (L-lysine N6-monooxygenase, 84%/62% identities to

168

FocF/ForK) and PrfP (SAICAR synthetase, 82%/60% identities to FocI1/CofB). This

169

strongly suggested that the target gene cluster is involved in PRF-A biosynthesis (Fig.

170

2A, Tables 1, S1).

171
172

Comparative analysis of the gene clusters for FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis

173

Comparative analysis of the FOR-A gene clusters revealed that they indicate

174

apparent diversities in genetic organization as well as in the total number of genes.

175

The FOR-A gene cluster (30 genes) from S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070 spans a 37.0-kb

176

continuous chromosomal region, while the counterpart foc gene cluster (26 genes)

177

from Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072 is ca. 29.4-kb in size (Fig. 2A, Tables 1, S1). As

178

anticipated, in silico analysis indicated that the genes for FOR-A and COF

179

biosynthesis are linked together as reported by a recent study (19). Moreover, there

180

are 7 additional genes (forW, forV, forO, forG, cof25, cof26, and cof29) in S.

181

kaniharaensis ATCC 21070 (Table S1), and it is proposed to execute some alternative

182

functions during FOR-A and COF biosynthesis in this strain.

183

The prf gene cluster, as shown by bioinformatic analysis, is composed of 24 genes

184

and approximately occupies a continuous 27.1-kb chromosomal region of S.

185

candidus NRRL 3601. The homologous prf and foc gene clusters contain some

186

specialized genes, respectively (Fig. 2A). Of these, the genes prfC (encoding HAD

187

family hydrolase), prfD (encoding a cupin domain containing protein), prfW

188

(encoding flavin reductase), and prfX (encoding FMN reductase) are only present in

189

prf gene cluster (Table 1). Further analysis indicates that the foc gene cluster

190

contains the special genes focP (AICAR transformylase) and focO (adenylosuccinate

191

synthetase) for the tailoring steps of FOR-A biosynthesis (Table S1). More

192

interestingly, the candidate genes prfP, prfQ, and prfS (corresponding to focI1, focJ,

193

and focL), whose products are homologous to PenC, PenB, and PenA, respectively,

194

from the PTN pathway, are also present in prf gene cluster. However, more

195

surprisingly, we were unable to identify the potential COF-related compounds, either

196

COF or PTN, from the culture broths of S. candidus NRRL 3601 under lab

197

fermentation conditions. Moreover, two particular genes, focM (codes for a

198

dehydrogenase) and focH (codes for an aminotransferase), are only existent in the

199

FOR-A gene cluster, suggesting that both of them are involved in the dedicated

200

enzymatic steps in FOR-A biosynthesis (Table S1).

201
202

Biosynthesis of FOR-A and PRF-A is initiated by the lysine N6-monooxygenase

203

ForK/PrfN

204

FOR-A and PRF-A feature a distinctive hydrazine moiety (N-N bond) (Fig. 1), which

205

is also present in s56-p1, a dipeptide natural product produced by Streptomyces sp.

206

SoC090715LN-17 (21). A recent study has revealed that the N-N bond construction is

207

confirmatively governed by a cascade of two enzymes, Spb38 (lysine

208

N6-monooxygenase) and Spb40 (methionine-tRNA ligase-like protein) (Table 1, Fig.

209

3A) (21). Bioinformatic analysis of the FOR-A and PRF-A gene cluster rendered the

210

identification of two candidates ForK/PrfN (deduced lysine N6-monooxygenase) and

211

ForJ/PrfO (methionine-tRNA ligase-like protein) (Table S1, Fig. S3). To determine if

212

ForK/PrfN fulfils the potential role of lysine N6-monooxygenase for the initiation of

213

FOR-A/PRF-A biosynthesis, we overexpressed and purified the protein in E. coli (Fig.

214

S4A). As expected, the ForK/PrfN protein displays color of light yellow (Fig. S4B), a

215

typical characteristic of flavoprotein (Fig. S5). We then tested their enzymatic

216

activity in vitro with L-lysine as substrate and NADPH as cofactor. As anticipated,

217

LC-MS analysis indicated that the ForK/PrfN reaction mixtures are capable of

218

generating a distinctive [M+H]+ ion of N6-OH lysine at m/z 163.1088/163.1079, with

219

three major fragment ions at m/z 99.8577/99.9317, 129.9084/129.9299, and

220

144.8742/144.9361 (Fig. 3B, Fig. S6A-B), which are completely consistent with the

221

fragmentation pattern of the positive control (the NbtG reaction) (Fig. S6C-D, Table

222

S4) (22). However, the reaction (without enzyme added as negative control)

223

mixtures, as detected by LC-MS, could not produce the expected MS peaks (Fig. 3B).

224

Moreover, we tested the cofactor specificity for the two enzymes, and the LC-MS

225

results indicated that the reaction mixtures with NADH as cofactor is also able to

226

give the anticipated [M+H]+ ion of N6-OH lysine, confirming that NADH could also

227

support the activity of PrfN/ForK (Fig. S7). Taken together, these enzymatic data

228

established that PrfN/ForK is undoubtedly a lysine N6-monooxygenase for the

229

initiation of PRF-A/FOR-A biosynthesis.

230
231

The ΔforT and ΔprfE mutants accumulate the corresponding intermediates,

232

compound 11 and 9a

233

FOR-A/PRF-A features an unusual C-nucleoside scaffold, but how nature

234

constructs the C-C bond has long remained mysterious. In silico investigation of the

235

FOR-A/PRF-A

236

β-ribofuranosyl-aminobenzene 5'-phosphate synthase (Tables 1, S1). To investigate

237

the in vivo functional role of forT/prfE, we in-frame deleted it using a CRISPR-Cas9

238

strategy (Fig. S8A-B, S9A-B) (23). As S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070 proved more

239

amenable to in-frame deletion manipulation than Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072,

240

it was used in this study for the following genetic experiments. After confirmation by

241

a combined PCR and sequencing analysis (Fig. S8B, Table S5), the mutant ΔforT was

242

fermented for metabolites analysis. HPLC analysis indicated that the metabolites of

243

the ΔforT mutant could not generate the distinctive FOR-A peak, while capable of

244

yielding a new one (compound 11) at RT = 15.8 min with UVmax = 308 nm (Fig. 4A, Fig.

245

S8C-E). LC-MS analysis of compound 11 indicates that it shows an apparent [M+H]+

246

ion at m/z 172.0353 (Fig. 4A), which could produce a specific fragment ion at m/z

247

153.8110 (Fig. S8F). Likewise, the confirmed ΔprfE mutant (Fig. S9B, Table S5) lacks

248

the capability of PRF-A and PRF-B production (Fig. S9C-D), but its metabolites could

249

generate an obvious new peak (compound 9a) at RT = 22.5 min with UVmax = 273 nm

250

(Fig. 4B, Fig. S9E). LC-MS analysis of the compound 9a peak indicates that it shows

251

an apparent [M+H]+ ion at m/z 173.0193 as well as the main fragment at m/z

252

154.0294 (Figs. 4B, S9F).

253

To determine the chemical structures of compounds 11 and 9a, we initially

254

purified them via HPLC preparation for NMR analysis. However, neither of them

255

gave rise to any apparently detectable 1H signals for structure elucidation, and we

256

were therefore prompted to optimize the conditions of compound 11/9a

257

crystallization for X-ray structure determination (Fig. 4CD, Tables S6, S7). To our

258

surprise, we found that the compound 11/9a harbors a highly-conjugated

259

five-membered structural system, in which two N-atoms (N1 and N2) are linked

260

together to form an unusual N-N bond (Fig. 4CD, Tables S6, S7). It is exactly because

261

of the peculiar structure of 11/9a that directly results in the almost undetectable 1H

262

signals during NMR analysis. Taken together, these combined genetic and crystal

263

data suggested that prfE/forT is most likely the candidate gene for the C-C bond

264

formation during PRF-A/FOR-A biosynthesis.

265

PrfE/ForT is a β-RFA-P synthase-like enzyme for the C-glycosidic bond formation

266

during PRF-A/FOR-A biosynthesis

267

Bioinformatic analysis indicated that PrfE/ForT (Tables 1, S1) exhibits high

268

homology (81%/64%) to Orf61 (hypothetic β-RFA-P synthase) from Nocardia

269

terpenica (Fig. S10). β-RFA-P synthase is responsible for the first committed step of

270

methanopterin

271

pyrophosphate (PRPP) and p-aminobenzoate (pABA) to β-RFA-P (Fig. 1) and CO2 (24).

272

To obtain direct biochemical evidence that PrfE/ForT governs the C-glycosidic bond

273

construction during PRF-A/FOR-A biosynthesis, we overexpressed and purified these

274

proteins from E. coli to near homogeneity and assayed them in vitro using PRPP and

275

compound 9a/11 as substrates (Fig. S11A-B). The HPLC traces indicated that the

276

product of the PrfE reaction is capable of producing a new peak at RT = 6.5 min with

277

a distinctive UVmax = 267 nm (Fig. S12A), which is absent from that of the negative

278

control (the reaction without PrfE added) (Fig. 5A, C, D). Further LC-MS analysis

279

indicated that the product of the PrfE reaction exhibits an obvious [M+H]+ ion at m/z

280

341,0393 as well as the main fragment ions at m/z 224.9183, 242.8766, 322.9725,

281

and others (Figs. 5A, S12E, I). Moreover, the reaction without the divalent metal

282

Mg2+ is not able to generate the characteristic peak of the product. We therefore

283

purified the target compound for further 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR analysis (Fig. S13-S17,

284

and Table S8), and its chemical structure, on the basis of the combined NMR and

285

MS/MS analysis, was finally determined as compound 19.

287

capable of producing a characteristic peak (compound 12) with a distinctive UVmax =

288

290 nm (Fig. 5B, S12B), which is distinctly absent from the reaction mixtures without

289

ForT/Mg2+. Additional tandem MS/MS analysis showed that the target peak could

290

produce an apparent [M+H]+ ion at m/z 340.0539 (Fig. 5B), with major fragments

291

ions at m/z 205.9951, 223.8481, and 321.9420, completely consistent with the

292

theoretical fragmentation pattern of compound 12 (Fig. S12F, J). Furthermore, we

293

tested the substrate flexibility for PrfE, and the results indicated that this enzyme

294

could also accept 11 to form 12 (Figs. 5B, S12C, D, G, H), but that conversely, ForT is

295

not capable of recognizing 11 as substrate (Fig. 5A).

296

Subsequently, we examined the specificities of divalent metal ions for PrfE/ForT

297

activity. Of the 6 divalent metal ions selected, Mn2+ and Co2+ are able to maintain the

298

maximal activity for PrfE (100%), but it indicates either dramatically decreased

299

activity in the presence of Ni2+/Zn2+, or negative activity with Ca2+/Cu2+ added

300

instead (Fig. S12K). For the ForT reaction, Co2+ could also support its maximal activity,

301

while Mn2+ (61%), Ni2+ (52%), Zn2+ (84%), or Ca2+/Cu2+ (0%) are just partially able or

302

unable to take the role of Mg2+ to support the enzymatic activity of ForT (Fig. S12L).

303

All of these biochemical data demonstrate that PrfE/ForT functions as an unusual

304

β-RFA-P synthase-like enzyme for the C-glycosidic bond formation during

305

PRF-A/FOR-A biosynthesis.

DISCUSSION
Earlier metabolic labelling experiments determined that glutamate and lysine

309

were the precursors for FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis, and the ribosyl moiety of

310

both antibiotics was directly from the primary metabolism (17, 18). In the present

311

study, this assignment is shown to be essentially correct. Insight into the

312

biosynthetic gene cluster of PRF-A/FOR-A (only the PRF enzymes for common steps

313

of both antibiotics are listed in Fig. 6) results in the identification of the enzymes for

314

the construction of pyrazole ring system (Fig. 6A). PRF-A Biosynthesis is proposed to

315

be initiated by PrfN catalyzing L-lysine to form N6-OH lysine, which, just as most

316

lysine N6-monooxygenases, prefers NADPH as cofactor (22). Concomitantly,

317

L-glutamate is dehydrogenated to form 1, and then both intermediates are utilized

318

by PrfO (methionine tRNA ligase) to construct the N-N bond in compound 3, which is

319

catalyzed by PrfK (amino acid oxidase) to afford 4 with leaving of compound 5.

320

Following on from this, we tentatively propose that compound 4 is hydroxylated by

321

PrfH/I in a sequential manner at C-4 position to generate 6, which would be

322

successively dehydrated via either a spontaneous or an unknown enzymatic strategy

323

to give rise to 7. Further investigation of the PRF-A gene cluster results in the

324

identification

325

synthetase-like protein), which usually catalyzes the second step in de novo purine

326

pathway (25). We therefore postulate that 7, under the catalysis of PrfL, is

327

subsequently converted to 8 for the accomplishment of the pyrazole ring

328

construction. Thereafter, we propose that 8, after oxidation to 9a, will further

329

undergo a series of sequential reactions to complete PRF-A biosynthesis (Fig. 6A).

331

acceptor, will be modified by the aminotransferase ForI to 10, which is then

332

dehydrogenated to give the compound 11. Actually, the aminotransferase (ForI) and

333

dehydrogenase (ForF) are the particular enzymes absent from the PRF-A pathway,

334

implying that they should perform these definite functions to accomplish 11

335

biosynthesis (Fig. 6A), and related biochemical studies in our laboratory are now

336

ongoing. Once the C-glycosidic bond constructed, the later tailoring enzymatic steps

337

are highly similar to those in the de novo purine pathway, which has already been

338

illustrated in two recent studies (19, 26).

339

There are several other genes (prfDMWX) whose functional roles are still

340

ambiguous. In particular, the product of prfD (cupin domain containing protein) is

341

probably responsible for the conversion of PRF-B to PRF-A, although it is also

342

possible to synthesize PRF-B from PRF-A via a spontaneous way. Hence, tentatively,

343

PrfD is proposed to be an isomerase during PRF-A biosynthesis. PrfM is a potential

344

saccharopine dehydrogenase, which normally plays a key role in lysine biosynthesis

345

(27). Accordingly, we propose that PrfM could be responsible for a salvage pathway

346

for lysine regeneration during PRF-A biosynthesis (Fig. 6B). For the enzymes, PrfW

347

and PrfX, they are apparently homologous to flavin/FMN reductase, and could be

348

involved in the reductive recycle of FMN/FAD cofactor in PRF-A biosynthesis.

349

C-Nucleoside antibiotics have arrested increasing interests for clinical uses in the

350

past decades (2), but their biosynthetic logics have long been under-appreciated due

351

to their difficult-to-access pathways. Actually, nature has developed diverse

352

strategies for C-glycosidic bond construction during the biosynthesis of this group of

353

antibiotics. Showdomycin biosynthesis uses a YeiN-like C-glycosyltransferase to build

354

the C-C bond (5), while pseudouridimycin and malayamycin are deduced to exploit a

355

tRNA (TruD-like) pseudouridylate synthase for C-glycosidic bond construction (6, 28).

356

In the present study, FOR-A and PRF-A harness a totally different β-RFA-P

357

synthase-like enzyme (ForT/PrfE) to catalyze the formation of C-glycosides. The usual

358

role for β-RFA-P synthase has exclusively been in the biosynthesis of the modified

359

folate methanopterin (Fig. S18A) (24). In this respect, ForT/PrfE represents the first

360

example of this kind of enzymes responsible for the C-glycosidic bond formation in

361

natural products biosynthesis. Hence, similar to β-RFA-P synthase (24), we predict

362

that ForT/PrfE should employ a SN1-like enzymatic strategy associated with a cryptic

363

decarboxylation for the construction of the C-glycosidic bond during PRF-A/FOR-A

364

biosynthesis. Notably, the single β-RFA-P synthase-like enzyme (ForT/PrfE) could be

365

used as a promising probe for the rational mining of related C-nucleoside antibiotics,

366

and we have already discovered several potential PRF-A/FOR-A group antibiotic

367

pathways from the currently-available reservoir of microbial genomes (Fig. S18B).

368

In summary, we report the pathways for FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis using a

369

genomics-led approach, and have delineated the associated FOR-A gene-cluster

370

diversity in actinobacteria. We have also demonstrated that biosynthesis of FOR-A

371

and PRF-A is initiated by a lysine N6-monooxygenase, and show that PrfE/ForT

372

adopts a unique strategy for the C-glycosidic bond formation in nucleoside

373

antibiotics biosynthesis. We anticipate that the C-glycosyltransferases shown in this

374

study may serve as an inspiration for future catalyst design to generate analogs of

For the construction of the mutant Nocardia interforma PC1, a similar strategy by

387

Wu et al (11), with Ni-lfdsaicar-LF/R (Left arm) and Ni-lfdsaicar-RF/R (Right arm) as

388

primers and pOJ446 as starter vector, was also used in this study. For the

gRNA, after annealing, was cloned into the XbaI/NcoI-engineered site of

391

pCRISPR-Cas9 (23) to generate pCas9-gRNA. Subsequently, the PCR products of

392

left-arm, the right-arm, and the StuI-engineered pCas9-gRNA, amplified by KOD plus

In vitro assays of ForT and PrfE

401

Reactions consist of 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM PRPP, 20 mM Mg2+ (or

402

other related divalent metal ions), 1 mM compound 11/9a, and 20 µg ForT/PrfE at

403

30 °C for 4 h. After that, reactions were terminated by the addition of an equivalent

404

volume of methanol, and protein was removed by centrifugation. The HPLC analysis

405

was performed on a reverse phase C18 column (Shimadzu, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with

406

an elution gradient of 10%-30% methanol: 0.1% aqueous TFA (HPLC grade) over 15

407

min at 0.5 mL/min, and then the methanol system returned to the initial 10% and

408

maintained the ration for another 15 min. The elution was monitored at 290 nm (for

409

ForT reaction) or 270 nm (for PrfE reaction) with a DAD detector, and the data were

410

analyzed offline with Shimadzu data software.

(A) Genetic organizations of the PRF-A/FOR-A and COF (related) gene cluster. The

518

PRF-A gene cluster (prf) is from S. candidus NRRL 3601, and the FOR-A and COF gene

519

cluster (foc) is from Nocardia interforma ATCC 21072; The genes responsible for

520

FOR-A and COF biosynthesis (for and cof) in S. kaniharaensis ATCC 21070 are also

521

designated as cof1-30 (from left to right, Accession no. GenBank KY705052); The

522

genes for COF biosynthesis in ATCC 21070 are marked by red, and the designation

523

cof was used for the consistency with the study by wang et al (but cof25, cof26,

524

cof29, and cof30 are missed or not denoted in this work);19 In addition, the foc genes

525

at the top correspond to the prf genes, by which the encoded enzymes are

526

individually homologous; Noc. interforma ATCC 21072, Nocardia interforma ATCC

527
