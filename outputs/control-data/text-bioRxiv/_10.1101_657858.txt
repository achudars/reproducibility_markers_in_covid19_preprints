ABSTRACT (Unreferenced, ~150 words)

Quantitative phosphoproteomics has in recent years revolutionized understanding of cell
signaling, but it remains a challenge to scale the technology for high-throughput analyses. Here
we present a rapid and reproducible phosphoproteomics approach to systematically analyze
hundreds of samples by fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using data
independent acquisition (DIA). To overcome the inherent issue of positional phosphopeptide
isomers in DIA-based phosphoproteomics, we developed and employed an accurate site
localization scoring algorithm, which is incorporated into the Spectronaut software tool. Using a
library of synthetic phosphopeptides spiked-in to a yeast phosphoproteome in different ratios we
show that it is on par with the top site localization score for data-dependent acquisition (DDA)
based phosphoproteomics. Single-shot DIA-based phosphoproteomics achieved an order of
magnitude broader dynamic range, higher reproducibility of identification and improved
sensitivity and accuracy of quantification compared to state-of-the-art DDA-based
phosphoproteomics. Importantly, direct DIA without the need of spectral libraries performed
almost on par with analyses using specific project-specific libraries. Moreover, we implemented
and benchmarked an algorithm for globally determining phosphorylation site stoichiometry in
DIA. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the DIA approach by systematically analyzing the
effects of thirty different kinase inhibitors in context of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling
showing that a large proportion of EGF-dependent phospho-regulation is mediated by a specific
set of protein kinases.

INTRODUCTION​ (Brief and focused)
Site-specific protein phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational
modifications (PTMs) as it can rapidly modulate a protein’s function by changing its activity,
subcellular localization, interactions or stability 1​​ . It is a highly dynamic modification that
regulates essentially all cellular signaling networks. Deregulated phospho-signaling is therefore
a hallmark of cancer and many other diseases. Major advances in phosphopeptide enrichment
strategies, instrument performance and computational analysis tools have made mass
spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics the method of choice for the study of protein
phosphorylation on a global scale. Large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics has proven to
be successful in addressing unsolved questions in cell signaling and biomedicine 2–5​
​ . However,
the majority of successful phosphoproteomics studies typically involves days or even weeks of
measurements by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze
few cellular conditions with sufficient depth to identify and pinpoint the functional
phosphorylation sites. Moreover, current tandem mass spectrometric sequencing speed and the
semi-stochastic nature of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) make it challenging for
phosphoproteomics to systematically and reproducibly analyze phosphorylation sites across
large numbers of samples. This limits its application for high-throughput applications such as
drug screening.
With the advent of fast scanning high-resolution tandem mass spectrometers, DIA has
appeared as powerful alternative to DDA in shotgun proteomics 6–8​
​ . In a DIA analysis, all
(phospho)peptides within a predefined mass-to-charge (m/z) window are co-fragmented and the
resulting fragments measured together. This analysis is repeated as the mass spectrometer
goes through the full mass range, which facilitates systematic measurement of all peptide ions
regardless of their intensity and overcomes the precursor selection problem of DDA. DIA
typically provides broader dynamic range, higher peptide identification rates, improved
reproducibility of identification, and accuracy for quantification. However, due to the multiplexed
fragment ion spectra, DIA requires more elaborate data processing algorithms and software
solutions for spectral deconvolution, which typically make use of pre-recorded spectral libraries.
Moreover, apart from the unambiguous identification of the phosphopeptide sequence, the
deconvoluted tandem mass spectra should contain sufficient information to localize
phosphorylation sites with single amino acid resolution 1​​ .

To address these issues, we have developed an optimized label-free quantitative
phosphoproteomics approach combining fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
with site-specific data-independent acquisition (DIA). This approach allowed us to systematically
and reproducibly analyze more than ten thousand phosphorylation sites across hundreds of
samples. We developed and employed algorithms to accurately localize phosphorylation sites in
DIA datasets and determine their fractional stoichiometry on a system-wide scale. We apply this
strategy to identify phosphorylation site targets of ten major protein kinases in the epidermal
growth factor signaling pathway 9​​ .
RESULTS​ (General description of the method followed by its validation)
Comparison of DDA and DIA for large-scale quantitative phosphopeptide analysis
To enable large-scale phosphoproteomics studies with increased depth and throughput, it is
necessary to reduce the amount of input protein, improve workflow reproducibility and decrease
mass spectrometry instrument time usage. With this in mind we optimized a fast and scalable
single-shot analysis workflow based on high-throughput magnetic Ti-IMAC bead enrichment of
phosphopeptides from 200 ug of starting tryptic peptide material (​Figure 1A​). With this
approach we routinely quantify ~7000 phosphopeptides in just 15 min of LC-MS/MS analysis
time with fast 28 Hz Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) 10​
​ scanning method on a Q
Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer 8​​ with overall MS/MS identification rates of more than 50%.
This is close to 500 unique phosphopeptides per minute of gradient time, which is significantly
more identifications than the commonly-used TiO2-based workflow 8​​ .
However, even with the very fast and improved methodology, we seemed to have reached the
limit for data-dependent acquisition (DDA) for phosphoproteomics with current instrumentation.
Conversely, data-independent acquisition (DIA) can in principle overcome this limitation of
sequential DDA by analyzing peptide ions in parallel. This is achieved by co-isolating co-eluting
peptide ions in predefined mass windows, fragmenting them together and analyzing all the
resulting fragment ions simultaneously. However, few attempts have been reported on applying
DIA to large-scale (phospho)proteomics 11–15​
​
. To address this problem we developed a
PTM-specific workflow for peptide-centric DIA that combines the recovery rate of library-based
extraction with high confidence site localization algorithm rivaling the current gold standard
based on DDA.

Initially, we optimized the instrument settings for best DIA performance. Due to the
co-fragmentation of multiple precursors with different charge-states in DIA, it is not possible to
employ the charge-state dependent collision energy (CE) scaling of DDA. To identify the optimal
collision energy settings for DIA, we recorded spectral libraries at four different normalized CE
values and analyzed corresponding DIA runs with CE values fixed at charge-state of two.
Analyzing the DIA files with the different spectral libraries revealed that the best compromise for
maximizing identification of differently charged precursors was to record spectral libraries with
NCE of 28 and analyze subsequent DIA runs with NCE of 25 at charge state 2 (​Supplementary
Figure 1A​). Next, we optimized the overlap between adjacent mass windows in DIA for best
quantification by quantifying precursors in overlapping regions in a DIA setup in which we
systematically shifted the mass windows. From this analysis, we found that setting a fixed
overlap of 1 Da between adjacent mass windows assured optimal quantification of precursors
with m/z values at the edges of isolation windows (​Supplementary Figure 1B​). We also tested
different DIA acquisition methods to find the optimal one for fast phosphoproteomics by
changing scan cycle times using different mass window widths, number of windows and HCD
resolution settings (​Supplementary Figure 1C​). All acquisition methods identified comparable
numbers of phosphopeptides, which in DIA is defined as unique phosphorylated elution group
precursors. However, the best quantitative performance judged by coefficient of variation (CV)
between replica was achieved by the fastest scanning method employing 2 second cycle time
with 48 mass windows of 14 Da widths using 15,000 resolution HCD fragmentation with
maximum injection time of 22 ms (​Supplementary Figure 1D​).
Using this optimized DIA method with 15 min LC gradients, we identified almost three times as
many elution group precursors and twice as many phosphopeptides compared to the number of
DDA peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and phosphopeptides, respectively (​Figure 1B, see
methods section​). In addition, the DIA raw files were also searched with directDIA (dDIA). In
this approach, spectral libraries are generated directly by searching deconvoluted
pseudo-MS/MS spectra from DIA data against a peptide database. For this process, Pulsar, the
search engine in Spectronaut, applies the same search settings as DDA searches in MaxQuant.
This library-independent dDIA strategy also worked well with twofold increase in precursors
matched and 75% increase in phosphopeptides (​Figure 1B​). DIA further showed a significantly
higher overlap of phosphopeptide identifications between replica compared to DDA (​Figure 1C
and 1D​). Importantly, the quantitative reproducibility was better in DIA with correlation
coefficient, R​2​ of 0.93 compared to R​2​ of 0.89 for DDA, even though DIA covered an additional

order of magnitude of absolute precursor intensities (​Figure 1E and Figure 1F​). This is likely
due to the fact that DIA makes more efficient use of the ion beam by sampling more ions in
MS/MS mode compared to DDA throughout the entire LC-MS analysis (​Figure 1G​). Quantifying
the difference reveals an approximate 6-fold higher fragment ion count measured in DIA
compared to DDA mode (​Figure 1H​).
We next assessed the quantification accuracy and precision of the DIA and DDA approaches in
a regulated phosphopeptide sub-population spiked into a complex sample background. For this
purpose, we made use of a mixed species approach in which we diluted phosphopeptides
enriched from yeast at different ratios into a fixed background of HeLa phosphopeptides and
analyzed them by DDA, dDIA and DIA (​Figure 1I​). This strategy allows to assess how the
acquisition methods quantify the expected ratios of the yeast phosphopeptides of 0.25:1, 0.5:1,
1.5:1 and 2:1. As expected, dDIA and DIA were both able to quantify up to twice as many
phosphopeptides as DDA (​Supplementary Figure 1E​). Based on box-plot analysis, all three
methods very accurately estimated the expected ratios on median across all comparisons
(​Figure 1J​). However, the interquartile ranges were significantly smaller for DIA compared to
DDA and generally dropped at the higher loads (2:1) compared to the more dilute sample
(0.25:1). This indicates that phosphopeptides of higher intensity are better quantified as
expected. Conversely, the human phosphopeptides did not show regulation between the
conditions (​Supplementary Figure 1F​).
To better assess quantification precision, we next calculated the mean squared error (MSE) as
the sum of positive bias and variance for each method, which represent the quantification error
in accuracy and precision, respectively (​Figure 1K​). Based on this, DIA yields the highest
precision and highest accuracy at all ratios analyzed. DDA showed lower precision compared to
dDIA at high intensity ratios (2:1), but better precision at low intensity ratios (0.25:1). To test if
the accurate and precise quantification of DIA translated into a better identification of significant
regulation, we used the significance d-score of the SAM test 16​
​ to calculate true-positive-rates
(TPR) and false-positive-rates (FPR) of the regulated phosphopeptides for the DDA and DIA
approaches (​Figure 1L​). Plotting them against each other created a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, in which best performing methods should achieve a TPR of 1 before
increasing their FPR over 0. Focusing on the left part of the ROC curve plot, where the FPR is
lowest, we see that DIA and dDIA shows the steepest TPR increase at all tested ratios
compared to DDA.

DIA-specific phosphorylation site localization algorithm
To compensate for the wider isolation windows applied in DIA, we developed a PTM localization
algorithm for peptide centric analysis utilizing information not available in standard DDA data.
This includes full isotopic patterns for fragment ions and the possibility of generating short
elution chromatograms to correlate with the targeted precursor peak shape. The latter allows for
systematic removal of any interfering fragment ions that one could not account for in DDA.
These two aspects are combined with additional scores based on fragment ion intensities and
mass accuracy into a specific weighted score for each fragment, which is then used to calculate
a specific site localization score (​Supplementary note 1​).
Briefly, during the standard DIA analysis, the algorithm starts out by detecting and classifying all
potential peak groups for a peptide precursor in the library. For each candidate peak group
modified peptides are enumerated into site candidates to represent all possible site
combinations on-the-fly. Using the combined site information for a given peptide, the algorithm
calculates and retains all unique fragment masses, which are then matched to the individual site
candidates, whereby each individual fragment can be annotated as either confirming or refuting
a specific site candidate (​Figure 2A​). A score is calculated for each site candidate using the
individual fragment ion matches incorporating aspects of the feature, the mass accuracy and the
XIC correlation. The final site scores are then calculated by summing all candidate scores that
supported this site and subtracting all fragments that refute the site (​Figure 2B​). The developed
DIA-specific PTM site localization score is finally calculated as a fractional probability score for
each site combination compared in relation to all candidate scores. This approach is equivalent
to the original PTM score site localization algorithm 2​​ and the Andromeda score 17​
​ implemented
in MaxQuant. The DIA-based PTM localization workflow does not require specially generated
spectral libraries and is available in the Spectronaut software tool 7​​ (v. 13.0.190309.20491).
To evaluate the performance of the PTM site localization algorithm and establish appropriate
probability score cutoff values for accurate site localization, we initially tested it on a library of
synthetic phosphopeptides with known site localization. This library consisted of two hundred
human tryptic phosphopeptides frequently observed in large-scale phosphoproteomics
experiments. They were spiked into a stable background of tryptic yeast phosphoproteome
sample in different concentrations (1x, 10x, 100x, 1000x) and measured in triplicates using DDA
and DIA (​Figure 2C​). The DDA raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant 18​
​ using Phosphorylation
(STY) as the only variable modification. The resulting phosphopeptide identifications were used
to build a spectral library, which was then searched in peptide centric mode against the

corresponding DIA raw files using Spectronaut with the PTM site localization algorithm
implemented.
From the DDA files, we on average correctly localized 93.6 phosphorylation sites from singly
phosphorylated peptides with 1.4% error rate on wrongly assigned sites (​Figure 2D​). We
required at least 0.75 localization probability (Class I sites) as in previous analyses 2​​ , which in
this case equates to an estimated FDR of 1.5%. Applying the same score cutoff of 0.75 for the
DIA dataset results in correct identification and localization of 136.2 phosphorylation sites on
average with 1.7% error rate of incorrectly assigned sites, indicating that site localization FDR at
this cutoff value is comparable to that of DDA analyzed with MaxQuant but achieving higher site
coverage in DIA. The site localization FDR when analyzing multiply phosphorylated peptides
were somewhat higher but comparable between DDA and DIA with error rates of 12.4% and
10.8% respectively but the underlying statistics were limited due to fewer candidates. Notably, in
opposition to DDA for which the number of synthetic phosphopeptide sites identified is
significantly hampered at low dilutions, DIA maintained a relatively high identification rate across
all dilutions, indicating that DIA outperformed DDA in sensitivity and dynamic range (​Figure 2E​).
We also analyzed the DIA dataset of the synthetic phosphopeptides using dDIA without a
spectral library and found that in this case we needed to apply a higher score probability cutoff
of 0.99 to achieve error rates comparable to library-based DIA and DDA (​Supplementary
Figure 2​). However even with this stringent cutoff, dDIA on average correctly identified and
localized 128.8 phosphorylation sites, which was one-third more than DDA.
Technical comparison of DDA and DIA in a biologically relevant setting
We next evaluated if the increased coverage of localized phosphopeptides in DIA over DDA
translates into an advantage in a cell signaling study. For this purpose, we used EGF-stimulated
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells treated with different MEK kinase inhibitors as a model
system (​Figure 3A​). Briefly, cells were pretreated for 30 minutes with 0.5uM or 5uM of
Cobimetinib, or 0.5uM or 5uM of PD-032591 prior to 10 minutes EGF stimulation, 10 minutes
EGF only or untreated cells as a control. All conditions were prepared as biological triplicates,
phosphopeptides from 200 ug of whole cell tryptic digests were enriched by Ti-IMAC and
analyzed with 15 minute gradients by DDA and DIA.
For DIA, we tested the effect of using different spectral libraries and dDIA. We recorded a
project-specific spectral library consisting of ~40,000 phosphorylation sites by deep
phosphoproteome profiling 19​
​ . We fractionated the same EGF-stimulated cells using massive

offline high-pH reversed phase chromatography based fractionation combined with DDA
analysis of individual fractions measured on the same 15 minute online LC-MS gradient as for
the DIA analyses, which should be an ideal reference dataset (​Supplementary Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure 3B​). As an alternative to this, we created an even larger
community-based spectral library of ~50,000 phosphorylation sites by combining two previous
large-scale HeLa (phospho)proteome studies 20,21​
​
(​Supplementary Figure 3C​).
To facilitate efficient bioinformatics analysis of phosphoproteomics data, MaxQuant generates a
site-level output table for each variable PTM that allows site-level statistical analysis. To
compare DIA Spectronaut data to DDA MaxQuant data on a biological level, we developed a
Perseus plugin that can convert a normal Spectronaut report into a site-level report
(​Supplementary Note 1​). The plugin features a graphical interface and allows generation of
MaxQuant-like site-level, PTM-localized peptide-level and “modification specific” peptide-level
output.
With comparable data formats for both DDA and DIA, we first looked at the numbers of
identified phosphopeptides and localized phosphorylation sites for each of the different
methods, with more than ten thousand sites identified in all (​Figure 3B​). As expected, DDA with
20,056 phosphopeptides covering 12,454 sites identified less sites than DIA with project-specific
spectral library with 29,186 phosphopeptides covering 13,934 sites. Conversely, the larger
community-based library only identified 19,913 phosphopeptides and 11,385 sites, which is
comparable to DDA. However, combining the two spectral libraries provides the best coverage
with 30,912 phosphopeptides and 14,835 sites. Interestingly, dDIA yields similar number of
phosphopeptides and sites as DDA and DIA with the community library.
To assess the biological effect of the different kinase inhibitor treatments on cellular
phospho-signaling, we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test to identify
significantly regulated sites. For this test, we only used phosphorylation site ratios quantified in
all three biological replicates of at least one condition. Due to its lower precision and
phosphopeptide coverage, DDA yielded 532 significantly regulated phosphorylation sites,
whereas all DIA methods identified nearly twice the number of regulated sites (​Figure 3B​).
Next, we wanted to assess if and to what degree the regulated sites identified by DDA and DIA
provided biological insights into EGF-dependent phospho-signaling in context of MEK inhibition
as expected. To do this, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the DIA
significant sites (​Figure 3C​) and the DDA significant sites (​Figure 3D​), which revealed an
overall similar pattern of regulation between the different conditions. The pattern was the same

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/657858; this version posted June 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

for the other DIA methods (​Supplementary Figure 3D​). Linear sequence motif analysis of the
EGF-upregulated phosphorylation sites that were largely unaffected by the kinase inhibitor
treatment revealed that both DDA and DIA could correctly identify the EGF-dependent but
MEK-independent AKT kinase substrate motif RxRxx[s/t]. Reassuringly, the ERK1/2 kinase
substrate motif Px[s/t]P was significantly enriched among the MEK-dependent sites as expected
(​Figure 3E​). This analysis demonstrated that DIA and DDA identified the same biology on
localized phosphosite-level - AKT and ERK activation as the major signaling axes downstream
of EGF - recapitulating known EGF receptor signaling as expected.
Global analysis of fractional phosphorylation site stoichiometry from DIA data
Besides relative quantification of phosphorylation sites, it is valuable to determine their
occupancy or absolute stoichiometry. A high fractional stoichiometry combined with dynamic
regulation is a strong indication that the site is functional in the cellular context studied 1​​ . It is
possible to determine the absolute occupancy or fractional stoichiometry of phosphorylation
sites on a large scale by using ratios observed in both the phosphopeptide, its
non-phosphorylated counterpart peptide and the respective protein between treatment
conditions from SILAC data 22​
​ and TMT-multiplexed data 23,24​
​
.
Based on our previous findings 24​
​ , we reasoned that the high quantitative accuracy and the
completeness of the DIA phosphoproteomics dataset should allow the extraction of
stoichiometry from multiple conditions at the same time. We adapted a recently developed 3D
multiple regression model (3DMM)-based approach based on TMT data to label-free DIA. The
3DMM approach integrates information of several experimental conditions and replicates into
one stoichiometry model, which uses phosphopeptide-, non-phosphorylated peptide- and
corresponding protein-intensities from any multiplexed quantification method. However even for
DIA, data quantification of individual sites are not complete when analyzing many experimental
conditions. To overcome this issue and retain as much quantitative information as possible, we
combined peptide information based on the assumption of linear behavior between equally
(non-)regulated peptides, which allowed us to extrapolate peptide intensities to fill in missing
values. We implemented both the linear modeling approach and stoichiometry calculation into
our Perseus plugin, which thus allows users without prior scripting experience to calculate PTM
occupancies from LFQ data (​Supplementary Note 1​).
To benchmark the performance of the label-free 3DMM stoichiometry approach, we prepared a
mixed species sample with fixed phosphopeptide stoichiometries (​Figure 4A​). A

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/657858; this version posted June 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

phosphopeptide-enriched tryptic yeast digest was split in two equal parts and one half was
de​phosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase. Mixing together phosphorylated and
non-phosphorylated yeast peptides in fixed ratios into a HeLa phosphopeptide background
yielded conditions of 1%, 10%, 50%, 90% and 99% phosphorylation site stoichiometry. Each
sample was analyzed by DDA and DIA using 15 min LC-MS/MS. Boxplot analysis of the
calculated stoichiometry values revealed that both DDA and DIA estimated the expected ratios
closely on median across all comparisons. However, the interquartile ranges were significantly
smaller for DIA compared to DDA especially at high stoichiometry values, indicating that higher
intensity phosphopeptides are better quantified by DIA as expected (​Figure 4B​). To compare
the quantification error in terms of accuracy and precision for the 3DMM data, we compared the
mean squared errors (MSE) presenting the sum of positive bias and variance for the two
methods, respectively, as described above. Based on this, DIA yields the highest precision and
highest accuracy at all stoichiometry levels analyzed with the general trend that precision is
lowest for highest values, whereas accuracy is more comparable across conditions (​Figure 4C​).
Importantly, DIA was able to generate more than twice as many occupancy values
(​Supplementary Figure 4A​), presumably due to its better quantification and higher
phosphopeptide coverage (​Supplementary Figure 4B​).
Our data indicates that DIA based stoichiometry estimation is possible with reasonable accuracy
and we therefore applied it to the EGF-stimulated and kinase-inhibitor treated RPE1 cell
phosphoproteome DIA dataset described above. Heatmap representation of the unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of ANOVA significant phosphorylation site stoichiometries reflected the
cellular conditions well with generally highest stoichiometry in EGF-stimulated samples and
lowest in kinase inhibitor treated (​Supplementary Figure 4A​). This set of dynamic
phosphorylation sites with high stoichiometry values was enriched in proteins associated with
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling according to the Reactome Pathway Database 25​
​ . To
pinpoint likely functional sites to prioritize for follow-up experiments, the global phosphorylation
site stoichiometry measurements can be integrated with the corresponding site fold-changes
and visualized as an extra layer of information in a Volcano plot exemplified by the comparison
of EGF versus control samples (​Figure 4D​). Enrichment analysis among the significantly
EGF-regulated site occupancies reveal strong overrepresentation of signaling by receptor
tyrosine kinases and MAPK signaling pathways validating the known biology of the experiments
(​Supplementary Figure 4B​).

Large-scale DIA phosphoproteomics of hundreds of cell perturbations using a kinase
inhibitor panel
To demonstrate the power and scalability of the rapid DIA-based site-specific
phosphoproteomics workflow developed here, we applied it to identify phosphorylation site
targets of the ten major protein kinases in the epidermal growth factor signaling pathway using a
panel of thirty kinase inhibitors (​Figure 5A​). Briefly, EGF-stimulated RPE1 cells were pretreated
with an inhibitor in two different concentrations (0.1uM and 1uM) in biological triplicates and
each of the 186 samples was analyzed by 15 min LC-MS/MS using DIA. We quantified ~20,000
phosphopeptides across the 62 conditions in triplicates and performed ANOVA significance
analysis on the log-transformed normalized intensities, which identified 1275 phosphorylation
sites that were regulated in at least one condition. We visualized the regulated sites as a
function of treatment by hierarchical clustering of the averaged phosphorylation site intensities
per replica, which grouped likely substrates and targets according to the kinase inhibited
(​Figure 5B​). From this analysis it is evident that EGF receptor inhibition (EGFRi) by all
compounds worked well as it clusters with the untreated control samples. To verify that the
inhibitors targeted the expected kinases, we performed a kinase motif enrichment analysis
among each of the down-regulated phosphorylation site clusters for the individual kinase
classes using a Fisher exact test. The overrepresented kinase motifs generally matched the
expected kinase or their main established downstream kinase substrates (​Figure 5C​). For
example, MEK inhibition leads to strong overrepresentation of ERK1/2 motif as expected, GSK3
inhibition down-regulates sites that conform to the known GSK3 motif, and mTOR inhibition
down-regulated sites with the known mTOR substrate motif as well as substrate sites of its main
downstream kinase p70S6K. To further validate the specificity of the kinase inhibitors we
analyzed known substrates of the individual kinases and found good reproducibility in our
dataset (​Figure 5D​).

DISCUSSION​ (Brief and focused)
Here we optimized a streamlined phosphoproteomics workflow based on data-independent
acquisition (DIA) and developed a PTM localization site algorithm as part of the DIA
computational pipeline, which we benchmarked against state-of-the-art DDA-based
phosphoproteomics. By analyzing a library of synthetic phosphopeptides, controlled
mixed-species phosphoproteomes with technical replication and EGF-stimulated cells in
combination with kinase inhibitors with biological replication, we show the robustness,
specificity, and high quality of the DIA-based phosphoproteomes. Quantitatively we demonstrate
that we can achieve significant greater depth than any previous DIA-based phosphoproteome
reported. Moreover, to our knowledge, we present the first systematic analysis of kinase
inhibitor characterization by phosphoproteomics using label-free quantification.
More generally, the methodological approach we have developed represents a strategy to
quantitatively profile hundreds of phopshoproteomes in a few days from low amount of starting
material. While it has been shown previously that sensitive phosphoproteomics starting from
200 ug or less 26​
​ is feasible, this study represents an important advancement in that we use
sensitive phosphoproteomics to analyze cellular signaling networks much faster and with
greater depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stoichiometry calculation using LFQ is
principally feasible, which has the potential to help in identifying functionally relevant
phosphorylation sites in the future.
There are still limitations to the optimal DIA-based phosphoproteomics workflow. We achieve
the best coverage and quantification when using tailor-made project specific spectral library for
the DIA analyses, but this requires some effort and may not always be possible. However,
predicting peptide retention time and MS/MS spectra 27,28​

might circumvent the necessity of
recording spectral libraries for DIA in future. Unfortunately, the current prediction tools are not
yet developed for phosphoproteomics.
Alternatively, library-free approaches such as dDIA look very promising for the future. Even
though it takes a significant hit in the number of identified phosphopeptides, it is much easier to
implement. Importantly, dDIA also may overcome issues with standard DIA, where rare or low
abundant phosphorylation sites may get diluted out during library generation. Moreover, we
believe that there is still room for improvements in the mass spectrometric technology. Although
we show that DIA analyzes about 6-fold more ions in MS/MS mode than DDA, we estimate that
by using 48 DIA-windows we are still maximally sampling a few percent of the ion beam at best.

Mass spectrometers with higher duty cycles such as the timsTOF pro 29​
​ may be an even better
fit for DIA-based phosphoproteomics in the future. Looking forward, the methodological and
computational framework outlined here may be applicable to a clinical setting for example in
cancer, where sensitive phosphoproteomics profiling of individual patient tumors may aid
precision medicine in the future.

ONLINE METHODS
(all technical details necessary for the independent reproduction of the methodology, without
referring to a chain of bibliographical references)
Human cell culture and lysis
Human epithelial cervix carcinoma HeLa cells (female) and human retinal pigment epithelial
RPE1 cells (female) immortalized with hTERT were purchased from ATCC and cultured in
DMEM (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Invitrogen),
100U/mL penicillin (Gibco, Invitrogen), 100ug/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were harvested at approximately 80% confluency by
washing twice with PBS and (Gibco, Invitrogen) and subsequently adding boiling GdmCl lysis
buffer (6M guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mM
chloroacetamide, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5 directly to the plate. Cells were collected by scraping the
plate and boiled for 10min at 95°C followed by micro tip sonication.
Yeast cell culture and lysis
BY4742 wild-type cells were grown in YEPD medium (2% bacto peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2%
dextrose/glucose; sterile-filtered before use) at 30°C and 200 rpm rotation in overnight culture.
Day culture was inoculated at OD_600 of 0.1 and harvest hours later when the OD_600
surpassed ~0.8. Yeast cells were spun down (4000g 5min) and washed with ice cold PBS. The
pellet was resuspended in yeast lysis buffer (20ml per 1l OD_600 1; 75mM Tris pH8, 75mM
NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1 complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablet per 10ml, 5 mM sodium
fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM β-glycerol phosphate) and dropped in droplets out
of pipette into liquid nitrogen. Frozen droplets were ground in a MM400 ball mill (Retsch) for 3
min at 25 Hz. Frozen yeast powder was then mixed with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% SDS and
incubated rolling at 4°C until thawed. Yeast lysate was spun down (16,000rpm 4°C 5min). The
supernatant was transferred into -80°C acetone to a final acetone concentration of 80% v/v and
incubated at -20°C for 2h. Precipitated proteins were spun down and resuspended in GdmCl
lysis buffer (6M guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mM
chloroacetamide, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1 complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablet per
10ml, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM β-glycerol phosphate). Protein

pellets were resuspended by sonication (Sonics & Materials, VCX 130; 1s on, 1s off, 80%
amplitude) and boiled for 10min at 95°C.
Protein digestion
Protein concentration was estimated by BCA assay (Pierce) and the lysates were digested with
Lys-C (Wako) in an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 1h followed by a threefold dilution
with 25mM Tris, pH 8.5 to 2M GdmCl and further digested overnight with trypsin (Sigma Aldrich)
1:100 (w:w). Protease activity was quenched by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a
final concentration of approximately 1% and the resulting peptide mixture was concentrated
using reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). Peptides were eluted off the Sep-Pak
with 2mL 40% acetonitrile(ACN) followed by 2mL 60% ACN. The ACN was removed by vacuum
centrifugation at 60°C and the final concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at
280 nm on a NanoDrop 2000C, Thermo Scientific).
Phosphopeptide enrichment
200ug of peptides were enriched for phosphopeptides using Ti-IMAC magnetic beads (Resyn
Biosciences). Enrichments were carried out in protein LoBind 96-well plates (Eppendorf). The
plates were mixed using 1300 rpm (Heidolph Titramax 1000, #544-12200-00) and separated in
the 96-well plate using a magnetic stand (Thermo Scientific, # AM10027). Ti-IMAC beads were
equilibrated twice in 200 µl 70% Ethanol followed by once in 100 µl 1% Ammonia and three
times in loading buffer (80% acetonitrile, 1M glycolic acid, 5% TFA). 200 µg peptide mixture was
mixed with equal amount of loading buffer and 500 µg Ti-IMAC beads (25 µl) were added and
the solution was mixed for 20min. The beads were separated on a magnetic stand for 20s and
the supernatant was removed using gel-loader tip connected to vacuum. 200 µl of loading buffer
was added and beads were mixed for 2min followed by two washes with wash buffer 1 (80%
acetonitrile, 1% TFA) and once with wash buffer 2 (10% acetonitrile, 0.2% TFA).
Phosphopeptides were eluted in three rounds with 80 µl 1% Ammonia for 20 min. Transfer the
supernatant to a clean plate and acidify with TFA. Speedvac solution and desalt using C18
StageTips and store at 4°C until MS analysis.
Preparation of spectral libraries
RPE1 cells were stimulated with 125 ng/mL EGF (Chromotek) for 3 and 10 min followed by lysis
and digestion as described before. Ultimate 3000 ultra-high performance liguid chromatography

(UHPLC) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), in conjunction with high-pH reversed-phase
chromatography, was used to separate and fractionate tryptic peptides. Peptides were
separated using a high-pH-compatible 250 3 4.6 mm C18 Waters BEH X-Bridge peptide
separation technology (PST) 3.6 mM or Phenomenex Cell Reports 22, 2784–2796, March 6,
2018 2793 Kinetex Evo 2.6 mM (Torrance, CA USA) column with identical dimensions. Basic
conditions were achieved by running buffer C (50 mM ammonium hydroxide) constantly at 10%
(100 mL/min, 2.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate final). A 60 min fractionation and collection
gradient was achieved using buffer A (Milli-Q H2O) and buffer B (acetonitrile), and fractions
were collected. From 3mg, 10 fractions were collected, while 10 mg was fractionated and
collected in 46 fractions without any concatenation. Running at a constant 1 mL/min, the
gradient was increased from 5% to 25% buffer B in 50 min and further increased to 70% buffer
B in 5 min, where it was held for another 5 min. At this point, the fraction collection was stopped.
Each fraction was dried in a speedvac and reconstituted in phopsho loading buffer and
phosphopeptides were enriched as described above. Each fraction was analyzed individually
with LC-MS/MS settings as described below.
Stoichiometry
Phosphopeptides enriched from yeast and HeLa cells as described above were each split
50:50. One half was dephosphorylated using rAPid alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich; 1ul
per 2mg protein starting material) at 37°C 750rpm shaking overnight, while the other half was
mock treated using water. Both samples were incubated for 10min at 85°C to inactivate the
phosphatase, and then purified on C18 StageTips 30​
​ . Yeast phosphopeptides were mixed at
0.1%, 1%, 10%, 50%, 90%, 99% and 99.9% into dephosphorylated peptides at 99.9%, 99%,
90%, 50%, 10%, 1% and 0.1%, with the total amount of peptides per condition corresponding to
Ti-IMAC enrichment from 200ug yeast starting material. Mixtures were then added into a 1:1
HeLa mixture of phosphopeptides and dephosphorylated peptides, each corresponding to a
total amount of peptides per condition corresponding to Ti-IMAC enrichment from 100ug HeLa
starting material. Samples were then measured with the DDA and optimized DIA method as
described below.
Synthetic phosphopeptide experiment
Synthetic phosphopeptides were purchased from JPT (SpikeMix PTM-kit 52 1001098; SpikeMix
PTM-kit 54 1001100) and Sigma-Aldrich (MS PhosphoMix 1 Light MSP1L, MS PhosphoMix 2

Light MSP2L, MS PhosphoMix 3 Light MSP3L) and resuspended according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Synthetic phosphopeptides and yeast phosphopeptides as
described above were mixed in different ratios to mimic complex phosphopeptide mixtures
(​Supplementary Table 1​). Samples were measured in DIA and DDA mode in technical
triplicates each. For DIA measurement, the optimized method described below with the
LC-gradient scaled to 35min was used. For DDA measurement, the same LC gradient was
measured with MS1 resolution 60,000, MS1 AGC target 3e6, MS1 max IT 45ms, scan range
350-1400 m/z, MS2 resolution 30,000, MS2 AGC target 1e5, MS2 max IT 54ms, MS2 top6,
MS2 isolation window 1.3 m/z, MS2 scan range 200-2000 m/z, MS2 NCE 28% and MS2
dynamic exclusion 30sec. DIA data was searched using a spectral library generated from the
DDA files, searched with MaxQuant and generated by Spectronaut as described below.

Nanoflow LC-MS/MS
The peptides concentrated in a speedvac and volume were adjusted to 7 μl in loading buffer
(5% ACN and 0.1% TFA) prior to autosampling. An in-house packed 15 cm, 75 μm ID capillary
column with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) was used. An
EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) was and the column
temperature was maintained at 40 °C using an integrated column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation,
Biberach, Germany) interfaced online with the mass spectrometer. Formic acid (FA) 0.1% was
used to buffer the pH in the two running buffers used. The total gradient time was 19 min and
went from 8 to 24% acetonitrile (ACN) in 12.5 min, followed by 2.5 min to 36%. This was
followed by a washout by a 1/2 min increase to 64% ACN, which was kept for 3.5 min. Flow rate
was kept at 350 nL/min. Re-equilibration was done in parallel with sample pickup and prior to
loading with a minimum requirement of 1 μL of 0.1% FA buffer at a pressure of 800 bar.
Spray voltage was set to 2 kV, funnel RF level at 40, and heated capillary at 275 °C. For DDA
experiments full MS resolutions were set to 60,000 at m/z 200 and full MS AGC target was 3E6
with an IT of 25 ms. Mass range was set to 350−1400. AGC target value for fragment spectra
was set at 1E5 with a resolution of 15,000 and injection times of 22ms and Top12. Intensity
threshold was kept at 2E5. Isolation width was set at 1.3 m/z and a fixed first mass of 100 m/z
was used. Normalized collision energy was set at 28%. For DIA experiments full MS resolutions
were set to 120,000 at m/z 200 and full MS AGC target was 3E6 with an IT of 45 ms. Mass
range was set to 350−1400. AGC target value for fragment spectra was set at 3E6. 48 windows

of 14 Da were used with an overlap of 1 Da. Resolution was set to 15,000 and IT to 22
ms.Normalized collision energy was set at 25%. All data were acquired in profile mode using
positive polarity and peptide match was set to off, and isotope exclusion was on.
Raw data processing
DDA files were processed using MaxQuant (1.6.5.0) with default settings. Carbamidomethyl (C)
was set as fixed modifications. Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), Phospho (STY),
Deamidation (NQ) and Gln->pyro-Glu were set as variable modifications. Reference FASTA
files for human and ​S. cerevisiae​ were downloaded from Uniprot on 15th of March 2018.
Spectral libraries were built from MaxQuant DDA search results using Spectronaut
Professional+ x64 (13.0.190309.20491) 7​​ with default settings, but “Best N Fragments per
Peptide Max” set to 25 instead of 6. The yeast phosphopeptide library was generated from
yeast phosphopeptides fractionated into 12 and 46 fractions. We used an Ultimate 3000 HPLC
system (Dionex) with a Waters Acquity CSH C18 1.7 µm 1x150 mm column on operating at a
flow rate of 30 µl/min with two buffer lines as previously described 21​
​ .
DIA files were processed using Spectronaut with default settings, with “PTM localization”
activated and probability cutoff set to 0 (for peptide-level analysis of dilution benchmark) or 0.75,
“Data filtering” set to “Qvalue” and “Normalization Strategy” set to “Local Normalization”. Unless
otherwise stated, experiments containing yeast peptides were searched using the yeast
phosphopeptide library, those containing human peptides using the human phosphopeptide
library, and those containing both with both. For the DIA stoichiometry benchmark (​Figure
4A-C​), DIA files were additionally searched with a library generated from the DDA runs of the
same experiment in order to have non-phospho peptides represented in the library as well. The
synthetic phosphopeptide benchmark (​Figure 2​) was searched with a library generated from the
DDA runs of the same experiment.
Direct DIA search was performed in Spectronaut using default settings with the same PTMs as
defined in MaxQuant DDA searches, “Data filtering” set to “Qvalue” and “Normalization
Strategy” set to “Local Normalization”.
Transformation of the Spectronaut normal report and calculation of stoichiometry values was
performed using a custom coded plugin “Peptide Collapse” in Perseus (1.6.5.0). The plugin was
created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (15.6.3) and requires Perseus and R (minimum
version 3.6.0) to run. Detailed information on how to install and use the plugin and the
calculations it performs are listed in ​Supplementary Note 1​.

Bioinformatics analysis
Most of the data analysis was performed using custom scripts in R (64bit version 3.6.0) with
packages data.table (1.12.2), bit64 (0.9-7), doParallel (1.0.14), stringr (1.4.0), ggplot2 (3.1.1),
qplot (3.0.1.1), limma (3.40.0), samr (3.0), magrittr (1.5), scales (1.0.0), XML (3.98-1.19),
PerseusR (0.3.4), Biostrings (2.52.0) and MASS (7.3-51.4). ANOVA testing was performed in
Perseus (1.6.5.0) and KEGG/reactome term enrichment was performed using the STRING app
(1.4.2) in Cytoscape (3.7.0).
For the dilution benchmark experiment (​Figure 1I-L​), Spectronaut reports were transformed into
“modification specific peptide”-like reports using the plugin peptide collapse in Perseus, with
EG.PTMAssayProbability as grouping column, localization cutoff 0 and same variable PTMs as
listed above. For the stoichiometry benchmark experiment (​Figure 4A-C​) and the kinase
inhibitor stoichiometry experiment (​Figure 4D​), stoichiometry values on “target PTM
peptide-level” were calculated for both DDA and DIA data using the plugin peptide collapse in
Perseus, with grouping columns “Modified sequence” and “EG.PTMLocalizationProbabilities”,
respectively. Localization cutoff was set to 0.75 for both and same variable PTMs as listed
above.
For the LFQ dilution and stoichiometry benchmark experiment, Spectronaut intensities were
“de-normalized” by dividing reported intensity values by their normalization factors. For the
stoichiometry benchmark experiment, DDA and DIA intensities were then quantile-normalized.
Boxplots were created with boxes marking the first and third quartile, a dash the median, and
whiskers the minimum/maximum value within 1.5 interquartile range. Outliers are not displayed.
SAM testing was performed using default settings (s0 =0.1, FDR = 0.20). ANOVA testing of
stoichiometry values was performed using s0 = 0.01 and FDR = 0.20. Enrichment of
KEGG/reactome terms was performed in the Cytoscape STRING app using default settings.
Code availability
Custom R code for the data analysis and the Perseus plugin “Peptide Collapse” are available
upon request.

Supplementary Note 1: Perseus plugin peptide collapse. This is a schematic of the data processing steps of the Perseus plugin “Peptide
Collapse”. The main purpose of the plugin is to combine precursor quantifications into consensus PTM sites or peptides. This should allow more
robust statistical analysis, especially with missing values present in the data. Precursor collapse levels mimic the MaxQuant site, evidence (=
Modified sequence) and modification-specific-peptides output tables.

Localization probabilities:

R

Extract from…
SN EG.PTMAssayProbability (= assay confidence)
SN EG.PTMlocalizationProbabilities (= discovery confidence)
MQ “… Probabilities” (from evidence.txt; e.g. “Phospho (STY) Probabilities”)
- or - Ignore localization probabilities

Precursor collapse:
PTM peptide-level
localized
non-localized

PTM site-level
e.g. TP53_S15_M1

e.g. S(ph)QETFS(ph)DLWK

e.g. SQETFSDLWK_2(ph)
