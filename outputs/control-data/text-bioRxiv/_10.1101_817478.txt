Abstract
Active vision is a fundamental process by which primates gather information about the

3

external world. Multiple brain regions have been studied in the context of simple active vision

4

tasks in which a visual target’s appearance is temporally separated from saccade execution.

5

Most neurons have tight spatial registration between visual and saccadic signals, and in areas

6

such as prefrontal cortex (PFC) some neurons show persistent delay activity that links visual

7

and motor epochs and has been proposed as a basis for spatial working memory. Many PFC

8

neurons also show rich dynamics, which have been attributed to alternative working memory

9

codes and the representation of other task variables. Our study investigated the transition

10

between processing a visual stimulus and generating an eye movement in populations of PFC

11

neurons in macaque monkeys performing a memory guided saccade task. We found that

12

neurons in two subregions of PFC, the frontal eye fields (FEF) and area 8Ar, differed in their

13

dynamics and spatial response profiles. These dynamics could be attributed largely to shifts in

14

the spatial profile of visual and motor responses in individual neurons. This led to visual and

15

motor codes for particular spatial locations that were instantiated by different mixtures of

16

neurons, which could be important in PFC’s flexible role in multiple sensory, cognitive, and

17

motor tasks.

New and Noteworthy

20

A central question in neuroscience is how the brain transitions from sensory representations to

21

motor outputs. The prefrontal cortex contains neurons that have long been implicated as

22

important in this transition and in working memory. We found evidence for rich and diverse

23

tuning in these neurons, that was often spatially misaligned between visual and saccadic

24

responses. This feature may play an important role in flexible working memory capabilities.

Introduction

29

The process of gathering information about the external world and acting on it

30

necessitates sensorimotor integration and is crucial for survival and adaptation to the

31

environment. In a simple idealized organism, visual space could be directly mapped onto motor

32

responses. This type of architecture would be well suited to direct orienting responses in a

33

hardwired fashion, where a stimulus and resulting movement need to be processed and

34

generated rapidly. Within the oculomotor domain, one example of a behavior that could be

35

accomplished by such a direct mapping is the generation of a rapid, ballistic eye movement

36

(saccade) to a visual stimulus. Neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain region tightly

37

coupled to the brain stem circuits that move the eyes, have overlapping visual and movement-

38

related activity (Wurtz & Goldberg 1972). Such a tight alignment might be ideal for the rapid

39

translation of perception to action, and is particularly important in cognitive functions such as

40

attention that involve a tight interaction between visual and saccadic maps (Krauzlis et al 2013).

41

However, in many instances, stimuli must be represented first and acted on later with one of

42

several motor output modalities in the context of different cognitive constraints. The means by

43

which such flexible sensorimotor behavior is achieved is an important mystery in neuroscience.

44

Sensorimotor signals have been extensively studied in the context of eye movements,

45

which are a critical part of primate behavior but also have the advantage of high repeatability

46

and a limited number of degrees of freedom. In particular, tasks in which the onset of the visual

47

stimulus and the eye movement are temporally separated (such as the memory-guided

48

saccade, or MGS) have been used to study the transformation from perception to action.

49

Neurons in oculomotor regions of the cortex typically do not respond exclusively to a visual

50

stimulus or an eye movement. Instead, they demonstrate a wide variety of activity profiles

51

relating to their visuomotor response properties and the timing and duration of their activity. Two

52

prefrontal cortical regions which contain neurons with these diverse response properties are the

53

frontal eye fields (FEF) and the pre-arcuate gyrus (Bullock et al 2017, Kiani et al 2015, Preuss &

54

Goldman-Rakic 1991, Schall et al 1995). In both regions, neurons respond to visual stimuli, eye

55

movements, or both in varying degrees (Boch & Goldberg 1989, Bruce & Goldberg 1985,

56

Funahashi et al 1991). Additionally, some neurons fire transient bursts often aligned to stimulus

57

or saccade onset, while others maintain their activity throughout the period between the visual

58

stimulus and saccade (Funahashi et al 1989, Funahashi et al 1990, Fuster & Alexander 1971).

59

Activity that is elevated and sustained during the entire delay epoch (the period of time after the

60

spatial location is stored in memory but before it must be retrieved), referred to as persistent

61

activity, has been proposed to underlie spatial working memory (Goldman-Rakic 1995).

62

However, while some neurons maintain relatively constant activity in the delay period, many

63

others exhibit changes over time such as ramping up or down or shifts in preference. This has

64

led to ongoing debate about the nature of neural signals related to working memory (for review,

65

see Constantinidis et al (2018) and Lundqvist et al (2018)) and also provides insight into the

66

transition between visual and motor signals.

67

The predominant observation of FEF neurons has been of alignment between sensory

68

and motor responses in representing the contralateral visual field (Bruce & Goldberg 1985),

69

similar to SC. However, a small subset of FEF neurons have ipsilateral receptive fields (Crapse

70

& Sommer 2009, Schall 1991) and can even show misalignment between their delay period and

71

peri-saccadic tuning (Lawrence et al 2005). In 8Ar, there are also neurons with ipsilateral

72

receptive fields (Mikami et al 1982, Suzuki & Azuma 1983) and bilateral responses (Bullock et al

73

2017). Some PFC neurons change their tuning during the delay epoch (Parthasarathy et al

74

2017, Spaak et al 2017), which has led some to propose alternatives to the persistent activity

75

model of working memory, such as “activity silent” mechanisms (Stokes 2015), or oscillatory

76

dynamics (Lundqvist et al 2016). Setting aside the question of how working memory is stored,

77

there is abundant evidence that neurons in PFC represent a myriad of perceptual and task-

78

related variables, such as reward (Leon & Shadlen 1999, Watanabe 1996), abstract rules

79

(Wallis et al 2001), time during the delay (Jun et al 2010, Spaak et al 2017), previous trial

80

outcome (Donahue & Lee 2015), and stimulus shape and color (Riley et al 2017). A

81

misalignment of visual and eye movement signals could be the consequence of, and potentially

82

beneficial for, a flexible coding architecture in which multiple perceptual inputs (e.g., visual or

83

auditory) are associated with multiple motor outputs (e.g., a saccade or a reach). In this case,

84

the dynamics of activity during the delay period may not solely represent the evolution of a

85

working memory signal, but also the transition between two different representations in the

86

neuronal population. We wondered if and how the visual and saccadic signals align in FEF and

87

8Ar, and whether there were systematic rules by which neurons shifted their response profiles.

88

To answer these questions, we recorded from groups of 8Ar and FEF neurons in

89

macaque monkeys performing a memory guided saccade task. The reliable timing of the task

90

and saccadic response allowed us to isolate visual and motor signals. We first characterized the

91

receptive field structure of 8Ar neurons in response to a briefly flashed visual stimulus as well as

92

the motor response field around the time of the saccade. Importantly, we used a dense mapping

93

of space to achieve a high-resolution spatial response profile. We found a remarkable amount of

94

diversity, both spatially and temporally, in the response properties of 8Ar neurons. A key pattern

95

in this diversity was spatial and temporal opponency – many neurons were suppressed at

96

spatial locations opposite their preferred response, and their preferences shifted over time from

97

shortly after stimulus onset to the time of the saccade, sometimes to the opposite hemifield. To

98

quantitatively assess at the population level the observations that we made in individual

99

neurons, we measured the ability to decode the target location in 8Ar and FEF neurons. We

100

found that the diverse response properties observed in 8Ar are less prominent in FEF, and that

101

the population code in 8Ar is more dynamic, meaning that the visual and motor codes were less

102

aligned. Taken together, our results are consistent with a neural circuit structure in which the

103

visual and saccadic representations are gradually segregated with increasing distance from the

104

motor output. This may aid in 8Ar playing a flexible role in various types of sensorimotor

105

behavior and cognitive states, associating a variety of sensory inputs with potential motor

106

outputs.

Surgical Preparation. A 96-electrode “Utah” Array (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT)

111

was implanted into two adult, male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in dorsolateral prefrontal

112

cortex using sterile surgical techniques under isoflurane anesthesia. The array was implanted in

113

right 8Ar for Monkey Pe and left 8Ar for Monkey Wa, on the pre-arcuate gyrus immediately

114

anterior to the arcuate sulcus and medial to the principal sulcus (Figure 1A). For FEF

115

recordings, two adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; monkeys Ro and Wi) were

116

surgically implanted with FEF recording chambers (aimed for the anterior bank of the arcuate

117

sulcus, centered at stereotaxic coordinates: 25 anterior, 20 lateral) and extracellular activity was

118

recorded with a 16-electrode linear microelectrode array (U-Probe, Plexon, Dallas TX) with

119

contacts spaced 150 µm apart. Linear arrays were lowered into FEF daily using a custom

120

designed mechanical microdrive (Laboratory for Sensorimotor Research, National Eye Institute,

121

Bethesda, MD) through a plastic grid with 1 mm spacing. The FEF recordings included in this

122

analysis were part of a larger dataset previously published (Khanna et al 2019). The location of

123

FEF was first identified by physiological response properties to visual stimuli and saccades, and

124

then confirmed through microstimulation. Recording sites were considered to be in FEF if

125

saccades could be reliably (>50%) evoked using low threshold microstimulation (≤ 50 µA, 0.25

ms pulse width, 70 ms pulse train duration, 350 Hz stimulation frequency) (Bruce et al 1985) at

127

that location or at an immediately neighboring grid location (1mm away). Of note, we were not

128

able to induce eye movements by stimulating any electrodes on the 8Ar arrays, even with

129

microstimulation up to currents of 150 µA. The head was immobilized during recordings with a

130

titanium headpost attached to the skull with titanium screws, implanted in a separate procedure

131

before the array or chamber implants. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal

132

Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh and complied with guidelines set forth

133

in the National Institute of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Data Collection. Stimuli were displayed on a 21” cathode ray tube monitor with a resolution of

136

1024x768 pixels and a refresh rate of 100 Hz at viewing distance of 36 cm. Stimuli were

137

generated using custom software written in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with the

138

Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard 1997, Kleiner et al 2007, Pelli 1997). Eye position

139

was tracked monocularly using an infrared system at 1000 Hz resolution (EyeLink 1000, SR

140

Research, Mississauga, Canada). In both the FEF and 8Ar recordings, extracellular activity was

141

recorded from the array, band-pass filtered (0.3 – 7,500 Hz), digitized at 30 kHz, and amplified

142

by a Grapevine system (Ripple, Salt Lake City, UT). Waveforms that exceeded a threshold were

143

saved and stored for offline wave classification. The threshold was set by taking a value

144

(typically -3) and multiplying it by the root mean squared noise measured on each channel.

145

Waveforms were automatically sorted using a competitive mixture decomposition algorithm

146

(Shoham et al 2003) and later refined manually based on waveform shape characteristics and

147

inter-spike interval distributions using custom time amplitude window discrimination software

148

written in MATLAB (https://github.com/smithlabvision/spikesort).

149
150

After the waveforms were sorted, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated for each
identified unit as the ratio of the average waveform amplitude to the standard deviation of the

151

waveform noise (Kelly et al 2007). We considered only candidate units with an SNR above 2.5

152

as isolated single neurons for the purpose of further analysis. This resulted in a total of 2511

153

neurons across 39 recording sessions in 8Ar (Monkey Wa: 1179 units, 20 sessions; Monkey Pe:

154

1332 units, 19 sessions) and 889 neurons across 50 sessions in FEF (Monkey Wi: 305 units, 14

155

sessions; Monkey Ro: 584 units, 36 sessions). We did not attempt to determine whether the

156

same units were recorded across multiple days with the Utah array recordings. It is likely that

157

this did occur in some cases, although our recording sessions from 8Ar were often spaced out

158

by a week or more as the animals were also performing an unrelated experiment at the same

159

time. Results from a single session from each animal are shown in Figure 11, and show the

160

representative features of the data from the full population analysis. In FEF, because the U-

161

Probe was inserted in each recording session and in multiple different chamber locations,

162

recording from the same unit across days was not a concern.

Experimental design and statistical analysis

174

Behavioral task. Monkeys performed a standard memory guided saccade (MGS) task (Figure

175

1B) (Hikosaka & Wurtz 1983). The trial commenced when the subject fixated a small blue dot

176

(0.5° diameter) at the center of the screen. For 8Ar recordings, after fixation was established

177

(200 ms), a target appeared in the periphery at one of eight angular directions (0°, 45°, 90°,

178

135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) and one of five eccentricities (5°, 7.5°, 9.9°, 12.3°, 14.7°) (40 total

179

possible locations, Figure 1C) for 50 ms. The animal was required to maintain fixation for 500

180

ms after the target was extinguished, at which point the central fixation point would disappear,

181

signaling the animal to saccade to the remembered location of the stimulus. The monkey had

182

500 ms to initiate the saccade, and once it had been initiated (defined as the monkey’s eye

183

position leaving a window 1.8° in diameter around the fixation point) the monkey’s eye position

184

had to reach the saccade target within 200 ms and maintain gaze within 2.7° of the location for

185

150 ms to receive a liquid reward. Each block consisted of pseudorandomized presentations of

186

all 40 conditions, with at least 40 blocks gathered per session (average 58). For 4 of the 20

187

sessions in Monkey Wa, the angular directions and target eccentricities were different (angles

188

26°, 71°, 116°, 161°, 206°, 251°, 296°, 341°; amplitudes 2.6°, 3.9°, 5.2°, 6.5°, 7.8°). Data from

189

these sessions were included in population analyses when possible by using the large-

190

amplitude trials (7.8°) but were not included in the population average response field analyses

191

(Figure 4A, B). For FEF recordings, the same behavioral task (MGS) was used, with stimuli

192

appearing at one of eight angular directions (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) but at

193

only one amplitude (10°). The fixation time before target onset (200 ms) and target duration (50

194

ms) were equal to 8Ar, however the delay epoch was 600 ms (as opposed to 500ms for 8Ar).

195

Each block consisted of pseudorandomized presentations of all eight conditions, with at least 50

196

blocks gathered per session (average 132). On a subset of days, after the fixation point was

197

extinguished and the monkey began its saccade, the target was re-illuminated to aid in saccade

198

completion. The analyses presented here were not affected by this target because all analysis

199

windows were constructed to end prior to any possible visual transient in response to this target.

200
201

Neuron selection. All neural firing rates were measured during stimulus presentation, the

202

memory epoch, and the perisaccadic epoch. To determine the ideal response epoch in which to

203

measure tuning, we used a method described in Smith et al (2005) in which the variance

204

(across the 40 conditions) was calculated for each neuron in a sliding window of 50 ms. For a

205

neuron tuned to the spatial location of the visual stimulus or the saccade, the variance is largest

206

when the window is aligned to the latency of the neuron (when it exhibits that tuning in the form

207

of spatially variable responses). To isolate the visual and perisaccadic responses, we measured

208

the latency of the visual response from 0 ms to 400 ms after stimulus onset for all neurons.

209

These outer boundary values were determined by visually examining the PSTHs of individual

210

neurons and the population response. Similarly, the saccade response was measured 100 ms

211

before to 50 ms after the saccade. Once the optimal window was identified for each neuron, we

212

determined whether the neuron had significant (p < .01) spatial tuning in that response window

213

using a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on the average firing rates with location as

214

the factor.

215
216

Response field calculation. The center of each neuron’s response field during the visual and

217

saccade epoch was calculated as follows. For each stimulus location, activity during the time

218

epoch desired (visual, saccade, or across the delay in a sliding window analysis) was baseline-

219

corrected by subtracting the average activity across all conditions (since they were the same

220

prior to stimulus onset) from 30 ms to 180 ms after fixation was established (170 ms to 20 ms

221

before stimulus onset). The resulting baseline subtracted activity was averaged across the trial

222

repeats for each condition, and then linearly interpolated to obtain a map with a resolution of

223

0.25° x 0.25°. This map was smoothed using a gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 1°.

224

The center of the response field was defined as the center of mass for all locations with

225

responses ≥75% of the maximum for a given response field map (Zirnsak et al 2014). Only

226

responses above baseline (as opposed to responses suppressed below baseline) were

227

considered for the center of mass calculation. All response field spatial maps are displayed such

228

that the left side of each image corresponded to the contralateral visual hemifield. This required

229

reflecting the spatial response maps for Monkey Wa (where recordings were made from an

230

array implanted in left 8Ar), so that data from both monkeys were displayed with the same

231

coordinate frame.

232
233

Visual/motor index calculation. To understand how neurons in each population responded to the

234

visual stimulus relative to the saccade, a visuomotor index (VMI) was calculated using the

235

formula below (Bruce & Goldberg 1985, Lawrence et al 2005, Sato & Schall 2003, Sommer &

236

Wurtz 2000):

237

𝑉𝑀𝐼 =

𝑉−𝑀
𝑉+𝑀

238
239

Where V is the response in the visual window and M is the response in the saccade window,

240

with no baseline subtraction. Therefore, a VMI corresponding to 1 indicates a response

241

exclusively for the visual stimulus, -1 exclusively for the saccade, and 0 indicates equal

242

responses for the visual stimulus and saccade. For FEF, VMI was calculated individually for the

243

8 conditions and then averaged across conditions to produce a single VMI value per neuron.

244

For 8Ar, a subset of conditions (8 of the 40 conditions at a single amplitude) which most closely

approximated the amplitude and direction of the FEF stimuli were selected to facilitate

246

comparison between the two areas.

247
248

Cross-temporal decoding analysis. A Poisson Naïve Bayesian decoder was implemented to

249

determine the working memory signal readout of 8Ar and FEF populations. For both regions, a

250

pseudo-population was created by combining neurons across recording sessions. Trial to trial

251

dependencies within a session were removed by shuffling the order of the repeats. Any

252

recording session with less than 40 repeats of each condition (1 session for FEF, 4 sessions for

253

8Ar), and any units that did not have an SNR greater than 2.5 or fire at least 1 spike per second

254

during the delay period of at least one condition were omitted (leading to the removal of 93 FEF

units and 561 8Ar units). The instantaneous firing rate of each neuron (100 ms overlapping

256

windows stepped by 50 ms) was used to build a decoder to predict the 8 saccade directions in

257

FEF, and the 8 saccade directions closest in amplitude to the FEF saccade directions for 8Ar (8

258

of the 40 conditions). The training data set contained 80% of the trials, creating a Poisson

259

distribution model for each direction (θ) using the average spike count for each unit (nspike) in the

260

time epoch specified. The remaining 20% of trials were used for testing, at time windows

261

beginning at fixation and ending after the saccade. For a given test trial, the direction with the

262

maximum prediction probability, P(θ| nspike), was defined as the predicted saccade direction.

263

P(nspike| θ), was calculated using the Poisson distribution model that resulted from the training

264

data. We used 5-fold cross validation, rotating the training and testing data such that each trial

265

was used once for testing, with the average decoding accuracy computed across folds.

267

Comparison of decoding between 8Ar and FEF. To compare overall decoding accuracy

268

between FEF and 8Ar, we randomly selected a single set of 8Ar neurons (770 neurons) from

269

the total 8Ar population (1722 neurons) to match the size of the recorded population in FEF.

270

When comparing decoding accuracy as a function of other properties (number of neurons,

271

directional selectivity, and reliability) we used the training and testing time point that had the

272

highest accuracy for each area during the delay period (FEF: 50 ms to 150 ms after stimulus

273

offset, 8Ar: 100 ms to 200 ms after stimulus offset).

274
275

Decoding accuracy and reliability. We developed an index of the reliability of a neuron by

276

calculating a tuning curve separately for the even and odd trials in the time bin with the highest

277

decoding accuracy (see Methods above). The reliability was calculated as the Pearson

278

correlation coefficient of the even and odd trial tuning curves. A neuron with an identical tuning

279

curve on even and odd trials would have a reliability of 1, while a neuron in which the tuning

280

curves on the even and odd trials were independent would have a reliability of 0 (on average).

281

Reliability values less than 0 could occur by chance, but would not be expected on average

282

because it would require the tuning curve to shift systematically in preferred direction between

283

the even and odd trials. Each neuron in the pseudo-population was then sorted according to

284

their reliability. Subpopulations of 100 neurons were used to decode eye movement direction,

285

starting with the 100 neurons with the highest reliability, then the next 100 ranked neurons in

286

non-overlapping bins until the remaining population did not have 100 neurons. For the FEF

287

population, this resulted in 7 bins (ranked neurons 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500,

288

and 501-600, and 601-700). For the 8Ar population, the number of 100-neuron bins was larger

289

due to the larger number of 8Ar neurons recorded.

291

Decoding accuracy and tuning selectivity. The selectivity of each 8Ar and FEF neuron was

292

computed during the time window of maximum decoding accuracy (see Comparison of

293

decoding between 8Ar and FEF) using a normalized vector strength metric (Smith et al 2002).

294

To measure the selectivity of each neuron’s tuning curve, we calculated the complex summed

295

response vector (where i = √−1)
A

𝑣 = : 𝑅< 𝑒 (/>?@ )

296

<BC

297

Where Rn is the response magnitude during the delay period, θn is the stimulus location, and n

298

is an index from 1 to the number of points, 8, in the tuning curve. This was then normalized by

299

the summed magnitude of all the response vectors:

300

𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

|𝑣|
∑A
<BC |𝑅< |

301

A selectivity of 0 corresponded to a neuron that fired for all conditions equally while a value of 1

302

indicated a neuron that responded exclusively to one condition. We ranked and grouped

303

neurons based on their selectivity for the decoding analysis in the same manner described

304

above for the reliability analysis.

Results

307

We recorded from 2511 8Ar neurons across 39 sessions and 889 FEF neurons across

308

50 sessions (see Methods) in four macaque monkeys while the animals performed a memory

309

guided saccade task (Figure 1B). We sought to understand the principles by which visual and

310

motor signals align and evolve over time during sensorimotor integration. By comparing two

311

brain regions, one closer to the motor output and one further (Leichnetz & Goldberg 1988,

312

Segraves & Goldberg 1987, Sommer & Wurtz 2000), we were able to directly compare the

strength and alignment of visual and motor signals from the appearance of a visual stimulus to

314

the execution of a saccade.

315
316
317

Spatial constancy in 8Ar single neurons
To understand how visual and motor signals are processed at the population level in

318

8Ar, we first wanted to ensure robust responses were observed at the single neuron level.

319

Previous studies examined visual (Funahashi et al 1989) and motor (Funahashi et al 1991)

320

responses in 8Ar during an oculomotor task, reporting a wide variety of response properties

321

including significant tuning for the visual, delay, and/or saccade epochs, ipsilateral and

322

contralateral tuning, and both excitation and suppression in delay period activity. Having visual

323

stimuli and saccades of numerous amplitudes and directions allowed us to form detailed

324

response fields in the visual and saccade epochs for all neurons recorded. In Figure 2, we show

325

two example 8Ar neurons with large responses during the visual and saccade epochs. Of note,

326

each neuron had a spatially defined area of high firing rate (red) that remained localized to the

327

same region of retinotopic space between visual and saccade epoch – in other words, the

328

tuning was aligned. We observed three key features of 8Ar neuronal responses that are evident

329

in the examples in Figure 2: (1) neurons exhibited both excitation and suppression relative to

330

their baseline rate (particularly evident in Figure 2B), and regions of peak suppression tended to

331

be located 180 degrees away from regions of peak excitation, (2) neurons typically were tuned

332

in their responses smoothly across the whole tested visual field, as opposed to the punctate

333

receptive fields characteristic of early visual cortex, and (3) excitatory response regions could be

334

located either contralateral (Figure 2A) or ipsilateral (Figure 2B) to the recorded hemisphere.

Figure 2: Spatial constancy in 8Ar neurons. A) Top: Response field map for an example neuron during the visual and
saccade epoch. Firing rate was baseline subtracted (170 ms to 20 ms before stimulus onset) such that red colors
indicate activity above baseline, blue colors activity below baseline, and white near baseline. Middle: PSTHs aligned to
stimulus onset and saccade onset for a condition close to the center of the response field (black circle). Bottom: PSTHs
aligned to stimulus onset and saccade onset for a condition in the opposite hemifield of the center of the response field
(gray circle). The blue shaded regions indicate the time period in which the firing rate was calculated during the visual
and saccadic epochs for the response field maps. This neuron had a robust visual and saccadic response that was
localized to the contralateral hemifield and was spatially congruent between the visual and saccade epoch. B) An
example neuron with a robust and spatially congruent visual and saccadic response localized to the lower portion of
the ipsilateral hemifield. Spatial locations opposite the center of the response field were suppressed below baseline.
Note: all response field maps were flipped such that the left hemifield represented the contralateral hemifield. Example
A was from monkey Wa and example B was from monkey Pe.

Response latency in FEF and 8Ar
Having confirmed that 8Ar neurons had distinct and spatially localized response fields in

351

both the visual and saccade epochs, we next identified the ideal time window to accurately

352

capture the visual and saccadic responses. Previous studies have demonstrated 8Ar visual

353

responses can have a variety of time courses (Mikami et al 1982, Suzuki & Azuma 1983):

354

transient bursts of excitation or suppression after stimulus onset or perisaccadically, sustained

355

modulation throughout the entire delay period, or a combination thereof. We first examined the

356

population PSTH aligned to the visual stimulus or saccade and measured the overall time

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/817478; this version posted October 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

357

course of 8Ar activity. The 8Ar population had a small visual transient with a longer sustained

358

period of activity during the delay period, which then rose perisaccadically and peaked after

359

saccade onset (Figure 3A). This contrasted with the FEF population PSTH, which had a more

360

phasic visual transient at a shorter latency, as well as perisaccadic activity that peaked closer to

361

saccade onset (Figure 3B). To determine the latency of each neuron in response to a visual

362

stimulus and relative to a saccade, we calculated the variance across the target conditions in 50

363

ms windows (see Methods). To ensure a fair comparison between 8Ar and FEF latencies, the

364

same window width and epoch times were used. For neurons with significant visual responses

365

(p < .01, Kruskal-Wallis test), 8Ar had a significantly longer latency when compared to FEF

366

(Figure 3C, 8Ar mean = 189 ms, FEF mean = 154 ms; two sample t-test p < .001), consistent

367

with our visual observations of the PSTHs in the two areas. Our estimate in FEF was later than

368

other reports (such as (Mayo et al 2015, Schmolesky et al 1998), in part because our latency

369

metric measures peak tuning and not response onset as in some other studies. This latency

370

difference, combined with the visual comparison of the PSTHs, suggest a substantially more

371

robust and earlier visual response in FEF than in 8Ar.

Figure 3: Latency in 8Ar and FEF. A) Population PSTH for all 8Ar neurons (black line, n = 2511 neurons) and
significantly tuned 8Ar neurons (grey line; p < .001 Kruskal Wallis test) in the visual (left) or saccade (right) epoch.
Significant visual neurons (n = 1222 neurons) passed the significance test in the visual epoch while significant
saccade neurons (n = 941 neurons) passed the test in the saccade epoch. Each neuron’s PSTH was normalized by
the maximum firing rate in either the visual/delay epoch (0 ms to 550 ms after stimulus onset) or the saccade epoch (200 ms to 50 ms before saccade onset). B) Same convention as in A, but with all FEF neurons (black line; n = 889
neurons) and significantly tuned neurons (grey line) in the visual (n = 426 neurons) or saccade (n = 363 neurons)
epoch. The 8Ar population PSTH had less modulation with respect to baseline and a longer latency compared to FEF
in the visual and saccade epochs. C) Distribution of single neuron latencies for FEF (blue) and 8Ar (orange) during
the visual epoch. Only neurons with significant visual responses were included (8Ar = 1222 neurons; FEF = 426
neurons). The 8Ar distribution had a significantly longer visual latency compared to FEF (p < .001; two sample t-test).

Hemifield tuning differences in 8Ar
Previous 8Ar studies have found neurons tuned to stimuli in the ipsilateral visual field

387

(Funahashi et al 1989, Funahashi et al 1991), unlike most earlier visual areas which are entirely

388

contralateral or extend only minimally into the ipsilateral hemifield (Gattass et al 1981, Gattass

389

et al 1988). Our observations of individual example neurons (Figure 2) extend beyond a simple

390

classification of contralateral or ipsilateral – individual neurons demonstrated smoothly varying

391

responses across the whole tested visual field. We sought to determine whether this

392

observation in individual neurons was representative of the entire population, and then asked

393

how the ipsilateral and contralateral representations of space differ in 8Ar neurons.

394

We first defined a neuron as ipsilateral or contralateral based on the location of the

395

center of mass calculated on the response that was elevated above baseline (the red region of

396

the response maps, see Methods). For each group (ipsilateral and contralateral), we rotated the

397

response field map of each neuron such that its center of mass was on the horizontal meridian.

398

Ipsilateral and contralateral tuned neurons were then combined separately to form a population

399

response field map for the visual epoch and the saccade epoch. For the contralateral tuned

400

population, suppression in the opposite hemifield was more apparent in the saccade epoch

401

compared to the visual epoch (Figure 4A). For the ipsilateral tuned population, suppression was

402

equally present in both visual and saccade epochs (Figure 4B). The observation of stronger

403

suppression in the ipsilateral tuned population compared to the contralateral tuned population

404

during the visual epoch agrees with a previous finding (Bullock et al 2017).

405

We then investigated the contralaterally and ipsilaterally tuned population PSTHs

406

aligned to stimulus and saccade onset. For the visual epoch, the ipsilateral tuned population

407

had a later and weaker visual transient, coupled with a stronger sustained level of activity in the

408

delay period after the visual transient (Figure 4C). During the saccade epoch the ipsilateral

409

population began at a lower level of activity and increased more sharply perisaccadically.

410

Comparing the visual latency distributions, ipsilateral neurons had significantly longer visual

411

latencies (p < .001, two sample t-test) and had a more uniform distribution of latencies

412

compared to the contralateral distribution, which had a clear peak around 187 ms (Figure 4D).

Figure 4: Hemifield tuning differences in 8Ar. A) Population response field maps for contralateral tuned neurons in the
visual (left) and saccade (right) epoch. Each neuron’s response field map was normalized by the maximum response
and rotated to the horizontal meridian. All normalized and rotated maps were then averaged across neurons to yield
the population response field map. B) same convention as in A but for the ipsilateral tuned neurons. The ipsilateral and
contralateral populations had similar suppression during the saccade epoch, however less suppression was observed
for the contralateral population during the visual epoch. C) Population PSTHs for contralateral (dark orange) and
ipsilateral (light orange) neurons aligned to stimulus onset or saccade onset. During the visual epoch, the ipsilateral
population PSTH had less modulation relative to baseline and a later latency than the contralateral population. During
the saccade epoch, the ipsilateral population PSTH had more modulation relative to baseline but still had a longer
latency. D) Distribution of latencies for contralateral (filled) and ipsilateral (open) neurons during the visual epoch. Only
neurons with significant visual responses were included (contralateral = 773 neurons; ipsilateral = 449 neurons). The
ipsilateral distribution had a significantly longer visual latency compared to the contralateral distribution (p < .001; two
sample t-test).

428

Dynamic selectivity in 8Ar

429

So far, we have demonstrated 8Ar neurons had a wide variety of spatial tuning and

430

latencies across the visual and saccade epochs. Given this variety, we sought to understand

431

how these visual and motor signals coexisted within 8Ar. One particularly intriguing aspect of

432

dynamic selectivity in 8Ar, observed at the single neuron level, is an alteration of the spatial

433

response preferences during the delay period of a working memory task, often referred to as

434

mixed selectivity (Parthasarathy et al 2017, Spaak et al 2017). However, typical investigations of

435

this property employed a limited set of conditions, displaying stimuli at only one eccentricity. Our

436

experimental paradigm tiled a substantially larger portion of visual space resulting in a more

437

detailed estimate of each neuron’s visual and saccadic response field. Using this high

438

resolution, we sought to confirm the extent of dynamic selectivity across the population of 8Ar

439

neurons and determine if there were systematic rules by which this representation evolved over

440

the time period between the visual stimulus and the saccade.

441

We found that so-called mixed selectivity existed in a subset of 8Ar neurons, and

442

comparing single neuron examples illuminated subtle differences in how individual neurons

443

changed their tuning. For some neurons, the center of the response field shifted drastically

444

between the visual and motor epochs, such as a 90-degree rotation (Figure 5A). For other

445

neurons, the response field during the visual epoch broadened during the saccade epoch, such

446

that stimuli that were suppressed during the visual epoch became regions of peak activity during

447

the saccade epoch (Figure 5B). Finally, some neurons shifted the center of their response field

448

180-degrees, where the area of maximum activity during the visual epoch was suppressed

449

below baseline during the saccade epoch (Figure 5C). These results provide clear examples of

450

single neurons shifting their tuning preferences between the visual and saccade epochs and

451

highlight the diversity of spatial shifts observed across individual neurons.

Figure 5: Dynamic selectivity in single neurons. A) Top: response field map of the baseline subtracted firing rate for
an example neuron. Bottom: Average PSTH for a condition close to the center of the visual response field (black) and
close to the center of the saccade response field (grey). This example neuron was contralaterally tuned during the
visual epoch but rotated its response field 90-degrees to the ipsilateral hemifield during the saccade epoch. B)
Example neuron with contralateral tuning during the visual epoch, with the ipsilateral hemifield suppressed. During
the saccade epoch, the response field broadened such that the neuron fired above baseline for the condition that was
previously suppressed. C) Example neuron with a robust visual response in the contralateral hemifield that is
suppressed during the saccade epoch. The response field shifted nearly 180-degrees between the visual and
saccade epochs. Examples A and B were from monkey Pe, example C from monkey Wa.

The previous examples of mixed selectivity compared the tuning of individual neurons in

464

specific windows during the visual and saccade epochs. If the visual stimulus and saccade

465

signals are indeed separately coded in 8Ar, and the switch from a visual to a saccadic code

466

accounted for much of the diversity seen in the 8Ar neuronal response, we hypothesized the

467

maximum difference in the response field of the visual and saccade epochs should occur

468

between the peak of the visual response and the onset of the saccade. To determine whether

469

this was the case, we calculated the center of the response field in 50 ms windows throughout

470

the entire trial (fixation onset to saccade onset). To understand how the center of the response
23

471

field shifted over the course of the trial, we subtracted the angle associated with the center of

472

the response field in the ideal visual epoch window (see Methods) from the angle associated

473

with the center of the response field calculated in sliding windows throughout the trial. If a

474

neuron maintained the spatial location of its visual response field throughout the entire trial,

475

subtracting by the preferred location would yield an angular difference of 0 throughout the trial

476

(Figure 6A, top). Conversely, if a neuron shifted its tuning during the saccade epoch, we would

477

predict the angular difference to be low in the visual epoch (as it is close to the ideal visual time

478

window) but increase as the time window approached the saccade (Figure 6A, bottom). The

479

same process was repeated for the ideal saccade window, where the center of the response

480

field throughout the trial was subtracted by the ideal saccade window. These angular difference

481

curves throughout the trial were calculated for each neuron and then averaged across neurons

482

to yield a population metric. We found the maximum angular difference between the center of

483

mass at a given time in the trial and the ideal visual window corresponded to saccade onset,

484

while the minimum angular difference was observed around the mean visual latency of the

485

population (180ms after stimulus onset) (Figure 6B, left). Conversely, the maximum angular

486

difference for the ideal saccade window was after stimulus onset, and the minimum angular

487

difference was at saccade onset (Figure 6B, right). Thus, the spatial shifts in 8Ar neurons were

488

most obvious when comparing the visual and saccade-aligned responses.

489

Large shifts in the center of the response field could be confounded by neurons that did

490

not fire in the other epoch, thus creating a noisy estimate of the center of the response field. To

491

address this, we selected 8Ar neurons which were tuned both to the location of the visual

492

stimulus as well as the saccade. We found those neurons in the population which had

493

significant tuning (Kruskal Wallis test, p < .001) in at least 50% of the time points following the

494

visual stimulus (50 ms to 350 ms after stimulus onset) and preceding the saccade (-100 ms to 0

495

ms before saccade onset). The rationale was these neurons maintained their tuning in the visual

496

and saccade epochs, and thus any shifts in tuning were not due to neurons that had a strong

497

spatial preference in one epoch but weak or noisy responses in the other. Within this

498

subpopulation, the same angular difference trends were maintained (Figure 6C). In summary,

499

the maximum shift in response fields occurred between the visual and saccade epochs and this

500

shift was not confounded by neurons that were untuned in either of the epochs. This is

501

consistent with the hypothesis that some of the rich dynamics observed in 8Ar emerge due to a

502

transition between separate visual and motor representations in the population.

from the response field calculated during the ideal visual latency was saccade onset. Conversely, the time during the
trial at which the response field center was furthest from the response field calculated during the ideal saccade latency
was in the 200ms following stimulus onset.

neurons altered their tuning between the visual and saccade epochs even though the visual

stimulus and saccade endpoint were at the same spatial location. Furthermore, this was not

simply due to a loss of tuning during one of the epochs. If mixed selectivity occurred in 8Ar, a

521

natural first step would be to determine whether this property was unique to a subpopulation of

522

8Ar neurons, such as the ipsilateral neurons that we found had longer response latencies and

523

different patterns of suppression opposite the response field. In addition, we considered whether

524

other cortical regions exhibited similar changes in tuning, or whether this property was unique to

525

8Ar. To determine the relative prominence of neurons with shifting tuning in 8Ar, we compared

526

our observations at a population level with FEF. Given FEF is more closely linked to the

527

generation of saccades, we hypothesized more FEF neurons would have a congruent alignment

528

of their visual and motor signals compared to 8Ar.

529

We first asked whether there was any pattern to how 8Ar neurons shifted their response

530

profiles between the visual and saccade-related responses. To do this, we included only

531

neurons that were selective in both the visual and saccade epochs (p < .001; Kruskal Wallis

532

Test; Contra: n = 412 neurons; Ipsi: n = 217 neurons). We then computed the angular difference

533

between the center of the response field in the ideal visual and saccade epoch and binned

534

these angular differences in six 30° bins. We compared the distribution of these visual-motor

535

angular differences to a null distribution obtained by associating each neuron’s preferred visual

536

response angle with the preferred saccadic response angle of a different neuron. We repeated

537

this process 1000 times to obtain the 5th and 95th confidence intervals for each 30° bin. For both

538

the contralateral and ipsilateral populations in 8Ar, we found that roughly half of the neurons had

539

visual and saccadic peak response angles within 60° (Figure 7A). Of the remaining neurons,

540

there was a tendency for a mirror inversion (> 120° shift) more often that an intermediate

541

rotation (60-120°).

542

To compare the shifts we observed in 8Ar with a baseline from an area that has been

543

studied extensively in visuomotor tasks, we matched our data in the two areas across conditions

544

and trial repeats (see Methods). This meant a subset of the 8Ar data were used (1 target

545

amplitude, 8 directions), and all FEF and 8Ar sessions were randomly subsampled to 40 trial

546

repeats per condition. The same method for calculating latency was used on this subsampled

547

data from both areas to calculate the ideal visual and saccade response window and to identify

548

significantly tuned neurons (p < .001; Kruskal Wallis test; FEF n = 251 neurons, 8Ar n = 152

549

neurons). Our results in 8Ar with this reduced data set were similar to those obtained in the full

550

40-condition data (Figure 7B). As a population, FEF had a greater proportion of well-aligned

551

neurons (< 30° angular difference) than 8Ar (8Ar = 32%; FEF= 48%; p = .0014, Chi-square

552

test). However, both areas contained a subset of neurons that reliably shifted their tuning

553

between the visual and saccadic epochs.

neurons with significant visual and saccade responses were analyzed (p<.01, Kruskal Wallis Test; Contra n = 412;

difference by chance (upper and lower grey dots). Contralateral and ipsilateral populations had similar distributions
with respect to angular difference. Many neurons had consistent visual and saccade alignment, however a substantial
portion also shifted their tuning dramatically. B) same conventions as in A but comparing the FEF population to the

565

Visual and motor response properties in FEF and 8Ar

566

In addition to the spatial response profile, we sought to compare the relative strength of

567

visual and motor signals in 8Ar and FEF by computing a visuomotor index (VMI, see Methods)

568

across conditions for each neuron in the FEF and 8Ar populations. Broadly, these distributions

569

were quite similar in the two regions – most neurons exhibited some degree of visual and

570

saccadic responses, leading to distributions centered on zero. However, relative to the FEF

571

distribution, 8Ar was significantly (p = .003; two sample t-test) shifted toward 1, meaning 8Ar

572

neurons were more likely to have a stronger visual response compared to a saccade response

573

(Figure 8A). In addition to this difference in the ratio of visual and saccadic responses, FEF had

574

a larger proportion of significantly tuned neurons (p < .001 in the visual, motor, or both epochs;

575

Kruskal Wallis test) in visual, visuomotor, and motor groups (chi squared test; visual: p = .01;

576

motor: p = .007; visuomotor: p < .001) (Figure 8B). When combining the three groups (tuned

577

visual, motor, and visuomotor) FEF also had a significantly higher proportion of contralaterally

578

tuned neurons (chi squared test, p = .002; FEF 68% contra, 8Ar 59% contra). The presence of

579

more ipsilateral tuned neurons in 8Ar was even more striking when considering only the most

580

directionally selective (see Methods) neurons in each population (Figure 8C). To obtain these

581

selective neurons for a given visual/motor/visuomotor group, a neuron had to be significantly

582

tuned (p < .001; Kruskal Wallis test in one or both of the visual and saccadic epochs) as well as

583

have a directional selectivity (see Methods) that was at or above the 90th percentile for the

584

epoch. For most of the groups in both 8Ar and FEF, selective neurons had a strong contralateral

585

bias (FEF contralateral: visual 82%, motor 71%, visuomotor 79%; 8Ar contralateral: visual 79%,

586

motor 30%, visuomotor 71%). In FEF, this result is consistent with a previous study by our

587

group that found almost exclusively contralateral RFs in a population of neurons with brisk

588

visual responses to a dynamic dot stimulus (Mayo et al 2015). Interestingly, when considering

589

only these selective neurons, the 8Ar motor population had more ipsilateral than contralateral

590

neurons. Upon visual inspection of these ipsilateral tuned motor neurons, we noted many of

591

them had drastic shifts in their spatial responses between the visual and motor epochs, with

592

contralateral tuned visual responses (that did not pass the significance test for tuning in the

593

visual epoch). Overall, these results indicate that FEF neurons are more strongly tuned, and

594

more contralaterally biased, than 8Ar neurons, which have a more balanced representation of

595

space that also appears more likely to shift between the visual and motor epochs.

selectivity (FEF: visual = 22, motor = 17, visuomotor = 24; 8Ar: visual = 70, motor = 57, visuomotor =12). A majority of
the most selective FEF neurons had contralateral tuning, while in 8Ar, highly selective motor neurons were more likely
to be ipsilateral tuned.

Decoding from 8Ar and FEF populations
Individual 8Ar neurons had numerous tendencies consistent with the mixed or dynamic

611

selectivity observed by other groups during working memory tasks. One approach to quantify

612

the effect of these changes in individual neurons is to apply decoding analyses to the whole

613

population (Astrand et al 2014, Barak et al 2010, Parthasarathy et al 2017, Spaak et al 2017,

614

Stokes et al 2013). An accumulation of tuning shifts across individual neurons would lead to a

615

spatial representation that did not generalize well across time. In such a situation, a decoder

616

built on data from one time point in the trial would do poorly in predicting target location at

617

another time point. Our results with individual neuron analyses in 8Ar and FEF led us to predict

618

that the population-level signal in FEF would be more temporally generalizable than that in 8Ar.

619

We used a Poisson Naïve Bayes decoder, trained on neural activity from one time

620

window in the trial, and tested on all other time points during the trial (see Methods). We

621

combined neurons across recording sessions to create a pseudo-population in FEF and 8Ar,

622

using 8 conditions (1 amplitude, 8 directions) and, to normalize across sessions, 40 trial repeats

623

randomly selected from each condition with the trial ordering shuffled for each neuron to destroy

624

any correlations between neurons. All decoding accuracies reported were the average across

625

the eight conditions, and standard errors were computed across cross-validation folds. For

626

comparisons between FEF and 8Ar, the 8Ar pseudo-population was randomly subsampled to

627

match the number of neurons in the FEF pseudo-population, unless stated otherwise.

628

Overall decoding performance, as well as generalizability across time, was higher in the

629

FEF pseudo-population compared to 8Ar. For FEF, decoding was highest shortly after visual

630

onset and around the time of the saccade, but also maintained a high accuracy throughout the

631

delay period (Figure 9A). The generalizability of the FEF population code was seen by

632

examining bins on the off-diagonal, where the training and testing epochs were temporally

633

separated. The decoder trained using FEF activity was more generalizable when compared to

634

8Ar (Figure 9B). We took a cross-section of the decoding performance map and evaluated the

635

testing accuracy across the trial when the training bin was held constant (Figure 9, inset line

636

graphs). If activity in a given training bin was generalizable across time, the resulting accuracy

637

curves would be broad, while non-generalizable activity would have a sharp peak corresponding

638

to when the training and testing bins temporally aligned. The accuracy curves for 3 training bins

639

throughout the delay period were higher and broader for FEF compared to 8Ar, suggesting the

640

FEF population code had a more accurate readout of the stimulus/saccade encoded during a

641

trial, and that the code was more generalizable throughout the trial.

highest for training and testing points that were temporally in the same bin, particularly after stimulus onset and around
the time of the saccade. FEF had a higher overall decoding accuracy and a higher accuracy for training and testing
points that were temporally separated.

652
653

To understand why the FEF decoder performed better than the 8Ar decoder, we related

654

decoding accuracy to three basic properties of the pseudo-population: the number of neurons in

655

the population, the direction selectivity of the neurons, and their reliability in response (the

656

correlation in tuning curves between even and odd trials, see Methods). For this analysis, one

657

time point with the highest decoding accuracy after stimulus onset was selected for testing and

32

658

training (FEF: 100-150 ms after stimulus onset, 8Ar 150-200 ms after stimulus onset). We first

659

examined decoding accuracy as a function of the number of neurons in the pseudo-population.

660

Across all pseudo-population sizes, the FEF decoder performed better than the 8Ar decoder

661

(Figure 10A). Starting with a population of 100 neurons, the FEF decoder increased in accuracy

662

as more neurons were added and began to asymptote at 100% accuracy for populations over

663

500 neurons. The 8Ar population started at an overall lower accuracy level and monotonically

664

increased as more neurons were added, but the decoder never reached the accuracy of even

665

the smallest population of FEF neurons we tested (FEF accuracy, 100 neurons 71.5%; 8Ar

666

accuracy 1722 neurons 63.5%).

667

Knowing that a decoder trained on activity from a small population of FEF neurons (100

668

neurons) could outperform one trained on the entire 8Ar population (1722 neurons) we

669

examined what individual response properties could lead to such a wide margin in decoding.

670

We first examined direction selectivity, a measure of tuning across the 8 conditions (see

671

Methods). One possibility is that the neurons in FEF were merely more selective, and therefore

672

the population of FEF neurons produced better decoding. For each pseudo-population (FEF and

673

8Ar), each neuron was ranked by their selectivity. Then, nonoverlapping groups of 100 neurons

674

were chosen starting with the most selective. Decoding accuracy increased with the directional

675

selectivity of the neurons for both FEF and 8Ar. When we compared subpopulations where the

676

average selectivity of the 100 neurons was the same, FEF decoding accuracy was still larger

677

than 8Ar (Figure 10B). However, the much smaller difference in decoding between FEF and 8Ar

678

in matched selectivity groups indicates that one reason for the better decoding in FEF was that

679

FEF neurons were, on average, more selective than 8Ar.

680

We considered a second response property that could influence decoding, which was

681

the reliability of the neurons from trial to trial for the same stimuli (see Methods). Using the same

682

methodology as for selectivity, we ranked the neurons and measured decoding in groups of
33

683

100. As with selectivity, decoding accuracy increased with reliability for both FEF and 8Ar

684

populations. In groups of neurons matched by their reliability, FEF decoding performance was

685

closer to, yet still slightly exceeding 8Ar performance (Figure 10C). Taken together, these

686

analyses show that the overall higher selectivity and reliability in FEF neurons are important

687

contributors to the higher ability to decode from small populations in FEF compared to 8Ar.

Figure 10: Decoding accuracy with single neuron properties. A) Decoding accuracy in FEF (blue) and 8Ar (red) as a
function of the size of the pseudo-population. Even the smallest FEF population tested (100 neurons) performed
better than the entire sample of 8Ar neurons (1722 neurons). B) Decoding accuracy for groups of 100 neurons (nonoverlapping) as a function of direction selectivity. For both FEF and 8Ar, as the mean direction selectivity of the
population increased, the decoding accuracy increased. The difference in decoding accuracy between 8Ar and FEF
neurons decreased when matched for direction selectivity, but the FEF populations still maintained a higher decoding
accuracy. C) Same convention as in B but matched for reliability. Similar to the direction selectivity results, decoding
accuracy increased as reliability increased, and the difference in decoding accuracy between FEF and 8Ar was
reduced when matched for reliability, but the decoding performance in FEF remained higher than 8Ar.

Discussion
The transition from perception of a visual stimulus to the generation of a saccadic eye

701

movement is fundamental to primate behavior and has been an important model system for

702

studying the broader process of sensorimotor integration. Using a memory guided saccade task

703

that separates responses due to the visual stimulus from those associated with the eye

704

movement, we studied the dynamics of high-resolution visual and motor representations in 8Ar

705

and FEF. These two cortical regions have been implicated as important in sensorimotor

706

transformations, particularly in the context of spatial working memory, with FEF situated closer

707

to the motor output, with its direct connections to the superior colliculus (Leichnetz et al 1981,

708

Segraves & Goldberg 1987, Sommer & Wurtz 2000) and brain stem oculomotor nuclei (Huerta

709

et al 1986, Leichnetz et al 1984), and 8Ar more removed (but see also Borra et al (2015)). We

710

found 8Ar neurons display a rich set of response properties that were not frequently observed in

711

FEF, suggesting an important distinction in how these two areas function during perception and

712

action.

713
714
715

Visual field representation
We found that 8Ar neurons in one hemisphere represent the entire visual field. This

716

representation is achieved not only by an enhancement of activity above baseline (a more

717

traditional receptive field), but also through spatially tuned suppression below baseline (an

718

inversion of the traditional receptive field). These regions of excitation and suppression spanned

719

both hemifields, such that a typical 8Ar neuron provided spatial information about the entire

720

visual field rather than a small region typical of receptive fields in early visual cortex. Regions of

721

excitation in 8Ar could be in either the contralateral or ipsilateral hemifield, with suppressive

722

areas typically located directly opposite (by 180°). While nearby neurons in some cases had

723

spatially similar receptive fields, we observed no distinct pattern of topographic organization

724

across the electrode arrays (Figure 11). Taken together, these observations suggest a highly

725

distributed representation of space in 8Ar.

726

In visual and oculomotor areas, neurons primarily represent the contralateral hemifield.

727

This includes FEF (Bruce & Goldberg 1985, Mayo et al 2015), LIP (Ben Hamed et al 2001, Blatt

728

et al 1990, Patel et al 2010), SC (Cynader & Berman 1972, Goldberg & Wurtz 1972, Schiller &

729

Koerner 1971), and SEF (Schlag & Schlag-Rey 1987). Some cortical areas show evidence of

730

ipsilateral tuning, such as MT (Gattass & Gross 1981, Van Essen et al 1981), FST (Desimone &

731

Ungerleider 1986), LIP (Dunn & Colby 2010), SEF (Schall 1991, Schlag & Schlag-Rey 1987),

732

and IT (Ungerleider 1983), although ipsilateral responses in these areas are typically confined to

733

regions of space that are just across the vertical meridian. Our findings of ipsilateral tuning are

734

consistent with earlier reports in 8Ar of visual, delay, and saccadic responses (Funahashi et al

735

1989, Funahashi et al 1990, Funahashi et al 1991, Mikami et al 1982, Suzuki & Azuma 1983).

736

Some previous studies in 8Ar have identified neurons that are suppressed below baseline,

737

primarily opposite the receptive field (Bullock et al 2017, Kiani et al 2015), as well as a medial-

738

lateral topography for visual eccentricity (Suzuki & Azuma 1983) that mirrors that in FEF (Bruce

739

et al 1985). We did not observe a strong topography in our recordings, but did observe local

740

clustering consistent with a previous report (Leavitt et al 2017), evident from our observation of

741

nearby neurons with similar RFs (Figure 11, dashed purple outline). It is likely that some of the

742

variability in previous observations of topography within 8Ar is due to sparse spatial mapping in

743

concert with the rich spatial structure of excitation and suppression.

corresponded to activity above baseline, blue below baseline, and white near baseline. The spatial location of each neuron
corresponds to its position on the electrode array. The arrays are oriented with the wire bundle coming from the right side of the
figure (refer to Figure 1 for the orientation with respect to the brain). Very roughly, the bottom right of the arrays in these

the neuron with largest modulation depth (maximum firing rate – minimum firing rate) was used. Colored boxes highlight
illustrative examples of neurons located physically near each other (i.e., recorded with adjacent electrodes) with the same tuning
(purple) or disparate tuning (green). Black numbers identify neurons with mixed selectivity between the visual and motor
epochs.

Transition from visual to motor responses in 8Ar and FEF
Our comparison of 8Ar and FEF, from the presentation of a visual stimulus to the

759

execution of an eye movement, revealed key differences in the properties of these two cortical

760

regions that are highly interconnected (Huerta et al 1987, Stanton et al 1993, Stanton et al

761

1995). Visual latencies for 8Ar neurons were slower on average with a broader range than FEF,

762

and the tuning across the population was weaker in all groups (visual, motor, visuomotor)

763

compared to FEF. This led to lower overall decoding accuracy in 8Ar compared to FEF, due to

764

the relatively poorer direction selectivity and reliability of 8Ar neurons. Importantly, we observed

765

many 8Ar neurons changed their tuning between the visual and motor epochs, with a

766

sometimes striking misalignment between their preferences in these two periods of time that

767

was revealed by the dense spatial mapping protocol we employed. These results in 8Ar are

768

consistent with a transition from visual to motor representations that are instantiated with a

769

different mixture of neurons and activity. Evidence for a similar misalignment in preferences has

770

been previously reported in both FEF (Sajad et al 2015, Sajad et al 2016) and SC (Sadeh et al

771

2015) neurons in head unrestrained monkeys, where visual and movement responses most

772

strongly encode target and gaze, respectively. Our findings reflect an even more fundamental

773

misalignment between visual and motor target signals in some neurons.

774

The alignment of visual and motor signals in a neuronal population could be beneficial in

775

areas close to the motor output, as a direct mapping provides an efficient means for processing

776

information and generating a rapid movement. This circuitry seems to be implemented in SC,

777

where visual and movement activity is spatially aligned (Wurtz & Goldberg 1972). Given the

778

strong, topographic descending projections from FEF to SC (Stanton et al 1988), and the

779

observation that microstimulation in FEF elicits saccades at very low currents (Bruce et al

780

1985), such an alignment might also be expected in FEF. Indeed, when comparing FEF to 8Ar,

781

visual and motor signals were more aligned in FEF. Why might different strategies be

782

implemented in neighboring cortical regions that share involvement in important visuomotor

783

behavior? Despite their proximity and interarea connectivity profile, lesions to FEF and 8Ar have

784

resulted in differentiable deficits. In an anti-saccade task, for example, lesions in adjacent area

785

46 of PFC result in an increased percentage of errors (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al 1991, Ploner et

786

al 2005) while in FEF there is an unchanged error rate but an increased saccade latency

787

(Fukushima et al 1994). Another study which directly compared 8Ar and FEF during a distractor

788

task, found the FEF code was more generalizable (in agreement with our findings), and that the

789

8Ar code morphs to account for the distractor and still preserve information about the stimulus

790

(Parthasarathy et al 2017). A comparison of 8Ar with lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), an

791

oculomotor region strongly connected with FEF (Barbas & Mesulam 1981, Ferraina et al 2002,

792

Medalla & Barbas 2006), found relatively stable decoding of LIP activity over time and a more

793

dynamic 8Ar code that was more robust in the presence of distractors (Meyers et al 2018). Our

794

observations of the tuning properties of these two regions, and their differing alignment between

795

visual and motor codes, are consistent with 8Ar playing an important role in more flexible (and

796

less reflexive) visuomotor behaviors. One possible advantage of misalignment between the

797

code for a visual stimulus and for the execution of an eye movement could be to avoid one

798

signal contaminating the other, enabling an animal to resist moving its eyes to the location of a

799

salient visual stimulus.

Interpretation of dynamic selectivity & implications for working memory models

802

The first studies investigating the neural correlates of working memory in PFC observed

803

elevated spiking during the memory or delay period (persistent activity), and concluded this was

804

the source of the working memory signal (Fuster & Alexander 1971, Kubota & Niki 1971).

805

However, later work demonstrated many PFC neurons were transiently activated (Romo et al

806

1999, Warden & Miller 2007, Zaksas & Pasternak 2006) and at the population level, the code

807

appeared to be not persistent, but dynamic (Barak et al 2010, Meyers et al 2008, Stokes et al

808

2013). This body of work has contributed to a vigorous debate on how working memory is

809

represented in cortex, with some supporting a persistent model (Constantinidis et al 2018) and

810

others a dynamic model (Lundqvist et al 2018). While both groups agree activity during the

811

memory epoch is important and that there exists dynamic tuning at the level of single neurons,

812

they differ in what aspects of the activity are proposed to underlie the working memory signal.

813

One model suggests the working memory signal lies in a stable subspace, permitting a fixed

814

population readout despite the dynamics of individual neurons (Murray et al 2017). Others

815

suggest the dynamics are how the memory is encoded, either through an “activity silent”

816

mechanism (Stokes 2015) or through sparse coordinated spiking facilitated by oscillations in

817

local networks (Lundqvist et al 2016).

818

Our study remains agnostic to which is the appropriate model for working memory, and

819

instead focuses on potential origins of dynamic delay activity in individual neurons and

820

populations. We found that much of the dynamic evolution of activity in 8Ar could be explained

821

by the transition between representations of perceptual input and motor output that involve

822

different mixtures of neurons in the population. That is, the dynamics we observed were not

823

random fluctuations in the activity of individual neurons during the delay period, but rather the

824

transition between two separate spatial tuning functions for visual input and motor output. This

825

suggests the 8Ar code is stable but dynamic, a similar interpretation to Spaak et al (2017).

826

Because lateral PFC as a whole has been implicated in a wide range of sensory and cognitive

827

behavior (Tanji & Hoshi 2008), this leads to the speculation that apparent dynamics in 8Ar may

828

be explained by other task variables for which individual neurons are tuned, such as differing

829

sensory input and motor output modalities, reward anticipation, spatial attention, and more.

830

Dynamics at the level of individual neurons could be a natural consequence of the

831

implementation of such a flexible input and output structure instantiated in an overlapping

832

fashion in a population of neurons. In such an environment, stable population readouts might be

833

achieved in a manner that allows the stored memory item to be separated from the other

834

variables concurrently represented in the network (Murray et al 2017, Rigotti et al 2013).

835
836

Limitations of this study

837

The design of the current study incorporated two choices that are worthy of discussion

838

here. First, our targets were concentrated in the central 30° of visual angle (up to 15° saccade

839

amplitudes in 8 directions) in our 8Ar recordings, and fixed at 10° saccade amplitudes (8

840

directions) in FEF (a compromise eccentricity effective in driving responses for many neurons in

841

the region of our FEF electrode tracks). The seminal work measuring topography in 8Ar (Suzuki

842

& Azuma 1983) reported a medial-lateral gradient with smaller, more foveal RFs located

843

laterally and larger, more eccentric RFs located medially. In the region just dorsal to the

844

principal sulcus, where our arrays were implanted, they recorded from some neurons with RFs

845

that were centered beyond the extent of our target array. Thus, in some cases we may have

846

recorded from 8Ar neurons in which we found weak or absent tuning merely because we did not

847

present stimuli at the ideal location for each neuron. A hint of this can be seen in our response

848

maps (Figure 11), where some neurons exhibit tuned responses at the edges of the tested

849

region. Prior to establishing the target array tested here we did test each animal with larger

850

eccentricity targets (up to 20-25°), and did not observe qualitatively better tuning at the

851

population level, although some individual neurons did have tuning at those eccentricities.

852

Moreover, our findings closely mirror recent studies of 8Ar (Bullock et al 2017, Kiani et al 2015),

853

in terms of the implanted array locations and targets tested. Although the overall trend in this

854

previous work supports a medial-lateral gradient in RF eccentricity, the relatively weak

855

clustering of receptive field location is evident in the large scatter of RF centers we observed for

856

even neighboring electrodes (Figure 11). Overall, our experiments were performed with the goal

857

of identifying the response properties of neurons in 8Ar and FEF to a canonical set of stimuli for

858

which the population was tuned, not necessarily the ideal stimuli for every neuron in the

859

population. Thus, we cannot rule out that some of the differences we observed between 8Ar and

860

FEF were due to the choices we made in the target locations we tested or sampling differences

861

in our recordings of the two areas.

862

Our task was designed with a fixed 0.2 s pre-stimulus delay period prior to stimulus

863

onset, and a fixed post-stimulus delay period of 0.5 s (or 0.6 s for FEF). We chose this fixed

864

delay to maintain as constant a trial structure as possible, but this could have led to influence of

865

the post-saccadic response on the baseline firing rate prior to the stimulus, as well as

866

anticipatory saccade preparation toward the end of the delay period. With a much longer pre-

867

stimulus delay (0.65 s), Bullock et al (2017) also reported suppressive regions in the RF often

868

located opposite excitatory regions, and shifts in tuning between visual and perisaccadic

869

epochs. Furthermore, we found suppressive regions often did not directly oppose excitatory

870

regions (e.g., Figure 5A), making it unlikely that post-saccadic response alone could explain the

871

suppression. Because our delay period was fixed, subjects could have begun saccade planning

872

prior to the end of the delay period at fixation offset. This paradigm is known to contribute to

873

early buildup in motor preparatory activity in the superior colliculus (Dorris & Munoz 1998), and

874

thereby might have contributed to the rapid timescale over which we observed the transition

875

from a visual to motor code in the neuronal population. However, such an effect would not have

876

produced the pattern of excitatory and suppressive responses or the spatial shifts in RF tuning

877

that we observed.

878
879

Conclusions
Our results extend the literature in three key ways. First, due to the spatial resolution of
our task, we were able to with high fidelity map the visual and saccadic responses of

882

populations of 8Ar single neurons. We found a rich pattern of excitatory and suppressive

883

responses in 8Ar that represented the entire visual field through contralateral and ipsilateral

884

tuning. Second, the observed tuning shifted between epochs, quite often to the opposite

885

hemifield, indicating what may be perceived as random dynamics are actually the result of a

886

transition between a visual and motor code. Finally, we compared single neuron and population

887

level responses from 8Ar and FEF, highlighting the unique dynamics of individual neurons and

888

the population code in 8Ar even in a simple memory guided saccade paradigm. Taken together,

889

these results demonstrate rich, but separate, visual and saccadic spatial representations in PFC

890

underlie its flexible role in sensory and motor behavior.
