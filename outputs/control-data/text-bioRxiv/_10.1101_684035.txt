Abstract
Both geomagnetic and solar activity fluctuate over time and have been proposed to affect human
physiology. One physiological measurement that has been previously investigated in this
context, heart rate variability (HRV), has substantial health implications regarding the ability to
adapt to stressors and has been shown to be altered in many cardiovascular and neurological
disorders. Intriguingly, previous work found significant, strong correlations between HRV and
geomagnetic/solar activity. In an attempt to replicate these findings, we simultaneously measured
HRV from 20 healthy participants during a thirty-day period. In agreement with previous work,
we found several significant correlations between HRV and geophysical time-series. However,
after correction for autocorrelation, which is inherent in time-series, the only significant results
were an increase in very low frequency during higher local geomagnetic activity and a
geomagnetic anticipatory decrease in heart rate a day before higher global geomagnetic activity.
Both correlations were very low. The loss of most significant effects after this correction
suggests that previous findings may be a result of autocorrelation. A further note of caution is
required since our and the previous studies in the field do not correct for multiple comparisons
given the exploratory analysis strategy. We thus conclude that the effects of geomagnetic and
solar activity are (if present) most likely of very small effect size and question the validity of the
previous studies given the methodological concerns we have uncovered in our work.

Introduction
Heart rate variability (HRV), an analysis of the change in the time intervals of consecutive
heartbeats, is a well-established physiological measurement that serves as an indicator of disease
and mortality risk 1. Previous studies have suggested that a higher degree of HRV is indicative of
better health and lower risk for disease. For example, low HRV has been linked to myocardial
infarction 2, neuropathy 3, depression 4, and schizophrenia 5. Diverse factors can modulate HRV,
including genetic, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, lifestyle, and environmental factors
6

. Analysis of HRV in the frequency domain is also used to estimate the activity of both the

sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, though it has also been found to be dependent
on heart rate and other confounding factors and thus possibly not necessarily a valid measure of
autonomic activity 7.
Recent studies found that the change in the magnetic field of the earth caused by solar activity is
significantly correlated with HRV 8,9. These studies were motivated by the relationship between
cardiovascular health, specifically the occurrence of myocardial infarction, and both solar and
geomagnetic activity 10,11. Yet, the relationship between HRV and geomagnetic activity remains
unclear since several studies found conflicting results

12,13

. Here, we attempted to replicate a

previous study that showed strong and significant correlations between HRV and solar
geomagnetic activity in a small pilot study

8,9

. We found significant correlations between

solar/geomagnetic activity and HRV components before correction for the autocorrelation
inherent to time-series. However, we only found an increase in very low frequency HRV
component and an anticipatory effect in heart rate with geomagnetic activity after correction for
autocorrelation. Both effects were small; thus, previous studies have likely overestimated the
effects due to the lack of stringent statistical analysis.

Results
Measurements of HRV and geomagnetic activity
We recruited 20 healthy participants and collected their 30-day (720 hours) longitudinal HRV
data. Data from 19 participants were analyzed (1 dropout). We calculated heart rate (HR),
standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), HRV triangular index (HRVTi), square root of the
mean squared differences of successive RR intervals (RMSSD) as HRV time components. For
HRV frequency components, very low-frequency power (VLF; 0.0033-0.04Hz), low-frequency
power (LF; 0.04-0.15Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.4Hz), LF/HF ratio (LF/HF), and
total power (VLF+LF+HF) were calculated. For measurements of geomagnetic activity, the K
index and Ap index were obtained. In addition, F10.7 index was obtained as solar activity with
1-hour intervals.

Correlations of HRV components
All HRV components were significantly correlated (Table 1, p < 0.001, both with and without
the correction for autocorrelation). Measurements of overall variability were all positively
correlated with each other and negatively correlated with heart rate. Each frequency-band
percentage was inversely correlated to the others, an obvious relationship due to the shared
denominator in their calculation. Total power was positively related to each measure of overall
variability and HFratio (%), and negatively related to LFratio (%) and VLFratio (%), indicating that
the HF band was responsible for the increase in the total power spectrum.

Geomagnetic and solar activity
Ap index is a linear scale indicating global geomagnetic activity; values below 7 indicate a quiet
period, values from 7 to 48 indicate an active or unsettled period, values from 48 to 80 indicate a
minor storm, and values from 80 to 130 indicate a major storm. There were three notable
geomagnetic events during the data collection period (Figure 1). The period 10/24-10/27 and
11/20-11/22 had small peaks in disturbance levels, peaking at 39 and 48 respectively, indicating
periods of unsettled to a borderline minor storm of geomagnetic activity. A much larger event is
noticeable in the 11/06-11/09 period, with a peak of 94 on 11/08, indicating that a major
geomagnetic storm occurred. We also used the K index (Boulder magnetometer), which
represents a semi-logarithmic 0-9 scale indicating local geomagnetic activity with 9 being the

most activity. Kp index is an average of all global K indices, proving a semi-logarithmic measure
of global activity. Values of each index varied from 0-6 during the time period of data collection,
with the maximum of 6 occuring on 11/08, the same day as the Ap index maximum value
(Figure 2). Unsurprisingly, the Ap index was strongly correlated to both the K index (r=.77,
p<.001) and the Kp index (r=.86, p<.001); the K and Kp indices were also strongly correlated to
each other (r=.85, p<.001). In addition, solar F10.7 index is presented, which exhibited the
lowest value around 11/8 (Figure 1). F10.7 index stands for solar radio flux at wavelength of
10.7 cm and is a direct and reliable measure of solar activity 14. F10.7 is measured in solar flux
units (sfu) and is often used as a proxy for other measures of solar activity.

Relationship of HRV components with geomagnetic activity
Uncorrected and corrected for autocorrelation correlation coefficients between HRV components
and geomagnetic activity are presented (Tables 2-4). We found significant correlations of Ap
index with HRVTi, VLFratio, LFratio, and HFratio before correction but no significant correlations
between Ap index and HRV components after correction (all p>0.05, Table 2). The K-index is
significantly correlated with VLFratio and LFratio before correction, and the VLFratio correlation
remained significant after correction, such that VLFratio increased as the local geomagnetic Kindex increased (r=.06, p<.05, Table 3). We also found significant correlations of Kp-index with
HR, RMSSD, VLFratio, LFratio, HFratio, LF/HF, and total power before correction, but no
significant correlations after correction (all p>0.05, Table 4).
A previous study 8 computed correlations after dividing the recording timeline into three distinct
periods based on the occurrence of a geomagnetic storm, finding different relationships during
the storm than before and after. To investigate this proposed phenomenon, we divided the Ap
index values into three groups. The first group was the bottom 10th percentile of Ap index values;
all Ap index values here were 0, so this group was not further analyzed. The second group
consisted of Ap index values between the 10th and 90th percentile (1-21), while the third group
consisted of the top 90th percentile (22-94). We calculated correlations between HRV
components and AP index values for the two latter groups (Table 5). We found significant
correlations between Ap index (top 90th percentile) and HRVTi, Ap index (10th-90th percentile)
and HRVTi, VLFratio, LFratio, for uncorrected values. However, we found no significant
correlations for corrected values.

Time-dependent relationship
To test for the potential presence of a time-lag between geomagnetic activity and change in
HRV, we computed correlations between HRV components and corresponding Ap-index values
1 day after (anticipatory) and Ap-index values 1 day before (consequential). This analysis was
motivated by previous studies

8,9

that discussed a potential “anticipatory effect”, which may

relate to the fact that changes in solar activity take several days to modulate the geomagnetic
field due to the time solar wind takes to reach the earth. In this analysis, we found a significant
anticipatory relationship between heart rate and Ap index which survived the correction for
autocorrelation of time-series; heart rate was negatively correlated with geomagnetic activity for
corrected values (Table 6, r=-.09, p=.03). To further explore this significant correlation between
hear rate and Ap index (anticipatory), we calculated correlations for each individual participant,
again with and without correction for autocorrelation. Out of the 19 participants, 14 participants
exhibited a negative correlation. In terms of significance testing, there were eight individuals
with a significant correlation (all negative values) before correction for autocorrelation and three
of these individuals exhibited a significant correlation after correction (Table 7).

Relationship of HRV with solar activity
For solar activity (F10.7 index), we found significant correlations between F10.7 index and
SDNN, HRVTi, LFratio, HFpower, HFratio. However, all significant effects were lost after correction
for autocorrelation (Table 8). Of note, F10.7 index is a more direct measure of several solar
processes and does not have a time-lag that Ap index may exhibit, which reflects changes in the
geomagnetic field as a result of solar processes.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated how geomagnetic/solar activity affects human HRV. We collected
720-hour HRV data from 19 participants and obtained geomagnetic and solar activity. Previous
studies found significant, strong correlations between HRV and geomagnetic activity

8,9

In

seeming agreement with this previous work, we also found significant correlations between the
two type of variables before correction for the autocorrelation inherent to time-series. After
correction for autocorrelation, however, we only found a significant correlation between very
low-frequency power of HRV and K index and a significant anticipatory effect on heart rate with
Ap index. Our results suggest that previous findings may be a consequence of autocorrelation
instead of a true relationship between geomagnetism and HRV. We thus strongly recommend
that correct statistical analyses should be performed when investigating this relationship.
Inspired by previous findings of time-dependent effects of geomagnetic activity on HRV 8,12, we
also examined potential relationships with an offset of one day in both anticipatory or
consequential manners. As a result, we found a significant relationship of an anticipatory effect
such that heart rate was lower the day before higher geomagnetic activity, though the correlation
was weak (r=-.09). Another study that examined time-dependent effects did not find this
relationship to be significant

12

. While this result possibly warrants further examination due to

the various health abnormalities in which geomagnetism has been implicated

12,15,16

, we note the

possibility of a false positive considering the small effect size and the large amount of
relationships tested to find this single result. For this effect to exist, the body would require a
mechanism to predict geomagnetic storms. It is possible that the body detects abnormalities in
geomagnetic fields before a sharp increase, or directly responds to changes in solar activity that
reaches the earth before the factors that modulate the geomagnetic field. However, we would
expect a significant relationship with solar activity to have existed if this was the case. Before
further mechanistic speculation or examination, we recommend additional study replication, as
this is the first study to find this specific effect.
As the intensity of geomagnetism varies with latitude, we also correlated HRV indices with the
local geomagnetic K index from the Boulder magnetometer. After correction for autocorrelation,
we found a relationship between the local K index and VLFratio such that the VLF band was
stronger during stronger local geomagnetic activity. This finding may have clinical implications,

as low VLF power has been more linked to all-cause mortality than the LF and HF bands

17

,

though we again note the weak correlation (r=.06) and the possibility of a false positive.
As a secondary focus, we report the effects of solar activity on HRV components. Similar to
geomagnetic activity, solar activity has previously been correlated to SDNN, total power, LF,
HF, VLF, and the LF/HF ratio 8,9. Again contrasting the results of previous studies, we found no
significant relationships between HRV components and solar index F10.7. It is possible no
significant effects were found due to the 20-participant sample size or the 1-month recording
period. A study

8

reported significant relationships with very strong effect sizes, with some R2

values, such as the one between LF power and F10.7 index, reaching as high as 0.76. Results
presented here vastly differ from this previous research, as we only found one significant
relationship, which was small in magnitude. Noting the multitude of significant correlations we
found before accounting for autocorrelation, the difference between this study and previous
studies likely stems from the choice of the procedure to determine statistical significance. Time
series correlated against each other may inherently be correlated as subsequent data points are
dependent on each other, and the possible impact of this effect on studies examining
environmental effects on HRV was pointed out in a Discover Magazine blog 18. Since all but one
correlation lost significance after autocorrelation was removed, this study suggests that there is
little to no relation between solar or geomagnetic activity and HRV, and contrasting findings are
likely a result of the interdependence of data analyzed. It is unlikely that our test for
autocorrelation erroneously removed significant relationships, as all correlations between HRV
components (Table 1) survived the autocorrelation correction.
It is worth noting that there is an entire body of research on what is referred to as heliobiology.
The full discussion of this literature is beyond the scope of this paper since many of the studies
appear to exhibit serious flaws in methodology and reports 19. The potential mechanism of action
remains speculative. In addition, there are other complicating factors in this research field, which
include that the 11-year solar cycle makes studies hard to compare. For example, our study was
performed near the nadir of the current solar cycle (near end of Cycle 24). Also, geographic
latitude is likely to matter, and results may strongly depend on the latitude of the study site.
Finally, it cannot be excluded that there are strongly differing levels of sensitivities across
otherwise homogenous study populations. Our participant-by-participant analysis appears to
support such individual differences in sensitivities to geomagnetic perturbations.

As any scientific study, our work has several limitations. First, larger sample sizes are desirable
and warranted based on our results. Secondly, we tested numerous relationships and the few
results that were significant at the p < .05 level were weak correlation values (r<.09), possibly
indicating that the results are false positives. Thirdly, we have not collected any other
psychological or biological variables which may explain the individual differences we found for
the anticipatory relationship between heart rate and geomagnetic activity.
Overall, our study suggests that there is little to no effect of solar or geomagnetic activity on
heart rate variability, with the only significant relationships being an anticipatory decrease in
heart rate before increased global geomagnetic activity and an increase in very low-frequency
power during periods of higher local geomagnetic activity. As in any research field, a single
study does not provide final answers and more studies are warranted given the number of
epidemiological studies that implicate solar/geomagnetic activity in human health.

Methods
Participants
We enrolled a total of 20 healthy participants over the age of 18 into this thirty-day longitudinal
observational study. We recruited from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill area.
Exclusion criteria included neurological or cardiovascular conditions, medication associated with
these conditions, as well as pregnancy and daily meditation, which have been shown to affect
HRV

20,21

. This study was approved by the Biomedical Institutional Review Board of the

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (IRB # 17-2397). All participants provided written
informed consent before participating in the study. All methods were performed in accordance
with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

Materials
Each participant was provided with a commercially-available Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 (Firstbeat
Technologies Oy, Jyväskylä, Finland) heart rate monitor and electrodes as well as the
accompanying Firstbeat Uploader software (https://www.firstbeat.com). The monitor is worn on
the torso with one electrode attached to the skin below the right collarbone, and the other
electrode attached to the left ribcage; we instructed participants to move the electrode each day
in a rotation of a few different spots in order to minimize skin irritation. The device
automatically starts recording once both electrodes are attached, stores data internally, and has a
battery life of approximately six days. Data were uploaded by participants through the Firstbeat
software and REDCap (www.project-redcap.org), a secure online data collection portal for
clinical research 22.

Procedure
After recruitment, participants first uploaded a short sample recording to ensure that they were
able to follow the study procedure. Once all these “practice samples” were obtained, participants
were told the dates of the thirty-day data collection period, which was from October 24th, 2017 to
November 22nd, 2017. Participants were instructed to begin wearing the monitor the night before
the first day of the recording period. Participants were asked to wear the heart rate monitor
nearly 24h/day and to only take it off for showering or other events that could cause water or
other damage to the device. Participants uploaded data every 4 days; this pace allowed for

participants to charge their device before the battery drained and for the research team to
properly monitor data upload progress. If participants failed to consistently upload data, they
were contacted by a member of the research team to provide data for the missing days. To upload
their data, participants first loaded their data onto their computer through the Firstbeat uploader
program and subsequently used a queue of surveys from REDCap for upload. In each survey,
participants indicated the date(s) of the recording(s) and any time periods that they did not wear
the monitor. They were also reminded to charge the monitor.
Data collection concluded after 30 days. At this time, we contacted participants to ensure that
they had uploaded all collected data and to schedule a time to collect the device and provide
compensation. To encourage participants to wear the monitor as often as possible, compensation
included a flat $50 payment as well as a maximum bonus payment of $200 per participant. The
amount of bonus a participant received was based on the amount of data provided, with
compensation exponentially increasing with the amount of data provided.

Environmental measurements
The K (Boulder) and Ap indices were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s

(NOAA)

National

Center

for

Environmental

Information

(https://www.ncei.noaa.gov) and are reported in 3-hour intervals. The K index was obtained from
Kyoto University’s Data Analysis Center for Geomagnetism and Space Magnetism
(http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html). The F10.7 index was obtained from NASA’s
Omniweb Data Explorer (https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov) and is reported in 1-hour intervals.

Data analysis
For 12 of the 20 participants analyzed, there were various clearly incorrect timestamps, which
occurred when the devices reset to their factory restoration timestamp in 2015 for unknown
reason. If possible, these times were corrected based on several identifiers, including relation to
adjacent files, file upload timestamps, comparison between gaps in data and participantidentified times of not wearing the monitor, as well as other clues. Only files for which the
correct time was determinable with high confidence were included (allowable margin of error:
15 minutes). Timestamps that could not be confidently corrected were not included in analysis.
Eight participants had no errors in timestamps, nine participants had incorrect timestamps limited

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/684035; this version posted June 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

to the first five days or less, two participants had nearly half their data with incorrect timestamps,
and one participant was not included in data analysis due to early withdrawal (reason: skin
irritation). All time points for each participant were then concatenated into a single series and
corrected to account for gaps in the time series created when participants did not wear the
monitor. These times were finally adjusted to match UTC time in order to compare them to the
environmental data.
RR interval data was first processed in Kubios HRV Premium, ver. 3.0.2

23

. The automatic

artefact correction method in Kubios was used to correct for ectopic, too long, or too short beats
by interpolating new RR values. Missed beats were corrected by adding new R-wave occurrence
times and extra beats were corrected by removing extra R-wave detection and recalculating RR
interval series. Further manual inspection of the RR series indicated that few artefacts were not
removed and we thus removed RR values above 2.5s or below .2s.
Time and frequency domain analyses were completed in MATLAB R2016b (Mathworks,
Natick, MA). Recordings were first split into 5-minute intervals as comparison of HRV between
recordings of different lengths in not meaningful 6. Analysis was only completed for intervals
containing data for at least 270 of the 300 seconds, and these results were then averaged into
either 1-hour or 3-hour segments for comparison to environmental data. For time domain
analysis, mean heart rate (HR), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), HRV triangular
index (HRVTi), and square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals
(RMSSD) indices were calculated. Standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) results
were not included, as this index is very similar to SDNN with 5-minute recordings. For
frequency analysis, very low-frequency power (VLF; 0.0033-0.04Hz), low-frequency power
(LF; 0.04-0.15Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.4Hz), LF/HF ratio (LF/HF), and total
power (VLF+LF+HF) were obtained. Subsequently, a 24-hour moving average was used to
remove circadian rhythms from HRV components.
We performed the Repeated measures correlation (RMC) analysis, a form of ANCOVA 24. RMC
produces a common within-subject correlation effect between two variables. Overall, this
method produces a single correlational value indicating how two variables are correlated. RMC
was also used to correlate time-series of HRV components between participants. This allowed
the HRV of participants to be compared to each other without a dependence on time, testing the
synchronization of HRV over the duration of the measurement period.

Correction for autocorrelation
When two time-series are being correlated with each other, the obtained results are possibly
artificially inflated since individual samples of time-series are not independent due to inherent
autocorrelation. To account for this, HRV data were stripped of their temporal structure by
shuffling the data while keeping the original environmental data structure in place, and running
RMC on this new dataset. Data with time points of 3-hours were shuffled in groups of 5 time
points, and data with time points of 1-hour were shuffled in groups of 12 time points. This
approach creates shuffled time-series that still exhibit most of the autocorrelation between
neighboring samples but lack the temporal relationship with the other time-series it is correlated
with. For each correlation, data were shuffled 1000 times, producing 1000 new RMC results.
Empirical p values that have accounted for autocorrelation were then obtained with the equation:



1
1

where,
r = amount of shuffled RMC values that are greater than the original RMC value
n = amount of shuffles (1000)
This method was used to calculate the p-value for every statistic presented. We report both raw
and shuffle-corrected p-values since previous studies did not perform this correction for
autocorrelation.
