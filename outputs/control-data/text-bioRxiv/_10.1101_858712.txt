Abstract:

30

As an integrator of molecular pathways, mTOR has been associated with

31

diseases including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative

32

disorders as autism, schizophrenia, and Huntington’s disease. An important

33

brain area involved in all these diseases is the striatum. However, the

34

mechanisms behind how mTOR is involved in striatal physiology and its relative

35

role in distinct neuronal populations in these striatal-related diseases still

36

remain to be clarified.

37

Taking advantage of the D1-mTOR KO mice (males), we combined behavioural,

38

biochemical, electrophysiological and morphological analysis aiming to

39

untangle the role of mTOR in direct pathway striatal projection neurons

40

(dMSNs) and how this would impact on striatal physiology.

41

Our results indicate deep behavioural changes in absence of mTOR in dMSNs

42

such as decreased spontaneous locomotion, impaired social interaction and

43

repetitive behaviour. These were accompanied by a Kv1.1-induced increase in

44

the fast phase of afterhyperpolarization and decreased distal spines density

45

that were mechanistically independent of protein synthesis but dependent of

46

RhoA activity.

47

These results identify mTOR RhoA signaling as an important regulator of

48

striatal functions through an intricate mechanism involving RhoA and

49

culminating in Kv1.1 overfunction, which could be targeted to treat striatal-

50

related mTORopathies.

Introduction

55

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that acts

56

as a central sensor of cell growth and metabolism, and regulates neuronal

57

morphogenesis through the precise control of protein synthesis (1-3). mTOR

58

serves as a core component of two different complexes, mTORC1 (sensitive to

59

rapamycin) and mTORC2, which control distinct cellular processes. The

60

stimulation of several G-protein coupled receptors such as D1R –but not D2R–

61

can trigger mTORC1 activation (4). Upon activation, mTORC1 promotes

62

protein synthesis by phosphorylating translation regulators, including p70S6K

63

and 4EBP1 (5, 6). In addition to its control in mRNA translation, mTORC1 has

64

been described as a postsynaptic voltage sensor, controlling the excitability of

65

neurons (7). In addition, RhoA, which recently has been mechanistically

66

connected to autistic-like behaviour (with marked modifications on locomotion

67

and social skills) in mice after the deletion of the TAOK2 gene (8) and an

68

important mediator of protein recycling in mammalian cells, is connected to the

69

activity of the mTORC1 pathway (9). The second complex, mTORC2, has a

70

lower sensitivity to rapamycin and its activation results in increased

71

phosphorylation of Akt at the serine 473 site (10). It controls cell survival and

72

the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton, which among others have been implicated

73

in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines, including those in MSNs (11-13).

74

In general, monogenic disorders associated with the mTOR signalling

75

pathway, or “mTORopathies”, match the physiological complexity and

76

heterogeneity of the mTOR function. These are commonly divided into i)

77

neurodevelopmental, such as some forms of autism (14, 15) and epileptic

78

encephalopathy (16), ii) psychiatric, including schizophrenia (17) and major

79

depressive disorder (18) and iii) neurodegenerative disorders, such as

80

Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease (19-21). Many of these

81

disorders are known to have striatum malfunction as a major factor of their

82

development (22-26).

83

The striatum is the gateway to the basal ganglia and receives converging

84

sensory, emotional and cognitive information via cortical and thalamic inputs.

85

These glutamatergic synapses act on two major striatal populations of medium

86

spiny neurons: the striatonigral cells (dMSNs), which give rise to the direct

87

pathway that mainly promotes motor output, and the striatopallidal neurons

88

(iMSNs; dopamine D2R/A2aR-expressing neurons), which belong to the indirect

89

pathway, conventionally classified as inhibiting motor output.

90

Given that mTOR controls the signalling associated with striatal function

91

here we deleted mTOR specifically from D1R-expressing MSNs (dMSNs) and

92

examined animals’ behaviour, as well as cell physiological and morphological

93

properties. We found that the deletion of mTOR in dMSNs induces behavioural

94

impairments associated to selective Kv1.1-channel mediated changes in

95

dMSNs electrophysiological properties, the latter also noted in rapamycin-

96

treated slices. Those observations also coincided with decreased density of

97

spines along distal dendrites of dMSNs. These changes were independent of

98

protein synthesis, but sensitive to the RhoA-dependent control of K+ channels

99

recycling.

Animals
The mTOR floxed (mTORLoxP/LoxP) mice used in the present study were

105

described

106

mTORLoxP/LoxP mice with heterozygous PGK-Cre+/- mice(28) and the resulting

107

PGK-Cre-/- mTORΔ/wt mice were crossed with mTORLoxP/LoxP mice. The Cre-

108

mediated deletion of mTOR in dMSNs was obtained by crossing Drd1-Cre

109

heterozygous mice(29) and mTORΔ/LoxP mice. mTOR D1-driven knockouts

110

(Drd1-Cre+/- mTORΔ/LoxP) and control littermates (mTORΔ/LoxP) were obtained

111

by crossing Drd1-Cre+/- mTORΔ/LoxP mice with mTORLoxP/LoxP mice.

expressing Cre recombinase only. Drd1-Cre+/- mTORΔ/LoxP Rosa26dTomato+/-

116

were used as D1-mTOR KO and control mice are Drd1-Cre+/- mTORΔ /wt

117

Rosa26dTomato+/-. All mice were of C57BL6J genetic background. All

118

procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the

119

Institutional Animal Care Committee and were approved by the local ethics

120

committees (ULB Pôle Santé – Protocol 551N). 2 to 4 mice were housed

121

together, with ad libitum access to food and tap water, temperature: 21°C,

122

humidity: 50%, light/dark cycle 12h/12h. Only males were used for the

123

experiments.

The striata of mice were rapidly dissected as described (31) on an ice-

129

cooled disc, sonicated in 300 μl 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and boiled

130

at 100◦ C for 10 min. In each experiment, samples from all animal groups were

131

processed in parallel to minimize inter-assay variations. Protein quantification

132

and western blots were performed as described (32, 33). All the information

133

about the antibodies, suppliers, dilutions and references are summarized in the

134

Supplementary Table 1.

137
138

Puromycin incorporation in whole striatal lysates
Puromycin incorporation method was performed as described (32, 34).

139

Briefly, the striata of mice were rapidly dissected and homogenized using 20

140

up-and-down strokes of a pre-chilled glass homogenizer with 800 μl of

141

polysomal buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH = 7.8, 240 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2,

142

250 mM D-sucrose, 2% Triton X-100, 20 μl/ml emetine, 5 mM DTT, 100 U/ml

143

RNasin (Promega) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Samples were

144

centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 × g at 4◦C and supernatant was incubated with

145

100 μg/ml of puromycin for 10 min at 4◦C and then boiled for 10 min at 100◦C.

146

Spontaneous locomotor activity

147

Horizontal and vertical activity was measured for a period of 120 minutes

148

in a circular corridor (Imetronic, Pessac, France) as previously described (35).

149

Counts for horizontal activity were incremented by consecutive interruption of

150

two adjacent beams placed at a height of 1 cm per 90o sector of the corridor

151

and counts for vertical activity (rearings) as interruption of beams placed at a

152

height of 7.5 cm along the corridor (mice stretching upwards).

154

Mice were placed on a rotarod apparatus (Columbus Instruments, USA)

155

accelerating from 4 to 40 rpm in 5 min. Trials began by placing the mouse on

156

the rod and beginning rotation. Each trial ended when the mouse fell off the

157

rod, and latency was recorded. Mice were tested for four trials a day (1-min

158

inter-trial interval) for 3 consecutive days (36).

159

Elevated plus maze

160

Anxiety-like behaviour was measured as previously described (37). The

161

elevated plus maze test was performed in a black Plexiglas apparatus with four

162

arms (29 cm long, 5 cm wide) set in cross from a neutral central square (5 cm

163

x 5 cm) elevated 40 cm above the floor.

164

Marble burying test

165

Repetitive behaviour was assessed by marble burying activity. Mice

166

were placed in a clean cage (46 × 20 × 14 cm) with 4 cm sawdust bedding

167

overlayed by 20 glass marbles (15 mm diameter) equidistant in a 4 × 5

168

arrangement. Mice were allowed to explore the cage for 20 min and the number

169

of marbles buried (>50% of the marble covered by the bedding) was counted.

170

Three-chamber social approach

171

A three-chamber arena was used to assess sociability, preference for

172

social novelty, and social memory as previously (38). The discrimination index

173

for sociability was calculated as (time exploring Stranger#1 – time exploring

174

empty wire cage) / (total exploration time) * 100 and social novelty as (time

175

exploring Stranger#2 – time exploring Stranger#1) / (total exploration time) *

176

100.

177

Brain slice preparation and Patch-clamping

178

All the procedures were similar to those described before(39). 3 months-

179

old animals were used for these experiments. Coronal striatal slices were left

180

in the chamber at 34°C to recover for at least 1 h before recording. In the set of

181

experiments involving rapamycin (200 nM, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) slices

182

were let to recover in rapamycin-infused aCSF or DMSO (control group) for 75

183

min as described before(40). In the case of anisomycin (50 μM, Sigma-Aldrich,

184

Germany) protocol, rapamycin was added to aCSF 30 min after anisomycin

185

and 75 additional min were counted. C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium

186

Botulinum (0.5 µg/ml, Cytoskeleton Inc., #CT04) was infused in aCSF for 4 h

187

before any combined treatment following instructions of the manufacturer.

188

After the recovery period, slices were placed in a submersion-type

189

chamber at room temperature with 2 ml/min rate of aCSF saturated with 95%

190

O2 and 5% CO2. Biocytin (0.5%) was added aiming 3D reconstruction of

191

patched-neurons. Access resistance, membrane resistance and membrane

192

capacitance were extracted from voltage-clamp recordings by analysing current

193

relaxation induced by a 10 mV step change from a holding potential of -80 mV

194

as described previously (41). Intrinsic excitability was investigated in current-

195

clamp by setting the resting membrane potential at -80 mV and injecting 1 s

196

depolarizing steps (from 0 to 250 pA in 10 pA increments). The fast phase of

197

afterhyperpolarisation potentials (fAHP) was calculated as described (42).

198

Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, 50 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and

199

Dendrotoxin-K (30 nM, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), stromatoxin (Alomone,

200

Jerusalem, Israel) or Phrixotoxin-2 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) were infused

201

into the aCSF solution and recordings performed 10 minutes after. The

202

concentration of TEA was based on a previous work of Hadley and colleagues

203

(43). All recordings were analyzed using the IgorPro® 6.3 software

204

(Wavemetrics, PO, USA).

205

Immunohistochemistry and 3D-reconstruction

206

We used a slightly modified version of the protocol used before in our

207

laboratory (44). Slices were incubated overnight at 4°C in paraformaldehyde

208

solution (4% in 0.01 mM PBS). After fixation, slices were washed 3 times in

209

PBS and incubated in PBS-0.1% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) for 2

210

h under gently shaking. Slices were then transferred in solution containing

211

streptavidin-coupled Alexa Fluor 488 (1/200 in PBS-0.1% TritonX-100 solution,

212

Jackson ImmunoResearch, BA, USA) or NL557 (1/3000 in PBS-0.1% TritonX-

213

100 solution, R&D Systems, Germany) for 1 h under shaking.

214

After the acquisition, the image was deconvoluted (Huygens-II; Scientific

215

Volume Imaging, Netherlands) and the 3D image rendered. Reconstruction of

216

the dendritic arborization of the neurons was done by the computer-aided

217

filament tracing function in the 3D image analysis software Imaris (Bitplane,

218

Ireland). A complementary manual tracing strategy adjusted the automatic

219

reconstruction. Total dendritic arborization reconstruction allowed computation

220

of dendrite branching, dendrite segment length analysis, total spine number

221

and spine density in proximal (<50 μm distance from the soma) or distal

222

dendritic domains (>50 μm distance from the soma).

227

All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and the

228

choice of the statistical tests were guided by the Shapiro–Wilk’s W normality

229

test. If parametric, the Student´s t-test or the analysis of variance (ANOVA)

230

followed by the Tukey test was performed. Non-parametric tests such as the

231

Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis were followed by the Dunn´s test. All tests

232

were performed using the Graph Pad Prism 6 software package (Graph Pad,

233

San Diego, CA, USA). The accepted level of significance for the tests was P ≤

234

0.05. All descriptive statistical results are summarized in the Supplementary

analysis. As expected, a significant reduction of mTOR expression was

245

observed in the striatum of D1-mTOR KO (Drd1 Cre+/- mTORΔ /LoxP) compared

246

to control littermates (mTORΔ /LoxP) (Figure 1A,F). Additionally, decreased

247

phosphorylation levels of two major downstream effectors of mTORC1 namely

248

p70S6K (phosphorylated at threonine 389) (Figure 1B,F) and 4EBP1

249

(phosphorylated at threonine 37/46) (Figure 1C,F) were observed in the

250

striatum of D1-mTOR KO mice. In contrast, no difference was observed in the

251

phosphorylation state of Akt at serine 473 suggesting that mTORC2 activity

(6).

We

evaluated

252

was not altered in the striatum (Figure 1D,F). Moreover, puromycin-based

253

assay revealed that global protein synthesis was not altered in the striatum of

254

D1-mTOR KO mice (Figure 1E).

255

Since it has been previously described that the manipulation of upstream

256

and downstream mTOR regulators affect locomotor activity (45), we evaluated

257

the voluntary locomotor activity of D1-mTOR KO and control littermates. Our

258

results revealed that the selective deletion of mTOR in dMSNs significantly

259

impaired spontaneous locomotor behaviour (Figure 1G). However, to note is

260

the difference in the locomotor curves over time indicating similar locomotor

261

activity during the first 20 minutes of analysis but exponential decay kinetics in

262

mTOR-KO mice. Figure 1H shows the quantification of the total ambulation

263

during a 120 minutes session corroborating the decreased locomotion in D1-

264

mTOR KO mice and reveals a decrease in vertical activity in the same group

265

when compared to control mice. This reduced locomotor activity was not

266

associated with increased anxiety levels since no alterations were observed in

267

the elevated-plus maze (Figures 1J and K). Finally, animals were submitted to

268

the marble burying task and we found that D1-mTOR KO buried less marbles

269

than control mice, indicating altered repetitive behaviour (Figure 1L).

270

Interestingly, D1-mTOR KO displayed similar motor performance as littermates

271

on the rotarod suggesting that not all repetitive motor routines were affected

272

(Figure 1I).

273

Next, we decided to evaluate the sociability and social novelty behaviour

274

in both groups. Results gathered from the three-chamber social apparatus

275

revealed decreased sociability in D1-mTOR KO mice in comparison to control

276

littermates (Figure 1M) accompanied by a reduction of the total exploration time

277

(Figure 1N). Social novelty might have been also impaired in D1-mTOR KO

278

given that there was a trend in the time exploring/total time ratio (Figure 1O)

279

and a significant decrease in the total exploration time (Figure 1P) was

280

observed.

281

Together, our results indicate that the deletion of mTOR in dMSNs

282

reduces voluntary locomotion accompanied by disturbances in repetitive and

283

impaired social behaviour without modifications in the anxiety profile of mice.

284
285

Inactivation of voltage-gated potassium channels 1.1 (Kv1.1) rescues the

286

neurophysiological abnormalities induced by genetic or pharmacological

287

mTOR inhibition

288

The striatal encoding of locomotor activity is causally connected to the

289

excitable properties and activity of dMSNs and iMSNs(46). The control of

290

excitability exerted by mTOR relates to the intimate control of voltage-gated

291

potassium channels (Kvs) (47). The Kv1 family are important components

292

controlling the somatodendritic excitability in sensory neurons (48) and MSNs

293

(49). Importantly, mTOR has been shown to dampen excitability by increasing

294

Kv1.1 channel function in hippocampal neurons (7, 40). Hence, we

295

hypothesized that some of the behavioural alterations observed in D1-mTOR

296

KO mice are caused by changes in electrophysiological properties. We

297

therefore carried out the electrophysiological characterization of dMSNs in

298

presence and absence of mTOR. First, we observed that resting membrane

299

potentials (RMP) were similar between groups (Figure 2A). Interestingly, a 40%

300

reduction in capacitance (proportional to the cell size) was observed in dMSNs

301

lacking

302

electrophysiological data also identified an increase in the amplitude of the fast

mTOR

as

compared

to

control

dMSNs

(Figure

303

phase of afterhyperpolarization (fAHP) (Figure 2C). To probe for a direct and

304

acute control by mTOR of these electrophysiological changes, we employed an

305

in vitro protocol where slices from both genotypes were submitted to an

306

incubation with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin prior the recordings, as

307

described before (40). We first confirmed the lack of modification in the RMP in

308

the presence of rapamycin or DMSO (Figure 2D). Rapamycin did not affect the

309

cell capacitance either in control or mTOR-KO dMSNs (Figure 2E). Acute in

310

vitro exposure to rapamycin in control mice phenocopied the higher amplitude

311

of the fAHP of dMSNs in D1-mTOR KO. In contrast, rapamycin exposure had

312

no effect on the enhanced fAHPs of dMSNs in D1-mTOR KO (Figure 2F). We

313

also computed other active properties of dMSNs such as action potential (AP)

314

threshold, amplitude, duration, depolarization and hyperpolarization rate and

315

input-output curve (data not shown) without any differences between groups.

316

To test if this increase in the amplitude of fAHP was due to a higher

317

density/function of potassium channels in D1-mTOR KO and rapamycin-treated

318

control dMSNs we first used low concentrations of TEA (a non-selective Kv

319

channels blocker) and Dendrotoxin-K (a highly selective Kv1.1 channel

320

324

mTORΔ/wt Rosa26dTomato+/- dMSNs, the rapamycin-induced increase in the

325

amplitude of fAHP is re-normalized by the non-selective blockade of Kv-

326

channels and the selective blockade of Kv1.1 channels. The same analysis in

327

amplitude of the fAHP is promptly reduced by TEA and Dendrotoxin-K to similar

329

level than in control dMSNs in basal conditions. The effects were similar in

330

DMSO- and rapamycin-treated mTOR-KO dMSNs confirming again the

331

absence of additive effects. To further check for additional channels that could

332

be involved in the fAHP changes, we used the in vitro rapamycin protocol in

333

control dMSNs and recorded in the presence of Stromatoxin (a selective Kv4.2

334

blocker) and Phrixotoxin (a blocker of Kv4.1 and Kv4.3). After building the

335

respective inhibition curves to set the concentrations of both drugs to be used

336

(respectively Figures 2I and J) using the same rationale as for the Dendrotoxin-

337

K, our electrophysiological analysis indicated that Kv4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 channels

338

were not involved in the mTOR-induced increase in the fAHP amplitude (Figure

339

2K). The electrophysiological analysis indicates deep modifications in mTOR-

340

354

rapamycin has no impact on this parameter. However, both the genetic deletion

355

of mTOR in dMSNs and the pharmacological blockade of mTOR by rapamycin

356

in control animals decreased the total number of spines in dMSNs (Figure 3E).

357

Rapamycin did not decrease further the number of spines in mTOR-KO dMSNs

358

showing the absence of additive effects. A detailed evaluation of the spine

359

density, close (< 50 μm) to the soma (Figure 3F) or far from the soma (> 50 μm)

360

(Figure 3G), revealed similar values for all groups for proximal spines but a

361

significant lower distal spine density in rapamycin-treated control dMSNs and

362

mTOR-KO dMSNs. The morphological data indicates selective distal dendritic

changes in dMSNs after the genetic and pharmacological blockade of mTOR

We next investigated whether electrophysiological and morphological

370

dependent of protein synthesis. Our data show that the in vitro exposure to

371

anisomycin (a protein synthesis inhibitor) prior to the recordings did not affect

372

the rapamycin-induced enhancement of Dendrotoxin-sensitive fAHPs. Similar

373

RMP values were found in all groups (Figure 4A) and a decreased capacitance

in dMSNs from Drd1-Cre+/- mTORΔ/LoxP Rosa26dTomato+/- (Figure 4B) was still

present when compared to dMSNs from control littermates. Remarkably, the

increase in the amplitude of the fAHP is maintained in the presence of

(Figure 4C). Morphological data showed that the total number of spines as well

379

as spine density far from the soma remained reduced after the pharmacological

380

blockade and the genetic deletion of mTOR in dMSNs regardless of the protein

381

synthesis inhibition (Figures 4D and F respectively). On the other hand, there

is still no impact on the proximal spine density (Figure 4E). The lack of protein

effects of C3 exo on the RMP (Figure 5A), or on the dMSNs capacitance (Figure

393

394

On the other hand, exposure to C3 exo prevented the rapamycin-induced

increase in the fAHP amplitude in dMSNs from control D1 Cre+/-

mTORΔ/wtRosa26dTomato+/- mice but did not modify the increased fAHP

Discussion
In this study, we determined the role of mTOR in dMSNs by assessing

408

how the genetic deletion of mTOR from dMSNs affects striatal-related

409

behaviours and their neurophysiology. Our behavioural data indicate that the

410

inactivation of mTOR in dMSNs disrupts several aspects of striatal circuitry

411

physiology. Using a cell-type-specific approach, we unveiled that mTOR

412

controls, through a protein synthesis-independent mechanism, the membrane

413

density of Kv1.1 using RhoA as substrate. Moreover, the genetic deletion of

414

mTOR in dMSNs induces modifications of the dendritic complexity and distal

415

spine density, resulting in behavioural changes compatible with disrupted

416

striatal function. Additionally, we found that short-term exposure of dMSNs from

417

control mice to rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor (53, 54), replicates

418

electrophysiological and morphological features found in neurons genetically

419

inactivated for mTOR.

420

Our first aim was to determine the functional consequences of the

421

selective mTOR inactivation in dMSNs. Our findings that D1R-mTOR KO mice

422

exhibit impaired social and repetitive behaviours are reminiscent of phenotypes

423

observed in several forms of idiopathic autism disorders in which aberrant

424

activity of mTOR signalling has been reported (55). However, the reduced

425

repetitive behaviours and voluntary locomotion indicate that the phenotype

426

displayed by the D1R-mTOR KO mice is also intricately linked to motor

427

dysfunctions. Sutton and Caron have previously shown that the selective

428

deletion of mTOR or Raptor (a partner of mTORC1) in D1R MSNs neurons

429

decreases locomotion in mice (56). Another mTORC1 partner, Rhes, has also

430

been implicated on the striatal control of locomotion (57) reinforcing the control

431

of locomotor activity by mTOR and downstream partners. However, the acute

432

administration of rapamycin does not impact the locomotion of mice (58)

433

suggesting that modifications after the disruption of mTOR signalling are timely

434

dependent (development included) or specific to

435

neuronal types. Alternatively, the lack of cell-type selectivity (on D1 and D2

436

neurons) after rapamycin administration might be compensated by secondary

437

mechanisms stabilizing the locomotor function, which cannot be reached by the

438

D1 selective genetic deletion of mTOR.

certain brain areas or

439

The modifications in the activation of core components of the

440

translational machinery such as p-4EBP1 (59) and p-p70S6K (60) could induce

441

a set of electrophysiological alterations since mTOR controls protein synthesis

442

and cell excitability. However, global changes in protein synthesis are unlikely

443

in our animals since the puromycin incorporation assay indicated similar values

444

for both groups. Kv1.1 function is known to be controlled by mTOR in a protein-

445

synthesis independent manner (40). Notably, the fAHP modifications induced

446

by both the selective dMSNs genetic deletion of mTOR and the rapamycin-

447

induced pharmacological blockade were connected to the Kv1.1 activity. The

448

fAHP modifications found here are similar to those observed when PTEN, an

449

upstream regulator of the Akt/mTOR pathway is mutated. However, in this

450

report, the authors associate their results with the overexpression of calcium-

451

activated potassium channels in the cortex (61). The close connection between

452

low levels of mTOR signalling in the striatum and altered potassium currents

453

has been also reported in mouse models of Huntington´s disease (HD) (62).

19
454

Although neuronal morphological parameters such as dendritic

455

complexity, volume of the soma and spine density are governed by diverse

456

mechanisms, both mTOR complexes are key for cytoskeletal organization and

457

function (63, 64). Changes in mTOR signalling and spine pruning defects may

458

represent a secondary mechanism in response to an imbalance between

459

excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, identified in both Mecp2 mutant

460

mice and Tsc1-deficient mice (both partners of mTOR) (65-67) and also linked

461

to autism. Interestingly, the deletion of the mTOR negative regulator Tsc1

462

induces increased excitability and decreased dendritic complexity in dMSNs

463

(68).

464

RhoA control over membrane recycling of proteins, mainly receptors and

465

channels (69, 70), and more specifically in the regulation of the traffic of voltage-

466

gated potassium channels has been shown before (71). Interestingly,

467

Luykennar and colleagues described in rat cerebral arteries that the inhibition

468

of RhoA leads to a concomitant loss of pyrimidines control of excitability,

469

attributed on their specific case to the Kv1.2 malfunction, paired with actin

470

disorganization (72). Still, the selective prevention of modifications exerted by

471

C3 exo has only been observed in the rapamycin protocol but not in cells from

472

D1-mTOR KO mice. Two possible explanations might account for this

473

difference. First, developmental differences where mTOR is known to be an

474

important factor (73), and second, as C3 exo provides prevention, this would

475

not be observable with any approach using KO animals since the time

476

resolution is lost.

dMSNs

electrophysiological and morphological modifications that are dependent of an

480

over function of Kv1.1 channels regulated by RhoA. We also reinforce the

481

notion of mTOR as a valid target to striatal dysfunction and provide, with cell-

482

type specificity, a mechanistic hint about the dynamic changes in MSNs

483

electrophysiology and morphology that accompany striatal disorders.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Deletion of mTOR decreases spontaneous locomotor activity,
modifies repetitive and social behaviour in mice. The reduction in the
expression of mTOR in the total striatum of dMSNs mTOR-KO mice is shown
in (A). After the D1-driven deletion of mTOR, lower expression of mTOR-partner
proteins such as p-p70S6K (phosphorylation site T389) (B) and p-4EBP1
(phosphorylation site T37/46) (C) was observed. The phosphorylation pattern
of Akt (phosphorylation site S473) is depicted in (D). (E) Similar levels of
puromycin incorporation in both groups. (F) Representative western blots.
Decreased horizontal and vertical spontaneous locomotor activity in mTOR-KO
mice when compared to control littermates in the circular corridor test (G and
H). The decrease in the locomotor activity is not related with deficits of motor
coordination and motor learning as can be observed by our rota-rod results (I)
or anxiety-like behaviour (J and K). Repetitive behaviour evaluated by the
marble-burying test revealed that mTOR-KO mice buried less marbles than
control mice (L). The deletion of mTOR in dMSNs induces the reduction of
social interaction with conspecific mice (M) and (N). Social novelty (when a
second conspecific mouse is introduced) is partially impaired following the
mTOR deletion in dMSNs (O) and (P). * p<0.05.
Figure 2. Kv1.1 mediates the electrophysiological modifications in mTORKO dMSNs. The deletion of mTOR in dMSNs did not modify the RMP of these
neurons (A) however it decreased cell capacitance (B) and increased the
amplitude of fAHP of dMSNs from mTOR-KO mice (red trace) in comparison to
control dMSNs (blue trace) (C). The pharmacological blockade of mTOR did
not produce any effects on the RMP (D) or additive effects on the capacitance
of both genotypes (E) but promptly increased the amplitude of the fAHP
(rapamycin: black trace and DMSO: blue trace) similar to the genetic
manipulation (F). After the selection of the appropriate concentration of TEA
and dendrotoxin-K (G), panel H shows that, the non-selective blockade of Kvs
(TEA) completely renormalized the mTOR-mediated increase in the fAHP,

effect that is partially recapitulated by the selective blockade of Kv1.1
(dendrotoxin-k). A similar approach but aiming the Kv4.2 (J) and Kv4.1 and
4.3 showed that these channels are not involved in the mTOR-mediated
increase of fAHP (K) (Stromatoxin 50 nM and Phrixotoxin-2 100 nM). *p<0.05
when compared with the DMSO control group. # p<0.05 when compared with
the respective genotype rapamycin exposed cells.
Figure 3. Selective morphological characteristics are shaped by mTOR in
dMSNs. Representative 3D reconstructions of dMSNs of control (A), rapamycin
(B) and D1-mTOR KO (C) conditions are shown. Decreased ramification of
dMSNs after the genetic deletion of mTOR but no effect of rapamycin on this
parameter was noted (D). Total number of spines in dMSNs is decreased after
the exposure to rapamycin or the genetic deletion of mTOR (E). Proximal (<50
μm from the soma) spine density is not affected by rapamycin or the mTOR
deletion in dMSNs (F) but distal spine density (>50 μm) is impaired by both
conditions (G). *p<0.05 when compared with DMSO control group.
Figure 4. mTOR-induced electrophysiological and morphological
modifications are protein-synthesis independent. The exposure to
anisomycin (a protein synthesis inhibitor) did not change the RMP of control
and mTOR KO dMSNs or changed the profile of the response for the
capacitance (B) or the fAHP amplitude (C). Similarly, no changes in the
proximal spine density (D) were observed while the decreased in the total
number of spines (E) and distal spine density (F) are maintained regardless of
the exposure to anisomycin. * p<0.05 when compared with the DMSO control
group.
Figure 5. RhoA inhibition prevents the rapamycin-induced
electrophysiological and morphological modifications. The exposure to
the C3 exoenzyme (a RhoA inhibitor) was not sufficient to induce changes in
the dMSNs RMP (A) interfere with the capacitance (B). However, it prevented
the rapamycin-induced increase of fAHP amplitude (C) without interfering with
the same parameter in mTOR KO dMSNs. The same pattern of response was
seen in the total number of spines (D) and distal spine density (F) without
inducing changes in the proximal spine density (E). *p<0.05 when compared to
the DMSO control group.
