MetroNome is a web-based visual data exploration platform which integrates de-identified
genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic data sets. Users can define and compare cohorts
constructed from multimodal data and share the data and analyses with outside tools. MetroNome’s
interactive visualization and analysis tools allow researchers to quickly form and explore novel
hypotheses. The deidentified data is linked back to the source biosample inventories in multiple
biobanks, enabling researchers to further investigate new ideas using the most relevant samples.

Introduction

21
22
23

Biomedical research is producing a wealth of genomic data, some of it public [1]; though much is
restricted to various consortia or project team members. The restrictions are often necessary to
comply with consents and regulatory policies. Analyses of complex multimodal patient-derived

24
25
26
27

data—such as genome sequencing, clinical and pathological measures, environmental factors, and
imaging—enables questions to be explored that would otherwise not be possible. For example, how
can the same chromatin remodeling genes be associated with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, congenital heart defects, and digestive tract issues? To achieve adequate statistical power

28
29
30
31

for genomic research discoveries, different types of data — from different studies and diseases —
must be integrated while assuring regulatory compliance with patient confidentiality and data use
policies [2, 3, 4, 6]. The associated tools should be openly available and usable by a wide audience
with different levels of expertise in genomics and biostatistics, while still ensuring responsible use of

32
33

the data. Existing applications make it possible to integrate GWAS results with other data to
prioritize variants by phenotype [7] or browse available individual-level genotype and sequence data

associated with phenotypic features [8]. However, these tools generally lack the capability to then
generate lists of samples and subjects matching genomic and phenotypic criteria of interest, enabling
access to the underlying de-identified data and samples across multiple biorepositories.
MetroNome comprises a web-based suite of interactive data visualization tools, enabling users to
combine their own data with other relevant public datasets and explore the results via linked graphs
and diagrams. The system leverages human visuospatial cognitive abilities to reveal patterns and find
connections. Researchers can segregate results along multiple dimensions, such as tissue source,
quality control measures, whether specific variants are present, or any combination of ranges and
categories in phenotypic and demographic dimensions. This enables easy comparisons between userdefined cohorts via the visualization modules. Normalized analyses, such as gene expression z-scores,
are calculated in real time, based on the user’s search parameters, to allow side-by-side visual
comparisons which highlight critical differences between groups, e.g., cases and controls.

47

Background

48
49
50
51

MetroNome derives from two thus far distinct paths in data exploration. Genomic visualization
tools such as cBioPortal [14] provide domain-specific visualizations such as variant diagrams and the
oncoprint visualization. An earlier and orthogonal stream of work was the development of
commercial “OnLine Analytic Processing” (OLAP) tools, which date to the 1970’s but gained

52
53
54
55

traction in the 1990’s with tools such as Cognos (now IBM) [ www.ibm.com/Cognos/Analytics ], and
Business Objects (now SAP) [www.businessobjects.com/ ]. These tools enabled multi-dimensional
analysis of data, and dynamic filtering of commercial data along individual dimensions – although
they were primarily tabular, not graphic. The second generation of OLAP, led by Tableau [

56
57
58
59

www.tableau.com] introduced graphics and dashboards. Dashboards provide multiple visualizations
on the same screen and the ability to filter on any one frame and propagate that filter to all other
frames on the dashboard. This dynamic queries technique initially arose as an alternative to SQL for
querying databases [5]. MetroNome unites these two directions: scientific and statistical

60

visualizations, combined with dynamic filtering and filter propagation.

61

Exploration of synthetic cohorts via multi-modal interactive data visualization

62
63

MetroNome presents genomic and transcriptomic data in the context of phenotypic attributes,
relying on customized linked visualizations to enable exploration.

64

Creating synthetic cohorts

65

We allow the user to combine and display data from multiple sources, based on phenotypic or

66
67
68

genotypic traits and user access rights to those datasets. We provide access to publicly available
reference datasets, such as 1000 genomes [12] and TCGA tumor data [13] for use as comparators. To
perform an analysis, the user starts by creating a query that selects data from one or multiple

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/769646; this version posted September 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

75

sources. MetroNome’s query page presents a series of dynamically linked drop-down menus that can
be combined into rules for selecting subjects. Rules for subject and sample criteria can include filters
for any information available in the datasets that the user has selected for inclusion. Genomic rules
can include the presence of variants in a list of genes or in a genomic region. Variants can be filtered
by their predicted protein-coding impact as calculated by SnpEff [9], or their association with
disease as recorded in ClinVar [10]. The search produces lists of subjects, samples, and variants that
match the selected rules.

95

The query results display multiple types of data simultaneously in linked panels, such as whole
genome or exome variants, RNA expression, copy number variations, structural variants, and
phenotypic data, to facilitate visual exploration of associations among different data types. The
visualization controls enable users to refine queries in an intuitive and dynamic fashion while
exploring relationships in the data. Researchers can alter results along multiple search dimensions—
for subject, sample, and genomic criteria — without rerunning their query — by refining the
visualizations to samples with specific variants, or combinations of ranges and categories in
phenotypic and demographic dimensions. As the user changes the extent of any one category, that
change is projected to all other displayed data.
Scientists can use their intuition to generate hypotheses, then quickly look for initial
confirmation, and readily refine the direction of their search to pursue a suspected causal effect. The
resulting synthetic cohorts resolve to a set of individual subjects and samples, and the contents of
that set can be extracted for further analysis. A frequent current use case comes from our
collaboration with the Target ALS Multicenter Human Postmortem Tissue Core [11]: ALS
researchers can identify decedent biosamples of specific interest to their research using
MetroNome’s data exploration capabilities, and then work with Target ALS Core directors to
rapidly obtain the specific blinded sample sets culled from multiple academic centers necessary for
rigorous follow-up experiments.

96

Comparison of cohorts

97
98

We provide the ability to view two cohorts side-by-side, to allow comparisons of traits that might
influence results and warrant further study. Visually comparing datasets is one way to determine

99
100
101

whether given cohorts are of interest, and whether specific dynamic filters better isolate features of
interest. Cohort-normalized values, such as gene expression z-scores, are recalculated on the fly,
based on the user’s search parameters, to accurately represent critical differences between groups,

102

e.g., cases and controls.

103
104

Example use case

105

To illustrate the utility of MetroNome, we can use examples from ALS research: Figure 1 is a

106

comparison between patients with (left) and without (right) C9ORF72 repeat expansions, showing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/769646; this version posted September 14, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

110

gene expression patterns for the gene FIG4. The neuro axis diagrams present clear differences
between the two groups in the primary motor cortex and, for the cohort with repeat expansions
(left), the motor cortex vs. occipital cortex, an uninvolved region. In the relationship diagrams, this
cohort is also marked by shorter duration of the disease.

Figure 1: Comparison of cohorts with C9ORF72 repeat expansions (left) and without (right), showing gene expression
patterns for the gene FIG4 in an anotomogram (top), and variants (bottom).
111
112

Figure 2 shows a query for samples with variants in the gene PFN1, requested by a researcher who

113
114

had seen white matter abnormalities in mouse spinal cords. The neuro axis diagram clearly shows
higher PFN1 expression in the spinal cord, and particularly in the thoracic spinal cord, which is

115
116

interesting because the thoracic cord has a higher proportion of white matter compared to cervical
and lumbar. In addition, the RNA heatmap indicates that there are a couple of specific samples with

119

very high cortical PFN1 expression. These specific decedent tissues and slides can be selected for
further benchtop experiments, and correlation with phenotypic information.

Figure 2: a query for samples with variants in the gene PFN1. The neuro axis diagram (top) clearly shows higher
PFN1 expression in the spinal cord, and particularly in the thoracic spinal cord. The RNA heatmap (bottom), besides
showing generally higher expression in the spinal cord samples, reveals a couple of samples with very high cortical levels.

124
125
126

These types of searches can be performed instantly and without the need for prior bioinformatics
training. Lists of subjects, samples, and variants can be downloaded for further analysis and used to
identify and request tissues/biofluids/slides meeting specific criteria (such as gene expression
patterns, QC measures, or specific variants) from participating biorepositories for further benchtop
experimentation.

Infrastructure to support cross-study dynamic visualization

128
129
130

In addition to the visualization tools themselves, a great deal of data infrastructure is needed to
realize the outlined goals. These infrastructure tools center on integrating data with available
standards and with other data across multiple studies. We outline here three areas we have found

131

necessary to address:

132
133
134
135

•

136
137
138

Data harmonization: We harmonize data where possible, which is currently a manual process.
Fields with different names in different datasets must be changed to the same standard names in
each. The values of those fields must be converted to the same vocabulary, the same numeric
ranges, and the same units. Values that are in reference to a specified or assumed range, such as
values from some laboratory tests that have varying ranges by instrument used, must be recorded
along with the reference range. Missing values must be handled, whenever possible, without
discarding the entire record.

139
140
141
142

•

Use of metadata and provenance: the data needed for analyzing results for a single study are
often insufficient for integrating that data with information from other sources. Where the
metadata and provenance data exist, we use such information to more accurately present
combined data. We flag uncertainties to minimize misleading results.

143
144
145
146
147
148
149
150
151
152

•

Reference data: to enable as much data integration as possible, we maintain significant types
of reference data, including target sets for standard exome kits. ClinVar [clinvar.org]
annotations are used to filter for pathogenic variants. Ensembl transcript-level and protein
domain annotations provide information on protein-coding impact and high-impact variants,
when disease significance is still unknown. 1,000 Genomes and TCGA somatic data are
maintained, primarily as sources of additional data for sparse datasets. These reference data are
used for comparisons, for interpretation of metadata, and for annotation of the synthesized
cohorts generated in MetroNome. Note that full data integration to enable further analysis is a
much more extensive problem that we have yet to address. Our work here is focused on enabling
integrated and comparative visualizations.

153

Privacy and security

154
155
156
157

Privacy and security are major concerns when we are supporting limited-access datasets.
Authorization to access a particular dataset is determined by the owner of that dataset. The NYGC
Data Privacy Committee must review the owner’s approval before access is granted within
MetroNome. While this is a somewhat burdensome process, we feel it necessary to ensure that we

158
159
160
161

can host private data without risk of unintentional disclosure. If a user is approved for access, they
can grant members of their lab further access without review. This last case happens most often
when a user is part of a consortium, and the official owner of the data is their institution. The one
exception to that rule is that we allow users to upload any dataset to which they already have access,

162

limited to personal access only, and combine it with other MetroNome datasets they can access.

The MetroNome backend adds a clause to every database query to restrict the query to the set of
samples to which the user has access. Currently, users can access public data without logging in. If
they do so, the backend defaults to the “public” user, with associated access rights, and limits all
queries to public data only. Thus, no query or request can bypass the front end and avoid the
privacy checks.
The MetroNome front-end runs in an isolated subnet, accessible from outside the firewall. The
database and middle tier run behind the firewall, and all data thus resides internally. There is a
single connection through that firewall, restricted to a single machine address. Authentication is
performed for each connection established.

172

Technical implementation

173

Architecture and technologies used

174
175
176
177
178

MetroNome is built on a column-oriented database, Vertica, that holds all data (variants, gene
expression, phenotypic, demographic, and sample-related data). An application server, written in
Java, processes requests to the database and prepares results for display in the UI. The frontend is
written in JavaScript, using the React framework and D3 visualization library, and is hosted in a
TomCat web server.

179

System requirements

180
181
182
183

The system is designed to operate on Linux virtual machine nodes running CentOS 7 and can be
scaled to meet demands. The current database, Vertica, requires a cluster of dedicated nodes with
matching specifications for best operation; that is, each node of the cluster should be similar in
CPU, clock speed, number of cores, memory, and operating system version.

184

Source code and availability

185
186
187
188

The source code is currently being converted to open source and will be made available on
GitHub: https://github.com/nygenome/metronome.
The MetroNome installation hosted at the New York Genome Center is publicly available at

Current use: Target ALS

190

The Target ALS Resource Cores were conceived to accelerate ALS therapy development by

191

providing the necessary highly curated biosamples and data resources broadly and rapidly to the

192
193

entire ALS research community. Given the numerous failures in translating laboratory results into
clinically effective therapies, a crucial aim was to address the substantial unmet need for high quality

194
195

patient-derived biosamples – such as brain, spinal cord, and muscle tissue samples from patients who
died from ALS and controls, and biofluids and stem-cell lines collected during disease progression.

196
197

We perform centralized Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and RNA-Seq for multiple central
nervous system regions at the New York Genome Center on every autopsy performed at one of the

academic centers comprising the federated Target ALS Postmortem Tissue Core. After passing QC,
the clinically annotated genomic and transcriptomic data is ingested into MetroNome and remains
linked to the tissue samples and de-identified metadata via Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs). The
WGS and RNA-Seq raw data files (in multiple formats) are also made immediately available without
embargo or IP concerns – via an online form and established data transfer workflow.
MetroNome enables researchers with very little background in genetic analysis to access the data
set in a meaningful way, with relevance to their personal research interests. When researchers are
interested in a specific pathway or target, they can use MetroNome to search for cases with specific
mutations or variants, explore new hypotheses by comparing different cohorts defined by anatomical
regions or subject groups, and then directly request tissue samples from those cases. For virtually
every research project utilizing human biosamples, MetroNome can be used to refine slide and
sample sets, and direct further analysis. As examples, MetroNome
can be used to

The MetroNome visual data exploration platform has proven critical to the continued success,
expansion, and evolution of the Target ALS Postmortem Core and associated efforts. It has
supported over 100 different academic and industry labs, facilitating more than 135 different ALS

229

231

research projects in 16 countries across 4 continents. This often includes multiple different projects
in each lab. MetroNome has become part of a scientific ecosystem that includes clinics, research
labs, and industry.

General use

234

MetroNome is unbiased towards specific disease areas and can accommodate genomic and
phenotypic data from any study. Figure 3 shows an example from an esophageal cancer study,

identify relevant tissue samples or slides for further benchtop experiments;
find variants or RNA expression changes in specific targets;
provide “clean controls” that do not possess mutations or unknown variants;
compare spatial expression patterns with published imaging biomarker data meant to
quantify relevant pathways;
examine whether gene expression patterns are consistent with activation of pathways
modulated by potential new drug candidates;
identify whether specific patient subgroups display gene signatures that might inform
patient selection for clinical trials (Figure 3);
segregate patients based on spatial gene expression patterns and correlate with fast/slow
progressors, site of onset, or specific neuropathological metadata;
design further collaborative analysis of the genetic raw data and samples, such as whether
subject groups with distinct genetic patterns might correlate with biomarker profiles in
fluids or peripheral tissues.

samples. The grey callout shows details for one gene in one sample. Single-nucleotide variants are identified as high or
moderate impact. Copy number changes and structural variants are identified by special glyphs and colors. Sorted by
default to show genes and samples with the most impactful variants, this matrix can be used to select samples and genes
(yellow area), e.g., to create a synthetic cohort prioritizing highly mutated samples.

Future work
New releases will include some additional critical features:

240
241

•

Download images from our visualizations, along with the metadata about the cohort
being used and the filters applied.

242

•

Automate the process for users to upload their own datasets, visible only to them.

243
244

•

Improve reproducibility: users will be able to save queries, to rerun them in a later
session, or share them with other users. The ability to save results, and access them later,

245
246
247

should underlying data change in the interim, is planned. Finally, tracking the steps a
user executes in a session, displaying that history and allowing a user to return to a
previous state is a feature we believe to be very useful in this context.

248
249

•

Add support and visualizations for new data types, such as repeat expansions and splice
junctions. We expect the types of data to expand continually.

250

•

Automate harmonization using HPO terms [15].

251

•

Pedigree relationships, including flagging filtered de novo or recessive homozygous

252
253

variants in the probands. Our structure allows subjects to be considered probands in one
study and relatives in others.

Summary

262
263

Synthesizing cohorts by integrating data from multiple studies presents numerous challenges.
Providing this functionality as part of an interactive phenotype-genotype visualization platform

264
265
266
267
268
269
270

enables data integration as a fundamental part of the platform. Not only does this approach enhance
integrated multi-modal analysis, it provides a framework that reduces the work each researcher must
perform to obtain a clean cohort that meets their research needs. Using this visual data integration
platform to generate and explore hypotheses is a further important contribution, with the potential
to accelerate the work of scientists anywhere by eliminating the bioinformatics bottleneck during
genesis of ideas. Researchers can then follow up only the best leads with their computational colleagues
for thorough analysis.
