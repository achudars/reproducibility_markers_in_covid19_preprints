Abstract

7

Mobile genetic elements contribute to bacterial adaptation and evolution; however, detecting

8

these elements in a high-throughput and unbiased manner remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a

9

de novo approach to identify mobile elements from short-read sequencing data. The method identifies

10

the precise site of mobile element insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. This is an

11

improvement over previous methods that either rely on curated databases of known mobile elements or

12

rely on ‘split-read’ alignments that assume the inserted element exists within the reference genome. We

13

apply our approach to 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine prevalent bacterial pathogens, and we identify

14

hundreds of known and novel mobile genetic elements, including many candidate insertion sequences.

15

We find that the mobile element repertoire and insertion rate vary considerably across species, and that

16

many of the identified mobile elements are biased toward certain target sequences, several of them being

17

highly specific. Mobile element insertion hotspots often cluster near genes involved in mechanisms of

18

antibiotic resistance, and such insertions are associated with antibiotic resistance in laboratory

19

experiments and clinical isolates. Finally, we demonstrate that mutagenesis caused by these mobile

20

elements contributes to antibiotic resistance in a genome-wide association study of mobile element

21

insertions in pathogenic Escherichia coli. In summary, by applying a de novo approach to precisely identify

22

mobile genetic elements and their insertion sites, we thoroughly characterize the mobile element

23

repertoire and insertion spectrum of nine pathogenic bacterial species and find that mobile element

24

insertions play a significant role in the evolution of clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antibiotic

25

resistance.

26

Main

27

Genomic variation is critical for the adaptation of pathogenic bacteria. Successful human

28

pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, are able to acquire adaptive phenotypes,

29

such as antibiotic resistance, through the acquisition of single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions

30

and deletions, inversions, duplications, and also through the movement of mobile genetic elements

31

(MGEs). Prokaryotic MGEs come in many forms such as insertion sequence (IS) elements, transposons,

32

integrons, plasmids, and bacteriophages (Stokes and Gillings 2011; Rankin, Rocha, and Brown 2011). Some

33

of these elements can mobilize and insert themselves in a site-specific or random manner throughout the

34

host genome. They are of great interest to the scientific and medical communities, in large part because

35

they can transfer between microbes via horizontal gene transfer, spreading their genetic potential

36

between strains of the same species, and even across species (Juhas 2015; Bloemendaal, Brouwer, and

37

Fluit 2010).

38

IS elements are among the simplest MGEs, and typically code for only the gene (transposase)

39

necessary for their transposition (Mahillon and Chandler 1998). IS elements can transpose into genes,

40

resulting in insertional mutagenesis and loss of function of the gene (Figure 1f) (Emmanuelle Lerat and

41

Ochman 2004); alternatively, they can transpose into gene regulatory elements and influence expression

42

of neighboring genes (Figure 1f,g). IS elements play a role in antibiotic resistance (Linkevicius, Sandegren,

43

and Andersson 2013), horizontal gene transfer (Ochman, Lawrence, and Groisman 2000), and genome

44

evolution (Plague et al. 2017; Biémont and Vieira 2006; Barrick et al. 2009). In addition to minimal

45

elements, such as insertion sequences, MGEs can contain additional “passenger” genes (Figure 1e). These

46

passenger genes can code for a variety of proteins, including virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes,

47

detoxifying agents, and enzymes for secondary metabolism (Rankin, Rocha, and Brown 2011).

48

Historical estimates suggest that IS movements make up approximately 3% of acquired mutations

49

in adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments (Conrad, Lewis, and Palsson 2011), but more recent

50

studies have found that the rate of IS mutagenesis can vary depending on growth conditions, such as

51

oxygen exposure (Finn et al. 2017). Under neutral conditions, the rate of IS element insertion in E. coli is

52

estimated as 3.5 x 10-4 per genome per generation under neutral laboratory conditions (Lee et al. 2016);

53

this IS insertion rate is about 1/3rd the rate of base substitution (Lee et al. 2012). Whereas the majority of

54

studies investigating IS insertion rates have been carried out in E. coli, the rate of IS insertions does vary

55

between strains and species (Knöppel et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2016). Functionally, IS elements have been

56

shown to play an important role in antibiotic resistance in studies of small collections of clinical isolates

57

(Olliver et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2016), but a larger survey of IS insertions in clinical isolates has not yet been

58

carried out. Our somewhat narrow understanding of the location and role of IS elements in bacterial

59

adaptation is likely the result of limited awareness of the role of these elements in adaptation, an

60

assumption that short reads cannot accurately identify such insertions, and the lack of flexible and

61

sensitive tools to identify such mutations.

62

Several approaches exist for identifying IS elements and cargo-carrying MGEs for both prokaryotic

63

and eukaryotic genomes (Barrick et al. 2014; E. Lerat 2010; Xie and Tang 2017; Treepong et al. 2018; Jiang

64

et al. 2015; Adams, Bishop, and Wright 2016; Biswas et al. 2015; Hawkey et al. 2015). For example, a

65

database-dependent approach has been used to identify novel IS elements through performing a BLAST

66

search on completed genome or draft genome assemblies (Siguier et al. 2006), and other approaches

67

relying on split-read alignments can identify MGE insertions with respect to a well-annotated reference

68

genome (Barrick et al. 2014). While these approaches are useful, most are limited due to their dependence

69

on shared homology with known MGEs or genes, or by requiring well-annotated reference genomes using

70

sequenced isolates that closely resemble the reference.

71

Here, we sought to comprehensively identify complete MGEs, the genes they contained, and their

72

site of insertion with respect to a reference genome from short-read sequencing data. Our approach is

73

flexible, as it can use a database of MGEs when available, but it does not depend entirely on a database

74

of known MGEs and mobile genes. It is sensitive and precise enough to be used on both laboratory

75

samples and environmental isolates. We focus on MGE insertion sites, generate consensus sequences for

76

inserted elements from the clipped ends of locally-aligned reads, infer complete MGEs from sequence

77

assemblies, and build a de novo database of elements across all analyzed samples. We combine several

78

sequence inference approaches to identify large insertions, resulting in a highly sensitive and precise

79

overall approach.

80

By focusing on MGE insertion sites, we answer several questions about these elements that have

81

not been thoroughly addressed in the past. For example, we determine the target-site specificity of each

82

of these MGEs, their level of activity relative to other MGEs within the same species, and the overall MGE

83

insertional capacity of the species of interest. Understanding the overall MGE potential helps us to

84

understand to what extent a bacterial species can adapt by means of MGE activity, either within a single

85

bacterial genome or by way of horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, we can identify genes that are

86

frequently disrupted by MGE insertions within the population, hinting at selective pressures that may be

87

driving these adaptive insertion events

88

We use our de novo approach to analyze 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine pathogenic bacterial

89

species and demonstrate large differences in the overall MGE repertoire and the rate of MGE insertion

90

between species. We characterize MGE insertion hotspots across species and demonstrate that these

91

insertions alter the activity of genes in clinically relevant biological pathways, such as those related to

92

antibiotic resistance. We analyze MGE insertions in the context of adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE)

experiments and demonstrate that MGE insertions mediate many of the loss-of-function adaptations that

94

confer resistance to antibiotics. Finally, we use MGE insertions as features in a bacterial genome-wide

95

association study (GWAS) to identify known and potentially novel mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

96

A de novo approach to identify and genotype MGE insertions

97

Several tools exist to identify mobile element insertions from short-read sequencing data of

98

prokaryotic genomes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses (Supplementary Table 1). Most of

99

the available tools have two major limitations: they either require a database of known mobile elements,

100

such as insertion sequences, to initially identify these large insertions (Hawkey et al. 2015), or were built

101

specifically for use in resequencing studies (such as ALE experiments) (Barrick et al. 2014), thus requiring

102

a well-annotated and very closely related reference genome for the organism being studied, an

103

assumption that often fails when studying diverse strains of the same species. We sought to develop a

104

tool that would overcome these limitations and identify large insertions and their genomic position de

105

novo, without the need for either a reference database of mobile elements or a closely related reference

106

genome with well-annotated insertion sequences. We applied this tool, which we call mustache, in an

107

analysis of thousands of publicly-available sequenced isolates of the prevalent bacterial pathogens

Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium

Staphylococcus aureus. Short-read sequence data for a random subset of these isolates were downloaded

from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database,

Figure 1: A new approach to identify MGEs from short-read sequencing data.

a, A schematic representation of the workflow implemented in this study. The analysis requires a reference genome of a given
species and short-read sequencing FASTQ files as input. The reads are aligned to the provided reference genome and
assembled using third-party software. Candidate MGE insertion sites are identified from the alignment to the reference using
our own software suite, called mustache. This approach identifies sites where oppositely-oriented clipped read ends are found
within 20 bases of each other. Consensus sequences of these flanking ends are then identified, with the assumption being that
they represent the flanks of the inserted element. The intervening sequence between the candidate flanks is inferred by
aligning flanks to the assembled genome, a reference genome, and our dynamically constructed reference database of all
identified MGEs. b, The inference method used to characterize the inserted elements of the downloaded data. “Inferred from
assembly with full context” indicates that the sequence was found in the expected sequence context within the assembly and
is considered one of the highest-confidence inferred sequences. “Inferred from assembly with half context” indicates that the
sequence was found in the expected sequence context on one end of the inserted element, and the other element was
truncated at the end of a partially assembled contig. “Inferred from overlap” indicates that the sequence was recovered simply
by finding an overlap of two paired flanks. Very few elements are recovered by this method, as we are limiting our analysis to
only elements greater than 300 base pairs in length. “Inferred from assembly without context” indicates that the sequence

identified was recovered from the assembly, but not within the expected sequence context, presumably due to assembly
errors. “Inferred from dynamically-constructed database” refers to elements that were not recovered from the assembly but
were recovered from the reference genome or from our dynamically constructed database. The database in this case is built
from the accumulated inferred sequences found in the assembly and in the reference across all sequenced isolates.
“Ambiguous identity - Resolved” indicates that the element was initially is assigned to multiple element clusters but was
resolved using several techniques described in the methods. “Ambiguous identity - Unresolved” indicates the the inserted
element maps to multiple element clusters and could not be resolved. This excludes these insertions from some of the
downstream analyses. c, Results of simulations using the mustache software tools. We simulated insertions into the nine
species analyzed in this study. Reference genomes were mutated with base pair substitutions and short indels at a rate of
0.085 mutations per base pair. An insertion is considered found if both of its flanks are recovered near the expected insertion
seite, properly paired with each other, and the consensus flanks show high similarity with the expected inserted sequence.
Precision indicates the proportion of reported results that are true simulated MGE insertions, and sensitivity indicates the
proportion of simulated MGE insertions that are recovered by mustache. d, An analysis of the proportion of elements identified
in the mustache workflow. A “unique element” refers to a unique cluster of elements that are 95% similar across 85% of their
respective sequences. The number of elements predicted to be IS elements is shown in purple. “MGE w/ passenger genes” in
blue indicates other elements that contain both predicted transposases and one or more passenger genes. “Contains CDS” in
green indicates all other elements that contain a predicted CDS, but no transposase. “Other” in yellow indicates all other
inserted elements that contain no predicted CDS. e-g, Schematic representations of the many ways that MGEs influence
biological processes: e, through carrying cargo proteins of specific function. f, through disrupting functional genomic elements,
and g, by introducing outwardly-directed promoters, causing up-regulation of adjacent genes. The MGE insertions depicted in

downstream of coding sequences. Blue arrow indicates a probable gain-of-function MGE insertion causing greater expression
of the respective gene. Red arrows indicate probable loss-of-function MGE insertion. Grey arrows indicate mutations of

113

The approach implemented by mustache is described schematically in Figure 1a. Briefly, we first

114

align short reads from isolates of a given species to a reference genome of that species using the BWA

115

mem local alignment tool. We found that while the choice of the reference genome used will determine

116

the insertions that are identified, many of the analyses presented in this study are quite robust to

117

reference genome choice (Supplementary Figure 5). Second, we identify candidate insertion sites by

118

searching alignments for reads that have clipped ends at the same site. A read with a clipped end indicates

119

the exact site where the inserted element begins with respect to the reference genome used, and we

120

build a consensus sequence from these clipped ends. Constructing the consensus sequence this way is

121

where our method fundamentally differs from split-read alignment approaches. Third, these high-quality

122

consensus sequences are paired with nearby oppositely-oriented consensus sequences to identify

123

candidate insertions, represented by these partial reconstructions of the inserted element flanks. The

124

genome of each bacterial isolate is then assembled using the SPAdes assembler (Bankevich et al. 2012),

125

candidate insertion site sequences are aligned back to the assembled genome, and the full inserted

126

sequence is inferred from the alignments. Finally, we build a database of such inferred sequences across

127

all analyzed isolates, and we perform a final sequence inference step of all candidate pairs by aligning to

128

this accumulated database, in the event that the sequence could not be inferred in the initial inference

129

step.

130

Fundamentally, mustache overcomes two limitations of prior approaches. First, since repeated

131

sequences such as MGEs impair genome assembly, alignment-based approaches that compare reference

132

and assembled genomes often fail to identify full insertion sequences. As mustache does not require that

133

insertion sequences assemble within their expected sequence context, this limitation is overcome.

134

Second, existing split-read approaches typically assume that the MGE of interest exists in the reference

135

genome being used. However, this assumption often fails when analyzing organisms where the

136

introduction of novel genetic material by horizontal gene transfer is common (Alkan, Coe, and Eichler

137

2011; Barrick et al. 2014). By combining several inference approaches (Figure 1b; Supplementary Figure

138

1), mustache increases the overall sensitivity and confidence in the accuracy of the inferred sequence. By

139

focusing on reconstructing a high-quality consensus sequence of the inserted element from clipped ends,

140

we can use clipped ends as short as one base pair to support the existence of an insertion at a given site.

141

It is critical that insertion discovery tools are both precise and sensitive. To evaluate the

142

performance characteristics of mustache, we estimated its precision and sensitivity using simulations

143

(Figure 1c). We simulated 32 MGE insertions per isolate genome, using 16 species-specific IS elements

144

chosen at random, and 16 randomly generated sequences between 300 and 10,000 base pairs in length.

145

We used DWGSIM to mutate the reference genome with short indels and point mutations at two mutation

146

rates - 0.001 and 0.085 per base pair (Homer, 2017). We find that at 40x coverage and a mutation rate of

147

0.085, we have at least 83% sensitivity to detect MGE insertions for all species tested, and over 87%

148

sensitivity at 100x coverage. At a mutation rate of 0.001, sensitivity is over 88% across all coverages

149

greater than 40x. A major strength of our approach is that it filters out small insertions and substitutions

150

that can be mistaken as large insertions, resulting in precision that exceeds 98% when coverage is greater

151

than 40x. ANOVA tests of all simulated samples with 40x coverage or greater indicate that species (F9,2145

152

= 106; P < 2 x 10-16), mutation rate (F1,2145 = 199, P < 2 x 10-16), and read length (F2,2145 = 44, P < 2 x 10-16) all

153

influence sensitivity, but that coverage does not (F3,2145 = 2.5; P = 0.0614). Precision is also influenced by

154

species (F9,2145 = 2.7; P = 0.006), mutation rate (F1,2145 = 241, P < 2 x 10-16), and read length (F2,2145 = 143, P

155

< 2 x 10-16), but not coverage (F3,2145 = 0.77; P = 0.5). Differences between sensitivity and precision of our

156

approach across species are likely due to genomic differences such as higher number of repetitive regions,

157

as we filter out reads mapping ambiguously within each genome. Differences due to read length and

158

mutation rate should be considered when comparing multiple isolates, although these differences are

159

quite small (Figure 1c). We also compared the performance of mustache to a recently published tool,

160

panISa (Treepong et al. 2018), and we find no significant difference in sensitivity above 40x coverage

161

(ANOVA test; F1,4304 = 2.5; P = 0.11), but mustache has improved sensitivity at coverage below 40x (ANOVA

162

test; F1,3225 = 39; P =4.9 x 10-10; Supplementary Figure 2). Notably, the precision of mustache is much more

163

stable across different levels of coverage compared to panISa. Moreover, mustache can infer the

164

complete inserted sequence from an assembly or reference genome, whereas panISa relies on a web-

165

based BLAST of the ISfinder database to infer the identity of the inserted element.

166

While mustache appears to be highly accurate, it should be noted that we did not simulate all of

167

the many genomic differences that could exist between isolates, such as inversions or more complex

168

combinations of structural changes. For the purpose of this analysis, we limit our analysis to only those

169

insertion sites whose inferred sequence was between 300 bp and 10 kbp and were inserted into the

170

bacterial chromosome. Additionally, we see differences in the confidence of our predictions between

171

species; for example, more than 50% of E. coli insertions across all 1,471 isolates were inferred with “high

172

confidence” by this method, as opposed to E. faecium where less than 10% could be inferred with “high

173

confidence” by this approach. Despite these limitations, the simulation studies carried out demonstrate

174

that mustache is sensitive and precise.

175

Characterizing the MGE repertoire of pathogenic bacterial

176

species

177

MGEs are known to contribute to antibiotic resistance in certain pathogens, such as E. coli and A.

178

baumannii (Adams et al. 2008; Linkevicius, Sandegren, and Andersson 2013). Of the nine pathogenic

179

species we analyzed in this study, several have developed high levels of antibiotic resistance in recent

180

years. Thus, understanding their MGE repertoire, common sites of insertion, and their contribution to

181

antibiotic resistance is of interest to researchers and clinicians alike. All of the isolates we analyzed were

182

downloaded at random from the SRA database, a publicly-available database provided by the NCBI. They

183

were filtered according to several quality control parameters (see methods), leaving us with a total of

184

12,419 sequenced isolates in total (Supplementary Table 2).

185

We ran mustache on all sequenced isolates, and we limited our analysis to only MGEs in the size

186

range from 300 bp to 10 kbp that inserted into the bacterial chromosome. We clustered and annotated

187

the genes, including transposases, encoded in these elements (Supplementary Tables 3-5). Overall, we

188

predict that 25.6% of the identified elements from all nine species sequenced are IS elements, with 53%

189

of the E. faecium elements being classified as IS elements, compared to 7.3% of N. gonorrhoeae elements

190

(Figure 1d). Another 16.5% of all identified elements are predicted to be MGEs with passenger proteins,

191

defined as elements that contain a predicted transposase and one or more other predicted proteins. The

192

remaining 57.9% of elements contain no transposase, and likely represent one-off insertion events, or

193

deletions that are specific to the reference genome used but were not deleted in the isolate.

194

Next, we analyzed the number of times that we observed a given sequence element inserted at

195

different loci across the genome (Figure 2a). We found that A. baumannii and E. coli had the highest

196

number of high-activity MGEs, with 46 elements in A. baumannii and 45 elements in E. coli appearing at

197

more than 10 positions across all analyzed samples. N. gonorrhoeae was on the opposite extreme, with

198

no elements being detected at over 10 positions, although this may be partially due to the fact that we

199

only analyzed 895 N. gonorrhoeae isolates compared to 1,471 E. coli isolates. Nonetheless, these

200

differences across species suggest distinct differences in MGE diversity and overall activity.

201

We find that as more isolates are analyzed, more unique insertions are identified, but that the

202

rate of increase varies from species to species (Figure 2b). E. coli is on the high end of the distribution,

203

with 6,131 unique insertions identified after analyzing 1,471 isolates, suggesting that it not only has a high

204

diversity of MGEs but that they are quite active in the population. In contrast, only 106 unique insertions

205

were detected in N. gonorrhoeae across all 895 analyzed isolates, indicating that MGE insertions are not

206

a common adaptive strategy for this species. This does not, however, account for differences in genome

207

size across species, which likely partially explains differences in the rate of insertion. To adjust for genome

208

size, we analyzed the number of rare insertions (those with allele frequency < 0.01 in the population) per

209

megabase of covered genome for each isolate (Figure 2d). When adjusting for genome length in this

210

manner, we find that E. faecium has the highest number of rare insertions per megabase of reference

211

genome with a mean 2.56 (95% CI, 2.41-2.71) across all analyzed samples, while N. gonorrhoeae and P.

212

aeruginosa have means of 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06-0.15) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.23-0.28), respectively. There are

213

Figure 2: Bacterial species vary considerably in their overall MGE repertoire and rate of insertion.

a, The number of unique sequence elements identified, binned by species and total unique insertion sites. All 300 bp – 10 kbp
sequence elements identified in the workflow were clustered using CD-HIT-EST at 90% similarity across 85% of the sequence.
The number of unique insertion sites for each element refers to the number of unique sites where members of a given element
cluster can be found across all isolates analyzed for each species. b, The number of new insertions identified as additional
isolates are analyzed. c, An analysis of the most MGEs found in each species, defined by the total number of unique insertion
sites where the element is found. The x-axis indicates the proportion of all detected 300 bp - 10kbp insertions that are
attributed to the element for each species. The size of each point indicates the total number of unique insertion sites detected
for the respective element across all isolates. d, Notched boxplots of the number of rare insertions detected across all samples
for each species, adjusted by megabase of genome. A rare insertion is defined as one that has an allele frequency (AF) < 0.01
(an insertion that was identified in less than 1% of all samples). The total number of rare insertions identified per isolate was
then adjusted by the number of genomic sites in the sequenced isolates that had non-zero coverage, and then multiplied by
1 megabase. Notches indicate 1.58 x IQR / sqrt(n), a rough 95% confidence interval for comparing medians (Mcgill, Tukey, and
Larsen 1978).

We find that the elements responsible for the most insertions are IS elements for each species,

220

as expected (Figure 2c). We find that the IS987 element is responsible for 96% of all detected insertions

221

in M. tuberculosis, with 1,673 insertions attributed to this element. The IS1 element is responsible for 32%

222

of all detected insertions in E. coli, with 1,938 insertions attributed to it. On the low end we have IS1655

223

in N. gonorrhoeae which accounts for 5.7% (6/106) of detected insertions, and ISPpu7 in Pseudomonas

224

aeruginosa which accounts for 9.0% (103/1137) of detected insertions. To our knowledge, these are the

225

first MGE insertional activity estimates for these species, and they can help us to prioritize the overall

226

importance of MGE insertions in each species’ genome evolution. In summary, we have demonstrated

227

that the MGE repertoire and rate of insertion varies significantly across different pathogenic species;

228

however, as a general rule, as more isolates are analyzed, more novel insertions are identified.

229

Characterizing MGE passenger proteins

230

While the most minimal MGE contains only a transposase, which is a gene encoding its own

231

excision and repositioning in the genome, many MGEs contain additional genes referred to as passenger

232

genes. For most species, the majority of the elements appearing in more than one position in the genome

233

contain an open-reading frame (ORF) that codes for a protein homologous to known transposases (Figure

234

3a). As the number of unique insertions associated with an element increases, the probability that it

235

contains a transposase tends to increase. This strongly indicates that these elements we have identified

236

are in fact mobile. However, other elements do not contain such transposases and appear frequently

237

throughout the genome, such as Group II introns seen in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and P.

238

aeruginosa isolates (Fig. 3c). We find that 67 MGEs identified that contain two or more predicted ORFs

239

that could not be annotated using the annotation software Prokka, indicating that their function may be

240

as yet unknown (Figure 3b,d).

242

Many of the MGEs that we identified contained passenger ORFs with well-annotated functions (Figure

243

3c,d). Several elements contain known antibiotic resistance genes as annotated by ResFinder (Zankari et

244

al. 2012), including: 15 S. aureus elements coding for aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, macrolide, phenicol,

245

and trimethoprim resistance genes; 10 E. coli elements coding for aminoglycoside and beta-lactam

246

resistance genes; 5 E. faecium elements coding for aminoglycoside, macrolide, oxazolidinone, phenicol,

247

tetracycline, and trimethoprim resistance genes; one N. meningitidis element coding for an

248

aminoglycoside resistance gene, and one A. baumannii element coding for an aminoglycoside resistance

249

gene.

250

Using the annotation software Prokka (Torsten Seemann 2014), we identified 183 elements that

251

contained one or more annotated passenger genes and were found inserted in more than one location,

252

and 73 of these elements also contained at least one predicated transposase. These elements contain

253

many many well-studied mobile genes, such as the resistance genes mentioned above, as well

254

streptomycin 3'-adenylyltransferases, colicin V secretion proteins, bicyclomycin resistance proteins, genes

255

involved in mercuric resistance (merP, merR, merT, merA) (Hamlett et al. 1992), and those involved in

256

restriction modification systems (hsdS, hsdR, hsdM) (N. E. Murray et al. 1982). A variety of other MGE

257

passenger genes were identified in our workflow, such as bicarbonate transporter protein bicA, which

258

appears in a MGE at 46 different sites throughout the A. baumannii reference genome across all samples

259

analyzed. In summary, our tool has identified MGEs containing passenger proteins of known and unknown

260

function, shedding light on the phenotypic changes that may accompany these insertion events.

Analysis of MGE insertion sites reveals functionally significant

262

insertion hotspots

263

The approach we have taken allows us not only to identify MGEs de novo, but it also identifies

264

their sites of insertion with base-pair precision with respect to the reference genome. This allows us to

265

investigate the role that MGEs play in genomic evolution, identifying insertion hotspots that may indicate

266

functionally important genes and pathways. We performed an analysis of MGE insertion hotspots using

267

all unique MGE insertions in each species analyzed (Figure 4a). With the exception of N. gonorrhoeae,

268

which had too few insertions to analyze, we identified several MGE insertion hotspots for all species, with

269

635 being identified in total (Supplementary Table 7). We find that 236 of the hotspots appear to directly

270

overlap with predicted coding sequences, indicating loss-of-function, while 183 are upstream of the

271

nearest gene, and 216 are downstream of the nearest gene, which are more difficult to functionally

272

interpret.

273

We sought to identify genes that are frequently near MGE insertion hotspots both within and

274

across species. After assigning each hotspot to the closest predicted coding sequence, we clustered all

275

translated proteins by 40% amino acid similarity and 70% sequence coverage. We then identified

276

homologous genes within the same species that were near insertion hotspots, as well as homologous

277

genes that were near hotspots in multiple species. Three such genes were near multiple hotspots both

278

within and across species: hok/sok toxin-antitoxin system component, with four homologs near hotspots

279

in E. coli and two near hotspots in K. pneumoniae; outer membrane porins N and C (ompN/ompC) in E.

281

hotspots in K. pneumoniae; and Regulatory protein spxA in S. aureus and E. faecium, with one homolog

282

near a hotspot in S. aureus, and two homologs near hotspots in E. faecium. The enrichment of hok/sok

283

components is interesting, and may indicate that disruption of these toxin-antitoxin systems by MGE

284

insertion is a common adaptive strategy in both of these species (Hayes 2003).

285

Seven other homologous genes were found to be near multiple insertion hotspots within the

286

same species, including three homologs of PPE family protein PPE15 in M. tuberculosis, two IS987

287

transposases in M. tuberculosis, Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 1 and 2 (pphA, pphB) in E. coli,

288

three IS5 family transposases in A. baumannii, two cold shock proteins cspD and cspLA in E. faecium, two

289

homologs of general stress protein glsB in E. faecium, and two homologous and uncharacterized genes in

290

A. baumannii. The fact that several transposases themselves are near MGE insertion hotspots suggests

291

that these regions are already disrupted by IS insertion in the reference genome, or that IS elements are

292

themselves frequently targeted by other MGE insertions.

293

Eight other homologous genes were found near hotspots across species, including lipoteichoic

294

acid synthases ltaS and ltaS1 in S. aureus and E. faecium, Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein

295

phosphotransferase ptsI in S. aureus and E. faecium, ATP-dependent RNA helicase cshA in S. aureus and

300

in A. baumannii also overlaps an MGE insertion hotspot, indicating that disruption of this drug efflux pump

target-site specificity.

a, Analysis of MGE insertion hotspots found on each species’ chromosome. Briefly, 500 bp windows were moved across the
genome in 50 bp increments, and peaks are tested using a dynamic Poisson distribution to identify windows statistically
enriched for unique MGE insertions. Hotspots were assigned to coding sequences by choosing the coding sequence closest to
the center of each hotspot. All hotspots with q-value < 0.05 are indicated with the colored points. The 15 most significant
hotspots associated with well-annotated coding sequences are shown in the text labels. Blue labels/points indicate that the
hotspot center is upstream of the listed coding sequence, red labels/points indicate that the hotspot center is within the coding
sequence itself, and green labels/points indicate that the hotspot center is found downstream of the listed coding sequence.

analyzed for each MGE to identify motifs. “% Targets” indicates the percentage of target sites containing the motif. “% BG”
indicates the percentage of randomly chosen background sequences that contain the motif.

305

An analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of all genes near a significant insertion hotspot

306

(FDR ≤ 0.05) identifies many pathways that are enriched near insertion hotspots (Figure 4b;

307

Supplementary Table 8). Several of these enriched pathways are clearly associated with antibiotic

308

resistance, including “pore complex” and “porin activity” in K. pneumoniae, and “drug export”, “response

309

to drug”, “efflux transmembrane transporter activity”, and “drug transmembrane transporter activity” in

310

E. coli. Other enriched pathways are associated with host infection and virulence, including “siderophore

311

transport” in N. meningitidis, and “cell adhesion involved in single-species biofilm formation” in E. coli.

312

Additionally, broader GO terms are enriched that generally point to transcription factor activity, such as

313

“protein-DNA complex” and “transcription factor binding” in P. aeruginosa, and “DNA-binding

314

transcription factor activity” in N. meningitidis. These findings suggest that MGE insertion hotspots in

315

these populations of pathogenic isolates may specifically modulate cellular functions such as antibiotic

316

resistance, virulence, and transcription factor activity across species.

317

Finally, we used HOMER motif analysis software to identify target sequence motifs for individual

318

MGEs. We find 55 elements have significant target sequence motifs (P < 1e-11; Supplementary Table 9;

319

Supplementary File 1). Motifs for five MGEs with particularly high target sequence specificity are

320

highlighted in Figure 4c. We find seven elements with CTAG target-site motifs, two of which are shown in

321

Figure 4c. This motif has been described previously for other IS elements (Fournier, Paulus, and Otten

322

1993). The highly specific 12 base motif identified for ISPa11 corresponds with previous studies

323

demonstrating that this element targets repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences throughout

324

the genome (Tobes and Pareja 2006). The target sequence specificity of the MGEs described here may be

325

of interest to the field of genome engineering. In summary, we find that regions frequently disrupted by

326

independent MGE insertions are associated with important biological functions such as antibiotic

327

resistance, and that by analyzing these regions we can determine the target-site specificity of these MGEs.

328

MGE insertions contribute to antibiotic resistance in laboratory

329

evolution experiments

330

Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments are powerful tools to understand how drug

331

resistance emerges. Our approach can also be used to analyze MGE insertions in an experimental context

332

from short-read sequencing data. We wanted to determine how frequently MGE insertions contribute to

333

antibiotic resistance in a controlled laboratory experiment. Studies have demonstrated in laboratory

334

grown E. coli that the rate of IS insertion is about 1/3rd the rate of point mutation, but it is unclear how

335

frequently these mutations would actually affect gene function as they seemed to selectively target

336

intergenic regions (Lee et al. 2016). Using our mustache insertion analysis tool, we re-analyzed data from

337

two ALE experiments that investigated the mechanisms by which E. coli adapts to prolonged exposure to

338

antibiotics. These included the megaplate experiment conducted by Baym et al. (2016), and the

339

morbidostat experiment conducted by Toprak et al. (2011).

insertions affecting a gene only once (yeiL, ydjN, gshA, yeaR) and excluding all point mutations/short indels affecting a gene
only once. c, An analysis of the results of the morbidostat experiment conducted by Toprak et al, supplemented with IS

341

MGE insertions play an important role in megaplate-based ALE studies of antibiotic-resistance

342

We first analyzed the WGS data collected by Baym et al. (2016), a study that introduced the

343

megaplate as a means of visually observing a migrating bacterial front across a landscape of varying

344

antibiotic concentrations (Baym et al. 2016). The authors performed a series of experiments evaluating

345

the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in the E. coli strain K-12 BW25113. Individual bacterial lineages

346

were picked from the plate and shotgun sequenced in a multiple intermediate-step trimethoprim (TMP)

347

experiment where they collected and sequenced 230 isolates. Among these sequenced isolates, we

348

identified 34 independent IS insertions (Fig. 5a,b; Supplementary Figure 4; Supplementary Table 10). Six

349

of the 14 insertion sequences annotated in the E. coli reference genome were detected at least once,

350

including IS1, IS2, IS3, IS5, IS186, and IS30. These insertion sequences directly disrupted the coding

351

sequence of 8 different genes: acrR, aroK, pitA, rng, rzpR, sspA, tufA, gshA, ydjN, yeaR, and yeiL. Other

352

insertion events occurred upstream of lon, mgrB, aroK, and flhD. In this trimethoprim-resistance

353

experiment, in comparison to the adaptive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and indel mutations

354

originally reported, insertion sequences account for 17.1% (95% CI, 11.6%-22.7%) more adaptive

355

mutations (defined as the mutations occurring in genes that are mutated independently at least twice),

356

and 24.2% (95% CI, 16.7%-31.7%) when folA substitutions/indels are excluded. This rate of IS insertion is

357

comparable to those reported in other studies of adaptation to anaerobic conditions (Finn et al. 2017),

358

and different growth conditions (Knöppel et al. 2018).

359

Six of these target genes, acrR, aroK, pitA, mgrB, tufA, and rng, overlap with the top hits of the

360

SNP and indel analysis performed by Baym et al. These were all events that either directly disrupted the

361

coding sequence or occurred just upstream, providing strong evidence for adaptation by loss-of-function.

362

The insertion sequences upstream of lon and flhD have been previously reported. The insertion of IS186

363

upstream of the lon gene often disrupts the promoter region (SaiSree, Reddy, and Gowrishankar 2001),

364

leading to down-regulation of lon. IS insertion upstream of the flhD gene, a regulator of swarming motility,

365

has also been documented (Barker, Prüss, and Matsumura 2004). This IS insertion disrupts a repressive

366

element regulating flhD, leading to increased expression of the flhD transcription factor and its target

367

genes. IS1 and IS5 insertions upstream of flhD strongly correlate with increased motility (Barker, Prüss,

368

and Matsumura 2004). Swarming motility in general is strongly associated with antibiotic resistance (Lai,

369

Tremblay, and Déziel 2009), suggesting that this gain-of-function insertion may be yet another

370

trimethoprim resistance adaptation. Taken together, this gives us an estimate of the rate of adaptive

371

mutations mediated by IS insertion in the context of TMP adaptation, explaining 17.1% more adaptive

372

mutations than were originally reported.

373

MGE insertions play an important role in morbidostat-based ALE studies of antibiotic-resistance

374

Next, we analyzed the WGS data generated by Toprak et al. (2012) where they introduced the

375

morbidostat, a selection device that continuously monitors bacterial growth and dynamically regulates

376

drug concentrations to constantly challenge the bacterial population (Toprak et al. 2011). Toprak et al.

377

treated drug-sensitive MG1655 E. coli with chloramphenicol (CHL), doxycycline (DOX), and trimethoprim

378

(TMP), and performed whole-genome sequencing on 5 independently treated cultures from each of the

379

three treatment groups. They identified point mutations and indels that evolved in independent lineages

380

in response to antibiotic treatment, and reported 14, 11, and 23 such mutations for CHL, DOX, and TMP

381

treated populations, respectively. We identified 11, 8, and 0 novel IS-mutations for CHL, DOX, and TMP

382

treated populations, respectively (Fig. 5c). The seeming lack of IS-mediated mutations in the trimethoprim

383

arm of this study relative to the megaplate study may indicate how the two experimental conditions may

384

influence IS activity in different ways. When considering only the mutations originally reported by Toprak

385

et al., in the populations treated with CHL and DOX, IS insertions caused 11/25 (44%) and 8/19 (42%) of

386

antibiotic-resistance mutations, respectively. In the originally reported results for this study, two

387

independent nonsense mutations were identified in the acrR gene across the ten CHL and DOX samples.

388

When accounting for IS insertions, all ten CHL and DOX treated populations had a disrupted acrR gene,

389

suggesting that acrR disruption is a major component of CHL and DOX resistance in the context of this

390

morbidostat experiment. Additionally, the lon promoter-disrupting IS insertion observed in the study by

391

Baym et al. was observed in this study in three of the five doxycycline replicates. The lpxM gene was

392

disrupted in one doxycycline replicate, and slyA was disrupted in one chloramphenicol replicate. Again,

393

this demonstrates the key role and high rate of IS insertions as mutations that confer antibiotic resistance,

394

and that their inclusion in analysis of such experiments is critical to forming a more complete

395

understanding of genetic mechanisms of adaptation.

396

MGE insertions contribute to antibiotic resistance in clinical

397

isolates

398

While these in vitro findings do suggest that MGE insertions contribute to many of the adaptive

399

mutations to antibiotic resistance, we wanted to determine if these results were supported among clinical

400

isolates. Our approach can help us to understand the role of MGE insertions in the acquisition of antibiotic

401

resistance in a well-annotated clinical isolate collection. The isolates downloaded from the SRA database

402

and described in previous sections of this study were a random sampling of what is publicly available,

403

which limits our interpretation of the results. It is not immediately obvious what phenotypes the MGE

404

insertion hotspots may be linked to, for example. In the case of E. coli, the downloaded samples may

405

include repeatedly sequenced isolates of a few common laboratory strains, such as K-12. To address these

406

concerns and to perform a more precise analysis, we downloaded two collections of clinical E. coli isolates

407

with available antibiotic resistance phenotype information.

408

The first is a collection of 241 E. coli bacteremia isolates previously investigated in a bacterial

409

genome-wide association study (GWAS), where the authors identified several polymorphisms, k-mers,

410

and genes associated with antibiotic resistance, but did not directly investigate insertion sequence activity

411

(Stoesser et al. 2013; Earle et al. 2016). This collection was obtained from patients at the Oxford University

412

Hospitals NHS Trust, and will be referred to as the “Hospital” collection. The second collection includes

413

260 E. coli clinical isolates collected from various locations across the United States. Several of these

414

isolates were sequenced and analyzed in connection with the FDA-CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Bank.

415

This collection will be referred to as the Multi-drug resistant (MDR) collection.

416

Antibiotic resistance phenotypes for the Hospital collection isolates were available for the drugs

417

ampicillin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin (Supplementary

418

Figure 3a). There is a range of drug susceptibilities across the isolates, with 42 isolates being susceptible

419

to all 7 drugs tested, and 19 being resistant to all drugs (Supplementary Figure 3) tested. The MDR

420

collection includes samples taken from a wide variety of sources, but the majority are isolated from urine

421

(n = 146), and blood (n = 70). Isolates in the MDR collection include resistance information for 15 to 24

422

different antibiotics, with 16 antibiotics being tested on 200 or more samples (Supplementary Figure 3a;

423

Supplementary Table 11). Included in the MDR collection are several isolates that are resistant to a

424

carbapenem antibiotic (ertapenem or meropenem), a class of antibiotics often used as a drug of last

425

resort. As expected, the Hospital collection contains more antibiotic susceptible organisms, whereas the

426

MDR collection contains more multi-drug resistant organisms (Supplementary Figure 3b). Phylogenetic

427

analysis indicates that isolates from both collections can be found in most major lineages (Supplementary

428

Figure 2c,d).

429

We ran mustache on both of the isolate collections, and performed a MGE insertion hotspot

430

analysis (Figure 6a). We compared the hotspots in each collection with the hotspots found among the

431

randomly downloaded SRA isolates, and identified 9 hotspots that replicated across the MDR, Hospital,

432

and randomly-downloaded SRA collections. We find that acrR replicated across all three collections

433

(Figure 6a,b); hotspots near an L,D-transpeptidase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gnd, and

434

lipoprotein yiiG replicated between the hospital collection and the random SRA collection; and hotspots

435

near the outer membrane porin ompF (Figure 6a,c), DNA-binding transcriptional activator/c-di-GMP

436

phosphodiesterase pdeL, outer membrane porin C ompC, uncharacterized protein ygcG, and fructose 1,6-

437

bisphosphatase yggF replicated between the MDR collection and the random SRA collection (Figure 6a,c).

438

The location of genes involved mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance near hotspots in different

439

collections of isolates is compelling evidence that mobile element insertion hotspots indicate important

440

adaptations, and are not merely sinks for random, functionally insignificant insertions. The acrR and ompF

441

mutations are well-described antibiotic resistance mutations (Harder, Nikaido, and Matsuhashi 1981;

442

Jellen-Ritter and Kern 2001a), and the impact of the mobile element insertions within the other hotpots

443

should be investigated further for functional significance. It should also be noted that while the gnd

444

hotspot is closest to the gnd coding sequence, it is also directly upstream of the gene ugd, a UDP-glucose

445

6-dehydrogenase, which may be the functionally relevant gene.

446

Finally, we wanted to determine the extent to which MGE insertions are informative in a microbial

447

genome-wide association study (GWAS). Microbial GWAS are growing in popularity as methods for

448

controlling for population structure in clonally reproducing species improve, and as more sequenced

449

isolates with well-annotated phenotypes are becoming available. We used MGE insertions as predictors

450

in a linear mixed model to predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes in the Hospital and MDR collections.

451

For each antibiotic resistance phenotype, all resistant isolates within each collection were considered

452

cases while the sensitive isolates were used as controls. We performed tests for the presence/absence of

453

a single insertion at a specific site, as well as tests for the presence/absence of any insertion in a given

454

gene or intergenic region. We used the linear mixed model implemented in GEMMA, a commonly used

455

approach to control for population structure and sample relatedness (Zhou and Stephens 2012)

456

(Supplementary Table 12).

Text descriptions indicate the region in which the MGE insertion has taken place: The dotted line is equal to a -log10 P value
cutoff of 6.5, a stringent Bonferroni cutoff used in the comprehensive SNP, indel, and gene presence/absence GWAS originally
conducted on the Hospital dataset by Earle et al. (2016).

457

We see a region between the genes yeeW and yeeX where an insertion associated with antibiotic

458

resistance exists in both collections (MDR collection, P = 3e-9; Hospital collection, P = 4.2e-4), but with

459

opposite directions of effect, being associated with resistance to meropenem in the MDR dataset, but

460

sensitivity to ceftriaxone in the Hospital dataset. In the E. coli K-12 reference, this region contains a

461

putative uncharacterized protein yoeF that was not annotated in our pipeline (Keseler et al. 2017). The

462

insertion identified at this site is an ISEc23 (IS66 family) insertion at position AE014075.1:2368401 in the

463

CFT073 reference genome, near the end of the cryptic prophage CP4-44. The deletion of this prophage

464

reduces cell growth and biofilm formation (Wang et al. 2010), and it contains the YeeV-YeeU toxin-

465

antitoxin system which has been linked to bacterial persistence. The exact impact of these insertions must

466

be further validated experimentally, but the fact that they replicate across distinct collections, albeit in

467

different directions, is intriguing.

468

Both the fepE coding sequence disruption (P = 8.2e-14), and a single IS150 insertion into methyl-

469

accepting chemotaxis protein trg (P = 1.3e-14) are associated with increased sensitivity to amoxicillin-

470

clavulanic acid. The gene fepE regulates LPS O-antigen chain-length, ultimately influencing virulence (G. L.

471

Murray, Attridge, and Morona 2003). We hypothesize that coding sequence disruptions of fepE affect

472

virulence in such a way that it changes the cells virulence and nature of the infection, and the subsequent

473

antibiotics that it is exposed to. It is unclear how the trg disruption may be biologically related to beta-

474

lactam/lactamase inhibitor activity. One potential model that may explain the observation that loss-of-

475

function of the trg gene is associated with increased antibiotic sensitivity is that the trg gene product,

476

located in the inner membrane with a region that protrudes into the periplasmic space, may serve as a

477

sink for either amoxicillin or clavulanate, and thus may prevent antibiotic activity in the periplasm. Of

478

course, validation of these associations and predicted mechanisms of action are necessary going forward.

479

Other associations can be more easily interpreted. Insertions into the ompF gene are associated

480

with meropenem resistance (P = 5.1e-5) in the MDR collection, a gene whose disruption is a known

481

mechanisms of resistance (Harder, Nikaido, and Matsuhashi 1981). MGE insertions into the nanC N-

482

acetylneuraminic acid-inducible outer membrane channel are associated with gentamicin resistance in

483

the MDR collection (P = 2.8e-7), which may reduce cell permeability to this drug. To our knowledge, the

484

association between this particular porin and antibiotic resistance in E. coli has not been described

485

previously.

486

In the hospital dataset, insertions into the fhlA gene are the strongest association, corresponding

487

with resistance to tobramycin and gentamicin (FDR-adjusted P = 9.9e-7). This gene is a transcriptional

488

activator for the formate hydrogenlyase system, and thus would be expected to upregulate formate

489

metabolism (Rossmann, Sawers, and Böck 1991). Formate metabolism may increase the proton motive

490

force (Kane et al. 2016), and it has been demonstrated that the proton motive force enhances uptake of

491

aminoglycoside antibiotics (Allison, Brynildsen, and Collins 2011), whose target is intracellular. Thus, fhlA

492

null mutants, generated by MGE insertions disrupting this gene, may confer antibiotic resistance through

493

decreased formate metabolism and proton motive force resulting in decreased uptake of aminoglycosides

494

such as tobramycin and gentamicin.

495

It should be noted that most of the associations did not meet the most stringent significance

496

cutoff that would be used in a full microbial GWAS, and that the effects associated with these insertions

497

are relatively small compared to the effect seen in association with the presence of a beta-lactamase

498

gene, for example. Many of the functional effects caused by MGE insertions could also be caused by point

499

mutations and short indels, which are not being evaluated here. But by including MGE insertions in a full

500

microbial GWAS design, this may highlight mechanisms of resistance that would otherwise be ignored,

501

adding additional information and improving overall predictive power. In summary, a GWAS of MGE

502

insertions is useful for understanding genomic variation that contributes to antibiotic resistance, and we

503

have identified several candidate genes that will require experimental validation in the future.

504

Discussion

505

Moving beyond base-pair substitutions and small insertions/deletions will allow us to better

506

understand genomic evolution of these important pathogenic bacteria. Here, we have demonstrated an

507

approach to genotyping large insertions from short-read sequencing datasets that is sensitive and precise.

508

Applying this approach to an analysis of several thousand bacterial isolates of nine different pathogenic

509

species, we identified several known and novel MGEs. We find that the MGE mutational spectrum directly

510

highlights genes involved in antibiotic resistance. We show that MGE insertions frequently contribute to

511

the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in E. coli laboratory experiments and report the first bacterial

512

genome-wide association study of large insertions, an analysis that highlights potential mechanisms of

513

multidrug resistance mediated in part by MGE insertions.

514

MGE insertions are often ignored, as few accessible tools exist that allow them to be easily and

515

thoroughly investigated in the context of short-read sequencing. Using an approach that allows us to

516

thoroughly characterize MGE insertions from short-read sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that much

517

can be learned about MGE insertions. We focus on analyzing publicly available datasets in part to

518

demonstrate the value in re-analyzing such data with novel methods.

519

Our analysis provides strong evidence that as more isolates of a given species are analyzed, more

520

MGE insertions are identified, suggesting that these elements are active in each of the species analyzed,

521

although the level of activity of these elements seemed to vary between organisms. Of particular note,

522

we find that certain species, such as E. faecium, have particularly high MGE activity; to our knowledge,

523

this is the first time this has been shown, as estimates of the relative activity of MGEs across species are

524

scarce and are derived from a small number of environmental isolates or laboratory experiments. This

525

suggests that certain species rely more heavily on MGE movement as a mechanism of adaptation and

526

evolution than other species.

527

Because our approach is not restricted to any one class of MGE, we identify insertion sequences,

528

transposons, integrons, group II introns, and other classes of MGEs in this analysis. Many of the MGE

529

insertions we identified contained passenger genes coding for known functions, such as antibiotic

530

resistance genes; however, many MGEs contained largely uncharacterized proteins, which we anticipate

531

may provide interesting adaptive advantages to the host bacterium. The passenger genes encoded in

532

these MGEs can spread rapidly between organisms and selective forces likely impact the retention versus

533

loss of these elements in individual organisms and in communities of organisms, such as microbiomes.

534

Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that individuals with very similar gut microbiomes can harbor very

535

different MGE repertoires (Brito et al. 2016). This suggests that monitoring the MGE potential of

536

individual bacterial species and microbiomes will inform our understanding the extent of and

537

consequences of MGE-derived genetic variation.

538

MGEs may contribute to organismal fitness by bringing new genes and functions to an organism.

539

Alternatively, minimal MGEs such as IS elements may impact organismal fitness by insertional

540

mutagenesis. Because our method allows us to both identify MGEs and their insertion sites, we are able

541

to use MGE insertion sites accumulated across sequenced isolates to identify insertion hotspots

542

throughout each bacterial genome. We find genes that are repeatedly “hit” by insertional mutagenesis,

543

such as acrR, a gene involved in sensitivity to many different antibiotics (Jellen-Ritter and Kern 2001b).

544

Insertional loss of function of the gene is identified at a high rate in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and A.

545

baumannii and likely correlates with increased antibiotic resistance of these organisms. In addition to

546

identifying genes known to be involved in antibiotic resistance, we identify additional genic “hotspots”

547

that may represent additional, novel genes involved in antibiotic sensitivity and resistance.

548

When we apply this method to previously published adaptive laboratory evolution experiments

549

on E. coli, we find that insertions comprise a large proportion of the acquired mutations in laboratory E.

550

coli. We find that by including MGE insertions in these analyses, the importance of acrR loss-of-function

551

mutation as an adaptation to antibiotics is enhanced, re-prioritizing these mechanisms of resistance. A

552

final observation that results from identifying “where” IS elements land within the genome is that certain

553

target sites appear to be hit by specific IS elements. These sequence-specific transposases may have value

554

in genetic engineering applications. Thus, by identifying the locations where IS elements accumulate, we

555

can identify genes important for bacterial fitness and the molecular specificity of transposase genes.

556

Given the strong evidence that MGE insertions accumulate near genes involved in mechanisms of

557

antibiotic resistance, and that MGE-mediated mutagenesis can confer antibiotic resistance in adaptive

558

laboratory evolution experiments, it follows that MGE insertions may genetic features that can inform

559

clinical antibiotic resistance. A GWAS analysis using IS element location as a feature demonstrates the

560

utility of using MGE insertions as predictive features, and points to new genes and intergenic regions

561

associated with multi-drug resistance. For example, ompF loss-of-function insertions and insertions in an

562

intergenic region between yeeW and yeeX are associated with carbapenem resistance. While the

563

mechanism associated with the yeeW-yeeX intergenic insertions remains unknown, the association of

564

these findings with resistance to carbapenems, which are drugs-of-last-resort, is certainly of interest as

565

multidrug resistance continues to spread throughout the population.

566

While the application of this method to clinical bacterial isolates and adaptive laboratory

567

evolution experiments has been illuminating in identifying novel types of MGEs with and without

568

passenger genes, genes that are potentially involved in antibiotic resistance, and the sequence specificity

569

of novel transposase enzymes, there are several limitations of this approach. First, when attempting to

570

identify large structural variants using only short read sequencing data, we necessarily rely on methods

571

that require inference, which inherently limits our precision. Unless a MGE can be fully assembled in

35 not

572

context from short-read sequencing data, we cannot say with certainty what the full inserted sequence is

573

at a given position. MGEs that consistently fail to assemble using short-read sequencing, either in context

574

or on their own as an individual contig, would evade detection using our approach. With the advent of

575

more accessible read cloud and long-read sequencing approaches (Bishara et al. 2018), we anticipate that

576

such inferences can be readily orthogonally validated. Another limitation of our approach is that it is also

577

quite computationally-intensive, with the rate-limiting step usually being the assembly of the bacterial

578

genome. Thus, adapting this approach for application to organisms with larger genomes may be limited

579

by the computational requirements associated with de novo assembly. Alternatively, our approach can

580

be used with a database of MGE queries that were previously identified, thus not requiring sequence

581

assembly. The more comprehensive database of insertion elements generated as a part of this study can

582

thus be leveraged in situations where accessing high performance computing resources is challenging or

583

cost-prohibitive. Finally, although the associations that we present between gene disruption and

584

antibiotic resistance are statistically significant, the predictions that these genes are associated with true

585

antibiotic resistance must be orthogonally tested in proper molecular experiments that test the

586

phenotypic consequences of gene knockout and rescue.

587

Leveraging knowledge linking genomic variations to clinically important phenotypes, such as

588

antibiotic resistance, will not only improve our understanding of the biological basis of bacterial

589

adaptation, but may also open the door to new therapeutic strategies. Indeed, recent studies with

590

pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum have found novel drug targets by leveraging genomic

591

variations linked to drug resistance (Cowell et al. 2018). Future studies could further investigate the

592

associations identified here. For example, disruption of the fepE gene is strongly associated with increased

593

sensitivity to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. We hypothesize that this disruption may increase cell wall

594

permeability, as a fepE homolog in Salmonella enterica has been shown to influence O antigen

595

polymerization in lipopolysaccharides (G. L. Murray, Attridge, and Morona 2003, 2005). The approach we

596

outline could also be applied to metagenomic sequencing datasets with little modification to identify

597

MGEs and their sites of insertion in a more diverse microbial community.

598

In conclusion, we have developed a new approach to thoroughly characterize MGEs and their sites

599

of insertions from short-read sequencing data. We have demonstrated the utility of this approach when

600

analyzing large publicly-available datasets, experimental data, and clinical isolates. Our analysis highlights

601

the importance of thoroughly investigating MGE insertions in prokaryotic genomes, and that only by

602

including these and other analysis in our workflows will we be able to understand these rapidly evolving

603

organisms.

two additional reference genomes - O104:H4 strain 2011C-3493 (NC_018658.1) and K-12 substrain

629

630

Up to 2000 samples for each species of interest were randomly selected and downloaded. The

631

reads in the downloaded FASTQ files were deduplicated using SuperDeduper v0.3.2 (Petersen et al. 2015)

632

and adapter sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore v0.5.0 (Krueger 2015). Samples were then aligned

633

to their respective reference genomes using BWA MEM v0.7.17-r1188 (H. Li and Durbin 2009). Samples

634

were excluded if they met the following filters: median coverage less than 40, estimated average read

635

length less than 95 or greater than 305, estimated average fragment length less than 150 and greater than

636

750, a FASTQC v0.11.7 “Per base sequence quality” quality control failure, a FASTQC “Per sequence GC

637

content” quality control failure, and a FASTQC “Per base N content” failure (Andrews and Others 2010).

638

Those sequence isolates that passed these filtering steps were analyzed further to identify MGE insertions.

Baym et al. and Toprak et al. datasets - sample selection, preprocessing, quality control

640

Baym et al. and Toprak et al. datasets were downloaded from the NCBI Sequencing Read Archive

641

(Bioproject accessions PRJNA259288 and PRJNA274794, respectively) (Baym et al. 2016; Toprak et al.

642

2011). Samples were processed by removing duplicate sequences using SuperDeduper v0.3.2 (Petersen

643

et al. 2015) and adapter sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore v0.5.0 (Krueger 2015). The Baym et

644

al. and the Toprak et al. short-read sequences were aligned to the E. coli K12 U00096.2 and NC_000913.2

645

reference genomes, respectively, as was done in the original studies.

Clinical E. coli isolate collections with antibiogram data - sample selection, preprocessing, quality

647

control

648

Two collections of pathogenic clinical E. coli isolates were used in this study. The first is referred

649

to as the Hospital collection as it represents E. coli isolates collected at a single hospital, the Oxford

650

University Hospitals NHS Trust. This included 241 isolates in total, all of which were bacteremia samples.

651

They were downloaded from the NCBI database by querying all E. coli samples in BioProject PRJNA306133.

652

The second collection, referred in this study as the Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) collection, includes

653

260 isolates collected from multiple BioProjects, including PRJNA278886, PRJNA288601, PRJNA292901,

654

PRJNA292902, PRJNA292904, PRJNA296771, and PRJNA316321 (See Supplementary Table 1). Most of

655

these isolates come from the projects PRJNA278886 (173 isolates, Antimicrobial Surveillance from

656

Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston MA) and PRJNA288601 (52 isolates, CDC’s Emerging Infections

657

Program (EIP)). Antibiograms were collected for samples from NCBI using the search key term

658

“antibiogram[filter]”. This collection represents samples taken from several locations throughout the

659

country as part of many pathogen surveillance programs. They were isolated from a variety of sources,

660

including 70 isolated from blood, 142 isolated from urine, and 27 isolated from other sources.

661

Samples were processed first by removing duplicate sequences using SuperDeduper v0.3.2

662

(Petersen et al. 2015), and adapter sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore v0.5.0 (Krueger 2015). All

663

isolates from both collections were then aligned to the E. Coli CFT073 genome (AE014075.1), a

664

uropathogenic strain used previously as a reference for clinical isolates (Earle et al. 2016). BWA MEM was

665

used for alignments (Kathiresan, Temanni, and Al-Ali 2014), with default settings in paired-end mode.

666

MGE identification pipeline

667

A combination of several previously published tools and custom tools, detailed below, were used

668

to identify MGE insertions and their sequence from short-read sequencing data. This pipeline is

669

summarized in five steps: 1) Identifying the candidate insertion sites, 2) inferring complete sequence of

670

inserted element, 3) inferring sequences from newly created reference insertions, 4) clustering elements

671

and classifying them as mobile and immobile, and 5) resolving ambiguous position-cluster assignments.

672

Identifying candidate insertion sites

673

This step is fully implemented in the mustache software package under the findflanks command.

674

The approach taken to identify candidate insertion sites was developed independently but is similar to

675

one taken recently by another group who published their tool under the name panISa (Treepong et al.

676

2018). First, the alignment is parsed to identify sites where reads are clipped according to the BWA MEM

677

alignment

678

min_alignment_quality parameter) or those that are clipped on both sides and have an alignment

679

length less than 21 base pairs (--min_alignment_inner_length parameter). First, clipped sites

680

where the longest clipped end falls below a total length of 8 are excluded (--min_softclip_length

681

parameter). Second, clipped sites that have fewer than 4 supporting reads in total are excluded (--

682

min_softclip_count parameter). Third, sites that are not within 22 base pairs of an oppositely-

683

oriented read clipped site are excluded (--min_distance_to_mate parameter).

684

In the next step, information about the un-clipped reads overlapping each of the candidate

685

insertion sites is calculated. This is an important quality control step that filters out small indels, which

686

commonly cause false positives. First, sites where the ratio of the number of clipped reads to the number

687

of total reads falls below a value of 0.15 are excluded (--min_softclip_ratio parameter). Next,

688

sites where the ratio of the number of reads that have a deletion or short insertion to the total number

689

of reads at the site exceeds 0.03 are then excluded (--max_indel_ratio parameter). This is

690

repeated for deletions located at the base pairs directly adjacent to the insertion site. These filters were

691

identified largely by iterative attempts to optimize sensitivity and precision and could be further improved

692

in the future. The result of this step is a filtered list of candidate sites.

693

With this filtered list of candidate sites, consensus sequences for the flanks of the inserted

694

element at each site are determined. It is not uncommon to see two distinct flank sequences at a single

695

site, and an approach that could distinguish between multiple sequences at a single site was taken. The

696

clipped ends are first added to a trie data structure. All of the unique paths from the parent node to the

697

leaves are traversed, resulting in a list of unique sequences seen at an individual site. These sequences

698

are then clustered with each other in a pairwise manner by truncating the longer sequence to the length

699

of the shorter sequence, and by calculating a similarity metric as the edit distance divided by the total

700

length of the shorter sequence. This matrix of similarity scores is then analyzed to identify all connected

701

components, with connections existing between all sequences with a similarity greater than 0.75. Each

702

component of sequences forms its own cluster, and this cluster is then analyzed to determine a consensus

703

sequence.

704

Next, a consensus sequence for a cluster of sequences is constructed by traversing down the trie

705

data structure and taking the base pair with the highest average quality score at each level of the trie as

706

the consensus. The trie structure is traversed until only one base read supports a given site, and the

707

consensus sequence terminated at this point. Consensus sequences that fall below 8 base pairs in length

708

(--min_softclip_length parameter) and that have fewer than 4 clipped ends supporting their

709

existence (--min_softclip_count parameter) are excluded. Finally, the list of candidate sites is

710

filtered again to only include sites that are not within 22 base pairs of an oppositely-oriented read clipped

711

site (--min_distance_to_mate parameter).

712

These candidate sites are then paired with other sites that within a specified distance and oriented

713

in the opposite direction using the mustache command pairflanks. These oppositely-oriented flanks are

714

allowed to be up to 20 bases away from each other, as many MGEs create a direct-repeat upon insertion.

715

Since many MGEs, particularly IS elements, have inverted repeats at their ends, flanks that share inverted

716

repeats near their termini are prioritized. Ties are then broken first by pairing flanks that have similar

717

number of supporting clipped reads, and then by the difference the length of the consensus sequences.

718

If ties still exist, the pairs are randomly assigned to each other, but this is a rare occurrence. If no inverted

719

termini exist between any of the pairs, then only the number of clipped reads and the difference in

720

consensus sequence length are used to pair flanks.

721

For the randomly downloaded SRA samples, a minimum supporting read count of 4 for each

722

identified flank was required. The Baym et al. data included several isolates that were sequenced at low

723

coverage (less than 20). For these low-coverage samples, a minimum supporting paired read count of 2

724

(--min_softclip_count parameter) was required, which should be roughly as sensitive as the

725

singled ended read count filter of 4 used in their initial study (2 at each clipped site, for a total of 4 in the

726

pair), the consensus sequence at each site was built from all available clipped reads by setting the --

727

min_count_consensus parameter to 1, and a minimum consensus length of 4 was used (--

728

min_softclip_length parameter). For Toprak et al., and clinical E. coli isolates with antibiogram

729

data, a minimum supporting read count of 4 (--min_softclip_count parameter) was used.

730

Inferring the complete sequence of inserted elements

731

Once candidate read flank pairs have been identified, the next step is to infer the full inserted

732

element. This approach combines a variety of methods of inferring the identity of each insertion. The

733

approach taken is described here in detail.

734

First, the identity of the inserted sequence is inferred from the assembly of the sequenced isolate

735

using the inferseq-assembly command in mustache. For each pair of flanks identified, each flank is aligned

736

to the assembly using 25 bases of context sequence for each flank in single-end mode (Supplementary

737

Figure 1a). If these consensus flanks with 25 base pairs of context sequence align to the assembled isolate

738

with the proper orientation, one can assume with high confidence that the intervening sequence is the

739

complete inserted sequence. This sequence is described as “inferred from assembly with full context”. If

740

only one of the flanks align with context, and the other partially aligns to the edge of the assembled contig,

741

this sequence is described as “inferred from assembly with half context”. These are the highest quality

742

inferred sequences, and they are prioritized above all others when genotyping an insertion.

743

Next, flanks are aligned to the assembly without any context sequence. Often, these flanks align

744

to small assembled fragments, with short parts of the flank ends being clipped off at the ends of the

745

assembled contig. The full sequence is inferred by including the clipped flank ends, and the full intervening

746

sequence (Supplementary Figure 1b).

747

The next approach to infer the sequence identity is implemented in the inferseq-overlap

748

command of mustache. This infers the identity of the sequence by attempting to find high-confidence

749

overlaps between the two flank ends. This can only identify inserted elements that can be spanned by the

750

two flanks, which limits its usefulness in this study where most insertions of interest are larger than 300

751

base pairs. It is, however, useful for filtering out smaller insertions that are found to be below this 300

752

base pair length limit.

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

753

Next, flanks are aligned to the reference genome using the inferseq-reference command, and

754

inserted sequences are inferred in a similar manner to those inferred from assemblies without sequence

755

context (Supplementary Figure 1c).

756

At each of these sequence inference steps, all candidate insertions where the alignment scores of

757

both flanks are equally high are returned. For example, if a given IS element is found in multiple locations

758

throughout the reference genome, all of these locations will be reported as inferred elements

759

(Supplementary Figure 1e).

760

Inferring sequences from dynamically created reference insertion database.

761

For the purposes of this study, a filter was applied to all of the candidate insertions to only include

762

those predicted to be between 300 base pairs (bp) and 10 kbp in length. This database of candidate

763

insertions is filtered to reduce redundancy, and these inferred elements were then clustered across all

764

isolates for a given species at 99 percent nucleotide similarity using CD-HIT-EST (W. Li and Godzik 2006;

765

Fu et al. 2012). Any sequence that was inferred from the assembly, by flank overlap or from the reference,

766

is included when constructing this finalized database. This gives us a database of elements that are then

767

used as a final reference database to infer insertion sequences across all samples for a given species.

768

This final sequence inference approach, implemented in the mustache package as the inferseq-

769

database command, is similar to the sequence inference approaches implemented in the mustache

770

commands inferseq-assembly and inferseq-reference, but with a default minimum percent identity of the

771

aligned flanks of 90% (as opposed to the the 95% minimum identity required for other inference

772

commands), and the requirement that the aligned flanks map within 10 bases of the ends of each element

773

in the database in order to be considered a candidate for the inserted element at a given position (--

774

max_edge_distance parameter). This serves as the most sensitive inference approach, but the results

775

depend on how the query database is constructed.

776

Clustering elements and assigning initial genotypes

777

At this point in the pipeline, thousands of insertion positions have been identified, and the exact

778

identity of those insertions could be any number of hundreds of different inferred sequence elements.

779

Much of this information is surely redundant, however, as the differences between elements may amount

780

to one or two single nucleotide variations. To collapse this small level of heterogeneity, sequences were

781

clustered using CD-HIT at 90% similarity across 85% of their sequence (W. Li and Godzik 2006; Fu et al.

782

2012). For example, if elements X and Y are found at position A in the reference genome in two different

783

isolates, it is assumed that elements X and Y are in essence the same sequence if they cluster at 90%

784

similarity across 85% of their sequence, and it is assumed they are completely different elements

785

otherwise.

786

Before proceeding, an additional quality control step was taken. The mustache algorithm itself

787

was initially run with a maximum inferred element size cutoff of 500 kilobase pairs, and a minimum size

788

cutoff of 1 base pair. In some cases, the identity of a given insertion included several elements of differing

789

lengths, some of those elements being outside the size range of our initial 300 base pair to 10 kilobase

790

pair filter. This information was used to filter out elements that had high-confidence inferred sequence

791

identities that existed outside of the 300 base pair to 10 kilobase pair range. The tools in this study are

792

not optimized to identify insertions outside these size ranges and excluding them makes the results more

793

reliable.

794

Once elements were filtered by size and organized into clusters, insertions are assigned to a final

795

genotype as follows: First, if a given insertion is inferred from the sequence assembly with full sequence

796

context it is given highest priority and the position is assigned to that element’s cluster. Second, if an

797

insertion is inferred from the assembly with half context it is assigned to that element’s cluster. Third, if

798

an insertion is inferred by flank overlap, it is assigned to that element’s cluster. Fourth, if an insertion is

799

inferred from the assembly without context, the position is assigned to that element’s cluster. Finally, if

800

an insertion is inferred from the reference genome or from the aggregated insertion database, the

801

position is assigned to their respective clusters. It should be noted that the strand orientation of the

802

inserted element was ignored in this analysis. For example, if element X was inserted at position A in

803

isolate 1, and element X was also inserted at position A in isolate 2 but with the reverse orientation, this

804

will be considered an identical genotype for the purposes of this study.

805

Resolving ambiguous position-cluster assignments

806

In the next step, we seek to resolve ambiguous position-cluster assignments. Even after clustering

807

elements and assigning clusters to insertion sites in this manner, many ambiguities may exist. If the ends

808

of two different elements are very similar to each other, and yet they do not cluster together at the 90%

809

similarity threshold, a given insertion may have mapped to both of these clusters. It is important that

810

these ambiguities are sufficiently resolved for many of the analyses conducted in this study. We took the

811

following steps to increase our confidence in the identity of these inferred elements, and these steps were

812

implemented primarily in custom R scripts.

813

First, the number of non-ambiguous positions within the reference genome where each element

814

cluster is found are counted. This is first done for only insertions that are inferred from the isolate’s

815

assembly with sequence context, the highest confidence set. If a given cluster is found at more than one

816

of these high-confidence insertion positions, it is classified as a “strict MGE”. These requirements are then

817

relaxed to include all non-ambiguous position-cluster assignments, the next highest confidence set, and

818

all clusters that are found at more than one position in the reference genome are classified as “lenient

819

MGEs”.

820

Next, ambiguous element assignments are counted. The ambiguous element assignments are first

821

resolved by calculating the frequency of each cluster at each position within our population and assigning

822

the ambiguous insertion to the most frequent cluster at that position. For example, if an ambiguous

823

insertion at position A in isolate 1 maps to both clusters X and Y, and throughout the population cluster X

824

is found more frequently than cluster Y at position A, then cluster X is assumed to be the correct

825

assignment at position A in isolate 1.

826

Finally, if any ambiguous position-cluster assignments remain, they are then resolved by

827

prioritizing “strict MGEs” described above. Our assumption is that if the insertion at position A maps to

828

both clusters X and Y, and X is a MGE whereas Y is not, then assign position A is assigned to cluster X. If

829

any ambiguous position-cluster assignments remain after this step, clusters are assigned using the

830

“lenient MGEs”. If a given insertion is still ambiguous, it is left in as an ambiguous insertion, but still

831

considered in several analyses where cluster ambiguity is irrelevant.

832

Final quality control filter to remove low-confidence elements

833

As a final quality control measure, elements that were never successfully inferred from the

834

sequence assembly of any analyzed isolate were removed. When analyzing the results from the randomly

835

selected Illumina short-read data, it was found that 306 element clusters (9.3%) corresponding to 130

836

unique insertion sites (0.34%) were only identified by inferring their identity from the reference genome

837

(See Supplementary Figure 1c). That is, these elements were never identified within their expected

838

sequence context within the assembly, and they were never identified outside of the expected sequence

839

context within the assembly. We considered these to be low-confidence elements, and both the elements

840

and their sites of insertion were excluded from all subsequent analyses.

841

Simulations of key steps in the pipeline

842

To test the sensitivity and precision of our pipeline, we carried out various simulations. Here we

843

demonstrate that the candidate insertion identification and sequence inference steps are both sensitive

844

and precise. The organisms simulated and the accession numbers of their genomes are as follows:

mutation rate, coverage, and library read length were combinatorially selected and ten replicates of each

849

combination of parameters were carried out. We simulated 32 MGE insertions by randomly selecting

850

insertion sites, using 16 species-specific IS elements downloaded from ISfinder and chosen at random,

851

and 16 randomly generated sequences between 300 and 10,000 base pairs in length. We simulated two

852

mutation rates (0.001 mutations per base pair and 0.0085 mutations per base pair, with 10% of mutations

853

being indels) using DWGSIM v.0.1.11-3 (https://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM). One study of S. aureus

854

strains found the average pairwise distance between strains to be 0.0085 (Takuno et al. 2012), which

855

motivated this choice of mutation rate. Theses simulations included various genome coverages (5, 10, 20,

856

40, 60, 80, and 100x), and various read lengths (100, 150, 300bp), and aligned reads to genomes in paired-

857

end mode with BWA MEM (Kathiresan, Temanni, and Al-Ali 2014). In total, this resulted in 420 simulated

858

genomes per species. ANOVA tests implemented in R were used to analyze which factors influence

859

precision and sensitivity. The mustache tool was run on these simulated samples with the default

860

parameters.

861

For comparison, these simulated genomes were also analyzed with panISa, and the results were

862

compared directly to those of mustache. The parameters used for panISa were chosen to most closely

reflect the mustache default parameters and included setting the minimum number of clipped reads to

A unique insertion is defined as a specific cluster assigned to a specific insertion position. Using

872

the insertions that were identified, the number of new insertions identified as additional samples were

873

analyzed was calculated. The ‘specaccum’ function provided by the vegan package v2.5-3 was used to

874

estimate the accumulation curve for these insertions (Oksanen et al. 2011). The “random” method was

875

used to estimate the curve, with 100 permutations.

876

Calculating rare insertions per megabase

877

For each species, the number of rare insertions per megabase of genome was calculated. The

878

allele frequency of each insertion was calculated by dividing the number of isolates where the insertion is

879

observed by the total number of isolates analyzed for the species. This list was then filtered to only include

880

insertions with an allele frequency less than 0.01 (1% of isolates), and we then calculated the number of

881

such rare insertions per isolate. The number of megabases for each sample with non-zero read coverage

882

was then calculated by analyzing the alignment files for each isolate, and the number of rare variants per

883

isolate was divided by this number of megabases.

884

Annotating identified elements

885

All identified elements were annotated using the Prokka v1.13 annotation software (Torsten

886

Seemann 2014). This approach uses a rapid hierarchical approach to classify proteins, with the databases

887

being derived from UniProtKB. Default settings were used, with the exception of the added flags ‘--

888

kingdom Bacteria’ and ‘--metagenome’. The ‘metagenome’ flag was used to improve prediction of genes

889

in short contigs. All unique identified elements were annotated, not just the cluster representatives.

890

Transposases are poorly annotated using the Prokka annotation pipeline, and they are often

891

described only as “hypothetical” proteins, so a different approach to identify potential transposases was

892

necessary. The profile hidden markov models (pHMMs) constructed by the creators of the ISEScan

893

software were used to identify potential transposases (Xie and Tang 2017), using Prokka predicted

894

proteins as inputs. All such proteins with e value < 10-4 were considered to be transposases. These

895

predicted transposases were used as a reference for constructing Figure 3. Elements that contained only

896

predicted transposases and no other ORFs were classified as IS elements (Figure 1d).

897

Describing MGEs with unannotated passenger genes

898

An unannotated gene is defined as one that was only described as “hypothetical” by Prokka and

899

was not annotated as a transposase using the ISEScan profile hidden markov model. A single MGE cluster

900

may not always be annotated in the same way across all members of the cluster, as mutations may disrupt

901

open-reading frames in some members of the cluster. To account for this, the number of unannotated

902

genes in each member of the cluster was counted, and then the average number of annotated genes

903

across all members was calculated. This number was rounded to the nearest whole number, and this value

904

was considered to be the predicted number of unannotated genes contained within the MGE. Figure 3b

905

shows all of the MGEs that contain two or more unannotated genes.

906

Describing MGEs with annotated passenger genes

907

Figure 3c was generated to summarize the annotated passenger genes that were contained within

908

predicted MGEs. If any member of a given element cluster was found to contain an annotated gene, then

909

the entire cluster was predicted to contain the identified gene. The number of insertion sites where the

910

predicted MGE at the specified site contained the annotated gene of interest was calculated. The

911

passenger genes that appeared at the most unique locations throughout each organism’s genome are

912

presented in Figure 3c.

913

Annotating reference genomes

914

Rather than relying on the annotations provided by the NCBI GFF, each organism’s reference

915

genome was annotated using Prokka to ensure that annotations across species were comparable to each

916

other in quality. Prokka v1.13 was used with default settings. The gene names identified by Prokka were

917

used to describe genes in Figures 4a and 6a (Supplementary Table 6).

918

Insertion hotspot analysis

919

Regions of the genome with high numbers of unique insertions are described in this study as

920

insertion hotspots. The approach taken here resembles approaches taken by ChIP-seq peak calling

921

algorithms, such as MACS (Feng et al. 2012). All unique insertions found throughout each organism’s

922

genomes were extracted. Sliding windows of 500 base pairs, with 50 base pair steps, were created across

923

each organism’s genome. The number of insertions found within each window was calculated using

924

bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010). To determine if a given window was enriched for insertions, a Poisson

925

distribution was used to model the insertion distribution, with a dynamic parameter 𝜆#$%&# . This

926

parameter is calculated as

927

𝜆#$%&# = max(𝜆'( , 𝜆)*+, , 𝜆)-*+, )

928

Where the term 𝜆'( describes the estimated rate of insertion calculated across the entire genome, 𝜆)*+, is

929

the estimated rate of insertion within 1 kbp of the window being tested (500 bases on either side of the

930

window), and 𝜆)-*+, describes the estimated rate of insertion within 10 kbp of the window being tested.

931

The estimated value of 𝜆#$%&# is then used in a one-sided exact Poisson test to determine if the observed

932

insertion rate for the window exceeds the expectation, using the ‘poisson.test’ function in R. Adjusted for

933

the local insertion rate, this should account for biases in the local insertion rate, identifying windows that

934

are significant above this background level.

935

Significant insertion hotspots were then calculated as those that met FDR≤0.05. Once these

936

significant insertion hotspots were identified, overlapping hotspots were merged into single regions.

937

These insertion hotspots were then associated with nearby genes. This was done by first restricting the

938

edges of each hotspot to begin and end at the exact site of the first and last insertions that they contain,

939

effectively tightening the region edges to directly surround their insertions. The center point of each

940

region was calculated and used to associate this region with the nearest gene. This resulted in a list of

941

significant hotspots associated with specific genes in the reference genome.

942

Insertion hotspots near homologous genes within and across species

943

To determine if homologous genes within and across species were found near MGE hotspots, all

944

protein sequences that were mapped to insertion hotspots previously were extracted. These proteins

945

were then clustered using the CD-HIT algorithm at 40% sequence identity across 70 % of the sequence. If

946

protein sequences clustered with each other across species, they were considered cross-species insertion

947

hotspots. If multiple protein sequences near hotspots from the same species clustered with each, they

948

were considered within-species insertion hotspots.

949

Insertion hotspot gene ontology enrichment analysis

950

This approach was taken to determine if the genes near hotspots were enriched for any particular

951

function. Gene ontology (GO) terms were used for this purpose. To map genes to gene ontology terms,

952

the Prokka predicted protein sequences were mapped to the UniRef90 database (Suzek et al. 2015) with

953

DIAMOND (Buchfink, Xie, and Huson 2015) with an e value cutoff of 10-5, choosing the top result as the

954

representative. The database identifier mapping (‘Retrieve/ID mapping’) service provided by UniProt was

955

used to map the IDs of each protein to all other proteins that clustered at the level of UniRef90, and then

956

mapped these proteins to the GO terms associated with them in the UniProt database. In other words,

957

the GO terms associated with each annotated protein include all of those assigned to it or any homologs

958

that cluster with it in the UniRef90 database. All of the coding sequences near an insertion hotspot were

959

taken, and enriched GO terms were identified using the hypergeometric test, with all proteins with at

960

least one GO term of any type used as a background. Only GO terms containing five or more genes, with

961

two or more of these genes being found near a hotspot, were tested. A significance cutoff of FDR ≤ 0.05

962

was used to determine significant GO enrichments.

963

Target-sequence motif discovery

964

The HOMER motif analysis tool was used to identify target-sequence motifs for MGEs with 10 or

965

more different insertion sites. HOMER findMotifsGenome.pl was executed with default parameters, and

966

searched for motifs of size 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 within the reference of genome of each species. Randomly

967

selected sequences from the reference genome were used as background sequences. All de novo motifs

968

that met a p-value cutoff of 1e-12 were reported, choosing the most significant motif for each MGE.

969

Analysis of Baym et al. megaplate experiment sequencing data

970

The large insertions found in the sequenced isolates from the intermediate-step trimethoprim

971

megaplate experiment conducted by Baym et al. were analyzed. This included 231 sequenced isolates in

972

total; of note, the sequenced isolates had widely varying sequence coverage. The sample sequencing

973

coverage was calculated as the median sequencing coverage across the entire genome. Across all 231

974

isolates, the median isolate was covered by 19 reads, with 31% of isolates having median coverage less

975

than 15, and 5.6% being covered at a genome-wide median coverage of 0. As was done in the original

976

publication, all sequenced isolates were analyzed, including these low-coverage samples to see if any

977

insertions could be identified, but it should be noted that due to low coverage not all insertions in all

978

samples could be identified. This range of sequencing coverage can explain some of the unexpected

979

patterns of inheritance observed in Figure 5a.

980

The samples in this experiment were analyzed with the complete insertion identification

981

workflow. If an isolate was found to have a median coverage lower than 20, more lenient parameters

982

were used by mustache to identify insertions (See Identifying candidate insertion sites).

983

Baym et al. inferred the pattern of inheritance from watching a video recording of the migrating

984

bacterial front as it grew across the megaplate. Their visually-inferred phylogeny was used to determine

985

how many independent insertions occurred across all sequenced samples in this re-analysis of their data.

986

In most cases, the inferred relationships between isolates was accurate; however, in a subset of cases, it

987

appears that the inferred relationships between isolates was inaccurate. Thus, rather than relying

988

completely on the given phylogeny, the number of independent insertions was estimated conservatively.

989

An illustration of the independent insertion events that were identified is provided in Supplementary

990

Figure 4.

991

Analysis of Toprak et al. morbidostat experiment sequencing data

992

The trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline morbidostat experiments conducted by

993

Toprak et al. were analyzed in this study. This included 20 samples in total, with 5 replicates per

994

experiment, the wild type reference, and four additional samples that represented four additional

995

colonies that grew from plating three of the replicates. All samples were covered at a median coverage

996

between 21 and 30, suggesting that there was sufficient sensitivity to detect most insertions in all samples.

997

These samples were sequenced using a single-end sequencing approach, which mustache is able

998

accommodate with some minor changes in the workflow.

999

These samples were analyzed using the same workflow used in other analysis, with a minimum

1000

clipped read count of 4 to support each insertion site. Independent mutations were identified and cross-

1001

referenced them with genome annotations to determine the genes that were most likely impacted by

1002

each insertion. It should be noted that Toprak et al. were very stringent when initially calling SNPs and

1003

indels from their datasets, requiring validation by Sanger sequencing. The IS insertions found in this study

1004

were not subject to the same strict standards of evidence.

1005

Genome-wide association study of antibiotic resistance in E. coli

1006

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was implemented using only the insertions identified

1007

by mustache as input features. Sites that were considered to be missing (due to low coverage, defined as

1008

10 read counts or less for either the 5’ or 3’ end of the insertion) in greater than 5% of samples were

1009

excluded. A feature matrix was then constructed with two types of predictors - the presence/absence of

1010

a specific element at a specific site and the presence/absence of any insertion within an intergenic region

1011

or coding sequence. In the Hospital collection, antibiotic resistance phenotypes were collected from a

1012

previous publication (Treepong et al. 2018). For the MDR collection, not all isolates were tested against

1013

all antibiotics. Only phenotypes where more than 200 samples were tested against the antibiotic of

1014

interest and more than 40 isolates were found to be resistant were analyzed. For both collections, isolate

1015

relatedness was calculated using GEMMA from the core-genome biallelic SNPs identified by the SNIPPY

1016

pipeline (T. Seemann 2015). A linear mixed model was used to perform association tests in GEMMA, and

1017

LRT p-values for each tested gene were kept. In the Hospital collection, no additional covariates were

1018

included in the model. In the MDR collection, isolation source was used as a covariate (blood, urine, or

1019

other). All tests that met a significance cutoff of FDR ≤ 0.05 were considered significant signals for the

1020

purposes of this study. A more stringent cutoff that is more reflective of a complete microbial GWAS (Earle

1021

et al. 2016) is shown in Figure 6d by a horizontal dotted line.
