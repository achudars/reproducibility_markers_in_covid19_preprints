ABSTRACT

24

Folate is an important regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis, and in utero spinal cord

25

development. Both high levels of folic acid and low levels of folate can be harmful to health, as

26

low levels of folate have been linked to several diseases while high folic acid supplements can

27

mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. Depressed patients exhibit folate deficiencies, lower levels of

28

hippocampal neurogenesis, elevated levels of homocysteine, and elevated levels of the stress

29

hormone, cortisol, which may be inter-related. Here, we are interested in whether different doses

30

of natural folate or synthetic folic acid diets can influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus,

31

levels of plasma homocysteine, and serum corticosterone in adult female rats. Adult female

32

Sprague-Dawley rats underwent dietary interventions for 29 days. Animals were randomly

33

assigned to six different dietary groups: folate deficient + succinylsulfathiazole (SST), low 5-

34

methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), low 5-MTHF + (SST), high 5-MTHF + SST, low folic acid,

35

and high folic acid. SST was added to a subset of the 5-MTHF diets to eliminate folic acid

36

production in the gut. Before and after dietary treatment, blood samples were collected for

37

corticosterone and homocysteine analysis, and brain tissue was collected for neurogenesis

38

analysis. High folic acid and low 5-MTHF without SST increased the number of immature

39

neurons (doublecortin-expressing cells) within the ventral hippocampus compared to folate

40

deficient controls. Low 5-MTHF without SST significantly increased the number of immature

41

neurons compared to low and high 5-MTHF + SST, indicating that SST interfered with

42

elevations in neurogenesis. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced plasma

43

homocysteine levels compared to controls, but there was no significant effect of diet on serum

44

corticosterone levels. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced the number of mature new

45

neurons in the ventral hippocampus (BrdU/NeuN-positive cells) compared to folate deficient

46

controls. Overall, folic acid dose-dependently influenced neurogenesis, with low levels

47

decreasing but high levels increasing, neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting this

48

region, which is important for regulating stress, is particularly sensitive to folic acid in diets.

49

Furthermore, the addition of SST negated the effects of 5-MTHF to increase neurogenesis in the

50

ventral hippocampus.

1. INTRODUCTION

54

Folate is one of the natural B-complex vitamins, is responsible for one-carbon metabolism1,

55

and converts homocysteine to methionine2. This process of reducing homocysteine levels is

56

crucial for DNA synthesis and overall health. The human body is incapable of making folate

57

endogenously. Thus, folate must be obtained through diet, such as by eating leafy greens,

58

legumes, and citrus fruits3. Folic acid is a synthetic folate analog and is added to several breads

59

and cereal products to fortify folate levels within the general population. There are however,

60

microorganisms within the human gut microbiome that are capable of synthesizing folic acid

61

from diet4. The antibacterial agent, succinylsulfathiazole (SST) is commonly added to folate

62

diets in pre-clinical research studies to prevent folic acid synthesis through the gut microbiome5.

63

Thus, SST allows for a controlled dose of folate, without the potentially confounding effects of

64

folic acid, in experimental groups. However, because the addition of SST itself may disrupt

65

neural processes via the gut microbiome. Particularly, germ free with no commensal gut

66

microbiome mice show altered neurogenesis6, thus one of the goals of the study was to compare

67

how dietary folate with versus without SST supplementation affected adult female rat

68

neurogenesis.

69

The world health organization (WHO) recommends the use of folic acid supplements to food

70

products in part to help prevent fetal neural tube development defects during embryonic

71

development7,8. However, a number of countries have not complied with the WHO

72

recommendations or have discontinued these supplements9. There are differences between

73

natural folate such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-methylfolate; 5-MTHF) and synthetic folic

74

acid, including the internal chemical structure that leads to different processes of metabolism and

75

different pathways in homocysteine clearance (reviewed in 10). For example, folic acid is more

76

bioavailable than natural folate11 in diet. In addition, overconsumption of folic acid can lead to

77

excessive levels of unmetabolized folic acid accumulating in blood12. Increased and prolonged

78

exposure to unmetabolized folic acid may confer some toxic effects in older female

79

populations13. While there are numerous studies supporting folate supplementation in women for

80

the benefit of child development, studies rarely examine whether 5-MTHF or folic acid can

81

affect women’s health. This study aimed to address this gap and directly compare how different

82

doses of both 5-MTHF and folic acid affect endocrine and neural outcomes in adult female rats.

83

Folate is an important regulator of neuroplasticity, including neurogenesis, during

84

development14,15 and during adulthood16,17. Particular attention has been paid to folate

85

deficiencies during pregnancy as it is detrimental for fetal nervous system development in

86

utero18. In adult mammals, the hippocampus retains the ability to generate new neurons

87

throughout life19,20. Although less well studied, folate levels also influence hippocampal

88

neurogenesis in adult or aging populations16,17. However, to our knowledge no studies have been

89

conducted examining neurogenesis in adult female rodents after folate manipulations and this

90

study sought to rectify this deficiency in the literature. Metabolites of the 5-MTHF and folic acid

91

metabolic cycle contribute to the formation of purine rings and the conversion of uracil to

92

thymidine for DNA synthesis21. Elevated homocysteine levels due to folate deficiencies are

93

associated with cell death and DNA damage22–24 that may lead to reduced neurogenesis. In this

94

study we used the endogenous marker, doublecortin (DCX), as it is expressed in immature

95

neurons up until 21-30 days in rats25 to examine the effects of 5-MTHF or folic acid in immature

96

neurons. In addition, we examined neurogenesis via the survival of 28-day old

97

bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/NeuN cells that were produced and survived under these dietary

98

conditions.

99

Most studies have examined the effect of folate deficiencies on neurogenesis rather than

100

folate supplementation. Previously, Kronenberg and colleagues16 showed that in aged mice (sex

101

not specified), a chronic folic acid-deficient diet for 3 months reduced the number of immature

102

(DCX) neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus compared to animals given a folic

103

acid enriched diet. In a separate study, one-month-old (juvenile) male mice maintained on a

104

folate-deficient standard rodent chow for 3.5 months showed reduced adult hippocampal cell

105

proliferation and survival of 18-day old BrdU+ cells (cells that would have been produced and

106

survived in the last 18 days of the diet) compared to a control diet17. While these reports show

107

how folate and folic acid deficiencies can reduce neurogenesis and short-term cell survival, no

108

research to our knowledge has specifically investigated the effects of folate dietary interventions

109

on adult hippocampal neurogenesis throughout the diet in healthy female rodents. Furthermore,

110

5-MTHF diets are thought to have advantages over folic acid diets, including lessening the risk

111

for masking a vitamin B12 deficiency and preventing potential negative effects of unabsorbed

112

folic acid10. Here we sought to identify whether 5-MTHF or folic acid at different doses would

113

be more effective in influencing adult hippocampal neurogenesis in females.

114

Folate and folic acid may have antidepressant properties as assessed in both clinical and

115

preclinical studies26. For example, women are more likely to present with perinatal depression

116

when they are folate deficient27. In addition, female rodents express less depressive-like

117

behaviour with higher doses of folic acid28 and, folic acid can eliminate depressive-like

118

endophenotypes in female mice that had undergone a corticosterone-induced model of

119

depression29, which was comparable to pharmacological antidepressant treatment. Depression is

120

associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis30, elevated cortisol levels31, and lower levels

121

of folic acid and elevated homocysteine32,33. One mechanism by which folic acid may contribute

122

to mood elevation is through its effects on stress hormones via homocysteine metabolism34. For

123

example, acute restraint stress increased homocysteine levels in female rats35, and 7 days of folic

124

acid supplementation (30mg/kg) slightly, but not significantly, reduced corticosterone levels in

125

female mice after three weeks corticosterone treatment29. These findings suggest that folic acid

126

may elicit antidepressant effects by reducing homocysteine and modulating the corticosterone

127

system. Thus, in the present study we examined homocysteine and corticosterone levels with

128

folate and folic acid diets.

129

Few studies have studied the differential effects of folic acid versus folate dietary

130

supplementation and thus this study was designed to examine differences between the two diets

131

at different doses on hippocampal neurogenesis, plasma homocysteine and serum corticosterone

132

levels in adult female rats. As folic acid can be synthesized in the gut and not elsewhere in the

133

body, here we used 5-MTHF diets with or without SST to better understand the effects of folate

134

supplementation alone without folic acid. We expect that there would be differential effects of 5-

135

MTHF versus folic acid to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult female rats that

136

may be associated with changes in plasma homocysteine and corticosterone. Due to the lack of

137

data on the effects of the addition of SST in the presence of folate diets, and how it affects

138

neurogenesis, here we will compare how low folate diets with or with SST will influence

139

neurogenesis, plasma homocysteine and corticosterone, to determine if at a lower dose of folate

140

SST can negate the effects of dietary folate.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Animals
Thirty adult female Sprague-Dawley (Charles River, Quebec) rats (7 months old) were

144

individually housed in transparent polyurethane bines (24 x 16 x 46 cm) with aspen chip

145

bedding, in order to ensure proper monitoring of food consumption. Rats were maintained in a

146

12 h: 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00) and provided rat chow and tap water ad libitum.

147

All protocols were in accordance with ethical guidelines set by Canada Council for Animal Care

148

and were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. For an

149

overview of experimental procedures, refer to Figure 1.

150

2.2 Dietary Interventions

151

Animals were randomly assigned to one of the following diets (n=5/group; total n=30): 1.

152

Folate deficient + 1% succinylsulfathiazole (SST; FD+) that will serve as the control group, 2.

153

Low 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) + SST was the low folate + SST group (L5-MTHF+),

154

3. Low 5-MTHF without SST was the low folate group (L5-MTHF), 4. High 5-MTHF + 1% SST

155

was the high folate + SST group (H5-MTHF+), 5. Low folic acid (LFA), 6. High folic acid

156

(HFA). Specifically, 5-MTHF was purchased from Vitacost.com, Boca Raton, FL, USA and

157

formulated with a control folate and folic acid deficient diet (TD.06691) by Harlan Laboratories,

158

Inc., Madison WI, US, to create the 5-MTHF diets. Folic acid diets were formulated directly by

159

Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Madison WI, US with the control diet (TD.06691). The antibacterial

160

agent, SST was added to folate diets and the control diet to prevent folic acid synthesis through

161

the gut microbiome5 by Harlan laboratories Inc., Madison WI, US, directly. In animals with SST

162

treatment, it was assumed that there would not be any de novo folic acid synthesis by gut

163

bacteria, as it is commonly used to induce a folic acid deficient diet for rodents36. The control

164

diet does not contain any folate or folic acid, all other diets were identical with the exception of

165

the additional doses of 5-MTHF or folic acid per treatment group. All other vitamins as well as

166

caloric value remained the same among all 6 diets. For an overview of details regarding the diets,

167

refer to Table 1. Diets were given for 29 days. Doses were chosen based on studies in which

168

similar doses showed efficacy in increasing neurogenesis in male rats in a model of cerebral

169

ischemia37. Food consumption was monitored (food weighed) for weekly intake of folic acid or

170

folate diets. Body mass was also monitored every 7 d.

171

2.3 Estrous cycle sample and cytology

172

Vaginal lavage samples were taken on the first day of the diet, and again on the last day

173

of the diet. To determine estrous cycle stages, lavage slides were stained with cresyl violet stain

174

and classified via microscopy by cell phenotypes38.

175

2.4 Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) preparation

176

Approximately 24 h after animals began their new diet, animals received a single

177

injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 200 mg/kg dose; i.p.), dissolved in 0.9 saline for a stock

178

solution concentration of 20mg/ml. BrdU is a thymidine analogue and a DNA synthesis marker,

179

which labels dividing cells and their progeny. Thus, newly dividing cells were born in different

180

folate/folic acid environments, allowing us to investigate whether cells born into different

181

folate/folic acid environments would affect subsequent survival of these BrdU-positive (BrdU+)

182

cells. Animals were euthanized 28 days later, therefore BrdU tagged cells were 28 days old.

183

2.5 Blood collection, corticosterone, and homocysteine analysis

184

Twenty-four hours prior to dietary interventions and again after 29 days of dietary

185

intervention, blood samples were collected via tail vein. All blood samples were collected within

186

3 min of touching the cage.

187

Plasma samples were collected with the anticoagulant EDTA (37.5 mg/ml) dissolved in

188

deionized water. Plasma blood was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min immediately. Serum

189

blood samples were stored overnight at 4ºC to allow blood to clot completely, and then

190

centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The serum and plasma were collected and stored at -20ºC

191

until radioimmunoassay.

192

Total CORT (bound and free) was measured on the serum samples using the ImmuChem

193

Double Antibody 125I radioimmunoassay Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). The

194

antiserum cross-reacts 100% with CORT, 0.34% with deoxycorticosterone, 0.05% with cortisol,

195

and does not cross-react with dexamethasone (<0.01%). All reagents were halved, and samples

196

run in duplicates. Percent change in serum CORT was calculated following the formula ((CORT

197

levels after treatment – CORT levels prior to treatment)/CORT levels prior to treatment) * 100.

198

Plasma homocysteine levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass

199

spectrometry in the Analytical Core for Metabolomics and Nutrition laboratories located at BC

200

Children’s Hospital Research Institute at the University of British Columbia as described by

201

Dominguez-Salas et al.39 once after dietary treatment.

202

2.6 Tissue Collection

203

On Day 29, rats were then weighed and given an overdose of Sodium Pentobarbitol

204

(Euthanyl). Adrenal glands and ovarian tissue were collected and weighted. Rats were then

205

transcardially perfused with 60 ml cold saline followed by 120 ml cold 4% paraformaldehyde (in

206

0.1M phosphate buffer). Brains were then extracted and post-fixed containing 4%

207

paraformaldehyde overnight at 4ºC. Brains were then transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate

208

buffer at 4ºC. Brains were rapidly frozen and sectioned using a freezing microtome (Leica,

209

Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) at 30 µm in a series of 10. Sections were stored in 30 % ethylene

210

glycol/ 20% glycerol in phosphate buffer; Sigma) and stored at -20ºC until processing.

211

2.7 Immunohistochemistry

212

Doublecortin (DCX)

213

DCX is expressed in immature neurons40 between 4 hours to 21 days after production in

214

rats25 with longer timelines in mice41. In our case, DCX-expressing cells would have been

215

exposed to dietary manipulations. The morphology of DCX-expressing cells has been used to

216

show the maturity stages of these new neurons42 (proliferative, intermediate, and post-mitotic)

217

and generally the more mature morphology will indicate a longer duration of exposure of the

218

DCX-expressing cells to the diet. Thus, here we provide the number of DCX-expressing cells

219

and also the morphology of those cells to determine whether morphological phenotype different

220

with dietary condition. Immunohistochemistry for DCX was conducted as previously described

221

34,35

222

with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in dH2O for 30 min, and incubated at 4 ºC in primary antibody

223

solution: 1:1000, goat anti-DCX (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) with 0.04%

. Briefly, sections were rinsed 5 x 10 min in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), treated

224

Triton-X in PBS and 3% normal rabbit serum for 24 h. Sections were then rinsed 5 x 10 min in

225

0.1 M PBS and transferred to a secondary antibody solution with 1:500, rabbit anti-goat (Vector

226

Laboratories, Burlington, ON, Canada) in 0.1 M PBS for 24 h at 4ºC. Then, sections were

227

washed 5 x 10 min in 0.1 M PBS and incubated in ABC complex (ABC Elite Kit; 1:1000;

228

Vector) for 4 h. Sections were then washed in 0.175 M sodium acetate buffer 2 x 2 min. Finally,

229

sections were developed using diaminobenzidine in the presence of nickel (DAB Peroxidase

230

Substrate Kit, Vector), mounted on slides, and dried. Sections were then counterstained with

231

cresyl violet, dehydrated, and cover-slipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH,

232

USA).

233

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)

234

To examine the influence of dietary interventions on cytogenesis and complement our

235

DCX data with the DNA synthesis marker, BrdU. BrdU can be used as a marker of cell

236

proliferation or survival of new cells depending on the timeline between injection and

237

perfusion43. Here, we are examining the influence of diet on cell survival as we injected BrdU on

238

day 1, 24 h after dietary supplementation and perfused the animals 28 days later. Sections were

239

rinsed 3 x 10 min in 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS), treated with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in

240

dH2O for 30 min, and washed 3 x 10 min in 0.1 M TBS. Sections were then incubated in 2N

241

hydrochloric acid at 37 ºC for 30 min. And then incubated in 0.1M borate buffer for 10 min.

242

Sections were then rinsed 3 x 10 min in 0.1 M TBS and blocked with 0.3% Triton-X and 3%

243

normal horse serum (MilliporeSigma, MA, USA) mixed in 0.1 M TBS (TBS+). Sections were

244

then incubated at 4 ºC in primary antibody solution: 1:200, mouse anti-BrdU (Roche, Basel,

245

Switzerland) mixed in TBS+ solution for 30-48 h. Sections were then rinsed 3 x 10 min in 0.1 M

246

TBS and transferred to a secondary antibody solution with 1:200 anti-mouse IgG (Vector

247

Laboratories, Burlington, ON, Canada) in TBS+ for 4 h at 4ºC. Then, sections were washed 3 x

248

10 min in 0.1 M TBS and incubated in ABC complex (ABC Elite Kit; 1:1000; Vector) for 1.5 h.

249

Sections were then washed 3 x 10 min in 0.1 M TBS. Finally, sections were developed using

250

diaminobenzidine in the presence of nickel (DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit, Vector), washed 3 x

251

10 min in 0.1 M TBS, mounted on slides, and dried. Sections were then counterstained with

252

cresyl violet, dehydrated, and cover-slipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH,

253

BrdU/NeuN double labelling

255

BrdU/NeuN immunofluorescent double labelling was used to quantify the number of new

256

cells (BrdU+) that have differentiated into neurons (NeuN) and have survived within the

257

hippocampus to examine neurogenesis (Figure 4E)44. All brain slices were rinsed in tris-buffered

258

saline (TBS) 3 x 10 min and then blocked with TBS + 0.3% Triton-X and 3% normal donkey

259

serum (MilliporeSigma, MA, USA; TBS+) for 30min prior to all primary and secondary

260

antibody incubations. All primary and secondary antibody solutions were made with TBS +

261

0.1% Triton-X and 3% NDS. Briefly, tissue slices were incubated in primary 1:500 mouse anti-

262

NeuN (MilliporeSigma, MA, USA) for approximately 48hrs at 4°C. After, tissue slices were

263

incubated in secondary donkey anti-mouse ALEXA 488 (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada)

264

overnight at 4°C. Brain slices were then rinsed 3 x 10 min in TBS, fixed in 4%

265

paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then rinsed 2 x 10 min in 0.9% saline solution. Brain sections

266

then were incubated in 2N hydrochloric acid for 30min at 37°C and incubated in primary rat anti-

267

BrdU (Abchem Inc, Dorval, QC, Canada) for approximately 48hrs at 4°C. After, sections were

268

incubated in secondary donkey anti-rat ALEXA 594 (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada)

269

overnight at 4°C. Finally, sections were rinsed in TBS 3 x 10 min prior to being mounted onto

270

microscope slides and cover-slipped with PVA DABCO.

272

Doublecortin (DCX)

273

Hippocampal slices (1/10th) were exhaustively counted for DCX-expressing cells using

274

the 40x objective of an Olympus C×22LED brightfield microscope. Cells were counted

275

separately in the dorsal region (-2.76 mm to -4.68mm below bregma) and in the ventral region (-

276

5.52 mm to -6.60 mm below bregma) as previous studies have shown that these areas can serve

277

different functions45. For exhaustive DCX-expressing cell counts, all sections were counted per

278

dorsal (~8-11 sections) and ventral region (~7-14 sections; no difference in section numbers

279

between dietary groups), and then total counts per region were recorded. The total cell count was

280

then multiplied by 10 (number of slices) to obtain an estimate of the total number of DCX-

281

expressing cells in the region46. Areas of the dentate gyrus were quantified from digitized images

282

using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and volumes were calculated using Cavalieri’s

principle47. Sixty cells (n = 30 within the dorsal regions; n = 30 within the ventral region) were

284

randomly selected and were classified by type into 1 out of 3 developmental stages of DCX-

285

expressing neurons (proliferative, intermediate, and postmitotic) based on morphological

286

attributes for cell maturity analysis48. The percentage of these DCX cells in each morphological

287

state were recorded. Experimenters were blind to the treatment conditions when conducting

288

microscopy analyses.

289

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)

290

BrdU+ cells were quantified in all dorsal sections (-2.76 mm to -4.68mm below bregma)

291

and all ventral sections (-5.52 mm to -6.60 mm below bregma) using the 100x immersion

292

objective of a Nikon E600 light microscope in every 10th section of the granule cell layer

293

including the subgranular zone (~5μl of cells between the granule cell layer and hilus). For

294

exhaustive BrdU+ cell counts, all sections were counted per dorsal (~5-11 sections) and ventral

295

region (~6-12 sections; no difference in section numbers between dietary groups). We used a

296

modified optical dissector method49,50 to estimate the total number of BrdU+ and DCX-

297

expressing cells, as has been used before51–55. Total BrdU+ cell counts were determined by

298

multiplying by 10.

299

BrdU/NeuN

300

Fifty BrdU+ cells were randomly selected between dorsal (n = 25 within the dorsal

301

region) and ventral sections (n = 25 within the ventral region) using the 60x immersion objective

302

of an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. The percentage of BrdU+ cells that also expressed

303

NeuN were quantified. A neurogenesis index factor was calculated by multiplying the percentage

304

of BrdU+ cells that also expressed NeuN with the total raw count number of BrdU+ cells

305

counted as has been done in previous studies41,56.

2.9 Data Analyses

307

All data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) unless otherwise

308

specified with diet (FD+, L5-MTHF+, L5-MTHF, H-5MTHF+, LFA, and HFA) as between-

311

dentate gyrus volume, BrdU+ cells or BrdU/NeuN-positive (BrdU/NeuN+) cells were analyzed

312

using repeated measures ANOVA with diet as between-subject factors, and region (dorsal,

313

ventral) as the within-subjects factor. An additional within-subject factor of developmental

314

stages (proliferative, intermediate, and post-mitotic) for cell maturity analysis for DCX-

315

expressing cells. Effect sizes are reported for significant effects. Post hoc comparisons used

316

Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test. A priori comparisons were subjected to

317

Bonferroni correction. Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted between body

318

mass, relative organ mass, serum CORT, dorsal and ventral DCX-expressing cells, dorsal and

319

ventral BrdU+ cells, and homocysteine levels. All data were analyzed using Statistica software

320

(v. 9, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). All effects were considered statistically significant if p ≤

321

0.05, trends are discussed if p ≤ 0.10. Outliers were eliminated if higher or lower than 2 standard

322

deviations from the mean. This happened twice, one case outlier was excluded from the FD+

323

group when analyzing serum CORT levels and another outlier was excluded from the L-

324

5MTHF+ group when analyzing BrdU/NeuN cells.

3. RESULTS

326

3.1 High folic acid and folate increased adrenal mass, and low folic acid and high folate diets

327

reduced homocysteine levels diets but did not influence body mass, ovarian mass, or percent

328

change in serum CORT levels

329

The HFA group had a significant increase in adrenal mass when accounting for the

330

covariate body mass compared to FD+ (p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = 2.900) and trended towards

331

significance in higher adrenal mass compared to the LFA group (p = 0.086). H-5MTHF+ group

332

had a significant increase in adrenal mass compared to FD+ (p = 0.036, Cohen’s d = 1.575) and

333

L5-MTHF+ (p = 0.044, Cohen’s d = 1.655; main effect of diet: F(5, 23) = 3.185, p = 0.025, p2

334

= 0.409), but there were no other significant effects on adrenal mass (all p’s ≥ 0.159; Figure 2A).

335

Diet did not statistically influence body mass or ovarian mass (all p’s ≥ 0.480). Diet did not

336

statistically influence percent change in serum CORT levels (p = 0.169). Diet did not statistically

337

influence the relative 1/10th volume of the hippocampus (p = 0.811).

338

Animals did not differ significantly in estrous cycle stages at the beginning or at the end

339

of the experiment (p = 0.313, p = 0.637, respectively) nor was estrous cycle stage affected by

340

dietary treatment (p = 0.493). Overall, estrous cycle stage did not influence the number of DCX-

341

expressing or BrdU+ cells (p = 0.254, p = 0.769, respectively).

342

LFA animals showed a significantly lower homocysteine levels at the end of dietary

343

treatment compared to FD+ controls (p = 0.006, Cohen’s d = 1.501; main effect of diet: F(5, 23)

344

= 3.177, p = 0.025, p2 = 0.408; Figure 2B) and L5-MTHF animals (p = 0.009, Cohen’d =

345

1.369). H5-MTHF+ animals showed a significant reduction in homocysteine levels compared to

346

FD+ (p = 0.011, Cohen’s d = 1.956). HFA animals were trending towards significance in a

347

reduction in homocysteine levels compared to FD+ animals (p = 0.064), no other significant

348

comparisons were found (all p’s ≥ 0.100).

The HFA diet significantly increased the number of ventral hippocampal DCX-

356

Cohen’s d = 0.888) diets (Figure 3A). HFA diet significantly increased the number of dorsal

357

hippocampal DCX-expressing cells compared to H5-MTHF+ diet (p = 0.032, Cohen’s d = 0.770;

361

3.3 Animals showed significantly higher numbers of post-mitotic doublecortin cells overall,

362

particularly when treated with high folic acid and low folate without SST

363

Within the ventral dentate gyrus, post hoc analysis indicated a significantly higher

364

percentage of post-mitotic cells compared to both proliferative and intermediate cells with a

365

significant main effect of type of cells, F(2, 48) = 3.701, p = 0.032, p2 = 0.134, and a significant

interaction between type of cells and dentate gyrus region, F(2, 48) = 10.243, p < 0.001, p2 =

367

0.299 (Table 2). Within the dorsal dentate gyrus, post hoc analysis indicated a significantly

368

higher percentage of intermediate cells compared to proliferative cells (Table 2). A priori post-

369

hoc analysis indicated within the HFA diet group, there were significantly more post-mitotic

370

DCX-expressing cells compared to proliferative cells (p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 1.585) and

371

intermediate cells (p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.404) within the ventral dentate gyrus (Figure 3F),

372

and more post-mitotic DCX-expressing cells compared to proliferative cells (p = 0.001, Cohen’s

373

d = 1.592) within the dorsal dentate gyrus (Figure 3G). L5-MTHF animals also showed a

374

significantly higher percentage post-mitotic cells compared to proliferative cells only within the

375

ventral region (p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = 1.761).

Cohen’s d = 2.668) animals, and a trend towards significance in lower BrdU+ cells compared to

showed a significant reduction compared to HFA animals (p = 0.019, Cohen’s d = 0.992), with a

394

(p = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 1.874) and HFA animals (p = 0.032, Cohen’s d = 1.287). No significant

that also expressed NeuN with the number of BrdU+ cells counted in total as has been done in

419

When analyzing all dietary groups together, there was a significant positive correlation

420

between ventral total DCX-expressing cells and relative adrenal mass (mg/100g body mass, r =

4. DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that high folic acid and low folate (5-MTHF) without the

439

antibacterial SST increased the number of immature neurons (DCX-expressing cells) in the

440

ventral hippocampus compared to the folate deficient diet. In addition, both low folic acid and

441

the high folate (5-MTHF) with SST reduced neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus.

442

Furthermore, the low 5-MTHF diet group without SST had higher number of DCX-expressing

443

cells in the ventral hippocampus compared to the low 5-MTHF group with SST. The diet-

444

dependent changes in DCX-expressing cells resulted in more mature post-mitotic cells than

445

proliferative cells. However, interestingly the addition of SST, reduced the percentage of BrdU+

446

cells that also co-expressed NeuN, a marker for mature neurons, suggesting that SST influences

447

cell fate in the ventral dentate gyrus. High folic acid and high 5-MTHF with SST increased

448

adrenal mass compared to folate deficient animals. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF with SST

449

decreased plasma homocysteine levels compared folate deficient animals. Diet did not influence

450

the percent change in serum CORT levels across treatment but ventral DCX-expressing cells

451

were negatively correlated with CORT levels. Collectively, these data suggest that there are

452

dose-dependent effects of 5-MTHF and folic acid on ventral hippocampal neurogenesis in the

453

adult female rat, and that SST may interfere with these neurogenic effects.

454

4.1 High folic acid and low folate without SST increased the number of immature neurons within

455

the ventral hippocampus; low folic acid and high folate decreased neurogenesis within the

456

ventral hippocampus

457

Here, we show that high folic acid and low 5MTHF without SST increased the number

458

of immature neurons in the ventral dentate gyrus compared to folate deficient diet in adult female

459

rats. However, low folic acid and both doses of 5-MTHF groups with SST (low 5-MTHF+ and

460

high 5-MTHF+) reduced the percentage of BrdU+ cells that was also NeuN+ (28-day old cells)

461

in the ventral hippocampus. Other reports indicate that folate deficiency after 3.5 months of a

462

folate deficient diet + SST treatment decreased cell proliferation and the number of 18-day old

463

BrdU+ cells in male mice17. Our results are partially consistent with their data, as a folate

464

deficient diet in females reduced DCX-expressing cells (expressed for ~21 days) compared to a

465

high folic acid diet. However, intriguingly, neurogenesis was suppressed in high 5-MTHF with

466

SST and low folic acid groups compared to the folate deficient diet but only in the ventral

467

dentate gyrus. Together our data suggests that high folic acid can upregulate neurogenesis in the

468

short-term (immature neurons), but low folic acid and folate diets with SST reduce neurogenesis

469

(BrdU+ cells) in the longer term. We injected BrdU after 1 day of dietary treatment and perfused

470

animals 28 days later to examine 28-day old neurons (BrdU/NeuN). However, DCX-expressing

471

cells were examined after 29 days of dietary treatment, which given they are expressed for up to

472

21 days in rats25 suggests these immature neurons are younger than the BrdU+ cells and were

473

produced after more days of exposure to the diet. Here, we see more post-mitotic than

474

proliferative DCX-expressing cells in the ventral dentate gyrus, particularly when animals were

475

treated with HFA diet and low 5-MTHF without SST. This suggests that these new neurons are

476

more likely to survive into a more mature state. But, given there were no significant increases in

477

neurogenesis as measured by BrdU/NeuN this also suggests that many of these cells may die

478

prior to reaching a final mature status.

479

Furthermore, low 5-MTHF without SST, significantly increased the number of ventral

480

immature neurons compared to low 5-MTHF with SST, suggesting that SST interfered with the

481

ability of 5-MTHF to increase the number of immature neurons in low folate dose. In addition,

482

new neurons (BrdU/NeuN+ cells) produced after one day of treatment are less likely to survive

483

under diets with SST and low folic acid diet. Thus, we can infer that the addition of SST reduced

484

neurogenesis in the presence of 5-MTHF diet, which may have been due to its effects on the

485

microbiota or the reduction in folic acid. Additionally, high 5-MTHF with SST reduced

486

neurogenesis within the ventral hippocampus, but this effect however cannot be distinguished

487

between folate effects or SST effects due to the lack of a high 5-MTHF without SST group.

488

Although, for the purpose of this study, we were particularly interested in whether SST could

489

interfere with low 5-MTHF diet, future studies should consider the addition of a folate deficient

490

group without SST to determine the effects of anti-bacterial agent alone in this condition, or

491

adding SST to higher does of 5-MTHF diet to determine if there is a dose-dependent response.

492

Overall, our findings suggest strong effects of the antibacterial SST on early stages of

493

neurogenesis, which is somewhat consistent with Mohle et al.57, who found seven weeks of

494

497

Overall, our results suggest that the introduction of SST (and as a result suppressing gut

498

folic acid synthesis) can interfere with any potential effects of 5-MTHF to promote neurogenesis

499

in the adult female rat. The current study indicates that the introduction of the antibacterial SST

500

to eliminate gut folic acid synthesis negates the effects of natural 5-MTHF on neurogenesis and

501

should not be adopted in studies wishing to increase neurogenesis. In addition, different doses of

502

folic acid and 5-MTHF can affect different aspects of neurogenesis or different population of

503

cells differently within the ventral hippocampus.

504

4.2 The effects of folic acid and folate on neurogenesis, adrenal glands and CORT: Implications

505

for depression

506

In the present study, we found low folic acid and high 5-MTHF with SST reduced plasma

507

homocysteine levels. It is important to note that we utilized a folate deficient diet as a

508

comparative control group. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the effects of

509

different doses of 5-MTHF and folic acid to a folate deficient group. Furthermore, we saw that

510

high folic acid and high 5-MTHF with SST increased adrenal mass (but not serum CORT), and

511

an overall negative correlation between CORT following 5-MTHF/folic acid manipulations to

512

neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus. Our findings were more significant within the ventral

513

dentate gyrus, and this is intriguing because there is indirect evidence to suggest more mRNA of

514

glucocorticoid receptors within the ventral hippocampus, which can be affected by stress

515

exposure58. The ventral hippocampus is also highly involved in regulating the HPA-axis as well,

516

particularly in regulating the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the

517

hypothalamus59, this relationship is linked to the neurobiology of depression (reviewed in 60).

518

As mentioned earlier, increased folate and folic acid levels have been associated with

519

antidepressant-like properties. Folic acid can either act as an antidepressant alone without co-

520

current pharmacological agent61 or as an adjuvant with traditional antidepressants62. This effect

521

may be more efficacious for women62, and only effective when dietary interventions are

522

prolonged63. In the present study, we found more effects of the diet to regulate neurogenesis in

523

the ventral hippocampus. This is of interest as the ventral hippocampus is more involved in

524

regulating stress and anxiety45,64. Given that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is important for

525

mediating some effects of antidepressant efficacy65 and regulates HPA-axis negative feedback

526

via neurogenesis in ventral dentate66, this may have important implications in treatment of
20

527

depression in females. Furthermore folate boosts antidepressant efficacy and is linked to

528

depression61,62, it is possible that folic acid and folate diets can help mediate antidepressant

529

effects by influencing neurogenesis within the ventral hippocampus directly.

530

In addition, depression is associated with higher levels of homocysteine67 and elevated

531

levels of cortisol31,68 it may be that these two measures are related in part via their effects

532

following dietary folate. Other reports show in a population of healthy middle-aged men and

533

women, high cortisol levels were negatively associated with serum folate levels69, and positively

534

associated with serum homocysteine levels. Elevated levels homocysteine and low folic acid are

535

associated with depressive symptoms in middle-aged cohorts of both men and women32,33. In our

536

study, suggestions of associations between increased adrenal mass, reduced serum CORT with

537

increased immature neurons in the ventral hippocampus. However, we also see a positive

538

correlation between the number of ventral immature neurons and homocysteine levels, and only

539

a trend towards a positive correlation with BrdU+ cells. This suggests that homocysteine

540

metabolism may be involved in regulating different aspects of neurogenesis, and may also

541

underlie the differences seen between DCX-expressing cells and BrdU+ cells due to 5-

542

MTHF/folic acid treatment. Furthermore, while higher serum CORT levels overall were

543

negatively correlated to the number of immature neurons, suggesting higher CORT may suppress

544

neurogenesis, this effect is not however, affected by diet. Still, the ability of folic acid and 5-

545

MTHF to modulate the different aspects of neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus suggests a

546

potential mechanism by which dietary folate could modify mood even without the modulation of

547

CORT. In the present study, our dietary treatment was for 29 days, it is possible that with more

548

prolonged exposure of the diets we would see stronger associations between all these variables.

549

While in general, elevated homocysteine levels are associated with cell death and DNA damage

550

that can lead to reduced neurogenesis, both in vitro22–24, and in vivo23. In older male rats and

551

mice, folate supplementation lasting for at least 8-20 weeks is effective at inducing genomic

552

changes70,71. In the present study, supplement duration for 29 days may not be sufficient for

553

certain folate or folic acid diets to significantly reduce homocysteine levels and to have

554

significant effects on neurogenesis. Thus, more considerations regarding the length of dietary

555

treatment is needed for future studies. It is also crucial to note that here, we utilized healthy

556

female rats to determine whether folate and folic acid could affect biomarkers of depression such

21

557

as reduced neurogenesis, high levels of CORT or homocysteine. It is also possible that we would

558

see stronger associations between all these variables in animal models of depression.

559

Another active area of neurogenesis in rodents is the subventricular zone of the olfactory

560

bulbs. Reduced neurogenesis within the olfactory bulbs has been used as a model of depression

561

using adult male rats72, and olfactory dysfunction is seen in patients with major depressive

562

disorder73 but to our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of folate diet to influence

563

neurogenesis in this region. Hyperhomocyteinemia have been found to impair both hippocampal

564

and subventricular zone cell proliferation of neural progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo23.

565

Intriguingly, 14-day folic acid treatment in a rat model of cerebral ischemia increased

566

neurogenesis in the hippocampus and Notch1 signaling, which is critical for SVZ neurogenesis

567

in male rats37. Future studies should investigate the effects of folic acid or folate on olfactory

568

bulb neurogenesis.

569

4.3 Folic acid treatment can have different outcomes than 5-MTHF treatment

570

In the present study, we show some distinct differences in the effects of folic acid vs 5-

571

MTHF on homocysteine clearance and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the literature, there

572

are more studies utilizing folic acid compared to 5-MTHF, likely due to the fact that folic acid is

573

more bioavailable than other forms of folate and more stable11,74, the latter trait is beneficial for

574

diet fortification, and thus, more relevant for human studies and animal models. It is important to

575

note that folic acid and other forms of folate such as 5-MTHF act through distinct pathways of

576

metabolism21 and that the mode of delivery and amount consumed can change the efficacy of

577

both folic acid and folate75. Indeed, in the present study, we show that only animals with low

578

folic acid or high 5-MTHF with SST diets showed significantly reduced levels of plasma

579

homocysteine levels compared to the folate deficient group. Furthermore, only animals fed the

580

high folic acid diet and low 5-MTHF without SST, but not the 5-MTHF with SST diets, showed

581

increased number of immature neurons compared to controls. In addition, while low folic acid

582

and high 5-MTHF with SST did not influence the number of immature neurons present in the

583

ventral hippocampus, these groups did show reduced neurogenesis (BrdU/NeuN), without

584

influencing the maturation of immature DCX-expressing neurons. Additionally, high folic acid

585

increased the number of immature neurons, it did not suppress the number of mature neurons,

586

perhaps indicating that these new immature neurons could have reached maturity if we had

587

continued the treatment for a longer period, or alternatively that it takes a week of dietary

588

treatment to stimulate neurogenesis in this region. Furthermore, in the presence of low doses of

589

5-MTHF, we found that the antibacterial treatment of SST impeded the ability of 5-MTHF to

590

increase the number of immature neurons. While high 5-MTHF significant reduced

591

neurogenesis, this effect may be confounded by SST treatment. Nevertheless, overall high folic

592

acid was found to be the most effective at increasing the number of immature neurons,

593

particularly those that survived into a more mature state, without suppressing mature neurons

594

than low folic acid and 5-MTHF diets with SST. Again, this suggests that a week of dietary

595

treatment with high folic acid is needed to show stimulation of neurogenesis. Low 5-MTHF diet

596

showed similar effect compared to high folic acid than diets with SST, suggesting that without

597

SST, 5-MTHF diets is somewhat comparable to high folic acid. Thus, collectively these results

598

suggest that folic acid diets have greater efficacy to increase the number of immature neurons

599

and reduce homocysteine levels than 5-MTHF diets, and the addition of SST may be interfering

600

with the effects of 5-MTHF to influence immature neurons. Our data also show that both folic

601

acid and 5-MTHF with SST diets showed different dose-dependent effect on neurogenesis rates

602

and homocysteine clearance.

603

5. CONCLUSIONS

604

In summary, high folic acid and low 5-MTHF without the antibacterial SST increased the

605

number of immature neurons in neurons that would have been exposed to dietary treatments for a

606

week, but did not significantly affect neurogenesis in neurons produced 24 hours after exposure.

607

Low 5-MTHF without the antibacterial SST also increased the number of immature neurons

608

compared to low 5-MTHF treated with the SST, indicating that SST impaired the ability of 5-

609

MTHF to enhance neurogenesis, perhaps via its effects on the microbiome. Both low folic acid

610

and high 5-MTHF with SST decreased neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus (of cells

611

produced after only 24 hours of exposure to the diet) without influencing the number of

612

immature neurons. High folic acid and low 5-MTHF were the only intervention that increased

613

adrenal mass compared to the folate deficient group but surprisingly higher adrenal mass did not

614

correspond to higher serum CORT levels, which may indicate some disturbances in the HPA

615

axes functioning. Low folic acid significantly reduced plasma homocysteine levels at the end of

616

dietary treatment and significantly reduced neurogenesis. Overall, our findings indicate that

617

natural 5-MTHF and synthetic folic acid may act on different pathways to influence hippocampal

618

neurogenesis and homocysteine metabolism. In the presence of low 5-MTHF, SST blocked any

619

effects on immature neurons. The lack of effects of 5-MTHF diets with SST compared to folate

620

deficient animals suggests that modifications to the gut microbiota (or reductions in folic acid)

621

significantly alter the functionality and efficacy of 5-MTHF to modulate neurogenesis in the

622

hippocampus. The current study suggests that folic acid and 5-MTHF have differential effects on

623

neurogenesis, homocysteine metabolism, adrenal mass and serum CORT release depending on

624

does. Thus, we suggest that folic acid and 5-MTHF are not interchangeable. Furthermore, future

625

research should be cautioned that the use of SST in folate studies may interfere with

626

neuroplasticity.
