Abstract:
Interactions between host and gut microbial communities may be modulated by diets and play

60

pivotal roles in securing immunological homeostasis and health. Here we show that intake of feed

61

based on whole-cell lysates of the non-commensal bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus Bath

62

(McB) as protein source reversed high fat high sucrose-induced changes in the gut microbiota to a

63

state resembling that of lean, low fat diet-fed mice, both under mild thermal stress (T22°C) and at

64

thermoneutrality (T30°C). McB feeding selectively upregulated triple positive (Foxp3+RORγt+IL-

65

17+) regulatory T cells in the small intestine and colon, and enhanced mucus production and

66

glycosylation status suggesting improved gut health. Mice receiving McB lysates further exhibited

67

improved glucose regulation, reduced body and liver fat along with diminished hepatic immune

68

infiltration. Collectively, these data points towards profound whole-body effects elicited by the

69

McB lysate suggesting that it may serve as a potent modulator of immunometabolic homeostasis.

Introduction:

74

nutrients2. A well-balanced community structure is therefore essential for immunometabolic

75

homeostasis, whereas aberrant gut microbiota compositions associate with numerous diseases, both

76

within and outside the gastrointestinal tract3.

77

While therapeutic implications of rebalancing a mistuned gut microbiota appear promising,

78

inconsistent response rates in relation to both probiotics and fecal transfer studies, with occasional

79

adverse events, emphasize the complexity of such approaches. One example relates to the otherwise

80

promising probiotic candidate Akkermansia muciniphila4, where negative effects have been seen in

81

immunocompromised recipients5,6. Similarly, Prevotella copri aids in metabolizing fibers in healthy

82

individuals7 and protects against bacterial invasion in high fiber, chow-fed mice8, yet associates

83

with insulin resistance in prediabetic obese individuals and precipitates glucoregulatory

84

impairments in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice9.

Gut microbes shape intestinal immunity1 and increase the bioavailability of otherwise indigestible

85
86

An alternative to administering viable microbes is to utilize whole cell lysates, or selected cell

87

components, of non-living bacteria. Apart from alleviating global energy demands, if used as a

88

nutrient source, such components may also potently affect host physiology as recently reported for

89

A. muciniphila10 and Bifidobacterium bifidum11. In the latter example, cell surface polysaccharides

90

of B. bifidum were used to induce peripheral immune-tolerance via generation of regulatory T cells

91

(Tregs). The authors reported a pronounced increase in Foxp3+RORγt+ Tregs (pTregs), specifically in

92

lamina propria (LP) of the large intestine (LI)11. This cell type is believed to be induced by

93

commensal microbes and has emerged as a potent Treg subset, exhibiting increased lineage stability

94

and enhanced immunosuppressive capacity during intestinal inflammation compared to

95

conventional Foxp3+RORγt- Tregs (nTregs)12.

96
97

RORγt is the canonical transcription factor controlling IL-17 expression; a pleiotropic cytokine with

98

both proinflammatory and immune-resolving actions depending on the eliciting cell type and

99

physiological context13. Unfortunately, the studies describing pTreg function did not measure IL-17

100

secretion. It therefore remains unknown whether these cells exhibit normal, reduced or increased

101

IL-17 levels, and how this translates to host physiology. The impact of this predominantly colonic

102

cell subset on host metabolism also remains unknown. Still, mounting evidence points towards the

103

importance of intestinal IL-17 for controlling metabolic homeostasis14,15. IL-17+ pTregs may

104

therefore be leveraged as a ‘dual hit’ strategy to curb immunometabolic dysfunction and

105

gastrointestinal disturbances based on the immune-regulatory capacity of pTregs concomitant with

106

the metabolic benefits of gut-delivered IL-17.

107

To this end, we hypothesised that environmental bacteria, who have not been under evolutionary

108

scrutiny for host-microbe interactions, would provide an unexplored reservoir of

109

immunomodulatory stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, the methanotropic non-commensal

110

bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus Bath (McB) has previously been shown to reduce

111

inflammation and disease activity in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis24. However, the

112

impact on host metabolism and intestinal immune cells as well as mucus dynamics was not

113

addressed.

114
115

We accordingly explored the effect of using whole-cell lysates from McB as protein source to

116

reshape immunometabolism and the aberrant gut microbiota of DIO mice. We show that McB

117

lysates augment Foxp3+RORγt+IL-17+ triple positive pTregs in both SI- and LI-LP, and resets the

118

obese microbiota concomitant with reversed key disease traits of diet-induced obesity.

Materials and Methods:

122

Mice and Ethical Statements

123

All experiments were conducted in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63/EU as approved by

124

the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (#2014-15-2934-01,027). 6-7-week-old male

125

C57BL/6JBomTac and C57BL/6JRj mice were acquired from Taconic Laboratories, Denmark, or

126

Janvier Labs, France, respectively, as detailed below. All mice were allowed to acclimatize on

127

regular chow diet for the first week upon arrival and then fed a LFD for two weeks prior to study

128

initiation. Mice were kept under specific pathogen free conditions at 22 °C (T22°C) or 30 °C (T30°C),

129

as indicated, in 12 h light/dark cycle (6AM–6PM).

130
131

Housing, Diets and Experimental setup

132

Standard pelleted diets as well as protein-free western diet (WD) powder were obtained from Ssniff

133

Spezialdiäten GmBH, Germany, and stored at -20 ˚C throughout the duration of the experiment.

134

Mice were fed a compositionally defined low fat diet (LFD, S8672-E050) until study initiation. A

135

subgroup remained on LFD, whereas the remaining mice were transferred to a soy oil based

136

reference WD (S8672-E025) (high fat, high sucrose, containing 0.15% cholesterol) for the run-in

137

period (12 or 21 weeks dependent on the experiment). Experimental WDs were lot-matched and

138

produced without protein (S9552-E021), which was subsequently added, and then pelleted, by the

139

investigators as indicated; WDREF = containing 19.5% (w/w) casein, WDCNTL = containing 16.5%

140

(w/w) casein and 3% Macadamia oil, WDMcB = 19.5% (w/w) whole-cell bacterial lysates

141

(predominantly protein but up to ~15% phospholipids16). Diet composition is more extensively

142

described in Table S1. Detailed description of bacterial lysates is provided in the designated section

143

below. All diets were freshly made for each experiment with independent batches of bacterial

144

lysates to substantiate robustness and reproducibility of the observed findings. Mice were fed ad

145

libitum, and feed intake was measured thrice a week. Water was changed weekly.

146
147

12+6 protocol T22°C

148

Experimental setup is outlined in Figure 1A. C57BL/6JRj mice were purchased from Janvier Labs,

149

France, and housed 3 mice per cage, reproduced in two independent experiments. For transparency,

150

all data are depicted in respective graphs with mean ± SEM plus individual dots for the combined

151

results of the two independent experiments. Experiment-dependent shapes enables visual

152

discrimination of respective experiments as well as data distribution within and between

153

experiments.

154
155

21+5 protocol T30°C

156

Experimental setup is outlined in Figure 4A. C57BL/6JBomTac mice were purchased from Taconic

157

Laboratories, Denmark, and initially housed 10 per cage to accelerate weight gain. 12 weeks into

158

the run-in period, mice were single caged to allow accurate assessment of food intake, and also

159

monitor if the more sensitive microbiome of single-housed mice would uniformly change towards a

160

composition typical for LFD-fed mice, or if such phenomenon relied on a few highly responding

161

mice transferring their microbiome to cage mates under group housed conditions. The timing of

162

single housing allowed affected mice to adapt to social isolation and stabilize their weight

163

development before intervention (Figure S4B).

Cultivation of M. capsulatus Bath and preparation of bacterial lysate.

166

Methylococcus capsulatus Bath (NCIMB 11132) was cultivated in nitrate mineral salts (NMS)

167

medium as previously described17 to produce the single-strain bacterial lysate. McB culture aliquots

168

were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Cultivations on agar plates and in shake flasks

169

(orbital shaker incubator at 200 rpm) were performed at 45°C in an atmosphere of 75% air, 23.25%

170

CH4, and 1.25% CO2. Continuous cultivation was carried out in a 3-liter bioreactor (Applikon, The

171

Netherlands) with a working volume of 2 liters. Cells were pre-cultivated in shake flasks and used

172

to inoculate the bioreactor to an optical density at 440 nm (OD440) of 0.1. The temperature was

173

maintained at 45°C, stirring set to 650 rpm, and pH maintained at 6.8 by automatic addition of 2.5

174

M NaOH/2.5 M HCl. A gas mixture of 75% air and 25% methane was sparged into the bioreactor.

175

The continuous culture was started after an initial batch phase, and the dilution rate was set to 0.01

176

h−1. The OD440 at steady state was generally sustained at approximately 10. Culture effluent was

177

collected, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Bacterial cell walls were disrupted by the use

178

of a French press before freeze-drying of the material.

179
180

Glucose and insulin tolerance tests

181

Mice were subjected to magnetic resonance (MR)-scan using EchoMRI 4in1 (Texas, USA) to

182

determine fat- and lean mass at indicated time points (Figure 1A, 4A). Mice were fasted 5 or 2

183

hours prior to any oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) or intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ITT),

184

respectively. Fasting blood glucose was measured by tail vein bleeding using the Bayer Contour

185

glucometer (Bayer Health Care). Mice were subsequently gavaged with 3 µg glucose/g lean mass

186

(OGTT) or intraperitoneally injected with 0.75 mU insulin/g lean mass (ITT). Blood were sampled

187

at specified time points for blood glucose and insulin measurements to assess glucoregulatory

188

capacity including glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as described in detail elsewhere18.

189
190

Short chain fatty acid measurements

191

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by gas chromatographic analysis. Feces were

192

suspended in MilliQ water (1:1 (w/v)) and subsequently homogenized in a FastPrep-96 (MP

193

Biomedicals) sample preparation unit. The homogenates were diluted with 0.4% formic acid (1:1

194

(v/v)), transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. 300 µl of the

195

supernatants were applied to spin columns (VWR, 0.2 µm pore size) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm

196

for 5 minutes. The eluates were transferred to 300 µl GC vials. Split injection mode was used with

197

an injection volume of 0.2 µl. The gas chromatograph was a Trace 1310 (Thermo Scientific)

198

equipped with an autosampler and a flame ionization detector. Helium was used as carrier gas, and

199

the column was a 30 m long Stabilwax (Restek) with polyethylene glycol as stationary phase.

201

150 ˚C , then a 2 minutes increase to 245 ˚C and a hold at this temperature for 4.9 minutes. Detector

202

temperature: 275 ˚C.

203
204

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR

205

Frozen liver tissue was cryo-grinded by mortar and pestle on liquid nitrogen and total RNA was

206

extracted by TRIreagent (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol using

207

PRECELLYS® 24 for homogenization. One µg of RNA was transcribed into cDNA by reverse

208

transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA). Quantitative PCR analyzes were performed using the SYBR Green

209

qPCR Master mix (Thermo Scientific, USA) and the Stratagene Mx3000P qPCR System. Standard

210

curve and no template control (NTC) were included on every 96-well plates. Validation of each

211

target was based on Rsq of standard curve >0.995, amplification efficiency of 100±10% and

212

singular peak. Ct values for each target were related to 18S reference Ct values of the same sample

213

by 2ΔCt and visualized as fold-change to the LFD reference group mean. Primer sequences are

214

summarized in Table S2.

215
216

Histology

217

Liver tissue was sampled promptly after euthanasia, fixed in 10% formalin and subsequently

218

embedded in paraffin prior to sectioning according to standard procedures for light microscopy.

219

Colon was emptied for content and subsequently rolled around a 27G needle after which the

220

generated Swizz Rolls were carefully preserved in liquid nitrogen (wrapped in aluminum foil) until

221

paraffin embedding. Embedded tissues were cut 2 µm thick, and sections mounted onto glass slides.

222

These sections were processed further and stained either with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Oil

223

Red O, PAS, or HID-AB, or labelled with antibody of interest for immunohistochemical

224

investigations, as detailed below. Samples were randomized and blinded to the pathologists

225

performing the histological analyses.

226
227

Liver

228

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS)

229

Liver sections were prepared by standard protocols and subsequently assessed by two independent

230

observers in a blinded fashion, using the established NAFLD activity score (NAS) for evaluation of

231

H&E stained liver sections19. In short, score of 0 to 2 excludes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

232

(NASH), a score of 3–4 defines “borderline NASH”, and score ≥ 5 is considered as NASH.

233
234

Oil Red O staining

235

Liver biopsies were fixed in paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in polyvinylpyrrolidone/saccharose,

236

and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections were prepared and stained using the lipid-specific Oil

237

red O (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) and analyzed under an Axio Imager M2 microscope. Images were

238

captured with the Axiocam 506 color camera (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Areas of stained lipids were

239

determined using ImageJ-1.50i software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html).

240
241

Colon

242

The morphological and morphometrical evaluations of the colonic tissues were performed in a

243

blinded fashion, and all measurements were made by the same trained pathologist. One H&E

244

stained section of colon from each individual was evaluated histologically for any sign of

245

pathology. To assess the quality of the mucins, colonic tissues were stained for acidic as well as

246

neutral mucins. Neutral mucins were stained by Periodic Acid Schiffs (PAS). Acidic mucins were

247

stained through a combination of High Iron Diamine (HID), for sulfated mucins (sulfomucins), and

248

Alcian Blue (AB) for carboxylated mucins (sialomucins). Crypt depth (CD) measurements, as well

249

as analyses of mucin type and amount, were performed on HID/AB- and PAS-stained sections in

250

three histologically distinct areas of the colon, i.e. the proximal, middle and distal area. At each of

251

these three locations, three longitudinally sectioned crypts were measured. Each data point is thus

252

presented as an average of three (mucin type and amount) or six (CD) measures. Crypts were

253

selected only when the entire crypt epithelium was visible from the lamina muscularis mucosae to

254

the lumen. The histological sections of the colon were examined in an Axio Imager Z2 microscope

255

(Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and digital images were obtained using an Axiocam 506 color camera

256

(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Micrographs were captured with the same 20× objective magnification.

257

Crypt depth measurements were performed using the software program Image J-Fiji version 1.52e

258

Java 1.8.0_18120. For quantitative evaluation and automated scoring of the different mucin types, a

259

plugin for color deconvolution for the Image J-Fiji program was used21.

260
261

Hepatic lipidomics

262

Samples were randomized and lipid extracted as previously described. In short, 50 mg of frozen

263

tissue were homogenized in a pre-chilled 2 mL tube added 0.5 mL of ice-cold 50% MeOH with ~40

264

µM D5-tryptophan following standard protocols and stored at -80°C until LCMS analysis. The

265

peaklist obtained after preprocessing (features defined by their mass/charge value, retention time

266

and peak area) was analyzed in MetaboAnalyst 4. Data were then auto-scaled (mean-centering and

267

division by the square root of standard deviation of each variable) to enforce Gaussian distribution

268

enabling relative comparison. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed with t-tests,

269

volcano plot, analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s HSD test, and principal

270

component analysis (PCA) to detect significant hits and to visually separate trends between groups.

271

Features showing a similar pattern between LFD and WDMcB were identified by pattern matching

272

function. The top 25 features obtained were then processed for identification using the online

273

database Lipidmaps (http://lipidmaps.org) with a mass tolerance between the measured m/z value

274

and the exact mass of 3 ppm.

275
276

Microbiome analysis and bioinformatic processing

277

Fresh feces samples were collected 3-4 hours into the light cycle, snap frozen and stored at -80°C

278

until downstream processing. Bacterial DNA from fecal samples was extracted using a NucleoSpin

279

soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer's instructions. 16S rRNA gene amplification,

280

library preparation and sequencing were performed as previously described22. Initial data

281

processing was performed as described elsewhere23. Data was rarefied to 23,107 reads per sample.

282

The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was conducted based on the weighted UniFrac distance.

283

To select OTUs and species enriched in different subgroups, DESeq224 with default settings was

284

used. The relative abundances of OTUs were aggregated to genus level. Genera present in >1/3 of

285

the samples were used in the differential abundance testing. Genera with p.adj. < 0.05 comparing

286

the last sampling point for WDREF/WDCNTL vs WDMcB with DESeq2 differential expression analysis

287

based on the negative binomial distribution were reported. Permutational multivariate analysis of

288

variance (permanova) using weighted UniFrac distance matrices (Adonis, Vegan R package) was

289

used to evaluate overall microbial compositions.

290
291

Isolation of small intestine (SI) and large intestine (LI) lamina propria (LP) cells

292

Feces and mucus from LI were scraped off while SI was flushed with 1x HBSS (Gibco) containing

293

15 mM HEPES (Thermo Scientific). Peyer´s patches were carefully excised from SI. SI and LI

294

were opened longitudinally, cut into approx. 1 cm pieces and washed 3 times with 1x HBSS

295

(Gibco) containing 15 mM HEPES (Thermo Scientific), 5% FCS (ViralexTM, PAA Laboratories),

296

298

additionally added to LI samples. LI, but not SI samples, were shaken on an orbital shaker at 350

Results:

354

McB feeding reverses WD-induced gut microbiota changes and increases cecal SCFA levels

355

To induce obesity and immunometabolic dysfunctions, C57BL/6JRj mice were initially fed an

356

obesogenic WD. After 12 weeks of WD feeding, the mice were stratified into new groups based on

357

weight, fat mass and glucoregulatory capacity (Figure 1A), and fed experimental WDs for an

358

additional 6 weeks. While dietary fat is known to elicit reproducible and lipid-dependent alterations

359

in the murine gut microbiome across a variety of different diet compositions26, less is known about

360

the microbiome-modulating impact of protein. Thus, to investigate if dietary protein (i.e. casein

361

versus whole-cell bacterial lysates) would affect gut microbiota community structures, we analyzed

362

freshly collected fecal samples before and throughout the dietary intervention. LFD and WDREF fed

363

mice showed distinct gut microbiota profiles after 12 weeks of feeding (intervention baseline, week

364

12+0; Figure 1B,C), including ~10-fold lower abundance of the health-promoting genera,

365

Parasutterella27 and Parabacteroides28, countered by an equally increased abundance of the obesity

366

associated genus Desulfivobrio30,31 (Figure 1D) as well as a ~4-fold increase in the Firmicutes to

367

Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio (Figure 1E). Interestingly, WDCNTL fed mice showed negligible changes in

368

the microbiome signature during the 6 weeks of intervention (Figure 1B-F & S1A-B), suggesting

369

that the added lipid source had limited influence on the intestinal ecology. In contrast to this

370

observation, we noted a pronounced shift in bacterial composition in mice fed WDMcB. Within the

371

first 2 weeks of treatment, the general community structure in these mice shifted towards that of

372

their LFD-fed counterparts (Figure 1B-F, Table S3). We next asked if the observed taxonomical

373

differences between groups related to alterations in the functional potential. SCFAs are main end

374

products of metabolized fibers, and to a lesser extent amino acids escaping digestion in the SI, with

375

vast impact on host physiology32,33. The highest levels of SCFAs are found in the cecum and

376

proximal colon34. We therefore investigated if cecal SCFA levels were different between groups.

377

We found a consistent increase in the levels of the three major as well as three minor classes of

378

SCFAs in the cecum of WDMcB fed mice compared to WDCNTL fed counterparts pointing towards

379

not just taxonomically, but also functionally, discrete microbiota profiles in the two groups of mice,

380

supporting a beneficial health impact on dietary inclusion of McB lysates (Figure 1G-H).

382

WDMcB feeding stimulates induction of gut-specific regulatory T cells

383

The intricate relationship between gut microbes and host immunity, combined with the

384

immunoregulatory capacity of SCFAs35, prompted us to investigate if the observed changes

385

mediated by WDMcB feeding were associated with immune alterations.

386

We accordingly analysed the immune cell profile of SI-LP and LI-LP in a subset of experimental

387

mice (n = 6-10/group) using multicolour flow cytometry focusing on phenotypic characterization of

388

group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), natural killer (NK) cells and T cells (consult Figure S2A-B

389

for gating strategies). Numbers of ILC3s, NK cells and T cell receptor (TCR)-gd+ T cells, were

390

similar between groups (Figure S2C-E). The same was true for the numbers of TCRb+ CD4+ T

391

cells, as well as the proportion of T helper (TH)1-, TH17- and nTregs cells (Figure 2A-B).

392

Interestingly, the proportion of pTregs was more than 2-fold increased in LI-LP of WDMcB fed mice

393

compared to WDCNTL fed counterparts (Figure 2C, p < 0.001). Notably, this regulatory T cell subset

394

has been shown to curb intestinal inflammation12 and mediate immunological tolerance to the gut

395

pathobiont Helicobactor hepaticus, thereby protecting against TH17-mediated barrier dysfunction

396

and subsequent colitis36. Because RORγt is the hallmark transcription factor for TH17 cell

397

differentiation and essential for their IL-17 production, we next assessed if the pTregs induced by the

398

different diets were also capable of expressing IL-17. Indeed, ex vivo stimulated LI-LP pTregs

399

produced substantial and diet-dependent amounts of IL-17 protein (Figure 2D-G, p < 0.001). A

400

similar phenotype was observed in the SI-LP (Figure 2H-N), where pTregs in WDMcB fed mice

401

reached a ~3-fold increase compared to WDCNTL fed mice (Figure 2J, p < 0.001).

402
403

WDMcB mitigates diet-induced obesity

404

The altered immune profile combined with a shift of the gut microbiota towards a state similar to

405

that observed in lean LFD-fed mice, could potentially elicit crosstalk to glucoregulatory organs. To

406

examine if McB lysates could reverse impaired glucose regulation, we performed OGTTs and

407

assessed GSISs concomitant with body mass composition in obese mice fed WDREF for 11 weeks

408

and after 5 weeks of dietary intervention allowing for temporal analyses (Figure 1A). All mice were

409

stratified into experimental groups based on their pre-intervention glucoregulatory capacity (Figure

410

S3A-B). While the response to glucose challenge remained largely unaffected from week 11 to

411

week 12+5, regardless of experimental diets (Figure 3A-C), both 5h fasted insulin levels and

412

glucose stimulated insulin responses were significantly increased in mice fed WDCNTL (Figure 3E, p

413

< 0.01 & p < 0.001, respectively) in accordance with our previous report on time-dependent

414

alterations in glucose regulation37. LFD- and WDMcB-fed mice were fully protected against this

415

detrimental trajectory (Figure 3D, F & S3C, p = 0.24 & 0.68, respectively ), and WDMcB-fed mice

416

further exhibited modestly improved insulin sensitivity based on 5h fasted glycemia (Figure 3C, p <

417

0.05) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (Figure 3G, p < 0.05).

418

Overall, weight development mimicked the glucoregulatory capacity. As such, WDMcB-fed mice

419

exhibited stability of weight, fat mass and lean mass when changed to experimental diets,

420

contrasting the continuous weight and fat mass development of WDCNTL fed mice (Figure 3H-I &

421

S3D). The absence of weight gain was not explained by decreased feed intake (Figure 3J), but

422

rather appeared to be associated with enhanced fecal energy secretion (Figure 3J-K).

423

Since obesity and impaired glucose regulation are tightly associated with NAFLD38, we next

424

subjected paraffin-embedded liver sections to histological evaluation. These analyses revealed both

425

diminished steatosis and hepatocellular ballooning in WDMcB fed mice compared to WDCNTL-fed

426

counterparts, where especially hepatocellular ballooning was arrested in (or returned to) a state

427

reminiscent that of lean LFD fed mice (Figure 3L-M, p < 0.05). Importantly, hepatocellular

428

ballooning is instrumental in the development of the more severe liver disease, NASH38.

429
430

WDMcB feeding resets the hepatic lipidome and decreases hepatic immune infiltration

431

alleviating NAFLD

432

Based on the decreased NAFLD in WDMcB-fed mice housed at T22°C we designed a new experiment

433

(study outline, Figure 4A) using a recently described39 method where thermoneutral housing (T30°C)

434

potentiates NAFLD in WT C57BL/6J mice fed an obesogenic diet for 20-24 weeks. To more

435

thoroughly investigate the effect of WDMcB-feeding, we also redesigned the diets and omitted

436

macadamia oil in the WDCNTL group, as this might lead to progression of obesity (Figure 3) and

437

related disorders. This new diet design entailed an increased fat/protein ratio in WDMcB compared to

438

WDREF, due to phospholipids inherently present in bacterial lysates16 (Table S1). Despite the lower

439

protein content in WDMcB compared to both other diets, protein availability was well beyond critical

440

levels, corroborated by similar lean mass to WDREF-fed mice post diet intervention (Figure S4A).

441

Still, WDMcB-fed mice exhibited significantly improved 5h fasting insulin levels and decreased fat

442

mass (Figure 4B-C), despite weight maintenance and significantly increased energy intake

443

compared to both LFD and WDREF fed mice (Figure S4B-D). The decreased body fat mass was

444

accompanied by a diminished NAS, supported by both pathological evaluation of H&E stained liver

445

sections (Figure 4D-E) and hepatocytic lipid content assessed by Oil-Red-O staining (Figure 4F-H).

446

We additionally observed augmented adiponectin secretion (Figure 4I), pointing towards improved

15

447

insulin sensitivity in the WDMcB group, further supported by the assessment of insulin tolerance and

448

hepatic gene transcription activity of key metabolic enzymes (Figure 4J-K). Of interest, we

449

observed a >10-fold downregulation of Scd1 in the liver of WDMcB-fed mice, the hepatic expression

450

of which is a) regulated by the microbiota40 and b) instrumental in de novo lipogenesis at the onset

451

of metabolic syndrome41.

452

We next assessed the hepatic lipidome by mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to elucidate if diminished

453

NAFLD was associated with an altered lipid profile. Through comparison of WDMcB and WDREF we

454

identified 57 and 279 differentially regulated peaks in negative and positive ionization mode,

455

respectively (Figure 5A-B, S5A-B, all FDR < 0.05). Of these, most classified lipids were changed

456

with WDMcB in the direction of LFD fed mice (Figure 5C-D). Notably, 57% of upregulated species

457

were odd-chain fatty acids, whereas 80% of down-regulated species represented lipids with even

458

carbon numbers (Figure 5C-D & Table S4), hence supporting previous reports where odd- rather

459

than even-chain fatty acids are inversely associated with human insulin resistance9 and type 2

460

diabetes42.

461

To estimate the functional consequences of an altered lipid profile, we used the Lipidmaps database

462

to identify affected pathways and plotted the observed changes on a log2 scale comparing both LFD

463

and WDMcB to WDREF. The majority of affected pathways were similarly regulated in both direction

464

and magnitude in LFD and WDMcB mice compared to WDREF mice (Figure 5E & S5C). Of note,

465

bile acids and ceramides, both of which were significantly downregulated in WDMcB fed mice

466

compared to WDREF fed counterparts, have been shown to mediate steatohepatitis by upregulation

467

of IL-6 and TNF-α, respectively43,44. We therefore measured these hepatic cytokines and observed

468

similarly reduced levels in both LFD and WDMcB compared to WDREF (Figure 5F).

469

A key feature of diet-induced liver pathologies, including NAFLD, is recruitment of newly

470

activated immune cells capable of eliciting a proinflammatory immune response. This process is

471

generally hampered in mice housed at mild thermal stress, which therefore fail to phenocopy human

472

pathophysiology. However, thermoneutral housing recapitulates some human disease traits45, which

473

combined with HFD-feeding accentuates intrahepatic infiltration of proinflammatory Ly6high

474

monocytes46. These monocytes interact with tissue resident T cells and play a central role in the

475

pathogenesis of liver injury, hence representing an attractive therapeutic target to mitigate NAFLD

476

development and to curtail associated pathologies44.

477

We therefore subjected liver tissues from representative mice to immunological evaluation by

478

immunohistochemistry and observed a marked decrease in both CD3+ T cells and Ly6high

16

479

monocytes in WDMcB-fed mice compared to their WDREF-fed counterparts (Figure 5G). Diminished

480

hepatic immune infiltration was mirrored by increased levels of circulating IL-22, IL-18, and IL-17

481

in WDMcB-fed mice compared to their WDREF-fed counterparts (Figure 5H, p < 0.01, < 0.05 & <

482

0.05, respectively).

483
484

WDMcB feeding reverses prolonged gut microbial dysbiosis and markedly improves colonic

485

mucus production

486

The improved hepatic phenotype prompted us to further investigate potential traits in the gut-liver

487

axis. We initially assessed if the observed cytokine responses associated with improved gut health

488

in mice housed at T30°C, where inflammation is expected to be increased45. Indeed, WDMcB-fed mice

489

were resistant to WD-induced colonic shortening closely associated with colonic inflammation

490

(Figure 6A).

491

To gain additional insights to the immunomodulating properties of McB lysates, we focused on

492

mucus production and -function. Because mucin production is a constitutive process where both

493

secretion and adherence are constantly ongoing and rapidly adjust to environmental changes,

494

immunohistochemical labelling for various MUC epitopes may not fully recapitulate the physical

495

properties of the mucus. We therefore applied specialized mucin histochemistry staining allowing

496

us to differentiate between neutral and acidic mucins according to the net charge of each molecule.

497

Acidic mucins were further separated into sulfomucins and sialomucins. Sections revealed that

498

neutral mucins in crypt-residing goblet cells were consistently down regulated in WDREF-fed mice

499

compared to LFD-fed counterparts in three well defined segments of the colon; i.e. proximal,

500

middle and distal area (Figure 6B, D). WDMcB-feeding not only reversed this pattern in all three

501

segments but even enhanced the production of neutral mucins exceeding the levels found in LFD-

502

fed counterparts. This is a remarkable finding considering the continuous intake of a westernized

503

diet high in fat and sucrose, known to hamper goblet cell function. We next evaluated crypt depth

504

(CD) in stained sections. While the CD of the proximal and distal part of the colon were largely

505

unaffected by diet, we observed increased CD in the middle segment of WDMcB-fed mice (Figure

506

6C). WDMcB-feeding further enhanced the glycosylation pattern, particularly in the middle segment

507

of colon, where this group exhibited a 3-fold increase in sulfomucins balanced by a similar (~2-

508

fold) decrease in sialomucins compared to WDREF-fed mice (Figure 6E-G). No differences were

509

observed between WDREF and LFD-fed mice, indicating that the reciprocal regulation of mucin

510

glycosylation status was specific to WDMcB-feeding.

511

With focus on the dynamic interactions between gut immunity, mucin glycosylation and commensal

512

microbes47, we next assessed the gut microbiota composition in temporally separated samples. This

513

was done to determine if the changes towards a gut microbiota resembling that of lean LFD-fed

514

mice was recapitulated in this intensified setup. In contrast to the first set of experiments, where we

515

used cohoused mice shown to exhibit resilient microbiota profiles, we now employed single-housed

516

mice to explore if the WDMcB-mediated community structures were persistent enough to induce

517

consistent changes in the more dynamic communities of single-housed mice. Similar to our first

518

experiments at T22°C, we observed a normalization of the gut microbiome of WDMcB-fed mice,

519

despite prolonged WD-feeding prior to intervention (Figure 6H-K). WDMcB-induced changes were

520

surprisingly consistent with the first set of experiments, including a significantly lower F/B ratio

521

(Figure 6J and S5D), and a substantial reduction of Desulfovibrio abundance, countered by a similar

522

bloom of the Parasutterella and Parabacteroides genera (Figure 6K, Table S5). Of note, the age-

523

related increases in Desulfovibrio abundances recently reported30 was confirmed in this study where

524

the general magnitude in both WDREF- and LFD-fed mice increased 2-3-fold over the 5 week

525

intervention (Figure 6K). WDMcB-feeding fully prevented this trajectory and paired analyses even

526

revealed a diminished relative abundance of Desulfovibrio in these mice.

Discussion:

530

In this report, we explored the relationship between dietary nutrients and host-microbe interactions

531

with a focus on immunometabolic response rates in the context of high fat, high sucrose, WD-

532

feeding. We found whole-cell lysates from the non-commensal methanotrophic bacterium, McB,

533

capable of reversing hallmark signatures of WD-feeding despite continued intake of an obesogenic

534

diet. The signatures included dimished fat mass, improved intestinal immunity and glucoregulatory

535

capacity accompanied by gut microbial community structures resembling that of lean LFD-fed

536

counterparts.

537
538

The aberrant microbiota composition associated with obesity was recently shown to reflect HFD

539

intake rather than obesity per se48. It is therefore worth noting that we were able to normalize the

540

dysregulated gut microbiome in mice remaining on a westernized, high fat, high sucrose diet;

541

especially considering that it remains a clinical challenge to change fatty dietary habits in lifestyle-

542

related obese subjects. This remarkable change was reproduced in two diverse sub-strains of mice

543

originating from different vendors, corroborating a robust phenotype not notably affected by

544

baseline microbiota composition. To this end, a previous report on the resilient microbiome, argued

545

for prolonged normalization49. This study found that mice transferred to a low fat, fiber-rich chow

546

diet after 12 weeks of HFD feeding, shifted their microbiota towards age-matched chow-fed control

547

mice within 4 weeks, but only fully converged 10 weeks post diet change. This is particularly

548

interesting as dietary fibers are known to be the most potent dietary regulator of the gut

549

microbiota50, by far exceeding that of dietary fat51. Still, in our hands, WDMcB-feeding was able to

550

reverse the obese microbiome at a higher pace than chow diet was in the previous report49, despite

551

similar fiber content in the two WDs. We further showed that the reversal of the microbiota traits

552

were reproducible at different temperatures, altered reference diets, changed experimental duration,

553

and in both co-housed and single-housed mice; all of which are prominent modulators of gut

554

microbiota community structures. While many genera were similarly affected between experiments,

555

others were either exclusively regulated at T30°C (e.g., Bifidobacterium) or less pronounced affected

556

at T30°C (e.g., Barnesiella), suggesting dispensability for these specific microbes in the metabolic

557

disease traits observed in this model. Similar observations were made for Akkermansia, which was

558

~3-fold upregulated at T30°C, but discordantly affected (log2 FC bouncing from +9.3 to -10.4)

559

between the two replication studies at T22°C with pronounced intragroup variation.

560

Contrasting these discrepancies, there was a consistent downregulation of Desulfovibrio

561

accompanied by >10-fold upregulation of Parabacteroides and Parasutterella suggesting that

562

WDMcB feeding nourishes a favorable microbiota, albeit such speculations have yet to be

563

mechanistically described. Still, Desulfovibrio was most recently shown to flourish in aged,

564

immunocompromised, obese mice with impaired glucose regulation30. Both T cell loss and

565

Desulfovibrio administration per se, precipitated obesity-induced insulin resistance30. This

566

bacterium has moreover been shown to thrive in desulfonated colonic mucosa, associated with

567

human52 and mouse53 colitis. Combined, these observations lend credence to the hypothesis of a

568

mechanistic link between WDMcB-mediated reductions of Desulfovibrio and the observed

569

improvements in mucin chemotype and metabolic response rates.

570
571

Future studies are warranted to elucidate if the gut microbiota changes observed in WDMcB-fed mice

572

were a result of the unique nutrient source, or if it was facilitated by WDMcB-induced pTregs. On this

573

note, mucin-producing goblet cells are capable of delivering luminal antigens to LP-residing

574

dendritic cells (DC)54 instrumental for T cell polarization55. As McB potently induce DC maturation

575

markers in vitro – even exceeding the effects of the well-described probiotic strain, Escherichia coli

576

Nissle 191756 – we predict a direct link between McB intake and the corresponding immune profile.

577

In addition to the direct link proposed here, McB intake might also indirectly promote Treg

578

polarization through augmented SCFAs57. These important metabolites also sustain mucus

579

production and facilitate tissue crosstalk in the gut-liver axis2. In keeping with this notion, we

580

observed decreased hepatic bile acids and TNF-α levels combined with a pronounced reduction of

581

intrahepatic CD3+ and Ly-6Chigh cells. Importantly, while Ly-6Chigh cells represent

582

proinflammatory, fibrogenic macrophages58, their in situ differentiation to Ly-6Clow cells59 facilitate

583

tissue repair and improved NASH prognosis60. Mentioned targets are all proposed as relevant

584

strategies to curb NAFLD and the more terminal liver disease, NASH44.

585
586

The substantial, consistent, and global changes in the immunometabolic profile found in this study

587

point towards clinical potential if further developed. Notably, only a single study has previously

588

succeeded in inducing pTregs, and this was limited to LI-LP11. Apart from inducing this cell subset

589

throughout the gastrointestinal tract, we further show that these cells exhibited enhanced secretory

590

capacity of IL-17 in WDMcB-fed mice compared to their WDCNTL fed counterparts. To this end,

591

emerging evidence indicates that the non-regulatory counterparts to pTregs, i.e. TH17 cells, are

592

purged from SI-LP in DIO mice14 and that reintroducing ex vivo differentiated gut tropic TH17 cells

593

curtail obesity development, hence improving insulin sensitivity15.

594

That IL-17 in this intervention is produced by Tregs and not TH17 cells might further improve the

595

safety profile of a putative medication, as the physiological impact and properties of TH17 cells are

596

context-dependent. As such, TH17 cells may potentiate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in

597

individuals with compromised barrier function61, whereas pTregs have shown enhanced suppressive

598

capacity against the same disease12. This is a pertinent feature given the relatively high proportion

599

of subjects with metabolic complications co-suffering from IBD62. While our study was not

600

designed to assess IBD susceptibility, it is well described that purified diets compromise barrier

601

function50,63,64 and thus represent clinical IBD-features (disease-cause) preceding inflammation

602

(symptom)65. It is therefore worth noting that in addition to the immunomodulating phenotype,

603

WDMcB-feeding augmented neutral mucus production in all segments of the colon while enhancing

604

IBD-protective sulfomucins specifically in the middle segment. In this segment, we also detected

605

increased CD in McB fed mice, collectively pointing towards increased barrier function.

606
607

In summary, this study demonstrates a consistent activation of Foxp3+RORγt+IL-17+ triple positive

608

pTregs

609

feeding, even in the context of high dietary fat and sucrose intake. The prospects of using bacterial

610

lysates as an alternative to traditional live probiotics merit further investigation, just as future

611

studies are warranted to assess to what extent our results can be translated to humans. Future studies

612

are also urgently needed to identify the biological effector molecule(s) comprised in this bacterial

613

lysate, allowing for subsequent development of a versatile medical product(s) rebalancing intestinal

614

immunity while targeting gut-related dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities.
