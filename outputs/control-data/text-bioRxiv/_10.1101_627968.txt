Abstract

8

Chikungunya and Zika viruses are arthropod-borne viruses that pose significant threat to public health.

9

Experimental data show that during in vitro infection both viruses exhibit qualitatively distinct repli-

10

cation cycle kinetics. Chikungunya viral load rapidly accumulates within the first several hours post

11

infection whereas Zika virus begins to increase at much later times. We sought to characterize these

12

qualitatively distinct in vitro kinetics of chikungunya and Zika viruses by fitting a family of mathe-

13

matical models to time course viral load datasets. We demonstrate that the standard viral kinetic

14

model, which considers that new infections result only from free virus penetrating susceptible cells,

15

does not fit experimental data as well as a model in which the number of virus-infected cells is the

16

primary determinant of infection rate. We provide biologically meaningful quantifications of the main

17

viral kinetic parameters and show that our results support cell-to-cell or localized transmission as a

18

significant contributor to viral infection with chikungunya and Zika viruses.

Importance

21

Mathematical modeling has become a useful tool to tease out information about virus-host interactions

22

and thus complements experimental work in characterizing and quantifying processes within viral

23

replication cycle. Importantly, mathematical models can fill in incomplete data sets and identify key

24

parameters of infection, provided the appropriate model is used. The in vitro time course dynamics of

25

mosquito transmitted viruses, such as chikungunya and Zika, have not been studied by mathematical

26

modeling and thus limits our knowledge about quantitative description of the individual determinants

27

of viral replication cycle. This study employs dynamical modeling framework to show that the rate at

which cells become virus-infected is proportional to the number or virus-infected cells rather than free

extracellular virus in the milieu, a widely accepted assumption in models of viral infections. Using

30

the refined mathematical model in combination with viral load data, we provide quantification of

31

the main drivers of chikungunya and Zika in vitro kinetics. Together, our results bring quantitative

understanding of the basic components of chikungunya and Zika virus dynamics.

Introduction

34

Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arbovirus) primarily

35

transmitted through a bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and their continuous re-emergence pose an

36

important public health threat. CHIKV was originally isolated in 1953 during an epidemic outbreak

37

in Tanzania [1]. Outbreaks of CHIKV occurred in the western Indian Ocean in 2005-6 [2], India

38

and Italy in 2007 along with several Southeast Asian countries, Pacific regions and the Americas

39

[3]. Similarly, ZIKV was first discovered in 1947 in a Ugandan forest [4]. The first sporadic ZIKV

40

outbreaks outside Africa were reported in the Asia-Pacific region in 2007 [5] and 2013 [6], followed

41

by its rapid spread to the Western hemisphere in 2016 [7], which received public attention due to the

42

association of ZIKV infection with newborn microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities [8–11].

43

Currently, no approved vaccine or therapeutic treatments exist to specifically target CHIKV or ZIKV

44

infections. Disease prevention mostly relies on decreasing the number of transmission events through

45

vector control strategies, presenting a significant challenge to limit the incidence of future epidemics,

46

especially in developing countries.

47

Although CHIKV and ZIKV belong to distinct virus families (Togaviridae and Flaviviridae, re-

48

spectively), virus particles share common characteristics, such as their positive single-stranded RNA

49

genome and the presence of a lipid envelope derived from the host. Both viruses infect a wide spec-

50

trum of mosquito and mammalian cell lines, including Vero cells, mosquito cells Aag2 or C6/36, as

51

well as various human cell lines, including Huh7 [12, 13]. The classical kinetics following infection

52

of a non-lytic virus begins with an eclipse phase in which attachment, entry and the first round of

53

replication and assembly occurs. This period is followed by an exponential increase in viral particles

54

released to the extracellular milieu following virus egress. Finally, a plateau phase is reached when

55

the maximum capacity of virus production by the cells is reached. Following the plateau phase, the

56

number of infectious virus particles in the extracellular milieu generally begins to decline due to a loss

57

in stability and infectivity of the virions in the environment. Importantly, the time for each of these

58

phases of virus replication kinetics may vary between virus types, strains, and cell type, as the rate of

59

different processes occurring in an infected cell (such as penetration, uncoating, replication, budding)

60

may differ under different conditions.

61

Mathematical models of in vitro viral infections help elucidate the time scales of each of these

62

phases and characteristics affecting virus-infected cells, such as the length of eclipse phase, or the

63

mean lifespan of virus-releasing cells. Dynamical models provide accurate estimations of the rates that

64

dictate the accumulation of virus in the free space outside of cells, such as viral genome production

65

rates and loss of viral infectivity. The more precise quantification of such fundamental processes within

66

virus-host interactions can better replace generic, experiment-specific, qualitative descriptions of virus

67

replication (e.g., ‘attenuated growth’, ‘reduced fitness’ in vitro). These measures have been determined

68

for a number of viruses, including HIV-1 and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) [14–

69

19], hepatitis C virus [20–24], poliovirus [25–27], influenza A virus and its variants [28–32], West

70

Nile virus [33], and Ebola virus [34, 35]. The mathematical models proposed in these experimental

71

studies rely on the assumption that infection of susceptible cells occurs via free infectious virus. In

72

contrast, only a limited number of theoretical studies have considered infection of susceptible cells to

73

be proportional to the total number of virus-producing cells, which is commonly referred to as the

74

cell-to-cell transmission model. The latter type of modeling is important to consider, since cell-to-

75

cell viral transmission has been observed to be an additional contributor to the infection for many

76

enveloped viruses [36–38]. Indeed, some theoretical studies showed that cell-to-cell transmission of

77

virus contributed approximately equally to the in vitro growth of equine infectious anaemia virus [39]

78

and HIV-1 [40], explained multiplicity of (HIV-1)-infected splenocytes in humans [41], or permitted

79

spread of HIV-1 virus despite antiretroviral therapy [42, 43]. Interestingly, while no direct evidence of

80

cell-to-cell transmission of ZIKV exists to date, indirect evidence of cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV

81

was previously suggested to enable CHIKV resistance to antibody neutralization by bypassing the

82

extracellular space [44, 45].

83

Modeling cell-to-cell transmission most commonly refers to modeling direct biological transfer of

84

a virus. However, modeling cell-to-cell transmission may also be viewed as a proxy to model localized

85

infections caused by low amounts of free infectious virus. This may especially be enhanced in static

86

conditions, such as cell culture, where cell infections are more likely to occur in a localized manner as

87

viral particles produced by an infected cell penetrate susceptible cells within their immediate neigh-

88

borhood. In addition, such relatively low amounts of infectious virus responsible for new cell infections

89

would be difficult to distinguish within the total infectious viral load especially for rapidly growing

90

viruses, such as CHIKV. Consequently, modeling occurrence of cell infections via total infectious viral

91

load could result in misleading model parametrization. It is important to revise assumptions about

92

viral infection dynamics as they could profoundly affect conclusions drawn from modeling in vitro

93

virus dynamics under antiviral therapy, as the assays are often performed in adherent cell culture, as

94

well as from modeling in vivo virus spread in organs and tissues.

95

In this study, we use viral dynamics modeling to numerically characterize the main determinants

96

of ZIKV and CHIKV in vitro kinetics and to tease apart the effects of each determinant on the viral

97

load. To inform the mathematical model, we measured temporal changes in the infectious viral titres

98

and encapsulated genome abundances in a series of experiments reflective of different aspect of viral

99

replication cycle in the extracellular milieu. To minimize the influence of immune responses on the

100

CHIKV and ZIKV infection, we used a mammalian cell line (Vero) which is incapable of producing

101

type I interferon in response to viral infections [46, 47]. Infection of Vero cells was carried out using

102

two distinct amounts of input virus at multiplicity of infection (MOI, defined as the number of viral

103

genomes that enter and effectively replicate in a cell) of 0.01 (hereafter referred to as low MOI) and

104

1 (hereafter referred to as high MOI) of infectious virus per cell. Using mathematical modeling, we

105

compared CHIKV and ZIKV infection kinetics by allowing new infections to be facilitated via free

106

extracellular infectious virus (hereafter referred to as ‘standard’ model) or via virus-producing cells

107

(hereafter referred to as cell-to-cell transmission model). We show that because CHIKV-infected cells

108

exhibit a much shorter eclipse phase and rapid accumulation of virus during the initial growth phase

109

compared to rather long eclipse phase of ZIKV-infected cells and slow accumulation of virus over the

110

infection course, the standard model fails to describe temporal CHIKV viral load data. The cell-

111

to-cell transmission model, in which virus spread occurs via virus-producing cells, transpired to be

112

significantly more descriptive of both CHIKV and ZIKV viral load time course data. Overall, we

113

deliver the first comprehensive numerical characterization of in vitro CHIKV and ZIKV infections.

120

at time points 8h, 48h and 72h, RNA was extracted and quantified by qRT-PCR. By fitting equation

121

(1) to RNA genome abundances (see Material and Methods for description of the fitting procedure),

122

we determined that CHIKV RNA genome degradation over the course of 72h was negligible (Figure

123

1a) and for practical reasons was in the model (4) set to zero. ZIKV RNA genome degradation over

124

the course of 72h was crna = 0.01h−1 (a half-life of 69.3h) (Figure 1b). Infectivity of both ZIKV and

125

CHIKV were significantly reduced over time as determined by titration by plaque assay of infectious

126

virus remaining in the solution (Figure 1a, 1b). By fitting equation (2) to viral titres (see Mate-

127

rial and Methods for description of the fitting procedure), we determined the mean infectivity loss

128

rate of CHIKV and ZIKV over the infection course to be c = 0.048h−1 and c = 0.072h−1 , respec-

129

tively, (a half-life of 14.4h and 9.6h, respectively). In conclusion, ZIKV loses infectivity more rapidly

130

than CHIKV. Estimated viral decay kinetic parameters for both ZIKV and CHIKV with their 95%

131

confidence intervals are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1.

132

Model selection

133

For each virus, we used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC, Materials and Methods) to fit

134

equations (4) (see also Figure 2 for biological description of the equations) to low and high MOI exper-

135

imental datasets separately and simultaneously. For each virus and each MOI dataset, we quantified

136

viral parameters within the model (4) for both viral transmission modes. To determine which of the

137

two transmission models provides better description of the data, we performed model selection based

138

on the calculation of posterior odds ratio (Materials and Methods). We found strong evidence for

139

the cell-to-cell viral transmission model to describe CHIKV infection dynamics as the posterior odds

140

ratio was equal to one in favour of cell-to-cell viral transmission model. For ZIKV, we also found

141

evidence for the cell-to-cell viral transmission model to describe infection dynamics with posterior

142

odds ratio equal to 0.74 for the cell-to-cell viral transmission model compared to 0.26 for the standard

143

transmission model. Solutions of the cell-to-cell transmission model associated with parameter sets

144

inferred from ABC provided good fits to both CHIKV and ZIKV time course datasets (Figures 3a and

145

4a, respectively). In contrast, solutions of the standard model associated with parameter sets inferred

146

from ABC fit well ZIKV time course datasets (Figure 4b) and CHIKV time course datasets only when

147

low and high MOI datasets were fit separately (results not shown) but did not fit well CHIKV time

148

course datasets when low and high MOI datasets were fit simultaneously (Figure 3b).

149

Herein, we focus on the select model parameters, that is, eclipse phase τE , viral genome production

150

rate p and infectious virus to total RNA genomes ratio α. For the remaining model parameters, namely

151

the number of compartments of eclipse and infectious phases nE and nI , respectively, the mean lifespan

152

of infected cells τI and the infection rate β the ABC converged on posterior distributions that were

153

not significantly different from their uniform priors (results not shown). The mean, median and 95%

154

credible intervals for all viral parameters for both models, both viruses and input MOI are listed in

155

Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5.

156

Duration of eclipse phase τE of chikungunya- and Zika-infected cells is not exponential.

157

Inference process under standard model yielded posterior distributions of τE with substantially differ-

158

ent peaks and shapes for different initial experimental conditions (MOI) in the case of CHIKV infection

159

(Figure 5a, left column). We estimated the median to be 14.6h for low MOI CHIKV infection, 6.3h

160

for high MOI CHIKV infection and 9.3h if we fit the standard model to low and high MOI CHIKV

161

datasets simultaneously. It is unlikely that differences in multiplicity of infection would promote such

162

differences in posterior distributions of τE as the time for a virion to complete its replication cycle is

163

biologically rather predetermined. Inference process under cell-to-cell transmission model converged

164

to posterior distributions with consistent shapes and peaks for different initial experimental conditions

165

(MOI) for both CHIKV and ZIKV infections (Figures 5b, 5d, left column) yielding medians between

166

6-7.5h and 36.4-39.8h, respectively. Interestingly, for ZIKV infection time course datasets, inference

167

process under standard model yielded posterior distributions comparable to those under cell-to-cell

168

transmission model (Figure 5c, left column) with the median between 36-38.8h across different initial

169

viral input MOI. The mean, median and 95% credible intervals of the posterior distributions for the

170

eclipse phase duration τE for each virus, each transmission model and each initial MOI are listed in

171

Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5.

172

Viral genome production rate p and infectious virus to total RNA genomes ratio α are

173

substantially different for chikungunya and Zika viruses. Posterior distributions of the viral

174

genome production rate p exhibited substantial differences in the peaks and shapes when the standard

175

model was fit to low and high MOI CHIKV experimental datasets (Figures 5a, middle column). We

176

estimated the median to be 250, 2.6, and 70.6, viral genomes released out of a cell per hour. These

177

discrepancies disappeared when CHIKV dynamics was described by the cell-to-cell viral transmission

178

model (Figure 5b) yielding median between 1.9-2.4 viral genomes per hour across different initial

179

viral input MOI. Inference of ZIKV genome production rate under both standard and cell-to-cell

180

transmission models yielded a bounded posterior distribution of p of which median varied between

181

0.13-2.9×106 genomes released out of a cell per hour across different initial viral input MOI (Figures

183

but also significantly less infectious virus to total RNA genomes produced compared to CHIKV. For

184

CHIKV, median of posterior distribution of α varied between 3 to 5 infectious viruses per ten RNA

185

genomes produced whereas for ZIKV we obtained 5.9-7.4 infectious viruses per ten thousand RNA

186

genomes produced (Figure 5, right column in each panel). The mean, median and 95% credible

190

Viral parameters within cell-to-cell transmission model.

191

We used the least-square fitting procedure described in Materials and Methods (Extraction of virus

192

decay parameters) to precisely quantify the viral parameters by fitting the cell-to-cell transmission

193

model (4) to low and high MOI datasets simultaneously. Because the number of compartments of the

194

eclipse and infectious phases, nE and nI , respectively, could not be inferred, we set nE = nI = 40

195

(as e.g. used to estimate Influenza A in vitro kinetic parameters in [29]) and fit equations (4) to

196

low and high MOI CHIKV and ZIKV datasets. The estimated best-fit parameter values and 95%

197

bootstrap confidence intervals are listed in Table 6 and associated dynamics of CHIKV and ZIKV

198

infections are depicted in Figure 7. The infection rate βC was found to be βC = 4.2 × 10−3 and

199

3.5 × 10−4 (cells×h)−1 for CHIKV and ZIKV infections, respectively. The duration of eclipse phase

200

of CHIKV- and ZIKV-infected cells were found to be 6.4h and 29.4h, respectively. The mean lifespan

201

of CHIKV- and ZIKV-producing cells were found to be 44.8h and 31.4h, respectively. Although the

202

lifespan of virus-producing cells seems to be overestimated, especially in the case of CHIKV as it is

203

highly cytopathic and promotes rapid cell death, such high values may be the result of post-peak

204

virus clearance not having been captured in the data (Figures 7). As virus-producing cells undergo

205

infection-induced death, additional data points capturing viral decay would reflect the phase when

206

viral production becomes slower than viral clearance and possibly improve estimation of lifespan of

207

virus-producing cells. The viral genome production rate p and infectious virus to total RNA genomes

208

produced by a cell α were found to be significantly different for both viruses. While production rate

209

of CHIKV genomes was estimated to be 2.4 genomes per cell per hour with the proportion of 18

210

infectious viruses per one hundred genomes, ZIKV genomes were being produced at the rate 3.3 × 104

211

genomes per cell per hour with the proportion of 6.3 infectious viruses per ten thousand genomes

212

produced (Table 6).

213

Discussion

214

The present study investigated the in vitro dynamics of chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV)

215

viruses whose time course of viral load data showed significantly different replication cycle kinetics.

216

In particular, a longer replication cycle of ZIKV compared to that of CHIKV gave rise to qualitatively

217

distinct viral dynamics which we studied by mathematical modeling to tease apart and quantify

218

individual drivers within each virus-cell interactions. The dynamics of extracellular free virus was

219

found not to be descriptive of either CHIKV or ZIKV infection dynamics. Therefore, we hypothesized

220

that the rate at which cells were infected was not proportional to the total extracellular infectious

221

virus but rather the number of virus-producing cells.

222

In modeling the viral kinetics, we were able to evaluate which of the two transmission models, that

223

is the standard model in which viral transmission is facilitated by extracellular free virus or cell-to-

224

cell transmission model in which viral transmission is facilitated by virus-producing cells, can explain

225

empirical observations. Although the dynamics of virus-producing cells transpired to be significantly

226

227

more explanatory of viral kinetic data, we cannot establish the exact mechanisms responsible. The
P
cell-to-cell transmission term (−βC T
j Ij ) in the mathematical model (4) represents two physical

228

and generally distinct biological processes; first, utilization of existing cell-to-cell contacts by the virus

229

and second, exploitation of cell adhesion biology to deliberately establish contact between infected

230

and uninfected target cells. Biologically, much remains unknown about the possibility of ZIKV and

231

CHIKV spread via direct cell-to-cell interactions. To date, evidence for such spread for ZIKV does not

232

exist. On the other hand, cell-to-cell-transmission of CHIKV has been previously suggested to describe

233

the resistance of CHIKV mutants to antibody-dependent neutralization [36]. The authors suggested

234

that presumably cell-to-cell transmission occurs when virus budding occurs near a cell junction and

235

when the virus can recognize the viral receptors on the neighboring cell. It is important to note

236

that other ways of transmission, which may resemble cell-to-cell transmission in ‘protecting’ the virus

237

from the extracellular space exist, and have not been taken into account in the latter study. For

238

example, it is becoming increasingly evident that viruses hijack cellular machinery to be transmitted

239

through extracellular vesicles (such as exosomes) in order to escape antibody and immune responses

240

and mediating further infection [48–51]. Indeed, ZIKV transmission has been shown to be mediated

241

by exosomes in cortical neurons [52]. In a similar manner, CHIKV was shown to trigger apoptosis

242

and ‘hide’ in apoptotic blebs, which were then able to infect cells otherwise refractory to CHIKV

243

infection [49]. Although direct cell-to-cell viral transmission remains to be experimentally explored

244

and demonstrated for CHIKV and ZIKV, we showed that mathematical model in which virus spread

245

is proportional to virus-producing cells is able to explain experimental data more accurately. Despite

246

that the spatial component of virus infection dynamics is not taken into account by either of the two

247

models, a virus is most likely to infect neighboring cells following budding, especially in more static

248

environments such as cell culture without mixing, or possibly in tissue compartments in vivo. This

249

may explain why the cell-to-cell transmission model is favored in this study, as the extracellular free

250

virus model, which assumes that progeny virus is likely to infect any cell, irrespective of the distance

251

from the infected cell.

252

It is important to note that most empirical data used for modeling tend to be generated under a

253

single growth condition. We conscientiously chose to perform and analyze both low and high MOI

254

growth, individually and combined, to further test the validity of each model. Had only one growth

255

condition been selected, we would not have identified that the standard model failed. These results

256

argue for the inclusion of more diverse experimental sets in model selection and development. We

257

could argue that the extreme differences between the inferred posterior distributions of CHIKV viral

258

parameter values under free-virus transmission may have been the result of MOI-dependent cellular

259

response to the presence of the virus throughout the infection course. Another possible explanation

260

for the reported discrepancies is superinfection. However, CHIKV superinfection is not well supported

261

since it has recently been shown that prior CHIKV infection of BHK cells (which are also interferon-

262

incompetent) inhibits re-infection of already infected cells by a challenge CHIKV [53]. Modeling

263

CHIKV in vitro dynamics thus presents a challenge and requires further investigation.

264

Statistical model comparison provided more support for cell-to-cell over the standard viral trans-

265

mission model. Nevertheless, this does not imply that cell-to-cell transmission model is the correct

266

model to be used to model CHIKV in vitro dynamics. To possibly test the hypothesis that standard

267

transmission model is indeed descriptive of CHIKV kinetics, infectious and total RNA genomes would

268

have to be measured in a timely manner in-between time points 8h and 24h to capture two-phase in-

269

crease of virus, particularly at low MOI. Insufficient data may have not provided enough information

270

about the viral dynamics to the mathematical model. Genome quantification of intracellular virus

271

would provide evidence for differential accumulation of virus within cells during low and high MOI

272

infection. Another, although indirect, evidence to support the standard model would include timely

273

measures of cell death as their accumulation would reflect removal of short-lived virus producing cells

274

with a large viral burst size from the system. Interestingly, both standard and cell-to-cell transmission

275

models were able to describe ZIKV in vitro kinetics. Although there was stronger statistical preference

276

for the latter, inference process yielded comparable posterior distributions of viral parameter values

277

for both standard and cell-to-cell transmission models. Thus, we conclude that CHIKV as a model

278

virus with fast replication cycle may exhibit MOI-dependent phenotypes.

279

Overall, this study showed that the mathematical model in which the spread of an infection is

280

described by cell-to-cell viral transmission can more accurately describe the in vitro dynamics of

281

CHIKV and ZIKV infections than the standard model in which the spread of an infection is mediated

282

via free extracellular virus. By modeling viral load datasets reflective of the virus kinetics at low and

283

high MOI, we quantified the rates of different processes within the CHIKV- and ZIKV-cell interactions.

284

Although we could not directly identify and quantify specific mechanisms, differences in the time scales

285

of viral replication cycle may play an important role in identifying the model of better predictive power.

286

This could have a significant impact on the development of models for viral control as the predictive

287

ability of a chosen model to reflect and meaningfully interpret viral data under the influence of an

288

external intervention, such as antiviral treatment, would be skewed. Identifying descriptive models

289

and confronting them with diverse experimental datasets is essential to the development of therapies

290

that prevent or treat CHIKV, ZIKV, and other infections.

(DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S;

294

Thermo Fisher) in a humidified atmosphere at 37◦ C with 5% CO2. U4.4 cells (derived from Aedes

295

albopictus) were grown in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium with 10% FCS, supplemented with 1% P/S, 1%

296

non-essential amino acids (Sigma) and 1% tryptose phosphate (Sigma) at 28◦ C.

297

Viruses

298

described elsewhere [54]. After linearization with NotI restriction enzyme (Thermo Fisher), RNA

299

was generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) with SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Invitrogen)

300

and transfected into BHK with lipofectamin 2000 (invitrogen). The Zika virus (ZIKV) used for this

301

study is the prototype african MR-766 strain derived from an infectious clone described elsewhere

302

[55]. ZIKV was rescued by transfection of the infectious clone in semi-confluent HEK-293T cells using

303

TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio). For both viruses, virus stocks used in this study were

304

generated by infection of Vero cells for amplification, titred by plaque assay and frozen at -80◦ C prior

305

to use.

Vero, HEK-293T and BHK cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium

The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) stock was generated from a Caribbean infectious clone

306

Plaque assay Viral titration was performed on Vero cells plated 1 day prior to infection on 24 well

307

plates. Ten fold dilutions were performed in DMEM alone and transferred onto Vero cells for 1 hour

308

to allow infection before adding DMEM with 2% FCS, 1% P/S and 0.8% agarose. Plaque assays

309

were fixed with 4% formalin (Sigma) 3 days post infection (p.i.) (CHIKV) or 4 days p.i. (ZIKV) and

310

plaques were manually counted.

311

Growth curves

312

At day 0, virus was diluted in 300 or 200 µl PBS to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU

313

per cell (high MOI) or 0.01 PFU per cell (low MOI). After 1 hour, the viral solution was removed,

314

cells were washed three times with PBS and new media supplemented with 2% FCS was added. At

315

each time point 0h, 4h, 8h, 24h, 48h and 72h for CHIKV and 0h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h for

316

ZIKV infection 60 µl and 5 µl were separately aliquoted and frozen for further titration (as described

317

above) and RT qPCR. 65 µl of fresh media was added on top of cells to replace the taken volume.

318

Each growth curve was done in triplicates.

319

RT qPCR

320

vation. Quantitative RT-PCR was then performed with TaqMan RNA-to-Ct One-step RT-PCR kit

321

(Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: 20 minutes at 50 C, 10 minutes at 95

322

C, 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds, followed by 60 C for 1 minute). The primer and probe sets used

323

for each virus are shown in Table 7. RNA copy number was derived from a standard curve generated

324

using reactions containing 10-fold dilutions of known amounts of in vitro generated RNA transcripts

325

Each reaction contained a scale of diluted IVT to calculate RNA copy number. The CHIKV RT-PCR

326

amplifies a 152 nucleotide-region spanning the 5’ UTR and NSP1. The ZIKV primers bind to and

327

amplify a 77 nucleotide region in the 5’ end of the ZIKV genome (position 1192-1268).

328

Extraction of virus decay parameters To identify viral decay parameters, crna and c, we assumed

329

that the loss of RNA genomes and infectious virus proceeds in an exponential (or log-linear) manner

330

over time. Therefore, the loss of RNA genomes Vrna (t) and infectious virus Vpfu (t) can be expressed as

Cells were plated in 12 well plates at 80-90% confluence one day before infection.

As described in [56], cell supernatants were heated 5 minutes at 60◦ C for viral inacti-

331

where crna and cpfu (measured in h−1 ) are the decay rates of RNA genomes and virus infectivity,

332

respectively, as in equations (4), and ln Vrna (0) and ln Vpfu (0) are natural logarithms of the initial

333

states of RNA genomes and infectious virus at t = 0h.

334

To obtain estimates of viral decay parameters, we minimized the sum of squared errors (SSE)

335

between the measured data D(ti ) and the model solution V (ti ) at each measured time point ti and

336

for each measured replicate j given as

SSE(V, D) =

(V (ti ) − D(ti ))2

(3)

337

across parameter ranges using the Python function scipy.optimize.least squares for performing

338

bound-constrained optimization on variables. To provide 95% confidence intervals for each estimated

339

best-fit parameter, we fit equations (1) and (2) to 3000 bootstrap replicates of each data set, the

340

detailed description of which can be found in [59].

341

Mathematical model The cell-free, low and high MOI time course datasets were numerically sim-

342

ulated using a collection of ordinary differential equations, in which susceptible target cells (T ) become

343

infected by infectious virus ((Vpfu ), measured in plague forming units (PFU)) or virus-producing cells

344

(Ij=1...nI ) at the infection rate (βV ), (measured in (PFU × h)−1 ) or (βI ), (measured in (cell × h)−1 ),

345

respectively. The rate of cell infection by infectious virus depends on the concentration of free extra-

346

cellular infectious virus (Vpfu ), but not released total virus ((Vrna ), measured as total RNA genomes

347

(RNA)). Upon successful infection, target cells enter an eclipse phase (the time between virus entry

348

into the cell to the beginning of viral release out of the cell), separated into (nE ) stages. Eclipse

349

cells (Ei=1,...,nE ) remain in each stage i = 1, . . . , nE for an exponentially-distributed time of equal

350

average length (τE /nE ). Only eclipse cells in the last compartment (EnE ) are allowed to transition

351

into the infectious state and begin producing viral genomes. Infectious phase (the amount of time

352

between the beginning of viral release out of a cell until the cell undergoes cell death or is removed

353

from the state of being infectious by other mechanisms) is separated into (nI ) stages, and infectious

354

cells (Ij=1,...,nI ) spend an exponentially-distributed time of equal average length (τE /nE ) in each stage

355

before infectious cells in the last stage (nI ) are removed from the system. It is unrealistic to impose

356

the assumption on the cells to spend an exponentially distributed amount of time in the eclipse or

357

infectious phases (here equivalent to nE = nI = 1) as it would allow cells to initiate viral production

358

immediately upon infection, stop viral production immediately after it is initiated, and produce virus

359

indefinitely [19, 18, 30, 31, 57]. Therefore, we subdivided eclipse and infectious phases into nE and

360

nI compartments, such that these times are Erlang distributed with means τE and τI , respectively.

361

Erlang distribution is a special case of Gamma distribution of which the shape is dictated by nE and

362

nI and vary from an exponential (= 1) to a normal-like ( 1) (Figure 6). Infectious cells in all stages

363

can produce viral genomes at the rate ((p), measured in RNA×(cell × h)−1 ), the proportion of which

364

((α), measured in PFU/RNA) translates into infectious virus. Viral particles degrade at the rate

365

((crna ), measured in h−1 ) and infectious virus loses infectivity at the rate ((c), measured in h−1 ). The

The experiments to obtain viral load data at different time points began with overlaying the

370

virus supernatant on susceptible cells followed by a one hour cultivation to allow cell infection. The

371

supernatant was then removed and cells were thoroughly washed off the remaining virus that did

372

not enter the cells. The proportion of susceptible cells that became infected was governed by the

373

multiplicity of infection (i.e., the ratio of infectious virus in the inoculum to the total number of

374

susceptible cells) and was assumed to follow Poisson distribution as follows:

Proportion of cells receiving N viral particles =

MOIN exp(−MOI)
.
N!

(5)

375

We further simplify the process by allowing only eclipse cells in their first stage of eclipse phase, E1 ,

376

to have received the virus. The fraction of E1 cells which received one or more viruses is equivalent

Proportion of E1 cells = 1 −

378

Thus, the initial conditions are T (t = 0) = T0 × exp(−MOI), E1 (t = 0) = T0 × (1 − exp(−MOI)),

379

E2,...,nE (t = 0) = 0, I1,...,nI (t = 0) = 0, Vpfu (t = 0) = 0, and Vrna (t = 0) = 0, where T0 = 2 × 105

380

susceptible cells seeded in each well.

381

Parameter inference

382

infer viral parameters and perform model selection. We simulated large numbers of datasets using

383

parametrisations sampled from a log-uniform prior probability distribution for each model parameter.

384

Specifically, the ranges over which we varied both CHIKV and ZIKV parameters were nE ∼ U (1, 40),

385

nI ∼ U (1, 40), log10 βV ∼ U (−10, c/T0 ), log10 βC ∼ U (−6, −1), log10 τE ∼ U (−1, 2) and log10 τI ∼

386

U (−1, 3). CHIKV-specific parameter ranges were within log10 p ∼ U (0, 6), log10 α ∼ U (−2, 0) and

387

ZIKV-specific parameter ranges were within log10 p ∼ U (2, 8), log10 α ∼ U (−5, 0). At the time

388

point t = 0h, the extracellular virus was either undetectable or some residual virus was detected due

389

to insufficient washing of cells. Thus, we keep the initial residual extracellular viral loads as free

390

parameters and do not allow the residual virus to engage in the dynamics (residual infectious virus

391

and RNA genomes are only allow to decay at the rates c and crna , respectively). The initial CHIKV

392

residual inputs were varied within log10 Vpfu (0) ∼ U (0, 2), log10 Vrna (0) ∼ U (0, 3) for low MOI infection

393

and log10 Vpfu (0) ∼ U (2.5, 3.5) and log10 Vrna (0) ∼ U (2.5, 3.5) for high MOI infection. The initial

394

ZIKV residual inputs were varied within log10 Vpfu (0) ∼ U (1.5, 2.5), log10 Vrna (0) ∼ U (2.5, 5.5) for low

395

MOI infection and log10 Vpfu (0) ∼ U (3, 4.5) and log10 Vrna (0) ∼ U (4, 7.5) for high MOI infection. We

396

numerically solved the system (4) using the Python function scipy.integrate.odeint and simulated

397

data Vpfu and Vrna were then compared with the mean of measured data Dpfu and Drna by calculating

403

constructed from the pool of accepted parametrisations.

404

Model selection

405

sion model over the standard model by computing posterior odds as a summary of such evidence.

406

Practically, for each of the models we find the largest distance (7) at which a parameter set was ac-

407

cepted. Using the smaller of these two distances, we can then determine for each model the number

408

of parameter sets that would be accepted at this threshold. The posterior odds are then the fraction

409

of all parameter sets accepted at this threshold contributed by each model.

410

Biological constraints

411

the spread of infection is modelled by free-virus transmission. Since infectious virus is cleared at a rate

412

c, then its mean lifetime is 1/c. Therefore, the mean number of cells infectious virus infects during

413

its lifetime is βV T0 /c. We require that inferred viral parameters satisfy βV T0 /c ≤ 1 and thus, on

414

average, infectious virus can infect at most one cell.

We evaluate the evidence provided by the data in favour of cell-to-cell transmis-

We impose realistic biological constraints on the viral parameters whenever

415

Since we initiate equations (4) at time 0h assuming a portion of cells already in the eclipse phase,

416

any combination of viral parameters will result in viral growth. To ensure realistic parametrization

417

of equations (4), we required the basic reproduction number R0 , defined as the number of secondary

418

infected cells that will be infected by a single infectious cell in a completely susceptible population is

419

at least one, to satisfy R0 = βV T0 τI α p/c ≥ 1. R0 is here a product of the mean amount of infectious

420

virus produced during the lifetime of an infected cell (α p τI ) and the mean number of cells infected

421

per infectious virus βV T0 /c [58].

Figure 2: Graphical representation of the mathematical model (4) describing the in vitro viral
kinetics. Susceptible cells (T ) may get infected either by extracellular free virus entering susceptible
cells at the rate (βV Vpfu ) or when virus invades susceptible cells from virus-producing cells via cellto-cell transmission at the rate (βC Vpfu ). Upon successful virus infection, susceptible cells enter an
eclipse phase which is divided into nE sub-phases each of which last (nE /τE ) time units. Thus, the
duration of eclipse phase is τE time units and (E1 ), . . . , (EnE ) are cells in eclipse sub-phases. Only
cells in the last sub-phase of eclipse phase (EnE ) enter infectious phase in which they become virusproducing. Infectious phase is divided into nI sub-phases each of which last (nI /τI ) time units. Thus,
the duration of infectious phase is τI time units and (I1 ), . . . , (InI ) are cells in infectious sub-phases.
Cells in any infectious sub-phase produce virus at the rate (p). Only cells in the last sub-phase of
infectious phase (InI ) exit the system at the rate (nI /τI ). Infectious virus loses infectivity at the rate
(c) and viral genomes lose stability at the rate (crna ).

Figure 6: Probability density (y-axis) that a cell spends x hours in the (eclipse or infectious) phase.
As the Erlang shape parameter (nE or nI in the model (4) for the eclipse and virus-producing phases,
respectively) is increased, the distribution of the phase duration shifts from an exponential (n = 1), to
a fat-tailed (1 < n < 10), to a normal-like (n  10) distribution. In these graphs, the mean time spent
by cells in the phase (τE or τI in the model (4), respectively) is fixed (set to 10h, chosen arbitrarily)
as the shape parameter (nE or nI ) is varied.
