Length-weight regressions (LWR, 𝑊 = 𝑎 × 𝐿𝑏) of 17 coastal fish species from the
Luanhe River Estuary in northern China are presented in this study. A total of 7354
samples from 11 families were measured and weighed. The slope (b) values for LWR
ranged from 2.572 in Acanthogobius ommaturus to 3.6581 in Engraulis japonicus. The
median value was 3.114 in Platycephalus indicus, although 50% of the values ranged
between 2.9451 to 3.2965 for the entire data set.

Estuarine areas are extremely important areas in the life cycle of some fish species.
These ecosystems provide food, shelter, and spawning grounds for varieties of marine
organisms. The Luan River is a sediment-laden water course on the northern shore of
Bohai Bay, China[1]. The estuary of the Luan River is a famous fishing ground and
nursery area for marine organisms within Bohai Bay. This area is recognized as an
important feeding and breeding location for migratory species[2-5].
Length-weight regressions (LWR) are an important tool for the proper exploitation
and management of fish populations[6]. Length and weight data for fish are needed to
estimate growth rates, age structure, and other population dynamics[7]. This information
is commonly used in the ecosystem modeling approach [8] to calculate the production to
biomass ratio (P/B) of different functional groups, taking into account that for more
precise weight estimates it is advisable to make use of local values. In addition, LWR
allow life history and morphological comparisons between different fish species, or
between fish populations from different habitats and/or regions [9]. Biological scientists
often estimate fish weight in the field using LWR [10].
Prior to this study there was LWR data available for fish species in the Luanhe River
Estuary and this study provides the first LWR references for 17 fish species from this
area. This study aimed to provide information that could be used for the management of
the Luanhe River fishery grounds. The LWR data will be made available through the
Fishbase Database[11], so that they can be used by other researchers.

The field survey was approved by the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
This study was carried out in the Luanhe River Estuary between longitude E 118°
57’-119°09’ and latitude N 39°03’-39°15’. The estuary is subject to irregular, semidiurnal
tides. The current study was conducted in 2016-2017 as part of a series of studies to
assess the biological sustainable capacity of this area. Samples were collected at monthly
intervals from December 2016 to August 2017 and at bimonthly intervals from July 2016
to November 2017. The fishing gear used for sampling included a crab pot, trammel net
of various inner mesh sizes, and a bottom trawl. Individual trinal nets (50 m in length)
with mesh sizes of 2.0 cm, 3.3 cm, 3.5 cm, and 4.0 cm and an outer net mesh of 17.0 cm
were used. The trinal nets were 1.3 m high, and the four mesh sizes were connected
together, giving a total length of 200 m with four different inner net mesh sizes. The

length of a single crab pot was 8 m, and five were connected together at the survey
station, giving a total length of 40 m. Trawling was carried out at a speed of 2 knots and
the mouth of the net was 2.5 m long.
After hauling, fish samples were immediately transported to the laboratory in Hebei
Provincial Research Institute for Engineering Technology of Coastal Ecology
Rehabilitation. Specimens were identified to the species level. Scientific names for each
species were checked in Fishbase[11]. The standard length (L) of each specimen was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a 30-cm ruler. Fish body weight for all specimens
was weighed to the nearest 0.01 g using an electric balance (CR-5000WP, Custom,
Japan).
LWR were calculated using the equation 𝑊 = 𝑎 × 𝐿𝑏 [12]. The relationships
between the length and weight of the specimens were calculated by least-square linear
regressions applied to logarithmic transformed data combined as[13]:
log 𝑊 = log 𝑎 + 𝑏 × log 𝐿
Where ‘W’ is fish body weight (g), ‘L’ is fish standard length (cm), ‘a’ is the initial
growth coefficient and ‘b’ is the growth coefficient. The statistical significance level of
R2 was estimated in LWR fitted by least-squares regression. Only extreme outliers
attributed to errors in data collection were omitted from the analyses.
The application of these regressions should be limited to the observed length ranges.
These estimated parameters can be treated as mean annual values for the species in our
study.
The 95% confidence interval, CI of b was computed using the equation:
𝐶𝐼 = 𝑏 ± (1.96 × 𝑆𝐸)
Where 𝑆𝐸 is the standard error of b.

A total of 7354 individuals belonging to 17 species (11 families) were recorded in
this study. The species, family, sample size (N), length range (cm) and weight range (g),
length-weight relationship parameters a and b, 95% confidence interval for b, the
coefficient of determination (R2) are presented in Table 1. Linear regressions of log
transformed data were highly significant (P<0.05) for all analyzed species. The most
abundant species sampled was Chaeturichthys stigmatias (N=2483). The best represented
family was Gobiidae with 4 species recorded.
The coefficients of determination (R2) ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 for Mugil cephalus,
Sebastes schlegelii, Engraulis japonicus, Paralichthys olivaceus, Tridentiger barbatus,
Sardinella zunasi, Acanthogobius ommaturus, Thrissa kammalensis, Hexagrammos

0.90 and 0.95 for Ctenotrypauchen microcephalus, Cynoglossus joyneri, Konosirus

punctatus, Johnius belangerii, Syngnathus acus, Cociella crocodilus, corresponding to a
mean value of 0.957( ± 0.030).
LWR slope (b) values ranged from 2.572 for Acanthogobius ommaturus to 3.6581
for Engraulis japonicus. The median value was 3.114 for Platycephalus indicus, although
50% of the values ranged from 2.9451 to 3.2965 for the complete data set (Fig.1). When
b=3, weight growth is isometric, and when the value of b differs from 3, weight growth is
allometric (b>3;b<3). In terms of growth type, these results revealed that 3 species
showed negative allometries (b<3), 9 showed positive allometries (b>3) and 5 showed
isometric growth (b=3). Most of the species generally presented positive allometric
growth. C. crocodilus (b=2.9446), C. stigmatias (b=2.9453), J. belangerii (b=3.0379), H.
otakii (b=3.0513), M. cephalus (b=3.0692) all displayed isometric growth. Various
factors may be responsible for differences in parameters of LWR such as temperature,
salinity, food (quantity, quality and size), sex, time of year and stage of maturity.
The data collected during this study represents an important contribution of base line
data on the LWR of a number of fish species that were previously unavailable. It is
important to point out that these LWR should be strictly limited to the length ranges used
in the estimation of the linear regression parameters [14]. The results obtained in the
current study will contribute to the knowledge of fish populations in the important
Luanhe River Estuary and also assist fisheries scientists and managers in the future.
