Abstract
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental illness that is associated with an increased
prevalence of age-related disability and morbidity compared to the general population. An
accelerated aging process has therefore been hypothesized as a component of the SCZ
disease trajectory. Here, we investigated differential aging using three DNA methylation
(DNAm) clocks (i.e. Hannum, Horvath, Levine) in a multi-cohort SCZ whole blood sample
consisting of 1,100 SCZ cases and 1,200 controls. It is known that all three DNAm clocks
are highly predictive of chronological age and capture different features of biological aging.
We found that blood-based DNAm aging is significantly altered in SCZ with age- and sexspecific effects that differ between clocks and map to distinct chronological age windows.
Most notably, the predicted phenotypic age (Levine clock) in female cases, starting at age 36
and beyond, is 3.21 years older compared to matching control subjects (95% CI: 1.92-4.50,
P=1.3e-06) explaining 7.7% of the variance in disease status. Female cases with high SCZ
polygenic risk scores present the highest age acceleration in this age group with +7.03 years
(95% CI: 3.87-10.18, P=1.7E-05). Since increased phenotypic age is associated with
increased risk of all-cause mortality, our findings suggests that specific and identifiable
patient groups are at increased mortality risk as measured by the Levine clock. These
results provide new biological insights into the aging landscape of SCZ with age- and sexspecific effects and warrant further investigations into the potential of DNAm clocks as
clinical biomarkers that may help with disease management in schizophrenia.

Introduction
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with significant impact on the
individual, their family, and society. A substantial proportion of people diagnosed with SCZ
has chronic symptoms and disability across their lifespan1–3. SCZ is associated with an
increased mortality4–6 and a 15 year reduced life expectancy compared to the general
population7. Despite elevated rates of suicide and other unnatural causes of death, most
morbidity in SCZ is attributed to age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases, and diabetes mellitus8,9,5). The increased prevalence of age-related disabilities and
morbidities suggests that biological aging may be accelerated in SCZ10,11.
DNA methylation (DNAm) age predictors, or “epigenetic clocks”, are biomarkers of
ageing that generate a highly accurate estimate of chronological age, known as DNAm
age12–14. The

difference between (predicted) DNAm and chronological age (Δage) is

associated with a wide-range of health and disease outcomes. For example, DNAm age
acceleration in blood is associated with all-cause mortality15–18, socioeconomic adversity and
smoking19, metabolic outcomes, such as body mass index and obesity20,21, and brain-related
phenotypes, such as Parkinson's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, major
depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder22–24,25,26.
While different aging biomarkers have been studied, there is no clear demonstration
of altered aging in SCZ11. More specifically, DNAm age predictors have found limited to no
evidence for altered epigenetic aging in either brain or blood

27–31

. These studies, however,

(i) consisted of small sample sizes and thus limiting the ability to detect a biological signal,
(ii) used a single epigenetic clock that may have not been most informative for aging studies
of psychiatric disorders, and (iii) did not consider aging differences across the life-span of
patients. As morbidities in the SCZ population differ between older and younger individuals,
and females and males 5, analyses of both age- and sex-specific effects is warranted and
could identify differential aging patterns nevertheless.
To investigate DNAm aging in SCZ, we used three independent DNAm age
estimators; the Hannum13, Horvath12,32, and Levine clock14. Each clock is designed using

different training features and capture distinct characteristics of aging12,32: the Hannum age
predictor was trained on whole blood adult samples, the Horvath predictor was trained
across 30 tissues and cell types across developmental stages, and the Levine predictor
combines DNAm from adult blood samples with clinical blood-based measures. As the
Levine estimator is trained on chronological age and nine clinical markers, its output is
referred to as DNAm PhenoAge or “phenotypic age”. The Hannum estimator captures
measures of cell extrinsic aging in blood, whereas the Horvath clock measures cell intrinsic
aging as it was trained across multiple tissues and therefore is less dependent on cell type
composition. All three clocks, in different but complementary ways, capture the pace of
biological aging that is associated with age-related conditions and diseases, including allcause mortality14,32.
Here, we used these clocks to investigate DNAm aging in SCZ using four European
case-control cohorts. Analysis are performed across the full sample and stratified by age and
sex. SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRS), age at onset, duration of illness, DNAm smoking
scores, and blood cell type proportions were used to gain further insights into differential
aging patterns. This study overall reports an in-depth investigation of the DNAm aging
landscape in schizophrenia.

Material and Methods
Cohort and sample description
Details of samples included in this study can be found in the Supplementary
Information. Briefly, unrelated individuals diagnosed with SCZ and ancestry-matched nonpsychiatric controls from four cohorts of European ancestry were included; the Netherlands
(N=1,116), Scotland (N=847), Sweden (N=96), and the United Kingdom (N=675). Cases
were selected on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of SCZ using the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), or the
International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD10). Controls were unaffected subjects
without a history of any major psychiatric disorder. Whole blood DNAm data was available
for a total of 2,707 samples (1,399 cases and 1,308 controls; (Table S1).

Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and data processing
To quantify DNA methylation, DNA was extracted from whole blood and bisulfite
converted for hybridization to the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation Beadchip. Samples
were assayed with either the 27K or 450K beadchip, which contain 27,578 and 485,512
probes that interrogate CpG sites across the genome, respectively. For each platform, data
processing pipelines were implemented, which includes background correction, color
channel and probe type correction, and normalization of the data, to minimize the effect of
technical variation on the final beta values. Samples with more than 5% of probes detected
at P > 0.05 were excluded from further analyses (n=13). Full details are described in the
supplementary methods.

DNAm-based estimation of biological age
To compute blood-based DNAm age estimates, processed beta values were used as
input to the Hannum13, Horvath12, and Levine14 DNAm clock. These DNAm age estimators
use a set of CpGs that are selected via an optimization algorithm to collectively minimize the
error associated with estimating chronological age (Supplementary Information). Horvath

DNAm age estimates were calculated using R scripts from the Horvath DNA Methylation
Calculator (https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu)12. Hannum and Levine estimates were
obtained by using the reported set of probes with corresponding regression weights. We
define Δage by subtracting chronological age at the time of the blood draw from the
predicted DNAm age.

Statistical analyses
To investigate epigenetic aging differences in SCZ, we first removed samples with
discrepant phenotypic sex and predicted sex based on DNAm data (n=9),

as well as

samples with missing chronological age data (n=237), bipolar disorder diagnosis (n=26), and
duplicate samples (n=126). For each epigenetic clock, we regressed Δage on technical
principal components (PCs), using the first components that cumulatively explain >90% of
variation in intensity values of control probes, and added the residuals to mean(Δage) to
generate a measure in the same units as Δage that is adjusted for technical variation (Δageadjusted). We used the adjusted value for subsequent analyses and refer to it as Δage.
To avoid skewing of chronological age distribution between groups33, we removed
any case older than the oldest control subject in each cohort (n = 5 for NLD, 16 for SCT, 4
for SWD, and 1 for UK). Chronological age was furthermore included as a covariate in all
analyses. To minimize the effect of outlying samples, we excluded samples >3SD from
mean Δage across cohorts (ranging from n=13 to 16 for the three clocks). These are
samples for which DNAm age diverged substantially from chronological age, which are likely
artifacts.
For each clock and each cohort, we implemented a multivariable regression model
predicting Δage as a function of schizophrenia status, sex, and age. For the Dutch cohort,
batch and array platform were also included as covariates, as this cohort consists of multiple
datasets. For each clock, regression coefficients with corresponding standard errors for each
of the four cohorts were then supplied to the rma() function of the metafor package34 in R to
fit a meta-analytic fixed-effect model with inverse-variance weights and obtain an overall

effect size and test statistic. To quantify the significance of age- and sex-specific effects, we
determined the contribution of interaction effects on top of the main disease effect. We first
combined all cohorts to maintain necessary sample sizes across age and sex groups. Age
groups were defined by grouping samples by decades with ages 18 and 19 included in the
first decade (18-30, 31-40, etc.). To quantify the gain in variance explained in Δage, models
with the interaction term were compared to a baseline model without the interaction term.
For each analysis, statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni correction, i.e. P
< 0.05 / number of tests.

SCZ polygenic risk quantification
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were obtained from analyses of the SCZ GWAS
conducted by Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)35. Using a leave one out approach,
weights were generated in a training dataset based on all samples minus the target cohort in
which the PRS were calculated. For each individual, weighted single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were summed to a genetic risk score that represents a quantitative
and normally distributed measure of SNP-based SCZ genetic risk. To reduce between
cohort-variation and maximize statistical power, we used a previously developed analytical
strategy that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to concentrate disease risk across
PRSs of ten GWAS p-value thresholds into the first principal component (PRS1)36
(Supplementary Information). PRS1 explains 70.7% of the variance in risk scores and 19.9%
of the variance in SCZ status; the remaining PCs had no explanatory value in disease status
(mean R2 = 0.0%), indicating that PRS1 captures the majority of SNP-based SCZ polygenic
risk. PRS1 was generated for 1,933 individuals, 853 cases and 1080 controls, and modeled
as both a quantitative and categorical variable to predict Δage.

Defining age at onset and illness duration
Age at onset is defined as the earliest reported age of psychotic symptoms or by the
Operational Criteria Checklist (OPCRIT), depending on the cohort. This data is available for

a subset of cases (N = 710) across the Dutch, Scottish, and UK cohorts. Illness duration is
defined as the time between age at onset and blood collection. A more detailed description
of each cohort’s definition is available in the Supplementary Information.

DNA methylation-based smoking scores and blood cell type proportions
Smoking scores and blood cell type proportions were estimated from the data (see
Supplementary Methods) and used as a proxy to further decompose differential aging
effects.

Estimating the contribution of differential aging in schizophrenia
Using a multivariable logistic regression model for disease status, we fitted batch,
cohort, DNAm smoking score, DNAm blood cell type proportions, and Δage as explanatory
variables. We first performed a variable reduction step to select the most contributing
variables to disease status by use of a regularized logistic regression using the glmnet()
function in R (“glmnet” package, v2.13)37. Alpha was set to “1” (Lasso) and the lambda
parameter estimated at the optimal value that minimizes the cross-validation prediction error
rate using the cv.glmnet() function. For each selected variable, we then report the variance
explained in SCZ status (glm, family = ”binomial”) for both the individual variable as well as
adjusted for all other selected variables using the NagelkerkeR2() function in the “fmsb”
package (v 0.6.3). The significance of each variable their contribution was computed by
comparing the model with and without the variable of interest using the likelihood ratio test of
the anova() function.

Results
Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of the study design and analysis framework
used to investigate DNAm aging in SCZ. After data preprocessing and quality control, 1,090
SCZ cases and 1,206 controls (2,296 subjects of 2,707 initial samples) were included in our
analysis. The overall sample has a mean age of 40.3 years (SD=14.4) and consists of
34.5% women (Table S1 and Figure S1).

[FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE - SCHEMATIC OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN]

Across cohorts, all three clocks produce a high correlation with chronological age
(Pearson’s r = 0.92-0.94; Figure 2A and S2). Using duplicates in the Dutch cohort, we
assessed consistency between pairs of technical replicates, i.e. samples for which blood
was collected at the same time but DNA processed at different times and DNAm data
obtained on different arrays. Comparing Δage estimates between these pairs, we find a
significant correlation for each clock (Figure S3); Hannum (rho = 0.79, n = 10), Horvath (rho
= 0.53, n=118), Levine (rho = 0.67, n=118). Δage directionality (i.e. age deceleration or
acceleration) is concordant in 90%, 73%, and 86% of pairs for Hannum, Horvath, and
Levine, respectively, highlighting that the obtained estimates of DNAm age are reproducible
for all three clocks. Comparing Δage estimates between clocks using all samples, we find a
moderate concordance (Pearson’s r = 0.39-0.43; Figure S4), demonstrating that a significant
proportion of the variation in Δage is clock-specific. This indicates that these estimators
capture different features of biological aging and that investigating all three epigenetic clocks
simultaneously may thus yield broader insights into differential aging.

DNA methylation age is altered in an age-dependent manner
Across the full sample, SCZ cases are on average 1.53 years older in phenotypic
Δage (Levine clock) compared to controls (Pmeta= 3.45E-08) (Figure 2B). The intrinsic cellular
age (Horvath) predictor revealed an opposite pattern, with SCZ cases appearing 0.47 years
younger compared to controls (Pmeta= 0.06). No differences were observed between cases
and controls when applying the blood-based Hannum DNAm age predictor. No evidence of
heterogeneity between the four cohorts was observed for any of the DNAm age analyses
(Phet > 0.05, Tables S5-S8).
Modeling the interaction effect between disease status and chronological age on
Δage reveals a differential rate of aging between cases and controls (Figure 2C). That is, the
slope of Δage across chronological age is 0.05 and 0.06 years steeper in cases compared to
controls for the Horvath (Pmeta=2.3E-03) and Levine clocks (Pmeta=7.1E-03), respectively
(Figure S5 and Table S6). As no significant effects were observed for the Hannum Δage, we
decided to focus our downstream analysis on the phenotypic (Levine) age and intrinsic
cellular (Horvath) age only. To further disentangle the relationship between Δage in SCZ
conditional on chronological age, we estimated differential aging by 10 year intervals, with
years 18 and 19 included in the first age group. We observe significant DNAm age
deceleration in early adulthood (18-30 years) with cases estimated at -1.23 years younger
(Pmeta=3.9E-03) in intrinsic cellular age with no significant difference at later ages (Figure 3).
In phenotypic age, SCZ cases displayed significant DNAm age acceleration from 30 years
and older, with the most pronounced age acceleration between 50-60 years (2.29 years,
Pmeta=9.0E-03). We find no evidence of heterogeneity between cohorts (Figure S6 and Table
S7-8).

Age- and sex-specific effects contribute independently to DNAm aging
To quantify the contribution of age- and also sex-specific effects, we estimated the
gain in variance explained of Δage by adding the interaction terms of age and sex with
disease status to a baseline model and assesed the gain in model performance (Table 1 and
S9). For intrinsic cellular aging, the baseline model explains 4.0% of the variance of Horvath
Δage. The variance explained increases significantly to 5.5% and 5.9% when a two-way
interaction between status and (categorical) age and a three-way interaction between status,
age, and sex is added, respectively. For phenotypic age, the baseline model explains 3.2%
of the variance of Levine Δage. Similarly, the variance-explained of the Levine Δage
signifcantly increases to 3.9% and 4.7%, respectively, with the interaction terms added to the
model. For both measures of aging, inclusion of interaction terms presented a significantly
better fit, especially with the three-way interaction model (i.e. disease status, categorical age
and biological sex). We do observe a larger gain in model fit for the three-way interaction for
phenotypic aging (P=0.01) than for intrinsic cellular aging (P=0.24), suggesting that sexspecific effects may be less pronounced for Horvath Δage.

Estimating and mapping windows of differential aging in schizophrenia
In order to refine the age-dependent aging effects and decompose its effect to more
specific age windows, we implemented a sliding window approach across chronological age,
both in the full sample and within each sex separately. Using 5-year bins and sliding steps of
1 year, we tested cases versus age-matched controls and constructed a more precise
picture of differential aging across chronological age in SCZ (Figure 4). We mapped changes
in Δage to specific ages with different patterns between men and women. For intrinsic
cellular age, we observe a deceleration effect during early adulthood from 29 years and
younger across all samples, with the shift in differential aging occurring earlier in women
(<25) (Figure 4B). While we previously did not observe differences in intrinsic cellular aging

across other categorical age groups (Figure 3 and S7), the higher resolution, sliding window
analysis reveals additional disease effects. For both men and women, we observe age
deceleration in mid-forties and for women we also find age acceleration between 50-56
years (Figure 4A-C).
For phenotypic age, we mapped the age acceleration effect to 27 years and older
across the whole sample with male / female differences (Figure 4D-F). In women, we
observe age acceleration between 25-29 years and from 36 years and older (Figure 4E). In
men, we see age acceleration between 27-39 and 49-59 years (Figure 4F). More details on
each age window and corresponding effect sizes are shown in Table S10. Thus far, our
results show that DNAm aging, measured through the Horvath and Levine clock, is
significantly different in SCZ and that this overall effect is characterized by age-specific
effects with some distinctions between the sexes, particularly for Levine Δage.

[ FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE ]

Age deceleration by multi-tissue Horvath clock is not present in brain
In order to examine whether the blood DNAm age findings are also observed in the
brain, we investigated DNAm aging in frontal cortex postmortem brain samples of 221 SCZ
cases and 278 controls. The multi-tissue Horvath clock accurately predicts DNAm age in
brain as well (r=0.94, P < 2.2e-16). We however find no difference in DNAm aging between
cases and controls (ß=-0.29, P=0.46) and no evidence of age-dependent aging either. More
details are shown in the Supplementary Results (S2.1).

Phenotypic age acceleration is associated with SCZ polygenic risk in women
To further decipher the factors underlying the signal of differential aging in SCZ, we
examined the possible role of SCZ polygenic risk (PRS1), age at onset, and illness duration
(Figure S8). We first focus on the phenotypic age acceleration in female cases of age 36
years and older, the age range which we identified as showing the most consistent and

significant aging effect. We find stronger age acceleration in cases with both low and high
SCZ genetic risk (Table 2). Cases in the highest PRS1 tertile are predicted to be 4.30 years
older in phenotypic age compared to controls (P=1.3E-05), cases with median range PRS
are 1.89 years older (P=4.5E-02), and cases in the lowest quartile are 2.89 years older
(P=2.8E-03). By permutation of PRS1 groups, we find that the observed effect in female
cases in the highest PRS1 group is unlikely to occur by chance (P=0.024). For the
association between Levine Δage and PRS1 to be most pronounced in the low and high
group, is even less likely to happen by chance (P=0.006). At maximum, this group of women
carrying high SCZ genetic risk have on average 7.03 higher phenotypic Δage (95% CI: 3.8710.18; P=1.7E-05) (Figure 5A). We do not observe such an association in women age < 36
years, men with age > 36 years, nor across the whole dataset (Figure S9). For age at onset
and illness duration, we did not find significant association with Δage across partitioned bins
(after permutation, P > 0.05) (Table 2). This is further confirmed when we integrated these
two variables across PRS1 tertiles, demonstrating that the most pronounced differences in
Δage are observed across PRS1 bins and not across the distribution of age at onset and
illness duration (Figure 5B-C).

[ TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE ]

We conducted a similar investigation on the observed intrinsic cellular age
deceleration in all SCZ cases age 29 years and younger but found no significant
associations between Horvath Δage and PRS1, age at onset, or illness duration (Table S11
and Figure S10). While we did observe the strongest Horvath age deceleration in the high
PRS1 tertile (β=-1.58, P=3.0E-03), this was not significant after permutation analysis
(P>0.05). We did not analyze other identified age windows of differential aging as these
either had too few individuals with genetic or phenotypic information available or more
modest disease effects limiting any further stratification.

DNAm aging affects SCZ above and beyond smoking and blood cell types
People suffering from SCZ smoke more than the general population38 (Figure 5A)
and blood cell type composition changes across the lifespan39 (Figure 5B). To investigate
the effect of these factors, we use DNAm-based smoking and cell type estimations (see
Methods) as a proxy to evaluate their contribution to DNAm aging in SCZ. While DNAm
clocks, by design, will encapsulate such effects, quantifying the contributions of each factor
increases interpretability and helps understand the factors contributing to the differential
aging findings. In women age 36 and older, the patient group in which we observed the most
profound aging effects, a regularized logistic regression selected dataset/ethnicity, smoking,
5 cell types, and Levine Δage to explain a total of 23.6% of the variance in SCZ disease
status (P=2.2E-08) (Table S12). Levine Δage explains 7.7% individually and 2.8% (P=3.3E03) when adjusted for other selected variables (Figure 6C).
In individuals 29 years and younger, the group with the significant deceleration aging
effects, the lasso regression selected batch/ethnicity, age, sex, smoking, 7 cell types, and
Horvath Δage, which together explain 49.8% of the variance in disease status (Table S12). A
large proportion of this effect is driven by smoking, which explains 28.8%. Horvath Δage
explains 3.1% of the variance in SCZ individually and 0.6% adjusted for other select
variables (P=0.14). A significant proportion of the Horvath Δage effect on disease status is
reduced by adjusting for smoking. However, smoking has no association with Horvath Δage
in controls (Pearson r=0.01, P=0.95) nor in cases (Pearson r=-0.08, P=0.28) (Figure S12).
As smoking is confounded with SCZ disease status, it is difficult to distinguish these signals.
In relation to SCZ genetic risk, smoking and blood cell types demonstrate limited effects on
the observed pattern of differential aging across PRS1 (Figure S13).

Discussion
We performed one of the largest aging and epigenetic studies in schizophrenia to
date using multiple epigenetic clocks based on whole blood DNA methylation data. We
observe significant patterns of sex-specific and age-dependent DNAm aging in SCZ, a
finding consistent across four European cohorts. The most significant differential aging
pattern that we observe is in females ages 36 years and older in which we detect advanced
phenotypic age acceleration, as measured by the Levine clock, explaining 7.7% of the
variance in disease status. We also observe intrinsic cellular age deceleration in SCZ during
early adulthood, as measured by the Horvath clock, explaining 3.1% of the variance in
disease status. The phenotypic age acceleration in females diagnosed with SCZ is
associated with a high burden of SCZ polygenic risk. This high SCZ risk group displays
accelerated aging of an average of 7 years compared to age-matched female controls. Our
findings suggests that specific and identifiable patient groups are at increased mortality risk
as measured by the Levine clock.
The Levine estimator was constructed by predicting a surrogate measure of
phenotypic age, which is a weighted average of 10 clinical markers, including chronological
age, albumin, creatinine, glucose and C-reactive protein levels, alkaline phosphatase and
various blood cell related measures14. By design, the Levine estimator is a composite
biomarker that strongly predicts mortality, in particular that of cardiovascular-related
phenotypes. A 1-year increase in Levine DNAm age is associated with a 9% increased risk
of all-cause mortality and a 10% and 20% increase of cardiovascular disease and diabetes
mortality risk, respectively14,40. Our findings of multiple year increase in Levine DNAm age in
SCZ could thus imply an increased mortality in these individuals that is linked to disease, a
previously well-established epidemiological observation4–6. A recent study however found
that DNAm age acceleration only predicts mortality in SCZ cases without pre-existing cancer
using the Hannum clock41. They did not find such evidence using the Levine clock. The
smaller sample size and predominantly male cohort may have reduced the predictive power
of the study. Our findings warrant a more focused and larger study of DNAm aging in

females in later adulthood, preferably stratified by SCZ genetic risk. Our results align well
with the observation that people diagnosed with SCZ, particularly women, are reported to be
at high mortality risk due to cardiovascular disease and diabetes5,42,43. Assuming that
cardiovascular risk is modifiable in SCZ44, Levine DNAm age could serve as a potential
biomarker to identify at-risk individuals and in this way help with disease management and
improvement of life expectancy.
In contrast to age acceleration in Levine DNAm age, we observe age deceleration in
intrinsic cellular age (i.e. the Horvath DNAm age), an effect that is most pronounced in cases
age 29 and younger. Unlike the association in females, we did not observe clear patterns
with genetic and phenotypic variables that could help deconstruct the signal. Horvath Δage
furthermore showed strong age-specific effects but less clear sex-specific effects. We did not
observe age deceleration in postmortem brain samples of the human cortex, indicating the
the observe signal may be blood-specific. Horvath DNAm aging has been shown to
associate with molecular processes of development and cell differentiation12,32, including
human (neuro)developmental phenotypes45,46. Our findings may indicate that individuals
diagnosed with SCZ in this age group show evidence of delayed or deficient development
and that this is detectable in blood through the multi-tissue Horvath clock. This however
remains speculative and future work is needed to further dissect how blood-based Horvath
age deceleration is associated with SCZ.
While we did observe aging effects with the Horvath and Levine clock, we did not
with the Hannum clock. The Hannum clock is less predictive of age acceleration effects on
mortality risk than the Levine clock14, which could explain the lack of findings in our
analyses. The Hannum estimator furthermore cannot be used on first generation 27K DNA
methylation arrays which reduced the sample size of this study with 30% and may have
impacted the statistical power of these specific analyses. This highlights the benefits of
designing methods that are inclusive to all platforms, so all data, both old and new, can be
leveraged.

Previous studies that investigated DNAm aging in SCZ did not observe significant
differential aging

27–31

, highlighting that sample size and/or explicit modeling of age- and sex-

dependent effects are crucial factors when investigating aging in SCZ. Our findings also
demonstrate that analyzing these clocks simultaneously can reveal new insights that may
otherwise be missed. A systematic review of aging biomarkers found that less than a quarter
of studies explored an interaction effect or statistically compared the regression slope
between groups in SCZ11. Our findings support their recommendations to specifically
examine age-specific effects in aging studies but also more general in epigenetic studies of
SCZ, such as epigenome-wide association studies. Future work should also be extended to
integrate nonlinear models to fully capture the complex relationship between DNAm aging
and clinically relevant variables across the lifespan. These models will help validate and
further refine the most relevant age intervals.
A limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design of the cohorts used. While we
do find an association with SCZ polygenic risk, dissecting cause-and-effect relationships
remains challenging. Large-scale longitudinal prospective cohorts with detailed clinical and
genomic information are needed to further examine differential aging in SCZ and assess its
clinical relevance above and beyond other known health risk factors and disease
biomarkers, such as medication use. In addition, improvement of existing and/or
development of new DNAm age biomarkers may help to better study differential aging in
SCZ and related disorders with increased mortality. Combining blood-based DNAm age with
that of other aging profiles, such as MRI-based brain age47, may further advance our
understanding of aging and SCZ disease progression, including the increased mortality48.
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder that is associated with severe and oftentimes
chronic disability. While health and life expectancy of the general population continues to
improve, the mortality disparity between people suffering from schizophrenia and those
unaffected continues to increase in the United States and the UK8,9,42. This highlights the
importance of studies on improving the health and longevity of people with schizophrenia
and other severe mental illnesses. Molecular biomarkers of aging, such as DNAm clocks,

are emerging as candidate tools for screening and intervention. Our findings provide
evidence of its potential in clinical care of SCZ. This study strengthens the need for future
large-scale epidemiological studies of DNA methylation aging in SCZ, a population
vulnerable to age-related diseases and excess mortality.

Table 2. Integration of Levine Δage with PRS, age of onset, and illness duration in women in later adulthod. Analyses were
performed using women >36 years of age. Only cases with available information were included in the analyses. Each phenotype was
analyzed as both a continuous variable and as a categorical variable using equal tertiles from low to high bins. Mean values in cases
for each phenotype are presented along with the association with Δage (β) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p-values.
PRS1 = polygenic risk score PC1 (see Supplementary Information) scaled to mean zero with standard deviation of 1, AOO = age of
onset, DUR = illness duration. Asterisk* indicates that significance (P < 0.05) by permutation analyses.
