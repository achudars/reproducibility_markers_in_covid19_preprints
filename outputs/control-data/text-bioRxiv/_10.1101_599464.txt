Abstract
Multi-wavelength ophthalmic imaging and stimulation of photoreceptor cells
requires consideration of chromatic dispersion of the eye, manifesting in
longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberrations. Current image-based techniques
to measure and correct transverse chromatic aberration (TCA) and the resulting
transverse chromatic offset (TCO) in an adaptive optics retinal imaging system are
precise, but lack compensation of small but significant shifts in eye position
occurring during in vivo testing. Here we present a method that requires only a
single measurement of TCO during controlled movements of the eye to map retinal
chromatic image shifts to the image space of a pupil camera. After such calibration,
TCO can be compensated by continuously monitoring eye position during
experimentation and by interpolating correction vectors from a linear fit to the
calibration data. The average change rate of TCO per head shift and the correlation
between Kappa and the individual foveal TCA are close to the expectations based
on a chromatic eye model. Our solution enables continuous correction of TCO with
high spatial precision and avoids high light intensities required for re-measuring
TCO after eye position changes, which is necessary for foveal cone-targeted
psychophysical experimentation.

Introduction

Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) coupled with
microstimulation techniques enables imaging and simultaneous functional testing
of targeted human photoreceptors in vivo. This approach was recently employed to
study single cone photoreceptor function [1,2], retinal circuitry [3,4], color
vision [5,6], and sensitivity changes during retinal disease [7,8].

The specific techniques employed in these studies, using two (or more) beams of
light of different wavelengths for imaging and stimulation, are faced with a
particular challenge arising from the chromatic dispersion characteristics of the
human eye. Due to dispersion, light of different wavelengths will be focused axially
displaced (termed longitudinal chromatic aberration, LCA) [9], and if incident at an
oblique angle, focus points will also be laterally displaced (termed transverse
chromatic aberration, TCA) [10].

43
44

47

The magnitude of LCA is relatively consistent across the population [9,11] and
across the field of view [12,13], thus it can be corrected sufficiently for most eyes by
adjusting the relative vergence between beams of different wavelength. In an
AOSLO system, this is currently achieved by a coaxial displacement of the light
sources’ entry points.

By setting the light sources at different distances, transverse chromatic offset (TCO)
is induced in the eye. These lateral offsets in focus position on the retina have two
origins. One is the imperfect axial positioning of the two (or more) beams. The
second is of ocular origin, and closely related to TCA. When the eye is moved
laterally in front of the displaced beams, their focus location will move laterally on
the retina as a linear function of eye position, akin to a chromatic parallax. The
magnitude of this offset is identical to TCA but opposite in sign [14].

In an AOSLO, TCO can be directly measured by spatially registering simultaneously
recorded retinal images with the two (or more) wavelengths. This method allows a
determination of TCO of the order of arcseconds but requires high light intensities
massively bleaching the photopigment and leading to strong fluctuations in retinal
adaptation [14]. Therefore, continuous or repeated measurements of TCO during
psychophysical sessions are unfeasible.

61
62
63

In earlier studies, TCO was thus statically compensated by assuming no lateral eye
motion between measurements before and after an experimental run. This was
only valid as long as the cone photoreceptor diameter at the targeted eccentricities

was large enough to allow typical residual head and eye movement which would
displace the stimulus within the cone’s diameter [1,3,5,6]. For stimulation of the
smallest cones at the foveal center or rods, however, this approach is no longer
sufficient.

68

70

A chromatic eye model by Thibos et al. [15–17] predicts a simple linear correlation
between TCO and eye position offsets in front of the AOSLO beams, depending on
the wavelengths, described by:
TCA ∝ 𝐸𝑦𝑒𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 × 𝐿𝐶𝐴

This relationship was experimentally confirmed in previous studies [14,18], and
applied to a method to infer TCO from pupil position, yet without focusing on the
precision necessary to target single cones [19]. We here employ high-resolution eye
tracking to demonstrate that transverse chromatic offsets can be compensated in
real time to ensure cell sized precision during single cell psychophysical experiments
on cones of the central fovea or rods.

To map lateral eye position changes to transverse chromatic offset changes, we
employed an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) to measure
image-based retinal TCO [14] during controlled movements of the head and
simultaneous eye tracking. Following such calibration, eye tracking-based TCO
estimates were validated in a psychophysical experiment. A detailed description of
our AOSLO system is given in [20]. TCO calibrations were performed in fourteen
participants (9 female, 5 male) with no known vision abnormalities. Three
participants (1 female, 2 male) took part in the subjective experiments. Mydriasis
and cycloplegia were induced by instilling one drop of 1% Tropicamide 15 min
before the beginning of a session. For each participant, a holder fixed to a custom
dental impression (bite bar) was used to immobilize and control the position of the
head during imaging. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant
and all experimental procedures adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki, in accordance with the guidelines of the independent ethics committee of
the medical faculty at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität of Bonn.

2.1 Eye tracking camera
In order to accurately track the position of a subject’s eye in front of the AOSLO
beam, we mounted a video camera coaxially to the AOSLO imaging and stimulation
beams by means of a cold mirror (DMLP900L, Thorlabs) (Fig.1). The camera was a
752 x 480 pixel CMOS sensor (DMK 23UV024, The Imaging Source) with a 50 mm,
f/1.26 objective lens (TCL 5026 5MP, The Imaging Source). A central 640 x 480 pixels
subfield of the sensor was used in our custom eye tracking software. Camera focus
was set to a fixed working distance of 350 mm. By judging the sharpness of the
pupil image within the eye tracking user interface, eyes could be positioned at an
approximate distance coinciding with a conjugate pupil plane of the AOSLO beam.
Image magnification of the eye tracker was 0.030 mm per image pixel in the pupil
plane. As a result of back-scattered light from the imaging beam (7.2 mm diameter),
the camera captured an image of the retro-illuminated pupil on an otherwise dark
background (Fig. 1C, D). The imaging beam also produced a bright visible reflection
on the cornea front surface, the first Purkinje Image, referred to as Purkinje image
in the following. The bright image pixels of the Purkinje image were used to track
the eye's lateral location. Because of the coaxiality between camera and
illumination, we used the horizontal offset between the pupil’s center and the
Purkinje image to calculate the horizontal component of angle Kappa, κ, (the
angular subtense between visual and pupillary axis) as follows:
𝑃𝐼𝑥 − 𝑃𝐶𝑥
𝜅𝑥 = arctan (

PIx defined as the horizontal Purkinje image coordinate, PCx as the horizontal pupil
̅̅̅̅ as the distance from the entrance pupil to the
center coordinate, and 𝑃𝑁
Nodalpoint, which was assumed to be 4 mm [21]. The vertical component of Kappa
was calculated in the same way. Additionally, we calculated the Hirschberg ratio
(the inverse of the displacement of the Purkinje image from pupil center per degree
of eye rotation) in four participants during controlled gaze shifts. The average
Hirschberg ratio across four participants was 13.3 ± 0.7 °/mm, which corresponds to
an average ̅̅̅̅
𝑃𝑁 of 4.2 mm. The individual values of ̅̅̅̅
𝑃𝑁 were used to calculate the
participant’s Kappa more precisely and estimate TCO based on LCA and Kappa.

A custom C++ program based on previously described algorithms [22,23] was
written to display, track, and measure certain image features visualized by the eye
tracking camera (Fig. 1D). Each of the following metrics was computed for every

new frame with a refresh rate of 29.87 Hz. The pupil was fitted by a circle to
determine its center and diameter. The Purkinje image coordinate was specified by
the center of a second circle fit to the brightest pixels of the corneal reflection. Pixel
detection thresholds for the circle fits were adjusted manually at the beginning of
each session to ensure the best fits at the current image quality. To assist eye
alignment, an AOSLO beam indicator marking the perimeter of the imaging beam
was added. AOSLO beam position was captured at the beginning of every session
based on the camera image of a white paper illuminated by the imaging beam in
the pupil position. While running a TCO calibration sequence, all data was written to
a log file containing frame number, time stamp, pupil center coordinates, Purkinje
center coordinates, and pupil diameter.

A detailed description of the method to objectively measure TCO with an AOSLO is
given in [14]. In short, a video is recorded containing interleaved information of
both imaging and stimulation light channels (here, 840 nm and 543 nm) in a subfield
of the imaging raster (192 x 128 pixel). Images recorded in both channels were
spatially cross-correlated frame by frame to compute the positional shift between
the imaging light and stimulation light on the retina. Because this method is imagebased, it requires video footage with resolved retinal structure which can be a
limiting factor at the central fovea. As a side note, we observed that image structure
moved if the confocal pinhole in front of the light detector is moved. As a
consequence, TCO readings will change, although no changes occurred on the
retina. To control for this additional system-related chromatic offset, we centered
the confocal pinhole position on the beam’s point spread function by optimizing
image brightness and contrast ahead of each session.

To correlate image-based measurements of TCO to eye position changes, a 20 sec
dynamic calibration sequence was performed. During recording, the head (and
therefore the eye) was moved in a somewhat random pattern with an extent of
about ± 0.2 mm in each direction by manually turning the knobs of a XY micrometer
stage attached to the bitebar. Meanwhile, the participant fixated on a target
ensuring video acquisition of the same retinal location which was at ~0.4 degree
eccentricity. Reminiscent of a clapperboard in film industry, we modulated the
AOSLO beam through three quick full on and off cycles to flash the imaging beam at
the beginning and at the end of the recording, a signal which could be accurately
assigned to a single frame in both data streams. TCO video data and eye tracking

three steps (Fig. 2):

180

(1) Synchronization and interpolation: the two independent data streams were
synchronized based on the flash-sequence flagging “start” and “end” by
downsampling TCO data via linear interpolation - due to slightly differing framerates
(TCO: 30.00 Hz, Eye tracker: 29.87 Hz) - to assign an individual TCO data sample to
each Purkinje image position (Fig. 2A).

185
186
187
188
189

(2) Image noise removal: changes between consecutive TCO samples larger than 2
pixels (threshold determined empirically) were regarded as image noise and
removed from further analysis (Fig. 2B). Single samples with change rates below
threshold that lay in immediate neighboring blocks of samples flagged as noise
were also removed.

190
191
192
193

(3) TCO-tracking correlation: the linear regression of TCO and eye tracking data for
both horizontal and vertical component was computed and then used to estimate
TCO from eye position. The linear regression (for horizontal eye shifts) was in the
form of:
𝑇𝐶𝑂𝑋 (𝑃𝐼𝑋 )=m ∙𝑃𝐼𝑋 +b

where PIx is the Purkinje’s image X-coordinate, m and b are the slope and a

(Fig. 2C). The estimate for the vertical component was computed accordingly.

For an objective validation of our eye tracking-based TCO estimation, we
consecutively recorded 20 calibration sequences in one eye. We then used the
linear regression function found in the first sequence and compared the measured
TCO data at each eye position with the estimated TCO data by plugging in the eye
position data in the calibration function for all following sequences. This was
repeated for all 20 runs. Precision was estimated by using the x and y component of
each frame’s error as a coordinate in a two-dimensional displacement histogram.
Repeatability of the procedure was measured by comparing the TCO coordinates
across all 20 calibrations by solving equation 3 for a single (average) eye position.

We validated TCO estimation in a psychophysical experiment with three
participants. The participant’s task was to manually align their head in front of the
AOSLO beam such that the features of a two-color centroiding stimulus produced in
the AOSLO imaging raster were aligned. The stimulus feature offsets (a 2.3 arcmin
dot of 543 nm light shown within a black target within the 840 nm imaging raster)
were randomly chosen from sixteen offsets in a 4-by-4 grid with 0.4 arcmin spacing.
Each offset was presented 6 times, for a total of 96 trials of subjective alignments.
By the push of a button, the participant confirmed the correct alignment, the
current Purkinje image location was stored, and a new stimulus offset presented.
The predicted eye position based on the TCO calibration sequence and chromatic
stimulus offsets were compared with the actual eye position at each trial.

We performed TCO eye tracking calibrations in a total of 14 eyes, with multiple (320x) repetitions in all eyes, producing a total of 62 calibration sequences. We found
that in order to collect sufficient data points (of both, image-based TCO and eye
tracking data) during the 20 sec calibration, the most efficient head movement
pattern resembled a square or circle. Figure 3 shows four example calibration
sequences from three eyes with the produced raw data and subsequent regression
analyses. To review calibration success, three different metrics were displayed after
each calibration sequence, which also guided repeat decisions if a sequence had
failed (e.g. due to insufficient image quality):

(2) Eye movement extent in both horizontal and vertical direction given as distance

Percent samples used (U), range of data points (Q80) and goodness of fit (R2) are

When image quality decreased, the TCO computation algorithm produced an

ensure a reliable calibration, the percentage of used samples should exceed 33%.
The second metric, Q80, should exceed 0.3 mm in vertical and horizontal direction

Based on a chromatic model eye describing the relationship between LCA, TCA and
eye position [17], we expected the correlation between eye lateral position and
TCO to be linear (equation (2)). We found the slope, m, of the linear regression was
constant across eyes but different for horizontal and vertical shifts. Considering the
median slope of three consecutively recorded calibrations in each eye, the mean
slope for horizontal eye shifts was 3.55 ± 0.08 arcmin/mm and 3.43 ± 0.12
arcmin/mm for vertical eye shifts across subjects (Fig.4 A). By pairing horizontal and
vertical data for each eye, this difference was significant (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon signed
rank test). The absolute offset, b, of the linear regression was found to vary across
participants, reflecting an idiosyncratic component of TCA (Fig. 4B). Because we also
tracked the pupil’s center during calibration we could compute TCO values when
the pupil was computationally centered on the beam (Fig. 4C).

For a centered Purkinje position, individual TCOs were positioned close to each
other, with an extent of 0.8 arcmin from lowest to highest value for both
dimensions. The range of individual TCO values broadened when calculated for a
centered pupil: TCO values for the right eyes spread within a range of 1.5 arcmin.
TCO for the one left eye tested had the opposite sign, as expected. Finally, we
calculated angle Kappa for each participant (Fig. 4D) and found a strong correlation
between the TCO calculated for the centered pupil position and Kappa (Fig. 4E,F).
The linear regression of horizontal TCO with Kappa was defined by a slope of m = 0.22 arcmin/deg (R² = 0.98) and m = 0.18 arcmin/deg (R² = 0.75) for the vertical
dimension.

To estimate measurement error of our eye tracking based method, we compared 20
consecutively recorded calibration sequences of one eye with each other (Fig. 5).
The 0.9 quantile of the framewise calculated difference between estimated and
measured TCO was 1.04 pixel (0.10 arcmin) and 0.66 (0.07 arcmin) for horizontal
and vertical axis, respectively (Fig. 5A,B). Exceptions were single events presumably due to eye blinks or bad image quality - which could be as high as 2
pixel (0.2 arcmin) (Fig. 5B). By comparing each data set with each other in all
possible pairwise combinations disallowing redundancy, 190 error sets containing a
total of 88,266 error frames could be analyzed (Fig. 5C). As an estimate of precision
we calculated the area containing 95 % of all data points in a plot of positional error
in both spatial dimensions between estimated and measured TCO. The extent of
this area was ± 0.15 arcmin along the horizontal and ± 0.12 arcmin along the vertical

and a height of ± 0.05 arcmin. To analyze the repeatability of measurement, we first
determined the average eye position across all 20 calibrations. This value was
plugged in for each calibration function to calculate the TCO estimate for this
position (Fig. 5D). The standard deviation for these 20 TCO estimates was 0.022
arcmin on the horizontal and 0.024 arcmin on the vertical axis. Across the three
repeated calibrations in 14 participants we observed a median standard deviation
for absolute TCO estimates with a centered Purkinje image of 0.029 arcmin
(min=0.012; max=0.062) on the horizontal and 0.038 arcmin (min=0.013;
max=0.070) on the vertical axis (Fig. 4B).

Finally, a subjective validation experiment addressed the psychophysical
component of the TCO estimation. Three participants were asked to adjust their
head position in front of the AOSLO beams to align a centroid stimulus containing
controlled chromatic offsets (Fig. 6A). TCO estimation quality was assessed by
comparing the applied chromatic stimulus offset with the resulting TCO estimated
from the participant’s self-adjusted eye position (Fig. 6B). The average difference
between calculated TCO from estimation and the actual applied offset was 2.49,
2.96, and 2.95 pixel (0.25, 0.30 and 0.30 arcmin) for P1, P2, and P3, respectively.
Each participant showed an individual alignment strategy, resulting in clustering of
certain displacement offsets. When pooling data across participants, no systematic
direction for displacement errors was evident.

Here, we present a video-based eye tracking approach to estimate transverse
chromatic offsets (TCO) in an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope
(AOSLO) retinal microstimulator. The ultimate goal of this work was to compensate
system- and eye-inherent chromatic offsets with a precision enabling targeting and
stimulation of the smallest retinal photoreceptors, foveal cones and rods, without
the need of direct and continuous TCO measurement, while at the same time
allowing small head (and eye) movements to occur. By using a corneal reflection of
the AOSLO beam as eye position beacon, we achieved TCO estimation with low
noise, high repeatability and high spatial precision. We here discuss our principle of
Purkinje image based positional tracking, the relationship between transverse
chromatic aberrations (TCA), TCO, and the angle Kappa of the eye, and finally its
usability and application for single photoreceptor stimulation.

Many eye trackers use pupil coordinates such as its center to report absolute eye
position, and the pupil center has been shown to coarsely correlate with objective
measures of TCA [14,18,19]. For precise estimates of TCA, however, the location of
the TCA-inducing beams relative to the eye’s optics - and not its pupil - is more
relevant [24]. So far, correlations of pupil position with chromatic offsets were not
sufficiently accurate to allow for TCO compensation with photoreceptor
resolution [19]. We argue that the pupil center is not an appropriate proxy of TCO,
because the axis defined by the pupil center can shift with respect to the visual axis,
e.g. during pupil constriction and dilation [25]. Typical pupil trackers determine the
pupil’s center applying a circle fit, which is sensitive to errors because circularity of
the pupil changes with pupil size. Micro fluctuations of pupil size are abundant, and
the size changes dramatically during cycloplegia [26], a dynamic and reversible
situation which state is usually uncontrolled for during microstimulation
experimentation. In our approach, we use the first Purkinje image, the reflection of
the front surface of the cornea, of the AOSLO beam as the tracking signal for eye
translation changes. The location of this reflection depends on both the absolute
position of the eye relative to the light source and camera as well as the rotational
state of the eye. In relationship with the positional changes of the pupil center
during eye rotation, it can therefore also be used as a gaze signal [27].

In our setup, with a static camera coaxially aligned to the light source, lateral head
and eye shifts as well as rotation of the eye ball will move the Purkinje image.
Purkinje image movement caused by gaze shifts could induce an error in our TCO
estimation, because measures of TCO changes with retinal eccentricity [28]. Eye ball

rotation occurs in two different cases and in both cases we used the Hirschberg
ratio to estimate the magnitude of eye rotations induced errors. The individual
Hirschberg ratios of four eyes measured with our eye tracker were 12.2
degree/mm, 13.5 degree/mm, 13.6 degree/mm, and 13.7 degree/mm (average
13.3 degree/mm (data not shown here)), in good accordance with values found in
the literature [22,29]. In the first case, gaze changes occur due to the lateral head
motion during calibration while the participant maintains visual fixation of a static
visual target. Shifting the head by 0.4 mm in one direction will induce a rotation of
the eyeball of 0.05 degree. This angle will move the Purkinje image about 0.0038
mm or 1/10 of a pixel in the camera image, and is thus negligible. In the second
case, fixational eye movements during calibration or later compensation will shift
the Purkinje image with a ratio of about 2.5 pixel per degree of gaze shift. Hence, to
displace the Purkinje image by a full pixel the participant would have to rotate the
eyeball by 0.4 degree. Typical fixational eye movements such as tremor and drift
have an amplitude of about 0.01 degree, or 0.1 degree respectively [30]. Thus, only
microsaccades could move the Purkinje image with detectable amplitudes. Because
of the AOSLO’s inability to correct stimulus locations for the fast changes in retinal
location during a microsaccade, however, TCO compensation would not be needed
in that situation.

As hypothesized by a theoretical chromatic eye model, the relationship between
ocular TCA and small displacements of eye position (< 2 mm) ought to be linear, and
dependent on wavelength [15–17]. We found an average slope of 3.55 arcmin
horizontal TCO change per mm eye shift, and 3.43 arcmin/mm for vertical TCO. This
finding is in accordance with earlier reports (3 arcmin/mm, 3.5 arcmin/mm, and
3.86 arcmin/mm [14,18,19]), and matches the chromatic eye model, predicting a
slope of 3.44 arcmin/mm for a LCA of 1.00 diopter when 840 nm and 543 nm light is
used [15–17]. The residual variations we observed might be caused by individual
differences in LCA. In our group of 14 participants, the observed difference between
slopes of horizontal and vertical direction was significant, an observation which was
also found in a similar study [19]. Following equation (1), such difference could be
caused by differences in optical dispersion along the horizontal and vertical
dimension of the eye. Although this kind of dispersion anisometry has not been
reported before, it could be hypothesized that the dispersive characteristic of the
eye also differs between horizontal and vertical meridians, because curvature and
therefore refractive power of the cornea differs between those meridians [31,32].

We determined absolute TCO values in 14 participants with a centered Purkinje
image (due to the fact that our light source, visual axes and camera are all coaxially

aligned), and found values ranging within 0.6 arcmin along the horizontal and 0.8
arcmin along the vertical dimension. These ranges are clearly smaller than the
ranges of absolute foveal TCA estimation reported by previous studies: about 1
arcmin [24,28], 2 arcmin [15,33], 4 arcmin [17] and 8 arcmin [34]. In all these
studies, TCA was determined with a centered pupil. The range of absolute TCO for a
centered pupil position in our study spanned 1.4 arcmin and 1.6 arcmin for
horizontal and vertical dimension, including only right eyes. The closer range of
absolute TCO - including the single left eye - for a centered Purkinje position can be
explained by the fact that the foveal achromatic axis and the visual axis are closely
related [21], and that our eye tracking camera was aligned with the visual axis. The
remaining scatter could be caused by individual differences of the eye’s optics. The
reason for our observation that the TCO values with a centered Purkinje do not vary
around zero may be due to a minimal alignment difference between the imaging
and stimulation light in the light delivery path, or - since the TCO measurement is
image based - the IR and green detector positions.

To study the relationship between visual, pupillary and achromatic axes in more
detail, we also measured individual Kappa angles in all eyes. The measured TCO
values for a centered pupil where linearly correlated with Kappa (R² = 0.98 for
horizontal, R² = 0.75 for vertical Kappa). This finding supports the chromatic eye
model, where TCA is correlated with the angle Psi ψ (defined by pupil displacement
and nodal point distance from the entrance pupil, like Kappa, here) [15,17]. This
experimental confirmation has important implications for all ophthalmic
applications where TCA is wished to be measured or corrected. First, we confirmed
that the slope, m, of TCA per pupil displacement can be directly derived from
individual LCA values of the eye. Second, if beams are centered in the pupil, a
precise measurement of Kappa can be a direct measure for foveal TCA, once their
relationship has been established in the system used, determining the offset b
(equation (3)). We tested this in four participants, by recalculating Kappa for the
individual Nodalpoint distance obtained from the participant’s Hirschberg ratio. In
that situation, where the TCO estimation function based solely on Purkinje image
and pupil center data, we would have made an average error of 0.13 ± 0.04 arcmin
for horizontal TCO and 0.14 ± 0.07 arcmin for vertical TCO. Thus, only if a spatial
precision on the order of single cones of the central fovea and rods is desired, a
direct calibration as presented here would be required. Other applications like
functional testing of pathologic areas of the retina in patients where direct TCO
measure is unfeasible or unsuitable due to the high light intensities could utilize real
time TCO compensation, simply by determining Kappa [7,8].

One of the important goals of the eye tracking based estimation of TCO was to
increase estimation precision up to single foveal cone level. The cones of the central
fovea are the smallest photoreceptor cells of the retina with an inner segment
diameter of about 30 arcsec [35] comparable to the diameter of rods. With
increasing eccentricity, cones increase in diameter with the result that positional
errors caused by a participant’s residual head movements become more negligible
(Fig. 7). Typically, participants show individual amounts of residual head shifts. We
determined in a few observers that, during experiments with a static TCO
compensation method, where TCO is measured before and after an experiment
without any ongoing monitoring, stimuli can be displaced up to 2 arcmin (Fig 7, top
row). To visualize the impact of our proposed TCO compensation method, the
precision of ± 0.15 arcmin determined here for our system was used to exemplary
shift the target position on a retinal image due to noise of the ongoing
compensation. For an experiment targeting individual cones of the central retina or
rods, a maximal positional error of a single pixel, or 6 arcsec, is tolerable - a
requirement that is met by about 75% of the TCO compensated positions. At 0.4
degree eccentricity, positional errors up to 12 arcsec would be acceptable. This
criterion was met for all (100%) estimated TCO values in our study. Additionally,
variability across three consecutively recorded calibrations in 14 tested participants
fell well within 0.1 arcmin, which was lower than the observed single frame
measurement noise (Fig. 4B and 5).

In the subjective validation experiment, participants made an average error of 0.30
arcmin, corresponding to twice the objectively determined precision, and smaller
than the expected Nyquist limit of 0.43 arcmin for a foveal cone density of 200,000
cells/mm² [36], but slightly higher than the typically found average Vernier acuity of
0.19 arcmin [37] and 0.25 arcmin [38]. Because we did not observe any systematic
displacements across the three participants, we conclude that the subjective
validation confirmed the current calibration process. However, comparable to other
eye tracker setups, we plan to include a brief subjective validation routine of the
calibration before running single cell stimulation experiments to detect systematic
mismatches between subjective and estimated TCO. These small chromatic offsets
could occur, for example, due to alignment changes in the AOSLO setup.

As a practical note, for compensation of TCO during microstimulation experiments,
we currently implemented a per-trial approach. Because our eye tracking software
is a standalone solution, its data has to be transmitted to our stimulation software,
which is run in a Matlab environment. Purkinje image coordinates were sent from
the eye tracker software to Matlab on request, triggered by the participant’s

keystroke that also triggers stimulation presentation. The delay of this
communication was measured by means of timestamps, and did not exceed
30 msec. Based on the calculations shown above, we disregard the amount of gaze
shifts for this period of time. The average head shift within a 30 msec window
across all our calibration sequences was 0.006 mm, resulting in a TCO glitch of
0.02 arcmin due to transmission delays introduced by the software interface.

In summary, the demonstrated eye tracking method seems a viable solution to
estimate and compensate chromatic offset in real time within a fraction of arcmin,
necessary for adaptive optics microstimulation of the smallest photoreceptors of
the retina. Furthermore, we experimentally confirmed the fundamental relationship
between angle Kappa and TCA, which could be a convenient implementation in
applications where TCA is wished to be compensated but cannot be directly
measured.
