ABSTRACT
Intractable aggressive behaviour is a devastating behavioural disorder that reach 30% of
psychiatric aggressive patients. Neuromodulatory surgeries may be treatment alternatives to reduce
35

suffering. We investigated the outcomes of bilateral amygdala radiofrequency ablation in four
patients with intractable aggressive behaviour (life-threatening-self-injury and social aggression) by
studying whole brain magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data. Post-surgery assessments
revealed decreases in aggression and agitation and improvements in quality of life. Aggressive
behaviour was positively correlated with serum testosterone levels and the testosterone/cortisol ratio

40

in males. No clinically significant side effects were observed. Imaging analyses revealed
preoperative amygdala volumes within normal range and confirmed appropriate lesion locations.
Reduction in aggressiveness were accompanied by volumetric reduction in brain areas associated
with aggressive behaviour (express genes related to aggressive behaviour), and increases in regions
related to somatosensation. These findings further elucidates the neurocircuitry of aggression and

45

suggests novel neuromodulation targets.

INTRODUCTION
Excessive aggressive behavior is highly prevalent in patients with Autism Spectrum
50

Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID)1. It presents a major obstacle to patient care and
treatment2. Additionally, it often presents as severe self-injurious behavior that may culminate with
the need for chronic restraining of patients, substantially reducing quality of life 3,4. The primary
treatment for excessive aggressive behavior involves the use of behavioral therapy and medications
that act mainly on dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems 1,5. When patients fail to respond to

55

conventional behavioral and medical treatments, high dose mono- or polypharmacy strategies are
indicated6. Although these therapies are successful in most patients, there is a significant subset of
individuals (approximately 30%) who do not adequately respond to treatment and are considered
medication-refractory7.
Structures related to the control of aggressive behavior include the prefrontal cortex,

60

amygdala, hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray8. It is believed that aggressive
individuals have alterations in these structures. Prior research suggests that higher limbic system
activity alters perception of provocative stimuli, and reduces “top-down” control of the prefrontal
cortex, minimizing the ability to suppress aggressive behavior 8. Lesion studies performed in the late
18th and early 19th centuries have shown that the removal of the temporal lobes or selective

65

amygdala ablation resulted in marked reduction of aggressive behavior in humans 9–11 and nonhuman
primates12,13. Imaging studies have been largely controversial and/or inconclusive in asserting an
association between amygdala volume14 or activity15 and behavioral disorders (including aggressive
behavior).

For example, veterans with aggressive behavior disorders have been shown to

demonstrate a more intense amygdala response to external stimuli as well as an attenuated
70

amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity15,16. In contrast, studies in criminal psychopaths have

reported that the level of amygdala activation is lower during processing of negative affective
stimuli, fear conditioning paradigms, and emotional moral decision making17,18.
More recently, amygdala deep brain stimulation (DBS) was successfully used to reduce
aggressive behavior (life-threatening self-injurious behavior) in a drug-refractory autistic teenager 3.
75

Quite often, however, patients with severe self-aggressive behavior towards the face and head are
precluded from DBS consideration for fear of complications such as infection, skin erosion, and
lead fracture19. For this small population of non-responsive individuals, stereotactic ablative surgery
targeting the amygdala has been performed with beneficial result 11,20. As this patient population is
small and the number of recent publications are limited, in depth clinical follow up and the study of

80

neuroanatomical and/or functional aspects of this surgery remain sparse. In particular, to date, no
study has attempted to identify and characterize the brain morphology and changes associated with
surgical intervention in these subjects.
We addressed the crucial gap in understanding the aggressive brain circuitry and how
structural and functional changes in this network relate to behavior changes by studying

85

longitudinal local volume and structure changes throughout the whole brain and examining the
clinical and hormonal effects of bilateral amygdala radiofrequency ablation in a small cohort of
patients with aggressive behavior.

RESULTS
Behavior assessments demonstrated a marked reduction in aggressive behavior in all
90

patients (p01: 84.6%; p02: 80%; p03: 88.9%; p04: 56.2%; p(cor)<0.01; Figure 1E). This was
associated with a reduction in motor agitation (p (cor)<0.05; Figure 1F) and an increase in quality of
life (p(cor)<0.01; Figure 1G). Significant correlations were found between improvements in
aggressive behavior and agitation (p<0.0001) and between improvements in aggressive behavior
and quality of life (p=0.01612; Supplementary Figures 1A-B).

Each total amygdala volume was measured before the surgical procedure and was
determined to be within normal range21 (Figure 1A-D). After surgery, we confirmed the location of
the lesion and measured its size. As shown in Figure 1D, lesions were smaller in volume than the
amygdala. P01, p02 and p04 required a second procedure, after which most of the amygdala was
ablated.

100

The ratio between testosterone and cortisol is a biomarker for aggressive behavior 22. We
identified a positive correlation between aggressive behavior and the testosterone/cortisol ratio in
the males (p(cor)<0.01, Figure 1H; p01 p=0.0205; p02 p=0.0243; p03 p=0.0334; p04 p=0.315;
Supplementary Figures 1D-G) and between aggressive behavior and total testosterone, also only in
the male patients (p=0.00101; p01p=0.0142; p02 p=0.0584; p03 p=0.0247; p04 p=0.8059,

105

Supplementary Figures 1C and 2H-K). Although some fluctuation in the hormone levels occurred,
there was no significant clinical impact on patients well-being (Supplementary Table 1).

The longitudinal DBM analysis of these patients (Figure 2) identified significant
morphological changes in several brain regions. Volumetric decrease was found in many areas,
115

including those known to play a role in mechanisms of aggressive behavior (e.g. doroslateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST)) 8,23.
Volume increases were observed in areas involved in somatosensory processing and pain perception
(e.g. somatosensory cortex, thalamus)24. Supplementary Figure 2 illustrates the volume change in
those and other main regions. Table 1 lists and names the key peaks passing FDR correction

DISCUSSION
140

Stereotactic surgery led to a remarkable reduction in aggressive behavior and improvements
in quality of life in patients with medically-refractory aggressive behavior. To assess potential
therapeutic mechanisms for the procedure, MRI images acquired before and after the surgery were
analyzed using DBM, and FA and MD maps computed. While the DBM technique uses image
registration to calculate local deformation fields at a voxel level for the detection of morphological

145

variations25, FA and MD values are indicative of local microstructural characteristics primarily
related to white matter. FA is an index of diffusion asymmetry and is related to characteristics such

as fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination, while MD shows the degree of displacement of
water molecules26.
We found that morphological changes associated with reduction in aggressive behavior
150

could be grouped into two clusters: Cluster 1 includes areas associated with aggressive behavior
such as the DLPFC, NAcc, BNST, Insula, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and dorsal raphe nucleus
(DRN). Cluster 2 regions includes areas related to somatosensation and pain perception, such as
somatosensory cortex, thalamus, and anterior Cingulate Cortex. The correlation of volumetric
changes with DWI measures suggests that the volume change following surgery is related to local

155

microstructural changes. Though the exact mechanism driving these distinct changes remains
unexplained (e.g. increase/decrease of number of glial cells, hypo- or hypertrophy of neurons), it is
interesting to note the clusters change in opposite directions. Areas of cluster 1 receive alert signals
from the presumably hyperactive amygdala8 and decrease in volume once the amygdala stimulation
ceases. Whereas, activity in the regions of cluster 2 are suppressed when the amygdala is highly

160

activated and increase in volume post-surgery. The distinct pattern of local changes throughout the
somatosensory/pain network is particularly intriguing in this group and may explain the reduction in
self-aggressive behavior observed after surgery (OAS self-injury subscale change: p01: 4 to 1;
p02:1 to 0; p03: 4 to 0; p04: 4 to 2). It is known that the amygdala has a central role in processing
nociceptive27 stimuli and that patients with self-injurious behavior have altered pain perceptior28.

165

Thus, amygdala ablation could affect this neurocircuitry, restoring normal activity in areas related to
the process of nociceptive stimuli resulting in reduction of self-injury behavior.
The correlation found between aggressive behavior and agitation supports the theory that
excessive aggressive behavior occurs when the amygdala is hyper-activated and more responsive to

and communication. In this sense, the procedure appears to leads to significant behavioral
improvement which enables patients to function in a social construct that fosters further behavioral
improvement. Although permanent side effects and worsened behavioral problems have been
175

previously reported9,11,19, an important aspect of our study was that no noticeable side effects were
observed after surgery.
The gene ontology analysis found that Cluster 1 regions are related to steroid metabolic
process, response to Nitric oxide and Amphetamine, aminergic neurotransmitter transport, and
interestingly, regulation of grooming behavior. These all are closely related to the amygdala and

180

aggressive behavior: Grooming behavior is similar to aggressive behaviors in the sense that it is an
innate social behavior influenced by the amygdala, which plays an important role in social bonding
and the maintenance of species29. The aminergic neurotransmitter system (e.g. serotonin and
dopamine) as well as nitric oxide and amphetamine have all been implicated in the modulation of
aggressive behavio5,30,31The mechanism for this effect, however, is still unknown. Steroid

185

metabolism is a process linked to aggressive behavior and is influenced by the amygdala via
extensive bi-directional projections to and from the hypothalamus. This latter structure is
responsible for controlling hormonal production and secretion including precursors of the synthesis
of testosterone and cortisol32. These two hormones are part of internal feedback loops of the
amygdala resulting in the expression of more aggressive actions (consequence of testosterone

190

augmentation) or increased fear responses (consequence of cortisol predominance). It is believed
that the ratio between those two hormones may be a biomarker for aggressive behavior 22. In fact,
this is reinforced by the correlation found between testosterone and the testosterone/cortisol ratio
and aggression.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of longitudinal neuroimaging analyses of patients

195

treated with bilateral amygdala radiofrequency ablation. DBM analyses enabled the detection of
subtle local volumetric changes throughout the brain and helped us identify numerous local

structural alterations that accompany the behavioral changes. We observed consistent characteristic
changes within our patients and we believe that this analysis better elucidates the whole human
neurocircuitry of aggressive behavior and provides new insights for future interventions. All the
200

changes result in striking behavior alterations leading to easing of suffering and improvement in
quality of life. The changes essential and necessary for the positive outcome are yet to be
elucidated. Expounding these connections through future research could be instrumental in deriving
a better understanding this complex neurocircuitry as well as its mechanism in modulating behavior.
Our results, however, suggest an interesting starting point to investigate possible new targets for

205

intervention. For example, one could propose the use of non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques
(e.g. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS))
delivered to somatosensory cortical areas or DBS to the NAcc or BNST, for the treatment of
patients with excessive aggressive behavior. Furthermore, these results highlight the need for
studies to ascertain the cause of morphological changes, identify the population of neurons being

210

affected, and explore the impact of these changes on neurotransmitter systems, especially in the
context of the aminergic system.
In summary, our results provide novel evidence that bilateral amygdala ablation induces readaptation of the neurocircuitry that controls aggressive behavior, with a concomitant behavioral
phenotype. These morphological changes could be integral to the reduction of aggressive behavior

215

and increase in quality of life observed in our study population. Further research is necessary to
better understand this complex neurocircuitry and explore new targets for therapeutic interventions
and less invasive techniques.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
SUBJECTS

220

Four patients with intractable aggressive behavior (3 males, 1 female; aged 19-32 years;
demographics in Table 2) were included in the study following psychiatric referral from our
outpatient psychiatric clinic. All subjects were diagnosed with severe ID and the 3 males also with
ASD. All patients showed uncontrollable life-threatening-self-injurious behavior and extreme
aggressive behavior towards their surroundings and others. Three patients required restraint

225

measures on a daily basis. The subjects were selected for the ablation procedure as their severe selfaggressive behavior made them non-eligible for DBS 19. An experienced multidisciplinary team
assisted the patients and caregivers at all times. Patients’ psychiatric histories are presented in
Supplementary Text 1. Criteria for patient selection and for defining treatment refractoriness
followed the mandate for conducting psychiatric surgery stipulated by the Regional and Federal

230

Medical Councils. All study procedures, logs, and results were documented and archived in
accordance with the Research Ethical Board (#CAPPesq742.331; #CAAE31828014.6.3001.5461).
The patient’s parents provided written informed consent after being instructed about potential risks
and benefits of surgical treatment. The study was registered as a clinical trial at
https://clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT03452878).

PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE EVALUATIONS
Preoperative assessment involved full clinical, psychiatric, and neurosurgical evaluations as
well as whole brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Questionnaires quantified aggressive
behavior, general motor agitation, and quality of life with the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS),
Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), and Short Form Survey (SF-36), respectively. Laboratory tests

240

included: thyroid, kidney, and liver function, adrenal and gonadal hormone levels; lipid,
coagulation, and inflammation profiles; and complete blood count (Supplementary Table 1). Since
patients presented with severe intellectual disability, neuropsychological evaluations were deferred.
Postoperative follow up included all preoperative measures and was performed at 3, 12, 24
and 36 months after surgery. Patients p01, p02 and p04 needed a second surgery 24 months after the

245

first to increase lesion size, characterized on imaging as well as by minimal symptomatic benefits.
Their follow-up was indexed from the date of the first operation. Supplementary Figure 5 illustrates
the study timeline.
SURGERY
The surgeries were completed under local anesthesia and sedation. Following a preoperative

250

MRI, a Leksell stereotactic frame (Elekta AB, Sweden) was applied to the patient’s’ head and a
stereotactic computed tomography was obtained. Imaging data was transferred to the iPlan®

Stereotaxy software (Brainlab - Feldkirchen, Germany) for calculation of optimal tridimensional
coordinates for the inferior and superior aspects of the proposed lesion, as well as for the entry point
and trajectory of the radiofrequency probe. A two millimeter straight probe was introduced though a
255

twist drill burr hole in the coordinates of the inferior aspect of the lesion, medial part. A radio
frequency lesion was then applied at 80°C for 90 seconds. The probe was adjusted three millimeters
laterally, and a second lesion was placed, followed by a third and fourth lesion at the superior
coordinates. This procedure was repeated for the contralateral amygdala. Figure 5 illustrates probe
placement.

mm voxel, b=1000, 36 directions, 3 b0 images) were acquired. Images were resampled to 0.5mm
isotropic voxels for Deformation Based Morphometry (DBM) analysis. The Fractional Anisotropy
(FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) maps were computed at native resolution and then coregistered
270

with the resampled T1-weighted images resulting from the DBM analysis.
IMAGE PROCESSING
Presurgical amygdala volume and post-surgical lesion size were estimated using Amira® 3D
(FEI Houston Company, USA). For the remaining analysis, amygdala lesion and area of the probe
entry were excluded. T1-weighted images were non-uniformity corrected and skull-stripped33. To

275

capture changes in local brain morphology, we used DBM, a technique based on image registration.
Image registration produces transformations that map every point in one image to its corresponding
point in another image. Thus, it allows for detection and quantification of anatomic differences. In
this sense, longitudinal changes were evaluated by DBM using the ANTs toolkit
(http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/; ‘antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2.sh’)33 for linear and non-

280

linear registration in a 2 level registration procedure where we first registered all images of the
same subject to one another to detect within subject changes occurring over time – the critical
variable of interest for the analysis of the lesion effect.
In a second registration, we registered the subject averages to one another to achieve voxel
correspondence to compare the local individual changes across the group of subjects. Local

285

volumetric changes of each voxel within each image are captured in the Jacobian of the deformation
from the image registration, and have been shown to be sensitive to anatomical changes within the
brain without requiring a priori segmentation25. Especially within-subject longitudinal DBM has
been shown to be capable of detecting small local brain changes 34. The Jacobians were calculated
within each subject, transformed to the group average and smoothed using a 2 mm gaussian 3D

290

kernel.

DWI images were analyzed using the MRtrix package (J-D Tournier, Brain Research
Institute, Australia, https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3)35. Raw images were first corrected for

distortions and motion36 within each acquisition, and then denoised 37 before calculating the
diffusion tensor. FA and MD maps were then computed from the diffusion tensor. To achieve local
295

correspondence between the DWI and the DBM measures, the individual DWI images were
coregistered with the corresponding individual T1-weighted images and mapped onto the group
average of the DBM analysis. FA and MD maps were subsequently blurred using a 2 mm gaussian
3D kernel. Local MD and FA values were extracted in regions that showed significant local volume
changes to investigate the possible microstructural changes.

300

STATISTICS
The RMINC (https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/RMINC) package in RStudio
(version 3.3.3, https://www.r-project.org/) was used for statistical analysis. A linear mixed-effect
model was performed. To test changes over time and the relationship between behavior and
hormone evaluation we used a linear mixed effect model with subject as random effect.

305

For imaging analysis, the model tested local change at every voxel over time with the three
timepoints as ordered factor as fixed and patient and random effect. T- statistics for linear and
quadratic trajectories of change across time were calculated at each voxel and corrected for multiple
comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR). The level of significance was set at q<0.05 (whole
brain FDR-correction) for all DBM analyses. To investigate possible patterns in the DBM results, a

310

hierarchical clustering analysis was performed. The input was a cross correlation matrix, where
element (x,y) describes the correlation of computed Jacobians between region x and region y across
all 4 subjects. The agglomerative clustering algorithm from sci-kit learn (http://scikit-learn.org/)
was used with ward linkage criterion. In this method, each observation (i.e., vector of correlations)
starts as its own cluster before clusters are successively merged together based on their similarity.

Maps of volumetric change were used to identify regions of interest (ROI) for inside/outside
genetic enrichment analysis of areas that grew or shrunk significantly over time compared to the
rest of the brain using the Allen Institute human gene expression data 38 (© 2010 Allen Institute for
Brain Science. Allen Human Brain Atlas. human.brain-map.org).T-stat maps were thresholded at |t|
>2.66 (q<0.1 whole brain FDR corrected; this threshold is necessary to get a more expansive spatial

320

map of volumetric changes to colocalize with brain areas included in the Allen brain atlas). The
well locations used for the Allen gene atlas were registered to common space and each well location
was given a spatial extent of a sphere with radius 2mm. T-stat maps were registered to common
space, binarized, and a mixed effects linear model with Age and Sex as fixed effect covariates as
well as Allen subject ID as a random effect covariate were used to compare the genetic expression

325

inside versus outside the binarized map. Inside versus outside gene significance was then adjusted
for multiple comparisons using bonferroni correction (p cor<0.05) sorted and split for positive and
negative t-statistics (genes enriched versus underexpressed within versus the rest of the brain).
Finally the ranked gene orders were used as inputs for gene enrichment analysis using the
Gorilla39 and GEAS40 tools.
