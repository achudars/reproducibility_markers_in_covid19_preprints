Abstract:

25

Growth hormone (GH) had direct effects on the glomerular podocyte. Increased levels of GH

26

are implicated in the pathogenesis of renal abnormalities in acromegaly and in diabetic

27

nephropathy in Type 1 diabetes mellitus. We investigated the role of Transforming growth

28

factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in GH’s effects on the glomerular podocyte. Exposure of podocytes to GH

29

resulted in elevated expression of TGF-β1 and was concurrent with increased phosphorylation

30

of SMAD2/3 and nuclear accumulation of SMAD4. Conditioned media from podocytes exposed

31

to GH also triggered SMAD signaling. Podocytes treated with GH showed increased

32

permeability to albumin. Mice injected with GH demonstrated increased kidney size, glomerular

33

hypertrophy, and proteinuria. The renal manifestations in GH injected mice were associated with

34

increased TGF-β1 expression and activation of TGF-β1 signaling pathways. Concurrent

35

administration of TGF-β receptor antagonist (SB431542) with GH abrogated these renal effects

36

of GH administration. These results reveal the role of TGF-β1 in GH’s actions on the glomerular

37

podocyte and provide a novel mechanistic basis for GH-induced glomerular dysfunction in

38

clinical conditions such as diabetes and acromegaly.

Introduction:

46

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by an array of structural and functional aberrations

47

in the nephron. Structural changes include podocyte hypertrophy, glomerular sclerosis, and

48

thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The functional manifestations include

49

a transient increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria ranging from

50

microalbuminuria to overt proteinuria. The magnitude of proteinuria reflects the extent of

51

damage to the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), which consists of endothelial cells, basement

52

membrane and podocytes [1]. Podocytes are the specialized cells that offer epithelial coverage

53

to renal capillaries and serves as a final barrier to curb the loss of protein into the urine. Injury to

54

the podocytes including hypertrophy, foot process effacement, and epithelial-mesenchymal-

55

transition (EMT) that eventually culminates into reduced podocyte count [2]. However, the

56

molecular signals that initiate these podocyte abnormalities remain incompletely understood.

57

Elevated growth hormone (GH) levels in poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is

58

implicated as a causative factor in the development of renal aberrations and proteinuria in DM

59

[2-4]. GH transgenic animals developed significant renal hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis [5].

60

Although certain biological effects of GH are mediated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the

61

glomerular hypertrophy and significant renal manifestations are evidenced in GH transgenics

62

with IGF-1 null background [6], suggesting that IGF-1 is not necessary for these effects of GH

63

on the glomerulus. In GH transgenic animals, podocytes undergo hypertrophy while mesangial

64

and endothelial cells undergo proliferation [6]. GH administration enhanced the effects of

65

streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on renal hypertrophy in rats [5]. Conversely, mice with

66

mutant GHR were protected from STZ-induced diabetic renal complications [7]. Similarly, in

67

animal models, somatostatin analogs (lanreotide and octreotide) that decrease GH secretion

68

offered substantial protection against DN [8]. Long-term treatment of acromegaly patients with

69

somatostatin analogues prevented GH-induced renal alterations [9]. This evidence argues for a

70

strong association between elevated GH levels and renal aberrations. Our earlier studies

71

identified that podocyte as a direct target for GH action and our subsequent studies

72

demonstrated that GH regulates expression of Smad interacting protein (SIP1) and transforming

73

growth factor β interacting protein (TGFBIP, also known as Bigh3) in podocytes [10-12].

74

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a master regulator of ECM turnover that is secreted

75

from most cell types in the body. Three TGF-β isoforms have been identified among which

76

isoform 1 (TGF-β1) has been associated with the pathophysiology of DN. Earlier studies

77

implicated TGF-β1 as a central molecule responsible for the excess deposition of ECM proteins

78

in diabetes [13]. Both mRNA and protein levels of TGF-β1 are significantly elevated in DN

79

patients [14, 15]. Studies from experimental diabetic animals further substantiated the role of

80

TGF-β1 in the pathogenesis of DN [16]. Neutralizing TGF-β1 with anti-TGF-β1 antibodies

81

reversed the established type II diabetic renal injury [17]. In the present study, we provide

82

evidence to substantiate the hypothesis that GH’s effect on the glomerular podocyte is

83

transduced via the TGF-β/SMAD pathway. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for GH’s

84

actions on the glomerular podocyte

(SA Biosciences).

97

Animal experiments and animal care: Swiss-albino mice were purchased from the National

98

Center for Laboratory Animal Sciences (NCLAS, NIN, Hyderabad). All experimental group

99

animals were maintained under 12hr day and night cycles throughout the experimental

100

procedure. After acclimatization animals are grouped into three groups: control, GH, GH+SB.

101

On day fifth of acclimatization, the GH group received intraperitoneal injections of GH (2mg/kg

102

body weight/day) and the GH+SB group received intraperitoneal injections of SB431542

103

(1mg/kg body weight/day) 1h prior to the GH treatment. All animals were sacrificed on day 14th

104

post GH treatment, perfused with PBS and internal body fixation achieved by 4% PFA

105

(paraformaldehyde). The kidneys were collected and one kidney was used for histological

106

analysis and the other kidney was used for molecular signaling studies. Institutional Animal

107

Ethics Committee of University of Hyderabad approved the animal protocols.

108

Cell culture and treatments: Immortalized human podocytes were gifted by Prof. Moin Saleem

109

(University of Bristol, UK) cultured in 10% serum containing media prepared in RPMI 1640 with

110

1% antibiotic-antimycotic at 33ºC under 5% CO2. After cells reached 70% confluence, the cells

111

were transferred to 37ºC and maintained for 6-8 days for differentiation. Differentiated

112

podocytes were used for all treatments. Cells were serum starved in glucose-free RPMI media

113

for 24hr before being treated by human GH. All treatments were performed in serum and

114

glucose-free media. Before treating cells with GH or TGF-β1, cells were treated with SB431542

115

for 24h in serum and glucose-free medium.

116

Preparation of conditioned media: Differentiated podocytes were treated with or without GH

117

(500ng/ml) for 30 min. Subsequently these podocytes are thoroughly washed with RPMI1640

118

media to remove trace of GH and then cultured in fresh serum free RPMI1640 media, which

119

was collected 30 min later (Conditioned media). The conditioned media from GH-treated (CM-

120

GH) and untreated (Con-CM) podocytes were centrifuged 6000xg for 5 min to remove cell

121

debris and resulting supernatant was further purified with 0.2 μm membrane filters. Fresh batch

122

of differentiated podocytes were treated with Con-CM or GH-CM for 30 min to assess activation

123

of SMAD signaling or treated for 12 h for assessing morphological parameters.

124

SDS-PAGE & Western Blotting: Unless otherwise mentioned, 10% SDS-PAGE gels were

125

used in this study. Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer and protein estimation was

126

done using Bradford standard method. Equal amounts of protein were loaded and gels were run

127

at 100 volts for 2hrs or until the dye was released. Western blotting was performed using

128

standard methods at 200mA for 1hr at 4oC and PVDF membrane was used for all western

129

transfers. Blots were incubated with the respective primary antibody for overnight at 4oC before

130

being incubated with respective secondary antibody for 1hr at room temperature. Blots were

131

developed using the ECL substrate employing Bio-Rad Versa Doc 5000 MFP and results were

132

analyzed in Image Lab and band intensities were quantified in Image J software developed by

133

NIH, Bethesda.

134

Immunohistochemistry: Paraffin-embedded tissues were processed into 6µm sections using a

135

Leica systems microtome. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with ethanol

136

from 100% to 50%. Peroxidase blocking and permeabilization were performed in 30% H2O2 for

137

25 min at room temperature. Antigen retrieval was done in Tris-EDTA-Tween buffer in the micro

138

oven (three cycles of five minutes with intervals of two minutes). Blocking was performed in 5%

139

BSA in PBS for 1hr at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary antibody for two

140

hours followed by two washes with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody either with

141

fluorescent tagged or HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugate. Sections were developed using

142

DAB stain and counterstained with hematoxylin. All washes are done with PBS. Sections were

143

dehydrated and mounted with DPX mounting media.

144

Immunofluorescence: Immunofluorescence was performed according to a previous protocol

145

[12]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min on a glass coverslip and permeabilized

146

with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15min at room temperature. Blocking was performed with 5% BSA in

147

PBS for 1hr and primary antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution. Cells were mounted with prolong

148

gold antifade with DAPI (Molecular Probes, #P36941). All washes are done with PBS. Imaging

149

was done in a Leica Microsystems trinocular or Zeiss confocal microscopy.

150

SMAD4-GFP Reporter Assay: SMAD4-GFP reporter assay was performed in HEK293T cells

151

according to the earlier published protocols with minor modifications [18]. In a 96 well plate,

152

6X103 cells/well were seeded prior to the day of transfection. Cells were transfected either with

153

SMAD4-GFP, positive control and negative control vectors in triplicates. After transfection cells

154

were left untreated in complete medium for 16h, followed by serum starvation for 12h. The cells

155

were then treated with TGFβ, GH CM or GH in serum-free medium. After 16h of treatment,

156

images were taken in Olympus 5000 fluorescence microscope and the fluorescence emission

157

spectrum from 510-520nm recorded by exciting at 488nm. Fluorescence values were plotted

158

after normalizing with mock test control values.

159

Transient transfection: All transient transfections were performed according to the

160

manufacturer protocol. 95% confluent HEK293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine

161

2000, Invitrogen. After 6hr of transection, cells were briefly washed with PBS and incubated in

162

10% serum containing media for 24hr followed by which all treatments were performed in

163

serum-free medium.

164

ELISA: Cells were serum starved in glucose-free RMPI 1640 medium for 24h under standard

165

culture conditions. Cells were treated with GH 250 and 500ng concentrations in the starvation

166

medium (not supplement with glucose) for 30min. Briefly, dead cells were removed from the cell

167

supernatants by centrifugation at 16000g for 10min at 4oC and the supernatants were passed

168

through 0.2µm membrane filters. The resultant supernatants were directly subjected to the TGF7

169

β1 activation procedures as the manufacturer’s protocol. Activated samples were assayed by

170

indirect sandwich Elisa kit (R&D systems # DB100B).

171

Paracellular albumin influx assay: Albumin influx assay was performed in podocytes as per

172

published methods [11]. 1.2X105 cells per well were seeded on to the top chamber of a 6-well

173

insert. The wells of the six-well plate were filled with 6ml of RPMI complete medium and

174

incubated under permissive conditions for 24h. Then cells were shifted to 37oC and incubated

175

for 6-8 days for differentiation into mature podocytes before being serum starved for 24h and

176

the indicated treatments applied to the cells. After 48hr of treatment, cells were washed with

177

PBS supplemented with 1mM MgCl2 and 1mM CaCl2 to preserve cadherin junctions. Then, six-

178

well plates were filled with 6ml of 40mg/ml BSA containing serum-free RPMI medium and the

179

top chamber filled only with 0.7ml of RPMI. After incubation, a small aliquot of a medium from

180

the top chamber was collected to measure BSA influx from bottom to top chamber and

181

concentration assessed by the BCA protein assay method.

182

Statistics Analysis: Data are presented as standard error mean (SEM) unless otherwise

183

indicated. Graphpad Prism 8 software was used to analyze statistical differences between the

184

distributions of two (Unpaired non-parametric-Mann Whitney test) or multiple independent

185

samples (Tukey’s Multiple comparison test), respectively. P≤0.05 was considered as significant.

GH induces TGF-β1 and the cognate TGF-β-SMAD pathway in human podocytes:

189

Considering both the central role of podocytes in glomerular permselectivity and the established

190

role of TGF-β1 in increasing podocyte permeability, we investigated the direct action of GH on

191

the TGF-β/SMAD pathway in human podocytes. We observed that GH (100-500 ng/ml) induces

192

TGF-β1 protein levels in human podocytes as analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig 1A&B). Since

193

TGF-β1 is a secretory molecule, we next estimated TGF-β1 concentration in conditioned

194

medium from GH treated podocytes. GH increased TGF-β1 concentration in both a dose (250

195

and 500 ng/ml) and time (0-60 min) dependent manner (Fig 1C&D). Furthermore, GH also

196

increased phosphorylation of SMAD2&3 in podocytes (Fig 1E&F). These results indicate that

197

GH induces expression of TGF-β1 and activation of TGF-β1 down-stream signaling in

198

podocytes.

199
200

GH induced TGF-β in podocytes acts in both autocrine and paracrine manner: TGF-β1 is

201

known to act in a both autocrine and paracrine manner. To elucidate the paracrine action of GH

202

induced TGF-β1, we treated podocytes with GH and collected conditioned media. Conditioned

203

media from GH-treated podocytes induced phosphorylation of SMAD2&3 in podocytes naïve to

204

GH (Fig 2A). This suggests the possibility of GH-dependent secretion of TGF-β1 into the

205

conditioned media, which then elicited activation of SMAD2&3. TGF-β dependent regulation of

206

its target genes requires the interaction of SMAD4 with SMAD2&3 and the localization of the

207

SMAD2/3/4 complex to the nucleus. We observed increased accumulation of SMAD4 in the

208

nucleus following treatment with GH or conditioned media from GH-treated podocytes (Fig 2B).

209

We next performed TGF-β neutralization studies with podocytes transfected with a GFP

210

expression plasmid under the control of SMAD binding element. Both, GH and conditioned

211

media from GH treated podocytes induced GFP expression in this model (Fig 2C). However,

212

conditioned media from GH treated podocytes that were pre-incubated with anti-TGF-β1

213

antibody failed to induce GFP expression (Fig 2C&D). Furthermore, to verify that observed

214

effects of GH on activation of SMADs is mediated via GH-dependent secretion of TGF-β1 in

215

podocytes; we employed the TGF-βR1 inhibitor, SB431542 (hereafter named as SB). SB is a

216

small molecule that targets the TGF-β signaling pathway by competing for ATP binding domains

217

in the ALK5 (TGF-βR1) receptor [19]. SB treatment significantly reduced the TGF-β1 levels in

218

GH treated podocytes as measured by ELISA (Fig 3A) and immunoblotting (Fig 3B). In addition,

9

219

we observed reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2&3 (Fig 3C) and decreased nuclear levels of

220

SMAD4 (Fig 3D) in podocytes treated with GH and SB. We next sought to study the functional

221

consequence of GH-dependent expression of TGF-β1 and down-stream activation of SMAD

222

signaling in podocytes using a paracellular albumin influx assay. Podocytes treated with GH

223

showed increased permeability to albumin across a podocyte monolayer (Fig 3E). Interestingly,

224

treatment with SB abrogated the observed effect of GH on podocyte permeability (Fig 3E).

225

Together, these data from either direct treatment with GH or from conditioned media from GH-

226

treated podocytes demonstrate that TGF-β1 induced by GH acts in a both autocrine and

227

paracrine manner to activate SMAD signaling, which results in increased podocyte permeability.

228
229

GH alters podocyte morphology and regulates expression of ECM components in

230

podocytes: GH treated podocytes show increased cell size compared with podocytes naïve to

231

GH (Fig 4A). Similar to GH, TGF-β1 also induced an increase in podocyte cell size (Fig 4A).

232

Changes in the structural organization of the actin cytoskeleton usually accompany changes in

233

cell size. Profiling of F-actin polymerization in podocytes by Phalloidin staining revealed that

234

both TGF-β1 and GH increased F-actin polymerization in podocytes (Fig 4B&C). TGF-βR1

235

inhibitor (SB) attenuated GH induced increase in podocyte cell size (Fig 4B&C). Cell

236

morphology is also influenced by its interactions with ECM proteins and TGF-β1 is known to

237

play a critical role in ECM turnover. Next, we found increased expression of extracellular matrix

238

molecules in podocytes exposed to GH or TGF-β1 compared with cells naïve to these

239

molecules (Fig 4D&E). Increased expression of ECM proteins in podocytes correlates with

240

increased thickening of GBM observed in mice injected with GH (Fig 4D&E Vs. Fig 6A&B).

241

Activation of TGF-β/SMAD pathway in GH injected mice: To delineate the in vivo effect of

242

GH on TGF-β in the podocyte we administered GH to mice for two weeks. Compared with

243

control mice, GH injected mice had higher kidney (mg) to body weight (g) ratio (7.2 Vs. 8.46)

244

and increased glomerular size (Fig 5A&B). Histological analysis of kidney from GH injected mice

245

revealed mild to moderate renal fibrosis, mesangial expansion, and synechiae formation

246

between bowman’s space and glomerular tufts (Fig 5C). There was also a significant decrease

247

in GFR in GH injected animals (Fig 5D). Analysis of podocyte architecture by transmission

248

electron microscopy revealed disruption of podocyte foot-processes and thickening of GBM (Fig

249

6A&B). Urine from GH administered mice has higher albumin to creatinine ratio (UCAR, Fig 6C)

250

and more abundance of high molecular weight proteins (Fig 6D) compared with control mice.

251

These results demonstrate that GH induces glomerular hypertrophy, alterations in podocyte

252

morphology, and impairment of renal function as evidenced by increased UCAR and decreased

253

GFR.

254

We conducted further analysis to understand the mechanism for the glomerular hypertrophy and

255

proteinuria in mice administered with GH. TGF-β1 levels were elevated in platelet poor plasma

256

preparations from GH injected mice (Fig 7A). Furthermore, glomerular lysates from GH injected

257

mice revealed an increased abundance of TGF-β1 protein (Fig 7B&C). Immunohistochemistry

258

analysis demonstrated increased expression of TGF-β1 in both glomerulus and renal tubule (Fig

259

7D). Increased phosphorylation of SMAD2&3 was also observed in glomerular lysates from

260

mice administered with GH (Fig 7E). These results suggest that TGF-β1 mediates effects of GH

261

on the glomerular podocyte.

262
263

TGF-βR1 inhibitor attenuates GH induced renal anomalies: In order to ascertain that the

264

observed GH-dependent glomerular injury is specifically due to TGF-β1, we employed the TGF-

265

βR1 inhibitor (SB) in our further studies. SB administration ameliorated alterations in kidney

266

(mg) to body weight (g) ratio in GH injected mice (7.9 Vs. 8.4) Administration of SB to mice prior

267

to the GH injection prevented the increase in TGF-β1 levels induced by GH injection (Fig 8A).

268

SB treatment also alleviated the GH-induced glomerular hypertrophy and increases in

269

glomerular tuft area (Fig 8B&C) and resulted in decreased activation of SMAD2&3 (Fig 8D).

270

Furthermore, SB treatment improved proteinuria in the GH-administered animals (Fig 8E).

271

These results support the hypothesis that TGF-β1 mediates effects of GH on the podocyte and

272

that inhibition of TGF-βR1 could prevent certain GH mediated adverse effects on the podocyte

273

and the glomerulus and the podocyte.

274
275

Discussion:

276

The current investigation reveals a novel mechanism for GH action on glomerular podocytes

277

and in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. The major findings of this study are that GH

278

induces TGF-β1 and the canonical TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway in glomerular podocytes.

279

GH impairs podocyte permeability as measured in paracellular albumin influx assay and the

280

inhibitor of TGF-β1R ameliorated this effect. GH induces glomerular hypertrophy, accumulation

281

of ECM proteins, and proteinuria in mice whereas inhibition of TGF-β1 receptor prevented GH-

282

induced degenerative changes in the kidney and improved proteinuria.

283
284

Transient renal hypertrophy, podocyte hypertrophy, and glomerulosclerosis are hallmarks of

285

diabetic kidney disease. Elevated levels of GH were implicated in the early renal hypertrophy

286

and proteinuria in type I diabetes [20]. GH transgenic mice also showed significant podocyte

287

hypertrophy [6]. A direct relationship was established between the activity of the GH/GHR axis

288

and renal hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis [6]. In our earlier study, we reported the presence

289

of GHR and activation of canonical JAK/STAT signaling in podocytes [12]. However, it was not

290

clear whether this causal role of the GH in the pathogenesis of renal hypertrophy and sclerosis

291

in conditions such as acromegaly and DN is due to direct actions of GH on the podocytes or via

292

GH’s effector molecules. Among several host of mediators in the diabetic milieu, TGF-β1 has

293

emerged to have a key role in the development of renal hypertrophy and accumulation of ECM

294

proteins via both stimulations of matrix synthesis and inhibition of matrix degradation. Several

295

lines of evidence revealed TGF-β1’s role in morphologic manifestations and clinical

296

characteristic of DN [13, 20]. Despite knowing the fact that TGF-β/SMAD pathway activation is

297

crucial in most of the kidney diseases, the stimuli that activate the TGF-β/SMAD pathway in the

298

podocyte remain unclear. Previous studies proposed that high glucose and angiotensin II

299

induces TGF-β1 expression in mesangial cells, however, in the podocytes, angiotensin II does

300

alter TGF-β expression. Although, elevated GH levels and overactivity of GH/GHR axis is

301

implicated in renal manifestations and CKD [2, 4] the temporal association between GH and

302

TGF-β is unclear. It is noteworthy that GH-induced mild glomerulosclerosis and interstitial

303

fibrosis in diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats is associated with an elevation in TGF-β1 levels [5] and

304

suppressing JAK2, an immediate downstream target of GH reduced TGF-β mRNA expression

305

[21]. In the present study, our results establish that GH stimulates expression of TGF-β1 in

306

podocytes and to best of our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate GH induces TGF-

307

β1 expression. TGF-β1 is secreted from cells as a biologically inactive large latent complex

308

(LLC) [22]. LLC is composed of a family of latent TGF-β binding proteins (LTBP) that binds

309

covalently to TGF-β and facilitate efficient secretion and targeting TGF-β to the ECM. In our

310

earlier study, we reported that GH regulates expression of TGFBIp (TGF-beta interacting

311

protein, also known as BigH3), which is a member of the LTBP complex [10]. Hence, GH

312

increases TGF-β1 mediated renal effects by both increasing TGF-β1 and by regulating the

313

bioavailability of TGF-β1.

314
315

TGF-β family proteins are secreted proteins and elicit pleiotropic actions on target cells. Our

316

study suggests GH-dependent secretion of TGF-β1 elicits its action in a both autocrine and

317

paracrine manner. TGF-β1 binds and activate heteromeric complex (type I and II) of

318

transmembrane receptors. Upon binding with the ligand, type II receptor, which is a

319

constitutively active kinase phosphorylates the type I receptor. Activated type I receptor kinases

320

phosphorylate two serine residues in the “SSXS motif” of receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs;

321

SMAD2&3). Phosphorylation enables the formation of heteromeric complexes between

322

SMAD2&3 and one common-SMAD, SMAD4, and translocation of the entire complex to the

323

nucleus [23]. We demonstrated GH-dependent activation of R-SMADs and localization of

324

SMAD4 in the podocyte nucleus. Nuclear translocation of SMAD4 is dependent on

325

phosphorylation of SMAD2&3 that form complex with SMAD4. Both direct exposure of

326

podocytes to GH and GH-conditioned media induced GFP expression from a transfected

327

plasmid containing GFP controlled by a putative SMAD4 binding element. The former actions

328

support autocrine action and later indicate paracrine action of TGF-β1. Furthermore, pre-

329

treatment of GH-conditioned media with TGF-β1 neutralizing antibodies abolished the potential

330

of GH-conditioned media to activate SMAD4. It is noteworthy that podocytes exposed to GH-

331

conditioned media that are prior exposed to TGF-βR1 inhibitor (SB) reduced the

332

phosphorylation of SMAD2&3. SMAD4 nuclear translocation also was prevented by treatment

333

with SB. These observations are congruent with the diminished levels of TGF-β1 in the

334

podocytes exposed to GH and SB. Our study also demonstrates that perturbing the TGF-

335

βR1/SMAD pathway by SB prevented GH-mediated renal manifestations in mice suggesting the

336

autoregulation of TGF-β1. Our observation is supported by an earlier study where administration

337

of neutralizing TGF-β antibodies decreased the total production of TGF-β [22]. GH induces the

338

expression of ZEB2 (also known as Smad Interacting protein, SIP1) [11]. ZEB2 binds tightly to

339

activated RSMADs (SMAD2&3) and regulate Smad-mediated transcription even when ZEB

340

binding sites are absent from a target gene [24]. Together the data suggest GH regulates TGF-

341

βR1/SMAD signaling at multiple levels.

342

Our study indicates that TGF-β1 elicits reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in

343

podocytes. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells and offer epithelial coverage to the

glomerular basement membrane. Neighboring foot-processes of podocytes are tethered by a

345

modified tight-junction known as slit-diaphragm (SD) that forms the major filtration-barrier at the

346

blood-urine interface. Podocyte foot-processes composed of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore

347

actin cytoskeleton plays a vital role in normal biology of the podocyte and reorganization of the

349

glomerulosclerosis and progressive kidney failure [25]. TGF-β1 induced reorganization of the

350

actin cytoskeleton and abnormal functioning of SD suggests a mechanistic link between

increased permeability to albumin across podocyte monolayer. Concomitantly, mice injected

352

with GH showed elevated TGF-β1 levels, effacement of podocyte foot-processes and

proteinuria. The validation of our hypothesis and the decisive role of TGF-β1 in transducing

The results of the current study demonstrate that GH’s role in the pathogenesis of

nephropathy is at least in part is mediated by TGF-β1. A proposed model for GH and TGF-β1

axis is glomerular podocytes is depicted in Fig 9. However, further studies are required to

359

delineate the contribution of specific STATs in GH mediated TGF-β1 production. Based on our

360

observations, we propose that GH induces TGF-β1 expression and it could be implicated as a

361

causative factor in the development of renal hypertrophy, ECM accumulation, podocytopathy,

362

and proteinuria during GH-induced kidney diseases. In summary, the present report establishes

363

that GH induces TGF-β1 expression in podocytes and that some of the actions of GH on the

364

podocytes are mediated through TGF-β1 in a both autocrine and paracrine manner. Our data

365

provide a mechanistic link between GH and podocyte dysfunction in diseases like type I

366

diabetes mellitus and acromegaly.
