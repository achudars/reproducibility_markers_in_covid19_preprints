ABSTRACT
Reliable approaches to identify stem cell mechanisms that mediate aggressive cancer could have
great therapeutic value, based on the growing evidence of embryonic signatures in metastatic
cancers. However, how to best identify and target stem-like mechanisms aberrantly acquired by
cancer cells has been challenging. We harnessed the power of reprogramming to examine
GRP78, a chaperone protein generally restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum in normal tissues,
but which is expressed on the cell surface of human embryonic stem cells and many cancer types.
We have discovered that (1) cell surface GRP78 (sGRP78) is expressed on iPSCs and is
important in reprogramming, (2) sGRP78 promotes cellular functions in both pluripotent and
breast cancer cells (3) overexpression of GRP78 in breast cancer cells leads to an induction of a
CD24-/CD44+ tumor initiating cell (TIC) population (4) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells are enriched
for stemness genes and appear to be a subset of TICs (5) sGRP78+ breast cancer cells show an
enhanced ability to seed metastatic organ sites in vivo. These collective findings show that GRP78
has important functions in regulating both pluripotency and oncogenesis, and suggest that
sGRP78 marks a stem-like population in breast cancer cells that has increased metastatic
potential in vivo.

INTRODUCTION
Accumulating evidence has shown the presence of embryonic stem-cell programs in cancer cells
that contribute to aggressive malignancy [1-3]. Previous work has also demonstrated that
common pathways critical in oncogenesis parallel many pathways important in the induction of
pluripotency [4-6]. Recently, a group using machine learning found an increased stemness index
in metastatic tumors across many cancer types [7]. A study using single-cell analysis specifically
correlated a stem-cell program to human metastatic breast cancer cells, expanding on the existing
paradigm that pairs stem cell programs with disease aggressiveness [8]. These findings support
the concept that an embryonic program may be aberrantly retained and/or reactivated to be
exploited in cancer. Thus, examining pluripotent stem cells in relation to cancer could provide a
powerful approach to gaining insight into critical mechanisms regulating aggressive tumors.
Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78; also known as heat shock 70 kDA protein 5, HSPA5) is a
stress inducible endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein that is part of the larger heat shock
protein superfamily. GRP78 is typically localized in the ER to assist in the protein folding and
assembly of membrane or secreted proteins [9]. GRP78 overexpression has been observed
clinically for many different cancer types, where it has been shown to correlate to metastasis and
poor patient outcome [10, 11]. These findings are supported by genetically engineered mouse
models and tissue culture systems, which have also shown roles for the overexpression of GRP78
in malignancy [12], invasive and aggressive phenotypes [13, 14], metastasis [15], and drug
resistant properties [16]. Previous reports indicate that GRP78 is aberrantly localized to the cell
surface in many types of cancer (e.g. breast, pancreas, lung, ovarian, colon, melanoma) [11, 17],
where it has been linked to the regulation of critical signaling pathways [18-22].
We have previously reported that GRP78 is expressed on the surface of human embryonic stem
cells [20]. Furthermore, Spike et. al. found functions for cell surface GRP78 in fetal and adult
mammary stem/progenitor populations [22]. These collective findings suggest that aberrant
cancer functions of GRP78 may be revealing an embryonic function of GRP78 that is
inappropriately reactivated and exploited, or that adult stem cells could be retaining certain
embryonic mechanisms of GRP78 that then become aberrant. In this study, we examined the
functions of GRP78 in breast cancer and in the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency,
which revealed important insights into understanding how cancer cells acquire and/or exploit
embryonic stem cell mechanisms.
RESULTS
To examine the role of GRP78 in regulating the acquisition of an embryonic stem cell state, we
first modified GRP78 expression levels during reprogramming. Knockdown of GRP78
(Supplementary Figure S1) during reprogramming of human fibroblasts following the transduction
of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC (referred to as 4F) led to a significant decrease in the number
of iPSC colonies present, as judged by expression of the pluripotent marker NANOG in the
resulting colonies (Figure 1A). Conversely, overexpression of GRP78 (Supplementary Figure S1)
in conjunction with 4F led to a significant induction of iPSC colonies (~2.5 fold), and in the absence
of cMYC (referred to as 3F) during reprogramming, an even greater increase (~4-fold) compared
to controls (Figure 1B, 1C). When fibroblasts were ‘primed’ with overexpression of GRP78 two
days prior to being transduced with the 4F to induce reprogramming, the increase was 6-fold
(Figure 1D). To examine GRP78 expression after reprogramming, we stained induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) with GRP78 and the cell membrane protein E-cadherin [23]. Our results show
that GRP78 is co-expressed with E-cadherin on the cell surface of iPSCs, in agreement with our

previous findings of GRP78 on the cell surface of human embryonic stem cells [20] (Figure 1E).
These results indicate that GRP78 plays an important role in the reprogramming process, and
that GRP78 is expressed on the cell surface of iPSCs.
Cell surface GRP78 (referred to herein as sGRP78) on cancer cells has already emerged as a
potential chemotherapeutic target [11], but the potential cell surface function of sGRP78 in human
pluripotent stem cells remained unknown. We found that GRP78 relocalization appears by the 12 cell stage of reprogramming (Figure 2A), suggesting that the presence of sGRP78 is an early
event in the acquisition of pluripotency. When using a GRP78 antibody, that has previously been
reported to disrupt sGRP78 function [20], or matched IgG control at different stages during
reprogramming, the efficiency of reprogramming was inhibited (Figures 2B and 2C). The kinetics
of antibody treatment and the effects on colony number suggested that sGRP78 functioned during
the reprogramming process (Figure 2C). GRP78 antibody treatment at later stages, when
colonies were already present, did not statistically affect colony number (Figure 2C). However, if
the inhibitory GRP78 antibody treatment at later stages (i.e. after colony development) was
causing a reduction in colony size (i.e. causing some of the cells to die and/or differentiate), this
would not be indicated by only measuring colony number. Therefore, to next examine the function
of GRP78 on the cell surface of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we treated PSCs that
express GFP under the control of an OCT4 promoter [24] with the inhibitory GRP78 antibody.
Treatment of PSCs with this antibody decreased PSC number, but did not impact pluripotency of
the remaining population, as judged by OCT4-GFP expression levels (Figure 2D). Thus, the loss
of PSCs from inhibiting sGRP78 was not due to differentiation, and instead was likely due to
survival and/or proliferation mechanisms. Cell cycle analysis of PSCs following GRP78 antibody
(or IgG control) treatments demonstrated that the cell cycle was not changing (Figure 2E). Thus,
coupled with the lack of differentiation, this suggests that sGRP78 is important in maintaining PSC
cell survival. Interestingly, inducing GRP78 overexpressing in the human basal (i.e. ER-/PR/Her2-) breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 caused an increased resistance to the
chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (Figure 2F). The ability of GRP78 to regulate breast cancer cell
survival was also cell surface dependent, since inhibiting cell surface function of GRP78 with the
inhibitory antibody to GRP78 resulted in a higher susceptibility to cisplatin treatment (Figure 2F).
Importantly, this resistance or changed susceptibility with GRP78 antibody was not seen in the
absence of GRP78 overexpression, or when inducing overexpressing of a GFP control
(Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).
Although sGRP78 shared similar functions on stem cells and cancer cells, whether or not sGRP78
expression was marking and/or affecting a stem-like subpopulation within breast cancer remained
unclear. To begin to analyze the potential role of sGRP78 expression in stemness in cancer, we
performed experiments with the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 (luminal A subtype [25]) and MDAMB-231 (basal subtype [25]) that contain low or high levels of previously defined CD24-/CD44+
tumor initiating cells (TICs) respectively, a cell population with breast cancer cells shown to be
able to generate tumors with much higher efficiency in in vivo xenograft transplantation assays
[26]. Interestingly, overexpression of GRP78 in both breast cancer cell lines caused an induction
of the TIC subpopulation (i.e. CD24-/CD44+ cells) [26] (Figures 3A and 3B). Overexpressing
GRP78 also induced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A), a marker
associated with stemness and cancer [27] (Supplementary Figure S4).
To next compare sGRP78 populations to the previously established TIC populations, we first
examined the cell surface expression of GRP78 relative to the CD24-/CD44+ population. We
focused on MCF7 cells, since they express low numbers of TICs compared to MDA-MB-231
(Figures 3A and 3B), thus enabling differences between the various populations to be better
examined. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the sGRP78+ cells were a

subpopulation within the TIC population (Figure 3C). Furthermore, GRP78 gene expression
levels were higher in TICs (Figure 3D), in agreement with previous reports [28]. Thus, if previous
studies have identified that TIC subsets mark a heterogeneous but potentially enriched stem-like
population, is it possible that sGRP78 expression marks a subpopulation of ‘purer’ stem-like cells?
To test this question, we sorted sGRP78+ cells and CD24-/CD44+ cells from MCF7 by
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), isolated RNA, and performed gene expression
analysis of a panel of stem-cell related genes [29] (Figure 3E). Expression of stem genes were
increased in the TICs compared to the Non-TIC population (CD24+/CD44+), as expected (Figures
3E and 3F). Strikingly, however, mean collective gene expression analysis demonstrated that
sGRP78+ cells showed a higher overall expression of stem genes, even compared to the TIC
population (Figure 3F). Thus, our combined results suggest that sGRP78+ cells contain higher
levels of key genes important in stem cell functions, and are a subset of a previously established
TIC population in breast cancer cells (Figure 3G).
To determine if sGRP78+ cells had functional relevance, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays
of tumorigenic potential. TICs isolated from MCF7 cells showed an increased ability to generate
colonies in anchorage-independent soft agar assays compared to Non-TIC controls, as expected
(Figure 4A). The number generated from sGRP78+ isolated cells was even more pronounced,
showing a statistically significant higher number of colonies than TICs. Furthermore, the colonies
generated from sGRP78+ cells were bigger in size than both TICs and Non-TIC controls (Figure
4B). Since the in vitro assays suggested that the sGRP78+ population had an increased
tumorigenic potential, we next examined the tumorigenicity of this population in vivo. TIC or
sGRP78+ sorted cells, or total MCF7 cells (which served as a control as they contain low levels
of both TIC and sGRP78+ populations) were fluorescently labeled, and intracardiacally injected
into immunodeficient mice. The presence of fluorescent cells in known sites of breast cancer
metastasis (e.g. lung, brain) was examined at both 2 days after injection (to determine the ability
of each population to ‘seed’ to organ sties of metastasis), and 1 month (to determine the ability of
each population to generate tumor growths at metastatic sites). We found that while total MCF7
cells and previously established TICs were able to ‘seed’ to the lung and brain within 2 days after
injection, sGRP78+ cells showed a dramatically enhanced ability to seed the lungs and brains of
mice (Figures 4C and 4D). Similarly, after 1 month, the sGRP78+ cells continued to show an
increased ability to generate tumors in both lung and brain (Figures 4E and 4F), Furthermore,
when examining the lungs of each mouse group after 1 month, the colonization architecture of
sGRP78+ populations was substantially larger than TIC populations (Figure 4G), suggestive of a
more aggressive behavior. These collective findings suggest that sGRP78 marks a stem-like
population in breast cancer cells that has increased metastatic potential in vivo.
DISCUSSION
GRP78 can act both as an ER-chaperone to assist in protein folding, and at the cell surface where
it has been linked to the regulation of critical signaling pathways. The ER-chaperone function of
GRP78 is ubiquitous, but many studies have reported elevated levels of GRP78 in various
cancers [11]. The expression of GRP78 at the cell surface (i.e. sGRP78) has been restricted in
vivo to cancer cells [11], and stem cells - specifically a subset of hematopoietic stem cells [30],
fetal and mammary stem cells [22], and human embryonic stem cells [20]. Thus, we sought to
investigate, are the “aberrant” functions of GRP78 reported in cancer actually the repurposing of
stem cell functions of GRP78? Here we report that GRP78 is important in somatic cell
reprogramming, in pluripotent stem cell and breast cancer cell functions, and in promoting tumor
initiating cell populations within breast cancer. Furthermore, our data also shows that sGRP78
marks a subpopulation within breast cancer that has elevated expression of genes important in

stem cell functions, and increased tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. These collective findings
support the concept that the aberrant cancer functions of GRP78 could represent embryonic
functions of GRP78 that have been inappropriately retained/reacquired and exploited in cancer
cells to help facilitate their aggressiveness.
We first examined GRP78 in somatic cell reprogramming. Inhibiting total GRP78 levels in somatic
cells during reprogramming reduced reprogramming efficiency, in support of the important role
for GRP78 in early embryogenesis [31]. Conversely, overexpressing GRP78 levels during
reprogramming increased reprogramming efficiency. It is of interest that elevated levels of
GRP78 can contribute to an increase in reprogramming, especially in light of the increase in
GRP78 levels that have been reported for many tumor types [11]. When paired with the fact that
increasing GRP78 levels led to an increase in TIC populations in breast cancer cells, this suggests
the intriguing possibility that GRP78 may facilitate the acquisition and/or promotion of a stem-like
state in breast cancer cell populations. The fact that TIC populations increased dramatically within
a short time-frame (e.g. 3 days after GRP78 induction in MCF7 cells) suggests that GRP78
overexpression most likely leads to a proliferative advantage of TIC cells. Nevertheless, it is
possible that GRP78 induction can also influence cell fate, and that both mechanisms are
contributing to this phenotype. Further experimentation requiring genetic cell fate mapping would
be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities. Either way, it is interesting that
overexpressing GRP78 leads to both an increase in the number of somatic cells that acquire
pluripotency, and an increase in a previously identified breast “cancer stem cell” population [32,
33].
We next examined cell surface functions of GRP78 in in the acquisition and maintenance of
pluripotency, and in breast cancer. We found that treatment with an antibody that interferes with
cell surface function of GRP78 inhibited both reprogramming efficiency, and pluripotent stem cell
and breast cancer cell functions, supporting a cell surface signaling function of sGRP78 in
mediating these effects. Further examination of sGRP78 cells within breast cancer revealed that
they represented a subset of cells that show a significant increase in genes important in stem
cells, and are a subset of a previously identified breast cancer TICs (i.e. a “cancer cell stem cell”
population). Strikingly, sGRP78+ cells demonstrated a significant increase in in vitro and in vivo
tumorigenicity, suggesting that sGRP78 helps mediate aggressive functions of breast cancer
cells.
Previous reports indicate that GRP78 is aberrantly localized to the cell surface in many types of
cancer where it has been linked to the regulation of critical signaling pathways [11, 20, 21].
However, as GRP78 is thought to exist majorly as a peripheral protein [34], there have been a
number of diverse cell surface binding partners reported for GRP78 that facilitate its activation of
downstream signaling cascades, including but not limited to a2M [35], Cripto [20, 22], Par-4 [36]
and Kringle 5 [37]. The type of response mediated by sGRP78 is influenced by binding partner,
and can also vary depending on the cell type [34]. The preferential surface expression of GRP78
on cancer cells in vivo and correlations to poor prognosis and overall metastasis and
aggressiveness makes it an attractive chemotherapeutic target. However, without insight into the
specific GRP78-dependent mechanisms that are responsible for mediating cancer cell growth
and metastasis, it will be difficult to determine how to best target GRP78, or to determine the
testing parameters by which to develop the best therapeutic options. Our collective findings
support the concept that embryonic mechanisms of GRP78 may be aberrantly retained and/or
reactivated in aggressive breast cancer. Ongoing studies from our laboratory are examining the
molecular mechanisms by which GRP78 is mediating these effects in both PSCs and cancer. It
is our expectation that by focusing on the specific embryonic mechanisms of GRP78 utilized by
cancer, this will reveal the specific GRP78-mediated mechanisms that lead to the most aggressive

cancer outcomes, and that this information will be critical in focusing future therapeutic targeting
of sGRP78 in a clinical setting.
METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and 293T cells (all obtained from ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human neonatal
keratinocytes (Lonza) were grown according to manufacturer's recommendations. dFib-OCT4GFP
fibroblast cells [29] were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS. Pluripotent stem cells were grown
in mTeSR-1 on matrigel as previously described [38, 39]. FiPS4F5 cells [40] and dFib-OCT4GFPiPSC cells [29] have been reported previously. For experiments utilizing doxycycline-inducible
treatments, cells were treated with 1µg/ml of doxycycline for the times indicated. In cases
requiring GRP78 antibody treatments, GRP78 N-20 antibody (SantaCruz) or relevant goat IgG
control (SantaCruz) were used at the concentrations indicated. For both doxycycline and antibody
treatments, in cases where multiple days of treatment were required, cells were treated daily with
new media containing fresh drug or antibody treatments.
Plasmid construction and viral production
Retroviral reprogramming plasmids (on pMX backbone) have been described previously [41]. For
generation of pMX-GRP78 plasmid, cDNA fragments of GRP78 obtained from pcDNA3-GRP78
[20] were digested with EcoRI, purified and subcloned into EcoRI-linearized pMX plasmid. For
viral production, pMX plasmids were cotransfected with packaging plasmids pCMV-VSVG and
pCMV-gag-pol-PA as previously described [41].
shRNA (pLVTHM-shScramble and pLVTHM-shGRP78) was generated as previously described
using pLVTHM plasmid (shGRP78 sequence: CCATACATTCAAGTTGATA) [29]. Lentivirus was
produced by cotransfecting pLVTHM plasmids with packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G as
previously described [29].
For RFP-GRP78 fusion into pLV-FU-tetO plasmid [29], first tRFP was amplified from pTRIPZ
(Addgene) using the forward primer (5’-CACCACCGGTATGAGCGAGCTGATCAAG-3’) and
reverse primer (5’-CTCGAGTCTGTGCCCCAGTTTGCT-3’) and the fragment was subcloned into
pENTR/D-TOPO using TOPO cloning (pENTR/tRFP). Next, it was digested with XhoI and the
fragment of flag-GRP78 [20] was amplified using the forward primer (5’GGGGCACAGACTCGAAATGAAGCTCTCCCTGGTG-3’)
and
reverse
primer
(5’CCCACCCTTCTCGAGCCTAACAAAAGTT-3’) and subcloned into XhoI-site of pENTR/tRFP with
In-Fusion system (pENTR/tRFP-flag-GRP78). The tRFP-flag-GRP78 fragment was amplified with
forward primer (5’-GCTTGATATCGAATTCTAACAAAAGTTCCTGAGTCCA-3’) and reverse
primer (5’-CCGCGGCCCCGAATTCTAGGCCACCATGAGCGAGCTGATCAAGGAG-3’) from
pENTR/tRFP-flag-GRP78 and subcloned into the pLV-FU-tetO vector with In-fusion system. To
generate lentivirus pLV-FU-tetO plasmids were cotransfected with packaging plasmids (pMDL,
Rev and VSVg) as previously described [29],
Reprogramming analysis
Keratinocytes (Lonza) or dFib-OCT4GFP were infected with equivalent ratios of retroviruses
encoding OSKM (and where indicated with a parallel pMX-GFP control) as previously described
[41]. Cells were either replated onto MEFs (Millipore) (keratinocytes) or plated onto Matrigel (dFibOCT4GFP) in their respective media, and then were switched to ES cell medium for iPSC colony
formation as previously described [29, 41]. Resulting iPSC colonies were stained for Nanog ∼20

days after infection as previously described [41]. Reprogramming efficiencies were then
determined by calculating the number of Nanog positive colonies as a percentage of GFP positive
cells.
RNA isolation and Gene Expression Analysis
RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using iScript Reverse
Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. qRT
mastermixes were made using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad),
according to manufacturer’s recommendations, and qRT was done in a 96-well 7500 Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Data was analyzed using Excel and R via the DDCT method
standardized to an internal control. Stem cell primers were chosen based on a previously
established stem cell array (http://www.sabiosciences.com/rt_pcr_product/HTML/PAHS405A.html) and are as previously described [29]. Each replicate was compared to its own 18S
control, and then compared to its own sorted control population. Following this, the normalized
data was averaged across all experiments to determine the mean normalized expression values
for each gene in each population. Boxplots and heatmaps were made from the mean normalized
or normalized values. All statistical analysis was done using R and plots made using ggplot2.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
Cells were grown on glass coverslips until desired confluency and then were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes (min) at room temperature (RT). Cells were permeabilized with
cold 0.1% Triton-X/PBS for 15 min at RT and then blocked with cold 2% FBS/PBS for 30 min at
RT. Primary antibody was diluted into 2% FBS/PBS and cells were incubated O/N at 4C. Following
washing cells were incubated with secondary antibody in 2% FBS/PBS for 2 hours at RT. Finally,
the cells were incubated with DAPI diluted in PBS for 10 min at RT and washed before being
mounted onto slides with Vectashield Hard Set (Vector Laboratories). Single-planed images were
taken on a Nikon C2 confocal microscope using a 40X oil-immersion lens, and figures were
arranged using Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. All fluorescent images shown within a figure were
acquired with the same exposure time.
MTT Assay
Cells were plated in a 96-well plate before being treated daily with media only, or media containing
doxycycline and/or GRP78 N-20 antibody or IgG control. The cells were next treated with cisplatin
at the concentrations and times indicated. Following incubation, the media was aspirated from
the cells and replaced with 50uL of fresh media containing 0.5mg/mL Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium
Bromide (MTT) reagent (Sigma) per well. The cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees.
After incubation, 150 uL of DMSO was added to each well and mixed to completely dissolve the
solution. Absorbance was measured in plate reader at 570nm.
Flow Cytometry and FACS
MCF7 cells were grown on 10cm plates until complete confluency. Cells were harvested (using
EDTA/PBS; Invitrogen) and aliquoted into individual samples containing 1x106 cells for labeling.
Samples were stained with either anti-rabbit GRP78 ET-21 (Sigma) antibody, or CD24-APC or
CD44-FITC (eBioscience) for 1 hr at 4°C. Primary antibody (GRP78 ET-21) was used at
5µg/1million cells. When appropriate, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit 488 secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at 4°C. Cells were then either analyzed via flow cytometry (BD
Fortessa) or sorted (BD FACSAria Cell Sorter) based on the staining of both a secondary-only
and IgG (Sigma) control (for GRP78-labeled cells) or single-stained controls (APC/FITC). When
cells were sorted for the in vivo experiments, all cells were labeled with a Dil Stain (1,1'-

Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate) (Invitrogen) immediately
following sorting, just before injection, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Soft Agar Colony Forming Assay
Sorted MCF7 populations (as described) were plated at 30,000 cells per well in 1.5 ml of growth
media plus 0.4% low-melt agarose (Fisher Scientific) and layered onto a 3 ml bed of growth media
with 0.5% low-melt agarose (Fisher Scientific). Cells were fed daily with 1 ml of growth media. At
the indicated time, growth media was removed and viable colonies were stained using
Iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT-Violet) (Sigma). Colony number and size was determined using
ImageJ analysis (Bethesda, MD, USA).
In Vivo Experiments
All animal experiments were performed ethically and in accordance with IACUC protocol
approved by the University of Notre Dame IACUC committee. Rag1−/− (C.129S7(B6)Rag1tm1Mom/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice
were eight weeks or older prior to experimental procedures. In vivo tumor seeding and growths
were formed by injection of 20,000 cells (DiI-labeled MCF7-total; DiI-labeled sGRP78+; or DiIlabeled-CSCs (isolated and labeled as described above) suspended in 150uL serum-free
RPMI media into the left cardiac ventricle. Prior to and during injection of cancer cells, mice
were anesthetized with isoflurane. Mice were sacrificed after two days post-injection for short
term experiments and four weeks post-injection for long term experiments. Organs were
immediately extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then washed and
stored in PBS. The presence of fluorescent cells was manually counted for lungs and brains
as indicated. For confocal analysis, small pieces of lung tissue were cut off from the collected
lungs, stained with DAPI and imaged by confocal microscopy to examine DiI stained cells.
Statistical Analysis
Results are shown as mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Remaining statistics
were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests, or Anova when doing multiple

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: GRP78 is important for reprogramming and is expressed on the surface of iPSCs.
(A) Human keratinocytes were retrovirally infected with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (OSKM)
either alone (4F) or in the presence of shGRP78 or shScramble control. Resulting colonies (~20
days after infection) were stained for Nanog and colony numbers determined relative to the
control. (B) Keratinocytes were retrovirally infected with OSKM (4F) or (C) with OSK (3F), in
addition to a retrovirus expressing GRP78 or a GFP control. The number of Nanog positive
colonies are shown relative to the control. (D) Keratinocytes were retrovirally infected with 4F
following a 2-day prime with either a retrovirus expressing GRP78 or a GFP control. Nanog
positive colony numbers are shown relative to the control. (E) A previously characterized human
iPSC line derived from fibroblasts (FiPS4F5 [40]) was examined by immunofluorescence for
GRP78 (red), and E-cadherin (green, a cell surface marker), and both markers were found to
colocalize together (Merge, Inset; arrows). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining shows
nuclei. Results were quantified from triplicate samples, and are representative of at least three
independent experiments. Error bars depict the standard error mean (SEM). *p<0.05; **p<0.01;
***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001; ns = not significant.
Figure 2: Cell surface GRP78 plays a significant role in reprogramming and pluripotent
stem cell and breast cancer cell function. (A) Fibroblasts (dFib-OCT4GFP cells [29]) were plated
on coverslips and infected with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC (OSKM) to initiate
reprogramming. At 14 days post infection, cells were fixed and stained with OCT4 (green) and
GRP78 (red). Day 14 shows the appearance of OCT4-positive cells (arrows, inset) at this
timepoint, indicative of cells that have undergone reprogramming back to a pluripotent state. Note
the change in GRP78 localization, primarily at the cell surface (insets). Fibroblasts that were not
infected with virus containing OSKM were used as a negative control. (B-C) Keratinocytes were
infected with OSKM, plated, and cells were treated with media only, a GRP78 inhibiting antibody
or IgG control throughout, or for the indicated timepoints. Following approximately 20 days after
OSKM infection, resulting colonies were stained for Nanog (representative staining at this
timepoint shown in B, used as the endpoint in the assay), and colony numbers determined relative
to media only control. Note that cell surface expression of GRP78 (sGRP78) appears to be
required for the reprogramming process (e.g. early anti-GRP78 timepoints affect colony
numbers), rather than affecting colony number after colonies had already formed. Morphological
pictures of cells throughout the reprogramming process (all at same magnification) are
shown. (D-E) Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) where GFP is driven by the OCT4 promoter [24] were
plated in triplicate and treated with media only, media containing GRP78 antibody, or respective
IgG control, at the concentrations indicated. Media was replaced daily for four days. Cell counts
were determined by trypan blue exclusion (D, upper panel). GFP expression (as a measure of
OCT4 expression) was analyzed by flow cytometry (D, lower panel). (E) Cell cycle distribution
determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. (F) MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells that overexpressed RFP-GRP78 under a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible
promoter, in the absence or presence of a GRP78 inhibiting antibody, were used in MTT-based
survival assays to assess cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Note that the resistance to cisplatininduced death that overexpression of GRP78 provides (red line) is dependent on cell surface
expression of GRP78 (blue line). Results were quantified from triplicate samples, and are
representative of at least three independent experiments. Error bars depict the standard error
mean (SEM). *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001; ns = not significant.
Figure 3: GRP78 induces tumor initiating cell (TIC) populations in breast cancer, and
sGRP78+ cells are a subset of TICs that show elevated levels of genes important in stem
cell functions. (A) MCF7-RFP-GRP78 and (B) MDA-MB-231-RFP-GRP78 cells show an

increase in the CD44+/CD24- tumor initiating population (TIC) following Dox treatment (to induce
GRP78 expression) by flow cytometry. (C) Relative CT values of 46 stemness-related genes (as
previously described [29]) were compared between RNA obtained from sGRP78+/- and TIC/NonTIC subpopulations isolated by FACS. (D) Relative quantification of genes shown in C
demonstrating that sGRP78+ cells express higher levels of stemness genes compared to other
populations. (E) MCF7 cells were labeled with CD44, CD24, and IgG or GRP78 and examined by
flow cytometry, and show that sGRP78+ cells are predominantly located in the TIC (CD24-/CD44+)
subpopulation compared to the Non-CSC (CD24+/CD44+) population. (F) Relative transcript levels
of GRP78 from total MCF7 cells or Non-TIC or TIC sorted populations. (F) Schematic representing
(E). Results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Error bars depict the
standard error mean (SEM). *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; ****p<0.0001; ns = not significant.
Figure 4: sGRP78+ cells show increased tumorigenesis potential in vitro and in vivo. (A)
MCF7 TICs (CD24-/CD44+), Non-TICs (CD24+/CD44+), or sGRP78+ cells were sorted by FACS
and seeded into soft agar conditions to assess in vitro tumorigenicity. Cells were fed daily for 10
days. To assess live colony growth, cells were stained with INT-Violet. Total colony number (size
above 0.005 in2) was scored using Image J Analysis. (B) Sample pictures representing (A). (CG) Immunocompromised were injected with either unsorted DiI-stained MCF7 cells, or sorted (TIC
or sGRP78+) DiI-stained MCF7 cells, and organs were collected 2 days later (C-D) or 1 month
later (E-G) and DiI-stained cells were manually counted (C-F) or imaged (G). sGRP78+ cells led
to significantly more breast cancer cells in lung and brain compared to other populations, both at
seeding timepoints and after 1 month. (G) The size of the larger tumors made by sGRP78+ cells
compared to TICs is shown for lung. Results are representative of at least three independent
experiments. Error bars depict the standard error mean (SEM). *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001;
****p<0.0001; ns = not significant.
