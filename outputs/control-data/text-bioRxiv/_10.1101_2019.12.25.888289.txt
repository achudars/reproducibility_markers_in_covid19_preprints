Abstract

19

Prions are unconventional pathogen without nucleotide genome and their pathogenic properties are defined by the primary

20

structure and the conformation of the constituent abnormal isoform (PrPSc) of prion protein (PrP). A polymorphic codon 129 of

21

human PrP that is valine (V129) or methionine (M129) is particularly influential on properties of PrPSc, affecting transmission

22

efficiencies and clinicopathological features. However, how the single residue is so influential has not been elucidated because

23

the detailed structures of PrPSc have not been determined yet due to its incompatibility with high-resolution structural analysis.

24

Previously we created an in-register parallel β-sheet local structural model of human PrPSc encompassing residues 107 to 143

25

that seemed more compatible with V129 than M129, based on knowledge from α-synuclein amyloids and an NMR-based model

26

of the amyloid of Y145Stop mutant of PrP in the literature. Here, we created an M129-compatible local structural model of PrPSc.

27

Severe destabilization of the model by G127V mutation was consistent with the protective effects of V127 polymorphism of

28

human PrP against prions. It was highly sensitive to the length of the hydrophobic side chain of codon 129 and replacement of

29

M129 with leucine or valine destabilized the structures. Interestingly, the U-shaped β-arch which comprises M129 flexibly

30

changed hydrophobic interaction networks inside the β-arch depending on the interactions with the surrounding structures,

31

whereas the previous model with V129 maintained the similar network patterns irrespective of the surroundings. The

32

differences between the two models may explain influences of the codon 129 polymorphism on transmissions and properties of

33

human prions.

Introduction

36

Prions are unconventional pathogens composed solely of prion protein (PrP) without any nucleotide genome. Prions cause

37

diseases characterized by accumulation of the abnormal isoform of PrP (PrPSc) in the central nervous system [1], and they can

38

occur in various mammalian species because many species constitutively express PrP, e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in

39

humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle [2], and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids [3]. Despite the

40

lack of nucleotide, prions show virus-like properties, including high infectivity, existence of many prion strains, and

41

species/strain barriers. As the virus-like pathogenic properties are encoded in the conformations of PrPSc [1][4], the pathogenic

42

phenotypes greatly depend on the primary structure of the constituent PrPSc. Most demonstrative examples of such phenomena

43

are the influences of polymorphic codon 129 (in human numbering unless otherwise noted) of human PrP, which is either

44

methionine (M129) or valine (V129). Clinicopathological features of sporadic CJD vary depending on the polymorphism, in

45

terms of PrP deposition patterns and lesion profiles in the brain, and apparent molecular sizes of protease-resistant cores of

46

PrPSc [5]. The PrPSc from CJD patients homozygous for M129 tend to form diffuse tiny deposits in the brain with 21-kDa

47

protease-resistant core fragment. On the other hand, PrPSc from CJD heterozygous or homozygous for V129 often forms

48

plaque-type and perineuronal deposits with 19-kDa protease-resistant core [5]. The codon 129 polymorphism also affects

49

transmission efficiencies of prions. For example, a vast majority of patients with new-variant CJD, manifestation of

50

trans-species transmission of BSE to humans, are homozygous for PrP with M129 (M129-PrP) [6][7]. In transmission

51

experiments of CJD prions to transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human-mouse chimeric PrP that has mouse sequences only in

52

the octapeptide-repeat region and the distal part of the third α-helix (H3) [8], incubation periods of Tg mice expressing chimeric

53

M129-PrP were significantly shortened, whereas Tg mice expressing chimeric V129-PrP were resistant to the transmission. The

54

methionine/leucine polymorphic codon 132 (in elk numbering) of elk PrP equivalent to the codon 129 of human PrP also affects

55

susceptibility to CWD [9][10]. The molecular mechanism of how differences between the hydrophobic amino acids greatly

56

affects properties of PrPSc is intriguing but extremely challenging. Although detailed structures of PrPSc are essential for the

57

investigation, they are currently unavailable due to the difficulty in high-resolution structural analyses of PrPSc. Even whether

58

PrPSc is an in-register parallel β-sheet amyloid or a β-solenoid is still controversial [11][12][13][14][15][16]. Regardless, we

59

previously created a local structural model of PrPSc encompassing residues 107 to 143 [17] by assuming that PrPSc is an

60

in-register parallel β-sheet amyloid and designing based on a structural model of Y145Stop-mutant PrP amyloid reported by

61

Theint et al. [18][19]. The model seemed structurally more stable, i.e., compatible, with V129 than M129 [17].

62

Then, we attempted to create models that are more compatible with M129 than V129 or L129, because PrP of the majority

63

of humans and most species have M129-PrP. Barriers in transmissions of CJD or CWD from M129-PrP-expressing individuals

64

to those with V129- or L129-PrP, respectively, suggest that codon 129 defines the preference of the substrate PrPC for the

65

conformation of PrPSc. Therefore, conformations of M129-compatible PrPSc and V129-compatible PrPSc should be sufficiently

66

different accordingly. Interestingly, the traits of V129-compatible PrPSc are so stable that they are preserved through passages

67

to M129-PrP-expressing individuals, without abbreviation of incubation periods on the secondary transmissions, i.e., no

68

adaptation to M129-PrP [20][21][22], reminiscent of non-adaptive prion amplification, NAPA [23]. This was in contrast with

69

ordinary species barriers accompanied by adaptation to the new host, e.g., transmission of Syrian hamster scrapie to Chinese

70

hamsters [24]. Possibly, the conformations of M129- and V129-compatible PrPSc are not readily interchangeable. On the other

71

hand, they may share certain similarities: protease-resistant core of mouse-adapted scrapie 22L prion, whose

72

protease-cleavage sites should be N-terminal to the residue 89 like 21-kDa core [25], was tolerant to insertion of a tetracysteine

73

tag up to the residue 96 [26], which corresponds to the N-terminus of the 19-kDa core [27]. A mouse-adapted scrapie RML also

74

tolerated insertion of a linear peptide up to 94 [28]. Those findings suggested that the compactly folded moiety of the 21-kDa

75

core that is preferred by M129 may be similar to that of the 19-kDa core preferred by V129, and the more N-terminal part of the

76

former is just loosely folded. What conformations could fulfill those requirements? If M129- and V129-compatible PrPSc are

77

remotely different as tau amyloids from Alzheimer’s and Pick’s diseases [29], they would not be interchangeable but have the

78

less similarity.

79

Here, we demonstrate that even a relatively small structural differences may suffice. Our new model was still based on the

80

Theint’s model, but a β-sheet encompassing residues 120-122, β-sheet(120-122), was flipped and only valine at 121 (V121)

81

faced the side chain of M129 (Fig 1A). In molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, mutations equivalent to polymorphisms that

82

affect transmission efficiencies of prions with M129, e.g., G127V, M129V, and M129L, substantially affected stability of the

83

amyloids. The present model provides an example of local structures of PrPSc whose stability is highly sensitive to the length of

84

hydrophobic side chain at codon 129. Moreover, truncated mutants of the model provided insights into the mechanism of

85

conformation determination of PrPSc depending on M/V129 polymorphism [30]. The explanation of effects of the polymorphisms

86

by our models further supports the view that PrPSc is an in-register parallel β-sheet amyloid. Those knowledge from the present

87

studies would advance our understanding about strain diversity of amyloids, and also aid in designing more plausible PrPSc

88

models and other amyloids in the future.

Results and Discussion

91

Configuration of a local structural model of M129-compatible PrPSc

92

MD simulation of Wild-type (WT) model with M129

93

The protective effects of L132 of elk PrP against CWD (in elk numbering) [9][10] and transmission barriers between

94

M129-PrP- and V129-PrP-expressing individuals [20][31] implied that length of the hydrophobic side chain of codon 129 is

95

critically important for propagation of M129-compatible PrPSc. We already had an idea about what structure could exhibit such

96

properties through MD simulation of G84M- and G84I-mutants of α-synuclein amyloids [17]. Therefore, we created a new model

97

by flipping β-sheet(120-122) of the previous model (Fig 1A, left) so that the side chain of M129 barely maintain contact with that

98

of V121 in the hydrophobic core of the U-shaped β-arch encompassing 120 to 133. We also modified the surrounding structures

99

by arbitrarily positioning hydrophobic residues to let them efficiently interact and stabilize the local structures (Fig 1A, right

100

panels). In the MD simulations, the model was sufficiently stable for analyses (Fig 1B, left). Even in relatively disordered runs,

101

chain A or J only partly dislocated from the stack at the U-shaped β-arch (Fig 1B, middle and right).

102

MD simulation of the G127V mutant

103

First, we observed influences of G127V substitution that corresponds to a well-known protective polymorphism of human

104

PrP against CJD [32] on structural stability of the model. The G127V amyloid obviously appeared unstable and the

105

destabilization was so extensive that the chains were unraveled in the U-shaped β-arch (Fig 1C) as in the previous model [17].

106

Heat maps of β-sheet propensity values confirmed the structural instability (Fig 1D, G127V). The average β-sheet propensity

107

values were particularly lower at L125 compared with WT, confirming the unraveling (Fig 1D, red box). The lower β-sheet

108

propensities at L125 was consistent with the significantly lower proximity scores for L125-L125 interactions than that of WT (Fig

109

1E, red box), which indicates frequency of hydrophobic contacts between the two residues [17]. As in-register parallel β-sheet

110

amyloids have ~4.8 Å intervals between the chains, the proximity score with cut-off value of 5 Å well reflect the stability of the

111

β-sheets. Besides L125-L125 interactions, other hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic core of the β-arch were also

112

significantly affected, e.g., V121-M129 (Fig 1E). The heat map of local B-factors of the G127V amyloid (Fig 1D, local B), which

113

indicates aberration from the original structures, showed more bright spots in the region of the U-shaped β-arch(120-133) than

114

that of WT, further confirming the structural disorder. Interestingly, the hydrophobic interaction network outside the U-shaped

115

β-arch was similar to that of WT (Suppl Fig S2, G127V). As in the previous model, the destabilization by G127V substitution

116

was consistent with its protective effects against CJD prions.

117

MD simulation of the M129V mutant

118

Then, we tested our initial assumption that M129 is more advantageous to maintain the hydrophobic core than V129 or

119

L129 by observing influences of M129V or M129L substitutions. The M129V amyloid seemed less stable than WT (Fig 2A) with

120

more frequent loss of β-sheet structures and dislocation of chain A or J from the stack (Suppl Fig S1, M129V). The heatmaps of
-4-

121

average β-sheer propensities confirmed the unstable β-sheets of the M129V mutant, particularly at L125 and in

122

β-sheet(128-130) (Fig 2B, inset in red). The heatmap of local B-factors of the M129V amyloid was apparently more spangled

123

with bright spots than that of WT, particularly at G126 (Fig 2B, green inset). Proximity scores of the hydrophobic interactions in

124

the hydrophobic core of the U-shaped β-arch provided more quantitative differences between WT and M129V. The most

125

notable finding was the significantly lower scores for L125-L125 interactions of M129V than those of WT (Fig 2C, blue box).

126

Although not as much as G127V, the impaired interactions confirmed the structural instability of the M129V amyloid. Likewise,

127

proximity scores for V129-V129 interactions of M129V were also lower than M129-M129 of WT, though not statistically

128

significant (490.66 ± 65.50 vs 424.98 ± 80.78, p = 0.075). This is in contrast with the results of the previous model, where the

129

scores for the V129-V129 interactions of M129V mutant tended to be higher than those of the WT (449.15 ± 111.65 vs 513.31 ±

130

62.17; not statistically significant) [17]. Unexpectedly, the proximity scores for V121-V129 of M129V and WT were comparable

131

despite the short length of the side chain of V129 (Fig 2C). Accordingly, the distances between Cα of V121 and V129 tended to

132

be shorter than V121-M129 of WT (Fig 2D, M129V). The high intrinsic β-sheet tendency of V129 may somehow bring

133

β-sheet(120-122) and β-sheet(128-133) closer, as most prominently demonstrated in Run 10, where the two β-sheets

134

approached so close as to form a triangular conformation reminiscent of the M129V mutant of the previous model [17] (Suppl

135

Fig S1, M129V). Unlike the previous model, the closer positioning of the β-sheets seemed to cost the structural integrities in the

136

present model. The relatively higher proximity scores for V121-L125 interactions of M129V (Fig 2C) may reflect altered

137

positional relations of V121 and L125 due to the distortion of the β-arch.

138

MD simulation of the M129L mutant

139

The M129L amyloid also appeared more unstable than the WT, with chain A more frequently dislocating from the stack (Fig

140

2E). The heat maps of β-sheet propensities and local B-factors exhibited similar changes as those of M129V but of milder

141

degrees (Fig 2B, M129L). In proximity score analysis, significantly lower L125-L125 interactions than that of WT further

142

confirmed the instability (Fig 2C, blue box). The most remarkable finding was the drastically low scores for V121-L129

143

interactions (Fig 2C, red box). The wider distances between Cα of V121 and L129 was consistent with loss of the bond

144

between them (Fig 2D, M129L), which could be attributed to the shorter side chain of L129 than M129. In addition, the

145

significantly lower scores for L129-L129 interactions suggested attenuated inter-layer interactions of β-sheet(128-133) (Fig 2C).

146

The lack of Cβ-branching of L129 may be responsible for the different effects from those of V129, because it allows the back

147

bone more freedom of conformation.

148

Those findings confirm the instability of M129V and M129L amyloids relative to WT, supporting our view that length of the

149

hydrophobic side chain of codon 129 is critical for the stability of the present model.

150

MD simulation of the I138M mutant

151

The final shots of I138M amyloid seemed more stable than WT, without any dislocation of chain A from the stack in ten

152

independent runs of simulation (Fig 3A). β-sheet propensities and local B-factors were also comparable to those of WT (Fig

153

3B). Indeed, the average proximity score for L125-L125 interactions was higher than that of WT (Fig 3C), whereas the scores

154

for L125-M129 interactions were significantly lower (Fig 3C, red box). This could be due to the wider distances between the Cα

155

of V121 and M129 (Fig 3D). The widening may be secondary to the structural alteration in the C-terminal region by the I138M

156

substitution that makes the local back-bone more flexible, although specifically what alteration was not discernible [17]. This

157

mutant suggests that V121-M129 interactions does not have to be very high for stability of the U-shaped β-arch.

158

Stability of the amyloids of truncated peptides in the present conformation

159

The interaction network diagram of the present model showed multiple intense interactions between the U-shaped β-arch

160

and the surrounding structures, e.g., A118-P137 and A117-I139 (Suppl Fig S2). To evaluate their contribution to the stability of

161

the U-shaped β-arch, we created amyloids of the C-terminally truncated molecules, PrP(107-137) of the present model

162

(C-truncated WT) and its M129V mutant, and observed on MD simulation. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal truncation of WT further

163

stabilized the U-shaped β-arch (Fig 4A), while accentuating the instability of M129V mutant (Fig 4B). Heat maps of β-sheet

164

propensity and local B-factors confirmed less β-sheet structures and the instability in the U-shaped β-arch (Fig 4C, red boxes).

165

Interaction network diagrams confirmed the loss of the intense A118-P137 and A117-I139 interactions in both the amyloids but,

166

instead C-truncated WT reinforced the U-shaped β-arch by newly forming intense A118-A133 and A113-V122 interactions that

167

were not present before truncation (Fig 4D, WT). In contrast, C-truncated M129V also formed A118-A133 but the proximity

168

score was ~5-fold lower (Fig 4E, blue box), and the network in the N-terminal region was quite similar with that of the full-length

169

WT (Fig 4D, M129V). Interactions in the hydrophobic cores of the U-shaped β-arches were also rather different (Fig 4E, bold

170

letters); WT showed nearly even scores for the three interactions albeit slightly higher V121-L125, whereas M129V had

171

outstanding V121-M129 interactions ~5-fold higher than others. As anticipated, the differences in the scores of L125-L125

172

interactions between the truncated molecules were also accentuated by the truncation (Fig 4E, red box).

173

We created amyloids of further-truncated molecules, N-terminally (N) truncated PrP(117-143) and C- and N-terminally (CN)

174

truncated PrP(117-137), assuming that the PrPC-PrPSc conversion process initiates by incorporating the native β-sheets of the

175

substrate PrPC, β1, into the template PrPSc and the truncated amyloids provide insights into the initial phase of the conversion.

176

The N-truncated and the CN-truncated amyloids appeared comparably unstable (Fig 4F and G), suggesting the C-terminal

177

truncation of the N-truncated amyloid did not further destabilize. Heat maps confirmed their similar stabilities, despite the

178

differences in their sizes (Fig 4H). Interaction network diagrams of the N-truncated amyloid was reminiscent of that of the

179

full-length amyloid due to intense A118-P137 and very weak A118-A133 interactions and the similar pattern in the hydrophobic

180

core (Fig 4I). On the other hand, CN-truncated amyloid resumed intense A118-A133 like the C-truncated, but interactions in the

181

hydrophobic core were predominated by outstandingly intense V121-L125 interactions (Fig 4J, red box). Thus, each truncated

182

model showed its unique pattern of interaction network to maintain stability, as indicated by proximity scores of L125-L125

183

interactions (Fig 4J).

184

Stability of the amyloids of truncated peptides in the previous conformation

185

The results of the truncated models prompted us to MD simulation of the C- or/and N-terminal truncated amyloids of the

186

previous model [17]. To avoid confusion and for convenience of description, hereafter we refer to the present and the previous

187

models as ‘Type-1’ and ‘Type-2’ models/β-arches, respectively, based on the numbers of hydrophobic residues mainly

188

interacting with residue 129 (i.e., only V121 in Type-1, while A120 and V122 in Type-2).

189

We used Type-2 model with V129 for the truncation and MD simulation, because the M129V mutant was more stable than

190

WT. In contrast to the Type-1 model, C-terminal truncation substantially destabilized the amyloid structures (Fig 5A), and N- and

191

CN-truncations additively further destabilized (Fig 5B and C). Heat maps confirmed the gradual decrements in β-sheet

192

propensities in the β-arch region (Fig 5D, red box). A remarkable finding was in their interaction diagrams: they showed very

193

similar patterns of interaction networks irrespective of truncation types (Fig 5E), albeit modest alterations in intensities of some

194

bonds (Fig 5F). That was reminiscent of the C-truncated V129 Type-1 model (Fig 4D, M129V). The significant decrements in

195

the L125-L125 interactions confirmed the aggravation of instability by the truncations (Fig 5F, red box).

196
197

Discussion

198

Relevance of the present model as a local structural model of PrPSc

199

The present local structural model of PrPSc, Type-1 model/β-arch, provides an example of the structure that is more stable

200

with M129 than V129 or L129, due to its sensitivity to the length of hydrophobic side chain of codon 129. The destabilizing

201

effects of L129 may be associated with the lower susceptibility of elk with L132 polymorphism to CWD [9][10]. Our models may

202

also address the persistency of traits of V129-compatible PrPSc even after passages to M129-PrP-expressing hosts, showing no

203

abbreviation in incubation on the secondary transmissions and swiftly resuming the original phenotypes with 19-kDa core on

204

back-transmissions to V129-expressing hosts [20][21][22]. If M129-compatible and V129-compatible PrPSc have

205

β-sheet(120-122) in a relation of opposition in terms of directions of the side chains as in our models, they are not easily

206

interchangeable and may explain the persistence. This can also provide a clue to the mechanism of NAPA [23]. Moreover, we

207

noticed that a final product of coarse-grain MD simulation of PrP-derived peptide encompassing 120-144 had a similar structure

208

as the U-shaped β-arch of our model [33]. Those support the relevance of our models.

209

Significance of codon 129 polymorphism on local structures and entire conformations of PrPSc

210

The present and the previous models/β-arches (Type-1 and Type-2 models, respectively) were rather differently affected by

211

the M/V129 polymorphism and the N- and/or C-terminal truncations. The higher stability of the CN-truncated M129 Type-1 than

212

that of CN-truncated V129 Type-2 β-arch was unexpected. We had anticipated the opposite, because heterozygous CJD cases

213

tend to exhibit more features of V129-homozygous CJD, with 19-kDa core and plaque-type depositions [5][34], suggesting a

214

possibility that V129-PrP predominates the phenotype because it is more amyloid-prone. On the other hand, the higher stability

215

of the M129 β-arch seemed consistent with the higher relative risk of sporadic CJD in M129-homozygous population than the

216

V129-homozygous [35]. The stability of the M129 Type-1 β-arch is presumably attributable to the backbone flexibility due to the

217

absence of Cβ branching and long hydrophobic side chain of M129. It adapted to the C- and/or N-truncations, by modulating the

218

interaction network patterns as if compensating for the lost interactions, interestingly with V121-M129 interactions keeping

219

almost the same moderate proximity scores at ~200. Possibly, the structural flexibility of M129 Type-1 β-arch that efficiently

220

adapts to the surrounding situations makes it compatible with various conformations of PrPSc including human-mouse chimeric

221

PrP [8][36], fatal familial insomnia caused by D178N mutation [37], and new-variant CJD [6][7]. The moderate V121-M129

222

interactions may be important for the stability, because they would not restrain dynamic behaviors of β-sheet(120-122) and

223

β-sheet(128-133). Excessively intense interactions can hampered adaptive changes in their behaviors and futilely preserved

224

the old interaction network, like V121-V129 interactions of the C-truncated V129 Type-1. The accentuated instability of the

225

C-truncated M129V amyloid suggests that the influences of V129 are greater in the earlier phase before completion of the local

226

conversion (Fig 6).

227

Unlike M129 Type-1, the V129 Type-2 β-arch was sensitive to the truncations. The interaction network patterns were

228

characteristically almost the same among full-length and truncated molecules, possibly because the intense bond between

233

β-sheet(120-122) and β-sheet(128-133) disabled their adaptation to changes in surroundings. That may eventually destabilize
amyloids unless the conformation is preferable for the β-arch, as in the C-truncated V129 Type-1 model. How can a PrPSc adopt
such an intolerant structure? We hypothesize that a refolding pattern initiated at the β-arch can produce PrPSc with V129 Type-2
β-arch. Hypothetically, the PrPC-PrPSc conversion initiates with incorporation of β1 or β2 into the template PrPSc, followed by
U-shaped β-arch formation by β-sheet(120-122) and β-sheet(128-130) (Fig 6). In this step, the nascent β-sheet(120-122) may

234

preferentially direct hydrophobic side chains of A120 and V122 toward V129, forming the Type-2 β-arch, because it can conceal

235

more hydrophobicity from water and is thermodynamically favorable. Then, the refolding propagates thereof, forming interaction

236

networks in favored ways for the V129 Type-2 β-arch. Thus, as the U-shaped β-arch with V129 is permissive only to preferred

237

local structures, V129-PrP may propagate a limited variety of prion strains. The hypothesis may explain why the Tg mice

238

expressing human-mouse chimeric V129-PrP were resistant even to V129-homozygous CJD [8][36], as discussed in more

239

detail below, and also the resistance of V129-PrP to variant CJD.

229
230
231
232

240

Besides structural flexibility, rates of local refolding can affect PrPSc conformation in theory. Although completely-refolded

241

M129 Type-1 β-arch is stable, the refolding may not be necessarily efficient because of steric effects of the long side chain and

242

the back-bone flexibility of methionine (Fig 6), as suggested by relatively slow in vitro aggregation of Y145Stop mutant of Syrian

243

hamster PrP [19] and slower aggregation rates of PrP(120-144) peptide with M129 than that with V129 [38]. If the local refolding

244

around M129 is delayed, refolding processes initiated at another region may propagate meanwhile and eventually

245

predominantly determine the conformation of the entire molecule. In summary, V129 seems to effectively influence

246

conformation determination of PrPSc by being permissive only to its favored ones, while M129 is apparently subordinate due to

247

its adaptivity and kinetics.

248

Other conversion-initiation sites and conformation determination of PrPSc

249

In the above discussions, we assumed that there are multiple sites where PrPC-PrPSc conversion processes initiate and

250

each prion strain uses its preferred site to propagate refolding in its unique way, resulting in the strain-specific conformation, as

251

we previously hypothesized [30]. We consider the region comprising β1 as one of the sites, and there should be more. For

252

example, P102L mutation of human PrP that causes an inherited prion disease, Gerstmann-Streussler-Sheinker syndrome

253

(GSS) [39][40][41], and I109 polymorphism of bank vole PrP that causes spontaneous transmissible prion disease [42] suggest

254

that the region comprising codon 102 or 109 can autonomously maintain amyloid structures and propagate refolding. To note,

255

the majority of P102L-associated GSS patients have P102L and M129 on the same allele [43][39], whereas A117V-associated

256

GSS has exclusively V129 [40]. When the refolding propagating from P102L arrives at codon 129, M129 may tolerate the

257

imposed conformation by forming an adaptive β-arch, whereas V129 β-arch disfavors it. A117V is interesting because it almost

258

flanks the U-shaped β-arch. It might favor initiation of refolding from the β-arch or closer positioning of the two β-sheets of the

259

β-arch for stability of the amyloid structures.

260

On the C-terminal side, the region between first and second α-helixes (H1~H2) comprising another native β-sheet of PrPC,

262

β2, is a site for PrPC-PrPSc binding [44] and might be a site of initiation of refolding. Cooperation with the distal H3 region,
possibly by cross-β-spine formation, may further facilitate binding the template PrPSc and initiate refolding thereof, as suggested

263

by the transmission experiments of CJD to Tg mice expressing human-mouse chimeric PrP that has mouse sequence in the

264

distal H3 [45] and disulfide-crosslink experiments between H1~H2 and distal H3 [46]. As mentioned above, M129 may be

265

compatible with the conformation imposed by the refolding pattern initiated in the C-terminal site, whereas V129 is not

266

[8][36][47]. Their different compatibilities with the pattern are implied by the N-terminally truncated protease-resistant fragments

267

of 12-13 kDa from MM1- and VV2-CJD [48][49]: the former showed 13-kDa fragment truncated at codon 154 that contained β2,

268

while the latter had shorter fragment truncated at 162 that barely contained β2. If the truncated fragments represent

269

half-converted molecules, the refolding process initiated at β2 propagated N-terminally in the PrPSc of the CJD with M129, i.e.,

270

M129 originally fits in the refolding pattern, whereas the pattern of refolding would not occur in the CJD with V129 and is alien to

271

V129.

272

Potential application to other in-register parallel β-sheet amyloids

261

273

We demonstrated that the short-MD simulations and interaction network analysis could characterize the influences of

274

mutations that are known to affect transmission efficiencies of prions. That proved usefulness of this method in investigation of

275

amyloids, and further support that PrPSc is an in-register parallel β-sheet amyloid. Importantly, our models were designed with

276

the main focus on the U-shaped β-arch, and the other regions were arbitrarily designed for the regional stability without extrinsic

277

reinforcement. Therefore, those structures may differ in the full-length PrPSc. Nonetheless, our models have implications about

278

dynamic behaviors of in-register parallel β-sheet amyloids with U-shaped β-arches. Our studies demonstrated that influences of

279

hydrophobic residues on β-arches depend on the conformation of the β-arches and the interactions with other residues in the

280

hydrophobic cores. Moreover, flexibility of each β-arch (not the back bone) and balances among the β-arches are important for

281

stability of an amyloid molecule; excessively intense bonds between a specific pair of β-sheets can be destabilizing. As

282

U-shaped β-arches are essential for efficient cross-β structure formation, the notion from the studies can contribute to

283

investigation of various amyloids and advance our understanding of their prion-like properties and pathogenesis. Targeting

284

U-shaped β-arches for therapies is worth trying: their stable structures are suitable for structure-based drug design.

Materials and Methods

Detailed protocols of the short MD simulation and various analyses were as described in the preprint on bioRxiv [17]. Here we

289

briefly describe essential points.

Modeling PrP(107-143) amyloids and MD simulations

291

The reasons we focused on this region and decided the N- and C-terminal ends and how we designed the amyloid model were

292

previously described elsewhere [17], except that the β-sheet restraints were set for the residues N108-M109, A115-A116,

A120-V122, Y128-L130, P137-F141.

294

MD simulations

295

The protocol for the 10-ns MD simulation was the same as reported elsewhere [17], except that the restraints were slowly

296

removed first in the directions along the X-Y plane, and then in the Z direction.

297

Analyses

298

The protocols for determination of the secondary structure contents, evaluation of hydrophobic contacts, definition of proximity

299

scores, and the method for visualization of the results are the same as previously reported [17]. For evaluation of hydrophobic

300

interactions, we used “proximity score” that indicates frequency of two given residues approaching within 5 Å [17], because it

301

conveniently enables evaluation of intra- and inter-layer interactions at the same time.

302

Statistical analyses

303

Two-tailed Welch two sample t-test was used for analysis of statistical differences between two groups. A p-value less than 0.05

304

was considered statistically significant.

Fig 1. Designing a local structural model of human PrPSc encompassing residues 107-143 and assessment of
influences of G127V mutation on the structural stability.
A. (Left) A PrP(107-143) amyloid as a tentative local-structural model of PrPSc, which consists of 10 layers (chains A–J) like
the previous model [17]. Note that V121 is facing M129 in this model. (Right) Side chains of the hydrophobic residues whose
hydrophobic contacts are important for structures are explicitly exhibited (red~blue insets).
B-C. Final snapshots of (B) the wild-type (WT) and (C) the G127V-mutant after a 10-ns MD simulation. A relatively stable one
(left) and unstable ones (middle and right) of ten independent runs of MD simulation are selected: final shots of all the ten runs
are presented in Supplementary Figure S1.
D. (Left and middle) Heatmaps showing the average values and the standard deviation values of β-sheet propensity of each
residue (Avg-β and SD-β, respectively) of the WT and the G127V-mutant PrP amyloids (WT and G127V). The values were
calculated based on ten independent runs of 10-ns MD simulation. Note that the Avg-β values are lower in the G127V in the
row of L125 (red box). (Right) Heat maps of local B-factors of each residue, which indicates aberration from the original
positions, of WT and G127V amyloids.
E. A Graph of the proximity scores for representative hydrophobic interactions that may contribute to stability of the U-shaped
β-arch. The bars and error bars represent mean ± standard deviation (SD) of values from ten independent runs. The asterisks
indicate p < 0.05. Note that many interactions are significantly affected by the G127V mutation and particularly L125-L125
interactions are drastically impaired (red box).

A. Final snapshots of M129V-mutant amyloid after a 10-ns MD simulation. A relatively stable one (left) and unstable ones
(middle and right) of ten independent runs of MD simulation are selected: final shots of all the ten runs are presented in
Supplementary Figure S1.
B. Heatmaps showing Avg-β (left) and SD-β (middle) values of each residue of the WT and the mutant amyloids (WT, M129V
and M129L). (Right) Heat maps of average local B-factors of each residue. (Red and green insets) Magnified views of the Avgβ and local B-factors around L125 residue, respectively. The values were calculated based on ten independent runs of 10-ns
MD simulation. Note that the Avg-β values of the L125 row are lower (paler) in M129V and M129L compared with that of WT,
suggesting instability in β-sheet structures in the mutant.
C. A Graph of proximity scores for hydrophobic interactions that may contribute to stability of the U-shaped β-arch, comparing
WT, M129V and M129L amyloids. The bars and error bars represent mean ± SD of values from ten independent runs. The
asterisks indicate p < 0.05. Note that V121-L129 and L125-L125 interactions are significantly lower in the M129L amyloid (red
and blue boxes, respectively).
D. Final snapshots of PrP(107–143;M129L)-mutant amyloid after a 10-ns MD simulation. A relatively stable one (left) and

Fig 4. MD simulation of truncated mutants of the present local structural model of PrP Sc revealed its flexibility.
A-B. Final shots after 10-ns MD simulations of (A) the C-terminally truncated models (encompassing 107-137) of the wild-type
(WT) and (B) the C-terminally truncated M129V mutant (M129V). A relatively stable (left) and two relatively unstable ones
(middle and right) are selected from five independent runs. Final shots of all the five runs are presented in the Supplementary
Figure S5.
C. Heat maps of Avg-β (left), SD-β (middle) and average local B-factors (right) of the C-truncated WT and M129V. The values
are based on five independent runs of 10-ns simulations. Note that Avg-β values in the U-shaped β-arch region, particularly in
the row of L125, are substantially decreased, SD-β values are increased and Avg local B-factors are increased in M129V (red
boxes).
D. Hydrophobic interaction diagrams of the full-length WT (left), the C-truncated WT (middle) and M129V (right). The color and
thickness of the lines represent the proximity scores of the interactions and the legend is presented in Fig I.
E. A graph of proximity scores for hydrophobic interactions comparing the C-truncated WT and C-truncated M129V. The
interactions in bold letters indicate those in the hydrophobic core of the U-shaped β-arch. The bars and error bars represent
mean ± SD of scores from five independent runs of 10-ns simulation. Note that L125-L125 interactions are significantly lower in
the mutant than that of WT (red box). Asterisks indicate p < 0.05.
F-G. Final shots after 10-ns MD simulations of (F) the N-terminally truncated models (encompassing 117-143) and (G) the Cterminally truncated model (117-137) of the WT amyloid. A relatively stable (left) and a relatively unstable ones (right) were
selected. Final shots of all the five runs are presented in the Supplementary Figure S5.
H. Heat maps of Avg-β (left), SD-β (middle) and average local B-factors (right) of the N-truncated (N) and the double-truncated
(CN) amyloids. The values are based on five independent runs of 10-ns simulations. Note that Avg-β, SD-β and Avg local Bfactors are rather similar in the U-shaped β-arch region between the amyloids (red boxes).

A-C. Final shots after 10-ns MD simulations of (A) C-terminally truncated V129 Type-2 model encompassing 107-137, (B) Nterminally truncated model encompassing 117-143, and (C) C- and N-terminally truncated model encompassing 117-137. A
relatively stable (left) and a relatively unstable ones (right) are presented. Final shots of all the five runs are presented in the
Supplementary Figure S5.
D. Heat maps of Avg-β (left) and average local B-factors (right) of the full-length (FL), C-truncated (C), N-truncated (N) and CNtruncated (CN). The values are based on five independent runs of 10-ns simulations. Note that Avg-β values in the U-shaped βarch region (red box) are substantially decreased in the truncated amyloids.
E. Hydrophobic interaction diagrams of the full-length and the truncated V129 Type-2 models. The color and thickness of the
lines represent the proximity scores for the interactions. Note that the interaction networks in the U-shaped β-arches are rather
similar irrespective of the truncation types.
F. A graph of proximity scores for representative hydrophobic interactions. The interactions in bold letters indicate those in the
hydrophobic core of the U-shaped β-arch. The bars and error bars represent mean ± SD of scores from five (ten for FL)
independent runs of 10-ns simulation. Note that L125-L125 interactions are significantly lower in the N- or CN-truncated amyloid
than that of the full-length (red box). Asterisks indicate p < 0.05.

Fig 6. PrPC-PrPSc conversion reactions by two PrPSc with different types of U-shaped β-arches.
A schematic illustration of the PrPC-PrPSc conversion reactions focusing on the U-shaped β-arch region: the conversion of
V129-PrP by a PrPSc with V129 Type-2 β-arch (left half) and the conversion of M129-PrP by a PrPSc with M129 Type-1 βarch (right half). The conversion reaction is assumed to begin with breakage of the native anti-parallel β-sheets of PrPC, β1
and β2, by the template PrPSc and incorporating each of them into the template. Subsequently, U-shaped β-arch formation
follows, but this process may be relatively inefficient in the M129 Type-1 β-arch formation. Note that β-sheet(120-122) has
the 'more-hydrophobic’ side with two hydrophobic side chains of A120 and V122 and the less-hydrophobic side. As the two
types of β-arches have the β-sheet(120-122) in a relation of opposition in terms of the direction of the more-hydrophobic side,
they would not be easily interchangeable.
