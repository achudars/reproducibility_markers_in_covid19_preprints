Abstract

25

Measles is characterised by fever and a maculopapular skin rash, which is associated with

26

immune clearance of measles virus (MV)-infected cells. Histopathological analyses of skin

27

biopsies from humans and non-human primates (NHPs) with measles rash have identified

28

MV-infected keratinocytes and mononuclear cells in the epidermis, around hair follicles and

29

near sebaceous glands. Here, we address the pathogenesis of measles skin rash by combining

30

data from experimentally infected NHPs, ex vivo infection of human skin sheets and in vitro

31

infection of primary human keratinocytes. Longitudinal analysis of the skin of experimentally

32

MV-infected NHPs demonstrated that infection in the skin precedes onset of rash by several

33

days. MV infection was initiated in lymphoid and myeloid cells in the dermis before

34

dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes. These data were in good concordance with ex

35

vivo MV infections of human skin sheets, in which dermal cells were more targeted than the

36

epidermal ones. To address viral dissemination to the epidermis and to determine whether

37

the dissemination is receptor-dependent, we performed experimental infections of primary

38

keratinocytes collected from healthy or nectin-4-deficient donors. These experiments

39

demonstrated that MV infection of keratinocytes is nectin-4-dependent, and nectin-4

40

expression was higher in differentiated than in proliferating keratinocytes. Based on these

41

data, we hypothesise that measles skin rash is initiated by migrating MV-infected

42

lymphocytes that infect dermal skin-resident CD150+ immune cells. The infection is

43

subsequently disseminated from the dermal papillae to nectin-4+ keratinocytes in the basal

44

epidermis. Lateral spread of MV infection is observed in the superficial epidermis, most likely

45

due to the higher level of nectin-4 expression on differentiated keratinocytes. Finally, MV-

46

infected cells are cleared by infiltrating immune cells, causing hyperaemia and oedema, which

47

give the appearance of morbilliform skin rash.

Author Summary

50

Several viral infections are associated with skin rash, including parvovirus B19, human

51

herpesvirus type 6, dengue virus and rubella virus. However, the archetype virus infection

52

that leads to skin rash is measles. Although all of these viral exanthemata often appear similar,

53

their pathogenesis is different. In the case of measles, the appearance of skin rash is a sign

54

that the immune system is clearing MV-infected cells from the skin. How the virus reaches

55

the skin and is locally disseminated remains unknown. Here we combine observations and

56

expertise from pathologists, dermatologists, virologists and immunologists to delineate the

57

pathogenesis of measles skin rash. We show that MV infection of dermal myeloid and

58

lymphoid cells precedes viral dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes. We speculate

59

that immune-mediated clearance of these infected cells results in hyperaemia and oedema,

60

explaining the redness of the skin and the slightly elevated spots of the morbilliform rash.

Introduction

63

Measles virus (MV) is a highly contagious enveloped virus with a negative single-stranded RNA

64

genome, that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus (PMID: 31609197).

65

Measles is associated with fever, cough and a characteristic maculopapular skin rash [1]. MV

66

utilises two cellular receptors to infect its target cells: CD150 and nectin-4 [2-4]. CD150 plays

67

a crucial role during viral entry and systemic dissemination. It is expressed on subsets of

68

immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes. Nectin-4 is

69

crucial for viral transmission to the next host. It is an adherens junction protein expressed at

70

the basolateral surface of differentiated respiratory epithelial cells and is involved in the

71

maintenance of epithelium integrity [5, 6].

72
73

Following entry of MV into the respiratory tract, the primary infection of myeloid cells leads

74

to a cell-associated viremia mediated by CD150+ lymphocytes, resulting in systemic disease

75

[7-9]. During a clinically silent incubation phase of 7 to 10 days, circulating MV-infected

76

lymphocytes migrate into various tissues and transmit the virus to susceptible tissue-resident

77

CD150+ immune cells and nectin-4+ epithelial cells. Basolateral infection of respiratory

78

epithelial cells leads to the apical release of nascent virions into the lumen of the respiratory

79

tract [10-12]. Shedding is associated with the onset of prodromal clinical signs such as fever

80

and cough [9, 13]. Maculopapular skin rash and conjunctivitis follow a few days later [9] and

81

are associated with onset of MV-specific cellular immune responses [13]. Patients with a

82

compromised cellular immune system do not develop rash or conjunctivitis, but are at high

83

risk of developing severe disease [14].

85

In histopathological studies of human skin biopsies, measles skin rash is mostly characterised

86

by infection and necrosis of keratinocytes and mononuclear cells in the epidermis, and

87

multinucleated giant cells located in proximity to hair follicles and sebaceous glands [15, 16].

88

It has been postulated that measles rash starts by infection of dermal endothelial cells [17].

89

However, these cells neither express CD150 nor nectin-4 [18, 19]. Moreover, we have

90

previously identified MV-infected lymphocytes and DCs in the skin of experimentally infected

91

non-human primates preceding onset of skin rash [8]. Besides CD150+ and nectin-4+ cells,

92

other cells that express DC-SIGN or Langerin could play a role in the pathogenesis of measles

93

skin rash, since DC-SIGN and Langerin facilitate attachment, but not entry, of MV and thus

94

potentially help in spreading the infection in the skin.

95
96

In order to understand the pathogenesis of measles skin rash, it is important to understand

97

both the architecture of the skin and the spatial organisation of cell subsets that express

98

either CD150 or nectin-4. The dermis is vascularised and contains several subsets of immune

99

cells that express CD150. These include a network of myeloid DCs and clusters of tissue-

100

resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [20-22]. In contrast to the dermis, the epidermis is not

101

vascularised. It mainly consists of keratinocytes, with an interdigitating network of

102

Langerhans cells (LCs) and melanocytes [23]. The epidermis comprises of proliferating

103

keratinocytes at the basal lamina that differentiate towards the skin surface. Keratinocytes

104

express nectin-4 and expression levels increase during differentiation. It is known that

105

keratinocytes are susceptible to MV infection [24]. The top layer of the epidermis, the stratum

106

corneum, consists of a layer of dead keratinocytes called corneocytes. Interestingly, immune

107

cells and nutrients can only reach the epidermis by migration and diffusion, respectively, from

108

the superficial dermis through the basal lamina. The pilosebaceous unit begins at the

109

epidermis and extends into the dermis, where the surrounding tissue is usually better

110

vascularised. Therefore, tissue-resident lymphocytes are often seen in close association with

111

these structures [21]. Hair follicles are mainly constituted of keratinocytes that express high

112

levels of nectin-4 explaining their propensity for MV infection [25].

113
114

During viraemia, systemic dissemination of MV is mediated by circulating MV-infected CD150+

115

lymphocytes. However, how these cells infiltrate the skin, ultimately resulting in skin rash,

116

remains largely unknown. In this study we aimed to identify the cells involved in MV infection

117

of the skin and to understand the pathogenesis of skin rash. We demonstrate that MV

118

infection of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the superficial dermis precedes dissemination to

119

epidermal keratinocytes, which is followed by onset of the typical skin rash.

Results

121

MV skin infection precedes onset of rash in experimentally-infected non-human primates

122

(NHPs)

123

We retrospectively analysed data from cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis)

124

inoculated with recombinant MV (rMV) strains expressing enhanced green fluorescent

125

protein (EGFP) [26]. Fluorescent spots, indicating the presence of MV-infected cells, became

126

detectable in the skin around 8 days post-inoculation (dpi), although skin rash only became

127

prominent between 11 and 13 dpi (Fig 1) [27]. We previously reported that by 9 dpi, i.e. before

128

the onset of rash, infected cells in the skin mainly consisted of EGFP+ lymphocytes and DCs

129

[8].

130
131

Infection of dermal immune cells precedes infection of epidermal keratinocytes in

132

experimentally-infected NHPs

133

We performed immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded skin

134

samples from these NHPs and showed co-localisation of EGFP and MV nucleoprotein (N)

135

signals in sequential skin sections, which indicated the presence of MV-infected cells. At 9 dpi,

136

the infected cells were predominantly located in the superficial dermis, most especially

137

around the hair follicles and sebaceous glands (Fig 2a – f). Most infection in the epidermis

138

appeared as single-cell infection near dermal papillae and later progressed into multiple-cell

139

infection and syncytia (Fig 2g – i) between 9 and 11 dpi. This epidermal infection later reached

140

the superficial side at 13 dpi, by which time the infection in the dermis already had been

141

cleared. Oedema and spongiosis could be observed at this time point.

143

To identify the phenotype of the infected cells, we performed dual-indirect

144

immunofluorescence (IIF) on these sequential skin sections (Fig 3). CD45+ white blood cells

145

were present in the superficial dermis, most especially in or around blood vessels, hair follicles

146

and sebaceous glands and, to a lesser degree, in the epidermis. Some of these CD45+ white

147

blood cells were CD3+ T cells that were located in the reticular dermis, while some others

148

were S100A8/A9-complex+ (Mac387) macrophages that were abundantly present in the

149

superficial dermis, most especially in or around the blood vessels, hair follicles or sebaceous

150

glands. Cytokeratin+ cells were restricted to the epidermis and pilosebaceous units. In

151

contrast, CD31+ endothelial cells of the blood vessels were restricted to the dermis.

152
153

MV-EGFP+ cells could be found as early as 9 dpi in the dermal papillae. These cells

154

predominantly belonged to the white blood cell phenotype (Fig 3a), which were mostly T cells

155

or macrophages (Fig 3b – c). Some MV-infected cells were present in or surrounding blood

156

vessels (Fig 3d). In some areas in which the infection was more progressed, the infection

157

spread to the epidermis, even into the most superficial layers, which comprised of

158

differentiated keratinocytes (Fig 3e). The MV-infected white blood cells were still detectable

159

in the dermis on day 11, sometimes in close proximity with uninfected white blood cells,

160

mostly macrophages (Fig 3f – h). These cells clustered close to the dermal papillae, where a

161

lot of blood vessels could be found (Fig 3i). Meanwhile, the infection in the epidermis had

162

progressed laterally and apically (Fig 3j). We also observed keratinocytes at the site of

163

infection expressing S100A8/A9 complex (Fig 3h) as a response to inflammatory stimuli. By

164

13 dpi, the dermis was almost clear of the infected cells and was filled with white blood cell

165

infiltrates, mostly macrophages (Fig 3k – m). No MV-infected endothelial cells were observed

166

at this time point (Fig 3n). Infection in the epidermis had mostly resolved, although remaining

167

infected follicular keratinocytes could still be detected (Fig 3o).

168
169

Focal MV skin infection, in which the progression of infection was different in different sites,

170

was observed as early as 9 dpi. More infected cells were observed in the dermis and epidermis

171

in the sites where the infection had progressed further. At the same time point, but in a

172

different site, where the infection has not progressed, individual MV-infected cells were more

173

often found only in the dermis. This suggested that time was not the only important factor in

174

the pathogenesis of MV skin rash. The location in which MV-infected cells could be found and

175

the interaction with surrounding cells could also play a crucial role in establishing infection in

176

the skin. We observed MV-infected white blood cells in dermal papillae or close to the basal

177

epidermis (Fig 4a). MV-infected T cells, although could often be found near the dermal

178

papillae around 9 and 11 dpi, became scarce at 13 dpi and could only be observed in the

179

reticular dermis. At this late time point, the MV-infected T cells were found surrounded by

180

uninfected T cells (Fig 4b). Close interaction could also be observed among MV-infected cells

181

with HLA-DR+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs), for example through a long, EGFP+ dendrite (Fig

182

4c). We observed MV-infected cells surrounded by or in close proximity to endothelial cells

183

(Fig 4d) at 9 dpi at the site where the infection has progressed further. Very rarely, in the

184

same site, we found MV-infected CD31+ endothelial cells near other infected cells (Fig 4e).

185

We also observed MV-infected cells in the dermis that were negative for white blood cell, APC,

186

endothelial cell and epithelial cell markers and appeared to be spindle- or dendritic-like cells

187

(Fig 4f).

189

In the epidermis, a number of MV-infected white blood cells could be observed since 11 dpi,

190

accompanied by infiltration of uninfected white blood cells to the site of infection (Fig 4g – i).

191

These MV-infected white blood cells were negative for keratinocyte, macrophage and T cell

192

markers, thus most likely to be LCs (Fig 4j – k). These cells were found in close proximity to

193

keratinocytes, which were also positive for MV infection (Fig 4k), although keratinocyte

194

infection could still be detected despite the absence of MV-infected white blood cells in the

195

observed two-dimensional plane (Fig 4l).

196
197

Ex vivo MV infection of human skin sheets results in higher infection levels in the dermis

198

than in the epidermis

199

Based on the observations in NHPs, we hypothesised that infection of immune cells in the

200

dermis plays a major role in the pathogenesis of measles skin rash. To test this hypothesis,

201

we ex vivo inoculated human full skin or enzymatically-separated epidermal and dermal

202

sheets with rMV based on a wild-type virus strain Khartoum-Sudan (KS) expressing the

203

fluorescent reporter protein Venus from an additional transcription unit in position 3 of the

204

viral genome (rMVKSVenus(3)). We monitored the infection up to seven days. We observed

205

that Venus+ cells could be detected by inverted laser scanning microscopy as early as 2 dpi,

206

with higher infection levels in the dermis than the epidermis (Fig 5a). The phenotype and the

207

percentage of emigrant MV-infected cells from the skin sheet cultures were determined by

208

flow cytometry. These cells turned out to be CD4+ T cells, APCs and non-lymphocytes. In

209

accordance to the observation on Venus+ cells under the inverted laser scanning microscopy,

210

the percentage of MV-infected cells was higher in the dermis than in the epidermis (Fig 5b).

211

This finding suggested that the dermis is an important site where MV infection is established.

213

Previous studies showed that mature LCs are susceptible to MV infection and Langerin can

214

act as an attachment receptor, but not entry receptor, for the virus [28]. To determine

215

whether LCs play a role in MV epidermal infection as initial target cells, we performed dual-

216

IIF stainings on human epidermal sheets from healthy donors infected with rMVKSVenus(3).

217

We found that despite the abundant presence of LCs in the epidermal sheets, none of these

218

were Venus-positive (S1). This finding suggests that LCs do not play a major role in the

219

pathogenesis of measles skin rash.

220
221

Human primary keratinocytes are susceptible to in vitro MV infection in a nectin-4-

222

dependent manner

223

To investigate the susceptibility and the permissiveness of keratinocytes, we inoculated

224

human primary human keratinocytes derived from two healthy donors or from a patient

225

affected by ectodermal dysplasia-syndactyly syndrome (EDSS1, OMIM 613573), an autosomal

226

recessive disorder caused by mutations in the nectin-4 encoding gene PVRL4 [25]. In this

227

patient, EDSS is secondary to compound heterozygous mutations c.554C>T and c.906delT in

228

the PVRL4 gene (family B in [25]). While the first is a missense mutation (p.Thr185Met)

229

affecting a highly conserved residue of nectin-4 located in its second extracellular

230

immunoglobulin-like domain, the second variant leads to a prematurely truncated protein

231

(p.Pro304HisfsX2). Previous study has shown that in cultured epidermal keratinocytes from

232

this EDSS patient, nectin-4 mRNA displayed nearly 50% reduced expression in line with

233

nonsense mRNA decay of the c.906delT allele, suggesting that all the residual protein

234

expressed on the keratinocyte surface (about 10%) is represented by the p.Thr185Met

235

mutant [25]. In agreement with previously published data, nectin-4 expression on the cell

236

surface was highest in differentiated healthy donors' keratinocytes, as demonstrated by flow

237

cytometry. However, differentiation did not result in increase of nectin-4 expression in the

238

EDSS patient’s keratinocytes (S2) [25]. To determine whether the proliferating and

239

differentiated keratinocytes were susceptible to MV infection, we inoculated them with two

240

MV strains expressing fluorescent reporter proteins (rMVIC323EGFP(1) or rMVKSVenus(3)) [29]

241

or a strain engineered to be unable to recognise nectin-4 (the ‘nectin-4-blind (N4B)’ strain

242

rMVKS-N4bEGFP(3)) [10] at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After 48 hours, we observed

243

higher frequencies of fluorescent cells in differentiated than in the proliferating cells (Fig 6).

244

Infection of keratinocytes with the nectin-4-blind MV resulted in low numbers of single

245

infected cells. Few MV infected cells were detected in the EDSS proliferating and

246

differentiated cultures.

247
248

To assess whether the infected keratinocytes also produced cell-free virus and were thus

249

capable of spreading the infection, the supernatant of the MV-infected keratinocytes was

250

collected and the titre of cell-free virus in the supernatant was assessed [30]. Cell-free MV

251

was detectable in the culture supernatant of the infected proliferating and differentiated

252

keratinocytes. In healthy donors, virus titres in supernatants of differentiated keratinocytes

253

were higher than those in supernatant of proliferating keratinocytes. Interestingly, virus titres

254

of the EDSS patient’s proliferating keratinocytes were comparable to those of the healthy

255

donors (Fig 7a). The difference in virus titres increased as the cells differentiated, since the

256

titre was higher in healthy donors than in the patient.

257
258

Low expression of mutant nectin-4 on the surface of EDSS patient’s keratinocytes could

259

apparently still facilitate MV infection, leading to the production of new viral particles by

260

infected keratinocytes, suggesting that the p.Thr185Met mutation in the second

261

immunoglobulin-like domain does not affect the virus binding. To validate this observation,

262

we transiently transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells with a plasmid

263

containing either wild-type or two mutant nectin-4 (p.Thr185Met) insert. The cells were then

264

inoculated directly with rMVKSVenus(3) at an MOI of 3. Infection efficiency was measured by

265

flow cytometry 24 hours post-infection. Expression levels of both wild-type and mutant

266

nectin-4 was comparable and both nectin-4-transfected cells, but not the mock-transfected

267

cells, proved susceptible to MV infection (Fig 7b), which confirmed that the defective nectin-

268

4 (p.Thr185Met) could still function as a cellular receptor for MV.

269
270

Based on our findings, combined with previously published observations, we postulate a

271

model that describes the progression of MV skin infection and the development of measles

272

rash (Fig 8). The model takes viral tropism, location, interaction and motility of the susceptible

273

cells, as well as the virus-specific immune responses into account. MV-infected cells enter the

274

superficial dermis through the blood vessels and spread the infection to the tissue-resident

275

dermal T cells, APCs and spindle- or dendritic-like cells around 7 dpi. The infection progresses

276

several days later to the adjacent epidermal areas, where the infection is transmitted to the

277

basal keratinocytes. As basal keratinocytes differentiate vertically to the suprabasal layers

278

and their nectin-4 expression increases, the virus spreads laterally and the infected

279

keratinocytes subsequently form syncytia. Infection of dermal endothelial cells was very rare,

280

but not completely absent. We speculate that the infection is subsequently cleared around

281

13 dpi by infiltrating MV-specific T cells, which first migrate into the dermis and later into the

282

epidermis.

285

The pathogenesis of MV skin infection and subsequent skin rash is not well understood. Here,

286

we aimed to identify the cell types involved in MV infection of skin, and the kinetics of viral

287

dissemination in relation to onset of rash. Based on observations from experimentally

288

infected NHPs, ex vivo infected human skin explants and in vitro infected primary

289

keratinocytes, we initially observed MV-infected perivascular, perifollicular and periadnexal

290

dermal immune cells, followed by dissemination to epidermal keratinocytes. Skin infection

291

preceded onset of rash by 3 to 4 days.

292
293

The dermis contains several potential target cells for MV infection. Due to the blood vessels

294

and capillaries that run through it, the dermis is filled with CD150+ lymphoid and myeloid cells

295

that traffic through or reside in the tissue. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells localise and move differently

296

in the skin [31]. Slow-moving CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM) reside in the epidermis and

297

hair follicles, while highly motile CD4+ effector memory T cells (TEM) migrate into the dermis

298

and recirculate systemically [32]. We detected MV-infected T cells in the dermis from 9 dpi

299

onward, but never in the epidermis at that time point. Previous studies have shown that CD4+

300

TEM cells are highly susceptible to MV infection [26, 33]. Interaction of MV-infected T cells

301

with skin-resident APCs may result in further cutaneous spread. T cells have been described

302

in human skin to cluster with APCs around appendages, such as hair follicles [34-36]. We did

303

not observe such T cell clusters in NHPs, most likely due to T cell depletion that occurs

304

systemically and peaks around 9 dpi [26]. Whether this depletion leads to the loss of pre-

305

existing skin-resident memory T cells remains to be studied. Additionally, we and others have

306

observed MV-infected T cells and APCs around hair follicles and sebaceous glands [15, 37],

307

which are surrounded by nectin-4+ epithelial cells [25]. The close proximity of these infected

308

cells to the basal keratinocytes may lead to the spread of MV infection from the dermis to

309

epidermis.

310
311

The epidermis consists predominantly of keratinocytes, which express nectin-4 and are

312

susceptible to MV infection [24]. We were not able to determine the expression of nectin-4

313

in the NHP epidermis due to the lack of cross-reactive antibodies. However, in accordance

314

with the previous study, we show primary human keratinocytes express nectin-4 and its

315

expression is upregulated upon differentiation [25]. We show here that nectin-4 expression

316

plays a role in the susceptibility of keratinocytes to in vitro MV infection: higher expression of

317

nectin-4 resulted in higher susceptibility. This led to the question whether the keratinocytes

318

of an EDSS patient, which have strongly reduced expression of nectin-4, were susceptible to

319

MV infection. We found that, despite its very low expression, the nectin-4 mutant could still

320

facilitate MV infection in vitro. Residual nectin-4 activity in this EDSS patient therefore still

321

allows binding of MV haemagglutinin protein and hence facilitates viral entry. Notably, the

322

missense mutation p.Thr185Met is located in the second immunoglobulin-like domain, while

323

MV-binding interfaces of nectin-4 are located in three loops of its most external domain.

324
325

Another cell type of interest in the epidermis is the LC, a subset of DCs. Although we could

326

not observe MV-infected LCs in our human skin ex vivo model, LCs are known to be

327

susceptible to MV infection [38-40]. The activation status of the cells also determines their

328

susceptibility, since immature LCs are not susceptible to MV infection, while mature ones are

329

[28]. This offers an explanation to why the LCs were not susceptible to MV infection in our ex

330

vivo model: the cells might still have been in their immature state. We were also not able to

331

identify LCs in cynomolgus macaque skin tissues due to the unavailability of cross-reactive

332

antibodies. The susceptibility of LCs to MV infection in vivo and their role in the pathogenesis

333

of measles skin rash remain to be determined. Additionally, LCs express Langerin that can act

334

as an attachment, but not entry, receptor to MV [28] and thus can indirectly introduce MV

335

infection to the epidermal keratinocytes by acting as an attachment hub for the virus from

336

the dermis. Although we were able to clearly identify APCs and T cells in the dermis, we were

337

not able to find HLA-DR+ or CD3+ cells in the epidermis. The involvement of these cells in the

338

pathogenesis of MV infection in the epidermis remains to be elicited.

339
340

DCs and macrophages occupy the dermis as professional APCs and phagocytes, respectively.

341

Macrophages are present in high numbers and are associated with blood or lymphatic vessels,

342

while dermal DCs have been found to form clusters with T cells, suggesting the presence of

343

an inducible structure of macrophages, DCs and T cells that may function as a skin-associated

344

lymphoid tissue [41, 42]. In the respiratory tract, DCs and macrophages act as Trojan horses

345

during MV infection by spreading the virus to the lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes [7,

346

43-46]. Migrating or patrolling MV-infected DCs and macrophages may play the same role in

347

the skin as they do in the respiratory tract. However, these cells may also play a crucial role

348

as innate immune cells that inhibit infection. Close communication of MV-infected DCs and

349

macrophages with T cells can lead to activation of MV-specific immune responses and

350

subsequently to the development of rash. The role of these immune responses in the

351

development of rash has been highlighted in immunocompromised patients with MV

352

infection that do not develop skin rash [14].

353
354

Blood vessels and capillaries run through the dermis. The capillaries penetrate into the dermal

355

papillae, from where the distance to the epidermis is minimal, and the distribution of the
16

356

capillary loops differs according to the type of the skin. The capillary bed consists of an

357

arteriole, which gives rise to metarterioles and subsequently hundreds of capillaries. The

358

capillaries provide the dermis and epidermis with nutrition and oxygen, and connect to

359

venous capillarioles and further to a venule. Inflammation due to infection may cause

360

prolonged vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability. This hyperaemic reaction

361

allows the release of chemokines by skin-resident cells, such as memory immune cells and

362

keratinocytes, that leads to the infiltration of various immune cells, such as macrophages and

363

lymphocytes. The vasodilatation also causes erythema and oedema [47]. Given that measles

364

rash is described as maculopapular (i.e. small with raised bumps) and erythematous (i.e. red),

365

and oedema can be observed in MV-infected skin [15], we speculate that hyperaemia is

366

responsible for the appearance of the erythematous maculopapular rash. Although

367

theoretically it is possible to investigate the presence of hyperaemia in our in vivo model by

368

showing an increased number of erythrocytes in the cutaneous blood vessels, we could not

369

perform the calculation fairly, since the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination.

370
371

MV infection in the skin gives a unique appearance of rash compared to other viral

372

exanthemata. Rubella rash, for example, has been described as macroscopically similar to

373

measles rash, since it gives a pink-reddish “rubelliform” maculopapular rash. However, in

374

rubella, viral infection takes place deeper in the dermis, in contrast to measles skin infection

375

that occurs more superficially in the dermis. Infection of the keratinocytes, which is typical

376

for measles rash, does not occur during rubella virus infection [48]. In contrast, varicella zoster

377

virus (VZV), as a representative of the Herpesviridae family member, has similar target cells

378

in the dermis and epidermis as MV, but displays a different type of rash. VZV infects

379

perivascular macrophages and DCs as well as keratinocytes, but the infection leads to the

380

appearance of spots that turn into itchy blisters [49]. Arboviral exanthemata, on the other

381

hand, have a different route of infection, but often present overlapping outcomes in the skin.

382

Dengue virus is introduced into the body through a mosquito bite and injected into the

383

bloodstream, with spillover to the epidermis and the dermis. This spillover causes infection

384

of LCs and keratinocytes. Dengue virus spreads systemically through the infection of

385

monocytes and macrophages. The virus also causes vascular leakage through infection of

386

endothelial cells, leading to the appearance of minor haemorrhagic lesions [50]. Although

387

petechial rash is one of the clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection, morbilliform rash

388

is also often described during classical dengue fever [51]. Altogether, these findings, including

389

ours, strongly suggest that the appearance of rash, especially during measles, is closely linked

390

to the viral tropism, the availability and location of susceptible target cells and the subsequent

391

immune responses to clear the infection.

392
393

MV infects the respiratory epithelial cells and is shed apically into the mucus lining the lumen

394

of the upper and lower respiratory tract, which is void of CD150 or nectin-4. The virus is thus

395

transported to the throat by the mucociliary escalator and expelled into the air by coughing

396

[52]. The role of MV skin infection in viral transmission is still a subject of speculation. The

397

outer layer of the epidermis consists of dead keratinised cells. Whether these dead cells allow

398

the attachment of MV and hence the release of dead-cell-associated virus particles into the

399

air remains to be investigated [15].

400
401

In conclusion, our study offers a new explanation to the pathogenesis of measles skin rash:

402

MV-infected lymphocytes and myeloid cells enter the dermis, where the infection spreads to

403

the susceptible cells in the vicinity of dermal papillae, hair follicles, sebaceous glands and

404

blood vessels in the superficial dermis. The infection spreads laterally and apically to the

405

epidermis in a nectin-4-dependent manner. The infection is cleared several days later by

406

infiltrating MV-specific T cells, accompanied by the appearance of oedema and hyperaemia

407

that give the appearance of an erythematous morbilliform rash.

Tissues

438

Residual skin materials were obtained from six different adult human donors undergoing

439

correctional surgery and stored at 4° C overnight. The skin was shaved using a dermatome

440

(0.3 mm, Zimmer Biomet, UK). For the preparation of full skin sheets, which consist of dermis

441

and epidermis, the shaved skin was cut into circular sheets (diameter approximately 1 cm)

penicillin/ml, 100 µg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine and 20 µg/ml

444

gentamicine (Centrafarm, Netherlands) (I10F medium), with the epidermis facing upward.

445

The full skin pieces were stored in a 24-well plate in I10F medium. For the preparation of

446

epidermal sheets, shaved skin was incubated in I10F medium in the presence of 1 U/ml of

447

dispase (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37° C or 0.5 U/ml overnight at 4° C. The epidermis was

448

separated from dermis using a pair of forceps and cut into circular sheets using a skin biopsy

480

Adherent primary keratinocytes were either inoculated directly or were treated with trypsin-

481

EDTA (0.05%) and inoculated in suspension with the three different rMV strains at an MOI of

482

1. After 2 h, the suspension cells were washed to remove unbound virus and seeded onto 24-

483

well plates in K medium. After 48 h of infection, the cells were observed under an inverted-

484

laser scanning LSM-700 microscope (Zeiss) and the infection percentages were assessed by

485

flow cytometry. Transiently transfected HEK 293T cells were inoculated directly with

486

rMVKSVenus(3) at an MOI of 3. After 24 h of infection, the infection percentages were

Ex vivo MV infection

490

Full skin pieces, dermal or epidermal sheets were inoculated with cell-free rMVKSVenus(3).

491

Briefly, 200 µl of pure virus stock (3.7  106 TCID50/ml) was added to each well of a 24-well

492

plate, and the skin sheets were added on top of the liquid with the epidermis facing upwards.

493

While full skin and epidermal sheets remained afloat, dermal sheets tended to sink and both

494

apical and basolateral surfaces were exposed to virus. After 2 h at 37°C, I10F medium was

495

added to the wells. The progression of infection was observed at 2, 4 and 7 dpi under the

496

inverted laser scanning microscope. Full skin pieces, dermal or epidermal sheets were fixed

497

in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for at least 24 h and subsequently stored in PBS or as formalin-

Flow cytometry

506

Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCanto II. Primary keratinocytes or HEK 293T

507

cells were labelled with nectin-4PE antibody (clone 337516; R&D Systems) to assess the

508

expression of nectin-4. Isotype control (IsotypePE, clone 27-35, BD Biosciences) antibody was

509

included to assess the level of background staining. NCI-H358 cells and BLCL were included as

510

positive and negative controls for nectin-4 expression, respectively. All cells were fixed with

511

2% of PFA prior to measurement of the percentage of cells expressing the virus-encoded

512

fluorescent protein. Mock-infected cells were included as infection control. Supernatants

513

from full skin pieces (n = 3 donors), dermal (n = 1 donor) or epidermal sheets (n = 3 donors)

514

were isolated at 2, 4 and 7 dpi and emigrant cells were isolated after undergoing

11 (b and e) and 13 (c and f) dpi. (a and d) Most MV N+ cells could be found in the dermal

747

papillae, although a few single infected cells were detected in the basal layer of the epidermis

748

at 9 dpi. (b and e) At 11 dpi, prominent infection was observed near hair follicle and sebaceous

749

gland (arrow). The infection in the epidermis has progressed further in the suprabasal layers

750

(arrows). (c and f) The infection in the dermis was no longer detected at 13 dpi. The infection

751

in the epidermis had reached the most superficial layers. (g – i) A syncytium (ellipse) in the

Fig 8. Model for pathogenesis of measles skin rash. During viremia, MV-infected T cells and

820

macrophages migrate to the dermis via the capillaries and interact with (a) tissue-resident

821

lymphoid and myeloid cells and epidermal LCs residing near the basal lamina. This interaction

822

leads to the infection of surrounding CD150+ tissue-resident immune cells and nectin-4+

823

epithelial cells. Alternatively, MV-infected T cells and macrophages migrate in close proximity

824

to: (b) the hair follicle or (c) the sebaceous gland via the capillary, where they infect an

825

aggregate of tissue-resident T cells and macrophages, and further spread the infection to

826

nearby keratinocytes and LCs. Infection of basal keratinocytes leads to lateral and apical

827

spread of the virus to the superficial layers of the epidermis. Several days later, (d)

828

hyperaemic responses allow the recruitment of MV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and

829

macrophages, resulting in (e) recognition and (f) clearance of the infected cells. Hyperaemia

830

and subsequent oedema are the histological correlates of maculopapular erythematous

831

measles rash.

S1. MV-infected LCs were not observed after ex vivo infection of human epidermal sheets.

834

LCs (magenta) were present in abundance in human epidermal sheets. MV-infected cells

835

(green) appeared at 2 dpi and their number increased by 4 dpi. However, none of these

836

infected cells were LCs. Magenta: CD1a; Green: GFP; Blue: DAPI. Scale bars: 200 µm.

838

S2. Nectin-4 was expressed at a relatively low level in proliferating human primary

839

keratinocytes. The expression level increased during differentiation. The expression of

840

nectin-4 was abrogated in EDSS patient’s keratinocytes and differentiation did not result in

841

increased nectin-4 expression. NCI-H358 and BLCL were included as positive and negative

842

controls of nectin-4 expression, respectively.
