ABSTRACT
Astrocytes play a number of key functions in health and disease. Reactivation of astrocytes occurs
in most, if not all, neurological diseases. Most current information on the mechanisms underlying
astrogliosis derives from studies using rodent experimental systems, mainly because the ability to
study human astrocytes under healthy and pathological conditions has been hampered by the
difficulty in obtaining primary human astrocytes. Here we describe robust and reliable derivation
of astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Phenotypically characterized
human iPSC-derived astrocytes exhibit typical traits of physiological astrocytes, including
spontaneous and induced calcium transients. Moreover, human iPSC-derived astrocytes respond
to stimulation with a pro-inflammatory combination of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1alpha, and complement component C1q by undergoing changes in gene expression patterns
suggesting acquisition of a reactive astrocyte phenotype. Together, these findings provide evidence
suggesting that human iPSC-derived astrocytes are a suitable experimental model system to study
astrocyte function and reactivation in healthy and pathological conditions of the human nervous
system.

1. INTRODUCTION
Astrocytes play a number of important roles in the healthy nervous system by supporting
neuronal activity in several ways, including regulation of synaptic transmission, release of
neurotrophic factors, promotion of neuronal metabolic functions, and cross-talk with other glial
cells, to name only a few [reviewed by Zhou et al., 2019; Zuchero and Barres, 2015]. Astrocytes
are also important players in the injured or diseased nervous system, when they can acquire
‘reactive’ phenotypes, characterized by morphological and gene expression changes during a
process often termed astrogliosis [reviewed by Liddelow and Barres, 2017; Siracusa et al., 2019;
Valori et al., 2019]. Reactive astrocytes mediate a variety of mechanisms, including release of
cytokines and chemokines that can participate in complex neuroinflammatory processes,
intercellular communication with microglia involved in immune responses, and modulation of
immune cell activation at damaged sites. Reactive astrocytes are thought to contribute to either
neuroprotective or neuroinflammatory responses depending on the local microenvironment,
although evidence exists that astrogliosis is often a complex process characterized by a
combination of both inflammatory and protective effects depending on the stage of the damage or
injury process [Li et al., 2019; Liddelow and Barres, 2017; Yamanaka and Komine, 2018].
Astrocyte reactivation is a common event in virtually all neurological diseases [Li et al., 2019;
Liddelow and Barres, 2017; Siracusa et al., 2019; Yamanaka and Komine, 2018]. For instance,
hallmarks of astrocyte activation feature prominently in post-mortem tissues from amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, as well as in the spinal cord and cranial motor nuclei in ALS
transgenic mouse models [Anneser et al., 2004; Baron et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2014; Ferraiuolo
et al., 2007; Poloni et al., 2000; Schiffer et al., 1996]. More importantly, increasing evidence
suggests that reactive astrocytes contribute directly to the degeneration of motor circuits in ALS

animal models by promoting non-cell autonomous mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration
[Diaz-Amarilla et al., 2011; Ferraiuolo, 2014; Haidet-Phillips et al., 2011; Ouali Alami et al.,
2018; Radford et al., 2015; Yamanaka and Komine, 2018].
Progress in understanding how astrocytes contribute to human neurological diseases has been
slow, at least in part due to the fact that most information on the mechanisms underlying
astrogliosis has emerged from studies with rodent experimental model systems. There is evidence
that rodent and human astrocytes exhibit a number of gene expression and functional differences
suggesting that rodent astrocytes may not always represent informative model systems for human
astrocytes, especially in neurodegenerative conditions [Oberheim et al., 2009; Tarassishin et al.,
2014; Zhang et al., 2016]. Moreover, the paucity of studies based on human primary astrocytes
has limited the ability to study human astrocytes carrying the genetic alterations found in familial
form of neurodegenerative diseases, thus affecting the goal of complementing studies using
experimental animal models with human cell-based models. This situation has recently started to
change due to progress in the application of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies in
the generation of human iPSC-derived astrocytes [Serio et al., 2013; Shaltouki et al., 2013; Tcw
et al., 2017]. This remarkable progress offers previously unavailable experimental opportunities
to study human astrocyte biology, model astrocyte pathophysiological mechanisms in vitro, and
design large-scale screens of new potential therapeutic compounds targeting astrocytes.
Here we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of astrocytes derived from
human iPSCs, and show that these human iPSC-derived astrocytes display molecular and
biological features typical of physiological astrocytes. In particular, human iPSC-derived
astrocytes respond to astrogliosis-inducing conditions by undergoing changes in gene expression
patterns suggestive of a transition to a reactive phenotype. These findings suggest that human

iPSC-derived astrocytes represent physiologically-informative experimental model systems to
study astrocyte function and reactivation in healthy and diseased conditions of the human nervous
system.

2. METHODS
2.1. Human iPSC lines
Human iPSC line NCRM-1 (male) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health Stem
Cell Resource (Bethesda, MD, USA). AJG-001-C4 control iPSC line was established from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from a 37-year-old male through episomal
reprogramming. AIW-002-02 iPSC line was established from PBMC obtained from a 37-year-old
male through retrovirus reprogramming. These procedures were conducted under Ethical Review
Board approval by McGill University. Both AJG 001-C4 and AIW-002-2 iPSC lines were
generated at the Montreal Neurological Institute through the Open Biorepository, C-BIGR, under
an Open Science framework. Pluripotent state of human iPSC lines was routinely assessed by
testing for expression of the stem cell markers NANOG and OCT4.

2.2. Derivation of neural progenitor cells from human iPSCs
Human iPSCs at low passage number were cultured in mTeSR medium (STEMCELL
Technologies; Vancouver, BC, Canada; Cat. No. 85850) in 10-cm culture dishes (Thermo-Fisher
Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA; Cat. No. 353003) coated with Matrigel (Thermo-Fisher Scientific;
Waltham, MA, USA; Cat. No. 08-774-552) until they reached 70%-80% confluence. At this time
point (designated as day in vitro 0 - DIV0), the culture medium was removed, cells were rinsed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (5 ml) and detached by addition of ‘Gentle Dissociation

Reagent’ (3 ml) (STEMCELL Technologies; Cat. No. 07174) stored at room temperature. After
3-5 minutes in Gentle Dissociation Reagent, cells were recovered and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon
tube (Corning; Corning, NY, USA; Cat. No. 352070). Dulbecco's minimum essential medium
(DMEM)/F12 medium (Life Technologies; 10565-018) was added (7 ml), followed by
centrifugation at 1,300 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in mTeSR medium (1 ml)
and transferred into 6-well plates coated with Matrigel. Cells were seeded at 15%-25% confluence
and cultured in mTeSR medium (2 ml) in the presence of the Rock inhibitor Y-27632 (Stemgent;
Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat. No. 04-0012) at 37°C. The next day (designated DIV1), culture
medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of ‘Neural Induction Medium 1’ [DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with 1% N2 (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 17504-044), 2% B27 (Life Technologies;
Cat. No. 17502-048), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 15260037), 2 µM SB431542 reagent (Tocris Bioscience; Bristol, UK; Cat. No. 1614), 200 ng/ml Noggin
(PeproTech; Rocky Hill, NJ, USA; Cat. No. 120-10c), 1 mM GlutaMax (Life Technologies; Cat.
No. 35050-061), 1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 11140-050), 1 µg/ml
laminin (Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. L2020), 50 U/ml penicillin G, 50 mg/ml
streptomycin (Life Technologies; Cat. No. 15140-122)]. This culture medium was changed (2.5
ml) every two days and cells were cultured until DIV4, when cells received fresh medium (5 ml)
and were cultured until they reached confluence (usually by DIV7).
At DIV7, Neural Induction Medium 1 was replaced with 5 ml of ‘Neural Induction Medium 2’
(DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1% N2, 2% B27, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM GlutaMax, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 µg/ml laminin, 50 U/ml penicillin G, 50 mg/ml streptomycin). Medium
was replaced every day until DIV12, when cells were dissociated by incubation with Accutase
(Innovative Cell Technologies; San Diego, CA, USA; Cat. No. AT-104) at 37 oC for 3-5 min and

transferred to either Petri dishes or ‘low attachment’ dishes (Fisher Scientific; Cat. No.
FB0875712), followed by culture in ‘Neural Progenitor Cell (NPC) Expansion Medium’
[DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1% N2, 2% B27, 20 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech; Cat. No.
AF-100-15), 20 ng/ml FGF2 (PeproTech; Cat. No. 450-18b), 1 mM GlutaMax, 1% non-essential
amino acids, 1 µg/ml laminin, 50 U/ml penicillin G, 50 mg/ml streptomycin] in the presence of
Rock inhibitor Y-27632. Cells were then cultured until formation of free-floating cellular spheres
(‘neurospheres’), which usually occurred in 2 to 3 days.
In each differentiation procedure, neurospheres were collected using a 40 µm Nylon mesh cell
strainer (Corning; Cat. No. 352340) placed over a 50-ml Falcon tube. Cells recovered on cell
strainer were rinsed with PBS (5 ml) and then transferred to a 10-cm Matrigel-coated culture dish
by flushing with 10 ml NPC Expansion Medium. Another cycle of neurosphere formation and
isolation was usually performed by repeating the same steps in order to increase the number of
NPCs obtained. On average, ~90% of induced cells were positive for the expression of NPC
markers SOX1, SOX2, and PAX6. NPCs obtained following this protocol can be frozen and stored
in liquid nitrogen, with usually good cell survival rates upon thawing.

2.3. Differentiation of astrocytes from human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells
Induced human NPCs were differentiated into astrocytes essentially as described previously
[Tcw et al., 2017], with minor modifications. In each derivation, NPCs were seeded at low cell
density (15,000 cells/cm2) in two T25 flasks in the presence of 5 ml of NPC expansion medium
containing Rock inhibitor. The following day, medium was replaced with ‘Astrocyte
Differentiation Medium 1’ [ScienCell Astrocyte Growth Medium (ScienCell Research
Laboratories; Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat. No. 1801b), astrocyte growth supplement (ScienCell

Research Laboratories; Cat. No. 1852), 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ScienCell Research
Laboratories; Cat. No. 0010), 50 U/ml penicillin G, 50 mg/ml streptomycin]. Half medium was
replaced with fresh medium every 3 to 4 days and cells were maintained under these culture
conditions for 30 days without passaging. On average, at least 75% of induced cells were positive
for the expression of astrocytes markers, such as S100beta (S100b), connexin 43, and aquaporin 4
(AQ4) after 30 days. At this stage, induced astrocytes were proliferative and were either cultured
further or frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. For the purpose of continued culture,
induced astrocytes were switched to ‘Astrocyte Differentiation Medium 2’ (same as Astrocyte
Differentiation Medium 1 but lacking FBS) after 30 days and then cultured under these conditions
for 2-3 months, depending on the experimental endpoints. Induced astrocytes were routinely
examined for the expression of GFAP, S100b, and AQ4.

2.4. Characterization of human iPSC-derived cells by immunocytochemistry
Cultured human iPSCs, induced NPCs and astrocytes were analyzed by immunocytochemistry,
which was performed as described previously [Methot et al., 2018]. The following primary
antibodies were used: rabbit anti-NANOG (1:500; Abcam; Cambridge, UK; Cat. No. Ab21624);
goat anti-OCT3/4 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Dallas, TX; Cat. No. Sc-8628); goat antiSOX1 (1/500; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cat. No. AF3369); goat anti-SOX2 (1/500;
R&D Systems, Cat. No. AF2018); rabbit anti-PAX6 (1/500; Covance; Emeryville, CA, USA; Cat.
No. PRB-278P); mouse anti-NESTIN (1/500; Millipore; Cat. No. MAB5326); mouse anti-glial
fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (1/1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. G3893);
mouse anti-S100b (1/1,000; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. No. S2532); rabbit anti-AQ4 (1:500; SigmaAldrich; Cat. No. HPA014784). Secondary antibodies against primary reagents raised in various

species were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555, Alexa Fluor 488, or Alexa Fluor 350 (1/1,000,
Invitrogen; Burlington, ON, Canada). Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1
Inverted Microscope using 20X magnification and a ZEISS Axiocam 506 mono camera.

2.5. Detection of calcium transients in human iPSC-derived astrocytes
Sixty days after the start of the differentiation protocol, human iPSC-derived astrocytes were
incubated with the calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM (1µM; ThermoFisher Scientific; Carlsbad, CA;
Cat. No. F14201) for 30 minutes, followed by two rinsing steps with ScienCell Astrocyte Growth
Medium (Cat. No. 1801b), supplemented with antibiotics, for 10 min each. Time-lapse microscopy
was then performed at 0.5 Hz with a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Inverted Microscope using 20X
magnification and a ZEISS Axiocam 506 mono camera. Temperature (37°C), humidity and CO2
(5%) were maintained constant throughout the course of the experiments through TempModule S
and CO2 moduleS devices (PeCon GmbH; Erbach, Germany). LED 488 nm was set at 20% and
exposure time was 200 ms to avoid phototoxicity. For spontaneous calcium wave acquisition,
recording was conducted for 5 min and focus stabilisation was achieved with the use of Zeiss
Definite focus every 30 images. For induced calcium wave acquisition, recording was performed
for 1 min, before the addition of either 10µM glutamate or 10µM ATP, followed by recording for
an additional 4 min.

2.6. Treatment of human iPSC-derived astrocytes with TNFa, IL-1a, and C1q
Sixty days after the start of the differentiation protocol, human iPSC-derived astrocytes were
incubated with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) (30 ng/ml; Cell Sciences; Newburyport, MA;

Cat. No. CRT100B), interleukin alpha (IL-1a) (3 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. No. I3901-5UG) and
complement component 1, subcomponent q (C1q) (400 ng/ml; MyBioSource; San Diego, CA; Cat.
No. MBS143105) for 24 hours, followed by RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Each cell pellet
was lysed in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany; Cat. No. 79306) and total RNA
extracted with the miRNEasy Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 217004) following the instructions provided
by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed on total RNA fractions to obtain cDNA
in 40 µl volume containing 400 ng of total RNA, 0.5 µg oligoDT(16) primers, 0.5 mM dNTPs,
0.01 M DTT, and 400 U M-MLV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific; Cat. No.
28025013). Real-time PCR experiments were performed using a QuantStudio 3 Real Time PCR
system (ThermoFisher Scientific) in a 10 µl total reaction volume containing 5 µl of fast advanced
master mix, 1 µl 20X taqman assay (Thermofisher Scientific), 1 µl of cDNA and 3 µl of RNAsefree water. Analysis of gene expression was conducted using the following oligonucleotide
primers: Taqman probes SERGLYCIN, Hs01004159_m1; IL-1beta, Hs01555410_m1; TNF-alpha,
Hs 00174128_m1; SERPING1, Hs00163781_m1, GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE (GLUL),
Hs00365928_g1; SLC1A3/EAAT1/GLAST, Hs00904823_g1; VIMENTIN, Hs00958111_m1;
GFAP, Hs00909233_m1; ACTB Hs01060665_g1; GAPDH Hs02786624_g1). Primers/probesets
used were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific. Data were normalized with beta-actin and
GAPDH. Relative quantification (RQ) was estimated according to the ∆∆Ct method [Schmittgen
and Livak, 2008].

3. RESULTS
3.1. In vitro generation and molecular characterization of neural progenitor cells from
human iPSCs
Neural induction of human iPSCs (three different lines were used) was stimulated by inhibiting
TGF-b/BMP-4 signaling using SB431542 compound in combination with Noggin as described in
the Methods section. Neuralized cells were tested for the expression of NPC markers, including
NESTIN, SOX1, SOX2, and PAX6, 7-14 days after the start of neural induction (DIV 7-14). The
majority of neuralized cells expressed these NPC markers at DIV14 (Figure 1). In contrast, little
or no expression of the stem cell markers NANOG and OCT-4 was detected at DIV14
(Supplemental Figure S1). These results provide evidence of robust generation of induced cells
with features of NPCs from the different human iPSC lines used in these in vitro studies.

3.2. In vitro differentiation and molecular characterization of astrocytes from human iPSCs
Astroglial differentiation of human iPSC-derived NPCs was promoted by exposure to a defined
astrocyte medium from ScienCell, as previously described [Tcw et al., 2017], and as detailed in
the Methods section. Under these culture conditions, induced cells exhibiting morphological and
immunological features of astrocytes were already detectable at DIV30 (Figure S2). At DIV60,
many induced cells (~70%-75% on average) were positive for the expression of both S100b and
GFAP, two classical markers of astrocyte identity (Figure 2A). Induced cells also expressed
additional astrocyte-enriched proteins/genes, including the gap junction protein connexin 43
(Figure 2B), and the genes VIMENTIN, GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE (GLUL), and EXCITATORY
AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER 1 (EAAT1/ SLC1A3/GLAST) (Figure 2C). Expression levels of
these genes varied between astrocytes derived from different human iPSC lines (cf. Figures 2 and

4 below). At DIV90, human iPSC-derived astroglial cells exhibited mainly flattened
morphologies, which included star-shaped cells (Figure 2D). Together, these findings show robust
generation of induced cells from human iPSCs with molecular and morphological traits typical of
astrocytes in vitro.

3.3. Human iPSC-derived astrocytes display spontaneous, ATP-induced and glutamateinduced calcium waves
Cytoplasmic Ca2+ level fluctuations represent a key component of astrocytic intercellular
signaling [Shigetomi et al., 2016]. To determine whether human iPSC-derived astrocytes would
exhibit spontaneous and/or induced calcium transients, DIV60 astrocytes were incubated with the
Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-4 AM, in the absence (spontaneous Ca2+ transients) or presence of pulses of
extracellular glutamate (10 µM) or ATP (10 µM) (induced Ca2+ transients). Human iPSC-derived
astrocytes displayed spontaneous calcium spikes, suggestive of intercellular signaling among
interconnected cells (Figure 3A). Moreover, a single application of either glutamate or ATP
resulted in calcium wave responses (Figures 3B, C). Together, these results provide evidence that
human iPSC-derived astrocytes display calcium transients in vitro similar to those exhibited by
physiological astrocytes, suggesting further that human iPSCs can serve as sources of biologicallyrelevant human astrocytes.

3.4. Human iPSC-derived astrocytes acquire a reactive phenotype after exposure to tumor
necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1-alpha and complement C1q
Previous studies have shown that primary rodent brain astrocytes respond to exposure to a
combination of TNFa, IL-1a, and C1q by upregulating the expression of several genes associated
with an ‘A1-type’ reactive astrocyte phenotype [Clarke et al., 2018; Liddelow et al., 2017]. To
determine whether human iPSC-derived astrocytes would respond in a similar manner to treatment
with TNFa, IL-1a and C1q, we exposed DIV60 astrocytes to these factors for 24 hours, followed
by analysis of gene expression by real time RT-PCR. These studies showed that transcripts
previously associated with an A1-type reactive astrocyte phenotype in rodent cells, such as
SERGLYCIN and SERPING1, were upregulated in human iPSC-derived astrocytes (Figure 4A, B).
Moreover, treatment with TNFa, IL-1a, and C1q led to increased levels of two genes, EAAT1 and
GLUL, previously shown to be induced in reactive astrocytes (Bellaver et al., 2017; Beschorner et
al., 2007) (Fig. 4C-D). Consistent with these findings, treated human iPSC-derived astrocytes also
displayed increased levels of neuroinflammatory cytokine-encoding transcripts, such as TNFa and
IL-1b (Figure 4E, F). Based on these results, we examined further whether TNFa/IL-1a/C1qstimulated human iPSC-derived astrocytes would display a pro-inflammatory phenotype by
monitoring the levels of transcripts encoding intermediate filament proteins, such as GFAP and
VIMENTIN, which are usually upregulated in pro-inflammatory reactive astrocytes (Clarke et al.,
2018; Liddelow et al., 2017; Zamanian et al., 2012). Unexpectedly, neither of these transcripts
was increased, rather levels were either decreased or not obviously affected (Figure 4G, H). Similar
results were obtained in astrocytes derived from different human iPSC lines (Figure S3). Taken
together, these findings provide evidence that human iPSC-induced astrocytes respond to exposure
to inflammatory conditions by acquiring a mixed reactive phenotype. These results in turn imply

that human iPSC-derived astrocytes may provide an informative experimental model system to
study the roles of astrocytes in health and disease.

4. DISCUSSION
Numerous studies are providing increasing evidence that neuronal degeneration in a number of
neurodegenerative diseases is not only driven by cell-autonomous mechanisms of neuronal death,
but is also promoted by non-cell autonomous processes underlying communication between
neuronal and glial cells, including astrocytes [Li et al., 2019; Liddelow and Barres, 2017; Siracusa
et al., 2019; Yamanaka and Komine, 2018].
A documented example of astrocyte involvement in neurodegeneration is provided by ALS,
where an abnormal activation of astrocytes was initially suggested from the analysis of postmortem tissues, cerebrospinal fluids and blood samples from ALS patients [Schiffer et al., 1996;
Anneser et al., 2004; Baron et al., 2005; Poloni et al., 2000]. In agreement with these observations,
marked neuroinflammation was observed in the spinal cord and cranial motor nuclei of ALS
transgenic mouse models [Schiffer et al., 1996; Ferraiuolo et al., 2007; Evans et al., 2014].
Furthermore, several independent studies, based mainly on in vitro cultures of neural cells derived
from ALS transgenic mice, provide evidence suggesting that astrocytes harbouring mutated
superoxide dismutase 1 are toxic to primary, as well as pluripotent stem cell-derived, motor
neurons, but not to other neuronal populations [Di Giorgio et al., 2008; Marchetto et al., 2008;
Nagai et al., 2007].
It is hypothesized that astrocytes may exert deleterious effects on motor neurons in ALS as a
consequence of either gain of toxic functions or loss of supportive functions (or a combination of
both). Examples of gain-of-function effects include transmission of mutated proteins such as

superoxide dismutase 1, production of reactive oxygen species causing motor neuron
hyperexcitability and degeneration, inhibition of autophagy mechanisms in motor neurons, and
transmission of extracellular vesicle-transported toxic microRNA species, to name only a few
[Fritz at al., 2014; Rojas et al., 2015; Tripathi et al., 2017; Varcianna et al., 2019; Yamanaka and
Komine, 2018].
Progress in understanding the roles of astrocytes in neurological diseases has been hampered
by the limited availability of primary human astrocyte cultures, the limited viability of primary
cultures of human astrocytes, as well as the observation that rodent and human astrocytes differ at
both transcriptional and functional levels, which suggest that the rodent astrocyte models studied
to date may not always represent optimal systems for understanding the pathobiology of human
astrocytes [Oberheim et al., 2009; Tarassishin et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016]. This situation has
recently started to change thanks to the increasing availability of human iPSC-based protocols to
achieve robust and reliable generation of human astrocytes [e.g., Serio et al., 2013; Shaltouki et
al., 2013; Tcw et al., 2017]. Progress in this field of research now offers previously unavailable
human experimental model systems to study the biological functions of human astrocyte biology,
as well as to model astrocyte pathophysiological mechanisms in vitro. Moreover, human iPSCderived astrocytes have the potential to provide informative platforms for large-scale screens of
new potential therapeutic compounds targeting astrocyte-mediated neurotoxic mechanisms.
In the present studies, we have described the derivation and characterization of astrocytes from
a number of different human iPSC lines and have provided evidence that these cells display
molecular and biological properties resembling those of physiological astrocytes. In particular,
human iPSC-derived astrocytes can respond to stimulation with a pro-inflammatory combination
of TNFa, IL-1a, and C1q, which are secreted by activated microglia during neuroinflammatory

processes and can lead to astrocyte activation [Liddelow et al., 2017], by upregulating the levels
of a number of transcripts encoding molecules previously associated with a reactive astrocyte
phenotype. Interestingly, elevated levels of genes previously associated with neurotoxic reactive
astrocytes, such as SERGLYCIN, SERPING1, GLUL and TNFa [Bellaver et al., 2017; Fernandes
et al., 2016; Liddelow et al., 2017] is not accompanied by a concurrent increase in the levels of
transcripts encoding intermediate filament proteins like GFAP and VIMENTIN. Increased levels
of GFAP and VIMENTIN are considered a typical feature of pro-inflammatory reactive astrocytes
(Clarke et al., 2018; Liddelow et al., 2017; Zamanian et al., 2012). This situation was correlated
with increased levels of EAAT1, encoding a glutamate transporter upregulated in reactive
astrocytes with a predicted neuroprotective phenotype [Berschorner et al., 2007]. Together, these
findings show a multifaceted pattern of gene expression changes in human iPSC-derived astrocytes
exposed to inflammatory molecules under serum-free conditions, suggesting that human iPSCderived astrocytes may provide informative experimental model systems to study the complex
biological changes underlying reactive astrogliosis.
The derivation and characterization of human iPSC-derived astrocytes will facilitate the
study of the properties and functions of different types of human astrocytes, leading to progress in
our understanding of human astrocyte biology. Moreover, they will provide previously unavailable
disease-relevant human experimental models to study neurological diseases. In turn, deeply
phenotyped disease-relevant astrocytes may provide new experimental model systems to develop
cellular assays that may contribute to early-stage drug discovery efforts benefitting neurological
and mental health conditions.
