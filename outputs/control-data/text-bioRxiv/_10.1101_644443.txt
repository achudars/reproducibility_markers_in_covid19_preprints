Abstract (≤250 words)

Background: Meiotic recombination is mainly, but not exclusively, initiated by Spo11induced double strand breaks (DSBs) in some sexual eukaryotes. DSBs are repaired by one or
two RecA-like recombinases (ubiquitous Rad51 and meiosis-specific Dmc1). In yeast and
mammals, Dmc1 is superior to Rad51 in tolerating mismatched sequences during highly
polymorphic hybrid meiosis. The mechanisms underlying Rad51-only meiotic recombination
remain less studied.
Results: The Rad51-only filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei has only one spo11 gene.
Removal of spo11 from T. reesei genome does not affect normal sexual development, meiosis
or chromosome synapsis, but results in decrease of interhomolog recombination products to
70%, crossover homeostasis and lower genetic interference. Our results also suggest that T.
reesei Rad51, like yeast and mammalian Dmc1 (but not Rad51), can tolerate mismatched
sequences during meiotic recombination. Moreover, Topoisomerase II might act redundantly
(and predominantly) with Spo11 to initiate meiotic recombination.
Conclusion: We suggest that T. reesei is an emerging model for studying Spo11-independent
and Rad51-only meiosis.

Background
Homologous interactions (e.g., pairing, recombination and synapsis) between maternal and
paternal homologous chromosomes are the central theme of meiosis because they generate
genetic diversity in haploid gametes and, upon fertilization, in the offspring. The interhomolog
crossover (CO) products are also required for proper segregation of parental chromosomes
during the first meiotic division (reviewed in [1]).
In almost all studied model eukaryotes, Spo11-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
are responsible for initiation of meiotic recombination. Spo11 is a meiosis-specific
Topoisomerase VII subunit A endonuclease [2, 3]. There is considerable evidence indicating
that Spo11-independent DSBs and/or meiotic recombination proceed in some sexual
eukaryotes [4-7]. Uniquely, as far as is known among sexual eukaryotes, dictyostelids (i.e.,
social amoebae) lack a spo11 gene [8]. The molecular mechanisms underlying Spo11independent DSBs remain less studied than for Spo11-dependent ones. A primary reason for
this situation is the lack of an experimentally tractable model system in which normal meiosis
can proceed in the absence of spo11 to produce viable haploid gametes (e.g., the ascospores or
sexual spores in fungi).
Sexual eukaryotes fall into two groups with respect to their RecA-like recombinases, which
catalyze homologous pairing and strand-exchange reactions during homologous recombination.
The first group (referred to as “Dual-RecA eukaryotes”) includes budding and fission yeast,
higher plants and mammals. They all possess Rad51 and Dmc1, which cooperate during
meiotic recombination. In addition to meiotic recombination Rad51 (as the only RecA strandexchange protein) is responsible for mitotic recombination, whereas Dmc1 is meiosis-specific
(reviewed in [9]). Recent single-molecular imaging experiments revealed that budding yeast
and mammalian Dmc1 are superior to Rad51 in tolerating mismatched sequences during their
strand exchange reaction [10, 11]. Consistent with this hypothesis, Dmc1-mediated

recombination is more efficient than Rad51-mediated recombination in highly polymorphic
diploid hybrid yeasts, e.g., SK1/S228c and YJM/S228c [12]. The “Rad51-only” eukaryotes
include D. melanogaster, C. elegans and Pezizomycotina filamentous fungi (e.g., Neurospora
crassa). The absence of Dmc1 in the “Rad51-only” organisms raises the intriguing question as
to how interhomolog recombination is possible among highly diversified zygotes.
Like Neurospora crassa, Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jacorina) is a
Pezizomycotina filamentous fungus. QM6a is the ancestor of all T. reesei workhorse strains
currently used for industrial production of lignocellulosic biomass-degrading enzymes and
recombinant proteins (see review in [13]). QM6a was for a long time thought to be an asexual
filamentous fungus. A milestone in this respect was the finding that QM6a has a MAT1-2 locus
and that it can be readily crossed with a female fertile CBS999.97(MAT1-1) strain [14]. Crosses
of CBS999.97(MAT1-1) with QM6a or CBS999.97(MAT1-2) can induce rapid sexual
development and generate reproductive structures. The round-shaped stromata (fruiting bodies)
are composed of a thallus, with multiple flask-shaped perithecia inside. Each perithecium
contains a bouquet of linear asci. The 16 ascospores in each ascus are generated from meiosis,
followed by two rounds of post-meiotic mitosis [15].
QM6a has a small genome (~35 Mbp) and possseses only one copy of a RecA-like
recombinase gene (rad51 but not dmc1) [16]. In this study, we report that the industrial
workhorse filamentous fungi Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jacorina) is an ideal
sexual eukaryote for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying Spo11-independent and
Rad51-only meiotic recombination.

QM6a was originally isolated from one of the Solomon Islands, whereas Hypocrea jacorina
CBS999.97 was sampled from French Guiana (see review in [17]). Due to geographical
isolation, QM6a and CBS999.97 might harbor high levels of sequence variation. We had
determined the complete genome sequences of QM6a [16]. In this study, both PacBio long
reads and Illumina paired-end reads were applied to assemble the complete genome sequences
of

CBS999.97(MAT1-1)

and

CBS999.97(MAT1-2)

(Table

S1).

Like

QM6a,

CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2) have eight reference chromosomes (seven
nuclear chromosomes plus the mitochondrial DNA). Of these, all seven nuclear chromosomes
were essentially returned as a single, complete unitig (Table S1 and Fig. 1). Except for the left
terminus of chromosome VI, all other chromosomal ends in CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and
CBS999.97(MAT1-2) contain 8-13 telomeric repeats (i.e., TTAGGG at 3¢-termini and the
reverse complement CCCTAA at 5¢-termini) (Table S2) [16]. Due to the occurrence of repeatinduced point mutation (RIP) in T. reesei [16], both CBS999.97 haploid genome sequences
contain only 62 transposable elements (Table S3) but 2349 AT-rich blocks with length ≥ 500
base pairs (bp) (Table S4).
Reciprocal translocation in CBS999.97(MAT1-1)
We reported previously that sexual crosses of CBS999.97(MAT1-1) with QM6a or
CBS999.97(MAT1-2) resulted in ~10% asci with 16 euploid ascospores and ~90% asci with
two different types of segmentally aneuploid (SAN) ascospores [15]. The euploid progeny, as
for QM6a and the two CBS999.97 parental strains, germinate to form mycelia with dark-green
conidia (i.e., asexual spores). The first type of SAN ascospores can germinate but fail to
undergo vegetative growth due to loss of the D segment (~0.5 Mb). The second type of SAN
ascospores lack the L segment (~30 kb) but possess two D segments. Our high-quality genome
sequences readily confirm the translocation event between the D segment and the L segment
(Fig. 1). The D segment is located at the right terminus of chromosome II in QM6a and

CBS999.97(MAT1-2) or at the right terminus of chromosome IV in CBS999.97(MAT1-1). In
contrast, the L segment is located at the right terminus of chromosome IV in QM6a and
CBS999.97(MAT1-2) or at the right terminus of chromosome II in CBS999.97(MAT1-1).
Accordingly,

CBS999.97(MAT1-1)

and

CBS999.97(MAT1-2)

are

referred

to

as

CBS999.97(MAT1-1, II_L, IV_D) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2, II_D, IV_L), respectively [15].
Next, we applied pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate the seven
chromosomes of CBS999.97(MAT1-1, II_L, IV_D), CBS999.97(MAT1-2, II_D, IV_L) and
two type II SAN progeny strains (SAN1 and SAN2; Fig. S1a). Southern hybridization with
two DNA probes in the D segment and a DNA probe in the pks4 gene confirmed that
CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2) contain D and L segments in the
corresponding chromosomes. In contrast, in the two type II SAN strains, both chromosome II
and chromosome IV contain a D segment but no L segment (Fig. S1b-S1d).
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers
The three high-quality genome sequences allow efficient SNP calling for genetic and
comparative genomic studies. Using the high stringency SNP detection pipeline from the
MUMmer alignment tools (http://mummer.sourceforge.net/), we identified SNP markers
between CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2) (Fig. 1 and Table S5). There are
935,999 SNPs between QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1) (Table S6) and 949,448 SNPs
between QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-2) (Fig. 1 and Table S7). Since all SNP markers are
evenly distributed throughout the seven chromosomes in QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1),
these two strains are suitable for determining the genome-wide meiotic recombination
landscape (see below).
It is worth noting that the degree of sequence heterozygosity (≥37 bps/SNP) between QM6a
and CBS999.97(MAT1-1) is higher than that (≥200 bps/SNP) of the budding yeast SK1/S288c
and YJM/S288c diploid hybrids [12]. Since T. reesei is a “Rad51-only” sexual eukaryote and

crosses of CBS999.97(MAT1-1) with QM6a or CBS999.97(MAT1-2) can generate viable
progeny, our results raise the intriguing possibility that T. reesei Rad51, like budding yeast
Dmc1, might be superior to budding yeast Rad51 in tolerating mismatched sequences during
the strand exchange reaction. However, a phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Rad51
proteins in six different “Rad51-only” eukaryotes are more similar in amino acid sequence to
the Rad51 proteins than to the Dmc1 proteins in nine different “Dual-RecA” eukaryotes (Fig.
S2).
T. reesei spo11, unlike rad51 or sae2, is dispensable for normal meiosis
Our high-quality genome sequences confirm that there is only one spo11, rad51 (but not dmc1)
and sae2 in each of QM6a [16], CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2) (this study).
The conserved primary structures and well-aligned protein sequences with other fungal
orthologs strongly support identification of these important meiotic genes in T. reesei (Fig. S3S5). We then generated rad51Δ, sae2Δ and spo11Δ mutants by gene replacement based on
homologous recombination and confirmed mutation by antibiotic selection, Southern
hybridization or genomic polymerase chain reactions (Fig. S6).
T. reesei Rad51 is indispensable for repairing DSBs and/or DNA lesions during meiosis in
T. reesei. Deletion of rad51 resulted in no apparent effect on formation of fruiting bodies,
perithecia or asci. Almost all rad51Δ asci exhibit meiotic prophase arrest and have only one
nucleus (Fig. 2b). This meiotic prophase arrest phenotype is similar to that of S. cerevisiae
dmc1Δ or rad51Δ dmc1Δ lines in which unrepaired ssDNA accumulates, leading to activation
of Mec1ATR, an evolutionarily conserved DNA damage checkpoint kinase [18].
Sae2 (CtIP in mammals or Ctp1 in fission yeast) is a DNA endonuclease that collaborates
with the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs/Nbs1 complex to remove a small oligo nucleotide(s) from free DSB
ends, Spo11-conjugated DSBs and Topoisomerase II (Top2)-conjugated DSB ends [19-22]. T.
reesei Sae2, like Rad51, is dispensable for the formation of fruiting bodies or perithecia.

However, the sae2Δ perithecia contain more underdeveloped or short asci than those of wildtype and rad51Δ. Some T. reesei sae2Δ asci can still undergo the first or even second meiotic
nuclear divisions. Though few sae2Δ asci formed mature ascospores, there was always fewer
than sixteen ascospores (Fig. 2c). We then applied yeast tetrad dissection microscopy to isolate
single sae2Δ ascospores. The majority of the sae2Δ ascospores (>57%) failed to germinate and
form vegetative colonies on a malt extract agar (MEA) plate. Therefore, the T. reesei sae2Δ
mutant is phenotypically similar to S. cerevisiae sae2 null mutants, with unprocessed Spo11conjugated DSBs in these latter activating another evolutionarily conserved DNA damage
checkpoint kinase Tel1ATM (but not Mec1ATR). Since the kinase activity of Tel1ATM in budding
yeast meiotic cells is much lower than that of Mec1ATR, the sae2 null mutants exhibit much
weaker meiotic prophase arrest phenotypes compared to dmc1Δ or the rad51Δ dmc1Δ double
mutant. Accordingly, the majority of S. cerevisiae sae2 null mutant cells (50-70%) can execute
the first or even the second meiotic nuclear divisions with reasonable efficiency but hardly
produce any viable spores [20].
The T. reesei Spo11 protein exhibits significant homology (33.8% identity in amino acid
sequence) with the fission yeast S. pombe Rec12 protein. It contains five conserved motifs
(motifs 1-5) and three evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues equivalent to those of S.
cerevisiae Spo11: Tyr-135 (in motif 1), Glu-233 (in motif 3) and Asp-288 in motif 5 (Fig. S3).
These three evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues are known to be essential for meiotic
recombination in S. cerevisiae [23]. Surprisingly, deletion of spo11 resulted in no apparent
effect on the entire sexual development process, including formation of fruiting bodies,
perithecia or asci, as well as the number of ascospores per ascus (Fig. 2d). We then sequentially
isolated all 16 ascospores from an ascus. Our results reveal that spore viability, colony
morphology and colony color were identical regardless of the presence or absence of spo11 in
the individually cultured ascospores (Table S8).

Genome-wide detection of meiotic recombination products in T. reesei
Next, we explored genome-wide meiotic recombination profiles in the presence and absence
of spo11. An in-house bioinformatics pipeline was established for SNP position genotyping
and recombination analysis (see “Methods”). For efficacy assessment, the pipeline was first
used to reanalyze the NGS data of budding yeast tetrads from a diploid SK1/S288c hybrid [12].
We could detect all non-crossover (NCO) and crossover (CO) recombination products (Table
S9) using the ReCombine (v2.1) [24] and GroupEvents programs [25]. NCO is a gene
conversion (GC) without exchange of flanking markers, whereas CO involves the exchange of
flanking markers and possible GC. Median CO length, estimated by a cumulative frequency
plot, is ~ 1 kb (see below). The long GC tracts observed in budding yeast meiotic COs arises
from clustered Spo11-induced DSBs within local chromosome regions [26].
Next, we determined the genome-wide meiotic recombination landscapes of three asci (#1#3) generated by QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1) hybrid meiosis (Table 1 and Table S10). All
48 ascospores from these three asci could germinate and formed mycelia with dark-green
conidial pigments, indicating that they are all euploid. The genomic DNA of the 48 F1 progeny
was isolated and genotyped to detect mat1-1, mat1-2 and actin as described previously [15].
The PCR results revealed that the 16 ascospores in each ascus can be classified into four
genetically identical groups. One representative ascospore from each genetically identical
group was then selected for whole genome sequencing using an Illumina-Miseq sequencer. We
used PlotTetred, a component of the “ReCombine” programs [24], to create graphical
representations of all seven chromosomes of QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1), as well as the
four representative progeny from each ascus (Fig. 3b and Fig. S7a-S7c). Remarkably, all the
interhomolog recombination products in these three T. reesei asci (#1-#3) are “simple CO” or
“simple NCO”, without any other genotype switches within 5 kb (Table 1 and Table S11-S12).
This feature differs from budding yeast meiosis, which often generates COs with discontinuous

GC, NCOs with two GC tracts, or even ambiguous recombination products that can arise from
more than one pathway [24].
Due to the short lengths of Illumina paired-end reads, we failed to accurately determine the
recombination profiles of chromosomal regions hosting long AT-rich blocks (Fig. 3b and Fig.
S7a-S7c). Accordingly, we applied PacBio SMRT technology to sequence and assemble the
complete genomes of the four representative F1 progeny in ascus #1 (Table S13). By
comparing the completed genome sequences of the two parental genomes, we were able to
infer accurate recombination landscapes for all seven chromosomes (Fig. 3c-3d). These results
not only confirm all interhomolog recombination products detected by the Illumina paired-end
reads, but also reveal no new interhomolog recombination products.
We conclude that Trichoderma reesei Rad51 is capable of catalyzing interhomolog
recombination to form both CO and NCO recombination products, though there is a high level
of sequence heterogeneity between the genomes of QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1). The
average CO rate per meiosis is 1,250 ± 86.6 centiMorgans (cMs) or 28 ± 2 kb/cM (Table 1 and
Table S14).
T. reesei exhibits spo11-independent interhomolog recombination
Next, we generated two pairs of QM6a spo11Δ and CBS999.97(MAT1-1) spo11Δ mutants by
backcrossing the spo11Δ mutants to QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1), respectively (Table S10).
Based on SNP calling, we found that their genomes exhibited 94.64% and 58.32% sequence
heterogeneity to each other. Next, we applied NGS to determine genome-wide meiotic
recombination profiles of three representative asci (#4-#6) generated by the first spo11Δ
mutant pair, as well as three representative asci (#7-#9) generated by the second spo11Δ mutant
pair (Table 1, Table S14, Table S17-S18, Fig. 3b and Fig. S7). All six spo11Δ asci (#4-#9) we
examined in this study produced both CO and NCO interhomolog recombination products.

We also applied PacBio SMRT technology to sequence and assemble the complete genomes
of the four representative F1 progeny in ascus #4 (Fig. 3c, Fig. S8 and Table S13), and the
results are consistent with those from whole-genome sequencing using an Illumina-MiSeq
sequencer.
For the three asci (#4-6) generated from crossing the first pair of spo11Δ mutants, the
average interhomolog CO rate per meiosis (after normalization to the percentage of overall
sequence heterozygosity; 94.64%) is 916 ± 250 cMs (40 ± 13 kb/cM), which is ~70% that of
the wild-type QM6a and wild-type CBS999.97(MAT1-1) cross (Table 1 and Table S14).
Accordingly, we infer that the spo11-independent pathway is about two-fold more active than
the spo11-dependent pathway.
This inference is consistent with our cytological observations that the rad51Δ asci exhibited
stronger meiotic prophase arrest phenotypes than the spo11Δ rad51Δ asci. Presumably, the
rad51Δ asci accumulate unrepaired ssDNAs generated from both Spo11-dependent DSBs and
Spo11-independent DNA lesions, whereas the spo11Δ rad51Δ asci contain only Spo11independent unrepaired ssDNA. We found that almost all rad51Δ asci exhibited a single
strongly DAPI-stained focus (Figure 2B). The majority of spo11Δ rad51Δ asci (>90%) also
contained one strongly DAPI-stained focus. Notably, most spo11Δ rad51Δ asci often (>50%)
contained two or more additional micronuclei with no or few much weaker DAPI-stained
signals (Fig. 2e and 2f).
High fidelity of postmeiotic DNA replication in the presence or absence of spo11
To rule out the possibility that unexpected sequence variations or even interhomolog
recombination products might be generated during the two rounds of postmeiotic mitosis, we
isolated the genomic DNA from all 16 progeny generated from the #1 wild-type asci and the
#4 spo11Δ asci for whole-genome sequencing using an Illumina-MiSeq sequencer (Table S10).
The results of genome-wide sequence mapping confirm that all sixteen F1 progeny of these

two asci can be classified into four genetically identical groups (Fig. S9). The nucleotide
sequences of each genetically identical group possess very few mismatched sequences (≤1 per
10,000 bp) (Tables S19-S22). Moreover, there are no chromosomal abnormalities (deletions,
inversions or translocations) in any of the 32 sexual progeny examined here. We infer that the
two rounds of postmeiotic DNA replication are highly faithful, regardless of the presence or
absence of spo11.
T. reesei spo11 is dispensable for chromosome synapsis during meiosis
In many sexual eukaryotes, homologous chromosome synapsis is mediated by the formation
of synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiotic prophase. The SC is a tripartite proteinaceous
structure consisting of two parallel lateral/axial filaments formed along sister chromatids of
each homolog and numerous transverse filaments between two lateral elements forming the SC
central element. Arrays of multiple chromatin loops are anchored to the lateral elements. The
SC functions primarily as a scaffold to allow interacting chromatids of homologs to complete
their homologous recombination activities. The SC transverse filament proteins of most sexual
eukaryotes share no sequence similarity but strong structural homology; all comprise long
internal coiled-coil domains (with sizes correlated with the width of the SC; ~100 nm) flanked
by globular N- and C-terminal domains (see review in [27]). The formation of SC between
homologs can occur independently of recombination in some organisms (e.g. C. elegans and
D. melanogaster). It is also true that for many sexual eukaryotes, SC assembly is coupled to
formation of recombination intermediates, such as S. cereveisae, S. macrospora, and mouse
(see review in [27]). T. reesei, like S. macrospora, possesses the sme4 homologous gene
encoding a conserved traverse filament protein [28], but it is still unclear if SC occurs in T.
reesei and whether T. reesei spo11 is required for the formation of SC.
To investigate this topic, we applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize
SC in T. reesei meiotic cells at pachytene stage. In both wild-type (Fig. 4a) and spo11D (Fig.

13

4b), the two lateral elements lie about 100 nm apart and are interconnected by transverse
filaments. Using TEM tomography, we were able to reconstruct several fully developed SCs
in representative spo11D meiotic cells (Fig. 4d-4e and Movie S1). In contrast, only unsynapsed
axial elements were detected in the rad51D asci (Fig. 4c, Fig. 4f and Movie S2). We conclude
that assembly of SC is coupled to meiotic recombination in T. reesei. Notably, unlike S.
cerevisiae spo11 [3] and S. marcospora spo11 [28], T. reesei spo11 is dispensable for
promoting meiotic chromosome synapsis.
Comparative analysis of COs and NCOs in the presence or absence of spo11
The three wild-type asci (#1-#3) generated 75 COs and 36 NCOs, whereas 83 COs and 36
NCOs were produced by the six spo11Δ asci (#4-#9) (Table 1 and Table S14). Using our
nucleotide sequences, we could map their positions, and compare the distances between
adjacent COs and/or NCOs, as well as their distances to neighboring AT-rich blocks.
Remarkably, none of the interhomolog events in the nine asci examined here overlap (Fig. 3c
and Table S23-S24).
Positive CO interference apparently exists in T. reesei regardless of the presence or
absence of spo11 (Fig. 5a). The inter-CO distances in wild-type and spo11Δ meiosis fit a
gamma distribution [29]. The strength of interference is determined by the value of the shape
parameter γ of the best-fit distribution (γ = 1 indicates a random distribution and γ > 1 indicates
positive interference). We found that γ = 4.9 in wild-type and γ = 3.2 in spo11Δ meiosis.
Previous study of budding yeast meiosis revealed that the genome-wide distribution of
detectable interhomolog events (COs + NCOs) reflects the underlying Spo11-induced DSB
distribution [30]. Moreover, DSB interference among NCOs is weaker than that among COs
[31]. We found that, regardless of the presence or absence of T. reesei spo11, the distributions
of COs, NCOs and a combination of interhomolog recombination products all display positive
interference (Tables S25-S26). Unexpectedly, genetic interference among NCOs is stronger

than that among COs for the wild-type, but weaker for spo11Δ (Fig. 5b; p < 0.01). We
hypothesize that the spacing between Spo11-induced DSBs and/or Spo11-independent DNA
lesions in T. reesei are tightly regulated by a novel interference mechanism(s), and that this
mechanism(s) might be different from that in budding yeast.
GC tracts associated with interhomolog recombination events have been used for CO and
NCO length measurements [32]. Compared to the median CO length (~1 kb) of SK1/S228c
hybrid meiosis (Table S9), both T. reesei wild-type and spo11Δ meiosis generated COs with
much shorter median lengths (<200 bp). The median lengths (400-500 bp) of NCOs in T. reesei
spo11Δ are slightly longer than those (200-300 bp) of NCOs in wild-type (Fig. 5c and Table
S11-S18). Since the longer GC tracts in budding yeast might be due to clustered Spo11-induced
DSBs within the same chromosomal loops [26], we infer that both Spo11-induced DSBs and
Spo11-independent DNA lesions in T. reesei might be tightly controlled to prevent clustering.
We also found that the median SNP number per CO in QM6a/CBS999.97(MAT1-1) hybrid
meiosis is ~3.5, which is significantly lower than that (~6.0) in SK1/S288c hybrid meiosis (Fig.
5e). Intriguingly, in both QM6a/CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and SK1/S288c hybrid meiosis, there
are few long GC tracts containing a high number (up to 50) of SNPs (Fig. 5f). These results
support the notion that T. reesei Rad51, like S. cerevisiae and mammalian Dmc1 (but not
Rad51), can tolerate mismatched sequences during the strand exchange reaction.
Interhomolog recombination products tend to be located at 3¢-regions of proteinencoding genes in the spo11Δ mutant line
Previous studies revealed that meiotic DSBs are not randomly distributed along chromosomes.
In S. cerevisiae, Spo11-induced DSBs form preferentially on chromosome arms, and
preferentially form in GC-rich chromatin loop regions rather than AT-rich axis-associated
DNA [33]. Locally, there are DSB hotspots (typically ∼200 bp) in which Spo11 cleaves

preferentially. The majority (88%) of DSB hotspots in S. cerevisiae are within nucleosomedepleted regions (NDRs) in gene promoters [34-36].
Our results revealed that, at the chromosome level, the majority of interhomolog events in
T. reesei preferentially occur within chromosomal loops rather than at the chromosomal axes.
Of the 127 CO and 57 NCO products we detected in the six asci (#1-#6) (Table 1), only 7 COs
and 5 NCOs overlap with short AT-rich blocks (either 500 or 1000 bp in length; Tables S23S24). Therefore, both Spo11-induced DSBs and Spo11-independent DNA lesions
preferentially occur within chromosomal loops in T. reesei. No interhomolog recombination
product was detected within centromeres, telomeres or subtelomeric regions, with these long
AT-rich blocks perhaps forming constitutive heterochromatin and displaying a reduced
frequency of meiotic recombination.
Locally, regardless of the presence or absence of spo11, two-thirds of the GC tracts
associated with interhomolog recombination products overlap with intragenic regions, whereas
one-third overlap with intergenic regions (Table 1 and Table S27). In the presence of spo11,
there is no bias in the occurrence of interhomolog recombination products at either the 5¢ or 3¢
regions of protein-encoding genes. The 5¢ region is operationally defined as being from 1000
bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream of the ‘start’ codon (ATG), whereas the 3¢ region is from
1000 bp upstream and 1000 bp downstream to the ‘stop’ codons. Remarkably, in spo11Δ,
>57% of interhomolog recombination products overlap with 3¢ regions and only ~ 23% overlap
with 5¢ regions (Table 1).
Top2 might be responsible for Spo11-independent DSBs during T. reesei meiosis.
Three lines of evidence suggest that Top2 likely acts redundantly with Spo11 to initiate
interhomolog recombination in T. reesei. First, T. reesei sae2 is required for both spo11dependent and spo11-independent interhomolog recombination in T. reesei. Sae2 and the
Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1/Xrs2 complex not only remove the 5′ protein adducts of Spo11 during

initiation of meiotic recombination [3], they also function in Top2 removal from the 5′ termini
that arise during poisoned topoisomerase reactions [37-39]; Second, the twin-supercoileddomain model [40] can explain why the majority of Spo11-independent interhomolog products
overlap with the 3¢ regions of protein-encoding genes. During transcription, RNA polymerase
(RNAP) tracks the helical groove of DNA, overtwisting downstream DNA and undertwisting
upstream DNA. Therefore, positively supercoiled DNA is generated in front of RNAP and
negatively supercoiled DNA forms behind it. Like S. cerevisiae [41] and Drosophila [42], T.
reesei has only one isoform of Top2 (this study). Humans express two closely related isoforms,
Top2α and Top2β. It has been reported previously that S. cerevisiae Top2, Drosophila Top2
and human Top2α preferentially relaxes positively supercoiled DNA [43]. These Top2 proteins
likely function ahead of RNAP. Consistent with this supposition, a genome-wide mapping
study has revealed that human Top2α cleavage sites preferentially cluster in more distal regions
of protein-encoding and/or non-coding RNA genes [44]. Third, we found that addition of
idarubicin, an effective inhibitor of fungal Top2 [45], to the developing stromata could partly
rescue the meiotic prophase arrest phenotype of both rad51D (Fig. 2g and 2h) and rad51D
spo11D asci (Fig. 2i and 2j).

Discussion
Meiotic recombination promotes proper genetic diversity and chromosome segregation.
Accurate estimates of recombination rates are of great importance for our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms governing meiosis and evolution. A milestone in this respect is the
development of NGS-based analyses of hybrid S. cerevisiae genomes bearing thousands of
heterozygous SNP markers (see review in [46]). Here, in this study, we combined both NGS
and PacBio RSII sequencing technology to whole genome sequence data from hybrid crosses
of two highly polymorphic T. reesei strains, QM6a and CBS999.97(MAT1-1). Our

recombination maps of T. reesei hybrid meiosis provide novel insights into the mechanisms of
meiotic recombination in this economically important fungus.
T. reesei is an ideal model for studying Rad51-only meiosis
The first key finding of this study is that T. reesei Rad51 is essential and sufficient for
promoting interhomolog recombination and chromosome synapsis in this Rad51-only
eukaryote. Our genome-wide recombination mapping data indicate that T. reesei Rad51 can
tolerate mismatched sequences in the strand exchange reaction of a highly polymorphic hybrid
meiosis. This property of T. reesei Rad51 is similar to that of Dmc1 (but not Rad51) in budding
yeast and mammals [10-12].
It was reported previously that the eukaryotic rad51 and dmc1 genes formed two separate
monophyletic groups when archaeal RecA-like recombinase genes (RADA) were used as an
outgroup. The dmc1 genes were lost independently in Rad51-only eukaryotic organisms during
evolution. Moreover, D. melanogaster and C. elegans possess rapidly evolving rad51 genes
[47]. Rapid evolution might be a general property of all rad51 genes since they are typically
non-interchangeable within genera and even within species. For example, fission yeast, mouse
and human rad51 genes all failed to complement the DNA repair defect of S. cerevisiae rad51
mutants [48]. Further studies are needed to identify the structural motif(s) in Dmc1 and T.
reesei Rad51 responsible for tolerating mismatched sequences during meiotic recombination.
It will also be of great interest to determine if and how the rad51 genes in “Rad51-only”
eukaryotes independently acquired the capability to tolerate mismatched sequences after (or
before) their dmc1 genes were lost.
spo11-independent interhomolog recombination prevails during T. reesei meiosis
The second important finding of our study is that removal of T. reesei spo11 does not affect
the formation of SC and mature asci with 16 viable ascospores. On average, the frequency of
Spo11-independent interhomolog recombination is about two-fold greater than that of Spo11-

induced interhomolog recombination. Both Sae2 and Rad51 are required for repair of Spo11induced and Spo11-independent DSBs. Accordingly, T. reesei spo11D mutants represent the
best model yet for studying spo11-independent meiotic recombination for a number of reasons.
First, all other studied sexual eukaryotes (except social amoebae) require their spo11 genes to
generate sufficient CO products between homologous chromosomes (reviewed in [8, 49-51]).
Second, compared to T. reesei, sexual reproduction was rarely observed in the best-studied
model organisms of social amoebae, D. discoideum [52]. Third, advancements in genetic
transformation tools (reviewed in [13]) and the availability of T. reesei haploid genome
sequences ([53] and this study) make T. reesei amenable to multiple experimental approaches,
including genetics, reverse genetics and genomics.
Does Top2 induce Spo11-independent DSBs?
We present three lines of evidence in this study to support the notion that Top2 might act
redundantly (and predominantly) to initiate meiotic recombination in T. reesei. Top2 has the
capability to make DSBs. Top2-dependent post-meiotic DSBs in Tetrahymena thermophila
occur in conjunction with the transition from a heterochromatic to euchromatic chromatin
structure in the haploid pronucleus [54]. In budding yeast, inactivation of the DNA damage
checkpoint kinase Mec1, a homolog of mammalian ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
(ATR) protein kinase, leads to Top2-dependent DSBs at fragile sites (referred to as replication
slow zones, RSZs). RSZs are homologous to mammalian common fragile sites (CFSs), stability
of which is regulated by ATR [55, 56]. In human K562 leukemia cells, Top2α cleaves
functionally conserved local sequences at cleavage cluster regions (CCRs). Top2α CCRs are
biased toward the distal regions of gene bodies [44]. Consistent with this scenario, we found
that CO and NCO products arising from spo11D meiosis were biased toward the 3’ region of
protein-encoding genes. Genome-wide detection of Spo11-independent DSB sites will reveal
whether they share conserved local sequences with yeast RSZs and mammalian CFSs or CCRs.

Further investigations are also needed to determine whether Top2 is involved in the initiation
of Spo11-independent meiotic DSBs or recombination in other sexual eukaryotes.
Genetic interference and crossover homeostasis
Genetic interference is a common characteristic of sexual eukaryotes, with very few known
exceptions (e.g., fission yeast) in which recombination proceeds with no interference (see
review of [57]). In this study, we show that both CO and NCO products proceed with positive
interference regardless of the presence or absence of spo11. In addition, T. reesei preferentially
produces “simple” CO and “simple” NCO products (Table 1 and Table S11-S12). Both Spo11induced and Spo11-independent DSBs are tightly regulated to prevent clustering within the
same or even nearby chromosome loops.
Our data also reveal that loss of spo11 resulted in a higher CO/NCO ratio, i.e., 2.1 in wildtype (asci #1-#3) and 2.5 in spo11D (asci #4-#6) T. reesei (Table 1). One potential explanation
for this outcome is that a buffer system operates in T. reesei meiosis to maintain CO levels at
the expense of NCOs when there are no Spo11-dependent DSBs. This buffer system is
functionally analogous to “CO homeostasis”, which ensures a stable CO number at the expense
of NCOs even if the number of Spo11-induced DSBs varies. The “CO homeostasis”
phenomenon was first discovered in S. cerevisiae meiosis [58] and subsequently found in D.
melanogaster, C. elegans and mouse meiosis (reviewed in [59]). A second potential
explanation is simply that Spo11-independent DSBs have a greater tendency to generate CO
products as compared to Spo11-dependent DSBs. It will be important to further investigate
these two hypotheses and decipher the underlying molecular mechanism. The findings of that
investigative effort will also provide new insights into whether the CO/NCO decision is made
before or after initiation of DSBs, given that both Spo11-independent DSBs and Spo11induced DSBs share the same molecular mechanism for DSB end processing (i.e., Sae2) and
Rad51-only DSB repair.

SC assembly in T. reesei is Spo11-independent but requires Rad51
T. reesei possesses the gene homologous to the S. marcospora sme4 encoding a conserved
traverse filament protein [28]. We show for the first time that the seven pairs of homologous
chromosomes in T. reesei wild-type and spo11D meiotic cells form SCs. In contrast, the rad51D
mutant only forms unsynapsed axial elements. Our results confirm that the T. reesei SC shares
strong structural homology with that of other sexual eukaryotes and that the assembly of SC in
T. reesei is coupled to meiotic recombination regardless of the presence or absence of Spo11.
It is currently thought that the function of the SC is to shape the chromosome-wide landscape
of interhomolog recombination products via cooperative assembly, CO promotion and NCO
inhibition. Further analyses of corresponding T. reesei mutants will provide insights into the
functional interactions between SC assembly, recombinosome localization, genetic
interference and CO homeostasis.

Conclusion
In conclusion, T. reesei represents an excellent model organism for studying Spo11independent (or Top2-dependent) and Rad51-only meiosis. The three T. reesei genome
sequences, we report here, are the highest quality yet generated and provide a better framework
for genetic and genomic analyses of this industrially important fungus. Further investigations
of the underlying mechanisms of T. reesei meiosis can provide new information on the
molecular mechanism(s) and evolution of meiosis, as well as revealing innovative avenues for
industrial strain improvements.

Fungal growth, culture media, sexual crossing, single ascospore isolation, preparation of
genomic DNA, PCR genotyping, Southern hybridization, DAPI staining and cytological
analysis have been described in our previous studies [15, 60]. Whole genome sequencing and
assembly were carried out by the PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) method and the
Illumina-MiSeq paired-end method [16]. Asci were stained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2phenylindole) and visualized by the DeltaVision Core Imaging System (Applied Precision,
LLC, USA).
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Intact chromosomal DNA was prepared using the agarose spheroplasting method with two
modifications. The conidia were isolated and germinated in potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 25
°C, 200 rpm for 6 hr before being embedded into the agarose plug. Trichoderma harziaum
lysing enzymes (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) were used to digest the cell walls during
spheroplasting. Electrophoresis conditions for karyotype analysis were described previously
[61].
SNP genotyping and recombination analysis
All bioinformatics experiments were performed using the same approaches described
previously for recombination analysis of the SK1/S288c tetrads [12]. The complete high
quality genome sequences of QM6a [16], CBS999.97(MAT1-1) and CBS999.97(MAT1-2)
were used as the references for SNP calling. For each sample, either the PacBio-SMRT long
reads or the Illumina paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genomes using BurrowsWheeler Aligner (BWA v0.6.2) [62]. The recombination events were detected with an inhouse pipeline incorporating a similar algorithm to the CrossOver (v6.3) algorithm in the
ReCombine programs (v2.1) [24]. Genotype data were formatted according to Anderson et al.
(2011) and the program was run with a 0 bp threshold. The output data were then processed
using the GroupEvents program to merge closely spaced events into single classes [25]. To

validate the efficacy of our bioinformatics methods, we used them to reanalyze the NGS data
of two previously published SK1/S288c tetrads [12]. The results confirmed that we could
identify almost all previously reported recombination products (Table S9).
TEM tomography
Developing fruiting bodies were collected and dissected into thin sections (0.2 mm thick) using
a Vibratome 1000 PLUS. Pre-fixation was performed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1M sodium
cacodylate (pH 7.2) for 3 hr at room temperature, and then shifted to 4 °C for overnight. The
specimens were washed three times in 0.1M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2) for 15 min in each
change. Post-fixation was performed by 2% OsO4 solution/0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer at
room temperature for 1 hr. Next, the specimens were washed three times with 0.1M sodium
cacodylate for 15 minutes. We used 2% uranyl acetate for in block-staining at room
temperature for 1 hr. For dehydration, a series of ethanol solutions with 10% increments (from
10% to 100%) were used. The specimens were immersed twice into 100% 1,2-propylene oxide
(PO) for 20 minutes. Infiltration was performed for 4 hr in a mixture of PO with 10% Spurr's
resin, and we then increased the concentration of Spurr's resin by 10% for 8-12 hr each change
till 100%. The specimens were immersed twice every 12 hours into the Spurr's resin with an
accelerator (DMAE) for 12 hours, and then transferred to the embedding molds.
Polymerization proceeded at 70 °C for 12 hr. Serial 200 nm-thick sections were collected and
scanned with a Thermo ScientificTM Talos L120C TEM system (4x4k CMOS Ceta camera)
operating at 120 kV with 0 and 90 degrees. The TEM tomography images were taken at 6700×
magnification. We used the Inspect 3D 4.3 program for image stack alignment, reconstruction
and axis registration for each section. The Amira Software 6.0 was used to align and
concatenate all image sections. Three-dimensional models were generated by inputting the
concatenated images into Imaris9.1.2 software.

Fig. 5. Comparative analysis of COs and NCOs in wild-type and spo11Δ asci. (a) Crossover
interference. Distribution of distances between adjacent COs among the detected COs. Values
for the shape parameter γ of the best-fit gamma distribution are indicated. (b) Interference
between interhomolog recombination products. Interference calculated as 1 - c.o.c. (coefficient
of coincidence) for COs only, NCOs only, and all events combined from whole-genome
recombination profiling data. (c) Cumulative distribution of the lengths of COs and/or NCOs
during hybrid meiosis of QM6a/CBS999.97(MAT1-1), QM6a spo11Δ/CBS999.97(MAT1-1)
spo11Δ, and SK1/S288c. (d) Cumulative distribution of all COs and NCOs to the two adjacent
AT-rich blocks. The NGS results of 20 different SK1/S288c tetrads published previously were
reanalyzed here. (e-f) T. reesei Rad51, like budding yeast Dmc1, can tolerate mismatch
sequences during the strand exchange reaction. (e) Cumulative distribution of the SNP number
in the CO-associated gene conversion tracts. Results from nine QM6a/CBS999.97(MAT1-1)
asci (#1-#9) and twenty SK1/S288c tetrads (Callender et al., 2016) are shown. (f) The twosample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (two-sided) confirmed that the two cumulative distributions
are different (** p < 0.01). Relative distribution of SNP number in the CO-associated gene
