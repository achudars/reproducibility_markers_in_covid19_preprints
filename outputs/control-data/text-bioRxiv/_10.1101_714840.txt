Abstract

30

From psychology to economics there has been substantial interest in how costs (e.g.,

31

delay, risk) are represented asymmetrically during decision-making when attempting to gain

32

reward or to avoid punishment. For example, in decision-making under risk, individuals show

33

a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment than to acquire the equivalent reward (loss aversion).

34

Although the cost of physical effort has received significant recent attention due to the

35

evaluation of motor costs being crucial in our daily decisions, it remains unclear whether loss

36

aversion exists during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be

37

hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists

38

across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with

39

different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we

40

demonstrate that young healthy participants exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-

41

making by exerting more physical effort in order to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size

42

reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients show a reduction in

43

loss aversion compared to age-matched controls. Behavioural and computational analysis

44

revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward, but were

45

less willing to produce effort in order to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present

46

during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This

47

finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show

48

a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.

49

Significance Statement

50

Loss aversion – preferring to avoid punishment than to acquire equivalent reward – is

51

an important concept in decision-making under risk. However, little is known about whether

52

loss aversion also exists during decisions where the cost is physical effort. This is surprising

53

given that motor cost shapes human behaviour, and a reduced willingness to exert effort is a

54

characteristic of many clinical disorders. Here, we show that healthy individuals exert more

55

effort to minimise punishment than to maximise reward (loss aversion). We also demonstrate

56

that loss aversion is modulated by altered dopaminergic state by showing that medicated

57

Parkinson’s disease patients exert similar effort to gain reward but less effort to avoid

58

punishment. Therefore, dopamine-dependent loss aversion is crucial for explaining effort-

59

based decision-making.

Introduction

61

In daily life we make countless choices that involve a cost-benefit analysis. As a result,

62

there has been substantial interest into how a cost, such as the delay and uncertainty of reward,

63

alters the subjective value an individual associates with the beneficial outcome of a decision

64

(Bautista, Tinbergen, & Kacelnik, 2001; Fehr & Rangel, 2011; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979;

65

Stephens, 2001; Stephens & Krebs, 1986; Stevens, Rosati, Ross, & Hauser, 2005).As many

66

decisions we make requires an evaluation of the associated motor costs (Klein-Flügge,

67

Kennerley, Friston, & Bestmann, 2016), one cost that has received significant recent attention

68

is physical effort (effort-based decision-making). Previous work has investigated the

69

computational, neural and neurochemical mechanisms involved when individuals evaluate

70

rewards that are associated to physical effort (Burke, Brunger, Kahnt, Park, & Tobler, 2013;

71

Hauser, Eldar, & Dolan, 2017; Irma Triasih Kurniawan, Guitart-Masip, & Dolan, 2011; Prévost,

72

Pessiglione, Météreau, Cléry-Melin, & Dreher, 2010), with a diminished willingness to exert

73

effort being a prevalent characteristic of many clinical disorders such as Parkinson’s disease

74

(Baraduc, Thobois, Gan, Broussolle, & Desmurget, 2013; Chong et al., 2015).

75

With other costs, such as delay and uncertainty, prior work has examined how they are

76

represented differently when attempting to gain reward or avoid punishment. For example, in

77

decision-making under risk, individuals show a tendency to prefer to avoid punishment than to

78

acquire the equivalent reward, a phenomenon called loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979;

79

Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). Surprisingly, it remains unclear whether people also exhibit loss

80

aversion during effort-based decision-making. On the one hand, loss aversion may be

81

hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains (Kahneman & Tversky,

82

1979; Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992b), and thus should be

83

observed in any cost-benefit decision-making context. On the other hand, distinct brain regions

84

are involved in decision-making with different costs (Bailey, Simpson, & Balsam, 2016;

85

Galaro, Celnik, & Chib, 2019; Hauser et al., 2017; Prévost et al., 2010), making it questionable

86

whether similar asymmetries should exist. For example, the critical neural signature of effort-

87

based decision-making is the cingulate cortex, and not the ventromedial prefrontal cortex as

88

typically described for decision-making under risk (Klein-Flügge et al., 2016). Although

89

several studies have attempted to address this question, these either do not directly examine

90

loss aversion (Galaro et al., 2019), do not involve the execution of the effortful action

91

(Nishiyama, 2016) or the cost of effort is confounded with the cost of temporal delay (Porat,

92

Hassin-Baer, Cohen, Markus, & Tomer, 2014).

93

The neurotransmitter dopamine appears to be crucial for effort-based decision-making.

94

For example, Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients off dopaminergic medication exhibit a reduced

95

willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward, with medication restoring this imbalance

96

(Chong et al., 2015; Le Bouc et al., 2016; Skvortsova, Degos, Welter, Vidailhet, & Pessiglione,

97

2017). Interestingly, during decision-making under risk and reinforcement learning,

98

Parkinson’s disease patients on dopaminergic medication display an enhanced response to

99

reward but a reduced sensitivity to punishment (Collins & Frank, 2014; Frank, 2005; Frank,

100

Seeberger, & O’Reilly, 2004). Although this suggests that dopamine availability might shape

101

loss aversion across contexts (Clark & Dagher, 2014; Timmer, Sescousse, Esselink, Piray, &

102

Cools, 2017), and in particular that medicated PD patients should show reduced loss aversion,

103

the role of dopamine during effort-based decision-making within a reward or punishment

104

context has not been directly investigated.

105

In this paper, we demonstrate that young healthy participants exhibit loss aversion

106

during effort-based decision-making; individuals were willing to exert more physical effort in

107

order to minimise punishment than maximise reward. In addition, behavioural and

108

computational analysis revealed that medicated Parkinson’s disease patients showed a

109

reduction in loss aversion compared to age-matched controls. Specifically, although patients

110

exerted similar physical effort in return for reward, they were less willing to produce effort to

111

avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and

112

this asymmetry is modulated by dopaminergic state.

Experimental design

147

Experiment set up

148

Participants were seated in front of a computer (Figure 1A) running a task implemented

149

in Psychtoolbox (http:// Psychtoolbox.org) and Matlab (MathWorks, USA). Two custom-built

150

vertical handles were positioned on a desk in front of the participants, each of which housed a

151

force transducer with sample rate of 200 hertz (https://www.ati-ia.com). The force produced

152

on each handle enabled participants to independently control two cursors on the computer

153

screen (Figure 1A). During the main experiment, one handle was assigned as the decision-

154

making handle; participants grasped this handle with their hand and produced a left or right

155

directed force in order to move the decision cursor into the appropriate option box to indicate

156

their choice. The other handle was designated as the force execution handle; participants rested

157

their index finger next to the bottom of the handle and produced a force by pressing their index

158

finger inward on the handle (i.e., push left for the right index finger, push right for the left index

159

finger).

Procedure

170

Before the main effort-based decision-making task, participants were asked to produce

171

a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of their first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle

172

(isometric contraction of the index finger against the handle) for 3 seconds. This was repeated

173

3 times and the average maximum force was taken as their MVC. For the young healthy

174

participants, the index finger of the dominant hand was chosen to produce the force. For PD

175

patients, the index finger of the most affected side was chosen to produce the force (dominant

176

hand n=11, non-dominant hand n=7). For the healthy age-matched controls, we chose a similar

177

ratio of dominant hand and non-dominant hand as their force producing hand (dominant hand

178

n=12, non-dominant hand n=8). Following the MVC, participants had 12 trials to practise the

179

6 force levels that were used in the main decision-making task (see Effort-based decision-

180

making task section for details). The force levels were shown to participants as a set of arcs

181

(Figure 1A).

182

The effort-based decision-making task consisted of 2 blocks (reward and punishment),

183

the order of which was counter-balanced across participants. Each block consisted of 10

184

repetitions of each of the 6 force levels, with a total of 60 trials in each block (15 repetitions

185

for the young age group, 90 trials in each block). Following the effort-based decision-making

186

task, participants were asked to produce 3 consecutive 3-second MVCs. They were instructed

187

that this had to be within 90% of the MVC they produced at the beginning of the experiment.

188

Importantly, participants were made aware of this requirement at the beginning of the study

189

(after the MVC and before the main decision-making task). This was intended to ensure that

190

they cared about not becoming over fatigued by always choosing the effortful (high reward,

191

low punishment) choice throughout. Therefore, all participants were encouraged to accumulate

192

as many points as possible (and lose as few points as possible), whilst avoiding unnecessary

193

effort.

194

Effort-based decision-making task

195

The task was adapted from classic effort-based decision-making paradigms (Bonnelle,

196

Manohar, Behrens, & Husain, 2016; Bonnelle et al., 2015; T. T.J. Chong, Bonnelle, & Husain,

197

2016; Le Heron et al., 2018; Skvortsova et al., 2017). There were two trial types: reward and

198

punishment (Figure 1B,C) and the task consisted of one block of each. On a reward trial (Figure

199

1B), participants chose between executing a certain force level in return for reward (gaining

200

points) and skipping the trial in return for 0 points. On a punishment trial (Figure 1C),

201

participants chose between executing a certain force level in return for 0 points and skipping

202

the trial in return for being punished (losing points).

203

On each trial, participants were presented with a combination of points and a force level,

204

which was a percentage of their MVC (offer phase). For the young group, the force was 1 of 6

205

levels: 11, 21, 32, 42 53, 67% of MVC. For both the older age groups (PD and HC), these six

206

levels were: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54% of MVC. The force levels used for the older age groups

207

were lower because a pilot study revealed they fatigued significantly faster than younger

208

participants. At the beginning of each block (reward, punishment), these six force levels were

209

paired with [5 10 15 20 25 30] points respectively. The initial pairings were selected based on

210

pilot experiments. Unbeknown to participants, the points associated with each force level were

211

then adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis using an adaptive staircase algorithm (Parameter

212

Estimation by Sequential Testing; Taylor & Creelman, 2005). Specifically, the points offered

213

were increased or decreased using an initial step size of 8, depending on whether participants

214

rejected (skipped) or accepted the opportunity to execute the force in order to receive (or avoid

215

losing) those points. The step-size was doubled if participants rejected or accepted the offer (a

216

combination of force and points) 3 times in a row, and the step-size was halved if participants

217

reversed their decision on the force level, i.e., an acceptance followed by a rejection on a force

218

level or vice-versa (Taylor & Creelman, 2005). As the staircase procedure was performed

219

independently for each of the six force levels, it allowed us to determine the point of subjective

220

indifference at which participants assigned equal value to acceptance and rejection for each

221

force level. The trial order was randomized across the 6 force levels. Importantly, the points

222

and force combinations offered in the reward and punishment conditions were under the same

223

adaptive procedure as described above, the only difference being whether the points were

224

framed as rewards or punishments (Figure 1 B,C; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981).

225

Following the offer phase, participants indicated their choice by exerting a force on the

226

decision handle which moved the yellow decision cursor (Figure 1A) from the middle of the

227

screen into one of the option boxes (execute force or skip trial). As soon as participants

228

indicated their choice, the unchosen option disappeared. If the force option was chosen,

229

participants were required to execute the force on the handle with this being represented by the

230

blue force cursor moving from the start position towards a target line, and staying above the

231

target line for 4 seconds at which point they heard a cash register sound ‘ka-ching’ from the

232

headphone. If they failed to exert the required force, the trial was repeated. The trial was always

233

terminated 6.5 seconds after their choice. This meant that participants had to wait for 6 seconds

234

if they chose to skip the trial, or they had to produce the required force within 6 seconds. We

235

carefully controlled the time for force execution and skip decisions to be identical so that there

236

was no confound between delay and effort discounting as in previous studies (Doyle, 2010;

237

Loewenstein, Frederick, & O’donoghue, 2002).

238

Data and statistical analysis

239

Data were analysed with Matlab using custom scripts. The data and codes are available

242

effort in order to minimise punishment than maximise reward. For each of the six force levels,

243

we estimated the points at which the probability of accepting the force option was 50% (effort

244

indifference point). Specifically, for each force level, a logistic function (𝑦 = 1+𝑒 −𝛽(𝑥−𝛼)) was

245

fitted to the points offered and the binary choices made by participants (Figure 2). As shown

246

in Figure 2, the effort indifference point was then defined as the reward magnitude (x-axis) at

247

which the sigmoid crossed y = 0.5.

Figure 2: Procedure for determining effort indifference point. Exemplary choices and fits
are shown for one participant and two effort levels (A: level 2; B: level 6) in the reward
condition. A sigmoid function (red line) was fitted separately to the choices (arrow) generated
at each effort level (y axis: 0 = reject force, 1 = accept force), given the points (reward or
punishment) offered for this force level (x-axis). The point of subjective indifference point (IP,
circle) was defined as the magnitude at which the sigmoid crossed y = 0.5.

256

An average effort indifference point (across six force levels) was then calculated for

257

each participant in the reward and punishment conditions (referred to as reward IP and

258

punishment IP respectively), indicating an individual’s tendency to produce force in each

259

condition. Each participant’s loss aversion index was then defined as a ratio between reward

260

IP and punishment IP. A loss aversion index that was larger than 1 indicated loss aversion. Due

261

to non-normalities in the data, a Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test (signrank function in Matlab) was

262

used to test if the loss aversion index for young healthy participants was significantly greater

263

than 1. To assess effort-based loss aversion in PD patients and HC, we compared their loss

264

aversion index using non-parametric independent samples Mann-Whitney U-tests (ranksum

265

function in Matlab). To examine the loss aversion differences in more detail, a two-way mixed

ANOVA compared the average effort indifference point across group (PD vs HC) and

(unequal variance), the effort IP was log-transformed.

depend on cost-benefit analyses. For instance, the subjective value of reward decreases as the

272

physical effort associated with it becomes progressively more demanding (Botvinick,

273

Huffstetler, & McGuire, 2009). This relationship between reward and effort is often captured

274

by effort discounting functions (Białaszek, Marcowski, & Ostaszewski, 2017; Botvinick et al.,

275

2009; Hartmann, Hager, Tobler, & Kaiser, 2013; Klein-Flügge, Kennerley, Saraiva, Penny, &

276

Bestmann, 2015; Prévost et al., 2010). One of the key parameters in an effort discounting

277

function is the discounting parameter, which denotes the steepness of how effort discounts

278

reward. That is, it represents the willingness to invest effort for a beneficial outcome. Therefore,

279

in our effort-based decision-making task, differences in choice behaviours between groups or

280

across reward and punishment conditions could potentially manifest as changes in the

281

discounting parameter of an effort discounting function. To test this, we fitted participant

282

responses using linear, parabolic and hyperbolic effort discounting functions, which are often

283

used to capture effort discounting (Białaszek et al., 2017; Hartmann et al., 2013; Klein-Flügge

284

et al., 2015; McGuigan et al., 2019) . The shape of these functions reflects how increasing costs

285

(i.e., effort) discounts the associated benefits (i.e., gaining rewards, avoiding punishments).

286

The linear model is described by: 𝑆𝑉 = 𝐴 − 𝑙𝐸 (McGuigan et al., 2019), where SV

287

denotes the subjective value of a reward/punishment A. The parameter, E, denotes the effort

288

involved in order to gain a reward or to avoid a punishment, which was the percentages of each

289

individual maximum force (MVC). The parameter, l, is the steepness of the discounting

290

parameter, which can be interpreted as the unwillingness to exert effort. A higher value of l

291

represents less willingness by an individual to expend effort for the given outcomes. The

292

parabolic model is described by: 𝑆𝑉 = 𝐴 − 𝑙𝐸 2 (Hartmann et al., 2013). This function implies

293

that additional effort devalues a reward to a greater extent if existing effort is high rather than

294

low. The hyperbolic model is described by: 𝑆𝑉 = 1+𝑙𝐸 (Mazur, 1987). This function implies

295

that if additional effort is introduced to existing effort, it devalues reward more if the existing

296

effort is low rather than high.

𝐴

297

The model space included all possible combinations of linear, parabolic and hyperbolic

298

effort discounting functions in each of the two conditions performed by PD and HC groups. To

299

compare the models, we utilised Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978).

300

Specifically, for each model, the BIC summed over all participants were compared (the lower

301

the value, the better the model fit) (Rigoux, Stephan, Friston, & Daunizeau, 2014; Stephan,

302

Penny, Daunizeau, Moran, & Friston, 2009). Such aggregation of BIC across participants

303

corresponds to fixed-effect analyses (Stephan et al., 2009). To account for the random-effect

304

analysis in which models are treated as a random variable that can differ between participants

305

(Stephan et al., 2009), we also conducted Friedman’s test on individual BIC to compare the

306

model fits (non-parametric repeated-measures ANOVA).

Evidence for loss aversion in young healthy participants

309

Our first question was to ask if young healthy participants expressed loss aversion

310

during effort-based decision-making. To examine this, we first assessed how the effort

311

indifference point (Figure 2) was affected by force level in the reward and punishment

312

conditions. As expected, the effort indifference point became progressively larger as the force

313

level became more demanding, indicating a sensitivity to effort across reward and punishment

314

conditions (Figure 3A). For each participant, an average effort indifference point was obtained

across force levels for the reward (reward IP) and punishment (punishment IP) conditions, with

316

the loss aversion index being defined as a ratio between these values (>1 = loss aversion; Figure

317

3B). As the loss aversion index was significantly greater than 1 (z=3.65, p<0.001, median=1.37,

318

Figure 3B), it suggests that loss aversion was clearly evident in young healthy participants

319

during effort-based decision-making.

index; y-axis). A value greater than 1 indicates loss aversion.

Similar to the young healthy participants, the effort indifference point for both the HC

(Figure 4A) and PD (Figure 4B) groups increased progressively as the force level became more

352

addition, as the loss aversion index was significantly greater than 1 for both HC (z=3.80,

353

p<0.001, median=2.04, Figure 4C) and PD (z=3.37, p<0.001, median=1.27, Figure 4D), it

354

indicates that loss version was present in both groups. Importantly, PD patients displayed

355

significantly less loss aversion than the HC group (z=2.23, p=0.025, Figure 4E), with this

356

being a result of medicated PD patients appearing less sensitive to punishment (Figure 4F).

357

This was confirmed by a two-way mixed ANOVA which revealed a significant interaction

358

between Group (HC vs PD) and Condition (reward vs punishment) (F[1,36]= 5.22, p=0.028)

359

for the average indifference point. Specifically, Bonferroni-corrected independent t-tests

360

revealed the PD and HC groups had a similar reward IP (p=0.13, Figure 4F), but the PD

group displayed a higher punishment IP (p=0.007, Figure 4F).

373

could potentially manifest as changes in the gradient of an effort discounting function. To test

374

this, we applied computational models of choice behaviours to estimate the subjective value of

375

each offer to each individual. We fitted participant choices to three typical discounting

376

functions. The model space included all possible combinations of linear, parabolic and

377

hyperbolic effort discounting functions in each of the two conditions performed by PD and HC

378

groups. We found that a parabolic effort discounting function provided the best fit for both the

379

PD and HC groups across the reward and punishment conditions (Table 2). Specifically, the

380

summed Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was lowest for the parabolic function (the lower

381

the value, the better the model fit) (Rigoux et al., 2014; Stephan et al., 2009) across groups

382

(HC, PD) and conditions (reward, punishment) (Table 2). To investigate this at a subject-level,

383

a Friedman’s test on individual BIC was performed. In general, similar results were observed

384

with the parabolic function consistently being associated with significantly lower BIC across

385

groups and conditions (Table 2). To reinforce these results, R2 was found to be greater for the

386

parabolic function across all groups and conditions (Table 2). Therefore, there appeared to be

387

no difference in the fundamental pattern of effort discounting between groups or conditions.

388

Using the winning model (parabolic function), we compared parameters across the PD

389

and HC groups. In the reward condition, the effort discounting parameter was found to be

390

similar between the HC and PD groups, suggesting medicated PD patients were equally as

391

motivated to exert effort in return for reward (Figure 5A,B). However, in the punishment

392

condition, the PD groups had an increased effort discounting parameter suggesting they were

393

less willing to exert effort in order to avoid punishment (Figure 5A,C). This was confirmed by

394

a two-way mixed ANOVA that showed a significant interaction between group (HC vs PD)

395

and condition (reward vs punishment) (F(1,37)=6.26, p=0.017). Bonferroni-corrected

Discussion

408

In summary, we have shown that loss aversion is consistently present during effort-

409

based decision-making in young healthy participants and both people with Parkinson’s disease

410

and healthy older adults. Although loss aversion is widely regarded as one of the most robust

411

and ubiquitous findings in economic decision-making (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky

412

& Kahneman, 1992), the surprisingly few studies that have directly examined loss aversion

413

during physical effort-based decision-making have found it to not exist. For instance, Porat et

414

al., (2014) showed that while half of young healthy participants were willing to expend greater

415

effort to avoid punishment than to gain an equivalent reward, the other half showed the opposite

416

preference. In addition, Nishiyama, (2016) found a similarly large degree of variability across

417

participants in preference for maximising gains or minimising losses during an effort-based

418

decision-making task. Therefore, while both studies found differences between gain and loss
19

419

at an individual level, they did not find loss aversion during effort-based decision-making at a

420

group level. However, we believe that there are several issues with the previous studies which

421

may restrict their capacity to directly examine loss aversion during effort-based decision

422

making. First, in Porat et al., (2014) gaining reward or avoiding punishment required the

423

participant to execute additional key presses. As a result, to obtain more reward (or avoid more

424

punishment) the participants had to produce more effort and also had to wait longer. Therefore,

425

the additional effort cost was always confounded with a temporal delay cost. It is worth noting

426

that the temporal discount for losses are generally less steep than that for gains (Estle, Green,

427

Myerson, & Holt, 2006). Importantly, this confound was carefully eliminated in our paradigm

428

as all trials, including the skip option trials, had identical durations. Second, in Nishiyama,

429

(2016), participants were tasked with making a series of choices of whether to engage in an

430

effortful task (to obtain reward or to avoid punishment) via a questionnaire. That is, participants

431

did not actually have to perform an effortful task. The absence of loss aversion could be a result

432

of participants being less sensitive to the imaginary effort involved in a questionnaire. This

433

possibility is supported by our results in which loss aversion is more clearly expressed at higher

434

effort levels.

435

The second key finding of the present study was that people with Parkinson’s Disease

436

(PD) on medication showed a reduction in loss aversion compared to age-matched healthy

437

controls. Importantly, we found that this reduction in loss aversion was due to people with PD

438

investing similar physical effort in return for a reward but being less willing to produce effort

439

to avoid punishment compared to aged-matched healthy controls. Although previous studies

440

have already demonstrated that medicated PD patients are equally as motivated to exert effort

441

in return for reward as age-matched controls (Chong et al., 2015; Le Heron et al., 2018;

442

McGuigan et al., 2019), this is the first study to reveal that medicated PD patients exhibit

20

443

reduced loss aversion during effort-based decision making as a result of a specific reduction in

444

their willingness to produce effort to avoid punishment.

445

To understand this reduced loss aversion in medicated PD patients, one key question is

446

whether it is due to an altered sensitivity to the cost of effort, an altered sensitivity to the action

447

outcomes or a combination of both. It has been repeatedly shown that PD patients exhibit

448

reduced willingness to expend effort in return of a reward, and dopaminergic medication is

449

able to ameliorate this deficit (Chong et al., 2015, Le Heron et al., 2016, Skvortsova et al.,

450

2017). Many earlier studies have also shown that manipulating dopamine can shift the

451

effort/reward trade-off in healthy participants and animals (Bardgett, Depenbrock, Downs,

452

Points, & Green, 2009; Chong et al., 2015; Floresco, Tse, & Ghods-Sharifi, 2008; J. D.

453

Salamone, Correa, Farrar, & Mingote, 2007). However, despite dopamine being clearly central

454

to effort-based decision-making, its precise role is unclear. This uncertainty is because an

455

increased sensitivity to reward or a decreased sensitivity to effort could both explain a similar

456

shift in preference, and the aforementioned studies have been unable to detangle these two

457

possibilities. Recent work has appeared to come to a consensus that dopamine activity have a

458

limited influence on effort cost evaluation during effort-based decision making, whilst there is

459

strong association between dopamine and the action outcome (Le Bouc et al., 2016; Skvortsova

460

et al., 2017; Walton & Bouret, 2019). That is, even if dopamine seems to promote energy

461

expenditure, it only does so as a function of the upcoming reward and not as a function of the

462

upcoming energy cost itself (Le Bouc et al., 2016; Skvortsova et al., 2017). For example, Le

463

Bouc et al., (2016) showed that the bias toward large reward/high effort options under

464

dopaminergic medication is best captured by a model that indicates dopamine increasing

465

sensitivity to action outcomes and not by it decreasing sensitivity to effort costs. Our data also

466

showed that PD patients did not show a generalised reduction in their willingness to engage in

467

effort across the reward and punishment conditions. Therefore, it seems plausible that the

21

468

altered choice behaviour in the PD group was not due to an increase in effort sensitivity but

469

was predominantly driven by an altered sensitivity to the expected action outcomes.

470

Consequently, the reduced loss aversion in medicated PD patients during our effort-

471

based decision-making task could be due to dopamine availability modulating an individual’s

472

sensitivity to reward and punishment-based action outcomes. In the domain of reinforcement

473

learning, dopamine manipulation studies in healthy participants and PD patients have revealed

474

that the balance between learning from reward and punishment is strongly modulated by

475

dopamine availability (Cools, Altamirano, & D’Esposito, 2006; Frank, 2005; Frank et al.,

476

2004). Specifically, increases in dopamine enhance reward-based learning while impairing

477

punishment-based learning, and decreases in dopamine enhance punishment-based learning

478

while impairing reward-based learning. Relatively recently, studies have extended these

479

effects of dopamine from reinforcement learning to decision-making under risk, showing that

480

dopamine modulation can influence an individual’s sensitivity to positive versus negative

481

action outcomes in ways very similar to the dopaminergic effects on learning (Collins & Frank,

482

2014; Shiner et al., 2012; Smittenaar et al., 2012). This suggests that dopamine availability

483

might shape loss aversion across contexts by changing an individual’s sensitivity to reward-

484

and punishment-based action outcomes (Clark & Dagher, 2014; Timmer et al., 2017).

485

Therefore, in the context of the current study, medicated PD patients exhibited reduced loss

486

aversion because they had a normal sensitivity to reward-based action outcomes but a reduced

487

sensitivity to punishment-based action outcomes. However, demonstrating that the dissociable

488

influence of dopamine availability on reward- and punishment-based action outcome

489

sensitivity is independent of context would require further investigation. Specifically, PD

490

patients would need to show similar changes in loss aversion across decision-making under

491

risk and effort-based decision-making tasks, and this would need to be modulated by

492

medication state.

493

To counter this argument though, previous work has shown that the benefit/cost

494

analysis with different decision costs (e.g., effort, risk and delay) involve separable brain

495

regions. For example, the critical neural signature of effort-based decision-making has been

496

reported in the cingulate cortex, and not the ventromedial prefrontal cortex as typically

497

described for decision-making under risk (Klein-Flügge et al., 2016). Alternatively, therefore,

498

the current results could also be explained by effort being represented by separable dopamine-

499

dependent brain regions when associated with reward or punishment-based action outcomes,

500

rather than dopamine specifically influencing action outcome sensitivity. For instance, multiple

501

studies have shown that when associated with reward effort is evaluated by dopamine-

502

dependent brain regions such as the cingulate cortex, putamen and supplementary motor area

503

(SMA) (Bonnelle et al., 2016; Hauser et al., 2017; Klein-Flügge et al., 2016). Although no

504

study has investigated how effort is represented when associated with punishment, both the

505

dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula are involved in effort (Croxson, Walton,

506

O’Reilly, Behrens, & Rushworth, 2009; I. T. Kurniawan, Guitart-Masip, Dayan, & Dolan,

507

2013; Rudebeck et al., 2006; Walton, Bannerman, & Rushworth, 2002), and independently

508

punishment processing (Nitschke et al., 2006; Palminteri, Khamassi, Joffily, & Coricelli, 2015).

509

Therefore, there is at least a suggestion, that similar brain regions are involved in the processing

510

of effort and punishment which are independent of the reward system.

511

In conclusion, loss aversion is clearly present during effort-based decision-making and

512

it can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This presents interesting future questions

513

surrounding clinical disorders that have shown a reduced willingness to exert effort such as

514

depression and stroke. For example, it is possible that disorders that have shown a reduced

515

willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward could show a normal, or even enhanced,

516

willingness to exert effort in order to avoid punishment.
