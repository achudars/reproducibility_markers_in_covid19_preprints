Abstract

24

We developed a discrete and qualitative model of integrated socio-ecosystems, with the help of

25

formal Petri nets. We illustrated such Petri nets in the case study of temporary marshes in the

26

Mediterranean part of France, the Camargue delta, by integrating biotic, abiotic and human-related

27

components along with their processes into the same interaction network. The model demonstrated

28

that when marshes are exposed to extensive grazing the presence of marsh heritage species is

29

facilitated by opening up the vegetation through various trajectories. This supports the commonly

30

used management practice of extensive grazing to conserve certain protected habitats. With this

31

Possibilistic approach, we identified all potential ecosystem trajectories and provided their

32

differential (non-systematic) impacts on heritage species richness (number). Hence, we rigorously

33

demonstrate with this new type of model that grazing benefits marsh species which are faced with

34

competition from common grassland species. The detailed analysis of the explicit state space and

35

trajectories allows exploring simultaneously the identification of a range of recommendations for

36

management strategies.

Introduction

41

Historically, ecosystems have been predominantly studied through a focus on species communities

42

embedded into the environment, thereby reducing the abiotic part to a simplified resource input or

43

as an external source of perturbations (e.g. Kéfi et al. 2016; Thébault and Fontaine 2010). Yet, abiotic

44

components are an intrinsic part of the biophysical and socio-economical entity that defines an

45

ecosystem, thus playing a key role in its dynamics through various feedbacks (Frontier et al. 2008;

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/823294; this version posted November 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

46

Gaucherel 2019). Nowadays most ecologists are convinced that an integration of all abiotic, biotic

47

and even human components is required to improve our understanding of ecosystem functioning.

48

In the context of impacts of global changes, biophysical interactions and the influence people have

49

on ecosystems, are transforming the ecosystem structure, sometimes drastically so (Cincotta et al.

50

2000; Cumming et al. 2014; Ostrom 2009). Unfortunately, despite a common assumption that

51

integration of abiotic, biotic and human components is required to understand how ecosystem

52

structure may be affected, attempts in this line are considerably outnumbered by studies dedicated

53

to simplified systems or to single elements (but see Geijzendorffer et al. 2017; Titeux et al. 2017). In

54

addition, the integration of components of multiple dimensions also enlarges the window of

55

potential ecosystem transitions to an extent that is difficult to manage in a computational and

56

comprehensible manner. In this paper, we propose a conceptual and methodological framework to

57

develop a generic model of ecosystem functioning and development (i.e. structural changes over the

58

long term, Gaucherel et al. 2017).

59
60

Modeled biotic interactions have been defined as trophic or non-trophic ones (Thébault and Fontaine

61

2010), parasitic or pollinic ones (Campbell et al. 2011), competition or facilitation (Lefever and

62

Lejeune 1997), or, more rarely, a combination of several kinds simultaneously. Recently, multiplexes

63

have been proposed to represent several types of interactions between the same species nodes

64

within the same ecological network (Brose et al. 2006; Kéfi et al. 2016), thereby strongly simplifying

65

the overall ecosystem. Multiplexes are models that intend to grasp a subset of processes that play a

66

dominant role in the overall system dynamics (fates) and, in particular, to study the effects of

67

interactions (i.e. processes between two or more system components) on the system stability.

68

When not limiting system models to species interactions only, they could also be used to integrate

69

abiotic, biotic and human components and related processes to study their combined impact on

70

socio-ecosystem components and structures (i.e. the shape of the interaction network). The model

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/823294; this version posted November 5, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

71

can then be used to study trajectories (i.e. pathways combining successive atomic transitions) of

72

these systems under different scenarios. Although this may pose methodological challenges, it seems

73

feasible to develop a more holistic interaction network (i.e. made up of a large number of biotic,

74

abiotic and human components and their related processes). Knowledge on how to develop

75

integrated networks is already available with parameterisation of the model being a known hurdle

76

(Frontier et al. 2008; Gaucherel et al. 2019; Ricklefs and Miller 2000). To handle potentially huge and

77

complex interaction networks, new kinds of models and/or methods of simplifications are required.

78

Here, we demonstrate two different ways to simplify the study of ecosystem trajectories: first, we

79

model qualitative interaction networks, as already explored in biology (Reisig 2013); secondly, we

80

focus only on the structural changes of this network (Gaucherel and Pommereau 2019; Gaucherel et

81

al. 2017). In other words, we model network (topological) changes instead of dynamics (fluxes)

82

within a frozen network.

83

The objective of this study was to explore the diversity of trajectories of a socio-ecosystem structure

84

that becomes possible when integrating abiotic, biotic and human components. Depending on the

85

way an interaction network has been defined, structural changes best represent long term dynamics

86

like the arrival of invasive species or pollutants, species extinctions or human migrations. Here, we

87

illustrate the “ecosystem development” concept for a vulnerable ecosystem within the European

88

habitat Directive; the Mediterranean temporary marshes, located in the Camargue, South of France

89

(Beltrame et al. 2013; Grillas and Roché 1997) and their conservation poses several challenges

90

(Medail et al. 1998; Rhazi et al. 2006). Temporary marshes are fragile ecosystems often subjected to

91

grazing as part of the management (Beltrame et al. 2013; Duncan 1992). The general current

92

understanding being that grazing reduces the cover of dominant species, which are often common

93

species, thereby creating space for new or rare species (Chambers and Prepas 1990; Gough and

94

Grace 1998). However, this understood impact of grazing on vegetation greatly depends on the

95

intensity of the grazing (Noy-Meir et al. 1989; Sternberg et al. 2000) and negative conservation

96

impacts from grazing regimes are not uncommon (Bouahim et al. 2010). An increased understanding

97

of the impact of grazing on these fragile ecosystems would allow to adjust the conservation

98

management plans (Beltrame et al. 2013; Duncan 1992).

99

To develop an integrated network model of these marshes, we borrowed a formalism (a

100

mathematical framework) from theoretical computer sciences which was conceived to handle large

101

network changes: a qualitative Petri net. Petri nets belong to the wide category of discrete modelling

102

formalisms (Giavitto and Michel 2003; Pommereau 2010). Such models have proven powerful when

103

applied to biological networks but, to our knowledge, are almost absent in ecology (but see Baldan et

104

al. 2015; Gaucherel and Pommereau 2019; Gaucherel et al. 2017). We demonstrate the ability of

105

Petri nets to integrate abiotic, biotic and human components of a system and to handle its sharp

106

changes over the long term. For this purpose, we defined two contrasting scenarios of temporary

107

marsh systems: marsh dynamics without and with extensive grazing. In a reductionist view, we listed

108

all the extensive grazing impacts (e.g. trampling, browsing or fertilizing effects) possibly observed on

109

various marsh vegetation types, thus avoiding more intensive actions. We then tested the hypothesis

110

that, in a holistic (integrated) view of the system, grazed marshes would favour the presence of

111

typical marsh biodiversity (heritage species) in comparison to non-grazed marshes, in good

112

agreement with the intermediate disturbance theory (Fox 2013; Wilkinson 1999). Additionally, we

113

demonstrated that our qualitative model is able to identify a diverse and comprehensive range of

114

trajectories (also called the “development”, i.e. all future states and structural changes) of the

115

integrated socio-ecosystem which allow for the identification for a rich set of management

116

recommendations. We finally discussed the properties of this innovative approach.

Temporary marshes in Camargue

120

Temporary Mediterranean marshes are defined as small shallow depressions (<10 ha and less than

121

2m depth) fed by precipitation in autumn or spring (Fig. 1a). These ecosystems are characterized by a

122

natural alternation of flooding and drying out phases providing a niche for many aquatic, amphibian

123

and terrestrial species (Grillas et al. 2004). Temporary marsh allows the development of an adapted

124

flora rich in aquatic (e.g. Zannichellia

125

thus totally dependent on water dynamics (Grillas and Roché 1997). Similarly, the temporary marsh

126

fauna usually show a two-phase life cycle (Grillas et al. 2004), such as for remarkable amphibian

127

species (e.g.

128

absent (Grillas and Roché 1997). Moreover, the abundance of plant and animal resources in these

129

marshes make them a feeding habitat for many birds (e.g. Anas crecca), as well as for wild mammals

130

(e.g. Sus scrofa) and domestic ones (e.g. cattle).

131

Domestic cattle (e.g. equines and bovines) graze marshes during their terrestrial phase and/or their

132

drying out phase. The act of grazing entails various disturbances such as trampling, browsing or

133

fertilizing inputs (Mesléard and Perennou 1996). In the Tour du Valat domain, in the Camargue delta,

134

temporary (non-brackish) marshes account for 250 ha. Within the model, we do not consider any

135

other major disturbance than the extensive grazing by domestic animals, excluding thereby the

136

potential impact of invasive species and assuming no connection with permanent water bodies

137

(Duncan 1992; Grillas and Roché 1997; Mesléard and Perennou 1996). Here, we developed a spatially

138

implicit model (although it is possible to take into account for spatial units in the ecosystemic graph,

139

Gaucherel et al. 2012), every processes occurring at the same place in the temporary marsh. Also, we

143

An integrated ecosystem Petri net

144

To test our central hypothesis, we used the species community as a proxy of ecosystem structure

145

changes. To analyse the impacts of grazing on a subset of species uniquely linked to the temporary

146

marshes in Camargue, we successively modelled: i) the hydrology of a temporary pool, ii)

147

requirements of domestic animals, and iii) characteristics of species of the temporary marsh

148

ecosystems with conservation value. We represent the ecosystem by its interaction network and

149

with an ecosystem graph made of material components, the nodes, connected through their related

150

(immaterial) processes, the edges. For each set of processes, we identified the components of

151

interest based on literature and expert knowledge (Table 1), namely: surface water for temporary

152

ponds, bovines and equines for domestic mammals and species of conservation value listed by the

153

Tour du Valat (Grillas et al. 2004; Mesléard and Perennou 1996). The definition and integration of

154

these components and their processes were populated using literature and interviews with experts

155

at the Tour du Valat research institute (Appendix 4, Tables S5 and S6, with references therein).

156

This resulted in a qualitative model consisting of 46 components with 105 interactions stricto

157

and 57 interaction constraints, standing for mandatory processes (Fig. 1b and Appendix 3). To gain

158

objectivity, all modelled components should be connected to other components (i.e. at least one

159

process impacts it, and at least one process depends on it). We call such connected nodes

160

characterized

161

best described components are those associated with the central question addressed (i.e. concerning

162

species grazed by domestic animals and related species of temporary marshes (Appendix 4, Tables S5

163

and S6)). Finally, the remaining semi-characterized components were fixed if they had an impact on

164

the defined ecosystem but were not influenced by it (e.g. components relative to the atmosphere

165

and to grazing). The resulting model handles Boolean components (i.e. being functionally present or

166

absent) and qualitative processes (being executed or not, not to be confused with Boolean

167

functions), to ultimately explore all possible ecosystem developments in the future from an initial

Petri Nets and a simplistic Predator-prey model

172

We illustrate here the functioning of the model using a simplistic predator-prey system (Fig. 2).

173

Additional details on the principle and uses of Petri nets can be found in literature (Gaucherel and

174

Pommereau 2019; Pommereau 2010; Reisig 2013) and in Appendix 2. The ecosystem Petri net itself

175

is developed in three successive steps: a) an intuitive graph (i.e. a set of components and their

176

related processes) is built to represent the studied ecosystem based on the leading question; b) we

177

then transform this ecosystem graph into a formal model based on Boolean components and

178

evolution rules; the components have an initial value that define the initial state; c) applying these

179

rules on the initial state allows computing new states, causally linked, on which the processes may be

180

repeated until no new state can be computed; this progressively yields the state space of the system;

181

d) to avoid building the state space by ourselves, we translate the rules into a Petri net with SNAKES,

182

a software tool (Pommereau 2015); e) the state space of the Petri net (also called its marking graph)

183

is always strictly equivalent to the state space we would have obtained at step (c). It is worth noting

184

that steps (d) and (e) are usually hidden to the users who directly get the state space (c) obtained

185

from the marking graph (e).

186

Any ecosystem can be represented as a multi-digraph (i.e. a directed graph with parallel edges). In

187

this graph, every material component of the ecosystem (e.g. abiotic: precipitation; biotic: species;

188

human: domestic cattle) is represented by a

189

component is functionally present in the system, also denoted “+” or ON) and “absent” (functionally

190

absent of the system or “-” or OFF). In the simplistic example predator-prey system only two nodes

191

are defined: the prey and the predator populations. Any state

192

“+” and “-” nodes (Fig. 2b). The maximal number of possible system states is 2#nodes and grows

193

exponentially with the number of nodes. The rules correspond to any physicochemical, bio-ecological

194

and/or socio-economic processes (e.g. if there are no preys there are no more predators), and thus

195

represent all possible interactions between nodes composing the ecosystem studied. In the

196

predator-prey system, two rules only are defined: R1, the predation itself: the predator eats the prey,

197

and R2, the mortality: without prey, the predator dies (Fig. 2b and 2c). In the Petri net language,

198

nodes are called places and rules are called transitions, both being connected through (oriented) arcs

199

(Fig. 2d).

200
201

A separate rule describes the

202

realization” (see Appendix 2 for formal definitions). For a rule to be applied the state of the node

203

must satisfy its application condition; the rule is then said to be “enabled”. If so, the application of

204

the rule modifies the state of the nodes as stipulated in its realization part; the rule is fired. The firing

205

of a rule, including testing its condition, is always atomic (i.e. no other rule can interfere during the

206

firing). In the predator-prey system, the rules are written as R1: P+, N+ >> N- and R2: N-, P+ >> P- (Fig

207

2b). Since the rules modify node states, they change the overall system state (i.e. the state of the

208

system aggregates all node states). Therefore, the entire system shifts from one state to another one

209

through the discrete successive application of rules (Fig. 2c). The repeated execution of the rules

210

progressively produces the state space, which provides the set of all system states reachable by the

211

rules defined (Fig. c); this can be equivalently (and more conveniently) obtained through the Petri net

212

and its marking graph. As a corollary, the system states are connected to each other by some of

213

these rules in the state space too. The size of this state space is usually much smaller than the

214

number of possible system states, because the computation starts from a specific initial condition

215

and because rules have specific application conditions. We develop some tools to automatically

216

compartmentalize large state spaces into merged (simplified) state spaces (Appendix 2).

217

Firing a rule independently to some others often leads to unrealistic trajectories (e.g. removing water

218

without removing fishes in it). Therefore, we defined particular rules, called

219

the model from reaching such unrealistic (socio-ecological) trajectories. Constraints have a condition

220

and a realisation part, just as rules

221

the system state. The sole difference between rules and constraints is that constraints have priority

222

on rules stricto sensu. In the predator-prey system, the system state S1 = (N-, P+) may be considered

223

as unrealistic; so, the rule R2 may be transformed into a constraint (C1:

224

state, the model first computes all trajectories opened up by the defined constraints and then only,

225

when all the system states obtained are realistic (i.e. there is no longer any enabled constraint), the

226

enabled rules are fired (Fig. 2c). In brief, the discrete model proposed here is qualitative, mechanistic

227

(processes are explicit), deterministic (no stochasticity but with several outcomes) and asynchronous

Methodology and scenarios

232

The impact of grazing on the marsh species is studied by comparing two contrasting scenarios,

233

namely no grazing (noted NG for non-grazing) and seasonal extensive grazing by bovines (SBG for

234

seasonal bovine grazing). The latter scenario corresponds to extensive bovine grazing during spring

235

and summer, and to the absence of bovine in winter and fall (seasons during which bovines graze

236

more productive lands, Duncan 1992; Grillas and Roché 1997). For an easier comparison, each

237

scenario is simulated on the basis of the same sets of nodes and rules; only their initial states differ.

238

This allows some rules to be enabled in one scenario but not in the other one, thus corresponding to

239

contrasted development for the same ecosystem, i.e. contrasted NG and SBG sequences of states. As

240

a consequence, each scenario leads to a specific state space. Since both scenarios are based on the

241

same nodes and rules, a subset of system states will be in common (except for the node modified in

242

the initial state). We will first plot the histograms and basic statistics of presence/absence counts of

243

the marsh species (ranging from zero to a maximum of seven species with conservation value) in

244

each state space to quantitatively visualise the similarity and differences between both scenarios.

245

Both (NG and SBG) initial states consider a temporary marsh to contain water in spring, with a

246

Phragmites australis

247

“Bovine” and “Seasonal bovine grazing”, fixed and semi-characterized nodes. This initial state allows

248

four constraints to be enabled at each season shift (Appendix 4, Tables S5 and S6). As each state

249

space is explicitly computed (i.e. all states are known and described), we may compute the present

250

and absent nodes in each state and look for states satisfying specific criteria (Appendix 2). In

251

addition, we developed specific tool to

252

to automatically compute the strongly connected components (SCCs) of state spaces, which are

253

structural stabilities gathering interconnected ecosystem states. All states of the final merged state

254

space are analyzed in terms of vegetation types and average number of marsh species with

255

conservation value. In such analyses, we will plot both NG and SBG merged spaces colored by

256

averaged species numbers and by (downward) location relatively to the initial state. Finally, we will

257

perform two principal component analyses (PCAs) on the two merged state spaces to analyze details

258

in the dominant (merged) trajectories reached by the ecosystem.

259

In the modelling approach presented here, every

260

changes of the ecosystem is represented as a node, while every (immaterial) process is represented

261

as an oriented edge between two or more nodes. Such an informational conception of ecosystems is

262

based on a theoretical view still under test (Gaucherel et al. 2019). The Petri net engine allows to

263

mathematically formalize the topological changes of the integrated interaction network (Gaucherel

264

et al. 2017). By this way, every ecological process (e.g. predation, parasitism, pollination or

265

competition) has a formal and qualitative definition whose consequences in the network changes can

266

be rigorously assessed, and merged with others (Fig. 2). In a second step, this approach allows

population. The initial state of the SBG scenario has two more present nodes:

handling the node and edge changes (the topology) of the interaction network. As the state space of

269

the system is equivalent to the defined Petri net (Gaucherel and Pommereau 2019), it becomes

270

possible to explore all reachable trajectories of the ecosystem, and then to identify sustainable or

271

potentially unwanted trajectories. The model provides results that resemble those of differential

272

equations, while equations focus on singular, statistically most probable trajectories only

273

(Dambacher et al. 2003; Thébault and Fontaine 2010). In addition, our qualitative model strongly

274

differ to others by the fact that a set of rules differs from functions, not providing a unique value

275

output, and possibly grasping conflicting and even opposite responses of variables (nodes).

State space and general analyses

279

The initial states NG and SBG lead to two different states spaces showing 1.6 and 1.54 106 states,

280

respectively (Fig. 3a). Both state spaces have 1.19 106 states in common, hereafter called the

281

reference set. By removing this reference set, we identified exclusive states for the scenario without

282

grazing (NG

283

is much more aggregated (58.59 % of the state successors of any NG state are also in this set) than

284

the SBG set (6 % only), thus showing an exclusive dynamics. Moreover, the SBG set is associated with

285

a significant increase in number of species with conservation value (p-val < 2-16, Fig. 3a).

286

The NG set suggests a marsh undergoing a strong drying out due to the lack of bovine-induced

287

processes: the states of this set encompass less surface water (SW, Table 1), a saturated soil (Ssoil),

288

more brackish and saline soil (Brsoil, Sasoil) and long drought (Dr). Indeed, all these nodes appeared

289

significantly higher in the NG set than in the reference set (p-val < 2-16). The SBG set is characterized

290

by a high frequency of spring states, but this frequency does not impact the number of species with

→ 4.04 10 states) and with seasonal bovine grazing (SBG→ 3.53 10 states). The NG set

to the NG scenario. Indeed, the SBG set contains states with significantly higher numbers of

294

helophytic species than in the reference set (p-val <2-16). The merged state spaces of NG and SBG

scenarios (Fig. 3b) highlight the dominant trajectories of the ecosystem. As the model is causal, it is

Ecosystem development and scenarios

300

The merged state spaces of NG and SBG scenarios highlighted the dominant trajectories of the

301

ecosystem in terms of average species numbers in strongly connected components (colors in Fig. 4a

302

and 5a). So, in terms of conservation needs, red instead of blue sets of states (SCCs) should

303

preferably (and may) be avoided. The variance distribution of the state space, using a principal

304

component analysis (PCA) performed on SCC profiles (node compositions), does not provide a simple

305

biological interpretation for the number of species with conservation value (Fig. 4b): no univocal

306

correlation exists between species number and marsh properties. Indeed, the NG scenario produced

307

a merge state space made up of seven SCCs, gradually and irreversibly shifting toward a final and

308

huge SCC with herbivory (number 0, Fig. 4a). The NG variance distribution of the PCA decreased

309

sharply with 48.8 % (resp. 22.2 %) of the total variance obtained from the first (resp. two) main PCs.

310

The PC#1 is closely related to climate and seasonal variations, with spring on negative values (left

311

hand side, with wet system states) and winter, autumn (all dryer states) on positive side (Fig. 4b,

312

right side). The PC#2 is mainly related to the marsh vegetation and helophyte types, between rushes

313

on negative values and scirpae (scirpus

314

seasons. When locating the SCCs in the PC1/PC2 plane (Fig. 4b), we follow the dominant trajectory of

315

316

wet and richer system states, and reversely then (Fig. 4b, left side, dashed arrows). Such state spaces

317

precisely illustrate a socio-ecosystem duality, with some PCA axes dedicated to biotic components

318

and processes, some others to abiotic ones.

319

The SBG scenario produced a much more complex merge state space made up of 34 SCCs, gradually

320

and irreversibly shifting toward four final SCC groups (#1639 group A, 30715, 23379, 207642 and

321

205458 group B, 198407 and 201777 group C, and 192310 and 184877 group D, Fig. 5a, ellipses). The

322

SBG variance distribution of the PCA decreased sharply with 41.5 % (resp. 17.8 %) of the total

323

variance obtained from the first (resp. two) main PCs (Fig. 5b). The PC#1 is closely related to climate

324

and seasonal variations and opposite to the NG PC#1 (i.e. wet and higher species numbers). The PC#2

325

is mainly related to the marsh vegetation types, with reeds C on positive values, and scirpae group A

326

on negative ones). Most ecosystem trajectories under NG are projected in the upper part of the SBG

327

scenario merged space (not shown), thus confirming that bovines are later on reducing the marsh

328

salinity, opening up the lower strata of vegetation and thus providing longer trajectories (i.e. with

329

higher discrete steps) with more monospecific vegetation types (the groups). When locating these

330

SCCs in the PC1/PC2 plane (Fig. 5b, left side), the ecosystem basically shifts from a rich and wet

331

(spring) state on average to a relatively dry ecosystem with various vegetation type. Yet, going back

332

to the corresponding state space colored by the number of species with conservation value (Fig. 5a),

333

final SCC groups are not systematically the poorest states, or the richest ones. So, optimal

334

trajectories may be selected on this basis, in particular focusing on some decisive SCCs (SCCs number

335

590014, 314211 and 140448, Fig. 5b arrows) from which the ecosystem irreversibly shifts toward

336

some specific and less diversified groups (ellipses). Indeed, the model demonstrates that the system

337

may not recover previous states after reaching these so-called terminal SCCs (Fig. 5a).

338

The trajectories projected by the model, notably the long-term effects of extensive bovine grazing,

339

would be almost impossible to obtain through long-term experiments or by more traditional

340

modeling method. Additionally, the results of the model demonstrate which negative transitions can

either the management of the herd or the system hydrodynamics.

Discussion

345

This study is a step towards a more integrated understanding of any complex socio-ecosystem as a

346

whole, simultaneously to a long term trajectory analysis. It avoids excluding any ecosystem

347

component or process type from the conceptual framework proposed here (Gaucherel et al. 2019),

348

with a system simplification taking place only in later stages of the model building. The interaction

349

network (graph) representation, combined to a topological handling of it, allows reaching this

350

genericity in ecosystem integration. The size and complexity of the model remains feasible mainly

351

due to its fully qualitative conception, thus allowing a generic but rigorous formalization of the

352

ecosystem development

353

sciences and in biology, for example on molecular signalling networks (Blätke et al. 2011) but, to our

354

knowledge, they have never been applied in ecology. Other qualitative models were used for

355

ecological studies, yet focused on small and rather unrealistic interaction networks (Dambacher et al.

356

2003; Gaucherel and Pommereau 2019).

(Gaucherel et al. 2017). Similar models have been developed in computer

Extensive grazing favours temporary marsh biodiversity

359

In this paper, we illustrated the integrated model with a Petri net approach in the specific case study

360

of temporary Mediterranean marshes in the Camargue. Temporary marshes studied here are

361

protected habitats located in a wetland landscape and hosting several heritage species (Beltrame et

362

al. 2013; Grillas and Roché 1997). Temporary Mediterranean marshes are recognised as a vulnerable

363

habitat in the European Habitat Directive and, as such, form the direct object of conservation

364

management plans. One of the means that is often included in conservation management plans to

365

maintain this habitat includes extensive grazing, but this management entails costs as in most

366

economical-ecological balance (Cote and Nightingale 2012; Cumming et al. 2014). Comparing the

367

results from scenarios without and with extensive grazing confirms and even demonstrates the

368

hypothesis that extensively grazed marshes tend to on average host more species with conservation

369

value (Fig 4a & 5a). This observation is in good agreement with the literature (Bouahim et al. 2010;

370

Noy-Meir et al. 1989; Sternberg et al. 2000). Our innovative applied approach also confirms that the

371

increase or decrease of marsh species richness is not systematic, suggesting that is not unequivocally

372

related to abiotic (hydro-climate) and anthropic (grazing) influences (Fig. 4a-5a, varying colored

373

trajectories). Basically, the model suggests that bovines by their trampling and grazing tend to reduce

374

the salinity of the marsh and then open up the vegetation toward lower strata of the vegetation.

375

Whereas, at high stocking rates, monospecific vegetation outcomes are more likely (either rushes,

376

scirpae or reeds, Fig. 5b).

377

To validate the system development (trajectories) as coherent is a kind of expert

378

validation

379

and qualitative models (Reisig 2013): either the model is deemed

380

trajectories, at least, are observed or logical), or the model is deemed

381

modeled are known/observed). Here, we assumed a list of potentially isolated processes, to finally

382

deduce and confirm a known overall (holistic) behaviour of the studied socio-ecosystem. While each

383

process included in the marsh model was validated independently either by literature or experts

384

(Appendix 4, Table S5-S6), their numerous feedbacks and the integrated response of the ecosystem

385

as a whole was not preconceived.

386

Here, we were interested in a set of species specifically linked to temporary Mediterranean marshes

387

(Appendix 3, Table S2), and we modelled an increase in these number of these species under

388

extensive bovine grazing (i.e. correctness). This observation is in good agreement with what

389

specialists know about temporary marshes (Beltrame et al. 2013; Grillas and Roché 1997; Rhazi et al.

390

2006), and with the intermediate disturbance theory (Fox 2013; Wilkinson 1999). This theory

391

suggests that species number of temporary marshes would, over the long term, decrease under no

392

or under intense grazing regimes (Duncan 1992; Grillas et al. 2004), due to differential negative

393

impacts of cattle on vegetation. Here, we focused on extensive bovine grazing, but many other

394

impacts on the ecosystem components have been neglected (e.g. invasive species). These

395

trajectories under various grazing pressures are a qualitative validation of our model able to recover

396

them. Although our found ecological results have already observed in previous studies, this paper

397

demonstrates that our innovative model and conception (Gaucherel et al. 2019) is capable to capture

398

and reproduce this well-known behaviour of such complex socio-ecosystems. Given that it covers

399

multiple transitions simultaneously, it becomes a valuable help for management to identify

400

sustainable scenarios by taking into account all relevant components and processes (Beltrame et al.

401

2013; Mesléard and Perennou 1996). Conversely, such a qualitative model appears quite powerful in

402

the context of few or lacking data and knowledge on the studied socio-ecosystem, as it would require

403

a simplified qualitative assessment on hypothesized processes. Both these perspectives appear at

404

hand.

405
406

Power and drawbacks of discrete models for ecosystem development

407

An increasing number of integrated ecosystem models are being developed today (e.g. Gaucherel

408

and Pommereau 2019; Ings et al. 2009; Kéfi et al. 2016), and with them the integration of abiotic,

409

biotic and human components is also improving. Although the number of ecosystem models

410

increases (Dambacher et al. 2003; Lafond et al. 2017; Thébault and Fontaine 2010), they usually focus

411

on relatively short term fluxes created by frozen structures and rarely on alternative developmental

412

(structural) trajectories. In addition, tools to handle the component integration and a rigorous

413

(formalized) system framework are still lacking. In this paper, we developed a discrete, qualitative

414

and non-stochastic model, based on Petri nets (Pommereau 2010; Reisig 2013), to analyse system

415

properties and long term changes (fates). These kinds of models can potentially be extended into

416

quantitative, spatially explicit and multi-temporal schemes to allow more realistic and applied

417

analyses. The real strength of Petri net models is to exhaustively explore all possible trajectories.

418

Indeed, to focus on qualitative (structural) changes of the system or on topological changes of the

419

whole interaction network is equivalent to explore the system changes over a long time period

420

(Gaucherel and Pommereau 2019; Gaucherel et al. 2017).

421

These early Petri nets of ecosystems are in a preliminary stage and still require a number of

422

improvements. For example, as in every modelling task, the model definition remains partly

423

subjective and dependent on the network definition (Blätke et al. 2011; Gaucherel and Pommereau

424

2019). In ongoing works, we are testing strict protocols for model building and analyses, for instance

425

in the characterization of nodes (Appendix 3). These protocols increase the objectivity in the choice

426

of nodes and processes when defining the ecosystem model. Also, sensitivity of the model may vary

427

depending on individual components and processes. More research is required to develop sensitivity

428

tests and, thus, a deep understanding of the impact of this variability on its emergent properties.

429

Also, the PCA statistics used here help analyzing the computed state space, but are not yet an

430

interpretation tool in such possibilistic space. Finally, the calibration and validation stages remain real

431

challenges for such integrated and exhaustive (Possibilistic) models. Developing a qualitative rather

432

than a quantitative model significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be collected for the

433

parameterisation: the model is an abstraction and remains simple. The cost of this simplicity is the

434

model validation, often limited to expert knowledge on known ecosystem trajectories (Gaucherel

435

and Pommereau 2019). As in any model, unknown trajectories cannot be validated nor easily

436

dismissed.

437

The demonstrated model approach simplifies interannual interactions and processes (i.e. ecosystem

438

functioning), and focuses on long term and structural changes in the ecosystem trajectories. Since

439

the famous Clements/Tansley debate about the organismic nature of any (socio-)ecosystem

440

(Gaucherel 2014; Gaucherel et al. 2019; Gignoux et al. 2011), related concepts to understand

441

ecosystem dynamics have been regularly proposed. These include concepts such as vegetal

442

successions, regime shifts or resilience (Holling 1973; Walker et al. 2004), but these generally focus

443

on one single component of a complex system (e.g. the vegetation) and/or one type of changes (e.g.

444

temperature shifts). The demonstrated modelling approach is one of the few concepts that can grasp

445

all interactions that underlie the structural and qualitative changes at a system level, whatever the

446

ecological or human interactions (Geijzendorffer et al. 2017; Ostrom 2009), and we identified here all

447

the components and processes responsible for specific responses of the integrated socio-ecosystem

Figure 1. Diagram of the Camargue delta (a), with photographs of a temporary marsh, and the

578

ecosystem graphs (b) defining the temporary marsh model. The Camargue is located between the

579

Mediterranean sea and the city of Arles (a), south of France, and hosts numerous temporary marshes

580

(a, insert) alternatively drying and filling up during the year. We modeled such marshes with 46

581

components (nodes, b) connected through 105 interactions stricto

Figure 2. Illustration of a simplistic predator-prey system (a), with its associated Petri net (b), its

585

qualitative dynamics (c), and marking graph (d). The system is made of two components, the prey (N)

586

and predator (P) populations, and two interactions connecting them (rules R1 and R2), as seen on the

587

automaton (a). The corresponding Petri net is made of four places (P+, P-, N+, N-) and two transitions

588

R1 and R2, where unlabeled arcs have weight 1 (b). Starting with the presence of both populations, it

589

is possible to list all system states encountered (c), and to connect them with the rules (absent nodes

590

and inactivated rules are displayed in grey). The net is depicted in the initial state (c), and the

591

successive states may be deduced from the token circulation seen in the dynamics (b). The marking

592

graph of the Petri net (d) is depicted with each state number (S0, S1, S2) referring to the dynamics

593

described above (b). Notice that a specific state of the system (S3) may not be reached from this

594

initial condition and with these rules (d).

of the PCA (b, left), and each component is colored according to its location on PC1. The statistical

611

analysis (b, right) is easily interpreted according to the projections of the ecosystem nodes involved
