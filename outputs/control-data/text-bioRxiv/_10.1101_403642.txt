ABSTRACT.
Trisomy 21 (T21) causes Down syndrome (DS), affecting immune and neurological function by
unknown mechanisms. We report here the results of a large metabolomics study showing that
people with DS produce elevated levels of kynurenine and quinolinic acid, two tryptophan
catabolites with potent immunosuppressive and neurotoxic properties, respectively. We found
that immune cells of people with DS overexpress IDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the
kynurenine pathway (KP) and a known interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Furthermore, we found
a positive correlation between levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and KP dysregulation.
Using metabolic flux assays, we found that IFN stimulation causes IDO1 overexpression and
kynurenine overproduction in cells with T21, dependent on overexpression of IFN receptors
encoded on chromosome 21. Finally, KP dysregulation is conserved in a mouse model of DS
carrying triplication of the IFN receptors. Altogether, these results reveal a mechanism by which
T21 could drive immunosuppression and neurotoxicity in DS.

INTRODUCTION.
Down syndrome (DS) is caused by triplication of chromosome 21 (chr21), which occurs in
approximately 1 in 700 live births, representing the most common chromosomal abnormality in
the human population1. Trisomy 21 (T21) impacts multiple organ systems during development
and causes an altered disease spectrum in people with DS, significantly increasing their risk of
developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) 2, leukemias3, and numerous autoimmune conditions1,4-7,
while protecting them from solid malignancies 3,8. However, DS-associated phenotypes are
highly variable among individuals with DS, even for conserved phenotypes such as cognitive
impairment and predisposition to early onset AD9,10. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the
mechanisms driving such phenotypic variation could illuminate not only mechanisms of
pathogenesis, but also opportunities for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies to serve this
population. Furthermore, these mechanistic insights could also benefit larger numbers of
individuals in the typical population affected by the medical conditions that are modulated, either
positively or negatively, by T21.
In order to identify molecular pathways that could contribute to both the altered disease
spectrum experienced by the population with DS as well as the inter-individual phenotypic
variation, our group previously analyzed transcriptomes11 and circulating proteomes12 from
several cohorts of individuals with DS compared to euploid individuals (D21, controls). These
efforts revealed that multiple cell types from people with DS show transcriptional signatures
indicative of constitutive activation of the interferon (IFN) response11, which could be explained
by the fact that four of the six IFN receptors (IFNRs) are encoded on chr21: the two Type I IFNR
subunits (IFNAR1, IFNAR2), one of the Type II IFNRs (IFNGR2), and IL10RB, which serves
both as a Type III IFNR subunit and also a subunit of the receptors for IL-10, IL-22, IL-26 and IL2813. Furthermore, plasma proteomics analyses demonstrated that people with DS show signs
of chronic autoinflammation12, including elevated levels of potent inflammatory cytokines with

known ties to IFN signaling (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, MCP1). However, it remains to be defined how
this obvious immune dysregulation contributes to DS-associated phenotypes, including the
diverse neurological manifestations of T21. To gain further insight into this area, we investigated
metabolic changes caused by T21 in the plasma of people with DS.
Here, we report the results of a large plasma metabolomics study of individuals with DS
using untargeted, highly sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
technology. The most significantly dysregulated metabolite identified was quinolinic acid (QA), a
tryptophan (TRP) catabolite with well characterized neurotoxicity, which has been repeatedly
associated with diverse neurological disorders, and which is produced by activation of the
kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP)14. Indeed, people with DS have elevated QA, KYN and
KYN/TRP ratio, all established markers of KP activation. We found that circulating immune cells
of individuals with T21 show significant overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1
(IDO1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the KP and a known IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induced by
both Type I and II IFN ligands15-17. Using cell-based metabolic flux assays, we found that IFN-
stimulation leads to super-induction of IDO1 and hyperactivation of the KYN pathway in cells
with T21, and this requires overexpression of both Type I IFNR subunits encoded on chr21.
Furthermore, we found positive correlations between circulating levels of key inflammatory
cytokines, including TNF-α and IFN-λ, and KP activation in people with DS. Finally, we found
that a mouse model of DS carrying triplication of the IFNR gene cluster, Dp(16)1/Yey, shows
increased levels of KYN relative to wild type littermates. Given the well-established neurotoxicity
of QA, the association of KP dysregulation with wide range of neurological conditions18-33, as
well as the immunosuppressive function of KYN34, our results point to KP activation as a
contributing factor to neurological and immunological phenotypes in DS.

Trisomy 21 induces the kynurenine pathway.

In order to identify metabolic pathways that are consistently dysregulated by T21, we
collected plasma samples from two fully independent cohorts: the Translational Nexus Clinical
Data Registry and Biobank (referred hereto as Cohort 1), and the Crnic Institute’s Human
Trisome Project (www.trisome.org, NCT02864108, referred hereto as Cohort 2). Cohort 1
included 49 individuals with T21 and 49 euploid (D21) individuals, while Cohort 2 consisted of
26 T21 and 41 D21. The breakdown of participants according to age and sex are reported in
Supplementary Data 1. While Cohort 1 was balanced for karyotype but imbalanced for age,
Cohort 2 was more age-balanced, with a bias towards females in both groups. When the two
cohorts were combined, age, sex, and karyotype are more evenly distributed, which prompted
us to analyze the cohorts both individually and in combination. It should be noted that our
protocol excluded participants with recent or active infections. To determine metabolite
abundance, we performed untargeted, LC-MS metabolomics on plasma samples from each
cohort. The combined analysis workflow is outlined in Supplementary Fig. 1a with details
available in the Methods. This approach led to the identification of 91 KEGG-annotated
metabolites detected in both cohorts. To identify the metabolites that were consistently
differentially abundant between people with and without DS, we applied a robust linear modelfitting approach that accounted for age and sex35 to data from each of the cohorts
(Supplementary Data 2). We observed both differences and overlap in the differential
metabolite profiles when analyzing Cohorts 1 and 2 individually. However, due to the relative
quantification by untargeted LC-MS, we observed an overall difference in the distributions of
metabolite abundances between cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Therefore, to mitigate
imbalances within the separate cohorts and to increase statistical power, we completed a
combined cohort analysis by modeling age and sex covariates, along with fitting each cohort as
a batch effect. Using this linear model fit, the distributions of metabolite abundance overlap and
are thus comparable (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

When the combined total of 165 samples in the two cohorts were analyzed for the 91
metabolites using this linear model fit accounting for age, sex, and cohort, we identified 29
metabolites that were significantly differentially abundant according to a false discovery rate
(FDR)-adjusted p-value on a Student’s t-test of 0.0536 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 2) .
Consistent with earlier reports37,38, L-serine and L-tyrosine were found to be depleted in people
with DS (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1d). Depletion of L-homocysteine (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 1d), which has also been previously observed in people with DS39, could
be attributed to the localization of the cystathionine-beta-synthase gene (CBS) on chr21. Among
the upregulated metabolites, we observed succinate and 2-hydroxyglutarate, two metabolites
related to the TCA cycle (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1d). Elevated succinate levels have
been previously reported in people with DS and were interpreted as a sign of mitochondrial
dysfunction38, but succinate upregulation is also an established marker of inflammation40. Other
upregulated metabolites included the antioxidant molecules dehydroascorbate and mannitol
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1d)41,42. The most significantly dysregulated metabolite in this
analysis was QA, an intermediate in the TRP catabolic pathway that ultimately leads to
synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +). In fact, of the 11 measured metabolites
in the TRP pathway annotated by KEGG, we found five to be differentially abundant in people
with DS: KYN, QA, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetate are upregulated, while indole and indole-3acetaldehyde are downregulated (Fig. 1a-c, Supplementary Fig. 2a).
In vertebrate cells, there are three major catabolic pathways for TRP, leading to the
production of serotonin, NAD+, or indole (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Conversion of TRP to
KYN represents a major pathway for catabolism of ingested TRP, eventually leading to NAD+
production, and accounting for removal of up to 99% of TRP not used in protein synthesis43.
Remarkably, KYN itself, and the neurotoxic downstream product QA, are significantly
elevated in people with DS (Fig. 1a,b). In contrast, picolinic acid (PA), a neuroprotective

derivative of KYN, is not different between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Accordingly, the KYN/TRP and QA/PA ratios are both significantly higher in people with DS
(Fig. 1d).
Altogether, these results indicate that a major metabolic impact of T21 is dysregulation of
TRP catabolism toward increased activity in the KP. Importantly, activation of the KP has
been implicated in myriad neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, and elevation in the
KYN/TRP and QA/PA ratios have been linked to the development of neurological conditions
such as Alzheimer’s disease21-24, Huntington’s disease25,26, AIDS/HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorder27-29, Parkinson’s disease44, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis30,31, and
multiple sclerosis32,33. Additionally, KYN has potent immunosuppressive functions 34.
Therefore, we focused our efforts on elucidating the mechanisms driving activation of the KP
in DS.
Activation of the KP is associated with IDO1 overexpression and elevation of specific
inflammatory cytokines.
In order to investigate potential mechanisms driving the elevated levels of KYN and QA in
people with DS, we performed transcriptome analysis of circulating white blood cells (WBCs) in
a third cohort of 19 adult individuals, 10 of them with T21 (see Supplementary Data 1 for
information on Cohort 3). We interrogated this dataset to assess possible alterations in the
expression levels of various enzymes catalyzing different reactions in the KP (see
Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). This exercise revealed a significant increase in the expression level
of IDO1, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the KP, in people with DS (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Data 3). The only other significant change observed was a decrease in
kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), the enzyme that converts KYN into 3-hydroxykynurenine
(Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). Given that IDO1 is a well-characterized ISG, known to be
stimulated by both Type I and II IFN signaling 15-17, this systemic IDO1 overexpression could be

explained by our earlier finding that different immune cell types from people with DS show
consistent hyperactivation of the IFN response11. Thus, these results indicate that the observed
activation of the KYN pathway in people with DS could be explained simply by higher levels of
IFN signaling and IDO1 overexpression.
We recently reported the results of a large plasma proteomics study of people with DS12,
which revealed that T21 causes changes in the circulating proteome indicative of chronic
autoinflammation, including elevated levels of many cytokines acting downstream of IFN
signaling. Therefore, we tested whether there was a correlation between levels of inflammatory
cytokines and KP by using a Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) assay to measure a panel of 55
cytokines in the plasma samples from the 67 participants in Cohort 2. First, this analysis
confirmed the previously reported upregulation of several cytokines in people with DS, including
TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, VEGF, and IL-22 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 4)12. Furthermore, we
identified several additional inflammatory markers as dysregulated in individuals with T21,
including C-reactive protein (CRP) and IFN-λ, also known as IL-29 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary
Data 4). To investigate the relationship between KYN and each of the cytokines measured, we
calculated Spearman’s rank correlations and found ten significant correlations (Supplementary
Data 5). At the top of this list were three cytokines known to be activated downstream of IFN,
the proinflammatory molecules TNF-α and IP-10 (IFN-γ induced protein 10, CXCL10), as well as
the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 5). Furthermore, the fourth
strongest correlation with KYN levels was the Type III IFN ligand IFN-λ (Fig. 2c,
Supplementary Data 5), which is interesting as IFN-λ has also been shown to induce
expression of IDO145.
Taken together, these data indicate that increased KYN levels are associated with IDO1
overexpression and increased levels of specific inflammatory markers in vivo, consistent with
constitutive IFN activation and immune dysregulation in DS.

Trisomy 21 sensitizes cells to super-induction of the KP via increased IFNR gene dosage.
Given the wealth of potential mechanisms that could alter TRP catabolism in individuals with
DS, including differences in medical histories, existing co-morbidities, dietary regimes, and
medication intake, we asked whether KP dysregulation could be observed at the cellular level.
Toward this end, we employed cell-based metabolic flux experiments using heavy isotopelabeled (13C15N) TRP on a panel of age- and sex-matched skin fibroblasts derived from
individuals with and without T21. Given the widely-established fact that the KP is activated by
Type I and II IFN signaling15-17, we chose to perform these experiments before and after IFN-α
stimulation. Matched western blot analysis showed that T21 fibroblasts display much stronger
induction of IDO1 protein expression relative to D21 cells (Fig. 3a-b). Remarkably, IFN-α
stimulation produced a significant, time-dependent depletion of the isotopic TRP in T21 cells,
but not supernatant (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 6), concurrent with
a significant increase in KYN levels in the supernatant, but not in cells (Fig. 3d, Supplementary
Fig. 3b). Accordingly, the KYN/TRP ratios were most significantly elevated upon IFN-α
stimulation in T21 cell cultures, consistent with more pronounced consumption of intracellular
TRP and subsequent secretion of elevated levels of KYN in cells of people with DS (Fig. 3e,
Supplementary Fig. 3c,d).
Next, we tested whether the observed super-induction of IDO1 and the KP by IFN in T21
cells is due to the extra copy of the Type I IFNRs encoded on chr21 (IFNAR1, IFNAR2), using
both shRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR-based knock-out approaches. First, we stably
knocked down IFNAR1 expression in one of the T21 cell lines by >90% with a specific shRNA
that did not affect IFNAR2 expression (T21-shIFNAR1, Fig. 3f). Knocking down IFNAR1
resulted in a reproducible decrease in IFN-α-induced IDO1 expression at both the mRNA and
protein levels (Fig. 3f,g). Independently, we also co-transduced two independent guide RNAs

(gRNAs) targeting the first exons of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which created a population of T21
fibroblasts expressing ~50% of both the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 mRNAs relative to the parental
cell line (T21-IFNAR1/2KO, Fig. 3f). Notably, such reduction in the expression of both Type I
IFNRs completely abolished overexpression of IDO1 mRNA and protein in response to IFN-α
stimulation, bringing it down to levels comparable to those observed in the D21 cell line (Fig.
3f,g). We then repeated the metabolic flux experiment with isotope-labeled TRP on this panel of
T21 cell lines with reduced IFNR expression during a 24-hour time course of IFN-α treatment.
Remarkably, the T21-IFNAR1/2KO cell line showed significantly reduced levels of KYN in both
cells and supernatants, as well as significantly reduced KYN/TRP ratios (Fig. 3h-i,
Supplementary Fig. 3e-f). Furthermore, the T21-shIFNAR1 cell line showing intermediate
IDO1 expression displayed a partial rescue of elevated KYN levels in cells, but not supernatants
(Fig. 3h, Supplementary Fig. 3f).
Altogether, these results indicate that IDO1 induction by IFN-α is highly sensitivity to IFNR
dosage, providing a mechanism by which T21 could sensitize cells to IFN-dependent superactivation of the KP. These results also demonstrate that KP dysregulation is observed at the
cellular level, indicating that the elevated levels of KYN and QA in the circulation of people with
DS is likely driven by the trisomy, rather than other variables.
Tryptophan catabolism is selectively disrupted in the Dp(16)1/Yey mouse model of DS.
To test the impact of various groups of genes encoded on human chr21 on TRP
metabolism, we employed three cytogenetically distinct mouse strains carrying segmental
duplications syntenic to human chr2146: Dp(10)1/Yey (Dp10), Dp(16)1/Yey (Dp16), and
Dp(17)1/Yey (Dp17), which have triplication of ~35 genes from mouse chr10, ~120 genes from
chr16, and ~20 genes from chr17, respectively, and compared them to wild type C5Bl/6 mice
(WT) (Fig. 4a). We prepared plasma samples from age- and sex-matched cohorts comprised of
these strains and measured KYN using LC-MS. Interestingly, we found that the only strain with

significantly increased basal plasma KYN levels relative to WT mice was the Dp16 model, which
is the largest segmental duplication, and the one harboring the four IFNRs homologous to those
found on human chr21: Ifnar1, Ifnar2, Ifngr2, and Il10rb (Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Data 7).
Furthermore, we and others have previously shown that not only are the IFNRs overexpressed
in this model, but downstream IFN signaling is chronically activated on numerous tissues
including blood and brain11,47. These results are consistent with a genetic basis for the observed
dysregulation of the KYN pathway, and further implicate triplication of the IFNR locus as a key
contributor.
DISCUSSION.
The developmental and clinical impacts of T21 in the population with DS are diverse and
highly variable, with many co-morbidities showing increased prevalence in this population
relative to typical people. Despite many research efforts in this area, little is known about the
molecular pathways that drive the various co-morbidities common in DS. Clearly, identification
of these pathways could facilitate the design of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to serve
this at-risk population via precision medicine approaches. An obvious impact of these
approaches would be in the management of diverse neurological conditions showing increased
prevalence in this population, including, but not restricted to, early onset AD2, epilepsy48,
depression49, and autism 50. Another key area of interest is in the management of immunerelated disorders. On one hand, people with DS show increased incidence of autoimmune
disorders such as autoimmune hypothyroidism 51, celiac disease7, and myriad autoimmune skin
conditions52, indicating a hyperactive immune system. Conversely, people with DS show
increased risk to specific bacterial infections, with bacterial pneumonia being a leading cause of
death53. Our results point to dysregulation of the KP as a potential contributing factor to the
development of some neurological and immunological phenotypes in people with DS, with
obvious diagnostics and therapeutic implications as described below.

People with DS constitute the largest population with a strong predisposition to AD, which is
attributed to the fact that the APP gene is located on chr212. By age 40, virtually all individuals
with DS present the brain pathology of AD; however, the age of dementia diagnoses is highly
variable, with some individuals being diagnosed in their 30’s, while others remain dementia-free
in their 70’s10. Therefore, the population with T21 provides a unique opportunity to identify
mechanisms that modulate the impact of amyloidosis to either accelerate or delay AD
development. Interestingly, the KP has been consistently implicated in AD progression. Multiple
studies have reported elevated levels of metabolites in the KP in people with AD, and, in many
of these studies, KP dysregulation has been positively correlated with AD progression (reviewed
in54). Furthermore, IDO1 inhibition reversed AD pathology in a mouse model of AD55. Based on
these observations, it is possible to hypothesize that individuals with DS showing the strongest
degree of dysregulation in the IFN➝IDO1➝KYN axis may also display earlier onset and faster
progression of AD. Clearly, testing this hypothesis will require a significant effort, including a
multi-dimensional, longitudinal analysis of IFN signaling, KP dysregulation, and various metrics
of the AD pathological cascade in people with DS.
Beyond AD, it is possible that KP dysregulation is a contributor to other neuropathologies
more prevalent in DS, such as epilepsy/infantile spasms/seizures, depression, and autism 48-50.
KYN and QA were shown to promote seizures in mice, rats, and frogs, and QA was found to be
elevated in mouse models of epilepsy, leading to the characterization of QA as an ‘endogenous
convulsant’ with a pathogenic role in seizure disorders (reviewed in56). The role of TRP
catabolism in depression is undisputed, with a prominent role for serotonin depletion as a
causative event, leading to the widespread therapeutic use of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs). Importantly, activation of the KP shunts TRP away from serotonin synthesis,
causing serotonin depletion, which led Lapin and others to propose the ‘kynurenine hypothesis’
of depression57. Furthermore, induction of the KP could not only drive serotonin deficiency, but

also promote depression-associated anxiety, psychosis, and cognitive decline58. Although we
did not observe a significant depletion of serotonin in our research participants with DS
(Supplementary Fig. 2a), future studies could investigate whether individuals with DS
diagnosed with depression show increased activation of the KP concurrent with serotonin
depletion. Notably, it has been amply documented that therapeutic administration of IFN-α can
induce depression, leading Wichers et al. to propose that IDO1 induction (and consequent
neurotoxicity) was the principal pathophysiological mechanism 17. Regarding autism,
independent cohort studies have documented dysregulation of KYN metabolism in patients
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder 59,60, as demonstrated by increased KYN/kynurenic
acid ratios60 and elevated levels of QA59. The higher prevalence of autism in people with DS,
coupled to our finding of increased levels of KYN in plasma from people with DS, support the
growing notion of neuroinflammatory processes in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.
In addition to the recognized neurological conditions discussed above, KP dysregulation
could contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with DS. The acute effects of KP
metabolites, QA in particular, on cognitive function are well-documented14,61. QA is a potent
neurotoxin that acts as an excitotoxic agonist of NMDA receptors. Importantly, KP dysregulation
in DS could explain a large body of work showing beneficial effects of memantine, an NMDA
antagonist that protects from QA-mediated neurotoxicity, in animal models of DS62-64. Of note,
memantine is an approved drug for the treatment of AD, which is currently being tested in a
follow-up Phase II clinical trial to improve cognition in young adults with DS (NCT02304302).
The initial pilot trial showed benefits on a subset of neurocognitive measures 65, and a second
independent trial, which focused on adults 40 years and older, showed no effects in any of the
endpoints66. However, we posit here that the limited therapeutic effect of this drug is due to its
action at a very downstream step in the pathway, and that inhibitors of IDO1 or IFN signaling
(e.g. JAK inhibitors) should be considered.

Finally, it is important to note that the KP plays major roles in immune control. KYN is a
potent immunosuppressive metabolite promoting ‘immune privilege’ in tissues such as the brain,
testes, and gut, but which is also exploited by some tumor types to evade immune
surveillance34. Hyper-activation of the KP in people with DS upon immune stimuli may affect key
cell types involved in autoimmunity, such as regulatory T cells, and it may represent an
immunosuppressive negative feedback mechanism downstream of exacerbated IFN signaling.
Given that people with DS are highly predisposed to myriad autoimmune disorders, and that
pneumonia lung infections are a leading cause of death in people with DS53, our results justify
future investigations to define the role of KP dysregulation in multiple common co-morbidities in
DS.

Materials and Methods
Human cohorts and sample collection
All human subjects in this study were consented according to Colorado Multiple Institutional
Review Board (COMIRB)-approved protocols. Written informed consent was obtained from
parents or guardians of participants under the age of 18, and assent was obtained from
participants over the age of 7 who were cognitively able to assent. Deidentified plasma samples
were obtained from the Translational Nexus Clinical Data Registry and Biobank (University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, COMIRB #08-1276) for 49 individuals with DS and 49
controls without DS. Additionally, plasma samples for 26 individuals with DS and 41 controls
were obtained through the Crnic’s Institute Human Trisome Project (University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus, COMIRB #15-2170, www.trisome.org). Plasma was collected in
Vacutainer tubes (EDTA – purple capped or Lithium heparin – light green capped) and stored at
-80°C. Participant medical history was collected by the respective biobanks. A third cohort of 19
individuals (10 with T21), was recruited through the Human Trisome Project for RNAseq
analysis of white blood cells (WBCs).
Metabolomic sample preparation
For plasma analyses (human and mouse plasma), a volume of 50 µl of was extracted in 450 µl
of ice cold lysis buffer (methanol:acetonitrile:water 5:3:2). For cell-based experiments, 1x106
cells were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer. In both protocols, incubation with lysis buffer was
followed by vortexing for 30 minutes at 4°C. Separate extractions for hydrophobic metabolites
(including oxylipids) were performed in ice cold methanol with similar ratios and workflows.
Insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (10 minutes at 4°C and 10,000 g) and
supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C until analysis. UHPLC-MS metabolomics
analyses were performed using a Vanquish UHPLC system coupled online to a Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). Samples were resolved over a Kinetex

C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) at 25°C using a three
minute isocratic condition of 5% acetonitrile, 95% water, and 0.1% formic acid flowing at 250
µl/min or using a 5 min gradient at 400 µl/min from 5-95% B (A: water/0.1% formic acid; B:
acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) and a 17 min gradient ((A) water/acetonitrile (75/25, vol/vol) with 5
mmol/L ammonium acetate and (B) 2-propanol/acetonitrile/water (50/45/5, vol/vol/vol) with 5
mmol/L ammonium acetate). Compounds of interest were monitored and quantified in negative
ion mode against deuterium-labeled internal standards. MS analysis and data elaboration were
performed as described67,68. To monitor possible technical variability, technical replicates were
run for both cohorts. Briefly, for the plasma samples from each cohort, aliquots of each of the
individual samples were combined to make technical replicates, which were run as described
above. Additionally, in each experiment, several buffer aliquots were run as blanks for artifact
identification.
Metabolomics data processing
Metabolite assignments to KEGG compounds were performed using MAVEN (Princeton, NJ,
USA) on the basis of accurate intact mass, retention time and MS/MS69,70. Isotopologue
distributions in tracing experiments with 13C15N-tryptophan were also analyzed with MAVEN and
Compound Discoverer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany). Peak areas were exported for
further statistical analysis with R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Data
sets from each of the two studies were log2 transformed. To perform differential expression
analysis, the limma R package (v3.32.10) was used to fit a linear model to the data with age,
sex, and cohort as covariates35. log2 fold change, p-value and adjusted p-value were calculated
for the T21-D21 comparison using an unmoderated Student’s t-test and the false discovery rate
(FDR) method for multiple testing correction36. Adjusted p-values are shown in the volcano plots
and reported on the box plots. For displaying data per sample on the boxplots, we plotted the

adjusted intensity values for each metabolite produced by the removeBatchEffects function in
the limma R package using age, sex and cohort as covariates.
RNAseq sample prep
Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes (BD, 366643) from ten individuals with
T21 and nine D21 controls. Blood was centrifuged at 500 g for 15 min to separate plasma, buffy
coat and red blood cells. White Blood Cells (WBCs) were isolated from the buffy coat fraction by
RBC lysis and washed with our sorting buffer (see below) according to manufacturer’s instructions
(BD, 555899). WBCs were cryopreserved in CryoStor CS10 Freezing Media (#210102) at ~10
million cells/mL. WBCs were awoken by quick thawing at 37 C and immediately spiked into 9 mL
of sorting media and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min and the media removed. Cells were lysed in
600 µL RLT plus (Qiagen) and Beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) lysis buffer (10 µL BME:1 mL RLT
plus). RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, 80004). RNA quality was determined by Agilent 2200
TapeStation and quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies). Samples with RIN of 6.8 or greater and
a minimum of 1 µg were sent to Novogene for stranded library prep and 2x150 paired-end
sequencing.
RNAseq data analysis
Analysis of library complexity and high per-base sequence quality across all reads (i.e. q>30) was
performed using FastQC (v0.11.5) software (Andrews 2010). Low quality bases (q<10) were
trimmed from the 3’ end of reads and short reads (<30 nt after trimming) and adaptor sequences
were removed using the fastqc-mcf (v: 1.05) tool from ea-utils. Common sources of sequence
contamination such as mycoplasma, mitochondria, ribosomal RNA were identified and removed
using FASTQ Screen (v0.9.1). Reads were aligned to GRCh37/hg19 using TopHat2 (v2.1.1, -b2-sensitive --keep-fasta-order --no-coverage-search --max-multihits 10 --library-type frfirststrand). High quality mapped reads (MAPQ>10) were filtered with SAMtools (v1.5). Reads

were sorted with Picardtools (v2.9.4) (SortSAM) and duplicates marked (MarkDuplicates). QC of
final reads was performed using RSeQC (v2.6.4). Gene level counts were obtained using HTSeq
(v0.8.0,--stranded=reverse –minaqual=10 –type=exon –idattr=gene_id --mode= intersectionnonempty, GTF-ftp://igenome:G3nom3s4u@ussd-ftp.illumina.com/Homo_sapiens/UCSC/hg19/
Homo_sapiens_UCSC_hg19.tar.gz). Differential expression was determined using DESeq2
(v1.18.1) and R (v3.4.3).
Cell culture
Human fibroblasts were described previously11. For the metabolic flux experiment, cells were
cultured in 5 mg/L 13C11 15N2 L-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, 574597) for 72 hours prior to
stimulation with 10 ng/mL IFN-α (R&D Systems, 11101-2). Media was prepared
by adding 120 µL of 10 mg/mL stock 13C11 15N2 L-tryptophan in 1x PBS to 240 mL of RPMI
(Corning, 10-040) in 10% Dialyzed FBS (Sigma, F0392) and 1x Anti-Anti (Gibco, 15240-062).
Cells were treated with 10 ng/mL IFN-α or vehicle by adding 6 µL of 0.2 mg/mL IFN-α or 1x PBS
to 120 mL of heavy labeled media. Cell lysates and media were collected at 0, 1, 6, and 24
hours following initial application of the heavy tryptophan and IFN-α. LC-MS metabolomics
profiling was performed as described above, and tryptophan catabolites were identified by their
13

C and/or 15N peaks.

Generation of shRNA and CRISPR cell lines
To generate lentiviral particles 3.0e6 HEK293FT cells were transfected with 10 µg shIFNAR1
(TRCN0000059013, GCCAAGATTCAGGAAATTATT), IFNAR1 gRNA (Human GeCKO Library
A 22695, AACAGGAGCGATGAGTCTGT), or IFNAR2 gRNA (Human GeCKO Library A 22697,
GTGTATATCAGCCTCGTGTT) plasmid, and 10 µg of packaging viral mix (3:1 pD8.9:pCMVVSVG) using PEI in a10 cm plate. 2 mL of freshly harvested lentiviral particles were then used
to transduce 1.0e5 T21 cells in each well of a 6-well plate. The cells were expanded to 10 cm
plates before starting puromycin selection (1 µg/mL).

Fibroblast IFN stimulations and Western blots
Cells were plated at equal densities (~33,000/cm 2) and allowed to attach overnight. The next
day, IFN-α (R&D Systems, 11101-2) was added at 10 ng/mL in RPMI (Corning, 10-040) and
cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, 25200-056) at 0, 1, 6, and 24 hours. Trypsin was
quenched by adding RPMI with 10% Dialyzed FBS (Sigma, F0392). Cells were pelleted at 200 g
for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were washed with 1x PBS, then resuspended in RIPA buffer
containing 1 μg/mL pepstatin, 2 μg/mL aprotonin, 20 μg/mL trypsin inhibitor, 10 nM leupeptin,
200 nM Na3VO4, 500 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 μM NaF. Suspensions
were sonicated at six watts for 15 s two times and clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 10
min at 4°C. Supernatants were quantified in a Pierce BCA Protein Assay and diluted in
complete RIPA with 4x Laemmli sample buffer. Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis was used to separate 20–40 μg protein lysate, which was transferred to a
0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat
dried milk or 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% TWEEN
(TBS-T) at room temperature for 30 min. Immunoblotting was done using primary antibodies
against IDO1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 86630), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
365062) overnight in 5% non-fat dried milk or 2.5% BSA in TBS-T at 4°C while
shaking. Membranes were washed 3x in TBS-T for 5–15 min before probing with a horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody in 5% non-fat dried milk at room temperature
for one hour. Membranes were again washed 3x in TBS-T for 5–15 min before applying
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution. Chemiluminensence signal was captured using a
GE (Pittsburgh, PA) ImageQuant LAS4000.
Q-RT-PCR
Total RNA was harvested from cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and reverse transcription was carried out using the Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA kit
(Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative PCR was carried out with reference

to a standard curve using SYBR Select Master Mix for CFX (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher
Scientific) on a Viia7 Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies/Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
normalized to 18S rRNA signals. Primers used for qRT-PCR were as follows (5’ to 3’): 18S-F,
GCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG; 18S-R, CTTTCGCTCTGGTCCGTCTT; IDO1-F,
CCGTAAGGTCTTGCCAAGAAATA; IDO1-R, GTCAGGGGCTTATTAGGATCC; IFNAR1-F,
GATTATCAAAAAACTGGGATGG; IFNAR1-R, CCAATCTGAGCTTTGCGAAATGG; IFNAR2-F,
GGTTCTCATGGTGTATATCAGC; IFNAR2-R, GCAAGATTCATCTGTGTAATCAGG.
Fibroblast flux data analysis
Prior to plotting, flux data was batch-adjusted and measurements from biological replicates were
summarized on time-course plots as the mean value of the replicates +/- the standard error of
the mean. P-values were calculated in R with a Student’s t-test and used the FDR method for
multiple testing correction.
Mesoscale discovery assay and correlation of cytokines to KYN levels
The Mesoscale Discovery Human Biomarker 54-Plex was combined with U-Plex reagents for IFNα2a, IFN-β, and IL-29 (IFN-λ), to measure a total of 57 cytokines from 500 μL of plasma from
each of the 67 individuals in Cohort 2 per manufacturer’s instructions. To visualize the effect of
karyotype on each cytokine, the MSD data from the both the D21 and T21 samples were z-scored
using the mean and standard deviation from the D21 group. Significantly differentially expressed
cytokines were determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in R and an FDR-adjusted p-value
threshold of 0.05. Prior to correlation analyses, both MSD data and metabolomics data were
adjusted for age and sex using the linear model fitting procedure described above. Spearman’s
rank correlations and p-values were calculated in R using the cor.test function. Adjusted p-values
used FDR for multiple testing correction.

FIGURE LEGENDS.
Figure 1 – Trisomy 21 induces the kynurenine pathway.
a) Differentially abundant metabolites in plasma samples from individuals with T21 were
identified using a linear model adjusting for age, sex, and cohort. Metabolites that increased in
the T21 group are shown in red and metabolites that decreased in the T21 group are blue. The
horizontal grey line represents an adjusted p-value of 0.05. b) Boxplots showing log2 adjusted
intensities for significantly differentially abundant metabolites. p-values were calculated using
the linear model from a and the FDR method for multiple testing correction. c) Boxplots showing
log2 adjusted ratios as indicated. p-values were calculated using an unmoderated t-test on the
linear model in a.
Figure 2 – Elevated KYN levels are associated IDO1 overexpression and circulating
inflammatory markers.
a) Scatter plot showing mRNA expression of IDO1 in white blood cells from controls (D21) and
individuals with T21. Statistical significance was calculated using DESeq2. mRNA expression
values are displayed in reads per kilobase per million (RPKM). b) Heat map showing
significantly different cytokines identified in Mesoscale Discovery Assay in Cohort 2. Data from
both the D21 and T21 samples were z-scored using the mean and standard deviation from the
D21 group. Significant differences were assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an
FDR-adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05. c) Scatter plots comparing kynurenine levels to those
of the four most significantly correlated cytokines, TNF-α, IP-10, IL-10, and IFN-λ. Spearman’s
rho (𝜌) and FDR-corrected p-values are indicated for each pair.
Figure 3 – Trisomy 21 sensitizes cells to super-induction of the kynurenine pathway by
IFN-α.

a) Western blot analysis demonstrating upregulation of IDO1 over a 24 hour time course in an
age- and gender-matched pair of fibroblasts with (T21) or without (D21) trisomy 21. b) Western
blot analysis confirming IDO1 super-induction in multiple T21 fibroblasts after 24 hours of IFN-α
treatment. 1-3 are cell lines from typical people, 4-6 are cell lines from age- and gendermatched individuals with trisomy 21. c) Metabolic flux experiment using heavy-labeled (13C15N)
tryptophan in fibroblast cell lines (n = 3 T21, n = 3 D21). Levels of heavy-labeled tryptophan in
D21 (left) and T21 (right) fibroblast cell lysates, with or without IFN-α treatment. d) Levels of
heavy-labeled kynurenine in D21 (left) and T21 (right) supernatant, with or without IFN-α
treatment. e) Ratio of heavy-labeled kynurenine in supernatant to heavy-labeled tryptophan
levels in cells in D21 (left) and T21 (right) supernatant, with or without IFN-α treatment. At each
timepoint, the p-value between the Ctrl and IFN+ samples was calculated using a two-tailed
student’s t-test (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001). f. Q-RT-PCR showing relative levels of
IFNAR1, IFNAR2, and IDO1, in the indicated cell lines. T21-shNon-T indicates cell line
expressing a non-targeting shRNA. T21-shIFNAR1 indicates cell line expressing a shRNA
targeting IFNAR1. T21-IFNAR1/2KO indicates a cell population transduced with guide RNAs
targeting the first exons of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. mRNA expression is expressed relative to 18s
ribosomal RNA. g. Western blot showing effects of modulating IFNAR levels as in f on induction
of IDO1 after six hours of IFN-α stimulation. h. Levels of heavy-labeled kynurenine in the
indicated cell lines during a 24 hour time course of IFN-α treatment. i. Ratio of heavy-labeled
kynurenine to heavy-labeled tryptophan levels in the indicated cell lines during a 24 hour
timecourse of IFN-α treatment. At each timepoint, the p-value between the parental T21 cell line
and each T21 cell line with modified IFNAR levels was calculated using a two-tailed student’s ttest (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
