ABSTRACT
There is a growing evidence that a subset of microglia, disease-associated microglia
(DAM), is crucially involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer Disease (AD).
However, it has been challenging to comprehensively know how DAM affects neuronal loss
and reconstitute the complicated cellular composition. Here, we describe the relationship
between neuronal reconfiguration and microglia by digitally dissecting the human brain
transcriptome. We observed DAM enrichment associated with neuronal loss and the degree of
amyloid deposits, which was commonly found in different brain regions. The neuronal
subtype analyses showed that DAM enrichment was correlated with the proportion of two
excitatory neurons located in the cortical layer 4. The direction of these relations was
opposite, which implied excitatory neuronal reconfiguration in the specific cortical layer. Our
results suggested immune reaction represented by DAM might mediate the reconfiguration of
cellular components in AD, which may eventually have implications for diagnostics and
therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
The most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is
pathologically characterized by neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS) and the
presence of amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain (1). In spite of these
characteristic pathologic markers, a major challenge is to understand the cellular and
molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration and to dissect the components of CNS damage
that eventually causes clinical symptoms represented by gradual memory loss. So far, the
overall neuronal loss is found in the hippocampus at the early stage, which explains memory
disturbance and followed by progression in the entire cerebral cortex (2, 3). However, as it
was impossible to dissect the components of CNS damage at the cellular level, particularly
for the human brain, the roles of cellular subsets in neurodegeneration were poorly
understood.
Due to recent new techniques including next-generation sequencing and the single-cell
transcriptome analysis, disease-associated microglia (DAM), a subset of microglia was
discovered in the AD mouse model as it has a unique transcriptional signature (4). Further
investigation also discovered the presence of DAM or DAM-like subsets of microglia in the
aged human brain as well as other neurodegenerative conditions (5, 6). In this context, the
DAM enrichment has been started to be regarded as a universal biomarker related to the
neurodegeneration and aging by reflecting the increase of neurodegeneration-related
molecular signals (4, 7). However, it is one of the great challenges to understand whether
DAM plays a harmful or beneficial role in neurodegenerative disorders (8, 9). It is still
unknown that which cellular components, particularly neurons, are affected by DAM or
affecting the DAM-initiated immune reaction in the brain. In order to understand the role of
DAM in CNS damages, the reconstitution of heterogeneous cellular components in the brain

should be comprehensively investigated in the diseased brain. Due to the advances in various
data acquisition technologies, recent studies discovered the transcriptomic atlas of the brain
in the cellular level and eventually identified neuronal subtypes (10-12). In this regard, it is
expected that we could comprehensively explore which specific neuronal subtypes, such as
specific excitatory neurons, would be changed as AD progress and how this would relate to
the immune reaction in the brain.
Here, we leverage the human neuronal transcriptome atlas of the brain (10) and tissue
RNA-seq data acquired from human AD to investigate neuronal subpopulation according to
the microglial landscape. The publicly available postmortem RNA-seq datasets were
designed to obtain tissue transcriptome of specific brain regions, which captured the gene
expression of all the constituent cells. To estimate microglial enrichment including DAM
from the bulk RNA-seq data, we utilized alleged gene sets of immune cellular subsets.
Furthermore, to dissect neuronal components, a digital deconvolution method and genetic
profiles of neuronal subtypes were employed (10, 13). We aimed to investigate how the
neuronal subpopulation changes with neurodegeneration and how it relates to the DAM. The
comprehensive knowledge in the cellular landscape of AD brain can be a key to understand
neurodegeneration and impact on the discovery of new therapeutic targets.

RESULTS
Disease-associated microglia associated with neuronal loss
We firstly estimated the enrichment score of disease-associated microglia (DAM) from
mRNA transcriptome data of human brain tissue. Briefly, a gene set associated with human
aged microglia was selected (5) and then the enrichment score for each sample was calculated.
We also estimated the cell enrichment scores including neurons, overall macrophage, M1-like
and M2-like cells using predefined gene sets (14). The data were obtained from a cohort of
AD and control brains from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) which included four brain
regions, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), prefrontal cortex (PFC), superior temporal gyrus
(STG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and Mayo Clinic Brain Bank RNA-seq study obtained
from the temporal cortex. Note that the following analyses were mainly performed in PHG
where the neuronal loss was found at the early stage (2, 15), and results for other brain
regions were also compared. As a result, the DAM enrichment score was closely related to
AD brain (Fig. 1A). The DAM enrichment scores of AD was significantly higher than those
of controls in PHG (Fig. 1B) (0.26 ± 0.98 vs -0.61 ± 0.76 for AD and control, respectively; t
= 7.20, p < 1×10-13). The higher DAM enrichment was also found in other brain regions
including PFC, STG and IFG (Fig. S1). The enrichment scores of DAM and neuron were
negatively correlated to each other regardless of brain regions (r = -0.77, p < 1×10-15 for PHG,
r = -0.63, p < 1×10-15 for PFC, r= -0.71, p < 1×10-15 for STG, r = -0.70, p < 1×10-15 for IFG
and r= -0.61, p < 1×10-14 for Mayo-temporal) (Fig. 1C, Fig. S2). Amyloid plaque deposits
were positively associated with DAM enrichment score (r = 0.41, p < 1×10-9 for PHG, r =
0.26, p < 1×10-4 for PFC, r = 0.33, p < 1×10-7 for STG, and r = 0.17, p < 0.01 for IFG) (Fig.
1D, Fig. S3).

DAM and macrophage-related signatures
As DAM is a subset of overall microglia in the brain, we estimated the relationship
between brain immune cell signatures, DAM and other macrophage-related signatures. The
macrophage-related signatures were estimated by specific gene sets of cellular markers (The
cellular markers are summarized in Table S1) (14). The DAM enrichment score was
positively correlated with overall macrophage and M1-like cell population in PHG (r = 0.63
and r = 0.74 for macrophage-like and M1-like cells, respectively, Fig. 2A). It was not
correlated with M2-like cell population. The data of AD patients were selected and divided
into 4 subgroups according to the immune cell subpopulation of M1-like and M2-like cells:
M1+M2+, M1+M2-, M1-M2+, and M1-M2- types. ‘Positive’ and ‘negative’ represented the
relatively more enriched M1-like or M2-like cells than others and were determined by the
median value of each enrichment score. There was a significant effect of the subgroups on
DAM and neuronal loss (F(3, 154) = 54.2, p < 1×10-15 for DAM and F(3, 154) = 26.9, p <
1×10-13 for neurons). The DAM enrichment score was the highest in the M1+M2- subgroup
and the enrichment score of neurons was also the lowest in the M1+M2- subgroup (Posthoc
Tukey, p < 0.05 for all comparison) (Fig. 2B, C). The pattern, M1+M2- subgroup with the
highest neuronal loss and DAM, was consistently found in the independent data cohort
(Mayo temporal cortex) as well as other brain regions (PFL, STG and IFG) (Fig. S4). We
plotted M1-like and M2-like subpopulation according to DAM enrichment scores and fitted
by local polynomial regression (Loess fitting) (Fig. 2E). According to the progression of
DAM enrichment, both M1-like and M2-like signatures were initially increased, while further
increased DAM was associated with decreased M2-like cells and increased M1-like cells in
all brain regions (Fig. S5). M2-like cells were decreased according to DAM for Mayo
temporal cortex data (Fig. S5).

Reconfiguration of neuronal subpopulation associated with DAM
As overall neuronal loss was closely associated with DAM, we investigated whether
DAM affected a composition of neuronal subtypes. Using gene profiles of excitatory and
inhibitory neurons of the human brain cortex (10), we calculated the relative population of
neuronal subtypes for each sample (Fig. 3). The gene profile for each neuronal subtype is
summarized in Table S2. The subpopulation was represented by a heatmap (Fig. 3A) and
barplots for PHG and other brain regions (Fig. 3B, Fig. S6). Neuronal subtypes which
occupied 0% in most samples were excluded from the further analysis. We calculated the
correlation between DAM enrichment and each neuronal subtypes. In PHG, DAM was
negatively correlated with Ex2 neurons and positively correlated with Ex3 neurons (r = -0.55,
p < 1×10-15 for Ex2 and r = 0.55, p < 1×10-15 for Ex3) (Fig. 4A). Notably, Ex2 and Ex3
neurons constitute the cortical layer 4 (10), thus, this opposite direction of correlation meant
repopulation of cortical layer 4 associated with DAM enrichment. The positive correlation of
Ex3 and negative correlation of Ex2 to DAM were commonly found in other brain regions
(Fig. S7). We also compared the neuronal subpopulation between AD and control brains. A
volcano plot represented increased and decreased neuronal subpopulation in AD compared
with control brain (Fig. 4B). The proportion of Ex3 neuron was significantly increased and
the proportion of Ex2 neuron was significantly decreased in AD (Ex2: 0.10 vs. 0.15, t = -4.3,
p < 0.0001; Ex3: 0.06 vs. 0.03, t = 5.0, p < 1×10-5 for AD and control, respectively) (Fig. 4C
and 4D). Increased Ex3 and decreased Ex2 neuronal proportion in AD were also found in
PFL, while this finding was not definite in other brain regions including STG and IFG (Fig.
S8). Of note, the proportions of Ex2 and Ex3 were associated with DAM in all brain regions
including STG and IFG.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found the reconfiguration of cellular subsets, particularly neurons, in the
human AD brain according to the DAM enrichment. The overall neuronal loss was closely
associated with the DAM regardless of the brain region. The signatures of immune cell
subsets including DAM, M1-like and M2-like cells were compared. We found the different
patterns of immune cell enrichment according to the AD progression. The neuronal
subpopulation was estimated by digitally dissecting the neuronal components. Among 8
excitatory and 8 inhibitory neuronal subtypes, the proportions of two excitatory neurons, Ex2
and Ex3, located on the cortical layer 4 were significantly associated with DAM enrichment.
Increased DAM was positively correlated with the proportion of Ex3 while it was negatively
correlated with the proportion of Ex2, which suggested the excitatory neuronal
reconfiguration in the cortical layer 4. The result of the cellular landscape suggested the close
link of microglia-mediated immune reaction and neuronal reconfiguration as well as overall
neuronal loss in the AD brain.
The DAM enrichment was closely associated with overall neuronal damage and amyloid
plaques in the human brain. This finding was consistent with the previous finding which
suggested the synaptic loss in the AD mouse model according to the microglial activation and
complement-mediated immune reaction (16). This microglia-mediated neuronal loss has been
one of the therapeutic targets as microglial depletion protected neuronal loss and cognitive
symptoms in the animal models (17, 18). Furthermore, the association between DAM and
amyloid plaques corresponds to the animal pathologic study, which showed the co-localized
DAM and amyloid plaques (4). In spite of the positive correlation between DAM and
amyloid plaques, there is still controversy in the role of DAM in AD pathology regarding
neuronal protection or neuronal damage (19). Amyloid plaques can lead to microglial

phagocytic activation for the protection or induce neuronal damage mediated by a detrimental
immune reaction. Although our cross-sectional analysis hardly explains the exact role of
DAM in amyloid deposition, the close association of DAM, amyloid plaques and neuronal
loss in the human brain implies the cascades of this AD-related immune reaction and
neuronal loss, which could eventually lead to clinical symptoms. Moreover, the neuronal
reconfiguration associated with DAM in our results could support the idea of microgliamediated neuronal damage (20, 21).
Following the close relationship between DAM and neuronal cell loss, the next key
question at the cellular level is how AD pathology reconfigures the neuronal subpopulation.
Our finding suggests the reconstitution of excitatory neurons in the specific layer, cortical
layer 4. DAM enrichment was closely related to the neuronal proportion of Ex2 and Ex3, but
the direction was opposite. According to the progression of DAM enrichment, the Ex3
neuronal proportion was increased while Ex2 neuronal proportion was decreased. Of note, the
difference in gene expression profiles of two excitatory neurons was associated with the
connectivity (10). The connection abnormality of excitatory neurons caused by the
reconfiguration of excitatory neurons in layer 4 could be related to the excitatory imbalance
in the microcircuit of AD brain (22, 23). More specifically, glutamate-mediated calcium
overload induced by amyloid plaques result in the excitatory imbalance and eventually
glutamate toxicity (24). Of note, relatively increased Ex3 proportion and decreased Ex2
proportion in AD brain were found in the PHG and PFL, but not in the STG, IFG and the
neocortex of the temporal lobe. These two brain regions, PHG and PFL, are vulnerable brain
regions according to the neurodegeneration, which leads to abnormal energy metabolism (25).
Considering the correlation of Ex2 and Ex3 proportion to DAM regardless of the brain
regions, the abnormal connectivity of excitatory neurons in the layer 4 associated with DAM

would occur in the entire brain. However, due to the difference of vulnerability in neuronal
damage, both PHG and PFL might have a clear association with the diagnosis of the AD.
Moreover, these brain regions are related to the low efficiency of energy metabolism
compared to brain connection, thus, the connections could be vulnerable to pathologic stress
such as amyloid deposits (26, 27). Our hypothesis of excitatory imbalance and abnormal
connectivity in the cortical layer 4 according to DAM should be clarified in further in vitro
and animal studies. Nonetheless, our results suggest a plausible explanation for the dynamic
neuronal reconfiguration due to the immune reaction in the brain. Furthermore, it could
support the idea of the regional variability in the neuronal damage associated with excitatory
imbalance and metabolic demands, and complicated neuronal connectivity disruption of the
AD brain (28).
The comparison of immune cell signatures in the brain suggested the changes of
microglial subtypes according to the disease progression. Two different macrophage
signatures, M1-like and M2-like cellular enrichment scores were differently associated with
DAM and neuronal loss patterns. More specifically, the M1-like cell enrichment score was
closely associated with DAM and neuronal loss, while M2-like cell enrichment score was
increased in samples with relatively low DAM enrichment but then decreased according to
DAM enrichment. Thus, when we divided the samples by the enrichment scores of M1-like
and M2-like cells, the neuronal loss and DAM were the highest in the M1+M2- subgroup.
This finding corresponds to the finding of three microglial subtypes in AD mouse model,
which showed homeostatic microglia, stage 1 and stage 2 DAM (4). The report suggested that
the composition of three microglial subtypes were dynamically changed according to the
disease progression (4). In this context, initially increased and then decreased patterns of M2like cell enrichment score in our results could reflect the dynamic transitional state of

microglia in the diseased brain (29). Further human microglial subtypes using single cell
analyses in AD brain might elucidate the dynamic state of microglia and its role in AD
progression. As a single cell-level atlas of human microglia could provide genomic profiles of
various state of microglia, another future work of digitally dissecting microglial subtypes in
tissue RNA-seq data could further clarify the cellular landscape of neurodegeneration.
We investigated the association of DAM enrichment and neuronal reconfiguration in the
human brain. Since it is difficult to analyze a number of human brain samples with the
different disease state in cellular level, we leveraged immune cell signatures and gene
expression profiles of neuronal subtypes previously dissected using single cell analyses. As a
result, we found the close relationship between DAM enrichment and overall neuronal loss.
By comparing immune cellular signatures, we suggested the changes of microglial subtypes
enrichment according to the disease progression. More importantly, we suggested that the
DAM enrichment was associated with the reconfiguration of excitatory neuronal subtypes in
the specific cortical layer, which supports the idea of abnormal connectivity mediated by an
excitatory imbalance in AD pathophysiology. The result of the close relationship of
microglia-mediated immune reaction, neuronal loss, and cellular reconfiguration could
provide an insight into how AD-related pathologic features including amyloid plaques affect
clinical symptoms related to specific neuronal damages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and samples
The Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) RNA-seq study was used for the analysis
(synapse ID: syn3157743 from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer’s Disease
Knowledge Portal) (30). Post-mortem brain samples were collected from the four different
brain regions, PHG (Brodmann Area 36), PFC (Brodmann Area 10), STG (Brodmann Area
22), and IFG (Brodmann Area 44). Tissue RNA-seq was generated using the TruSeq RNA
Sample Preparation Kit v2 and Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
For RNA-seq data processing, raw sequence reads were aligned to human genome reference
hg19 with star aligner (v2.3.0e) and reads were summarized to gene level counts using the
featureCounts (31).
Mayo Clinic Brain Bank RNA-seq study was also used for additional data (synapse
ID: syn5550404 from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer’s Disease
Knowledge Portal). RNA-seq based transcriptome data were generated from post-mortem
temporal cortex samples of AD patients, controls, patients with pathologic aging and
progressive supranuclear palsy patients. We selected RNA-seq data of AD and controls (n =
82 and 78, respectively). Detailed process pipelines are described in the previous report (32).

Disease-associated microglia enrichment
To define disease-associated microglia (DAM) in the human brain, we used a gene
set that is preferentially expressed by microglia in the aged human brain, which also
associated with pathological processes (5, 7). To obtain DAM enrichment score, we used a
single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) which provide the activity of DAM
signature for each sample (33). DAM signature was provided by the previous study (5), by

selecting 650 genes which highly expressed in human aged microglia cells with a 4-fold
increase and adjusted p < 0.05. The output of ssGSEA was normalized by z-score across
samples and used as a DAM enrichment score.

Brain immune cells and neurons enrichment
To evaluate the subpopulation of immune cells in the brain tissue, cell types enrichment
scores were evaluated. A gene-signature based method for inferring cell types from tissue
transcriptome profiles, xCell tool (http://xcell.ucsf.edu/), was used (34). xCell infers more
than 60 cell types, however, most cell types are not associated with brain tissue. Thus, we
selected macrophage-related signatures, whole macrophage, M1 and M2 signatures, and
neurons signatures. The gene expression data of brain tissue samples were used to estimate
macrophage-like, M1-like and M2-like cell enrichment scores.

Clusters based on immune cell subtype
Immune cell enrichment scores of the brain tissue of AD patients were selected. To find
different cell population features including DAM and neuronal loss, samples were clustered
based on the brain immune cell subtypes, M1-like and M2-like cells. Relatively M1-like cell
enriched groups were defined by the median value of the enrichment score. By using the two
respective threshold values of M1-like and M2-like cell enrichment scores, 4 subgroups were
defined: M1+M2+, M1+M2-, M1-M2+, and M1-M2- types. ‘Positive’ and ‘negative’ represents
the sample with higher and lower than the median value of enrichment score, respectively.

Neuronal subtype signatures
Neuronal subtype signatures were obtained by the single cell RNA-seq data of human

brain neurons (10). The data consist of 3227 sets of single neuron RNA-seq data acquired by
isolated cellular nuclei. Accordingly, 16 neuronal subtypes, 8 excitatory and 8 inhibitory
neurons, were defined by using clustering analysis. Detailed methods are described in the
previous report. Briefly, for RNA-seq data processing, short reads were aligned to human
hg38 reference genome (STAR ver 2.3.0) and quantified by HTSeq (ver 0.5.4p5).
Transcription levels were then converted to transcript per million mapped reads (TPM). Gene
expression signatures of each neuron subtype were estimated by median TPM of all marker
genes. These representative gene expression data of 16 neuronal subtypes were used as
reference gene expression data for digitally dissecting cellular subtypes from bulk RNA-seq
data.

Digital dissection of neuronal subtypes from tissue samples
To dissect the neuronal subtypes from bulk RNA-seq data acquired from postmortem
human brain, CIBERSORT was used (13). CIBERSORT deconvolute gene expression data of
tissues into estimated subpopulation of 16 neuronal subtypes using aforementioned single
cell-level transcriptomic data. The tissue RNA-seq data were resampled to have same gene
identifiers with the reference gene signatures of 16 neuronal subtypes and these rearranged
data were supplied to CIBERSORT as inputs. A subpopulation of 16 neuronal subtypes was
identified by default parameters of the algorithm.

Statistical analysis
The correlation between two continuous variables was estimated by Pearson’s correlation.
The comparison of DAM enrichment scores between two diagnostic groups (AD and
controls) was conducted by the two-sample t-test. 16 neuronal subtypes population of AD

and controls were also compared using the two-sample t-test. To compare the statistical
results of 16 neuronal subtypes, volcano plots were drawn by plotting fold changes and pvalues calculated by the two-sample t-tests between AD and controls. The comparison of
DAM and neuron enrichment scores between four immune cell-based clusters was
conducted by one-way ANOVA, followed by the post hoc Tukey’s test.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Disease associated microglia (DAM) enrichment score associated with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in human brain. (A) DAM enrichment score was
calculated by a specific gene set of aged microglia and tissue RNA-sequencing data acquired
from parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). We also estimated immune cellular signatures including
macrophage, M1- and M2-like cells as well as the neuron signature and then plotted
according to the order of DAM enrichment. (B) The DAM enrichment scores of AD brain
was significantly higher than those of controls in PHG (0.26 ± 0.98 vs -0.61 ± 0.76 for AD
and control, respectively; t = 7.20, p < 1×10-13). (C) The correlation between the neuron and
DAM signatures, which showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.77, p < 1×10-15). (D)
The degree of amyloid plaques was positively associated with DAM enrichment score (r =
0.41, p < 1×10-9).

Figure 2. The relationship between immune cell signatures estimated by tissue RNAsequencing. (A) The DAM enrichment score was compared with other immune cell
signatures estimated by predefined gene signatures of macrophage, M1 and M2 cells. The
DAM enrichment was positively associated with macrophage and M1 enrichment, while not
associated with M2-like cell. (B, C) Using the median value of M1- and M2-like cells
enrichment, samples were divided into 4 subgroups: M1+M2+, M1+M2-, M1-M2+, and M1M2-. The M1+M2- subgroup showed the highest DAM enrichment score (B) and the lowest
neuron signature, which implied the highest neuronal loss (C). M1-like and M2-like scores
were plotted with DAM enrichment score and fitted by local polynomial regression (D).
According to DAM enrichment, both scores were initially increased and then the M2-like cell
score was decreased while the M1-like cell score was still increased.

Figure 3. Reconfiguration of neuronal subpopulation associated with DAM
enrichment. Using genetic profiles of 8 excitatory and 8 inhibitory neurons, proportional
changes of the subpopulation in the brain (PHG) in accordance with DAM enrichment were
estimated. A heatmap (A) and a barplot (B) showed relatively increased Ex3 neuronal
proportion and decreased Ex2 neuronal proportion according to DAM enrichment score.

Figure 4. Proportional changes of two excitatory neurons associated with DAM. (A)
Two excitatory neurons in the cortical layer 4, Ex2 and Ex3, were correlated with DAM
enrichment score. DAM was negatively correlated with Ex2 neurons and positively correlated
with Ex3 neurons in the PHG (r = -0.55 and r = 0.55, respectively; p < 1×10-15). (B) The
proportions of neuronal subtypes of AD and normal controls were compared and plotted with
a volcano plot. (C, D) The proportion of Ex2 neuron was decreased and that of Ex3 neuron
was increased in AD brain. The proportion of Ex3 neuron was significantly increased and the
proportion of Ex2 neuron was significantly decreased in AD (Proportion of Ex2: 0.10 vs. 0.15,
t = -4.3, p < 1×10-4; Proportion of Ex3: 0.06 vs. 0.03, t = 5.0, p < 1×10-5 for AD and control,
respectively).
