ABSTRACT

30

31

The response to drugs of abuse is a combination of aversive and reinforcing reactions.

32

While much is known about the role of dopamine in mammalian drug reinforcement, we

33

know little about the brain circuits mediating drug aversion. Here we show that two

34

distinct dopaminergic circuits mediate reinforcing and acute aversive responses to

35

alcohol consumption in Drosophila. Protocerebral anterior medial dopamine neurons

36

projecting to the mushroom bodies are required for flies to acquire alcohol preference.

37

Conversely, a bilateral pair of dopamine neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped

38

body (dFSB) mediates acute alcohol avoidance. Alcohol consumption can be reduced

39

by decreasing the activity of the appetitive reinforcement-circuit to the mushroom bodies,

40

or by increasing activity in the dopamine neurons projecting to the dFSB. Thus, distinct

41

dopaminergic pathways can be targeted to reduce the intake of harmful drugs.

INTRODUCTION

44

Alcohol exposure causes both pleasurable and negative responses in humans.

45

People displaying increased sensitivity to alcohol’s rewarding effects or resistance to

46

the acute aversive responses are at increased risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD)1. The

47

development of AUD involves circuits mediating the reinforcing effects of alcohol,

48

including dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus

49

accumbens2. However, much less is known about the neurons mediating the acute

50

aversive responses to this drug.

51

Similar to mammals, Drosophila show naïve aversion to alcohol when given a

52

choice between liquid food with or without alcohol3.

53

transforms into experience-dependent preference after an alcohol pre-exposure3.

54

Dopaminergic neurons are involved in the recall of ethanol-conditioned odor preference4.

55

However, it is not known how dopamine is involved in voluntary ethanol consumption in

56

Drosophila—including naïve aversion and the transformation from aversion to

57

experience-dependent alcohol preference.

58

circuits mediate the acute aversive and reinforcing effects upon ethanol exposure. We

59

also show that normal ethanol responses require the Drosophila dopamine D1R1

60

receptor in the respective target neurons of these two dopamine circuits, and that

61

manipulations of either circuit can lead to reduction in voluntary alcohol consumption.

This initial alcohol aversion

Here we show that distinct dopamine

66

To determine the involvement of dopamine in alcohol-consumption behavior, we

67

fed flies the dopamine precursor L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), or 3-IY (3-

68

iodo-tyrosine), an inhibitor of the rate-limiting dopamine synthesis enzyme tyrosine

69

hydroxylase (TH, Fig. 1a). Flies with increased dopamine levels (Supplementary Figure

70

1a) showed enhanced naïve aversion, while dopamine depletion (Supplementary Figure

71

1a) led to naïve preference in an abbreviated 16-hour “2-bottle choice” CAFÉ assay (for

72

capillary feeder, Fig. 1B5). As expected (see Fig. 1a), feeding of the TH product L-

73

DOPA was able to restore the naïve alcohol preference caused by TH inhibition back to

74

aversion (Supplementary Figure 1b). After a 20-min alcohol pre-exposure a day prior to

75

testing, control flies developed experience-dependent preference for alcohol, whereas

76

flies with increased dopamine levels did not (Fig. 1b). These results suggested that

77

dopamine is crucial for alcohol aversion rather than acquired preference in flies. To

78

confirm that levels of dopamine signaling correlated with alcohol aversion, we

79

genetically altered DAN activity using a TH-Gal4 driver, which is expressed in most

80

DAN (Fig. 1c,6-9). Enhancing TH-Gal4 DAN activity (using the heat-activated TrpA cation

81

channel) during pre-exposure and during the CAFÉ assay preference test (Fig. 1d)

82

caused alcohol aversion regardless of pre-exposure (Fig. 1e). Conversely, using a

83

heat-activated dominant negative dynamin (shits) to silence these TH-Gal4 DAN led to

84

alcohol preference, regardless of pre-exposure (Fig. 1e). Therefore, changing the

85

activity of the majority of DAN using TH-Gal4 had the same effect as pharmacologically

86

altering dopamine levels (Fig. 1b).

87

The PAM cluster (protocerebral anterior medial) of DAN expresses TH, but lacks

88

TH-Gal4 expression8,9. These PAM-DAN are required for appetitive olfactory

89

conditioning. We therefore wanted to know whether these PAM-DAN contributed to

90

alcohol aversion, as indicated by our above pharmacological results, or whether they

91

were involved in alcohol preference as suggested by their requirement for appetitive

92

olfactory learning. When we activated the PAM-DAN subpopulation, using the heat-

93

sensitive cation channel TrpA, flies showed enhanced experience-dependent alcohol-

94

preference (Fig. 1f). Conversely, silencing these PAM-DAN using a dominant-negative

95

dunamin, shits, abolished alcohol preference (Fig. 1f). These data suggested that TH-

96

Gal4 DAN mediate alcohol aversion, while PAM dopaminergic activity is required for

97

experience-dependent

98

dopaminergic activity by knocking down the TH enzyme specifically in PAM-DAN (using

99

TH-RNAi), which also abolished alcohol preference upon pre-exposure (Fig. 2b). This

100

result also suggested that it is dopamine in these PAM neurons that is involved in

101

experience-dependent alcohol preference rather than other putative co-transmitters.

alcohol

preference. We confirmed the requirement for

102

103

PAM dopamine neurons are required for the acquisition of experience-dependent

104

alcohol preference

105

Because our behavioral paradigm consists of an alcohol pre-exposure followed

106

by a test of flies’ consumption preference a day later, we were able to ask whether

107

PAM-DAN are required during the acquisition or the expression of alcohol preference.

108

Limiting the heat-induced activation and silencing of the PAM-DAN to the alcohol pre-

109

exposure or to the CAFÉ test revealed that these neurons had no effect during the

110

testing (Fig. 2e). However, PAM-DAN activity was required during pre-exposure to

111

acquire alcohol preference (Fig. 2d), and activating those neurons showed a trend

112

towards facilitated acquisition of preference (Fig. 2e, P = 0.056). PAM-DAN project to

113

the mushroom bodies (MB) a known center for associative learning in flies (Fig. 2a8,9).

114

We therefore asked whether MB neurons are involved in experience-dependent alcohol

115

preference, and, if so, when? Inhibiting activity of the α/ß and γ lobes of the MB during

116

the pre-exposure abolished preference acquisition (Fig. 2f), while we found no effect of

117

the MB α/ß and γ lobe neurons during the CAFÉ preference test (Fig. 2g). MB-

118

projecting PAM-DAN activity is therefore required for the acquisition of alcohol

119

preference, similar to the nucleus accumbens-projecting mammalian ventral tegmental

120

area DAN2.

121

122

A PPL1-to-fan-shaped body circuit mediates naïve alcohol aversion

123

We next investigated the role of the TH-Gal4 DAN population (Fig. 3a) in naïve

124

alcohol aversion. Knocking down TH expression in these neurons resulted in naïve

125

alcohol preference (Fig. 3b), suggesting that dopamine is the relevant neurotransmitter

126

mediating naïve alcohol aversion. Activation or silencing of the TH-Gal4 DAN during

127

ethanol pre-exposure had no effect on alcohol preference (Fig. 3c), but activating them

128

during the CAFÉ preference test enhanced naïve aversion and abolished experience-

129

dependent preference (Fig. 3d). Together with the data from Fig. 1b, e, these results

130

suggested that alcohol acutely induces aversion via TH-Gal4 DAN during the CAFÉ

131

preference choice. This could be mediated by alcohol odor and/or taste sensation, but

132

in addition, TH-Gal4 DAN might also be directly activated by alcohol’s acute direct effect

133

on these DAN.

134

We tested this latter hypothesis by performing ex vivo dopamine voltammetry

135

experiments, while using the red light-activated CsChrimson cation channel10. Light-

136

induced activation of TH-Gal4 DAN caused robust release of dopamine from larval brain

137

explants (Fig. 3e). Exposure to increasing amounts of alcohol revealed that even a low

138

alcohol concentration of 5 mM potentiated the release of dopamine (Fig. 3e,f). This level

139

is less than one third of the legal blood alcohol limit for driving. Acute direct exposure of

140

TH-Gal4 DAN to alcohol may therefore contribute to their activation, and underlie or

141

potentiate acute sensory-induced aversion to alcohol at the behavioral level. Similarly,

142

PAM-DAN might also be activated at these doses and thereby cause an appetitive

143

reinforcing signal to the MB, ‘teaching the flies’ to like alcohol and override its aversive

144

effects. This model would also explain how a sub-threshold ethanol pre-exposure could

145

induce preference when paired with TrpA-mediated activation of PAM-DAN (Fig.2d,

146

30/120 EtOH/air flow; below threshold to turn aversion into preference in control flies).

147

One of the TH-Gal4 DAN clusters activated by aversive stimuli is PPL1

148

(protocerebral posterior lateral 1)6, and these DAN might therefore also be involved in

149

alcohol aversion. We thus followed up on other Gal4 drivers expressing in PPL1 to ask

150

which of the TH-Gal4 DAN are important in naïve, acute alcohol aversion. Using a

151

number of Gal4 lines expressed in smaller subsets of TH-Gal4 and PPL1 DAN

152

(Supplementary Fig. 2)11,12, we found that silencing of both TH-D’-Gal4 and 439B-Gal4

153

DAN caused naïve alcohol preference (Fig. 3g). 439B-Gal4 is expressed in 3 DAN per

154

hemisphere (from the PPL1 DAN cluster, Fig. 3h), two projecting to the MB (Fig. 3i, red

155

example), and one projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFSB; Fig. 3i, green). The

156

two MB-projecting 439B-DAN are also expressed in line 504B-Gal412, which had no

157

effect on acute alcohol aversion (Fig. 3g). This suggests that the dFSB-projecting 439B-

158

DAN is involved in acute alcohol aversion. We further tested the involvement of dFSB in

159

alcohol aversion by activating the PPL1-dFSB target neurons13 and found that this also

160

caused naïve alcohol preference (Fig. 3g). Interestingly, this PPL1-dFSB circuit is

161

involved in arousal from sleep11,13. Note that flies with silenced PPL1-DAN, or activated

162

dFSB neurons consumed the same total amount of food as did controls (Supplementary

163

Fig. 3), arguing that these manipulations did not cause pervasive ‘sleepiness’ or

164

inactivity (Supplementary Fig. 4).

165

166

A Dopamine D1-like receptor is required in dopamine target neurons for alcohol

167

aversion and preference

168

Together, the above data suggested that the PPL1-dFSB circuit mediates acute

169

alcohol aversion, while the PAM-MB circuit participates in the acquisition of experience-

170

dependent alcohol preference. To further strengthen our evidence for a critical role of

171

dopamine in both these circuits, we investigated the involvement of two major dopamine

172

receptors, D1 and D2. Pan-neuronal knock down (Fig. 4a) of the D1-like Dop1R1 (D1R)

173

receptor led to naïve alcohol preference (Fig. 4d), while knock down of the D2-like

174

receptor (D2R) did not affect naïve aversion or experience-dependent preference (Fig.

175

4e). Furthermore, knock down of D1R in the dFSB was sufficient to cause naïve alcohol

176

preference (Fig. 4g). MB-specific knock down revealed that D1R is required in MBs for

177

experience-dependent preference (Fig. 4f).

178

To ascertain that our results were not caused by RNAi off-target effects, we also

179

tested the D1RUAS mutation. These flies lack functional D1R expression, but the

180

presence of a Gal4-binding UAS site in the D1R gene allows expression to be restored

181

by a Gal4 driver

182

flies showed naïve alcohol preference (Fig. 4h). When we conditionally restored adult

183

D1R expression in neurons using an inducible pan-neuronal Gal4-driver (elavGS+), flies

184

showed normal naïve alcohol aversion, which turned into experience-dependent

185

preference upon pre-exposure (Fig. 4h). These data provide evidence for an acute

186

requirement of dopamine signaling during adult behavior (as suggested by Figs. 2, 3)

187

and argue against developmental defects causing the behavioral deficits15. When we

188

restored MB-specific D1R expression in D1RUAS flies, we observed no change from the

189

D1RUAS mutants, i.e., naïve preference with intact experience-dependent preference

190

(Fig. 4i). Conversely, dFSB-specific D1R expression rescued D1RUAS naïve preference

191

back to normal naïve avoidance, but these dFSB-rescued D1RUAS mutants did not

192

acquire experience-dependent preference (Fig. 4i), presumably due to the lack of D1R

193

in the MB. Indeed, when we restored D1R expression in both the MB and dFSB,

194

D1RUAS flies displayed normal naïve alcohol aversion, followed by experience

195

dependent preference upon alcohol pre-exposure (Fig. 4i). These data confirm that

196

dopaminergic signaling from the PAM to the MB is required for acquired alcohol

197

preference, and PPL1 dopaminergic signaling to the dFSB is required for naïve alcohol

198

avoidance (Fig. 4j).

203

acquisition of experience-dependent alcohol preference.

Consummatory preference

204

also requires the dopamine D1R1 receptor in the Drosophila MB. This PAM to MB

205

circuit has previously been found to be important in the acquisition of appetitive sucrose

206

learning8,9, while D1R1 is well known to be involved in Drosophila learning and

207

memory16. Furthermore, the MB are involved in ethanol-reinforced odor preference4, as

208

well as preferential alcohol consumption17. Our findings that acute alcohol exposure

209

potentiates dopaminergic release suggest a mechanism of how an acute vapor

210

exposure of ethanol might cause reinforcement: as alcohol rises in the brain,

211

dopaminergic neurons, including reinforcing PAM neurons, get activated and impart an

212

association of cues with behavioral reinforcement. These cues might involve the smell

213

of alcohol itself, but this remains to be determined. Still, our data suggest that the

214

Drosophila PAM neurons act analogously to the ‘classical’ mammalian dopamine

215

neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, thought

216

to be important in mediating the reinforcing actions of drug of abuse.

217

Our data also suggests that a single bilateral pair of PPL1 dopamine neurons

218

mediates acute aversive effects of ethanol, and silencing these neurons causes

219

abolished alcohol aversion.

220

activated by a number of aversive stimuli6, consistent with their involvement in alcohol

221

aversion. Thus in our acute choice paradigm, the smell18, or taste19,20 of ethanol might

222

activate these neurons and contribute to acute avoidance of alcohol consumption. In

223

addition, acute drinking and alcohol’s pharmacodynamic potentiation of these neurons

224

might also contribute to acute avoidance.

Dopaminergic neurons in the PPL1 cluster are acutely

225

involved in arousal (from sleep)11,13, and our findings suggest that this circuit might be

226

more broadly involved in the processing and salience of aversive cues.

227

Taken together, our data show that Drosophila dopamine neurons are required

228

for both reinforcing and acute aversive reactions to alcohol. This is similar to recent

229

findings in the mammalian brain, where dopaminergic neurons are involved in opposing

230

reactions to drugs of abuse21,22. We show that alterations in either of these dopamine

231

circuits can lead to a reduction in ethanol intake, emphasizing that acute sensitivity to

232

the aversive aspects of a drug are protective against the development of addiction. This

233

is in line with human genetic findings, where the strongest genetic factors that protect

234

people from developing alcohol abuse disorders are alcohol dehydrogenase variants,

235

which are involved in triggering acutely unpleasant reactions23. Furthermore, people

236

perceiving alcohol as acutely more bitter tasting, are also less likely to develop

237

alcoholism24,25. Drosophila thus show complex reactions to ethanol that are similar to

238

humans. In addition, distinct Drosophila dopaminergic circuits mediate these diverse

239

reactions. Thus, while the structural architecture of the fly brain is clearly different from

240

that of mammals, key sub-circuits are conserved in their logic and in their multifaceted

241

use of the same neurotransmitter—dopamine—which can mediate opposing behavioral

242

outcomes, depending on the specific dopaminergic circuit engaged.

293

solutions were made with Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Dissections, recordings,

294

and calibrations were performed in a simple buffer solution (131.3 mM NaCl, 3.0 mM

295

KCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4 monohydrate, 1.2 mM MgCl2 hexahydrate, 2.0 mM Na2SO4

296

anhydrous, 1.2 CaCl2 dihydrate, 11.1 mM glucose, 5.3 mM trehalose, pH = 7.4). Carbon

297

fiber microelectrodes were fabricated from T-650 carbon fibers (a gift of Cytec

298

Engineering Materials, West Patterson, NJ) and were used for fast-scan cyclic

299

voltammetry as previously described32. Virgin females with UAS-CsChrimson (a

300

chimera of CsChR and Chrimson) inserted in attp1833 (a gift of Vivek Jayaraman) were

301

crossed with TH-GAL4 (a gift of Jay Hirsh). Resulting heterozygous larvae were

302

shielded from light and raised on standard cornmeal food mixed 250:1 with 100 mM all-

303

trans-retinal. A small amount of moistened Red Star yeast (Red Star, Milwaukie, WI)

304

was placed on top of the food to promote egg laying.

305

For the protocerebrum recordings, brains were isolated into dissection buffer

306

from larvae using forceps under a dissection microscope, and the electrode was

307

implanted from the lateral edge of the tissue into the dorsal medial protocerebrum. The

308

electrode equilibrated in the tissue for 10 minutes prior to data collection and a baseline

309

recording was taken for 10 seconds prior to stimulation. Red light estimated at 0.75 mW

310

from a 617 nm fiber-coupled high-power LED with a 200 μm core optical cable

311

(ThorLabs, Newton, NJ) was used to stimulate the CsChrimson ion channel. The

312

TarHeel CV software (a gift of Mark Wightman) was used to control the light stimulation

313

and to record the current from the applied voltage. After taking a baseline 2 second

314

stimulation, 5 mM ethanol (10% in buffer) was added to the solution of fly buffer and

315

then another stimulation was recorded after 5 minutes. The concentration of ethanol

316

was increased to 15 mM and then to 45 mM. Stimulations were performed at each

317

concentration five minutes after the ethanol was added to allow for equilibration. Adding

318

increasing amounts of dissection buffer instead of ethanol was performed as a vehicle

319

control. Data are presented at mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) and graph

320

HPLC measurement of brain dopamine levels

323

Flies were immobilized on ice (5/sample). Brains were dissected and

324

homogenized in ice-cold 0.02 M HClO4 and 0.00025 M ascorbate solution using a

325

Kontes micro tissue grinder. Homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at

326

4ºC. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 sec at 4°C

327

using a 0.22 µm Ultrafree PVDF filter (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA). Samples (approx.

328

25 µL final volume) were stored at -80ºC until analysis. The HPLC-ECD system

329

consisted of a Luna 3 µm C18 (2) 100 Å, 50 x 1 mm, LC column (Phenomenex,

330

Torrance, CA) and SenCell2 electrochemical cell at +450 mV (Antec Leyden,

331

Netherlands) with Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Aqueous mobile phase with ion-pairing

332

agents (0.50 g OSA, 0.05 g DSA, 0.13 g EDTA, 11.08 g NaH2PO4, 100-150 mL MeOH

333

in 1L H2O; pH adjusted to 5.6) was delivered to the column using a LC110S piston

334

pump (Antec Leyden, Netherlands). Column and electrochemical cell were kept at 35ºC

335

inside a controller (Intro model, GBC Separations, Hubbardson, MA) with a Rheodyne

336

8125 manual injector. Analog responses from the electrochemical detector were

337

digitized using an analog-to-digital converter (SS240x model, Scientific Software,

338

Pleasanton, CA). EZ Chrome Elite software was used to collect chromatograms

(Scientific Software, Pleasanton, CA). Sample dopamine content was estimated via the

340

calibration curve method using external dopamine standards prepared in 0.1 M H3PO4.

341

Reported estimates are derived from chromatograms with signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 3 that

342

met in-house quality criteria.

Statistics

345

Statistical significance of results in this manuscript was established using

346

analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tests with GraphPad Prism software for Mac. For the

347

post-hoc analyses, Dunnett’s test was applied to control for the multiple comparison

348

when several groups were compared to the same control. Error bars in all experiments

349

represent SEM. Significance was only attributed to experimental lines that were

350

statistically different from their respective controls. Significance in all graphs shown are

351

defined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

formation of experience-dependent alcohol preference (*P < 0.05).

traces from a larval brain and (f) total dopamine released upon stimulation of TH-Gal4 neurons

492

(with red light, via UAS-CsChrimson) shows that even low levels (5 mM) of acute ethanol potentiate

493

dopamine release. Dopamine was measured from the median protocerebrum, close to the fan-

494

shaped body. (g) A subset of TH-Gal4 dopamine neurons affects naïve alcohol avoidance when

495

silenced during naïve preference testing (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05), including TH-D’-Gal4, which

496

expressed in the PPL1 cluster, and 439B-Gal4, which expresses in three PPL1 dopamine neurons

497

(h). (i) Higher magnification picture of two (pseudocolored) 439B-Gal4 neurons. Two dopamine

498

neurons PPL1-γ2α’1 (red) and PPL1-α’2α2 (cell body not visible in this picture) project to the

499

mushroom bodies, and are also contained in the 504B-Gal4 driver , which does not affect naïve

500

alcohol avoidance (see g). The green dopamine neuron (PPL1–dFSB) projects to the dorsal FSB,

501

but not the MB. Activating layer 6 dFSB neurons (R23E10-Gal4 driver) leads to naïve alcohol

502

preference (see g).

Figure 4. The dopamine D1R1 receptor is required in the mushroom bodies for experience-

505

507

6 (dFSB, b), and mushroom bodies (MB, c). (d) Pan-neuronal, RNAi-mediated knockdown of

508

dopamine D1R1 receptor (D1R), but not D2 receptor (D2R, e) abolishes naïve alcohol avoidance

509

(**P < 0.01). (f,g) D1R knockdown in the dFSB also abolishes naïve alcohol avoidance (**P < 0.01,

510

magenta in f), whereas, D1R knockdown in the MB abolishes experience-dependent preference

511

(**P < 0.05, blue in g). (h,i) D1RUAS flies are mutants that lack D1R expression, but this can be

512

restored by the introduction of a Gal4-driver . Together with an RU486-inducible pan-neuronal Gal4

513

driver (elavGS, for RU486-Gene-Switch), these D1RUAS mutants show naïve alcohol preference

514

when Gal4 is not induced (elavGS–, white in h). This is rescued when adult flies are fed RU486

515

before the ethanol-pre-exposure and D1R expression is restored (elavGS+, green in h). When D1R

516

expression is restored in the MB, D1RUAS flies still show naïve alcohol preference (MB247-

517

Gal4>D1RUAS, blue in i). Conversely, restoring D1R expression in the FSB only rescues naïve

518

alcohol avoidance, but now reveals a loss of experience-dependent preference (R23E10-

519

Gal4>D1RUAS, magenta in i), presumably due to lack of D1R in the MB. Indeed, when D1R

520

expression is restored in both the MB and the FSB, D1RUAS mutants show normal naïve alcohol

521

avoidance succeeded by preference upon an alcohol pre-exposure (MB247-Gal4;R23E10-

522

Gal4>D1RUAS, black and white in i). (j) Schematic highlighting the two dopamine circuits involved in

523

naïve alcohol avoidance (PPL1–dFSB) and the acquisition of experience-dependent alcohol

524

preference (PAM–MB).
