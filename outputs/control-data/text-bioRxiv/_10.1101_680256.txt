An explicit formula for a dispersal kernel in a patchy landscape
Ali Beykzadeh James Watmough
June 22, 2019
Abstract
Integrodifference equations (IDEs) are often used for discrete-time continuous-space models
in mathematical biology. The model includes two stages: the reproduction stage, and the
dispersal stage. The output of the model is the population density of a species for the next
generation across the landscape, given the current population density. Most previous models
for dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape approximate the landscape by a set of homogeneous
patches, and allow for different demographic and dispersal rates within each patch. Some work
has been done designing and analyzing models which also include a patch preference at the
boundaries, which is commonly referred to as the degree of bias. Individuals dispersing across
a patchy landscape can detect the changes in habitat at a neighborhood of a patch boundary,
and as a result, they might change the direction of their movement if they are approaching a
bad patch.
In our work, we derive a generalization of the classic Laplace kernel, which includes different
dispersal rates in each patch as well as different degrees of bias at the patch boundaries. The
simple Laplace kernel and the truncated Laplace kernel most often used in classical work appear
as special cases of this general kernel. The form of this general kernel is the sum of two different
terms: the classic truncated Laplace kernel within each patch, and a correction accounting for
the bias at patch boundaries.

Introduction

Integrodifference equations are often used to model the distribution of annual species with distinct
growth and dispersal stages across a landscape. The general form of an integrodifference equation
(IDE) modelling growth and dispersal is as follows:
Z
Nt+1 (x) =
k(x, y)F (Nt (y), y)dy.
(1)
Ω

Here Nt (x) is the population density at a point x ∈ Ω at the end of the dispersal period in year t,
the growth function, F , is the density of dispersers, or new recruits following the growth phase of
year t, and the dispersal kernel, k(x, y), is the probability a disperser originating at a point y ∈ Ω
disperses to x [Kot and RSchaffer, 1986]. Note that we do not assume all dispersers survive the
dispersal phase. Hence, Ω k(x, y) dy ≤ 1. The integral operator in (1) allows us to accommodate
a wide variety of empirically determined dispersal patterns.
IDEs with a discontinuous population density have been recently analyzed in patchy landscapes
equipped with discontinuous kernels [see e.g., Neupane and Powell, 2015]. Many of these studies
restrict the analysis to the case with no bias at patch boundaries [see e.g., Garlick et al., 2011].
However, the degree of bias has direct effect on, for example, the speed of spread [Lutscher and
Musgrave, 2017], and should be included in dispersal models. There is an explicit formula for
a discontinuous dispersal kernel in case of periodic infinite patches with considering the habitat

preference [Musgrave and Lutscher, 2014]. Yurk and Cobbold [2018] presented a homogenization
approach to the multi-scale problem of how individual behavioural responses to sharp transitions in
landscape features, such as forest edges, affect population-dynamical outcomes. In their work, they
treated the special case of a periodic environment consisting of two types of alternating patches,
but the theory carries over to other periodic settings. We have obtained a general m-patch kernel
including multiple patches with movement bias at the boundaries. The m-patch kernel extends
several previous models for dispersal.
Many heterogeneous landscapes can be reasonably approximated by a mosaic of homogeneous
patches, where individuals can respond to the boundaries by changing dispersal characteristics
and by possibly immediately reversing direction to stay within the same patch. Musgrave [2013]
showed that a certain formulation of a random walk with bias at the boundaries on such landscapes
leads to discontinuities in the dispersal kernel at the patch boundaries. Dispersal bias, while not
necessary for persistence, can significantly increase chances of persistence [Lutscher et al., 2010].
More generally, there are many behaviours, especially in two or three dimensions involving responses
to boundaries and movement along boundaries.
Here our aim is to derive a general dispersal kernel for the most straightforward one-dimensional
case. We first focus on a heterogeneous landscape that can be approximated by homogeneous
patches, then we partition the heterogeneous landscape into pieces with homogeneous dynamics
on each piece. Within each patch, dispersal follows a simple random walk with a constant step
size, mortality and settling rates [as per Ovaskainen and Cornell, 2003]. We obtain an explicit
formula for the kernel as piecewise exponential function with coefficients and rates determined by
the inverse of a matrix of model parameters.

General dispersal kernel

2.1

Kernel Derivation

Let {a0 , . . . , am } denote the positions of the m+1 interface points of Ω = R, and let Ωi = (ai−1 , ai ),
i ∈ {1, . . . , m} denote the bounded patches, which are accompanied by two semi infinite patches,
Ω0 = (−∞, a0 ) and Ωm+1 = (am , ∞). For each patch Ωi , the settling rate, the death rate, and
the motility are denoted by αi , βi , and νi , respectively. The degree of bias, −1 < zi < 1, at each
interface determines two probabilities, (1 − zi )/2 and (1 + zi )/2, of moving to the left and to the
right at boundary i, respectively. Ovaskainen and Cornell [2003] showed that the dispersal kernel
is the Green’s function, k(x, y), satisfying the partial differential equation
∂2
k(x, y) − µ2i k(x, y) = −δ(x − y), (x, y) ∈ Ωi × Ωj ,

Condition (3) ensures the kernel is continuous at x = y; Condition (4) arises from a matching
condition [see Keener, 2000]; Condition (5) is a jump condition; and finally, Condition (6) is the flux

balance condition and represents continuity of the flux across the interface, so that no individuals
are added or removed at the interface [Musgrave, 2013]. To ensure the kernel is bounded, we also
add the conditions
k(±∞, y) = 0.

(7)

We expect the kernel to be piecewise continuous with possible discontinuities along the lines x = ai ,
i ∈ {0, . . . , m} and y = aj , j ∈ {0, . . . , m}. Let kij denote the portion of the kernel representing
dispersal from patch Ωj to patch Ωi . That is, k(x, y) = kij (x, y), for (x, y) ∈ Ωi × Ωj , (i, j) ∈
{0, . . . , m + 1}2 .
Using Ei to denote the functions



2µi νi Aij Ei (x) + Bij /Ei (x)

(9)

It follows immediately from Condition (7) that
Aij = 0

i = m + 1,

j ∈ {0, . . . , m},

(10)

Aij = Cj

i = m + 1,

j = m + 1,

(11)

Bij = 0

i = 0,

j ∈ {0, . . . , m + 1}.

(12)

From continuity at x = y we have
Cj Ej (y) + Dj /Ej (y) = 0,

j ∈ {0, . . . , m + 1},

and from the matching condition on kx at x = y we have
Cj Ej (y) − Dj /Ej (y) = 2,

j ∈ {0, . . . , m + 1}.

These can be solved for Cj and Dj to obtain
−1
Cj = Ej (y)

(13)

Dj = −Ej (y)

(14)

Upon substituting the expression for Cm+1 into Equation (11), we find that
−1
Aii = Ei (y) ,

i = m + 1.

From Conditions (5) and (6), for (i, j) ∈ {0, . . . , m}×{0, . . . , m+1}, we have the interface conditions
µi+1 (1 + zi ) ((Aij − δij Cj )Ei (ai ) + (Bij − δij Dj )/Ei (ai )) = µi (1 − zi ) (Ai+1,j + Bi+1,j ) ,
((Aij − δij Cj )Ei (ai ) − (Bij − δij Dj )/Ei (ai )) = (Ai+1,j − Bi+1,j ) ,
where δij denotes the Dirac-delta.

Equations (17) and (18) along with Equations (10)-(12) are a linear system of 2(m + 2)(m + 2)
equations for the coefficients Aij and Bij with (i, j) ∈ {0, . . . , m + 1}2 . Solving this system for the
coefficients gives us a piecewise-defined form of the kernel as expressed by Equation (9)

2.2

Matrix Form of the Kernel

The system derived in the previous section is linear, implying that the kernel can be expressed in
a compact matrix form. This result can be exploited to greatly reduce the computations required
to numerically compute the kernel and emphasizes the similarity of the general kernel with the
simpler Laplace kernels and truncated Laplace kernels appearing in the literature.

The reciprocal of i can be interpreted as a measure of patch-width. Specifically, if we define the
homogeneous Laplace kernel by
(28)
kL (x, µ) = 21 µe−µ|x| ,
R
R
∞
∞
then for i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, −1
i = ai kL (x, µi ) dx/ ai−1 kL (x, µi ) dx, which is the probability a given
individual settles beyond ai given that they settle beyond ai−1 and can be viewed as the fraction
of dispersers reaching ai−1 that continue across ai . Similarly, ηi can be viewed as a measure of the
retention at the interface: ηi is the ratio of the rescaled kernel across the interface. Note, however,
that retention also depends on the entries of P , or more accurately on the jumps in motility, ν, and
settling, α, across the interface, and the value of zi .
Since the entries of T −1 W depend in general on dispersal parameters in every patch through the
two parameter groups, η and , the component of the kernel, kij representing settlement in patch i
by dispersers originating in patch j, also depends in general on all dispersal parameters. However,
it is important to note that the matrix form of the kernel implies that the functional form of each
piece kij is a linear combination of the four functions
e+µi x e+µj y , e+µi x e−µj y , e−µi x e+µj y , and e−µi x e−µj y .

Special cases
Single interface

To illustrate the method, we first consider the simplest case where m = 0. That is, there is only
a single interface point, with possibly different dispersal parameters on each side of the interface.

The kij entry of the kernel involves only the (i + 1)st row and (j + 1)st column of the product of
the right hand side. For example, k00 involves the first row and first column of the product, which
involves the first row of E(x) and E −1 (x) and the first column of E(y) and E −1 (y). Since E(x)
is a diagonal matrix, this implies only the first and third rows and columns of T −1 W are used in
computing k00 . Similarly, k01 uses only the first and third rows and the second and fourth columns
of T −1 W .

The pattern of zeros in T −1 W after subtracting the identity from the upper right block arises from
the condition that the kernel remain bounded. For a fixed x, when y → ∞ in Equation (33), the
dispersal kernel goes to zero. We have the same limit for k, when y → −∞ in Equation (34).
For m = 0, we can, without loss of generality, assume a0 = 0. If we further assume that the habitat
quality is identical in both patches (µ = µ0 = µ1 , etc.), we have η0 = (1 − z0 )/(1 + z0 ), and after
dropping the unnecessary subscripts on the parameters the components of the kernel simplify to

(39)

The first term, kL (|x − y|, µ) in k00 and k11 is the probability density for a disperser following a
Homogeneous Laplace kernel dispersing a distance |x − y|, and the remaining term in each piece,
kL (|x + y|, µ), is the probability density for the same disperser travelling a net distance |x + y|. This
second distance is the net distance travelled by a disperser settling at the reflection of x across the
interface. With no bias, z = 0, each piece of the kernel reduces to the homogeneous Laplace kernel.
With z > 0, a fraction z of dispersers are reflected back across the interface, thus the terms of k11
are the following probabilities, with x and y positive: kL (|x − y|, µ) is the probability density for a
disperser travelling from y to x; kL (|x + y|, µ) is the probability density for a disperser travelling
from y to (−x) in absence of bias; with bias, a fraction z of these dispersers are reflected to (x);
finally, a fraction β/(α + β) of all dispersers die before settling, leaving only a fraction α/(α + β)
that survive the dispersal process.

3.2

A single isolated patch

For the special case m = 1 the habitat consists of a single patch of finite length surrounded by
two semi-infinite patches. This typically arises as either a single isolated patch of good habitat
surrounded by poor habitat, or a large (i.e, infinite) good habitat fragmented by an unsuitable, or
poor quality habitat represented by a finite interval. With m = 1, the dispersal kernel has 9 pieces,
and T −1 W is a 6 × 6 matrix. As with the previous case, the middle two rows and columns of T −1 W
after subtracting the identity from the upper right block are zeros, leaving 16 nonzero entries.

and |φ2 | < 1, suggesting that they are fractions of dispersers reflected back into region Ω0 by each
interface.
There are several interesting special cases appearing in the liturature where growth is zero outside
the central patche and the IDE model only invovles k11 . In these cases we have the following
formulae for k11 .
If the bias at the two interfaces is equal and opposite, z0 = −z1 = z, and the two

outside patches are identical, µ2 = µ0 , α2 = α0 , and β2 = β0 , then η0 =

Discussion

In this study, we assumed that the real line, as a one-dimensional landscape, is partitioned into
different pieces such that there are non-equal probabilities for individuals at boundaries to move to
the right or left side of the boundary. During the dispersal phase, animals may respond to habitat
quality and habitat edges and these responses may affect their distribution between habitats [Allema
et al., 2014]. Ecologists who have incorporated detailed and realistic behaviour into the movement
process have accomplished better fits to movement data [Schick et al., 2008]. This discussion will
benefit from detailed studies on movement behaviour in combination with a study on the population
outcome of this behaviour. We questioned if there is a straightforward method to formulate the
dispersal kernel, that came from the random walk theory, governing the probability of successful
dispersal.
The m-patch Laplace kernel is a piecewise exponential function of two variables, x and y. Each
piece, kij , is a linear combination of four exponential functions (29) with coefficients representing
the measure of retention at the boundaries. Moreover, kij can be expressed in terms of the distance
between the settling point and the reflections of the starting point, (36). We have investigated a
method to formulate the kernel with only one matrix of coefficients, T , independent of the location
y but dependent on the dispersal parameters in every patch through the two parameter groups η
and . With this achievement, the process of studying the effect of changing patch parameters on
the model is simplified. For example, when the degree of bias at the origin increases in (36), we see
k10 increases and k01 decreases. As another example, for m = 1, setting η0 = η1 = 1 can be viewed
as balancing the bias with the ratio of the kernel decay rates across the patch interfaces.
This matrix form of the kernel will be useful for numerical simulations of IDEs, where it is necessary
to integrate the product of the kernel and a reproduction function.
Since

y, and several terms of the kernel, such as P E(x) E −1 (x) T −1 W −
, are independent
0 0
of y. Only one part of the kernel is involvedin the computation. That is, we need only integrate
E(y)
and the growth function over each Ωj . Therefore,
the product of the j-th column of
E −1 (y)
partitioning the whole real line into m patches does not complicate the simulation of an IDE.
