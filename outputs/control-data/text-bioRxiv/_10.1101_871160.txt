Abstract
A family history (FH) of dementia, APOE-e4 genotype, and obesity are major risk factors for
developing Alzheimer’s disease but their combined effects on the brain and cognition remain
elusive. We tested the hypothesis that these risk factors affect apparent white matter (WM)
myelin and cognition including spatial navigation and processing speed in 166 asymptomatic
individuals (38-71 years). Microstructure in temporal [fornix, parahippocampal cingulum,
uncinate fasciculus], motor and whole-brain WM was assessed with myelin-sensitive indices
from quantitative magnetization transfer [macromolecular proton fraction (MPF)] and axon
density from diffusion imaging. Individuals with the highest genetic risk (FH+ and APOE-e4)
compared to those with FH+ alone showed obesity-related reductions in MPF and axon
density in the right parahippocampal cingulum. No effects were present for those without FH.
Furthermore, FH modulated obesity-related effects on spatial navigation behaviour. In
summary, an individual’s genetic dementia risk influenced the impact of obesity on WM
myelin and cognition.

1. Introduction
As the world’s population is aging, increasing numbers of people over 65 will develop
cognitive impairment due to late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD)1. The pathological
processes leading to LOAD accumulate over many years2 but it remains challenging to
reliably identify those individuals at heightened risk before they develop memory
impairments. It is therefore important to gain a better understanding of the impact of
dementia risk factors on the brain and cognition in cognitive healthy individuals. Identifying
reliable biomarkers is pivotal for the development of preventative interventions in the future.
Accumulating evidence suggests that neuroglia damage may be critically involved in
the pathogenesis of LOAD3-9. Neuroglia are non-neuronal support cells that maintain brain’s
homeostasis and are essential for normal synaptic and neuronal activity. In the brain these
are myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, microglia immune cells, astrocytes and ependymal
cells. According to the myelin hypothesis of LOAD4, oligodendrocytes are particularly
vulnerable to the impact of aging and insults from genetic and lifestyle risk factors, leading to
an accelerated breakdown of axon myelin sheaths with advancing age3, 10, 11. Besides
providing insulation for axons, myelin regulates saltatory conduction and synaptic plasticity
and is therefore critical for the speed of information transfer and the maintenance of healthy
brain circuit functions12-15. When myelin gets damaged, the brain triggers complex repair
mechanisms that may involve Apolipoprotein E (APOE) mediated transport of cholesterol4,16
as well as beta-secretase enzyme BACE1 mediated neuregulin cleavage to signal
oligodendrocytes to myelinate17-19. As BACE1 is the key enzyme that initiates the formation
of amyloid-β20, it has been proposed that amyloid-β plaques may develop as a by-product of
myelin repair processes4. The myelin model therefore predicts that myelin damage precedes
the development of LOAD pathology. Consequently, one may expect accelerated myelin
damage in middle-aged and older cognitively healthy individuals at heightened risk of LOAD
10, 21, 22

. The objective of the present study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the

impact of three well-established LOAD risk factors, APOE-e4 genotype, family history of

dementia, and central obesity, on myelin-sensitive MRI metrics in brain white matter. Family
history was assessed by asking participants whether a first-grade relative was affected by
LOAD, vascular dementia, or any other type of dementia.
The protein APOE is involved in cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis in the
brain23. APOE has three alleles e2, e3 and e4 and carriage of APOE-e4 is the largest known
genetic risk factor of LOAD with e4 homozygotes having a 14-fold increase in their lifetime
risk of developing LOAD compared with APOE-e2 and e3 carriers 24, 25. APOE is the main
cholesterol transporter in the brain16 and the APOE-e4 isoform is thought to have fewer
molecules to deliver cholesterol required for myelin and synaptic repair 16, 26. It is wellestablished that APOE-e4 is associated with an earlier onset of LOAD24, 27 and a larger
burden of amyloid-β plaques28-32. This is particularly the case in those individuals with a FH
of LOAD33, 34. In cognitively healthy individuals, APOE-e4 has been linked to vulnerabilities in
spatial navigation35, executive function36, 37 and processing speed38 and both APOE-e4 and
FH to impairments in episodic memory36, 39-42. Furthermore, both APOE-e4 and FH are
associated with changes in brain areas known to be affected in LOAD, such as posterior
cingulate, parietal, prefrontal and temporal cortices including hippocampal and
parahippocampal regions 43-48. For instance, APOE-e4 carriers with a FH of LOAD had larger
axial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a pathway that connects temporal and
prefrontal cortex regions49. Similarly, baseline differences in white matter microstructure in
the fornix, the parahippocampal cingulum (PHC) and the UF were found to be predictive of
episodic memory decline over three years in a cohort of asymptomatic older adults enriched
with APOE-e4 and FH of LOAD50.
Midlife obesity is another established risk factor for developing LOAD (estimated risk
ratio of ~1.4) 51 52, 53, particularly in APOE-e4 carriers54. Obesity is associated with white
matter microstructural differences especially in pathways of the limbic system and those
connecting temporal and frontal lobes including the fornix and the cingulum bundle55 as well
as with impairments in episodic memory56, executive functions, and processing speed57. A

recent study 58 reported stronger correlations between obesity state and performance in
executive function and memory tests in APOE-e4 carriers than non-carriers suggesting that
APOE may modulate the effects of obesity on cognition. Thus, preliminary evidence points
to complex interplays between APOE-e4, FH, and obesity but there is a lack of studies into
their interactive effects on the brain and cognition, and the underlying mechanisms remain
unknown.

We therefore investigated the interaction effects between APOE, family history of
dementia, and Waist-Hip-Ratio, a measure of central obesity, in 166 asymptomatic
individuals (38 - 71 years) from the Cardiff Ageing and Risk of Dementia Study (CARDS)59, 60
with a focus on white matter microstructure and cognition (Table 1). Based on the myelin
model, we hypothesized that risk-related effects would be particularly apparent in myelinsensitive MRI metrics in temporal lobe pathways known to be susceptible to LOAD, i.e. the
fornix, PHC and UF 61-64, compared with motor cortico-spinal tracts (CST) and whole brain
white matter (WBWM) control regions (Figure 1).
Going beyond previously adopted indices from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)65, 66,67,
we employed more myelin-sensitive indices from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT)
imaging68-72 and T1-relaxometry73, 74 (longitudinal relaxation rate R1). The qMT indices were
the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF), known to be highly sensitive to myelin in white
matter72, 75-78, and the forward exchange rate kf, an index thought to reflect metabolic
efficiency that was found to be reduced in LOAD79 (Figure 1). In addition, we assessed axon
microstructure with dual-shell diffusion-weighted Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion
Imaging (NODDI)80. NODDI estimates i) free water contributions to the diffusion signal with
the isotropic signal fraction (ISOSF), ii) restricted diffusion contributions with the intracellular
signal fraction (ICSF), an estimate of apparent axon density, and iii) axon orientation

dispersion (ODI) (Figure 1). Average indices of these microstructural measurements were
derived from all white matter pathways and the whole brain region. Based on the myelin
model we mainly predicted APOE-e4, family history, and central obesity-related reductions in
MPF and R1, that may, however, also affect the metabolic index kf and the axon
microstructural indices from NODDI. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of risk factors
on a wide range of cognitive domains including episodic memory65, 81, 82, spatial navigation83,
working memory, executive function, and processing speed84, 85. As myelin regulates the
speed of information transfer in the brain, we expected effects on processing speed such as
on response latencies in a virtual Morris Water Maze Task (vMWMT)86, that required visualspatial learning and relied on efficient communication within hippocampal networks. All
analyses were controlled for age, sex, and education as these variables are known to affect
LOAD risk and allowed the comparison between age and risk-related differences 87, 88.
Finally, we tested whether differences in blood pressure, plasma markers of inflammation
(C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin 8), and adipose tissue dysfunction (leptin/adiponection
ratio)89 accounted for any effects of risk factors on white matter microstructure and cognition
to explore potential contributing mechanisms.

2.1 Multivariate covariance analysis (MANCOVA) of white matter microstructural indices
MANCOVA tested for the effects of APOE genotype (e4+, e4-), family history (FH+,
FH-) and central obesity (WHR+, WHR-) on all microstructural indices (MPF, kf, R1, ISOSF,
ICSF, ODI) in all white matter pathways (left PHC, right PHC, left UF, right UF, left CST,
right CST and fornix) and WBWM regions whilst controlling for age, sex, and years of
education.
Omnibus effects: Main effects were observed for age [F(48,60) = 2.64, p < 0.001, hp2
= 0.68] and sex [F(48,60) = 2.61, p < 0.001, hp2 = 0.67]. Interaction effects were present
between APOE and WHR [F(48,60) = 1.6, p = 0.04, hp2 = 0.56] and between APOE, FH and
WHR [F(48,60) = 1.7, p = 0.02, hp2 = 0.58].
Post-hoc effects: Ageing was associated with reductions in MPF, kf, and R1 in
WBWM, fornix and right UF (Table 2). MPF and kf reductions were also present in the left
UF and bilateral CST respectively. In addition, age-related increases in ISOSF were
observed in WBWM and fornix and increases in ODI in the fornix (Table 2, Figure 2A).
Women relative to men showed lower kf, ISOSF and ODI in WBWM and the fornix and
larger fornix MPF (Table 2, Figure 2B).
Two-way interaction effects between APOE and WHR were present for right PHC
(Figure 3A) and bilateral CST but additional post-hoc group comparisons to assess the
directions of these effects were non-significant. Three-way interaction effects between FH,
APOE and WHR were observed for MPF in WBWM, bilateral CST, bilateral UF and right
PHC (Figure 3B). For right PHC there was also an effect on ICSF. These three-way
interaction effects were followed up by testing for APOE and WHR interactions in FH+ and
FH- individuals separately (Figure 3C). FH- individuals did not show any interaction effects

between APOE and WHR [F(7,86) = 0.6, p = 0.72]. In contrast, FH+ individuals exhibited a
significant APOE x WHR interaction [F(7,43) = 3.7, p = 0.003, hp2 = 0.38] due to the
following pattern: For APOE-e4+ carriers, centrally obese relative to WHR normal individuals
had lower MPF and ICSF in the right PHC. The opposite pattern was observed for APOE-e4individuals with obese relative to non-obese individuals showing larger MPF in the right PHC
(Table 2, Figure 3C).
We then explored with MANCOVA whether controlling for differences in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (BP), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) , Interleukin 8 (IL8) , and the
leptin/adiponection ratio (LAR) would account for the observed three-way interaction effects
for MPF in WBWM, bilateral CST, bilateral UF and right PHC as well as right PHC ICSF.
There were significant omnibus effects of systolic [F(7,116) = 4.6, p < 0.001, hp2 = 0.22] and
diastolic blood pressure [F(7,116) = 2.5, p = 0.018, hp2 = 0.13] but these did not remove the
omnibus interaction effect between FH, APOE and WHR [F(7,116) = 2.4, p = 0.027, hp2 =
0.13]. In addition, neither CRP, IL8 or LAR explained the three-way-interaction effects.
Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant effects of systolic [F(1,122) = 12.5, pBHadj
= 0.021, hp2 = 0.09] and diastolic BP [F(1,122) = 6.8, pBHadj = 0.035, hp2 = 0.05] on WBWM
MPF and of systolic BP on right PHC ICSF [F(1,122) = 6.6, pBHadj = 0.036, hp2 = 0.05].
Interaction effects between FH, APOE and WHR remained significant for right PHC MPF
[F(1,122) = 12.0, pBHadj = 0.01, hp2 = 0.09] and ICSF [F(1,122) = 7.3, pBHadj = 0.03, hp2 = 0.06]
as well as WBWM [F(1,122) = 10.0, pBHadj = 0.01, hp2 = 0.08] and right UF MPF [F(1,122) =
7.7, pBHadj = 0.03, hp2 = 0.06].

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the
cognitive data to seven factors with an Eigenvalue over two, explaining together 49% of the

variance in the cognitive data (Table 3). The first factor captured “Verbal Recall” with high
loadings on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The second factor captured
elements of “Motor planning and speed” with high loadings on first move latencies in all
conditions and of total latencies in the motor control condition of the virtual Morris Water
Maze Task (vMWMT). A third factor captured “Spatial Navigation” behaviour with high
loadings on path lengths and total latencies in the hidden platform condition of the vMWMT.
The fourth factor captured “Attention Set” with high loadings on the intradimensional
subcomponents of the an intra- and extradimensional (IDED) attention set task. The fifth
factor captured “Visuospatial Memory” with loadings on immediate and delayed recall of the
Rey Complex Figure and the Spatial Span task. The sixth factor captured “Working Memory”
capacity due to loadings on Digit Span and Spatial Search. Finally, the seventh “Paired
Associated Learning” factor had high loadings on an object object-location paired associate
learning task.

2.3 MANCOVA of cognitive measurements
MANCOVA testing for the effects of APOE genotype, FH and WHR on the seven
cognitive factors were carried out whilst controlling for age, sex and years of education.
Omnibus effects: There was a main effect of age [F(7,105) = 5.6, p < 0.001, hp2 = 0.27] and
an interaction effect between FH and WHR [F(7,105) = 2.7, p = 0.014, hp2 = 0.15].
Post-hoc effects: Age had significant effects on the “Motor Speed and Planning” factor
[F(1,111) = 16.9, pBHadj < 0.001, hp2 = 0.13] and the “Spatial Navigation” factor [F(1,111) =
7.7, pBHadj = 0.03, hp2 = 0.07] (Table 3) reflecting the fact that older age was associated with
larger response latencies and path lengths in the vMWMT (rAge-MotorSpeed = 0.35, p < 0.001;
rAge-SpatialNavigation = 0.23, p = 0.019, controlled for sex and education) (Figure 4A).
In addition, there was a significant interaction between FH and WHR for the “Spatial
Navigation” factor [F(1,111) = 7.6, pBHadj = 0.014, hp2 = 0.09]. For those with FH, obese
individuals performed worse in Spatial Navigation (larger latencies and path lengths) than

non-obese individuals whilst those without FH showed the opposite trend (Figure 4B).
Controlling for diastolic and systolic BP, CRP, IL8 and LAR did remove this interaction effect
[p = 0.2, hp2 = 0.017] with diastolic BP showing a trend for a contributing effect (p = 0.06).

2.4 Hierarchical regression analyses testing for white matter-spatial navigation relationships
To find out whether differences in white matter microstructure were predictive of
performance differences in the Spatial Navigation Component, hierarchical regression
analyses were carried out, that first accounted for the effects of age, sex, years of education
before testing for the effects of all microstructural indices in a stepwise fashion.
The first model (age, sex, years of education) explained 11% of the variance of the spatial
navigation factor [F(3,88) = 3.58, p = 0.02] with significant contributions from age (beta =
0.22, p = 0.03) and years of education (beta = 0.23, p = 0.027). Adding the second model,
significantly increased R2 to 0.25 [DR2= 0.15, F(1,87) = 17.1, p < 0.001] with right CST ICSF
(beta = -0.39, p < 0.001), years of education (beta = 0.25, p = 0.009) and age (beta = 0.24, p
= 0.014) contributing significantly to the final model [F(4,87) = 7.3, p < 0.001].

3. Discussion
While family history of dementia, APOE-e4 genotype, and obesity all increase
cognitive deficits and LOAD risk individually, only a few studies have investigated their
combined effects on the brain and cognition. Based on the myelin model4, we predicted
interaction effects of these risk factors on myelin-sensitive white matter metrics. Consistent
with this hypothesis, we observed three-way interaction effects between family history,
APOE-e4, and WHR on the MPF index, known to be highly sensitive to myelin in WM72, 75-78.
Whilst interaction effects on MPF were observed bilaterally for CST and UF as well as for
the WBWM, they were most prominent in the right PHC, a WM pathway, known to be
vulnerable in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and LOAD61-64. However, no risk effects
were found in the fornix or the left PHC, and three-way interactions were only observed for
MPF, with the exception of ICSF in the right PHC.
Post-hoc analyses revealed that interactive effects between APOE and WHR were
dependent on an individual’s family history state. For those individuals with the highest
genetic risk, based on APOE-e4 and a positive family history of dementia, obesity was
related to lower MPF and ICSF in the right PHC, whilst APOE-e2 and e3 carriers with a
positive family history showed the opposite effect, i.e. larger MPF in obese compared to nonobese individuals. Meanwhile no effects of APOE or WHR were observed for individuals
without a family history of dementia.
The PHC connects the posterior cingulate and parietal cortices with the medial
temporal lobes90. Reductions in functional imaging measures, such as glucose metabolism
and blood oxygen-level dependent signal, in these regions have been reported in young and
middle-aged APOE-e4 carriers and in LOAD28, 46 and have been related to altered memory
performance91. Recently, Chen et al.92 applied graph-based network analysis and found
reduced global efficiency and functional connectivity in white matter networks as well as
reduced functional connectivity in medial temporal lobe regions in older asymptomatic
APOE-e4 carriers 92. In this study the right parahippocampal gyrus (rPHG) was the only brain

region that showed simultaneous functional and structural dysconnectivity, and node
efficiency in rPHG mediated APOE-e4-related effects on delayed recall 92. Our study
expands these findings by providing novel evidence for risk-related microstructural
vulnerabilities of the right PHC, that connects those cortical regions with functional
abnormalities in APOE-e4 and LOAD.
Furthermore, we also found behavioral evidence for interaction effects between
family history and WHR for the spatial navigation factor. This factor captured response
latency and path length performance in trials of a virtual Water Maze task that required
navigation to a hidden platform. Obese individuals with a positive family history had larger
spatial navigation factor scores than normal-weighted individuals, reflecting longer response
latencies and path lengths, whilst those without family history showed the opposite trend
(Figure 4B). These results complement previous findings of altered navigational behavior in
young APOE-e4 carriers35 and provide novel evidence for family history-dependent effects of
obesity on spatial navigation behavior in middle-aged and older adults. However, similar to
other studies in young and middle-aged cohorts 35, 42, no overt impairments in episodic
memory, motor planning, or attention-executive functioning were associated with risk.
Behavioral alterations were specific to spatial navigation performance, known to rely on
communications between parietal cortex and the hippocampal formation93. Thus, alterations
in apparent myelin of the right PHC and spatial navigation performance may reflect the
earliest risk-related vulnerabilities in temporal-parietal brain networks prone to LOAD in our
cognitively healthy sample.
It should be noted, however, that our regression results suggested that ICSF
differences in the right CST rather than in the right PHC contributed significantly to spatial
navigation performance. This may reflect the fact that the vMWMT had a large motor
component as participants had to navigate through the virtual pool by pressing buttons on
the keyboard. Furthermore, right CST also showed interaction effects between family
history, APOE and WHR on MPF. CST contributions to spatial navigation are therefore

consistent with the view that risk-related alterations in WM microstructure affect cognitive
performance.
It is also noteworthy that, in contrast to age and sex, we did not observe any main
effects of risk on WM microstructure or cognition. This pattern of results suggests complex
interplays between an individual’s genetic make-up and obesity. Besides APOE genotype,
genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genetic risk loci for
LOAD, involved in lipid metabolism, immunity as well as tau binding and amyloid precursor
protein processing 94. As self-report of parental history of dementia is likely to represent the
presence of some of these genetic risk variants95, our effects most likely reflect interactions
between APOE, obesity and an individuals’ polygenic risk for dementia.
The precise mechanisms underpinning these interaction effects require future studies
into the role of a number of metabolic pathways related to lipids, immunity, and vascular
function, as well as glucose and insulin resistance. Here, we explored the potential
moderating effects of systolic and diastolic BP, of plasma markers of inflammation with CRP
and IL8, and of adipose tissue dysfunction with the Leptin/Adiponectin Ratio, that may reflect
insulin resistance and/or low-grade inflammation89. Differences in BP had an impact on
WBWM MPF and right PHC ICSF but controlling for these variables did not fully account for
the observed interaction in microstructure. In contrast, controlling for the variables removed
the interaction effect between FH and WHR on the spatial navigation factor. This was likely
driven by diastolic BP as the only variable that showed a trend for a contributing effect (p =
0.06). Hypertension is a known risk factor of cognitive impairment96 and hence may
contribute to the observed interactions.
As myelin synthesis and maintenance are highly sensitive to cholesterol
concentrations, and both APOE-e4 and obesity are associated with hypercholesterolemia51,
it is also plausible that differences in cholesterol metabolism pathways may have contributed
to our findings. Although cholesterol concentrations in the brain are largely independent of
peripheral cholesterol levels, there is evidence of positive associations between WM
microstructure and serum cholesterol97 and cognition98, 99. In contrast, hypercholesterolemia

in older adults or the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors is associated with lower
WM microstructure and increased risk of LOAD99-101. Positive associations between WM
microstructure and allele dosage of the cholesterol gene CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer
protein), which can influence the APOE-related risk of LOAD102, were also observed for
young individuals whilst the opposite pattern was found for older adults97. Similarly, Birdsill et
al.103 reported greater waist circumference to be associated with larger WM fractional
anisotropy and lower diffusivities in middle-aged community-dwelling individuals whilst other
studies found obesity-related reductions of WM microstructure55, 104. In summary, these
results together with the findings presented here, suggest that the direction of obesity effects
on WM microstructure may be dependent on genetic (polygenic risk, APOE), cardiovascular
and demographic (age, sex) factors that need to be taken into account in future obesity
imaging studies.
In light of this evidence one may speculate that APOE-e4 in combination with other
polygenic risk factors potentially captured, at least in part, by family history, interacts
adversely with obesity and triggers accelerated myelin damage and impaired myelin repair.
Myelin decline may particularly affect obese APOE-e4 carriers with a family history, due to a
combination of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory processes that cause myelin damage
in the presence of inefficient cholesterol transport for myelin repair. In contrast, obese
individuals without genetic risk of LOAD and other cardiovascular or demographic risk
factors, may exhibit larger WM myelination due to hypercholesterolemia that may be
accompanied by superior cognitive performance. Such complex interactions between
genetic factors and lipid pathways may potentially hold an explanation for the “obesity
paradox”, that refers to studies in the literature that have reported protective effects of
obesity105.
Our study also provides insights into differential effects of aging, sex and risk factors
on white matter microstructure and cognition. Aging was associated with widespread
reductions in MPF, kf, and R1 and with increases in ISOSF and ODI particularly in the fornix

and WBWM but also in UF and CST. The only pathways not affected by age were left and
right PHC. Similarly, women relative to men showed lower kf, ISOSF and ODI in WBWM and
the fornix as well as larger MPF in the fornix but no differences in PHC. Previously, we
reported negative correlations between central obesity measures, including estimates of
abdominal visceral fat, and qMT indices (MPF, kf), that were particularly prominent in the
fornix tract without any effects of family history or APOE60. Thus, while interaction effects
between family history, APOE and WHR were observed for MPF (and ICSF) and were most
prominent in the PHC, they were absent in the fornix. In contrast, age and sex affected all
microstructural indices most prominently in the fornix but not in the PHC. Together this
pattern of results suggests that genetic-related risk factors (APOE and family history) affect
medial temporal lobe input (PHC) but not output (fornix) structures, whilst age, sex and
obesity affect output (fornix) but not input (PHC) structures. As APOE and family history are
associated with earlier and larger amyloid and tau burden33, 106, and LOAD pathology is
known to spread from the entorhinal cortices, that are adjacent to the parahippocampal
gyrus, into the medial temporal lobes107, 108, this pattern may reflect tissue vulnerabilities that
may precede the development of LOAD pathology.
Thus, the pivotal question concerns whether the observed cross-sectional risk effects
on MPF and spatial navigation are predictive of accelerated development of LOAD
pathology and cognitive and neuronal decline. A future prospective longitudinal follow-up
study of the CARDS participants is required to answer this question. This study should also
include GWAS based information about individuals’ polygenic risk of LOAD, and a more
comprehensive investigation of inflammatory, vascular, lipid and glucose/insulin moderators
to inform about potential mechanisms.

4. Materials and Methods
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the School of Psychology Research Ethics
Committee at Cardiff University (EC.14.09.09.3843R2). All participants provided written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

4.1 Participants
Participants between the age of 35 and 75 years were recruited for the Cardiff Ageing
and Risk of Dementia Study (CARDS) 59, 60 via Cardiff University community panels and
notice boards as well as via internet and local poster advertisements. Participants had a
good command of the English language and were without a history of neurological and/or
psychiatric disease, head injury with loss of consciousness, drug or alcohol dependency,
high risk cardio-embolic source or known significant large-vessel disease. N = 166 CARDS
volunteers that fulfilled MRI screening criteria underwent scanning at the Cardiff University
Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC). Table 1 summarises information about
demographics, cognition, and genetic and lifestyle dementia risk for these 166 participants
(as described in 59, 60). Participants’ intellectual function was assessed with the National
Adult Reading Test (NART) 109, cognitive impairment was screened for with the Mini Mental
State Exam (MMSE) 110 and depression with the PHQ-9 111. All participants had an MMSE ≥
26. Eight participants scored ≥ 10 in the PHQ-9 suggesting moderate levels of depression
but no participant was severely depressed.

4.2 Assessment of genetic risk factors
Saliva samples were collected with the Genotek Oragene-DNA kit (OG-500) for DNA
extraction and APOE genotyping. APOE genotypes ε2, ε3 and ε4 were determined by
TaqMan genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7412 and KASP genotyping
of SNP rs429358. Genotyping was successful in 165 of the 166 participants who underwent
an MRI scan. Participants also self-reported their family history of dementia, i.e. whether a
first-grade relative was affected by Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia or any other type

of dementia. 30.5% (n = 18) of individuals with a positive family history were APOE-ε4
carriers compared with 43% (n = 46) amongst individuals with a negative family history.

4.2 Assessment of metabolic syndrome-related risk factors
Central obesity was assessed with WHR following the World Health Organisation’s
recommended protocol for measuring waist and hip circumference 112. Obesity was defined
as a WHR ≥ 0.9 for males and ≥ 0.85 for females. Resting systolic and diastolic blood
pressure (BP) were measured with a digital blood pressure monitor (Model UA-631; A&D
Medical, Tokyo, Japan) whilst participants were comfortably seated with their arm supported
on a pillow. The mean of three BP readings was calculated. Other metabolic risk factors,
including diabetes mellitus, high levels of blood cholesterol controlled with statin medication,
history of smoking, and weekly alcohol intake were self-reported by participants in a medical
history questionnaire 113 (Table 1). As there were relatively few diabetics, smokers, and
individuals on statins these variables were not included in the statistical analyses.

4.3 Blood plasma analysis
Venous fasting blood samples were drawn into 9ml heparin coated plasma tubes after 12
hours overnight fasting and were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,000xg within 60 minutes
from blood collection. Plasma samples were transferred into 0.5 ml polypropylene
microtubes and stored in a freezer at -80°C. Circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-Reactive
Protein (CRP) in mg/dL were assayed using a human CRP Quantikine enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). Leptin
concentrations in pg/ml were determined with the DRP300 Quantikine ELISA kit (R & D
Systems) and adiponectin in ng/ml with the human total adiponectin/Acrp30 Quantitkine
ELISA kit (R & D Systems) and leptin/adiponectin ratios for each participant were calculated.
Interleukin IL-8 levels in pg/mL were determined using a high sensitivity
CXCL8/INTERLEUKIN-8 Quantikine ELISA kit (R & D Systems).

4.2 Cognitive assessment
For a summary of all cognitive scores see Table 3. Immediate and delayed (30 minutes)
verbal and visual recall were assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)
81, 82

and the complex Rey figure65. Short term topographical memory was measured with the

Four Mountains Test 114. Spatial navigation was assessed with a virtual Morris Water Maze
Task (vMWMT)83 that required participants to find a hidden platform in a water pool. This
task was comprised of six blocks of four trials each. The first block was a practise block to
familiarise participants with the task. Blocks 2-5 were the experimental blocks with a hidden
platform the participant had to navigate to. Block 6 was a motor control condition, where
participants navigated to a visible platform. Outcome measures for the vMWMT were mean
total latencies, first move latencies, and total path lengths for each block. Working memory
capacity and executive functions were assessed with computerised tests from the
Cambridge Brain Sciences battery 84, 85. Working memory capacity was tested with digit and
spatial span, distractor suppression with an adapted version of the Stroop test (DoubleTrouble), problem solving with a version of the Tower of London task (the Tree task),
abstract reasoning with grammatical reasoning and the odd-one-out task, and the ability to
manipulate and organize spatial information with a self-ordered spatial span task. In
addition, participants performed an intra- and extradimenstional shift task, a choice-reaction
time task, and an object-location paired-associate learning (PAL). Outcome measures for
the Cambridge Brain Sciences tasks were responses latencies and mean and maximum
number of correct responses.

MRI data acquisition
The following MRI data were acquired on a 3T MAGNETOM Prisma clinical scanner
(Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). T1-weighted images were acquired with a threedimension (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (256 x
256 acquisition matrix, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.06 ms, TI = 850ms, flip angle θ = 9°, 176
slices, 1mm slice thickness, FOV = 256 mm and acquisition time of ~ 6 min).

Microstructural data were acquired with the following sequences. High Angular
Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI)115 data (2 x 2 x 2 mm voxel) were collected with a
spin-echo echo-planar dual shell HARDI sequence with diffusion encoded along 90
isotropically distributed orientations 116 (30 directions at b-value = 1200 s/mm2 and 60
directions at b-value = 2400 s/mm2) and six non-diffusion weighted scans with dynamic field
correction and the following parameters: TR = 9400ms, TE = 67ms, 80 slices, 2 mm slice
thickness, FOV = 256 x 256 x 160 mm, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2 and acquisition time
of ~15 min.
Quantitative magnetization transfer weighted imaging (qMT) data were acquired with an
optimized 3D MT-weighted gradient-recalled-echo sequence 68 to obtain magnetization
transfer-weighted data with the following parameters: TR = 32 ms, TE = 2.46 ms; Gaussian
MT pulses, duration t = 12.8 ms; FA = 5°; FOV = 24 cm, 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3 resolution. The
following off-resonance irradiation frequencies (Θ) and their corresponding saturation pulse
nominal flip angles (ΔSAT) for the 11 MT-weighted images were optimized using CramerRao lower bound optimization: Θ = [1000 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2750 Hz, 2768 Hz, 2790 Hz, 2890
Hz, 1000 Hz, 1000 Hz, 12060 Hz, 47180 Hz, 56360 Hz] and their corresponding ΔSAT
values = [332°, 333°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 628°, 332°]. The longitudinal
relaxation time, T1, of the system was estimated by acquiring three 3D gradient recalled
echo sequence (GRE) volumes with three different flip angles (θ = 3°,7°,15°) using the same
acquisition parameters as used in the MT-weighted sequence (TR = 32 ms, TE = 2.46 ms,
FOV = 24 cm, 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3 resolution). Data for computing the static magnetic field
(B0) were collected using two 3D GRE volumes with different echo-times (TE = 4.92 ms and
7.38 ms respectively; TR= 330ms; FOV= 240 mm; slice thickness 2.5 mm) 117.

4.5 HARDI and qMT data processing
A detailed description of the microstructural data processing was provided in MetzlerBaddeley et al. 59, 60. The dual-shell HARDI data were split and b = 1200 and 2400 s/mm2
data were corrected separately for distortions induced by the diffusion-weighted gradients

and motion artifacts with appropriate reorientation of the encoding vectors 118 in ExploreDTI
(Version 4.8.3) 119. EPI-induced geometrical distortions were corrected by warping the
diffusion-weighted image volumes to the T1 –weighted anatomical images 120. After
preprocessing, the NODDI model 80 was fitted to the HARDI data with the fast, linear model
fitting algorithms of the Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization
(AMICO) framework 121 to gain ISOSF, ICSF, and ODI maps.
Using Elastix 122, MT-weighted GRE volumes were co-registered to the MT-volume with
the most contrast using a rigid body (6 degrees of freedom) registration to correct for interscan motion. Data from the 11 MT-weighted GRE images and T1-maps were fitted by a twopool model using the Ramani pulsed-MT approximation 123. This approximation provided
MPF and kf maps. MPF maps were thresholded to an upper intensity limit of 0.3 and kf maps
to an upper limit of 3.0 using the FMRIB’s fslmaths imaging calculator to remove voxels with
noise-only data.
All image modality maps and region of interest masks were spatially aligned to the T1weighted anatomical volume as reference image with linear affine registration (12 degrees of
freedom) using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT).

4.6 Tractography
The RESDORE algorithm

124

was applied to identify outliers, followed by whole brain

tractography with the damped Richardson-Lucy algorithm (dRL)

125

on the 60 direction, b =

2400 s/mm2 HARDI data for each dataset in single-subject native space using in house
software 124 coded in MATLAB (the MathWorks, Natick, MA). To reconstruct fibre tracts, dRL
fibre orientation density functions (fODFs) were estimated at the centre of each image voxel.
Seed points were positioned at the vertices of a 2x2x2 mm grid superimposed over the image.
The tracking algorithm interpolated local fODF estimates at each seed point and then
propagated 0.5mm along orientations of each fODF lobe above a threshold on peak amplitude
of 0.05. Individual streamlines were subsequently propagated by interpolating the fODF at
their new location and propagating 0.5mm along the minimally subtending fODF peak. This

process was repeated until the minimally subtending peak magnitude fell below 0.05 or the
change of direction between successive 0.5mm steps exceeded an angle of 45°. Tracking was
then repeated in the opposite direction from the initial seed point. Streamlines whose lengths
were outside a range of 10mm to 500mm were discarded.
The fornix, parahippocampal cinguli (PHC), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and corticospinal
(CST) pathways were reconstructed with an in-house automated segmentation method based
on principal component analysis (PCA) of streamline shape

126

. This procedure involves the

manual reconstruction of a set of tracts that are then used to train a PCA model of candidate
streamline shape and location. Twenty datasets were randomly selected as training data.
Tracts were reconstructed by manually applying waypoint region of interest (ROI) gates
(“AND”, “OR” and “NOT” gates following Boolean logic) to isolate specific tracts from the whole
brain tractography data. ROIs were placed in HARDI data native space on colour-coded fiber
orientation maps (Pajevic & Pierpaoli, 1999) in ExploreDTI following previously published
protocols

62, 113, 127, 128

. The trained PCA shape models were then applied to all datasets:

candidate streamlines were selected from the whole volume tractography as those bridging
the gap between estimated end points of the candidate tracts. Spurious streamlines were
excluded by means of a shape comparison with the trained PCA model. All automatic tract
reconstructions underwent quality control through visual inspection and any remaining
spurious fibers that were not consistent with the tract anatomy were removed from the
reconstruction where necessary. Mean values of all qMT and NODDI indices were extracted
for all white matter pathways.

4.7 Whole brain white matter segmentation
Whole brain white matter masks were automatically segmented from T1- weighted
images with the Freesurfer image analysis suite (version 5.3), which is documented online
(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Whole brain white matter masks were thresholded to
exclude ventricular cerebrospinal fluid spaces from the mask. Mean values of all qMT and
NODDI indices were extracted for the whole brain white matter mask.

4.8 Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS version 20129. All microstructural data
were examined for outliers defined as above or below three times of the interquartile range
(75th percentile value - 25th percentile value). This led to an exclusion of 2.3% of the
microstructural and 2.4% of the cognitive data.
Separate multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were carried out to test
for the effects of APOE genotype (e4+, e4-), FH (FH+, FH-) and central obesity (WHR+,
WHR-) on i) all microstructural indices (MPF, kf, R1, ISOSF, ICSF, ODI) in all white matter
pathways (left PHC, right PHC, left UF, right UF, left CST, right CST and fornix) and WBWM
regions and ii) on all cognitive factors (see below). These analyses included age, sex, and
years of education as covariates. Significant omnibus effects were further investigated with
post-hoc comparisons across all outcome measures. These were corrected for multiple
comparisons with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5% using the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure 130 (pBHadj). Information about effects sizes is provided with the partial eta squared
index hp2.
The dimensionality of the cognitive data was reduced with exploratory factor
analyses (EFA) with unweighted least squares and orthogonal varimax rotation with a
maximum of 5000 iterations for conversion. Variables with communalities < 0.4 were
excluded from the final EFA131. After inspection of Cattell’s scree plot132, factors with an
eigenvalue exceeding 2 were extracted and factor loadings exceeding 0.5 were considered
for the interpretation of the factors. The resulting seven cognitive factors (Table 3) were then
entered as dependent variables into the above described MANCOVA models as well as into
linear hierarchical regression models, which firstly tested for the effects of age, sex, and
years of education and secondly for the effects of all WM microstructural indices in a
stepwise fashion.
