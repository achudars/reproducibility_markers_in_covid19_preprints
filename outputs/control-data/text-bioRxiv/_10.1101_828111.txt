Summary

23

The highly conserved striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK)

24

complex regulates phosphorylation of developmental proteins in eukaryotic

25

microorganisms, animals, and humans. To first identify potential targets of

26

STRIPAK, we performed extensive isobaric tags for relative and absolute

27

quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses in the

28

filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora. In total, we identified 4,193 proteins and

29

2,489 phosphoproteins, which are represented by 10,635 phosphopeptides. By

30

comparing phosphorylation data from wild-type and mutants, we identified 228

31

phosphoproteins to be regulated in all three STRIPAK mutants, thus representing

32

potential targets of STRIPAK. To provide an exemplarily functional analysis of a

33

STRIPAK-dependent phosphorylated protein, we selected CLA4, a member of the

34

conserved p21-activated kinase (PAK) family. Functional characterization of the

35

∆cla4 deletion strain showed that CLA4 controls sexual development and polarized

36

growth. To determine the functional relevance of CLA4 phosphorylation and the

37

impact of specific phosphorylation sites on development, we next generated

38

phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of CLA4. This analysis identified

39

(de)phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine (S685) residue in the catalytic

40

domain of CLA4 as being important for fungal cellular development. Collectively,

41

these analyses significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanistic

42

function of STRIPAK as a phosphatase and kinase signaling complex.

Introduction

48

The striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex is a highly

49

conserved macromolecular signaling complex that is involved in numerous cellular

50

and developmental eukaryotic processes. In humans, malfunctions of STRIPAK

51

subunits are linked with various diseases and cancer; whereas, in eukaryotic

52

microorganisms, several processes, such as cell fusion, fruiting body formation, as

53

well as symbiotic and pathogenic interactions, are controlled by STRIPAK (Kück et

54

al. 2019). Although architecture, function, and regulation of STRIPAK are well

55

characterized in diverse experimental systems (Hwang and Pallas 2014; Kück et al.

56

2016; Shi et al. 2016), our understanding of how STRIPAK regulates the

57

phosphorylation of developmental proteins is still rudimentary. Further, it also

58

currently remains elusive as to how the inactivation or inhibition of subunits of the

59

STRIPAK complex affect the phosphorylation status of STRIPAK target proteins.

60

Previously, we have used a large set of mutant and deletion strains to identify and

61

structurally and functionally characterize STRIPAK subunits in the model fungus

62

Sordaria macrospora. In extensive tandem affinity purification followed by mass

63

spectrometry (TAP-MS) and yeast-two-hybrid analyses, we identified the structural

64

(PP2AA) and catalytic (PP2Ac) subunits of PP2A, the B‴ regulatory subunit of PP2A

65

(striatin), the striatin-interacting protein PRO22, SmMOB3, which is homologous to

66

the mammalian vesicular trafficking protein Mob3, and PRO45, a homologue of the

67

mammalian sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein SLMAP (Kück et al. 2016;

68

Kück et al. 2019). Recently, a STRIPAK complex interactor 1 (SCI1) was identified

69

that exhibited structural similarity to SIKE, a coiled-coil protein that serves as a

70

negative regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy in humans (Reschka et al.

71

2018). Further, two STRIPAK-associated germinal center kinases (GCKIII) were

72

also functionally characterized (Frey et al. 2015; Radchenko et al. 2018), linking

73

STRIPAK with the fungal septation initiation network (SIN). Of interest is that SIN is

74

homologous to the animal HIPPO pathway, which is negatively regulated by

75

STRIPAK.

76

Quantitative MS-based phosphoproteomics offers the possibility to monitor

77

thousands of phosphorylation sites even from minute sample amounts. This

78

approach enables the large-scale screening and identification of potential targets of

79

phosphorylation or dephosphorylation by identification of the modified peptides with

80

high confidence (Pagel et al. 2015). Besides label-free quantification and metabolic

81

labelling (e.g. SILAC), reporter-ion-based quantification by usage of isobaric

82

chemical labels (e.g. iTRAQ, TMT) has emerged as an effective technique for large-

83

scale relative protein quantification. Due to the fact that iTRAQ allows simultaneous

84

analysis of up to eight protein samples from different experimental conditions, this

85

technique minimizes random errors during sample preparation, and therefore,

86

proved to be especially suitable for phosphoproteomic analyses (Sachon et al. 2006;

87

Wiese et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2007).

88

Here, we performed extensive iTRAQ-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic

89

analyses to identify differentially (de)phosphorylated proteins, by comparing the

90

wild-type phosphoproteome with those from three mutants lacking distinct subunits

91

of STRIPAK. Phosphorylation sites in 228 proteins were differentially regulated in

92

all three STRIPAK mutants. Among these, we identified CLA4, a member of the p21-

93

activated kinase (PAK) family. Our analyses revealed a differentially phosphorylated

94

residue, which is highly conserved in PAKs from human to eukaryotic

95

microorganisms. The functional relevance of these phosphorylation sites on fungal

96

development was tested using both phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of

97

CLA4. Our study provides an in-depth quantitative phosphoproteomics data set and

98

extends the number of phosphorylated proteins that are putative targets of

99

STRIPAK. Finally, we present the first evidence that STRIPAK regulates

100

phosphorylation of a kinase from the PAK family.

Results

103

In this work, detailed iTRAQ-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of

104

the wild-type and three different STRIPAK deletion strains led to the identification of

105

putative dephosphorylation targets of the STRIPAK complex in S. macrospora.

106

Importantly, functional characterization of the PAK kinase CLA4, a target protein of

107

STRIPAK deciphers their role in fungal cellular development.

108
109

iTRAQ-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed putative

110

dephosphorylation targets of the STRIPAK complex

111

To identify dephosphorylation targets of STRIPAK, we performed iTRAQ-based LC-

112

MS/MS proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to directly compare relative

113

changes in protein expression (Fig. 1). The iTRAQ strategy is based on the N-

114

terminal labelling of peptides with up to eight amino group-reactive reagents coupled

115

to different reporter and balancer groups (Ross et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2006). Thus,

116

we were able to conduct a simultaneous analysis of up to eight different cultural

117

samples. While these isobaric tags have the same mass, fragmentation during

118

tandem MS (MS/MS) leads to the generation of mass-specific reporter ions whose

119

abundances are used for protein quantification. Using the same sample for the

120

simultanous analysis of both the global protein expression as well as the

121

phosphoproteome further allows a better differentiation of true changes in

122

phosphorylation levels from mere fluctuations of the associated proteins (Solari et

123

al. 2016). For proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses, we used probes from

124

wild-type and three different STRIPAK deletion mutants that lacked either pro11,

125

pro22, or pp2Ac1 encoding the B‴ regulatory subunit of PP2A (PRO11), the catalytic

126

subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac1), and the striatin-interacting protein PRO22, respectively

127

(Bloemendal et al. 2012; Beier et al. 2016; Pöggeler and Kück 2006). All strains

128

were grown under the same controlled growth conditions for three days in liquid

129

surface cultures, containing bio malt maize media (BMM). As depicted in the

130

workflow of Figure 1, we used two biological replicates per strain. After protein

131

extraction and tryptic digestion, the peptides of each sample were labelled at the N-

132

terminus with the different isobaric tags. After mixing the samples, high pH reversed-

133

phase fractionation was performed for global proteome analysis, followed by

134

nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (nano-HPLC) and MS/MS. In

135

parallel, enrichment of phosphopeptides by titanium dioxide (TiO2) and fractionation

136

by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography was conducted, followed by nano-

137

HPLC and MS/MS. For both data sets, ratios of the reporter ion intensities of the

138

deletion strains were calculated relative to the wild-type. To determine differentially

139

regulated candidates, the total variation of ratios for each strain was determined and

140

only phosphopeptides or proteins displaying a fold change of more than two times

141

the standard deviation were considered as regulated.

142

As shown in Figure 2, global proteome analysis of the wild-type and the deletion

143

strains, namely, ∆pro11, ∆pro22, and ∆pp2Ac1 revealed a total of 4,193 quantified

144

proteins, identified with a minimum of two unique peptides per protein at 1% false

145

discovery rate (FDR) on the peptide-spectrum match (PSM) level (Dataset S1).

146

Phosphopeptide enrichment and fractionation led to the identification of 13,506

147

peptides, 11,161 of which harboured a single or multiple phosphorylations,

148

indicating a relative enrichment efficiency of almost 85% on the PSM level. For

149

10,635 of those peptides, the phosphorylation site could be localized with high

150

confidence (phosphoRS probability ≥ 90 %), cumulating in a total of 2,489

151

phosphoproteins (Dataset S2). Moreover, 39% of the phosphoproteins exhibited

152

one phosphorylation site, while 61% contained multiple phosphorylation sites (Fig.

153

S1A). Further, 79%, 20%, and 1% of the 10,635 peptides were phosphorylated on

154

serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, respectively (Fig. S1B). The proteomic and

155

phosphoproteomic analyses showed an overlap of 1,727 proteins. Among them, 781

156

phosphoproteins were differentially phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at one or

157

more phosphorylation sites. In addition, these proteins were stable in the global

158

proteome, i.e. they showed similar abundances in the deletion strains and wild-type

159

(Fig. 2).

160

The GO annotation analysis of these phosphoproteins showed that numerous

161

proteins play a role in metabolic processes and are located in organelles and the

162

nucleus (Fig. S2). Thus, this study highlights that numerous proteins play a role in

163

metabolic processes and are located in organelles and the nucleus (Fig. S2). Among

164

the 781 phosphoproteins, 228 exhibited phosphorylation sites that were regulated

165

in all three deletion strains (Fig. 3). The analysis of these putative STRIPAK targets

166

revealed several proteins of known signal transduction pathways that exhibited up6

167

or down-regulated phosphorylation sites (Dataset S3). The large number of

168

identified phosphorylation sites permitted us to perform enrichment analyses for

169

phosphorylation motifs of differentially regulated phosphorylation sites. Comparing

170

the total proteome from S. macrospora, we found in up-regulated phosphosites six

171

distinct motifs to be significantly enriched in all three knockout strains. The motifs

172

[RXPpS] and [RXXpSP] showed the strongest enrichment (11.3- and 10.4-fold

173

compared to the background; adjusted p-values 2.8E-06 and 1.5E-09, respectively)

174

with the latter showing close resemblance to the reported substrate motif of kinases

175

CDK5, ERK1/2, and GSK3 (Jaffe et al. 2004). The only enriched acidic motif

176

[pSDXE] (5.2-fold enrichment, adj. p-value 1E-03) was reported to be a substrate of

177

caseine kinase II (Schwartz and Gygi 2005). Interestingly, the fungi-specific

178

phosphorylation motif [SXXpT] (Bai et al. 2017) was found to be neither significantly

179

enriched among the up-regulated phosphorylation sites nor in the complete data

180

set. A detailed overview of all enriched motifs can be found in the supplementary

181

material (Data set S4).

182
183

The PAK kinase CLA4 is a potential target of STRIPAK that controls sexual

184

development and polarized growth

185

In Table 1, we present 29 selected proteins belonging to the functional classes of

186

sexual signalling, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors. Among these

187

are pheromone-processing peptidases KEX1 and KEX2, and the developmental

188

protein HAM9, a target of transcription factor PRO1, which is involved in fruiting

189

body formation and cell fusion (Mayrhofer and Pöggeler 2005; Fu et al. 2011).

190

Further, we identified several transcription factors some of which were described to

191

regulate fungal sexual development. Included in the list of predicted STRIPAK

192

targets are phosphatases and kinases, which were described in several cases to be

193

involved in fungal development. This is also true for CLA4, a member of the p21-

194

activated kinases, which is conserved from humans to eukaryotic microorganisms.

195

This class of kinases was also characterized for several filamentous fungi and is

196

involved in a large variety of cellular processes (Boyce and Andrianopoulos 2011).

197

However, an association with STRIPAK has not been described for any model

organism, and functional analysis of phosphorylation sites in filamentous fungi is

199

currently missing. Therefore, we provided a detailed functional analysis of CLA4, a

200

potential target of STRIPAK.

201

The S. macrospora SMAC_08843 gene comprises an open reading frame (ORF) of

202

2817 bp and is located at scaffold 236 of the S. macrospora genome v03 (Blank-

203

Landeshammer et al 2019). The predicted protein has a length of 834 amino acids

204

and shows high amino acid sequence identity to homologous CLA4 proteins in

205

Neurospora crassa (EAA28056.1, 96.65% identity), Fusarium graminaerum

206

(SCB65154.1, 69.92% identity), and Magnaporthe grisea (AAL15449.2, 69.36%

207

identity) (Fig. S3). The protein exhibits 53.81% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae

208

Cla4p (CAA96216.1) and 58.82% identity to human PAK1 (AAC50590.1). The

209

conserved domain search using the Conserved Domain Search service (CD

210

Search) at NCBI revealed a pleckstrin homology domain (PH), a p21-binding

211

domain (PBD), and a kinase domain. These domains were present in the S.

212

cerevisiae homologue Cla4p (Fig. 4A). The alignment of the amino acid sequences

213

from S. macrospora and other filamentous fungi indicated that among the three

214

identified phosphorylation sites in S. macrospora, only S685 is located in a highly

215

conserved region within the kinase domain (Fig. 4B). Importantly, this

216

phosphorylation site has not been functionally characterized in any organism to

217

date, while the related amino acid is located within a substrate-binding site, and

218

thus, seems to be of relevance (Fig. 4B, Fig. S3).

219

For functional characterization of CLA4 in S. macrospora, a deletion strain was

220

constructed as described in experimental procedures. The homokaryotic ∆cla4

221

strain served for further investigations. As shown in Figure 5A and B, ∆cla4 forms

222

ascogonia, protoperithecia, and perithecia within 7 days. However, the perithecia of

223

∆cla4 have a shortened neck and are therefore smaller than wild-type perithecia,

224

even after 14 days of growth (Fig. 5B). Moreover, less than 10% mature asci

225

compared to wt are generated. ∆cla4 shows swelling and hyper-branching in

226

vegetative hyphae as well as a very dense growth (Fig. 5C, Fig. S5). Vegetative

227

growth tests showed that ∆cla4 displays a strongly reduced growth rate of 3 mm/d

228

in comparison to the wild-type with 28.11 ± 0.79 mm/d on Sordaria Westergaards

229

medium (SWG) (Fig. 6). Previously, we have reported that all STRIPAK mutants

230

have defects in hyphal fusion (Kück et al. 2016). However, in ∆cla4, we observed

231

no fusion defect (Fig. S5B). Complementation analysis was performed by

232

transforming plasmid pNA-8843 into the ∆cla4 deletion strain. This plasmid carries

233

the cla4 gene under the control of the native promotor as well as the nourseothricin

234

(nat) resistance cassette. After selection of primary transformants on media

235

containing hygromycin B and nourseothricin, ascospore isolates of fertile

236

transformants were generated and phenotypically characterized. The ectopic

237

integration of the cla4 gene under expressional control of its native promotor

238

completely restored the wild-type phenotype in ∆cla4.

239
240

Phospho-mimetic and -deficient mutants of the PAK kinase CLA4 show

241

242

In S. macrospora, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of the STRIPAK

243

deletion strains ∆pro11, ∆pro22, and ∆pp2Ac1, in comparison to the wild-type

244

identified three phosphorylation sites of the PAK1 homologue CLA4. Two

245

phosphorylation sites, S78 and S414, were found in weakly conserved regions,

246

while S685 is located in the catalytic domain (Fig. 4). As depicted in Table 1, only

247

the phosphorylation site S685 was identified as differentially regulated. The MS data

248

showed more than two-fold upregulation in ∆pp2Ac1 and ∆pro22 and three-fold

249

upregulation in ∆pro11. At the same time, the overall level of CLA4 remained stable

250

in all strains, further strengthening the hypothesis of the STRIPAK complex directly

251

acting on those phosphorylation sites. To unravel the role of phosphorylation site

252

S685 in fungal development, related phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of

253

CLA4 were generated (Fig. 7). For this purpose, single base pairs of the triplet

254

encoding S685 were mutated, resulting in substitution to either alanine (blocks

255

phosphorylation) or aspartic acid (mimics phosphorylation because of a negative

256

charge) in the derived protein. Mutation of the phosphorylation site S78 to A78 or

257

D78 served as control since it is located in a weakly conserved region.

258

The four plasmids pNA-8843-S78A, pNA-8843-S78D, pNA-8843-S685A, and pNA-

259

8843-S685D, encoding the phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of CLA4 were

260

transformed into the ∆cla4 deletion strain. After selection of primary transformants

261

by hygromycin B and nourseothricin resistance, ascospore isolates of fertile

262

transformants (cla4-S78A, cla4-S78D, cla4-S685A, and cla4-S685D) were

263

generated and phenotypically analyzed. Representative isolates of all mutants are

264

shown in Figs. 5 and 6.

265

Sexual development and hyphal growth were investigated in all selected strains and

266

compared to wild type, ∆cla4, as well as ∆cla4::cla4. As depicted in Figure 5D,E, the

267

analysis of different developmental stages revealed that ∆cla4::cla4, cla4-S78A, and

268

cla4-S78D form wild-type-like ascogonia, protoperithecia, as well as pear-shaped

269

perithecia. Further, vegetative growth of all these strain is identical to the wild-type

270

(Fig. 6). In contrast, cla4-S685A shows swelling of hyphae, hyperbranching, and a

271

reduced growth rate, albeit sexual development seems to be wild type-like (Fig. 5

272

and 6). Strikingly, a completely different phenotype was observed for cla4-S685D.

273

In detail, this strain generates deformed perithecia and the number of discharged

274

ascospores is highly reduced. Moreover, the phenotype is similar to that of ∆cla4.

275

Of note is that this phenotype is also evident when we investigated the morphology

276

of vegetative hyphae (Fig. 5F, Fig. S5).

Discussion

279

The conserved STRIPAK complexes from fungi, animal, or humans have the

280

capacity to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate target proteins. The complex interacts

281

with

282

dephosphorylation targets (Hwang and Pallas 2014; Kück et al. 2016). Although

283

some substrates of STRIPAK have been identified, the picture is still far from

284

complete. Thus, to identify targets of STRIPAK likely involved in fungal

285

development, we compared the proteome and phosphoproteome of wild-type and

286

three STRIPAK mutants. Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify

287

potential targets of STRIPAK.

Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in fungi

iTRAQ-based phosphoproteomic analysis has already been performed in diverse

filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus (Cagas et al. 2011; Adav et al.

292

2015), Beauveria bassiana (Wang et al. 2016), Fusarium graminearum (Taylor et

293

al. 2008), and Neurospora crassa (Jonkers et al. 2014; Xiong et al. 2014). In this

294

work, we present an in-depth quantitative phosphoproteomic data set of S.

295

macrospora in conjunction with corresponding global proteome analysis, allowing

296

for differentiation between changes in total protein expression and true alterations

297

of specific phosphorylation levels. With the identification and quantification of 8,908

298

phosphorylation sites across all conditions, our data set exhibits substantially higher

299

coverage than comparable work with other filamentous fungi to date (Jonkers et al.

300

2014; Xiong et al. 2014; Franck et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2019). Here, we provide the

phosphoproteome analyses in a eukaryotic organism. Further, from the sum of all

quantitative data, we substantially extend the number of potential STRIPAK targets.

309

One of the putative potential STRIPAK targets is the PAK kinase CLA4, which was

310

identified with three different phosphorylation sites. The phenotypical analysis of a

311

∆cla4 deletion strain revealed that CLA4 is involved in sexual development. This

312

finding is similar to previous reports that have investigated the function of CLA4

313

homologues in other filamentous fungi. For example, in Bipolaris maydis, the CLA4

314

homologue regulates the formation of fruiting bodies as well as ascospore

315

development (Kitade et al. 2019). Similarly, CLA4 homologues in F. graminaerum,

316

N. crassa, and M. grisea affect ascospore development and release, but not fruiting

317

body morphology (Li et al. 2004; Park et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011).

318

Further, ∆cla4 exhibits dense growth and altered branching in vegetative hyphae,

319

suggesting that CLA4 is involved in regulating cell polarity in S. macrospora. This

320

observation is consistent to reports by others, thus indicating that CLA4 function is

321

conserved in filamentous ascomycetes (Rolke and Tudzynski 2008; Lichius et al.

322

2014; Tian et al. 2015; Kitade et al. 2019). The branching pattern of hyphae might

323

be due to the non-regular distribution of the Spitzenkörper, as was suggested for a

324

B. maydis ∆cla4 deletion strain (Kitade et al. 2019). In S. cerevisiae, the PAK1

325

homologue Cla4p has also been extensively investigated. Several studies indicate

326

that Cla4p regulates important biological processes, including cell polarity, cell cycle

327

progression, cytokinesis, and gene transcription (Cvrcková et al. 1995; Benton et al.

328

1997; Lin et al. 2009). In addition, overexpression of Cla4p was shown to affect the

329

pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest. Thus, Cla4p has the potential to control the

330

PR pathway (Heinrich et al. 2007). Taken together, these studies support the view

331

that CLA4 homologues play a significant role in fungal development.

332

The human CLA4 homologue PAK1 is the best studied member of the PAK family

333

and is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cytoskeleton remodelling,

334

cell cycle control, the DNA damage response, cell motility, cell apoptosis, and

335

neurodevelopment. Several studies in human showed that PAK1 is crucial for

336

cardiac excitation, and muscle contraction dynamics by regulation of ion channel

337

activity (Kumar et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). Further, PAK1 is upregulated and

338

activated in several human tumor types, including breast, colon, and brain tumors

339

(Kumar et al. 2006). PAK1, a member of group A PAK kinases, is regulated by an

340

auto-inhibition mechanism. In an inactivated state, the autoinhibitory domain (AID)

341

overlaps with the PBD domain and binds the catalytic domain of another PAK1

342

protein, resulting in the formation of a homodimer. The binding of the small GTPases

343

CDC42 or RAC to the PBD domain leads to a conformational change in the AID,

344

followed by dissociation from the catalytic domain of the other PAK1 molecule. Both

345

PAK proteins become auto-phosphorylated, and therefore, activated at several

346

sites, including the activation loop within the kinase domain (Zhao and Manser 2012;

347

Kumar et al. 2017). In human as well as yeast, various phosphorylation sites of

348

PAK1 and Cla4p have been detected and experimentally verified. Further, the

349

generation of phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of PAK1 regarding numerous

350

phosphorylation sites, including S144, S223, and T423, revealed their importance

351

for kinase activity (Chong et al. 2001; Ng et al. 2010; Shin et al. 2013). Since PAK1

352

is associated with several disease phenotypes (Kumar et al. 2017; Wang et al.

353

2018), PAK1 emerged as a therapeutic target and several PAK1 inhibitors were

354

developed (Kumar et al. 2017).

355

Our phosphoproteomic analysis of the STRIPAK deletion strains and the wild-type

356

revealed three different phosphorylation sites. S78 and S414 are located in weakly

357

conserved regions of the protein, while S685 locates in the highly conserved

358

catalytic domain. Only phosphorylation site S685, which has neither been

359

characterized in human nor yeast, was regulated in the STRIPAK deletion strains.

360

The phospho-deficient mutation of this site leads to reduced growth as well as

361

slightly enhanced swelling and hyper-branching in vegetative hyphae, but does not

362

affect the formation of fruiting bodies and ascospore development. These results

363

indicate that phosphorylation is important for the functional mechanism of CLA4 in

364

vegetative hyphal growth. In contrast, the phospho-mimetic mutant S685D resulted

365

in severe defects of sexual development and vegetative hyphal growth comparable

366

to the ∆cla4 deletion strain, thereby suggesting that dephosphorylation of S685

367

might be even more critical for proper CLA4 function. Thus, phosphorylation of S685

368

from CLA4, a member of the conserved p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, seems

369

to be STRIPAK dependent. Previous studies in human already described this amino

370

acid as a potential substrate-binding site of PAK1 (Ng et al. 2010), thus emphasizing

371

the significance of the phosphorylation site S685.

372
373

CLA4 plays an important role in connecting the STRIPAK complex

374

From our analysis, we conclude that CLA4 is a putative dephosphorylation target of

375

the STRIPAK complex, and AP-MS analysis indicates further an association with

376

the striatin-interacting protein PRO22 (Märker 2019). Previous studies in human

377

showed that the association of the CLA4 homologue PAK1 with PP2A plays a role

378

in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the heart. In particular, these studies indicated

379

that PAK1 induces auto-dephosphorylation of the catalytic subunit PP2Ac at the

380

phosphorylation site Y307 through a scaffolding mechanism. Subsequently, PP2A

381

antagonizes the effects of cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) on Ca2+ channels activity

382

(Ke et al. 2008; Ke et al. 2013). Further, there is evidence that PAK1 and PP2A form

383

a signalling module in mast cells, where PP2A dephosphorylates PAK1 at T423 in

384

the activation loop, resulting in the disassembly of PP2A (Staser et al. 2013).

385

In conclusion, our study indicates that the STRIPAK complex regulates numerous

386

signalling pathways controlling different biological processes in

387

macrospora. These results increase our current basic knowledge about the function

388

of the eukaryotic STRIPAK complex and further support the notion that STRIPAK is

389

a central regulator of diverse cellular processes. Moreover, our study provides clear

390

evidence that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of residue S685 of Cla4 is

391

crucial for fungal cellular development. Finally, since this amino acid has not yet

392

been reported to be phosphorylated in other eukaryotes, our findings will encourage

393

future investigations of this phosphorylated site in CLA4 homologues, which in

394

humans were considered to be therapeutic targets in cancer and allergen-induced

395

disorders (Kichina et al. 2010; Pandolfi et al. 2015).

Strains and growth conditions

401

All S. macrospora strains (Table S1) were grown under standard conditions, unless

402

otherwise described (Kamerewerd et al. 2008). DNA-mediated transformation was

403

performed as described previously (Nordzieke et al. 2015), but lacking caylase

404

treatment during protoplast formation. Transformants were selected on medium

405

containing hygromycin B (80 U/ml) and/or nourseothricin (100 µg/ml). Growth tests

406

were performed three times with three technical replicates per strain, and hyphal

407

growth was measured as described before (Teichert et al. 2017). For each

408

experiment, petri dishes with solid SWG medium were inoculated with an 8-mm-

409

diameter agar plug and incubated for 2 days. Isolation of DNA and Southern

410

hybridization were performed as described previously (Kamerewerd et al. 2008).

411

For cloning and propagation of recombinant plasmids, E. coli XL1-Blue MRF‘

412

(Jerpseth et al. 1992) and NEB5α (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) were

413

used under standard laboratory conditions (Sambrook and Russell 2001). For

414

plasmid construction, homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae PJ69-4a was

415

performed (James et al. 1996) as described previously (Colot et al. 2006).

416

Recombinant yeast strains were selected on minimal medium, lacking uracil; all

417

other experiments with yeast were carried out according to standard protocols

418

(Clontech Yeast Protocol Handbook, PT3024-1).

419

Protein extraction, enrichment, and fractionation

420

For protein extraction, S. macrospora strains were precultured in petri dishes with

421

20 ml liquid BMM with two biological replicates per strain at 27°C for 2 days. Three

422

standardized inoculates of each BMM preculture were transferred in petri dishes

423

with 20 ml liquid BMM and grown at 27°C and 40 rpm for 3 days. For cell wall lysis

424

and protein extraction, mycelium was harvested and freezed within 60 s. The frozen

425

mycelium was ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in FLAG extraction buffer

426

(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40,1 mM PMSF,

427

0.2% protease inhibitor cocktail IV, 1.3 mM benzamidine, as well as 1%

428

phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II and III). Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged

429

at 4°C and 15,000 rpm for 30 min (modified after Teichert et al. 2014). The same

430

lysates were used for proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses. Protein

431

concentration in all lysates was determined by a calorimetric bicinchoninic acid

432

assay (Pierce BCA protein concentration assay kit) following the manufacturer’s

433

protocol. Carbamidomethylation was performed by reduction of free cysteine

434

residues by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 10 mM and

435

incubation for 30 min at 56°C followed by alkylation with 30 mM iodoacetamide (IAA)

436

for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Excess of IAA was quenched by further

437

addition of 10 mM fresh DTT. Samples were purified prior to digestion by ethanol

438

precipitation and resuspended with 40 µl of 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, followed

439

by dilution with ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8) to a final concentration of 0.2

440

M and addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mM. Trypsin was added at a

441

1:20 (protease:substrate (w/w)) ratio and samples were incubated for 14 h at 37°C.

442

Digestion was stopped by addition of 10% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final

443

concentration of 1%. Acidified peptides were desalted and quality controlled as

444

described previously (Burkhart et al. 2011). Peptides were then dried down

445

completely using a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.5M triethylammonium

446

bicarbonate (pH 8.5). Per sample, 150 μg of tryptic peptide were labelled with iTRAQ

447

8-plex reagents (AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) following the manufacturers

448

protocol. After pooling and quenching, an aliquot corresponding to 70 μg of total

449

peptide amount was taken for global proteome analysis. From this, 35 μg were

450

fractionated by high-pH reversed phase chromatography using an Ultimate 3000

451

HPLC (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a C18 column (BioBasic-18, 5 μm particle

452

size, 300 Å pore size, 150 x 0.5 mm). A total of 20 fractions was collected in 1 min

453

windows using a concatenated collection mode.

454

For protein enrichment, the remaining multiplexed sample (1,130 μg) was dried

455

under vacuum and subjected to a phosphopeptide-enrichment protocol using

456

titanium dioxide (TiO2, Titansphere TiO, 5 µm particle size, GL Sciences Inc, Japan)

457

adapted from a previous report (Engholm-Keller et al. 2012). For protein

458

fractionation, phosphopeptides were fractionated by hydrophilic interaction liquid

459

chromatography on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany)

460

and a total of 13 fractions was collected.

461

LC-MS/MS analysis

462

Samples for global proteome analysis were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using

463

an Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC HPLC coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer

464

(both Thermo Scientific). Preconcentration of peptides was performed on a

465

precolumn (Pepmap RSLC, Thermo Scientific, C18, 100 µm x 2 cm) for 10 min at

466

20 µl/min flow (0.1% TFA) followed by separation on a 75 µm x 2 cm C18 main

467

column (Pepmap RSLC, Thermo Scientific). A binary gradient was used with 0.1%

468

formic acid (FA) as solvent A and 84% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1 % FA as solvent B. A

469

linear gradient was used with solvent B increasing from 3 to 35% in 120 min, The

470

MS was operated in the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, first performing a

471

survey scan from 300 to 1,500 m/z at a resolution of 60,000, with the AGC target

472

set to 3 x 106 and the maximum injection time to 120 ms. The polysiloxane ion at

473

m/z 371.101236 was used as lock mass and the top 15 most intense ions were

474

subjected to higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and subsequent MS/MS

475

analysis. HCD normalized collision energy was set to 31% and quadrupole isolation

476

width was limited to 0.7 m/z. MS/MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 15,000

477

with an AGC target value of 2 x 105, a maximum allowed injection time of 250 ms,

478

and a fixed first mass of 90 m/z. Dynamic exclusion of precursor ions was set to 30

479

s. To reduce charge states of precursor ions, a 10% (v/v) NH4OH solution was

480

placed at the nano source as described previously (Thingholm et al. 2010).

481

Phosphopeptide fractions were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an Ultimate

482

3000 nanoRSLC HPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS (both Thermo

483

Scientific). LC separation was performed as described above, using a gradient from

484

3 to 42% B in 90 min. The MS was operated in the DDA mode with a 3 s cycle time

485

(Top Speed). Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 while for

486

MS/MS scans this was set to 30,000. AGC target values were 2 x 105 and 1 x 105,

487

respectively. Maximum injection times were 50 ms and 200 ms and HCD collision

488

energy was 40%. Quadrupole isolation was performed with a 0.8 m/z window and

489

all other settings were kept as described above.

490

Proteomics data analysis

491

Acquired raw data was analysed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific),

492

incorporating the search algorithms Mascot (Version 2.4.1, Matrix Science),

493

Sequest HT, and MS Amanda. The searches were conducted in a target/decoy

494

manner against a S. macrospora protein sequence database (10,091 target

495

sequences) with the same settings for all three algorithms: Precursor mass

496

tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Cleavage

497

specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of 2 allowed missed cleavages.

498

iTRAQ-8 plex on peptide N-termini and lysines as well as carbamidomethylation of

499

cysteines was set as fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine and

500

phosphorylation (only phosphoproteome data) of serine, threonine, or tyrosine was

501

allowed as variable modifications. For phosphoproteome analysis, the phosphoRS

502

(version 3.1) node (Taus et al. 2011) was used to determine modification site

503

confidence. Percolator was used to filter the results to a false discovery rate (FDR)

504

of 1% on the PSM level and only rank 1 hits were allowed. For global proteome data,

505

a minimum of 2 uniquely identified peptides per protein were required, while for the

506

phosphoproteome data, only quantified PSMs with identified phosphorylations and

507

a phosphoRS site probability ≥ 90 % were exported.

508

To correct for systematic errors during sample labelling, global proteome data was

509

normalized by correction factors calculated from the summed total intensities of all

510

iTRAQ channels. Mean ratios of biological replicates were calculated and proteins

511

with a change in abundance greater than two times the standard deviation of the

512

respective

513

phosphoproteome data, an Excel macro was used provided by Taus et al. (2011).

514

Data were normalized using the correction factors determined from the global data.

515

Only ratios of confidently localized phosphorylations were used in the analysis and

516

mean of biological replicates was calculated. Two times the standard deviation of

517

the total data set of the respective condition was used as the criterion to determine

518

regulation of each phosphopeptide.

519

Phosphorylation motif analysis

520

To identify overrepresented consensus motifs of the identified phosphorylation sites,

521

seven flanking amino acids up- and downstream of the modified residues were

522

extracted. The motifs of up- or downregulated sites in the individual deletion strains

523

were uploaded to the MoMo web server (Cheng et al. 2018). Significantly enriched

524

motifs were identified using the motif-x algorithm and the S. macrospora protein

525

database (10,091 sequences) as context sequence and requiring a minimum

526

number of 20 occurrences and a p-value of threshold of 1E-6.

527

Construction of plasmids

528

All oligonucleotides and plasmids are listed in the supporting information (Tables S2

529

and S3). The knock-out plasmid pKO-8843 for the deletion of cla4 was generated

530

by yeast recombination. For this purpose, the 5’- and 3’-flanking regions of cla4 were

531

amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of S. macrospora with the primers 8843-

532

5fw/8843-5rv-hph and 8843-3fw/8843-3rv, respectively, and transformed together

with an hph cassette cut with EcoRI out of plasmid pDrive-hph (Nowrousian and

Cebula 2005) and EcoRI/XhoI-linearized plasmid pRS426 (Christianson et al. 1992)

535

in yeast.

536

Yeast recombination was also used to obtain the complementation plasmid pNA-

537

8843. For this purpose, the cla4 gene and the corresponding 5‘- and 3‘-flanking

538

regions containing the promotor and terminator of cla4 were amplified from genomic

539

DNA of S. macrospora with the primers 8843-5fw and 8843-3rv, and recombined

540

into the HindIII/XhoI-linearized plasmid pRSnat (Klix et al. 2010).

541

For construction of plasmids encoding phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of

542

CLA4 with the amino acid substitutions S685A or S685D, the Q5® Site-Directed

543

Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer’s

544

protocol. For the PCR, pNA-8843 was used as template with the primers Cla4-

545

S685A-2-fw/Cla4-S685-2-rv and Cla4-S685D-2-fw/Cla4-S685-2-rv, resulting in

546

pNA-8843-S685A and pNA-8843-S685D, respectively.

547

Plasmids encoding the phospho-mimetic and -deficient variants of CLA4 with the

548

amino acid substitutions S78A or S78D were generated by the yeast recombination

549

system. PCRs with the primers 8843-5fw-NheI/8843-S78A-rv, 8843-5fw-NheI/8843-

550

S78D-rv, 8843-S78A-fw/8843-rv, and 8843-S78D-fw/8843-rv were performed using

551

genomic DNA of S. macrospora as template. Using primers 8843-3fw/8843-3rv-

552

NheI, the 3’ end of cla4 was amplified. All PCR fragments, the EcoRI-linearized hph

553

cassette, (pDrive-hph), together with the EcoRI/XhoI-linearized yeast vector

554

pRS426 were transformed into yeast (PJ69-4a). The resulting plasmids carry the

555

mutated cla4 gene and received the designations pCla4-S78A and pCla4-S78D.

556

Plasmids pCla4-S78A and pCla4-S78D were restricted with StuI/KspI, and

557

fragments carrying the mutated cla4 gene were integrated into StuI/KspI-linearized

558

pNA-8843. The resulting plasmids were designated pNA-8843-S78A and pNA-

559

8843-S78D, respectively.

560

Generation of ∆cla4, and phospho-mimetic and -deficient mutants

561

For generation of a ∆cla4 strain, plasmid pKO-8843 was linearized with EcoRI and

562

transformed into ∆ku70 (Pöggeler and Kück 2006). The primary transformants were

563

selected for hygromycin B resistance and verified by PCR analysis (data not shown).

564

Ascospore isolates of the ∆cla4 strain with the wild-type genetic background (lacking

565

the ∆ku70 mutation) were obtained by mating with spore colour mutant fus as

566

described previously (Kück et al. 2009; Nowrousian et al. 2012). The recombinant

567

strains were verified by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. S4). To restore the

568

wild-type phenotype, plasmid pNA-8843 was transformed into the ∆cla4 recipient.

569

The corresponding transformant was designated ∆cla4::cla4.

570

Transformation of pNA-8843-S78A, pNA-8843-S78D, pNA-8843-S685A, and pNA-

571

8843-S685D into the ∆cla4 recipient strain resulted in cla4-S78A, cla4-S78D, cla4-

572

S685A, and cla4-S685D carrying the phospho-mimetic and -deficient mutations in

573

the cla4 gene. The point mutations of cla4 in diverse transformants were verified by

574

PCR and DNA sequencing analysis.

575

Microscopic investigations

576

Light microscopy of different developmental stages and hyphal fusion events was

577

performed by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy using an

578

AxioImager microscope (Zeiss) with a Photometrix Cool SnapHQ camera (Roper

Scientific) and the software MetaMorph (version 7.7, Universal Imaging). For light

580

microscopy of smashed perithecia and ascospores, the AxioPhot microscope

581

(Zeiss) was used, and images were obtained with an AxioCam color and ZEN

582

software (version 2.3, Zeiss). For microscopic investigation of different

583

developmental stages, S. macrospora strains were grown on BMM-covered slides

584

at 27 °C and constant light for 2-7 d (Engh et al. 2007). For microscopic analysis of

585

hyphal fusion events, strains were incubated on cellophane-covered solid MMS

586

medium at 27°C for 2-4 d (Rech et al. 2007). For microscopic analysis of perithecia

587

and ascospores, strains were grown at 27 °C and constant light for 14 d. After

588

transferring perithecia to slides, 0,96 % NaCl solution was added, and perithecia

589

were smashed open.

Figure 1: iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry workflow for proteomic and
phospho-proteomic analysis of STRIPAK deletion mutants. For protein
extraction, wild type and three deletion mutants were grown for three days. Two
biological replicates were used for each strain. Following tryptic digestion, peptides
of each sample were labeled at the N-terminus with isobaric tags for relative and
absolute quantification (iTRAQ). After sample mixing, fractionation for the global
proteome analysis and enrichment of phosphopeptides by titanium dioxide (TiO 2)
and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) were conducted.
Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and tandem mass
spectrometry analysis (MS/MS) generated reporter ions with specific masses, which
were used for quantification.

Figure S3: Multiple sequence alignment of CLA4 proteins from filamentous

1139

fungi, yeast and human using ClustalW. CLA4 sequences are from the following

1140

organisms: S. macrospora (Sm, KAA8624319.1), N. crassa (Nc, EAA28056.1), F.

1141

graminaerum (Fg, SCB65154.1), M. grisea (Mg, AAL15449.2), B. cinerea (Bc,

1142

XP_024547628.1), A. nidulans (An, EAA60124.1) as well as S. cerevisiae (Sc,

1143

CAA96216.1) and H. sapiens (Hs, AAC50590.1). The p21-binding domain (PBD)

1144

(199-253) and the kinase domain (549-815) are displayed by purple and light blue

1145

boxes, respectively. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (88-190) is shown by a

1146

green box. Red and dark blue asterisks indicate the identified phosphorylation sites

1147

of S. macrospora CLA4 and the substrate binding sites, respectively. % identity

1148

shows the percentage of identical amino acids compared to S. macrospora CLA4.

1164

are indicated by grey letters and a bold grey line, respectively. (B) PCR analyses for

1165

verifications of the ∆cla4 deletion strains RM1861, RM1911 and RM1918. The

1166

homologous integration of the 5’ and 3’ flank and the cla4 deletion was verified by

1167

PCR using the indicated oligonucleotides. Wild type served as a control, and the

1168

negative control (NK) contained no genomic DNA. (C) XbaI restricted genomic DNA

1169

served for Southern hybridization analysis with the radioactively labelled cla4
