ABSTRACT

23

Arabis alpina, similar to woody perennials, has a complex architecture with a zone of axillary

24

vegetative branches and a zone of dormant buds that serve as perennating organs. We show that

25

floral development during vernalization is the key for shaping the dormant bud zone by

26

facilitating a synchronized and rapid growth after vernalization and thereby causing an increase

27

in auxin response and transport and endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels in the stem.

28

Floral development during vernalization is associated with the development of axillary buds in

29

subapical nodes. Our transcriptome analysis indicated that these buds are not dormant during

30

vernalization but only attain sustained growth after the return to warm temperatures. Floral and

31

subapical vegetative branches grow after vernalization and inhibit the development of the buds

32

below. Dormancy in these buds is regulated across the A. alpina life cycle by low temperatures

33

and by apical dominance in a BRANCHED 1-dependent mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

36

Bud dormancy plays an important role in survival through harsh environmental conditions and

37

long-term growth1. Thus, during the perennial life cycle, axillary and apical buds transition

38

through the various stages of dormancy before they resume active organogenesis and develop

39

into flowering or vegetative branches2. During development the outgrowth of axillary buds

40

close to the shoot apical meristem is repressed by apical dominance, a phenomenon also known

41

as correlative inhibition, latency or paradormancy, which occurs in both annual and perennial

42

species3,4. This form of dormancy is not definitive and paradormant buds can resume growth

43

when the main shoot apex is removed5. Buds in trees and herbaceous perennials also enter two

44

other forms of dormancy, endo- and eco- dormancy2. Endodormancy is regulated by

45

endogenous signals within the bud whereas ecodormancy is imposed by unfavorable

46

environmental conditions6. During the life cycle of a perennial plant, apical or axillary buds

47

experience winter in the endodormant state and later become ecodormant so that they will

48

actively grow only during favorable environmental conditions. It is however very common in

49

perennials for branches to have axillary buds during spring and summer, which later on will

50

stay dormant across multiple growing seasons. These dormant buds serve as a backup bud bank

51

and, in case of damage, are used as reservoirs for potential growth facilitating a bet-hedging

52

mechanism7,8. Interestingly, dormant buds and actively growing (vegetative or reproductive)

53

axillary branches are organized in zones in a species specific pattern9,10.

54

The outgrowth of an axillary bud after decapitation involves two phases, firstly the rapid release

55

from dormancy and secondly its sustained growth11. Auxin, strigolactones, cytokinin and sugar

56

fine-tune this process by regulating the expression of the TCP transcription factor

57

BRANCHED 1 (BRC1)12. Decapitation causes an elevation of sucrose levels followed by a

58

depletion of the endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in the polar auxin transport stream,

59

which influences the auxin flux out of the axillary bud contributing to its sustainable growth13–

60

17

61

sequence having a similar effect to decapitation13,18. In an annual plant, the relation between

62

flowering and bud activation is easy to trace as its life cycle ends within one growing season.

63

However, many perennials spread the flowering process over several years and floral bud

64

initiation is temporally separated from anthesis.

65

Here we used the perennial Arabis alpina, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, to

66

investigate the link between flowering and the maintenance of a dormant bud bank in

. Flowering transition triggers the activation of the upper most axillary buds in a basipetal

perennials. The shoot architecture of A. alpina is polycarpic and consists of branches that

68

undergo flowering, others that remain vegetative and nodes with dormant axillary buds19. A.

69

alpina mutants or transgenic lines with reduced function in components of the age pathway

70

influence the fate of vegetative branches but still require exposure to prolonged cold to flower,

71

a process known as vernalization20–23. Interestingly, the maintenance of dormant buds is only

72

compromised in mutants that do not require vernalization19. The most described example is the

73

perpetual flowering 1 (pep1) mutant which carries lesions in the ortholog of the MADS box

74

transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)19,24,25. Here we show that the requirement

75

of vernalization to flower is linked to the maintainance of dormant axillary buds.

76
77

RESULTS

78

Flowering during vernalization correlates with the formation of a perennial shoot

79

architecture including a zone of dormant axillary buds

80

To assess the relationship between flowering and plant architecture, we exposed the accession

81

Pajares to different durations of vernalization that influence flowering and we scored bud activity

82

and fate. As shown previously, in 8-week-old plants vernalized for 12 weeks the shoot apical

83

meristem (I zone, nodes 29–40) and the lower axillary branches (V1 zone, nodes 1–12) flowered

84

(Fig. 1a,e,f)10,19. The architecture of A. alpina plants was already established 3 weeks after

85

vernalization, showing a clear inhibition of axillary bud growth in nodes 12–21, with leaf axils

86

showing no visible outgrowth or buds that did not grow more than 0.5 cm (V2 zone, Fig.

87

1a,b,e,f)10. The nodes above (nodes 22–29) contained buds that actively grew after vernalization

88

and giving rise to axillary branches that remained vegetative (V3 zone, Fig. 1b,e, f)10,19,26.

89

When we compared the architecture of plants after vernalization with the one before

90

vernalization we observed a similar pattern of growth as described previously19,26,27. The V1

91

branches developed before vernalization, the V2 buds were present on the axils of leaves before

92

vernalization, and the V3 branches arose in the axils of leaves that grew during vernalization.

93

It has been recently shown that extended vernalization is required to ensure floral

94

commitment10. To test whether extended vernalization influences the size of the V2 zone, we

95

exposed 8-week-old plants to 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 weeks of vernalization (Supplementary Fig.

96

1). The outgrowth of V3 branches and the inflorescence stem was accelerated after longer

97

durations of vernalization (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b)10. However, we observed no difference in

98

the number of dormant buds suggesting that extended vernalization does not have an impact on

99

the V2 buds (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). We then exposed plants to durations of vernalization

shorter than 12 weeks. As shown previously, plants grown continuously in LDs or vernalized

101

only for 3 weeks did not flower, whereas plants vernalized for 8 weeks showed extreme floral

102

reversion phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2)10,19. To follow bud activity, we measured the

103

length of axillary branches at each leaf axil 3 weeks after vernalization or after 11 weeks in LDs

104

for non-vernalized plants. Branch length in LD grown plants and in 3 week vernalized plants

105

was reduced acropetally (Fig. 1g,h). Interestingly, nodes 12–18 were completely inhibited only

106

in plants exposed to 12 weeks of vernalization (Fig. 1g,h). In plants vernalized for 8 weeks, the

107

zonation was visible by measuring the branch length (Fig. 1h) but no dormant bud zone was

108

observed (Fig. 1g,h). Nevertheless, in both 8 week and 12 week vernalized plants the nodes

109

occupied with actively growing branches were always just above the nodes with the inhibited

110

buds suggesting that the presence of V3 branches might be correlated with the stable inhibition

111

of bud growth in the V2 zone.

112

PEP1 determines the requirement for vernalization to flower and the fate of the V3 branches

113

after vernalization10,19. To test whether PEP1 plays a role in the zonation of A. alpina shoots,

114

we measured branch length and the fate of the axillary branches in the pep1-1 mutant compared

115

to the wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 3). pep1-1 flowered after 8 weeks in LDs and showed a

116

deviation in branching phenotype compared to the wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 3).

117

Nevertheless, both genotypes lacked the characteristic zonation observed in flowering plants

118

after vernalization suggesting that flowering in LDs does not ensure perennial plant architecture

119

in A. alpina. To test whether flowering during vernalization correlates with the repression of

120

V2 buds, we exposed plants of different ages to vernalization. Earlier reports showed that 3-

121

week-old plants are not competent to flower in response to vernalization and remain vegetative,

122

whereas 5-week-old plants flower (Supplementary Fig. 4)20,21,26. Plants grown for 3 weeks prior

123

to vernalization did not show bud inhibition at any node below the newly formed branches,

124

whereas in 5-week-old plants they did in nodes 3–8 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These plants also

125

contained V3 vegetative branches above the inhibited buds (nodes 8–19) (Supplementary Fig.

126

4c). Altogether, these results suggest that zones of differential bud activity in A. alpina are

127

formed only in genotypes that initiate flowering during vernalization.

128
129

V3 buds are not dormant at the end of vernalization, but attain sustained growth only

130

after the return to warm temperatures

131

In A. thaliana and other species, bud growth has been demonstrated using the auxin inducible

132

synthetic promoter DR513,17. To check whether V2 and V3 buds are active during or after

133

vernalization, we developed transgenic A. alpina plants carrying the DR5 promoter fused to the

134

reporter gene β-glucuronidase (GUS). We observed the GUS signal only after vernalization in

135

the vasculature of V3 buds and in the main stem just below the leaf nodes (Fig. 2 a-d). These

136

data suggest that at 5 days after vernalization the V3 buds are growing whereas the V2 buds are

137

not.

138

To investigate the molecular mechanisms that lead to the activation of V3 buds and the

139

inhibition of growth in V2 buds, we performed a transcriptome profiling on dissected buds

140

directly at the end of vernalization and 5 days after vernalization. The transcriptome of V2 and

141

V3 buds at 5 days after vernalization was the most dissimilar (1984 genes; +5dV2 vs +5dV3;

142

Fig. 2e; Supplementary Table 1). However, the transcriptome of V2 and V3 buds differed also

143

at the end of vernalization (1128 genes for +0V2 vs +0V3; Fig. 2e; Supplementary Table 1).

144

This suggests that the V2 and V3 buds were differentiated already during vernalization although

145

active growth of the V3 buds was only observed after vernalization. Interestingly, 93% of the

146

genes differentially expressed between V2 and V3 buds at the end of vernalization were

147

differentially expressed between samples after vernalization or/and between developmental

148

stages (Fig. 2e). Likewise, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that all GOs

149

enriched for the differentially expressed genes between V2 and V3 buds at the end of

150

vernalization were also found in the other comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary

151

Table 2). GO terms common to all comparisons were mainly associated with hormone

152

responses such as abscisic acid, ethylene and jasmonic acid (Supplementary Fig. 5). These

153

results suggest that hormones play an important role in the activation of V3 buds and the

154

repression of V2 buds. To identify genes that share similar expression patterns, we performed

155

hierarchical clustering analysis. We identified 34 co-expressed clusters, which were assigned

156

into two higher level clusters I and II (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, the separation of these higher level

157

clusters was shaped by the expression of genes in the V3 buds during vernalization. Genes in

158

Cluster I showed low and genes in Cluster II showed high transcript accumulation in V3 buds

159

at the end of vernalization (Fig. 2f). Genes in Cluster I3 and I6 showed higher transcript

160

accumulation in V3 buds after vernalization accounting for putative candidate genes involved

161

in the sustained growth of V3 buds (Fig. 2g,h). Specifically, in Cluster I3 most enriched GO

162

terms among the identified genes were associated with developmental processes including

163

genes involved in cell expansion (EXPB1) (Fig. 2g, I3, Supplementary Table 3). This result

164

clearly supports that V3 buds only grow after vernalization. The growth V3 buds was also

165

associated with the upregulation of transcript accumulation of the YUCCA2 homolog, a gene

166

coding for an enzyme that catabolizes the biosynthesis of IAA in A. thaliana, and the auxin

167

signaling factors IAA7 and IAA14, whose expression levels reflect also auxin levels, identified

168

in cluster I6 (Fig. 2h)28,29. These results confirm our DR5 results that the activation of auxin

169

response occurs in V3 buds after vernalization. Clusters I14, I15, I20, I21, II7 and II8 showed

170

different transcript accumulation between buds already during vernalization (Fig. 2i,j). Genes

171

in these clusters also showed similar differences in transcript accumulation after vernalization

172

indicating that the majority of the differences observed during vernalization are also maintained

173

afterwards. Genes in Clusters II7 and II8 showed higher transcript accumulation in V3 buds

174

compared to V2 buds and were enriched for GO terms related to cell division, which included

175

homologs of cell cycle regulators, such as PCNA1, previously shown to be upregulated during

176

bud activation in other species (Fig. 2j, Supplementary Fig. 3)30,31. These results suggest that

177

genes involved in cell cycle and transcription machinery are upregulated in V3 buds during

178

vernalization. Clusters I14, I15, I20 and I21 showed lower transcript accumulation in V3 buds

179

compared to V2 buds. Interestingly, all these clusters were enriched for GOs related to response

180

to abscisic acid and water deprivation and contained genes related to ABA signaling (e.g.

181

AIRP2, ABF1, ABF2, ABI1, ABI5, KIN2, AFP1 AFP3, BLH1 and PP2CA) or ABA biosynthesis

182

(e.g. NCED3) shown to be associated with bud dormancy in several species (Fig. 3i)32–35. We

183

also detected the dehydrin coding genes ERD10, ERD14 and RAB18, which are induced by

184

ABA and suggested to prevent water dehydration during tree winter dormancy (Fig. 3i)36.

185

Transcript accumulation of homologs of genes associated with repression of the cytokinin level

186

and response such as CKX1 and KMD1–4 were also detected in these clusters (Fig. 3i)37,38.

187

These data suggest that V3 buds during vernalization might contain lower levels of ABA that

188

represses bud outgrowth and higher levels of cytokinin that promotes bud outgrowth compared

189

to V2 buds. We also identified the homologs of genes that have been previously shown in A.

190

thaliana to respond to conditions that trigger dormancy and therefore are considered as

191

dormancy markers39. This includes the A. alpina homologs of HB21, HB53, PSY1, NAC029,

192

SAG21 and HIS1-3 (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Table 5). Interestingly, genes in I21, in contrast to

193

clusters I14, I15 and I20, showed a high transcript upregulation in V2 buds after vernalization

194

(Fig. 2i). In addition to ABA signalling genes described before, we also detected the homologs

195

of the strigolactone signaling genes D14 and SMAX1 in this cluster. D14 in A. thaliana and its

196

homologs in other species regulate bud dormancy40,41. These results suggest that the dormancy

197

status of the V2 buds is enhanced after vernalization which correlates with the activation of

198

genes involved in ABA and SL signaling. Interestingly, we also identified homologs of the

199

floral repressors such as TEM1, TFL1 and SMZ that regulate flowering through the age pathway

200

(Fig. 2i)20,42–45. This result suggests that V3 buds are more competent to flower compared to V2

201

buds during and after vernalization and may relate to the low dormancy status of these axillary

202

meristems.

203
204

Inhibition of V2 buds is controlled by paradormancy after vernalization and correlates

205

with the increase of auxin in the stem

206

To identify whether the outgrowth of V2 buds is determined by other parts of the plant or by

207

environmental conditions, we performed a series of decapitation and excision experiments (Fig.

208

3a). We first addressed the bud behavior in the V2 zone after vernalization by excising buds or

209

branches at the end of vernalization. Excision of inflorescence buds (I) or V1 branches

210

separately reduced the number of buds observed in the V2 zone (nodes 11–16; Fig. 3a, b). The

211

biggest effect on bud outgrowth in the V2 zone was observed when we excised both

212

inflorescence and V3 buds (I+V3) together. Removal of V3 buds alone was only feasible 2

213

weeks after vernalization when the V3 branches were already expanding and only had a slight

214

effect on the V2 zone (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results suggest that the outgrowth of buds

215

within the V2 zone is influenced by other parts of the plant after vernalization. We also tested

216

the effect of decapitation in plants exposed to different durations of vernalization

217

(Supplementary Fig. 7a). In all treatments, the branches in the V2 zone responded to

218

decapitation and were longer compared to non-decapitated controls (Supplementary Fig. 7b).

219

Interestingly, decapitation of plants vernalized for 12 weeks showed the biggest effect

220

compared to the controls suggesting that stable repression of V2 buds occurs only after 12

221

weeks of vernalization (Supplementary Fig. 7b). These results suggest that V2 buds are not

222

endodormant during vernalization. To assess the effect of the vernalization treatment on bud

223

outgrowth we decapitated plants and subsequently exposed them to 12 weeks of vernalization

224

(Supplementary Fig. 7c). Decapitated and intact vernalized plants showed a similar number of

225

buds in nodes 0–11 suggesting that cold during vernalization imposes an ecodormant state in

226

the V2 buds (Supplementary Fig. 7d,e). Overall, these results suggest that V2 buds are

227

ecodormant during vernalization and paradormant after vernalization.

228

To link these results to our transcriptome studies we tested the expression patterns of a set of

229

identified genes after decapitation (Fig. 3c). Most genes tested showed higher transcript

230

accumulation in V2 buds compared to V3 buds at the end and/or after vernalization and their

231

transcript accumulation was reduced in decapitated plants (Fig. 3c). Since auxin is a major

232

regulator of apical dominance, we measured auxin response in the DR5::GUS lines after

233

decapitation. At the end of vernalization, stems within the V2 zone did not show strong GUS

234

staining (Fig. 4a,d). A strong GUS signal was detected within 1 week after vernalization in the

235

epidermis and in the vasculature of V2 stems and was reduced in decapitated plants (Fig. 4c,f,

236

Supplementary Fig. 8). We also measured the levels of endogenous IAA in V2 stems of intact

237

plants during the A. alpina life cycle. Similar to DR5::GUS results, IAA levels in V2 stems

238

were reduced during vernalization and transiently increased again after vernalization (Fig. 4g).

239

Interestingly, IAA levels at 2 weeks after vernalization were very high, which correlated with

240

high IAA levels in the stems of the rapidly growing tissues (inflorescence and V3 branches)

241

above the V2 zone (Fig. 4h,i). Decapitation at the end of vernalization also resulted in a decrease

242

of the endogenous IAA levels in V2 stems (Fig. 4j). This result suggests that the faster

243

outgrowth of the inflorescence and V3 branches after vernalization induces a higher IAA in the

244

V2 stem. To assess the role of auxin and auxin transport in the inhibition of the V2 buds we

245

applied the synthetic auxin NAA and the transport inhibitor NPA in vernalized plants before

246

transferring them to normal greenhouse conditions. NAA treatment increased the number of

247

inhibited buds (Fig. 4k,l) whereas NPA treatment reduced the number of inhibited buds in the

248

V2 zone compared to mock-treated plants (Fig. 4l). In addition, NPA strongly impaired the

249

development of the inflorescence and V1 branches (Fig. 4k). These results confirmed the

250

importance of auxin levels and auxin transport for the inhibition of the buds in the V2 zone after

251

vernalization. We subsequently measured the IAA transport capacity using acropetal 3H-IAA

252

treatment in excised V2 stem segments from 8-week-old plants in LDs (8wLD), plants

253

vernalized for 12 weeks (+0) and 5 days after vernalization (+5d). 3H-IAA levels in V2 stems

254

were higher before and after vernalization, compared to at the end of vernalization (Fig. 4m,n).

255

Our results suggest that vernalization leads to a decrease in auxin transport in V2 stems (Fig.

256

4o). Altogether we conclude that the outgrowth of the inflorescence and the vegetative branches

257

after vernalization correlates with an enhancement of endogenous IAA levels, auxin response

258

and transport in the V2 zone after vernalization which may stably repress the outgrowth of V2

259

buds (Fig. 4o). During vernalization, although auxin transport is low, the development of V2

260

axillary buds is inhibited (Fig. 4o).

261
262

AaBRC1 ensures the maintenance of the dormant V2 buds after vernalization

263

We subsequently tested the expression of genes differentially expressed in our transcriptome

264

analysis on V2 buds across the A. alpina life cycle, before, at the end and after vernalization.

265

In addition to our candidate genes we followed the expression patterns of the A. alpina homolog

266

of BRC1 (AaBRC1) and its paralog BRC2 (AaBRC2), as in A. thaliana the majority of our

267

candidate genes are misexpressed in the brc1 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 9a)46. Compared to

268

before vernalization, AaBRC1 transcript levels in the V2 buds were increased after prolonged

BRC1-downstream genes also showed an increase of expression in vernalization (Fig. 5a).

272

Interestingly, transcript accumulation of AaHIS1-3 only increased after vernalization,

273

suggesting a BRC1-independent regulation of bud dormancy in A. alpina (Fig. 5a). We also

274

created transgenic lines with reduced expression of AaBRC1. Plants of 35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi

275

lines 1 and 2 showed significant downregulation of AaBRC1 expression whereas line 3 did not

276

(Supplementary Fig. 9b). We characterized the 35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi lines in the same

277

conditions (before, at the end and after vernalization). Before and at the end of vernalization we

278

observed no major difference in branch number and branch length (Fig. 5b,c, Supplementary

279

Fig. 10a,b). Transgenic lines also flowered with a similar total number of leaves compared to

280

control plants (Supplementary Fig. 10 d-h). We observed a phenotype only after vernalization,

281

and nodes 12-16 corresponding to the V2 zone in 35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi lines 1 and 2 were

282

occupied by a branch (Fig. 5b,e,f, Supplementary Fig. 10c). In these lines, transcript levels of

283

AaHB53 were reduced in V2 buds of 35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi lines 1 and 2 at the end and after

284

vernalization but not before vernalization (Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly, the transcript

285

accumulation of AaHIS1-3 and AaAIRP2 was not misregulated in the 35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi lines

286

in all developmental stages (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results suggest that the activity of

287

V2 buds is regulated by AaBRC1 after vernalization, although an AaBRC1-independent

288

pathway might exist.

DISCUSSION

291

The induction of flowering in temperate perennials is uncoupled from anthesis so that the

292

flowering process takes place for several years8,10,48,49. In the alpine perennial A. alpina, flower

293

buds are formed during vernalization and emerge when plants experience favorable

294

environmental conditions. Despite the differences in flowering behavior, similar principles of

295

bud activation described in A. thaliana also apply in A. alpina. For example, axillary buds close

296

to the shoot apical meristem are temporarily inhibited during vegetative development and the

297

initiation of flowering results in the activation of the upper most axillary buds13. However, floral

298

development prior to anthesis is the key for the establishment of a zone of dormant axillary

299

buds. During vernalization, flowering in the main shoot apex always correlates with the

300

presence of V3 buds19. Our transcriptome analysis suggests that at the end of vernalization V3

301

buds are not dormant and might not be dormant throughout the vernalization period. In tulip

302

bulbs, which show a similar pattern of axillary bud activity, the axillary buds located close to

303

the flowering shoot apex never arrest growth50. However, exposure to warm temperatures is

304

still required to achieve sustained growth of the V3 buds. This suggests that, in contrast to other

305

species, the phases of bud activation and sustained growth are temporarily separated in A.

306

alpina. The link between flowering and paradormancy has been demonstrated in A. thaliana

307

and rice with the flowering time regulator FLOWERING LOCUS T/Heading date 3a acting as

308

the systemic signal for flowering and axillary bud activation51–53. In A. alpina, the pep1-1

309

mutant has a clear branching phenotype suggesting that PEP1 might regulate the crosstalk

310

between flowering and bud activity. Other MADS box proteins have been reported in woody

311

perennials to regulate endodormancy and the requirement of prolonged exposure to cold to

312

break dormancy54.

313

Buds in the V2 zone probably transition between different forms of dormancy. Before

314

vernalization, V2 buds are only temporarily dormant due to apical dominance and during

315

exposure to vernalization become ecodormant. This is in contrast to studies in woody

316

perennials, in which buds enter a deeper form of dormancy – endodormancy – during the winter.

317

From the transcript levels of dormancy marker genes we can conclude that the dormancy status

318

of V2 buds is enhanced during vernalization. We detected genes associated with cell cycle and

319

cell division, ABA biosynthesis and signaling to be differentially expressed between dormant

320

(V2) and non-dormant buds (V3). The expression of many of the identified genes in our study

321

has been previously reported to be dependent on BRC146 and is induced under carbon limiting

322

conditions and bud dormancy in A. thaliana, grapevine and poplar buds39. In our system, the

323

enhancement of bud dormancy during cold correlates with the development of the inflorescence

324

meristem10,19. This suggests that sugar demand for inflorescence development during

325

vernalization might be responsible for the carbon starvation response observed in axillary buds.

326

The timing of bud initiation, whether it occurs before or during vernalization might also be an

327

important factor as the carbon starvation response might explain the dormancy status of V2, but

328

not the activation of V3 buds. The link between flowering and bud activity has also been

329

explained by the release from apical dominance due to changes in polar auxin transport13. At

330

the end of vernalization, the low IAA levels indicate either that after prolonged exposure to cold

331

the levels of auxin transported basipetally is diminished probably due to a generalized

332

slowdown of growth or that cold influences the auxin metabolism. After the return to warm

333

temperatures, V2 buds once more enter a paradormant state being dominated by the

334

inflorescence and V3 or V1 branches. The transition from the ecodormant back to the

335

paradormant state involves the enhancement of basipetal auxin transport after vernalization and

336

increased activity of AaBRC1.

337

Overall, we conclude that A. alpina is a good model system to follow different stages of

338

dormancy across the perennial life cycle and to dissect the phases of bud outgrowth, release of

339

dormancy and sustained branch growth.

341

Methods

342

Plant material, growth conditions and phenotyping. All our experiments were performed

343

with the Arabis alpina accession Pajares or the pep1-1 mutant described by Wang et al.19. Seeds

344

were stratified on humidified paper at 4°C in the dark for 4 days prior to germination on soil

345

under temperatures ranging from 20 °C during the day to 18 °C during the night in a long day

346

(LD, 16 hours light, 8 hours dark) greenhouse. After 8 weeks of growth, vernalization

347

treatments were carried out in a short day (SD, 8 hours light, 16 hours dark) growth chamber at

348

4°C for different durations of vernalization (depending on the experiment) before the plants

349

were moved back to a LD (16 hours light, 8 hours dark) greenhouse at 20°C. For the juvenility

350

experiment plants were grown for 3 weeks (juvenile) or 5 weeks (adult) before being vernalized.

351

For 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments at the

352

end of vernalization and one week after vernalization, plants were sprayed with 100 µM NAA

353

(Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µM NPA (Chem Service) or DMSO as a mock treatment with 0.2% (v/v)

354

Tween-20 immediately after being transferred back to a LD greenhouse. Excision of

355

inflorescence and/or V3 buds at the end of vernalization was performed under a

356

stereomicroscope by removing the eight nodes below of the lowest flowering bud. In the simple

357

decapitation method (Supplementary Fig. 7), the apex was cut off directly above the point where

358

no stem elongation was observed, corresponding to nodes 11–14 within the V2 zone. The shoot

359

architecture at different time points was recorded by observing the fate and the length of the

360

branch at each node of the plant, and the number and type of branches per zone. All experiments

361

were performed with 10 to 12 plants.

362
363

Plasmid constructs. The DR5::GUS fragment (excised from plasmid DR5::GUS, kindly

364

provided by Tom Guilfoyle) was introduced into the GATEWAY-compatible pEarleyGate 301

365

plasmid containing the BASTA resistance gene using site-directed recombination. For the

366

35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi constructs, three cDNA fragments of AaBRC1 (Fragment 1-3; see

367

Supplementary Table 5) were amplified and introduced into the GATEWAY-compatible

368

pJawohl-8-RNAi plasmid using site-directed recombination. The names of the A. alpina

369

35S:AaBRC1dsRNAi lines correspond to the fragments introduced. For each construct,

homozygous transgenic A. alpina lines carrying single-copy transgenes were generated using

371

the floral dip method55.

373

GUS staining. For GUS staining assays, stems within the V2 zone below the point where no

374

stem elongation was observed were harvested and leaf axils carrying V2 and V3 buds of

375

DR5::GUS plants were excised and placed directly into 90% ice-cold acetone and incubated for

376

1 h on ice. V3 buds were identified as the 8 nodes directly below the flowering buds. V2 buds

377

were identified below the V3 buds where no stem elongation was observed. The samples were

378

washed in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and submerged in 2.5 mL GUS staining solution

379

under moderate vacuum for 20 min56. After incubation at 37°C in the dark for a maximum of

380

16 h, chlorophyll was removed by transferring the samples through an ethanol series. GUS

381

activity was observed in whole stem tissues, transverse stem sections or longitudinal leaf axil

382

sections. We prepared 50–60 µm sections on a Leica VT1000S vibratome from samples

383

immobilized on 6% (w/v) agarose. Representative photographs from two different biological

384

experiments were taken using the stereomicroscope Nikon SMZ18 and Nikon Digital Sight

385

camera (DS-Fi2) for whole stem segments, and the Zeiss Axio Imager microscope with the

386

Zeiss Axio Cam 105 color camera for cuttings.

387
388

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. For RNA-Seq transcript profiling and quantitative RT-

389

PCR analysis, V2 and V3 buds were specifically harvested under a stereomicroscope

390

immediately after vernalization and 5 days after vernalization. In all experiments, V2 buds

391

corresponded to the leaf axils 16–19, and V3 buds corresponded to the leaf axils 23–26. For

392

quantification of the GUS expression of the DR5::GUS lines, the stem was cut off directly

393

below the point where stem elongation was observed, axillary buds were removed so that RNA

394

was isolated only from three internodes within the V2 zone. Each experiment comprised three

395

independent biological replicates. Samples were stored at –80°C prior to RNA extraction. Total

396

RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s

397

instructions, followed by a DNase treatment with Ambion DNA free-kit DNase treatment and

398

removal (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2 µg) was used for the synthesis of cDNA by reverse

399

transcription with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo dT (18) primers.

the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs) and the

405

library was prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina

406

(New England Biolabs). RNA quality and quantity were checked by capillary electrophoresis

407

(TapeStation, Agilent Technologies) and fluorometry (Qubit, Thermo Fisher Scientific) after

408

each step. Sequencing was carried out using a HiSeq3000 (Illumina) with 1 x 150 bp single

409

reads.

410

Reads derived from the Illumina library were mapped and aligned to the reference genome

411

using HISAT2 followed by assembly and quantification of expression levels in different

412

samples using STRINGTIE. The gene counts of all samples were obtained by using a Python

413

script (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/dl/prepDE.py). The quality of the samples was

414

assessed by producing dispersion plots among replicates. The differentially expressed genes

415

with more than 2-fold change and a corrected p-value below 0.05 were obtained using DESeq2

416

and selected for further analysis. We focused on genes with a greater than 2-fold change in

417

transcript abundance. The complete transcriptome data set is available as series GSE126944 at

418

the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The Database for

419

Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; Huang et al., 2009) was used for

420

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for biological processes 5, with Benjamini corrected

421

P0.05. Only Arabidopsis annotated orthologues were included for GO analysis. Data were

422

clustered

423

(http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1303402). From the 25,817 genes which showed transcript

424

accumulation in at least one of the conditions tested, 4983 participated in the hierarchical

425

clustering. Only 11% of genes in the cluster did not behave similarly between replicates

426

(Supplementary Table S2; clusters I0 and II0). Venn diagrams were constructed using Venny

427

v2.1 (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/).

428

Quantitative real-time PCR. Three technical replicates were prepared using 26 ng of cDNA

429

for each reaction. The relative gene expression values were based on ΔCt calculations using the

430

mean of the two reference gene expression values, according to Pfaffl et al.,58. AaUBI10 and

431

AaPP2A were used for expression data normalization. The ΔCt values were scaled to the

432

average for the control condition. Primers used can be found in Supplementary Table 6.

444

directly above the point where no stem elongation was observed. The segments were placed on

445

wet paper and transferred to 30 μl 0.05% MES (pH 5.5–5.7) containing 100 nM 3H-IAA

446

(Hartmann Analytic). After incubation for 10 min, the stem segments were transferred to fresh

447

0.05% MES containing 1 µM IAA for 90 min60. Incubation was performed at 4°C for the stem

448

segment of samples harvested at the end of the vernalization. The stems were then cut into 3

449

mm segments and immersed in Rotiszint eco plus (Roth) for 16 h before the radiolabel was
