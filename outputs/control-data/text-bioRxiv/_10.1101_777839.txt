ABSTRACT

23

Neonates are at increased risk for bacterial sepsis as a result of immature immunity. We

24

established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in early life. In

25

the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 may predispose the neonatal

26

population to more severe infection during sepsis. In a neonatal sepsis model, systemic IL-27

27

levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27

28

expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most

29

abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with

30

increased mortality that was improved in WSX-1-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor.

31

Infected WSX-1-/- pups exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. IL-27 signaling

32

in WT mice promoted increased bacterial burdens and systemic inflammation compared to

33

WSX-1-/- neonates. This was consistent with more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2+ myeloid

34

cells and macrophages from WSX-1-deficient compared to wild-type neonates. Live animal

35

imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the

36

first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in neonates

37

while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with

38

suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 promotes

39

inflammation during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the

40

inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic

41

target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis.

44

A number of differences in the neonatal immune response compared with adults have

45

been well described. However, a mechanistic understanding of what needs to be overcome in the

46

neonate to generate a more protective immune response during acute bacterial infection has been

47

limited. The work described here helps fill the gap of what is necessary to overcome in order to

48

achieve improved host response to infection. To further the novelty, IL-27 has not previously

49

been attributed to dysfunction or deficiency in neonatal immunity. Our results enhance the

50

understanding of IL-27 biology in the neonatal population while providing evidence that elevated

51

IL-27 levels limit a protective immune response and are detrimental during neonatal sepsis.

52

Strategies aimed at targeting circulating IL-27 concentrations early in life have the potential to

53

improve control of bacterial infection in neonates.

INTRODUCTION

55

Neonates are highly vulnerable to bacterial infections and at increased risk of mortality.

56

Accuracy identifying the true global incidence of neonatal sepsis is influenced by challenges

57

with diagnostic criteria and reliable reporting, but current estimates indicate approximately 3

58

million infections annually (1).

59

infections are reported annually due to sepsis (2). The rate of cases per live birth increases

60

considerably with factors such as low-birth-weight and premature delivery (2). Sepsis is a

61

leading cause of morbidity mortality among infants in the first few days of life at any birth

62

weight (3). This is especially true for very low birth weight infants where sepsis also

63

significantly increases the length of hospital stay (4, 5).

In the United States alone, greater than 75,000 neonatal

64

Increased susceptibility to infection in neonates is reflective of a distinct immune profile

65

relative to adults that is often referred to as immature. Phenotypic and functional differences in

66

innate and adaptive immune function have been described in early life. In general, neonatal

67

immunity is considered biased toward a Th2/Treg response (6). Fewer numbers of immune cells

68

have been found in circulation with defects reported in microbial elimination processes, antigen

69

presentation, T cell priming, and T cell receptor repertoires (7-9). In addition, increased amounts

70

of cytokines such as IL-10, IL-23, and IL-27 are present, further supporting an anti-inflammatory

71

bias (10-12). This is consistent with reduced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α from

72

neonatal cells in response to TLR ligands compared with those from adults (13). Since adequate

73

Th1 responses can be induced in neonates in vivo when given the appropriate stimulus, innate

74

immune cells may provide signals that delay or misdirect the adaptive immune response (14).

75

Cumulatively, these immune findings are thought to contribute to the increased susceptibility of

76

neonates to infection.

77

Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine that consists of the Epstein-Barr virus-

78

induced gene 3 (EBI3) and IL-27p28 proteins (15). Engagement of the IL-27 receptor, composed

79

of WSX-1 and gp130, predominantly activates JAK-STAT signaling (16-18). IL-27, similar to

80

other members of the IL-12 family, was originally described as a cytokine that could drive

81

proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells (19). However, mice deficient for WSX-1 mount Th1

82

responses (18, 20-23). In these same animals, models of chronic disease and infection

83

demonstrate T cell hyperactivity suggesting that additional immune suppressive activity may

84

dominate (18, 21-24). Indeed, IL-27 antagonizes inflammatory T cell subsets by blocking IL-2

85

production, and activates IL-10 production by Treg cells (25). Similarly, innate immune function

86

is inhibited by IL-27. In macrophages, inflammatory cytokine production, inflammatory cytokine

87

receptor expression and signaling, intracellular trafficking to lysosomes, and lysosomal

88

acidification are negatively regulated by IL-27 (22, 26-31). This regulatory activity has been

89

shown to compromise control of M. tuberculosis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli (12, 26,

90

27, 30, 31). On the other side of the spectrum, IL-27 induces an inflammatory profile in

91

monocytes (32). Cumulatively, this body of literature suggests that IL-27 has important immune

92

regulatory function and opposes clearance of bacteria by macrophages. The effect of IL-27 may

93

be cell type and context-dependent, and the net influence on the compete host response in

94

neonates has not been understood.

95

We have established that IL-27 is produced at elevated levels early in life.

Human

96

macrophages derived from umbilical cord blood express IL-27p28 and EBI3 genes at increased

97

levels compared with macrophages derived from adult peripheral blood (11). This was

98

accompanied by greater levels of secreted IL-27 protein (33). Similarly, transcript levels for IL-

99

27 genes were increased in the spleens of neonatal and infant mice relative to adults (11). A

100

similar pattern of IL-27 production was observed in splenic macrophages from neonatal and

101

infant mice (11). Recently, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were shown to be a

102

significant source of IL-27, and these cells were more abundant in neonates than other age

103

groups (12). Other reports have shown a greater abundance of MDSCs in human blood during

104

the neonatal period (34, 35).

105

Considering the immune suppressive activity of IL-27, we have hypothesized that elevated

106

IL-27 early in life contributes to enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection. IL-27 has been

107

suggested as a biomarker for critically ill children and more recently declared a biomarker for

108

early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) (36, 37). In the present body of work, we examined the

109

impact of IL-27 on host protection during neonatal sepsis. We developed a murine model of

110

EONS in response to Escherichia coli. While Group B streptococci are the leading cause of

111

EONS overall, E. coli is responsible for the majority of deaths and is the leading cause when pre-

112

term and very-low birth weight babies are considered independently (3, 38). Our findings

113

demonstrate that IL-27 compromises host control of bacteria, consistent with elevated levels of

114

inflammation and increased mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals.

Breeding pairs of C57BL/6 (WT) or WSX-1-deficient (KO) mice on a

118

C57BL/6 genetic background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and

119

maintained at West Virginia University School of Medicine. Male and female pups were used

120

for experimental infection. Mice in this study were defined as neonates through 8 days of life as

121

described previously (11, 12). Blood and tissues were collected from mice at the appropriate age

Bioluminescent E. coli. E. coli O1:K1:H7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was transformed with

127

the pGEN-luxCDABE plasmid (Addgene #44918) by electroporation using a Micropulser (Bio-

128

Rad, Hercules, CA). This plasmid contains five lux genes with a selectable ampicillin resistance

129

marker (AmpR). To generate a stable integration, E. coli O1:K1:H7 was transformed with the

130

pMQ-tn-PnptII-lux suicide vector (a gift by Dr. Robert Shanks, University of Pittsburgh). This

131

plasmid contains a transposable element upstream of five lux genes, with a selectable ampicillin

132

resistance marker (AmpR). Transformation was performed by mating with the auxotrophic

133

strain RHO3 (39). Transformants were selected on ampicillin-supplemented LB agar and

134

screened for luminescent signal on a chemiluminescent imager. Luminescence was monitored

135

through 48 h of growth and infection to assess plasmid retention. Intravital imaging was

136

performed with E. coli expressing luciferase from the transformed plasmid. E. coli with stably

137

integrated lux genes were used in gentamicin protection assays to evaluate bacterial clearance.

138

Murine sepsis infection model. Neonatal pups at the ages of 3 or 4 days were infected

139

subcutaneously in the scapular region with E. coli strain O1:K1:H7. The bacteria from pre-titered

140

frozen cultures were washed with PBS, centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 min, and suspended in a

141

volume of PBS equivalent to an inoculum of 50 μL/mouse. Mice were inoculated using a 28-

142

gauge insulin needle (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). Vehicle (PBS)-inoculated pups were identified

143

from bacteria-infected pups using a tail snip. Survival studies were performed with an inoculum

144

of ~107 CFUs/mouse representing an approximate LD50. Other experiments to evaluate infection-

145

related parameters were performed with a target inoculum of ~2x106 CFUs/mouse to reduce

146

mortality so that sufficient numbers of control and infected animals could be studied in each

147

experiment. Weights of mice were recorded immediately prior to infection and then daily

148

thereafter. Following infection, mice were monitored twice daily for signs of morbidity. Mice

149

exhibiting signs of morbidity (i.e., unable to right themselves, significant weight loss, and lack of

150

movement) that met endpoint criteria were humanely euthanized. Peripheral tissues (spleen,

151

liver, kidney, brain, and lung) isolated from pups were placed in PBS on ice. Blood was

152

deposited in tubes that contained 5 μL of 500 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetate acid (EDTA,

153

Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ).

154

Bacterial burdens. Peripheral tissues were homogenized in PBS using a handheld pestle

155

motor (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ). Tissue homogenates and blood were serially diluted in

156

PBS and bacteria enumerated by standard plate counting on tryptic soy agar (TSA; Becton,

157

Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD). Agar plates were incubated at 37°C overnight.

158

Intracellular Cytokine Staining. Spleens were crushed in a 40-µm nylon strainer. Single

159

cell suspensions were treated with ACK lysis buffer (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) to lyse red blood

160

cells and washed in PBS that contained 10% FBS. Blood was pooled from control or infected

161

mice and washed in PBS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll

162

(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL) density gradient centrifugation at 400 x g for 30

163

minutes. Splenocytes and PBMCs were then treated with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec,

164

Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and GolgiStop (Protein Transport Inhibitor, Becton Dickinson,

165

Franklin, NJ) to inhibit protein secretion. Cell surface markers were immunolabeled with anti-

169

with anti-mIL-27 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described previously (11).

170

Immunolabeled cells were analyzed with a BDFortessa flow cytometer and FCS Express

171

(version 6; De Novo Software, Glendale, CA).

172

Quantitative real time PCR. Spleens were homogenized in TRI Reagent® (Molecular

173

Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Using the commercial product protocol, the upper aqueous

174

layer following phase separation was mixed with an equal volume of 75% ethanol and

175

transferred to EZNA RNA isolation columns (Omega Biotek, Norcross, GA). iScript™ cDNA

176

synthesis reagents (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were used to generate first strand cDNA according

177

to manufacturer protocol. Real time cycling of reactions that included cDNA diluted 15-fold

178

from above, gene-specific primer probe sets (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and iQTM

179

Supermix (Bio-Rad) was performed in triplicate using a Step One Plus (Applied Biosystems)

180

real time detection system. Gene-specific amplification was normalized to β-actin as an internal

181

reference gene. Log2 transformed changes in gene expression relative to control spleens were

182

determined using the formula 2-ΔΔCt.

Cytokine measurements.

Blood was collected from mice during euthanasia at the

184

indicated age and serum collected by standard techniques. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α serum levels

185

were measured using multiplexed luminescent detection reagents according to manufacturer’s

186

protocol (MesoScale Discovery, MSD, Rockville, MD).

187

concentrations of IL-27p28 were measured using single analyte luminescent detection reagents

190

In vivo imaging. Neonatal pups were imaged using an IVIS SpectrumCT (Perkin Elmer,

191

Waltham, MA). Mice were infected with the bioluminescent E. coli and imaged over time for

192

location and intensity of luminescence. To decipher between individual mice over time, tails

193

were tattooed using a 28-gauge insulin needle that inserts green or black tattoo paste (Ketchum

194

Manufacturing, Lake Luzerne, NY). Pups were anesthetized using an isoflurane chamber and

195

kept under anesthesia during imaging. Luminescence signal and images were processed using

196

Living Image 4.5 software (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Briefly, signal was quantified by

197

region of interest (ROI) construction around the area of luminescence in 2D images. Signal was

198

quantified in radiance units, and represented as total flux (photons/second). Luminescence scales

199

were set according to the colorimetric scale for WT or KO mice at each time point due to the

200

profound differences in signal between the two genotypes.

201

Gentamicin protection bacterial clearance assays. To generate bone marrow-derived

202

macrophages (BMDM), bone marrow progenitors were extracted from femurs, tibias, radius-

203

ulna, and humerus bones of C57BL/6 or WSX-1-/- neonatal mice in α-MEM (MEM; Corning,

204

NY) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. The

205

contents were strained through a 40-um nylon strainer to remove residual tendon and ligament

206

tissue, and erythrocytes were lysed using 0.2% sodium chloride and neutralized in 1.6% sodium

207

chloride. Following a wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bone marrow cells were

208

differentiated in DMEM that contained 2 mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 10% FCS, and 10% L-

209

cell-conditioned medium for 5-7 days at 37°C with 5% CO2 as described previously (12).

210

MDSCs were cultured in DMEM that contained 2 mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, and 10%

Gladbach). BMDMs, F4/80+, or Ly6B.2+ cells, were cultured with luciferase-expressing E. coli

214

at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. The medium was then

215

replaced with fresh supplemented with gentamicin (100 μg/mL) and the cultures returned to

216

incubation for an additional 4 h. Bacterial luminescence was measured using a Molecular

217

Devices iC3 at 3 and 6 h post-infection (San Jose, CA).

218

Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism

219

software (version 8; La Jolla, CA). Data was tested using the appropriate parametric or

220

nonparametric measures, as indicated in the figure legends. The threshold for statistical

221

significance was set to 0.05.

223

RESULTS

224

IL-27 levels rise during neonatal sepsis. Neonates exhibit elevated levels of IL-27 in the

225

spleen and blood at resting state relative to adults (11, 12). To determine if IL-27 levels continue

226

to rise during infection and how the cytokine may impact the host response, we established a

227

murine model of neonatal sepsis. Neonatal pups were infected with E. coli O1:K1:H7 on day 4 of

228

life. IL-27 gene expression was measured in the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and brains of mice

229

at 10 and 24 h following infection. These time points were chosen to span a critical window in

230

the experimental model. These time points were chosen to span a critical window during

231

infection. IL-27 gene expression varied with different tissues (Fig. 1A-B). While some infected

232

pups expressed increased levels of IL-27p28 and EBI3 transcripts in all tissues examined, in

233

several tissues, there were some pups that did not increase IL-27 gene expression (Fig. 1A-B). At

234

the earlier 10 h time point, the most consistent increases in IL-27p28 and EBI3 expression were

235

observed in the lungs, kidneys, and spleen of infected neonates (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the latter

236

was the site of the greatest magnitude of increase in IL-27 expression (Fig. 1). At 24 h post-

237

infection, more pups increased expression of IL-27 genes in all tissues except the liver; however,

238

there were still some animals that maintained lower expression levels (Fig. 1B). To further

239

analyze IL-27 systemically during infection, serum concentrations were measured by

240

electrochemiluminescent immunoassay on days 1 and 2 post-infection. As shown in Figure 1C,

241

IL-27 increased in circulation and peaked following the first day of infection in neonatal mice.

242

While the mean IL-27 levels increased significantly more than three-fold, the population

243

separated into higher and lower expressers similar to the gene expression data (Fig. 1C). A three-

244

fold increase in IL-27 levels was maintained in infected pups relative to controls at day 2 post-

245

infection, but at reduced overall magnitude (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that although IL-

246

27 levels are higher at baseline in neonates relative to older populations, the levels continue to

247

rise further during infection. Furthermore, the infected population of neonates at 24 h includes

248

those expressing IL-27 genes and producing cytokine at higher levels, as well as those that better

249

control IL-27 production. This could have implications on the progression and outcome of the

250

infection.

251

Gr-1+ and F4/80+ cells are the most abundant IL-27 producers. We have previously

252

shown that MDSCs and macrophages are the dominant cellular sources of IL-27 in neonatal mice

253

in the absence of infection (11, 12). To determine cell types that contribute to the rising IL-27

254

levels during infection, we profiled cells in the blood and spleens by immunofluorescent labeling

255

and flow cytometry. Both tissues are primary sites of infection and disseminated bacteria, as well

256

as compartments with a significant population of myeloid cells. Our analysis evaluated IL-27

257

production in cells positive for Gr-1, F4/80, CD11c, and CD115. In the spleen and the blood, Gr-

258

1+ cells were the most abundant cell type that produced IL-27 followed by a significant

259

contribution from F4/80+ cells at 10 (Figs. 2A and B, 3A and B) and 24 h (Figs. 2A and D, 3A

260

and D, S1, S2) post-infection. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the frequency of any IL-

261

27-producing cell type in infected pups relative to controls in the spleen or the blood (Figs. 2, 3,

262

S1, and S2). However, the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of IL-27 signal, indicative of the

263

amount of IL-27 protein per cell, was increased in the spleen at 10 h in cells expressing all

264

myeloid markers examined (Fig. 2C). CD115+ cells were associated with a substantial increase

265

of nearly 100% during infection (Fig. 2C). Increased IL-27 expression was maintained at a

266

significant level in CD11c+ cells at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2E). Increased production in Gr-1+

267

and F4/80+ cells at 24 h was trending toward and nearly statistically significant (Fig. 2E). In the

268

blood, only CD115+ and F4/80+ cells increased IL-27 production at either time point during

269

infection, although these changes did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3C and E). This

analysis demonstrates that in the blood and spleen myeloid cells positive for Gr-1 and F4/80 are

271

the most abundant producers of IL-27, while cells expressing all myeloid markers examined in

272

the spleen likely contribute to the elevated IL-27 levels observed in infected neonates.

273

IL-27 promotes mortality and poor weight gain during neonatal sepsis. We further

274

investigated the impact of elevated IL-27 levels on survival during neonatal sepsis. Mice

275

deficient for WSX-1 (KO) in the C57BL/6 background do not express a functional IL-27

276

receptor and cannot respond to the cytokine. Morbidity and mortality were monitored over 4

277

days of parallel infection in KO and wild-type (WT) mice. A striking improvement in survival

278

was observed in the absence of IL-27 signaling (Fig. 4A). Infected pups gained weight at a level

279

comparable to uninfected controls in the KO group (Fig. 4B). In contrast, infected WT pups

280

lagged significantly behind control pups in weight gain, an indication of morbidity (Fig. 4B).

281

When the change in weight was expressed relative to the control pups in each group, a highly

282

significant improvement in weight gain was evident in WSX-1-/- neonates (Fig. 4C). This has

283

important implications in human neonatal sepsis. The highest level of serum IL-27 at 24 h post

284

infection also correlates with a critical time period in disease progression (Fig. 1C and 4A). Pups

285

that remain viable through 2 days most frequently remain viable through a 4 day infection (Fig.

286

4A). As such, the day 2 post-infection population is enriched for mice that are likely to remain

287

viable through the duration of infection and may represent some survivor bias. Although we

288

cannot definitively show that pups deceased at day 1 or pups viable at day 1 and deceased at day

289

2 had higher circulating levels of IL-27, the trends in IL-27 gene expression, serum levels, and

290

mortality suggest the possibility that IL-27 levels are maintained at lower concentration in

291

neonatal animals most likely to survive the infection (Fig. 1 and 4A). Collectively, these results

292

indicate that IL-27 interferes with a protective host response.

determine if improved survival in WSX-/- mice is consistent with improved control of bacteria,

295

we evaluated burdens in WT and KO mice 24 h post-infection. In the absence of IL-27 signaling,

296

neonatal pups exhibited improved control of bacteria in the blood and all peripheral tissues

297

examined (Fig. 5). To further explore mechanisms responsible for improved control of bacteria

298

in WSX-1-/- pups, we evaluated the ability of individual phagocytes to clear E. coli in vitro. The

299

myeloid-restricted marker Ly6B.2 is highly expressed on neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes,

300

and some populations of macrophages (40). Ly6B.2+ cells and bone marrow-derived

301

macrophages (BMDMs) from WSX-1-/- mice eliminated E. coli with increased efficiency early

302

during infection (Fig. 5B and C). Similar results were obtained with F4/80+ cells isolated from

303

WT and WSX-1 KO spleens (data not shown). TNF-α levels were lower in Ly6B.2+ cells from

304

WSX-1-/- pups during in vitro infection and marginally higher in BMDMs at 6 h only (Fig. 5D

305

and E). Similar results were observed for IL-6 (data not shown). Improved bacterial clearance in

306

WSX-1-/- phagocytes in the absence of consistently higher levels of TNF-α, suggests that killing

307

of bacteria is independent of proinflammatory cytokine production and may be a direct result of

308

IL-27 signaling. We have previously reported that IL-27 opposes lysosomal acidification and

309

trafficking in human macrophages with consequences to control of intracellular and extracellular

310

bacterial growth (26, 27, 30, 31).

311

We next wanted to examine the kinetics of bacterial clearance in real time with a focus on

312

the critical early phase of the infection. We infected WT and KO pups with luciferase-expressing

313

E. coli, and longitudinally imaged individual mice over a 24-hour period. Consistent with CFU

314

counts in harvested tissues, there was a robust difference in luminescent signal from KO pups.

315

As a result, WT and KO mice could not be analyzed on the same luminescence scale. The drastic

316

difference in luminescence resulted in oversaturation of signal in WT mice placed on the KO

317

scale (Fig. S3A). Conversely, there was an absence of signal in KO mice placed on the WT scale

318

at 10 and 24 h post-infection, further demonstrating the significant improvement in bacterial

319

burdens in pups that cannot respond to IL-27 (Fig. 6A). Peak luminescent signal was observed at

320

10 h post-infection in KO pups, indicating that bacterial replication was controlled at this point in

321

the infection (Fig. 6B and S3B). In contrast, the luminescence measured at 10 h in WT pups was

322

increased relative to KO pups and continued to increase through 24 h (Fig. 6B and S3B). The

323

final signal intensity at 24 h was nearly four orders of magnitude higher in WT pups (Fig. 6B,

324

6C, and S3B). This real time imaging analysis also uncovered the brain as a site for high levels

325

of bacteria in WT animals (Fig. 6C and S4). This finding was not unexpected since E. coli K1,

326

including our strain, is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis (41, 42). However, the magnitude

327

of difference between WT and KO pups was striking. In the absence of IL-27 signaling, there
15

328

was a significant reduction in luminescent signal and CFUs in the brain (Fig. 6C and S4).

329

Overall, the change in luminescence amongst mice correlated with actual CFUs in tissues and

330

blood of WT and KO mice following imaging at 24 h (Fig. 6C).

331

WSX-1-/- mice exhibit reduced levels of inflammation during infection.

Failure to

332

control bacterial replication promotes excessive and pathological inflammation during sepsis. As

333

such, we evaluated gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the spleens following

334

one day of parallel infection in WT and KO neonates. This time point was chosen to evaluate

335

pups during the critical phase; later time points would fail to include pups that succumb to

336

infection and enrich the data set with findings from animals that exhibit improved outcomes.

337

Gene expression levels were expressed relative to uninfected controls for WT and KO mice

338

separately. WT levels of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 increased robustly in WT pups following

339

infection, while TNF-α and IL-6 expression were significantly reduced in WSX-1-/- pups (Fig.

340

7A). Although there was a trend of reduced IL-1 expression in KO pups, this finding did not

341

reach statistical significance (Fig. 7A). The levels of serum cytokines followed a similar pattern

342

(Fig. 7B). IL-6 levels increased dramatically in infected WT pups and were maintained at a level

343

two orders of magnitude lower in KO pups, while TNF-α and IL-1 levels were reduced

344

approximately ten-fold (Fig. 7B). IL-6 levels are increased in patients with infectious

345

complications and used clinically to provide a quantitative assessment of sepsis severity (43-45).

346

Additionally, IL-6 levels correlate with the mortality rate in septic patients (46). The striking

347

difference in IL-6 serum concentrations are reflective of peak illness in WT mice and a condition

348

that is improved in mice that do not respond to IL-27 (47, 48).

DISCUSSION

351

We have established elevated levels of the immune suppressive cytokine IL-27 at resting

352

state in neonates, and we further demonstrate here that those levels continue to rise in most

353

neonatal pups following infection that leads to sepsis. Our data regarding IL-27 serum levels are

354

consistent with related findings in septic adult humans. Adult septic patients exhibit increased

355

levels of IL-27 transcripts in whole blood and higher levels of serum cytokine (49). However, the

356

absence of IL-27 data prior to infection limits our understanding of whether septic individuals

357

are predisposed to higher IL-27 levels that constitute a risk factor for infection, or are elevated as

358

a consequence of infection. Our model addresses this question specifically in neonates with

359

littermates from inbred mice. Our findings have both parallels and contrasts with adult mice that

360

become septic following caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) for which there is IL-27-related

361

data. In these models, splenic IL-27 transcripts rise early peaking at 6-12 h, and protein levels are

362

high in serum at 24 h (49-51). The greatest abundance of IL-27p28 transcripts at 6 h was found

363

in the spleen and lungs (49-51). Our analysis identified the greatest increase in IL-27p28 and

364

EBI3 transcripts during early infection in the lungs and kidneys of septic neonates. Later in the

365

infection at 24 h, IL-27 transcripts were more widely increased across different tissues. In

366

contrast to our neonatal data, adult mice maintain high levels of serum IL-27 through 72 h (49).

367

Peak IL-27 serum levels at 24 h during neonatal infection may be influenced by the nature of the

368

model and critical window for survival. We are the first to profile IL-27-producing cells in the

369

blood and tissues during septic infection of any age group. Bosmann and colleagues depleted

370

macrophages by clodronate treatment and observed a significant decline in IL-27 in the blood

371

during endotoxic shock (51). Our analysis of IL-27-producing myeloid cells in the spleen and

372

blood revealed Gr-1+ and F4/80+ cells as the most abundant source of cytokine. Neither of these
17

373

surface markers is exclusive to a particular cell type. Gr-1 is expressed on MDSCs, some

374

monocyte and macrophage populations, and at a high level on granulocytes (52-54). We recently

375

described MDSCs as a significant source of IL-27 (12), and it is tempting to speculate that these

376

cells are a significant source of rising levels during infection. F4/80 is expressed on monocytes,

377

macrophages, and eosinophils (55, 56). An unexpected finding was that the frequency of these

378

cells was not increased in septic pups. However, the mean fluorescent intensity of IL-27+ cells

379

demonstrated that some cells elevated their level of cytokine production at different times during

380

infection. This was true of all myeloid populations examined in the spleen. The increased IL-27

381

level in CD115+ cells was especially dramatic at 10 h post-infection. Our cellular profiling

382

focused on myeloid cells, which are considered the dominant cellular sources of IL-27 (57).

383

However, we cannot rule out other cellular sources that make a contribution to the overall levels

384

of IL-27 produced during infection. Endothelial and epithelial cells have been reported to express

385

both IL-27 subunits (15, 57). Contributions from these cells may help to explain the high levels

386

of IL-27 expression observed in our model in the kidney, a tissue with extensive vasculature.

387

The presence of IL-27 in infected neonates in our system correlates with a significant

388

increase in bacterial burdens and mortality. We have previously reported that IL-27 interferes

389

with lysosomal acidification and trafficking in macrophages. This promotes increased growth of

390

intracellular and extracellular pathogens (11, 27, 30, 31). Similarly, we recently reported that

391

MDSC-derived IL-27 opposes control of E. coli by macrophages (12). In this report, we

392

demonstrated improved clearance of bacteria by Ly6B.2+ myeloid cells and bone marrow

393

derived macrophages from WSX-1-/- pups. It is likely that the previously reported influence of

394

IL-27 on lysosomal activity is directly responsible for enhanced killing of E. coli shown here

395

(30, 31). Furthermore, since survival from sepsis in murine neonates does not depend on an
18

396

intact adaptive immune system (58), the improved innate immune cell mediated clearance of

397

bacteria in the absence of IL-27 is likely critical to the improved mortality in those neonatal

398

pups. Lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in WSX-1-deficient neonates during infection is

399

consistent with reduced bacterial burdens. Bacteria and bacterial-derived products drive the

400

pathological inflammatory response during sepsis. Less inflammation in the absence of IL-27

401

may seem counterintuitive given many literature precedents, but our results suggest that the

402

direct influence of IL-27 on bacterial killing by phagocytes is the dominant mechanism that

403

dictates outcomes during neonatal sepsis. This implies that the greater numbers of circulating

404

bacteria in WT pups drives an enhanced inflammatory response due to this negative influence of

405

IL-27 on phagocyte clearance. Similarly, reduced concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and

406

chemokines were found in the blood in adult mice given an IL-27 neutralizing antibody during

407

endotoxic shock and in the lungs of WSX-1-/- adult mice during a CLP-induced impairment of

408

secondary bacterial challenge (49, 51). Fang and colleagues demonstrated that IL-27

409

neutralization reduced pulmonary inflammation in a mouse model of CLP-induced lung injury

410

(59). It is also important to consider a possible effect of IL-27 on endothelial cells. IL-27 has

411

been implicated in the endothelial dysfunction that occurs during cardiovascular pathology

412

central to atherosclerosis by stimulating inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression (60).

413

Furthermore, IL-27 increased production of IL-6 and an inflammatory chemokine cascade in

414

human endothelial cells (61, 62). This highlights the double-edge sword nature of IL-27. IL-27

415

has also been shown to activate an inflammatory response and suppress IL-10 production in

416

monocytes (32). These cells would be expected to be significant players in the innate immune

417

response during bacterial sepsis.

418

The intravital imaging analysis further supports the conclusion that IL-27 opposes

419

bacterial clearance and allowed us to observe the rapid progression of dissemination that occurs

420

in WT pups. To our knowledge, this is the first time bacterial sepsis has been imaged intravitally

421

in neonatal mice. To this point, studies on sepsis in the context of LPS, group B streptococci, or

422

E. coli in neonates have utilized confocal imaging of fixed tissue sections for analysis of

423

bacterial load and inflammation (63-65). The presence of bacteria in the brain further validates

424

our model as one that recapitulates findings clinically relevant in human neonates infected with

425

E. coli K1 (41, 42). Our study represents a novel approach to understanding bacterial

426

dissemination in a neonatal model relative to the host response, and drives home a direct

427

association between IL-27 and severity of infection.

428

Improved infection control in adult mice lacking EBI3 or WSX-1 occurs during both M.

429

tuberculosis and P. aeruginosa infections or CLP-induced peritonitis (21, 22, 49, 50). However,

430

this improved infection outcome is in contrast to other studies that demonstrate elimination of

431

IL-27 results in marked susceptibility to infection from Trypanosoma cruzi, Trichuris muris,

432

Leishmania major, and Toxoplasma gondii (18, 20, 23, 66, 67). The differences in infection

433

outcome relative to IL-27 suggests a microbe and Th1 vs Th2-dependent mechanism of

434

immunity, as well as a potential threshold of IL-27 production necessary to modulate proper

435

immunity. Although IL-27 may serve a beneficial role in the balance of inflammatory response,

436

in different infectious contexts, over or underproduction of this cytokine may result in immune

437

dysregulation and pathogen expansion.

438

There were some limitations to our study. Overall, the number of cells that could be

439

obtained from the blood and spleen were limited. As a result, we could not perform more

440

extensive profiling of IL-27-producing cells. As mentioned previously, non-myeloid cells may

441

contribute to the total IL-27 levels and may even be undervalued in that regard. Additionally, we

442

have not developed an approach that allows for blood sampling from viable neonates. As such,

443

we were unable to follow each pup for IL-27 levels and subsequent bacterial burdens or viability

444

versus mortality. The technical ability to perform this level of analysis would further strengthen

445

our conclusions.

446

In summary, our results suggest that elevated levels of IL-27 early in life predispose to

447

impaired control of pathogen burden further compounded by continued increases in circulating

448

levels of IL-27 during sepsis. These findings have enormous translational potential. On the

449

diagnostic front, IL-27 levels in circulation may predict susceptibility to septic infection and

450

related outcomes. Similarly, IL-27 levels may predict outcomes and guide initiation of antibiotic

451

therapy in neonates that appear ill. Indeed, IL-27 has been proposed as a biomarker for neonatal

452

sepsis (37). IL-27 antagonism may also offer therapeutic potential. Our results predict reducing

453

IL-27 levels will promote bacterial clearance, improve host response, and reduce mortality. This

454

approach may have prophylactic value for populations at increased risk in addition to a post-

455

infection therapy. Currently, the only available treatment options to combat bacterial sepsis are

456

antibiotics and supportive care (68). IL-27 may represent a targeted adjunctive therapy to

457

augment the efficacy of antibiotics to improve survival and infection-related outcomes in

458

neonates.

(A) Neonatal C57BL/6 (WT) and WSX-1-/- (KO) mice were subcutaneously inoculated with a

756

target inoculum of ~2x106 CFUs/mouse of E. coli O1:K1:H7 or saline as a control on day 3 or 4

757

of life. Peripheral tissues (spleen, liver, kidney) and blood were collected at 24 h post-infection

758

and bacteria enumerated by standard plate counts. Colony forming units (CFUs)/mL for

759

individual animals and experimental group means are shown for two combined experiments.

760

Statistical significance in the 95% confidence interval was determined using a Mann-Whitney

761

test; exact p-values shown. (B, D) Ly6B.2+ cells were isolated from the spleens of C57BL/6

762

(WT) and WSX-1-/- (KO) neonatal mice. (C, E) Macrophages were derived from bone marrow

763

progenitors obtained from C57BL/6 (WT) and WSX-1-/- (KO) neonatal mice. (B-E) Cells were

764

seeded in 96-well plates, and infected with luciferase-expressing E. coli O1:K1:H7 at an MOI of

765

50. After 1 h, the media was replaced with fresh that contained gentamicin (100 μg/mL). (B, C)

766

Luminescence (RLU) was measured at 3 and 6 h post-infection. (D, E) Culture supernatants

767

were collected at the indicated time and TNF-α measured by ELISA. (B-E) Mean findings ± SE

768

for an individual experiment representative of multiple are shown. Statistical significance in the

769

95% confidence interval was determined using a two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple

770

comparisons test; exact p-values shown.

789

Spleens were harvested 1 day post-infection and RNA isolated. The expression of TNF-α, IL-1,

790

and IL-6 were determined relative to controls by real time PCR. Individual animal findings and

791

group means are shown for two combined experiments. Statistical significance in the 95%

792

confidence interval was determined using individual t tests; exact p-values shown. (B) Blood was

793

collected from mice at day 1 post-infection and serum levels of the indicated cytokine were

794

measured by multiplex immunoassay. Individual animal findings and group means are shown for
