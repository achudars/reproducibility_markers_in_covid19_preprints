Abstract

22

Alternative ribosome subunit proteins are prevalent in the genomes of diverse bacterial species but

23

their functional significance is controversial. Attempts to study microbial ribosomal heterogeneity

24

have mostly relied on comparing wild-type strains with mutants in which subunits have been

25

deleted, but this approach does not allow direct comparison of alternate ribosome isoforms isolated

26

from identical cellular contexts. Here, by simultaneously purifying canonical and alternative RpsR

27

ribosomes from Mycobacterium smegmatis, we show that alternative ribosomes have distinct

28

translational features compared with their canonical counterparts. Both alternative and canonical

29

ribosomes actively take part in gene translation, although they translate a subset of genes with

30

differential efficiency as measured by ribosome profiling. We also show that alternative ribosomes

31

have a relative defect in initiation complex formation. Our work convincingly confirms the distinct

32

and non-redundant contribution of alternative bacterial ribosomes for adaptation to hostile

33

environments.

34
35

Significance Statement

36

Many organisms, including most bacteria code for multiple paralogues of some ribosomal protein

37

subunits. The relative contribution of these alternative subunits to ribosome function and gene

38

translation is unknown and controversial. Furthermore, many studies on alternative ribosomes have

39

been confounded by isolation of alternative and canonical ribosomes from different strains and/ or

40

different growth conditions, potentially confounding results. Here, we show unequivocally that

41

one form of alternative ribosome from Mycobacterium smegmatis actively engages in gene

42

translation, but its translational profile from an identical cellular context is subtly different from

43

canonical ribosomes. Given the prevalence of alternative ribosomal genes in diverse organisms,

44

our study suggests that alternative ribosomes may represent a further layer of regulation of gene

45

translation.

Introduction

48

Ribosomes are the macromolecular machines that translate the genetic code into functional proteins

49

(1-3). Shortly after their discovery and role in gene translation, the “one gene, one mRNA, one

50

ribosome” hypothesis was proposed (4), but was quickly disproven (5). This led in turn to the

51

“homogeneity hypothesis” for ribosomes: that all ribosomes were identical macromolecules, that

52

would translate all mRNAs with equal efficiency (6). However, observations that ribosome

53

composition varied according to environmental conditions and other variables, immediately

54

challenged the homogeneity hypothesis (7). But until recently, the functional significance of

55

ribosome heterogeneity has not been well understood.

56
57

In eukaryotic systems, there is increasing evidence for the role and importance of ribosomal

58

heterogeneity in fundamental physiology, development and disease, in systems from budding yeast,

59

to organelles and animals (8-11). In particular, specialized ribosomes have been shown to be

60

important for vitamin B12 transport and cell-cycle components (12), hematopoiesis (13) and

61

development (14). Mutations in ribosomal proteins, or haploinsufficiency of their coded genes

62

have been implicated in a number of disorders such as the ribosomopathies (9, 15).

63

understanding of ribosomal heterogeneity in bacteria is less advanced (16). Using high-fidelity

64

mass spectrometry of intact 70S ribosomes from Escherichia coli revealed considerable

65

heterogeneity, such as the presence or absence of the stationary-phase-induced ribosomal-

66

associated protein, SRA (17). Other studies implicating specialized bacterial ribosomes (18, 19)

67

have recently been questioned (20-23). Nonetheless, it is intriguing to speculate that specialized

68

bacterial ribosomes, generated in response to environmental stressors, would result in altered

69

translation, which in turn might allow adaptation to the stressful environment (16).

Our

70
71

Specialized ribosomes could be generated via changes in the stoichiometry of canonical ribosomal

72

components, association of accessory ribosomal proteins, modification of ribosomal rRNA or

73

incorporation of alternative ribosomal subunits, coded by paralogous or homologous genes

74

(reviewed in (9, 24)). Most eukaryotic organisms code for paralogues of ribosomal subunit genes,

75

and around half of sequenced bacterial genomes from one study included at least one ribosomal

76

protein paralogue (25). One well-characterized group of paralogous ribosomal proteins are those

77

that lack cysteine-rich motifs (C-) compared with canonical cysteine-containing homologues (C+).

78

C- paralogues have been described in many bacteria, including mycobacteria (26-28).

79

mycobacteria, the conserved alternative C- ribosomal subunits are coded in a single operon

80

regulated by a zinc uptake regulator (zur), which represses expression in the presence of zinc ions

81

(29), and has led to the suggestion that the function for C-/C+ ribosomal subunit paralogues is to

82

allow for dynamic storage of zinc (30-32). Furthermore, although these alternative mycobacterial

83

ribosomal proteins (AltRPs) have recently been demonstrated to incorporate into assembled

84

ribosomes, it has been suggested that they form non-translating hibernating ribosome complexes

85

due to exclusive association of a hibernation factor with alternative ribosomes (33). Here, we

86

demonstrate convincingly using a fully reconstituted mycobacterial translation system that

87

ribosomes containing the alternative subunit RpsR2 (AltRpsR) actively translate. Furthermore, the

88

translational landscape as measured by ribosome profiling of these alternative mycobacterial

89

ribosomes are distinct from those generated by canonical ribosomes purified from the same cell

90

and are characterized by a 5’ polarity shift suggesting that alternative bacterial ribosomes may

91

provide a further layer of regulation during nutrient stress.

Alternative mycobacterial ribosomes engage in gene translation

95

Mycobacteria encode for several alternative C- ribosomal proteins, four of which are conserved

96

throughout the genus and are encoded within one operon (27, 33) (Fig. 1A). We wished to

97

biochemically characterize alternative ribosome (AltRibo) function by purifying ribosomes

98

containing alternative or canonical subunit proteins.

We chose to C-terminally tag RpsR2

99

(AltRpsR) with 3xFLAG, since of the four alternative ribosome genes within the operon, the C-

100

terminus of RpsR showed the greatest sequence variation (Fig. 1A), and we reasoned that it

101

therefore was most likely to tolerate tagging. Immunoprecipitation of C-terminally-FLAGx3-

102

tagged alternative RpsR2 co-precipitated all ribosome subunits (Table S1 and Fig. S1A, B),

103

suggesting that purification of alternative and canonical ribosomes could be achieved by tagging

104

the two isoforms of RpsR.

105
106

To investigate alternative (AltRibo) and canonical (CanRibo) RpsR ribosome function within the

107

same cellular context, we constructed a strain of M. smegmatis in which both RpsR subunits had

108

affinity tags inserted at their C-terminus, at their native loci on the mycobacterial chromosome (Fig.

109

1B and see Methods). In keeping with prior studies (28, 34), growth of mycobacteria in relatively

110

zinc-deplete Sauton’s medium upregulated AltRpSR expression and supplementation with zinc

111

restored CanRpsR expression (Fig. S2). We grew the dual-tagged M. smegmatis strain in both zinc-

112

replete and relatively zinc-deplete conditions, purified ribosomes and subjected them to subunit

113

profiling. Under both conditions, translating ribosomes (polysome fraction) could clearly be

114

identified (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting against AltRpsR-FLAG and CanRpsR-HA confirmed that

115

zinc depletion upregulated AltRpsR expression. Importantly, a significant proportion of polysomes

116

isolated from growth in zinc-depleted medium were AltRibos (Fig. 1C), suggesting that AltRibos

117

are resident on translating polysomes and supporting their active role in gene translation. We

118

further subjected affinity purified AltRibos and CanRibos to biochemical analysis in a

119

mycobacterial cell-free translation system (34). AltRibos were able to synthesise di-peptides at

120

similar efficiency to CanRibos (Fig. 1D), unequivocally confirming that AltRibos are capable of

121

gene translation.

122
123

We also constructed a strain in which the alternative subunit operon was knocked out, ∆ARP. This

124

strain grew poorly with zinc depletion (Fig. S3), confirming prior results. We wondered whether

125

this might be because under conditions of zinc depletion, CanRibos are less proficient at gene

126

translation? We performed subunit profiling on both wild-type and ∆ARP M. smegmatis, scraped

127

from agar plates grown both on standard medium (7H10-agar) and plates supplemented with the

128

specific zinc chelator N,N,N,N’-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) at a

129

concentration of TPEN that did not interfere with bacterial growth (Fig. S4). Although the

polysome fraction was preserved in both strains when isolated from standard growth conditions,

alternative-RpsR ribosomes are likely to be the major translating fraction under those conditions.

∆ARP was significantly smaller under zinc depletion (Fig. 1E),

134
135

Alternative mycobacterial ribosomes have distinct translational profiles compared with

canonical ribosomes

137

The dual-RpsR-tagged strain (Strain A) permitted us to interrogate selective ribosome translation

138

profiles from the same cellular population, which would eliminate potential differences due to

139

mRNA abundance or other confounding factors (35, 36). We grew the strains in relatively zinc-

140

replete conditions, which allowed cultures to grow to greater density for ribosome isolation prior

141

to ribosome profiling (35, 37-39). Under these conditions, the majority of ribosomes were

142

CanRibos. To exclude the formal possibility that observed differences were due to the use of the

143

affinity tags, we generated a second dual-tagged strain in which the affinity tags were swapped

144

(Strain B – Fig. 2A). Both strains were similarly regulated by zinc (27, 33) (Fig. S2), suggesting

145

they had comparable physiology.

146
147

Position analysis of aligned reads revealed a clear 3 nucleotide periodicity (Fig. S5), confirming

148

that reads were derived from translating ribosomes for both AltRibos and CanRibos, and showed a

149

high degree of reproducibility between replicates (Fig. S6A). Comparison of translational profiles

150

confirmed that CanRibo-derived reads were highly correlated with total ribosome input, consistent

151

with the fact that the majority of ribosomes under the tested condition were CanRibos. However,

152

reads generated from AltRibos were less well correlated, suggesting that translational profiles from

153

AltRibos were distinct from CanRibos (Fig. 2B). Regardless of affinity tag, CanRibo- and AltRibo-

154

derived reads were highly correlated with each other when comparing translational efficiency

155

profiles generated by Strain A and Strain B (Fig. 2C), following correction for mRNA expression

156

(Fig. S6B). These data together strongly support that AltRibos and CanRibos generate distinct

157

translational landscapes.

158
159

Our data suggested that alternative ribosomes had intrinsic differences in gene translation compared

160

with canonical ribosomes.

161

CanRibo-generated ribosome profile datasets, and compared these with the total ribosome input.

162

Pull-down efficiency of HA-tagged subunits was less efficient than FLAG-tagged subunits.

163

Although this was not an issue in Strain A, where the highly abundant CanRibos were HA-tagged,

164

it meant that the number of reads from the HA-tagged AltRibos from Strain B were lower, and as

165

such, fewer genes were differentially translated (up- or down-) in AltRibos isolated from Strain B.

166

As expected, there were few differences between CanRibos and total ribosomes. By contrast, there

167

were a large number of genes that were translated with either decreased or increased preference by

168

AltRibos compared with total ribosome input (Fig. S7A, B). Of note, there was significant

169

enrichment in under-represented translated genes in AltRibos isolated from Strain A and B. (Fig.

170

S7B, C).

Our analysis of differences in translational profiles between canonical and alternative

mycobacterial ribosomes revealed that for translation of certain genes, there were clear differences

in the distribution of sequencing reads along the gene length between the two samples, for example

for translation of Msmeg_0363 (Fig. 3A). To characterize these differences on a genome-wide

177

basis, we calculated the polarity score to determine the distribution of aligned reads for each coding

178

gene (40). Polarity scores between -1 and 0 represent read accumulation at the 5’ end of the coding

179

region, and between 0 and +1 represent read accumulation at the 3’ end of the coding region (see

180

Methods). Comparing the polarity score of AltRibos with CanRibos and total ribosome input from

181

both Strain A and Strain B, there was a clear polarity shift towards a 5’ read accumulation in

182

alternative ribosomes (Fig. 3B).

183
184

Translation elongation does not proceed at a uniform pace (41-43). We investigated whether

185

alternative and canonical ribosomes differed in codon-reading rates. AltRibos from either Strain

186

A or Strain B showed similar, though not identical codon usage pattern across all 61 sense codons

187

(Fig. 3C, Fig. S8A). Comparing CanRibos with AltRibos with total ribosome input across all

188

coding genes, there were significant differences in codon usage between the two ribosome isoforms

189

in both Strain A and Strain B (Fig. 3D and Fig. S8B). From our analysis of all 61 sense codons in

190

both strains, 12 showed relatively high occupancy in AltRibos compared with total ribosomes, and

191

12 showed relatively low occupancy (Fig. S8C). We wished to determine whether altered codon

192

usage might be associated with the observed polarity differences between AltRibos and CanRibos.

193

We considered the first and last 50 codons of all coding genes and compared the relative abundance

194

of the 12 high- and 12 low-occupancy codons in these regions. For the 12 high occupancy codons,

195

10 were relatively enriched at the 5’ end of coding regions, and for the 12 low occupancy codons,

196

8 were relatively enriched at the 3’ end of coding regions (Fig. 3E), potentially suggesting a

197

mechanism for the observed polarity differences between alternative and canonical ribosomes.

198

Furthermore, although purified AltRibos formed 70S initiation complexes, they appeared to do so

199

at slightly lower efficiency compared with CanRibos (Fig. 3F), suggesting another potential

200

mechanism for the observed 5’ polarity shift. The lower efficiency in 70S initiation complex

201

formation could be due to impaired binding of the initiator tRNA as demonstrated by BODIPY-

202

Met-tRNAfMet binding to the ribosome monitored by increase in BODIPY fluorescence (Fig. 3G).

Discussion

205

Together, our studies demonstrate that alternative mycobacterial ribosomes incorporating C-

206

paralogues are not only competent for translation, but that these alternative ribosomes have distinct

207

translational landscapes compared with their canonical counterparts. Although the ribosome is

208

primarily an RNA machine (2), multiple studies have shown that alterations in ribosomal subunit

209

proteins may have profound impacts on aspects of translation function (12, 36, 44, 45). We

210

leveraged the power of ribosome profiling and affinity purification of specialized ribosomes to

211

show that alternative RpsR mycobacterial ribosomes have altered codon usage compared with

212

ribosomes containing the canonical RpsR paralogue, as well as a relative 5’ polarity shift in

213

translation of open reading frames. It should be noted that due to our tagging and purification

214

strategy, we were primarily comparing RpsR canonical and alternative ribosomes. Although due

215

to their differential expression, we would expect that in high and low zinc environments, alternative

216

and canonical ribosomes would contain mostly the entire canonical or alternative subunit proteins,

217

in environments where expression of all subunits are sustained (such as our experimental

218

conditions), multiple combinations of ‘alternative’ ribosomes could co-exist, and our data are

219

unable to resolve between these. Ribosomal profiling of specialized ribosomes had previously

220

demonstrated specific functions of heterogeneous ribosome populations in stem cells and for the

221

translation of mitochondrial proteins in eukaryotic cells (12, 44). In bacteria, ribosome profiling

222

of trigger factor associated with ribosomes demonstrated the requirement of trigger factor

223

particularly for the translation of outer-membrane proteins in E. coli (36), but ribosome profiling

224

had not been employed for ribosomes incorporating ribosomal protein paralogues.

225
226

There have been relatively few studies of bacterial ribosomal heterogeneity when compared with

227

eukaryotic systems (16). However, there is evidence that ribosomal heterogeneity may be just as

228

pervasive in bacteria as eukaryotes (46, 47). Mycobacteria, for example, have very distinct

229

translational features compared with the model E. coli system (39, 48, 49). Recent structural

230

information about the mycobacterial ribosome identified new ribosomal protein subunits, but these

231

new subunits, bL37 and bS22 were not present in all ribosomes identified by cryo-electron

232

microscopy (34, 50, 51).

233
234

Many diverse bacterial species code for C- ribosomal subunit paralogues (25), but their distinct

235

translational functions, if any, have not been fully characterized. A recent examination of the

236

mycobacterial C- paralogues that are the subject of this study suggested that the C- ribosomes are

237

hibernating and do not actively engage in gene translation (33, 52). Those findings are in

238

contradistinction with our own. By both biochemical analysis and ribosome profiling, our data

239

support a role for translating AltRibos, even under conditions of zinc depletion. Ojha and

240

colleagues suggested an exclusive association of a ribosomal hibernation promoting factor

241

(Msmeg_1878 and named MPY by them) with C- ribosomes under conditions of zinc depletion. It

242

is possible that use of supra-physiological (1mM) zinc in culture medium led to lack of binding of

243

MPY to canonical (C+) ribosomes under those conditions (33).

244

ribosomes from M. smegmatis-∆AltRP (where C- ribosomes would be absent by definition) by

245

standard methods in standard growth medium (Supplementary Table 1, Uniprot accession number

246

A0QTK6) showed association of CanRibos with MPY and demonstration that canonical ribosomes

247

are less competent at polysome formation under zinc depletion (Fig. 1E), as well as a previous

248

study of M. smegmatis grown under conditions where C- ribosomes would not have been

249

predominant (53) suggest that MPY is not exclusively associated with C- ribosomes.

However, our isolation of

250
251

Our data suggest that alternative ribosomes and canonical ribosomes have differences potentially

252

in both translation initiation and codon usage – both of which may contribute to the relative 5’

253

polarity shift of reads in alternative ribosomes. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for

254

observed differences in elongation rates (54). Decoding of modified tRNA bases (42) and

255

differential affinity of specific ribosome isoforms for aminoacyl-tRNAs (41) also contribute to

256

altered rates of gene translation. Of note, RpS18 (of which AltRpsR and CanRpsR are the two

257

mycobacterial isoforms) is part of an mRNA “nest”, which contributes to preinitiation binding of

258

mRNA to the 30S subunit (55), and it is tempting therefore to speculate that differences in RpsR

259

protein sequence may contribute the observed differences in initiation complex formation. Our

260

study reveals not only that alternative mycobacterial ribosomes actively participate in gene

261

translation, they but also provides evidence that gene translation by specialized bacterial ribosomes

262

contribute to environmental adaptation.

Materials and Methods

265
266

Bacterial strains and culture

267

Wild-type M. smegmatis mc2-155 (56) and derived strains were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9

268

media supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween-80, 10% ADS (albumin-dextrose-salt) with

269

appropriate antibiotics or Sauton’s medium (0.05% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2% citric acid,

270

0.005% ferric ammonium citrate, 6% glycerol, 0.4% asparagine, 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4) (27). Zinc

271

sulfate at indicated concentrations was added to Sauton medium as per specific protocols. If not

272

otherwise noted, bacteria were grown and maintained at 37°C with shaking.

274

M. smegmatis AltRP knock-out strain and complemented strain construction

275

In normal conditions (High Zinc), the AltRP operon is not required for growth. A double crossover

276

strategy was used to construct an unmarked AltRP knockout strain as previously described (57).

277

Sequences 1,000bp upstream and downstream of the operon were cloned and ligated into the P2NIL

278

suicide vector. The lacZ and SacB gene were cloned from pGOAL17 and ligated to P2NIL

279

containing upstream and downstream 1,000bp region to generate the AltRP deletion construct. 2μg

selected on LB plates supplemented with 25μg/ml kanamycin and 50μg/ml X-gal. Blue colonies

282

were screened for single crossover recombinants and further verified by PCR. Correctly identified

283

recombinants were further plated on LB plates containing X-gal and 2% sucrose with ten-fold serial

284

dilutions. White colonies were screened for double crossover strains by PCR verification. A correct

285

knock-out strain was further verified by Southern blot and used in subsequent experiments.

286
287

For complementation of the knock-out strain, the upstream 500bp of the coding region for the

288

AltRP operon (presumably incorporating the promoter region) along with the whole AltRP operon

289

was cloned with C-terminal 3xFlag tag to AltRpsR and ligated to pML1342 as a complementation

290

plasmid. The plasmid was transformed to ∆AltRP competent cells and plated on LB plates with

291

50μg/ml hygromycin. Recombinants were further verified by western blot in Sauton medium

292

supplemented with different concentrations of zinc to check the expression from the operon.

Generating endogenous AltRpsR/CanRpsR with different affinity tags strains

295

Upstream 500bp (US500) and downstream 500bp (DS500) of AltRpsR/CanRpsR stop codons were

296

cloned. Different affinity tag sequences (3xFlag/3xHA) fused with different antibiotic expression

Strain A and Strain B were cultured in 7H9 medium to stationary phase (OD600nm≈3) and sub-

312

cultured 1:500 to Sauton medium (zinc-free) supplemented with different concentrations of zinc

313

sulfate. When bacteria reached stationary phase, bacteria were washed and re-suspended in TE

314

buffer. The bacterial suspension was disrupted by beads-beating and lysate centrifuged at 17,950xg,

315

4°C for 5 min. Protein concentration was quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-rad) and same amount

316

of protein were loaded onto 5%/12% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were further transferred onto PVDF

317

membrane (Bio-rad). The membrane was blocked in 4% skim milk at room temperature (RT) for

318

1 h. Primary antibody was diluted 1:2000 and the blot was incubated at 4°C overnight. The

319

membrane was then washed with TBS-T at RT and secondary antibody, diluted, 1:5000 rate and

Subunit profiling of M. smegmatis

324

For liquid culture, M. smegmatis strain was grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium till OD600nm≈1

325

and collected by centrifuge at 4500xg, 4°C for 20 min. For plates, wild type M.smegmatis strain

326

and ∆ARP strain were plated on 7H10 plate or 7H10 plate supplied with 10μM TPEN and bacteria

327

were collected by scraping. The bacterial pellet was washed and re-suspended with polysome

328

buffer (50mM Tris-actate pH=7.2, 12mM MgCl2, 50mM NH4Cl). Bacteria were pulverized by

329

beads beating or French Press, and the lysate were centrifuged at 18500xg, 4°C for 45 min. Cleared

330

lysate were further loaded to a linear sucrose gradient (10%-50%) at Beckman SW41 rotor and

331

centrifuged at 39,000 rpm, 4°C for 5 h. Gradients were fractioned with continuous A 260

Selective ribosome profiling with affinity- purified tagged AltRibosomes

335

Bacterial cultures of dual-tagged Strain A or Strain B were grown till OD600nm≈1 and treated with

336

100μg/ml chloramphenicol for 3 mins to arrest elongating ribosome before harvesting bacteria.

337

Bacterial pellets were collect by centrifuging at 4500xg, 4°C for 10 min. The pellet was washed

338

and re-suspended with ice-cold polysome buffer with minor recipe change. (50mM Tris-actate pH=

339

7.2, 12mM MgCl2, 50mM NH4Cl, 10mM CaCl2 and 100μg/ml chloramphenicol) The suspended

340

bacterial suspension was dropped into liquid nitrogen and smashed into powder. The powder was

341

smashed several times with repeatedly chilling with liquid nitrogen and was further pulverized with

342

beads beating 4 to 5 times with chilling in liquid nitrogen between each step. After centrifugation

343

at 18500xg for 45 min, the cleared lysate was transferred to a new tube supplied with 70U/ml

344

MNase to digest ribosome-unprotected mRNA. The pre-digested lysate was laid over a 1M sucrose

345

cushion and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm, 4°C for 20 h in Beckman 70Ti rotor. After

346

ultracentrifugation, the ribosome pellet was washed and dissolved in polysome buffer. The

347

dissolved ribosome solution was further digested with MNase at 4°C for 1 h. The digested ribosome

348

fraction was incubated with either Flag resin or HA resin at 4°C overnight. After washing of the

349

bound resin, the resin was eluted with 3xFlag/3xHA peptide to isolate the AltRibo (eluate), and the

350

remaining flow-through was confirmed as consisting almost entirely of CanRibos.

351
352

The procedure for building deep sequencing libraries was followed as previously described (38)

353

with minor changes. The detailed protocol is described as below. Ribosome-protected mRNA

354

fragments were extracted by miRNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and size-

355

selected for 26-34nt fragment by marker oligo through 15% TBE-UREA PAGE. The corresponding

356

region was sliced and smashed into pieces and soaked in 400μl RNA gel extraction buffer (300mM

357

sodium acetate pH 5.5, 1mM EDTA and 0.25% SDS) and rotated at room temperature overnight.

358

RNA was precipitated with 1.5μl GlycoBlue and 500μl isopropanol. The RNA was

359

dephosphorylated with 1μl T4 PNK at 37°C for 1 h. RNA was extracted by isopropanol

360

precipitation. Samples were then ligated with 0.5μl Universal miRNA cloning linker and 1.0μl T4

361

RNA ligase (truncated) at room temperature overnight. The ligation product was purified by

362

isopropanol precipitation and visulized by 15% TBE-UREA PAGE. After slicing the corresponding

363

ligated mRNA fragment, the samples were then subjected to reverse transcription with

364

supersciptase III and RT-Primer. After incubating the reaction at 48°C, 30 min, the RNA template

365

was further hydrolyzed with 2μl 1M NaOH at 98°C for 20 min. The RT product was precipitated

366

with isopropanol and size-selcted with 15% TBE-UREA PAGE. The corresponding region was

367

sliced and soaked in 400μl DNA gel extraction (300mM NaCl, 10mM Tris pH=8, and 1mM EDTA)

368

and rotated at RT overnight. The cDNA was purified by isopropanol precipitation and circularized

369

with 1μl CircLigase and incubated at 60°C for 1 h. The circularized cDNA template was incubated

370

with 1μl 10mM Biotinylated rRNA subtraction oligo pool mix. The Oligo sequence was adopted

371

from another study (39) with additional oligos newly designed according to our preliminary

372

ribosome profiling data (Table S2). The mixture was denatured for 90s at 100°C and then annealed

373

at 0.1°C /sec to 37°C. This was then incubated at 37°C for 15 min. 30μl streptavidin C1 DynaBeads

374

was added to the mixture and incubated for 15 min at 37°C with mixing at 1000 rpm. Then the

375

mixture was placed on a magnetic rack to isolate the beads, the supernatant was transferred to a

376

new tube and cDNA purifed by isopropanol precipitation. The subsequent cDNA template was

377

used for library amplification with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polyermase for 12-14 cycles. PCR

378

products were purifed from 8% TBE PAGE gel. The corresponding bands were sliced and soaked

379

in DNA gel extraction buffer and rotated at room temperature overnight. The PCR products were

380

purified by isopropanol precipitation and the concentration and quality were measured with Agilent

381

2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraires were sequenced on the illumina X-ten sequencer.

384

Bacterial cultures (~30L) were grown to around OD600nm≈1 and bacterial pellets were collected by

385

centrifugation at 4500xg, 20 min, 4°C. Pellet was washed and re-suspended in polysome buffer.

386

Bacteria were disrupted by French Press and centrifuged at 18500xg, 4°C for 1h to collect

387

supernatant. MNase was added to the cleared lysate at a concentration of 70U/ml and digested at

388

4°C overnight. The digested lysate was loaded onto 1M sucrose cushions and centrifuged at 30,000

389

rpm, 4°C for 20 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the ribosome pellet

390

washed with polysome buffer and dissolved in polysome buffer with gentle shaking at 4°C. The

391

crude ribosome suspension was further digested with MNase at 4°C overnight. After secondary

392

digestion, the ribosome preparation was dialyzed against HEPES-polymix buffer (59, 60). The

393

ribosome preparation was incubated with anti-Flag M2 beads 4°C overnight. After binding with

394

M2 beads, the flow-through was collected as CanRibo and AltRibo was collected by eluting with

395

Flag peptide. Each fraction, comprising total Ribo, CanRibo (flow through) and AltRibo (Eluate),

396

were probed by Western blotting for quality check and purity prior to further analysis.

In vitro 70S initiation complex formation

399

Initiation complex was formed by incubating 70S ribosome variants as described above (0.2 μM),

400

[3H]fMet-tRNAfMet (0.5 μM), XR7mRNA (AUG-UAA) (0.5 μM), initiation factors (0.5 μM) and

401

GTP (1 mM) at 37°C for 15 min in HEPES-polymix buffer (59). The reactions were thereafter

402

filtered through BA-85 nitrocellulose membranes and washed with 10ml of ice-cold HEPES-

403

polymix buffer (pH 7.5). The radioactivity retained on the filter was measured in a Beckman

a 590 nm cut-off filter. The time course data was obtained by averaging 3-5 individual traces and

411

fitted with single exponential model.

413

In vitro di-peptide assay

414

For Met-Leu dipeptide formation, an initiation complex was formed with mycobacterial 70S

415

ribosome variants (1-5 μM), AUG-CUG-UAA XR7 mRNA (20 μM) and [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet (1

416

μM), initiation factors (2 μM) at 37°C. In parallel, an elongation mix was prepared which contained

417

M. smegmatis EF-Tu (20 μM), EF-Ts (20 μM), tRNALeu (100 μM), Leu amino acid (0.5 mM), Leu-

418

tRNA synthetase (1unit/μL) and GTP (1mM) at 37°C. Both initiation complex and elongation mix

419

containing energy pump ATP (1mM), EP (10 mM), PK and MK (Sigma). The reaction was started

420

by mixing equal volumes of the initiation complex and elongation complex at 37°C and was

421

quenched after 10 s by adding 17% formic acid. The peptides were isolated from the ribosome

422

complex by KOH treatment and further analyzed by HPLC equipped with a radioactivity detector.

423
424

Read preparation and alignment

425

The M. smegmatis mc2-155 reference genome assembly (ASM1500v1) downloaded from Ensembl

426

Bacteria Release 32 (https://bacteria.ensembl.org/) was used for all analyses. For RNAseq, we

427

performed quality control and trimmed adaptors using the FastQC and FASTX-Toolkit. For

428

ribosome profiling, after quality control and adaptor removal, reads less than 25nt long were

429

discarded and longer than 36nt were trimmed to 36nt. Next, ribosome profile and RNAseq reads

430

that aligned to rRNA and tRNA were removed using bowtie2 (61). We aligned the remaining reads

431

to the genome using bowtie2 with “sensitive-local” option. The mapped reads were normalized to

432

reads per kilobase million (RPKM) using total number of mapped reads.

433

A-site assignment

435

For each read, the A-site’s position was inferred by taking the first nucleotide that was 12nt

436

upstream of the 3’end of the read (62). Based on this, we generated a signal track of A-sites for all

437

transcripts. ORFs that had been annotated in the reference were denoted as annotated ORFs

438

(aORFs).

439
440

Polarization of aligned Ribosome Profile reads

441

The polarity score was calculated on the basis of aligned A-site signal track by adapting a previous

442

method (40). The observed polarized reads from AltRibos were not due to ambigous artifacts that

443

might be caused by peaks around the start/stop codons, since the same result was observed whether

444

or not the first and last 15nt of the coding region were included in the analysis. aORFs with more

445

than 50 reads in coding sequences were plotted. In this study, we calculated the polarity score under

446

AltRibo, CanRibo as well as total ribosome population. Here we defined the concept of polarity

447

shift by taking total ribosomes as the background input and subtracting the polarity score of

448

background from the score of AltRibo-enriched/CanRibo-enriched populations.

449
450

Differential ribosome codon reading

451

The calculation of codon occupancy was adapted from a previous method (41). For each aORF,

452

only in-frame ribosome profiling fragments (RPFs) were included to study the frequencies of all

453

codons. For each coding gene, its codon density was calculated by normalizing the observed RPF

454

frequencies by the total frequcies of codons. Later we included genes with at least 100 RPFs as

455

input and obtained an averaged codon density for each codon. Here we denoted 𝑇𝑐odon𝑖 as the

456

averaged codon occupancy of 𝑐odon𝑖 for AltRibo or CanRibo population while 𝑅𝑐odon𝑖 as the

457

averaged codon occupancy of 𝑐odon𝑖 for reference population, in this case, the total ribosomes. To

458

better clarify the difference between AltRibo and CanRibo population, we further defined codon

459

occupancy shift as follows:

460
461

𝑐odon occupancy shift 𝑐odon𝑖 = (𝑇𝑐odon𝑖 − 𝑅𝑐odon𝑖 )/𝑅𝑐odon𝑖 .

462
463

Significantly different codon usage was detected by comparing the codon density of all studied

464

aORFs under test conditions (AltRibo/CanRibo) against the corresponding density under the

465

reference condition (total ribosome input) (t-test p value <0.05 and shift > 0.05 or shift < -0.05).

466

Additionaly, for each individual aORF we correlated its codon density from AltRibo/CanRibo

467

population with that from total ribosome population (Pearson correlation was used in this study).

468
469

Differential codon abundance

470

In this study, we used the concept of codon abundance to measure the occurance of specific codons

471

in the 50 codons within the 5’ or 3’ of the coding region. The calculation of codon abundance

472

followed a previous study (63). To better demonstrate the difference, the final results were

473

presented in the following form:

474
475

Slope𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑖 =

𝑐odon abundance𝑐odon𝑖,3′−𝑐odon abundance𝑐odon𝑖,5′
𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑏𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑐odon𝑖,5′

476
477

Slope𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑖 represents the slope of 𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑖 in which 𝑐odon abundance𝑐odon𝑖,3′ represents the

478

codon abundance of 𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑖 in the 3’ region while 𝑐odon aboundance𝑐odon𝑖,5′ represents the

479

codon abundance of 𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑜𝑛𝑖 in the 5’ region.

480
481

Differential translation analysis

482

Since AltRibo, CanRibo and total ribosomes were collected from the same population of bacteria,

483

to identify differential translated genes we used edgeR on the corresponding ribosome profiling

484

datasets (64). During analysis, replicates were included. Differentially translated genes were

486

value < 0.05. In this study, the datasets of total ribosome were treated as the control and compared

against AltRibo or CanRibo to identify differentially translated genes.

Figure 3. Alternative ribosomes have 5’ read accumulation and a relative initiation defect compared with canonical ribosomes.
(A) Normalized reads of each ribosome input for the gene Msmeg_0363 were plotted along gene length using IGV software (see Methods). Reads
from AltRibos show a clear 5’ accumulation compared with reads generated from CanRibos or total ribosomal input. (B) Shifts in polarity scores for
the entire genome generated from selective AltRibo and CanRibo reads from Strains A and B – blue dots represent shifts calculated from AltRibos and
gray squares represent shifts calculated from CanRibos. The overall polarity score shifts are illustrated as smoothed curves above and to the right of
the plot. A negative score indicates 5’ read accumulation and a positive score indicates a 3’ read accumulation. (C) The relative A-site codon
occupancy for all 61 sense codons for AltRibos and CanRibos in Strain A compared with total ribosome input. (D) Cumulative probability and violin
(inset) plots for correlation between codon occupancy for AltRibos and CanRibos compared with total ribosome input from Strain A. *** p<0.001 by
Student’s t-test. (E) The relative codon frequencies of the 5’ 50 codons and 3’ 50 codons for each ORF were analyzed. Comparing AltRibo high
occupancy codons (left panel) and low occupancy codons (right panel) with non-significantly enriched codons, there was significant enrichment of
high occupancy codons at the beginning of ORFs, and a trend towards enrichment of low occupancy codons at the end of ORFs by chi-squared test.
(F) The extent of initiation complex formation by AltRibos compared with CanRibos measured by retention of 3H-fMet count on a nitrocellulose filter.
(G) The kinetics and extent of binding of the initiator tRNA to the mRNA programmed 70S ribosome (AltRibo vs CanRibo) followed with BODIPY
fluorescence.
