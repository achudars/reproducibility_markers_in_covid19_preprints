embryo peri-implantation development from blastocyst to early post-implantation

32

stages by using an in vitro coculture system, and profiled the transcriptome of

33

individual trophoblast cells from these embryos. We revealed the genetic networks

34

regulating peri-implantation trophoblast development. While determining when

35

trophoblast differentiation happens, our bioinformatic analysis identified T-box

36

transcription factor 3 (TBX3) as a key regulator for the differentiation of

37

cytotrophoblast into syncytiotrophoblast. The function of TBX3 in trophoblast

38

differentiation is then validated by a loss-of-function experiment. In conclusion, our

39

results provided a valuable resource to study the regulation of trophoblasts

40

development and differentiation during human peri-implantation development.

Background

46

The placenta is the interface between the fetal and maternal circulation, and plays

47

an essential role in supporting fetus development and survival. Most placental

48

functions are carried out by trophoblasts, which are derived from the trophectoderm

49

(TE) in blastocysts [1]. After implantation, the trophectoderm becomes multipotent

50

trophoblast stem cells, proliferate and differentiate into distinct trophoblast

51

sublineages, including cytotrophoblast (CT), extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT) and

52

syncytiotrophoblast (ST) [2].

53
54

Previous anatomical studies using a relatively small number of human specimens

55

have shown that the CT appears right after implantation, which then differentiates into

56

the EVT and ST before day 21 post-fertilization [3]. Recent studies using single cell

57

RNA-seq on human placenta successfully revealed transcriptomic and functional

58

heterogeneity between different trophoblast sublineages within placenta. However, all

59

these single cell profiling studies used placenta after 6 gestational weeks [4-7]. Due to

the lacking of data for early-post implantation embryos, it is still elusive when

61

trophoblast sublineages are established, and how the trophoblast differentiation is

62

regulated.

63
64

Human embryos cocultured with endometrial cells in vitro can model

65

morphological and molecular changes of peri-implantation embryos in vivo [8-10]. In

66

this study, we profiled transcriptomes of 476 individual trophoblast cells isolated from

67

19 human embryos co-cultured with endometrial cells. . We revealed the regulatory

68

networks underlying trophoblast development and differentiation. Using a unique

69

bioinformatic approach and a loss-of-function verification experiments, we identified

70

a novel transcription factor TBX3 that regulates the trophoblast differentiation. Our

71

results provided a rich resource to study the early placenta development.

We first obtained human peri-implantation embryos by coculturing blastocysts

79

with human primary endometrial cells (EM) (Figure 1A). Briefly, embryos generated

80

by in vitro fertilization were first cultured to the blastocyst stage following the method

81

described before [11, 12]. At blastocyst stage (day 6.5), embryos were transferred to

82

culture dishes plated with human primary endometrial cells. At day 8, all cocultured

83

embryos hatched out from zona pellucida, attached to the bottom of the dish and

84

adopted a flattened structure that is very similar to previous reports [11, 12] (Figure

85

1B-1G).

86
87

To obtain transcriptomic profiles of human trophoblast cells during

88

peri-implantation development, we harvested single cells from 19 embryos from day 6

to day 10, complement with 25 endometrial cells. Transcriptomes from 614 single

90

cells were successfully profiled, with 0.7 million uniquely mapped reads and 24,011

91

detected transcripts per cell on average. Principle component analysis (PCA) and

92

unbiased hieratical clustering showed that embryonic cells and endometrial cells form

93

two distinct clusters (Figure 2A), and some endometrial cells were mislabeled as

94

embryonic cells during cell picking (Figure 2B). Therefore, we excluded all

95

endometrial cells and focused on 516 embryonic cells in our subsequent analysis.

96
97

The 516 embryonic cells consist of cells of epiblast (EPI), primitive endoderm

98

(PE) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages. To separate trophoblasts that derived from TE

99

lineage from EPI and PE lineage cells, we determined lineage origination of each cell

100

based on its expression of 300 lineage markers, using an algorithm reported before

101

[13]. We identified 476 TE-, 14 EPI- and 26 PE-lineage cells. PCA analysis using the

102

300 lineage markers showed that EPI and PE cells separated from TE-lineage cells

103

(Figure 2C). In addition, EPI and PE cells highly express their corresponding maker

104

genes (Figure 2D), whereas well-characterized TE markers such as GATA2 and

105

GATA3 were highly expressed in all TE-lineage cells (Figure 2E). These results

106

suggested that this algorithm faithfully separated EPI and PE lineage cells from

107

TE-lineage cells.

108
109

Interestingly, while GATA2 and GATA3 were highly expressed through day 6 to

110

day 10, the expression of other TE markers such as DAB2, PTGES, TGFBR3 and

111

PDGFA were significantly downregulated after implantation at day 7 (Figure 2F

112

Figure S1A). These results indicated that not all TE lineage markers are sustainably

113

expressed in trophoblasts during peri-implantation development. We found additional

114

four TE markers, namely KRT19, KRT18, KRT8 and TFRC, that were consistently

115

highly expressed in TE and trophoblasts from day6 through day 10 using our data

116

(Figure 2G, Figure S1B). Collectively, our single-cell RNA-seq data provided a

117

comprehensive transcriptomic profiling for trophoblast from blastocyst through

118

early-post-implantation stages.

Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) Reveals Genetic

121

Program Dynamics for Peri-Implantation Trophoblasts Development

122
123

PCA showed that trophoblast cells were grouped by their development day

124

(Figure 2A). To systematically investigate the genetic program dynamics, we

125

performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on 2,464

126

genes that were variably expressed in trophoblast cells between different

127

developmental stages. WGCNA identified eight gene modules, each of which contains

128

a set of genes that tend to be coexpressed at a certain development stage (Figure 3A).

129

By relating module expression to development day, we found these eight modules

130

collectively represent three genetic networks that were specifically upregulated at day

131

6, day 7-8 and day 8-10 (Figure 3B). These networks could represent core genetic

132

programs that operate in the early (pre-implantation), middle (during implantation) or

133

late (post-implantation) stage of trophoblasts development. We then performed gene

134

ontology (GO) analysis on genes in each network to investigate their biological

135

function. The early-stage network was enrichment in functional terms related to

136

epithelium-like trophoblast development, including morphogenesis of embryonic

137

epithelium, epithelial cell development and epithelial tube formation. Human

138

endogenous retrovirus (HERV) genes are highly expressed in placenta and have an

139

important function in ST formation [14]. The middle-stage network is significantly

140

associated with RNA catabolic process, viral gene expression and viral transcription,

141

indicating HERV genes are dynamically regulated at day 7-8. Genes in the late-stage

142

network were specifically upregulated in day 8-10. GO terms such as cell migration,

143

extracellular matrix organization and response to hypoxia were enriched in these

144

genes, suggesting the activation of trophoblast invasion [15] (Figure 3C and Figure

145

S2).

146
147

To further identify the genes that might play a critical regulatory role in these

148

three genetic networks, we identified 240 hub genes based on the WGCNA measure

149

of intramodular gene connectivity (kME). Hub genes are genes that centrally located

150

within a gene module (kME > 0.8, P<0.05) and have co-expression relationship with

151

many other genes, therefore could have critical regulatory functions. We found that

152

many hub genes are related to critical placental function. For example, EMP2 was a

153

hub gene in the early-stage network. Emp2-deficiency in mice causes aberrant

154

placental angiogenesis [16]. ESRRG was identified as a hub for the late-stage network,

155

and abnormal reduction of ESRRG expression in human placenta is associated with

156

intrauterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia [17]. These results suggested many

157

WGCNA hub genes are potential key regulatory genes for early placental

158

development.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Revealed the Timing of Trophoblast Differentiation

161

Trophoblast sublineages such as EVT, CT and ST are derived from multipotent

162

trophoblasts. But when multipotent trophoblasts differentiate into trophoblast

163

sublineages is unclear [1]. To study this, we performed unbiased clustering using an

164

SNN graph-based clustering algorithm on 476 trophoblast cells, and classified them

165

into six subpopulations (Figure 4A-B and Figure S3A-S3B). Cluster 2, 4 and 5

166

together contain all cells from day 9, day 10, and a few cells from earlier days. By

167

examining the expression of previously defined sublineages marker genes, we found

168

that EVT or ST markers highly expressed in Cluster 2 or 5, whereas Cluster 4

169

co-express CT and EVT marker genes similar to Cluster 1 (Figure 4C). We then

170

identified genes that were specifically expressed in Cluster 2, 4 and 5. We found that

171

many ST marker genes, such as HSD3B1, CYP19A1, SDC1, ERVW-1 (Syncytin-1),

172

ERVV-1, CGA and CGB, were specifically highly expressed in Cluster 5. CT markers,

173

such as ITGA6 and FZD5, were specifically expressed in Cluster 4. A few EVT

174

marker genes such as MMP2 were specifically highly expressed in Cluster 2 (Figure

175

4D). Taken together, these results suggest that Cluster 5, Cluster 4 and Cluster 2

176

represent ST, CT and EVT respectively. The rest clusters consist of trophoblasts from

177

day 6 through day 8, and express CT markers. These results indicated that these

178

clusters represent multipotent trophoblasts that have not committed to differentiation.

180

We then tried to determine when EVT and ST were established in embryos. We

181

found that ST first appears in cocultured embryos at day 7, even though at a very low

182

percentage (1 out of 60 cells). ST cells then become more abundant at day 8 (16 out of

183

168 cells) (Figure 4E). Immunostaining showed that hCGβ positive cells can be

184

detected as early as day 7, and become more abundant at day 8 (Figure 4F). These

185

results suggested that ST cells first occur after day 7, and become more abundant after

186

day 8. Similarly, we found EVT cells were absent in all of the day 7 embryos but

187

appear at day 8, indicating EVT were generated after day 7 (Figure 4E). Taken

188

together, our results revealed the time course when ST and EVT appear in

189

peri-implantation embryos in vitro.

Single-Cell Bifurcation Analysis Using the Variance of Gene Expression (SCBAV)

192

Identifies TBX3 as a Novel Master Regulator for Trophoblast Differentiation

193

The ST is an important trophoblast sublineage that forms the primary barrier

194

between maternal and fetal circulation and synthesize hormones vital for pregnancy.

195

The ST is derived from multipotent trophoblasts within TE and CT. Previous studies

196

using mature placentas and cell lines have demonstrated that many regulatory factors

197

and pathways have been reported to be linked with the human ST formation [18-21].

198

However, these results must be interpret carefully, because these in vitro

199

differentiation models may not perfectly recapuliate the mechanism for trophoblast

200

differentiation in vivo.

201
202

Our data provided a unique opportunity to study how trophoblast differentiation

203

is regulated in vivo, especially during early placenta development. It is generally

204

accepted that the mechanism underlying a cell-fate decision event can be summarized

205

by a hieratical model: a small number of “master” regulators, such as transcriptional

206

factors, were stochastically activated in a subset of cells before cell-fate decision due

207

to environmental fluctuations or random variation of transcriptional network. These

208

master regulators then activate a larger number of cell-type specific genes, which

209

initiate the fate transition and confer cell-type specific function. The identification of

210

the master regulator can be a critical step for understanding the molecular mechanism

211

controlling the trophoblast differentiation. However, the lack of a computational

212

method that can systematically identify master regulators underlying a cell fate

213

decision event poses a major challenge for our analysis.

214
215

To identify the master regulator genes that drive the cell fate transition from

216

multipotent trophoblast to ST, we designed single-cell bifurcation analysis using

217

variance of gene expression (SCBAV), a computational strategy that can systemically

218

screen for master regulators using time-serial scRNA-seq data (Figure S4A). Briefly,

219

SCBAV first reconstruct a cell development trajectory from scRNA-seq data. A cell

220

type transition will be represented as a bifurcation event in the trajectory. SCBAV then

221

screen the master regulator underlying a bifurcation event according to gene

222

expression level and variation. Transcription factors that are highly variable before

223

bifurcation, and significantly differentially expressed in two lineages after bifurcation

224

are likely to be the master regulator. By applying SCBAV on our trophoblast cells

225

dataset, we identified a bifurcation event that happens after day 8 (Figure S4B- S4C).

226

CT and EVT markers were highly expressed in one lineage after bifurcation, while ST

227

markers were greatly upregulated in the other lineage (Figure S4D-S3I). This

228

bifurcation, therefore, captured the cell-fate segregation of ST from CT and EVT.

229

SCBAV found 26 putative master regulators driving this bifurcation. Among them,

230

TBX3 is the transcription factor that was ranked as the most top by both of two master

231

regulator screening criteria (Figure S4J-S4L). TBX3 is highly expressed in embryos

232

at day 8 (Figure S5). Taken together, these results suggested TBX3 could be a master

233

regulator controlling multipotent trophoblast differentiation into ST.

To validate the function of TBX3 in trophoblast differentiation, we used a

well-established in vitro trophoblast differentiation system, which modeled CT-to-ST

differentiation by treating trophoblast cell line JEG-3 with cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP.

240

The generation of ST can be characterized by cell fusion and ST marker gene

241

expression [20, 22]. In control JEG-3 cells that were not treated by 8-Br-cAMP, the

242

cell fusion ratio was less than 1%, and ST marker hCGβ expression was almost

243

undetectable, indicating ST generation before treatment is minimal (Figure 5A-B,

244

0mM group). After 48h treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, JEG-3 cells exhibited greatly

245

enhanced cell fusion and hCGβ compared to the control group, and the fusion ratio is

246

correlated with 8-Br-cAMP concentration (Figure 5A-B). Notably, TBX3 was not

247

expressed in the control group but was significantly upregulated by 8-Br-cAMP

248

treatment, and the upregulation fold is also correlated with 8-Br-cAMP concentration

249

(Figure 5A and 5C).

250
251

We then knocked down TBX3 in JEG-3 cells using lentiviral vectors expressing

252

TBX3 shRNA and assessed its influence on ST generation. Control shRNA (shNC)

253

targeting no known mammalian RNA and shRNA targeting TBX3 (shTBX3-a and

254

shTBX3-b) had no discernable influence on proliferation of JEG-3 cells. However,

255

shTBX3-a and shTBX3-b interference resulted in 96±1% and 97±1% suppression of

256

TBX3 mRNA levels after 8-Br-cAMP treatment, respectively and also in suppressed

257

TBX3 protein levels (Figure S6A-B). TBX3 knockdown also significantly reduced

258

cell fusion (75±7% and 64±14% reduction in shTBX3-a and shTBX3-b cells,

259

respectively) (Figure 5D) and downregulated ST markers transcription, including

260

human chorionic gonadotropin subunits (CGA and CGB), Syncytin (ERVW-1) and

261

other HERV-derived genes (ERVV-1 and ERVV-2) (Figure 5E-5G, Figure S6C).

262

Immunostaining showed that hCGβ protein level was decreased by TBX3 knockdown

263

(Figure 5H). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TBX3 is required for ST

264

formation.

Coculturing with endometrial cells influences genes related to trophoblast

development

cocultured with endometrial cells (co-day 7 trophoblasts) and trophoblasts from day 7

270

embryos cultured without endometrial cells (u-day 7 trophoblasts) into two distinct

clusters, indicating that endometrial cells have a profound impact on trophoblasts

272

(Figure S7). To dissect the influence of coculturing, we identified the differentially

273

expressed genes (DEGs) between co-day 7 and u-day 7 trophoblasts. We found EIF5A,

274

a gene involved in trophoblast proliferation, migration, and invasion; WEE1, a gene

275

regulating mitosis and associated with cell cycle progression in trophoblast cells; and

276

CCR7, a chemokine gene associated with trophoblast differentiation, were

277

significantly upregulated by coculturing in day 7 trophoblasts [23-25]. On the other

278

side, MDM2, a gene associated with preeclampsia susceptibility, was significantly

279

downregulated by coculturing [26]. These results suggest that coculturing with

280

endometrial cells can influence the expression of genes related to trophoblast

281

development.

283

Transcriptomic Analysis Suggests Trophoblast Differentiation Initiates at Polar

284

TE Side in Blastocysts

285

Polar and mural TE cells are TE subpopulations that emerge at the blastocyst

286

stage [13, 27]. Anatomical studies showed that most of human blastocysts attach to

287

endometrium at the polar side, and polar TE first proliferate and invade into

288

endometrium [1, 3]. These results implicated the polar TE could have an important

289

function for implantation. But the role of polar TE during post-implantation

290

development is still elusive. Hieratical clustering using 129 previously identified polar

291

TE markers [13] robustly separate day 7 trophoblast cells into 2 subpopulations,

292

which is consistent with the existence of polar and mural TE at day 7 (Figure 6A). We

293

then sought to investigate the relationship between polar and mural TE and the 6

294

subpopulations we identified above. We found that polar TE markers were lowly

295

expressed in all day 6 cells and day 7 non-cocultured cells, and moderately expressed

296

in CT cells at different developmental day. Interestingly, polar TE markers were

297

significantly upregulated in differentiated trophoblasts, including EVT and ST

298

(Figure 6B). These results showed that polar TE markers were upregulated in

299

differentiated trophoblast cells, suggesting that trophoblast differentiation was first

300

initiated in polar TEs.

Discussion

303

Trophoblasts undergo magnificent morphological movement and cellular changes

304

after implantation. In this study, by profiling over 500 single cells in 19 embryos

305

generated using a coculture system, we reconstruct the transcriptome dynamics of

306

trophoblasts through blastocyst to early post-implantation stages (Figure 7). Our

307

study complements previous studies that use scRNA-seq to profile trophoblasts and

308

other cell types within mature placenta [4-7].

309
310

Our bioinformatic analysis suggests TBX3 has a critical role in regulating the ST

311

formation. TBX3 haploinsufficiency in human causes ulnar-mammary syndrome

312

(UMS), a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal forelimb and apocrine gland

313

development [28]. Although TBX3 is abundant in human placenta [29], its role in the

314

placenta has not been studied. Our results demonstrated that TBX3 is required for

315

both hCGβ and syncytium formation, indicating TBX3 is a master regulator for ST

316

formation.

HERV-derived genes are upregulated in ST, and their expression is regulated by

319

DNA methylation [30]. Using the in vitro trophoblast differentiation system, we found

320

that DNMT1 and DNMT3B are significantly downregulated after 8-Br-cAMP

321

treatment, whereas TET2 and TET3 are significantly upregulated after 8-Br-cAMP

322

treatment (Figure S6C). These results are consistent with our scRNA-seq data, and

323

indicate that DNMT1, DNMT3B TET2 and TET3 might be involved in the regulation

324

of DNA methylation on HERVs during trophoblast differentiation. However, TBX3

325

knockdown downregulated DNMT1 but did not significantly influence expression

326

level of DNMT3B, TET2 nor TET3 (Figure S6C). These results indicate that TBX3

327

can regulate HERV expression but not through altering the transcription level of

328

DNMTs and TETs. Further studies should be done to elucidate how TBX3 regulates

329

HERV expression in trophoblasts.

331

Our scRNA-seq data revealed that DPPA3 (a.k.a STELLA and PGC7) expression

332

is significantly downregulated in ST compared to CT and EVT (Figure S8).

333

Consistently, in the trophoblast in vitro differentiation system, DPPA3 is significantly

334

downregulated by 8-Br-cAMP treatment, whereas TBX3 knockdown does not

335

significantly alter DPPA3 expression (Figure S6C). Since Dppa3 is a factor that

336

safeguards DNA methylation at ERVs in mouse embryos and involves pluripotency

337

circuit in mESC [31], these results suggest DPPA3 in human could maintain

338

differentiation potential of trophoblast progenitors and repress trophoblast

339

differentiation and deactivating HERVs.

340
341

In conclusion, our study established single-cell transcriptomic profiles of

342

peri-implantation trophoblast cells. Moreover, we have found a new role of TBX3 as a

343

regulator of the trophoblast differentiation in human. Our study offers unique

344

resources for understanding the early placenta development and pathogenesis

345

associated with early trophoblast defects.

Materials and methods

348
349

Human Embryo Culture and Isolation

350

The embryos were voluntarily donated by the patients at the Center for Clinical

351

Reproductive Medicine at Tongji Hospital of Tongji University with informed consent

352

and institutional approval. Human peri-implantation embryos were cultured according

353

to protocols [11, 12] with the addition of endometrium cells. When embryos hatch out

354

from zona pellucida at day 6.5, we transferred blastocysts to dishes plated with human

355

endometrial cells. Non-coculture day7 embryos were used as a control group to

356

coculture day 7. Single cells of embryos randomly collected from all stages were

357

acquired according to a previous procedure [32]. For attached embryos from day 7 to

358

day 10, they underwent short incubation in trypsin to detach from dishes and were

359

manually transferred to a new dish containing trypsin for further dissociation for 3 to

360

5 minutes with repeated aspiration using a mouth-operated, drawn capillary pipette. A

361

single cell was then manually picked using the capillary pipette into a 0.2-ml PCR

362

tube containing lysis buffer.

363
364

Single-Cell RNA-Seq Library Preparation

365

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using SMART-seq2 protocol with

366

minor modification [33, 34]. Briefly, a single cell was first lysed in 0.5uL lysis buffer,

367

followed by reverse transcription using Superscript III. After purification using

368

Ampure XP Beads, amplified cDNA product was diluted to 0.1ng/uL. 0.1 ng

369

amplified cDNA was used for library construction. Libraries were pooled and

370

sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X10 in paired-end, 150bp mode.

371
372

Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Processing

373

Single-cell RNA seq data were first trimmed with TrimGalore! using following

374

parameters “-q 20 --phred33 --gzip --length 30 --paired” to remove adaptor sequences

375

and low-quality bases. The trimmed data was then aligned to human reference

376

genome hg38 using STAR v2.6.0 in the pair-end mode with default parameters. The

377

number of reads mapped to each gene was counted using featureCounts v1.6.2, using

378

Gencode hg38 gene annotation. Customized R scripts and published R packages,

379

including Seurat, were used in subsequent analysis.

380
381

Identification of TE, EPI and PE Lineage Cells and Identification of

382

Peri-Implantation Trophoblast Markers

383

To our experience, the majority of cells in peri-implantation embryos are of

384

trophoblast lineage. Therefore, random picking ensures us to unbiasedly sample

385

trophoblast population with a few cells of EPI or PE lineage. Embryonic cells were

386

assigned into three lineages, namely TE, EPI and PE, based on their expression of 300

387

previous identified lineage marker genes. Specifically, the read-count matrix was first

388

normalized and quality-controlled using Seurat. The lineage identity for each cell was

389

then determined using a previous strategy reported before [35]. Briefly, for each cell,

390

a “TE score”, an “EPI score” and a “PE score” were computed using

391

AddModuleScore function implemented in Seurat package, based on its expression of

392

previously identified markers for each lineage respectively. The cell lineage was then

393

defined as the lineage that had the highest score. To identify maintained trophoblast

394

markers, we started with previously identified TE marker genes for pre-implantation

395

embryos, and excluded genes that were lowly expressed in trophoblasts at any stage

396

between day-6 to day-10 (mean FPKM < 10 over all trophoblasts on each day).

397
398

Weighted Gene Co-Expression Analysis (WGCNA)

399

WGCNA was performed on normalized gene expression data measured in read

400

count per million (RPM) metric, using 2,464 highly variably expressed genes

401

determined by FindVariableGenes function in Seurat. The WGCNA was then

402

performed following the previously published study [32]. Briefly, the topological

403

overlap matrix (TOM) was constructed with softPower was set to 8. The hub genes

404

for each module were identified as module eigengene based connectivity kME > 0.8

405

and P-value <0.05. The gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using Gene

406

Ontology Consortium website (http://geneontology.org) and R package clusterProfiler.

407
408

Single-Cell Bifurcation Analysis Using Variance of Gene Expression (SCBAV)

409

SCBAV consists of two steps. It first constructs a cell lineage trajectory using

410

scRNA-seq data and identifies when lineage segregation happens. It then identifies

411

the master regulator that could cause the lineage segregation based on certain criteria.

412

Briefly, SCBAV represents all cells from different time points on the same reduced

413

dimension using principle component analysis. The first N principle components are

414

used, such that N is the smallest number that can capture at least 40% of the total

415

variation within the data. Next, within this reduced dimension SCBAV identifies cell

416

subpopulations within cells from each time-point, using Gap Statistics and K-means

417

clustering. The Gap Statistics is used to determine the number of subpopulations

418

within cells from each time-point, and K-means clustering is used to classify cells into

419

clusters based on the cluster number determined by Gap Statistics. SCBAV then

420

constructs cell lineage trajectory by iteratively connecting the most similar clusters

421

between two time points. Specifically, for a cluster A in time-point t, SCBAV connects

422

it to the cluster in t+1, whose centroid as the highest correlation with cluster A’s

423

centroid among all clusters in t+1. SCBAV keeps doing this until all clusters from all

424

time-points were connected to one lineage trajectory.

425
426

A cell-fate segregation event will be represented as a bifurcation on the cell-fate

427

trajectory. Suppose there is a bifurcation event in the lineage trajectory right after

428

time-point t. Bifurcation event represents a cellular differentiation event. SCBAV then

429

tries to identify the master regulator than drive the bifurcation. According to the

430

hieratical model for cell-fate transition regulation mentioned above, a master regulator

431

that promotes a cell lineage bifurcation must meet two criteria: 1) it is consistently

432

differentially expressed between two lineages after bifurcation point; 2) it is highly

433

variably expressed in the cell population right before bifurcation.

Cell Culture and shRNA Constructs

436

Endometrium tissue was obtained from patients at Tongji Hospital of Tongji

437

University. The endometrium tissue donor with no genetic disorder or diseases signed

438

informed consents. Primary endometrium was dissected using scalpels and then

439

enzymatically digested in 1% collagenase I and IV (Gibco,17100-017 and 17014-019)

440

with repeated pipetted up and down for 30 minutes at 37°C. After filtration through

441

40μm strainers and centrifugation at 300 g for 3 min, the supernatant was removed,

442

and the pellet at the bottom was washed with PBS twice. Then, the pellet was

443

resuspended and prepared for use.

444
445

JEG-3 trophoblast cells were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of

446

Sciences and were cultured in MEM medium (Gibco, 10370021) with the addition of

447

0.11g/L Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070) and 10% FBS (Gibco, 10099141). To

448

stimulate JEG-3 trophoblast differentiation, cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP

449

(Sigma-Aldrich, B7880).

Immunofluorescence Staining

462

Embryos and cells growing on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde

463

and were permeabilized in 0.2% triton X-100 for 10 min. Subsequently, embryos and

464

cells were blocked at room temperature in 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour and incubated

465

with primary antibodies (hCGβ, Abcam, ab9582; TBX3, Abcam, ab99302) in

466

blocking solution overnight at 4°C. The embryos and cells were then washed twice in

467

blocking solution and incubated with species-appropriate fluorescent-conjugated

468

secondary antibodies at RT for 1 h before final washes in blocking solution.

469

Coverslips with embryos or cells were then moved to drops of Vectashield mounting

470

media with DAPI (Vector Lab, H-1200) on slides for 10 min incubation before

471

imaging. For non-cocultured embryos, all immunostaining operations were under the

472

stereoscopic microscope. Cell fusion index was analyzed according to previous

profiling of peri-implantation trophoblasts revealed the differential expression of trophoblast
pan-markers and the dynamic genetic program of trophoblast development. ST cells were
abundant at day8, and TBX3 was critical for ST formation using SCBAV as well as in vitro
