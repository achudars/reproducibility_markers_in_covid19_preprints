Abstract

18
19

Sequencing data from host-associated microbes can often be contaminated by the body of the

20

investigator or research subject. Human DNA is typically removed from microbial reads

21

either by subtractive alignment (dropping all reads that map to the human genome) or using a

22

read classification tool to predict those of human origin, and then discarding them. To inform

23

best practice guidelines, we benchmarked 8 alignment-based and 2 classification-based

24

methods of human read detection using simulated data from 10 clinically prevalent bacteria

25

and 3 viruses, into which contaminating human reads had been added.

26

While the majority of methods successfully detected > 99% of the human reads, they were

27

distinguishable by variance. The most precise methods, with negligible variance, were

28

Bowtie2 and SNAP, both of which misclassified few, if any, bacterial reads (and no viral

29

reads) as human. While correctly detecting a similar number of human reads, methods based

30

on taxonomic classification, such as Kraken2 and Centrifuge, often misclassified bacterial

31

reads as human, the extent of which was species-specific. Among the most sensitive methods

32

of human read detection was BWA, although this also made the greatest number of false

33

positive classifications. Across all methods, the set of human reads not identified as such,

34

although often representing < 0.1% of the total reads, were non-randomly distributed along

35

the human genome with many originating from the repeat-rich sex chromosomes.

36

For viral reads and longer (> 300bp) bacterial reads, the highest performing approaches were

37

classification-based, using Kraken2 or Centrifuge. For shorter (150-300bp) bacterial reads,

38

combining multiple methods of human read detection maximised the recovery of human

39

reads from contaminated short read datasets without being compromised by false positives.

40

The highest-performing approach with shorter bacterial reads was a two-stage classification

41

using Bowtie2 followed by SNAP. Using this approach, we re-examined 11,577 publicly

42

archived bacterial readsets for hitherto undetected human contamination. We were able to

43

extract a sufficient number of reads to call known human SNPs, including those with clinical

44

significance, in 6% of the samples. These results show that phenotypically-distinct human

45

sequence is widespread in publicly-archived (and nominally pure) bacterial datasets.

46
47

Background

48
49

Sequencing data from host-associated microbes, including metagenomic read sets, can often

50

be contaminated by the body of the investigator or research subject (1). Furthermore, as the

51

human genome is around 1000-fold larger than most bacterial genomes, sequencing a tissue

52

biopsy containing equal numbers of human and bacterial cells would still produce a sample

53

containing 99.9% human DNA (2). Accordingly, (human) contaminants need to be removed

54

prior to downstream analysis (3) so as to minimise false-positive associations and reduce

55

batch effects. The incomplete removal of human reads from nominally pure microbial

56

datasets could theoretically lead to large volumes of residual human DNA being deposited in

57

public archives. This raises numerous ethical concerns (4), particularly as individuals can be

58

distinguished even within large, pooled, genomic datasets (5). This is not just a theoretical

59

problem: previous studies have identified substantial cross-species contamination in genome

60

assemblies (6), including human DNA comprising 2% of the purportedly complete

61

Plasmodium gaboni assembly, a known human parasite (7), and 492 of 2749 non-primate

62

assemblies containing the primate-specific AluY element (8).

63
64

With ever-increasing volumes of genomic (and metagenomic) data being deposited in public

65

archives, there is a practical need to benchmark methods of human read detection so as to

66

inform best practice guidelines. These methods follow two basic approaches: subtractive

67

alignment and direct classification. For the former, reads are mapped to the human genome

68

using a short read aligner such as BWA-mem (as in (9, 10)), Bowtie2 (as in (11, 12)) or

69

SNAP (as in (13), or as part of the SURPI – Sequence-based Ultra-Rapid Pathogen

70

Identification – pipeline (14)) with successfully mapped reads then subtracted from the

71

dataset. Numerous pre-processing tools have been developed using this approach including

72

CS-SCORE (15), DeconSeq (16), GenCoF (17), and MetaGeniE (18) (which employ BWA-

73

fastmap, BWA-sw, Bowtie2, and both BWA-mem and Bowtie2, respectively). The second

74

approach is to classify, and then discard, human content by predicting the taxonomic origin of

75

each read using a database of human, bacterial and viral genomes, such as RefSeq or NCBI

76

nr, using k-mer based classification tools such as Centrifuge (19) or Kraken (20), as in two

77

studies employing the latter (2, 21).

78
79

However, no comparisons to date have identified the optimal method. We therefore evaluated

80

several variations on these two basic approaches: by mapping all reads within a mixed dataset

81

to the human genome, and by predicting read origin with the taxonomic classifiers Centrifuge

82

and Kraken, using both all-species and human-only databases. When mapping reads to the

83

human genome, we used eight commonly-employed aligners – Bowtie2 (22), BWA-mem

84

(23), GEM (24), HISAT2 (25), minimap2 (26), Novoalign (www.novocraft.com), SMALT

85

(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0), and SNAP (27) – alongside two different

86

versions of the human primary assembly, GRCh38 and GRCh37, the latter of lower quality.

87

We included the lower quality (and hence less accurate/complete) assembly because in real

88

data we expect contaminating sequences could be degraded and would not necessarily

89

precisely map (for example, gaps in the GRCh37 assembly are apparent around the

90

centromeres and short arms of acrocentric chromosomes (28)). In total, this represents 16

91

different approaches to subtractive alignment (8 aligners * 2 genomes) and 4 different

92

approaches to direct classification (2 classifiers * 2 databases), 20 methods in total.

93
94

To evaluate each method, we simulated 3 sets of 150bp and 3 sets of 300bp paired-end reads

95

(characteristic of the Illumina NextSeq and MiSeq platforms, respectively) at 10-fold

96

coverage from 10 clinically common bacteria with fully sequenced (closed) core genomes:

97

the Gram-positive Clostridioides difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus,

98

and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,

99

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella dysenteriae, and Mycobacterium

100

tuberculosis. These genomes were used in a previous benchmarking study assessing the

101

performance of bacterial SNP calling pipelines (29). To each of these bacterial readsets we

102

added human reads equivalent to between 1 and 10% of the bacterial reads, at increments of

103

1%. We supplemented this data with 3 sets of 150bp and 3 sets of 300bp paired-end reads

104

simulated at 100-fold coverage from 3 viral genomes (hepatitis C, HIV, influenza A), with

105

human reads also added at 1-10% increments.

106
107

As we aimed to establish the optimal method for maximising the removal of human reads, we

108

report, for each method, the number of true positive (i.e. human reads identified as human),

109

false positive (microbial reads identified as human) and false negative (human reads not

110

identified as such) classifications, alongside the summary metrics precision (positive

111

predictive value, the proportion of reads classified as human that truly are human), recall

112

(sensitivity) and F-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall (30). We also

113

characterise those regions of the human genome more likely to be unidentified and which

114

would be inadvertently (and disproportionately) retained in an otherwise ‘human depleted’

115

microbial dataset. We were specifically interested in methods that minimised the number of

116

false negative calls and so also evaluated two-stage approaches, testing the sequential use of

117

different aligners or classifiers.

Results and Discussion

120
121

Comparing methods for detecting human reads in a contaminated microbial dataset

122

The performance of 12 common methods of human read detection (8 aligners + 2 read

123

classifiers each with 2 databases) was first evaluated using reads simulated from 10 closed

124

bacterial genomes and 3 viral genomes (Supplementary Table 1), to which were added

125

reads simulated from human genome GRCh38. This comparison contained 9360 records,

126

comprising 2 read lengths (150bp and 300bp) * 3 replicates * 13 species * 10 incremental

127

additions of human reads (comprising 1-10% of the total number of bacterial or viral reads) *

128

12 methods (that is, 780 records per method, of which 600 were bacterial).

129

The number of reads simulated and the performance statistics for each method – the

130

percentage of reads correctly classified as human (‘true positive rate’), the percentage of

131

human reads not classified as human (‘false negative rate’), and the F-score (harmonic mean

132

of precision and recall) – are given in Supplementary Table 2, with distributions illustrated

133

in Figure 1A.

135

Although the median percentage of true positive classifications was high for the majority of

136

methods, they were distinguishable by variance. This was only the case for bacteria as all

137

methods using viral genomes identified 100% of the human reads (Supplementary Table 2).

138

With bacteria, the highest true positive rates (> 99.9%), with negligible variance, were found

139

using Bowtie2, HISAT2 or SNAP to align all reads against the human genome. The true

140

positive rate was 100% in 582 of the 600 (bacterial) simulations using SNAP, 594 of the 600

141

simulations using Bowtie2, and all 600 simulations using HISAT2 (Supplementary Table

142

2). Similarly high true positive rates (around 99%), although with increasingly greater

143

variance, were found when predicting human reads using a taxonomic classifier

144

(Centrifuge/Kraken) with the RefSeq database (that is, the human genome plus prokaryotic

145

genomes) and when using Novoalign, BWA-mem, GEM or Minimap2 to align all reads

146

against the human genome. True positive rate was notably reduced (to < 90%), and variation

147

substantially increased, when using either taxonomic classifier with a human-only database

148

(Figure 1A). The poorest performing method (true positive rate < 25%) was the aligner

149

SMALT which, although correctly identifying all human reads (that is, having a false

150

negative rate of 0), could not reliably discriminate bacterial from human sequence and so

151

made a large number of false positive calls (Supplementary Table 2).

152
153

Similarly, taxonomic classifiers using a complete genome database could discriminate

154

between human and bacterial reads, whereas those using a human-only database made a far

155

greater number of false positive calls (Figure 1B). This is because the human genome, as

156

with other chordates, contains numerous genes of bacterial origin arising through horizontal

157

gene transfer (HGT) (31), once thought of limited effect in animals due to their segregated

158

germlines sheltering the genome from heritably meaningful exposure to foreign DNA (32).

159

Accordingly, the proportion of false positive calls – while generally low – varied greatly by

160

species (Figure 2). This was most notable for C. difficile (the genome of which is approx.

161

11% mobile genetic elements (33)) and N. gonorrhoeae (in which HGT from a human host

162

has previously been characterised (34)) where the aligners BWA-mem and minimap2, and to

163

a lesser extent GEM, made false positive calls at a rate > 5% in some simulations.

164

Importantly, these methods misclassified bacterial reads as human even when no human

165

reads were present in the dataset (Supplementary Table 2).

166
167

Most methods produced a low number of false negative calls, of approximately < 1% of the

168

total reads, with minimal variance (Figure 1C). This was particularly apparent for BWA5

169

mem and Kraken2 (using the RefSeq database), for which the false negative rate using

170

bacterial data was 0% for all 600 simulations, and for 573 of 600 simulations, respectively,

171

with similar results seen with viral data (Supplementary Table 2). However, two aligners,

172

HISAT2 and Novoalign, were prominent outliers, having relatively high false negative rates

173

(with bacterial data, median 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively) and notably greater variance.

174
175

These results suggest that compared to the more-variable performance of a taxonomic

176

classifier across the three summary metrics (Kraken and Centrifuge both make a number of

177

false positive calls), the subtractive alignment of human reads is a generally higher-

178

performing strategy for shorter (150-300bp) reads. Nevertheless, performance depends on

179

choice of aligner. For example, HISAT2 had the highest true positive and lowest false

180

positive rate (100% and 0%, respectively), but also made the greatest number of false

181

negative calls (Figure 1). A lower number of false negative calls was made by, for example,

182

BWA-mem, although at the expense of a higher false positive call rate. By contrast, Bowtie2

183

and SNAP had true positive and false positive rates comparable to HISAT2 (that is,

184

approximating 100%), although far lower false negative rates.

185
186

Unlike the other aligners, the variance in false negative rate for Bowtie2 was related to read

187

length. For 291 of the 300 bacterial simulations using 150bp reads, it was notable that false

188

negative rate was 0% (Supplementary Table 2). However, and in clear contrast, for 288 of

189

the 300 simulations using 300bp reads, false negative rate was > 0% (median 0.02%). The

190

difference in call rate was because in this study, we made no attempt to optimise each aligner

191

and so used only default parameters. Bowtie2 employs a ‘seed and extend’ alignment

192

strategy, whereby exact matches of read substrings are used to ‘seed’ alignments of the full

193

read, which by default is aligned in its entirety end-to-end. Read alignments are scored

194

according to successful base matches and penalised for mismatches, with those meeting a

195

minimum scoring threshold reported. It is important to note that Bowtie2 was originally

196

designed to align shorter reads (< 300bp) with high sensitivity, with the scoring function

197

optimised to that end. Without modifying the default parameters, longer reads would be

198

slightly less likely to align, consistent with our observations.

199
200

To test the effect of read length on human read classification, we repeated the above

201

simulations varying read length from 50bp to 1000bp, at 50bp increments (using the same

202

parameters and formula for insert size as described in Materials and Methods). We repeated

203

the simulations for the set of 10 bacterial genomes, although restricted analysis to 10 methods

204

(we excluded the use of Centrifuge and Kraken with human-only databases) and to

205

simulating a number of human reads equivalent to 10% of the number of bacterial reads. In

206

total, this represents 6000 simulations (20 read lengths * 3 replicates * 10 species * 10

207

methods). Performance statistics are given in Supplementary Table 3, and the variance of F-

208

score with read length illustrated in Figure 3. We excluded viral genomes from this analysis

209

as the previous simulations showed that viral reads could be unambiguously distinguished

210

from human reads. Accordingly, varying read length was not expected to have significant

211

impact.

212
213

For longer (> 300bp) bacterial reads, the classification-based methods (Kraken and

214

Centrifuge) consistently produced precision, recall and F-scores of 1 (Supplementary Table

215

3). By contrast, alignment-based methods were especially sensitive to read length since

216

implicitly this affects the appropriateness of the parameters used to score alignments (the

217

default parameters of most aligners assume reads of shorter length). All methods performed

218

with comparable F-scores if using reads within the range of 150-300bp (i.e. read lengths

219

expected of Illumina HiSeq/NextSeq/MiSeq sequencers), although there was considerable

220

variance in performance at lower read lengths, with the exception of Bowtie2 (which

221

performs highly even with 50bp reads). At higher read lengths, Bowtie2, HISAT2 and SNAP

222

(when using default parameters) all declined in performance, with the F-scores of Bowtie2

223

and HISAT2 gradually declining from approx. 200bp and 500bp, respectively. SNAP

224

declined in performance sharply when using reads greater than 400bp, although doing so is

225

contrary to recommended use (to enable SNAP to process reads > 400bp, the value of

226

MAX_READ_LENGTH needed to be manually edited in SNAPLib/Read.h before

227

compiling). SMALT, if used with default parameters, appeared optimised for shorter (<

228

250bp) reads, and showed consistently poorer performance (plateauing at an approx. F-score

229

of 0.5) for longer reads. SMALT was also strongly affected by species (see the highly

230

variable F-score in Figure 1C), with multiple F-score distributions apparent in Figure 3.

231
232

We found no discernible difference in true or false positive classification rates when aligning

233

reads to lower-quality human genomes (that is, older assemblies) (Supplementary Figure 1).

234
235

All methods of human read depletion fail to classify reads from similar regions

236

We were particularly interested in false negative calls – human reads that were not classified

237

as such and so would have been retained within a microbial dataset. In contrast, false positive

238

calls are likely to be reads from human genes with microbial homology (and vice versa), the

239

exclusion of which would artificially reduce the read depth of a microbial dataset, albeit only

240

to a small degree.

241
242

By reference to the GRCh38.p12 and GRCh37.p13 gene coordinates (from Ensembl BioMart

243

(35)), we identified, per method, the proportion of reads with false negative classifications

244

(i.e., human reads not classified as human; hereafter ‘false negative reads’) deriving from

245

different genomic regions (Supplementary Table 4). With Kraken and Centrifuge (when

246

provided a combined microbial and human database), it was particularly notable that in

247

absolute terms there were not only few false negative calls but few in genic regions

248

(Supplementary Table 4). This is likely because both methods avoid (intrinsically inexact)

249

alignments to make exact-match queries against a database of k-mers, with larger databases –

250

and the uniqueness of gene sequences – affording greater resolving power. While Kraken

251

classifies reads on the basis of the lowest common ancestor for all genomes containing its

252

constituent k-mers (20), Centrifuge can also assign a single sequence to multiple taxonomic

253

categories. However, as the present task is essentially one of binary classification –

254

discriminating human from non-human reads – we found only a modest difference in

255

performance between the two approaches. Using the RefSeq database, Kraken had greater

256

variance in false positive calls than Centrifuge although compensated with fewer false

257

negative calls (Figure 1). For both methods the presence of at least one or more unique k-

258

mers among the reads sequenced from human genes appears sufficient to discriminate them

259

from essentially all bacterial genomes (unique k-mers ostensibly reflecting divergent

260

evolutionary histories).

261
262

Table 1 summarises, per method, the number of unique genes from which one or more false

263

negative reads were derived (hereafter, ‘false negative genes’), or to which one or more

264

bacterial reads had been classified (hereafter, ‘false positive genes’), across all 13 species and

265

all replicates of each method. Consistent with Figure 1C, virtually all human reads were

266

detected by methods with zero or negligible false negative rate such as BWA-mem and

267

SMALT, with reads undetected by Kraken2 or Centrifuge (when using the RefSeq database)

268

representing < 40 genes. The number of genes represented by the two methods with the

269

highest false negative (HISAT2) and false positive (SMALT) rates accounted for the majority

270

of genes in the human genome (> 20,000), suggesting that reads misclassified by these

271

methods were unlikely to have common characteristics. Accordingly, we would not expect

272

these sets of genes to be significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms if false

273

negative, or false positive, calls were randomly distributed across the genome.

274
275

Nevertheless, we found that for the remaining methods (which were more sensitive and/or

276

more precise) each set of false negative genes was enriched for a broadly consistent set of GO

277

terms related to the nervous system (Supplementary Table 5). For example, when aligning

278

reads to the GRCh38.p12 assembly, undetected reads were enriched for genes with process

279

terms such as ‘dendrite development’ (among the set of genes with reads undetected by

280

GEM) and ‘glutamatergic synaptic transmission’ (minimap2) and component terms such as

281

‘synaptic membrane’ (SNAP, GEM and minimap2), ‘postsynaptic membrane’ (Bowtie2),

282

‘neuromuscular junction’ (GEM), ‘neuron part’ (minimap2), ‘photoreceptor disc membrane’

283

(Kraken2) and ‘astrocyte projection’ (Centrifuge). Similar results were found when aligning

284

reads to the GRCh37.p13 assembly, with undetected reads enriched for genes with process

285

terms including ‘neural tube formation’ (Bowtie2) and ‘synapse assembly’ (both minimap2

286

and SNAP) (Supplementary Table 5). An equivalent set of nervous system-related GO

287

terms was found for each set of false positive genes (that is, genes with a likely microbial

288

homologue) in both assemblies. In this case, misclassified microbial reads were also enriched

289

for genes with component terms such as ‘neuronal cell body’ (GEM; GRCh38.p12) and

290

process terms such as ‘postsynaptic membrane assembly’ (BWA-mem; GRCh37.p13)

291

(Supplementary Table 6).

292
293

These results suggest that in general, alignment-based methods of human read detection

294

consistently fail to classify reads from functionally-similar genes. Further to this, a relatively

295

high proportion of false negative reads originated from the sex chromosomes (Figure 4 and

296

Supplementary Table 4), both known for their high (>50%) repeat content (36, 37). This

297

was particularly apparent when using Novoalign (from which the median percentage of false

298

negative reads from chromosomes X and Y were 6.4% and 18.3%, respectively), and to a

299

It is important to note that it is impossible to align shorter sequencing reads across lengthy

304

read classification. RecoverY (38) is a tool for selecting Y-specific reads by reference to a

305

database of k-mers built from single-copy genes on the Y chromosome. The original purpose

306

of this was, assuming only human reads as input, to detect and remove non-Y reads which

307

could otherwise confound a genome assembler. Whilst in theory this approach could be

308

combined with others tested here, in practice several of the methods did not suffer from sex

309

chromosome specific mapping issues and would hence be preferable.

310
311

Overall, the non-random distribution of false negative reads suggests that many methods of

312

human read detection failed to detect reads from similar regions. It follows that a possible

313

strategy for maximising the number of correctly identified human reads is to combine

314

approaches so that multiple methods could compensate for locally-poor mapping.

315
316

Human (short) read detection is improved by combining results from multiple aligners or

317

classifiers

318

The retention of false negative reads – human reads not identified as such – within a

319

nominally ‘pure’ microbial dataset is an ethical and practical concern. We reasoned that for

320

contaminated short (150-300bp) bacterial readsets, for which human reads are not

321

consistently removed (Supplementary Table 2), a two-stage approach – the sequential use

322

of different aligners/classifiers – could map a greater number of reads to the human genome

323

without losing specificity. Accordingly, we re-calculated true positive, false positive and false

324

negative rate after combining the set of classifications made by any two methods. This two-

325

stage approach first classified, and then discarded, ‘human’ reads using one method, and then

326

performed a second round of classification using a second method. In this way, a method

327

with high precision could be supplemented by a method with high sensitivity, maximising the

328

utility of both. For this analysis we excluded three approaches with high positive rates

329

(Figure 1) that were unlikely to provide much added-value (SMALT, and human-only

330

databases with Centrifuge and Kraken). We also restricted this analysis only to bacterial data

331

because our simulations showed that individual methods could discriminate viral from human

332

reads (Supplementary Table 2). The number of reads classified by each pairwise

333

combination of methods are given in Supplementary Table 7, with F-score and false

334

negative rate distributions illustrated in Figure 5.

335
336

While these results broadly recapitulate those of Figure 1, variance in the false negative rate

337

was substantially reduced when combining methods, suggesting that different aligners could

338

compensate for each other’s omissions. This was particularly apparent when combining the

339

two individually poorest-performing aligners in terms of false negative rates in Figure 1B,

340

Novoalign and HISAT, which reduced the median false negative rate of each aligner from

341

approx. 1.5% to 0.18% (Figure 5) (although these were still by far the worst performing

342

method for false negative rates, having little utility as the first method in a two-stage

343

process).

344
345

The optimal combination of methods, in terms of F-score, was Bowtie2 followed by either

346

SNAP or HISAT2. The F-score was 1 for 541 of the 600 Bowtie2/SNAP simulations and 416

347

of the 600 Bowtie2/HISAT2 simulations. Similarly, the false negative rate was 100% for 588

348

of the 600 Bowtie2/SNAP simulations and for 471 of the Bowtie2/HISAT2 simulations,

349

although in both cases the absolute number of false negative calls, if any, was extremely low

350

(< 10 reads; Supplementary Table 7).

351
352

Does it matter if only most, but not all, human reads are removed?

353

In our simulations, relatively few human reads were retained in absolute terms. However, our

354

simulations used relatively low sequencing depths of < 800,000 total reads for each of the 10

355

species (hence, < 80,000 true human reads in any one sample, as detailed in Supplementary

356

Table 1). Although we found that all methods of human read depletion resulted in a

357

consistently small proportion of retained human reads (typically < 0.1%), as sequencing

358

depths increase (concomitant with decreasing cost) this could still be hundreds of human

359

reads in absolute terms. Furthermore, these reads are unlikely to be randomly distributed

360

throughout the human genome, as demonstrated above for the (repetitive) sex chromosomes.

361

Other regions of the human genome may also have similar problems (although we did not

362

directly observe this in our simulations). For instance, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on

363

chromosome 6p21.3 is hypervariable, having > 10% sequence divergence between

364

haplotypes (39). If using a ‘general purpose’ aligner, reads are highly unlikely to map to this

365

region. As such, these reads would be disproportionately retained within a ‘human depleted’

366

bacterial dataset.

367
368

Assuming a sufficient number of reads across a given region, it is possible that variants

369

within it could be called with confidence and used to impute phenotype (for instance, variants

370

in HLA genes have well-documented associations with immune disorders (40)) and/or be

371

associated with named individuals, assuming the identities of those involved in sample

372

preparation were also known. Although anonymising samples is routine practice (and to some

373

extent ameliorates this risk), generators of raw sequencing data frequently waive their own

374

anonymity by virtue of publication. Furthermore, while human variant calls are often filtered

375

on the basis of minimum depth (number of reads covering that position) and base call

376

frequency (proportion of reads supporting a particular allele), in absolute terms this rarely

377

represents large numbers of reads. For instance, the default recommendations applied by the

378

variant calling pipeline NASP (41) are a minimum depth of 10 reads, of which 9 must

379

support a given SNP.

380
381

To demonstrate that these are not just theoretical concerns, we reasoned that the highest-

382

performing method, the Bowtie2/SNAP two-stage approach, would be able to best recover

383

human reads inadvertently retained within public datasets. To test this possibility, we parsed

384

the European Nucleotide Archive to obtain a diverse range of Illumina paired-end genome

385

sequencing reads from each of the 10 bacterial species used in our simulations (see Materials

386

and Methods). In total, we obtained 11,577 SRA sample IDs, representing sequencing data

387

from 356 different BioProjects. From each sample we identified human reads using the two-

388

stage method of Bowtie2/SNAP and then called SNPs – which could be used to predict

389

individual phenotypic characteristics – using a BWA-mem/mpileup pipeline (see Materials

390

and Methods). The results are summarised in Table 2, with the number of human reads

391

detected per sample, and associated phenotypic predictions, given in Supplementary Table

392

8 (in which sample and BioProject IDs are redacted).

393
394

While in absolute terms the number of human reads identified in the 11,577 samples was

395

often low, there were several prominent outliers, with 58 samples (0.5%) containing > 10,000

396

human reads and 299 (2.6%) containing > 1000. Overall, 100 or fewer human reads could be

397

detected in 8321 samples (71.8%), 10 or fewer human reads in 2550 (22.0%), and no human

398

reads in 464 (4.0%). Across the 11,113 samples in which 1 or more human reads were

399

detected, the mean number of reads detected was 1255. With each sample sequenced at a

400

depth of 1-5 million reads, this represents 0.02-0.1% of the number originally sequenced,

401

consistent with our expectation from simulations.

402
403

It is possible to call SNPs even from a limited number of human reads (and so impute

404

phenotype), although we do not expect the majority of calls to be made with high confidence.

405

Without applying any filter criteria, one or more human SNPs could be called from the

406

residual human reads in 7389 (63.8%) of samples (Table 2), although it is reasonable to

407

believe a high error rate. We applied several post-processing criteria to retain only higher-

408

confidence SNPs, requiring each alternative allele to be supported by 2 or more uniquely-

409

mapped reads and to have been previously reported in a major human population (i.e. the

410

SNP is considered ‘common’; see Materials and Methods). After applying these criteria,

411

SNPs could still be called in 731 samples (6.3%) (Table 2).

412
413

From these higher-confidence SNPs, it was possible to impute particular phenotypes. For

414

instance, in 13 samples (0.1%), one or more ‘common’ SNPs were called that were also

415

recorded in the ClinVar database (42). While these SNPs were all considered ‘benign’ or

416

‘likely benign’ (Supplementary Table 8), this is likely because SNPs with pathological

417

clinical significance are uncommon (i.e., this subset of ClinVar SNPs would not meet the

418

dbSNP definition of ‘common’, which is based on minor allele frequency; see Materials and

419

Methods). By relaxing this requirement, we found 191 samples (1.6%) with one or more

420

SNPs supported by multiple uniquely-mapped reads and which were present in ClinVar but

421

not also ‘common’ (Table 2). Within this subset, we found three samples with SNPs

422

indicative of adverse drug responses (ClinVar variant IDs 12351, 17503 and 37340) and 19

423

samples with pathological SNPs, including hereditary predisposition to various cancers

424

(including breast and ovarian), polycystic kidney disease and Leber’s optic atrophy

425

(Supplementary Table 8).

426
427

These analyses of real data are broad in scope and intended to illustrate a general point: that

428

phenotypes can be imputed from even a small number of reads. Overall, these results

429

establish that phenotypically distinct human sequence is widespread in publicly archived

430

bacterial data.

431
432

Nevertheless, for the majority of samples, a low number of SNP calls may only be minimally

433

informative. As only a proportion of reads will contain SNPs, we can suggest a reasonably

434

broad level of tolerance for the number of human reads retained within a real bacterial sample

435

(although still advocating as exhaustive an approach to their removal as possible). Across all

436

11,577 samples, we made 12,215 higher-confidence SNP calls (those where the alternative

437

allele was supported by 2 or more uniquely-mapped reads), of which 2063 were also

438

‘common’ (Supplementary Table 8), i.e. more likely to be annotated with phenotypic

439

characteristics. We found that on a per-sample basis, fewer than 10 ‘common’ SNPs could be

440

called with reasonable confidence from samples containing up to 10,000 human reads

441

(Figure 6). While this suggests a relatively large number of human reads could be retained in

442

a microbial dataset without being unduly informative, it is important to note that individual

443

SNPs (which could still be clinically significant) could also be called with confidence even at

444

far lower depths (< 100 reads; see Figure 6). Furthermore, there is already a substantial body

445

of overt phenotypic associations with single SNPs, including, for instance, blue eyes (43),

446

lactose intolerance (44) and alcohol-related flushing (45).

447
448

Recommendations for depleting human reads from microbial datasets

449

If using shorter (150-330bp) bacterial reads, then to maximise the number of human reads

450

whilst minimising the risk of false positive calls, we recommended using Bowtie2 (which

451

performs near-exact read mapping, optimising parameters where appropriate to account for

452

read length), followed by either of the aligners SNAP or HISAT2. Our analyses suggest that

453

these aligners could complement each other and so the cost of using two methods

454

sequentially would be incurred only in additional computational time, not in reduced

455

accuracy. The individual methods with lowest false negative rates (that is, those which

456

successfully detected the majority of human reads) were BWA-mem and Kraken2, although

457

these methods both had relatively high false positive rates and so could erroneously classify

458

bacterial reads as human. This was particularly apparent for genomes rich in mobile

459

elements, such as C. difficile.

460
461

Classification accuracy was strongly affected by read length, particularly when using

462

alignment-based methods (Figure 3). We found that when sequencing viral reads or bacterial

463

reads of > 300bp, the most accurate, as well as simplest and quickest, approach was to use

464

direct classification methods (Centrifuge and Kraken2). Although runtime was not formally

465

assessed in this study, we noted that classification-based methods were far faster to complete

466

than alignment-based human read detection. Importantly, and irrespective of the speed of a

467

given aligner, ‘alignment’ is in practice a multi-step process, requiring the subsidiary steps of

468

BAM sorting, BAM indexing, BAM subsetting and read ID extraction (that is, converting

469

BAM to BED). This approach is intrinsically slower than the use of either Kraken2 or

470

Centrifuge, and so these methods could be preferred for shorter reads if speed is a

471

consideration: Kraken2 having the lower false negative rate, and Centrifuge the lower false

472

positive rate (for longer reads, we found no discernible difference).

474

An additional benefit of Kraken2 and Centrifuge are that their databases can easily be

475

customised to contain multiple human genomes rather than a singular reference (of which the

476

current human reference is essentially an idiosyncratic type specimen (46)). This approach

477

would expand the number of human k-mers (against which k-mers from the reads are

478

compared) to include those from divergent regions, such as the HLA, and could also

479

incorporate population-specific sequence (for example, recent deep sequencing of 910

480

individuals of African descent identified 296 Mb of sequence missing from the GRCh38

481

reference (47)). Reads originating from population-specific regions would not be identifiable

482

using either of the approaches tested in this study. An additional complication with

483

alignment-based, relative to classification-based, methods is that as divergence increases

484

relative to a reference the number of reads correctly mapped to the reference will decrease, as

485

previously demonstrated for influenza A (48). While in our simulations, viral reads (including

486

from influenza A) could be consistently mapped to the same reference genome from which

487

they were sequenced, we would not expect this to be as pronounced for non-simulated reads

488

(that is, where the genome from which the reads were derived diverges from the reference).

489
490

Alignment-based methods can, however, allow a finer degree of discrimination than

491

classification-based methods. An alternative alignment-based approach would be to align

492

reads (that are nominally from one bacterium) not just to the human genome but to the human

493

and bacterial references simultaneously, as in the ‘remove contamination’ module of

494

Clockwork (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/clockwork), a pipeline developed for the

495

CRyPTIC project to process reads from M. tuberculosis. Should reads have multiple mapping

496

locations, this can allow finer discrimination between human and non-human sequence. If a

497

read, or one mate of a pair of reads, maps both to the human and microbial genomes, the user

498

can decide whether to consider those reads as human or microbial in origin, so maximising

499

either the number of human (or human-like) reads removed or the number of microbial (or

500

microbial-like) reads retained.

501
502

In terms of memory requirements, while both classifiers drew upon reasonably large

503

databases (approx. 8Gb in each case), aligners also required a pre-built index of the (approx.

504

3Gb) human genome as input. These indices varied 10-fold in size, from 2.3 Gb (SMALT) to

505

4.0 Gb (Bowtie2), 4.3 Gb (HISAT2), 5.1 Gb (BWA), 6.9 Gb (Minimap2), 8.1 Gb

506

(Novoalign), 12.9 Gb (GEM) and 28.9 Gb (SNAP). One of the highest-performing methods

507

in this study, Bowtie2 followed by SNAP, accordingly had among the largest runtime and

508

memory requirements.

509
510

Nevertheless, it is important to take an exhaustive approach to depleting human reads from

511

bacterial datasets. This is because as variant databases increase in scope and volume, it

512

should become increasingly likely that personally-identifiable phenotypic characteristics

513

could be recovered from a small number of reads. This study has demonstrated that the

514

subtractive alignment of human reads, if using only one aligner to do so, will likely be

515

insufficient. Further to this, it remains a strong possibility that there is endemic, albeit low

516

level, human read contamination of (older) bacterial datasets in public archives.

From each bacterial genome, 3 sets of 150bp and 300bp paired-end short reads (characteristic

simulated with an insert size of ((read length * 2) + (read length * 0.2)), i.e. 150bp reads were

simulated with an insert size of 330bp. dwgsim does not output the otherwise randomly

541

read length: 123456789, 234567891, and 345678912, respectively. The number of reads

542

sequenced for each genome is equivalent to a mean base level coverage of 10-fold (for

543

bacteria) or 100-fold (for viruses), detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

544
545

To each of these microbial readsets was added a number of human reads equivalent to

546

between 1 and 10% of the microbial reads, at increments of 1%. All human reads were

547

simulated from either GRCh38.p12 or GRCh37.p13 and used the same dwgsim seeds and

548

parameters as above. Notably, dwgsim assigns read names on the basis of their origin. In this

549

way, we can easily determine which of a set of reads predicted to be either human or

550

microbial are correctly classified: true microbial reads will have names corresponding to

551

microbial chromosome IDs.

552
553

Methods for detecting human read content

554

Two basic methods were used for detecting human reads within the contaminated microbial

555

datasets: by alignment of all reads against the human genome, and by predicting read origin

556

using the taxonomic classification tools Centrifuge v1.0.4 (19) and Kraken2 v2.0.7 (20).

557

Alignments were performed using BWA-mem v0.7.17 (23), Bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 (49), GEM

558

v3.6.1-16 (24), HISAT2 v2.1.0 (25), minimap2 v2.10-r773 (26), Novoalign v3.09.00

559

(www.novocraft.com), SMALT v0.7.6 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0), and

560

SNAP v1.0beta.18 (27), in all cases with default parameters. All alignments were made

561

against 2 different builds of the human genome: the primary assembly of GRCh38.p12

562

(corresponding to GenBank assembly ID GCA_000001405.27 and obtained from Ensembl

563

v96), and the primary assembly of GRCh37.p13 (corresponding to GenBank assembly ID

564

GCA_000001405.14 and obtained from Ensembl v75).

565
566

In each case, BAM files were cleaned, sorted and duplicate-marked using Picard Tools

567

v2.17.11 CleanSam, SortSam and MarkDuplicates, respectively (50). Supplementary and

568

non-primary alignments were removed using SAMtools view v1.7 (51) with parameters -F

569

2048 -F 256. Finally, we obtained the set of reads mapped by each aligner (that is, considered

570

human) using SAMtools view with parameters -F 4 -f 8, -F 8 -f 4, and -F 12, merging the

571

resulting BAMs. This was in order to obtain reads where both ends mapped as well as the set

572

of mapped reads with an unmapped mate, as the latter, being from the same DNA fragment,

573

should also be of human origin. Read IDs were extracted from each BAM using the

574

‘bamToBed’ module of BEDtools v2.19.1 (52).

By contrast, the classification tools Centrifuge and Kraken compare sets of reads to a

576

database of genomes, probabilistically assigning a taxonomic rank to each read. For both

tools, we used one database containing only the human (GRCh38) genome and one

containing the set of RefSeq bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes, plus the human genome.

Human read detection in real sequencing data

588

To test for the presence of human reads in real bacterial sequencing data, we downloaded the

589

daily-updated SRA BioProject summary file (n = 383,590 BioProjects;

590

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/summary.txt, accessed 24th September 2019) and parsed

591

it to extract a list of BioProject IDs with a data type of ‘genome sequencing’ and a species

592

name matching, at least in part, the name of any of the 10 clinically common bacteria detailed

593

in Supplementary Table 1 (for example, ‘Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar

594

Oranienburg str. 0250’ matches ‘Salmonella enterica’). We then used the Entrez Direct suite

595

of utilities (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/, accessed 1st May 2019) to

596

associate each BioProject ID with a list of SRA sample and run IDs (a ‘RunInfo’ file).

597

RunInfo files were parsed to retain only those runs where ‘Platform’ was ‘ILLUMINA’,

598

‘Model’ (i.e. sequencer) was ‘HiSeq 2000’, ‘HiSeq 2500’ or ‘MiSeq’ (all of which use

599

TruSeq3 reagent chemistry), ‘LibrarySource’ was ‘GENOMIC’ or ‘METAGENOMIC’,

600

‘LibraryStrategy’ was ‘WGS’, ‘LibraryLayout’ was ‘PAIRED’, ‘LibrarySelection’ was

601

‘RANDOM’, ‘avgLength’ was ≥ 150 (i.e., mean read length of 150bp) and ‘spots’ was > 1

602

and < 5 (i.e., approximating a read depth of > 1 and < 5 million reads, the upper limit chosen

603

to minimise the computational cost of data processing). This generated a list of 11,577 SRA

604

sample IDs, representing sequencing data from 356 different BioProjects.

605
606

From each sample, human reads were classified using the two-stage approach of Bowtie2

607

followed by SNAP (detailed above). These reads were extracted from the original fastq files

608

using the ‘subseq’ module of seqtk v1.3 (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) and aligned to the

609

human genome (GRCh38.p12) using BWA-mem v0.7.17 with default parameters (BWA was

610

chosen as it was among the most sensitive aligners tested). The resulting BAMs were post-

611

processed using Picard Tools to clean and duplicate-mark (as above), with the subset of

612

mapped reads obtained using SAMtools view v1.7 with parameter -F 4. SNPs were called

613

using BCFtools mpileup (51) with parameters -A (do not discard anomalous read pairs, i.e.

614

include singleton ‘orphan’ reads) and -B (disable probabilistic realignment for the

615

computation of base alignment quality scores). These parameters were chosen so as to

616

maximise the likelihood of SNP calling at extremely low depth, with the intention that lower-

617

confidence calls could later be identified (see below).

618
619

The resulting VCF was annotated using BCFtools ‘annotate’ to assign dbSNP IDs, where

620

available, to those positions already known to be bona fide human SNPs. For this purpose, we

621

obtained two sets of known human SNPs: those with clinical assertions, which are included

622

in ClinVar (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh38/clinvar_20191013.vcf.gz,

623

accessed 21st October 2019), and the set of dbSNP ‘common SNPs’

624

(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/common_all_20180418.vcf.gz,

625

accessed 21st October 2019). ‘Common’ SNPs are defined as having both a germline origin

626

and a minor allele frequency of ≥ 0.01 in at least 1 of 26 major human populations (according

627

to the 1000 Genomes Project (53);

628

https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/population), with at least two unrelated

629

individuals having the minor allele

630

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/, accessed 21st October

631

2019).

632
633

Finally, higher-confidence human SNPs were considered those which had (a) ≥ 2 reads

634

supporting the alternative allele (these counts were obtained from the DP4 field of the

635

mpileup VCF, and automatically exclude low-quality bases [by default, those with Phred <

636

13]), (b) QUAL value ≥ 20, (c) MAPQ value of 60 (used by BWA to indicate unique

637

mapping), and (d) could be assigned a ‘common’ dbSNP ID.

638
639

Evaluation metrics

640

For each method of human read detection, we obtained the number of true positive (TP;

641

human read classified as human), false positive (FP; bacterial read classified as human) and

642

false negative (FN; human read not classified as human) read classifications. We then

643

calculated the precision (positive predictive value) of each method as TP/(TP+FP), recall

644

(sensitivity) as TP/(TP+FN), and as an ‘overall performance’ measure, the F-score (as in

645

(30)), which equally weights precision and recall: F = 2 * ((precision * recall) / (precision +

646

recall)). The F-score summarises the performance of each method as a value bound between

647

0 and 1 (perfect precision and recall).

648
649

Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment

650

GO term enrichment was assessed using the R/Bioconductor package topGO v2.36.0, which

651

implements the ‘weight’ algorithm to account for the nested structure of the GO tree (54).

652

This is a closed testing procedure – the computation of p-values per GO term is conditional

653

on the neighbouring terms, and so the tests are not independent. For this reason, p-values

654

produced by the ‘weight’ algorithm are interpreted as corrected or not affected by multiple

655

testing. topGO requires a reference set of GO terms as input. These were built from the

656

GRCh38.p12 and GRCh37.p13 sets (obtained via Ensembl BioMart versions 96 and 75,

657

respectively), each filtered to remove terms with evidence codes ‘NAS’ (non-traceable author

658

statement) and ‘ND’ (no biological data available), and those assigned to fewer than 10 genes

659

in total. Significantly enriched GO terms (p<0.05) were retained only if the observed

660

number in each set of ‘false negative genes’ exceeded the expected number by 2-fold or

661

greater.

these methods have a very high false positive rate across all species (Figure 1). Data from
