ABSTRACT

24

Many physiological processes of living organisms show circadian rhythms, governed by an endogenous clock. This

25

clock has a genetic basis and is entrained by external cues such as light and temperature. Other physiological

26

processes exhibit seasonal rhythms, that are also responsive to light and temperature. We previously reported a

27

natural latitudinal cline of photoperiodic diapause induction in the parasitic wasp

28

and a correlated haplotype frequency for the circadian clock gene

29

reflected in circadian behaviour, we investigated circadian locomotor activity of seven populations from the cline.

30

We found that the proportion of rhythmic males is higher than females in constant darkness, and that mating

31

decreased rhythmicity of both sexes. Only for virgin females, the free running period ( ) increased weakly with

32

latitude. Wasps from the most southern locality had an overall shorter free running rhythm and earlier onset, peak

33

and offset of activity during the 24 h period, than wasps from the northernmost locality. We evaluate this variation

INTRODUCTION

38

The daily rotation of the Earth around its axis causes oscillating photoperiods that have led to the evolution of a

39

large variety of activity patterns of organisms. Many behavioural and physiological activities, like mating, feeding

40

and resting, show distinct oscillating rhythms with a peak of activity at a specific moment during the light-dark (LD)

41

cycle. These are driven by an endogenous clock that is reset daily (entrained) by the prevailing LD cycles and runs

42

with an intrinsic period of approximately 24 hours in constant darkness (DD) (Pittendrigh et al., 1991). The length

43

of this endogenous rhythm is called the

for

season-dependent

45

behaviours, like migration in birds, hibernation in mammals and diapause in insects (reviewed in Bradshaw and

46

Holzapfel, 2007). Additionally, daily photoperiods depend on latitude, being almost constant near the equator and

47

increasing in yearly variation towards higher latitudes. Hence, depending on latitude, organisms will experience

48

different photoperiods over the year. Given the sensitivity of the circadian clock to light-dark fluctuations, it is

49

conceivable that it also plays a role in seasonal rhythmicity (Bunning, 1960). There is accumulating evidence for a

50

role of the circadian clock genes in photoperiodism in many species (Dalla Benetta et al., 2019; Koštál, 2011; Mukai

51

and Goto, 2016; Saunders, 2010; Urbanová et al., 2016) and several studies have shown that seasonal responses

52

differ geographically as a result of variation in photoperiodic conditions (Hut et al., 2013). Nevertheless, it is still

53

unclear whether the observed natural variation in photoperiodic response is controlled by specific circadian clock

54

properties as a whole, such as the pace and the phase of the endogenous clock or by pleiotropy of individual clock

55

genes (Dalla Benetta et al., 2019; Hut and Beersma, 2011)

56

Larval diapause of the parasitoid

is maternally induced following a certain number of

57

days (switch point) at a given critical photoperiod (CPP) and shows a robust clinal photoperiodic response (Paolucci

58

et al., 2013; Saunders, 2013). Apparently, a clock mechanism is responsible for the timing and counting of the light-

To study variation in locomotor activity in

field collected populations (Paolucci et al., 2013). These lines originated from seven European sampling locations

79

mass culture vials under LD 18:06, 20 ± 1°C, to minimise diapause induction. For establishing free running periods

80

under constant darkness (DD) 17-25 isofemale lines from each location and 4-8 individuals from each isofemale

81

line were used (797 females and 715 males). As some individuals died before all data were collected, only 1072

82

individuals could be used for locomotor activity analysis: 548 females (163 virgin and 385 mated) and 544 males

(122 virgin and 402 mated).

Data analysis and statistics

100

The raw locomotor activity data were first visualized with the program ActogramJ (Schmid et al., 2011); available at

101

http://actogramj.neurofly.de. Double-plot actograms obtained with this software were eye inspected and dead

102

animals were omitted from further analysis. Under constant darkness (DD) it was possible to measure the period

103

of activity ( ) with periodogram analysis available in ActogramJ, which incorporates chi-square test (Sokolove and

104

Bushell, 1978). Linear mixed effect models were used to test the effect of location, latitude, sex and mating status

Under LD conditions the average activity was calculated as described by (Schlichting and Helfrich-Förster,

109

2015). The first 4 days of entrainment were excluded from the analysis. To determine the onset and offset of

110

activity on each day data per wasp have to be plotted as bar diagrams with each bar representing the sum of

111

activity within 20 min. The onset represents the first time when activity starts to rise consecutively, whereas the

112

offset is when activity reaches the level, which is stable during the night phase. To determine the timing of the

113

peaks, the data are smoothed by a moving average of 30 min. Through this process, randomly occurring spikes are

114

reduced and the real maximum of the activity can be determined. The average phase of the onset, peak and offset,

Activity timing

165

Virgin females from 5 isogenic lines established from populations of the two extremes of the sampling range were

166

exposed to a light-dark regime of either LD16:08 or LD08:16h for 4 days. Under LD16:08, both southern and

167

northern wasps displayed a unimodal activity pattern (Fig. 4), but with significant differences in the timing of

168

onset, peak and offset of activity (Table 1, Table S1). Southern wasps started activity on average around ZT 0,

169

which is about two hours earlier than northern wasps (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S1). Southern wasps displayed

170

maximum activity around ZT 5, while northern wasps peaked at ZT 8 (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S1). Offset of activity

171

was around ZT 13 and ZT 16 for southern and northern wasps, respectively (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S1). Thus,

172

southern wasps were more active in the first half of the light period and northern wasps towards the end of the

173

day.

174

Under shorter photoperiod LD08:16 southern wasps started their activity also earlier than northern wasps

175

(Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S2). Onset of activity occurred when the light was still off, around ZT 21.5. Northern wasps

176

became active at ZT 0 (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S2). The peaks of activity differed of about one-and-half hour, at ZT 2.5

177

and ZT 4 for southern and northern wasps, respectively (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S2). Offset of activity was at ZT 8 for

178

southern wasps. Northern wasps prolonged activity for more than two hours into darkness, until ZT 10.5 on

179

average (Fig. 4, Table 1, Table S2). Thus, under both light regimes there is a difference in phase of activity between

180

southern and northern wasps. The consequence is that in short photoperiod, southern wasps start activity in the

181

dark and finish in the light phase, whereas northern wasps start activity at the beginning of the light phase and

182

continue in the dark. Additionally, we observed a positive correlation (R2 = 0.51;

183

model) between the activity phase and free running rhythm of the wasps (Fig. S1).

P

< 2e-16, linear mixed effect

184

In agreement with the results obtained for the isofemale lines, the southern and northern isogenic lines

185

differed in τ under constant conditions (Fig. 4, Table1). The average free-running period of southern wasps was

186

24.3 ± 0.1h, which differed significantly from the longer τ of 26.7 ± 0.1h of the northern ones (

P

< 0.001).

generally high, we observed significant differences between females and males: males are on average more

209

rhythmic than females and have shorter free-running periods ( ). Similar differences between both sexes were

210

observed by Floessner et al., (2019) and in the laboratory strain

211

individuals of both sexes are highly rhythmic in constant darkness. The difference in rhythmicity between males

212

and females is more apparent in mated individuals. Moreover, mated males maintain a high level of rhythmicity

213

(although lower compared to virgin males), whereas most females lose their internal rhythmicity after mating.

214

Similar effects of mating status on rhythmicity were found in the ant species

215

ovipositing queens exhibited arrhythmic locomotor activity during the egg laying phase and restored rhythmicity

216

afterwards (Sharma et al., 2004). In addition, we found a significant interaction between locality and mating status

217

on proportion of rhythmic individuals; for example, the effect of mating status in females of the SWI population is

218

larger than in the SCH population. This might reflect standing genetic variation for rhythmic behaviour within and

219

among populations. It is also possible that environmental factors affect the rhythmic locomotor activity as was

220

recently shown for the northern fly species

221

was higher at lower temperature (Kauranen et al., 2012). It would be worthwhile to investigate how environmental

222

conditions (temperature and light intensity among others) influence circadian locomotor activity behaviour of

223

males and females in more insect species and test whether the level of variability will differ between populations

224

from different geographical regions. Such studies could reveal differential selection pressures for stability of the
