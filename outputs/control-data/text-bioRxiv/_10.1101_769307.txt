Abstract

biological processes and pathologies such as cancer [1, 2]. By binding the complementary sequence
of the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), miRNAs
repress their target mRNA gene expression [3]. Despite the widespread changes they have on the protein levels,single miRNAs typically induce modest
repression on their targets [4]. Cooperation among
miRNAs is one strategy to boost their activity.
This cooperativity can be realized in the form of
multiple miRNAs collectively co-regulating a cohort of genes that are part of a functional module, or multiple miRNAs can jointly co-target an
individual gene to achieve cooperative control of a
target gene (reviewed in [5]). In this work, we focus
on the latter case.
There is a substantial amount of experimental
evidence on the cooperativity of miRNAs to target an individual gene where a stronger degree of
regulation is achieved with multiple miRNAs than
is possible by the single miRNAs. Enright et al.
[6] are the first to show the cooperativity of lin–
4 and let–7 in Drosophila experimentally. Krek et
al. [7] find that in a murine pancreatic cell line
that miR–375, miR–124, and let–7b cooperate to
repress the MTPN gene. Similarly, Lai et al. [8]
reports synergistic interaction of miR–93 and miR–
572 in repressing the p21 gene in human SK–Mel–
147 melanoma cells. Yang et al. [9] shows that
miR–17–5p and miR–17–3p can synergistically induce prostate tumor growth and invasion by repressing the same target TIMP3. Others also show
similar lines of evidence on the synergistic interactions of miRNAs to regulate a mutual target
[10, 14, 13, 12, 11].
Despite the accumulating evidence, our understanding of synergistic miRNAs is still rudimentary.

Although miRNAs can cause widespread changes
on expression programs, single miRNAs typically
induce mild repression on their targets. Cooperativity is reported as one strategy to overcome this
constraint. Expanding the catalog of synergistic
miRNAs is critical for understanding the regulation of various gene expression programs. In this
study, we develop miRCoop to identify synergistic
miRNA pairs which have weak or no repression on
the target mRNA, but when bound together induce
strong repression of their target’s expression. To
discover triplets of RNAs whose expression levels
follow these statistical interaction patterns, miRCoop uses kernel-based interaction tests together
with miRNA and mRNA target information. We
apply our approach to kidney tumor and identify
66 putative triplets. For 64 of these triplets, there
is at least one common transcription factor that
potentially regulates all participating RNAs of the
triplet supporting a functional association among
them. Furthermore, we find triplets are enriched
for biological processes, which are relevant to kidney cancer. Some of the synergistic miRNAs are
very closely encoded in the genome hinting a functional association among them. We believe miRCoop can aid our understanding of the complex
regulatory interactions in different health and disease states of the cell.

Determining which pairs of miRNAs can synergize
and which gene is the target of this cooperativity
is critical for understanding how miRNAs function
and how they regulate various gene expression programs. Furthermore, synergism can be exploited in
designing miRNA based therapeutics as pointed in
a recent survey by [11]. Single miRNA treatments
require high amounts of miRNAs, which can provoke off-target effects while therapeutics based on
synergistic miRNAs have the potential to overcome
these unintended effects by enabling lower levels of
each of the miRNAs to be administered [11].

focus on a specific type of synergistic relationship:
the miRNA pairs which have weak or no repression on the target mRNA but when together induce
strong repression of the expression. Note that this
does not cover all the synergistic relationships, i.e.,
the case where miRNAs have moderate expression
themselves can also be in a synergistic relationship.
We focus on this specific case as it is statistically
more realistic to find. Additionally, it can uncover
more novel RNAs that are important for a disease
or condition which cannot be captured by merely
checking the miRNAs individual effect.
We cast the problem of finding such triplets as
a statistical dependence discovery problem. Using
matched miRNA and mRNA expression data and
considering the expression level of each miRNA and
mRNA as a random variable, miRCoop finds a specific three-way statistical interaction among these
random variables. Here, the pairs of miRNAs have
weak or no statistical dependence with the mRNAs,
yet when taken jointly they are dependent with the
mRNA. This case is similar to the example wherein
adding sugar to coffee or stirring the coffee alone
have weak or no effect on the coffee’s sweetness, but
the joint presence of the two has a strong effect [30].
To test whether the triplets of RNAs have such relationships, we resort to the kernelized Lancaster
three-variable interaction developed by [30]. This
test relies on mapping the probability distributions
into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS),
which is a powerful approach in machine learning
(reviewed in [31]). The kernel trick helps us to deal
with small samples sizes for the expression profiles
available, and due to its non-parametric nature, it
also avoids any distributional assumptions. In addition to the expression profiles, miRCoop make
use of the putative target information among the
miRNAs and mRNAs.
We apply miRCoop to kidney cancer using tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) project. This analysis discovers 66 putative triplets. We use several validation strategies
to check the existence of a regulatory relationship
among the triplets’ participants. Investigating the
triplets RNAs reveal that most of them are individually associated with kidney cancer, as well. Furthermore, we observe that some miRNA pairs are
encoded very close on the genome hinting a tight
regulation at the genome level and supporting a
functional link among these miRNAs. To check

Several computational methods exist in the literature to aid our understanding of the cooperative miRNAs. However, the majority of these inspect the cooperativity of miRNAs in regulating a
set of genes which are part of a functional module [23, 25, 16, 17, 15, 24, 21, 20, 18, 22, 19]. On
the other hand, there are only a few computational
methods for discovering synergistic miRNAs that
co-target the same mRNA. Among these methods,
Hon et al. [26] analyze multiple miRNAs targeting a single gene, but their analysis solely relied
on finding common targets of miRNAs by analyzing the miRNA–mRNA interactions derived from
target prediction algorithms. TriplexRNA [27] is a
computational framework that integrates miRNA
target prediction, structure prediction, molecular
dynamics simulations, and mathematical modeling methods to find synergistic miRNAs and their
mutual targets. CancerNet [22] detects candidate
cooperative miRNA pairs based on the functional
similarity of the targets and the proximity of the
miRNA targets in the protein-protein interactions
for a given cancer. Neither of these methods takes
into account the expression profiles of the RNAs.
Finally, Zhang et al. [28] apply causal inference
methods to find synergistic pairs where miRNA’s
knockout is simulated using gene expressipon data
to discover synergistic miRNAs and in a more recent study [29] extend this work to incorporate the
simulation of multiple knockouts of miRNAs.
In this study, we develop miRCoop for detecting
synergistic miRNAs and their mutual targets. We

other coordinated regulatory evidence, we investigate whether a shared transcription factor potentially coordinates the miRNAs and RNAs, and interestingly, we observe that this holds for almost
all identified triplets. When we explore the relevance of the identified triplets to kidney cancer, our

We consider only the miRNA–mRNA pairs that are
predicted by both algorithms. The triplets where
miRNA pairs have an overlapping binding site on
the target mRNA are also excluded.
Although the target information prunes many
combinations, at the end of this step, there is still
an extensive list of candidate triplets. For example,
when we apply to kidney cancer(see Results), there
are 31, 184 potentially interacting miRNA–mRNA
pairs, and there are 163, 550 candidate miRNA–
miRNA–mRNA triplets.

METHODS

2.2

miRCoop relies on miRNA–mRNA target predictions and kernel statistical tests on the expression
data. The overall pipeline of miRCoop is summarized in Figure 1. The first step curates a list of possible triplets based on miRNA target predictions
and their predicted mRNAs. In the second step,
the candidate triplets are pruned based on expression data. In the final stage, we test the remaining
triplets for the statistical dependence relationships.
Below, we detail these three steps. Following the
miRCoop descriptions, we provide information on
the null model used for triplets and the data collection and pre-processing steps when miRCoop is
applied to kidney cancer.

2.1

miRCoop Step 2:
Filter

Expression

We further narrow down the candidate list based
on the expression profiles of the miRNAs and mRNAs measured over a set of samples, Figure 1 (Step
2). miRNAs repress the expression of their target mRNA genes. Therefore, we expect that if
both miRNAs are upregulated, the mRNA expression will be lower compared to the case where both
miRNAs are down-regulated. To filter for triplets
where this expression pattern holds, we divide the
samples into different expression subgroups based
on the expression states of the potential synergistic miRNA pairs. The first group comprises the
samples where both miRNAs are upregulated, and
the second group is the subset of samples where
both miRNAs are downregulated. In this analysis,
miRNA expression in a sample is considered upregulated if it is in the fourth quartile of all samples,
and it is deemed to be downregulated if it is in the
first quartile. Having grouped the samples, for every triplet in the candidate list, we check whether
the mRNA expression levels are significantly lower
than the mRNA expression levels compared to the
second group. To test for significance, we apply the
one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test [34]. This test is
used to determine whether two groups of expression values are selected from populations having
the same mRNA expression distribution. We apply this test to the all possible triplets formed at
the end of Step 1 and retain only those for which
the null hypothesis is rejected at 0.05 significance
level.

miRCoop Step 1: Identifying
Candidate miRNA–mRNA Target Interactions

miRCoop first identifies pairs of miRNA that can
bind to a common target mRNA (Figure 1 Step 1).
A pair of miRNAs and their mutual target mRNA
constitute a candidate triplet. As the interactions
of newly cataloged miRNAs are not included in experimentally validated miRNA target interaction
databases, we resort to available target prediction
algorithms. For this, we use TargetScan [32] and
miRanda [33]. When using TargetScan, the 6–mer
sites predictions are filtered since they are classified as poorly conserved [32]. Similarly, when running miRanda, to reduce false-positive predictions,
we apply stringent parameter settings (a pairing
score of > 155 and an energy score of < −20).

using permutation-based approach where the indices of the variables are shuffled [30]. Sejdinovic
et al. [30] formulates a kernel based three-variable
Lancaster interaction test by embedding the probability distributions into reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RHKS). In their general formulation, the
three variables to be tested form a random vector
of triplets (X, Y, Z) ∈ Rp × Rp × Rp , where p is the
dimension. In our case p = 1.
The effectiveness of embedding probability distributions are demonstrated in different machine
learning and inference task (reviewed in [36] and
[31]). The key idea of is to implicitly map probability distributions into potentially infinite dimensional feature spaces using kernel functions [37].
Kernel embedding of the probability distributions
avoids the restrictive assumptions about the form of
the distributions such as, variables to be discretevalued, or assumptions about the form of the relationships among the variables such as linear relationship between variables [36]. Using the kernel
trick, instead of constructing the new feature space,
computations on the probability distributions can
be calculated implicitly via feature space operations, that is as Gram matrix operations. The probabilities can be expressed as certain expectations of
kernel functions. Sejdinovic et al. [30] arrives at
the following test statistic for the two variable and
three-variable dependency test:

2.3.2

Applying Kernel-based Interaction
Tests

We form a random vector of triplets (X, Y, Z) ∈
R × R × R. In the pairwise interaction tests, where
we test for independence of miRNA expression levels with the mRNA (X-Y and X-Z), we consider
triplets where the pairwise independence test fails
to be rejected (α = 0.01). For the three-variable
independence interaction test, we only consider
triplets, where the null hypothesis of the three variable interaction is rejected (α = 0.01). We use the
Gaussian kernel as defined:

2
− kxi − xj k2
(5)
k(xi , xj ) = exp
2σ 2
, where σ is a non-negative real number that determines the width of the kernel. We set σusing the
median heuristic [38]. In both tests, the null distribution is estimated by repeatedly permuting the
indices of the mRNA expressions of the samples (Z
variable), where we set the number of permutations
to 2, 000.

2.4

The Null Model for miRCoop
Triplets

Having identified the triplets, to check the validity of different comparisons with the biological
data, we use a random sampling-based approach
to obtain a random set of triplets that constitutes the null model. We use these randomized
triplets to obtain an empirical null distribution
of the test statistic of interest in each case. We
construct the randomized triplets as follows: let
S = t1 , t2 , ..., tn be the set of miRCoop triplets
identified. Let the i-th triplet member of S denoted by ti = (xi , yi , zi ), which include the miRNA
pairs, xi , yi and the mRNA zi . We sample a collection of B random triplet sets of each with size
m. Let S b = {tb1 , tb2 , . . . , tbn } denote the b-th random triplet set. For the b-th sampling, tbi is generated as follows: the mRNA zi is retrieved, and
one miRNA pair of the triplet (xi or yi ) is selected at random and retained, the paired miRNA

Functional Enrichment Analysis 4

DISCUSSION

In this work, we focus on miRNAs that regulate a
target gene directly that is those that simultaneously bind to the target. There are other ways in
which pairs of miRNAs regulate a common target.
For example, while one miRNA targets the gene
of interest directly, another miRNA can target the
transcription factor that regulates this gene [5, 28].
In this case, one miRNA is acting directly on the
target, and the partner miRNA is acting indirectly
through the transcription factor. An additional line
of future work would be to extend miRCoop to discover these multi-level regulatory interactions.
Since there are no synergistic interaction datasets
which are readily available, we devise various
strategies to check if the identified triplets and the
individual RNAs are implicated in kidney cancer
and have any biological evidence supporting a functional theme or regulatory interaction among themselves. When experimentally validated synergistic
miRNA pairs become available, the analysis can be
further improved in the light of the ground truth
interactions. For example, we set the kernel width
using the median heuristic, but the width could be
tuned when an extensive set of ground truth interactions become available.
In the present study, to establish target relations
between the miRNA and the mRNAs, we use two
target prediction algorithms. We resort to prediction algorithms because newly cataloged miRNAs
– which is valid for the TCGA profile miRNAs
– are not incorporated in the experimentally validated miRNA target interaction datasets. To reduce the number of false positives, we only consider
target interactions that are supported by both algorithms concurrently. The availability of experimentally validated miRNA–mRNA interactions should
strengthen the outlined methodology. The number
of synergistic triplets can be adjusted by changing the significance levels applied in the statistical
tests. For example, in a scenario where a large number of interactions can be verified experimentally at
scale, these settings can be adjusted to output more
triplets.
Although we present results for kidney cancer,
the method can be applied to other diseases as well
as healthy cells. The method can be extended to
work with other species other than human whenever the expression profiles of matched miRNAs

Synergistic miRNAs are likely to regulate genes
with the same or similar functions [24]. To investigate the potential biological process related to the
synergistic miRNAs, we conduct a functional enrichment analysis on them. To this end, we first
build a miRNA–miRNA–mRNA network. In this
network, nodes are miRNAs and mRNAs, and an
edge exists between two RNAs whenever they are
connected through at least one miRCoop triplet.
A connected components analysis reveals that the
network includes 13 connected components. Interestingly, the largest connected component covers a very large fraction of the all miRNAs: of
the 75 miRNAs that is part of the triplets, 41
of them were in this largest connected component
(p − value0.032) (Figure 7a) indicating that the cooperative miRNAs are directly or indirectly linked
to each other through their targets.
A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis reveals that the set of mRNAs are enriched in processes that are associated with kidney cancer. For
example, metabolic networks such as the receptor
metabolic processes, the negative regulation of hydrolase activity, and the regulation of metal ion
transport are all found to be enriched (Figure 7b).
Among these, sodium and guanylate related processes are particularly reported as important in
kidney cancer [59, 61, 60]. Also, the genes that
are already known as the drivers of renal cancer
are annotated with these processes. An example is
Angiomotin (AMOT). Lv et al., [62], reports that
AMOT is an oncogene in renal cancer. AMOT
family members is also reported to promote cancer initiation in other cancers and act as a tumor
suppressor in some others [64, 63].
Interestingly, the brain related biological processes such as layer formation in the cerebral cortex, synapse organization, embryonic brain development are found to be enriched (Figure 7b). It is
reported that brain metastasis is common for renal
cancer and in 15 % of cases, the tumor metastasizes to the brain [65]. Additionally, brain metastasis is the main cause of morbidity and mortality
in kidney cancer [65]. These findings suggest that
mRNAs regulated by the synergistic triplets may
participate in the mechanisms that promote brain
metastasis.
