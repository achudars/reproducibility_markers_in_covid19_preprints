Abstract:
Background: In recent, various human health disorders including cancer, diabetes,
neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases are noticed among human populations. Currently,
genetic and proteomic approaches are highly reported to detect metabolic disorders that also
include inborn error of metabolisms. These existing detection methods are faced with cost issue
and time consuming factors. Therefore, metabolites as biomarkers are one of potential avenues to
detect metabolic disorders. Further, exploitation of urine as potential source of metabolite
biomarkers, there are limitation in this area of research due to abundance of non-metabolite
components such as proteins and nucleic acids. Hence, methods and processes are required to
precisely fractionate metabolites from urine of inborn error of metabolism patients and then
identified by analytical tools such as LC-HRMS and GC-MS.
Methods: Sterile filtered urine samples (750 µl) mixed with (250 µl) loading buffer were
electrophoresed on VTGE that uses acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) as matrix of
15%. Further, vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) technique combined with LC-HR-MS to
identify metabolites that are known as the biomarkers of metabolic disorders was carried out.
Results and Discussion: The authors provide evidence on the use of novel VTGE coupled with
LC-HRMS to detect metabolites among metabolic disorders. Data suggest the applicability of
VTGE coupled with LC-HRMS technique to detect metabolites such as 2-methyluridine, 2Methylglutaric acid, 2-Methyl citric acid, 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid in case of metabolic disorders.
Conclusion: This preliminary work is suggested to be extended to large clinical samples to
validate application of this method to detect metabolic disorders including inborn error of
metabolisms.

INTRODUCTION
Among various classes of metabolic disorders, organic acidurias a type of inherited
metabolic disorders is known to surface as intermediate steps in a metabolic pathways of
anabolism and catabolism of lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acids and amino acids (1-5). In essence,
these metabolic disorders are indicated to lead to abundance of organic acids including 2methyluridine, 2-Methylglutaric acid, 2-Methyl citric acid, 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid in a relevant
tissues and these metabolites are potentially excreted in urine (5-13).
Among various classes of metabolic disorders, inborn errors of metabolism are seen as one
of a kind of genetic disorders. In this class of metabolic disorders, lack or altered enzyme activity
can lead to the disrupted biochemical processes that lead to the pathophysiological conditions (513). In essence, such metabolic disorders display a condition of either as the aberrant abnormal
accumulation of a substrate and on the other hand, a deficit of the product is noticed in a target
clinical patient. Further, it is also understood that all such metabolic disorders are inherited in an
autosomal recessive manner (5-13). Based on literature, more than 500 human diseases depicted
as the metabolic disorders are reported in clinical settings. Predominantly, these inborn errors of
metabolism are shown to affect more than one children among 1,000 population. Interestingly, in
the Indian settings, lack of awareness and established method to adopt genetic and metabolic
approaches, these metabolic disorders are remained unnoticed and undetected. Such unnoticed and
undetected metabolic disorders from early stage of life to adult stage are documented to be
implicated in many human diseases including diabetes and cancer (10-13). Hence, metabolic
screening is recommended during early stage of life and may also be extended to later part of life.
Among various markers, metabolic acidosis are suggested as one of important display during such
metabolic disorders (10-13). Currently, various modalities including genetic and metabolomics

approaches are reported in literature. However, these methods and processes are faced with
limitations in terms of validation accuracy and feasibility of translation at bedside approaches.
In this paper, the authors present an approach that combines the vertical tube gel
electrophoresis (VTGE) based fractionation of urine samples and liquid chromatography-high
resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) identification of metabolites in the urine samples of
potential human subjects on a pilot experimental basis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and preparation of urine samples
Fresh urine samples from healthy clinical subjects were collected in sterile collection tube.
A formal approval was obtained through institutional ethics committee (IEC) and institutional
scientific committee (ISC) in accordance with the standard protocol to conduct research on healthy
clinical subjects. An informed consent was obtained from the participating healthy clinical
subjects. The Further, these urine samples were centrifuged twice at 12000Xg for 30 min. to get
rid of debris, dead cells, insoluble particulates and other interfering precipitates. Next, centrifuged
urine samples were filtered using 0.45 micron syringe filter to get clear and sterile urine filtrate for
subjected to VTGE based fractionation of metabolites.
VTGE based fractionation of metabolites from urine
Sterile filtered urine samples (750 µl) mixed with (250 µl) loading buffer

were

electrophoresed on VTGE that uses acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) as matrix of
15%. The fractionated elute was collected in electrophoresis running buffer that contains water
and glycine and excludes traditional SDS, and other reducing agents. A flow diagram of VTGE
method is presented in Figure 1A and 1B that shows the assembly and design of VTGE system
(14-15).

Figure 1. Assembly and working of VTGE system to elute urine metabolites

Urine metabolites from healthy clinical subjects were eluted in the same running buffer,
which is referred as elution buffer. After loading of urine samples along with loading buffer, power
supply was connected and voltage and current ratio were maintained to generate 1500-2500 mW
of power to achieve the electrophoresis of urine samples. The total run time has been allowed for
2 hr and at the end of 2 hr, lower collecting buffer was collected in tube for LC-HRMS
characterization. At the end of run, inner tube containing polyacrylamide gel was removed and put
for coomassie brilliant blue dye staining to ensure that protein components of urine samples were
trapped in the PAGE gel. Further, these eluted fraction from different healthy clinical subjects
were stored at -20oC for LC-HRMS analysis and identification of urine metabolites.

LC-HR-MS analysis of VTGE fractionated urine metabolite elute
LC-HRMS analysis of VTGE metabolite elutes were performed in negative electrospray
ionization (ESI) M-H adduct mode. For the analysis of urine metabolites in LC-HRMS, a flow rate
of 0.2 mL/min and a gradient was formed by mixing mobile phase A (water containing 5mM
ammonium acetate) and B (0.2% formic acid). The HPLC column effluent was allowed to move
onto an Electrospray Ionization Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Agilent Technologies).
Here, urine metabolites were analyzed by using negative electrospray ionization in the multiple
reaction monitoring mode (1-3, 15). During LC-HR-MS analysis of urine metabolites, mass
spectrometer component was used as MS Q-TOF Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(Q-TOF-MS) (Agilent Technologies, 6500 Series Q-TOF LC/MS System) with dual EJS
electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. For liquid chromatography (LC) component, RPC18 column
as GB metabolite, column Zorbax, 2.1X50 mm, 1.8 micron meter was used to separate the urine
metabolite components. The acquisition mode of MS1 is maintained at minimum range of m/z at
60 and maximum range of m/z at 1700. For the run of sample, an injection volume was maintained
at 25 µl and a flow rate of solvent was at 0.3 ml per minute.
RESULTS
In view of need for the detection of potential metabolites of metabolic disorders, a VTGE
method combined with LC-HRMS is used to detect these metabolites as biomarkers in urine
samples of healthy clinical subjects. In this paper, VTGE method that employs 15%
polyacrylamide gel matrix to fractionate in the range of less than 500 Da. metabolites derived from
urine samples. These fractionated urine metabolites were subjected to LC-HRMS to detect the
nature of metabolites. Here, electrospray ionization chromatogram (EIC) of 3-methyluridine

DISCUSSION
In human metabolome database, 2-methylglutaric acid is known as a derivative of leucine
metabolite (1-13). It is suggested that secretion of methylglutaric acid can be found in the urine of
patients showing lack of 3-methylglutaconyl coenzyme A hydratase and 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency during a type of inborn error of metabolisms. Another
example of metabolite as 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is known to be accumulated in an organic
aciduria condition (1-5). There is an indication that 2-hydroxyglutaric acid can be generated due
to the enzymatic action of hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase and further 2-Hydroxyglutaric
acid is shown to be converted into alpha-ketoglutaric acid by 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase.
There is a known fact that 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid is produced due to the gain-of-function
mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme and this enzyme is a part of TCA cycle (1-7).
It is interesting to note that 2-hydroxyglutaric acid may inhibit a range of enzymes such as
histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) and members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family
of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases (1-5). In summary, the uses of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid as
metabolite biomarkers is having relevance in metabolic disorders and also as a key
oncometabolites. In fact, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid is known as an alpha hydroxy acid that belongs
to the class of organic compounds as organic acids. There are findings that support that levels of
2-hydroxyglutaric acid are an indicator of inborn error of metabolism as an organic aciduria.
Organic aciduria can be found in both children and adults that shows various symptoms as tremors,
sleepiness, headaches, feeling tired, and seizures (1-13). In line with existing evidence on the
potential use of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, 2-methylglutaric acid, the authors report on a novel
methods and processes to detect these urine metabolites as a source of biomarkers for metabolic
disorders.

A gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), technology based
metabolite biomarkers of inborn error of metabolic disorders that report on the detection of
methylmalonic academia (Wang et al., 2017). In the same direction, another LC-MS/MS based
detection of methylmalonic acid, 2-methylcitric acid, and homocysteine are reported in case of
potential cases of organic aciduria among infant patients (Want et al., 2019). Other than urine
sample, a mass spectrometry approach is reported on the detection of methylmalonic acid, 2methylcitric acid, and homocysteine in a blood spot samples (Turgeon et al., 2010). A quantitative
approach to estimate hydroxyglutaric acid in plasma and urine is reported by using LC-MS/MS
system to confirm the glutaric aciduria among paients (Simon and Wierenga, 2018). In
convergence of earlier reported GC-MS and LC-MS based approaches to identify, our data is
promising by adopting a new methods by combining VTGE coupled with LC-HRMS for the
detection of urine metabolites as potential biomarkers for metabolic disorders.

CONCLUSION
This paper reports on the use of VTGE combined with LC-HRMS technique for the
identification of 2-methyluridine, 2-Methylglutaric acid, 2-Methyl citric acid, 2-Hydroxyglutaric
acid as potential metabolite biomarkers in case of metabolic disorders clinical subjects. This is
report is of novel in the sense that uses new method VTGE to fractionate metabolites from urine
samples and further identifications of potential metabolites relevant to metabolic disorders. This
study is limited to less number of clinical subjects, however, may be extended to large sample size
for application in clinics for the detection of metabolic disorders in children and adult subjects.
