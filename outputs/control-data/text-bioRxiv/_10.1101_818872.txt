Summary:

2

Genetic methods for targeting small numbers of neurons of a specific type are critical for

3

mapping the brain circuits underlying behavior. Existing methods can provide exquisite targeting

4

precision in favorable cases, but for many cases alternative techniques will be required. Here, we

5

introduce a new step-wise combinatorial method for sequentially refining neuronal targeting:

6

Depending on the restriction achieved at the first step, a second step can be easily implemented

7

to further refine expression. For both steps, the new method relies on two independent

8

intersections. The primary intersection targets neurons based on their developmental origins (i.e.

9

lineage) and terminal identities, while the second intersection limits the number of lineages

10

represented in the primary intersection by selecting lineages with overlapping activity of two

11

distinct enhancers during neurogenesis. Our method relies critically on two libraries of 134

12

transgenic fly lines that express fragments of a split Cre recombinase under the control of distinct

13

neuroblast enhancers. The split Cre fragments are fused to non-interacting pairs of split inteins,

14

which ensure reconstitution of full-length and active Cre when all fragments are expressed in the

15

same cell. Our split Cre system, together with its open source libraries, represent off-the-shelf

16

components that should facilitate the targeting and characterization of brain circuits in

17

Drosophila. Our methodology may also prove useful in other genetic model organisms.

Introduction:

2

An essential step in mapping brain circuits is identifying the function of the individual neurons

3

that comprise them. This is commonly achieved by manipulating neuronal function using

4

effectors encoded by transgenes whose expression is targeted to small subsets of cells using the

5

regulatory elements of neutrally-expressed genes (Gohl et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2018). While it

6

has proved relatively easy to target large groups of neurons for cellular manipulation by this

7

means in genetic model organisms using binary expression systems, such as the Cre-lox system

8

of mice or the Gal4-UAS system of fruit flies, highly-specific targeting of neurons requires

9

combinatorial methods. Genetic combinatorial methods typically use either the regulatory

10

elements of two or more neurally-expressed genes, or exploit stochastic events to limit transgene

11

targeting to a subpopulation of a larger group of neurons. In fruit flies, both types of method are

12

capable of targeting single cells or cell types under optimal conditions (Aso et al., 2014; Flood et

13

al., 2013; Gordon and Scott, 2009; Luan et al., 2012; Shang et al., 2008). However, both

14

approaches have limitations: stochastic methods are, by nature, poorly reproducible, while

15

combinatorial methods are labor-intensive, often requiring the characterization of many neurally

16

active enhancer elements (Dionne et al., 2018; Tirian et al., 2017). Simpler methods of targeting

17

small populations of brain cells are therefore desirable in the effort to comprehensively map

18

neural function.

19

An attractive approach to increase the specificity of neuronal targeting is to identify neurons

20

based not only on the genes they express in the terminally differentiated state (i.e. terminal

21

effector genes, TEG), but also on their developmental history (Awasaki et al., 2014; Dymecki et

22

al., 2010; Huang, 2014). Most neuronal lineages produce diverse neuron types, and while some

23

striking correspondences have been found (Lacin et al., 2019), lineage identity, in general,

1

correlates poorly with neuronal identity as defined by gene expression (Hobert et al., 2016; Zeng

2

and Sanes, 2017). Conversely, gene expression is often correlated across neurons that differ in

3

identity as defined by their function, morphology, and neuroanatomical location (Hobert, 2016;

4

Hobert and Kratsios, 2019). This is because neuronal identities are defined not by single genes,

5

but by the expression of often overlapping batteries of TEGs. An intersection of lineage with the

6

expression of a specific TEG may thus, in general, include fewer neurons than an intersection of

7

the expression patterns of two TEGs. In addition, because neurons from a given lineage typically

8

remain regionally localized, intersections made using lineage information will tend to restrict

9

neuronal targeting anatomically.

10

Recombinase-based intersectional methods that combine information about lineage and cell type

11

have been developed in both mice and fruit flies and have been shown to substantially restrict

12

targeting to cell groups of interest (Brust et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2016). However, the use of such

13

methods has remained largely limited to specific cases—in mice, sublineages of brainstem

14

serotonergic neurons (Okaty et al., 2015), and in flies, subtypes of Type II transit-amplifying

15

neural stem cells (i.e. neuroblasts, NBs) of the central brain (Ren et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2017).

16

This is because of the paucity of lineage-restricted enhancers. Just as there are few TEG

17

enhancers that are active in small numbers of mature neurons, there are also few identified

18

enhancers that exhibit lineage-specific activity. In the fly, a systematic analysis of some 5000

19

neural enhancer domains identified 761 with activity in embryonic NBs, but 99 of these

20

expressed in most or all lineages (Manning et al., 2012). A separate analysis indicates that the

21

remainder are at best active in 5-20 lineages (Awasaki et al., 2014). The routine use of lineage-

22

cell type intersections for neural circuit mapping will thus require more refined methods of

23

isolating neuronal lineages or sub-lineages.

Luan et al_5

1

To achieve such lineage refinement, we introduce here a combinatorial method analogous to the

2

Split Gal4 technique used to restrict neuronal targeting to the intersection of two TEG expression

3

patterns (Luan et al., 2006). We restrict reconstitution of a Split Cre recombinase to the

4

expression patterns of two independent NB-active enhancers (i.e. NBEs). Only NBs in which

5

both enhancers are active thus make full-length Cre. Cre is then used to selectively promote

6

activity of the Gal4 transcription factor—expressed under the control of a TEG enhancer—in the

7

mature progeny of these NBs, thus implementing a second intersection. Our method (i.e. “Split

8

Cre-assisted Restriction of Cell Class-Lineage Intersections,” or SpaRCLIn) generalizes the

9

capabilities of the CLIn technique introduced by Ren et al. (Ren et al., 2016) by expanding the

10

range of possible intersections to most Drosophila lineages while maintaining compatibility with

11

all existing Drosophila Gal4 driver lines. To facilitate SpaRCLIn’s use, we have generated a

12

variety of tools, including two libraries of transgenic fly lines, each of which expresses distinct

13

Split Cre components under the control of 134 different NBEs. We characterize the efficacy of

14

these SpaRCLIn reagents and provide examples of their use in restricted neuronal targeting and

15

circuit-mapping.

Development of Bipartite and Tripartite Split Cre Recombinases

3

SpaRCLIn was developed to refine the expression pattern of a Gal4 driver using the basic

4

strategy shown in Figure 1. In common with other existing methodologies, SpaRCLIn uses a

5

recombinase (i.e. Cre) to excise an otherwise ubiquitously expressed construct encoding Gal80, a

6

suppressor of the Gal4 transcription factor (Fig. 1A-B). As in the CLIn technique, recombinase

7

expression—and thus the excision of Gal80—occurs only in targeted NBs, rendering the progeny

8

of these NBs permissive to Gal4 activity (Fig. 1C). Those progeny that lie within the expression

9

pattern of the Gal4 driver will be competent to drive UAS-reporters and effectors, such as UAS-

10

GFP. In the SpaRCLIn technique, distinct NBEs are used to express components of a bipartite

11

Split Cre molecule in restricted subsets of NBs. In lineages of these NBs that contain mature

12

neurons within the Gal4 expression pattern, Gal4 will be active. This population of neurons can

13

be additionally parsed using a tripartite Split Cre to further restrict the subset of NBs that make

14

active Cre (Fig. 1D).

15

Although most recombinase-based expression systems in Drosophila , such as MARCM (Lee

16

and Luo, 1999), Flp-out Gal80 (Gordon and Scott, 2009), and FINGR (Bohm et al., 2010) have

17

preferentially used the Flp recombinase for Gal80 excision, we selected Cre for use in SpaRCLIn

18

because of its demonstrated ability to retain high activity in a variety of bipartite forms

19

(Hirrlinger et al., 2009; Jullien et al., 2003; Kawano et al., 2016; Kennedy et al., 2010; Rajaee

20

and Ow, 2017). Although Cre activity has been reported to be toxic in Drosophila when

21

chronically expressed at high levels (Heidmann and Lehner, 2001; Nern et al., 2011), it has

22

previously been used in NBs without apparent adverse effects (Awasaki et al., 2014; Hampel et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/818872; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Luan et al_7

1

al., 2011; Ren et al., 2016). Because our system requires use of a tripartite Cre to achieve the

2

most refined targeting it was also desirable to use a method of splitting Cre that would permit

3

reconstitution of the intact molecule to obtain the highest activity levels. Split inteins, which are

4

capable of autocatalytically joining two proteins to which they are fused, are well-suited to this

5

purpose and distinct split inteins have been previously shown to support reconstitution of

6

recombinase activity from complementary Cre fragments fused to them (Ge et al., 2016; Han et

7

al., 2013; Hermann et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012). Figure 1E shows the primary structure of

8

Cre, indicating the location of the breakpoints (green highlight) at which we introduced split

9

intein moieties into the molecule. These breakpoints separate the amino acid residues in the

10

primary structure that form the DNA-binding sites (blue) and the active site (yellow highlight),

11

thus insuring that none of the fragments retains catalytic activity. Two Split Cre fragments,

12

CreAB and CreC, were generated by the breakpoint between amino acids P250 and S251 to

13

implement the bipartite Split Cre system (Fig. 1F, G), while dividing the CreAB fragment at the

14

breakpoint between amino acids D109 and S110 was used to create two further fragments (i.e.

15

CreA and CreB) which together with CreC form the basis of the tripartite Split Cre system (Fig.

16

1H, I). The split intein pairs used to generate these fragments, gp41-1 and NrdJ-1, were chosen

17

based on their trans-splicing efficiency and their lack of cross-reactivity (Carvajal-Vallejos et al.,

18

2012). The latter criterion was critical for avoiding the generation of unproductive fusion

19

products of the Cre fragments.

20

After confirming the ability of the bi- and tripartite constructs to reconstitute Cre activity when

21

co-expressed in transfected S2 cells (data not shown), we used them to generate transgenic fly

22

lines in which they were expressed in patterns dictated by individual enhancers that exhibited

23

activity in neuroblasts. Most of the NBEs selected for this purpose (Supplementary Table 1)

were taken from the large collection of enhancer fragments with fully defined sequences created

2

by the Rubin lab (Manning et al., 2012; Pfeiffer et al., 2008), with the remainder characterized as

3

indicated. A total of 134 NBEs were used to make two libraries of transgenic fly lines, one

4

expressing the CreB fragment under the control of each of the 134 NBEs and the other similarly

5

expressing the CreC fragment. These lines thus collectively express CreB and CreC in a large

6

number of distinct and often overlapping subsets of NBs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).

7

However, because the 134 enhancers are also typically active in mature neurons, the production

8

of full-length Cre is not necessarily restricted to NBs (Jenett et al., 2012).

9

To ensure NB-specific reconstitution of Cre activity, we placed the CreA and CreAB fragments

10

under the control of a compound enhancer formed by fusing individual enhancer elements of the

11

NB-specific genes, deadpan (dpn) and nervous fingers-1 (nerfin-1; see Materials and Methods).

12

This synthetic dpn-nerfin-1 enhancer (i.e. DNE) combines the complementary temporal

13

characteristics of both component enhancers, maintaining strong, broad, and specific activity

14

throughout embryonic neurogenesis (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Use of the DNE thus

15

ensured that full-length, active Cre would be generated only in NBs where expression of the Cre

16

fragments overlapped, and not in fully-differentiated neurons (Fig. 1G, I). This enhancer also

17

expresses in most of the NBs that give rise to the Drosophila CNS with the exception of those

18

found in the late-developing optic lobes, and thus guarantees substantial coverage of the mature

19

neurons found within the expression patterns of Gal4 lines.

20

To detect activity of the Split Cre constructs in vivo, we created transgenic flies carrying a

21

reporter construct in which the floxed Gal80 gene, the expression of which is driven by a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/818872; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Luan et al_9

1

ubiquitously active Actin 5C promoter, is followed by the gene encoding the red fluorescent

2

protein, tdTomato (Fig. 1J). Expression of tdTomato from this construct, which we call

3

Cre80Tom, thus identifies neurons in which Gal80 has been excised, as illustrated by the

4

expression patterns shown in Figure 1K and L. These patterns in the central nervous systems

5

(CNS) of third instar larvae were generated by the bipartite system using the DNE-CreAB

6

fragment and CreC expressed under the control of two different neuroblast enhancers (NBE43H02

7

and NBE44F03). The expression patterns include not only the NBs in which Cre activity is

8

reconstituted, but also the progeny of these NBs, since tdTomato expression is activated in all

9

cells born within these lineages after Gal80 is excised. Although the expression patterns differ in

10

the two cases, they share a small number of common NB lineages as is revealed by application of

11

the tripartite Cre system using the NBE44F03 and NBE43H02 enhancers to drive CreB and CreC,

12

respectively, together with DNE-CreA (Fig. 1M). Expression in this case is limited to

13

approximately three bilateral lineages in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and two in the brain.

14

These examples illustrate how the bi- and tripartite Split Cre constructs selectively reconstitute

15

Cre activity in NBs targeted by individual NBEs, and demonstrate that the tripartite Split Cre

16

system can be used to restrict Cre activity to only those NBs in which two distinct NBEs are

17

active. The tripartite system thus represents an intersectional method for restricting Cre activity

18

to subsets of NBs. The progeny of these NBs that are generated after Cre activation will not only

19

express the reporter tdTomato, but will also fail to express the Gal80 transgene, thus permitting

20

Gal4 to function.

Using the Bipartite and Tripartite Cre Systems to Restrict Expression of TH-Gal4

Luan et al_10

1

The selective disinhibition of Gal4 activity in targeted lineages permits UAS-transgenes to be

2

expressed in cells of those lineages whenever they lie within the expression pattern of a Gal4

3

driver. This allows targeted lineages to be parsed according to the properties of the mature

4

neurons to which they give rise using cell-type specific Gal4 drivers. Such so-called “cell class-

5

lineage intersections” have been previously performed to identify subsets of neurons generated

6

by Type II NBs of the Drosophila brain, which can be selectively targeted using a Type II-

7

specific enhancer (Ren et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2017). Among the neurons

8

generated by Type II NBs are several populations of dopaminergic neurons, identified by a

9

Tyrosine Hydroxylase-specific Gal4 driver (TH-Gal4). Dopaminergic neurons are of

10

considerable interest because of their roles in a variety of important neurobiological processes,

11

including learning, sleep, and locomotion (for review see Kasture et al., 2018). The

12

approximately 120-130 dopaminergic neurons in the Drosophila CNS are produced by diverse

13

NBs and numerous reagents have been generated to selectively target them (Aso et al., 2014;

14

Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2018).

15

As a first test of the SpaRCLIn system, we therefore asked whether it could restrict expression of

16

the TH-Gal4 driver (Fig. 2A) to small numbers of distinct dopaminergic neurons based on their

17

different lineages of origin. Using a small subset of the NBE-CreC lines in combination with

18

DNE-CreAB, we examined the expression patterns produced by intersection with TH-Gal4. The

19

expression patterns produced by these intersections were noticeably reduced compared with the

20

full pattern of the TH-Gal4 driver, but they typically still contained 10’s of dopaminergic

21

neurons distributed broadly across the neuraxis (Fig. 2B-C). In cases where the expression

22

patterns produced by the bipartite crosses shared a neuron (Fig. 2B-C, arrows), combining the

23

relevant NBEs using the tripartite system succeeded in isolating these neurons from most others

in the two original crosses (Fig. 2D). In general, restricting NB expression using the tripartite

2

system—by pairing the NBE-CreC constructs with NBE-CreB constructs made with different

3

enhancers—produced significantly reduced expression patterns, sometimes consisting of one to

4

two cells or bilateral cell pairs (Fig. 2D-H).

5

The expression patterns from 14 NBE-CreC∩NBE-CreB intersections—produced by combining

6

15 distinct NBEs—were analyzed in detail to quantify both the average number of dopaminergic

7

neurons and the stereotypy of expression for each intersection (Fig. 2I). We found that the

8

average number of labeled neurons per preparation did not exceed 8.5 (±3.8, n=16) for any

9

intersection and was less than 4.3 (±2.3, n=17) for two-thirds of them. This sparseness of

10

expression suggests that the NBEs tested do not overlap extensively in their NB expression

11

patterns. Stereotypy of expression was also generally present despite considerable variability.

12

Only in one extreme case, did there appear to be a complete absence of stereotypy, with all CNS

13

preparations that had expression displaying a distinct pattern (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

14

For all other intersections, at least one principal neuron was found that was shared by multiple

15

preparations, based on cell position and morphology (Fig. 2I, black bars). For over half of the

16

intersections, this principal common neuron was shared by 50% or more of preparations. In most

17

cases, other neurons were also found, though preparations containing only such neurons typically

18

occurred at lower frequency (Fig. 2I, gray bars). Consistent with this variability of expression,

19

neurons that recurred across preparations were not necessarily found in the same combinations

20

(Fig. 2—figure supplement 2).

21

The sparseness of labeling combined with the variability of expression likely accounts for why

22

half of the intersections yielded at least one preparation without any expression. Interestingly,

Luan et al_12

1

four of the seven intersections that yielded preparations devoid of expression shared an enhancer

2

(R14E10), suggesting that particular enhancers may strongly influence the extent of labeling.

3

Variability of labeling also appeared to be enhancer-dependent in that use of the same enhancer

4

(i.e. R17A10) to drive both CreB and CreC components did not necessarily reduce stochasticity.

5

Indeed, although all preparations that had expression shared a common identifiable neuron in this

6

case (Fig. 2I), their expression in other neurons varied considerably. A possible source of this

7

variability of expression is weak NBE activity that results in lowered expression of Cre

8

components and consequently more sporadic reconstitution of Cre activity. More work will be

9

required to examine this hypothesis. Regardless, our results demonstrate SpaRCLIn’s ability to

10

substantially restrict expression of a Gal4 driver with sufficient stereotypy in single neurons to be

11

useful for the neuronal manipulations employed in neural circuit mapping.

12
13

Functional circuit-mapping using SpaRCLIn

14

To examine SpaRCLIn’s efficacy for circuit mapping, we used it to identify neural substrates of

15

proboscis extension (PE), a motor pattern normally elicited by gustatory stimuli, but also by the

16

hormone Bursicon in newly eclosed flies (Peabody et al., 2009). Robust PE can be readily

17

induced even in older flies using a driver (rkpan-Gal4) that selectively expresses in Bursicon-

18

responsive neurons (Video 1, Fig. 3A, B Diao and White, 2012). Expressing the heat-sensitive

19

ion channel UAS-dTrpA1 under the control of this driver, we performed an initial (“Step 1”)

20

screen of the CreC library using the bipartite SpaRCLIn system (Figure 3—figure supplement

21

1A). In this screen, crosses were conducted between each NBE-CreC line and a line that

22

combined all other components, including Cre80Tom, DNE-CreAB, rkpan-Gal4, and UAS-

23

dTrpA1. To facilitate visualization of neurons within the resulting expression pattern without

requiring additional genomic insertions, we used a dual expression construct (Cre80Tom- GFP)

2

that contained actin^Gal80^myr-tdTomato and a 10XUAS-mCD8GFP reporter (Figure 3—figure

3

supplement 2). Progeny were videorecorded in small chambers on a temperature-controlled plate

4

and assayed for heat-induced PE. Interestingly, several different PE phenotypes were apparent,

5

but only those that involved full extension of the proboscis could be reliably scored under our

6

assay conditions and we therefore focused on the latter. Applying this criterion, we identified 23

7

NBE-CreC∩DNE-CreAB intersections for which UAS-dTrpA1 activation reliably induced robust

8

PE in greater than 50% of the progeny. The expression patterns resulting from these

CreAB∩C∩rkpan-Gal4 (i.e. Step 1) intersections, examined using a UAS-GFP reporter, were

clearly restricted relative to rkpan-Gal4 expression (Fig. 3C-D), but they were insufficiently

11

sparse to readily identify the neurons—or population of neurons—responsible for inducing the

12

PE motor pattern.

13

Taking advantage of SpaRCLIn’s ability to further restrict expression, we used the tripartite

14

system to carry out a second (“Step 2”) screen in which the 23 identified NBE-CreC components

15

were combined pairwise with NBE-CreB components made using the same 23 enhancers (Figure

16

3—Supplement 1B). The latter were selected from the NBE-CreB library and crosses were made

17

that combined distinct NBE-CreB and NBE-CreC components with DNE-CreA, rkpan-Gal4, and

18

Cre80Tom-GFP. These Step 2 crosses resulted in CreA∩B∩C ∩ rkpan-Gal4 intersections that were

19

assayed for PE as before. Of the approximately 70 intersections tested, 11 yielded PE phenotypes

20

in greater than 50% of flies. The phenotype observed was typically less sustained than that

21

produced by activation of the full rkpan-Gal4 expression pattern in that activation typically caused

22

rhythmic, rather than tonic, extension of the proboscis, which after prolonged heating often

23

transitioned to lifting of the rostrum rather than full extension (Video 2; Fig. 3E).

The rkpan-Gal4 expression patterns in flies exhibiting this phenotype were substantially reduced

2

for many of the intersections tested and they consistently included particular neurons in the

3

subesophageal zone (SEZ) that were characterized by somata near the saddle, broad arbors along

4

the superior gnathal ganglion (GNG), and axons that extended medially before turning, with one

5

branch coursing down each side of the midline and then turning laterally along the medial-

6

inferior edges of the GNG (Video 3). Two closely apposed neurons of this type were observed,

7

sometimes as bilateral pairs (Fig. 3F), and sometimes on only one side (Fig. 3G). These neurons,

8

which we call the PErk neurons, were notably prominent in the 16H11-CreB∩44F09-CreC

9

intersection, where they constituted the entire expression pattern of 16 animals (n=78 total), all

10

of which exhibited PE induction upon heating. Indeed, all 36 animals from this intersection that

11

tested positive for the PE phenotype and were successfully dissected showed expression in the

12

PErk neurons, while none of the animals (n=38) that tested negative had such expression (Fig.

13

3I). Most of the latter, in fact, had little to no expression. Similar results were obtained with a

14

second intersection (44F09-CreB∩10G07-CreC). All 19 animals that exhibited induced PE in this

15

intersection had expression in the PErk neurons, and in three animals these were the only neurons

16

present. A third intersection that yielded the PE phenotype in all animals likewise showed

17

consistent expression in the PErk neurons, but the correlation between the PE phenotype and

18

expression in these neurons was somewhat less readily established because of expression in other

19

neurons (5.6 ± 1.8; n=14 preparations; Fig. 3—figure supplement 3).

FRTerminator: a self-excising DNE-CreAB to facilitate fine-mapping in Step 1 screens

21

The above examples demonstrate that SpaRCLIn can be used to rationally parse the expression

patterns of Gal4 drivers using the workflow shown in Fig. 3—figure supplement 1. One

23

challenge to using this system, however, is the large number of transgenes required to implement

it. This is especially true for Step 2 screening with the tripartite system. To mitigate this burden,

2

we have created several reagents that will facilitate use of the system. In addition to the

3

Cre80Tom-GFP construct described above, we have developed other dicistronic constructs to

4

facilitate manipulating neuronal activity in SpaRCLIn screens (see Key Resources Table). These

5

include constructs and fly lines for Cre80-Kir2.1 and Cre80-dTrpA1. In addition, we have

6

developed an alternate Step 1 strategy that may avert the need for Step 2 screening in favorable

7

cases.

8

The alternate strategy uses a transiently expressed DNE-CreAB designed to be active only during

9

early stages of neurogenesis. This construct, which we call “FRTerminator,” is self-excising in

10

that it is flanked by Flp Recombination Target (FRT) sites and encodes a Flp recombinase gene

11

that is co-expressed with CreAB (Fig. 4A). Upon expression under control of the DNE enhancer,

12

this construct will remove the CreAB gene and thus limit its expression to early (embryonic)

13

neuroblasts (Fig. 4B). CreAB will thus be available to reconstitute Cre activity only with

14

complimentary CreC fragments that are also expressed at this time. CreCs whose expression is

15

driven by NBEs that become active only after the elimination of CreAB from neuroblasts, will not

16

lead to the generation of Gal4-competent neurons. Expression patterns resulting from the

17

combination of FRTerminator with NBE-CreCs will thus, in general, be reduced relative to those

18

produced by DNE-CreAB (Fig. 4C,D).

19

To determine whether the FRTerminator might therefore expedite parsing of Gal4 expression

20

using the SpaRCLIn system, we repeated selected crosses from the rkpan-Gal4 Step 1 screen

21

described above. We focused on the 23 NBE-CreC lines that yielded flies with PE phenotypes,

22

combining each with the FRTerminator, rkpan-Gal4 and Cre80-GFP. Progeny were tested for PE

upon dTrpA1 activation. We found that three NBE-CreC lines (44F09, 57B09, and 14E10)

2

produced progeny with PE phenotypes at frequencies ranging from 9-17%. Although these

3

frequencies were considerably lower than those obtained using DNE-CreAB, the resulting

4

expression patterns were substantially sparser compared with those of progeny from DNE-CreAB

5

crosses (Fig. 4E, F). All animals examined that had PE phenotypes also included in their

6

expression patterns the PErk neurons (n=40). In contrast, only one of the animals examined that

7

lacked the phenotype had these neurons (n=39). A strong correlation between PE and the

8

presence of the PErk neurons was thus observed, again permitting the conclusion that these

9

neurons are substrates for the behavioral phenotype. We conclude that FRTerminator-based Step

10

1 screens may serve as a useful shortcut to serial Step 1 and Step 2 screens for restricting Gal4

11

expression and identifying functionally important neuronal subsets.

Discussion

2

The SpaRCLIn system introduced here permits the refined targeting of neurons within a group of

3

interest based on both their developmental origins and their patterns of gene expression in the

4

terminally differentiated state. By permitting the combinatorial targeting of many, if not most, of

5

the neuroblasts that generate the mature CNS, the SpaRCLIn system provides end-users with a

6

comprehensive, “off-the-shelf” set of reagents for systematically isolating and characterizing the

7

anatomy and function of specific neurons. The reagents that we have created include extensive

8

lineage-selective Split Cre lines for bipartite (Step 1) and tripartite (Step 2) neuronal screens, in

9

addition to a range of tools that facilitate application of the system. Dual effector and reporter

10

constructs reduce the number of transgenes required to implement the system, and a self-

11

terminating Split Cre component (i.e. FRTerminator) can be used to expedite screening in

12

favorable circumstances. The system is compatible with existing Gal4 driver lines and the

13

examples provided here indicate that it is capable of routinely parsing Gal4 expression patterns

14

into subsets of neurons numbering in the single digits.

15

Utility of SpaRCLIn to circuit mapping

16

Our use of SpaRCLIn to identify the RK-expressing neurons that trigger robust proboscis

17

extension demonstrates SpaRCLIn’s ability to systematically parse a neuronal group and identify

18

the functionally relevant subset. Just over 200 crosses—134 crosses for the Step 1 screen of

19

NBE-CreC lines and 70 NBE-CreB∩C Step 2 crosses—were required to identify two pairs of

20

command-like neurons capable of inducing PE upon activation (i.e. the PErk neurons).

21

Importantly, our Step 2 screen, although it included only 70 of the 253 possible intersections,

22

was nevertheless redundant in that the command-like neurons were prominent in the expression

1

patterns of numerous independent Step 2 intersections and were readily correlated with PE

2

induction in three that produced particularly reduced expression patterns. In the intersection with

3

the sparsest expression, the two pairs of PE-inducing neurons often comprised the entire

4

observable pattern in flies that had the PE phenotype, illustrating the extreme reduction in

5

expression achievable with SpaRCLIn. The demonstration that the PErk neurons can be isolated

6

in single crosses using the FRTerminator indicates that this reduction in expression can be

7

attained without the labor of Step 2 screening. However, the lower frequency of the PE

8

phenotype in FRTerminator crosses in our example also suggests that FRTerminator-based

9

screens may require testing more animals for each intersection than a standard Step 1 screen in

10

order to reliably identify positives.

11

Activation of the PErk neurons elicits rhythmic proboscis extension, rather than the tonic PE

12

elicited by activation of all rkpan-Gal4 neurons. This suggests that additional RK-expressing

13

neurons—perhaps lacking command capability—modulate the effects of activating the PErk

14

neurons. Based on their induction of rhythmic extension and their apparent lack of a projection to

15

the proboscis muscles, we conjecture that the PErk neurons identified here are not motor neurons,

16

the activation of which results in tonic and often partial PE (Gordon and Scott, 2009; Schwarz et

17

al., 2017). Similarly, the anatomy of the PErk neurons differs from that of other identified

18

neurons that can drive PE when activated, including second-order projection neurons (Kain and

19

Dahanukar, 2015), modulatory neurons (Marella et al., 2012), and a local SEZ interneuron called

20

the Fdg-neuron (Flood et al., 2013). Like the Fdg-neuron, however, the neurons identified here

21

seem to function in a premotor capacity, perhaps as part of the central pattern generator for PE

22

that regulates fly feeding (Itskov et al., 2014). Further work will be required to determine the

Luan et al_19

1

precise role of the PErk neurons in the feeding circuitry and their relationship to other identified

2

neurons involved in PE.

3

It also remains to be determined whether activation of both PErk neurons is required to induce the

4

PE phenotype. Indeed, from the standpoint of the efficacy of the SpaRCLIn system it is

5

important to ask why SpaRCLIn failed to separate these two pairs of neurons. The similarity of

6

the two PErk neurons in both soma position and projection pattern is consistent with their being

7

part of the same lineage. Such neurons will necessarily be more difficult to parse using

8

SpaRCLIn, which can separate neurons within the same lineage only based on their birth order.

9

What would be required to do so is having two NBEs that are active in the same lineage but at

10

different times so that they separate earlier- from later-born neurons. Such NBEs, by generating

11

Cre only in older neuroblasts, will generate sublineages of Gal4-competent neurons. Although

12

many of the NBE’s used to make our CreB and CreC libraries clearly generate such sublineages—

13

based on the patterns shown in Fig. 1—Supplemental Figure 1—it is doubtful that that they

14

cover more than a fraction of all temporal windows of neurogenesis in all neuronal lineages. A

15

method for systematically isolating sublineages of later born neurons using SpaRCLIn may

16

become possible if neuroblast-specific enhancers can be found that are selectively active at later

17

stages of neurogenesis. These could then be used in lieu of the DNE used here. Candidates for

18

such enhancers are those that determine expression of the so-called “temporal transcription

19

factors” that regulate the progressive divisions of many neuroblasts (Doe, 2017).

20

Stochasticity of SpaRCLIN expression

21

Although stochasticity is not an uncommon feature of many expression systems (Bohm et al.,

22

2010; Tastekin and Louis, 2017), the variability of expression generated by SpaRCLIn was

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/818872; this version posted October 25, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

Luan et al_20

1

notable. Even for intersections that reliably produce very similar expression across animals, it is

2

not common to get exactly the same pattern twice. The infidelity of expression may derive, at

3

least in part, from intrinsic stochasticity of NBE activity, but the strength and/or temporal

4

properties of NBE activity are other likely factors. Further work would be required to identify the

5

sources of variable expression within the system. However the observed stochasticity is not a

6

disadvantage for circuit-mapping applications, as illustrated by the examples presented here. By

7

providing partially “randomized” expression patterns, SpaRCLIn permits causative relationships

8

to be inferred between groups of manipulated neurons and the effects produced by their

9

manipulation (Jazayeri and Afraz, 2017). Such randomization has been commonly exploited in

10

so-called “Flp-out” methods that rely on stochastically induced recombinase activity to remove

11

an FRT-flanked gene or transcription stop cassette (Flood et al., 2013; Gordon and Scott, 2009;

12

Kain and Dahanukar, 2015). This logic is naturally implemented in SpaRCLIn, but because

13

randomness of expression is considerably more constrained than that observed in systems that

14

rely on completely stochastic methods, and because the size of the expression patterns is

15

typically small, correlations can be readily established.

16

One consequence of SpaRCLIn’s stochasticity that must be considered in circuit mapping

17

applications, however, is the lowered frequency of bilateral labeling. Most neurons occur as

18

members of bilateral pairs and we observed numerous instances in which SpaRCLIn-derived

19

expression patterns contained only a single member of each pair in a given preparation—

20

presumably due to the variable success of Gal80 excision in both NBs giving rise to the pair. The

21

reduced bilateral representation of neurons may likewise reduce the frequency of phenotypes

22

observed as a consequence of a particular manipulation if, for example, both neurons in a pair

23

must be affected to produce a phenotype. This is often the case for suppression of function,

Luan et al_21

1

where both neurons in the pair must be inhibited. It is therefore possible that SpaRCLIn will be

2

most effective in applications that involve neuronal activation where unilateral manipulations are

3

often sufficient to generate an effect as they are for proboscis extension.

4

Other considerations in the use of SpaRCLIn

5

The ability of SpaRCLIn to isolate a given set of neurons of interest in a Gal4 pattern depends

6

critically on the extent to which the various Split Cre components are expressed in the neuroblast

7

lineages of the fly. This will be determined both by the breadth of NB expression of the DNE

8

enhancer used here to delimit Cre activity and by the collective coverage of NB expression

9

provided by the NBEs represented in the libraries of Split CreB and CreC lines. Our analysis of

10

3rd instar larval expression in DNE∩NBE intersections (Figure 1—figure supplement1 and data

11

not shown) indicates that many, if not most, NB lineages of the ventral nerve cord and central

12

brain are likely represented within the libraries. Indeed, many lineages are clearly multiply

13

represented in that different intersections repeatedly isolated the same neurons (e.g. the PErk

14

neurons) for both the rkpan-Gal4 and TH-Gal4 drivers. It is less clear, however, that all members

15

of each lineage are represented as not all NBE’s are active during early NB divisions. This is

16

evident from the restriction in NB expression observed when the FRTerminator construct is used,

17

since this construct acts by eliminating lineages or sublineages in which Cre activity is initiated

18

sometime after neurogenesis has begun. It is also clear that the DNE does not express efficiently

19

in NB lineages in the optic lobe (data not shown). To extend the capability of the system to

20

include these lineages will require either the development of a more general neuroblast-specific

21

enhancer or augmenting the system to include an enhancer that specifically targets optic lobe

22

neuroblasts.

Luan et al_22

1

The effectiveness of SpaRCLIn also depends critically on the success of Cre reconstitution by

2

the system, which is effected by two pairs of split inteins (Shah and Muir, 2011, 2014). These

3

trans-splicing protein fragments function naturally in protein religation and are an emerging

4

technology for use in transgenic animals (Hermann et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al.,

5

2012). Their advantages are that they lend themselves readily to intersectional methods, are

6

genetically encoded, and in numerous cases display rapid reaction kinetics and low cross-

7

reactivity. A disadvantage, on which some recent progress has been made (Stevens et al., 2017),

8

is that most split inteins require specific flanking amino acid residues in the proteins to which

9

they are fused, in particular a cysteine or serine residue immediately downstream of the N-intein.

10

We were able to create self-ligating split Cre fragments capable of reconstituting full-length,

11

active Cre enzyme in Drosophila NBs by choosing breakpoints in the Cre sequence preceded by

12

a serine residue—the native condition of the NrdJ-1 and gp41-1 split inteins used here (Carvajal-

13

Vallejos et al., 2012). Orthogonal (i.e. non-interacting) split inteins thus represent attractive tools

14

for reconstituting the function of multiply split proteins, a methodology that should be applicable

15

in other model organisms.

16

Conclusions and Future Development

17

Although sophisticated methods for neuronal targeting have been a hallmark of neurobiological

18

studies on the fly, and single cell manipulations are being leveraged in a growing number of

19

cases to elucidate Drosophila brain circuits, targeting every cell in the fly CNS remains an

20

aspirational goal. Recent progress towards this goal has been made using the Split Gal4 system

21

(Dionne et al., 2018; Tirian et al., 2017), and innovative methods continue to be developed using

22

emerging tools (Garcia-Marques et al., 2019). An advantage of SpaRCLIn is that it represents a

relatively small set of stand-alone reagents for high-specificity neuronal targeting that can be

2

used with the many existing components of the Gal4-UAS system. Importantly, SpaRCLIn also

3

represents an open resource that can readily be augmented by end-users. As methods improve for

4

rationally identifying NB lineages based on gene expression and enhancer activity, the existing

5

SpaRCLIn libraries can be supplemented with lines that together permit the selective targeting of

6

an increasing number of neuroblast lineages. By combining these libraries with an optimized set

7

of Gal4 drivers that express in distinct subsets of brain cells (distinguished, for example, by

8

transcription factor expression), one can imagine having a set of 3 libraries that in combination

9

can selectively target most neurons in CNS.

(A) Crossing scheme for implementing a Step 1 screen using the bipartite SpaRCLIn system.

2

The example given illustrates the strategy to be used when the Gal4 driver is on chromosome III,

3

but reagents for use when the driver is on chromosome II are also provided (see Key Resources

4

Table). An initial set of crosses brings the Gal4 driver together with two essential components of

5

SpaRCLIn: an X chromosome containing the combined Actin 5C-loxP-Gal80-loxP-tdTomato

6

and UAS-mCD8GFP constructs (abbreviated here as Cre80Tom-GFP) and a 2nd chromosome

7

containing the DNE-CreAB. If a functional screen is being performed, an effector—such as UAS-

8

dTrpA1—can also be recombined with the DNE-CreAB or Gal4 driver on an autosome, as

9

illustrated here. Alternatively, we have made variants of the Cre80Tom-GFP (on X) that contain

10

UAS-dTrpA1 (Cre80-dTrpA1) or Kir2.1 (Cre80-Kir2.1) that can be used instead of Cre80Tom-

11

GFP. Flies bearing the Gal4 driver and essential SpaRCLIn components, are then crossed in a

12

final step to flies of the CreC library to generate the desired progeny for testing. The NBEs of

13

those CreC library lines that test positive (e.g. NBEn-CreC and NBEm-CreC) can then be used for

14

intersectional analysis in a Step 2 tripartite screen. This is done by combining one of the NBE-

15

CreC components, say NBEn-CreC, with the NBEm-CreB component, which is readily

16

accomplished by a series of genetic crosses (dotted arrow) because all NBE-CreC inserts are on

17

chromosome III, and all NBE-CreB inserts are on II.

18

(B) Crossing scheme for a tripartite SpaRCLIn screen. Initial crosses similar to those described

19

for the bipartite screen are performed to combine essential SpaRCLIn components together with

20

the Gal4 driver. Now, however, DNE-CreA is used instead of DNE-CreAB. Progeny with the final

21

genotype for testing are generated using flies made as described in A that combine NBE-CreB

22

and -CreC components.

Figure 4. Limiting Cre activity to early NBs using FRTerminator

13

(A) The FRTerminator construct: a DNE-CreAB that terminates its own expression. The

14

FRTerminator expression cassette contains sequences for the Flp recombinase and CreAB-NrdJ-

15

1N linked by a viral T2A sequence to ensure separate translation of the two gene products. The

16

entire cassette is flanked by FRT sites. Upon expression of the cassette—which will occur in

17

NBs at the onset of neurogenesis—Flp will excise the cassette, thus terminating any further

18

expression of both Flp and CreAB-NrdJ-1N.

(B) Schematic comparing the consequences of DNE-CreAB (left box) and FRTerminator (right

20

21

CreC) is active. In NB1 the NBE is active early in neurogenesis and CreC will therefore be

22

expressed in the young neuroblast. In contrast, the NBE becomes active only late in neurogenesis

in NB2 and CreC is therefore only present in the older NB. Because DNE-CreAB is expressed

2

throughout neurogenesis, it will be available to reconstitute full-length Cre whenever CreC is

3

expressed. This means that Gal80 will be excised and tdTomato expression turned on (red) early

4

in NB1—leading to the labeling of all progeny—and late in NB2—leading to labeling of only

5

late-generated progeny. In contrast, FRTerminator is present only early in neurogenesis and Cre

6

reconstitution (and tdTomato expression) will therefore occur only in NB1. No progeny of the

7

NB2 clone will be labeled and the overall pattern of labeling will thus be diminished.

CreAB compared with FRTerminator reflects the loss of sublineages generated by NBs in which

Materials and Methods:

2

Drosophila Stocks.

3

Vinegar flies of the species Drosophila melanogaster were used in this study. Unless otherwise

4

noted, all flies were grown on BDSC Cornmeal Food and maintained at 25°C in a constant 12

5

h light–dark cycle. Both male and female progeny of the genotypes indicated in

6

Supplementary Table 2 were used in this study. Previously described fly stocks and their

7

sources are listed in the Key Resources Table. Fly lines generated for this study were made

8

using the DNA constructs described below. Injection of these constructs to produce transgenic

9

flies was carried out by Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). All transgene

10

insertions except the insertion of the DNE-Gal4 were mediated by ΦC31 integrase and placed

11

in the defined attP landing sites indicated in Key Resources Table. Flies made with the DNE-

12

Gal4 were generated by p-element mediated transgenesis. All other transgenic flies of the

13

NBE-CreB library have transgene insertions on the 2nd chromosome at attP40, while all flies in

14

the NBE-CreC library have insertions on the 3rd chromosome at either VK00033 or VK00027.

15

Molecular Biology.

16

All oligonucleotide and gBlock synthesis was carried out by Integrated DNA Technologies,

17

Inc. (Coralville, Iowa), and all final constructs were verified by sequencing (Eurofins

18

Scientific, Louisville, KY or Macrogen Corp, Rockville MD). For routine molecular biology,

19

the following reagents were used according to the manufacturers’ supplied protocols: PCR

20

amplification: Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix #M0492S (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,

21

MA); DNA ligation: Quick Ligation Kit #M2200L (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA);

22

Cloning: Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme mix #11791100 (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham,

23

MA), and In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus #638911(Takara Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA).

1

gBlocks were used to generate most of the final and intermediate constructs described below,

2

including the DNA fragments encoding the NrdJ-1 and gp41-1 split inteins and the Cre

3

fragments described in the manuscript. DNA sequences of the split inteins were back-

4

translated from the published protein sequences (Carvajal-Vallejos et al., 2012) and all

5

sequences were codon biased for Drosophila. Sequences of all gBlock fragments and PCR

6

primers are listed in Supplementary Table 3 The following reagents, which were used to make

7

several constructs as indicated below, are all described in Pfeiffer et al. (2010): pBPGal80Uw-

8

5, pBPLexA::P65, 10XUAS-IVS-myr::tdTomato, 10XUAS-mCD8::GFP, and pBPGAL80Uw-

9

6.

10

Cre80Tom constructs

11

The indicated Cre80Tom constructs were made stepwise using the described procedures.

12

Cre80Tom: Step 1 - Made the intermediate construct “M1:” an NgoMIV-gBlock013-AatII

13

fragment, an AatII-Gal80-SV40-MfeI fragment (from pBPGal80Uw-5), and an MfeI-

14

gBlock014-KpnI fragment were placed between the NgoMIV and KpnI restriction sites of

15

pBPLexA::P65. Step 2: PCR amplified a KpnI-IVS-StuI-AgeI-myr-tdTomato fragment

16

(Primer71 + Primer72, 10XUAS-IVS-myr::tdTomato as template) and a p10-XbaI fragment

17

(Primer71a + Primer72a, using as template CCAP-IVS-Syn21-KZip+-p10; (Dolan et al.,

18

2017)) and used these to replace the KpnI-XbaI fragment of M1 using In-Fusion HD cloning

19

to make the intermediate construct “M2.” Gateway cloning of M2 was then performed to add

20

the Actin5C promoter (Harris et al., 2015) and get the final Cre80Tom construct.

21

Cre80Tom-GFP: Step 1: A 10XUAS-mCD8GFP PCR fragment (template 10XUAS-

22

mCD8::GFP, Primer59+Primer58) was inserted into the unique NdeI site between the mini-

23

white gene and the attB sequence of the M1 vector. Step 2: A KpnI-IVS-Syn21-myr-

1

tdTomato-StuI PCR fragment (Primer75, Primer76, template:10XUAS-IVS-myr::tdTomato)

2

and a StuI-p10-SpeI PCR fragment (primer HJ077, HJ078) were placed between the KpnI and

3

SpeI restriction sites to replace the LexA::P65 fragment and to produce the intermediate

4

construct “M3” using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit. Step 3: Used Gateway Cloning to add the

5

Actin 5C promoter to produce the Cre80Tom-GFP.

6

Cre80-dTrpA1 and Cre80-Kir2.1: The sequence between the KpnI and NsiI of M3 (including

7

the IVS-Syn21-myr-tdTomato-p10- and a small part of the mini-white gene) were replaced

8

with gBlock25 by HD-infusion cloning to make the intermediate construct “M4.” This step

9

removed the tdTomato gene. The BglII-mCD8GFP-XbaI fragment of M4 were replaced with

10

BglII-dTrpA1-XbaI (template: UAS-dTrpA1, gift from Paul Garrity) and BglII-EFGP-Kir2.1-

11

XbaI (template UAS-EGFP-Kir2.1, gift of Sean Sweeney) PCR fragments and then the

12

actin5C promoter was inserted by Gateway cloning to get Cre80-dTrpA1 and Cre80-Kir2.1.

13

Split Cre constructs

14

All split Cre constructs were made by Gateway cloning (LR reaction). Two sets of destination

15

vectors with split Cre components were made: one for use with entry clones containing

16

promoters, and another for entry clones containing enhancers. The 134 NBE entry clones were

17

combined with the latter to make the expression clones used to generate the CreB and CreC

18

libraries.

19

To make the CreA (HJP-176) destination vectors for use with promoter entry clones, a KpnI-

20

IVS-NheI fragment made from annealed oligonucleotides, a NheI-gBlock012-AgeI gBlocks

21

fragment and an AgeI-PmeI-WPRE-HindIII PCR fragment (amplified from pBPGAL80Uw-6

22

using PrimerS472 and PrimerS473 ) were placed between the NheI and HindIII restriction

23

sites of the pBPGw vector (Addgene Plasmid #17574 Pfeiffer et al., 2008). Other split Cre

Luan et al_42

1

destination vectors (i.e. HJP177~HJP180; see the Key Resources Table) were made by

2

replacing the NheI-CreA-gp41-1N-AgeI fragment in CreA (HJP-176) with fragments consisting

3

of: NheI-gBlock010-SphI + SphI-gBlock011-AgeI (HJP177), NheI-gBlock008-BsaI+BsaI-

4

gBlock009-AgeI (HJP178), NheI-gBlock007-AgeI (HJP179), or NheI-gBlock010-SphI+SphI-

5

gBlock015-AgeI (HJP180). To create a set of destination vectors for use with enhancer entry

6

clones (“the U-series”), an FseI-DSCP-KpnI synthetic core promoter (Pfeiffer et al., 2008)

7

was made from annealed oligos and inserted between the FseI and KpnI restriction sites of

8

each of the destination vectors made for use with promoter entry clones. This produced

9

constructs HJP194~196, HJP-207 and HJP-208 (See Key Resources Table).

10

Prior to the production of transgenic fly lines, the functionality of all Cre constructs was

11

validated in cultured S2 cells by placing the constructs under the control of the Actin5C

12

promoter and testing in appropriate combinations for expression and activity using a floxed

13

reporter construct.

14

DNE and NBE entry clones

15

DNE: A 2 kb region upstream of the deadpan gene previously shown to harbor a NB enhancer

16

by Emery and Bier (Emery and Bier, 1995) was Evoprinted (Yavatkar et al., 2008) using the

17

sequences of five Drosophila species (D. sechellia, D. simulans, D. erecta, D. yakuba, and D.

18

ananasseae) in addition to D. melanogaster. A 607 bp region starting 899 nucleotides 5’ of

19

the transcription start exhibited highly conserved sequence blocks containing transcription

20

factor binding sites, including three CAGCTG E-boxes commonly found in other NB

21

enhancers (Brody et al., 2012). A PCR fragment containing this 607 bp region was cloned into

22

the Bullfinch Gal4 reporter vector (Brody et al., 2012), and the DNE enhancer was made by

23

inserting next to it a previously described mutant nerfin-1 enhancer with two adjacent bp

1

substitutions (G→C and T→C) that were shown to expand the pattern of NB expression

2

(Kuzin et al., 2011). The mutant nerfin-1 enhancer was amplified by PCR from pCRII-TOPO

3

(Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and is separated from the dpn enhancer by 10 bp of

4

DNA sequence from the pCRII-TOPO vector, including the EcoRI site that was used to insert

5

this enhancer adjacent to the dpn enhancer. A DNE vector for use in Gateway cloning was

6

made by transferring the DNE enhancer into the pENTR-D-TOPO entry clone as a PCR

7

fragment (primers: DNE-Sense and DNE-Antisense) using the pENTR™/D-TOPO™ Cloning

8

Kit).

9

Most of the neuroblast-active enhancers used to make the NBE entry clones were from the

10

JFRC Flylight Collection (Pfeiffer et al., 2008).Candidate Flylight enhancers were selected

11

based either on their previous identification as embryonic neuroblast enhancers (active in

12

subset of neuroblasts) (Manning et al., 2012) or on the presence of expression in NBs in the

13

3rd instar CNS as determined by visual inspection of the expression patterns at the Flylight

14

website (https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight). To verify NB expression of the latter

15

NBEs, Flylight Gal4 lines made with the candidate enhancers were pre-screened by crossing

16

them to flies containing the CreStop (HJP225) and UAS-CreC (HJP266) constructs described

17

below with the following genotype: w, DNE-CreB(attP8); UAS-CreC(attP40); CreStop (i.e.

18

actin^STOP^tomato(attP2)), DNE-CreA(VK00027). CNS preparations of the progeny (third

19

instar larvae or adults) were examined for tdTomato expression in NB clones. Selected JFRC

20

Neuroblast active enhancers (NBEs) with “sparse” expression in neuroblasts were amplified

21

by PCR or synthesized when PCR failed (Epoch Life Science, Inc., Missouri City, TX) and

22

cloned into either the pCR8-GW-TOPO or pENTR-D-TOPO donor vectors. Primers listed at

The cas-8 and CG7229-5 enhancers (Brody et al., 2012; Kuzin et al., 2012) were synthesized

12

were synthesized (Epoch Life Science, Inc., Missouri City, TX) and put between the AvrII

13

and PmeI restriction sites of DNE-CreA-gp41-1N.The resulting construct can be used in place

14

of DNE-CreA in Step 2 SpaRCLIn screens. It was tested, but its use is not described in this

15

manuscript. This construct was used as an intermediary to make the final FRTerminator

16

construct by inserting gBlock-043 (part of the CreAB sequence and Nrdj-1N) into its SbfI and

17

AgeI restriction sites using the In-Fusion HD cloning technique.

18

Other constructs

19

Two constructs were used to pre-screen candidate enhancers driving Gal4 expression. These

20

included CreStop (HJP225) and UAS-CreC (HJP266). The CreStop construct was made using

21

a NgoMIV-loxP-hsp70 terminator-MluI gBlock to replace the loxP-Gal80 in Cre80Tom

22

(HJP223) by In-Fusion HD cloning. UAS-CreC was made by cloning a NotI-NrdJ-1C-CreC-

Immunostaining and Image Acquisition.

4

Excised nervous system whole mounts were prepared from wandering third-instar larvae or

5

adults after dissection into PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20–30 min.

6

Immunostaining was done with the antibodies listed in the Key Resources Table at the

7

indicated dilutions. For confocal imaging, all tissues were attached to poly-L-lysine coated

8

cover glass and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) prior to

9

imaging with a Nikon C-2 confocal microscope. Z-series were acquired in 0.85 μm

10

increments using a 20× objective using 488 nm, 543 nm or 633nm laser emission lines for

11

fluorophore excitation. The images shown are maximal projections of volume rendered z-

12

stacks of confocal sections taken through the entire nervous system. NB expression of Gal4

13

driven by the DNE enhancer was examined in embryonic fillets by in situ hybridizations as

14

previously described (Ross et al., 2015).

15

Proboscis extension assay.

16

Flies assayed for proboscis extension were raised at 25°C until the white prepupa stage and

17

then transferred to 18°C until the time of testing. For neuronal activation using dTrpA1, the

18

chambers were placed on the surface of the Echotherm Chilling/Heating Dry Bath IC25

19

(Torrey Pines Scientific, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) at 31°C. For the Step 1 SpaRCLIn screen,

20

approximately a dozen adult flies (3-10 d old) of each genotype were placed in glass

21

TriKinetics tubes (3 mm inner diameter; TriKinetics Inc, Waltham, MA) and videorecorded at

22

31°C for 3 minutes using a Sony NEX-VG10 videocamera. Proboscis extension behavior was

23

analyzed from these recordings. If two or more flies exhibited robust, full-length extension,

the cross was scored as positive. For the Step 2 tripartite SpaRCLIn screen, two flies at a time

2

(one male and one female) were videorecorded together in glass minichambers (0.3 cm

3

diameter X 0.7 cm length) for 3 min at 18°C followed by 3 min at 31°C. Flies were subjected

4

to these temperature transitions twice and proboscis extension behavior was analyzed

5

following the recording. The criteria for positive proboscis extension was three or more bouts

6

of full proboscis extension in both tests. For the FRTerminator behavior experiments flies

7

were subjected to only one test. Flies used to make the videos included in the manuscript were

8

back-mounted on a 200 uL pipette tip with 5-Minute-Rapid-Curing, General Purpose

9

Adhesive Epoxy (ITW polymers Adhesive, Danvers, MA) and placed just above the heating

10

plate, which was adjusted to apply temperature changes.
