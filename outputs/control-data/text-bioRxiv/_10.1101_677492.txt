Summary

17

Here we proposed the hypothesis that hypervirulent colistin resistant K.pneumoniae (ColR-Kp) exhibit

18

high number of virulence factors and have enhanced survival capacity against neutrophil activity.

19

We studied virulence genes of ColR-Kp isolates and neutrophil response in 142 patients with invasive

20

infections.

21

The patients infected with hypervirulent ST101 and ST395 ColR-Kp had higher 30-day mortality (58%,

22

p=0.005 and 75%, p=0.003, respectively. The yersiniabactin biosynthesis gene (ybtS) and ferric uptake

23

operon associated gene (kfu) were significantly higher in ST101 (99%, p=<0.001) and in ST395

24

(94%,p<0.012). Being in ICU (OR: 7.9; CI: 1.43-55.98; p=0.024), kfu (OR:27.0; CI:5.67-179.65; p<0.001)

25

and ST101 (OR: 17.2; CI: 2.45-350.40; p=0.01) were found to be predictors of 30-day mortality. The

26

uptake of kfu+-ybtS+ ColR-Kp by neutrophils was significantly higher than kfu--ybtS- ColR-Kp (78% vs

27

65%, p<0.001). However, kfu+-ybtS+ ColR-Kp were more resistant to the killing activity of neutrophils

28

than negative ones (7.90 vs 4.22; p=0.001). The kfu+-ybtS+ ColR-Kp stimulated excessive NET formation

29

while the NET’s against kfu--ybtS- ColR-Kp were weak and rare.

30

Iron uptake systems enhance successful survival of K.pneumoniae against neutrophil phagocytic

31

defense, and stimulate excessive NET formation. The drugs targeted to iron uptake systems would be

32

a promising approach for treatment of hypervirulent K.pneumoniae infections.

Introduction

43
44

Colistin resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumonia (HvKp) infections are one of the emerging threats

45

in public health because of high fatality rates (1-3). The ST101 and ST395 clones of K.pneumonia are

46

known as hypervirulent clones (4-7), and reported to be significant predictors of the mortality (8). The

47

leading virulence factors of HvKp are mostly associated with capsular serotype, muco-viscosity, iron

48

uptake systems and allantoin metabolism (9-11). Enhanced adhesion and attachment by fimbria and

49

non-fimbrial-structures promote pathogenicity of K.pneumoniae as well (9, 12).

50
51

Iron uptake system is essential for survival and dissemination of pathogens during infections. These

52

systems have also a significant effect on host inflammatory response (13). The neutrophils as the

53

important cells of the immune defense, kill pathogens by engulfment or release of extracellular traps

54

(NETs) (14). The function of NETs is to trap bacteria and promote extracellular killing by minimizing

55

damage to host cells (14). A previous study reported that low phagocytic activity of neutrophils

56

contributes to the success of carbapenem-resistant HvKp ST258 clone (15). However, our knowledge

57

on immune escape mechanisms of colistin-resistant hypervirulent K.pneumoniae (ColR-HvKp) is very

58

limited (10, 11). By this study, we aimed to describe the role of the major virulence factors of ColR-

59

HvKp and their interaction with the neutrophils. Our results will provide an insight to depict the

60

pathogenesis of the HvKp infection.

Methods

63

Study population and Data Collection

64

The patients diagnosed with colistin resistant K.pneumoniae infection between January 2015 and May

65

2018 were included in the study. A study protocol reviewing patient's demographic data, underlying

66

diseases, type of infection, isolation site, blood biochemical parameters, predisposing factors such as

67

having operation within last one month, intensive care unit admission (ICU), type of antimicrobial

68

agents used for empirical and agent-specific therapy, duration of colistin therapy before isolation of

69

colistin-resistant isolates, and carbapenem resistance was used. The patients were followed up for

70

fatality for 30 days after hospital admission. Exclusion criteria were missing key data, subsequent

71

episodes of the same patient.

72
73

Microbiological and Molecular Studies

74

Colistin resistance was studied by broth microdilution and breakpoint for resistance was set to >2 mg/L

75

(16). Carbapenemase genes of OXA-48, NDM-1, KPC were examined by multiplex-PCR, and amplicons

76

were sequenced (17). The mcr-1 was screened by PCR described by Liu et al (18).

77

Genotyping of the isolates was carried out by MLST comparing seven housekeeping genes (phoE, gapA,

78

rpoB, tonB, inf, mdh, and pgi) according to the protocol published on the Institute of Pasteur website

79

(http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/klebsiella.html). ST types were determined using Applied Maths

80

Bionumerics V7.6 software.

81

Virulence genes of type-1 and type-3 adhesins (FimH-1, mrkD), enterobactin biosynthesis (entB),

82

aerobactin receptor (iutA), yersiniabactin receptor (fyuA), yersiniabactin biosynthesis (ybtS), ferric

83

uptake operon associated gene (kfu), regulator of mucoid phenotype A (rmpA), capsule type 1 (magA),

84

capsule type2 (K2Wzy), capsule type 5 (K5wzx), outer core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (wabG) and

85

allantoin metabolism (allS) were screened by PCR using primers described previously (19)

86
87

Phagocytosis assays

88

For phagocytosis assays, 10 ybtS+-kfu+, eight ybtS--kfu- , two ybtS—kfu+, and one ybtS+kfu- isolates were

89

selected. K. pneumoniae ATCC 700831 and S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 were used as controls. Human

90

neutrophils were separated from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque

91

(Sigma–Aldrich, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neutrophil purity was

92

determined by Flow Cytometry (BD Biosciences, USA) using mouse anti-human CD15-PE (Bechman-

93

Coulter, USA) antibody. K. pneumoniae isolates were stained with BacLight 488 (Thermo Scientific,

94

USA) with slight changes to manufacturer’s instructions. For phagocytosis, 2 x 107 neutrophils were

95

incubated with bacterial suspension containing 3 x 108 bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 0C. Phagocytosis

96

was stopped by adding 1ml of ice-cold PBS into tubes. A portion of each sample was stained with

97

Mouse-Anti Human CD15-PE (Beckman Coulter, USA) and run under BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. The

98

internalized and/or surface attached bacteria were determined as CD15+BacLight 488+ cells whereas

99

free bacteria were determined as only BacLight 488+ Cells. Phagocytic Index (Ph Index) was calculated

100

by [(Initial bacterial count X Ph%)/100]. For viability testing, neutrophils were lysed with dH2O for 20

101

minutes and cultured on tryptic soy agar by 10 fold dilutions. After overnight incubation, colonies were

102

counted and the survival index was calculated by [(Colony count per ml/Ph Index) X100].

105

Two ybtS+-kfu+ and two ybtS--kfu- isolates were selected for NETosis experiments. Neutrophils (2 x 105

106

cells) incubated for 1 hour at 370C for attachment to the surface. After incubation, 6 x 106 bacteria

107

were added on neutrophils and incubated 90 minutes at 370C for NET generation (1:30) . A portion of

108

each cell was fixed and permeabilized with 4% BSA and 0,2 % Triton X-100. After blocking, the cells

109

were stained with Mouse Anti-Human Myeloperoxidase (Santacruz, Germany) and Rabbit Anti-Human

110

Histone-H3 (Abcam, USA) antibodies for one hour. Rabbit Anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 594 (Biolegend, USA)

111

and Goat Anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor 488 (Thermo Scientific, USA) were used as secondary antibodies.

112

Fluoreshield medium with DAPI (Abcam, USA) was used for mounting and analyses were performed

113

under confocal microscope (Leica dmi8/Sp8, Germany). K. pneumoniae ATCC700831 was used as

114

control. The remaining part was assessed for the viability of the bacteria after NET formation. Cell

115

suspensions were cultured on tryptic soy agar by 10 fold dilutions and colony count/ml was recorded.

116
117

Statistical analysis

118

Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software package R. In univariate analyses, we

119

used Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous covariates and Fisher’s exact test for discrete covariates.

120

In multivariate analyses, logistic regression was performed using the variables that were detected to

121

be significant in univariate analyses. All the results of statistical analysis are available at the

122

supplementary file (https://midaslab.shinyapps.io/klebsiella_pneumoniae_virulence_analysis/)

Results

125

In this study, 142 patients with colistin resistant K.pneumoniae infection out of 710 (20%) were

126

analyzed (Figure 1). In study group, 84% of the patients stayed in ICU, bacteremia was detected among

127

43% of the patients and 47% of them had ventricular associated pneumonia (VAP). The median age of

128

the patients was 61 and 58% of the patients were male. The 30-day mortality was 51%.

129
130

All the isolates were resistant to colistin, with MICs between 4 and 256mg/L. The majority of ColR-Kp

131

belonged to ST101 (56%) and ST395(11%) HvKp, and the others distributed to various ST clones

132

(minimum spanning tree in supplement) The patients infected with ST101 ColR-Kp had more VAP (56%,

133

p=0.006), had higher 30-day mortality rate (58%p=0.005) than other clones. The mortality rate among

134

ST395 type K.pneumoniae infected patients was 75% (p=0.003) (Table 1).

135
136

Among virulence factors, ferric uptake operon associated gene (kfu) and yersiniabactin (ybtS)

137

components of iron uptake systems were found to be significantly higher in ST101 and ST395 ColR-Kp

138

compared to the other clones. The ybtS and kfu positivity were 99% in ST101 (p=<0.001) and 94% in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/677492; this version posted June 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

139

ST395 clones (p<0.012). The mucoid type associated gene (rmpA) and fimH type adhesin were also

140

significantly higher in ST101 with the percentage of 89%, (p=0.005) and 99 %, (p=0.024), respectively.

141
142

The carriage of OXA-48 carbapenemase was significantly higher (95%, p=0.003) in ST101 than the other

143

clones (76%), however it was found to be very low (31%, p=0.002) in ST395 clone . On the contrary,

144

NDM-1 production was significantly higher in ST395 (88%, p<0.001), and lower in ST101 (4%, p<0.001)

145

than the other clones(30%) (Table 2).

146
147

In univariate analysis, being in ICU (OR: 4.3; CI: 1.42-16.04; p=0.005), presence of ybtS (OR: 3.0; CI:

148

1.01-10.02; p=0.034 and kfu (OR: 3.9; CI: 1.27-14.63; p=0.009) were found to be associated with 30-

149

day mortality. In multivariate analysis, being in ICU (OR: 7.9; CI: 1.43-55.98; p=0.024), kfu (OR:27.0;

150

CI:5.67-179.65; p<0.001) and ST101 (OR: 17.2; CI: 2.45-350.40; p=0.01) were found to be the predictors

151

of 30-day fatality (supplement).

152
153

The phagocytosis experiments showed that ybtS and kfu positive ColR-Kp were internalized at higher

154

rates (median=78%) while negative isolates exhibited low phagocytosis rates (median=65%) after 30

155

minutes of interaction with neutrophils (p<0.001, Figure 2). The phagocytosis rates of S.epidermidis

156

and K.pneumomniae ATCC controls were 89% and 73%, respectively. Survival of kfu+-ybtS+ positive

157

ColR-Kp was significantly higher than negative isolates with median survival index of 7.90 (range:3.29-

158

13.13) vs 4.22 (range:0.36-5.64), respectively (p=0.001). The survival index of S.epidermidis and

159

K.pneumoniae controls were 0.64 and 1.89, respectively (Figure2). The survival index of two ybtS—kfu+

160

isolates were 12.04 and 12.13, and it was 5.13 in one ybtS+kfu- isolate.

161
162

Among 21 isolates, four was in ST101 clone. The median phagocytosis rate 80% was found to be and

163

the survival index was 8.51.

164
165

After NETosis, the mean colony count of two kfu+-ybtS+ isolates was 5.50X106 and it was 4.05x106 for

166

kfu--ybtS- strains. The colony count of ATCC K.pneumoniae was 4.3x106. Confocal microscopy study

167

showed that the kfu+-ybtS+ isolate stimulated abundant NET formation with excessive release of

168

chromatin granular content to the extracellular area. However, the NET’s against kfu--ybtS- negative

169

ColR-Kp were weak and seen only in few areas (Figure 3).

170
171

Discussion

172

ColR-HvKP infections are usually fatal because of limited therapeutic options due to extensive drug

173

resistance and successful immune escape mechanisms of these pathogens. Alternative approaches are

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/677492; this version posted June 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

174

urgently needed in order to prevent and treat infections. One of the most promising strategies is

175

inhibition of virulence factors. Here, we demonstrated the role of iron uptake systems in virulence of

176

ColR-HvKP ST101 and ST395 clones.

177
178

We determined significantly higher iron uptake associated gene (kfu) and yersiniabactin (ybtS)

179

positivity in ST101 (99%) and ST395 (94%) isolates (p<0.001, and p=0.012, respectively). These genes

180

were found to be associated with 30-day mortality. Yersiniabactin type siderophore is encoded in high

181

pathogenicity island which is responsible for high mortality and dissemination of infections (20, 21). It

182

was also reported to be associated with pulmonary infections (3, 22). Holden et al. demonstrated that

183

during pneumonia siderophores stabilizes HIF-1 and increases bacterial dissemination to the spleen

184

(13). Lawlor et al. reported that the acquisition of yersiniabactin is an important step in the evolution

185

of virulent K.pneumoniae (3). The kfu system was found to be associated with invasive infections and

186

increased virulence in mice (23). In our study, multivariate analysis showed that kfu predicts 30-day

187

mortality (OR: 27; CI: 5.67-179.56; p<0.001) and is a predictor of belonging ST101 clone (OD:20.3; CI:

188

2.17-484.56; p=0.018).

189

Another important disease strategy of hypervirulent clones is immune evasion from the innate

190

response (24). The interaction of siderophores with host cells promotes pathogenicity of

191

K.pneumoniae by induction of proinflammatory cytokines (21). Proinflammatory cytokines have a

192

protective effect against K.pneumoniae by recruitment of neutrophils to the infection site. However,

193

studies pointed out the evasion strategy of virulent K.pneumoniae through yersiniabactin secretion(15,

194

21, 25-27). One important effect of yersiniabactin is evasion from innate immune protein Lipocalin 2

195

which is produced by neutrophils or mucosal surfaces (25). The other effect of yersiniabactin is the

196

enhancement of bacterial survival in phagocytic cells by reduction of the oxidative stress response (26).

197

We proposed that, despite their high internalization rate by neutrophils, high survival index of the kfu+-

198

ybtS+ producing ColR-HvKp could be explained by their resistance inside neutrophils after being

199

uptaken. Capsular polysaccharides of HvKp ST258 were reported to have an inhibition on phagocytosis

200

activity of neutrophils (15). In this study, we did not find a difference in capsule types of ColR-HvKp

201

and other clones.

202

Another significant finding of our study was NET release from neutrophils after encountering kfu+ybtS+

203

ColR-HvKp (figure 3). We observed the extensive spread of myeloperoxidase and histone in the

204

extracellular space of neutrophils. The role of NETs in the pathogenesis of infection is still under

205

debate. While some pathogens are killed by NETs, others may survive or even benefit from NETs (28).

206

Phagocytosis is a critical event of decisions to form NETs, and if the bacterium is killed by phagocytosis,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/677492; this version posted June 21, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

207

only a few azurophilic granules may leak into extracellular space with no NET formation (29). Similarly,

208

the kfu--ybtS- isolates of our study induced very rare NETs with a low amount of myeloperoxidase and

209

histones in extracellular space (figure 3). As the control of our experiment, we studied Klebsiellla ATCC

210

strain, and we did not observe NETosis. Branzk et al. reported that NETs are formed in response to

211

large pathogens. Virulent bacteria may circumvent phagocytosis by the formation of large aggregates

212

and trigger NETosis (29). The successful survival of kfu+-ybtS+ isolates (median survival index 7.9) from

213

phagocytosis with induction of extensive NETosis suggested us that protective function of iron uptake

214

systems from being killed by neutrophils might be one of the reasons for mortality of the patients

215

through increased inflammation.

216
217

In this study, the 30-day fatality of ST101 and ST395 were 58% and 75%. K.pneumoniae ST101 is known

218

as hypervirulent clone mostly responsible for pneumonia and bacteremia in intensive care units. (30,

219

31). In our study, ColR-HvKP ST101 isolates were found to be associated with VAP infections (p=0.009).

220

In one of our previous studies, 30 day fatality of infections with ST101 K.pneumoniae was found to be

221

72% (30). The ST395 clone is known as a potentially high-risk clone (32), and recent studies pointed

222

out the emergence of carbapenem-resistant ST395 in France and Italy (33, 34). KPC-2 producing ST101

223

K. pneumoniae was shown to have the highest number of virulence genes associated with capsule

224

type, attachment and iron uptake than the other epidemic clones of K.pneumonia (10). Similarly, we

225

observed more virulence genes for iron uptake system, attachment and mucoid phenotype among

226

isolates belonged to ST101 and ST395 than the other clones (heatmap, supplement).

227
228

Our novel findings in depiction of pathogenesis of HvKp strains should be supported by the animal

229

studies. Particularly, an animal lung infection model should be developed.

230
231

In conclusion, iron uptake systems have a significant contribution to the pathogenesis hypervirulent

232

K.pneumoniae ST101 and ST395 infections. These systems enhance successful survival of

233

K.pneumoinae against neutrophil phagocytic defense, and stimulate excessive NET formation. The

234

drugs targeted to ferric uptake systems would be a promising approach for treatment of hypervirulent

235

K.pneumoniae infections.
