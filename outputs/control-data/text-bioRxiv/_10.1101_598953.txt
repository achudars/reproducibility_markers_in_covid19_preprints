ABSTRACT
1

Hemagglutinin (HA) of Influenza virus is incorporated into cholesterol enriched,

2

nanodomains of the plasma membrane. Phylogenetic group 2 HAs contain the

3

conserved cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) YKLW in the transmembrane region.

4

We previously reported that mutations in the CCM retarded intracellular transport of

5

HA and decreased its nanodomain association. Here we analyzed whether cholesterol

6

interacts with the CCM. Incorporation of photocholesterol into HA was significantly

7

reduced if the whole CCM is replaced by alanine, both using immunoprecipitated HA

8

and when HA is embedded in the membrane. Next, we used reverse genetics to

9

investigate the significance of the CCM for virus replication. No virus was rescued if

10

the whole motif is exchanged (YKLW4A); single (LA) or double (YK2A and LW2A)

11

mutated virus showed decreased titers and a comparative fitness disadvantage. In

12

polarized cells transport of HA mutants to the apical membrane was not disturbed.

13

Reduced amounts of HA and cholesterol were incorporated into the viral membrane.

14

Mutant viruses exhibit a decrease in hemolysis, which is only partially corrected if the

15

membrane is replenished with cholesterol. More specifically, viruses have a defect in

16

hemifusion as demonstrated by fluorescence dequenching. Cells expressing

17

HA-YKLW4A fuse with erythrocytes, but the number of events are reduced. Even

18

after acidification unfused erythrocytes remain cell-bound, a phenomenon not

19

observed with wildtype HA. We conclude that cholesterol-binding to a group 2 HA is

20

essential for virus replication. It has pleiotropic effects on virus assembly and

21

membrane fusion, mainly on lipid mixing and possibly a preceding step.

IMPORTANCE

23

The glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is a major pathogenicity factor of Influenza

24

viruses. Whereas the structure and function of HA´s ectodomain is known in great

25

detail, similar data for the membrane-anchoring part of the protein are missing.

26

we demonstrate that the transmembrane region of a group 2 HA interacts with

27

cholesterol, the major lipid of the plasma membrane and the defining element of the

28

viral budding site nanodomains of the plama membrane. The cholesterol binding

29

motif is essential for virus replication. Its partial removal affects various steps of the

30

viral life cycle, such as assembly of new virus particles and their subsequent cell entry

31

via membrane fusion. A cholesterol-binding pocket in group 2 HAs might be a

32

promising target for a small lipophilic drug that inactivates the virus.

INTRODUCTION

34

Hemagglutinin (HA) of Influenza virus is a typical type I transmembrane glycoprotein

35

with an N-terminal signal peptide, a large ectodomain, a single transmembrane region

36

and a short cytoplasmic tail (1). HA assembles into homotrimers in the ER and is

37

transported via the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, in polarized cells to

38

the apical membrane, where virus assembly and budding take place (2). It was

39

proposed that Influenza virus assembles in and buds through small dynamic,

40

cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched nanodomains of the plasma membrane which

41

could coalesce to larger, more stable platforms (3, 4). Indeed, it was demonstrated by

42

quantitative mass spectrometry that these lipids are enriched in the viral membrane

43

relative to the entire apical membrane of their host cell (5). HA organizes the viral

44

assembly site, since it is not randomly distributed in the plasma membrane of

45

transfected cells, but is present in (partly cholesterol-sensitive) clusters of various

46

sizes as demonstrated by quantitative immunoelectron microscopy (6-8) and FPALM

47

(fluorescence-photoactivation-localization microscopy) (9). The other integral

48

membrane proteins of the virus, the neuraminidase (NA) and the ion channel M2

49

contain their own signals for targeting to the viral assembly site (10), where they are

50

supposed to recruit the internal components of viral particles, the matrix protein M1

51

and the eight ribonucleoparticles (containing the viral genome segments complexed to

52

the nucleoprotein (NP) and the three polymerase proteins PA, PB1 and PB2) into

53

budding virions (11, 12).

54

HA plays also a pivotal role during virus entry. It is responsible for receptor

55

recognition: A binding pocket in the globular head domain of the molecule recognizes

56

sialic acid moieties in glycoproteins and glycolipids on the host cell surface. After

57

clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus acidification of the endosome triggers an

58

irreversible conformational change in HA (1). In order to perform the conformational

59

change the inactive precursor HA0 must first be processed into two disulfide-linked

60

subunits, the membrane-embedded HA2 and the globular HA1 subunit, by a protease

61

provided by the host organism (13). The elucidation of the crystal structures of the

62

ectodomain of HA at neutral and a part of the ectodomain at mildly acidic pH has led

63

to a model of how conformational changes of HA execute membrane fusion. The

64

hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA2, which is buried inside the

65

trimeric structure at neutral pH, becomes exposed on the distal end of the molecule

66

after acidification and interacts with the cellular membrane. A second conformational

67

change then bends the HA-molecule thereby drawing the fusion peptide towards the

68

transmembrane region which leads to close apposition of both lipid bilayers (1). By

69

mechanisms that are not well understood at present lipid exchange initially only

70

occurs between the outer leaflets of the viral and the cellular membrane (hemifusion).

71

Finally, a fusion pore opens, flickers and dilates thereby allowing entry of the viral

72

genome into the target cell (14). Analysing the fusion kinetics of individual virus

73

particles indicated that exposure of the fusion peptide is the rate-limiting step of the

74

reaction. Full fusion then requires the cooperative action of three to four neighbouring

75

HA trimers that pull together on the cellular membrane to execute fusion (15).

76

The C-terminal membrane anchoring fragment of HA, for which no structure has been

77

elucidated, also contributes to membrane fusion. Fusion pore formation requires the

78

presence of a transmembrane region with a minimal length of 17 amino acids (16);

79

HA anchored to the outer leaflet of the membrane by a glycolipid instead of the TMR

80

may cause hemifusion after acidification, but is not able to catalyze full fusion (17).

81

The cytoplasmic tail plays a role during fusion pore formation; it requires S-acylation

82

at conserved cysteine residues at least in some HA subtypes (18), whereas other

83

(artificial) modifications of the tail negatively affect fusion (19, 20).

84

The lipids in the membrane destined to fuse are also not passive bystanders of the

85

reaction. Since fusion requires strong bending of the bilayer, certain lipid species with

86

an intrinsic curvature, i.e. those having a small head group and a large tail (or vice

87

versa) positively or negatively affect certain stages of the reaction (21). One abundant

88

lipid species with a negative intrinsic curvature is cholesterol, since it consists of a

89

small hydrophilic head group, a large and rigid steroid ring structure and a flexible

90

hydrocarbon tail and thus it may stabilize highly curved fusion intermediates. Indeed,

91

cholesterol addition or removal from the HA-containing membrane positively or

92

negatively affects the extent of fusion (22, 23). Cholesterol acts at two stages in

93

membrane fusion: at an early, lipidic stage prior to fusion pore opening and a later

94

stage during fusion pore expansion (22). However, the mechanism of the effect of

95

cholesterol on fusion is not understood and is probably more complex than stabilizing

96

highly curved lipid intermediates. Cholesterol prevents unphysiological (“leaky”)

97

fusion reactions (24), affects membrane ordering (and hence the lateral mobility of

98

HA), the spatial distance of HA in virus particles (25) and finally allows liquid phase

99

separation that concentrates HA for efficient fusion (26).

100

Hemagglutinin has two signals for targeting to cholesterol-enriched nanodomains. On

101

one hand, three conserved S-acylated cysteines located at the cytoplasmic end of the

102

TMR and in the cytoplasmic domain, respectively (27-29), on the other hand,

103

hydrophobic amino acids in the TMR facing the outer leaflet of the plasma

104

membrane, especially the conserved amino acids VIL at the beginning of the TMR.

105

The latter were identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis throughout the whole

106

TMR of HA to identify residues that confer incorporation of HA into

107

detergent-resistant-membranes (DRMs), the biochemical correlate of membrane

108

nanodomains (26, 30). Mutation of these amino acids at the beginning of the TMR

109

also reduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of HA with a

110

double-acylated raft-marker (27, 29, 31).

111

We reported recently that leucine of VIL might be part of a cholesterol consensus

112

motif (CCM) that is known to bind cholesterol to 7-transmembrane-receptors

113

(7TMR). By crystallography the cholesterol-interacting amino acids in the human

114

ß-adrenergic receptor were identified and by sequence comparison with other 7TMR

115

the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) was defined (32). In the CCM the amino acids

116

interacting with cholesterol are not a linear sequence motif, but distributed between

117

two transmembrane helices of these polytopic membrane proteins. One helix contains

118

the sequence motif W/Y-I/V/L-K/R, whereby all residues must face the same side of

119

the helix. In addition, another aromatic amino acid, either phenylalanine (F) or

120

tyrosine (Y) is needed on a second helix to bind cholesterol from the other side. Since

121

cholesterol is present in both leaflets of a bilayer (33), the CCM can be orientated in

122

two ways; the charged amino acid might face either the extracellular space or the

123

cytosolic compartment (34-36).

124

HAs of the phylogenetic group 2 contain a strictly conserved YKLW motif which

125

conforms to the CCM defined for 7TMR (F/Y-R/K-I/V/L-Y/W). Mutations in the

126

CCM drastically retard Golgi-localized processing of HA, such as acquisition of

127

Endo-H resistant carbohydrates in the medial-Golgi and proteolytic cleavage in the

128

TGN. All mutants analysed by FRET also showed reduced association with

129

nanodomains at the plasma membrane (37).

130

Here we analysed whether the CCM indeed interacts with cholesterol and if mutations

131

in the CCM affect virus replication, virus assembly and membrane fusion.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

133

Cell culture and virus experiments

134

Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK II), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human

135

embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modification of

136

Eagle’s medium, PAN, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS (fetal calf

137

serum, Perbio, Bonn, Germany) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100

138

μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To generate polarized cells, 5x105 MDCK

139

II cells were seeded into 24 mm transwells containing a polyester membrane with

140

pores having a diameter of 0.4 µm (Corning) using 1.5 ml growth medium in the

141

upper and 2.6 ml in the lower chamber. Medium was exchanged every day and cells

142

were cultured for 4 days.

143

Mutant 1 of the highly pathogenic strain A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1), termed FPV*,

144

that contains the sequence PSKGR instead of PSKKRKKR at the C-terminus of HA1

145

(38) was used to create recombinant virus. FPV* shows low pathogenicity in chicken

146

and requires trypsin for growth in cell culture and is thus suitable for working in a

147

BSL2 lab. The full-length sequence (excluding the fluorophore) of HA mutants LA,

148

YK2A, LW2A and YKLW4A were cloned from plasmid pECerulean (37) to pHH21

149

with In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio, Japan). Recombinant Influenza viruses

150

were produced with the twelve plasmids system (38) by transfection (0.5 µg of each

151

plasmid) of 293T cells in 35 mm dishes with TurboFect reagent. 4-6 h later, the

152

medium was changed to infection medium (DMEM, 0.1% FCS, 0.2% BSA, 1 µg/ml

153

TPCK-Trypsin). 48 h post transfection, the supernatant was harvested and centrifuged

155

generate a virus stock.

156

HA tests were performed in 96 well U-bottom microwell plates. 50 µl of a two-fold

157

serial dilution of virus sample in PBS was incubated with 50 µl 1% chicken red blood

158

cells for 30 minutes at room temperature.

159

For TCID50 tests virus samples were three-fold serially diluted in infection medium.

160

100 µl diluted virus samples (8 replicates) were added to confluent MDCK II cells in

161

96-well

162

phosphate-buffered saline with Calcium and Magnesium, PAN biotech, Germany). 2

163

days post infection, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 3% formaldehyde in

164

PBS for 5 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The TCID50 titer was calculated

165

by Reed & Muench Method.

166

To generate a growth curve, 90% confluent MDCK II cells in 6-well plates were

167

infected with FPV*-wt or mutants with a moi of 0.0005 (based on TCID50 titer). 1 h

168

post infection, medium was replaced by infection medium, aliquots of culture

169

supernatant were harvested at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h post infection, cleared from

170

cell debris (2000 g, 5 min) and titrated by TCID50 and HA-assay.

171

For competitive growth experiments FPV* mutant was mixed with wild type at a ratio

172

of 5 to 1 and MDCK II cells were infected with total moi of 0.0005. vRNA was

173

extracted from the virus mixture or at 24 h and 48 h post infection from the cell

Photocholesterol crosslinking of HA

185

Two different experiments, labeling of HA-expressing cells or immunoprecipitated

186

HA, were performed to investigate whether HA-wt and HA with mutations in the

187

CCM interact with click-photocholesterol (6,6’-Azi-25-ethinyl -27-norcholestan-3ß-ol,

188

see supplementary file 1 for synthesis of the compound). For the first experiment,

189

CHO cells in 6-well plates were transfected with HA-wt, HA-LA, HA-YK2A,

190

HA-LW2A or HA-YKLW4A cloned into the vector pCAGGS. 4-6 h post transfection,

191

5 µl photocholesterol (from 5 mg/ml stock in ethanol, final concentration is 50 µM)

192

was added to 1ml of medium without serum and cells were incubated overnight. 24

193

hours after transfection cells were put on ice and exposed to UV light (wavelength

194

320–365 nm, power 8W, 3.5 A, 60V) for 10 minutes to activate the diazirine group.

195

Cells were then lysed in 500 µl 1% NP40 in IP buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM

199

anti-HA2 antiserum (1:1000) at 4°C with agitation overnight. 50 µl of

200

protein-A-sepharose was added to the mixture and incubated at 4°C for another 4h

201

prior to pelleting and washing with IP-buffer (2x) and with PBS.

202

For cholesterol crosslinking of purified protein, HA was first immunoprecipitated

203

from transfected CHO cells, 0.5 µl photocholesterol was added to immunoprecipitated

204

HA (in 100 µl PBS) and the mixture was illuminated with UV light at 4°C for 10

205

minutes.

206

HA-photocholesterol complexes were then clicked to Pico-azido picolyl sulfo cy3 by

207

using the CuAAC Biomolecule Reaction Buffer Kit (Jena Bioscience). Samples were

208

subjected to SDS-PAGE and HA-photocholesterol was visualized using the Typhoon

209

FLA 9500 scanner (Excitation =555 nm; Emission =565 nm) in the native (unfixed)

210

gel. In both experiments 50 µl (10%) of cell lysate was removed for western blotting

211

to compare HA-wt and HA-YKLW4A expression levels. The density of HA bands of

212

the western-blot and the fluorogram were analyzed with Image J software. The

213

photo-crosslinking (fluorogram) to protein expression (western-blot) ratios were

applied for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, signals were detected by

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reacts with the Amplex Red reagent in a 1:1

stoichiometry to produce highly fluorescent resorufin. Its fluorescence was measured

244

using a microplate reader with an excitation wavelength of 555 nm and emission at

245

590 nm. We measured only cholesterol, not cholesterol esters, since virus samples

246

were not treated with cholesterol esterase.

The protein concentration of the same virus preparations was measured with

To study apical transport of HA with single or double mutations in the CCM (LA,

YK2A and LW2A), polarized cells were infected with the respective viruses at an

254

m.o.i of 1. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 6 h post infection for 20

min and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Anti-HA2 antiserum (1:500) and monoclonal

RESULTS

342

Mutation in the CCM decrease cross linking of HA to photocholesterol

343

The ectodomain of HA is connected by a nine amino acid long and flexible linker

344

(that contains the cleavage sites for proteases used to remove the ectodomain from

345

virus particles (39-41)) to the 26 amino acid long, α-helical transmembrane region

346

(TMR) (42-44) and the eleven amino acid long cytoplasmic tail carrying three fatty

347

acids attached to conserved cysteine residues (28, 45). Only HAs of the phylogenetic

348

group 2 contain a CCM motif, comprising the conserved amino acids YK at the end of

349

the linker and LW at the beginning of the TMR (Fig. 1A). A helical wheel plot

350

revealed that the amino acids K, L and W are located on one, but Y on the other side

351

of a helix suggesting that two helices of the trimeric HA molecule must contribute to

352

binding of one cholesterol molecule (Fig. 1B). This distribution is thus similar to the

353

amino acids that interact with cholesterol in 7TMR receptors, where the residues

354

W/Y-I/V/L-K/R are on one helix, but another aromatic amino acid, either

355

phenylalanine (F) or tyrosine (Y) on a second helix that bind cholesterol from the

356

other side (32, 35, 36). The cholesterol binding site in the ß2-adrenergic receptor is

357

located in the internal part of the transmembrane region and is completely embedded

358

within the membrane (32), but other 7TMR receptors bind cholesterol to the outer part

359

of the TMR or to amino acids that do not correspond to the CCM motif (35).

360

In our previous studies we reported that various mutations in the CCM severely retard

361

transport of HA to the plasma membrane (31, 37), but whether the CCM interacts with

362

cholesterol

was

not

investigated.

363

clickable–photocholesterol that contains a diazirine group at position 6 of the sterol

364

ring (Fig. 2A). This moiety disintegrates upon uv-illumination into molecular nitrogen

365

plus a highly reactive carbene-group that forms a covalent bond with amino acid side

366

chains in close vicinity. To visualize cross-linked proteins, click-photocholesterol

367

contains a terminal alkine group at the end of the side chain which can be “clicked” in

368

a copper-catalyzed reaction under physiological conditions to the azido-fluorophore

369

Cy3. A similar, but tritiated compound was used to demonstrate cholesterol-binding to

370

synaptophysin (46) and another study showed that this photocholesterol is a faithful

371

mimetic of authentic cholesterol (47). It is also more similar to genuine cholesterol

372

than other photocholesterol probes used recently since it contains (besides the alkine

373

group) no further alterations in cholesterol´s alkyl side chain (48). However, some of

374

the diazirine groups might be photoactivated to other reactive species that have a

375

longer half time than the carbene-group. They might then be cross-linked

376

unspecifically to any proteins they encounter during diffusion through the membrane.

377

Thus, photocrosslinking is a qualitative rather than a quantitative measure of the

378

cholesterol affinity of a protein. Nevertheless, all available compounds label only a

379

few specific proteins out of all cellular membrane proteins (46, 48) indicating that

380

they are suitable tools to identify proteins that strongly (but non-covalently) interact

381

with cholesterol.

382

We expressed H7 subtype HA from a variant of fowl plague virus (FPV*) having a

383

monobasic cleavage site, both the wild-type protein and a mutant where the four

384

amino acids forming the CCM were replaced by alanine (HA YKLW4A). In the first

385

experiments transfected CHO cells were labeled with click-photocholesterol for 16

386

hours and subsequently uv-irradiated for 10 minutes. Cells were then lysed, one

387

aliquot was subjected to western-blotting with HA2 specific antibodies, the other

388

aliquot to immunoprecipitation using the same antibodies and click-chemistry. The

389

resulting fluorescence scan showed incorporation of photocholesterol into both HA wt

390

and HA YKLW4A in approximately similar amounts (Fig. 2C). However, the western

391

blot revealed that the expression level of HA YKLW4A is significantly higher (Fig.

392

2B). Quantification of fluorescence intensities and normalizing them to the expression

393

level showed that incorporation of photocholesterol into HA YKLW4A was reduced to

394

58% (±13%, mean of six transfections, Fig. 2D).

395

Since mutations in the CCM decrease association of HA with nanodomains (27, 37)

396

one might argue that the diminished labeling of HA YKLW4A might be due to its

397

compartmentalization into cholesterol-depleted membrane domains. Consequently,

398

less cholesterol (and hence photocholesterol) is present in the vicinity of HA

399

YKLW4A and thus available to label the protein by random interactions. To exclude

400

such an unspecific effect, we first immunoprecipitated HA wt and HA YKLW4A from

401

cell lysates and then performed photo-crosslinking and click-chemistry on the purified

402

HA-antibody complex (Fig. 2E+F). Nevertheless, a similar result was obtained;

403

incorporation of photocholesterol into HA YKLW4A was even more reduced relative

404

to HA wt (38 ±5%, mean of four transfections, Fig. 2G).

405

To determine whether partial exchange of the CCM has an effect on

406

photo-crosslinking we created HA double mutants HA LW2A and HA YK2A where

407

two consecutive amino acids located at the end of the TMR and in the linker region,

408

respectively were exchanged by alanine. In HA LA the leucine in the TMR (which of

409

all single mutants had the strongest effect on intracellular transport of HA (37)) was

410

substituted by alanine. Cells expressing the three HA mutants were labeled and

411

analyzed as before but no significant reduction of incorporation of photocholesterol

412

was detected (Fig. 2H-J). Thus, in order to reduce photo-crosslinking of HA the whole

413

CCM must be exchanged suggesting that the residues act synergistically with

414

cholesterol.

415
416

Mutations in the CCM of HA affect virus replication

417

All our previous experiments about the CCM of HA were performed with expressed

418

protein (37). To investigate whether cholesterol binding to HA affects virus replication,

419

we created the described mutations in the CCM of HA in the context of the viral

420

genome. We used a variant of fowl plague virus (A/FPV/Rostock/34, H7N1), termed

421

FPV* which contains a monobasic cleavage site in HA and thus requires trypsin for

422

growth in cell culture (38). The amino acid exchanges were generated by at least three

423

nucleotide substitutions to exclude that mutant viruses revert back to wild type.

424

The mutant HA plasmid together with plasmids encoding the other viral proteins were

425

transfected into HEK 293T cells, the supernatant was used to infect MDCK II cells

426

and release of virus particles was assessed by HA assays. In three independent

427

transfections we never rescued virus particles for FPV* YKLW4A, whereas wild-type

428

virus and the other three mutants done in parallel exhibit HA titers of 25 -26. From the

429

rescued mutants a virus stock was generated in MDCK II cells and sequencing of the

430

HA gene showed that the desired mutations were still present (data not shown).

431

To compare the replication kinetics of the viruses, MDCK II cells were infected with

432

FPV* wt or with the mutants at an m.o.i. of 0.0005 (based on TCID50 titer),

433

supernatants were collected at various time points post infection and virus titers were

434

assessed by HA and TCID 50-assay (Fig. 3A+B). The growth curve revealed a

435

statistically significant decrease in the TCID 50 titer for FPV* LW2A (1.5 logs, ~95%

436

reduction, mean of 3 experiments) at 36 and 48 hours post infection. Titers of FPV*

437

YK2A and FPV* LA were also somewhat decreased relative to FPV* wt.

438

We next asked whether mutating the CCM of HA might reduce the competitive fitness

439

of the virus. To test this, we mixed FPV* YK2A or FPV* LW2A with FPV* wt at a

440

ratio of 5:1, co-infected MDCK II cells (total moi of 0.0005), extracted viral RNA

441

from cellular supernatants, either before or at 24 and 48 hours after infection,

442

amplified the relevant part of the HA gene with rtPCR and analyzed it by sequencing.

443

Fig. 3C shows the sequencing chromatograms for the region of interest in the HA

444

gene. Both wild-type and mutant viruses were detected at all time points, reflected by

445

superimposed peaks for the respective nucleotide bases at the mutation site. Due to

446

the higher number of infectious mutant viruses in the inoculum the mutant sequence is

447

predominant before infection, but particles released from cells after 24 and 48 hours

448

contain mainly the wild type sequence. Although the differences in the peak heights in

449

the chromatograms should not be interpreted in a precise quantitative manner, it is

450

obvious that the wild type virus rapidly outgrows mutant virus with two exchanges in

451

the CCM within a few replication cycles.

452

In sum, we conclude that the CCM is essential for virus replication. Exchanging all

453

four amino acids of the motif prevented generation of infectious virions and

454

exchanging two of them reduced virus titers and their competitive fitness.

455
456

Mutations in the CCM do not cause mistargeting of HA in polarized cells

457

In polarized MDCK cells HA is transported to the apical membrane, the viral budding

458

site (49). Since signals for transport are located in the TMR of HA (50-52) we

459

analyzed whether mutations in the CCM disturbed polarized budding of virus particles.

460

MDCK cells grown on transwell filters were infected with FPV* wt and FPV* mutant

461

virus at low moi, aliquots of the supernatant were removed from the apical and

462

basolateral chamber at various time points and virus titers were determined using

463

HA-assays. The growth curve plotted for virus particles released from the apical

464

membrane shows again a reduction in virus titers for all FPV* mutants, statistically

465

significant for FPV* LW2A. However, no virus was released for any of the mutants

466

from the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4A). Since Influenza virus might bud from the

467

apical membrane even if HA is redirected to the basolateral membrane (53) we also

468

determined the localization of HA LA, HA LW2A and HA YK2A in virus-infected

469

and of HA YKLW4A in transfected cells using confocal microscopy. However, wt HA

470

and all mutants are exclusively located at the apical membrane, the fluorescence

471

derived from anti-HA antibodies does not overlap with the fluorescence emitted by

472

the basolateral membrane marker (Fig. 4B+C). We conclude that mutations in the

473

CCM do not affect targeting of HA to the apical membrane.

474
475

Mutations in the CCM reduce incorporation of HA and cholesterol into virions

476

In principle, the decrease in virus replication could be due to compromised cell entry

477

of mutant virus and/or a defect in virus assembly and budding. We have previously

478

shown that mutations in the CCM decreases HA´s cell surface exposure and

479

association with membrane rafts in transfected cells (37). Since these defects might

480

affect incorporation of HA into budding virions we purified FPV* wt and FPV*

481

LW2A virus particles with sucrose gradient centrifugation from embryonated eggs

482

and analyzed their protein composition by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig.

483

5A). Densitometry of viral protein bands and calculation of the viral protein ratios

484

(Fig. 5B) revealed for FPV* LW2A reduced amounts of HA relative to NP (85%,

485

normalized to FPV* wt) and to M1 (82%). If virus particles were purified from

486

MDCK II cells (Fig. 5C), the reduction in HA incorporation was even more

487

pronounced; the HA/M1 ratio is reduced to 59% and the HA/NP ratio to 68%.

488

Likewise, the other two mutants also exhibit a (albeit less distinct, 82-90%) reduction

489

in the HA content (Fig. 5D).

490

Since mutations in the CCM reduce association of HA with membrane nanodomains

491

(27, 37) and since FPV wt buds through cholesterol-enriched domains (5) we asked

492

whether FPV* mutants possess less cholesterol in their membrane. We therefore

493

determined the cholesterol concentration of the same three virus preparations from

494

MDCK II cells and divided it by the protein concentration. For FPV* wt we

495

determined a mean of 220 nM cholesterol per ng/µl total protein, but considerable

496

variations between individual preparations was observed. Nevertheless, the

497

cholesterol content of each FPV* mutant was lower in every (except one) virus

498

preparation relative to FPV* wt, which was purified from sister cultures in parallel.

499

The only exception was FPV* LA for which a slightly higher amount of cholesterol

500

was determined in one, but not in the other two preparations (see Fig. 6A for details

501

on individual experiments).

502

Normalizing the cholesterol content for each virus preparation (wt =100%) exhibit a

503

reduction to 89% in FPV* LA, to 88% in FPV LW2A and to 82% in FPV YK2A (Fig.

504

6B). Assuming that our FPV* wt preparations contain 52 mol% of cholesterol in

505

relation to all other envelope lipids as determined by quantitative mass spectrometry

506

for FPV particles grown in the same cell type (5), one can calculate that the

507

cholesterol content in mutant particles is reduced to 46% in FPV* LA and FPV*

508

LW2A and to 43% in FPV* YK2A. This corresponds quite exactly to the cholesterol

509

content (45%) determined for the apical membrane of polarized MDCK II cells (5).

Thus, our results are consistent with the concept that viruses with mutations in the

511

CCM bud not through (cholesterol-enriched) membrane nanodomains but through the

512

bulk phase of the plasma membrane (26).

518

more sophisticated methods (25).

519
520

Mutations in the CCM decrease the hemolytic activity of HA

521

Next, we investigated whether mutations in the CCM affect cell entry of viruses via

522

HA-mediated membrane fusion. Since the extent of membrane fusion increases with

523

the HA-concentration and since the HA amount is reduced in mutant virus

524

preparations (Fig. 5A-D) we first used hemolysis assays. This allows adjusting the

525

amount of virus by means of its HA-titer and to record membrane fusion

526

quantitatively by measuring the release of hemoglobin.

527

In the first set of experiments we compared the pH dependence of hemolysis. Wild

528

type and mutant virus with an HA-titer of 26 were adsorbed to chicken erythrocytes,

529

the pH was adjusted to mildly acidic pH values between 5 and 7, erythrocytes with

530

bound virus were incubated for 60 min at 37°C and hemoglobin release was

531

determined spectroscopically. Beginning with pH 5.7 FPV* wt causes hemoglobin

532

release; the amount increased linearly with decreasing pH values (Fig. 7A) which is in

533

agreement with published data on the fusion activity of the closely related H7

534

Weybridge strain (55). All mutant viruses also start to cause hemolysis at pH 5.7, but

535

the amount of released hemoglobin is reduced to ~ 30% with each virus and at all pH

536

values. We also compared the kinetics of hemolysis by incubating pH 5 activated

537

viruses for up to four hours with erythrocytes. The amount of released hemoglobin

538

increases linearly with time for all viruses, but the slope of the line is much steeper

539

with FPV* wt. At every time point the amount of released hemoglobin is clearly lower

540

when using mutant virus particles (Fig. 7B).

541

Withdrawal of cholesterol from the viral membrane negatively and addition of

542

cholesterol positively affect HA´s membrane fusion activity (22, 23, 56, 57). In

543

principle, the defect in the fusion activity of mutant viruses might be either due to

544

altered biophysical properties of the viral membrane caused by their reduced

545

cholesterol content or due to a more local or intrinsic functional defect in the HA

546

molecule. To distinguish between both possibilities, we replenished the viral

547

membrane with cholesterol by incubation of virus particles with cyclodextrin fully

548

loaded with this lipid. Cholesterol measurements of virus preparations before and

549

after incubation with cyclodextrin revealed for FPV* wt and all mutant viruses a

550

cholesterol increase of ~20-35%; mutant viruses have now a cholesterol content

551

similar to or slightly higher than FPV* wt before cholesterol addition. Hemolysis

552

assays at pH5 showed an increase in hemoglobin release for both wild-type and

553

mutant viruses by 10% to 35% after cholesterol loading (Fig. 7D) confirming the

554

beneficial effect of cholesterol on membrane fusion. However, the hemolysis activity

555

of cholesterol-enriched mutant viruses was in each experiment lower compared to

556

untreated wild-type virus particles (Fig. 7C) indicating that the defect in membrane

557

fusion persists even if the mutant particles have a cholesterol content like wild-type

558

viruses.

Mutations in the CCM decrease the hemifusion activity of HA

561

A defect in hemolysis does not reveal which step in membrane fusion is affected,

562

since release of hemoglobin requires lipid mixing as well as opening and widening of

563

a fusion pore. In some HA mutants both events are uncoupled, for example HA with a

564

glycolipid-anchor instead of the transmembrane domain (GPI-HA), causes hemifusion,

565

but not full fusion (17). We were therefore interested whether or not viruses with

566

mutations in the CCM of HA exhibit a defect in hemifusion. We employed the R18

567

dequenching assay that allows monitoring lipid mixing between erythrocyte ghosts

568

and virus particles. The lipophilic fluorophore octadecylrhodamine (R18) is integrated

569

into the viral envelope at self-quenching concentrations. Upon binding of washed

570

virus particles (adjusted to an HA-titer of 210) to ghosts and activation of HA´s fusion

571

activity by low pH treatment, viral and ghost lipids begin to mix. This causes

572

dequenching of R18 and the resulting fluorescence increase is recorded in a

573

fluorescence spectrometer. Once viral membrane fusion is completed, detergent is

574

added that causes complete lysis of membranes. The maximal dequenching of R18´s

575

fluorescence is used to calculate the fusion activity at each time point.

576

Fig. 8A shows the mean relative fluorescence intensity of four fusion reactions plotted

577

against the time course. After acidification to pH5 all FPV* viruses exhibit a rapid

578

increase in the fluorescence intensity, which reaches a plateau after ~ 2min. FPV* wt

579

exhibits a maximal fusion activity of 20%, which is clearly decreased in the mutants.

580

Normalizing the extent of fusion (FPV* wt = 100%) shows a reduction to 75% for

581

FPV* LA and to ~ 50% for the double mutants FPV* LW2A and YK2A (Fig. 8B).

582

Furthermore, fitting the curves revealed also differences in the fusion kinetics. 36 secs

583

is the half time for maximal fusion calculated for FPV* wt and FPV* LA, but this is

584

extended to 57 secs for FPV* LW2A and FPV* YK2A. Since a similar result was

585

obtained if the R18 assay was performed at pH 5.5 (except that the half times were

586

longer for all viruses, data not shown), we conclude that mutations in the CCM of HA

587

affect both the kinetics and the extent of lipid mixing.

588
589

HA with a complete exchange of the CCM has a defect in hemifusion

590

Finally, we asked whether the HA mutant with a complete exchange of the CCM also

591

exhibits a defect in membrane fusion. Since no virus particles could be rescued for

592

that mutant we had to rely on a cell-based fusion assay. As target we used

593

double-labeled erythrocytes that contain R18 in their membrane and the soluble

594

fluorophore calcein in their interior. After proteolytic cleavage and acid treatment of

595

HA, R18 diffuses into the cellular plasma membrane whereas calcein stains the

596

cytoplasm which can both be monitored in the fluorescence microscope.

597

Cells expressing HA YKLW4A clearly show hemifusion (cells in the upper left

598

quadrant of Fig. 9A) and also full fusion (some cells in the right half of the figure)

599

with erythrocytes. However, the number of fusion events is clearly reduced compared

600

to HA wt, see Fig. 9B for an image of cells expressing HA YKLW4A or HA wt at

601

lower magnification. One factor contributing to the lower fusion efficiency might be

602

the retarded intracellular transport and reduced surface expression of HA YKLW4A

603

(37). However, the number of bound erythrocytes per transfected cell culture plate is

604

not obviously reduced with cells that express HA YKLW4A (micrograph in Fig. 9B)

605

and cells transfected with HA YKLW4A show similar hemadsorption activity as cells

606

transfected with HA wt (not shown).

607

Furthermore, cells expressing HA YKLW4A show one peculiarity not observed for

608

HA wt, namely erythrocytes tightly bound to cells after acid treatment that did not

609

pass through either hemifusion or pore formation, i.e. no diffusion of R18 into the

610

plasma membrane (see Fig. 9C for three examples) and of calcein into the cell´s

611

cytoplasm (not shown) did occur. We then selected cells with at least two bound

612

erythrocytes and determined in the fluorescence channel whether the erythrocytes are

613

unfused, hemifused or fully fused to the cells. We then calculated the percentage of

614

individual fusion steps for HA wt or HA YKLW4A; the total number of selected cells

615

was normalized to 100%. Cells transfected with HA wt did not show “binding” of

616

erythrocytes after acidification, 58% of bound erythrocytes only passed the

617

hemifusion step and 42% exhibit full fusion (Fig. 9D). Cells transfected with HA

618

YKLW4A revealed a similar percentage of fully fused erythrocytes (45%), but

619

reduced percentage of hemifused (28%) and 22% of bound, but unfused erythrocytes.

620

Thus, we conclude that HA YKLW4A exhibits mainly a defect in hemifusion and

621

probably also in another step that precedes lipid mixing.

DISCUSSION

623

Cholesterol binding to HA

624

In this study we show for the first time that HA interacts with cholesterol. We

625

demonstrate that complete exchange of the cholesterol consensus motif YK…LW in a

626

group 2 HA (H7 subtype) by alanine greatly reduces (>50%) photo-crosslinking of a

627

cholesterol analog to HA (Fig. 2). This was demonstrated by labeling transfected cells

628

with photocholesterol and thus for HA embedded in its natural lipid environment

629

where photocholesterol must compete with other membrane lipids for the binding site

630

in

631

immunoprecipitated from cell lysates excluding the possibility that the stronger

632

labeling of HA wt is due to its integration into cholesterol-enriched nanodomains. HA

633

with an exchange of two consecutive amino acids YK and LW by alanine did not

634

reveal reduced labeling with photocholesterol (Fig. 2) suggesting that the residues

635

synergistically interact with cholesterol.

636

qualitative tool to measure the cholesterol affinity of a protein and may not represent

637

equilibrium concentrations of protein-cholesterol complexes. To more precisely

638

determine the amino acids in HA which contact cholesterol more sophisticated

639

methods, such as NMR or crystallography are required (36).

640

Our data are at odds with a recent report showing by high-resolution secondary ion

641

mass spectrometry that HA clusters at the plasma membrane of transfected cells were

642

not enriched with cholesterol (59). However, the observation was made with an H2

643

subtype HA belonging to the phylogenetic group 1 that does not contain the YKLW

HA.

Furthermore,

a

However, note that photocrosslinking is a

644

motif. Although HA clusters at the plasma membrane have been observed both for

645

group 1 (e.g. H2, (6)) and group 2 HAs (e.g. H3, H7, (7, 9, 27)) their mechanism of

646

clustering might be different. Interestingly, protease digestion experiments and

647

molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the TMR of group 2 HAs have a more

648

compact and protease-resistant quaternary structure compared to the TMR of group 1

649

HAs (39).

650

The CCM is not only present in the consensus sequence of HAs of subtypes H3, H4,

651

H7, H10, H14 and H15 (Fig. 1B), the amino acids YK...LW are also completely (99%)

652

conserved within each subtype (60, supplementary file 1) arguing in favor for an

653

essential role. Indeed, infectious virus particles could not be rescued if the CCM is

654

completely exchanged; viral titers are lower if two amino acids are replaced. The

655

mutant viruses are rapidly outgrown by wild-type indicating that they have a

656

comparative fitness disadvantage (Fig. 3). It is thus safe to conclude that the CCM

657

(and thus its interaction with cholesterol) is essential for Influenza virus replication,

658

affecting both virus assembly and its cell entry via membrane fusion as discussed

659

next.

660

Group 1 HAs do not possess the YK…LW motif, but contain the fairly conserved

661

motif Y-K/Q…I-Y which also corresponds to the CCM defined for 7TMR

662

(F/Y-R/K-I/V/L-Y/W). In addition, various rather loosely defined cholesterol

663

recognition motifs exist that share a similar pattern of basic, aromatic and large

664

hydrophobic amino acid (34). However, mutations at the boundary between the linker

665

region and external part of the TMR do not retard transport of group 1 HAs to the

666

plasma membrane (51). Note also that a tyrosine which is important for the recently

667

determined structure of the TMR region of a group 1 HA (residue 18 in Fig 1a, (42))

668

is not conserved in group 2 HAs suggesting that both phylogenetic HA groups might

669

exhibit different structures in this region.

670
671

The role of the CCM for apical transport of HA and for virus assembly and

672

budding

673

Mutations in the CCM did not have an effect on apical budding of virus particles from

674

polarized cells and did not affect transport of HA to the apical membrane (Fig. 4).

675

Although signals for apical transport of HA are located in the TMR they do not

676

overlap with signals that mediate inclusion of HA into detergent-resistant membranes

677

a surrogate marker for association with cholesterol enriched nanodomains (52).

678

However, the cholesterol content of mutant virus particles is significantly decreased

679

by 10% (mutant LW2A) to 20% (YK2A, see Fig. 6). Assuming that the membrane of

680

one spherical Influenza virus particle contains a total of 300.000 lipid molecules (as

681

calculated for HIV particles that have the same size and hence lipid surface area (61)

682

and ~ 50% (=150.000) are cholesterol (5), a decrease of 10-20% is equivalent to

683

15.000-30.000 cholesterol molecules. An average Influenza virus particle contains

684

300-500 trimeric HA spikes (as determined by Cryo-EM, (62, 63)) and thus at most ~

685

1500 cholesterol binding sites are available. Based on this estimation it is evident that

686

the 10-20% reduction in the cholesterol content cannot be explained by a

687

stoichiometric (1:1) binding of cholesterol to HA. Instead, a cooperative effect must

688

be involved; the mutation in the CCM decreases the cholesterol content by 10-20

689

cholesterol molecules per trimeric HA spike. One cholesterol molecule in direct

690

contact with HA´s CCM recruits (possibly by lipid-lipid interactions) other steroid

691

molecules into virus particles. This assumption is supported by crystal structures of

692

the β-adrenergic and other 7TM-receptors that exhibit two (or more) parallel aligned

693

cholesterol molecules, but only one interacts directly with the CCM motif (35).

694

10-20 cholesterol molecules would be sufficient to encase the outer part of

695

transmembrane domain of one trimeric HA spike if we assume an α-helix and

696

cholesterol diameter of 1 and 0.5 nm, respectively. Such a lipid shell has been

697

postulated to target transmembrane proteins to lipid domains or induce the formation

698

of domains in a membrane that is poised to do so but is not yet phase-separated (64,

699

65). Accordingly, the HA mutants YK2A and LW2A revealed reduced fluorescence

700

resonance energy transfer (FRET) with a double-acylated raft-marker in transfected

701

cells (37) and exchange of three amino acids at the beginning of the transmembrane

702

region prevents raft-dependent clustering of H3-subtype HA at the plasma membrane

703

(26). Mistargeting of HA might cause budding of virus particles through the

704

(cholesterol-depleted) bulk phase of the plasma membrane. In accordance, the

705

reduction of 10-20% cholesterol molecules in mutant virus particles is equivalent to a

706

total cholesterol content of 45%, which corresponds to the cholesterol content

707

determined for the whole apical membrane of polarized MDCK II cells (5).

708

Mutations in the CCM do not only affect the lipids in the viral membrane, but also

709

reduce incorporation of HA (relative to M1 and NP) into particles. This was evident

710

not only with viruses grown in MDCK II cells, but also (but less distinct) in

711

embryonated eggs. The effect was most pronounced if the two amino acids LW in the

712

TMR were exchanged (Fig. 5). A similar observation was made for H3 subtype HA

713

from the filamentous Udorn strain having an exchange of the amino acids WIL at the

714

beginning of the TMR (26). A priori one would rather assume that the HA content of

715

mutant virus particles increases if viruses bud through the bulk phase of the plasma

716

membrane but all other viral proteins are still mainly targeted to the original virus

717

assembly site. However, assembly of viral proteins at the plasma membrane is a

718

complicated process dependent on intrinsic signals in viral proteins as well as (partly

719

transient) protein-protein interactions (8, 11, 12).

720

The mutation LW2A had the strongest effect on replication of virus in cell culture (Fig.

721

3B, 4A) and on HA incorporation into virus particles (Fig. 5), whereas the cholesterol

722

content was reduced in the mutant YK2A to a larger extent compared to LW2A (Fig.

723

6). Note, however, that the data on the composition of virus particles show

724

considerable variation between experiments, which is at least partly due to the

725

pleomorphic nature of Influenza viruses. A recent study showed that even genetically

726

homogenous virus particles released from a single infected cell show enormous

727

variation in size and protein composition, i. e. the copy number of individual proteins

728

vary up to 100 fold between virions (66). This low-fidelity assembly process makes it

729

complicated to more precisely determine the effect of mutations on the morphology of

730

Influenza virus particles.

731

An open question is the functional relationship between the two intrinsic nanodomain

732

targeting signals in HA, S-acylation at cytoplasmic cysteine residues and the

733

cholesterol-binding amino acids at the beginning of the TMR. Removal of only one

734

signal is sufficient to perturb raft association of HA (27, 29, 30). Both signals are

735

essential for virus replication; their complete removal prevented creation of

736

recombinant virus particles (this study and (18, 60, 67)). Viruses with partially deleted

737

signals could be generated but revealed lower titers and defects in virus budding and

738

membrane fusion (18, 26, 67). Otherwise, effects of mutating the two

739

nanodomain-targeting signals are different. Removal of the acylation sites does not

740

retard intracellular transport of HA (31, 68) and does not change the lipid composition

741

(cholesterol content) of the viral membrane, at least not if virus-like particles were

742

analyzed (69). How the functions of both raft-targeting signals interact to define the

743

viral budding site remains unclear.

744

However, the interaction of HA with cholesterol does not necessarily occur only at the

745

plasma membrane since the HA mutants exhibit strongly retarded transport through

746

the Golgi (37), the part of the exocytic pathway in which the cholesterol concentration

747

successively increases from ∼5% (ER) to ∼40% (plasma membrane) (58).

748
749

The role of the CCM for membrane fusion

750

With three different assays using either virus particles or HA-expressing cells we

751

show that mutations in the CCM of HA decrease both the kinetics and the extent of

752

HA´s fusion activity. A similar result was reported for H3-subtype HA that contains

753

mutations at three amino acids at the beginning of the transmembrane region (26).

754

One contributing factor might be the reduced amount of HA at the surface of

755

transfected cells (37) and in virus preparations (Fig. 4). However, we (at least partly)

756

corrected for the latter by adjusting wild type and mutant viruses to the same HA-titer

757

prior to the fusion assay. Thus, it is likely that the fusion defect is not (only) due to

758

lower numbers of HA molecules at the fusion site, but a direct consequence of the

759

mutations in the CCM of HA.

760

The R18 lipid mixing assay with mutant virus particles YK2A and LW2A as well as

761

quantification of individual fusion events of HA YKLW4A-expressing cells revealed

762

that the mutations in the CCM mainly affect the stage of lipid mixing (Fig. 7-9). Cells

763

expressing HA YKLW4A showed another peculiarity, namely unfused erythrocytes

764

still bound to their surface after low pH treatment (Fig. 9). In principle, this could be a

765

fraction of HA YKLW4A molecules not activated by the low pH treatment and hence

766

still bound in its pH 7 conformation to sialic-acid containing receptors on red blood

767

cells. Alternatively, this HA YKLW4A fraction might have executed the first

768

conformational change but has not completed the refolding step that causes fusion

769

between viral and cellular membranes (1). In that case the fusion peptide has been

770

exposed and inserted into the membrane thereby stabilizing the interaction between

771

HA-expressing cells and erythrocytes at acidic pH. Our observation of tightly bound,

772

but unfused erythrocytes to HA-expressing cells might correspond to early stages of

773

HA-mediated membrane fusion recently observed by Cryo EM, e.g. HA-bridging,

774

membrane dimpling and/or tightly docked membrane interfaces (70, 71). In any case,

775

it suggests, that HA YKLW4A also has a defect in a membrane fusion step prior to

776

lipid mixing.

777

The reduced fusion activity of HA might be due to a global effect of the mutations in

778

the CCM on the viral membrane. Virus particles exhibit reduced cholesterol content,

779

and this might profoundly affect biophysical properties of the membrane beneficial

780

for fusion (22, 23, 25, 56)). Indeed, when we loaded mutant virus particles with

781

additional cholesterol the hemolysis activity increased (Fig. 7D). Nevertheless,

782

cholesterol-loaded mutant virus particles revealed hemolysis values well below those

783

determined for FPV* wt without additional cholesterol loading although their

784

cholesterol content is now roughly the same (Fig. 7C). Note also that the HA mutant

785

YK2A has the lowest cholesterol content in the viral membrane (Fig. 6B), but HA

786

LW2A exhibits the largest effect on virus infectivity and its hemolytic activity (Fig.

787

3+7). Thus, the fusion defect is most likely not due to a general disadvantageous

788

property of the viral membrane, such as disturbed liquid phase separation

789

(raft-formation) and/or membrane ordering.

790

where a local interaction between cholesterol and the TMR of HA affects membrane

791

fusion as proposed recently (57). One might envision that the CCM recruits

792

cholesterol from the inner to the outer leaflet of the viral membrane, especially prior

793

to hemifusion. The shape of cholesterol (small headgroup, large hydrophobic tail) is

794

beneficial for the formation of a highly bended membrane intermediate, but only if

795

cholesterol is located in the external leaflet, and not in the internal leaflet of the viral

796

membrane (21, 72). Alternatively, cholesterol binding to the CCM (or more generally

797

the amino acid exchanges we introduced) might affect the flexibility of HA´s linker

We therefore rather prefer a model

798

region which may be important to facilitate the pH-dependent changes in HA

799

conformation required for membrane fusion as recently suggested (42).

800

In sum, mutations in the cholesterol consensus motif of a group 2 HA affect various

801

functionalities of the protein; its transport along the exocytic pathway, raft association

802

at the plasma membrane (37), incorporation of cholesterol and HA into budding virus

803

particles and virus entry via membrane fusion, especially lipid mixing and probably a

804

preceding step. High resolution Cryo-EM of full length of a group 2 HA embedded in

805

a membrane (similar to the one published for a group 1 HA (42)) might be helpful to

806

determine the structure of the cholesterol binding pocket as one prerequisite to

807

develop a small molecule that inactivates the virus.

1035

(A) Conservation of the CCM (amino acids YK…LW) in group 2, but not group 1

1036

HAs. A consensus sequence for each HA subtype was assembled from each HA

1037

sequence present in the database (60). The consensus sequence of group 1 (H1, H2,

1038

H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16 subtypes) and group 2 HAs (H3, H4, H7, H10,

1039

H14, H15) was then used for the analysis by the WebLogo 3.3 server

1040

http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi. The height of the stack indicates the

1041

sequence conservation, while the heights of each letter the relative frequency of an

1042

amino acid at that position. The start and end of the linker region and the start of the

1043

transmembrane region (TMR) are indicated by arrows.

1044

(B) Helical wheel projection (http://lbqp.unb.br/NetWheels/) of the sequence

1045

YKDVILW of H7 subtype HA. Amino acids forming the CCM are shown as white

1046

squares. Y, K, L are on one side of the helix; W is on the other side and thus must be

1047

located on another HA monomer of the trimeric spike to contribute to binding of the

1048

same cholesterol molecule, but this arrangement of TMR helices is speculative.
