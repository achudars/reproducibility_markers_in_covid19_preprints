Abstract

2

Functionally-related genes are often co-expressed across conditions, leading to the hypothe-

3

sis that functionally-related genes also coevolve at the gene expression level across species.

Previous work using codon-based proxies for gene expression supported this hypothesis;

however, this work ignored the impact of non-independence due to shared ancestry of the

6

species. Recent work demonstrated failure to account for shared ancestry can confound the

7

analysis of interspecies gene expression data. We analyzed empirical gene expression data

8

across 18 fungal species using a multivariate Brownian Motion phylogenetic comparative

9

method (PCM), which allowed us to quantify coevolution between protein pairs while di-

10

rectly accounting for the shared ancestry of the species. Our work indicates proteins which

11

interact show stronger signals of coevolution than randomly-generated pairs, with interac-

12

tions showing stronger empirical and computational evidence also showing stronger signals

13

of coevolution. We examined the effects of number of protein interactions and gene expres-

14

sion levels on coevolution, finding both factors are overall poor predictors of the strength of

15

coevolution between a protein pair. Simulations further demonstrate the potential issues of

16

analyzing gene expression coevolution without accounting for shared ancestry. Overall, this

17

work further demonstrates the potential value of PCMs for the analysis of interspecies gene

18

expression data, although we note several key challenges still facing researchers.

Introduction

20

Analysis of high-throughput transcriptomics and proteomics data often focuses on how

21

changes in environment (e.g. nutrient availability) result in changes in mRNA or protein

22

abundances [1]. Through the concept of ”guilt-by-association,” genes which show simi-

23

lar gene expression patterns across conditions are hypothesized to be functionally-related

24

[2, 3, 4, 5]. For example, in S. cerevisiae, there is significant overlap between the proteins

25

which physically interact and the proteins which are co-expressed [6]. Such observations

26

have naturally led researchers to ask if functionally-related genes show coordinated changes

27

in expression across conditions, do they also show coordinated changes, or coevolve, across

28

species.

29

[7] were among the first to investigate the coevolution of gene expression across four

Saccharomyces species. Using the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) [8] as a proxy for gene

31

expression and protein interaction data, [7] found the correlation of CAI between interacting

32

proteins was higher on average than the correlation between random pairs of proteins. Later

33

work by [9] obtained similar results using CAI in prokaryotes.

34

Neither [7] or [9] accounted for phylogeny in their analyses. Phylogenetically-uncorrected

35

methods, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient and ordinary least squares, assume

36

independence of species, which is incorrect due to shared ancestry. This can lead to an

37

overestimation of the degrees of freedom and results in an inflation of statistical significance

38

[10]. Recent work demonstrated failure to account for shared ancestry confounded two

39

previous analyses of interspecies gene expression data [11].

40

This is not to say attempts at examining coevolution of gene expression have done so

41

without attempting to control for the phylogeny. Later work by [12] came to similar con-

42

clusions as those reached by [7] and [9] using a set of 18 fungal species. Unlike [7] and [9],

43

[12] compared CAI between interacting proteins after removing the underlying phylogenetic

44

signal using a transformation developed to remove this signal for protein sequence coevolu-

45

tion data [13]. More recently, [14] presented a method which analyzed correlated changes

46

in empirical gene expression data across hundreds of species from the Marine Microbial Eu-

47

karyotic Transcriptome Project. This approach attempted to account for the underlying

48

phylogenetic structure via a permutation test meant to remove the underlying phylogenetic

49

topology when assessing statistical significance.

50

An alternative to removing the effects of the underlying phylogeny through data transfor-

51

mations or randomization procedures is to deal with it directly. The work by [10] led to the

52

development of various other phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), which directly ac-

53

count for the underlying phylogenetic structure of the species by incorporating information

54

on the topology and branch lengths for parameter estimation. Previous effots have de-

55

veloped approaches for examining coevolution of functionally-related genes. [15] presented

56

what is essentially a phylogenetically-corrected version of phylogenetic profiling, which looks

57

at the correlated presence/absence of genes across species. Looking across a set of fungal

58

species and using protein-protein interaction data to determine functionally-related genes,

59

they found incorporating the phylogeny reduced the false positive rate compared to a Fisher’s

60

exact test. Of course, this method is not applicable if the genes are present in all species

61

under consideration, making gene expression a valuable trait for investigating coevolution of

62

functionally-related genes.

63

Many PCMs have been developed for studying the evolution of gene expression [16, 17,

64

18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Much of this work relies on modeling gene expression evolution

65

as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process [25, 26]. Modeling trait evolution as an OU process

66

assumes the trait is evolving around an optimal value. Multivariate versions of the OU

67

model exists (see [27]), but the additional parameters used in the model often requires more

68

species-level data to make accurate parameter estimates. Here, we present an approach

69

which models the coevolution of gene expression for pairs of proteins using the simpler

70

multivariate Brownian Motion (BM) model [28, 29]. This approach allows us to estimate

71

the degree of correlation between two traits over evolutionary time while accounting for the

72

shared ancestry of the considered species.

73

We find physically-interacting proteins show, on average, stronger gene expression co-

74

evolution than randomly-generated pairs of proteins using the multivariate BM approach.

75

In addition, we find protein pairs with more evidence of functional-relatedness tend show

76

stronger coevolution at the gene expression level. We also find gene expression level and the

77

number of protein interactions, which are good predictors of evolutionary rate of a gene, are

78

poor predictors of the the strength of coevolution between protein pairs. Consistent with

79

previous results, we also find coevolution of gene expression if an overall weak predictor

80

of protein sequence coevolution. As expected, we also find a phylogenetically-uncorrected

81

correlation, on average, inflate estimates of gene expression coevolution.

Materials and Methods

83

Protein Interaction Data

84

18 fungal species were chosen due to availability of RNA-Seq data and for comparabil-

85

ity to previous studies examining the evolution of functionally-related proteins [15, 12, 7].

86

Consistent with [7] and [15], we use physically-interacting proteins as our test case for exam-

87

ining functionally-related proteins. The STRING database was used to identify empirically-

88

determined protein-protein interactions in species for which data was available [30]. We

89

assume these protein-protein interactions are conserved across all species under considera-

90

tion. This dataset will be referred to as the “binding group” for the remainder of the paper.

91

Randomly-generated protein pairs followed by removal of any pairs which were annotated

92

in the STRING database for the species under consideration, even if the annotation did

93

not specify a “binding” interaction. Any proteins with overlapping Gene Ontology terms

94

were removed to control for potential false negatives. This dataset will be referred to as the

95

“control group” for the remainder of the manuscript.

96

Gene Expression Data

97

Gene expression levels were estimated from publicly available RNA-Seq datasets taken from

98

SRA using the pseudo-alignment tool, Salmon [31]. Reads were mapped against protein-

99

coding sequences obtained from NCBI Refseq, with the exception of S. kudriavzevii, S.

100

mikatae, S. paradoxus, and S. bayanus, which were pulled from [32], and L. kluyverii, which

101

was obtained from the Broad Institute (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/regev/orthogroups/)

102

FASTQC was used to assess the quality of the RNA-Seq reads. If necessary, TrimGalore was

103

used to remove adaptor sequences (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim galore/).

104

Gene expression counts were obtained using Salmon’s built-in ability to control for GC and

105

position-specific biases, and these counts were converted to the transcripts per million (TPM)

106

metric [33]. For single-end reads, mean and standard deviation for fragment lengths were

107

specified to be 200 and 80, respectively, except for S. mikatae, S. paradoxus, S. paradoxus,

108

for which mean fragment length was specified to be 250 [34].

109

Given the RNA-Seq experiments are often measured different conditions, we only selected

110

samples from the control conditions, as these are more likely to reflect natural or standard

111

conditions for a species. For datasets which were time course experiments, we randomly

112

selected 3 time-points which were well-correlated in gene expression estimates (Pearson cor-

113

relation ρ > 0.9). Each RNA-Seq sample/replicate for each species was transformed to a

114

standard lognormal distribution (i.e. ln(X) ∼ N (0, 1)), consistent with the transformation

115

used by [16]. A mean and standard error of normalized TPM values were calculated for each

116

gene across all samples/replicates used. Genes with missing data, which could be because no

117

ortholog was identified between species or no gene expression estimate was obtained, were

118

excluded from further analysis.

119

We note some of the RNA-Seq datasets did not indicate replicates, making it impossible

120

to estimate a standard error measurement for the analysis. It is generally recommend mea-

121

surement error be provided for the analysis of continuous traits during phylogenetic analysis.

122

As a proxy for the species missing replicates, we used a closely-related species to provides es-

123

timates of the standard error. This included S. paradoxus (proxy: S. cerevisiae), S. mikatae

124

(proxy: S. bayanus), and N. tetrasperma and N. discreta (proxy: N. crasse).

125

Ortholog identification

126

Orthologs for fungal species were taken from FungalDB, previous publications [35, 32], or

127

the Reciprocal Best Hits BLAST approach, which was only used for N. castellii. Proteins

128

with an annotated paralog in the FungalDB or previous literature were excluded from the

129

analysis, as introduction of a paralog could impact the gene expression of the original gene.

130

This eliminated 4,307 possible genes.

Phylogenetic tree construction

132

Codon alignments of 59 complete, randomly chosen nuclear ORF were performed using

133

TranslatorX using the MAFFT option followed by GBlocks filtering to remove poorly aligned

134

regions [36]. These alignments were concatenated, followed by phylogenetic tree estimation

135

using RAxML with a partitioned GTR-Γ fit allowing rate parameters for the third codon

136

position to vary from the first and second codon position. C. neoformans was designated as

137

an outgroup. Under the Brownian Motion model, it is ideal to use an ultrametric tree unless

138

extinct species are present [37]. To convert the RAxML tree to a ultrametric tree, treePL

139

[38] was used to date the tree, taking the divergence time of S. cerevisiae and C. neoformans

140

(723 MYA, from TimeTree [39]) as a calibration point.

146

as well as the trait covariance between the gene expression estimates on the off-diagonal. The

147

evolutionary correlation coefficient ρC reflects the degree to which gene expression estimates

148

are correlated over evolutionary time and can be calculated from the evolutionary rate ma-

149

trix [40, 28, 29]. The evolutionary correlation coefficient ρC will from here on out be referred

150

to as the “phylogenetically-corrected correlation” to emphasize this statistic accounts for the

151

shared ancestry of the species. Likewise, we will refer to the Pearson correlation coefficient

152

ρU (estimated via the R built-in function cor.test()) as the “phylogenetically-uncorrected

153

correlation”, as this statistic ignores shared ancestry and uses variances and covariances

154

estimated from the data at the tips of the tree.

155

Appropriateness of the Brownian Motion for modeling trait evolution was assessed as

156

described in [41]. Briefly, phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) and standardized vari-

157

ances [10] were calculated from gene expression data for each ortholog set using the pic()

158

function from the ape R package [42]. Pairs of genes containing a significant correlation (i.e.

159

p < 0.05) between PICs and standardized variances, which indicates violation of Brownian

160

Motion assumptions [37, 41], were excluded from further analyses.

161

The phylogenetically-corrected correlation ρC , which reflects the strength of gene expres-

162

sion coevolution between two genes, was compared to metrics associated with functional-

163

relatedness of two genes. We expect stronger coevolution of gene expression between pro-

164

teins which are more functionally-related. As a metric of functional-relatedness for each

165

interaction, we used the STRING confidence score, which factors in both empirical/compu-

166

tational evidence supporting an interaction, as well as evidence from closely-related species.

167

Similarly, one might expect proteins sharing a greater number of overlapping Gene Ontology

168

(GO) terms to be more functionally-related.

169

It is well-established both gene expression and number of interactions in a protein-protein

170

interaction network impact the evolutionary behavior of a protein [43, 44]; thus, we also

171

tested if such protein-level properties also impact the strength of coevolution between two

172

proteins. We hypothesized proteins pairs which are, on average, more highly expressed and

173

involved in more interactions would show stronger coevolution of gene expression. For each

174

protein pair in the binding group, the mean degree (i.e. the average number of interactions

175

for each protein) and the mean phylogenetically-corrected average gene expression value

176

were calculated. The phylogenetically-corrected average gene expression value for a protein

177

is taken as the ancestral state value estimated at the root of the tree by mvMORPH.

178

To determine if functional-relatedness, gene expression, and number of protein interac-

179

tions have an impact on the strength of coevolution, a weighted rank-based (i.e. robust to

180

non-normality in data) Spearman correlation ρS was used to reduce the impact of proteins

181

found in multiple pairs. Weights for the weighted Spearman correlation ρS for each protein

182

pair were calculated as

1
Weight =
2



1
1
+
N1 N2



183

where Ni is the the number of times protein i appears in the binding group. Confidence

184

intervals and p-values for the weighted Spearman correlations were calculated using the R

185

package boot [45, 46].

186

To assess the impact of proteins found in multiple pairs on differences observed be-

187

tween the binding and control groups, we generated 200 subsets of the binding and control

188

datasets in which a protein was only allowed to appear, at maximum, in one protein pair

189

per dataset. Each subset was restricted to a maximum size of 200 protein pairs. For each

190

subset, the mean was calculated for ρC and ρU , creating a distribution of means. Scripts

191

and for performing phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of the results can be found at

Results

194

Overall, the normalized gene expression data are moderately to strongly correlated between

195

all species (Supplemental Figure 1). Clearly, species which are more closely-related tend

196

to show stronger correlations between normalized gene expression values, consistent with

197

expectations. The Candida species appear to be exceptions, but these yeast demonstrate

198

pathogenic traits, which could partially explain some of these differences, as well as why two

199

of these species (C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis) appear to be better correlated with the

200

pathogenic Aspergillus species.

201

After filtering proteins based on missing data or violation of the Brownian Motion as-

202

sumption, our binding and control datasets contained 3,091 and 13,936 protein pairs re-

203

spectively, consisting of 648 unique proteins. We note similar patterns are observed if not

204

excluding genes which violate the BM assumption, although the signal overall appears weaker

205

(see Supplemental Results).

206

Interacting proteins demonstrate clear coevolution of gene expres-

sion

208

Examination of the phylogenetically-corrected correlation ρC distribution for the binding

209

and control group shows striking differences. Binding proteins have a mean phylogenetically-

210

corrected correlation of ρ̄C = 0.45 (One-sample t-test, 95% CI: 0.436 – 0.464, p < 10−200 ).

211

In contrast, the randomly-generated control group had a much lower mean phylogenetically-

212

corrected correlation of ρ̄C = 0.03 (One-sample t-test, 95% CI: 0.025 – 0.037, p < 10−23 ). As

213

is clear from the 95% confidence intervals, the difference between the mean phylogenetically-

214

corrected correlations for the binding and control distributions is statistically significant

215

(Welch’s t-test, p < 10−200 ). Although the mean phylogenetically-corrected correlation for

216

the control group is significantly different from 0, it is important to note two things: (1)

217

even though we did our best to eliminate possible false negatives in the control group, it

218

is unlikely all false negatives were eliminated and (2) this is consistent with previous work

219

by [7], who also had random control groups which were not centered around 0. Despite the

220

small, but statistically significant, deviation from 0 of the control group, the binding group

221

shows a clear skew towards stronger coevolution between protein pairs than is observed in

222

the control group, as expected.

223

We find a weak, but significant, positive correlation between the STRING confidence

224

scores and phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC (Weighted Spearman Rank Correlation

225

ρS = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.274 – 0.371, p < 10−37 ), indicating interactions which are more likely

226

to be true and conserved show stronger coevolution of gene expression (Figure 3). A similar

227

result is obtained when using a metric of functional similarity between proteins based on

228

overlapping Gene Ontology terms (see Supplementary Figure 2).

229

We also compared how our phylogentically-corrected approach worked compared to a

230

phylogenetically-uncorrected approach. Qualitatively, a similar pattern to the phylogenetically-

231

corrected correlations ρU is observed: binding proteins show correlations positively skewed

232

a way from 0, consistent with stronger coevolution of gene expression between the inter-

233

acting pairs. Interacting proteins had a mean phylogenetically-uncorrected correlation of

234

ρ̄U = 0.51 (One-sample t-test,95% CI: 0.497 – 0.523, p < 10−200 , Figure 2). In con-

235

trast, randomly-generated protein pairs had a mean phylogenetically-uncorrected correlation

236

ρ̄U = 0.08 (One-sample t-test, 95% CI: 0.074 – 0.086, p < 10−141 , Figure 2). As with the

237

phylogenetically-corrected correlations, the control group deviates significantly from the null

238

expectation of 0.0; however, the phylogenetically-uncorrected correlation deviates further

239

from the expectation than the phylogenetically-corrected correlations. This is consistent

240

with inflation of correlation estimates due to treatment of non-independent species data as

241

independent [10]. Simulations were performed to confirm potential problems with the use of

242

non-phylogenetic methods for comparing gene expression across species (see Supplemental

243

Methods for details on simulations). Results show failure to account for the phylogeny on

244

data simulated under the null of no coevolution between gene expression results in an in-

crease in the false discovery rate (FDR) (Table 1), consistent with expectations. However,

246

the distribution of ρU simulated under no coevolution is different from the distribution of

247

ρU from the real data (Supplemental Figure 5d). In the case of simulated data in which

248

no coevolution was allowed, the distribution of phylogenetically-uncorrected correlations ρU

249

is centered around 0.0, unlike in the real data, but shows a broadening of the distribution

250

compared to the phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC (Supplemental Figure 5b).

251

Gene expression and number of interactions are poor predictors of

252

coevolution of gene expression

253

It is well-established both gene expression and location in a protein-protein interaction net-

254

work significantly impact the evolutionary behavior of a protein [47, 48, 44, 49, 50]. One

255

might expect an imbalance in the number of proteins involved in a greater number of in-

256

teractions or more highly expressed interactions to have a more negative impact on fitness,

257

leading to greater constraints on the evolution of gene expression. However, we find both

258

the number of interactions and the gene expression to be weak predictors of the strength of

259

coevolution of gene expression. Based on the number of interactions for each protein in our

260

binding dataset, the weighted Spearman rank correlation between the number of interac-

261

tions and the phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC is ρS = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.196 – 0.315,

262

p < 10−16 ), indicating protein pairs involved in more interactions tend to show stronger con-

263

straint on the evolution of gene expression. Surprisingly, the mean ancestral gene expression

264

estimates are negatively correlated with the phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC , with

265

ρS = −0.09 (95% CI: - 0.143 – -0.035, p = 0.00131).

266

Given phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC correlate with the number of interac-

267

tions and mean ancestral gene expression, differences between the binding and control groups

268

in terms of number of interactions and gene expression could introduce small biases when

269

comparing the ρC distributions. The average mean ancestral gene expression estimate distri-

270

butions for the binding and control group are extremely similar (0.414 vs. 0.416, respectively,

271

Welch’s t-test, p = 0.8316). This makes differences in the gene expression distributions an

272

unlikely source of bias when comparing the binding and control groups. To determine if

273

protein membership biases causes biases in the results, 200 subsets of the binding and con-

274

trol groups were sampled, restricting a protein appearing in each group a maximum of 1

275

time. The 200 subsets resulted in distributions of the mean phylogenetically-corrected cor-

276

relations ρ̄C , which were qualitatively consistent with the full datasets (Supplemental Figure

277

ure 3). This could be due to the representation of certain proteins in the binding group

280

inflating the correlation, or could be due to decreased power to detect differences due to the

281

significantly reduced dataset. Despite this, the overall interpretation is the same: interacting

282

proteins show greater coevolution at the gene expression level than randomly generated pairs

283

of proteins.

sequence coevolution and the phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρC were weakly, but

290

significantly correlated (ρS = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.037 – 0.155, p = 0.0015). We also found a

291

significant correlation between our phylogenetically-corrected correlation ρC and the mea-

sure of gene expression coevolution from [12] (ρS = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.171 – 0.275, p < 10−16 ).

Notably, we find overall better agreement between CAI and empirical-based measures of

294

coevolution for protein pairs which are, on average, more highly expressed (Weighted Spear-

Discussion

300

Consistent with previous results, we find physically- interacting proteins show a clear sig-

301

nal of gene expression coevolution compared to randomly-generated pairs of proteins, with

302

mean phylogenetically-corrected correlations ρ̄C of 0.45 vs. 0.03, respectively. We find in-

303

teracting proteins are correlated with the STRING confidence score (weighted Spearman

304

Rank correlation ρS = 0.32), indicating protein-protein interactions with stronger evidence

305

of being true and conserved have stronger coevolution of gene expression, on average. We

306

also find the number of protein-protein interactions a protein is involved in and its gene

307

expression level – two common metrics known to affect the evolution of protein sequence –

308

are overall weak predictors of gene expression coevolution. Protein pairs involved in more

309

interactions do tend to show stronger gene expression coevolution (weighted Spearman rank

310

correlations ρS = 0.26), consistent with the idea that proteins involved in more interactions

311

in a protein-protein interaction network have more constraints on the evolution of their gene

312

expression. Surprisingly, highly expressed protein pairs actually tended to show weaker co-

313

evolution of gene expression (weighted Spearman rank correlation ρS = −0.09). We also

314

find an overall weak correlation between gene expression coevolution and protein sequence

315

coevolution (weighted Spearman rank correlation ρS = 0.10), consistent with previous work

316

[12, 7]. This is likely because relatively small regions of two protein sequences may be impor-

317

tant for the proteins to be able to bind, forcing strong sequence coevolution at the binding

318

sites, but weaker coevolution for the remainder of the protein sequences. Surprisingly, there

319

was overall poor agreement between CAI coevolution from [12] and our measure of of gene

320

expression coevolution based on empirical RNA-Seq data (weighted Spearman Rank corre-

321

lation ρS = 0.22). The stronger correlation between ρC and CAI coevolution compared to

322

protein sequence coevolution is unsurprising. CAI and similar codon usage metrics often

323

show moderate to strong correlations with empirical gene expression estimates. However,

324

the correlation between ρC and CAI coevolution is still very weak, indicating these measures

325

of gene expression coevolution can give radically different interpretations about the degree of

326

gene expression coevolution at the individual protein-pair level. It is worth noting that our

327

estimates of gene expression coevolution and the estimates from [12] do not come from the

328

same 18 species. [12] also used 18 fungal species, 11 of which are from the Saccharmoyces or

329

Candida genera, of which 7 overlap with the species used in this study. This undoubtedly

330

introduced noise into these comparisons. Additionally, empirical gene expression in inher-

331

ently noisy and can vary between conditions, which also will also increase the discrepancy

332

between CAI and gene expression, particularly for low to moderate expression genes. Fortu-

333

nately, many PCMs allow for the incorporation of measurement error, and through the use

334

of multivariate methods, gene expression estimates across conditions can also be compared

335

by treating each condition as an additional trait.

336

Unlike previous approaches, our results are based on a multivariate PCM and empirical

337

gene expression data. This offers two clear advantages. The first is our approach accounts for

338

the phylogeny, recognizing the non-independence of species. The second is although CAI is

339

often well-correlated with gene expression in organisms with a high effective population size

340

[51], many low effective population size species show little adaptive codon usage bias, making

341

CAI a poor proxy for gene expression. As a result, the use of empirical gene expression

342

measurements are highly valuable for studying the evolution of gene expression, as others

343

have noted [1].

344

As with previous work, our results suggest this multivariate PCM could be used to

345

identify functionally-related proteins. However, simulations indicate more species might be

346

needed to have sufficient statistical power (see Table 1). Additionally, it is possible to use

347

this multivariate approach to correlate changes in gene expression with changes in other

348

phenotypes, such as body size (see [40] for more details on using mvMORPH). With that

349

in mind, recent work finds multivariate PCMs are in need of improvement, as parameter

350

estimation accuracy decreases quickly as the number of traits (i.e. parameters) increases

351

[52]. For now, it appears best to restrict the analysis to as few traits as possible.

352

We note very few traits in biology likely evolve in a true Brownian Motion manner [10].

353

Consistent with this, most of the genes in our dataset violated the BM assumption based

354

on the test proposed by [37]. Although the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model may be a more

355

appropriate model, and is, in fact, used in many other PCMs for examining gene expression

356

evolution, it often requires more species to make accurate parameter estimates. As we only

357

used 18 fungal species, we opted to use the simpler Brownian Motion model combined with

358

filtering of genes which significantly deviated from assumptions of the Brownian Motion

359

model [37]. Future work should focus on the examination of coevolution of gene expression

360

using the OU model. Based on our results, inclusion of genes which violate the BM assump-

361

tion does not change overall conclusions of this work, but it does appear to weaken some

362

of the observed signals (see Supplemental Results). Other phylogenetic models, such as the

363

OU model, may be more appropriate for the analysis of gene expression for other gene pairs.

364

A major advantage of PCMs is other models can easily be incorporated into the analysis of

365

the trait, with the best model being determined via a hypothesis testing (e.g. Likelihood

366

ratio test) or model comparison (e.g. AIC) framework.

367

We also note comparison of RNA-Seq data across species presents its own challenges

368

[33, 1, 53]. Other methods for normalizing RNA-Seq data in order to make them com-

369

parable across species have been proposed, but to the best of our knowledge, there is no

370

current consensus on the best approach. [17] developed a method for normalizing gene ex-

371

pression by identifying the genes with the most conserved ranks across samples, calculating

372

species-specific scaling factors to make the median expression of these conserved rank genes

373

equal across all species, and using those scaling factors to re-scale all gene expression es-

374

timates. [1] proposed a method based on comparing fold-changes (differential expression)

375

across species-specific samples, which assumes a clear control and experimental condition

376

and these measurements exists for all species under consideration. [53] proposed a method

377

for re-scaling the TPM metric based on the largest genome in the dataset, but this assumes

378

the genes represented in the smaller genomes are subsets of the genes in the larger genome,

379

which was not the case for our data based on the orthologs we identified. We transformed

380

species-level data to a standard lognormal distribution, consistent with previous work us-

381

ing microarray data [16]. We make no claims that this is the best normalization approach

382

for across species comparisons of RNA-Seq data, but state it was suitable for our overall

383

purpose of determining if functionally-related genes show stronger coevolution of gene ex-

384

pression than randomly-generated pairs. Additionally, the log-transformed data likely better

385

reflects the assumptions of Brownian Motion, as this eliminates the lower bound of 0.0 [37].

386

Furthermore, the RNA-Seq data used in this study were pulled from various non-related

387

experiments which differed in terms of protocols, sequencers, sequencing depth, read type

388

(single vs. paired), experimental conditions, and other factors which could impact the quan-

389

tifications. It cannot be understated that this also introduces large amounts of variability to

390

the quantified RNA-Seq data, making comparisons across species even more difficult. We at-

391

tempted to control for this by using Salmon’s abilities to automatically adjust quantifications

392

based on biases its detects within the RNA-Seq reads, as well as using the control conditions

393

for each species for our analysis. Undoubtedly, this did not control for all of the variability

394

introduced by pulling data from different experiments. Despite this, the normalized gene

395

expression data were moderately to strongly correlated across species (Supplemental Figure

396

1) and species which were more closely related tended to show higher correlations, consistent

397

with expectations. Our results regarding coevolution of gene expression were also mostly

398

consistent with previous work and expectations. However, analyses attempting to make more

399

precise conclusions about the evolution or coevolution of gene expression should ideally use

400

measurements produced under better controlled conditions. Additionally, future efforts in

401

this area may consider using proteomics data as opposed to transcriptomics. Previous work

402

finds protein abundances appear to be more conserved between species compared to mRNA

403

abundances, which could indicate stronger selection on maintaining the former [54].

404

Given our results and the ease of use of many tools implementing PCMs, we strongly

405

recommend the use of PCM approaches when performing interspecies analysis. The phylo-

406

genetic research community has databases where phylogenetic trees can be easily accessed,

407

such as TreeBase [55]. If a phylogenetic tree is not available for the species of interest, mul-

408

tiple sequence alignment tools and phylogenetic tree estimation tools have made building a

409

reasonable phylogenetic tree efficient and easy, even for non-computational researchers. The

410

phylogenetics community has made access to complex phylogenetic parameter estimation

411

accessible via open-source, easy-to-use R packages, such as mvMORPH [40]. Although we

412

strongly recommend the use of PCMs for interspecies data analysis, we emphasize that such

413

approaches come with their own challenges and, in some cases, the PCM may not perform

414

better than standard statistical approaches (see [41] for more details). Even so, approaches

415

for assessing the impact of shared ancestry on the data still requires the generation of a

416

phylogenetic tree and analysis of the trait in a phylogenetic context. Some researchers have

417

also suggested PCMs likely will not provide different results from non-PCMs if analyzing

418

gene expression for a small number of species, with a larger number of species resulting in

419

more complex phylogenetic patterns and complicating the downstream data analyses [23].

420

Researchers should assess the impact of phylogeny of their data and make the appropriate

421

decisions on what tools best answer the questions at hand.
