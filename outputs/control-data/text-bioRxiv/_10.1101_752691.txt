Abstract
The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells
(hMSCs), but its regulation in 3D tissue engineered scaffolds remains poorly studied. hMSCs
cultured on 3D electrospun scaffolds made of a stiff material do not form actin stress fibers,
contrary to hMSCs on 2D films of the same material. On 3D electrospun- and 3D additive
manufactured scaffolds, hMSCs also displayed fewer focal adhesions, lower lamin A and C
expression and less YAP1 nuclear localization. Together, this shows that dimensionality
prevents the build-up of cellular tension, even on stiff materials. Knock down of either lamin
A and C or zyxin resulted in fewer stress fibers in the cell center. Zyxin knock down reduced
lamin A and C expression, but not vice versa, showing that this signal chain starts from the
outside of the cell. Our study demonstrates that dimensionality changes the actin cytoskeleton
through lamin A and C and zyxin, an important insight for future scaffold design, as the actin
network, focal adhesions and nuclear stiffness are all critical for hMSC differentiation.

1. Introduction
Understanding cellular responses to material properties (such as stiffness, chemistry, and
topography) are critical endeavors in fields such as tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular responses can lead
to more intelligent design of tissue engineering constructs.

[1]

Cells adhere to materials

through integrins, forming focal adhesion complexes that connect the actin cytoskeleton to the
extra cellular matrix (ECM).

[2]

The actin filaments attach to other focal adhesions, or to the

nucleus through the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and lamin A
and C.

[3]

Lamin A and C form a protein meshwork under the nuclear membrane to give

structural integrity to the nucleus. [4-6] Actin filaments join together to form stress fibers, with
incorporated non-muscle myosin to create contractile force between its two attachment points.

On stiffer materials, focal adhesions and stress fibers have been shown to be bigger and

more abundant than on softer materials

[8-11]

, creating a higher cellular tension.

[11, 12]

Indeed,

lamin A and C expression, indirectly attached to actin stress fibers, has also been shown to
increase on stiffer materials.

[6]

Besides material stiffness, other factors such as material

chemistry and topography have also been shown to influence focal adhesions, actin stress
fibers and lamin A and C.

[13-15]

Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is an important

mechanosensitive co-transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus at higher cellular
tension to transduce these mechanical changes in the cell to changes in gene expression. [16]
On stiffer materials and with more cellular tension human mesenchymal stromal cells
(hMSCs) show increased osteogenic differentiation, while softer materials and lower cellular
tension enhance differentiation to chondro- and adipogenic lineages.

[17-21]

These changes in

hMSC differentiation have been shown to be orchestrated by actin stress fibers

[22]

, focal

adhesions [22], lamin A and C [23] and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). [24, 25]

While other material properties are relatively well studied, the dimensionality (2D v. 3D) of a
material has not yet been widely studied. All 3D tissue engineering constructs inherently
introduce dimensionality. It is therefore important to understand the effect of dimensionality
on the proteins involved in cellular tension, as they are critical for hMSC differentiation. [22-25]
Some studies have investigated the role of the dimensionality on cellular tension in soft
hydrogels.

[26]

While this gives valuable insights for some tissue engineering applications,

many 3D tissue engineering constructs are made of stiff materials. Therefore, we investigated
the effect of dimensionality in 3D electrospun (ESP) and 3D additive manufactured (AM)
scaffolds and compared to flat films made of the same stiff material (300PEOT55PBT45,
PolyActive™, 100 MPa

[27]

) (Figure 1a). Specifically, we focused on four main parts of the

cellular tension machinery: focal adhesions (zyxin and paxillin), actin cytoskeleton, nuclear
skeleton (lamin A and C) and a mechanosensitive co-transcription factor (YAP1).

We demonstrate that dimensionality influenced the actin stress fiber formation, focal adhesion
formation, lamin A and C expression and YAP1 nuclear localization in these commonly used
3D tissue engineering scaffolds. The 3D scaffolds prevented the build-up of cellular tension,
even on stiff materials, through a decrease in zyxin expression, which decreases lamin A and
C expression and together change the actin cytoskeleton.

2. Results
2.1. Dimensionality prevents formation of actin stress fibers and reduces lamin A and C
To start investigating how dimensionality influences cellular tension in stiff materials, we
looked at the actin cytoskeleton of hMSCs cultured on 3D ESP scaffolds or 2D films for 7
days (Figure 1a). As expected, on 2D films large actin stress fibers formed and F-actin fibers
were distributed throughout the whole cell (Figure 1b). When hMSCs were cultured on ESP
3D scaffolds, we observed far fewer actin stress fibers and a change in F-actin distribution. Factin fibers were mainly located on the cell periphery and very little F-actin was observed in
the cell center or overlapping with the nucleus (Figure 1c). The lack of many stress fibers and
a more pronounced peripheral actin network is a sign of lower cellular tension

[28]

, even

though cells were cultured on stiff materials. F-actin distribution of hMSCs in AM 3D
scaffolds was attempted, but could not be evaluated due to the very high cell density in these
3D constructs. In this high cell density environment, the F-actin distribution of individual
cells could not be discriminated from F-actin of surrounding cells.

To understand why few actin fibers were found overlapping with the cell nucleus, we
evaluated the expression of lamin A and C, a protein that assists in linking actin filaments to
the nucleus.

[3]

After 7 days of culture, lamin A and C expression were significantly reduced

in AM scaffolds, by 30 ± 3.5% (p<0.001) and 46 ± 14% (p<0.05), respectively, compared to
2D films (Figure 1d and Figure S1a). Lamin A and C expression was even more reduced in

hMSCs cultured on the ESP scaffolds, by 85 ± 6.5% (p<0.01) and 91 ± 8.0% (p<0.05),
respectively, compared to those cultured on 2D films. The same trend was observed for
polystyrene, a stiffer material: cells expressed 44 ± 4.7% (p<0.01) less lamin A and 71 ± 6.5%
(p<0.01) less lamin C when cultured on AM 3D scaffolds, compared to 2D films (Figure 1e
and Figure S1b).

To determine how lamin A and C expression changed over the culture period, we measured
their expression levels at days 1, 4, and 7 (Figure 1f and Figure S2). Lamin A and C
expression in hMSCs cultured on the 3D ESP or AM scaffolds remained low at all time points.
In comparison, lamin A and C steadily increased over time in hMSCs cultured on 2D films.
Lamin A was 3.2 ± 0.43 and 6.2 ± 1.0 times higher after day 4 and day 7, respectively,
compared to day 1. Lamin C was 3.7 ± 1.0 and 8.4 ± 3.5 times higher on day 4 and day 7,
respectively, compared to day 1. These findings show that due to the dimensionality, lamin A
and C expression remains low over the culture period, in contrast to 2D, where lamin A and C
expression increases over time.

2.2. Reduced nuclear stiffness of cells cultured in 3D
To test whether the change in lamin A and C expression affected nuclear stiffness, we
observed hMSC migration from 2D films or 3D scaffolds, through a transwell with 3-µm or
8-µm pores. It has been shown that cells with high levels of lamin A and C (conferring greater
nuclear stiffness) can migrate through 8-µm pores but are unable to move through 3-µm pores.
[29]

Indeed, cells cultured on 2D films and harboring higher lamin A and C expression

migrated less well through 3-µm pores than through 8-µm pores (p<0.05) (Figure 2a). Cells
migrating from ESP scaffolds migrated equally well through 3-µm or 8-µm pores. The ratio
of hMSCs migrating through 3-µm pores to those not migrating was significantly higher from
ESP scaffolds than 2D films (p<0.01). hMSCs on AM scaffolds did not have sufficient

physical contact with the transwells to migrate from the AM scaffold to the transwell
membrane (data not shown), so their migration ability could not be evaluated. These data
indicate that lower lamin A and C expression from hMSCS in 3D ESP resulted in lower
nuclear stiffness of the cells, compared to hMSCs grown on 2D films.
In addition to migration ability, nuclear stiffness was also assessed morphologically. While a
stiff nucleus shows a uniform shape, lower nuclear stiffness results in more heterogeneous
shapes and more ‘folds’.

[30, 31]

Indeed, nuclei of cells cultured in 2D showed mostly uniform

nuclei, with folds in 33 ± 11% nuclei. From hMSCs on the 3D scaffolds, 76 ± 12% (p<0.01)
and 96 ± 4% (p<0.0001) of nuclei displayed folds from AM and ESP scaffolds, respectively
(Figure S3).
Together, these observations demonstrate that lower lamin A and C expression, resulting from
the dimensionality of the 3D scaffolds compared to 2D films composed of the same stiff
material, reduced nuclear stiffness, an observation not previously reported.

2.3. Lamin A and C plays a role in shaping the F-actin network
Actin tension has been shown to influence lamin A and C expression [32], but the role of lamin
A and C in shaping the actin network is not known. To investigate this, cells were transduced
with LMNA shRNA, knocking down both lamin A and C (Figure S4), and stained for F-actin
(Figure 2b). A large change in actin organization was observed in the LMNA knock down.
Similar to the actin organization of hMSCs on 3D ESP scaffolds, the LMNA knock down
showed a clear decrease in F-actin in the cell center and over the nucleus (Figure 2c and d).
Thus, lamin A and C plays an important role in shaping the actin network and could be partly
responsible for the difference in actin organization in 2D vs 3D.

2.4. Cell density does not explain differences in lamin A and C expression observed
between 2D and 3D

Because cell density inherently differs between 2D and 3D substrates, we wished to determine
whether it was the reason for the differences we observed in lamin A and C expression. To
determine the influence of cell density on lamin A and C expression, we cultured hMSCs for
7 days with different cell seeding densities on 2D TCP (Figure 3a). The different cell
densities were chosen to reach confluency after 1 day (20k cells/cm2), 2 days (10k cells/cm2),
or roughly 40%, 60%, 70%, or 80% confluency after 7 days (1.25k, 2.5k and 5k cells/cm2,
respectively), or little cell contact after 7 days (625 cells/cm2). Increasing cell seeding density
increased lamin A and C expression after 7 days of culture (Figure 3a and Figure S5a). At 20k
cells/cm2, lamin A and C expression were 3.7 ± 1.7 (p<0.05) and 5.3 ± 1.7 (p<0.01) times
higher than at 1.25k cells/cm2, respectively.

As lamin A and C were influenced by cell density in 2D, we next examined whether this was
also true in the 3D scaffolds. For the 3D ESP scaffolds, different cell densities were chosen to
have confluency after 1 day (120k cells/scaffold), near confluency after 7 days (30k
cells/scaffold), or little cell contact after 7 days (10k cells/scaffold). For 3D AM scaffolds,
confluency is more difficult to determine. With 400k cells/scaffold, most pores are filled after
1-2 days of culture. With 200k and 100k cells/scaffold, full pores are attained after 4–5 and 7
days of culture, respectively. Importantly, little cell proliferation was observed in 3D AM
scaffolds (data not shown), thus the increased filling of the scaffold is not related to
proliferation, unlike cells on 3D ESP or 2D TCP.
Similar to 2D TCP, increasing cell seeding density significantly increased lamin A expression
in 3D ESP scaffolds, with 2.5 ± 0.1 (p<0.001) and 3.7 ± 1.0 (p<0.05) times more lamin A
from 30k and 120k cells/scaffold, respectively, compared to 10k cells/scaffold (Figure 3c).
Lamin C expression was not significantly changed by cell density on the ESP 3D scaffold,
with 2.1 ± 1.0 and 1.9 ± 0.87 times more lamin C expression from 30k and 120k cells/scaffold

compared to the 10k cells/scaffold (Figure S5c). Interestingly, cell density on the AM 3D
scaffolds did not influence the lamin A or C expression (Figure 3b and Figure S5b).

At 5k/cm2, cells don’t reach full confluency on 2D films after 7 days, while cells are fully
confluent after seeding at 120k/scaffold (Figure 3d). Lamin A and C expression was still
much higher on 2D films than on ESP seeded at this high cell density, regardless of the
increase in lamin A and C with increased cell density. This shows that even though lamin A
and C increase with increased cell density, it does not explain the differences observed here
between 2D and 3D cell culture systems.

2.5. Less focal adhesions in 3D environments
To understand why lamin A and C expression and the actin organization change in response
to dimensionality, we looked at focal adhesion formation of cells cultured on 3D AM- or ESP
scaffolds, compared to 2D films. As expected, many large focal adhesions were found on flat
films, visualized by paxillin staining, an important focal adhesion protein (Figure 4a). Very
few and faint focal adhesions were observed in cells cultured in the 3D AM- and ESP
scaffolds. Expression of paxillin was also reduced in both 3D AM- and 3D ESP scaffolds,
75% ± 18% (p<0.05) and 57% ± 11% (p<0.05), respectively (Figure 4b).

Less focal adhesions in response to dimensionality correlates to the reduced lamin A and C
expression in response to dimensionality. In 2D lamin A and C increased with higher cell
seeding densities. To see whether focal adhesion formation also follows the same correlation
in 2D, focal adhesion formation and paxillin expression were analyzed in different cell
densities in 2D TCP. Indeed, at a lower cell density (625 cells/cm2), fewer focal adhesions
formed than at higher cell densities (20k/cm2) (Figure 4c). Paxillin expression followed this
trend, where at 20k/cm2 paxillin expression was 2.0 ± 0.43 times higher than at 1.25k/cm2

(p<0.05) (Figure 4d). In ESP, where increased cell seeding density also increased lamin A and
C, higher cell densities also showed an increase in focal adhesions (Figure S6a). An increase
in paxillin expression was visible, but not statistically significantly different (Figure S6b).

Together, these data shows that dimensionality reduces focal adhesion formation, compared to
2D. In addition, a positive correlation between focal adhesions and lamin A and C expression
was found, hinting at a possible connection between the two.

2.6. Cellular tension reduced in 3D cultures
YAP1 translocates to the nucleus when there is higher cellular tension.

[33]

To determine

whether cellular tension changes in response to dimensionality, we measured the nuclear
translocation of YAP1 in hMSCs cultured on AM or ESP scaffolds, compared to flat films
(Figure 4f). From both AM and ESP scaffolds, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of YAP1 was
significantly lower (0.3 ± 0.1 (p<0.0001) and 0.7 ± 0.2 (p<0.0001), respectively, compared to
that on 2D films 1.9 ± 0.7) (Figure 4e); these low ratios show that more YAP1 remained in
the cytoplasm than translocated to the nucleus. The lack of YAP1 nuclear translocation
indicates that the dimensionality of the 3D cultures causes a lower cellular tension in hMSCs.
This finding is in line with the reduced focal adhesions, actin stress fibers and lamin A and C
expression in response to dimensionality.

Previous work proposed that YAP1 regulates lamin A and C.

[6, 34]

To test if YAP1 plays a

role in lamin A and C expression, we knocked down YAP1 in hMSCs cultured on TCP and
determined the levels of lamin A and C expression. No difference in lamin A or C expression
was found between scrambled control and YAP1 knock-downs. This shows that lamin A and
C is not regulated through YAP1 (Figure S7) and indicates that the lower lamin A and C
levels in the 3D scaffolds are not due to a lack of YAP1 activity in the 3D scaffolds.

2.7. Zyxin influences lamin A and C expression and actin organization
The dimensionality caused low lamin A and C levels and few focal adhesions and actin stress
fibers. We next determined whether the focal adhesions are involved in controlling the low
lamin A and C expression and resulting changed actin network. Zyxin is known to be critical
for focal adhesion formation and the connection to the actin cytoskeleton

[35, 36]

, and was

therefore chosen as target to diminish the focal adhesion formation. We knocked down zyxin
in hMSCs using two different ZYX-shRNAs (Figure S8), cultured the cells on TCP, then
measured lamin A and C expression and evaluated the actin network.
Lamin A was reduced 92 ± 5% (p<0.01) and 71 ± 13% (p<0.05) and lamin C reduced 86 ±
11% and 76 ± 19% by the two ZYX-shRNAs, respectively, compared to the scrambled
control (Figure 5a, Figure S9). In the ZYX knockdowns, less actin was observed in the cell
center and over the nucleus, while more F-actin was found in the cell periphery compared to
that of the scrambled control (Figure 5c and d), a localization pattern similar to the LMNA
knockdown and cells cultured on ESP scaffolds (Figure 1). The reduction of stress fibers after
ZYX knockdown is in line with previous reports. [35, 36]
Zyxin also greatly reduced the number and intensity of paxillin positive focal adhesions,
although it could still be visualized (Figure S10), also in line with previous reports.

[37]

Paxillin is an important protein for the downstream signaling of focal adhesions. [38] To test if
lamin A and C expression are influenced by paxillin, we knocked paxillin down. No
difference was observed in lamin A or C expression, demonstrating that the reduction of
lamin A and C following zyxin knock down does not occur through paxillin (Figure S7).
To test whether the influence of zyxin on lamin A and C expression is bidirectional, we
looked at zyxin expression in LMNA knock-downs. Zyxin expression and focal adhesion
formation were similar in LMNA knockdowns and scrambled controls (Figure 5e and f),
demonstrating that lamin A and C expression does not affect zyxin levels. Furthermore, these

data suggest that the faint focal adhesions we observed from hMSCs on 3D scaffolds (Figure
4a) were not due to the low lamin A and C expression.
Interestingly, in both ZYX and LMNA knockdowns, YAP1 was still located mainly in the
nucleus (Figure S11). This indicates that the lack of YAP1 nuclear localization in 3D is
through a mechanism independent of lamin A and C or zyxin.

2.8. A model for actin fiber formation mediated by lamin A and C and zyxin in 2D v. 3D
Our data comes together in the model depicted in Figure 5g. In 3D, dimensionality prevents
focal adhesion formation, which leads to a decrease in lamin A and C. The lack of both zyxin
and lamin A and C then shapes the actin network and does not allow for the formation of actin
stress fibers through the cell center. In 2D, the lack of dimensionality allows for the formation
of many large focal adhesions, leading to an increase in lamin A and C. High zyxin and lamin
A and C expression then allow for the formation of high cellular tension and large actin stress
fibers. This mechanism is independent of both YAP1 and paxillin.

3. Discussion
In this study, we show that hMSCs cultured in 3D ESP or AM scaffolds exhibit low cellular
tension, even on stiff materials. This was visualized by a decrease in focal adhesions, lamin A
and C expression, YAP nuclear localization and actin stress fibers on 3D ESP and AM
scaffolds, compared to 2D films of the same material. We show that zyxin influences lamin A
and C expression, but not vise-versa. Both zyxin and lamin A and C play a role in the
formation of stress fibers in the cell center, and are partly responsible for the different actin
organization in 3D.

Fraley et al. also showed a decrease in focal adhesions in response to dimensionality in or on
hydrogels.

[26]

Also, in a 3D in vivo environment, focal adhesions were found to be very

different in shape and composition from 2D cultures.

[39]

How dimensionality initiates a

difference in the focal adhesion protein zyxin and focal adhesion formation has not been
studied here and remains unclear. Potential mechanisms include a difference in force
distribution. On concave surfaces, focal adhesion formation and lamin A and C have been
shown to decrease when compared to flat surfaces, while they increase on convex surfaces.
[40]

This indicates that the force distribution within the cell and the angle at which it is

connected to the environment (partly) determines focal adhesion formation and lamin A and C
expression. We hypothesize that because of the dimensionality, forces are not distributed over
the nucleus like in 2D, but more throughout the whole cell and along the cell periphery, which
could explain the more peripheral actin network in 3D environments. The knock down of
lamin A and C could mimic what happens in a 3D environment, where forces can no longer
be distributed to the nucleus, which leads to the lack of actin stress fibers near the nucleus.
Indeed, stress fibers and focal adhesions can still be found in the LMNA knock downs, but are
then located almost exclusively in the cell periphery (Figure 2b, 2c, 5f).

We found that YAP1 was excluded from the nucleus on ESP and AM scaffolds, in contrast to
2D films. However, in LMNA and ZYX knockdowns, YAP1 was still located in the nucleus.
The opening of nuclear pores due to force on the nucleus has been shown to allow YAP1 to
enter the nucleus.

[33]

A possible explanation is that because of the lower nuclear stiffness in

both LMNA and ZYX knockdowns (due to lack of lamin A and C), YAP1 can enter the
nucleus even if the cell is under less tension.

[33]

In 3D, the nucleus might be under less

tension, as forces are distributed in all 3 dimensions, whereas in 2D forces are mostly
concentrated in two directions, pushing down on the nucleus.

[33]

This lack of tension on the

nucleus could potentially result in avoiding YAP1 to enter the nucleus in 3D.

Here, we have presented a novel link between lamin A and C and the actin cytoskeleton, and
lamin A and C and focal adhesions, specifically zyxin. We have found that this process is not
mediated by YAP1. Other mechanosensitive (co-)transcription factors could be inhibited to
look at the effect on lamin A and C and zyxin, to find the signaling pathway involved in
orchestrating the differences in expression in 3D environments.

Decoupling individual variables in 2D vs 3D in stiff materials remains challenging. Local and
bulk material properties can change when creating scaffolds, potentially affecting cell
behavior. Also, ECM produced by cells can be influenced, directly changing the environment.
Using hydrogels, 2D vs 3D can be more strictly controlled. We show here for the first time
that in stiff materials, the same reduction in cellular tension is observed when cells are
cultured in a 3D environment.

[26]

This can have important implications, as it is known that

differentiation is highly influenced by cellular tension, YAP1, lamin A and C, focal adhesions
and actin stress fibers.

[22-25]

Our data shows that using stiff materials might not be sufficient

to induce high cellular tension when cells are cultured in 3D. Also, soft tissue constructs could
still be made of relatively stiff materials, if the dimensionality decreases cellular tension to
still allow for effective differentiation to soft tissue lineages. An optimized microenvironment
could include different concave or convex surfaces, different pore geometries or mechanical
loading to optimize the cellular tension and differentiation of hMSCs in 3D tissue engineering
constructs.

4. Conclusion
Here, we study the effect of dimensionality on cellular tension of hMSCs in two common 3D
tissue engineering constructs: ESP and AM scaffolds. We demonstrate that dimensionality
causes fewer stress fibers, fewer focal adhesion, lower lamin A and C expression, less YAP1

nuclear localization. Cell density influences lamin A and C expression and focal adhesion
formation in 2D and 3D, but it is not responsible for the observed differences between 2D and
3D, further proving that dimensionality is an important environmental factor. Lamin A and C
or zyxin knock down result resulted in fewer stress fibers in the cell center and over the
nucleus. Zyxin knock down also reduced lamin A and C expression, but not vice versa,
showing that this signal chain starts from the outside of the cell. Taken together, our study
shows dimensionality changes the actin cytoskeleton through lamin A and C and zyxin and
decreases cellular tension, even on stiff materials. This can have important implications for
future scaffold design, as proteins involved in cellular tension also play key functions in
hMSC differentiation.

5. Experimental Section
Scaffold production
Poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate) and poly(butylene terephthalate) random block co-polymer
(PEOT/PBT, 300PEOT55PBT45, PolyActive™) with 300 Da PEO and a PEOT/PBT weight
ratio of 55/45 was acquired from PolyVation. Polystyrene (PS, 350 kDa) was acquired from
Sigma-Aldrich. PEOT/PBT or PS films were produced by melting the polymer in a circular
23-mm mold between two silicon wafers (Si-mat, Kaufering, Germany) and two hot plates
under slight pressure (~100 kg) to ensure films were fully flat. PEOT/PBT was processed at
180 °C and PS at 210 °C.

AM scaffolds were produced by means of screw-extrusion–based fused deposition modeling
(FDM) (Bioscaffolder SYSENG, Germany). The FDM extrusion is controlled by the screw
rotation and assisted by N2 (5 bar) gas pressure allowing fine control over deposition of the
molten polymer. The manufacturing of the 20×20×4 mm scaffolds was achieved following a

layer-by-layer manufacturing with 90° rotation between deposited layers. The 3D scaffold
CAD models were uploaded into PrimCAM software (Primus Data, Switzerland) and the
deposition patterns were calculated. The fiber spacing, defined as the distance between
successive fibers in the same layer was defined as 650 µm, the layer thickness was set to 170
µm, and the fiber diameter obtained was according to the nozzle diameter used, the polymer
selected and the processing parameters. The parameters that influence the production of the
3D scaffolds are: temperature, screw rotation, deposition velocity. PEOT/PBT or PS pellets
were loaded in the reservoir and molten at a temperature of 195 °C or 220 °C, respectively.
The screw rotation for the polymers was 200 rpm. The molten polymer was extruded through
a nozzle with G25 (I.D. = 250 µm). The deposition velocity was optimized to 20 and 200
mm·min-1 for PS and PEOT/PBT, respectively.

To produce ESP scaffolds, 20% (w v-1) 300PEOT55PBT45 was dissolved in a mixture of
70% chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30% 1.1,1.3,3.3-Hexafluoro-2-propanol AR (HFIP;
Bio-Solve) overnight under agitation at room temperature. Electrospinning was done on a
mandrel (diameter: 19 cm) rotating at 100 rpm to produce many scaffolds at the same time
under exactly the same conditions. The following conditions were maintained: 15 cm working
distance, 1 ml h-1 flow rate, 23–25 °C and 40% humidity. The mandrel was charged between 2 and -5 kV and the needle between 10–15 kV. ESP scaffolds were spun on aluminum foil
over a polyester mesh with 12-mm holes. After spinning, ESP scaffolds with a diameter of 15
mm were punched out and scaffolds were removed from the aluminum foil. This method
yielded ESP scaffolds of 12 mm with a 1.5-mm supporting ring of polyester mesh around
them to improve handleability. Fibers were deposited randomly with a diameter of 0.99 ± 0.18
µm, creating mats of approximately 50-µm thick.

Before cell culture, films, AM and ESP scaffolds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 15 min
and dried until visually dry. The films and scaffolds were then coated with 1 mg ml-1 rat-tail
collagen I solution for 16 h at 37 °C. After coating, they were washed twice with water and
air-dried before cell seeding.

Cell culture
For expansion, hMSCs were cultured on TCP at 1000 cells/cm2 in αMEM + 10% fetal bovine
serum (basic medium) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), until 70–80% confluent. All experiments
were performed at passage 5. Films were punched with a diameter of 22 mm and cultured in
non-treated, 12-well plates at 5k cells/cm2, unless stated otherwise. ESP scaffolds were 15
mm and cultured in 24-well plates at 30k cells/scaffold, unless stated otherwise, with a rubber
O-ring (outer diameter 15 mm, inner diameter 12 mm) to prevent the scaffolds from floating
and to cover the polyester ring on which the scaffolds were produced. AM scaffolds were
square blocks of 5×5×3 mm (width, length, height) and cells were seeded in a drop of 50 µl
containing 400k cells, unless stated otherwise. Two hours after seeding, the AM scaffold was
flipped upside down to increase cell distribution. After a total of 4 h after seeding, scaffolds
were transferred to a non-treated, 12-well plate for further culture. Film and scaffold cultures
were done in basic medium supplemented with 1 ng ml-1 FGF-2 (Neuromics), 200 µM LAscorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 U ml-1 penicillin-streptomycin, and were
harvested after 7 d of culture, unless stated otherwise.

Protein isolation and western blot
Proteins were isolated from cells cultured on films or scaffolds in RIPA buffer (SigmaAldrich), supplemented with cOmplete™, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich). To get sufficient proteins, 6–12 films, 15–20 ESP scaffolds or 2–4 AM
scaffolds were mixed into 300–400 µl lysis buffer for a single protein isolate. Experiments

were repeated 3 or 4 times for replicates. For TCP and films, surfaces were scraped with cell
scrapers to ensure cell lysis. AM scaffolds were cut into four smaller pieces and submerged in
lysis buffer. ESP scaffolds were removed from the polyester supporting ring and submerged
in lysis buffer. Samples were spun down at 10.000g, and the supernatant was used for further
processing.

Protein quantification was done using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Twenty micrograms of protein was incubated with laemmli loading buffer (BioRad) and 10% 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded into a 4–
15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a 0.45 µm PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad) using the semi-dry transfer method. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% fat
free milk powder (Bio-Rad) in TBS + 0.05% tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich). All primary antibody
incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer. All antibodies (lamin A and
C: ab108595; paxillin: ab32084; zyxin: ab58210; YAP1: ab52771; TBP: ab51841) were
ordered from Abcam and diluted 1/1000, except for YAP1 which was diluted 1/500. Blots
were subsequently incubated with 0.33 µg ml-1 goat-anti-rabbit or mouse horseradish
peroxidase (Bio-Rad) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were then
visualized using Clarity Western ECL (Bio-Rad). Quantifications of band intensity were done
in Fiji using the gel quantification tool.

Immunofluorescence and imaging
Prior to staining, hMSCs were fixed in 3.6% (v v-1) paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in
PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized and blocked in 2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (VWR) and 0.1% triton X (VWR) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
Antibodies mentioned above, in the same dilution, were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 2%
BSA and 0.05% tween-20 in PBS (incubation buffer). Secondary antibodies goat-anti-rabbit

or mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were then incubated overnight at 4 °C
in incubation buffer. Instead of antibody staining, F-actin staining was done with phalloidin
Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 20 min in PBS+0.05%
tween-20. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were taken on a widefield
fluorescence microscope, or confocal microscope. To allow for quantitative comparison
between images, all images within an experiment were taken with the same settings and on
the same day.
Actin quantification was done using a custom-built Fiji macro (paper in submission). A line
was drawn through the cell perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, and the intensity over
that line was measured. The intensity distribution was divided into 10 equal bins to correct for
differences in cell size. The total F-actin intensity overlapping with the nucleus was also
measured.
For YAP1 quantification, the nucleus and an area in the cytoplasm were selected and the
overall pixel intensity in each area was measured using Fiji. The ratio between nuclear and
cytoplasmic intensity was then calculated per cell.

Migration assay
As a functional read-out for nuclear stiffness

[29]

, hMSCs were allowed to migrate directly

from films or ESP scaffolds through a Fluoroblok 24-well transwell with 3-µm or 8-µm pores.
hMSCs were first cultured on 6-mm films or ESP scaffolds for 7 days in standard scaffold
culture conditions (see ‘Cell culture’) and then transferred upside down on the transwell
membrane. αMEM without serum was added to the top compartment and basic medium was
added to the bottom compartment, to induce cell migration. A screw and nut were placed on
top of the film or ESP scaffold as a weight to ensure proper contact between the substrate and
transwell. After fixation (see ‘Immunofluorescence and imaging’), the film or ESP scaffold
was removed, and the transwells were stained with Syto14 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

whole transwell was imaged, top and bottom, and cells were quantified using particle analysis
in Fiji.

Lentiviral production for shRNA delivery
To deliver shRNA for gene knock-down, we produced lentiviruses using TRC pLKO.1
constructs from Dharmacon. We used the following clone IDs for LMNA: TRCN0000061833
and

TRCN0000061836;

TRCN0000123134

and

and

TRCN0000074205;

PXN:

YAP1:

TRCN0000107265

and

TRCN0000107266. To produce the lentiviral particles, human embryonic kidney 293FT
(HEK) cells were seeded at 60k cells/cm2 in a TCP dish in DMEM + 10% FBS. The next day,
HEK cells were transfected with pMDLg pRRE, pMD2.G, pRSV Rev (Addgene) and one of
the pLKO.1 plasmids containing the shRNA, using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in ratio of 5:1 (µl:µg of DNA). After overnight incubation, the medium was
changed to basic medium for hMSCs. Viral particles were harvested after 24 and 48 h, and
filtered through a 0.45-µm filter.

The day before transduction, hMSCs were thawed at 1k cells/cm2 in a 10-cm dish. 3 milliliters
of unconcentrated virus was added to the dish and incubated overnight. The medium was
changed for basic medium the following day, and the medium was changed for basic medium
+ 2 µg ml-1 puromycin at 48–72 h later. Cells were treated for 72 h with puromycin. At 9–10
days after initial thawing, cells were passaged at 1k cells/cm2 and cultured for 7 days in basic
medium before protein harvest or fixation.

experiment were randomly assigned to an experimental group. Cells that were imaged for
quantification were also randomly picked. All data was tested for normal distribution using
the Shapiro-Wilk test. To test the significance of relative expression data with one comparison,
a two-tailed ratio t-test was performed, or the Mann-Whitney test as non-parametric
equivalent. For relative expression data with multiple comparisons, the log of each value was
used for a repeated measures ANOVA, with Tukey’s post hoc to compare individual groups.
For non-relative comparisons, a One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc, or Two-way
ANOVA with Sidak’s post-hoc was used, or the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc as
non-parametric equivalent. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.

differences in actin fiber formation, focal adhesion and lamin A and C in 3D (left) v 2D
(right.) In 3D, cellular tension forces (grey arrows) are distributed in multiple directions and
focal adhesions (light grey ovals) stay small and few. The reduction of focal adhesions then
leads to a reduction in lamin A and C expression (red oval). Together, small and few focal
adhesions and low lamin A and C expression then lead to the lack of actin stress fibers (green
lines) through the cell center. In 2D, cellular tension forces (grey arrows) are distributed along
a single plane, allowing for the build-up tension and large focal adhesions (light grey ovals).
This leads to an increase in lamin A and C expression (red oval). Large focal adhesions and
high lamin A and C expression then enable the formation of actin stress fibers (green lines)
through the cell center.
