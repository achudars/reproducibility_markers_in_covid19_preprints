Abstract

21

The Tier 1 select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental bacterium

22

that causes melioidosis, a high mortality disease. Variably present genetic markers used

23

to elucidate strain origin, relatedness and virulence in B. pseudomallei include the

24

Burkholderia intracellular motility factor A (bimA) and filamentous hemagglutinin 3

25

(fhaB3) gene variants. Three lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen types in B. pseudomallei

26

have been described, which vary in proportion between Australian and Asian isolates.

27

However, it remains unknown if these LPS types can be used as genetic markers for

28

geospatial analysis within a contiguous melioidosis-endemic region. Using a combination

29

of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), statistical analysis and geographical mapping, we

30

examined if the LPS types can be used as geographical markers in the Northern Territory,

31

Australia. The clinical isolates revealed that LPS A prevalence was highest in the Darwin

32

and surrounds (n = 660; 96% being LPS A and 4% LPS B) and LPS B in the Katherine and

33

Katherine remote and East Arnhem regions (n = 79; 60% being LPS A and 40% LPS B).

34

Bivariate logistics regression of 999 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates revealed that the

35

odds of getting a clinical isolate with LPS B was highest in East Arnhem in comparison to

36

Darwin and surrounds (OR 19.5, 95% CI 9.1 – 42.0; p<0.001). This geospatial correlation

37

was subsequently confirmed by geographically mapping the LPS type from 340

38

environmental Top End strains. We also found that in the Top End, the minority bimA

39

genotype bimABm has a similar remote region geographical footprint to that of LPS B. In

40

addition, correlation of LPS type with multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was strong, and

41

where multiple LPS types were identified within a single sequence type, WGS confirmed

42

homoplasy of the MLST loci. The clinical, sero-diagnostic and vaccine implications of

43

geographically-based B. pseudomallei LPS types, and their relationships to regional and

Author Summary

48

Burkholderia pseudomallei is a pathogenic soil bacterium that causes the disease

49

melioidosis, which occurs in many tropical regions globally and in recent years has

50

emerged in non-tropical regions. Melioidosis has been predicted to affect 165,000 people

51

every year resulting in an estimated 89,000 deaths. Person to person transmission is rare

52

with most cases linked to exposure to the bacterium from the environment. The genetic

53

background of B. pseudomallei has been well studied and variably present genes have

54

been linked to distinct melioidosis disease states and geographic regions, however we

55

still need a stronger understanding of the association of genes with geography. Three

56

lipopolysaccharide types exist in B. pseudomallei and the prevalence of the

57

lipopolysaccharide genes vary between melioidosis endemic regions, but it is unknown if

58

the lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers in a single melioidosis-

59

endemic region. In this study, we used a combination of whole-genome sequencing,

60

statistics and geographical mapping to elucidate if the three lipopolysaccharide genes can

61

be used as geographical markers within the Northern Territory, Australia. We show that

62

the three LPS types have distinct but overlapping geographical footprints within a single

63

melioidosis region and can be used as geographic markers alongside a number of other

64

important variably present B. pseudomallei genes.

Introduction

67

Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, an often fatal

68

disease that is endemic in tropical regions globally, including the “Top End” of the

69

Northern Territory, Australia (1). Clinical presentations of melioidosis are highly varied (2-

70

5) with pneumonia being the most common presentation (6). Melioidosis mortality rates

71

range from <10% in the NT to >40% in regions of Asia and Southeast Asia where prompt

72

diagnosis and accessibility to drugs and hospital care can be limited (2, 6, 7). Global

73

melioidosis mortality has been predicted to be considerably higher than mortality from

74

dengue and leptospirosis combined and similar to that from measles (8). In addition, the

75

bio-threat status of B. pseudomallei and the lack of a current vaccine makes this

76

organism of high importance to public health in many regions globally.

77
78

Variable genetic markers in B. pseudomallei with known geographical associations

79

include the mutually exclusive Burkholderia intracellular motility factor A (BimA) variants

80

bimABm and bimABp, the filamentous hemagglutinin 3 (fhaB3) gene and the Burkholderia

81

thailandensis-like flagellum and chemotaxis (BTFC/YLF) gene clusters (9, 10). These

82

genetic markers have been used to elucidate strain relatedness, origin and virulence

83

potential, with bimABm being strongly linked to neurological melioidosis in Australian

84

studies (9). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. pseudomallei, a type II O-polysaccharide

85

(11), consists of A, B and B2 variants (12). As with bimABm/bimABp, YLF/BTFC, and fhaB3,

86

the distribution of LPS genotypes varies between Australia and Southeast Asia (9, 12). In

87

Thailand and Australia, LPS type A is the most abundant, followed by LPS B, whereas LPS

88

B2 has not been detected in Thailand but has been detected in Australia (12). Despite

89

regional differences in LPS genotype prevalence, the distribution of these types across

different geographical regions within a single melioidosis-endemic region has not been

91

thoroughly investigated. Elucidating the geospatial patterns of LPS genotypes is

92

potentially important for B. pseudomallei virulence studies, the development of LPS-

93

based sero-diagnostics, and for consideration of vaccines that have an LPS component.

94
95

In this study, we used a combination of WGS, bivariate logistic regression (with the

96

cluster feature) and geographical mapping to examine the geographical distribution of

97

LPS types in the Top End region. We first investigated LPS geographic correlations using a

98

large number of clinical isolates (n = 1005) from our 28-year Darwin Prospective

99

Melioidosis study (DPMS). We then investigated LPS type distributions for 340

100

environmental strains collected from known Top End locations to determine whether LPS

101

genotypes for clinical isolates, which have usually only presumptive infection locale data,

102

matched that of the environmental isolates, where location is definite. Lastly, we

103

determined bimABm/bimABp diversity in the 340 environmental strains to determine

104

whether the bimA variants and LPS types share similar geographical footprints in the NT.

111

B. pseudomallei isolates used in this study. A total of 1,345 B. pseudomallei isolates from

112

the Top End region were used in this study for bivariate analysis and geographical

113

mapping. 1,005 clinical isolates were included in this study and 999 (excluding the 6 B2

114

strains) were used for bivariate statistical analysis, and environmental isolates (n = 340)

115

were used for geographical mapping. The 1,005 clinical isolates were primary B.

116

pseudomallei isolates corresponding to 1,005 patients enrolled in the 28-year DPMS. The

117

clinical isolates were assigned to one of four Top End geographic regions based on the

118

presumptive location of infection and these regions have been segregated and assigned

119

as outlined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (https://www.abs.gov.au/; statistical

120

area level 3): Darwin and surrounds; Darwin remote (includes West Arnhem), Katherine

121

and Katherine remote, and East Arnhem (Fig 1). Melioidosis is very uncommon in the

122

southern half of the NT and this region was not included in our study.

Results

182

LPS B is linked to remote Top End regions of the Northern territory. BLAST analysis

183

demonstrated that overall in the Top End, LPS A was dominant in both environmental B.

184

pseudomallei strains (A = 89%; LPS B = 10% and LPS B2 = 1%) and in clinical strains (LPS A

185

= 87%; LPS B = 12% and LPS B2 = 1%) (Table 1). Using the clinical B. pseudomallei dataset,

186

we performed bivariate logistics regression (with the cluster feature) of LPS type A and B

187

correlations and presumptive infecting locale, using Darwin urban as the reference level.

188

Low LPS B2 numbers (n=6) precluded statistical analysis of this genotype, leaving 999

189

DPMS isolates for the analysis. Of these six B2 isolates, five were from presumptive

190

infections occurring in Katherine and Katherine remote communities, with the remaining

191

LPS B2 strain linked to infection in the Darwin and surrounding region. Bivariate logistics

192

regression adjusted with the cluster feature demonstrated that the odds of getting a

193

clinical isolate with LPS B in the Darwin remote, Katherine and Katherine remote and East

194

Arnhem regions, respectively is 4.7 (95% CI 2.4 – 9.6; p<0.001), 14.6 (95% CI 6.1 – 34.7;

195

p<0.001) and 19.5 (95% CI 9.1 – 42.0; p<0.001) times higher compared to the odds in the

196

Darwin and surrounding region. LPS B prevalence was highest in patients infected in the

197

Katherine and Katherine remote and East Arnhem regions (n = 79; 64% of LPS B isolates),

198

whereas LPS A prevalence was highest in patients infected in the Darwin and surrounds

199

and Darwin remote regions (n = 756; 86% of LPS A isolates).

Geographic clustering of LPS types was also observed in NT environmental strains.

207

Geographical mapping of LPS types for the environmental isolates also supported the link

between LPS and geography. LPS type A was predominant in Darwin and surrounds

209

(Table 1 and Fig 2B), whilst LPS B was found in all four geographical regions but with

210

numbers highest in the Katherine and Katherine remote region (Fig 2A and B, number of

211

LPS B strains at each site is indicated). LPS B2 from environmental strains was only

212

observed in the Katherine remote region (n = 1). In non-Top End comparator strains, LPS

213

A was also the dominant genotype (range=63-91%), followed by B (range=9-24%) and B2

214

(range=0-18%). Numbers of the LPS type A, B, and B2, respectively, were as follows:

229

81; 9% of LPS A’s; P<0.001) and ST-132 (n= 67; 8% of LPS A’s; P<0.001), whilst LPS B was

230

associated with rare STs that are uncommon in the Darwin regions (data not shown).

231

These associations therefore reflected the LPS geographical associations observed in

232

clinical strains. Although LPS B2 was not included in the statistical analysis it was found in

233

strains belonging to rare STs (ST-331 n = 1; ST-737 n = 2; ST-770 n = 2; ST-118 n = 1) with

234

four of the STs unique to the Katherine and Katherine remote region. Of the STs

235

identified in the 1,005 DPMS clinical strains, four contained multiple LPS types amongst

236

18 strains. Strains belonging to ST-468, ST-807 and ST-734 contained LPS A or LPS B,

237

whilst strains belonging to ST-118 contained LPS A or LPS B2. The LPS and ST discrepancy

238

was also observed in the Top End environmental strain cohort, with three strains

239

belonging to ST-1485 containing LPS A or B.

240
241

The geographical footprint of bimABm in environmental isolates is similar to LPS B.

242

BLAST analysis demonstrated that bimABp was the dominant BimA variant in Top End

243

environmental samples (94.8%), similar to the bimABp prevalence in clinical isolates from

244

a previous study, whereby 95.7% of clinical isolates from Darwin and surrounds

245

possessed bimABp (10). Bivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the proportion of

246

LPS B strains carrying bimABm (n = 8, 21%) is higher compared to LPS A (n = 8, 2.6%) and

247

this was significant (P<0.001). We next determined if bimABp or bimABm has a similar

248

geographical footprint to LPS A or LPS B in the Top End. (10). Geographical mapping of

249

the bimA variants in the environmental strains demonstrated that bimABp was linked with

250

Darwin and surrounds (Fig 3B), having a similar geographical footprint as LPS A. In

251

contrast, bimABm was associated with the East Arnhem and the Katherine and Katherine

Phylogenomics revealed that LPS B2 is geographically restricted within the Top End. A

267

phylogenomic analysis was performed to investigate the distribution of LPS types and

268

strain relatedness on the whole-genome level (Fig 4). Overall, good clade structure based

269

on geographical origin was observed, with strains belonging to the same ST clustering

270

together and within the same LPS type, but with LPS A and B being dispersed throughout

271

the phylogeny (Fig 4). However, this analysis revealed that 5/6 LPS B2 genomes of Top

272

End origin clustered together, suggesting that LPS B2 is geographically restricted in the

273

NT (Fig 4). Similarly, the LPS B2 strains with a Queensland, Australian origin grouped

274

closely together.

275
276

The B. pseudomallei LPS discrepancy in five MLST STs can be explained by ST

277

homoplasy (isolates with the same ST that are genetically distinct). The strong link

278

between LPS type, geography and ST suggested that homoplasy may be present in the 18

279

clinical strains and three environmental strains that belonged to the five STs with more

280

than one LPS type (Table 2). Based on comparative analysis of 175 genomes, isolates with

281

the same ST but mixed LPS type did not group together (Fig 4: “ST homoplasy cases”) and

282

were separated by a large number of SNPs. This is comparable to previously observed

283

MLST homoplasy in B. pseudomallei (20, 21). To assess the effect of recombination on

284

phylogenetic inference, SNP density filtering was applied to remove recombinogenic

285

SNPs with Gubbins (v.2.3.1), which did not considerably alter the topology of the

286

phylogenetic tree (data not shown). We also noted that the isolates belonging to ST-807

287

and ST-468 were from three Top End geographical regions and varied by a large number

288

of SNPs with the largest SNP difference being ~36,000 and ~29,000 respectively (Table 2).

This phenomenon represents further examples of intracontinental homoplasy but

includes homoplasy occurring in more closely related geographical regions than

previously described (20).

Discussion

310

Zoonotic and person-to-person transmission of B. pseudomallei is extremely rare,

311

with almost every case of melioidosis therefore reflecting a single infecting exposure

312

event from the environment in a specific geographical location. Variably present

313

genetic markers have been documented in B. pseudomallei and include the mutually

314

exclusive BimA variants (28), the BTFC/YLF gene clusters (9) and the variably present

315

FhaB3 locus (29). The prevalence of these genetic markers varies between Australia

316

and Asia and BTFC/YLF prevalence varies between clinical and environmental strains,

317

and in the case of bimA and fhab3 they have also been linked to clinical variation in

318

disease phenotype (9, 10). The geographical footprint of fhaB3 and bimA variants has

319

been previously determined in the Northern Territory, with bimABm associated with

320

melioidosis in remote communities while bimABp and absence of fhaB3 is associated

321

with melioidosis in the Darwin urban region (10).

322
323

The LPS O-antigen moiety of B. pseudomallei is highly varied with three serotypes

324

described (12). Nevertheless we recently found that previously published in vitro

325

differences in virulence between LPS A and LPS B did not translate to differences in

326

mortality in DPMS patients, supporting the dominant role in human melioidosis of

327

host risk factors in determining disease severity and outcomes (18). It has also been

328

demonstrated that antibodies from the two dominant LPS types, LPS A and B are not

329

cross-reactive due to structural differences of the O-antigen, which has implications

330

for an LPS based vaccine (12). Regional differences in LPS serotype prevalence have

331

been noted in Southeast Asia and Australia with LPS A being the most prevalent,

332

followed by LPS B and with LPS B2 being the rarest in Australian strains and as yet

333

undetected outside Australia (12). Despite the reporting of these regional differences

334

in LPS prevalence, no studies have investigated the geographical footprint of the LPS

335

types in a contiguous melioidosis-endemic region. We used a combination of

336

statistical analysis, WGS and geographical mapping to examine the geographical

337

footprint of the LPS genotypes in the Top End of the Northern Territory.

338
339

Our data confirm that the prevalence of the LPS types in the environmental samples

340

(LPS A = 89%; LPS B = 10% and LPS B2 = 1%) correlates with what we previously

341

observed in a large clinical isolate collection (LPS A = 87%; LPS B = 12% and LPS B2 =

342

1%) (18) and this high LPS A prevalence was also seen in the strains from Western

343

Australia, Queensland and Papua New Guinea. High prevalence of LPS A is reflected in

344

it also being present in many near-neighbour species (30), with the possibility of

345

horizontal gene transfer of LPS A between these related species. LPS A was also

346

distributed throughout the B. pseudomallei phylogeny being present in genetically

347

distinct strains, also supporting horizontal transfer of the entire LPS A loci. Based on

348

our large clinical dataset (n = 999) we found strong geographical clustering of LPS

349

types, with the highest odds of having a clinical isolate with LPS B being in the East

350

Arnhem region in comparison to the Darwin region (OR 19.5, 95% CI 9.1 – 42.0;

351

p<0.001. A similar trend was observed for strains isolated from the Northern Territory

352

environment (n = 340), and in the environmental strains LPS B was not detected in

353

urban Darwin at all. We also found that LPS A was associated with STs that are highly

354

prevalent in Darwin and surrounds (ST-109, ST-36 p<0.001 and ST-132). These results

355

demonstrate that at least within the Top End context the LPS genotypes can be used

356

as geographical indicators alongside fhaB3 and the bimA variants.

357
358

Despite the strong link noted between ST and LPS type, we detected an LPS

359

discrepancy in 21 isolates belonging to five rare STs: ST-118 (n = 3), ST-734 (n = 10), ST-

360

468 (n = 5), ST-807 (n = 3) and ST-1485 (n = 3). Phylogenomic analysis of 175 genomes

361

confirmed that the isolates belonging to the five STs represented five new ST

362

homoplasy occurrences, explaining the LPS discrepancy noted in the five STs. Isolates

363

of each ST were separated by a large number of SNPs (~29,000-~39,000), which is

364

characteristic of Australian isolates that belong to different STs (20, 21). Despite the

365

large number of SNPs separating isolates within each ST, they all still resided within

366

the Australian clade, representing five novel intracontinental ST homoplasy cases.

367

These findings further highlight the low resolution of MLST and the need for high

368

resolution techniques such as WGS to resolve unexpected genotyping results,

369

particularly for B. pseudomallei which is a highly recombinogenic pathogen (31).

370
371

Lastly, we examined the geographical footprint of the bimA variants using

372

corresponding environmental strain data. Firstly, we revealed a similar geographical

373

trend for the bimA variants to that previously observed in clinical strains (10). Using

374

coordinates from the same environmental strains used for the LPS work we revealed

375

that the rare bimA variant, bimABm, has a similar geographical footprint to LPS B, being

376

associated with the Katherine and East Arnhem regions and the geographical footprint

377

of the dominant bimA variant, bimABp, is similar to LPS A being associated with Darwin

378

and surrounds.

380

An association between bimABm and neurological melioidosis has been described (10).

381

Although we recently demonstrated that LPS type alone did not confer a clinical or

382

mortality differential in human melioidosis, further studies are required to see if the

383

combination of bimABm with LPS B found in eight environmental strains from the

384

Katherine and Katherine remote and East Arnhem regions in this study may have

385

specific clinical implications.

386
387

The present study encompassed a number of limitations. One limitation of this study is

388

that the assigned presumptive location of infection for cases of melioidosis is

389

dependent on good epidemiological history and will sometimes not be the true

390

location of infection. Nevertheless, the close correlation of geographical LPS footprints

391

between the clinical case isolates and the environmental isolates (which are 100%

392

location accurate) is reassuring that the prospective nature of the Darwin melioidosis

393

study is providing accurate epidemiological data. A second limitation is that the four

394

regions (Darwin and surrounding, Darwin remote, Katherine and Katherine remote

395

and East Arnhem) vary substantially in both geographic size and population density,

396

which results in a greater number of isolates obtained from the Darwin and

397

surrounding region and ultimately clustered data. We accounted for the clustered

398

nature of our data by using bivariate logistics regression with the cluster feature.

399
400

In conclusion, by combining genomic data with corresponding strain geographical

401

information we have found that in the tropical north of Australia the LPS types have

402

distinct geographical footprints as well as ST associations, adding to the already known

403

variably present genetic markers fhaB3 and the bimA variants. A novel and interesting

404

finding was that the geographical footprint of LPS B and bimABm are similar and in

405

remote Top End locations. The clinical, sero-diagnostic and vaccine implications of

406

geographically-based B. pseudomallei LPS and other gene differentials and their

407

relationships to regional and global dispersal of melioidosis require global

408

collaborations with further analysis of larger clinically and geospatially-linked datasets.
