Abstract

38

Cell fate decisions such as apoptosis require cells to translate signaling input into a binary

39

yes/no response. A tight control of the process is required to avoid loss of cells by accidental

40

activation of cell death pathways. One particularly critical situation exists in primary oocytes

41

because their finite number determines the reproductive capacity of females. On the one hand

42

a stringent genetic quality control is necessary to maintain the genetic integrity of the entire

43

species; on the other hand an overly stringent mechanism that kills oocytes with even minor

44

DNA damage can deplete the whole primary oocyte pool leading to infertility. The p53 homolog

45

TAp63α is the key regulator of genome integrity in oocytes. After DNA damage TAp63α is

46

activated by multistep phosphorylation involving multiple phosphorylation events by the kinase

47

CK1, which triggers the transition from a dimeric and inactive conformation to an open and

48

active tetramer. By measuring activation kinetics in ovaries and single site phosphorylation

49

kinetics in vitro with peptides and full length protein we show that TAp63α phosphorylation

50

follows a biphasic behavior. While the first two CK1 phosphorylation events are fast, the third

51

one that constitutes the decisive step to form the active conformation is slow. We reveal the

52

structural mechanism for the difference in the kinetic behavior based on an unusual

53

CK1/TAp63α substrate interaction and demonstrate by quantitative simulation that the slow

54

phosphorylation phase determines the threshold of DNA damage required for induction of

55

apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

57

The reproductive lifespan of women is determined by the primordial follicle (PF) reserve. PFs

58

consist of primary oocytes surrounded by a single flat layer of granulosa cells. These oocytes

59

are arrested in prophase I of meiosis I until being recruited for ovulation. Menopause is initiated

60

in humans when the number of PFs decreases from its original level of one to two million at

61

the time of birth to below 10001. Depletion of the PF reserve was identified as the major cause

62

for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). In female patients suffering from cancer, sickle cell

63

anemia or certain autoimmune diseases, treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs and/or

64

irradiation can deplete the ovarian reserve, resulting in POI2,3. Fewer than ten DNA double

65

strand breaks (DSBs) (γ-irradiation with 0.45 Gy) are suffice to eliminate the entire PF reserve

66

in mice4. In humans, the LD50 total body irradiation dosage for the loss of the PF reserve was

67

extrapolated to be less than 2 Gy, while the typical total body irradiation dose for acute

68

leukemia patients is 12 Gy5,6. The loss of the PF reserve also causes the breakdown of the

69

endocrine function of the ovary resulting in addition to infertility in health impairments like

70

osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and psychosocial disorders in addition to infertility7. In

71

contrast to the arrested PFs, growing follicles are unaffected from low dosage of irradiation.

72

The decisive difference between both oocyte types is the expression of TAp63α, a p53

73

orthologue, in PFs4,8. The expression of TAp63α starts shortly after the pachytene stage of

74

meiosis I while oocytes that have reentered the cell cycle are devoid of TAp63α4.

75

The high levels of the pro-apoptotic factor TAp63α combined with the long arrest time of

76

oocytes (up to 50 years in humans) require a very tight regulation of TAp63α’s activity to avoid

77

cell death of uncompromised oocytes. In contrast to all other members of the p53 family that

78

form tetramers through an oligomerization domain, TAp63α adopts a closed, inactive and only

79

dimeric conformation9. DNA damage triggers a kinase cascade resulting in the phosphorylation

80

of TAp63α, which disrupts the autoinhibitory dimeric complex and triggers the formation of an

81

open active and tetrameric conformation resulting in the elimination of the damaged oocyte 10.

82

Recently, we and others have identified the kinases involved in this process, mapped the

83

phosphorylation sites and described the structural mechanism of the activation process. The

84

first step of the kinase cascade is the activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) or checkpoint

85

kinase 1 (CHK1) by ataxia telangiectasia mutant kinase (ATM)11. Activated CHK2

86

phosphorylates TAp63α on S58212 which renders TAp63α a substrate for casein kinase 1

87

(CK1)13. CK1 requires pre-phosphorylated substrates with the consensus sequence pS/T-x-x-

88

S/T, where pS/T is a phosphorylated serine or threonine. In TAp63α CK1 adds four phosphate

89

groups that lead to the disruption of the autoinhibitory complex through electrostatic

90

repulsion13. Our previous experiments have shown that the inhibited dimeric state of TAp63α

91

constitutes a kinetically trapped high energy state14. Consequently, activation follows a spring-

92

loaded mechanism that explains the high sensitivity of oocytes towards DNA damage. This

93

activation mechanism has to be adjusted to a certain level of damage that on the one hand

94

must be sufficiently low to protect the integrity of the genetic pool of a species but on the other

95

hand tolerant enough not to endanger reproductive capacity. This situation requires a

96

mechanism that ideally works similar to a doorbell: an input signal (mechanical pressure) below

97

a certain threshold has no effect. If, however, this threshold is surpassed the output signal is

98

independent of the actual input signal strength (pressing harder does not make the doorbell

99

louder). Indeed, a tight dose-response curve has been measured in four-day old mice: while

100

most oocytes survive irradiation with 0.1 Gy (~three DSBs per cell), virtually all primary oocytes

101

were eliminated by 0.45 Gy irradiation (~ten DSBs per cell) 4.

102

Switch-like processes are often based on the integration of two different and independent

103

signals. An accidental activation is thus suppressed as the likelihood of activation is the product

104

of two small probabilities. Examples include regulation of actin polymerization via N-WASP

105

which requires co-stimulation by Cdc42 and PIP215 as well as activation of T-cells via triggering

106

nuclear import of NFAT and activation of the transcription factor AP1 16. The activation of

107

TAp63α is based on phosphorylation by two kinases which in principle could provide such a

108

sigmoidal activation. However, both act in a sequentially dependent manner and CK1 kinases

109

are thought to be constitutively active17. These properties would prevent a switch-like activation

110

and make the initiation of apoptosis dependent only on CHK2 with potentially detrimental

111

consequences for the safety of oocytes. To understand how TAp63α converts a graded stress

112

response into a doorbell like activation mechanism we investigated the kinetics of apoptosis in

113

primary oocytes both at the cellular and molecular level.

RESULTS

115

DNA damage induced apoptosis in primordial follicles follows a sigmoidal time

116

response

117

We set out to measure the time dependent TAp63α activation in whole mouse ovaries following

118

DNA damage as a response to γ-irradiation (0.5 Gy) as a direct source of DSB induction. The

119

tetramerization kinetics of TAp63α upon γ-irradiation followed a sigmoidal time response with

120

virtually all TAp63α converted into its active tetrameric state within two hours (Fig. 1a, 1b and

121

Supplementary Fig. 1a). Activation can be suppressed using selective inhibitors of ATM, CHK2

122

and CK1, suggesting that tetramerization is based on the same pathway as activation following

123

the treatment with cisplatin or doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. 1a)13,14,18. In order to investigate

124

the time dependent induction of apoptosis, we measured the ratio of germ cell nuclear acidic

125

peptidase (GCNA)19 positive and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 (PARP1) double

126

positive cells in whole mouse ovaries using our 3D staining and light sheet-based fluorescence

127

microscopy combined with semi-automated segmentation method (Fig. 1c and Supplementary

128

Fig. 1b)13. The primary oocyte specific GCNA10 staining allows the specific quantification of

129

apoptosis markers in primary oocytes. Cleaved PARP1 was detected starting from four hours

130

after irradiation and reached 100% in the remaining PFs at ten hours showing a sigmoidal

131

overall transition (Fig. 1d). A sigmoidal transition was also evident when monitoring the decline

132

of the integrated GCNA signal in whole ovaries representing the total number of remaining

133

primary oocytes (Fig. 1e).

134
135

Phosphorylation of the third CK1 site is the slowest and the ‘point of no return’

136

The correlation between the sigmoidal time response patterns for TAp63α tetramerization and

137

induction of apoptosis suggests that the molecular activation mechanism of TAp63α is the

138

decisive process controlling the fate of the oocyte. Earlier, we have shown that the initial

139

phosphorylation of S582 by CHK2 is necessary but does not result in active TAp63α. This

140

phosphorylation serves as the priming event for recruiting CK1 which adds phosphate groups

141

at four consecutive sites: S585, S588, S591 and T59413. We also have characterized the

142

importance of each phosphate group for the activation mechanism by mutating the individual

143

residues that can be phosphorylated to alanine and measuring the tetramerization kinetics

144

following addition of CK1. Demonstrating that the last phosphorylation event, T594, is

145

dispensable for TAp63α activation. However, mutating S591 abrogates the conversion of

146

TAp63α to a tetramer, showing that phosphorylation of S591 is ‘the point of no return’ for

147

TAp63α activation13. This observation raised the question how phosphorylation of the three

148

CK1 sites, S585, S588 and S591 can provide a switch-like activation mechanism. Detailed

149

theoretical and experimental studies have shown that multisite phosphorylation can lead to

150

ultrasensitivity20-22. This is achieved either by having strongly differing kinetic constants for the

151

individual reaction steps or if the process is distributive 23. In addition, a distributive mode of

152

action would allow the interference of a phosphatase while a processive mode of action would

153

result in a continuous and undisturbed phosphorylation of all sites. To investigate the mode of

154

action we analyzed the kinetics of phosphorylation of the individual sites within a peptide, that

155

corresponds to the sequence N-terminal to the transactivation inhibitory domain (TID)24 and

156

includes the phosphorylation sites for CHK2 and CK1 (hereafter referred to as phosphorylation

157

activation

158

Phosphorylation of S582 by MapKap kinase 2 (MK2) which recognizes the same

159

phosphorylation sequence as CHK2 resulted in the appearance of a new resonance in the

160

HSQC spectrum and loss of the original S582 signal, consistent with the peptide being

161

phosphorylated on this serine residue (Supplementary Fig. 2a). MK2 can be easily produced

162

in bacteria, is constitutively active and therefore a convenient surrogate for CHK2 in vitro

163

priming of substrates.

164

Recording the phosphorylation kinetics of this pre-phosphorylated peptide by CK1δ showed a

165

biphasic behavior. Phosphorylation of S585 and S588 occurred very quickly with an almost

166

indistinguishable kinetics, which corresponds to either a processive mode or to a distributive

167

mode with a very fast product releasing and substrate re-binding kinetics. A stark contrast was

168

observed for the subsequent phosphorylation of S591 with a ~40–fold slower rate (Fig. 2a, 2B

169

and Supplementary Table 1). The observed increase in the concentration of the triple

170

phosphorylated peptide (pS582, pS585, pS588; PAD-3P) beyond the concentration of the

171

kinase implies that CK1 must have dissociated from the PAD-3P product peptide to

172

phosphorylate S585 and S588 in free PAD-1P and PAD-2P peptides. Only when the supply of

173

pS582 mono-phosphorylated peptide is exhausted, S591 and T594 become substrates for

174

CK1. We conclude from these observations that 1) phosphorylation of the entire stretch occurs

175

via a distributive mode and that 2) S585 and S588 act as a buffer that delays phosphorylation

176

of the downstream sites S591 and T594. In the same time frame as the phosphorylation of

177

S591 and T594 a non-consensus sequence phosphorylation of T586 appears. The T586A

178

mutant showed no difference in the phosphorylation kinetics demonstrating that

179

phosphorylation of T586 is not the reason for the biphasic behavior (Supplementary Fig. 2h).

180

Interestingly, phosphorylation of S591 is the point of no return for the activation and the kinetic

181

experiment demonstrate that this critical phosphorylation is the slow step occurring in a

distributive mode of action.

183

The phosphorylation kinetics in the full-length protein mirrors the kinetics of the

184

isolated peptides

185

Phosphorylation kinetics of the isolated PAD peptide might, however, be quite different from

186

the kinetics of the corresponding peptide within the closed dimeric full-length TAp63α

187

conformation since the sequence is surrounded by secondary structure elements and folded

188

domains (Fig. 2c). We measured the phosphorylation kinetics with

189

dimeric TAp63α. To be able to analyze the phosphorylation kinetics by NMR we stopped the

190

reaction by adding a high concentration of EDTA and CK1 inhibitor PF-670462. Subsequently,

191

we isolated the PAD peptide first by cleaving with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and after

192

isolating the resulting C-terminal fragment the PAD was cleaved from the TID using CNBr. For

193

this purpose, a protease cleavage site was engineered N-terminal to the PAD and a V599M

194

mutation at its C-terminal end (Supplementary Fig. 2b-g). The phosphorylation kinetics of the

195

PAD peptide and the PAD derived from the dimeric TAp63α showed a similar pattern. S585

196

and S588 were phosphorylated fast, while phosphorylation of S591 and T594 were significantly

197

slower (at least 25-fold) following a distributive mechanism (Fig. 2d and 2e). This demonstrated

198

that the biphasic activation mode also occurs in the full-length dimeric TAp63α and is not a

199

peptide derived artefact.

15

N-labeled full-length

200
201

The biphasic kinetics is p63 sequence specific

202

The observed biphasic behavior could be a property of the p63 sequence, of CK1 substrate

203

recognition or a mixture of both properties. Kinases of the CK1 family recognize several

204

hundred confirmed or suggested substrates. Among them are the period proteins (PER1-3),

205

β-catenin, NF-AT1,2,4, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), p53, MDM2 and Yes-associated

206

protein 1 (YAP1)17. Some of these targets contain stretches of phosphorylatable residues

207

harboring the CK1 consensus target sequence and these sequences are known to get

208

phosphorylated at multiple sites (Fig. 3a). To investigate if CK1δ can in principle add more

209

than two phosphate groups in a processive manner we chose YAP1 which contains a

210

phosphodegron sequence that regulates its cellular localization and degradation. YAP1 is

211

pre-phosphorylated by LATS kinase at S397, within the HxRxxS consensus motif. CK1 gets

212

recruited to phosphorylated YAP1 and adds three more phosphate groups in the sequence

213

HSRDESTDSGLSMSSYS25. We used a modified, MK2 phosphorylatable peptide and

214

measured the NMR-based kinetics of the three CK1 phosphorylation events after MK2 priming

215

(Fig. 3b, 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3a and 3b). In a stark contrast to the PAD peptide, the results

216

demonstrated fast kinetics for all three CK1 sites, suggesting that CK1 phosphorylates the

217

sequence in YAP1, and possibly other proteins, without a distinct biphasic mechanism (Fig.

218

3d, 3e and Supplementary Table 1).

219

The CK1 p63 PAD complex structure reveals the basis for the biphasic activation

220

kinetics

221

This result suggested that the p63 PAD sequence is responsible for the observed biphasic

222

kinetics and we hypothesized that the residues C-terminal to the third CK1 phosphorylation

223

site (S591) might be crucial. We exchanged the sequence following the third CK1 site S591

224

(S592 and E593) with the sequence directly C-terminal to the second CK1 phosphorylation

225

site S588 (V589 and G590). Interestingly, phosphorylation of S591 and T594 in this double

226

mutant was indeed ten-fold accelerated in comparison to wild type. A faster phosphorylation

227

kinetics was evident also in both single S592V and E593A mutants with a notably more

228

pronounced effect observed for the S592V mutation (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3c, 3d and

229

Supplementary Table 1).

230

To obtain a mechanistic insight of the kinase–peptide interactions that are responsible for the

231

delayed kinetics, we determined the crystal structures of the kinase domain of CK1δ in

232

complexes with AMPPCP/ADP and various PAD peptides harboring different phosphorylation

233

states, including PAD-1P (the first substrate with primed phosphorylation at pS582), PAD-2P

234

(pS582 and pS585) and PAD-3P (pS582, pS585 and pS588) (Supplementary Fig. 4a-f). The

235

overall conformations of all bound peptides were highly similar, yet they captured different

236

states, including the substrate-bound form in PAD-1P and PAD-2P having the S585 and S588,

237

respectively, located at the catalytic site. In contrast to PAD-1P/2P the PAD-3P crystalized in

238

a product-PAD-3P complex in which pS588 was positioned within the catalytic site (Fig. 4a, 4b

239

and 4d). Structural analyses of the CK1δ-PAD-2P complex as an example of the

240

substrate-bound state revealed that the interactions between the kinase and the peptide were

241

induced by electrostatic charge complementarity of both anchor-ends on the N- and C-termini

242

of the peptide (Fig. 4c).

243

The peptide N-terminal part adopted a helical turn positioning the phosphate groups of pS582

244

and pS585 into the basic pocket of the kinase formed by Arg178 and Lys224 (for clear

245

referencing, the single amino acid letter code is used for the PAD peptide and the three-letter

246

code for the CK1δ kinase), while the PAD C-terminal E593 residue interacted with a second

247

basic cluster present in the CK1δ substrate binding groove. This second cluster was formed

248

by the N-terminus of the activation segment of the kinase. Furthermore, a potential hydrogen

249

bond between the PAD S592 and the backbone carbonyl of CK1δ Ala153 was formed. The

250

middle stretch of the PAD central to S588 at the catalytic site, displayed a canonical

251

kinase-substrate interaction (Fig. 4c and 4d). Close inspection of the region surrounding the

252

catalytic site revealed a non-polar patch on the kinase that was compatible with a

253

medium-sized hydrophobic substrate residue such as V589 of the PAD peptide, which was

254

tucked within a groove fenced on one side by the αG of the kinase. This explains the preference

255

for hydrophobic amino acids in CK substrates at the +1-position relative to the serine/threonine

256

phosphorylation site (Fig. 4c and 4d). In comparison, the binding mode of the PAD-3P in a

257

product bound state highly resembles that of the substrate PAD-2P, albeit with the positioning

258

of pS588 at the catalytic site with its phosphate moiety adjacent to the DFG Asp149 and the

259

HRD Asp128 facilitated by an unusually bent ADP conformation (Fig. 4c and 4d). These

260

structural insights from both substrate- and product-bound states suggested that such

261

accommodation of the PAD peptides with S588/pS588 at the catalytic sites likely offered an

262

optimal binding mode within the kinase, presenting the charge compatibility not only at N- and

263

C-terminal anchor-points but also the non-polar groove for the middle part.

264

Processivity towards the next phosphorylation event on S591 requires the movement of the

265

triple phosphorylated peptide by a translocation of S592 and E593 away from their favorable

266

binding polar/charged pocket to the unfavorable hydrophobic environment, explaining the

267

accelerated kinetics of the mutants (Fig. 3e). To further investigate this model, we measured

268

the phosphorylation kinetics for the V589A mutant which replaces a large hydrophobic residue

269

with a smaller one. This mutation indeed slowed phosphorylation of the second

270

phosphorylation site ~three-fold probably by weakening the interaction with the small

271

hydrophobic surface in the CK binding site. At the same time, the mutant V589A also

272

accelerated phosphorylation of S591 approximately threefold (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3c,

273

3d and Supplementary Table 1). Replacing the medium sized hydrophobic valine residue with

274

a smaller alanine probably weakened the interaction in this +1-substrate position, resulting in

275

both suboptimal positioning and locking of the substrate and a smaller hurdle for the release

276

of the product.

277

We further investigated the interaction between the kinase and the PAD peptide by all-atom

278

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In 1 µs long simulations with bound PAD, the side chain

279

of E593 of the PAD peptide formed strong and persistent salt-bridge interactions with a basic

280

cluster on CK1 formed by Arg127, Lys154 and Lys171 (Fig. 5a, 5b, Supplementary Fig. 5a and

281

5b). By stabilizing the crystallographic position of the peptide, these interactions contribute to

282

the slow phosphorylation rate of S591. This finding is consistent with a mutational analysis of

283

the PAD peptide showing a ~two-fold acceleration for the E593A mutant (Fig. 3e,

284

Supplementary Fig. 3c, 3d and Supplementary Table 1). Mutating the residues of the basic

285

cluster on CK1 individually to glutamate and measuring the phosphorylation kinetics revealed

286

that mutation of Lys154 and Lys171 resulted in a 1.5-fold faster kinetics of the third and fourth

287

CK1 phosphorylation reactions (Supplementary Fig. 5c and 5d). These results confirmed the

288

contribution of the interaction between E593 and the kinase to the slow phosphorylation rate

289

of S591.

290

MD simulations also highlighted the stabilizing interactions of V589 on the PAD peptide with

291

CK1. We compared two 1 µs long simulations of the WT and V589A PAD peptide. The V589A

mutation weakened the interactions with a hydrophobic patch on CK1 and increased the

293

flexibility of the peptide in this region (Fig. 5c and 5d). This finding is consistent with our

294

mutational analysis, which showed that a large hydrophobic residue in the i+1-position retains

295

the peptide and thereby slows down phosphorylation at the third CK1 site (Fig. 3e).

296

The presence of PAD-1P, PAD-2P and PAD-3P in the crystal structures suggests that all PAD

297

peptides must have high binding affinities for CK1δ. However, we hypothesized that they may

298

not exhibit the same binding and/or substrate potencies. To investigate this hypothesis, we

299

measured kcat, Km and Vmax values for the phosphorylation reaction starting with single, double

300

or triple phosphorylated peptides by measuring ATP consumption. Since the experiment was

301

conducted with the wild type peptide sequence and not serine to alanine mutants the obtained

302

values represent average values for all remaining phosphorylation events. These

303

measurements clearly demonstrate that the affinity of the peptides increases and the reaction

304

velocity decreases with increasing phosphorylation level (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

305
306

The phosphorylation kinetics of the third CK1 site sets the threshold level for activation

307

and oocyte death

308

Beyond the mechanistic description of the activation process, the question of the biological

309

purpose of the observed kinetics remains. Analysis of the phosphorylation kinetics both of the

310

isolated peptide as well as the full-length protein showed that phosphorylation of the third CK1

311

site starts only after the first two sites are completely phosphorylated (Fig. 2b and 2e). The first

312

two sites act as a buffer creating a preloaded state and the third one acts as the trigger.

313

Delaying the irreversible spring-loaded activation might allow the cell to survive in case the

314

DNA damage does not surpass a certain threshold. This could be achieved by phosphatases

315

that act during the delay period and remove the phosphorylation sites that constitute the buffer.

316

One additional safety mechanism to control the fate of the oocyte is the degradation of

317

activated TAp63α. Analysis of the total TAp63α concentration in oocytes has revealed that it

318

decreases following the activation to the active tetrameric state 4,9. A fast degradation in

319

combination with a slow activation could also prevent apoptosis in case the DNA damage level

320

is minor. To investigate the potential effects of dephosphorylation, degradation and delay of

321

activation we simulated the entire process mathematically according to the kinetic model

322

shown in Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 6a and 6b. For simplicity, we used only one kinetic

323

constant, k1, to describe the phosphorylation by CHK2 and the first two CK1 phosphorylation

324

events. The kinetic constants k2 and k4 describe the dephosphorylation and degradation

325

processes while k3 represents the critical third CK1 phosphorylation event that converts the

326

inactive, dimeric protein [B] into the open, active conformation [C]. We solved the indicated

327

system of coupled differential equations by numerical integration for different values of the

328

kinetic constants. In our in vitro phosphorylation experiments the value of k 1 was constant

329

depending only on the concentration of CK1. However, in vivo, k1 will change with time as it

330

depends for example on the amount of DNA damage, the activation kinetics of CHK2 as well

331

as DNA repair processes. To better address this situation, we used different time-shifted

332

curves as a description of the time dependence of the k1 value (Supplementary Fig. 6c, 6e and

333

6g). This resulted in a shift in the time response curve of [C], reflecting the experimental data

334

of p63 tetramerization in oocytes but had otherwise little effect on [C] (Supplementary Fig. 6d,

335

6f and 6h). Changing the value for k2 also showed relatively little effect on the formation of the

336

activated tetramer [C] (Fig. 6b). In contrast, k4 has a strong effect with high values keeping the

337

concentration of activated tetramer low (Fig. 6c).

338

These simulations predict that phosphatases probably play a less important role than E3

339

ligases in regulating of TAp63α mediated oocytes death. To address the decisive question of

340

the influence of the k3 kinetic constant we selected values for k4 based on the observed decay

341

of the tetrameric p63 level in oocytes following irradiation (k4=0.008 min-1; Supplementary Fig.

342

1a) and calculated the time course of the concentration of activated tetramer for low and high

343

values of k3. These calculations show a strong influence of the level of [C] on the value of k3

344

(Fig. 6d). With k3 values approaching k1, meaning that no lag phase in phosphorylation exists,

345

a fast rise of [C] to high concentrations results. Slower k3 values dampen the response of the

346

system and delay it, enabling the degradation process to effectively remove activated tetramer.

347

To better characterize the effect of the phosphorylation lag phase we calculated the time

348

response curve for [C] in dependence of varying the maximal value of k1. This calculation

349

mimics an almost instant and persistent level of DNA damage as seen following γ-irradiation.

350

Low k1 values represent low DNA damage while large k 1 values represent strong DNA damage.

351

The result is a three-dimensional plot with time and k1 values as x and y axis and the level of

352

[C] on the z axis. Fig. 6e shows a two-dimensional representation with contour lines for the

353

value of [C]. Fig. 6f shows the same calculation only with k 3 set to a higher level equal to the

354

maximal value of k1. Setting a [C]-value of 0.5 arbitrarily as the level that has to be reached to

355

induce apoptosis demonstrates that this ‘zone of death’ is smaller for the calculations with the

356

slow k3 value. Our simulation results suggest that the delayed phosphorylation of S591 sets

357

the threshold for the DNA damage level that is necessary to induce apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

359

Cell division and cell death require yes/no answers without the possibility for an intermediate

360

response. Consequently, cells have evolved molecular systems that translate ‘analog’ input

361

signals into a ‘digital’ output signal. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown

362

different ways how cells build switch-like systems, often using multisite phosphorylation events

363

as a signal integrator of the activity of two or more kinases. Although activation of TAp63α

364

requires two different kinases, this integrator model does not seem to be the mode of

365

activation, because CK1 kinases are thought to be constitutively active but sequentially

366

dependent on a priming kinase such as CHK2. In this situation, activation of TAp63α would

367

only depend on the activation of CHK2. This model, however, is only valid if CK1 used a strictly

368

processive mode of phosphorylation with all individual kinetic constants in the same range.

369

Our results show, that both conditions are not true and that CK1 uses a distributive mode of

370

phosphorylation in combination with very different kinetic constants to regulate TAp63α’s

371

activation. Importantly, it is the third phosphorylation event that is the slowest and that

372

constitutes the decisive phosphorylation for the formation of the open, tetrameric state. The

373

transition to the open tetrameric state is irreversible and all phosphate groups can be removed

374

in this state without affecting its oligomerization status9. Phosphorylation of the third CK1 site,

375

therefore, constitutes the ‘point of no return’. Mechanistically the slow kinetics seems to be the

376

result of three effects. 1) S592 and E593 interact with a basic / polar cluster of the kinase and

377

probably keep the peptide in the position as seen in the crystal structures. 2) Hydrophobic

378

residues such as valine are preferred in the +1-position relative to the phosphorylation site due

379

to the presence of a small hydrophobic patch next to the active site. Shifting S592 into this

380

position would not allow a stable interaction. 3) The triple phosphorylated peptide (pS582,

381

pS585, pS588) has a relatively high affinity to the kinase in a product type state. The crystal

382

structure of the triple phosphorylated peptide with the phosphorylated S588 still pointing into

383

the active site suggested product inhibition might play a role in slowing down phosphorylation

384

of S591. This interpretation is supported by a study showing that temperature compensation

385

of the circadian clock of which CK1 is a central component is at least partially based on a shift

386

from high substrate affinity to higher product affinity of the kinase 26, showing that product

387

inhibition is an important aspect of regulation of CK1 activity.

388

Sequence alignments of the p63 PAD peptides revealed that not only the phosphorylation sites

389

are highly conserved from fish to mammals13 but also the valine-glycine sequence following

390

the second CK1 site and the serine – glutamate sequence C-terminal to the third site,

391

suggesting that activation of TAp63α follows a universal, evolutionary conserved mechanism

392

with similar activation kinetics in all these species.

393

An important question of multisite phosphorylation events is whether kinases use a processive

394

or distributive mechanism. Examples exist for both types as well as a combination of both. Src

395

kinase and SRPK1 have been shown to modify up to fifteen tyrosine and eight serine residues

396

in a processive manner, respectively27,28 while the dual specificity kinase MEK uses a fully

397

distributive mechanism 23. One example for a combined mechanism is the yeast

398

cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85 that modifies five residues in the transcription factor Pho4

399

using both modes29. Our experiments have demonstrated that CK1 uses most likely a

400

distributive mechanism of phosphorylation. The first two phosphorylation events are too fast to

401

analyze in detail but more likely represent a distributive mechanism in combination with a fast

402

rebinding. The third site, however, follows definitely a distributive and not a processive mode.

403

Effectively, the first two CK1 phosphorylation sites act as a buffer that gets filled with a relatively

404

fast kinetics. Only when these two sites are phosphorylated do the third (and fourth) sites

405

become modified, resulting in a sigmoidal time response curve. Importantly, the general

406

behavior of the individual phosphorylation events is not restricted to the relatively artificial

407

phosphorylation of isolated peptides but can also be seen in the kinetic analysis of the same

408

sequence within the full-length TAp63α protein. Originally, we conducted these experiments

409

with the full-length protein because we wanted to investigate potential steric hindrance effects.

410

Surprisingly, phosphorylation of the third CK1 site is not slower, but faster within the full-length

411

protein. This result might be a consequence of the dimeric state of TAp63α, presenting two

412

binding sites for CK1 per molecule (in addition to potentially many other non-specific interaction

413

sites) that might keep the kinase in close proximity to TAp63α, increasing the local

414

concentration and in the end accelerating phosphorylation.

415

The model that we use to simulate the effect of the kinetic constants is of course simplified.

416

Activated TAp63α will initiate transcription of many other genes including p63 itself and

417

probably E3 ligases which will influence the cellular concentration and localization. Despite

418

these simplifications our results show that the difference in phosphorylation kinetics sets the

419

threshold for p63 activation using a ‘doorbell like’ mechanism. This threshold level has been

420

established during evolution to suppress oocyte loss due to random activation of TAp63α or

421

low levels of DNA damage caused for example by background radioactivity or normal levels of

422

reactive oxygen species in oocytes. Our model predicts that mutations in the PAD sequence

423

of TAp63α can change this threshold level. A single nucleotide exchange within the codon of

424

S592, AGT, to ATT would mutate this serine to an isoleucine, which would change the

425

phosphorylation kinetics and, therefore, the threshold, leading to TAp63α activation at lower

426

damage levels. Two recent screens have shown, that mutations in TAp63α can lead to POI. In

427

both screens large rearrangements in the domain structure have created activated p63

428

forms30,31. A S592I mutation would have much milder effects but could also contribute to a

429

premature depletion of the primary oocyte reserve.

MATERIALS & METHODS

458

Ovary Culture

459

Animal care and handling were performed according to the guidelines set by the World Health

460

Organization (Geneva, Switzerland). Eight-day-old (P8) female CD-1 mice were purchased

461

from Charles River Laboratories. Ovaries were harvested, transferred to sterile 96-well plates

462

with 50 µl α-MEM (+L-Glu, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1x penicillin/

463

streptomycin (Gibco), 0.2 mg/ml Na-pyruvate (Gibco), 2 mg/ml N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Sigma) and

464

ITS liquid media supplement (100x) (Sigma) cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 overnight32. The

465

final concentrations of the kinase inhibitors targeting ATM (KU55399, Selleckchem), CHK2

466

(BML-277, Merck) and CK1 (PF 670462, Sigma Aldrich) were 25 µM. Ex vivo ovaries were

467

γ-irradiated with 0.50 Gy on a rotating turntable in a

468

2.387 Gy/min. The protocol for harvesting mouse ovaries was approved by the

469

Tierschutzbeauftragte of the Goethe University Frankfurt/Main.

Western blotting and blue native PAGE

472

Western blotting and blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) were performed as described

473

previously13,33. The following antibodies were used for detection: anti-p63α (D2K8K XP, Cell

479

Cultured ovaries were treated as indicated and the staining was performed as described in

480

Tuppi et al.13. In brief, the ovaries were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in

481

PBS overnight at 4°C. The ovaries were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30

482

minutes at room temperature. All further steps were performed in a 96-well flat bottom plate

483

(Greiner) shaking at 450rpm. The ovaries were blocked for two hours using Blocking Buffer

484

(0.3% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA (heat shock fraction, Sigma) and 10%

485

486

incubator with the first antibody, an anti-Germ cell-specific antigen (GCNA1) (ab82527,

487

493

and kept at 4°C in PBS. The ovaries were cleared by washing them four times in CUBIC 2 34

494

(50% w/v Sucrose, 25% w/v Urea,10% w/v 2,2‘,2‘’-nitrilotriethanol) with a refraction index of

495

1.49 and overnight incubation in CUBIC 2 inside a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) foil

496

capillary (Patent: US 20150211981 A1). The capillaries were mounted on stainless steel

497

holders and images were acquired with a custom-built monolithic digital-scanned light sheet-

498

based fluorescence microscope (mDSLM)35. The microscope was equipped with an

499

Epiplan-Neofluar 2.5x/0.06 illumination objective and a N-Achroplan 10x/0.3 detection

500

objective (Carl Zeiss) and a Clara camera (ANDOR technology, Ireland). Z-spacing of 2.58

501

µm. Laser and filter set: 488 nm laser, 525/50 bandpass filter. All raw image stacks were pre-

502

processed in FIJI (ImageJ version 1.51d, Java version 1.6.0_24). Specifically, the raw image

503

stacks were cropped to the region of interest and scaled by a factor of two. To obtain a

504

homogeneous intensity distribution in the individual images of the z-stacks, the stacks were

505

resliced by a factor of four. The background intensity was subtracted using the FIJI function

506

Subtract Background with a ball radius of 50 pixels and the contrast was enhanced applying

507

the FIJI function Enhance Contrast (saturation=0.35). GCNA and c-PARP positive cells were

508

segmented with the FIJI function 3D Object Counter. Objects with a size of min.=750 and

509

max.=222218880 voxels and an intensity threshold of 1,000 were segmented. The total

510

amount of c-PARP and GCNA positive cells per ovary were extracted and the ratio of

511

GCNA/c-PARP per ovary was calculated. Three replicates per time point were analyzed.

514

Human TAp63α (aa10-616, TEV site inserted at aa570 and V599M) codon-optimized for

515

expression in E. coli was subcloned into the pET16b vector. The protein, bearing a C-terminal

517

minimal Media, containing 1 g/l

518

supplemented with 100 µM ZnCl2 to ensure correct folding of the zinc finger containing DNA

binding domain. Cells were lysed in IMAC buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM

520

β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 µM ZnCl2) and purified using a standard step gradient

521

(300 mM imidazol) immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) protocol (Ni-Sepharose

522

Fast Flow, GE Healthcare). Afterwards, the protein was further purified by size exclusion

524

8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP. Purified TAp63α was incubated for 30 min at

525

30°C with pre-activated MK2Δ1-41, 10 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2. Purification and activation

526

of MK2Δ1-41 was performed as described previously 13. Subsequently, TAp63α was separated

from MK2 by SEC (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg, GE Healthcare). 2.5 mg of the

528

pre-phosphorylated TAp63α (pTAp63α) was then incubated with purified CK1δ (molar ratio

529

1:1000) with 10 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 at 25°C for the indicated time. Purification and

530

activation of CK1δ was performed as described previously13. To stop the reaction PF670462

531

(10 µM final concentration) and EDTA pH 8.0 (12 mM final concentration) were added.

532

Afterwards, MBP-TEV were added in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated overnight at 4°C. The

533

cleavage was stopped by adding solid urea to it to a final concentration of 6 M. The denaturated

534

mixture was concentrated and purified by SEC (Superdex 75, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in

535

50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 6 M Urea. The resulting PAD-TID peptide was acidified with

536

32% HCl to a final concentration of 0.5 M and cleaved by a final concentration of 125 mM CNBr

537

for 48 h at room temperature in the dark. The resulting product was concentrated for 30 min in

538

a SpeedVac. Afterwards, MES pH 6.3 was added to a final concentration of 500 mM to adjust

539

the pH. To remove the TID the reaction was purified by a reverse IMAC, concentrated and

540

buffer exchanged (kinase NMR buffer, see below) by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-0.5 ml, 3 kDa

541

Peptide Expression

544

Peptides were expressed with a protease cleavable N-terminal GFP-His6-tag. Isotopically

545

labeled expression was performed in M9 for 16 h at 22°C under the induction with 500 µM

546

IPTG. Initial purification was done analogous to full-length TAp63α. After IMAC purification, the

547

expression tag and the peptide were split by incubation with 3C protease overnight at 4°C. On

548

the next day the peptide and GFP were subject to concentration via ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra

549

10 kDa MWCO, Merck) and removal of the GFP and 3C protease. The flow through of the filter

550

was subject to another round of concentration over a 3 kDa cutoff filter. Afterwards the peptides

551

were subject to SEC in kinase NMR buffer, see below (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE

Peptides were S582 -phosphorylated with MK2 kinase at 25°C at a molar ratio of 1:100 kinase

556

to peptide and an ATP concentration of 10 mM. Phosphorylation was monitored by recording

557

a series of 2D NMR spectra. MK2 was subsequently removed from the reaction mix by another

558

round of SEC (Superdex 75, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare).

NMR Spectroscopy

561

Samples for NMR experiments employed kinase buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl,

562

10 mM MgCl2). Additionally, all samples contained 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete

563

EDTA free, Roche) and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, Roche). Experiments

were performed at a sample temperature of 298 K. Assignments of PAD mutants at different

565

phosphorylation states were performed using a combinatorial triple-selective labeling

566

approach, as detailed in36 or with the help of a constant-time HNCACB.

567

Phosphorylation kinetics were recorded using sample volumes of 200 µl placed in 3-mm

568

capillaries and final peptide concentrations of 250 µM. The general sample composition of a

569

kinetic sample was as follows:
15

570

N-labeled peptide
to 250 µM
protease inhibitor
1x
phosphatase inhibitor
1x
ATP
to 10 mM
CK1 kinase (3 µM stock)
8.3 µl
buffer
to 200 µl
A series of HSQC-like [15N, 1H] correlation spectra were recorded throughout the kinetic

571

reaction with NMR instruments operating at 1H frequencies ranging from 600 to 950 MHz. To

572

accurately reflect the extremely fast initial phosphorylation reactions of S582 and S585 the

573

total measurement time of each spectrum was limited to a maximum of 120 s. This was

574

achieved by using a gradient-selected BEST-TROSY pulse sequence37 and either by limiting

575

the measurement to one scan per FID or by reducing the interscan delay to 100 ms, depending

576

on the field strength the sample was measured at. Non-uniform sampling was not employed

577

as the large quantity of ATP within the sample leads to non-recoverable t1-noise like artefacts,

578

overlaying the signals.

579

Prior to addition of kinase a reference spectrum was acquired. Kinase was added manually,

580

and a series of spectra were recorded over the time course of ~12 h. Peak intensities of

581

relevant peaks were quantified for every spectrum automatically. The fraction of

582

phosphorylation in a given amino acid was calculated by dividing the relevant peak

583

intensity/intensities by the sum of all peak intensities of a given amino acid.

584

YAP1 phosphorylation kinetics were measured based on

experiments to resolve peak overlap in the [ N, H]-HSQC spectrum. Two-dimensional

586

detected N-CO correlation spectra were obtained using a BEST-(H)NCO pulse sequence

587

essentially as described by Gil et al.38. Nitrogen chemical shifts were acquired in a

588

semi-constant time manner using States-TPPI quadrature detection. Homonuclear

589

decoupling was achieved by the IPAP approach 39. To allow for very short interscan delays

590

without causing sample - and RF coil heating 15N decoupling during acquisition was not applied

591

in the current implementation. Acquisition was immediately started after the 9.4-ms IPAP delay

Crystal structure determination

634

The kinase domain of CK1δ (aa. 1-294) was subcloned into pNIC28-Bsa4, and the

635

recombinant protein containing an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli, cultured in TB

636

and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 18°C overnight. Cells were harvested and lysed by

637

sonication, and the protein was purified by IMAC. The histidine tag was cleaved by TEV

638

protease treatment, and the cleaved protein was purified further by reverse IMAC and SEC.

639

The pure protein in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM TCEP was concentrated to

640

6-8 mg/ml, and was mixed with either ADP or AMPPCP (Sigma) at 2 mM and MgCl2 at 4 mM.

641

Crystallization was performed using sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4°C using the

642

condition containing 10-20% PEG 3350, 0.1-0.2 M sodium sulfate and 0.1 M citrate, pH 4.6-

643

5.9. Viable crystals were soaked with the PAD peptides at 6-10 mM overnight in the mother

644

liquor containing 20% ethylene glycol before flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data

645

were collected at Swiss Light Source, X06SA or DESY, P13, and were processed and scaled

646

with XDS41 and subsequently scaled using aimless42, respectively. The CK1δ structures in

647

complexes with the peptides were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser 43 and the

648

published coordinates of CK1δ

649

refinement was performed in COOT45 and REFMAC 46, respectively. Geometry correctness of

650

the final structures were checked using Molprobity47. Data collection and refinement statistics

are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations

709

Initial simulation models were built according to the X-ray crystal structure p63-PAD-3P, with

710

bound ADP replaced by ATP. All crystallographic water molecules and ions within 10 Å of the

711

protein were retained. ATP and a complexed Mg 2+ ion were added using the Protein Data Bank

712

entry 1CSN as template, by superimposing the protein backbones and aligning the nitrogen

713

atoms of ATP with the crystallographic ADP. Missing side chains were added using the

714

software Modeller48. The triple phosphorylated peptide PAD-3P was elongated to

715

TPpSSApSTVpSVGSSETRGER with charged termini as used in the kinetic measurements by

716

means of VMD Molefracture49 and Modeller (S592 and E593 coordinates from p63-PAD-2P).

717

Using these tools, we also constructed a complex of CK1 with a shortened peptide

718

ACE-TPpSSApSTVpSVGSSETRG-NME capped with N-terminal acetyl and C- terminal

719

methylamino capping groups. This peptide mimics the full-length protein, because E597 and

720

R598 may not be accessible to CK1. In a third setup, the point mutation V589A was introduced

721

into the longer peptide using Modeller. In all three setups, Asp128 was protonated. All other

722

residues were simulated in their physiological protonation state. All three MD simulations were

723

carried out with Gromacs 201850 using the AMBER99SB*-ILDN-q force field51-54, the water

724

model TIP3P55 and the Schwierz ion force field56 for Mg2+ and NaCl at 150 mM concentration.

725

Force field parameters for ATP and phosphoserine were taken from Meagher et al.57 and

726

Homeyer et al.58, respectively. The system was energy minimized followed by five equilibration

727

steps with successively decreasing position restraints on heavy atoms, first in an NVT

728

ensemble (0.25 ns) and then in an NPT ensemble (4 x 0.5 ns) using a Berendsen thermostat

729

and barostat59. The three production runs of 1 µs each were run at a temperature of 310 K in

730

an NPT ensemble using a Nosé-Hoover thermostat60. The pressure was maintained at 1 bar

731

with a Parrinello-Rahman barostat61. The minimum heavy-atom distances between E593 and

732

Arg127, between E593 and Lys154, as well as the minimum heavy-atom distance between

733

V589 or A589 (sidechain) and the protein CK1 were monitored at 1 ns intervals using the gmx

734

mindist tool. The raw distance data were processed using Moving Average Smoothing with a

735

window size of 5. All structural figures were made using VMD 49.

736

Data accessibility

737

All data are fully available upon request.

Coherence selection is achieved by gradients G8, G10 , and G12 that are applied with amplitudes

(-70 %, 30 %, 19.87 %) and (-80 %, 20 %, 30.13 %) to record N- and P-type transients,

1037

respectively. For each t2 increment both types are collected alternately by changing pulse

1038

phases Φ6 from y to –y and Φ7 from x to –x. The two FIDs are stored separately and then

1039

added and subtracted to form the real and imaginary parts of a complex data point with a 90°

zero-order phase shift being added to one of the components. Phase Φ 5 is inverted along with

1041

the receiver reference phase in every other increment to shift axial peaks to the edge of the

a, Simplified kinetic model of the activation of TAp63α. Upon DNA damage TAp63α is modified

1071

by CHK2 kinase and subsequently by CK1. For this model it is assumed that the initial CHK2

1072

phosphorylation events as well as the first two CK1 modifications are fast and can therefore

1073

be summarized into a single kinetic constant k 1. The hypothetical activity of phosphatases

1074

counteracting the phosphorylation at this point is described as k 2. The decisive phosphorylation

1075

of S591 is described by k3 and the competitive reaction to apoptosis, namely degradation of

the tetrameric protein, is described as k 4.b, Further simplified diagram of the kinetic model
