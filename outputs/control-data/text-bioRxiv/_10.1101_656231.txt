ABSTRACT
The domestic Bactrian camels were treated as the principal means of locomotion between the
eastern and western cultures in history. To address the question of their origin, we performed
whole-genome sequencing of 128 camels across Asia, including representative populations of
domestic Bactrian camels from the Mongolian Plateau to the Caspian Sea, as well as the extant wild
Bactrian camels and dromedaries. The domestic and wild Bactrian camels showed remarkable
genetic divergence since they were split from dromedaries, confirming they were separated species.
The wild Bactrian camels made also little contribution to the ancestry of domestic ones. Among the
domestic Bactrian camels, those from Iran exhibited the largest genetic distance from others, and
were the first population to separate in the phylogeny. Although evident admixture was observed
between domestic Bactrian camels and dromedaries living around the Caspian Sea, the large genetic
distance and basal position of Iranian Bactrian camels could not be explained by introgression alone.
Taken together, our study favored the Iranian origin of domestic Bactrian camels, which were then
immigrated eastward to Mongolia where the native wild Bactrian camels inhabited. This study
illustrated the complex genomic landscape of migration underlying domestication in Bactrian
camels.

INTRODUCTION
Camels (Camelus, Camelini) contain two extant domestic species, the one-humped dromedary
(Camelus dromedarius) and the two-humped Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) [1, 2]. While the
former herds are mainly feed in North Africa and West Asia, the latter herds wildly live in the cold
desert areas of Northeast and Middle Asia. The wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), the only
representative of the wild tribe Camelini as a result of the extinction of the wild dromedary [3], is
listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature [4] with an
estimation of a few hundreds to 2,000 individuals [5, 6]. Historically, the wild Bactrian camel was

widely distributed throughout Asia, extending from the great bend of the Yellow River westward to
central Kazakhstan, but it can only be found in the Mongolian Gobi and the Chinese Taklimakan
and Lop Noor deserts today [7]. Fossil and molecular evidence suggested that the ancestor of
camels lived in North America and spread to Asia via the Bering land bridge around 11 or 16
million years ago [8, 9]. Within the Camelini, the dromedaries and Bactrian camels were then split
around 4 or 5 million years ago [9, 10]. The domestication of camels, like many other domestic
mammals, has promoted unprecedented progress in cultural and economic development of human
societies, representing a great leap forward for human civilization. For example, the Bactrian camels
were rightfully considered as the principal means of locomotion across the bridge between the
Eastern and Western cultures in the time of the Silk Road.

The origin of domestic dromedaries was recently revealed by world-wide sequencing of modern and
ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which suggested that they were at first domesticated in the
southeast Arabian Peninsula [11]. However, the origin of domestic Bactrian camels is still a mystery.
One intuitive possibility was the extant wild Bactrian camels were the progenitor of the domestic
form, which were then dispersed from the Mongolian Plateau to west gradually [7, 12]. This
hypothesis was supported by the presence of Camelid faunal remains at Neolithic sites near
Mongolia, although it was unclear these were the domestic as opposed to the wild ones [12].
Despite the fact that the wild Bactrian camel has certain characters distinct from the domestic one,
such as the lower, pyramid-shaped humps, the thinner, lithe legs, and the smaller and more slender

body [7], it is still difficult to tell them apart based on their morphological features alone.
Nevertheless, molecular studies based on mtDNAs discovered dramatic sequence variations
between the wild camels and domestic Bactrian camels, and proposed that the extant wild Bactrian
camel was a separate lineage and not the direct progenitor of the domestic Bactrian camel [9, 13].
Another possible place of origin was Iran [1], where early skeletal remains of domestic Bactrain
camels (around 2,500-3,000 BC) were discovered [14]. Although prehistoric mtDNAs of Bactrian
camels supported the idea that the domestication took place in the southwestern Middle Asia rather
than in Mongolia or East Asia [15], the incomplete archaeological findings and limited molecular
markers provided little decisive information about the actual domestication history.

Whole-genome sequences contain much more molecular markers than mtDNAs, which were
successfully used to portray the origin, migration and admixture of humans [16-18] and domestic
animals [19] such as dogs [20-23] and pigs [24-26]. The genome assembly of Bactrian camels were
published recently [10, 27], which provided a new opportunity to examine the evolutionary
relationship between the extant wild and domestic Bactrian camels and trace their origin. In this
study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 128 camels including both domestic and extant
wild Bactrian camels from their typical habitats. We included dromedaries as well because they
were not only the outgroup of Bactrian camels in phylogeny, but also had a long history of
hybridization with Bactrian camels in breeding practice [2, 28], especially in Middle Asia. Our
results supported the Iranian-origin hypothesis of domestic Bactrian camels, and a roughly
west-to-east route of migration back to the Mongolian Plateau.

RESULTS
Sample collection and whole genome sequencing
A total of 105 domestic Bactrian camels across Asia, 19 wild Bactrian camels from Gobi-Altai
region in Mongolia as well as 4 dromedaries from Iran were gathered for this study (Supplementary
Figure S1 and Table S1). The domestic Bactrian camels were chosen to cover as many major

geographic regions as possible, including 55 from Inner Mongolia (IMG), Xinjiang (XJ) and
Qinghai (QH) of China, 28 from Mongolia (MG), 6 from Kazakhstan (KAZA), 10 from Russia
(RUS) and 6 from Iran (IRAN). As a variety of local breeds were formed due to the wide utilization
of domestic Bactrian camels in China and Mongolia, 8 different representative breeds were chosen
from the regions. The other domestic Bactrian camels from Middle Asia were living around the
Caspian Sea.

After DNA extraction, individual genomes were sequenced to an average of 13× coverage
(Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S2). The sequence reads were aligned to our previous genome
assembly of the Bactrian camel [27] for variant calling (Supplementary Figure S3). After stringent
filtering, we totally identified 15.76 million SNPs and 1.97 million small indels (Supplementary
Table S3). Functional annotation of the variants indicated that about 68.75% of them were
intergenic, 30.18% were intronic and 0.77% were exonic (Supplementary Table S4 and Table S5).
Among the variants, 15.49 million, 5.96 million and 10.31 million were identified in the domestic
Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels and dromedaries, respectively (Supplementary Table S3).
Although dromedaries were more divergent from both of the Bactrian camel species in phylogeny,
the domestic Bactrian camels shared more variants with the dromedaries (52.69%) than with the
wild Bactrian camel (31.14%) (Supplementary Figure S4) due to the tremendous reduction of
genetic variants observed in the extant wild Bactrian camel.

Genetic diversity and differentiation
For a more detailed comparison of the genetic diversity among different populations, we first
removed 14 individuals showing close genetic relationship with the remaining others
(Supplementary Table S6). The pairwise nucleotide diversity π (Figure 1A) of dromedaries (1.65×
10-3) was significantly higher than that of Bactrian camels from all geographic regions
(0.92×10-3-1.14×10-3, Supplementary Table S7), which was in contrast to previous heterozygosity
estimates based on individual genomes [10]. One important reason could be the hybridization
practice between dromedaries and Bactrian camels in Middle Asia [28]. Among the Bactrian camels,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/656231; this version posted June 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

the wild population showed the lowest π (0.92×10-3) compared with all of the domestic populations
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S7). Although this result violated many cases that wild
animals usually have higher genetic diversity than the domestic breeds derived from them such as
dogs [22], pigs [25] and rabbits [29], it would happen due to the fact that the extant wild Bactrian
camels are critically endangered with an extremely small population size [4]. In addition, the
domestic populations living around the Caspian Sea generally showed a higher diversity than those
living in the Mongolia Plateau (Figure 1A). The tendency was also confirmed by the Watterson’s θ
(Supplementary Figure S5). Again, the hybridization with dromedaries in Middle Asia could
account for the higher diversity in the region.

We then measured the pairwise genetic distance between the camel populations by Weir’s Fst
(Figure 1B). The result was well in agreement with the known phylogeny, which indicated that the
dromedaries had the highest Fst with the Bactrian camels (0.53-0.63), and the wild Bactrian camels
had the second highest Fst with the domestic ones (0.27-0.30). The differentiation among the
domestic Bactrian camels was much lower, implying a single-origin of them. Interestingly, among
the domestic Bactrian camels, those from Iran displayed the largest divergence with all others
(0.05-0.06). To validate the population differentiation, we constructed a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree
for all individuals based on their pairwise identity-by-state (IBS) matrix (Supplementary Figure S6).
The NJ tree also supported IRAN as the first population separated from all the other domestic
Bactrian camels, implying the possibility of Iranian origin of domestic Bactrian camels.

Population structure with admixture
To reveal the overall population structure with potential admixture, we pruned the SNPs by
removing those with high linkage disequilibrium, extremely low minor allele frequency and
potential functional effects. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis based on the pruned
subset reproduced the similar result as the full set (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S7). As
expected, the dromedaries and wild Bactrian camels could be separated by the first and second
coordinates, respectively. When the third coordinate was incorporated in the MDS, IRAN was

separated from all other domestic Bactrian camels (Figure 2A).

To estimate different ancestral proportions, we performed population structure analysis with
Admixture [30] by assuming K ancestral populations (Figure 2B). The cross-validation procedure
supported that K = 3 was optimal (Supplementary Figure S8), showing a clear division between the
dromedaries, wild Bactrian camels and domestic Bactrian camels. Evident introgression of domestic
Bactrian camels into the Iranian dromedaries was observed, at least in one dromedary. Accordingly,
the dromedary ancestry was prevalent in the Caspian Bactrian camel populations including IRAN,
KAZA and RUS, with a proportion estimated as 1%-10%. Moreover, we observed introgression of
domestic Bactrian camels into several wild individuals with a proportion of 6%-15%. As the wild
camels have become quite rare, it was proposed that the introgression could threaten the genetic
distinctiveness of the wild species [31]. On the contrary, the wild camels contributed nearly nothing
to the ancestry of domestic populations, even to the Mongolian populations which share close
habitats with the wild camels. Although most domestic Bactrian camels lacked differentiation when
K grew, IRAN was the first population to separate with a unique ancestry (K = 5, Figure 2B).

As another method to examine the population structure with admixture, we inferred the population
tree for the camels using TreeMix [32] (Figure 2C). When no migration track (m = 0) was added,
the tree topology again indicated that IRAN was the first lineage separated among all the domestic
Bactrian camels. Increasing of migration tracks (m = 3) could dramatically improve the fit of the
model (Supplementary Figure S9), which identified gene flows from dromedaries to domestic
Bactrian camels in Middle Asia, including KAZA, RUS and IRAN with migration weights ranging
from 4% to 8% (Supplementary Table S8). It was worth mentioning that while the migration track
pointed at the end of the dromedary branch to IRAN, it pointed at the middle of the dromedary
branch to KAZA and RUS (Figure 2C). This could imply a ghost population related to the Iranian
dromedary that contributed to the ancestry of KAZA and RUS. However, TreeMix detected no
signal of migration between the wild and domestic Bactrian camels. We then used the
less-parameterized three- and four-population (F3/F4) test [33] to evaluate the statistical

significance of the admixture events. Again, the F3 test strongly supported the admixture of
dromedaries and Bactrian camels in KAZA, RUS and IRAN (Supplementary Table S9), but it did
not support the admixture between the wild and domestic Bactrian camels. The more sensitive F4
test confirmed a significantly higher extent of admixture between dromedaries and Bactrian camels
in Middle Asia compared with those in Northeast Asia (Supplementary Table S10). Among the latter,
a higher extent of admixture with dromedaries was detected in XJ than in MG/IMG.

Evidence for Iranian origin by removing introgression
Mongolia and Iran were the two alternative regions of domestication for Bactrian camels based on
archaeological evidences [1, 12, 15], but the most probable one remained unsolved. Although we
observed the largest genetic differentiation between the Iranian population and all the other
domestic ones, the existence of admixture between dromedaries and Bactrian camels in Middle
Asian would weaken the support for origin inference. To reduce this confounder effect, we
attempted to remove the introgressed segments of dromedaries from the Bactrian camel genomes by
using the ‘BABA/ABBA’ test [34]. We grouped the Mongolian and Caspian domestic populations,
and compared allele sharing between the two groups with dromedaries (Figure 3A). We used the
statistic fd, a robust version of the Patterson’s D to locate introgressed segments [35], and applied a
strict significance level of Z-score = 2 by using the Jackknife procedure (Supplementary Figure
S10). In a total of 21,188 non-overlapping 100-kb segments across the genome, there were far more
segments with significant signals of introgression in the Caspian populations

(11,651, Z > 2) than

in the Mongolian populations (3,778, Z < -2) as expected. We then performed the Admixture
analysis based on the remaining segments and confirmed that the introgression of dromedaries were
effectively removed (Supplementary Figure S11). Re-calculation of the pairwise Fst after removing
introgression still indicated that IRAN was the most differentiated one (0.04-0.06) among all the
domestic populations (Figure 3B). To gain more insights into the population phylogeny, we
re-constructed the NJ tree based on the pairwise Fst and performed the bootstrap test (Figure 3B). It
was shown that IRAN was the first one to separate among all the domestic Bactrian populations,
followed by KAZA and RUS. These results implied the Iranian origin of domestic Bactrian camels

and a dispersal route from Middle Asia to Mongolia.

As an independent evidence, we also reconstructed the maximum likelihood tree of full-length
mtDNAs based on the 128 samples we sequenced in this study, as well as 39 additional samples
available from Genbank (Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S11). Introgression of mtDNAs could
easily be identified and excluded from the tree. For example, two newly sequenced mtDNAs from
KAZA and RUS were clustered with dromedaries. Within the clade of domestic Bactrian camels,
although most camels from different geographic regions were mixed, two mtDNAs from IRAN
formed the most basal lineages of the domestic populations (Figure 3C). Moreover, after removing
the introgressed mtDNAs, IRAN displayed the highest nucleotide diversity (Supplementary Table
S12). These mtDNA results were in agreement with the nuclear genome and again implicated the
Iranian origin of domestic Bactrian camels.

Demographic history of Bactrian camels
We performed several parametric modeling analyses to infer the demographic dynamics of the
camels in history. Consistent with previous study [10], the long-term trajectories of Bactrian camels
based on the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) model [36] revealed a
tremendous decrease in the effective population size of the ancestral camels earlier than one million
years ago (Supplementary Figure S12). Although the long-term trajectories of the wild and domestic
Bactrian camels were generally similar, they were obvious to diverge from each other as early as 0.5
million years ago. The whole-genome divergence was in agreement with previous mtDNA studies
[9, 13], which proposed that the domestic Bactrian camels and the extant wild ones were separated
so long that the former could not be directly derived from the latter.

In order to explore the divergence time among the camel populations in more detail, we used the
generalized phylogenetic coalescent sampler (G-PhoCS) [37]. Given the phylogeny of the camel
populations, G-PhosCS could estimate the mutation-scaled population size and population
divergence time based on unlinked neutral loci in individual genomes from each population

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/656231; this version posted June 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

(Supplementary Figure S13 and Supplementary Table S13). The time was calibrated by assuming
the Bactrian camel and dromedary divergence of 5.73 million years in the Timetree database [38],
When no migration band was incorporated, convergence of all parameter estimates could easily be
achieved (Supplementary Figure S14 and Supplementary Table S14). Similar to the PSMC results,
the effective population size was generally decreased from ancestral to modern populations (Figure
4). The divergence time between wild and domestic Bactrian camels was estimated as 0.49 million
years ago (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.65 Mya, Figure 4), which was slightly later than
that based on mtDNAs (0.7 Mya) [13]. Among the domestic populations, IRAN was separated from
others about 10.2 thousand years ago (95% CI: 0.25-22.5 Kya), and then the Caspian and
Mongolian populations were separated about 7.39 thousand years ago (95% CI: 0.01-18.5 Kya,
Figure 4). To allow for gene flow, we also tried to introduce migration bands from dromedaries to
Bactrian camel populations (Supplementary Figure S13 and Supplementary Table S13). The
estimates could only converge when a migration band from Iranian dromedaries to IRAN, as well as
a migration band from a ghost population to KAZA were introduced (Supplementary Figure S15
and Supplementary Table S14). The total migration rate was estimated as 1% for both migration
bands, though the divergence time between Bactrian camel populations was indistinguishable with
the migration model.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we characterized for the first time the whole-genome variations of camels across Asia,
including domestic Bactrian camels representing a major subset of recognized breeds, extant wild
Bactrian camels as well as dromedaries. As the extant wild Bactrian camels are going towards
extinction, our research provided extremely valuable genetic resources of the living fossil. Also,
considering the extensive utilization of domestic camels in transportation, milk and wool production,
our data provided new options to implement genetic association study and marker-assistant selection
for improving livestock productivity and future breeding effects. In addition, these data provided an
unprecedented opportunity to trace the origin and migration of domestic Bactrian camels in history.

Previous studies found limited archaeological records and molecular markers for the first
domestication of Bactrian camels in Middle Asia rather than in East Asia [15]. Here, we provided
more evidences on the basis of the whole-genome sequences to support that hypothesis, particularly
for the domestication in the area of Iran. We found that IRAN exhibited the largest genetic distance
from all other domestic populations, and it harbored a unique ancestry not present in other
populations. Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that IRAN was also the first one to separate
among the domestic populations, which was followed by the other Caspian and Mongolian
populations. Although evident introgression of dromedaries was observed in the Caspian
populations, we demonstrated that it will not influence our results by removing the introgressed
genomic segments. In contrast, although the extant wild and domestic Bactrian camels share close
habitat in Mongolia, our whole-genome analyses gave a coherent result to other mtDNA analyses
that the two populations were separated by so long a time that the latter were not likely to originate
from the former [9, 13]. Furthermore, the extant wild camels contributed little to the gene pool of
domestic populations, implying that the domestic populations in Mongolia could possibly be
immigrated there during more recent periods.

Based on these results, we proposed a comprehensive scenario for the origin and migration of the
Bactrian camels (Supplementary Figure S16). After the ancestor of camels moved from North
America and split into dromedaries and Bactrian camels, the wild Bactrian camels spread from East
to Middle Asia about 0.5 million years ago. The Bactrian camels were first domesticated in the area
of Iran around 10 thousand years ago, which were then migrated back to East Asia with the
increasing economic exchange and cooperation between West and East. In more recent periods, the
domestic Bactrian camels around the Caspian Sea were further hybridized with domestic
dromedaries out of Arabia. This scenario could well resolve the mystery why the wild and domestic
Bactrian camels from the Mongolian Plateau have so large genetic distance. It was also similar to
what happened in human evolution. Modern genomic evidence suggested that although many
groups of ancient hominids occupied the continent in history, they were globally extinct and

substituted by only a small group of people out of Africa [18].

Despite the insights gleaned from our data, it was important to note that the direct wild progenitor of
domestic Bactrian camels were not found in Iran now, which may no longer exist. However, there
were records suggesting that the wild Bactrian camels were more widely distributed throughout Asia
in history, extending from the great bend of the Yellow River westward to central Kazakhstan [7]. In
future work, sequencing of ancient genomes from camel fossils will add to the picture of their early
domestication.

METHODS
Sample preparation
Blood samples of 105 domestic Bactrian camels were collected from villages in China (55),
Mongolia (28), Kazakhstan (6), Russia (10) and Iran (6). Blood samples of 4 dromedaries were also
collected from Iran. The collection were made during routine veterinary treatments with approval
from the Camel Protection Association of Inner Mongolia. An endeavor was made to collect
samples from unrelated individuals based on the information provided by the owners and local
farmers. We collected 50 ml blood for each camel from the jugular vein after disinfection treatment,
placed it in EDTA anticoagulant tubes, and then stored it at -80 °C. Skin samples from the ear (0.5
cm) of 19 wild Bactrian camels were collected from the Great Gobi-Strictly Protected Area “A” in
Mongolia. The wild Bactrian camels chosen were artificially reared, and the research was reviewed
and approved by the Great Gobi National Park. Proper surgical procedures were adopted in the
collection. Local anesthesia (5% Procaine Hydrochloride) was applied to the ear, and the wound
was disinfected with iodophor and sulfonamide powder. The samples were eluted with PBS buffered
solutions, placed in cryotubes and stored at -80 °C.
Genome sequencing
The genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μl blood samples with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit
(Qiagen), and from the skin samples with a standard phenol-chloroform method. The quality and
integrity of DNA was controlled by OD260/280 ratio and agarose gel electrophoresis. For
sequencing library preparation, the genomic DNA was sheared to fragments of 300–500 bp, which
were then end-repaired, ‘‘A’’-tailed, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligated
products with sizes of 370–470 bp were selected on 2% agarose gels and then amplified by PCR.
The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platform with standard paired-end mode.

Variant calling
We used an in-house script to perform quality control on raw sequencing reads. Low-quality reads
marked by Illumina sequencers in the FASTQ files were removed. 3’-ends with base quality score <
20 were trimmed, and reads with length < 35-bp were removed after trimming. Trimmed reads were

BWA-MEM (v0.7.12) [39] for each individual with default parameters. We followed the GATK
pipeline (v3.2-2) [40] for variant calling. Firstly, PCR duplicates were removed using Picard tools
(v1.135), and local indel realignment were performed. Secondly, SNPs and small indels were called
across all 128 individuals simultaneously. Finally, the raw variants were filtered with the following
criteria: 1) variant quality score > 40; 2) average sequencing depth of individuals 1-40; 3)
individuals with missing genotypes < 20. Total number of SNPs were reduced from 17.76 to 15.76
million after filtering. Functional annotation of variants were performed with ANNOVAR

Population statistics and structure
Summary population statistics, including pairwise nucleotide diversity π, Watterson’s θ and Weir’s
Fst across 10-kb sliding windows were calculated by VCFtools (v0.1.12b) [42]. Pairwise kinships
between the samples were inferred by KING (v2.1.3) [43], and one of the paired individuals with
close relationship was removed. The following SNPs were further removed by PLINK (v1.07) [44]
for population structure analyses: 1) multiallelic sites; 2) SNPs in approximate linkage
disequilibrium with each other (--indep 50 5 0.2); 3) SNPs with extremely low minor allele
frequency (--maf 0.005); 4) SNPs located within exons and flanking 1-kb regions. A total of 2.65
million SNPs were preserved. Multidimensional scaling and pairwise distance matrix based on IBS
were calculated using the ‘--mds-plot 4’ and ‘--distance-matrix’ option in PLINK, respectively. The
distance matrix was used to construct the neighbour-joining tree by Phylip (v3.69) [45]. 100 random
datasets were generated with ‘--thin 0.1’ option in PLINK, and bootstrap values were retrieved from
the consensus tree reconstructed by Phylip. The population ancestry was inferred by ADMIXTURE
(v1.3.0) [30] with a fast maximum likelihood method. The optimum number of ancestral clusters K
was estimated with the 5-fold cross-validation procedure.

TreeMix analysis and admixture tests
Migration events among camel populations were inferred using TreeMix (v1.12) [32] with
migration number m = 0-5. The threepop/fourpop module from the TreeMix package was used to
perform the F3/F4 test [33, 46] with ‘-k 500’. In the F3 test (Z; X, Y), one focal population (Z) was
tested as a mixture of population X and Y. A large negative value of F3 score (standardized to
Z-score with the Jackknife procedure) would indicate a very strong signal of Z as a mixture of X
and Y. In our analysis, we ran F3 tests with all configurations of the populations. In the more
sensitive F4 test (Y, Z; W, X) where W is an outgroup of Y and Z, the admixture bias between Y and
Z with X was tested. If Y (or Z) have more admixture with X, it will show significant negative (or
positive) F4 score (standardized to Z-score with the Jackknife procedure). To focus on the
admixture between the domestic Bactrian camels and dromedaries, we set the population
configuration as (Y, Z; wild, drome), where Y and Z were two domestic populations.

Local introgression test
To select the local genomic regions with significant introgression between dromedaries and Bactrian
camels after their divergence, we used an in-house script to perform the BABA/ABBA test [34]
across 100-kb sliding windows. For the tree configuration (Y, Z; W, X), the original Patterson’s D
statistic can be calculated as a normalized F4 score [46]:
D=

where pX is the frequency of a given allele in population X, and the expectations E() are estimated
by averaging all SNPs in a window. The more robust fd statistic for local genomic regions, which is
a special form of F4-ratio and directly measures the proportion of introgression [35], can be
formulated as:
f =

We used the population configuration (Mongolian, Caspian; wild, drome) to performed the test. The
fd statistic in each window was evaluated by the Z-score with the Jackknife procedure:

where f is estimated with a 10-kb block removed each time, and n is the repetition times.

Mitochondrial DNA analysis
We complied the full-length mtDNA sequences of camels from both we sequenced in the study and
those collected from GenBank. The sequences were aligned using ClustalW [47]. The control
regions were deleted because they were missing in many sequences and not well aligned. The
maximum likelihood tree was constructed using MEGA (v6.06) [48] with 1000 random bootstrap
runs. The Tamura-Nei model and uniform substitution rates among sites were adopted. The
nucleotide diversity of mtDNAs were calculated by DNASP (v5.1.0.1) [49].

G-PhoCS analysis
To prepare for the G-PhoCS (v1.3) [37] input, we implemented the following filters to the genome
to reduce the effects of selection and sequencing errors: 1) exons and 1-kb flanking regions; 2) gap
regions in the genome assembly; 3) regions with repeat sequence annotations. Altogether, 47% of
the genome were excluded. We then randomly collected 10,000 1-kb loci located at least 30 kb apart
to ensure sufficient inter-locus recombination. Multiple sequence alignments for the loci from
individual genomes per population were retrieved by vcf-consensus in VCFtools [42], with
heterozygous genotypes represented by the IUPAC code and missing genotypes masked by ‘N’.
Recommended gamma priors were used in the G-PhoCS analysis for the mutation-scaled population
size θ, population divergence time τ, as well as migration rate m. The MCMC was run for 100,000
burn-in iterations and 500,000 sampling iterations with 10 iterations between two traced samples.
The automatic fine-tuning procedure was done during the first 10,000 iterations. The convergence
and mixing of the MCMC trace were monitored by Tracer (v1.6, available from
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). Because the stochastic nature of the MCMC algorithm, we
tested the models on independent datasets, and accepted the results only if two independent runs
achieved the similar estimates. Simple model without migration had a high chance to converge, but

none of the runs with migration bands directly from dromedaries to IRAN and/or KAZA showed
convergence. This could be improved by incorporating a ghost population closely related to the
dromedary and with migration band to KAZA. All loci of the ghost population were set as ‘N’. The
time scale in years was calibrated according to a consensus divergence time of Bactrian camels and
dromedaries, which was 5.73 million years ago in TimeTree [38]. The total migration rate across a
given migration band was calculated with M = mτm, where τm was the time span of the migration
band.
