Abstract
In the past few years extensive studies have been put on the analysis of genome function,
especially on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) which offered promise for
characterization of the functional sequencing variation and for the understanding of the basic
processes of gene regulation. However, most studies of eQTL mapping have not implemented
models that allow for the non-equivalence of parental alleles as so-called parent-of-origin effects
(POEs); thus, the number and effects of imprinted genes remain important open questions.
Imprinting is a type of POE that the expression of certain genes depends on their allelic parentof-origin which are important contributors to phenotypic variations, such as diabetes and many
cancer types. Besides, multi-collinearity is an important issue arising from modeling multiple
genetic effects. To address these challenges, we proposed a statistical framework to test the main
allelic effects of the candidate eQTLs along with the POE with an orthogonal model for RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Using simulations, we demonstrated the desirable power and Type I
error of the orthogonal model which also achieved accurate estimation of the genetic effects and
over-dispersion of the RNA-seq data. These methods were applied to an existing HapMap
project trio dataset to validate the reported imprinted genes and to discovery novel imprinted
genes. Using the orthogonal method, we validated existing imprinting genes and discovered two
novel imprinting genes with significant dominance effect.

Author Summary
In the past decades, an unprecedented wealth of knowledge has been accumulated for
understanding variations in human DNA level. However, this DNA-level knowledge has not
been sufficiently translated to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases. Gene
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is one of the most promising approaches to
fill this gap, which aims to explore the genetic basis of gene expression. Genomic imprinting is
an important epigenetic phenomenon which is an important contributor to phenotypic variation
in human complex diseases and may explain some of the “hidden” heritable variability. Many
imprinting genes are known to play important roles in human complex diseases such as diabetes,
breast cancer and obesity. However, traditional eQTL mapping approaches does not allow for the
detection of imprinting which is usually involved in gene expression imbalance. In this study, we
have for the first time demonstrated the orthogonal statistical model can be applied to eQTL
mapping for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. We showed by simulated and real data that the
orthogonal model outperformed the usual functional model for detecting main effects in most
cases, which addressed the issue of confounding between the dominance and additive effects.
Application of the statistical model to the HapMap data resulted in discovery of some potential
eQTLs with imprinting effects and dominance effects on expression of RB1 and IGF1R genes.
In summary, we developed a comprehensive framework for modeling imprinting effect for
eQTL mapping, by decomposing the effects to multiple genetic components. This study is
providing new insights into statistical modeling of eQTL mapping with RNA-seq data which
allows for uncorrelated parameter estimation of genetic effects, covariates and over-dispersion
parameter.

Introduction
With the completion the 1000 Genomes Project [1], an unprecedented wealth of knowledge has
been accumulated for understanding variations in human DNA level. However, much less of this
DNA-level knowledge has been translated to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases.
Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is one of the most promising
approaches to fill this gap, which aims to explore the genetic basis of gene expression
[2]. Among the eQTL techniques, cis-eQTL mapping is the most commonly used technique to
map local eQTLs on the same chromosome of the gene. To evaluate gene expression levels,
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has recently become a widely used high-throughput tool
to assess the gene expression abundance, which has many advantages over microarray, especially
for discovery of novel eQTLs.
Imprinting is a type of parent-of-origin effect that the expression of certain genes depends on
their allelic parent-of-origin. The same alleles transmitted from the mother may have different
expression levels on transcripts with those transmitted from the father. The influence on the
phenotype between the two types of heterozygotes are different, as so-called parent-of-origin
effect (POE). It is now known that there are at least 80 imprinted genes in humans, many of
which are involved in embryonic and placental growth and development [3]. Studies suggested
that POE is an important contributor to phenotypic variation in human complex diseases and may
explain some of the “hidden” heritability. An earlier study showed that for type II diabetes, a
variant of SNP rs2334499 in chromosome region 11p15 was protective when maternally
transmitted, whereas confers risk when paternally transmitted [4]. Evidence also demonstrated
the important roles of POEs in type I diabetes, breast cancer and other carcinomas [4, 5].
However, most studies of eQTL maping have not implemented models that allow for the non-

equivalence of parental alleles; hence the number and effects of imprinted genes remain
important open questions. In the past few years, there were a few approaches that modeled POEs
while searching for eQTLs with RNA-seq data. For example, Zhabotynsky et al. proposed to
jointly model genetic effect and POE with a RNA-seq statistical method which focused on
modeling the allele specific expression [6].
In quantitative genetics, the partition of the variance in statistical components due to
additivity, dominance does not reflect the biological (or functional) effect of the genes but it is
most useful for prediction, selection, and evolution [7]. In 2013, we proposed a unified
orthogonal framework for modeling genetic variants displaying imprinting effects [8]. It allowed
for imprinting effect detection whereas maintained the power to detect the main allelic effect
including the additive and dominance effects. From theory of quantitative genetics, statistical
additive genetic effects are obtained from average allele substitution effects, whereas dominance
effects reflect the deviation of the genotypic values of the heterozygotes and the expected
midpoint of the two homozygotes. In recent years, the inclusion of dominance in genomic
models have been proposed by several researchers. However, multi-collinearity is an important
issue arising from modeling multiple genetic effects. To achieve straightforward model selection
and variance component analysis, uncorrelated estimation of the additive and dominance effect
was necessary. Therefore, in current study, we propose to implement an orthogonal model to
jointly evaluate the effect from both additive and dominance effect along with POE in eQTL
mapping.
Genetic imprinting affects complex diseases through regulating the gene expression and can
reveal an important component of heritable variation that remains “hidden” in traditional
complex trait studies. In this study, we hypothesized that POEs contribute to regulate gene

expression along with the main allelic effect from the gene. We proposed a statistical framework
to test the main allelic effects (i.e., additive and dominance effects) of the candidate eQTLs along
with the POE with an orthogonal model. Intensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the
methods. We also applied the methods to an existing HapMap project trio dataset to validate the
reported imprinting genes and identifying eQTLs for these genes.

Results
Simulations
The statistical power of the Stat-POE and Func-POE methods was illustrated when the POE was
(a) ι = log(1.1) and (b) ι = log(1.2). The results are shown in Figures 1-2, respectively. In both
scenarios, the additive and dominance effects were fixed at log (1.2). We simulated a small fold
change in both allelic effect terms to demonstrate the desirable performance of the Stat-POE
method when the effect size were relatively small to detect. Consequently, even at a sample size
of 50 with moderate over-dispersion (φ= 0.2), the Stat-POE method presented around 70.8%
power to detect a genetic effect at 1.2-fold change in additive effect, corresponding to an effect
size of log(1.2) = 0.18 (Figure 1). To detect POE at the fold change of 1.2, the Stat-POE and
Func-POE methods both reached a statistical power of 83% with a reasonable sample size of 100
(Figure 2). Even with a very small effect size from POE at fold change of 1.1, corresponding to
an effect size of log (1.1) = 0.10, the methods yielded 61% power when the sample size was 200,
and 91% when the sample size was 500 (Figure 1). As expected, the Stat-POE method yielded
same power in detecting POE but more desirable power in detecting main genetic effects
compared to the Func-POE model (Figures 1-2). In conclusion, the Stat-POE method
outperformed the Func-POE method in most simulation scenarios and our methods all achieved
sufficient power for detection of POEs with a relatively sample size (N=100).

With the simulated data, we also evaluated the estimation bias for all the parameters (𝛽,𝛽𝐺,𝜑)
from the Stat-POE model. Table 1 shows that the estimation of all genetic effects achieved
higher accuracy when sample size increased. Interestingly, the estimation of the covariate 𝛽 and
over-dispersion parameter 𝜑 was not notably affected by the sample sizes. Also, the estimation
of genetic effects was not obviously affected by the value of the over-dispersion parameter.
These results revealed the accurate and stable estimation of the covariates and over-dispersion
parameters by using the Stat-POE model. Moreover, large sample sizes and small overdispersion ensured better overall performance of the proposed methods.

To evaluate the Type I error, we also simulated scenarios where there no genetic effect or
POE. Although there were slightly inflated false positives in detecting genetic effect and POEs
when over-dispersion was large, the type I error rates were around the nominal level 0.05 for
both methods in most scenarios especially when moderate over-dispersion existed (𝜑 = 0.2
(Table 2). The false positive rate for detecting the genetic effects was comparable between the
Stat-POE and Func-POE models in most scenarios.

to estimate additive and imprinting effects for 22 genes with previous evidence of imprinting.
These selected genes were identified to be imprinted genes using 296 phased trios from the 1000
Genomes Project and the Genome of the Netherlands participants [9].
With the proposed Stat-POE method, we identified 33 significant cis-eQTLs (adjusted pvalues in additive effects < 0.05) for seven genes including LPAR6, RB1, PXDC1, IGF1R,
AC069277.2, IGF2BP3, SNRPN genes (S2 Table). Among them, most candidate cis-eQTLs
presented maternal expression pattern in regulating the gene expression. Besides, we identified
six genes with imprinting effects, including LPAR6, PER3, RB1, PXDC, IGF1R, and IGF2BP3
with adjusted p-values < 0.05 (Table 3). Among the significantly imprinted genes, the gene
expression of LPAR6 and IGF1R had significant regulation from the candidate cis-eQTLs
rs11633209, rs728075 and rs7329291 in additive effect (adjusted p-values = 1.96×10-66, 3.57×1064 and

3.57×10-64). Interestingly, we also discovered two novel genes which presented significant

dominance effect in gene expression (Table 4), including RB1 gene from multiple candidate ciseQTLs (adjusted p-value = 3.02×10-80) and IGF1R gene from rs4965238 (adjusted p-value =
1.37×10-67). Among the identified genes presenting dominance effect in eQTL mapping, the RB1
gene locating on chromosome 13 is a tumor suppressor gene, the mutation inactivation of which
has been found to be the cause of human cancer [10]. It was also found to be an imprinted gene
earlier in 2009 [11]. Interesting, IGF1R is the only gene which presented both dominance effect
and imprinting effect from the candidate cis-eQTL rs4965238 (Table 4).
In conclusion, our real data application validated several existing imprinted genes, mapped
candidate eQTLs for these imprinted genes. More interestingly, we discovered a few genes
presenting significant dominance effect which might be involved in tumorigenesis.

Discussion
This article stands on recent advances in genetic modeling for carrying out new methodological
developments to the aid of the analysis of genetic imprinting. The orthogonal statistical model
here developed improves previous methods by providing a solution to allowing for additive-bydominance genetic effects for cis-eQTL mapping with RNA-seq data. We demonstrated the
desirable power and preserved Type I error of the statistical POE model with un-biased
estimation of the genetic effects and over-dispersion of the RNA-seq data. The application to the
HapMap project validated previously reported imprinting genes and discovered significant ciseQTLs for these imprinted genes. More interestingly, we also identified two novel imprinting

genes with significant dominance effect, although the interpretation of which is still unclear.
This is the first time the performance of the natural and orthogonal models in detecting POE
with RNA-seq data are evaluated. This project is an extension of the natural and orthogonal
interaction model (NOIA) proposed by Albarez-Castro et al., in 2007 [12], based on which we
have extensively worked on the framework to the estimation of statistical epistasis, geneenvironmental interactions and imprinting effect in genotype-phenotype mapping for quantitative
traits and qualitative traits [8, 13, 14]. In previous findings, we proved that the one-locus StatPOE model for quantitative trait was orthogonal in certain conditions including when HWE was
satisfied [8]. The conclusion should be straightforwardly extended to negative binomial or
Poisson regressions. Although it still needs more effort to evaluate the orthogonality of the StatPOE model when HWE is violated for the current framework of eQTL mapping in RNA-seq, the
proposed work is providing new insights into eQTL mapping which allows uncorrelated
parameter estimation of genetic effects (i.e., additive effect, dominance effect and imprinting
effect) and accurate estimation of covariates and over-dispersion parameters.
In this study, we compared the Stat-POE model and Func-POE model for analyzing POE
effects for RNA-seq data. These two models can be transformed to each other, but they had
different meanings for their parameters and their test statistics varied in formulas. The Func-POE
model focus on the biological properties and describes allele substitution effects thus presented a
natural and interpretable results. The Stat-POE model utilizes the population properties estimated
from the sample therefore presented greater power in detecting additive effect compared to the
Func-POE model, which was consistent with our previous methodology studies in genotypephenotype mapping for quantitative traits [8]. However, using the estimates of genotype
frequencies, parameters from application of the Stat-POE model describes the variance

components, rather than allele substitutions effects as in Func-POE model, so may be seen as
having a less clear interpretation. The results generated from the functional model is not tied to
population rendering easier interpretation however the model selection is not straightforward. In
applications, we will suggest utilizing both Stat-POE and Func-POE models to further
characterize the underlying genetic architecture of the eQTLs.
We also investigated the parameter estimation and hypothesis testing of the two models with
NB regression and Poisson regression assumption of the read counts for different application
scope (results not shown). NB regression will be suggested when the over-dispersion is relatively
large and Poisson regression is suggested to be used for small over-dispersion. In conclusion, we
provided a comprehensive and robust framework for joint estimation of cis-eQTLs and parentof-origin effects.
The current study has several limitations. First, family data such as trios are needed to obtain
the genotypes of heterozygotes in the offspring. Second, borrowing information from the whole
samples will allow for better power for modeling the RNA-seq data. A third direction is to
incorporate the allele specific gene expression(ASE) as conducted in Zhabotynsky’s work so we
can extend our study to model both ASE and POE for candidate cis-eQTLs [6]. The gradually
decreased cost in RNA-seq technology and future studies in methodology are warranted to
achieve more powerful estimation of decomposed variance from different genetic components.

Materials and Methods
Methods: the Stat-POE and Func-POE methods
Our methods are proposed upon a basic model of eQTL mapping of a single gene with RNA-seq
data which are read counts. Therefore, we consider a single gene and study the association of its
expression with the 𝑗-th candidate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Let 𝑦𝑖 be the total read

counts mapped to this gene in the i-th sample, where 𝑖 = 1,…,𝑛 and n is the sample size. We model
𝑦𝑖 by a negative binomial distribution as they are sparse counts data, which is a generalization of
Poisson distribution to allow for over-dispersion. Let 𝑓𝑁𝐵(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖,𝜙) be the probability mass function
for a negative binomial distribution with mean 𝜇𝑖 and dispersion parameter 𝜙:
𝑓𝑁𝐵(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖,𝜙) =

Γ(𝑦𝑖 + 1/𝜙)
𝑦𝑖!Γ(1/𝜙)

(

1/𝜙 𝜙𝜇𝑖 𝑦𝑖
1
1 + 𝜙𝜇𝑖
1 + 𝜙𝜇𝑖 ,𝑦𝑖

) (

)

= 0,1,2,…

where Γ( ⋅ ) is the gamma function. It’s easy to find that the variance Var(𝑦𝑖) = 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜙𝜇2𝑖 , in which
𝜙𝜇2𝑖 is the over-dispersion part. When the over-dispersion parameter 𝜙 goes to 0, 𝑓𝑁𝐵(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖,𝜙)
reduces to 𝑓𝑝(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖) = 𝜇𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑒 ‒ 𝜇𝑖/𝑦𝑖!, which is the probability mass function for Poisson distribution
with parameter 𝜇𝑖. Let 𝐗𝑖 be a set of 𝑝 covariates and 𝜷 = (𝛽1,…,𝛽𝑝)' be the regression coefficients,
and 𝜷𝐺 = (𝑅,𝑎,𝑑, 𝑙)' be the genetic effects from genotypes (𝐺) of the eQTL on 𝑌, where 𝑅 is the
baseline, 𝑎, 𝑑 and 𝑙 are the additive, dominance and imprinting effects from 𝐺, respectively. The
covariate effect of 𝐺 = 𝐺𝑖 and covariates 𝐗 = 𝐱𝑖 on the gene expression, can be formulated through
the following log-linear regression model
log(𝜇𝑖) = 𝜷'𝐱𝑖 + 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺),
where 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺) is the function which reflects the genetic effects.
For a bi-allelic locus, let the major and minor alleles of the 𝑗-th candidate eQTL as 𝐴1 and 𝐴2,
respectively. The genotype G takes four possible values 𝐴1𝐴1, 𝐴1𝐴2, 𝐴2𝐴1 and 𝐴2𝐴2, the first allele
of which with arrow denotes the paternal allele and the second denotes the one originated from
maternal side. We use 𝑝11,𝑝12,𝑝21 and 𝑝22 to denote genotype frequencies in the population, and
use 𝑀 to denote the number of variant allele 𝐴2, which takes values of 0, 1, 1 and 2 for the four
genotypes separately. 𝑀 = 1 + 𝑝22 ‒ 𝑝11 and 𝑉 = (𝑝11 + 𝑝22) ‒ (𝑝11 ‒ 𝑝22)2 are the mean and
variance of 𝑀. For estimation of the genetic effects, there are different methods we can epress the

genetic effect function 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺). Xiao (2013) proposed two related methods for identifying
genetic variants influences quantitative traits with different characteristics, the statistical and
functional POE estimation methods [8]. Accordingly, we can express 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺) as a populationreferenced formulation using an orthogonal model, such expression generated from orthogonality
reparameterization:

𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺) =

{

𝑅 ‒ 𝑀𝑎 ‒ 2𝑝22(𝑝12 + 𝑝21)𝑑/𝑉,
𝑅 + (1 ‒ 𝑀)𝑎 + 4𝑝11𝑝22𝑑/𝑉 ‒ 2𝑝21𝑙/(𝑝12 + 𝑝21),
𝑅 + (1 ‒ 𝑀)𝑎 + 4𝑝11𝑝22𝑑/𝑉 + 2𝑝12𝑙/(𝑝12 + 𝑝21),
𝑅 + (2 ‒ 𝑀)𝑎 ‒ 2𝑝11(𝑝12 + 𝑝21)𝑑/𝑉,

𝑖𝑓𝐺𝑖 = 𝐴1𝐴1
𝑖𝑓𝐺𝑖 = 𝐴1𝐴2
𝑖𝑓𝐺𝑖 = 𝐴2𝐴1
𝑖𝑓𝐺𝑖 = 𝐴2𝐴2

(2.1)

With the orthognality property, this model allows for un-correlated estimation of the genetic
effects including additive, dominance and imprinting effect. Therefore it is referred to the
statistical POE (Stat-POE) model. For a functional model with no orthogonalization property with
a POE component,, the genetic effect function 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺) can be expressed as

𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺) =

𝑖𝑓𝐺𝑖 = 𝐴1𝐴1

the four genotypes, respectively. Indeed, the additive effect 𝑎 measures the fold change of gene
expression between the two homozygotes; the dominance effect 𝑑 measures the deviation of the
heterozygotes from its additive expectation; and the imprinting effect 𝑙 reflects the different

effect from the two types of heterozygotes. The model in Equations (2.3) is therefore defined as a
functional POE (Func-POE) model. This genetic effect model can also be called as natural model
since it uses natural effects of allele substitutions as parameters, mainly focusing on the
biological properties [12].
Theoretically, the parameters from the Stat-POE and Func-POE models can be transformed
to each other in linear regression setting, yet which still present different properties for various
application scopes. As shown in the theoretical derivation from Xiao (2013) [8], the statitical
model will present better power in detecting additive effect given the existence of this effect
whereas the functional model generates more interpretable results.
Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis testing
To estimate the genetic effects and POE, we can write the likelihood based on the data (𝑦𝑖,𝑋𝑖,𝐺𝑖)
(𝑖 = 1,2,...𝑁) as follows,
𝑁

𝐿(𝜷,𝜷𝐺,𝜙;{𝑦𝑖,𝐱𝑖}𝑖 =𝑁 1) = ∏𝑖 = 1𝑓𝑁𝐵(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖(𝜷,𝜷𝐺),𝜙)𝐼𝑁𝐵(𝑦1,…,𝑦𝑁)𝑓𝑃(𝑦𝑖;𝜇𝑖(𝜷,𝜷𝐺))1 ‒ 𝐼𝑁𝐵(𝑦1,…,𝑦𝑁), (2.4)

where 𝐼𝑁𝐵(𝑦1,…,𝑦𝑁) is an indicator function which equals to 1 if a negative binomial distribution
is used and 0 if a Poisson distribution is used.
With equation 2.4, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the model parameters (𝜷𝜙,𝜷𝐺)
with 𝜷𝜙 ≜ (𝜷',𝜙)' can be estimated by the following iterative procedure.
(1) Initialization: We first fit a null model by a Poisson regression using the covariate 𝐗𝑖, and
then estimate 𝜷, which is obtained by the Newton Raptson iteration method based on the
first and second derivatives for the log-likelihood function of the null model, whose
formulas are given in Appendix A.1. Then a score test is conducted for the over-dispersion
parameter, the whole hypothesis testing process of which is shown in Appendix A.2. If
the p-value of the score test is smaller than a cutoff value, e.g., 𝛼 = 0.05, we will fit a

negative binomial regression model and estimate 𝜷𝜙. Under the negative binomial model,
the estimate of 𝜷𝜙 is obtained by an iterative procedure. The details of the iterative
formulas for 𝜷 and 𝜙 are given in (A.10) and (A.11) in Appendix A.3, which is based on
the iteratively re-weighted least squares method [15] and the Newton-Raphson iterate
method, respectively.
(2) Iteration: (a). Given 𝜷 or 𝜷𝜙, estimate 𝜷𝐺 by the Newton-Raphson method, the details of
which are shown in Appendix B; (b). Given 𝜷𝐺, estimate 𝜷 by a Poisson regression with
offsets 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺), or estimate 𝜷𝜙 by a negative binomial regression with offsets 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝜷𝐺).
The estimation for 𝜷 under the Poisson regresion is the same as that in the initialization
step with the first and second derivatives given in Appendix B.6 for the statistical model
and Appendix B.8 for the functional model, respectively. Under the negative binomial
regression, the estimation method for 𝜷𝜙 described in the the initialization step is also used
here with the detailed forlumas given in Appendix B.5 for the statistical model and in
Appendix B.7 for the functional model respectively.
(3) Termination: Iterate steps (1) and (2) until estimates of all the parameters converge.
In order to assess whether each regression covariate in the model is significant on the read
counts of the gene or not, statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. We constructed three
testing methods including the likelihood ratio test (LRT), score test and wald test as follows. For
example, for the test of additive effect with hypotheses
𝐻0:𝑎 = 0 𝑣.𝑠.𝐻1:𝑎 ≠ 0.

Denote 𝜽 = (𝜷𝜙' ,𝜷𝐺' )' for the Negative Binomial (NB) regression, or 𝜽 = (𝜷',𝜷𝐺' )' for the Poisson
regression, the unrestricted MLE and restricted MLE under (Appendix D.1) obtained by the
algorithm given in above section are denoted as 𝜽 and 𝜽 respectively. Without loss of generality,

C. The LRT statistic is
𝑇𝐿 = 2[𝑙(𝜽) ‒ 𝑙(𝜽)].

(2.6)

According to the theory from Rao 2005 [16], in our statistical setting, the score test statistic is
therefore defined as
𝑇𝑆 =

Moreover, the Wald test statistic is defined by:
𝑎2

𝑇𝑊 = 𝐽𝑎𝑎(𝜽)|𝜽.

Under 𝐻0, the statistics 𝑇𝐿, 𝑇𝑆, and 𝑇𝑊 all converge in distribution to 𝜒21. For a given significance

hypothesis testing for the other parameters can be implemented similarly.
Simulations
To evaluate the performance of the proposed statistical methods in eQTL mapping with RNAseq data, we carried out extensive simulation studies in realistic settings. First, we compared

power of the Stat-POE and Func-POE methods in detecting the main allelic effects (including the
additive and dominance effects) and POE. We simulated 𝑦𝑖, the total number of read counts of a
gene in the i-th sample by a negative binomial distribution with 𝜇𝑖𝐺 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(0.1𝑥𝑖 + 𝜔(𝐺𝑖,𝛽𝐺))
and over-dispersion parameter 𝜑 = 0.2, where X was a continuous covariate 𝐗~N(0,1). To
evaluate the performance of the methods in estimating both genetic effects and over-dispersion,
we generated data with different sample sizes N = 50, 100, 200 and 500, respectively. In all
simulation settings, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was assumed that the genotype
frequencies in the sample were set at [p11, p12, p21, p22] = [0.36, 0.24, 0.24, 0.16]. The overdispersion parameter was set at empirical values which was 0.2 or 0.5. The additive effect α and
dominance effect δ were both fixed at log (1.2) where the values of 1.2 reflected the fold change
of the logarithm mean shift of the genotypic values, referring to Equation (2.3). The POE
parameter ι was set at log (1.1) or log (1.2) respectively. Each simulation was replicated for 500
times to evaluate the performance of the Stat-POE and Func-POE methods. Relative bias and
mean square of errors (MSE) were calculated for each parameter in the different scenarios to
evaluate the estimation accuracy. The estimation relative bias was defined as the difference
between estimated value and the true parameter value and then divided by the true parameter
value. We also used simulated data to quantify the power and Type I error rates of the methods.
To illustrate the performance of the proposed methods in detecting different genetic effect terms
and POE, the statistical power for the hypothesis testing was calculated using a range of different
critical values under different scenarios. Type I error was calculated under the null model where
there was no genetic effect or POE.

We used an RNA-seq dataset from 30 HapMap Caucasian samples obtained from the NCBI
Bioproject (PRJNA385599). The samples were collected from lymphoblastoid cell lines from 15
males and 15 females. For most of these samples, the RNA reads were 150 bp paired-end reads,
with an additional run with 75 bp paired-end reads. The median of the total number of reads for
these 30 samples was approximately 20 million. All of these reads were mapped to hg38 human
reference genome using Tophat2 [6].
Since all of these samples were children of family trios, the parents of which were also part
of the samples included in the 1000 Genomes Project[17]. Genotype data of the 30 trios were
used to obtain the phased genotype of the children. For these 30 trios, the HapMap project
genotyped about 3.9 million SNPs. The phasing and imputation of these 30 trios were conducted
by Zhabotynsky et al.’s study, where the phased and imputed genotypes in our study were
directly obtained from [6]. Briefly, SHAPEIT2 [18] was used for phasing and IMPUTE2 [19]
was used for imputation against the 1000 Genome reference panel containing 2, 504 individuals
and ~82 million SNPs. Based on the phased and imputed SNPs, we extracted 6, 211, 048 of high
confidence imputed SNPs (the ones with at least one heterozygote in the sample) in total.
Identification of imprinted genes and genes with dominance effect
We selected 22 known imprinted genes based on the list reported by Jadhav et al. [9]. These
genes were selected because they had abundant expression in the 30 samples (S1 Table). For
each potential imprinted gene, all SNPs in the gene coding region were selected as candidate ciseQTLs. For each cis-eQTL and gene expression pair, the Stat-POE method was applied to detect
candidate eQTLs with additive, dominance and POE effects. Four covariates were adjusted in the
model including the total read counts per individual and the first three principal components
computed from the matrix of normalized expression. In all of the hypothesis testing, Benjamini-

Hochberg (BH) method was used for multiple comparison to adjust the p-values obtained from
the LRT tests [20]. We tested the POE of the previously reported imprinted genes to evaluate the
performance of our methods. For novel discovery of genetic effects of these imprinted genes, we
tested the additive and dominance effects simultaneously.

S1 Table. List of imprinted genes identified in previous studies. 22 genes were included to
study the cis-eQTL and imprinting effects. These genes were included in Jadhav et al., 2018 which
were compared to the identified imprinted genes reported as imprinted by the Genotype-Tissue
Expression (GTEx) project (Baran et al. 2015). The genes were annotated by NCBI hg19 build.
