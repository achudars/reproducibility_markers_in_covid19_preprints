Abstract: During prophase, centrosomes need to separate and position to correctly
assemble the mitotic spindle. This process occurs through the action of molecular
motors, cytoskeletal networks and the nucleus. How the combined activity of these
different components is spatiotemporally regulated to ensure efficient spindle assembly
5

remains unclear. Here we show that during prophase the centrosomes-nucleus axis
reorients, so that centrosomes are positioned on the shortest nuclear axis at nuclear
envelope (NE) breakdown. This centrosomes-nucleus configuration depends on
mechanical cues generated by mitotic chromosome condensation on the prophase
nucleus. We further show these mechanosensitive cues act through SUN1/2 and

10

NudE+NudEL to enable the polarized loading of Dynein on the NE. Finally, we observe
this centrosome configuration favors the establishment of an initial bipolar spindle

spindle assembly by regulating NE-Dynein localization.

Introduction:
Chromosome segregation requires the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle. While
multiple pathways contribute to spindle assembly [1], in human somatic cells
20

centrosomes play a dominant role. During prophase, centrosome separation occurs
independently of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB), in a kinesin-5-dependent manner
[2]. Accordingly, depletion or inhibition of kinesin-5 prevents centrosome separation,
generating monopolar spindles and mitotic arrest [3]. Other players involved in the
process include motors such as Dynein, both at the nucleus [4-8] and at the cell cortex

25

[4, 9], MyosinII [10], but also actin [11] and microtubule pushing forces [9, 12]. How the
forces generated by these components are functionally coordinated to ensure efficient
spindle assembly remains unclear.

During prophase, centrosomes are tethered to the surface of the nuclear envelope (NE)
in a Dynein-dependent manner [7, 8, 13]. Loading of Dynein occurs through multiple
30

pathways which are under the regulation of CDK1 [7] and involve direct binding to
nucleoporins [8, 13] or interaction with the LINC complex [14, 15]. Additional
mechanisms which affect NE Dynein activity, but not loading [5], are also involved in
centrosome separation. Importantly, by tethering centrosomes to the NE, Dynein is
essential for early spindle assembly [8]. Taken together, these reports highlight the

35

contribution of an internal signal on the prophase nucleus for early spindle assembly.
In metaphase, cortical force generators determine spindle orientation [16-19]. These are
activated by external cues [20] and generate pulling forces on astral microtubules [2123] to align the spindle with the long cell axis [24], ultimately defining the division plane.
However, whether centrosome separation and early spindle assembly follow the same

40

cortical cues remains unknown. Defining how external and internal signals are integrated
during early mitosis to ensure efficient spindle assembly and robust division plane
orientation is relevant, since prophase centrosome positioning is essential for accurate
chromosome segregation [25, 26].
Here, we performed a high-resolution analysis of centrosome behavior during mitotic

45

entry in human cells, followed by 3D cellular reconstruction and centrosome tracking.
We show that during mitotic entry, the centrosomes-nucleus axis reorients so that
centrosomes are positioned on the shortest nuclear axis. In addition, we identify a
mechanosensitive nuclear signal that depends on the chromatin condensation state and
enables Dynein loading on the NE. This ensures centrosome-NE tethering and correct

50

positioning on the shortest nuclear axis. As a result, the formation of an initial bipolar
spindle scaffold is facilitated, ensuring maximum exposure of kinetochores to
microtubules and improving chromosome segregation fidelity. Thus, our work unveils
how cytoskeletal and nuclear events are coordinated at the G2-M transition.

Results:
Centrosomes position on the shortest nuclear axis at nuclear envelope breakdown
To characterize mitotic spindle assembly at high spatiotemporal resolution, we
performed 4D imaging in HeLa cells. We observed that when cells are seeded on a
substrate that does not activate integrin signaling (poly-L-lysine; PLL), centrosomes

60

separate independently of NEB (Fig. S1A), as reported previously [2, 25]. However,
when seeded on integrin-activating fibronectin (FBN), ~82% of the cells separate their
centrosomes to opposite sides of the nucleus before NEB. Moreover, cells that have an
increased spreading area at NEB show longer inter-centrosome distances (Fig. S1B),
suggesting that centrosome separation prior to NEB is a function of the adhesion area.

65

To normalize cell area and shape in 2D, we seeded cells on defined FBN micropatterns
and monitored centrosome dynamics, cell membrane and nuclear shape (Fig. 1A), which
were subsequently reconstructed using specifically developed computational algorithms
(Fig. S2). Centrosome dynamics relative to the micropattern was defined by two angles
theta and phi, reflecting movements in xy (azimuth) and xz (inclination), respectively (Fig.

70

1B). These vary between 0o (aligned with the long axis of the pattern) and 90o
(perpendicular to the pattern). We anticipated that separated centrosomes should align
with the long axis of the micropattern, due to the distribution of retraction fibers imposed
by extracellular matrix organization [17, 20]. However, during mitotic entry, centrosomes
deviated from the underlying micropattern, as observed by the high variability of theta

75

and phi (Fig. 1B). This was accompanied by a rotation of the nucleus relative to the long
axis of the pattern, as well as a decrease in cell area (Fig. 1C). Due to the shape
asymmetry of the line micropattern, we could calculate cell membrane eccentricity, which
varies between 1 (completely elongated cell) and 0 (spherical cell). As cell progressed
towards NEB, membrane eccentricity decrease (Fig. 1D) due to a retraction of the long

80

cell axis (Fig. 1E, 0o) and a simultaneous increase in cell width, perpendicularly to the
pattern (Fig. 1E, F; 90o; *** p<0.001). Interestingly, during the rounding process, the

Centrosome positioning requires nuclear and centrosome movement
Our observations suggest that prophase centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear
axis is a result of the combined motion of centrosomes and the nucleus. To confirm this,
we analyzed the relative contribution of each component for the positioning of
110

centrosomes on the shortest nuclear axis (Fig. 2A). We reasoned that if positioning on
the shortest nuclear axis depended exclusively on centrosome movement (centrosome
dominant), the centrosomes-long nuclear axis angle would tend to 90o, and the nucleus
would remain aligned with the micropattern. On the other hand, if this mechanism
required only nuclear rotation, then the nucleus long axis-long cell axis angle would tend

115

to 90o, and the centrosomes movement would be residual. If both components were
involved, then we would observe combined motion of both nucleus and centrosomes
(Fig. 2A-E). Accordingly, when cell rounding is limited, the nucleus is aligned with the
long cell axis and centrosomes deviate from the pattern (centrosome dominant; Fig. 2B,
C). When cell rounding is more pronounced, the nucleus tends to rotate away from the

120

long cell axis (nucleus dominant; Fig. 2B, D). In intermediate cases, both centrosomes
and nucleus deviate from the long cell axis (Fig. 2B, E). Therefore, at earlier time points
(600sec before NEB) when cells have not rounded up significantly, nuclear rotation is
limited and centrosome positioning depends exclusively on centrosome motion (Fig. 2F,
I). However, as rounding progresses, the contribution of nuclear rotation now plays a

125

significant role in determining centrosomes-nuclear axis (Fig. 2G, H, J, K; *p<0.05).
Overall, these observations suggest that cell rounding enables nuclear movement to
facilitate the reorientation of the centrosomes-nucleus axis, so that centrosomes position
on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB (Fig. 2L).

Centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis depends on cell adhesion
area but not cell shape
Our initial observations were obtained with cells seeded on line micropatterns that have
a highly polarized shape. To determine whether centrosome positioning on the shortest
nuclear axis was a result of shape polarization or a more general feature, we followed

155

cells on large circles, small circles and rectangles during mitotic entry (Fig. 3A).
Strikingly, changing from a polarized shape such as a rectangle to an unpolarized large
circle did not block the capacity of centrosomes to position on the shortest nuclear axis
(78% of cells on rectangles and 75% of cells on large circles; Fig. 3A-D). However,
correct positioning depended on the initial spreading area, as seeding cells in small

160

circles led to erratic centrosome movement and only 25% of cells placed centrosomes
on the short nuclear axis (Fig. 3A, B, E; *p=0.02). In addition, cell shape did not interfere

with nucleus orientation relative to the micropattern (Fig. 3F-H), although nuclear shape
did change when cells were seeded on small circles (Fig. 3I; ***p<0.001), with nuclei
becoming more rounded. As a result, cells on small circles lost the coordination of
180

movement between centrosomes and nucleus, when compared to the other
micropatterns. Taken together, these data indicate that centrosomes position on the
shortest nuclear axis at NEB in a cell area-dependent manner but independently of cell
shape.

185

Cell rounding allows the centrosomes-nucleus axis to reorient in prophase
Metaphase spindle orientation is determined by the distribution of actin-based retraction
fibers and this depends on extracellular matrix organization [17, 20]. Therefore, it would
be reasonable to assume that centrosomes should orient according to the same cues
during prophase. However, our results show that prior to NEB (and simultaneously with

190

cell rounding), the centrosomes-nucleus axis reorients away from the underlying
retraction fiber distribution imposed by the micropattern. This suggests that the rounding
process changes the manner in which cells interact with the extracellular matrix. To
confirm this, we performed Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) analysis on cells seeded
on rectangles (Fig. S3A). Under these conditions, cells showed a well-defined traction

195

axis that correlated with the initial centrosome separation axis (theta; Fig. S3A-C). Upon
mitotic rounding, both cell area and the contractile energy exerted on the substrate
decreased (Fig. S3D), leading us to conclude that mitotic rounding decreases the force
exerted by the cell on the substrate. These observations, together with our previous
results, suggest that blocking cell rounding could affect centrosome positioning. To test

200

this we decided to express a mutant form of Rap1 (Rap1Q63E; Rap1*) that interferes

with focal adhesion disassembly, effectively blocking mitotic rounding [27]. Accordingly,
Rap1* expression affected cell rounding, when compared to controls (Fig. 4A, B, D, E).
Centrosome movement was also affected in Rap1* cells, as theta and phi were
decreased when compared to controls (Fig. 4B, E; ***p<0.001). Importantly, the inability
205

of Rap1* cells to round up led to a significant impairment in nuclear rotation when
compared to controls (Fig. 4C, F; *p<0.05). This eventually resulted in a failure to position
centrosomes on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB (Fig. 4G-J; **p<0.01). We conclude
that cell rounding is required to establish the centrosomes-nucleus axis during prophase.

Dynein on the nuclear envelope is required for centrosome-nucleus reorientation
during prophase
225

Next, we wanted to determine which factors influence the positioning of centrosomes on
the shortest nuclear axis. It is well known that kinesin-5 is essential for centrosome
separation [2, 3]. To assess whether it is also required to position centrosomes on the
shortest nuclear axis, we treated cells with an Eg5 inhibitor (STLC), when centrosomes
were already on opposite sides of the nucleus (Late stage) or when centrosomes were

230

still not fully separated (Early stage). Early Eg5 inhibition significantly decreased intercentrosome distance, preventing centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis
(Fig. S4A-C). When Eg5 was inhibited in the Late stage, centrosomes moved towards
the shortest nuclear axis, simultaneously with mitotic cell rounding (Fig. S4D, dashed
line). We concluded that kinesin-5 is required for initial centrosome separation but not

Centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB could rely on signals coming
from the cytoskeleton, centrosomes or intrinsic nuclear cues. To test this, we
260

experimentally uncoupled all components. Centrosome-nucleus tethering in prophase
requires Dynein loading on the NE, which occurs by two pathways involving RanBP2BicD2 and Nup133-CENP-F-NudE/NudEL [7, 8, 13, 28]. Interestingly, Dynein is also
involved in centrosome separation [6, 29], making it a likely candidate to mediate
centrosomes-nucleus orientation. Accordingly, depletion of either NudE+NudEL or

265

BicD2 led to centrosome detachment from the NE (Fig. 5A; Movie S2). Consequently,
centrosomes no longer positioned on the shortest nuclear axis (Fig. 5B-D; ***p<0.001).
Moreover, both depletions impaired rotation of the nucleus relative to the long cell axis
(5E-G; ***p<0.001). Unexpectedly, cell rounding was differentially affected by the two
depletions (Fig. 5H; ***p<0.001), suggesting that BicD2 is required for nuclear rotation

270

independently of cell rounding. Depletion of total Dynein Heavy Chain (DHC) induced
similar centrosome positioning and nuclear rotation defects, which could be due to a
delayed cell rounding (Fig. S5A-C; ***p<0.001). We conclude that centrosome-nucleus
coupling through NE Dynein is essential for centrosome-nucleus axis orientation at NEB.

Dynein can be found in different subcellular localizations. During later stages of mitosis,
275

it localizes to the cell cortex through the LGN-Gi-NuMA complex, and this can be
prevented by inhibiting Gi activity with pertussis toxin (PTx) [19, 30]. To determine
whether cortical Dynein is also involved in centrosome-nucleus reorientation, we treated
cells with PTx during mitotic entry (Fig. S5D). Under these conditions, cells rounded up
prematurely (Fig. S5E; ***p<0.001) and the nucleus showed increased rotation (Fig. S5F;

280

**p=0.002). Overall, this did not prevent centrosomes positioning on the shortest nuclear
axis at NEB (Fig. S5G), since these cells are still able to load Dynein on the NE (Fig.
S5H, I). Taken together, our results indicate that cortical Dynein is not required for
centrosomes-nucleus reorientation during prophase.
Finally, we tested whether Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC)-mediated

285

nucleus-cytoskeletal coupling is necessary for centrosome positioning, as this complex
is required for NE Dynein loading and centrosome tethering during neuronal
development [14, 15]. We expressed a KASH-GFP construct (Fig. 5I), which displaces
endogenous Nesprins from the NE, disrupting the LINC complex [31, 32] and
consequently its connection with the cytoskeleton. Under these conditions, cell rounding

290

was faster than in controls (Fig. 5J; ***p<0.001) but nuclear rotation was not affected
(Fig. 5K). Consequently, centrosomes still positioned on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB
(Fig. 5L), although the centrosome-nucleus reorientation shifted towards a nucleusdependent mode (Fig. 5M). Overall, we concluded that centrosomes need to be attached
to the surface of the NE in a Dynein-dependent manner to position on the shortest

295

nuclear axis at NEB.

Chromatin condensation is required for centrosome positioning
We showed that prophase centrosome-nucleus coupling mediated by Dynein is required
for proper centrosome positioning. However, this does not explain the bias towards the
300

shortest nuclear axis. We reasoned there must be some intrinsic nuclear property that

could provide the cues for centrosome positioning. We started by analyzing DHC-GFP
distribution on the NE during prophase with both live-cell imaging (Fig. 6A, Movie S3)
and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 6B) and found that Dynein was distributed in an
asymmetric manner on the NE, concentrating on curved areas of the envelope (Fig. 6A,
305

B, D). To further characterize NE behavior, we measured active NE fluctuations in cells
expressing the nucleoporin POM121-3xGFP. We calculated deviations from the median
and the maximum amplitude for each NE coordinate and time point. Fluctuations were
analysed on the regions corresponding to the long (green triangles) and short (red
triangles) nuclear axes (Fig. 6E) and revealed significant differences between the long

310

and short nuclear axes (Fig.6 F, G). Overall, these data indicate that the prophase NE
has spatial asymmetries.
During interphase, Lamin A and chromatin are the main regulators of the nuclear
mechanical response [33, 34], that mediate the response to large and small
deformations, respectively. To test their relative contribution for the nuclear asymmetry,

315

we analyzed Dynein distribution on the NE following depletion of Lamin A by RNAi or
after treatment with ICRF-193, a Topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibitor, or Valproic acid
(VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC). Treatment with either TopoII or HDAC
inhibitors should interfere with chromatin structure, decreasing overall nuclear stiffness
[35]. Interestingly, inhibition of either TopoII or HDACs induced a loss of Dynein

320

specifically on the NE (Fig. 6B, D, H-J), without interfering with Dynein recruitment to the
kinetochore or cell cortex (Fig. S6). Moreover, BicD2 and NudE localization also seemed
unaffected (Fig. S7A, B). Overall, these data suggest that mitotic chromosome
condensation during prophase is required for NE-Dynein recruitment, independently of
its known nucleoporin adaptors. On the other hand, Lamin A depletion induced a loss of

325

Dynein polarization, without affecting its recruitment to the NE (Fig. 6C, D). This was
similar to what we observed following incubation with Nocodazole (Noco; Fig. 6B, D) and
allowed us to conclude that an intact microtubule network and nuclear lamina are

(L; n=27; ***p<0.001) and VPA (M; n=29; ***p<0.001). All experiments were replicated at least
three times.

Since modifying chromatin condensation disrupted Dynein loading, we assessed
355

whether these treatments also affected centrosome positioning. Accordingly, treatment
with ICRF-193 or VPA prevented centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis,
when compared to controls (Fig. 6K-M; Fig. S8A, C; ***p<0.001). However, they had
different effects on nuclear rotation (Fig. S8B, D; ***p<0.001). Inversely, Lamin A
depletion did not affect centrosome positioning at NEB, nuclear rotation or cell rounding,

360

when compared to controls (Fig. S8E-H). However, instead of migrating along the NE,
centrosomes often deformed the nucleus to generate a local short axis (Fig. S8E, bottom
panel). Accordingly, prophase nuclei in Lamin A RNAi cells were more irregular (Fig. S8I)
and positioned their centrosomes further away from the nuclear centroid (Fig. S8J).
Overall, we conclude that chromatin condensation is required for centrosome positioning

365

on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB.

Mechanical confinement is sufficient to load Dynein on the nuclear envelope
Interphase chromatin condensation state affects nuclear stiffness and shape [34-36].
Given our observations that interfering with chromatin condensation affects Dynein
370

loading and that compressive forces can induce a reversible chromatin condensation
[37], we wondered whether mechanical confinement of the nucleus could rescue Dynein
loading in cells treated with either ICRF-193 or VPA (Fig. 7A). To test this, we applied a
reversible confinement on cells and analyzed DHC-GFP localization using live-cell
imaging and immunofluorescence analysis. Confinement of control cells decreased

375

DHC-GFP signal on the NE (Fig. 7B, C), possibly due to a decrease in Dynein density
[5]. Confinement release was sufficient to restore NE-Dynein localization (Fig. 7B, C),
albeit without restoring its polarized distribution (Fig. 7E, F). Importantly, confinement

and release of ICRF-193 or VPA-treated cells, was sufficient to rescue NE-Dynein
loading, without restoring polarization (Fig. 7B, D-F). We conclude that mechanical
380

compression of the nucleus, when chromosome condensation is pharmacologically
altered, is sufficient to rescue NE-Dynein loading.

Next, to determine whether the mechanical regulation of Dynein recruitment to the NE
400

required the known NE adaptors, we treated cells with ICRF-193 in combination with
depletion of BicD2 or NudE/NudEL. Then, we subjected these cells to mechanical
confinement and assessed NE-Dynein levels. Strikingly, mechanical confinement in the
absence of NudE/NudEL was not able to rescue Dynein loading on the NE, contrary to
BicD2-depleted cells (Fig. 8A-C). These observations indicate that the mechanical

405

recruitment of Dynein to the NE occurs through the NudE/NudEL pathway. We then set
out to test how the mechanical stimulus could be transmitted across the NE.

Transduction of mechanical forces to the nucleus requires an intact SUN-KASH complex
[38]. Importantly, SUN1/2 were shown to be required for NE Dynein loading during
neuronal development [14, 15] and mitotic entry [39]. To test whether SUN proteins could
425

mediate the mechanoresponsive recruitment of Dynein to the NE during prophase, we
depleted SUN1/2 using shRNA in HeLa cells expressing DHC-GFP. Upon SUN1/2
depletion, Dynein levels on the NE were significantly reduced (Fig. 8E; *** p<0.001) and
could not be recovered after mechanical mechanical stimulation (Fig. 8F). Overall, our
data suggests that SUN1/2 transmit mechanical forces across the NE to allow loading of

430

Dynein via the Nup133/CENP-F/NudE-NudEL pathway.

Centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis facilitates spindle assembly
Centrosome positioning at NEB is known to affect mitotic fidelity [25, 26]. Here, we tested
specifically whether positioning on the shortest nuclear axis affects spindle assembly
435

efficiency. We imaged cells on FBN or PLL and correlated centrosome positioning,
mitotic timing and missegregation events (Fig. 8A, Movies S4 and S5). Seeding cells on
PLL affected centrosome separation (“incomplete separation”; 23% for PLL and 8% for
FBN) and positioning on the shortest nuclear axis (51% for PLL and 72% for FBN), when
compared to FBN (Fig. 8B). Consequently, PLL-seeded cells had increased

440

missegregation events (19.2%) when compared to FBN (5.7%) (Fig. 8C). These were
mainly lagging chromosomes in cells with incomplete centrosome separation (Fig. 8D),
as was described previously [26]. We conclude that the extent of centrosome separation
increases chromosome segregation fidelity. Next, we determined whether centrosome
positioning affects mitotic timing. Cells on PLL had a significant delay in anaphase onset

445

when compared to cells on FBN (Fig. 8E, * p<0.05). This delay was due to cells that
separate, but do not position centrosomes on the shortest nuclear axis (“other axis”;
72±29 min, *** p<0.001), as opposed to cells with centrosomes on the “shortest axis”

ensures timely progression through mitosis.

Discussion:
Mitotic spindle assembly is essential for the fidelity of chromosome segregation.
465

Accordingly, delays in centrosome separation [25, 26] or alterations in spindle geometry
[40] often lead to chromosomal instability (CIN). Therefore, understanding the

20

mechanisms regulating centrosome separation and bipolar spindle assembly is critical
to determine the causes underlying CIN.
At the transition from G2 to mitosis, interphase adhesion complexes disassemble [27,
470

41], cell margins retract [42] and microtubule dynamics change [43, 44]. This leads to a
reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which is required to form a stiff mitotic cortex [45] that
facilitates bipolar spindle assembly [46]. During this stage, Dynein is loaded on the NE
through multiple pathways mediated by RanBP2 [13], Nup133 [8], the LINC complex [14,
15] and the nuclear lamina [5]. Here, we show that mitotic cell rounding in combination

475

with NE Dynein are essential to allow reorientation of the centrosomes-nucleus axis, so
that centrosomes position on the shortest nuclear axis at NEB. Importantly, this
temporary prophase centrosome-nucleus configuration is clearly distinct from the
mechanism driving metaphase spindle orientation. In this case, external cues [17, 20]
activate cortical force generators [16, 18, 19] and transmit pulling forces to astral

480

microtubules [9, 20-22], to ensure robust centrosome positioning. How does cell
rounding cooperate with NE Dynein to ensure the correct orientation centrosomesnucleus axis during prophase? Based on our results and previous reports [47, 48], we
propose that Dynein-mediated forces generate a rotational torque on the nucleus that
results in centrosome motion when nuclear rotation is limited due to cell adhesion.

485

Alternatively, if cell shape is extensively remodeled during mitotic rounding, Dyneinmediated forces generate nuclear rotation, while centrosomes remain stationary [47].
Accordingly, we show that inducing cell rounding is sufficient to increase nuclear
displacement (Fig. S5), whereas forcing cell spreading constrains nuclear rotation (Fig.4
and [49]).

490

It is unlikely that centrosome movement along the NE surface per se justifies the
preferential centrosomes-nuclear axis observed at NEB, which argues for an intrinsic
nuclear cue in this process. Our results indicate that prophase mitotic chromosome
condensation could play such a role, by creating a suitable mechanical environment on

the prophase nucleus and allowing NE Dynein loading. During prophase, mitotic
495

chromosomes condense and Lamin A is released into the nucleoplasm [50, 51]. These
events likely change the mechanical properties of the nucleus, which in interphase are
known to depend on chromosome condensation and the nuclear lamina [34, 36]. How
could the mechanical properties of the prophase nucleus regulate Dynein loading?
Connection of the nucleus to the cytoskeleton occurs through the LINC complex,

500

composed of KASH proteins on the outer nuclear membrane and SUN proteins on the
inner nuclear membrane [52], which ensure nucleo-cytoplasmic mechanotransduction
[32, 38]. Importantly, they regulate Dynein loading on the NE [14, 15] to control
centrosome tethering and nuclear motility [53]. We propose that mitotic chromosome
condensation increases intranuclear stiffness, which is transmitted to the NE through

505

SUN proteins. In turn, this allows Dynein to load on the NE by interacting with
NudE/NudEL bound to the nuclear pores through Nup133-CENP-F [8]. In support of this
model, it was shown that SUN1 can directly interact with the NPC complex [54], removal
of SUN1/2 decreases the accumulation of Dynein on the NE [39] and both SUN1 and
SUN2 are necessary to couple chromosomes to the NE [55, 56]. In addition, these

510

observations also justify how confinement, either by inducing transient chromatin
condensation [37] or imposing mechanical strain on SUN proteins [31], is able to restore
NE Dynein localization. Interestingly, this mechanosensitive behavior seems to be
restricted to Dynein, since the Dynein adaptors BicD2 and NudE are still present on the
NE even after interfering with chromatin condensation (Fig. S7). The exact nature of the

515

mechanosensitive behavior of Dynein remains to be determined.
Chromosome capture during early mitosis was proposed to occur through a “search-andcapture” mechanism [57]. Subsequent work demonstrated that timely spindle assembly
could not rely solely on the “search-and-capture” mechanism [58], but depended on the
contribution of kinetochore-driven microtubule nucleation [59], kinetochore compaction

520

[60] and chromosome motion [61] and distribution [62]. In addition to these, we propose

22

an additional spindle assembly facilitating mechanism that requires centrosome-nucleus
axis reorientation during prophase to ensure efficient chromosome capture. We propose
that centrosome positioning on the shortest nuclear axis favors the assembly of a spindle
scaffold to ensure maximum exposure of kinetochores to microtubules. In combination
525

with the spatial distribution of chromosomes in a ring configuration [62], this would
accelerate spindle assembly, minimizing the probability of generating erroneous
attachments. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that centrosome
mispositioning significantly delayed mitosis, whereas failure to separate centrosomes
altogether generated chromosome missegregation events, as previously described [26].

530

In summary, we propose a model where centrosome positioning during prophase is a
process that depends on an internal mechanosensitive signal provided by chromatin
condensation, which facilitates the formation of an initial bipolar spindle scaffold to
ensure mitotic fidelity.

Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Life

grown in a 37˚C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HeLa DHC-GFP and HeLa POM1213xGFP/H2B-mCherry cell lines were a kind gift from Iain Cheeseman and Katharine
Ullman, respectively. HeLa cell line expressing histone H2B-GFP/mRFP-α-tubulin was
generated in our lab using lentiviral vectors. For this purpose, HEK293T cells at 50%70% confluence were co-transfected with lentiviral packaging vectors (16.6 µg of Pax2
and 5.6 µg of pMD2) and 22.3 µg of LV-H2B-GFP (a gift from Elaine Fuchs, Addgene
plasmid 25999) or pRRL-mRFP-α-tubulin plasmids, using 30 µg of Lipofectamine2000
(Life Technologies). After transfection, the virus-containing supernatant was collected,
centrifuged, filtered and stored at –80°C. HeLa parental cells were then transduced with
each lentivirus in the presence of polybrene (1:1000) in standard culture media, for 24 h.
The lentiviruses were used individually, giving time for cells to recover between
transductions. After the second transduction, H2B-GFP/mRFP-α-tubulin double-positive
cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; FACS Aria II). For
transient overexpression of pEGFP-KASH (a gift from Christophe Guilluy) or pRK5Rap1[Q63E] plasmids (a gift from Jean de Gunzburg), cells were transfected with the

Micro-patterns to control individual cell shape and adhesion pattern were produced as
previously described[63]. Briefly, glass coverslips (22 X 22mm No. 1.5, VWR) were
activated with plasma (Zepto Plasma System, Diener Electronic) for 1 min and incubated
with 0.1 mg/ml of PLL(20)-g[3,5]-PEG(2) (SuSoS) in 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, for 1 h,
at RT. After rinsing and air-drying, the coverslips were placed on a synthetic quartz
photomask (Delta Mask), previously activated with deep-UV light (PSD-UV, Novascan
Technologies) for 5 min. 3 µl of MiliQ water were used to seal each coverslip to the mask.
The coverslips were then irradiated through the photomask with the UV lamp for 5 min.
Afterwards, coverslips were incubated with 25 μg/ml of fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and
5 μg/ml of Alexa546 or 647-conjugated fibrinogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100 mM
NaHCO3 at pH 8.6, for 1 h, at RT. Cells were seeded at a density of 50.000
cells/coverslip and allowed to spread for ~10-15h before imaging. Non-attached cells
were removed by changing the medium ~2h-5h after seeding.

Pertussis toxin (PTx) was used at 40 nM (Merck). Inhibition of Topoisomerase II was
done using 10 µM of ICRF-193 (Merck-Millipore). Inhibition of histone deacetylases
(HDACs) was done using 1.5 M of VPA (Sigma-Aldrich). To interfere with the
microtubule cytoskeleton, we used nocodazole (20 nM) (Sigma-Aldrich). To inhibit Eg5,
STLC was added at 5 M. All the drugs used were added to the culture medium 30 min1h before live-cell imaging or fixation, except ICRF-193 and VPA which were added 8h16h before the experiments. Control cells were treated with DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) only.

For time-lapse microscopy, 12-24 h before the experiments 1.5x105 cells were seeded
on coverslips coated with FBN (25μg/ml; F1141, Sigma) or PLL (25μg/ml; F1141,
Sigma). When micro-patterns were used, 5x104 cells were seeded on coverslips coated
with FBN (25μg/ml; F1141, Sigma). Prior to each experiment, cell culture medium was
changed from DMEM with 10% FBS to Leibovitz’s-L15 medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FBS and Antibiotic-Antimycotic 100X (AAS; Life Technologies).
When SiR-dyes were used, they were added to the culture medium 30min-1h before
acquisition (20nM Sir-tubulin or 10nM Sir-DNA; Spirochrome). Live-cell imaging was
performed using temperature-controlled Nikon TE2000 microscopes equipped with a
modified Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-disc head (Yokogawa Electric), an electron
multiplying iXon+ DU-897 EM-CCD camera (Andor) and a filter-wheel. Three laser lines
were used for excitation at 488, 561 and 647nm. For nuclear pore fluctuation analysis,
an oil-immersion 100x 1.4 NA Plan-Apo DIC (Nikon) was used. All the remaining
experiments were done with an oil-immersion 60x 1.4 NA Plan-Apo DIC (Nikon). Image
acquisition was controlled by NIS Elements AR software. For centrosome tracking 17-21
z-stacks with a 0.5µm separation were collected every 20 sec. For mitotic timing
quantifications, 13 z-stacks with a 0.7 µm separation were collected every 2 min. For
nuclear envelope fluctuation measurements a single z-stack was collected every 100
msec.

Quantitative analysis of centrosomes, cell membrane and nucleus membrane

645

Detailed quantitative analysis of centrosomes location and membranes topology (cell
and nucleus) was performed using custom made MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks Inc.,
USA; R2018a). The image analysis took advantage of the different labeling for
centrosomes, cell membrane and nuclear membrane. The scripts were separated into
three modules with specific workflows: i) centrosomes tracking, ii) nuclear and cellular
membrane reconstruction, and iii) nuclear membrane surface dynamics. Tracking of
centrosomes position/trajectories was performed in three-dimensional (3D) space using
image stacks with a pixel size of 0.190μm and z-step of 0.7μm. Images were preprocessed using a Laplacian of Gaussian filter with a user-defined kernel size,
associated with the centrosome radius in pixels. Image segmentation was performed
using Otsu’s method, and morphological operators were used to improve the mask and
obtain the centrosomes 3D coordinates. Error correction methods, such as automatic
thresholding adjustment or in the limit frame elimination, were implemented to take care
of frames where the standard method was unable to uniquely identify 2 centrosomes.
For the visualization of the centrosomes trajectories (space and time), the centrosomes

coordinates were interpolated using cubic splines. Different metrics, such as the distance
between centrosomes (pole-to-pole), were calculated to analyze and characterize the
trajectories. Cellular and nuclear membranes were reconstructed in 3D space taking
advantage of specific labeling. For each membrane, a mask was produced using Otsu’s
method and improved with a sequence of morphological operators (namely image close,
dilation and erosion, small objects removal). The orientation axis for the membranes
were calculated using principal components analysis (PCA) of a large sample of
membrane surface points. This method using PCA was found to be more robust than
ellipsoid fitting to the membrane surface (followed by extraction of the axis vectors). From
the centrosomes locations and nuclear membrane reconstruction, it was possible to
calculate the angle between the centrosomes axis and the nucleus major axis.
Quantification of nuclear membrane surface fluctuation was performed in 2D using a
single slice with a pixel size of 0.102μm. The coordinates of the pixels in the membrane
contour were extracted for each frame by first reducing noise with a median filter
(neighborhood of 3×3 pixels) followed by object segmentation. The segmentation used
a statistical threshold (median + standard deviation), and was improved with small
objects removal and closure morphological operations. A reference membrane contour
for the nucleus, obtained from the median intensity projection of all frames, was used as
“baseline” for the fluctuation analysis. The (Euclidean) coordinates of the nuclear
membrane pixels for each frame were converted to polar coordinates, and fluctuations
were calculated as the difference in the radial component to the reference contour. The
center of the polar coordinates was defined as the centroid of the reference membrane
contour. The polar coordinates allowed the decomposition of the fluctuations normal to
the nuclear contour (captured in the radial coordinate). The analysis was limited to 60°
angular apertures centered on the membranes main axis, as to minimize the error in the
radial component. Different methods were designed to explore, analyze and visualize
the radial components of the membrane contour. In these methods, the membrane radial
fluctuations were characterized using statistics such as maximal amplitudes or standard
deviation of the radial component. Radial displacement maps were produced as the
radial shift of each point in the membrane with respect to the reference (median)
membrane contour. Nuclear irregularity index was calculated as described previously
[35].

Preparation of micropatterned hydrogels with nanobeads

Firstly, 32mm coverslips were plasma cleaned for 30 sec and then incubated with a drop
of PLL-PEG 0.1 mg/mL in HEPES 10 mM ph7.4 for 30 min at RT as described previously
[64]. Coverslips are then put upright to let the excess PLL-PEG run off and placed on a
line or circle shape quartz photomask (Toppan) on a 3μl drop of MilliQ water. The
coverslips on the photomask are then exposed to deep-UV for 5min. Then, coverslips
are detached from the photomask and incubated with 20μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) and
20μg/ml Alexa546-conjugated fibrinogen (Invitrogen) in PBS for 30min at RT. To prepare
the gels, a 42μl drop of 40KPa mix of Polyacrylamide and bisacrylamide (Sigma)
containing 0.1μl carboxylate-modified polystyrene fluorescent beads (Invitrogen) is
placed onto the fibronectin coated coverslips and then covered with a second coverslip,
pretreated with Bind-silane solution (100% ethanol solution containing 18.5μl Bind
Silane; GE Healthcare Life Science) and 161μl 10% acetic acid (Sigma) for 5 min. Gels
are polymerized for 30 min and finally the gel is retrieved with the silanized coverslip.

For TFM live-cell imaging, rectangle micropatterned coverslips are mounted in dedicated
chambers and supplemented with L-15/10% FBS medium. A Leica SP8 confocal
microscope was used to acquire the images using a 40X objective (oil immersion,
numerical aperture 1.3) with a temperature control chamber set at 37°C. Cells were
imaged every 3min. 488 nm and 533 nm lasers were used in sequential scanning mode.
All the laser parameters and imaging setups are controlled through the LAS X system.
Cellular traction forces were calculated using a method previously described [65]. Briefly,
at each time point, the image of the fluorescent beads embedded in the substrate was
compared to a reference image corresponding to a relaxed substrate and taken after
washing away the cells. After correcting for experimental drift, the displacement field was
obtained by a two-step process consisting of cross-correlation on 9.6μm sub-images
followed by particle tracking to improve the spatial resolution. The final displacement field
was interpolated to a regular grid with 1.2μm spacing. Traction stress reconstruction was
performed with the assumption that the substrate is a linear elastic half-space using
Fourier transform traction cytometry (FTTC) and zeroth order regularization. The stress
map was defined on the same 1.2μm-period grid. From this stress map and the cell mask,
we checked that the out of equilibrium force is less than 10% of the sum of forces
magnitude, as a quality criterion for all cells and time points. The contractile energy,
which is the mechanical energy transferred from the cell to the substrate, was computed
from the traction map by integrating the scalar product of the displacement and stress
vectors over the cell surface. To determine the principal direction of contraction of each
cell, we calculated and diagonalized the first moment tensor of the stress. The
eigenvector corresponding to the larger eigenvalue gives the direction of the main force
dipole. The degree of force polarization is obtained by comparing both eigenvalues. All
the calculations are performed in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., USA; R2018a).

Cell confinement setup
For confinement experiments, a dynamic cell confiner was prepared as described
previously [66], using a custom-designed layout to fit a 35mm dish. Briefly, a suction cup
was made in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, RTV615, GE) mixture (10/1 w/w PDMS
A/crosslinker B) in a custom-made mold and baked on an 80°C hot plate for 1h before
unmolding. The confining structure on the glass slide was made in PDMS from molds
fabricated by standard photolithography. Briefly, an epoxy mold was used with a regular
holes array (diameter: 440 μm, 1 mm spacing). A drop of PDMS mixture (8/1 w/w PDMS
A/crosslinker B) was poured into the mold. Then, a 10 mm standard microscope
coverslip, freshly activated for 2 min in a plasma chamber (Diener Electronics, Germany),
was pressed on a PDMS drop to get a residual PDMS layer of minimal thickness. After
baking at 95°C on a hot plate for 15 min, excess PDMS was removed. To peel off the
glass slide with PDMS pillars, a drop of isopropanol was poured on the slide. Finally, the
slide was gently raised by inserting a razor blade between the slide and the mold,
allowing the confining glass slides bound to the PDMS structures to be lifted away.

Cells were fixed with 4% PFA in Cytoskeleton Buffer (274 mM NaCl, 2.2mM Na 2HPO4,
10mM KCL, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Pipes, 10 nM Glucose,
pH 6.1) and subsequently permeabilized with 5% Triton X-100 (Sigma- Aldrich) in 1x
PBS for 5min. After washing in 10% Triton X-100, cells were blocked with 10% FBS in
10% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30min. All the primary antibodies were diluted in blocking
solution and incubated for 1h at room temperature. After this incubation the cells were
washed with 10% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS and incubated with the respectively secondary
antibody for 1h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking
solution. DNA was stained with DAPI, which was added to the secondary antibodies
solution (1ug/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation with the secondary antibodies and
DAPI the coverslips were washed with 10% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS and sealed on glass
slides mounted with 20mM Tris pH8, 0.5 N-propyl gallate and 90% glycerol. The following
primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Lamin A+C (1:500, Abcam), rabbit anti-Lamin
B1 (1:500, Abcam), rat anti-alpha Tubulin (1:500 Bio-Rad), rabbit anti-NudE/NudEL
antibody (1:500, gift from Richard Vallee), rabbit anti-SUN1 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich),
rabbit anti-SUN2 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich). Alexa Fluor 488, 568 and 647 (1:2000,
Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Where indicated, SiR-actin and SiRDNA were used at a concentration of 20nM (Spirochrome). Images were acquired using
an AxioImager Z1 (63x, Plan oil differential interference contract objective lens, 1.4 NA;
all from Carl Zeiss) which is coupled with a CCD camera (ORCA-R2; Hamamatsu
Photonics) using the Zen software (Carl Zeiss).

Quantification of DHC-GFP fluorescence intensity

To quantify fluorescence intensity in immunofluorescence samples, z-stacks containing
the entire cell were collected and sum-projected using ImageJ. To identify the nuclear
envelope, Lamin B1, SUN1/2 or Lamin A immunostaining were used as a guide.
Subsequently, three linescans were done on the nuclear envelope regions
corresponding to the long and short nuclear axes, respectively. The mean gray value of
each linescan was measured and averaged for each individual cell.

HeLa cell extracts were collected after trypsinization and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for
5min, washed and resuspended in 30-50L of Lysis Buffer (NP-40, 20 nM HEPES/KOH
pH 7.9 ; 1 mM EDTA pH 8; 1 mM EGTA; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5% NP40; 10% glycerol, 1:50
protease inhibitor; 1:100 Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were then flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept on ice for 30min. After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for
8min at 4o C the supernatant was collected and protein concentration determined by the
Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were run on 7%-15% SDS-PAGE gels
(50g per lane) and transferred, using the iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Thermo Scientific),
to a nitrocellulose Hybond-C membrane. With the exception of DHC RNAi samples, all
others were transferred using a wet blot apparatus for 3h at 70V, with constant
amperage. Afterwards the membranes were blocked with 5% Milk in TBS with 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were:
mouse anti-Nde1 (1:500, Abnova), mouse anti-Lamin A+C (1:500, Abcam), mouse antiLaminA (1:100, Abnova), rabbit anti-ARPC4 (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit anti28

BICD2 (1:250, Atlas Antibodies), mouse anti-Dynein intermediate chain 74.1 (1:1000,
Merck), rat anti-alpha tubulin (1:1000, Bio-Rad). All primary antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4oC with shaking. After three washes in TBS-T the membranes were
incubated with the secondary antibody for 1h at room temperature. The secondary
antibodies used were anti-mouse-HRP and anti-rabbit-HRP at 1:5000. After several
washes with TBS-T, the detection was performed with Clarity Western ECL Substrate
(Bio-Rad).

Each experiment was repeated independently at least three times and sample sizes are
defined in each figure legend. We used three to six independent experiments or
biologically independent samples for statistical analysis. For knockdown experiments,
the knockdown efficiency of each experiment was measured by quantifying
immunoblots. When data are represented as box-whisker plots, the box size represents
75% of the population and the line inside the box represents the median of the sample.
The size of the bars (whiskers) represents the maximum (in the upper quartile) and the
minimum (in the lower quartile) values. Statistical analysis for multiple group comparison
was performed using a parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when the
samples had a normal distribution. When the sample did not have a normal distribution,
multiple group comparison was done using a nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis).
All pairwise multiple comparisons were subsequently analyzed using either post-hoc
Student-Newman-Keuls (parametric) or Dunn’s (nonparametric) tests. When comparing
only two experimental groups, a parametric t test was used when the sample had a
normal distribution, or a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for samples without
normal distribution. Distribution normalities were assessed using the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. No power calculations were used. All statistical analyses were performed
using SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software, Inc.).

Figure S4 - Eg5 is required for early centrosome separation but not centrosome
positioning, related to Figure 3
(A) Polar plot quantifying centrosome positioning (red circles) relative to the longest nuclear axis
(blue ellipse) at NEB for cells treated with STLC when centrosomes were already on opposite
sides of the nucleus (Late stage; green ; n=12) or when centrosomes were still not completely
separated (Early stage; red; n=30). (B) Inter-centrosome distance for cells treated with STLC in
either the Early stage (red) or the Late stage (green) of centrosome separation. Note how intercentrosome distance only decreases in Late stage cells when cell rounding begins (~550sec
before NEB). Lines correspond to averages and shaded areas correspond to SD. Correlation
between the average theta values (red; corresponding to centrosomes xy orientation), average
phi values (blue; corresponding to centrosomes z orientation) and cell membrane eccentricity
(black) for cells in early (C) or late (D) stage of centrosome separation. The long axis of the
micropattern was oriented horizontally and defined as a reference point, corresponding to a value
