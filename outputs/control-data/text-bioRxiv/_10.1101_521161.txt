Abstract
The majority of clinical trial failures are caused by low efficacy of investigated drugs,
often due to a poor choice of target protein. Computational prioritization approaches aim
to support target selection by ranking candidate targets in the context of a given disease.
We propose a novel target prioritization approach, GuiltyTargets, which relies on deep
network representation learning of a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network
annotated with disease-specific differential gene expression and uses positive-unlabeled
machine learning for candidate ranking. We evaluated our approach on six diseases of
different types (cancer, metabolic, neurodegenerative) within a 10 times repeated 5-fold
stratified cross-validation and achieved AUROC values between 0.92 - 0.94, significantly
outperforming a previous approach, which relies on manually engineered topological
features. Moreover, we showed that GuiltyTargets allows for target repositioning across
related disease areas. Applying GuiltyTargets to Alzheimer’s disease resulted into
a number of highly ranked candidates that are currently discussed as targets in the
literature. Interestingly, one (COMT) is also the target of an approved drug (Tolcapone)
for Parkinson’s disease, highlighting the potential for target repositioning of our method.

Author summary
Many drug candidates fail in clinical trials due to low efficacy. One of the reasons is the
choice of the wrong target protein, i.e. perturbation of the protein does not effectively
modulate the disease phenotype on a molecular level. In consequence many patients
do not demonstrate a clear response to the drug candidate. Traditionally, targets are
selected based on evidence from the literature and follow-up experiments. However, this
process is very labor intensive and often biased by subjective choices. Computational
tools could help a more rational and unbiased choice of target proteins and thus increase
the chance of drug discovery programs. In this work we propose a novel machine learning
based method for target candidate ranking. The method (GuiltyTargets) captures
properties of known targets to learn a ranking of candidates. GuiltyTargets compares
favorably against existing machine learning based target prioritization methods and
allowed us to propose novel targets for Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction
Drug discovery is a time consuming, expensive and complicated process [1–4]. Many
drug candidates fail in clinical studies due to low efficacy, mainly because of wrong
target choice [5–7]. Traditionally, scientists identified targets by searching through
the relevant literature, following clues from mRNA and protein expression, integrating
expression data with pathway analyses, experimenting with knockout mice, investigating
somatic mutations, gene fusions, and copy number variations, and using the accumulated
knowledge from multiple experimental studies to generate a hypothesis on how a molecule
might work as a target [2, 8, 9]. However, manually interpreting many data sources is
prone to biased identification of targets as it limits the potential to use all available
and helpful data. By computationally integrating multiple biological data sources to
analyze prior knowledge, it should be possible to make target identification process
faster, less biased, and more informed. Computational target prioritization approaches
thus aim for improving target identification process by ranking proteins based on their
likelihood of being targets in the context of a specific disease [10–17]. Most of them
integrate biological networks with other data sources to prioritize targets for infectious
diseases [11–13], cancers [14–16] or neurodegenerative diseases [17].
In addition, machine learning methods have been used to prioritize drug targets. For
example, Emig et al. proposed an approach, in which for each candidate target a number
of different network topological features are combined with proximity to differentially
expressed genes in a particular disease of interest [10]. All features are subsequently
combined into a logistic regression model, which allows for a ranking of candidate targets.
The authors successfully tested their approach with 30 different diseases. Another
example is the method by Ferrero et al., which uses features provided by the Open
Targets database [18] and combines them into one ranking score using Support Vector
Machines [19].
In this paper we propose a novel approach to prioritize targets using a combination
of unsupervised network representation learning, namely the recently proposed Gat2Vec
method [20], and logistic regression. More specifically, our method, GuiltyTargets, first
maps a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network annotated with differential gene
expression information into an Euclidean space using Gat2Vec. In that space, we then
use positive-unlabeled (PU) machine learning [21–24] to learn a ranking of candidate
targets. To the best of our knowledge, network representation learning as a data driven
approach to implicitly learn relevant topological features from a network structure has
not been used for target prioritization so far. The proposed approach is compared to
the approach from Emig et al. [10] for six diseases, demonstrating its superior ranking
performance. For the example of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in-depth analysis shows
that GuiltyTargets can be used to reposition known targets from other neurological
indications.

Results
GuiltyTargets: A New Approach for Deep Network Representation Learning Based Target Prioritization
Our newly developed GuiltyTargets method can be summarized as follows (Figure
1): First, a genome-wide PPI network is compiled and annotated with discretized
information about differential gene expression within a given disease context (-1 =
underexpressed; 0 = no significant change; 1 = overexpressed). Next, the attributed
network is embedded into an Euclidean space using Gat2Vec. Following a PU learning
scheme known disease specific protein targets are assigned positive labels, and the

Fig 1. GuiltyTargets pipeline. First, a protein-protein interaction network is annotated
with discrete differential gene expression information (up-regulated, down-regulated, not
differentially expressed). 128 features are extracted from this annotated network using
Gat2Vec. These features are input to a logistic regression algorithm where known
targets are labeled as positive and the remaining as negative. The likelihoods that are
calculated by the classifier is then used for ranking.
remaining proteins are regarded as pseudo-negatives to train a classifier that ranks a
candidate protein according its similarity to known targets for the given disease. More
details about GuiltyTargets are described in the Methods section of this paper.

Validation Data
We performed target prioritization analyses for six different diseases using corresponding
gene expression data for acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, multiple sclerosis and AD. The choice was made based
on the following criteria: First, five of these diseases have also been evaluated in the
publication by Emig et al. [10], which we used for comparison here. Second, the number
of available known targets for each disease was expected to be relatively high for a
statistically meaningful validation. Finally, we added AD to investigate the applicability
of our approach to a highly challenging disease, in which so far most attempts to establish
new drugs have failed [25]. Details about about used data, including pre-processing,
are described in Materials and Methods Section. Notably, for AD we investigated
RNASeq data from different cohorts (MSBB [26], MayoRNASeq [27], ROSMAP [28]).
To investigate the prediction performance of GuiltyTargets we employed two proteinprotein interaction networks (STRING [29], HIPPIE [30]), two target databases (Open
Targets [18], Therapeutic Target Database [31]) and different cutoffs to discretize
differential gene expression via log2 fold change thresholds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5) while requiring
a false discovery rate of less than 5%.

GuiltyTargets Outperforms Existing Method
The performance of our approach and the method by Emig et al. were compared within
a 10 times repeated 5-fold cross validation scheme with the area under ROC curve
(AUROC) as the evaluation criterion. This assessed the ability of each method to rank
in an independent test set a true known target higher than an unknown protein. For
this purpose, the approach employed by Emig et al. was re-implemented using the same
PPI network resources and target databases as for GuiltyTargets.

Table 1. Ranking performance of GuiltyTargets compared to the method by Emig et
al. in terms of cross-validated AUROC ( standard error). The table shows the results
when using Open Targets as resource for drug targets, STRING (using the default
confidence threshold) as PPI network and declaring differential gene expression based
on log2 fold change cutoff of 1.5, which is agreement to Emig et al. The column
“Reported” shows the AUROC values reported by Emig et al. and the column
“Implemented” shows the AUROC values obtained by the reimplementation of their
method. The row “Alzheimer’s Disease” refers to the MayoRNAseq data from temporal
cortex, which among all tested AD gene expression datasets showed genes with an
absolute log2 fold change larger than 1.5.
Results shown in Tables 1, S1 and S2 demonstrate a dramatic performance increase of
up to 40% by GuiltyTargets compared to the method by Emig et al.. Notably, AUROC
values found by our re-implementation of were not identical (but typically close) to the
ones reported in the original paper. This was likely due to the fact that not the same
PPI network and target database resources have been used. More specifically, Emig et
al. employed the commercial MetaBase™database, whereas here we only rely on public
resources.
We employed an ANOVA to assess the statistical significances of our findings. The
ANOVA model was built separately for each investigated scenario (PPI network, target
database, log2 fold change cutoff) with three factors: method, dataset and an interaction
term between method and dataset. The ANOVA F-test confirmed a highly significant
improvement of GuiltyTargets compared to the method by Emig et al. for each disease
and scenario (p < 0.001 after Holm’s correction for multiple testing, see Figure 2). As
expected there was a highly significant dataset dependency of AUROC performance in
every case (p < 2.2e − 16). Post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s multiple comparisons of
means revealed that, on average, GuiltyTargets outperformed the approach by Emig et
al. by 14.8% AUROC.

In-Depth Analysis of Influence Factors on GuiltyTargets Performance
We wanted to better understand the dependency of the performance of GuiltyTargets
on the different tested influence factors, which we had varied individually in our crossvalidation analysis:
• PPI network (STRING, HIPPIE), including different confidence level thresholds
• Target database (Open Targets, Therapeutic Targets Database)
• Thresholds for declaring differential gene expression
For this purpose we fitted a two-way ANOVA model with interaction term (influence
factor, dataset, interaction term between both) and then performed a Tukey post-hoc
analysis. Table 2 demonstrates that the employed PPI network is the most relevant
influence factor for GuiltyTargets: Using STRING significantly increased the AUROC
compared to using HIPPIE by 9%. On the other hand, the chosen log2 fold change

threshold had almost no influence, i.e. GuiltyTargets is highly robust against this
parameter. A more conservative confidence threshold for the STRING network yielded
a drop in prediction performance by 3%. Both findings together may be explained
by a comparably strong influence of the network topology for GuiltyTargets, which is
leveraged by Gat2Vec. An obvious question is therefore, in how far GuiltyTargets is
affected at all by gene expression data or whether our method is purely topology based.
We thus compared the performance of our method across the three tested AD gene
expression datasets (MSBB, MayoRNASeq, ROSMAP), confirming a significant influence
of the actually used dataset on the AUROC for this particular disease (p = 3.09E − 09,
ANOVA F-test). Hence, gene expression data does have a clear effect on GuiltyTargets.
The use of the Open Targets versus the Therapeutic Target Database significantly
increased the ranking performance of GuiltyTargets by 5%, hence underlining the
relevance of a larger number of known targets for learning the ranking model in the
embedded network space.

GuiltyTargets Learns from Known Targets
We tested, whether the good performance of GuiltyTargets was dependent on known
targets or whether also with a random set of proteins a similar performance could
have been achieved. For this purpose we trained GuiltyTargets for each disease with
100 randomly drawn sets of targets of the same size as the actual ones, which we

incorrectly labeled as “targets”. Prediction performance was evaluated using the same
cross-validation procedure as before. Table S3 confirms that the AUROC for random
proteins drops to about 50%, i.e. chance level. Hence, GuiltyTargets indeed learns
properties of known targets.

GuiltyTargets Allows for Target Repositioning Across Related
Diseases
There is the question whether GuiltyTargets could transfer properties learned from
known targets in one disease area into another one, hence allowing for repositioning
of targets. To address that question we trained GuiltyTargets with all known targets
of neurodegenerative diseases obtained from Open Targets, while excluding known AD
targets. We then ran a hypergeometric test on the resulting prioritization to see if known
AD targets where statistically overrepresented at the top of the list. The results were
significant when at least 2% of the top candidates were considered (Figure 3). This
shows that GuiltyTargets could help for repositioning targets across related disease areas.

Case Study: GuiltyTargets Predicts New Candidate Targets for
Alzheimer’s Disease
Despite of 180 therapeutic targets listed in the Open Targets database, the AD field
urgently requires new and more effective medications that either prevent, mitigate, or
reverse its progression. This is particularly true, because the vast majority of drugs
under development fail in clinical trials [25]. We here picked out AD as a test case for
GuiltyTargets to prioritize new target candidates. We used post-mortem gene expression
data from brain tissue from the ROSMAP study and combined it with STRING based
PPI network and Open Targets as a resource for known targets. ROSMAP data was
chosen because of its comparably large number of samples (495 AD patients and 438
controls). Table 3 shows the top 0.1% of a ranked list of novel candidate targets
(likelihood score > 0.4) obtained with GuiltyTargets. According to the TTD [31] and

Table 3. Target prioritization for AD using ROSMAP gene expression data. This list
shows candidate proteins above a likelihood score threshold of 0.4. The last column
shows either known drugs (including indications) against the respective target or the
classification as “druggable” using the information from DGIdb [32] and TTD [31].
DGIdb [32] databases, all but two candidates are druggable, thus they could be used as
targets for drugs using the current drug development methods.
Many of the candidate targets are receptors, namely four acetylcholine receptors
(three nicotinic, one muscarinic), and three glutamate receptors (two metabotropic, one
ionotropic), in agreement with the observation that receptors constitute a large portion of
known AD targets for small molecule drugs [33]. The remaining candidates were identified
as ion channels. The top candidate (CHRNB4) is the target of the compound SIB-1553A,
which has been tested in a phase 2 clinical trial for AD, but discontinued (source:
Therapeutic Target Database). Out of the other top candidates we found CHRFAM7A,
GRM1, GRM3, ITPR1, HTR7, and COMT particularly interesting: CHRFAM7A is
an alpha-7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit interacting with amyloid β, whose
aggregates (i.e., plaques) are one of the hallmarks of AD [34]. CHRFAM7A may promote
neuronal survival and function, and subunits are expressed by astrocytes participating in
synaptic communication [35]. GRM1 is the target of the compound PF-1913539, which
has been discontinued in a phase 3 AD trial [31]. GRM3 (mGlu3) is found in astrocytes
as well as neuronal cells, and have been observed to have neuroprotective properties.
Its agonists and positive allosteric modulators were reported to be potentially helpful
for AD treatment [36]. Glial mGlu3 receptors regulate the production of neurotrophic
factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived
neurotrophic factor [36]. BCI-632, a compound that targets GRM3, is currently tested
in a phase 1 AD trial [31]. ITPR1, an intracellular Ca 2+ channel, mediates calcium
release from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering apoptosis, and its deletion has been
linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 15, a neurodegenerative disease [37, 38]. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs73310256 in HTR7 [39] and rs4680 in COMT have
been associated with AD [40]. COMT is currently discussed as a target for AD [41].
Finally, COMT is the target of the anti-Parkinson drug Tolcapone (source: TTD),
supporting our previous finding that GuiltyTargets can re-propose targets from related
diseases.
Visualization of interactions between known and candidate targets (Figure 4) revealed
that the network of known and proposed targets has a higher than expected interaction
rate (PPI enrichment p < 1.0E − 16, calculated using STRING web interface). Further-

more, the candidate targets were observed to reside on the borders of this interaction
network. These two observations lead to the hypothesis that targeting the proposed
candidates would propagate through the network, influencing disease-related proteins
indirectly. Generating drugs that target multiple proteins in this list might be effective,
if these candidates were to be considered as different entry points to the disease module.

Discussion
We presented a novel network representation learning based approach for target prioritization, GuiltyTargets. Our approach uses a protein-protein interaction network, a
differential gene expression profile and a list of known targets to prioritizes proteins
as targets for a particular disease. We showed that GuiltyTargets is highly robust and
significantly outperforms the method by Emig et al. in terms of ranking performance.
As demonstrated by our validation studies, it is applicable to various types of diseases,
including cancers, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrated that
GuiltyTargets can be used to repurpose existing targets from a different (but related)
disease area. Application of GuiltyTargets to AD showed that several of the highest
ranked candidates are indeed proposed in the literature for AD, and three of them have
been targeted by candidate AD drugs. Moreover, our case study once more demonstrated
the possibility to repurpose existing targets from related disease areas with our methods,
e.g. COMT as target of the drug Tolcapone in Parkinson’s Disease.

(including the one by Emig et al.) learn properties of known targets to rank candidate
proteins. Hence, these approaches rely on available information about targets, which
is often incomplete and noisy [43]. Because of their dependency on available data
machine learning approaches typically have difficulties to propose candidates that point
towards completely novel disease biology. Despite these limitations GuiltyTargets showed
promising results for target prioritization, including our case study for AD. Hence, we
see GuiltyTargets as a promising tool to support the decision process in the context of
target identification in pharmaceutical research.

Materials and Methods
Information Sources
Three types of information sources were used for target prioritization:
1. differential gene expression profiles between diseased and healthy subjects
2. protein-protein interaction networks (PPI network)
3. disease-specific target annotation
In the following we provide more detailed information about these data.
Gene Expression Data
Gene expression data for acute myleoid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and multiple sclerosis was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [44], and differential gene expression was assessed via GEO2R [45],
Biobase [46], GEOquery [47] and limma [48] using multiple testing correction via the
false discovery rate [49] (see: Supplementary Table 1).
For AD, RNASeq data from the AM-PAD Knowledge Portal (AM-PAD) was used [50].
In particular, MSBB, ROSMAP, and MayoRNASeq studies were utilized. Differential
gene expression was assessed by applying DESeq2 to the normalized RNAseq data for
each brain region (Table S4).
Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
As PPI networks, HIPPIE v2.0 [30] and STRING v10.5 [29] were used since both of
these networks are created by combining multiple sources of PPIs and provide confidence
scores. HIPPIE and STRING differ in the type of interactions they contain (Table S5):
HIPPIE relies on physical protein-protein interactions, whereas STRING captures more
broadly functional interactions. Hence, STRING has a much larger size than HIPPIE.
The analyses on this paper only included the interactions between human proteins.
STRING locus identifiers were mapped to Entrez identifies using the mappings provided
by STRING.
Target Databases
Information about known targets were obtained from two databases: The Therapeutic
Target Database (TTD) [31] and Open Targets [18] (see: Table S6). Target identifiers in
TTD database were mapped to UniProt identifiers using the conversion file provided
by TTD. These identifiers were then mapped to Entrez gene IDs using R packages
AnnotationDBI [51] and org.Hs.eg.db [52]. In addition to TTD, known protein targets
were retrieved from Open Targets. HGNC symbols were converted to Entrez identifiers
using R packages AnnotationDBI [51] and org.Hs.eg.db [52].

GuiltyTargets
Deep Network Representation Learning
GuiltyTargets relies on a deep representation learning of an annotated PPI network via
Gat2Vec, where node attributes represent discretized gene expression log fold changes
(see Results part). In a first step, two separate graphs, the structural and the attribute
graph, are constructed from the original labeled PPI network, where the structural graph
corresponds to the PPI network, and the attribute graph is a bipartite graph between
protein nodes and discretized log fold changes. Afterwards Gat2Vec retrieves for each
vertex its structural context through random walks of a predefined length. The exact
parameters that we used to run Gat2Vec are given in Table S7. The result of each
random walk is a sequence of vertices and node attributes, respectively. These sequences
are subsequently embedded into an Euclidean space using a SkipGram neural network,
which is an essential part of the well known Word2Vec method [53].
Target Candidate Ranking
The features obtained from annotated PPI networks and the disease-specific target
annotations were used to train a logistic regression classifier. Following a PU learning
scheme known targets were assigned positive labels, and the remaining proteins were
treated as if they were negatives. It is essential to note that proteins that are not
known as targets in a particular disease of interest could in fact be targets in another
disease context, and finding them is the primary goal target prioritization approaches.
For the implementation, the LogisticRegression class from linear model module and
OneVsRestClassifier class from multiclass module in Python library scikit-learn were
used [54].
